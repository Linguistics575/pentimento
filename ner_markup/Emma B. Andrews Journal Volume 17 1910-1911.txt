PAGE 72October 25, 1910SS. <PERSON>Kronprinz Wilhelm</PERSON>.Sailed this a.m. from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> at ten o’clock for <LOCATION>Cherbourg</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION>.  It seems an absurd route to take to <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> – but the service of the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION> steamers is so disorganized because of the cholera in so many infected port, and the necessity of quarantine, that we cancelled our engagement for <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>.  We will take the Schleswig at <LOCATION>Marseilles</LOCATION>, instead of <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION>. Sunday, Oct. 30.We have had an uneventful stupid voyage, and are due at <LOCATION>Cherbourg</LOCATION> tomorrow.  We have had rain, cold winds, and rough seas.  Very pleasant rooms.<LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> – Oct. 31. <ORGANIZATION>Westminster Hotel</ORGANIZATION>.We made <ORGANIZATION>Plymouth</ORGANIZATION> at 7 o’clock this morning – I got up and looked out at the interesting coast – reached <LOCATION>Cherbourg</LOCATION> at 1 p.m. and were off at 3.  We felt some little trepidation at committing ourselves to a French railway – there has been such a history of accidents in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>! But we knew that this line had been thoroughly repaired – as was shown by the piles of the old sleepers all along the road – in the most astounding state of decay – utter rottenness – they gave damning evidence of neglect.  I had never seen the <PERSON>Brittany</PERSON> country before. How charming those wide reaching fields were, in the late afternoon light – so softly green – and the characteristic, mostly PAGE 73pollarded trees in their tints of bronze and olive green and russet pink, made a picture, or rather a succession of them that looked as if they might have been painted by <PERSON>Troyen</PERSON> or Coret.  It was a blissful afternoon – and we so enjoyed it.  Arrived in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> at 10 – and found Mr. <PERSON>Rathbone</PERSON> waiting for us.  They are at the <LOCATION>Bedford</LOCATION>.Tuesday. Nov. 1st.It has poured with rain all day – have not been out of the house.  It is All Saints Day, and every magasin and museum is closed.  Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON>Rathbone</PERSON> and <PERSON>Elèna</PERSON> came to lunch, and are to turn up at the <LOCATION>Gare de Lyon</LOCATION> at 10.  Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON>John E. Parsons</PERSON> are in this hotel, and we went to their rooms to have tea with them.  We quite enjoyed our little dinner up in our sitting room.  Hotel are crowded here – the manager told us there were more than 200 people in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> waiting for a chance to cross the <LOCATION>Mediterranean</LOCATION>.<PERSON>N. G. Lloyd SS</PERSON>. Schleswig.Wednesday. Nov. 2nd.We had a rough night on our funny Wagon-Lit – and jolted through it with what patience we could – felling as if we were travelling in a card-board box – arrived by 9 o’clock – found our old rooms ready for us – did not get off until nearly 5 o’clock – there being so many passengers and such piles of luggage. PAGE 74Friday. Nov. 4th.Passed the straits at 1.30 – a lovely day – warm and calm.  The dreadful ravages on either hand, were a piteous contrast to the beauty of the day.Sunday. Nov. 6th.Due at <LOCATION>Alexamdria</LOCATION> tomorrow at 6am – a warm, lovely passage.  I have been writing letter busily.Monday. Nov. 7th.Shepheards Hotel.Arrived at 12:30 and were soon eating lunch on the 13th day out from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>! Surprising when one reflects that our steamers to <LOCATION>Naples</LOCATION> always take 13 days for the voyage! Are in our pleasant[1] old rooms, overlooking the garden – the weather is perfect.Monday. Nov. 14th.Rather a busy week, settling ourselves and things on the boat, seeing sights –visiting and receiving friends – consulting Mr. <PERSON>Draper</PERSON> about the little mooring garden. Lunched one day with the Gorsts, and another day went to a reception there. Capt. <PERSON>Trefusis</PERSON>, and Mr. <PERSON>Carter Bonham</PERSON>, <PERSON>Elèna</PERSON>’s friend, dined with us one night, and Mr. <PERSON>Lovatt</PERSON> and son – another night – and Mr. <PERSON>Lovatt</PERSON> and son and Mr. <PERSON>Walter Gay</PERSON> came to tea on our first afternoon on the boat.  We had tea with the Gays one afternoon – Mrs. Gay very attractive.PAGE 75 Monday. Nov. 21st.We came on board to stay on the 16th and sailed the next day at 10 a.m. passed the <LOCATION>Ghizeh</LOCATION> bridge about 10.20.  We have a good strong tug.  Tied up at 5 P.M. We find a tremendously big, wide river, with very trong current and made 35 miles the first day, 42 the second, 51 the third, 39 the fourth, 47 the 5th, 37 the 6th, 51 the seventh, 43 the eighth, 38 the ninth, 50-½ the tenth – arrived at <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION> the 27th.  We tied up much in our usual place – to a mite of a sand bank, opposite the castle.Second Sunday in Advent. Dec. 4th.A pleasant two weeks we have had – fine, good weather.  <PERSON>Elèna</PERSON> busy and enchanted.  We have been over to the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION> for lunch.  The <PERSON>Buckley</PERSON> family here for tea one afternoon.  Mr. <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON>Weigall</PERSON> for lunch.  Mr. <PERSON>Nicol</PERSON> also for lunch.  <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> several times to the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION>.Third Sunday in Advent. Dec. 11th.A rather busy week.

Mr. <PERSON>Nicol</PERSON> to dine – Mrs. <PERSON>Butler</PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON>Weigall</PERSON> to dine.  <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> has established <PERSON>Harry Burton</PERSON> in his new concession the ‘Priest Kings’ <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION>.  <PERSON>M. Maspero</PERSON> was anxious <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> should clear this but <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> does not look for much of a result.  <PERSON>Harold Jones</PERSON> is so poorly, so weak, quite incapable of work, even painting.  <PERSON>Buth</PERSON> his brother <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> keeps a certain supervision of the men.  This afternoon <PERSON>Elèna</PERSON>, <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> and I rode over to see Mr. <PERSON>Carter</PERSON> and see some of Mr. <PERSON>Nicol</PERSON>’s paintings –PAGE 76Very lovely they were.  <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> bought one.Fourth Sunday in Advent.  Dec. 18th.<PERSON>Harold Jones</PERSON> and <PERSON>Cyril</PERSON> came over and spent 3 days at the <LOCATION>Winter Palace</LOCATION>, lunched twice with me.  I gave tea at the Palace on day, and asked a few of <PERSON>Harold</PERSON>’s friends – the poor fellow looked very tired when it was over.  <PERSON>Baron</PERSON> v. <PERSON>Mumm</PERSON>  called one afternoon – he is on his way back to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> – he is the German minister of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>.  Mr. And Mrs. <PERSON>Gibson Fahnstock</PERSON> came to tea on Wednesday.  We had for tea Miss <PERSON>Kelly</PERSON> and her brother, Mr. <PERSON>Whitaker</PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON>Whymper</PERSON> were here for tea.  The <ORGANIZATION>Kellys</ORGANIZATION> played and sang.Christmas Day – Dec. 25th.We had the usual gifts for the sailors this morning – <PERSON>Harry Burton</PERSON> came this evening to stay until Wednesday morning.

Dec. 31st.We have had a cold week.  <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> spent his usual 3 days in the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION> – nothing has yet been found.  We have seen a good deal of Mr. <PERSON>Whitaker</PERSON> and his party. They are on the old Cleopatra – but he has done a great deal to it and put about a great many pretty things, and PAGE 77It looks very attractive.  Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON>Newberry</PERSON> are with him, and they are to excavate somewhere near <LOCATION>Akmim</LOCATION>.Saturday Jan. 7. 1911The “Miriam” with the <PERSON>Masperos</PERSON> arrived on the 3rd.  <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> and I called on them the next morning.  <PERSON>Madame Maspero</PERSON> has been very ill on the way up with a bronchial attack.

It has been bitterly cold lately – and constant high winds – we have been covered with sand – as the wind has been from the west.  <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> came home from the Valley, after 4 days there.Sunday. Feb. 13th.Another bitterly cold day – Mr. <PERSON>Whymper</PERSON> to breakfast – so delightfully amusing.  I had a quiet morning.  Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON>Girard Foster</PERSON>, and Mrs. <PERSON>Graham</PERSON>, who is up from <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION>, for a few days, came to tea.PAGE 79Sunday.

He is just opening a large tomb or cachette for Lord Carnarvon – and when we had tea, he went back at once to his work.  The Hon. <PERSON>Henry</PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON>Hobhouse</PERSON> (from <PERSON>G. Farrer</PERSON>) dined with us this evening. <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> is to give them lunch in the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION> tomorrow.Sunday. Feb. 26th.We telegraphed for tug some days ago – but have no satisfactory answers – the boat has been in proper trim for going down for some time.  Such continued cold weather and uch gales – we have no deck life at all. Telegram from Mr. <PERSON>J.P. Morgan</PERSON> begging Theo to wait here until he comes.  Crowds of visitors.  <PERSON>Lady Layard</PERSON>, and the Countess here to tea today.  I have been to <LOCATION>Karnak</LOCATION> several times – <PERSON>Nicol</PERSON> here twice to dine.Mar. 1. Ash Wednesday.Mr <PERSON>Morgan</PERSON> with his sister arrived on the <LOCATION>Khonsu</LOCATION> – on Monday, PAGE 80and lunched in the <LOCATION>Valley</LOCATION> with <PERSON>Theo</PERSON>.

Mar. 4th.     40 miles. Sailed at 7 A.M. – reached <PERSON>Nagh Hamadi</PERSON> at 12:15, passed the bridge and then waited until 3:30, waiting for the tug to cool – and reached <LOCATION>Balliana</LOCATION> at 5:30 where we wait until tomorrow – to give <PERSON>Elèna Rathbone</PERSON> a chance to see <LOCATION>Abydos</LOCATION> – and we promised the <LOCATION>Navilles</LOCATION> to lunch with them.  It has been a fine, warm day – and our brillian young moon, and the resplendent <PERSON>Venus</PERSON>, make the nights too beautiful to sleep.Monday. Mar. 6th.Started about 10 for <LOCATION>Abydos</LOCATION> – fearing a hot day – had 2 carriages – we found a cold north wind blowing, and we really suffered with cold.  It was a market day, and the people were streaming along the dusty road – men, women carrying babies, camels, donkeys, sheep andPAGE 81goats – making the air thick with dust.  It is such a pity that one must always see <LOCATION>Abydos</LOCATION> in the glare of mid-day!  Mme. <PERSON>Naville</PERSON> came up from their little house in its nest in the sandy desert, to see us – and we all went back with her – I sitting on a man’s saddle on a wretched donkey, - the cold wind almost blowing my clothes off – and my eyes blinded.  But the little house was cheerful and comfortable and the lunch very good, and M. and Mme. <PERSON>Naville</PERSON> very nice as they always are.  Mr. <PERSON>Whitmore</PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON>Dixon</PERSON>, young men working with the <LOCATION>Navilles</LOCATION>.  The ride home was away from the wind, and the fields so green and fragrant with their blossoming crops, and the birds singing everywhere.  The people were in their straw houses, which they build for watching their crops – and it was very pastoral.  Found a huge mail waiting for us.  We steamed down to <PERSON>Girga</PERSON>, 8 miles, and are here for the night.Tuesday. Mar. 7th.Started at 6 A.M. and went on until 6 P.M. -  5 miles from <LOCATION>Assiut</LOCATION> – making 87 miles.Wednesday. Mar. 8th.52 miles.Arrived at <LOCATION>Assiut</LOCATION> early, and waited for various things – 4 hours – then on to 7 miles of <PERSON>Hadj Kandul</PERSON>.Thursday. March 9th.Started at 7 o’clock – stopped at <PERSON>Hagi Kondul</PERSON> for an hourPAGE 82so that <PERSON>Elèna</PERSON> should see the <LOCATION>Khuenaton</LOCATION> pavement, then on, until <PERSON>Beni Hassan</PERSON> was reached, which <PERSON>Elèna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> visited.  The day hot – wind and clouds of dust.  43 miles.Friday, March 10th.53 miles.Started at 7 o’clock – spent 2 hours at <LOCATION>Minia</LOCATION> – tied up at 6 o’clock at <LOCATION>Maghaga</LOCATION>.Saturday. Mar. 11th.87 miles.An early start at 6 o’clock – and reached <PERSON>Bedreschein</PERSON> at 7 o’clock.  The river has been rather good.  The tug has been on the sand once or twice for a short time, but the dahabya has not once touched it – a strong wind all day and cold. Second Sunday in Lent. March 12th.Started at 7 o’clock – and made the bridge at 9 o’clock and waited an hour to pass. Came to our landing at 11.30 – and found the mooring garden looking very pretty.  We arrived the 10th day from <LOCATION>Luxor</LOCATION>.  Found telegram telling of <PERSON>Harold Jones</PERSON>’ peaceful end on Thursday, the 9th.March 13th. Monday.Mr. <PERSON>Draper</PERSON> to lunch yesterday.  At home all day – rather warm today.  <PERSON>Elèna</PERSON> and I drove into town this morning – saw a numberPAGE 83of friends – met Mr. <PERSON>Newberry</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Deimers</LOCATION>, and he went with us to <LOCATION>Kolekians</LOCATION> and to <LOCATION>Kasseras</LOCATION> – there <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> joined us, and we went to Nachmans.  <PERSON>Elèna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> went after lunch to the <ORGANIZATION>Mena House</ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> and I went for a drive – and finding ourselves, in spite of warm wraps, freezing in the cold wind, we came home.March 14th. Tuesday.At home all day – still cold and windy.Wednesday. March 15th.<PERSON>Elèna</PERSON> and <PERSON>Harry</PERSON> made and early start for <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION> – going by train to the <ORGANIZATION>Mena House</ORGANIZATION>, and taking donkeys for <LOCATION>Sakkara</LOCATION>.  They came back at 7 P.M. after a joyful day.  Mr. <PERSON>Winlock</PERSON> appeared this morning at 10 – and made quite a visit – then he, <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> and I went to town, and to <LOCATION>Kyticas</LOCATION>’s to see a lovely Greek statuette which <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> thinks of buying.  Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON>Newberry</PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> came to lunch, and we had such a pleasant visit.  I went at 5 o’clock over to the Cleopatra to tea with the Whittakers – Lady <PERSON>Layard</PERSON>, and the 2 ladies staying with them, Mr. <PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> and Capt. <PERSON>Trefusis</PERSON> there.  Coming home, I overtook Theo walking, and as the cold, cold wind had much moderated, and he got into the carriage, we drove around the island.Thursday. Nov. 16th.In town this morning – met <PERSON>Artin Pasha</PERSON>, and Mr. <PERSON>Sayce</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Kyticas</LOCATION>’s – then went to the Museum – <PERSON>M. Daressy</PERSON> took us into hisPAGE 84working room, to show how he was succeeding with the restoring of the beautiful coffin found in Queen <PERSON>Tiyi</PERSON>’s tomb – a long and very difficult task it is.  Friday. Mar. 17.The morning was so very hot, that we did nothing but drive until 12 o’clock – when I left <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> at the boat, and I went to the Semeraine’s Hotel to see Mrs. <PERSON>Duvar</PERSON> – she was not at home.  I left a note for her.  In the afternoon, <PERSON>Elèna</PERSON> went with Mr. <PERSON>Bonar-Carter</PERSON> to polo – Harry and Mr. <PERSON>Whymper</PERSON> to the Zoo, where <PERSON>Theo</PERSON> and I soon followed them – and had a lovely visit.  Just as we came away, we me <PERSON>Artin Pasha</PERSON>, and Mr. <PERSON>Sayce</PERSON>, who said they had just been to the boat hoping to find us, so they came back all of them for tea, and a long visit, and much pleasant talk.Saturday. Mar. 18th.In the house all day – a severe gale began about 7 o’clock – and grew in violence – making a great knocking about of the boats along the shore – a small yawl disappeared just behind us – and a gyassa was wrecked near the bridge.  <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> could not be seen across the river, in the clouds of dust.  In doors all day.Sunday. Mar. 19th.The weather quite perfect today.  I have not been out.  Mr. <PERSON>Bonham Carter</PERSON> came in this afternoon – and Capt. <PERSON>Trefusis</PERSON> – looking PAGE 85so well, and announcing his engagement to Miss <PERSON>Margery Graham</PERSON> – the marriage to take place in May.   She is a daughter of Sir <PERSON>John Graham</PERSON> and a niece of Lord <LOCATION>Northampton</LOCATION>.Monday. Mar. 20th.In the house all day, except for a short visit to town.  Mrs. <PERSON>Dewar</PERSON> came for a visit at 12 o’clock – and Miss Coater for lunch.  Since then I have been busy packing.  The day has been decidedly cool.Thursday. Mar. 23rd Ghezireh Palace HotelWe came here this afternoon to our old rooms.  It was sad to leave the dahabya – but the garden and lawns and trees are so lovely here, and our big windows let in so much of it to us – that it is quite lovely.<PERSON>Maspero</PERSON> to <PERSON>Louise</PERSON>, 11/10/1910 "<PERSON>Maspero Lettres</PERSON> to <PERSON>Louise</PERSON> p 497CAIRE, LE 10 NOVEMBRE 1910Le travail commence á abonder au Musée : les touristes et les fouilleurs rentrent. <PERSON>Davis</PERSON> est arrivé avant-hier, florissant, avec <PERSON>Madame Andrews</PERSON> et une nièce nouvelle du nom de Rathbone, une grande et belle fille un peu fanée (wilted), mais de manières très supérieures á celles des nièces des années précédentes.
