<ner>SS.</ner> <ner>Kronprinz</ner> <ner>Wilhelm.</ner>

Sailed this a.m. from <ner>New</ner> <ner>York</ner> at ten o’clock for <ner>Cherbourg</ner> and Paris. It seems an absurd route to take to <ner>Cairo</ner> – but the service of the <ner>Mediterranean</ner> steamers is so disorganized because of the cholera in so many infected port, and the necessity of quarantine, that we cancelled our engagement for Naples. We will take the Schleswig at Marseilles, instead of Naples.

Sunday, Oct. 30.

We have had an uneventful stupid voyage, and are due at <ner>Cherbourg</ner> tomorrow. We have had rain, cold winds, and rough seas. Very pleasant rooms.

<ner>Paris</ner> – Oct. 31. <ner>Westminster</ner> <ner>Hotel.</ner>

We made <ner>Plymouth</ner> at 7 o’clock this morning – I got up and looked out at the interesting coast – reached <ner>Cherbourg</ner> at 1 p.m. and were off at 3. We felt some little trepidation at committing ourselves to a French railway – there has been such a history of accidents in France! But we knew that this line had been thoroughly repaired – as was shown by the piles of the old sleepers all along the road – in the most astounding state of decay – utter rottenness – they gave damning evidence of neglect. I had never seen the <ner>Brittany</ner> country before. How charming those wide reaching fields were, in the late afternoon light – so softly green – and the characteristic, mostly

PAGE 73

pollarded trees in their tints of bronze and olive green and russet pink, made a picture, or rather a succession of them that looked as if they might have been painted by <ner>Troyen</ner> or Coret. It was a blissful afternoon – and we so enjoyed it. Arrived in <ner>Paris</ner> at 10 – and found Mr. <ner>Rathbone</ner> waiting for us. They are at the Bedford.

Tuesday. Nov. 1st.

It has poured with rain all day – have not been out of the house. It is All Saints Day, and every magasin and museum is closed. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Rathbone</ner> and <ner>Elèna</ner> came to lunch, and are to turn up at the <ner>Gare</ner> <ner>de</ner> <ner>Lyon</ner> at 10. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>John</ner> <ner>E.</ner> <ner>Parsons</ner> are in this hotel, and we went to their rooms to have tea with them. We quite enjoyed our little dinner up in our sitting room. Hotel are crowded here – the manager told us there were more than 200 people in <ner>Paris</ner> waiting for a chance to cross the Mediterranean.

<ner>N.</ner> <ner>G.</ner> <ner>Lloyd</ner> <ner>SS.</ner> <ner>Schleswig.</ner>

Wednesday. Nov. 2nd.

We had a rough night on our funny Wagon-Lit – and jolted through it with what patience we could – felling as if we were travelling in a card-board box – arrived by 9 o’clock – found our old rooms ready for us – did not get off until nearly 5 o’clock – there being so many passengers and such piles of luggage.

PAGE 74

Friday. Nov. 4th.

Passed the straits at 1.30 – a lovely day – warm and calm. The dreadful ravages on either hand, were a piteous contrast to the beauty of the day.

Sunday. Nov. 6th.

Due at <ner>Alexamdria</ner> tomorrow at 6am – a warm, lovely passage. I have been writing letter busily.

Monday. Nov. 7th.

Shepheards Hotel.

Arrived at 12:30 and were soon eating lunch on the 13th day out from New York! Surprising when one reflects that our steamers to <ner>Naples</ner> always take 13 days for the voyage! Are in our pleasant[1] old rooms, overlooking the garden – the weather is perfect.

Monday. Nov. 14th.

Rather a busy week, settling ourselves and things on the boat, seeing sights –visiting and receiving friends – consulting Mr. <ner>Draper</ner> about the little mooring garden. Lunched one day with the Gorsts, and another day went to a reception there. Capt. Trefusis, and Mr. <ner>Carter</ner> Bonham, Elèna’s friend, dined with us one night, and Mr. <ner>Lovatt</ner> and son – another night – and Mr. <ner>Lovatt</ner> and son and Mr. <ner>Walter</ner> <ner>Gay</ner> came to tea on our first afternoon on the boat. We had tea with the Gays one afternoon – Mrs. <ner>Gay</ner> very attractive.

PAGE 75

Monday. Nov. 21st.

We came on board to stay on the 16th and sailed the next day at 10 a.m. passed the <ner>Ghizeh</ner> bridge about 10.20. We have a good strong tug. Tied up at 5 P.M. We find a tremendously big, wide river, with very trong current and made 35 miles the first day, 42 the second, 51 the third, 39 the fourth, 47 the 5th, 37 the 6th, 51 the seventh, 43 the eighth, 38 the ninth, 50-½ the tenth – arrived at <ner>Luxor</ner> the 27th.

We tied up much in our usual place – to a mite of a sand bank, opposite the castle.

Second Sunday in Advent. Dec. 4th.

A pleasant two weeks we have had – fine, good weather. Elèna busy and enchanted. We have been over to the <ner>Valley</ner> for lunch. The <ner>Buckley</ner> family here for tea one afternoon. Mr. <ner>Carter</ner> and Mr. <ner>Weigall</ner> for lunch. Mr. <ner>Nicol</ner> also for lunch. Theo several times to the Valley.

Third Sunday in Advent. Dec. 11th.

A rather busy week. Mr. <ner>Weigall</ner> and his sister Mrs. <ner>Butler</ner> to tea one day. Mr. <ner>Nicol</ner> to dine – Mrs. <ner>Butler</ner> and Mr. <ner>Weigall</ner> to dine. Theo has established <ner>Harry</ner> <ner>Burton</ner> in his new concession the ‘Priest Kings’ Valley. <ner>M.</ner> <ner>Maspero</ner> was anxious <ner>Theo</ner> should clear this but <ner>Theo</ner> does not look for much of a result. <ner>Harold</ner> <ner>Jones</ner> is so poorly, so weak, quite incapable of work, even painting. Buth his brother <ner>Cyril</ner> keeps a certain supervision of the men. This afternoon Elèna, Theo and I rode over to see Mr. <ner>Carter</ner> and see some of Mr. Nicol’s paintings –

PAGE 76

Very lovely they were. Theo bought one.

Fourth Sunday in Advent. Dec. 18th.

<ner>Harold</ner> <ner>Jones</ner> and <ner>Cyril</ner> came over and spent 3 days at the Winter Palace, lunched twice with me. I gave tea at the Palace on day, and asked a few of Harold’s friends – the poor fellow looked very tired when it was over. Baron v. <ner>Mumm</ner> called one afternoon – he is on his way back to <ner>China</ner> – he is the German minister of China. Mr. And Mrs. <ner>Gibson</ner> <ner>Fahnstock</ner> came to tea on Wednesday. We had for tea Miss <ner>Kelly</ner> and her brother, Mr. <ner>Whitaker</ner> and Mr. <ner>Whymper</ner> were here for tea. The <ner>Kellys</ner> played and sang.

Christmas Day – Dec. 25th.

We had the usual gifts for the sailors this morning – <ner>Harry</ner> <ner>Burton</ner> came this evening to stay until Wednesday morning. Tuesday being market day, it is the one holiday in the week for workmen. Theo spent 3 days in the <ner>Valley</ner> this week. Mr. Crane, who is busy painting the Horemheb tomb, lunched with us today. Capt. <ner>Walter</ner> <ner>Trefusis</ner> dined with us today.

Saturday. Dec. 31st.

We have had a cold week. <ner>Theo</ner> spent his usual 3 days in the <ner>Valley</ner> – nothing has yet been found. We have seen a good deal of Mr. <ner>Whitaker</ner> and his party. They are on the old Cleopatra – but he has done a great deal to it and put about a great many pretty things, and

PAGE 77

It looks very attractive. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Newberry</ner> are with him, and they are to excavate somewhere near <ner>Akmim.</ner>

Saturday Jan. 7. 1911

The “Miriam” with the <ner>Masperos</ner> arrived on the 3rd. Theo and I called on them the next morning. Madame <ner>Maspero</ner> has been very ill on the way up with a bronchial attack. They are to stay 3 weeks. Mrs. <ner>McCormick</ner> and Miss <ner>Scott</ner> dined here tonight.

Saturday. Jan. 14.

Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Buckley</ner> to lunch on Sunday, a warm fine day. Mr. <ner>Carter</ner> to tea one day. Harry as usual here for 2 days. Theo as usual in the Valley 3 days. Many visitors.

The usual weekly story – visitors, visits, teas and dinners. Lady <ner>Gorst</ner> and Miss <ner>Gorst</ner> here for tea one afternoon.

Saturday. Jan. 28th.

A rather cold stormy week, with a little rain. Mrs. <ner>Hunter</ner> of <ner>London</ner> dined on Monday – Mrs. And Miss <ner>Warner</ner> of <ner>Boston</ner> and Miss Webb, a <ner>Marquise</ner> <ner>Guadalmina</ner> and her son, Spaniards, here to tea on Wednesday. <ner>Theo</ner> and I at <ner>Mohassibs</ner> one morning – met Miss Cassatt, the artist who lives in Paris. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Kelekian</ner> came with her afterwards for tea. Mr <ner>Nicol</ner> dined on Friday. Cold and stormy.

PAGE 78

Saturday. Feb. 4th

Among our visitors this week was the Rev. <ner>Endicott</ner> Peabody, Head Master of the famous school for boys at <ner>Groton,</ner> <ner>Mass.</ner> Introduced by cable from Mr. <ner>Fairfield</ner> Osborn. A very interesting man. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Newberry</ner> dined on Tuesday. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Nahmstock</ner> to lunch on Wednesday. <ner>Theo</ner> as usual in the Valley 3 days.

Saturday. Feb. 11.

Among our visitors this week were Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Charles</ner> <ner>B.</ner> <ner>Alexander</ner> of 4 <ner>West</ner> <ner>58</ner> <ner>St.</ner> <ner>New</ner> <ner>York</ner> on the Serapis with their 3 girls; Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Henry</ner> <ner>Hobhouse</ner> of <ner>England</ner> introduced by <ner>Gaspard</ner> Farrer; Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Williams</ner> and Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Langley</ner> P.W.D. people of Cairo; Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Gerard</ner> <ner>Foster</ner> of Lenox, Miss <ner>Ives</ner> and Mrs. <ner>Alexander</ner> of <ner>New</ner> <ner>York</ner> whose daughter lately married young <ner>Theodore</ner> <ner>Roosevelt;</ner> Mr. and Mrs. <ner>John</ner> <ner>Collander</ner> <ner>Livingston</ner> [2]on the “Scarab”. It has been bitterly cold lately – and constant high winds – we have been covered with sand – as the wind has been from the west. Theo came home from the Valley, after 4 days there.

Sunday. Feb. 13th.

Another bitterly cold day – Mr. <ner>Whymper</ner> to breakfast – so delightfully amusing. I had a quiet morning. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Girard</ner> Foster, and Mrs. Graham, who is up from Cairo, for a few days, came to tea.

PAGE 79

Sunday. Feb. 19th.

A rather monotonous week of constant visitors. Amongst the most pleasant were Mr. and Mrs. <ner>John</ner> <ner>Collander</ner> Livingston, and daughter sent by Mrs. <ner>Hamilton</ner> <ner>Fish</ner> <ner>Webster.</ner> <ner>Delightful</ner> people. Our neighbors Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Anchincloss</ner> and Miss Jennings, M. and Mme. <ner>Naville</ner> and <ner>M.</ner> <ner>Rodier</ner> to dine. Mrs. And Miss Cherry, sisters of Mr. Cust, M. and Mme. <ner>Maspero</ner> and others. Theo and I had a charming afternoon with Mr. <ner>Carter</ner> in his new house – so well built and arranged and pretty – it looked like the abode of an artist and a scholar. He is just opening a large tomb or cachette for Lord Carnarvon – and when we had tea, he went back at once to his work. The Hon. <ner>Henry</ner> and Mrs. <ner>Hobhouse</ner> <ner>(from</ner> <ner>G.</ner> <ner>Farrer)</ner> dined with us this evening. Theo is to give them lunch in the <ner>Valley</ner> tomorrow.

Sunday. Feb. 26th.

We telegraphed for tug some days ago – but have no satisfactory answers – the boat has been in proper trim for going down for some time. Such continued cold weather and uch gales – we have no deck life at all. Telegram from Mr. <ner>J.P.</ner> <ner>Morgan</ner> begging Theo to wait here until he comes. Crowds of visitors. Lady Layard, and the Countess here to tea today. I have been to <ner>Karnak</ner> several times – <ner>Nicol</ner> here twice to dine.

Mar. 1. <ner>Ash</ner> Wednesday.

Mr <ner>Morgan</ner> with his sister arrived on the Khonsu – on Monday,

PAGE 80

and lunched in the <ner>Valley</ner> with Theo. I did not go out. Had tea on the <ner>Sudan</ner> with Mrs. <ner>Anchincloss</ner> and Miss Jennings. Over to say goodbye to <ner>Contessa</ner> <ner>Contardone</ner> who was ill in bed with bad cold.

Friday. Mar. 3rd.

<ner>Elèna</ner> arrived from <ner>Khartoum</ner> last evening. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Newberry</ner> and Mr. <ner>Johnson</ner> (Père) Mr. <ner>Whymper</ner> were here for tea. Mr. <ner>Nicol</ner> to dine. We started 10 minutes to 11 o’clock – and at 6 p.m. were at Keneh, where we waited for <ner>Harry</ner> and <ner>Elèna</ner> to visit Dendera – then we moved on 2-3 miles for the night – making altogether 50 miles.

Saturday. Mar. 4th.

40 miles. Sailed at 7 A.M. – reached <ner>Nagh</ner> <ner>Hamadi</ner> at 12:15, passed the bridge and then waited until 3:30, waiting for the tug to cool – and reached <ner>Balliana</ner> at 5:30 where we wait until tomorrow – to give <ner>Elèna</ner> <ner>Rathbone</ner> a chance to see <ner>Abydos</ner> – and we promised the <ner>Navilles</ner> to lunch with them. It has been a fine, warm day – and our brillian young moon, and the resplendent Venus, make the nights too beautiful to sleep.

Monday. Mar. 6th.

Started about 10 for <ner>Abydos</ner> – fearing a hot day – had 2 carriages – we found a cold north wind blowing, and we really suffered with cold. It was a market day, and the people were streaming along the dusty road – men, women carrying babies, camels, donkeys, sheep and

PAGE 81

goats – making the air thick with dust. It is such a pity that one must always see <ner>Abydos</ner> in the glare of mid-day! Mme. <ner>Naville</ner> came up from their little house in its nest in the sandy desert, to see us – and we all went back with her – I sitting on a man’s saddle on a wretched donkey, - the cold wind almost blowing my clothes off – and my eyes blinded. But the little house was cheerful and comfortable and the lunch very good, and M. and Mme. <ner>Naville</ner> very nice as they always are. Mr. <ner>Whitmore</ner> and Mr. Dixon, young men working with the Navilles. The ride home was away from the wind, and the fields so green and fragrant with their blossoming crops, and the birds singing everywhere. The people were in their straw houses, which they build for watching their crops – and it was very pastoral. Found a huge mail waiting for us. We steamed down to Girga, 8 miles, and are here for the night.

Tuesday. Mar. 7th.

Started at 6 A.M. and went on until 6 P.M. - 5 miles from <ner>Assiut</ner> – making 87 miles.

Wednesday. Mar. 8th.

52 miles.

Arrived at <ner>Assiut</ner> early, and waited for various things – 4 hours – then on to 7 miles of <ner>Hadj</ner> <ner>Kandul.</ner>

Thursday. March 9th.

Started at 7 o’clock – stopped at <ner>Hagi</ner> <ner>Kondul</ner> for an hour

PAGE 82

so that <ner>Elèna</ner> should see the Khuenaton pavement, then on, until <ner>Beni</ner> <ner>Hassan</ner> was reached, which <ner>Elèna</ner> and Harry visited. The day hot – wind and clouds of dust. 43 miles.

Friday, March 10th.

53 miles.

Started at 7 o’clock – spent 2 hours at <ner>Minia</ner> – tied up at 6 o’clock at <ner>Maghaga.</ner>

Saturday. Mar. 11th.

87 miles.

An early start at 6 o’clock – and reached <ner>Bedreschein</ner> at 7 o’clock. The river has been rather good. The tug has been on the sand once or twice for a short time, but the dahabya has not once touched it – a strong wind all day and cold.

Second Sunday in Lent. March 12th.

Started at 7 o’clock – and made the bridge at 9 o’clock and waited an hour to pass. Came to our landing at 11.30 – and found the mooring garden looking very pretty. We arrived the 10th day from Luxor. Found telegram telling of <ner>Harold</ner> <ner>Jones’</ner> peaceful end on Thursday, the 9th.

March 13th. Monday.

Mr. <ner>Draper</ner> to lunch yesterday. At home all day – rather warm today. Elèna and I drove into town this morning – saw a number

PAGE 83

of friends – met Mr. <ner>Newberry</ner> at Deimers, and he went with us to <ner>Kolekians</ner> and to <ner>Kasseras</ner> – there <ner>Theo</ner> and <ner>Harry</ner> joined us, and we went to Nachmans. <ner>Elèna</ner> and <ner>Harry</ner> went after lunch to the <ner>Mena</ner> House, and <ner>Theo</ner> and I went for a drive – and finding ourselves, in spite of warm wraps, freezing in the cold wind, we came home.

March 14th. Tuesday.

At home all day – still cold and windy.

Wednesday. March 15th.

<ner>Elèna</ner> and <ner>Harry</ner> made and early start for <ner>Sakkara</ner> – going by train to the <ner>Mena</ner> House, and taking donkeys for Sakkara. They came back at 7 P.M. after a joyful day. Mr. <ner>Winlock</ner> appeared this morning at 10 – and made quite a visit – then he, Theo and I went to town, and to Kyticas’s to see a lovely Greek statuette which <ner>Theo</ner> thinks of buying. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Newberry</ner> and Mr. <ner>Johnson</ner> came to lunch, and we had such a pleasant visit. I went at 5 o’clock over to the Cleopatra to tea with the Whittakers – Lady Layard, and the 2 ladies staying with them, Mr. <ner>Johnson</ner> and Capt. Trefusis there. Coming home, I overtook Theo walking, and as the cold, cold wind had much moderated, and he got into the carriage, we drove around the island.

Thursday. Nov. 16th.

In town this morning – met <ner>Artin</ner> Pasha, and Mr. <ner>Sayce</ner> at Kyticas’s – then went to the Museum – <ner>M.</ner> <ner>Daressy</ner> took us into his

PAGE 84

working room, to show how he was succeeding with the restoring of the beautiful coffin found in Queen Tiyi’s tomb – a long and very difficult task it is.

Friday. Mar. 17.

The morning was so very hot, that we did nothing but drive until 12 o’clock – when I left <ner>Theo</ner> at the boat, and I went to the Semeraine’s Hotel to see Mrs. <ner>Duvar</ner> – she was not at home. I left a note for her. In the afternoon, Elèna went with Mr. <ner>Bonar-Carter</ner> to polo – Harry and Mr. <ner>Whymper</ner> to the Zoo, where <ner>Theo</ner> and I soon followed them – and had a lovely visit. Just as we came away, we me <ner>Artin</ner> Pasha, and Mr. <ner>Sayce,</ner> who said they had just been to the boat hoping to find us, so they came back all of them for tea, and a long visit, and much pleasant talk.

Saturday. Mar. 18th.

In the house all day – a severe gale began about 7 o’clock – and grew in violence – making a great knocking about of the boats along the shore – a small yawl disappeared just behind us – and a gyassa was wrecked near the bridge. <ner>Cairo</ner> could not be seen across the river, in the clouds of dust. In doors all day.

Sunday. Mar. 19th.

The weather quite perfect today. I have not been out. Mr. <ner>Bonham</ner> <ner>Carter</ner> came in this afternoon – and Capt. Trefusis – looking

PAGE 85

so well, and announcing his engagement to Miss <ner>Margery</ner> <ner>Graham</ner> – the marriage to take place in May. She is a daughter of Sir <ner>John</ner> <ner>Graham</ner> and a niece of Lord Northampton.

Monday. Mar. 20th.

In the house all day, except for a short visit to town. Mrs. <ner>Dewar</ner> came for a visit at 12 o’clock – and Miss Coater for lunch. Since then I have been busy packing. The day has been decidedly cool.

Thursday. Mar. 23rd Ghezireh Palace Hotel

We came here this afternoon to our old rooms. It was sad to leave the dahabya – but the garden and lawns and trees are so lovely here, and our big windows let in so much of it to us – that it is quite lovely.
