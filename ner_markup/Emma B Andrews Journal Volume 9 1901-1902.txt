Naples – Grand Hotel.

Nov. 20, 1901.

We arrived this morning after a rough and disagreeable voyage. There was not a day when I could have written an intelligible word. We sailed in the <ner>Hamburg</ner> <ner>SS.</ner> <ner>Columbia</ner> from <ner>New</ner> <ner>York</ner> the 9th of November, Theodore, <ner>Bessie</ner> <ner>Koon</ner> and I. We passed the asores on Thursday the 14th but the weather was so thick they could just be discerned. Reached <ner>Gibraltar</ner> at 3 P.M. the 17th – were off again in two hours – touched at <ner>Algiers</ner> at 4 o’clock on the 18th. It did not look very attractive and it was too late and stormy to land. <ner>Naples</ner> is radiantly beautiful – splendid weather. We are in our old rooms – Vesuvius very quiet. <ner>Ethel</ner> <ner>Bronson</ner> who crossed with us, went on to Genoa.

Sunday evening. Nov. 24.

We are obliged to stay here until Thursday of next week, and then take that long railway journey over to Brindisi, to catch our Austrian <ner>Lloyd</ner> <ner>S.S.</ner> <ner>We</ner> had hoped to get rooms on the <ner>Prins</ner> <ner>Heinrich</ner> going from here the same Thursday, on which will be Mr. <ner>Agassig</ner> and his son <ner>Max</ner> on their way to Ceylon. <ner>Theodore</ner> wrote for these rooms 3 months ago – but on reaching here found there was no chance for them. Two young men, who are to go with <ner>Agassig</ner> came over on the <ner>Columbia</ner> with us. Dr. <ner>Woodward</ner> and Mr. <ner>Bigelow</ner> from <ner>Boston</ner> – such pleasant fellows. They are constantly with us. The weather has been unsettled for 2 days. Yesterday <ner>Theodore</ner> and the young people went up to Vesuvius. Today it has rained, and hailed several times – the clouds clearing away and returning suddenly - vivid lightning. We have been in doors all day.

Friday, Dec. 27.

We have made a good run, and 37 miles, lying now about 10 miles above Manfalout. Passed the great <ner>Gebel</ner> <ner>Abu</ner> <ner>Fedu</ner> chain very successfully, until the last turn, where we always come to grief – we had to track – but afterwards sailed steadily and splendidly through the beautiful evening until 9 o’clock.

Dec. 28. Saturday.

16 miles. 	Assiut. We sailed in a light wind until we reached <ner>Assiut</ner> at 1:30. It was very exciting going through the new canal, past the barrage for the 1st time. A huge wail for us and for v. Bissing – and the salon looks like a business office this evening. Last year we took 24 days to reach here – this year 17!

First Sunday after Christmas. 	Dec. 29.

A strong cold north wind has been blowing all day – and bringing to us the smoke of the great dredges at the barrage, so that being on deck was nasty. Theodore and the <ner>Baron</ner> went over soon after breakfast to the cemetery of <ner>Arab</ner> <ner>el</ner> <ner>Burg</ner> – where a process of rifling by the natives has gone on for 2 years – and some very interesting things have appeared. <ner>V.</ner> <ner>Bissing</ner> expects to do some investigation, and <ner>Theodore</ner> thinks he may join with him. They took Jones, and a lunch basket, three sailors, and crossed the river to where their donkeys were waiting. They did not come back until 5 o’clock, laden with some queer treasures – and reported an interesting day – and a long ride – the most beautiful he had ever taken in <ner>Egypt</ner> – Theodore said. <ner>Nettie</ner> and I did not go off the boat.

Monday. Dec. 30.

38 miles. 	We have made a run of 38 miles – not leaving <ner>Assiut</ner> until 11 o’clock. The Istar came along at 9 o’clock and pulled up ahead of us. Theodore and the <ner>Baron</ner> paid a short visit to Mr. <ner>Sayce</ner> and then on donkeys, Nettie and I in a wretched victoria went into the town to find an antiquity merchant, who was not at home. We are near <ner>Tahtah</ner> tonight.

Tuesday, Dec. 31.

40 miles. 	A fine strong wind all the morning brought us at 1:30 to Sohag, where we stopped only for a few moments to get our mail. Tied up this evening a mile below Menshieh? Day cool and fine, Theodore read us this evening Tennyson’s “Ring out Wild Belle” - and v. <ner>Bissing</ner> told us of the German customs pertaining to Sylvester’s Eve.

Wednesday, Jan. 1, 1902.

21 miles. 	A cool bright day. We reached <ner>Girgeh</ner> about 10 o’clock, and saw off in the desert opposite the house of Reisner, and the American flag flying. <ner>Theodore</ner> decided to stop, and make a visit to see how his excavations among the tombs are coming on. He and v. Bissing went over, stayed to lunch and were not home until 3 o’clock, when we went on, and drew up at the ugly high bank at Belliana, at 6:30 where the Axax was lying. A beautiful effect this morning on the <ner>Gebel</ner> <ner>Tourk</ner> just before reaching Girgeh - the mist on the river giving an Alpine effect to its bold outlines.

Thursday evening - Jan. 2.

We are all so tired tonight after our excursion to <ner>Abydos</ner> - I went in my chair, the rest on donkeys - which were very bad as always. Theodore, and v. <ner>Bissing</ner> went over to Petrie’s camp - but the poor little beasts in my chair were not equal to it - and as the sky was threatening we came dragging home at a snail’s pace - we were all safely in the boat before the sharp thunder storm broke, and the rain fell in torrents. I never saw such a storm before in Egypt, -the effects were superb. Two steamers here tonight - Azaz went off early this morning.

Friday evening, Jan. 3.

16 miles. 	We have had a strange day - cold -occasionally rain - no sun - I went on deck about 4:30 - and found it like one of our early cold spring days in the north, - the intense green of the cultivated land along the shore - the unusual smell of rain - and the wet look of everything, was quite like home - we have just had a long and animated talk with v. Bissing on Ruskin, <ner>Grimm</ner> and Thode. How amusing everybody is!

Saturday, Jan. 4.

27 miles. 	Made an early start in order to get through the bridge, thinking it opened at 7:30 - but had to wait until 9 o’clock - got through in fine style and brought up 14 miles below <ner>Keneh</ner> about 7 o’clock.

Second Sunday after Christmas. 	Jan. 5.

34 miles. 	A beautiful warm day - with good wind - passed <ner>Keneh</ner> about noon, where the Zenet el Nil was lying going down - and soon overtook the <ner>Gazelle</ner> and exchanged greetings.

Monday, Jan. 6.

14 miles. 	We are lying within 10 miles of Luxor, and have been slowly moving the whole day.

Tuesday, Jan. 7.

10 miles. 	Luxor. Arrived shortly after noon - and coming slowly past the town, found the Scarab lying above the Castle, and pulled up a little distance ahead of her - against a high bank to be sure, but a sloping one, covered with a sweet green crop of wheat - we have taken 27 days less 3 hours from <ner>Cairo</ner> - last year we took 37 days. Found a big mail waiting for us. Mrs. <ner>Tytus</ner> and <ner>Bob</ner> came to dinner.

Wednesday, Jan. 8.

Such a beautiful day - we started at 10 o’clock - for the other side with <ner>Jones</ner>

and our lunch paraphernalia. Crossed directly to opposite bank, and took the little path straight away through the pleasant fields to <ner>Medinet</ner> <ner>Habou</ner> and presently came to the place of digging on the site of the palace of Amenhotep III where <ner>Bob</ner> <ner>Tytus</ner> under Mr. <ner>Newberry</ner> is excavating the site and near where <ner>Newberry</ner> is excavating the dust and sand mounds for me. Work had only begun on these a few days ago - but a beautiful painted floor in the palace had been uncovered, and many fragments of highly decorated walls - the colour perfectly fresh. I am going to have a tent taken over where we can find shelter and rest, and have luncheon and tea. The desert is beautiful just there - and I feel that I would like to try living there.

Thursday Jan. 9th.

Went into town this morning with <ner>Theodore</ner> on our donkeys, - to the Indian shop

- to the Luxer hotel- and various places. Home in the afternoon - a cold, high wind blowing - Theodore off all day.

Friday, Jan. 10.

A real gale has been blowing all day - cold, the river is rough waves. I have not

been off the boat - and we have had our little stoves going. The Hennass family came to tea - Father, Mother and the two tall girls - also Mr. <ner>Wallis</ner> - and as Mr. <ner>Newberry</ner> was here most of the afternoon we had quite a tea party - and the little saloon seemed very full.

Saturday, Jan. 11.

The morning dawned in lovely fashion - and <ner>Nettie</ner> and I went on deck after

breakfast and said how charming it was to see the placid river once more, and to have no wind - but hardly had we spoken, when with a sudden blast, the wind came cold and strong - however Theodore, <ner>Nettie</ner> and I went out to <ner>Karnac</ner> - where the dust and sand blew in clouds, paid a visit to <ner>Mohassib</ner> and saw some pretty enormously dear things. This is the beginning of <ner>Bieram</ner> - and it was nice to see the people all in their best attire, and the dignified figures walking about in best black robes, with many white draperies. All the crew, headed by the Captain came this morning to give us the usual Beiram greetings. <ner>Nettie</ner> and I stayed at home this afternoon. Theodore at <ner>Der</ner> <ner>el</ner> <ner>Bahari</ner> and brought home <ner>Carter</ner> for dinner. Newberry also here. Our lovely little new moon was seen for the first time tonight. Nettie and I at tea with Mrs. Tytus, Lady <ner>Dunmore</ner> and 2 girls - such typical English Women of a certain kind.

Monday, Jan. 13.

This morning v. <ner>Bissing</ner> went to <ner>El</ner> <ner>Kab</ner> to spend a few days with Mr. Somers-

Clarke. Soon after lunch Theodore, Nettie and I rode over to the palace to see what was going on at the diggings. <ner>Jones</ner> and the tea basket went along. The day was charming and so was the ride.

Tuesday, Jan. 14.

A cold wind today. The Parkers from the dahabeah Sa ‘fa which they have just

bought came this morning to pay us a visit - much interested in our boat, as they are obliged to quite do over theirs next year. <ner>Theodore</ner> and <ner>Nettie</ner> went over to <ner>Medinet</ner> <ner>Habu</ner> and then on to the palace this afternoon - but I would not go in this furious wind. Maspero, on the Miriam, arrived down today.

Wednesday, Jan. 15.

Prof. <ner>Goodwin</ner> and his wife of <ner>Harvard</ner> came to lunch today. Newberry and

<ner>Carter</ner> to dinner, and played bridge all the evening. M. and Mme. <ner>Maspero</ner> made us a long call in the afternoon. Still very cold and high wind, the boat rocking a good deal.

Thursday, Jan. 16.

At home all day - because of the wind. Mlle. de Deak, and Miss Culbord came to tea. The Baron came home this afternoon.

Friday, Jan. 17.

Again the same account. I have never known <ner>Luxor</ner> like this. Every morning the

ther. goes down to 50-52° in my room and we have had no life on deck since we came. Our little stoves in daily use. <ner>Carter</ner> dined with us - always so pleasant - in spite of his dominant personality. His taste for all natural things is so charming to me and how he draws and paints. He is very much absorbed now in trying to bring on the trial of the thief who broke into the tomb, and robbed the body of the great Amenhotep III. The administration of justice is in this country administered in a very funny and desultory fashion. The thief of whose identity everyone is convinced, is at large on bail at the magnificent sum of [symbol] 1 and the film gaffirs, or watchmen who are suspected of complicity, are contentedly reposing in prison having now no work to do, and more to eat than they usually have and although <ner>Carter</ner> has offered [symbol] 100 to anyone who will tell him the truth, the natives stand in such fear of each other that they all swear total ignorance. Carter, who is Inspector of <ner>Upper</ner> <ner>Egypt</ner> has proved himself a most efficient officer - is absolutely fearless - carries no arms - and rides about quite unattended at all hours of the night. Sayce and his friends Mr. <ner>Ward</ner> dined also with us. I think we were all a little tired - for directly after breakfast we had started over to the Tombs of the Kings & I in my chair - in which I have had so comfortable a ride, as both donkeys went so well. It proved to be rather a bad day for the expedition, for the wind grew violent, and as 2 steamers were in port, we had two parties of tourists there - and every available lunch place being in use, <ner>Carter</ner> gave us permission to have our lunch table spread just behind the grille of the tomb now decided I believe to have been that of Ramses IV where in great privacy and comfort we ate it; first, however, going with <ner>Maspero</ner> and <ner>Carter</ner> into the raided Amenhotep III tomb - what a sad change we found! It has not been shown since the robbery, and <ner>M.</ner> <ner>Maspero</ner> was to make his official examination of the body. No one but <ner>Carter</ner> and the head police officer had been in it. On his first visit <ner>Carter</ner> found certain footprints belonging to one pair of feet, which he instantly photographed, and on reaching home found they agreed perfectly with photos he had lately taken of suspected foot prints in another raided tomb - and on an official examination of the suspected man, these photos matched perfectly in lines and size, his feet! We found the coffin of cartonnage had been lifted from the sarcophagus, laid on the floor, and the wrappings ripped from the feet to the head - and in a state of utter ruin - and the mummy which hadhidden on the boat, in a neighboring room, was smashed to pieces and the boat taken away. After a short glimpse of the wall paintings we climbed to the entrance, and to the light of day and fresh air - and then waited until the men had finished their examinatrion. They reported that not the slightest thing of value - no inscription remained. That the king was quite majestio - reminding one of Ramses II - that his hair was brown, and parted in the middle! After lunch, <ner>Maspero</ner> and <ner>Carter</ner> walked about with <ner>Theodore</ner> to fix upon the site of an exploration, which <ner>Theodore</ner> under <ner>Carter</ner> is to make in the <ner>Valley</ner> of the Tombs. The sky was threatening, and we then started for home. On coming out of the valley with its sheltering mountains we found a raging wind, the plain all one cloud of dust and sand, and <ner>Luxer</ner> hardly visible. We came home rapidly - how horrid it was - the shouting men - the galloping donkeys - the wind tearing my wraps off me - my hat hopelessly on the side of my head! Glad we were to get here - and to the ameliorating influences of hot water, brushes, and fresh clothes. The winds still rages.

Saturday, Jan. 18.

<ner>Nettie</ner> and I in doors all day - violent cold wind - stoves going in my room and saloon.

Second Sunday after Epiphany, Jan. 19.

Again cold and windy - I went with <ner>Amelie</ner> to the little church - and heard a short, good sermon from Mr. Sayce. I would have liked my fur cloak. <ner>Newberry</ner> came in the afternoon and stayed to tea. Dr. <ner>Schweinfurt</ner> and the <ner>Bob</ner> <ner>Tytus</ner> - and Mr. <ner>Wallace</ner> came in.

Monday, Jan. 20.

At home writing letters all the morning. Early in the afternoon we crossed and went to the palace - <ner>Theodore</ner> and v. Bissing going first to <ner>Medinet</ner> <ner>Habu</ner> to meet Prof. <ner>Lyon</ner> and his wife. They came to our tent and had tea. For we have a big double tent spread at the edge of the desert, we have a table, chairs, 2 good skeleton lounges with mats and rugs - and a wooden floor. The <ner>Lyons</ner> were delighted, - a most lovely ride home.

(I put a page break here, because I think the diary pages got mixed up)

turning suddenly - vivid lightning. We have been in doors all day.

Tuesday, Nov. 25th.

I have never known a stormier day - and it followed a night of roaring wind. It has rained without ceasing - and no one has been out. Yesterday was clearing, with clear skies, and a bracing Tramon-tana air that was delicious. Theodore, <ner>Bessie</ner> and Mr. <ner>Bigelow</ner> went to Pompeii, and came home enchanted with their visit. Nettie and I drove and shopped and talked, and were happy.

Wednesday, Nov. 26.

We all had a fine drive this morning, and stopped at the Hotel Splendid, one of Bertalini’s hotels to see it. It is splendidly situated, almost on the level of <ner>Capo</ner> di Monte, and <ner>San</ner> <ner>Martino.</ner> It has just been opened - and is very attractive. The <ner>Naples</ner> tram lands you just below the hotel, where a huge lift has been built straight through the rock - and you are carried straight up to the restaurant level, which is at the top of the house. We, however, preferred to drive to the entrance. The third floor of the hotel retreats far enough from the front of the two lower floors to give a very wide esplanade or terrace, running the whole length of the building, and giving the most fascinating view of the whole of that wonderful region - the city below, the sea, the islands and Vesuvius. The hotel is furnished quite in the <ner>Waldorf</ner> <ner>Astoria</ner> style heated by steam - and arranged with many appartments, so that you can have your own sitting room and dining room - bath rooms galore. We did not know the house was opened, or we would have stayed there. Just a little below the hotel, is a piece of property, consisting of a large courtyard, with a charming, rambling little house opening by many long windows to a little verandah on the terrace, and lovely garden terraces below. It is built in a childish, foolish fashion, simulating a ruined tower etc. but there was something attractive about. I wanted to buy at once - it was empty and unfurnished, but in very good order - an English lady having lived in it for 2 years. We all adopted it. <ner>Woodward</ner> and <ner>Bigelow</ner> as well as the rest of us - and call it our Villa del Torre. <ner>Bessie</ner> went off to <ner>Florence</ner> at 3 o’clock - a little sad - and Woodward, Bigelow, Theodore, Nettie and I drove up to the Splendide to dine - in an open carriage in the brilliant moonlight.

Thursday, Nov. 27,

<ner>Brindisi</ner> - Hotel International.

A weary ride from Naples- starting at 12, and arriving at 10 P.M. We find this dismal hotel somewhat improved. The boys came down to the station to see us off, and brought me some flowers. They hope for the tardy arrival of their steamer tonight. Our steamer is due at 3 tomorrow.

<ner>Cairo</ner> - Shepheards - Dec. 1st - Monday.

We have had fearful experiences since my last entry. The Cleopatra of the Austrian <ner>Lloyd</ner> <ner>Line</ner> arrived at <ner>Brindisi</ner> on time, and we were soon off, and found a gale outside waiting for us. It was very cold too. Nettie and I went to bed at once to get warm, - the night was hideously rough. We did not get up until before dinner next evening, when we went to table - but only stayed through 3 courses. Hardly any one at table - the roof leaking - pools of water here and there, dishes smashing - moving about dangerous. We got back to our cabins as soon as possible and into our beds which we did not leave until 6 o’clock this morning, after we had succeeded in getting into harbour. The boat was indescribably dirty - cockroaches crawling over everything - no service - 2 old hags of stewardesses. The last night was really awful - I was quite worn out with trying to keep in bed - and the raging of the storm - the tons of water pouring upon the deck over my head - and the fact that we might not be able to get over the bar at the harbour, drove all sleep and rest away - we did get in however in a lull of the storm but the wind and rain began again as soon as we had landed. We caught the morning train, and arrived at noon - and are once more settled in our old rooms looking on the garden. We found Mrs. <ner>Tytus</ner> and <ner>Bob</ner> here waiting for their boat to be finished - and Mr. <ner>Newberry</ner> came to tea with us - he left this evening for Luxor.

Monday, Dec. 8th.

A busy week here, pushing on our preparations on the boat. It has been cold and rough - almost unprecedented weather it is said. But the good north wind has lately been blowing, and we are anxious to get off while it lasts. Baron v. Bissing is going with us as far as Assiut. We dined at the <ner>Chesireh</ner> last evening and had Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Quibell</ner> and <ner>Bob</ner> <ner>Tytus</ner> with us. Have had tea at the Quibells, in their pleasant quarters. There have been improvements at the Chesireh. They have opened a big chimney in the great hall - and it is not only comfortable but cheerful. Tea with Mrs. <ner>Sandwith.</ner>

Tuesday evening, Dec. 10th. 	Beduin.

We are once more in this dear little home, with its many interests. We had Mrs. <ner>Tytus</ner> and Bob, Mme. <ner>Baltassi</ner> and her daughters to tea. We hope to get off tomorrow. I forgot to enter the strange incident of the fate of the Cleopatra. A few hours after we landed, the Messagrius steamer trying to make a landing in the gale, fell foul of the Cleopatra, and crushed into her broadsides, literally cutting her in half - she sank in a few moments and now lies in the bottom of the harbour. No lives lost.

Wednesday, Dec. 11th.

<ner>Baron</ner> v. Bissing appeared promptly at 10 o’clock having sent his luggage and a box of huge books last evening so that <ner>Jones</ner> had his room quite ready for him. I waned to go to the zoo to see the magnificent lion again, but everything was so sticky with mud from the rain of yesterday, that I decided to stay at home and busy myself with getting in order in my room - About two we started with a very light wind - and made more or less progress. We passed the “Seven Hathor’s” Mr. <ner>Wilburs</ner> old boat, and soon lost sight of her. Then the “Sa ‘fa” flying the English flag - both of which had started out sometime before us. Tied up for the night near <ner>Turah</ner> - making 6 miles.

Thursday, Dec. 12.

14 miles. 	 A Heavy fog on the river this morning and did not get away until after 9 o’clock. The day has been warm and charming - we got on the sand about four o’clock and although worked hard until after 7, we did not get off, until the Sa ‘fa came up to us, and sent her men over to help us - when we were soon free - and both boats tied up for the night. The silver crescent of the new moon appeared tonight. This little home seems more charming than ever - its prettiness - its compactness, its convenience make it delightful. And now the days of repose and pleasant sensible occupation begin!

Friday, Dec. 13.

36 miles. 	Wasta. An encouraging run - we might have gone on for another hour, but that the <ner>Baron</ner> had to stop for his mail. He, Theodore and Nettie, <ner>Jones</ner> and 2 of our men went into the town and were not home until after dark. We will not have our mail until we reach Winieh.

Saturday, Dec. 14.

Still Wasta- a dead calm all day - but warm and pleasant.

Third Sunday in Advent. Dec. 15.

5 miles. 	We have tracked, polled and pulled to an anchor most of the day - with helps from an occasional puff of wind, - clear and warm. We have lost sight of the Seven Hathors and the Sa ‘fa.

Monday, Dec. 16.

10 miles. 	With a light wind and much tracking we have come to within 3 miles of Benisoef.

Tuesday, Dec. 17.

10 miles. 	 The record of yesterday again.

Wednesday, Dec. 18.

23 miles. 	A light wind during the morning, freshening in the afternoon brought us to <ner>Feshn</ner> about two o’clock - where we stopped to get mail for v. <ner>Bissing</ner> and butter and yeast for ourselves. A lovely day - our new little moon makes it quite light enough to sail into the evening.

Thursday, Dec. 19.

53 miles. 	Minieh. We are very proud of our record today. The wind has not been strong but fair and persistent and kept unfalteringly along - the pleasant rippling of the water making music that I love. Sailed until 10 - and after dinner all went up on deck to enjoy the marvellous night. Most pleasantly occupied all day.

Friday Dec. 20.

17 miles. <ner>	Jones</ner> went off to the town today before breakfast and came back with a crammed mailbag - and a very discouraging mass of newspapers - and with the information that the <ner>Istar</ner> is just below us - and that he had gone on board to speak to Mr. Sayce. Soon after Mr. <ner>Sayce</ner> himself appeared, looking very well I thought - with dire tales of having broken his rudder near <ner>Abu</ner> <ner>Girgeh</ner> and having to spend days in getting it repaired. He has Mr. <ner>Ward</ner> the writer on Scarabs and other topics with him - and <ner>Theodore</ner> asked them to come into dinner if they should find themselves near us tonight. But we have sailed them out of sight, and are now lying about 3 miles above <ner>Beni</ner> <ner>Hassan.</ner> The night is incomparably lovely!

Saturday, Dec. 21.

8-1/2 miles. 	Rhodah - with a light wind we have worked hard to reach this place - we did at 6 o’clock - warm and pleasant.

4th Sunday in Advent - Dec. 22.

Rhodah. We are still lying here - there being no wind. We are opposite the town, and at the site of the ancient <ner>Antinopolis</ner> and we walked this morning to its ruins, a short distance away, and saw the columns of Ramses’s II temple, standing deep down in the rubbish. The sun was so hot that after climbing about over the mounds of potshords <ner>Nettie</ner> and I came back to the boat. Theodore and v. <ner>Bissing</ner> kept on.

Monday, Dec. 23.

5 miles. 	Tracked and polled all the morning, and came in view of a damboah, which turned out to be the “Hafiz” with the Christian family, under Salah’s care. We pulled up a little behind them and young <ner>Christian</ner> came over for a few moments this evening. We gave him all our late papers among which was President Roosevelt’s first message to Congress, in which we had been much interested, and sent him on his way rejoicing. Very hot all day.

Tuesday, Dec. 24.

8 miles. 	We had only a breath of wind today, but pulled along until we arrived at <ner>Haji</ner> <ner>Kandil,</ner> where the Christians also stopped - as we intended going to see the pavement of Khaenaten’s Palace. We went across the river at 3:30 - and walked across to the house which <ner>Petrie</ner> has had constructed over this pavement to preserve it. A noisy lot of children and men followed us - and made it very disagreeable. The pavement is not so ruined as I thought it would be, and the graceful designs of birds and flowers, trees etc. so well known from publications, were charmingly interesting - as well as some remains of columns and sculptures characteristic of the period. We stopped on the <ner>Hafiz</ner> for tea - and saw a clean and most amusing little monkey - and well behaved. Nettie and I have been very busy all day, with our Christmas preparations. I has been cooler and overcast today.

Wednesday, Dec. 25.

Christmas.

We made quite a brave show at breakfast this morning with our gifts and decorations - and were very merry. The deck was as usual beautifully trimmed with palm branches, and other greens. Baron v. <ner>Bissing</ner> went across the river soon after lunch, and spent the afternoon prowling about the site of the old city of <ner>Tel</ner> <ner>Aarna</ner> and came home in great glee laden with spoils, - two tor three quite valuable ones. The day has been bright, with cool south wind-- and we have not stirred.

Thursday, Dec. 26.

Such a strong wind we could not start this morning - something peculiar in the weather - very hazy - we have been on the look out for 2 days for <ner>Bob</ner> <ner>Tytus</ner> and his new steamer “The Scarab”. Just as we were finishing lunch <ner>Jones</ner> came in and said the Scarab was just on us. We all jumped up and rushed on deck to give a hearty salute. She pulled up just ahead of us and we went on board. Found Mr. <ner>Newberry</ner> with them. They left <ner>Cairo</ner> Monday afternoon. <ner>Theodore</ner> had seen the boat several times unfitted and was not hopeful of her comfort and appearance; but happily was much blessed. We were all indeed delighted with the comfort and beauty of the interior. Mrs. <ner>Tytus</ner> and <ner>Bob</ner> have shown a very pretty taste in the whole matter. I never saw a prettier interior. After an hour’s visit they went off anxious to reach <ner>Luxor</ner> as soon as possible. Our old Captain <ner>Achmed</ner> of the <ner>Nubia</ner> is their captain. The wind fell about 4 o’clock, and we tracked for a mile.

Tuesday, Jan. 21.

The best day we have had since we came - almost free from wind. The <ner>Lyons</ner> came to lunch - Theodore and v. <ner>Bissing</ner> went after lunch to the palace - and <ner>Nettie</ner> and I had one of our old fashioned teas on deck. Newberry to dinner - and we had such a merry evening! v. Bissing leaves us tomorrow for <ner>Cairo</ner> - and <ner>Nettie</ner> goes with him for a visit to the dentist - having lost the other evening a very important filling from a tooth. She remains only a day in <ner>Cairo</ner> - such a provoking thing!

Wednesday evening - Jan. 22.

A beautiful and busy day at home - until at 5 o’clock <ner>Nettie</ner> and I took a walk along the high path leading back in the pretty country near us. A superb sunset and lovely effects - met Mr. <ner>Wallace</ner> coming home from his walk and we stopped at the Scarab for a little visit. <ner>Nettie</ner> dined there. Nothing more beautiful than <ner>Venus</ner> now and our full moon.

Thursday, Jan. 23.

A cold, but beautiful day - <ner>Nettie</ner> and v. Bissing went to <ner>Cairo</ner> by tonight’s train. <ner>Newberry</ner> came to stay with us.

Friday, Jan. 24.

At home all day - cold wind - <ner>Theodore</ner> went over to the palace this afternoon, and took tea for Prof. <ner>Goodwin</ner> and wife.

Friday, Jan. 25.

An almost calm day - at home this morning. Theodore and I went over to <ner>Sheik</ner> <ner>Abd</ner> <ner>el</ner> <ner>Kurnah</ner> this afternoon to meet <ner>Newberry</ner> - found him with the <ner>Ogden</ner> party at the tomb of Rek-ma-ra. Then we took our tea to Carter’s house, he being away, and had tea on his verandah. It was lovely - and all came home together.

Septuagesima Sunday. 	Jan. 26.

<ner>Nettie</ner> came back from <ner>Cairo</ner> this A.M. having got excellently well done with her dentist, - and had a very pleasant visit with v. <ner>Bissing</ner> and the Quibells. She reports <ner>Cairo</ner> horrid, after a heavy rain, and any one who has been in <ner>Cairo</ner> under these circumstances can testify to its unpleasantness. Mr. <ner>Ogden</ner> and his daughter dined with us.

Monday, Jan. 27.

A very cold night, and a beautiful calm day. Theodore went to the tombs of the <ner>Kings</ner> with Newberry, and met the <ner>Ogden</ner> party there. <ner>Nettie</ner> and I took a frugal lunch and went out to the palace, and spent the day - having our tea basket with us. Mrs. <ner>Tytus</ner> with us. Theo. and <ner>Newberry</ner> joined us for tea - but the later returned to his little Gurneh house.

Tuesday, Jan. 28.

Cold wind again. Mr. <ner>Ogden</ner> and <ner>Livingston</ner> came to call this evening. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Quibell</ner> arrived at the <ner>Grand</ner> <ner>Hotel</ner> this morning and took lunch with us. The <ner>Mureh</ner> family and Miss <ner>Buckanan</ner> and friend of the <ner>Girls’</ner> <ner>Mission</ner> <ner>School</ner> came to tea- and the Insingers to call.

Wednesday, Jan. 29.

<ner>Nettie</ner> and I went into the town - and the Quibells lunched with us - and then <ner>Theodore</ner> took them over to the palace for tea. Cold wind as usual.

Thursday, Jan. 30.

Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Phillips</ner> Schuyler, Mrs. <ner>Frank</ner> <ner>Millet,</ner> Mr. <ner>Carter</ner> and Cadwallader, all on their private steamer “Oonas”, took tea with us and Dr. <ner>Roundtree</ner> dined with us. <ner>Carter</ner> lunched with us.

Friday, Jan. 31.

A lovely warm day. <ner>Nettie</ner> and I went over early to the palace, and spent a quiet day in our tent. Theodore had the Quibells to lunch, and then brought them over to <ner>Der</ner> <ner>el</ner> <ner>Bahari</ner> for tea, where <ner>Nettie</ner> and I joined them.

Saturday, Feb. 1.

A delicious warm day - which <ner>Nettie</ner> and I enjoyed on deck. <ner>Theodore</ner> had the <ner>Schuyler</ner> party to tea at the palace.

Sexigesima Sunday, Feb. 2.

Another lovely day of occupation on deck. <ner>Newberry</ner> lunched with us, and <ner>Theodore</ner> afterwards rode to Karnak.

Monday, Feb. 3.

<ner>Theodore</ner> and I went by appointment this morning to the <ner>American</ner> <ner>Mission</ner> <ner>School</ner> for girls, which was established here this year. We took <ner>Nubia</ner> with us, as I want very much that she should go to this school. It is to be sure almost as if I should take a wild colt out of the fields and expect it to be satisfied and interested. We found a very good native house - new and large. With a really pleasant sitting room belonging to Miss <ner>Buchanan</ner> and her friend, also, who have charge of the school. Miss B. speaking very fluent Arabic asked <ner>Nubia</ner> if she would like to learn to read and write, and she promptly replied that “she wouldn’t”, and showed all her pretty white teeth in a merry smile. She further observed that she thought “those things would do for old ladies”! Then <ner>Miss</ner> <ner>B.</ner> asked “could she sew” - “No, she had never learned” - then, “would she like to learn to sew” “O very much”. (I had already explained to Miss B. what a little savage she was). Then we went all through the school, saw the 5 different class rooms, in which the 130 scholars are distributed - all very neat and most orderly. <ner>Nubia</ner> was much impressed with all this, and when she saw the long, pleasant dining room with its clean matting, its 3 tables, and neat dressers with nice looking dishes, she was delighted. At one of the tables the girls newly entered are put, where they eat in Arab fashion - at the others they are obliged to eat in civilized manner. They all take turn in preparing the tables, and in washing and cleaning the dishes and putting every thing in order afterwards. There are 10 boarders, who occupy 4 rooms - which we saw, - the beds were neat and simple, and good, with little white pillows and pink coverlids. Some of the girls who come from a distance, have their dinners at the school - and this was strong bait for my Nubia. Each morning the girls are marshalled in a row to pass inspection as to their cleanliness - and if they are not up to the mark, they are sent to a wash room to make themselves fit. The morning is occupied with lessons., - the afternoons with sewing and instruction in household duties. The scholars ranged from children of 5 to any age - one of the oldest being a widow with one child. We left <ner>Nubia</ner> with this widow - and she said she would begin her schooling the next morning. We will see. <ner>Theodore</ner> gave the school a nice piece of ground beyond the <ner>Catholic</ner> <ner>Church</ner> for a place for their new school house last year - and we intend giving to the building fund. Then we went to pay a visit to the Murches - where <ner>Theodore</ner> talked affairs with Mr. <ner>Murch.</ner> <ner>Nettie</ner> and the Quibells went over quite early this morning to <ner>Abd</ner> el Kurnah to see the private tombs under <ner>Newberry</ner> and to lunch with him - and <ner>Theodore</ner> and I went across the river at 3:30 with the tea basket to Carter’s house - where the rest joined us - and we all rode home together - the warmest day we have had for weeks.

Tuesday, Feb. 4.

While we were at breakfast the Quibells arrived, with very long faces, saying Mrs. Quibell’s young niece in Cairo, just out from <ner>Scotland</ner> was very ill with dysentery - and that she had to return to <ner>Cairo</ner> that night - and so she cannot go with us to <ner>Aswan</ner> as she intended to her great disappointment. We were all most dismal over it. Then Mrs. <ner>Tytus</ner> came - and we sat chatting on the deck most of the morning, saying how nice it was to have it warm. Then I wrote letters. Mrs. <ner>Tytus</ner> came to tea, and the Quibells - and Mr. Aders, Mr. Newberry’s brother-in-law. Then poor Mrs. <ner>Quibell</ner> said goodbye - and Mr. Q. returned from the station to us, as he is to go with us in her place - he being yet too weak from illness to go to work again - we get off tomorrow if wind is favorable.

Erment - 13 miles.

Wednesday, Feb. 5.

We got away this morning at 9 o’clock with a little breeze, which soon died out, and we have been scrapping along the whole day - and finally pulled to the anchor almost up to Erment. It has been the warmest day of the year - deliciously warm. It is a strange thing that just a year ago today, we left <ner>Luxor</ner> for <ner>Aswan</ner> - and had the same experience - reaching Erment at the same time.

Thursday, Feb. 6.

23-1/2 miles. 	We seem to be matching our record of last year - for tonight we are lying very near to the spot where we were tied last year. A light wind most of the day, increasing in the afternoon.

Friday, Feb. 7.

36 miles. 	We started with quite a good wind at 7 o’clock this morning - and drew up at <ner>El</ner> <ner>Kab</ner> just as we were finishing lunch. Found the Istar here, on her downward journey, as well as Parker’s boat the Sa ‘fa. Mr. <ner>Somers-Clarke</ner> came over at once, bringing some letters for Mr. Quibell, which determined him to leave us and return to <ner>Cairo</ner> the next day. So he went over to stay with Somers-Clarke the night. So sorry to have him go - Mr. <ner>Sayce</ner> also came and made us a visit - and wanted us to stop for tea - but the wind was too good - we are about 3 miles above <ner>Edfou.</ner>

Saturday, Feb. 8.

40 miles. 	We started out about 8 this morning - and soon overtook the Strange Hathor - the Thames ahead of us - day very warm. Passed the Seven Hathors going down - and also the Gazelle - also down. A very good wind - tied up at 6 o’clock - 3 miles above <ner>Kom</ner> <ner>Ombo.</ner> The ruin looked beautiful as we passed.

Sunday - <ner>Quinquagesima</ner> - Feb. 9.

24 miles. <ner>	Aswan</ner> - arrived about 4 o’clock in a piping heat - decidedly the hottest day yet. Came to our mooring place of last year, a little south of Kitchener’s island. Rowed around the island and went to the post office. What a delicious dry air this! and soft and exhilarating - in spite of the heat. Coming home we discerned the faintest little silver thread of a new moon in the warm brilliant sky. Now at 10 p.m. the air is sweetly fresh and cool.

Monday, Feb. 10.

A very, very hot day. I have not been off the boat - and have felt rather done up by the heat. A strong north wind blowing all day. <ner>Frank</ner> <ner>Andrews</ner> of <ner>Newport</ner> came to tea, and was most condescendingly rapturous about the boat. Some other people were here too. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Christian</ner> and the invalid son came to dinner. A right pleasant evening.

Tuesday evening, Feb. 11.

Again at home all day until at 5 - after tea - <ner>Theodore</ner> and I went out in the boat for an hour - lovely among the islands - the new moon making already such a radiance. Spent the afternoon writing letters - not quite so hot as yesterday - but the wind very high.

Ash-Wednesday, Feb. 12.

Not of the boat today. Breakfasted at 8 - and <ner>Theodore</ner> and <ner>Nettie</ner> crossed to the Cataract Hotel, and took one of the sand carriages to the “barrage”. They came home within 3 hours much interested in what they saw. I had writing to do - and would not face the glare and heat. <ner>Henry</ner> <ner>Christian</ner> came again to lunch, and to play chess - and after Mr. and Mrs. Christian, bringing me some flowers. Poor Hassan’s mother came, attended by the old man, and her nephew. We would like to have had the former kicked off the boat; but knew that he would only make it harder for her after. We gave her 3 pounds which is all she will have to live on for 6 months - even if she succeeds in keeping it out of his clutches - and 2 shawls - and tins of biscuit and sweet things, and soap - and everything we could think of - and she had brought us 2 chickens, some dates and eggs. We hated to keep them, but could not decline. Then <ner>Yemmie</ner> appeared from Philae and two or three other natives - and Mrs. <ner>Johnson</ner> and Miss Bruce, Miss Buchanan’s friends, Scoth bodies and very nice too, came to tea - and this evening a letter from <ner>Henry</ner> <ner>Anderson</ner> from Rome, saying his brother <ner>Andreas</ner> had died in <ner>Boston</ner> after a short illness - just on the eve of his marriage with Miss Cushing - it is so sad - and I went to bed quite tired with the day.

Thursday, Feb. 13.

A strong north wind was blowing as usual this morning - and we had quite given up starting, when just after lunch it dropped so much that we started - but had only got opposite the <ner>Grenfell</ner> <ner>Mt.</ner> when we had to tie up to a little sand island just opposite the <ner>Savoy</ner> <ner>Hotel</ner> where we are now lying, with little squalls breaking over us now and then. But the night is so wonderful - the air so warm and perfectly dry, - that we were on deck all the evening, star gazing - the moon so bright, and all the electric lights of <ner>Aswan</ner> making a kind of fairy land.

Friday, Feb. 14.

10 miles.	We got off early at 6 this morning, in perfectly still water - and looking forward to a successful day - but by 10 o’clock all had changed - and the wind grew so strong we had to give it up. Somewhat cooler than yesterday - but hot enough. On deck this evening for a long time. The night so heavenly. It is strange that our journey from Luxor <ner>to</ner> Aswan <ner>of</ner> this year has been so far an exact duplicate of last - dates, progress, etc.

Saturday, Feb. 15.

33 miles. 	We have today broken our record of last year of this date - started this morning at 7 o’clock - the day very hot, with much light north wind. Our men have done well - and brought us at 6:30 to within 3 miles below Sileilis. I have been very little on deck the heat was so intense - The S.S. Scarab passed us about 10 o’clock - they flew by us - and we had only a glimpse of them. The <ner>Hathor</ner> with a powerful tug passed us near <ner>Kom</ner> <ner>Ombo</ner> with <ner>Salah</ner> and a large English party. At 6:30 this evening the thermometer on the cabins stood at 85.

Sunday - 1st in Lent - Feb. 16.

22 miles. 	We are about 2 miles above <ner>Edfou</ner> tonight, and could see the pylons as we pulled up. The day has been very hot - with light north wind all the time.

<ner>El</ner> <ner>Kab.</ner> Monday, Feb. 17.

15-1/2 miles. 	Arrived at 10:30 this morning - a very hot day - the hottest I have ever known on the Nile. The Parkers, Mr. Sayce, and Mr. <ner>Somers-Clarke</ner> called. We went to tea with Mr. <ner>Sayce</ner> and then visited the Parkers on the Sa ‘fa - and Mr. <ner>S.C.</ner> and <ner>Sayce</ner> dined with us - a very pleasant evening - and after dinner we sat on deck without an awning - with no wraps and found the still, dry, warm air delicious - we saw nothing of <ner>El</ner> <ner>Kab</ner> - the day was too hot. Mr. <ner>Sayce</ner> showed us some most interesting little amulets - prehistoric he said - they certainly had the name of Neb-ka- first king of the 3d dynasty.

Tuesday, Feb. 18.

40 miles. 	Very hot again - drew up for the night 3 miles above <ner>Armant</ner> - having passed the Gazelle lying opposite Gebelein. The thermometer this evening at a quarter to 7 o’clock on the cabana stood at 95.

Wednesday, Feb. 19.

Reached <ner>Luxor</ner> at 10:30 A.M. 4 days and a quarter from <ner>Aswan</ner> - counting our stop at <ner>El</ner> <ner>Kab.</ner> <ner>Theodore</ner> went across to Carter’s this afternoon.

Thursday, Feb. 20.

Theodore, <ner>Nettie</ner> and I went across to the Palace this afternoon and took tea. <ner>Newberry</ner> joined us. <ner>Carter</ner> lunched with us and is staying with us.

Friday, Feb. 21.

<ner>Theodore</ner> and I dined this evening with Mrs. Tytus. Mr. <ner>Carter</ner> is still with us. The Crown Prince of <ner>Siam</ner> with his suite arrived in <ner>Luxor</ner> today - and <ner>Carter</ner> is obliged to dance attendance upon him, in his official character.

Saturday, Feb. 22.

Every one else went over to Carter’s house this afternoon to see two mummies Mr. <ner>Newberry</ner> found in one of the tombs he is excavating for Theodore. It was so hot, and the idea of a mummy did not allure me. Mrs. Tytus, Bob, and Mr. <ner>Varley</ner> dined with us. The nights are beautiful with the full moon.

Sunday, 2nd in <ner>Lent.</ner> Feb. 23d.

A very hot strange day - the sun hardly shining and a thick thunderous haze in the air. We began the day with Mr. <ner>Newberry</ner> to breakfast, and he stayed all the morning and to lunch. The rest of the family, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss <ner>Appleby</ner> also lunched with us. Miss Lamb and Mrs. <ner>Goodwin</ner> came to tea - and <ner>Newberry</ner> to dinner - a pleasant evening - but I am very tired.

Monday, Feb. 24.

A day of wind and sand. Did not stir from the boat, though <ner>Theodore</ner> went across to <ner>Carters</ner> to tea.

Tuesday, Feb. 25.

<ner>Theodore</ner> and <ner>Nettie</ner> went across to the Tombs of the Kings, and met <ner>Carter</ner> and <ner>Newberry</ner> and Mr. <ner>Varley</ner> for lunch, and to open the tomb Mr. Carter’s workmen have been busy with for some days which he is opening for Theodore. A great deal had been expected of this tomb. But it was found to be quite full of water - and the beautiful coffin had quite mouldered, as well as the mummy. Fragments of very fine alabaster canopic jars and other things with fine hieroglyphs and one strange black scarab of good size. For the first time the new electric light was turned on the tomb of Sety - and revealed undreamed of effects and beauties. Miss <ner>Buchanan</ner> and Miss Bell came to tea with me by appointment and I had a very interesting visit - discussing with them about Nubin, their school and its work and objects.

Wednesday, Feb. 26.

Had a charming ride to the <ner>Palace</ner> where we had tea with <ner>Newberry</ner> - thence to <ner>Medinet</ner> <ner>Habu</ner> and home across the lovely barley fields - now in full head.

Thursday, Feb. 27.

A very warm morning - <ner>Nettie</ner> and I went over to the Istar to see Mr. <ner>Sayce</ner> - who is a prisoner with a bad foot. He fell down the shaft of one of his 12 dynasty tombs at El Kab the other day, and is now in the doctor’s hands. Then we stopped at the Scarab to see Mrs. Tytus. The wind was strong and air delicous as we rowed up the river again - but as we left the Scarab, it had increased almost to a hurricane , and looking back to where the <ner>Istar</ner> is lying opposite Luxor, with the Strange <ner>Hathor</ner> and the steamer Oonas with the Schuylers on board, we saw them smothered in dust and sand - and soon after we got home, the Oonas came up the river and stopped just in front of us, at 4 o’clock this afternoon we went across to have tea with <ner>Carter</ner> - such a pleasant visit - <ner>Newberry</ner> was there - we had tea as usual on the terrace and the young donkey <ner>San</ner> <ner>Toy</ner> was roaming about the compound - and much interested in us. <ner>Carter</ner> showed us some of his beautiful drawings before we left. It was past 6 o’clock when we reached home, and Miss <ner>Buchanan</ner> was here - and we settled about <ner>Nubia</ner> - who after 3 weeks now at school shows such aptitude and cleverness that she is to live there. As her father and mother are dead, and she has only a precarious home with a married sister, I do not hesitate about this - and the girl herself seems delighted.

Friday, Feb. 28.

We were to go to the Murches to tea this afternoon, but there was such a gale blowing that we gave it up, and sent excuses. Mrs. <ner>Tytus</ner> and <ner>Bob</ner> were here to tea. Mr. <ner>Carter</ner> and <ner>Newberry</ner> here to dinner. Mr. <ner>Schuyler</ner> called. <ner>Carter</ner> stayed all night.

Saturday, March 1st.

We expected to start down this morning but the north wind began howling again and has not stopped. All the charitable retainers were on hand this morning - donkey boys - Saleel - blind man -- <ner>Nubia</ner> etc. I sent for <ner>Nubia</ner> to come on deck and gave her breakfast there. Our awnings are all down - everything ready and waiting for wind to drop - <ner>Carter</ner> went off to <ner>Aswan</ner> to inspect one of Lady Wm. Cecil’s tombs. <ner>Newberry</ner> came to lunch. <ner>Bob</ner> and Mrs. <ner>Tytus</ner> to say again goodbye! A quiet evening - and a nice one!

2n Sunday in Lent. March 2.

At 7 o’clock this morning when I heard the men beginning to make ready to start, I drew my curtain aside, I found <ner>Nubia</ner> sitting on the bank and in a few moments Achmed, and Said, the black dog, and all waiting sadly to see us off. The river was a mirror, but we had hardly passed the town when a light wind from the north came, and then grew stronger, in the face of which we have rowed and floated all day and are lying below <ner>Magadah</ner> about 2 miles - having made 24 miles. I was sorry to leave the splendid <ner>Theban</ner> <ner>Mountains</ner> and when at 6 o’clock I looked at them this morning, they were lovely indeed - all rose-coloured - the reflection extending almost across the river. The <ner>Istar</ner> left just before us, and we have been quite close all day - she is lying just behind us.

Monday, Mar. 3d.

24 miles. 	The weather has been a repetition of yesterday - the distance also - the same delicious cool air and hot sun, - the mountains with their etherially lovely heliotrope tints. Spoke to Mr. <ner>Sayce</ner> as we happened to float near the Istar. He is quite well again - and stopped at <ner>Keneh</ner> - we did not, and are now about 4 miles below it.

Tuesday, Mar. 4. <ner>Nagh</ner> <ner>Hamadi.</ner>

34 miles. 	Started at 6:30 A.M. passed <ner>Dishua</ner> about 11 - day hot - light north wind until 12 - when we had a little from the south - reached <ner>Nagh</ner> <ner>Hamadi</ner> as usual too late to catch the bridge open - just what we did last year. Are tied up to a very high villainously high bank - with the little dahabeah “Memphis” just in front of us - and later a gentleman and lady came to call, sending in cards of Lt. Col. Biddulph, Royal Field Artillery, and Mrs. <ner>Biddulph</ner> and we found them very pleasant. He is invalided from <ner>South</ner> <ner>Africa.</ner>

Wednesday, Mar. 5.

16 miles. 	We got through the bridge at 8:30 this A.M. just after the <ner>Memphis</ner> - and have been fighting our way along with an almost constant head wind - day fine - are about 2 miles above <ner>Balliana.</ner>

Thursday, Mar. 6.

9 miles. 	The north wind was howling this morning but at 6 o’clock we started, and after battling for an hour with it, we pulled up about half a mile from the place we had started from - so we gave it up as a bad job - started a washing, and turned out our fowls. At 3 o’clock we started again, passed <ner>Balliana</ner> where the Rameses III was lying, with all her tourists just back from a hot ride to <ner>Abydos</ner> - at 7 o’clock we pulled up to a high bank, with the lights of <ner>Girga</ner> in the distance, where we intend to stop tomorrow - high wind and water making a great noise.

Friday, Mar. 7.

2 miles. 	With much difficulty we managed to pull past <ner>Girga</ner> opposite to the <ner>Reisner</ner> camp about noon. We sent a man across with a note asking Mr. and Mrs. Reisner, Mr. <ner>Mace</ner> and Mr. <ner>Lithcoe</ner> to dine with us this evening - and <ner>Theodore</ner> and <ner>Nettie</ner> at 4 o’clock braved the hot sun and the high wind, and went over and had tea with them. The Quibells are now there, and in a camp of their own, and quite a little collection of tents showed on the shelving desert, with the great cliffs behind. They came back late, bringing the guests with them. Reisner’s work this winter has been very interesting - he is making it for Mrs. <ner>Hearst</ner> of <ner>California</ner> and has unlimited money for it. Tombs of the 5-6 and 12th dynasties and an archaic cemetery which <ner>Theodore</ner> said was most interesting. <ner>Mace</ner> and <ner>Lithcoe</ner> are the real explorers - and are considered most intelligent - the latter is an American, from <ner>Providence</ner> - Nettie reported the <ner>Reisner</ner> house intolerably hot, and crammed with flies - and gave a dismal picture of it.

Saturday, Mar. 8.

8 miles. 	Started early - but not too early for the n. wind - against which we struggled all the day - tying up just opposite the cliffs at the northern end of <ner>Gebel</ner> et Toukh - with the lights of Menshieh visible - very hot - especially this afternoon and evening.

Sunday - 4th in Lent - Mar. 9.

38 miles. 	Started early - and have had no wind or very light wind all day. Stopped at <ner>Sohag</ner> - 11 A.M. - very hot - are lying at northern end of <ner>Gebel</ner> el Herfdi.

Monday, Mar. 10.

We are lying just where we stopped last night. The wind raged all night - and all today - now quiet - today has been comfortably cool with a delicious soft air.

Tuesday, Mar. 11.

33 miles. 	A very good run against a light north wind all day. Our new moon appeared - such a lovely little thread of silver crescent - in the orange yellow sky.

Wednesday, Mar. 12.

10 miles. When I wakened this morning, I found we were sailing finally and would soon reach Asiut - I had two letters I wanted to write, but had only time to write in bed to Mr. Newberry, about the money for his publications. We stopped for mail, and then started at 10, hoping to get through the canal - but the wind was so strong we could only float down to a sand bank near it where we are now lying. The wind has been howling and dust flying all day. Loads of letters and papers.

Thursday, Mar. 13.

We got through the canal this morning at 6 o’clock - I saw it very well from my windows and <ner>Theodore</ner> from the salon. Nettie dressed and went on deck - it is a stupendous piece of work - this great granite Weir, which stretches across the river. We came to a low sand bank in the middle of the river just below the Weir, and have stayed here all day - the wind too high to move.

Friday, Mar. 14.

5 miles. 	We made our few miles by starting out too early for the north wind. As we were trying to get about one of the great turns of the river here, the Scarab passed us. It was too early to see any one, as we were all in bed, and I fancy they were. We have had a great change of temperature - and it is really cold.

Saturday, Mar. 15.

17 miles. 	We made these by starting at 4 o’clock but were laid up by the wind at a bank near the town of Hawatkah, 4 miles from Manfalout. Since then the wind has raged, and is still roaring and whistling. S.S. “Rameses the Great” and “Tewfih” passed down - and the dahabeah “Hope”, german flag, with a tug.

Sunday, Mar. 16.

5th Sunday in <ner>Lent.</ner>

We had a great gale last night, and today has been really cold with not a gleam of sunlight since early morning. Started at 6 - and made about 3 miles - then stopped and waited for the wind to fall - started again after some hours, and have come just one more mile making in all 4 miles. It has been threatening rain all day, and some drops did fall this afternoon - but the sky is very overcast this evening.

Monday, Mar. 17th.

35-1/2 miles. 	Our best day - got away early from the landing near <ner>Manfalout</ner> - and rowing and sailing brought up here at <ner>Mellawie</ner> at 7 o’clock. The wind came lightly from the south this afternoon - got past the <ner>Gebel</ner> <ner>Abu-Feda</ner> by 11 o’clock, in fortunately quiet weather. Came across the “Sa’fa” hard and fast upon the sand at one o’clock - dropped anchor and sent our men across to help them, and in less than an hour they were off. The day has been a great contrast to yesterday - very Khamseeny- very hot - the sky overclouded. From 5 o’clock after we had had our tea on deck, until we tied up, it was something especially lovely. No sun, and that subdued stillness that seems to belong to such a condition, - almost a feeling of rain in the air - the mild breeze carried us smoothly and mysteriously along, the flocks and herds all coming down to the river for their last drink, the little kids and lambs now so plentiful, crying out like babies - “and all the land had rest”. It was a heavenly evening. <ner>Theodore</ner> has sent a man across the fields to the R.R. station, with a telegram for Mrs. <ner>Quibell</ner> at Girga, asking her to join us at Minia, day after tomorrow.

Tuesday, Mar. 18th.

12 miles. 	The north wind got up before we did this morning, and we worked hard to make out 6 miles to Rhodah, then we lingered until this afternoon when we made 6 miles more, are we think within 4-5 miles from <ner>Beni</ner> <ner>Hassan.</ner> A cool day - and not clear.

Wednesday, Mar. 19th.

11 miles. 	From 6 o’clock until 9:30 we had 3 hours and a half of good rowing - since then the wind has been blowing “like the debbil” as <ner>Salah</ner> says. Passed <ner>Beni</ner> <ner>Hassan</ner> late this P.M.

Thursday, Mar. 20.

7-1/2 miles. 	Made our few miles before 9:30 - when the north wind fell suddenly upon us, and has raged ever since. We are within a mile of Minia, and sent the Dervish in the town for our mail and with a note for Mrs. Quibell, hoping she was waiting there; but a letter from her stated she had gone back to Cairo, but would join us at <ner>Benisoof.</ner>

Friday, Mar. 21st.

24 miles. 	Came along splendidly in quiet weather until 12:30 when we were forced to the bank by the n. wind, where we are now lying. A heavenly day - and such cloudless nights with a moon nearly full - what beauty these Egyptian nights have!

Saturday, Mar. 22,

28 miles. 	A very good record for such a day of continued n. wind. We have not once tied up, but have floated between rowing with the plank out and are now lying at Maghagah. We passed 5-6 miles from here one of the Cooks postal boats, Amenartis, hard upon the sand with many gyassas about her, filled with her cargoe. Soon after, she got off. The Anglo-American steamer has pulled in ahead of us - the last big steamer on the river, I think. The afternoon had such strange, unrivalled beauty. We passed the town of Sharona, with such splendid palms - and pleasant looking houses - and find fields - such evening light on the great bald cliffs beyond the valley - and the full moon in the heavens above.

Sunday before Easter: 	Mar. 23.

23 miles. 	The usual history of the day - battling with the wind - but it fell with the sunset, and the moon being at the full, we rowed until 9 o’clock and pulled up opposite Bibeh. The river has been very difficult - enormous sand banks, about and around which we had to take our uncertain way. But the effects wonderful.

Monday, Mar. 24.

22 miles. 	We reached <ner>Benisoef</ner> at 1 o’clock - in a towering heat - everything still and burning - we pulled up and sent <ner>Jones</ner> and a sailor in the town for Mrs. <ner>Quibell</ner> and in about an hour they arrived. We were so glad to have her at last. Passed two steamers on the sand - river very difficult - spent all day on deck, in spite of the heat.

Tuesday, Mar. 25.

41 miles. 	Got to <ner>Wasta</ner> about 8 o’clock - a light south wind. Got our mail, and were off again directly. The day has been exciting - on deck all the time - sailing so difficult - passed the <ner>Ramses</ner> on the sand, just after she has passed us - and not long after we went on ourselves, where we stayed for more than an hour, our men working like Trojans. Had it not been for this detention, we might have made <ner>Gizeh</ner> tonight - very hot and <ner>Kamseeny</ner> all day.

Wednesday, March 26.

It has blown a great gale all day and we have not moved, except to work across the river to a more sheltered place. I have been quite under the weather all day.

Thursday, Mar. 27:

21 miles. 	The wind fell during the early part of the night, and the moon being bright the men began rowing at 2 o’clock and before we went to breakfast old <ner>Cairo</ner> could be seen. Then a strong west wind held us to a bank and the men pulled to an anchor, and then rowed again, until they brought us to the Museum landing at our usual place at 12 o’clock - just 3 months and 2 weeks from the time we left it. <ner>Theodore</ner> and <ner>Nettie</ner> went up with Mrs. <ner>Quibell</ner> to have tea with her, and then walked in the Zoo, which they said was quite lovely - so many flowers. Baron v. Bissing came in and had tea with me on deck.

Friday, Mar. 28.

Good Friday. A lovely morning - we drove into town, stopped at <ner>Shepheards</ner> - saw <ner>Bob</ner> <ner>Tytus</ner> for a moment and some other people we knew on the Terrace, then I went to church and joined the others later and came home. <ner>V.</ner> <ner>Bissing</ner> to lunch, <ner>Newberry</ner> came in after - and when they had gone <ner>Nettie</ner> and I went for a drive - and then had such a pleasant tea by ourselves on deck.

Saturday, Mar. 29.

The day has been heavenly beautiful - <ner>Theodore</ner> and I drove into town to Cooks, and went to say goodbye to Mrs. <ner>Tytus</ner> who goes tomorrow. Thence to Kytikas’ and saw some valuable gold coins and various antiques, - then home, and hurried dressing and all went to the Quibells to lunch - which was most pleasant - <ner>Nettie</ner> sang afterwards in that big hall, and it was ravishing - she and <ner>Theodore</ner> then drove into town, and I had a quiet tea by myself.

Tuesday, April 1st.

This is our last evening on the dear, comfortable Beduin this year. For tomorrow we move over to the Ghezireh Palace Hotel to stay until we go away - it has been a busy day. Night before last we had Quibell and Miss <ner>Thompson</ner> and v. Bissing to dine - the latter spent the night here, and soon after breakfast young <ner>Weigall</ner> came in. We had never met him before - and were so well pleased with the young Englishman - v. Bissing, Weigall and I then with <ner>Nettie</ner> went over to the Zoo, ah- it was lovely and fresh. After lunch which the two fellows took with us, they went out to the Pyramids, returning for tea. Newberry came to tea, bringing me some lovely roses. He stayed to dine and spend the night, and Mrs. <ner>Quibell</ner> and Miss <ner>Pirie</ner> came also to dine. This morning, Newberry, <ner>Nettie</ner> and I went into town to do some little shoppings at the Bazaar. Met Mr. and Mrs. Newman, just down from Aswan, and they came to tea, and were very pleasant. We have addressed ourselves for 2 days as often as we could, to packing arranging - weather warm, with very high winds, and dust everywhere.

Wednesday, April 2d.

A very busy fatiguing morning of packing. We went in to Mrs. Quibell’s at 4

o’clock by appointment for tea - and to meet some people and have some music. There were several musical people there. <ner>Nettie</ner> sang divinely. Then we came here to the Ghezireh Hotel, where we are established in the big, pleasant rooms overlooking the garden, which we had years ago, when <ner>Mary</ner> and <ner>Clarence</ner> were with us. The house is much improved, and gardens in beautiful order. <ner>Newberry</ner> and <ner>Bob</ner> <ner>Tytus</ner> came to dinner - <ner>Carter</ner> was also dining here with <ner>Lady</ner> <ner>William</ner> <ner>Cecil.</ner>

Thursday, April 3d.

<ner>Theodore</ner> and I drove into town and to the boat and to the Museum

this morning - everything at the boat getting into covers and closets, and all kinds of packing. Mr. and Mrs. <ner>Newman</ner> are at Shepheards, going off to <ner>Florence</ner> tomorrow. <ner>Carter</ner> dined with us. <ner>Newberry</ner> and Tytus came to say goodbye.

Friday, April 4th.

In town again this afternoon - looking at carpets and antiques then home in time to dress for dinner, with tea before that on our big balcony - with the grey and black crows occasionally swooping down for biscuit and cakes - young <ner>Weigall</ner> dined with us - and was so nice and amusing. A lot of English people in the hotel whom we know.

Saturday, April 5.

A farewell visit to the boat today - and to the Quibells. v. Bissing came to dine and stayed late. This morning we went with him to see the new Museum - which looks like a good station more than a Museum - a hideous failure. Mr. <ner>Sayce</ner> lunched with us.

Sunday, April 6th.

A very busy day - a most delicious cool air. We lunched with the charming Mrs. <ner>Goff</ner> - who among others, also had <ner>Carter</ner> - who poor man goes back to <ner>Luxor</ner> tomorrow for his lonely summer. Dr. and Mrs. <ner>Sandwith</ner> dined with us and a charming evening. Ready for our departure tomorrow.

2d Sunday after Easter.

April 13. <ner>Bologna.</ner> <ner>Hotel</ner> <ner>Brun.</ner>

Just a week ago since we quitted Egypt. Laden with flowers, we left the

<ner>Ghizereh</ner> <ner>Palace</ner> early Monday morning - and found <ner>Reis</ner> Fuli, Matter, the Dervish, Abdul, and many others waiting for us at the station. V. Bissing, Weigall, and <ner>Carter</ner> also came - and Mr. <ner>Bachler</ner> - reached <ner>Port</ner> <ner>Said</ner> at 6:30 P.M. and rowed out to the P. & O. SS. Isis, looking so pretty and trim - not many passengers - most of them arriving on the “India” from <ner>Australia</ner> at midnight, for whose mail we waited. The first day and night were quite perfect - good weather and smooth seas - and we went to bed quite hoping that these unusual conditions would prevail the next day, through the <ner>Aegean</ner> <ner>Sea</ner> and islands - but at 7 o’clock we encountered a fearful storm, and the last 24 hours were diabolical. I have never known anything like it since many years ago we crossed from <ner>Alexandria</ner> to Constantinople! Reached <ner>Brindisi</ner> Thursday 6 <ner>A.M.</ner> and found the <ner>London</ner> through train de luxe waiting at the landing - and we soon were in the admirable sleeping car, with dining room attached. We had a double and a single compartment to ourselves and were most comfortable. From Faggie on, the route was unfamiliar to us - and all the way to Ancona, it was by the sea shore, -- the day was fine, delicious air, fragrant with apple and pear blossoms - the sea, liquid turquoise - and the hoary, old battlemented towns on their heights, with their towns, cathedrals, castles - the picturesque little fishing villages - the wide desolate plains - the richly cultivated fields - the roadsides brilliant with flowers of every colour, with poppies predominating - and towards the later afternoon, the snow covered peaks of the <ner>Abruggi</ner> <ner>Mountains</ner> showing - and the fishing fleets coming home - with their orange, red, cinnamon coloured, sails so diversely painted, that they had the air of huge butterflies resting on the water - all made a scene of ravishing beauty, that one is thankful to remember. We reached <ner>Bologna</ner> at midnight, and are established in the familiar rooms of this fine old hotel, where we have been twice before. It is and has been dull and rainy since we arrived - not a glint of sunlight. Each day has been busy - on Friday we went to the Academia, and stayed the morning - saw two lovely Francias, the incomparable [illegible] (Madonna enthroned) Raphael’s St. Cecilia, which one seems to care for less and less - the more one sees it - a fine Loppe. There are really few things of paramount worth in this gallery. In the afternoon it rained, and we all stayed indoors. Saturday, yesterday we went to <ner>S.</ner> <ner>Petronio</ner> - interesting but disappointing. The most interesting thing to me, were the 4 rude stone crosses, supposed to have been erected by Petronius, Bishop of Bologna, near the old gates in the V Century. The best were the sculptures outside the church, which we could not well see, because of the rain and wet - a beautiful Francia in one of the chapels. Then to the church of S. Dominico - which contains the body of the saint who died here - a sarcophagus or “area” by <ner>Nicola</ner> <ner>Pisano</ner> and pupils - beautiful in detail but clumsy in effect architecturally. Two or three good figures standing on it - and 2 angels holding candlesticks, the one to the left quite lovely by <ner>Nicola</ner> <ner>dell’Area</ner> - the angel on the right and the S. Petronius with the church in his hand are said to have been by Michaelangelo. In the vestibule a monument of Tartagni, jurist, by <ner>Francesco</ner> di Simone. The Piazzo outside called Galileo, is very pretty and picturesque - with two columns bearing statues of <ner>S.</ner> <ner>Dominico</ner> and the Madonna, and two important monuments of the XIII Cent. on columns, - the one belonging to the family Fascherari is very interesting because of an elegant work of the VIII C. an arc of a ciborium applied to the tomb - a rich archivolt with foliage, in the corners 2 peacocks in rather coarse work. <ner>Cattaneo</ner> pronounces this to be “veritable and pure remains of the antique. Then to the church of <ner>S.</ner> <ner>Giacomo</ner> Maggiere, where in the <ner>Capella</ner> <ner>Bentivoglie</ner> is one of the finest paintings of <ner>Francia</ner> - <ner>Madonna</ner> with saints - the child almost the same as the one in Theodore’s pictures - and the <ner>Madonna</ner> very like - lovely - outside the chapel, the monument of <ner>Antonio</ner> <ner>Dontiveglio</ner> by <ner>Jacopa</ner> <ner>della</ner> <ner>Quercia</ner> - with beautiful figures of the virtues - the Oratory of <ner>S.</ner> <ner>Cecilia</ner> with frescoes by Francia, Costa, Aspertini - those of Francia quite lovely. After lunch we went to the Museu Civioco, where we were intensely interested in the Etruscan and Egyptian remains - and the exquisite “Head” supposed to be a copy from the bronze original of <ner>Pheidias</ner> - stopped on coming home at a shop near here and bought some beautiful embroideries on linen, native Bolognese work - and also visited San Vitale, or the “Seven Churches” most interesting - but gloomy, and cold. This morning I went for a drive to a Villa Revedin, belonging to a <ner>Ferrara</ner> family of that name - very high with fine views of the town, and the level, flat plain beyond. The grounds were pretty with some fine trees - and some wonderful Wistaria vines coming into flower - a large pergola, walls, terraces covered with them - a great terrace in front of the house - which must be charming - then to the Park - which was not good. Today has been a local festa day - with banners flying - and crowds filling the streets, and a fine procession bearing a <ner>Madonna</ner> from one church to another. Italian religious functions possess such incongruities and I always wonder if they are not apparent to the populace and priests. We go to <ner>Florence</ner> tomorrow.

Tuesday, April 14. 	Florence.

<ner>Grande</ner> <ner>Bretagne</ner> <ner>Hotel.</ner>

We arrived last evening at 7 o’clock - being an hour late. A very pleasant day’s journey, though there were some unpropitius moments at the railway station, when we found in all the hurry and crowd that a lot of noisy Germans had appropriated our reserved compartment - great vociferation and indignation on the part of the Capodi Stagieni, when he discovered it; but it did not avail to dislodge the rude intruders - so the train was held, until a fresh car could be brought up, which was fresh, clean and convenient and which we had entirely to ourselves. Found <ner>Bessie</ner> and <ner>Mary</ner> waiting at the station. This morning we spent at the <ner>Uffissi</ner> - and afternoon at the Constantini’s and at tea at Lizzie’s. Delighted to have a visit today from <ner>Pheobe</ner> <ner>Clark</ner> and her husband - they have come over for a stay of 6 months for a rest for him; who looks poorly. <ner>Constantini</ner> dined this evening with us.

Thursday, April 24th.

We go tomorrow to Venice- and will take <ner>Mary</ner> with us, and then to <ner>Paris</ner> - we have had a charming stay here. The weather has been beautiful, and I have been perfectly well - delightful combination indeed! We have seen the beautiful pictures, marbles and statuary and churches, seen all our friends - made many visits - received many. Last Sunday we drove up to “I Tatti” to lunch with the <ner>Berensons</ner> in their charming villa - two pleasant Englishmen also to lunch. The old house with its corridors, stately rooms, pretty courts and gardens and the little chapel is entirely interesting and charming - and the whole world of <ner>Florence</ner> is seen below it. This morning <ner>Nettie</ner> went about with me for half an hour, and then we drove, in spite of threatening clouds, to <ner>San</ner> <ner>Miaiato.</ner> We had it quite to ourselves - and after coming out of the church, we hung over the parapet of coarse and looked at <ner>Florence</ner> as she winds her lovely length through the plain - and at the great shadows of the clouds on the mountains. The young <ner>Countess</ner> <ner>Gigala</ner> and her brother <ner>Enrico</ner> came to lunch. Theodore and I started for a drive at 3 o’clock but such a sudden and heavy storm came up we stopped at Lizzie’s and had tea, and finally drove home in the rain.

Saturday, April 26.

We had a charming and not at all tiring ride from <ner>Florence</ner> yesterday - and I was so pleased to see again the rich, level lands of Venetia - with their slender minarets, and ancient cities - and to have sight again of the lagoons, and opalescent waters, and the city of all others, rising from them, with the setting sun burnishing its towers and buildings. We are in the same princely apartment of two years ago, and we found <ner>Phoebe</ner> and Dr. <ner>Clarke</ner> here. This morning we went to <ner>S.</ner> <ner>Francesco</ner> to see the <ner>Negroponte</ner> beautiful Madonna, and to <ner>S.</ner> <ner>Maria</ner> Formosa, to see especially a painting in the sacristy of a <ner>Madonna</ner> and Child by <ner>Pietro</ner> <ner>da</ner> <ner>Messina</ner> - the artist by whom was painted a very charming <ner>Madonna</ner> <ner>Theodore</ner> bought in Florence. It was very like - and was a signed picture. Then we went to the great <ner>Giovanni</ner> o <ner>Paola</ner> <ner>Church</ner> - and looked at its monuments and pictures and studied its effects - and home for lunch. In the afternoon <ner>Theodore</ner> and I went to Berozzo’s and after we met the girls, and <ner>Phoebe</ner> and Dr. <ner>Clarke</ner> in the piazza and had tea - and the rain came down, and we had to go inside the cafe. Then we brought up at Orcania’s the publishers, and quite late, dodged the showers and got home. This morning we went to Berozzi’s atelier and saw some lovely frames, and a casom - which Theodore bought. The rest of the morning we spent at the Academia. This afternoon we went to see the Benson’s - and found them as usual - such a sufferer and cripple as she is! and so cheerful and interesting! <ner>Phoebe</ner> and Dr. <ner>Clarke</ner> came in the evening - and we have arranged to take them out in a steam launch tomorrow to Torcello.

April 27 - Sunday.

It has been a day of constant wind and rain - <ner>Theodore</ner> is the only one who has been out - A gondola in the wind was impossible. We have not only lost a day, but our chance of seeing Torcello-- and Dr. <ner>Clarke</ner> and <ner>Phoebe</ner> wisely decided to go over to Milan, in order to have more time there.

Monday, April 28th.

A very busy day - with churches, pictures etc. A large part of the morning at the Frari - <ner>Bessie</ner> and I brought up at <ner>St.</ner> <ner>Marks</ner> at 4:30 - after having had tea on the Piazza; the church was glorious, a little too late to see all the details, but the effect wonderful - for all the dim harmony of colour of the church leads up to the splendour of the high altar, where the Pala d’Oro was shining - like a rich high light. That church is a great marvel - a dim, mysterious, encrusted jewel - there is nothing like it in all the world.

Thursday, April 29th.

Another busy day - with the delights of <ner>Venice</ner> <ner>-</ner> <ner>Theodore</ner> has bought a really beautiful statue of the <ner>Madonna</ner> and Child - except for the difference of material and size it reminds one of the old French ivory statuettes - the leaning Virgin and child. It came from a suppressed convent in <ner>Verona</ner> - and is claimed to be by one of Pisanos. He has also bought some lovely frames and a cassone from <ner>Bereggi.</ner>

Friday, April 30th.

Left <ner>Venice</ner> this morning, 2 P.M. most reluctantly, and arrived here at <ner>Verona,</ner> <ner>Hotel</ner> <ner>de</ner> <ner>Londres,</ner> at 5:30. Our hotel is comfortable enough - not cheerful - and very frigid. The town looks tremendously interesting - <ner>Mary</ner> and I walked a short distance from here and found the Scaliger tombs - the great square of Signoria, the ancient palace of the Padesta - many curious and ancient forms of architecture and home by the busy and quaint <ner>Piazza</ner> d’Erhe, now a market.

Friday, May 2.

We are off for <ner>Milan</ner> this afternoon - have found <ner>Verona</ner> delightfully interesting. Spent yesterday at the Gallery, where there are some good things - and then went to the great old church of S. Zeno, about which I had read and know from photographs - wonderful bronze doors - carvings - grand effects - mediaeval features. Mantegna’s great enthroned <ner>Madonna</ner> and Saints - which <ner>Napoleon</ner> kindly conveyed to Paris, but which was returned afterwards to Italy. After lunch, to the Duomo - Baptistry - wonderful Roman pavement, discovered under the cloister and then for a fine drive into the country - with all <ner>Verona</ner> and its surroundings - and the splendid sweep of blue, blue mountains with the <ner>Tyrolean</ner> <ner>Alps</ner> covered with snow.

Rogation Sunday - May 4 - Hotel Cavour - Milan.

A charming ride from <ner>Verona</ner> on Friday - with the chain of the snow covered <ner>Alps</ner> with us all the way - arrived at 7:30 - found our old rooms in readiness - fire - dinner table all ready, with its shining silver, and spotless linen. This is certainly the best and most comfortable hotel in Europe! We spent all day yesterday in stony galleries - the morning at the <ner>Brera</ner> which is undergoing great changes and improvements; the afternoon at the <ner>Museo</ner> <ner>Lapidario</ner> in the old Castle - the home of the Viscontis and Sforzas - enormously interesting - I saw for the first time the beautiful monument of <ner>Caston</ner> <ner>de</ner> <ner>Foix</ner> - and so many charming and interesting sculptures - afterwards we had a drive. Mr. <ner>Sayce</ner> who came here the same day we did, called soon after breakfast - and came to dine. This morning it rained and was cold, and I stayed at home, with Mary, who is not very well. Mr. <ner>Sayce</ner> came in to say goodbye - and sat some time - we started soon after for London. <ner>Marie</ner> <ner>Gwynne</ner> came to lunch - and went out with <ner>Theodore</ner> and <ner>Bessie</ner> to see <ner>S.</ner> <ner>Eustorgio</ner> and S. Lorenzo. It has poured with rain this afternoon. Tomorrow we go over to Lucerno.

Hotel National - Lucerno - May 6.

We had the most beautiful day yesterday - most of the morning at the <ner>Poldo-Pezzoli</ner> - left <ner>Milan</ner> at 12:30 in 2 comfortable compartments. The afternoon was warm, even hot - and we were glad to get into the shade of the big <ner>St.</ner> <ner>Gotthard</ner> tunnel. What was our astonishment to find on emerging from it, the snow falling fast and continuously. We drew up at the station of Gösechnen, and had some of their excellent coffee, which was handed into the windows to us - then began such a beautiful sight - the mountains, trees, ground, every blade and branch laden with snow - making a delightful fairy land - the great fires climbing up the steep mountain sides, with their pointed white tops looked positively eerie. The snow changed to rain as we reached the valley level - but a wonderful sunset promised a fine morrow which promise sadly was not fulfilled - for it has rained most of the day - and has been very cold. No one but <ner>Theodore</ner> went out -and no views of the mountains - hardly of the lake. We are off at 7 A.M. tomorrow for Paris.

<ner>Paris</ner> - May 10th - Saturday.

Hotel Westminster.

We reached here the other day after a not very fatiguing ride - and were so glad to establish ourselves in our comfortable, familiar rooms. The weather is horrid - and we are busy.

Saturday, May 17th.

This morning, Theodore, Constantini, who is staying with us, and I spent the morning at the Louvre, in the Renaissance Rooms - how cold they were - we were perished on coming out - but what treasures! Rain all the time - took tea the other day with the <ner>Kerbs</ner> - he very suffering, poor man. <ner>Tom</ner> <ner>Whistler</ner> came in the evening. <ner>Mathilde</ner> <ner>Boal</ner> in Paris, managing her sister’s wedding. She is here much of the time. Mrs. <ner>Davis,</ner> <ner>Sara</ner> <ner>Buttles,</ner> <ner>Pierre</ner> and his governess down in Savoy.

Tuesday, May 20.

The bad, cold, stormy weather still prevails - and between it and visits to many a stoney gallery, I have picked up quite a respectable cold - we are all very busy.

Saturday, May 24.

This is our last day here, and we have altogether in the 17 days here, not had one pleasant one. Business and sightseeing have occupied us - and paying and receiving many visits. <ner>Margaret</ner> <ner>La</ner> <ner>Farge</ner> and her mother made a long pleasant visit this afternoon.

Claridge’s Hotel, <ner>Brooke</ner> <ner>St.</ner>

London, 28 May.

We had a fine crossing the other day - but I had to enjoy it from the seclusion of my cabin because of my cold. Mathilde, her sister and sister’s fiance, M. Seychelle-Dulong came to say goodbye before we left, and <ner>Mathilde</ner> brought me some lovely pansies, from “my fazzer’s little garden”. We left poor <ner>Mary</ner> in tears, but she was to go off directly to the old place in <ner>Rue</ner> <ner>Bassano,</ner> now the Hotel Belmont, where she once spent a winter. Mrs. <ner>La</ner> <ner>Farge</ner> and <ner>Margaret</ner> are there, and we hear almost daily from her. Lizzie and <ner>Nettie</ner> leave <ner>Florence</ner> on June 2 - and they all meet at Weisbaden, and go on to <ner>Schwalback</ner> for the summer. We have had fine weather ever since we came to <ner>London</ner> - but I alas! have been staying indoors with my troublesome cough. Fielding lunched with us yesterday - <ner>Gaspard</ner> <ner>Farrer</ner> turned up on Monday - and asked us all to dinner with him for last night. I couldn’t go, and <ner>Bessie</ner> stayed with me. Theodore went, and had a jolly time - old Sir <ner>William</ner> was there, alert and vigorous as ever, except for his lameness. We like this hotel immensely - except the prices! We have a charming apartment on the 4th floor above the neighboring chimney pots - and we actually see the sunset from our windows. Everything is new, fresh and pretty, and such a pleasant contrast to the dingy old <ner>Hotel</ner> <ner>Bristol</ner> where we stayed such years.

Friday, May 30th.

Such a dull story to tell - in doors all the time - weather bad and cold - <ner>Weigall</ner> came to tea yesterday - and to lunch today. Fielding here too - and this afternoon <ner>Bessie</ner> and I went out in a closed carriage - and left cards on the Farrers and Denbighs - Miss <ner>Farrer</ner> having been here, and I having to decline even lunch - and not able to see Lord and <ner>Lady</ner> <ner>Denbigh</ner> when they called. <ner>Newberry</ner> came this afternoon to say goodbye - and <ner>Gaspard</ner> <ner>Farrer</ner> - we are off tomorrow.

<ner>Holland</ner> <ner>House</ner> - <ner>New</ner> <ner>York.</ner>

Sunday, June 7.

We arrived safely yesterday at 7 o’clock P.M. being the evening of the 8th day of the voyage - the longest N. <ner>Atlantic</ner> crossing I have made for years. The “St. Louis” was a very comfortable boat but not a fast one - I had a charming deck room, with private bath room - and as it was cold, gray and damp - I stayed in my room - most of the time in bed. We cannot get rooms on Monday’s boat - and are obliged to stay over for Tuesday morning - vexing!

17
