SS. <persName ref="#Weigall">Koenig Albert</persName> - Off the <placeName ref="#">Azores</placeName>. 
     Nov. 15th.
          We left <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName> on the 10th after spending 8 days between <placeName ref="#">N.Y.</placeName> and <placeName ref="#">Washington</placeName>. I left an unfinished garden at <placeName ref="#">Newport</placeName> - the weather for a week before we left being very stormy and bad. My flower borders I had to leave unsettled, and I shall have to manage them by long distance planting. I had hoped to have some leisure in <placeName ref="#">N.Y.</placeName> but each day brought so many demands. <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> arrived this morning and <persName ref="#Jean">Mary Newberry</persName> in the afternoon. We went over to <placeName ref="#">Washington</placeName> on the 4th - <persName ref="#Terry">Theodore</persName> and I stopping with <persName ref="#Terry">Terry</persName> and <persName ref="#Mathilde">Mathilde</persName> in their very charming French appartment. <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> went out to <placeName ref="#">Chevy Chase</placeName>, where the <orgName ref="#">Wilsons</orgName> are staying for a time, and spent a night and day with <persName ref="#Ali">Alice</persName> - and then back to <placeName ref="#">Baltimore</placeName> to stay with <persName ref="#Helen">Helen</persName>, until we picked her up 3 days later. I enjoyed seeing <placeName ref="#">Washington</placeName> again - and <persName ref="#Mathilde">Mathilde</persName> had 2 pleasant dinners for us. One day we drove out through the <placeName ref="#">Rocky Creek Valley</placeName> to <placeName ref="#">Chevy Chase</placeName>, where we had a lunch at the <orgName ref="#">Country Club</orgName>. We enjoyed everything during our short little visit - and especially the companionship of <persName ref="#Terry">Terry</persName> and <persName ref="#Mathilde">Mathilde</persName>. Dinners, teas and visits every day in <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName>, and made me ready for the quiet of the sea voyage; and I have had a beautiful rest and pleasant occupations up here in my little sky appartment - consisting of the Captain’s rooms on the bridge level. We passed the <placeName ref="#">Azores</placeName> today - going quite close to the island of <placeName ref="#">St. George</placeName>.

Wednesday, Nov. 21.
     Due tomorrow early at <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName>. A wonderful voyage - not one rough wave - sunshine, warmth, and a perfectly smooth sea - many pleasant people aboard - about 20 of us, going to <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName> on the Schleswig Friday.

<placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName>. Grand Hotel. Thursday. Nov. 22.
     We got in this morning early - a bright, clear day, but with a cold wind blowing - characteristic weather for <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> at this season. Vesuvius so quiet - not even a cloud of smoke about it. It has changed its outline very much since the last eruption - the cone is quite lost and the mountain looks dwarfed - the crater opening is on the other side now - from <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> - and not a spark could be seen at night. We are the only guests apparently in this house except the young <persName ref="#Tuckerman">Duke of Brunswick</persName> and his party whom we always see in <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName>. On his way I suppose, now. We are to be off tomorrow on the SS. Schleswig for <placeName ref="#">Alexandria</placeName>.

<placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>, Nov. 27. Shepheards Hotel.
     After a beautiful voyage on the comfortable Schleswig, we arrived Monday afternoon, in a pouring rain at <placeName ref="#">Alexandria</placeName>. Fortunately the ship went to the dock - but the disembarking was bad enough. We just caught the train for <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>. Dr. <persName ref="#Grenfell">Hunt</persName> and Dr. <persName ref="#Grenfell">Grenfell</persName> were on the boat and we found them as always - delightful and interesting. The former especially I like. We are in our old rooms overlooking the

Page 3

garden [smudged word] not many people here. It is said that all the newspapers talk of the unrest in <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName>, has frightened away many people. We found <persName ref="#Robert">Robert Trefusis</persName> waiting on the terrace at <placeName ref="#">Shepheards</placeName> for us. He is stopping here.

Wednesday, Nov. 29.
     Have paid a visit to the boat, which looks in very good and advanced readiness for us. Have shopped a little, and unpacked everything, or Amelie has, for readjustment for the winter. They have added another floor to this hotel - giving 75 new rooms - nice suites with bath rooms. Mr. <persName ref="#Carter">Bachler</persName> is no longer manager - though he gives a certain supervision to it. He has a very nice house now in the <placeName ref="#">Ghezireh Palace</placeName> grounds, where he lives - and is a powerful member of the Egyptian Hotels Syndicate. His character is so high and sterling, that he carries great influence and confidence. The Savoy hotel is building an addition almost as big as itself. The Hotel du Nil, has been torn down, and is rebuilding. The Grand Hotel comes down next summer, and a huge business block built in its place. The Ghezireh Palace Hotel will also come down, and be rebuilt on modern lines. <persName ref="#Smith">Ritz</persName> is building a charming looking hotel on the banks of the Nile - a short distance from the English Embassy. The greater part of <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> is being pulled down, or built upon. The thought pervading everybody seems to be how to speculate and make the most money - and the price of land is abnormal and stupendous. Dr. <persName ref="#Hunt">Hunt</persName> and Dr. <persName ref="#Grenfell">Grenfell</persName> and <persName ref="#Robert">Robert</persName> dined with us and we had a charming evening.

Page 4

Friday, Nov. 30.
     We had Mr. <persName ref="#Sayce">Sayce</persName> and <persName ref="#Robert">Robert</persName> to dine - Mr. <persName ref="#Sayce">Sayce</persName> looks ill and bad - has had a bad cold; he is sad too, and bemoaned the fact that he was growing old - and had to give up some of his activities. It seems to me very pathetic and inconsistent to hear a clergyman making such complaints. “Far above the belief and dream of material living is the Life Divine, revealing spiritual understanding and man’s dominion over the whole earth”.

Sunday, 2nd in Advent.
     At home this morning. In the afternoon we foolishly elected to drive out to the Pyramids for tea at the <orgName ref="#">Mena House</orgName> - forgetting how crowded it would be on a Sunday afternoon. The drive lost most of its pleasure and beauty from the crowd of whizzing motors that filled the air with dust and stench. Alas! how spoiled <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> is growing, on its march to modern improvements! <persName ref="#Robert">Robert</persName> went up to <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> this evening.

Monday, Dec. 3rd.
     Captain <persName ref="#Trefusis">Trefusis</persName> came in from the <orgName ref="#">Mena House</orgName> today, dined with us. We like him so much. He has resigned from the army, being such an invalid. His years in the <placeName ref="#">South of Africa</placeName> have told on him very much. At the boat most of the day.

Wednesday, Dec. 5.
     We took possession this morning of the boat. We have the tug 
Page 5

Thothmes to draw us - a strong, staunch tug. Went through the bridge shortly after 2 o’clock - then through the new <placeName ref="#">Ghizeh bridge</placeName>, and pulled up at 6:30 about 4 miles from <placeName ref="#">Helouan</placeName>. Captain <persName ref="#Trefusis">Trefusis</persName> stayed at the hotel with us, until we came away. We were quite sorry to part with him - very busy settling ourselves.

Thursday, Dec. 6.
     30 miles.	The strong south wind still blows - it being the 12 day of it the Captain says. The river is tremendously high and broad this year, owing to the heavy rains in <placeName ref="#">Abyyssinia</placeName> - it is like a lake, rather than river and the current very strong - started at 6:30 A.M.

Friday, Dec. 7.
     44 miles. A lovely day, but strong, south wind - passed the <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Joe Smiths</persName> this morning at breakfast - but did not see them until we were almost past them. This constant south wind is hard for them.

Saturday, Dec. 8.
     45 miles. 	We have had our sails out several times today - but most of the time the wind was too strong for us. Made an early start at 5 <orgName ref="#">P.M.&lt;/orgName&gt;
&lt;/orgName&gt;
Page</orgName> 6

Second Sunday in Advent. 
     53 miles. We started at early dawn this morning - stopping at <placeName ref="#">Minia</placeName> for an hour for an express parcel - which after all didn’t come. A strong and favourable wind most of the day, and aft sail out much of the time. Much warmer today.

Monday, Dec. 10.
     46 miles.	A fine, beautiful sailing day - had out our sail much of the time. Passed the <persName ref="#Helen">Aby Faida</persName> chain in fine style. It is a lonely river this year - few boats.

Tuesday, Dec. 11.
     37 miles.	We started early, but there was a thick fog and we stuck in the sand. I looked at my clock and found it 5:30. It made me shudder in my warm bed to hear our poor men in the water, getting us off. Reached Asyût at 8:30 - passed through the lock which was open finely. Stopped to post letters, and get Dr. <persName ref="#Helen">Henry</persName> to see <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName>, who has been ailing for a few days. Are lying tonight 4 miles above <placeName ref="#">Aboutig</placeName>.

Wednesday, Dec. 12.
     50 miles.	We reached <placeName ref="#">Sohag</placeName> about 5 o’clock and tied up for the night. A very strong cold wind blowing all day and sand flying. We have been passing through some of the most beautiful and highly cultivated country in <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName> for 2 days. The sugar cane crop
Page 7

is almost ready for the harvest - and at this time the people come from the villages to the banks of the river, with their family, dogs, and flocks and herds, to watch their crops. They build little huts and stockades of dried dourra stalks. It has a very pretty, pastoral air.

Thursday, Dec. 13.
     51 miles. Pulled up at <placeName ref="#">Nag Hamadi</placeName>, after dark, and will pass the bridge early tomorrow. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> issued orders that none of the men should go ashore - as the plague has been quite bad here and at <placeName ref="#">Girga</placeName> lately. A better day than yesterday - though a high north wind has prevailed - and waves were high and rough. 

Friday, Dec. 14.
     38 miles. Got through the bridge at 8:30 - a cold windy day with the most gorgeous sunset I ever saw. Tied up at 5:30 P.M.

Saturday, Dec. 15.
     44-1/2 miles.	We arrived at 5 o’clock - and pulled up at a little spit of sand, opposite the American Mission. The great sand bank opposite the town is almost unapproachable because of the shallowness of the water. Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Murch">Murch</persName> came over to see us at once. We will get off on Monday. We have taken just 10 days from <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>. 

Page 8

Sunday, Dec. 16. Third Sunday in Advent.
     <persName ref="#Theo">Theodore</persName>, <persName ref="#Jean">Jones</persName> and the lunch baskets went over to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> this morning - Jean and I stayed at home. Mr. <persName ref="#Carter">Curelly</persName>, and an artist Mr. <persName ref="#Tindale">Tindale</persName>, were here to tea.

Monday, Dec. 17.
     29 miles.	Did not get off until nearly 1 o’clock - owing to some trouble with rope of tug. A most lovely afternoon - with such a sunset. We were nearing <persName ref="#Tindale">Gebelein</persName>, and the opposite bold Mt. range was touched to pink and deepening crimson, while the western sky was every beautiful shade of blue and soft rose pink, while the new little silver crescent of the moon made a heavenly effect.

Tuesday, Dec. 18.
     45 miles.	The weather grows warmer - and is very fine - passed <persName ref="#Tindale">El Kab</persName> at 2:30, much interested in seeing Mr. <persName ref="#Somers-Clark">Somers-Clark</persName>’s house - apparently not yet finished. I like it much - and it is probably pretty and convenient inside. A fine situation looking up and down the river. The Safa was lying there - looking very big and fine. We are tonight about 4 miles above <placeName ref="#">Edfu</placeName>.

Wednesday, Dec. 19.
     64 miles.	We stopped about 7 o’clock - with-in sight of the lights of <placeName ref="#">Aswân</placeName>. A most lovely day - absolutely hot. All the morning on deck. The night is still and warm, and quite

Page 9

too beautiful for words. This delicious dry air is so welcome.

Thursday, Dec. 20.
     We came around early to our old landing place at the little island. Found the Zenet-el-Nil near us. Went into town by carriage from <placeName ref="#">Gatarast Hotel</placeName>, to see <persName ref="#Freda">Freda</persName> i her new home. I quite liked her husband, Mr. <persName ref="#Freda">Sammary</persName> - who is a teacher, and manager or rather helper at the German <orgName ref="#">Mission School</orgName>. <persName ref="#Jean">Freda</persName> herself looked much improved, much thinner. Their apartment on the ground floor, consisting of sitting room, bed room and kitchen, opened on to a very pretty garden. She was delighted to see me and <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName>. We took her some little presents, and she introduced us to the Doctor and his sweet faced wife and took us through the rather small school. In the afternoon Theo, <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> and I were rowed around to the <orgName ref="#">Savoy Hotel</orgName>, and had tea in those delightful gardens.

Friday, Dec. 21.
     12 miles.	We started with the tug about 7 o’clock. It was interesting getting up into those cataract waters again, and took me back to that morning, years ago, when on the Herodotus we attempted getting up, and met with such a fiasco. It was tiresome and nervous getting through the 4 different locks, because of the crowding gyassas, and the consequent noise and shrieking. We entered the first lock at 8 <orgName ref="#">A.M.</orgName> and passed the last at 11 o’clock. The special cataract rais for the cataract, as we came out, took the tug 

Page 10
immediately over a pile of loose stones under the water, nearly upsetting her, and of course we followed, the stones grinding under our whole length. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> was furious and with reason. The river above the dam was a large lake - the palm trees more or less submerged, and <placeName ref="#">Philad</placeName> standing in water. We passed Debôt, with its ruined Ptolemaic temple, and are now lying 2 miles above it - against a charming low desert shore. The day has been very hot - 78 on my cabana.

Saturday, Dec. 22nd.
     66 miles.	Made an early start at 5 - and tied up at 5 P.M. The day lovely - not quite so hot as yesterday. I got up at 6 o’clock to see the lovely morning with the exquisite desert colouring - and one of the first things I saw was the ruined little temple of <placeName ref="#">Kertassi</placeName>, standing in the golden yellow sands under the light of the dawn. I was so interested too in the almost continuous villages on both sides of the river, so clear and orderly, the house solidly built of stones, and with some effort at architectural effect or rather ornament and with occasional white minarets and mosques - all of these villages struggling up - over the rough bare desert. The poor palms are still standing most of them in water, looking sad enough - with  their yellowing and dying fronds. Others, farther back, on dry land showing several feet up their stems the mark of the water. As the day went on, the conditions improved somewhat. The villages became so interesting and a real artistic spirit seemed abroad. The houses had ornamental brick work “à jour” across their fronts - often of excellent 

Page 11

workmanship and design - and frequently tiles and plates were used. In some of them, the ornamental balustrade around the top seemed to enclose earth in which small shrubs were planted. Altogether very interesting. The small temples seen in this part of the river from time to time are not very attractive. I have already visited them during my two former visits. 

Fourth Sunday in Advent. Dec. 23rd.
     77 miles.	We are lying tonight between the two towns of <placeName ref="#">Genena</placeName> and <placeName ref="#">Shibbâik</placeName> - having made 77 miles. There are left 26 miles between this and <persName ref="#Abu_Simbel">Abu Simbel</persName> for tomorrow. This has been another perfect day and we have been coming through the most fertile and beautiful scenery I have seen on the Nile. We came, too, to the natural river with its current, and are free from the back water of the barrage. The palms have been magnificent - and such a rich, dark, polished green. Never have I seen such fine scent trees, and in such perfect bloom and so many of them, - large forest trees in fact. And the tamarasks look almost like English yews - so compact are they and so dark in colour. This afternoon in passing the interesting remains of the Roman fortress <placeName ref="#">Kasr Ibrâm</placeName>, on its lofty rock, the scenery was quite beyond painting - the western side being a wonderful stretch of gold red desert, as far as the eye could see, broken by bold detached bare hills, their black iron coating making such contrasts in color. Quite too beautiful and impressive ever to be forgotten.

Page 12

Monday, Dec. 24th.
     23 miles.	We were off at 6 o’clock and reached <persName ref="#Abu_Simbel">Abu Simbel</persName> at 11:30 - tremendously hot. Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Newman">Newman</persName> whose dahabya we knew was there as usual, came over at once to see us, and stayed until lunch - asked us to tea, and promised to come and dine with us. Mr. <persName ref="#Newman">Newman</persName> harrowed our feelings by telling us we must be careful of snakes in the temples - that 2 mornings before the track of a large, very large snake had been traced in the sand from a certain place into the larger temple, and they were feeling rather nervous about it. He has his painting tent just in front of the temple. We had pleasant visits with them and said goodbye after dinner to them.

Tuesday, Dec. 25. Christmas.
     76 miles.	As we drew away from the bank at 8 o’clock this morning, we saw Mr. <persName ref="#Newman">N.</persName> on the bank, waving his white umbrella in farewell. We have made fast time today, and are lying at <placeName ref="#">Sabua</placeName> tonight. Very hot today, and very high wind.

Wednesday, Dec. 26.
     95 miles.	We have come at a tremendous pace today - the heat still holds. We are lying within 6 miles of <placeName ref="#">Shellal</placeName> at a lovely dry slope of sand - the air so dry and very warm. These moonlight nights are most lovely. I was on deck most of the day - in spite of the wind.

Page 13

Thursday, Dec. 27.
     46 miles.	An early start brought us to <placeName ref="#">Philae</placeName> at 7 o’clock, had a beautiful view of it - stopped an hour or more at <placeName ref="#">Shellal</placeName> to coal - passed the lock at 11 o’clock and stopped at <placeName ref="#">Aswân</placeName> just long enough to get our mail, and pay a hurried goodbye visit to <persName ref="#Freda">Freeda</persName> at the Mission. Very hot all day - are lying 6 miles below <placeName ref="#">Silsilis</placeName> - and <persName ref="#M._Maspero">M. Maspero</persName> is just behind us. 46 miles in 5 hours is good going. Found a huge mail at <placeName ref="#">Aswân</placeName>. 

Friday, Dec. 28.
     86 miles.	Started at 6 A.M. and arrived at <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> at 4 P.M. A charming day - hot, but with cool wind - a quick journey from <placeName ref="#">Aswân</placeName> at 12 noon yesterday to <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> today at 4. The tug started down at once. She has taken us 1079 miles - about the distance from <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> to <placeName ref="#">Alexandria</placeName>. An expensive luxury but convenient.

Saturday, Dec. 29.
     We tied up on arriving yesterday to a little rag of a sand bank about where we were last year. The “<placeName ref="#">Dongola</placeName>” is the only other dahabya here. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> went over to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> this morning, and <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> and I went to see Miss <persName ref="#Buchanan">Buchanan</persName> - Mr. <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName> came in for tea - so glad to see him.

First Sunday after Christmas. Dec. 30.
     A quiet pleasant day at home. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#Jones">Jean</persName> at <placeName ref="#">Karnac</placeName> this 

Page 14

afternoon.

Monday, Dec. 31.
     Home all day. Mr. <persName ref="#Somers-Clark">Somers-Clarke</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName> were here this afternoon, and stayed to tea. <persName ref="#Carter">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#Jones">Jean</persName> at <placeName ref="#">Karnac</placeName>.

Jan. 1st. 1907.
     Mr. <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName> to lunch and Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Weigall">Pumpelly</persName> with <persName ref="#Carter">Raphael Pumpelly</persName> were here to tea and <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Joe Smith</persName> to dine. Very warm.

Jan. 2nd. Wednesday.
     A telegram from <persName ref="#Nettie">Nettie</persName>, saying she will arrive tomorrow at 9 A.M. All the Pumpellys dined with us. 

Thursday, Jan. 3rd.
     <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> and I breakfasted at 8:30 and went over to <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> and to the station to meet <persName ref="#Nettie">Nettie</persName> who arrived promptly at 9. It is 5 years since she was here. The Miss <persName ref="#Collins">Collins</persName> arrived by the same train.

Friday, Jan. 4th.
     Mr. <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName> wrote a note this morning to <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> saying he had found a tomb. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> had intended going over today, so when he returned he reported that it promised something - but was still uncertain. <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> and I went over to the hotel to pay some visits.

Page 15

Saturday, Jan 5.
     Another note from Mr. <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName> saying the tomb was not a tomb! <persName ref="#Nettie">Nettie</persName> was so disappointed. Dr. <persName ref="#Wiedemann">Wiedemann</persName> and his wife dined with us tonight. They are delightful people, and we had a charming evening.

Sunday, Jan. 6.
     A quiet delightful morning - Mr. <persName ref="#Wiedemann">Dalison</persName> came to lunch - some of <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName>’s friends to tea.

Monday, Jan. 7.
     <persName ref="#Theo">Theodore</persName> went over to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> this morning - found it very hot - and when he got back quite late, told us that <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName> had this time found a real tomb. We are all going over tomorrow, and so are Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Weigall">Weigall</persName>. <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Joe Smith</persName> is staying at the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> tonight with <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName>. <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> went to the hotel to lunch with Mrs. <persName ref="#Peckett_-_Nettie">Peckett - Nettie</persName> and I had a beautiful lunch on deck, and at 3 o’clock went over to the hotel for her - Mrs. <persName ref="#Peckett_-_Nettie">Peckett</persName>, the Misses <persName ref="#Collins">Collins</persName>, and <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName> were there - we brought <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName> home with us, calling on our way back on their dahabya “<persName ref="#Carter">Stella</persName>” on the Smiths. Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Weigall">Weigall</persName> came to tea.

Tuesday, Jan. 8th.
     All of us went over to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> this morning - found Mr. <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName> had cleared enough to show a small chamber which he thought was the whole tomb. But after lunch it was found that a doorway which had been sealed up as that in the tomb of <placeName ref="#">Touyou</placeName> and <persName ref="#Weigall">Iuia</persName> led to a corridor.

Page 16

In removing some of the blocks of stone which hindered progress, a fine broken alabaster vase, and some bits of gold foil were found; so the work for the day was stopped, as it was too late to open it, the guards and police were sent for, and we rode home - speculating as to who the tomb had belonged. Mr. <persName ref="#Weigall">Weigall</persName> and his wife were already camping in the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> - and wanted <persName ref="#Nettie">Nettie</persName> and <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> to stay with them the night - which they did - delighted at the opportunity. <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Joe Smith</persName> and his wife also stayed. A very nice man, an Englishman, whom <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> had met the day before, lunched in the tomb with us, Mr. <persName ref="#David_Erskin_M.P._Theo">David Erskin M.P. Theo</persName> and I had a quiet evening alone - a most unusual thing.

Jan. 9. Wednesday.
     We made rather an early start this morning - Theo and I, with <persName ref="#David_Erskin_M.P._Theo">Amelie</persName> and <persName ref="#Jones">Jones</persName>, and <persName ref="#Ayrton">Hassein</persName>. When we arrived at the tomb, every one was waiting for us as the doorway and steps had been cleared, and everything ready for an entrance. <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName>, <persName ref="#Jones">Weigall</persName> and <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> scrambled along the corridor over the tombs, and made a very difficult entrance. Mr. <persName ref="#Erskine">Erskine</persName>, by invitation had joined us, we women, with Mr. E., Mrs. <persName ref="#Weigall">Weigall</persName>, and <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Joe</persName> and his wife, sat about on the rocks above, and waited straining our ears to catch the broken exclamations that reached us from below - “Aton! The rays of the Sun” Tut-ankh-amen” etc. and at last Mr. <persName ref="#Davis">Davis</persName>’s voice rang out, “By <persName ref="#Jones">Jove</persName>, <persName ref="#Queen_Tyi">Queen Tyi</persName>, and no mistake” and so it proved. On the rough stones of the corridor rested a wooden door, 12 x 14 ft. long - 6 ft. wide, and a smaller one about 2 x 4 - with bronze doors and hinges - both doors covered with gold foil - the 

Page 17

smaller one in quite good condition, and on it the cartouche of Tyi, and that of her husband Amenhotep III. The burial chamber was not large, but in a state of great confusion. The Queen would seem to have been laid in a great, highly decorated, wood shrine - parts of which were on the floor, or leaning against the wall, - the coffin on the floor - all showing hasty burial, or robbery or desecration. I did not go down - but <persName ref="#Nettie">Nettie</persName>, Mrs. <persName ref="#Weigall">Weigall</persName>, and <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> went down - one by one - <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> was determined that <persName ref="#Nettie">Nettie</persName> should be the first one to see it, and she was the first woman to enter. All the men had been down. We had a big lunch with everyone, and a charming day. Very warm today.

Thursday, Jan.10.
     <persName ref="#Nettie">Theo</persName> and the girls went again to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>. I wouldn’t face that long ride in the hot sun today - and so had a nice quiet day at home. They came back very tired, bringing word of the many treasures of the tomb. Tomorrow the tomb is to be given over into the hands of a skillful photographer sent for from <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> - and <persName ref="#Theo">Joe Smith</persName> is also painting there. 

Jan. 11. Friday.
     <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> came over in the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> again - had <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName> lunching with us.

Jan. 12. Saturday.
     Theo at home for a rest. The girls and I over at <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> - visiting and shopping. Mr. <persName ref="#Erskine">Erskine</persName> dined with us. A nice, big, handsome Englishman.

Jan. 13. 1st Sunday after Epiphany.
     M. and Mme. <persName ref="#Erskine">Naville</persName> dined with us.

<placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName>, Jan. 14. Monday.
     A quiet day at home. The <persName ref="#Maspero">Maspero</persName>’s boat arrived this morning. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> went over to see them - they are delighted with the finding of <persName ref="#Tyi">Tyi</persName>’s tomb - weather cool and pleasant - the mountains were wonderful at dawn this morning - the first rosy touch of the sun on their highest peaks until the whole range burned with a rosy light - transfused as it were - as if its colour came from itself.

Tuesday, Jan. 15.
     It has been a dull, dark day with north wind in squalls. A pleasant visit from M. and Mme. <persName ref="#Maspero">Maspero</persName> this afternoon and a nice cable from Mr. <persName ref="#Robert">Robinson</persName> of congratulation to <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName>. this evening we had a gale, and were battered about - and rain fell for a time.

Wednesday, Jan. 16.
     We had a hard rain for 2 hours this A.M. and it was cold. The Masperos went to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> in spite of it. Mme. <persName ref="#Maspero">Maspero</persName> had my chair.

Page 19

<persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> went over later, and they had lunch with him.

Thursday, Jan. 17.
     <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> went over to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> this morning. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> reports that they were clearing the corridor and bracing up stones which held part of wooden shrine. It is all under <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName>’s charge. <persName ref="#Nettie">Nettie</persName> and I crossed to <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> this morning. I went to the <placeName ref="#">Luxor Hotel</placeName> to see Mrs. <persName ref="#Buchanan">Congdon</persName>, who is better, and then joined <persName ref="#Nettie">Nettie</persName> at the Temples, and we took a carriage and drove to the <orgName ref="#">Girls Mission School</orgName> but found Miss <persName ref="#Buchanan">Buchanan</persName> was in <placeName ref="#">Asyût</placeName> attending the yearly conference. Stopped at <placeName ref="#">Mohassibs</placeName> for a little visit. The poor man looks old and ill. Mr. <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName> and Rev. Mr. <persName ref="#Samms">Samms</persName> came to tea. 

Friday, Jan. 18.
     We all went over to <placeName ref="#">Karnac</placeName> this afternoon - met Mme. <persName ref="#Maspero">Maspero</persName> and a friend there. Mr. <persName ref="#Sayce">Sayce</persName> arrived early in the day - I sent him a note asking him to come to tea. 

Saturday, Jan, 19.
     At the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>. Dr. <persName ref="#Wiedemann">Wiedermann</persName> and wife, and Mr. <persName ref="#Sayce">Sayce</persName> were over and lunched with us in the lunch tomb. I went down to the burial chamber and it is now almost easy of access - and saw the poor <persName ref="#Queen_Tyi">Queen</persName> as she lies now just a bit outside her magnificent coffin, with the vulture crown on her head - all the woodwork of the shrine, doors, etc. are heavily overlaid with gold foil - which under the influence of the 

Page 20

outer air is now peeling off - and I seemed to be walking on gold - and even the Arab working inside had some of it sticking in his wooly hair. Here is the sketch of the tomb and situation of objects.

No. 1. mummy of Queen - partly overlaid by coffin No. 2 - both on the floor. 3,3,3,3, doors or panels - very large, heavily overlaid with gold, - the one with the x, has a beautiful portrait of Queen. All of them beautifully incised on the gold leaf. <persName ref="#Ayrton">Aton</persName> rays on all and <persName ref="#Queen_Tyi">Khuenatens</persName> cartouche followed by an inscription “I made this for the great <persName ref="#Queen_Tyi">Queen Tyi</persName>, royal mother”. The 4 x-a against the wall are 4 large panels, all gold and inscriptions.

Second Sunday after Epiphany - Jan. 20.
     Home all day - Theo and <persName ref="#Queen_Tyi">Nettie</persName> went to <placeName ref="#">Karnac</placeName> in the afternoon. Many visitors. Mrs. <persName ref="#Smith">Smith</persName>, Sir <persName ref="#Benjamin_Stone">Benjamin Stone</persName>, Mr. <persName ref="#Countess_Henckel">Briggs</persName> and Currelly; Mr. <persName ref="#Sayce">Sayce</persName> dined with us. Cool, all day - cold, now. My mountains were wonderful this A.M.

Monday, Jan. 21.
     Theo at the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> all day - he reports all the panels being treated to paraffin to hold the gold in place. Weidermans dined with us. Our new moon should have shown.

Tuesday, Jan. 22.
     Prof. <persName ref="#Tarbell">Tarbell</persName>, <orgName ref="#">Chicago University</orgName>, called with a letter from Mr. <persName ref="#Lythgoe">Lythgoe</persName>. <persName ref="#Jones">Robert Trefusis</persName> and <persName ref="#Harold_Jones">Harold Jones</persName> arrived from <placeName ref="#">Abydos</placeName> - on coming back after some visits this afternoon found them here. They came back to dine.

Wednesday, Jan. 23.
     <persName ref="#Robert">Robert</persName> and <persName ref="#Ayrton">H. Jones</persName> to dine again - discussed how to treat the panels and doors of shrine. H.J. came here to paint or draw them, finds it very difficult - decided to take an impression of inscriptions by wax and plaster of paris - our little new moon showed for the first time tonight.

Thursday, Jan. 24.
     Theo at home today. <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#Harriman">Dalison</persName> lunched with us. We all went over to the new hotel, the “Winter Palace” to have tea and called on Mrs. <persName ref="#Harriman">Harriman</persName>, who is lying opposite us in the new private steamer the Soudan. <persName ref="#Harriman">Robert</persName> and <orgName ref="#">H.J.</orgName> dined with us. Lovely day.

Friday, Jan. 25.
     <persName ref="#Tarbell">Theo</persName> was all day at the Tomb - entertained at luncheon, Prof. <persName ref="#Tarbell">Tarbell</persName> and <persName ref="#Jones">M. Lacau - Ayrton</persName>, <placeName ref="#">Weigall</placeName>, <persName ref="#Jones">Robert</persName> and <persName ref="#Harold_Jones">Harold Jones</persName>. They at last lifted the coffin off the mummy without much damage. Owing to

Page 22

the past presence of water in the tomb, the coffin, except for the cover which is made of gold inlaid with lapis and carnelian, had gone into ruins - and her poor mummy turned into dust. They took off the vulture crown and saw a necklace and bracelets - but did not disturb them as they want a doctor to examine the skeleton and pronounce upon her sex, scientifically. They found the body wrapped in thick gold plates rather than foil. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> brought the crown home with him - and it now lies in the closet at the head of my bed! It is of solid gold, and represents the royal vulture, with out-spread wings and meeting behind the head, beautifully done in a fine répoussé style - every feather perfect. <persName ref="#Robert">Robert</persName> and <orgName ref="#">H.J.</orgName> dined here.

Saturday, Jan. 26.
     We all went over to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> this morning and I made my last descent into the tomb. The morning was warm - my poor little donkeys were tired - for <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> has been the prey of countless multitudes of tourists for weeks. It was our last opportunity to see the tomb and the Queen. She is nothing but a mass of black dust and bones. Everything is now to be taken out of the tomb, as soon as <persName ref="#Harold_Jones">Harold Jones</persName> finishes the drawing of the big door - everything has been likewise photographed. Mr. <persName ref="#David_Erskin_M.P._Theo">David Erskine</persName>, M.P. a delightful Englishman, <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> fell in with awhile ago, lunched with us for the 2d time in the lunch tomb. We had a merry lunch. Mrs. <persName ref="#Harriman">Harriman</persName> and daughter, and Miss <persName ref="#Buchanan">Bishop</persName> came to see the tomb.

Page 23

Septuagesima Sunday, Jan. 27. 
     I had my quiet little church today - about 4 o’clock as we were waiting for tea, on deck, we saw coming across the distant sands the procession of the treasures of the tomb on its way to us - Weigall and <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName> on horses led the way, and a long procession of Arabs following carrying the boxes - and the sun striking the rifles of the accompanying sailors. It was really impressive. Our faluccas were sent for them, and a large native gyassa pressed into service - and they are now safely stowed on deck - the smaller things below. Dr. <persName ref="#Wiedemann">Weideman</persName> and his wife and Mr. <persName ref="#Sayce">Sayce</persName> dined with us.

Monday, Jan. 28.
     A lovely warm day - Theo in the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>. He says everything that is to be moved is out of the tomb. The ashes and bones of the Queen have been reverently gathered and put into a box - and left there - and the tomb is to be hermetically sealed. Mr. <persName ref="#Erskine">Erskine</persName> dined with us.

Tuesday, Jan. 29.
     <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> took over Mrs. <persName ref="#Harriman">Harriman</persName> and party to <persName ref="#Countess_Henckel">Medinet Habu</persName> today. Mr. <persName ref="#Sayce">Sayce</persName> came to tea, and we looked over many of the interesting treasure we have on board. <persName ref="#Jones">Jones</persName> had a carpenter here early this morning to construct a big box to hold everything that must stay on deck - and now this box 8-1/2 ft. long by 5 ft. high and broad is on our back upper deck and looks formidable and is safe against everything but a concerted raid.

Page 24

Wednesday, Jan. 30.
     M. and Mme. <persName ref="#Maspero">Maspero</persName> came to tea and to see the treasures. Mr. <persName ref="#Buchanan">Lacau</persName> with them. Mrs. <persName ref="#Harriman">Harriman</persName>, her daughter and Miss <persName ref="#Harriman">Bishop</persName> dined with us. They are on their way to <placeName ref="#">Khartoum</placeName>.

Thursday, Jan. 31.
     Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Lythgoe">S. R. Fuller</persName>, with a letter from Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Lythgoe">Jack Elliott</persName> of <placeName ref="#">Rome</placeName>, came this morning and Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Samms">Syms</persName> and their 2 daughters, people we used to know in the old Bon Air days, came to lunch - and several other visitors.

Friday, Feb. 1. 
     <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> in the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> today. Mr. <persName ref="#Sayce">Carter</persName> came to lunch with us.

Saturday, Feb. 2.
     We all went to lunch with Mr. <persName ref="#Sayce">Sayce</persName>. M. and Mme. <persName ref="#Naville">Naville</persName> and Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Weigall">Weigall</persName> were there - very pleasant. Then we went to the <placeName ref="#">Luxor Hotel</placeName> gardens to have tea with Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Tuckerman">Fuller</persName>, who had a great gathering of people. I met for the first time Miss Hazard, President of <orgName ref="#">Wellesley College</orgName>, and Miss <persName ref="#Buchanan">Bates</persName> Prof. of Literature of <placeName ref="#">Wellesley</placeName>. On our way home we stopped at the Winter Palace, to see Miss <persName ref="#Tuckerman">Tuckerman</persName>. Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Weigall">Guthrie</persName> of <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName>, and the <persName ref="#Jones">Iddings</persName> of <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>. <persName ref="#Harold_Jones">Harold Jones</persName> dined with us.

Page 25

Sexagesima Sunday - Feb. 3.
     Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Erskine">Guthrie</persName> came to breakfast and stayed until 12 o’clock - perfectly enraptured with all the Egyptian talk and things. He is most interesting. Mr. and Mme. <persName ref="#Naville">Naville</persName> came to lunch - and <persName ref="#Ayrton">Harold Jones</persName>. <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Joe Smith</persName> and his wife and mother were here for tea. Mr. <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Van Alen</persName> called, and M. and Mme. <persName ref="#Maspero">Maspero</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#Collins">Dalison</persName> dined with us. The day pleasant and warm - and the early morning dawn, ravishingly beautiful.

Monday, Feb. 4.
     At home all day. Misses <persName ref="#Collins">Collins</persName> called this afternoon, and I showed them the treasures.

Tuesday, Feb. 5.

Wednesday, Feb. 6.
     <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Joe Smith</persName> has been painting one of the beautiful Tyi heads of the canopic jars here all the morning. <persName ref="#Nettie">Nettie</persName>, <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> and I lunched with Mrs. <persName ref="#Weigall">Weigall</persName>. Mr. <persName ref="#Smith">W. ill</persName> and did not appear. Mr. <persName ref="#Smith">Smith</persName> lunched with <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> - and Mr. <persName ref="#Van_Alen">Van Alen</persName> and friend had tea here, and saw the “find”. After we left Mrs. <persName ref="#Van_Alen">Weigalls</persName> we went to the <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName>, and had tea on the croquet lawn with the Misses <persName ref="#Collins">Collins</persName> - very pleasant. Mr. <persName ref="#Sayce">Sayce</persName> sailed for Aswân.

Page 26

     Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Henry_Osborne">Henry Osborne</persName> of <placeName ref="#">Milwaukie</placeName> called this morning.

Mrs. <persName ref="#Murch">Murch</persName> and Miss <persName ref="#Carter">Bates</persName> were here for tea. <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Joe Smith</persName> painting.



Friday, Feb. 8
     <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> was in the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> today. Mr. <persName ref="#Van_Alen">Van Alen</persName> and his friend, <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName> and <persName ref="#Jean">Jones</persName> lunched with him. <persName ref="#Jean">Nettie</persName>, <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> and I went over to the <orgName ref="#">Luxor Hotel</orgName> and head tea with Mr. <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName>. 

Saturday, Feb. 9
     Mr. <persName ref="#Smith">Smith</persName> still painting here - stayed to lunch, and went out afterwards with us to the Tombs of the <placeName ref="#">Queens</placeName>. A charming ride.

Quinquagesima Sunday, Feb. 10.
     Mr. <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName> came this afternoon with Lord and <persName ref="#Lady_Cromer">Lady Halsbury</persName> to see the find and soon after M. and Mme. <persName ref="#Naville">Naville</persName>, their daughter and her husband, M. and Mme. <persName ref="#Fatio">Fatio</persName> came - and we had such a pleasant talk with <persName ref="#M._Naville">M. Naville</persName> over the treasures. Then we all went to the Masperos for tea and to meet Sir <persName ref="#Benjamin_Stone">Wm. Garstin</persName> and wife, Mr. <persName ref="#Goschen">Goschen</persName>, and a major <persName ref="#Goschen">Percira</persName> and his wife. We afterwards called on the <orgName ref="#">Livingstons</orgName>.

Monday, Feb. 11.
     It was warm today. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> over in <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName>, calling on Miss

Page 27

<persName ref="#Buchanan">Buchanan</persName>, and Miss <persName ref="#Tuckerman">Tuckerman</persName>. This afternoon <persName ref="#Maspero">M. Maspero</persName>, Sir <persName ref="#Benjamin_Stone">William Garstin</persName>, Mr. <persName ref="#Goschen">Goschen</persName>, and Major and Mrs. <persName ref="#Weigall">Percira</persName> came to tea and after were shown the find. <persName ref="#M._Maspero">M. Maspero</persName> delighted <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> by saying they wanted him to have one of the canopic heads and he hoped he would choose the best one. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> replied he would not do that, but would choose the one having a stain across the head caused by dripping water. They were all delighted with the things - Sir <persName ref="#Benjamin_Stone">William</persName>, I found most interesting. It is raining a little tonight. 

Tuesday, Feb. 12.
     <persName ref="#Harold_Jones">Harold Jones</persName> began painting the beautiful <persName ref="#Tyi">Tyl</persName> head this morning - and was here all day. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> took <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> and Miss <persName ref="#Tuckerman">Tuckerman</persName> with him to <persName ref="#Grenfell">Karnac</persName>. Dr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Harold_Jones">Pollack</persName> came to tea. Day very dark and threatening - and last night a hard gale was raging.

Wednesday, Feb. 13. Ash Wednesday.
     <persName ref="#Harold_Jones">Harold Jones</persName> again painting. Miss <persName ref="#Tuckerman">Tuckerman</persName> and <persName ref="#Jean">Joan</persName> came to lunch. In the afternoon we all went over to <persName ref="#Jean">Der el Bahari</persName>, and <persName ref="#M._Naville">M. Naville</persName> showed Miss T. the temple. She was delighted with him and the opportunity. We went afterwards to tea with Mme. <persName ref="#M._Naville">Naville</persName> at the German <orgName ref="#">House</orgName>. When we got home we found we had missed <persName ref="#M._Maspero">M. Maspero</persName>. Mr. <persName ref="#Countess_Henckel">Percy Machaye</persName> and <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Lady Victoria</persName>, his wife; but <persName ref="#Henry_Osborne">Harold Jones</persName> showed the treasures. We also missed Sir <persName ref="#Henry_Osborne">Henry Craik</persName>.

Page 28
Thursday, Feb. 14.
     We were overwhelmed with people this A.M. A Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Henry_Osborne">Crocker</persName> introduced by letter from the Folgers, and Mr. <persName ref="#Wiedemann">White</persName>. They both brought boat loads of people with them - a nuisance and impertinence! Mr. <persName ref="#Hall">Hall</persName> also came, but we lost the pleasure of his visit, by this crowd. 17 people at once in our little salon, is too much. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#Lady_Cromer">Jean</persName> in the valley, they got home early, as Lord and <persName ref="#Lady_Cromer">Lady Cromer</persName> were coming at 5 o’clock. The Weigalls, and a Mr. <persName ref="#M._Maspero">Eric Villiers</persName> saw the things and then came the Cromers and <persName ref="#M._Maspero">M. Maspero</persName>, and <persName ref="#Lady_Cromer">Lady Cromer</persName> was much interested and he much more so than he seemed. They were entranced with the boat and especially with my room. She is quite charming and he is interesting because of his achievements, and because of the power he wields.

Friday, Feb. 15.
     All the family except myself went to the Valley today. Miss <persName ref="#Tuckerman">Tuckerman</persName> with them. <persName ref="#Harold_Jones">Harold Jones</persName> and I had a pleasant quiet day. Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Jones">John H. Livingston</persName> called. The Masperos started down the river today.

Saturday, Feb. 16.
     <persName ref="#Nettie">Nettie</persName> and <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> lunched with Miss <persName ref="#Tuckerman">Tuckerman</persName> today. This afternoon the <persName ref="#Hunt">Hutesons</persName>, and some friends of Jeans, Dr. <persName ref="#Hunt">Schweinfürt</persName>, and <persName ref="#Hall">Fachery Pasha</persName> called. Quite warm.

Page 29

1st Sunday in Lent. Feb. 17.
     Mr. <persName ref="#Hall">Hall</persName> lunched with us. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> was in <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> this A.M. and <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName> told him of various small and precious things which had been shown him by a native which had been stolen from <persName ref="#Tyi">Tyi</persName>’s tomb. The man had told <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName> that Mr. <persName ref="#Davis">Davis</persName> could have them all for £400. - provided no attempt at arrest was made! These fellows are difficult to deal with. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> told <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName> if the men would produce everything they had, and would show them, he might consider a price and promise no arrests to be made. Their practice is to mass together a lot of valuable things on such an occasion, with what has been stolen from a late find, and try to get a big price for all. Later in the day Theo went into <persName ref="#Carter">Abd el Hamed</persName>’s and <persName ref="#Ali">Ali</persName>’s shops on the river, and the latter handed him several small objects from the tomb - some gold “neferts” from the necklace, carnelian lotus flowers, and a lovely bit of gold and enamel from a necklace - only one of which we have - and it is marked No. 17 in hieroglyphic characters. <persName ref="#Ali">Ali</persName> would not take anything for these - among them one bearing <persName ref="#Aten">Aten</persName>’s cartouche. It is humiliating to find that thieves have been among your trusted workmen - they have such chances in sifting dèbris, to hide a valuable thing in their loose clothes. Mr. <persName ref="#Aten">Lythgoe</persName> and <persName ref="#Harriman">Countess Henckel</persName> and her daughter <persName ref="#Harriman">Countess Hahn</persName> came to tea - and M. and Mme. <persName ref="#Fatio">Fatio</persName> and <persName ref="#Davis">Dalison</persName> dined with us. A lovely warm day.

Monday, Feb. 18.
     A most unpleasant day of tremendous wind and sand flying in 

Page 30
clouds over us. No one ventured out. Mr. <persName ref="#Davis">Lythgoe</persName> to lunch.

Tuesday, Feb. 19.
     <persName ref="#Countess_Henckel">Countess Henckel</persName>, and <persName ref="#Jones">Hahn</persName> and <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName> to lunch. <persName ref="#Ayrton">Ayrton</persName> deeply distressed about the robbery. He suspects the trusted <persName ref="#Davis">Rais</persName>, or rather 2 sons of his. It is mysterious. <persName ref="#Harold_Jones">Harold Jones</persName> finished his two paintings of Tyi, and went back to <placeName ref="#">Abydos</placeName> tonight. A boat load of people came this afternoon with a note from Mrs. <persName ref="#Weigall">Weigall</persName> asking that they might be shown the find. Miss <persName ref="#Tuckerman">Tuckerman</persName> came to say goodbye, as she is off for Aswân.

Thursday, Feb. 21st.
     <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName>, <persName ref="#Jean">Nettie</persName> and I went over to <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> this A.M. Theo to see Weigall about robbery. <persName ref="#Nettie">Nettie</persName> and I to <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName>’s studio - asked him to tea. <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Joe Smith</persName>, and wife, dined here. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> later went to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> with <persName ref="#Jean">Jean</persName> and <persName ref="#Countess_Henckel">Countess Hahn</persName>.

Friday, Feb. 22.
     A quiet day on board. Rev. Mr. <persName ref="#Samms">Samms</persName> came in the afternoon to play chess with <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> and Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#Smith">Smith</persName> came to tea.

Saturday, Feb. 23.
     <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#Jean">Nettie</persName> went to <placeName ref="#">Der el Medinet</placeName> this afternoon. <persName ref="#Robert">Robert Trefusis</persName> arrived unexpectedly. Prof. <persName ref="#Tarbell">Fairfield Osborn</persName>, his son, and Mrs. <persName ref="#Evert_Jansen_Wendell">Evert Jansen Wendell</persName> came - having sent on their letters of introduction

Page 31

from Mrs. <persName ref="#Evert_Jansen_Wendell">Parsons</persName> and <persName ref="#Murch">Mary</persName>, some days before their arrival.

Second Sunday in Lent. Feb. 24.
     Such a busy day - and such a tiresome afternoon. The very nice Osborns, son and Mr. <persName ref="#Wendell">Wendell</persName> came at 11 A.M. to be shown the treasures - enraptured with them. <persName ref="#Davis">Dalison</persName> and <persName ref="#Naville">Robert</persName> to lunch. At 3 o’clock a farewell visit from M. and Mme. <persName ref="#Naville">Naville</persName>, and M. and Mme. <persName ref="#Fatio">Fatio</persName> - also from <persName ref="#Countess_Henckel">Countess Henckel</persName> and <persName ref="#Countess_Henckel">Countess Hahn</persName> - Mr. <persName ref="#Joe_Smith">Le Grain</persName> and his wife had been formally asked to tea some days ago and Mr. <persName ref="#Weigall">Weigall</persName> had written last evening asking if he might bring Lord and <persName ref="#Lady_Cromer">Lady Carnarvon</persName>, and Mrs. <persName ref="#Weigall">Loring</persName> and her friend of <placeName ref="#">Boston</placeName> to see the find, Dr. <persName ref="#Wendell">Johnson</persName> belonging to the Carnarvons. These latter I thought simply intolerable. But it was tiresome! The nice Osborns and Mr. <persName ref="#Wendell">Wendell</persName> and <persName ref="#Robert">Robert</persName> dined here. A charming evening with charming people. 

Monday, Feb. 25.
     <persName ref="#Robert">Nettie</persName>, <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> and I over in <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> this <persName ref="#Tuckerman">A.M. Nettie</persName> and I to say goodbye to  Miss <persName ref="#Buchanan">Buchanan</persName> and to call on the Pollocks - stopped at the <placeName ref="#">Luxor Hotel</placeName> for the Miss <persName ref="#Collins">Collins</persName> who were coming to lunch. Such a nice visit, from two Scotch bodies I like so much. Mr. <persName ref="#Murch">Murch</persName> was here this morning, and he promised to bring his wife and our old friend <persName ref="#Murch">Mohammed Mohassib</persName> this afternoon to see the find. The poor old man has had a stroke this winter and is sadly changed. <persName ref="#Theo">Theo</persName> and the girls were away - but I showed him everything and we all had tea together. He 

Page 32

was pathetic - and I think we will hardly find him here next year. We are ready to get off tomorrow. I shall hate leaving my beautiful mountains and desert - our sand island has grown enormously - and the patches of wheat <persName ref="#Jones">Jones</persName> sowed for the fowls is now quite ornamental. But we do look forward to relief from  continual visitors. Our young moon already makes the nights glorious. 

Tuesday, Feb. 26.
     Mr. <persName ref="#Carter">Carter</persName>, <persName ref="#Jones">Ayrton</persName>, and <persName ref="#Robert">Robert</persName> came to say goodbye early - with over 2 policemen. We thought it best to ask for them, as we found our men were all in a funk about having so many treasures on board. We got away at noon. The Smiths are following us. We have made 23 miles. Tied up at 6:30.

Wednesday, Feb. 27.
     47 miles. We are lying this lovely night about 4 miles above <placeName ref="#">Kasr el Said</placeName> - having made a good record. It has been warm and the night is wonderful.

Thursday, Feb. 28.
     26 miles.	We reached <persName ref="#Naville">Nag Hamadi</persName> at 9 o’clock this morning - and had to wait for the bridge. The Smiths soon pulled up behind us - and the family came over, sweet babies and all, for a visit. <persName ref="#Jones">Joe</persName> has not yet joined them - telegraphed Mr. <persName ref="#Somers-Clark">Garstang</persName> at <placeName ref="#">Abydos</placeName> that we would reach there tomorrow. Passed the bridge at one o’clock.
