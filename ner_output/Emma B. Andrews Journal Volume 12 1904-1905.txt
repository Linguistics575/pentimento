S.S. Prinzess <persName ref="#">Irene</persName>.
	Nov. 27, 1904 - First Sunday in Advent.
     We left home very reluctantly on the 1st and went to <placeName ref="#">Boston</placeName> where we spent five charming days and on the 6th moved on to <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName> where we found that the <persName ref="#">Irene</persName> would be four days late in sailing in consequence of some accident to her machinery.  It was tremendously vexing to us, as we lost our <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> steamer to <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName> - and shall have to take our chance when we reach there, with what we can find.  I saw some old friends in <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName>, and made some pleasant visits, and to my great pleasure <persName ref="#">Mary Rogers</persName> who was staying in <placeName ref="#">Orange</placeName>, came over and spent two days with me.  I found my rooms (we came aboard the 16th and sailed early in the day) on the steamer most delightful - they are the Captain’s rooms - very good sitting room - big bed room, and adjoining bath room, on the level of the bridge, and I am all alone with only the sea, and the life boats about me, and the Captain near in the chart room.  It has been most delightful - and the quiet and the rest very precious.  During the first night, we ran into a heavy storm and high seas - which resolved itself into a cyclone, from which or out of which the Captain retreated by turning south, and running 100 miles out of his course.  I hadn’t a qualm of sickness, but I stayed in bed, as there was so much movement, and as <persName ref="#">Amelie</persName> was too ill to leave her room.  Up at this height I got more motion - and how the wind roared and shrieked! I have never heard anything like it.  The whole boat, as it were, took

Page 54

 to its bed.  Then followed two or three days of heavy rain - and then we emerged into comparatively calm seas and brilliant sunshine - I have a door opening from my sitting room on my own private deck, and one from my bath room, so that I get all the air I want - and my private view, as it were, at any moment I want the limitless sea, and the heavens, which are wonderful beyond description now at night, with the full moon, and perfectly cloudless.  This fine, steady steamer is not so fast as some - and we expected to take 12 days instead of 11 to <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> - which is the usual one - but the storms have so delayed us, that we did not reach <placeName ref="#">Gibraltar</placeName> until the 11th - yesterday - and we will make <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> only the day after tomorrow, the 14th day of the voyage, where <persName ref="#">Alice Wilson</persName> will join us for the winter.

Tuesday, Nov. 29.
	Grand Hotel - <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName>.
     <persName ref="#">Amelie</persName> called me at 6 o’clock this morning as I had asked her to - I love to see the early dawn on Vesuvius and the bay.  But it was thick and murky - damp and cold.  I had my last cup of coffee up in that little sky parlor of mine - and by that time I saw that <persName ref="#">Vesuvius</persName> was covered with snow - something I had never seen before - we landed about 11 o’clock - and were soon in our old rooms here, where <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> was waiting for us.  We found on the table of our sitting room, some lovely orchids with the card of kind Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Hanser</persName>.  The <persName ref="#">McKeever</persName> girls came to lunch with us - and then went back to the boat, bound for <orgName ref="#">Genoa</orgName> and <placeName ref="#">St. Moritz</placeName>.  The Longfellows, and Miss <persName ref="#">Hale</persName> are 

Page 55

here - and the Kissels - and the 2 boys <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> and <persName ref="#">Ream</persName>.

Dec. 9, 1904. <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>. Shepheards Hotel.
     We left <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> on Saturday, the 3d and made the weary, weary journey of 9 hours from there to <placeName ref="#">Brindisi</placeName> - <placeName ref="#">Miss Hale</placeName>, Mrs. <persName ref="#">Perkins</persName>, and Miss <persName ref="#">Morgan</persName> were along.  <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> took the girls and <persName ref="#">Ream</persName> and <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> to <placeName ref="#">Pompeii</placeName> one day at <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> - and one of the pleasantest things I did was visiting Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Hanser</persName> at their charming villa at <placeName ref="#">Posillipo</placeName>. They are such kind nice people.  One cold, windy afternoon we drove up to the <placeName ref="#">Vomero</placeName>, and after much searching found the Sprenger-Müller place which for 3 years I have been trying to discover.  But he was not at home, greatly to my regret - though Mrs. <persName ref="#">Hanser</persName> told me that as he was quite deaf, I would have found him difficult.  I wanted to see his garden and talk to him - for he is a noted hybridigia and floriculturist.  We had to spend the night and most of the day at that hideous hotel at <placeName ref="#">Brindisi</placeName> - which we thought worse than usual.  When we stumbled late at night out of the R.R. station, and got into the omnibus, <persName ref="#">Jean</persName>, <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> and I - we found it already occupied by a large man who said to me, “I guess we’re going to have some fresh Americans on board”; the girls said I replied in a chilling manner, “Yes, we are Americans” - “I thought so” he replied, it’s so nice to hear the real thing”! While we might all be proud of being Americans, I don’t think we relished being told in that nasal voice that we were the “real thing”. Over the miseries of that 3 days voyage I will not linger!  We were happy to land at <placeName ref="#">Port Said</placeName> at 9 o’clock A.M. Wednesday Dec. 7th, and soon were 

Page 56

journeying to <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> by the new and improved route - an hour shorter than formerly - met all our nice people and established in time for tea in our charming appartment here.

Monday, Dec. 12.
    Very busy getting the Beduin in order - and arranging to send <persName ref="#">Abdul</persName>, with his wife and child up to his native country <placeName ref="#">Dongola</placeName> - <persName ref="#">Abdul</persName> has recovered remarkably - and seems stronger than he has been for three years - but we found that he had been drinking a good deal - and we decided it was better for him to go back to his own people - and to a warmer climate where he will be free from temptation.  He has a bit of land there, and some palm trees, and <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> has arranged for <persName ref="#">Cook</persName> to send him money from time to time - and it seems a happy solution to the dondition which has given us a good deal of anxiety lately.

Friday, Dec. 16th.
     We came on board this morning - a cold day with strong South wind blowing - and of course no prospect of sailing - but we were so glad to give up hotel life, and take possession once more of this little home.  <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> did not seem very pleasant.  We had heavy fogs each morning - and yesterday we had a fire built in our sitting room.  We dined with Miss <persName ref="#">Morgan</persName> and her brothers one evening - and had a charming evening.  They have altered the Sandwith house - made it much larger - and is just finishing a magnificent ball room - one of the most lovely rooms of the kind I have ever seen.  The boys, <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> and <orgName ref="#">Ream</orgName>, have gone up the 

Page 57

river on one of Cooks steamers - Mr. <persName ref="#">Carter</persName> dined and lunched with us several times - and we spent the day with him at the <orgName ref="#">Mona House</orgName>, where he was staying.  He is quite settled in a pleasant appartment - and looks better and happier than he did.  We had tea one afternoon with Mrs. <persName ref="#">Packett</persName>, in her nice little home.  I liked her husband - and she seemed quieter and less gushing than the Miss <persName ref="#">Kirkbride</persName> we met a year ago on the steamer coming out here.

Saturday, Dec. 17th.
     Another day of south wind - and we have not moved.  Miss <persName ref="#">Morgan</persName> and her brother came this morning to see the boat.  The <persName ref="#">Ernest Longfellows</persName>, with Miss <persName ref="#">Hale</persName> and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Perkins</persName> are on the dahabya Agiz, with <persName ref="#">Salah</persName> as dragoman, going up, and waiting as we are for a favourable wind.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Carter</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#">Edgar</persName> dined with us.

Sunday, Dec. 18th.
     7 miles.	Came through the bridge yesterday and are lying near the British embassy.  <persName ref="#">Alice</persName>, <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> and I walked all about the streets near us this morning - they are so wide and well paved and shaded, that we found it very pleasant - we dared not go far from the boat, as the wind seemed at last to be changing.  Any number of really handsome houses have been built in this quarter.  At noon the wind fell - and it was quite warm - about 3:30 it came gently from the north, and we spread our sails and went away before it.  The Agiz also put out, and the <orgName ref="#">Isis</orgName>, with a <placeName ref="#">Boston</placeName> man, <persName ref="#">Brooks</persName>, with the Tucks, and

Page 58

 Miss <persName ref="#">Morgan</persName>, going to <placeName ref="#">Sakkarah</placeName>, also started.  We made about 6 miles, and are almost in sight of <placeName ref="#">Helouan</placeName>.  The afternoon has been beautiful - and we sailed gently along the island of <placeName ref="#">Rhodah</placeName> - the old dilapidated palaces looking so picturesque - and the evening lights so fine - the 3 boats are lying near each other tonight.

Monday, Dec. 19th.
     The Longfellows came over to see us this morning - and after we went aboard the Isis, and the Tucks and Miss <persName ref="#">Morgan</persName> came back with us to see the boat - we were then going to the Agiz to see Miss <persName ref="#">Hale</persName> and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Perkins</persName>, when we found their boat had started.  We were soon off in a light wind - the river was crowded with boats, and we got into a great mix with them, and one of them caught her boom into our beautiful white sail and tore two holes in it, so we were obliged to stop and repair damages: <orgName ref="#">Isis</orgName> and <persName ref="#">Agiz</persName> ahead of us.  We have made about 3 miles, and are lying opposite <persName ref="#">Tura</persName>.

Dec. 20th.- Tuesday.
     Cloudy with rain at times - wind <placeName ref="#">S.E.</placeName> and S.W. tracked - and have made probably a mile!

Dec. 21. Wednesday.
     Weather cold, squally and disagreeable - heavy clouds and contrary winds - and some difficult turns.  The Agiz has disappeared, we left the Isis at <placeName ref="#">Sakkarah</placeName> - made very little over 11 miles.

Page 59

Dec. 22d - Thursday.
     We began sailing about 11 o’clock - the wind grew strong and we went dashing along in rather an alarming way.  Then a sudden squall struck us - we had to drop our sails, and were driven to shore - a wildly exciting time getting our sails furled - and we lay the rest of the day rocking under bare poles.  As the evening drew on the wind fell, and we were able to cross the river and find a better place.  Such a heavenly night! a full moon - and grand palm trees above us on the bank.  Made 7 miles.

Friday, Dec. 23d.
     14 miles.	We did little until about 3 o’clock - when a light wind began and the <persName ref="#">Reis</persName> concluded to stop for the night - as the little dahabyah Bijou had pulled up behind us - with some of his friends in the crew.  But as a favourable wind began to rise <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> sent out word that they must be off - so up came our stakes and we started in a fair wind and kept on until about 5 o’clock - we came to a difficult bend in the river and stopped for the night.  Cold, with heavy clouds and some rain.  Discouraging!

Saturday, Dec. 24th.
     6 miles.	Adverse winds - and made our few miles by tracking.  A sharp rain last night.

Page 60

Dec. 25, Sunday. Christmas.
     A perfectly calm, but beautiful day and warm.  After our usual distribution of gifts - the men started their tracking, and we have made 11 miles.  This makes a week getting 56 miles.

Monday, Dec. 26th.
     10 miles.	Another delightful warm day - tracked all the morning.  About 4 this afternoon a light n. wind came, so that we sailed for 2 hours.  The river is full of birds - passed thousands of ducks today.  They are clever enough to lift just before danger approaches - I believe they recognize a dahabya - the only dangerous craft for them, as the natives in their boats never molest them.  The little, tidy unoccupied dahabya “Bijou” still keeps with us,

Tuesday, Dec. 27th.
     3 miles.	Which the poor men have made by continuous tracking.  Clear and cool.  The eastern desert and mountains made most lovely effects.

Wednesday, Dec. 28.
     6 miles.	When we started out at 8 o’clock this morning the wind was almost in our favour.  But again it failed and the men tracked all day - and were tired enough when <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> ordered that they should tie up at 5 o’clock.

Page 61

Thursday, Dec. 29.
     5 miles.	A little breeze and much tracking.

Friday, Dec. 30.
     5 miles.	The same history as yesterday, except the wind has been very strong - veering from S.E. to south.

Saturday, Dec. 31.
     4-1/2 miles.	A strong head wind - tracked and pulled to anchor.

Sunday, Jan. 1st, 1905.
     6 miles.	We had hoped for a change of luck to-day, but the conditions remain unchanged.  Day cool.

Monday, Jan. 2d.
     43 miles.	<placeName ref="#">Samalut</placeName>.  At last Fortune has given us a favourable wind - a light wind beginning early, grew into a steady, fine sailing wind - and we began leaving the miles behind us in a good old fashioned manner.  We soon passed <persName ref="#">Fashen</persName>, then <persName ref="#">Maghaghah</persName>, <persName ref="#">Matar</persName>, and <placeName ref="#">Kolosna</placeName>, and are now lying at <placeName ref="#">Samalut</placeName>, almost opposite the <persName ref="#">Gebel</persName> et Teu - with its Coptic convent.  Late in the afternoon we caught sight of the Agiz, in a bend of the river before us.

Tuesday, Jan. 3d.
     25 miles.	Another good, but light wind brought us about one 

Page 62

o’clock to Minia - where we stopped until 3:30 for mail and supplies.  <persName ref="#">Saleh</persName> was there this morning - he must have sailed well into the night.  The weather is growing milder.  A huge mail - and bad news again from <placeName ref="#">Milwaukee</placeName> - poor <persName ref="#">Gwynne</persName> again in hospital - very serious.  Dear <persName ref="#">Ettie</persName> continually in my thoughts.  Made five miles from <placeName ref="#">Minia</placeName>.

Wednesday, Jan. 4th.
     23 miles.	A gentle sailing breeze all day - occasionally dying out.  Passed <persName ref="#">Beni Hassan</persName> about 11 o’clock.  <persName ref="#">Rhodah</persName> at 3 - and are now within a mile or so of <placeName ref="#">Mellawie</placeName> - a charming really warm day.  We have been immersed in the newspapers - and in the extraordinary news of the protracted siege of <placeName ref="#">Port Arthur</placeName>.  What a slaughter - what heroism on the part of the Japanese - what hopeless demoralization and incompetency of the Russians - a harrowing thing to think of.

Thursday, Jan. 5.
     8 miles.	A warm, beautiful day - we are lying tonight about a mile above <placeName ref="#">Hag Kandil</placeName>.

Friday, Jan. 6th.
     26 miles.	A very exciting day - we began early in a gentle enough manner - but the wind steadily grew stronger and when we came to the great turn at the approach to the <persName ref="#">Gebel Abu Feda the Reis</persName> took to the bank and furled his sail.  There we stayed for 3

Page 63

 hours, when he thought it safe to go out again.  The river is now so full of gyassas, that sailing is sometimes risky - as we entered the part of the river under the cliffs, there were many of them about, and in the gale which broke upon us, we came nearly to our destruction by one of these bearing down upon us, quite unmanageable.  The shrieking of the wind, the cries of the sailors were exciting.  At one time we had 13 men on the boom trying to furl the sail - as soon as we found ourselves able, we dropped our anchors, and after, pulled to shore - thankful enough to make ourselves fast.  The worst experience we have ever had.

Saturday, Jan. 7.
     30 miles.	The gale continued all night - a fine north wind this morning which lasted all day, sailed calmly through the dam at <placeName ref="#">Asyut</placeName>, and stopped for our mail.  I did not go off the boat.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and the girls went for a walk, and met the Frasers - their boats are being repaired, and they are now living on a rented one.  An exquisite little moon has dawned upon us!

1st Sunday after Epiphany.	Jan. 8th.
     64 miles.	A wonderful day for us.  We began in a light favourable wind at 7:30 and we have gone on splendidly and uninterruptedly the whole day in spite of many awkward turns - passed the 2 dahabyas which started out before us at <placeName ref="#">Asyut</placeName> - and about 1 o’clock overhauled the Agiz on the sand - exchanged passing greetings

Page 64

and offered help - but she was soon off and after us and only arrived where we are an hour and a half after we had tied up.  <persName ref="#">Saleh</persName> came in this evening to say all was well - they were 2 hours on the sand.

Jan. 9th - Monday.
     34-1/2 miles.	We had a letter from <persName ref="#">Mary Higby</persName> at <placeName ref="#">Asyût</placeName>, telling of <persName ref="#">Gwynne</persName>’s better condition.  Last night was very cold.  <persName ref="#">Amelie</persName> brought in to show me <persName ref="#">Billy</persName>’s bowl of water which always stands on deck, frozen solid!  the second occurrence of the kind we have known on the Nile.  The mercury was 49 in my room.  But the day has been warm and splendid - and the little new moon and <persName ref="#">Venus</persName> close to her made such a splendid picture just above a group of 3 solitary palms on the bank that I could not get my usual nap before dinner.

Tuesday, Jan. 10th.
     18 miles.	Nagh Hamadi - which we reached by 4 o’clock of course finding the bridge closed.  The <persName ref="#">Agiz</persName> drew up about an hour later and <persName ref="#">Miss Hale</persName> and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Perkins</persName> came over to see us.

Wednesday, Jan. 11th. Kasr es Sayd.
     8 miles.	We sailed through the bridge at 9 o’clock this morning.  When we came to the great bend of the river here, we could go no further - and were obliged to tie up against a very high bank.  The Agiz had to do the same - we went over to see  [the page is cut off].

Page 65

Thursday, Jan. 12th.
     26 miles.	We are about four miles below <placeName ref="#">Keneh</placeName> tonight, we have been sailing since 6 o’clock.  The Reis finding a light favourable wind blowing at that time, got off very quietly - I, of course, from my room, heard the preparations, and lifting a corner of my curtain looked out.  And what a sense of wonderful beauty was before me.  The bold range of cliffs behind <persName ref="#">Keneh</persName>, were standing transfused with a luminous rose colour - their bases all in blue darkness and shadow - and we were sailing over a gold, pink river - the reflection from the big mountain stretching to where we were lying.  A splendid wonder it was!

Friday, Jan. 13th.
     23 miles.     We have had a diversified day of wind - strong and light - and calms - and have made our miles by every known craft of Nile sailorship. The Agiz has been near us most of the time - though yesterday we beat her 4 hours.

Saturday, Jan. 14th.
     16-1/2 miles. We have worked hard all day - hoping to reach <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName>, as we were last within a mile of <placeName ref="#">Nagada</placeName>.  But winds were very light and contrary and we tracked most of the time.  The Agiz, and <persName ref="#">Bijou</persName> being behind us - until, about one o’clock a great bend in the river brought our boat to a standstill - and the others with their keels were able to hold on - and passed us - we have all been tracking ever since - the others about a mile before us.  The weather

Page 66

has been both hot and cold - the sun quite powerful - and the wind keen and cold.

2d Sunday after Epiphany.
     Jan. 15. <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName>. 6 miles.
     We tracked and pulled through a perfect calm this morning - until just as we came to the town a good breeze sprang up, and we sailed up to our old place on the sand island - and have a beautiful view of the mountains.  The Agiz came along half an hour after, and went across just under the castle, where we used to go.  Very few dahabyas here - and the town very quiet.

Monday, Jan. 16.
     Very busy this morning, settling etc. a great scrubbing going on outside and inside - and a wash literally of 4 weeks.  <persName ref="#">Billy</persName> enjoys our island enormously and spends his time chasing the birds, and barking at all comers.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> went over to the town this morning - paid a visit to <persName ref="#">Mohamed Mohassib - Theo</persName> reports him still grieving for his son - and looking very old and sad.  Mrs. <persName ref="#">Quibell</persName> came in this afternoon looking so very well.  Mr. Q. arrives tonight from <placeName ref="#">Aswân</placeName>.

Tuesday, Jan. 17th.
     <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> and I went over to town this morning and paid a visit to Miss <persName ref="#">Buchanan</persName> and <placeName ref="#">Nubeewya</placeName> - Miss B. a little pale and tired looking - Nubeewya quite the reverse.  Their new building begins to make quite a

Page 67

showing at the lower end of the town.  The second story is almost ready for the roof, and the first will be ready for occupation by the 1st of March.  <persName ref="#">Nubeewya</persName> was very happy to see me again - Miss B. had written me that she had asked to be baptized - it was just after they came back from Ramleh in September.  <placeName ref="#">Nubeewya</placeName> went to Miss B. and said, “I want to be a Christian” “I don’t believe in our <persName ref="#">Prophet</persName> any more, but I believe in your Christ”. Miss B. had always refrained from talking to her of her religion - so she said “why do you want to be a Christian?” “Because all the good, kind people I know are Christians”. She has become they tell me a joy in the house - what a transformation for a little savage 3 years ago! Mrs. <persName ref="#">Perkins</persName> and <persName ref="#">Miss Hale</persName> to lunch.

Wednesday, Jan. 18.
     A rather warm still day - Theo went over to <placeName ref="#">Der el Bahari</placeName> to see <persName ref="#">M. Naville</persName>.  The Agiz started up the river today, towing.

Thursday, Jan. 19.
     A quiet day at home - and busy - Mrs. <persName ref="#">Miller</persName> and Capt. <persName ref="#">Miller</persName> with their two girls called this evening.  They had sent a letter introductory a few days since from Mr. <persName ref="#">John Parsons</persName> of <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName>.  Pleasant people - first visit in <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName> - though Capt. <persName ref="#">Miller</persName> formerly of the navy had been with <persName ref="#">Grant</persName> in his trip around the world, and stopped at <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>.

Page 68

Friday, Jan. 20th.
     Rather warmer today - <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> and the Millers rode over to <persName ref="#">Medinet Abu - Alice</persName> and I to see Miss <persName ref="#">Buchanan</persName> and afterwards to the <placeName ref="#">Luxor Hotel</placeName> for tea with the <orgName ref="#">Misses Collins - Nice</orgName>, simple Scotch bodies they are, I like them.

Saturday, Jan. 21st.
     We have had a long days excursion to the Tombs of the <orgName ref="#">Kings</orgName>.  Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Quibell</persName> met us and lunched with us.  The Millers went along, but did not lunch with us.  A lot of people over there, so we went up to the Thothmes IV plateau, and had our lunch there.  A splendid vantage ground - but a cool wind was blowing - neither I or Mrs. <persName ref="#">Quibell</persName> went down into any of the Tombs - and I came home early.  I was in my chair and the donkeys were not very good.  And the detestable Sugar people have spoiled every thing on this side.  Those lovely rides we used to have through those smiling fields, are gone now forever!  They have built canals and railways to carry their sugar cane - and the jolting, noisy little trains are always hustling up and down with their loads of sugar cane.  It was quite an unwarrantable usurpation too, everyone says.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Edgar</persName> also lunched with us - and <persName ref="#">Jones</persName> took a lot of interesting photographs.

3d Sunday after Epiphany - Jan. 22.
     A quiet day at home.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Quibell</persName> dined with us.

Page 69

Monday, Jan. 23d.
     A really cold day, with high blustering winds - in spite of which <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> and the girls went over again to the Mentuhotop temple - and stopped for tea with Mr. <persName ref="#">Quibell</persName>. M. and Mme. <persName ref="#">Naville</persName> dined with us.  They are a pair of giants - and handsome ones too, and we found them very pleasant.  He is much pleased with the lift <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> has given him for the Temple.  A gift of £100 - it seems the <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName> Ex. So. is at present much hampered by lack of funds.  <persName ref="#">Petrie</persName>, who is excavating at <placeName ref="#">Mt. Sinai</placeName>, everyone thinks unwisely, claims most of the money the <orgName ref="#">Society</orgName> has for his work - he has so embroiled himself with all his surroundings, natives decline working for him - and steal almost everything he has - assistants leave him etc.  So it was feared that the every interesting work at the Mentuhotep temple would have to stop for a time.  The Navilles go over there to stay, tomorrow, in the fine house the German Government has built there and I was so amused when he replied to <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName>’s question of “Are you quite alone there?” “Practically yes - there is a <placeName ref="#">Göttingen</placeName> man there by the name of <placeName ref="#">Sethe</placeName>” - as this is an awesome name to the German archaeological world, it seemed very funny.

Tuesday, Jan. 24.
     Another disagreeable day of cold and wind.  The Millers to lunch.  We have been living in such exciting interest for weeks in the Russio-Japanese war.  “Has Port Arthur fallen?” has been the question with which we have greeted each mail.  Then came the news of its disgraceful capitulation - the incredible evidences of the rottenness of 

Page 70

of the Russian government - army - navy - individuals!  Never in all history has there been so disgraceful an exposés of a peoples dishonor and perfidy.  Today came the telegram of the revolutionary disturbances in <placeName ref="#">St. Petersburg</placeName>! - harrowing in its sadness!

Wednesday, Jan. 25.
     A cold S. wind all day.  The young men, <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> and <orgName ref="#">Ream</orgName>, appeared this morning, arriving from <placeName ref="#">Aswân</placeName> last evening.  They are at the <placeName ref="#">Luxor Hotel</placeName>.  They all went over to the Tombs of the <orgName ref="#">Kings</orgName> this afternoon.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> tells me he has arranged with Mr. <persName ref="#">Quibell</persName> to quit work up where they are in the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> - and to send the men to join those already working up north of the Tomb of Amenhotep II.

Thursday, Jan. 26th.
     The Millers came to say goodbye.  <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> and I went to Miss <persName ref="#">Buchanans</persName> for tea - such a pleasant visit - and <placeName ref="#">Nubeewaya</placeName> so delightful and astounding.  <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> and <persName ref="#">Ream</persName> dined with us.  Bridge of course followed; high winds.

Friday, Jan. 27.
     A nice quiet day - the rest went to Tombs of <placeName ref="#">Queens</placeName> - then back here to tea.  Very cold.

Saturday, Jan. 28.
     The whole cavalcade went to <placeName ref="#">Karnak</placeName>.  I took my exercise with

Page 71

<persName ref="#">Billy</persName> on the sands.

4th Sunday after Epiphany. Jan. 29.
     A quiet pleasant day for me.  Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Joe Smith</persName> came to dine.

Monday, Jan. 30.
     I have been very busy all day with <persName ref="#">Paul</persName>’s Rose Catalogue - getting up my rose list for this year.  There are such complex questions about <persName ref="#">Rose</persName> growing at the Reef. Just before the night fell I noticed a strange looking dahabya pulling up at the bank opposite us - quite new to me, - the “Sahabiha” flying the Stars and Stripes - and soon after the lamps were lighted, who should appear but Dr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Campbell</persName>!  We were so glad to see them - and they have the Sahabiha - it is a boat built for the <placeName ref="#">Khedives</placeName> mother, and of course on the hareem lines.  They too, took a month for coming up.

Tuesday, Jan. 31.
     Cool.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> had gone with 3 boys - young <persName ref="#">Arrowsmith</persName> and 2 others from <placeName ref="#">Groton</placeName>, with a letter from Mr. <persName ref="#">Gardiner</persName>.

Thursday, Feb. 2d.
     Two very quiet days - the Picketts from <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>, who are here in their R.R. car, dined with us.

Page 72

Friday, Feb. 3d.
     We were at home all day, until in the afternoon we visited the Agiz, who arrived today - then to the <persName ref="#">Sabiha</persName> to see the <orgName ref="#">Campbells</orgName>.  They have an interesting and rather pretty little boat - built in the Hareem style - it was built and belongs to the <placeName ref="#">Khedives</placeName> mother.  A visit from <persName ref="#">M. Maspero</persName> after we got home - and <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> and <persName ref="#">Ream</persName> came for bridge in the evening.  <persName ref="#">Maspero</persName>’s dined with us and the Abbé Thèodant.

Fifth Sunday after Epiphany. Feb. 5th.
     <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> and <persName ref="#">Ream</persName> came to breakfast - <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> went over with them afterwards to church.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Ayrton</persName> to lunch and a visit from the Agiz people, who came to tea, and we made Mrs. <persName ref="#">Perkins</persName> and Miss <persName ref="#">Hale</persName> stay for dinner.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> went immediately after lunch with Mr. <persName ref="#">Ayrton</persName> over to the Quibells and the busy day came to an end.

Monday, Feb. 6th.
     A very windy day - Theo and the girls in spite of it, went over to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>, where when <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> appeared the workmen greeted him with a cheer, and he knew it meant some sign of promise - and the men had found the lintel of a door to a tomb.  They said they might clear it to the entrance in a few days.  Very encouraging.

Tuesday, Feb. 7th.
     A calm, warm day.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> came back from <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> this noon, with a most beautiful statuette in silver he had bought of <placeName ref="#">Mohassib</placeName>.  In 

Page 73

style and treatment it suggests that Egyptian statuette in bronze and silver, the <persName ref="#">Lady Takûshit</persName>, now in <placeName ref="#">Athens</placeName> and shown in the “Struggle of Nations” by <persName ref="#">Maspero</persName>.  <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> and <persName ref="#">Ream</persName> went with <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#">Weigal</persName>, who had lunched here, to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>, and the two first dined with us.  Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Joe Smith</persName> came in during the evening.

Friday, Feb. 10.
     This is the third day of cold, strong S. wind we have had.  Sand flying in clouds. There was literally no stirring abroad.

Saturday, Feb. 11th.
     <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName> went over to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> today; several steps leading to the door of the tomb uncovered.  Weigall came in for tea - after which <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> went over to the <persName ref="#">Miriam</persName> to see <persName ref="#">M. Maspero</persName> about the tomb, <persName ref="#">Quibell</persName> being away.  He authorized Theo to open it, and Mr. <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName> will look after it.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> wrote Mrs. <persName ref="#">Quibell</persName> about it, explaining.

6th Sunday after Epiphany - Feb. 12.
     A Mr. <persName ref="#">Porch</persName> came to lunch with Mr. <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName>.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> met him the other day.  He is English, a devoté to flints.  He has been encamped near <placeName ref="#">Gûrna</placeName>, at the mouth of a little rock tomb, he is a handsome agreeable little fellow - seems to know every one - and especially all <placeName ref="#">Italy</placeName> and Italians.  He travels everywhere with an Italian servant who would seem to be a half savant.  His ancestral home in <placeName ref="#">England

Page 74</placeName>

is Glastenbury Abbey - he goes very soon to <placeName ref="#">India</placeName> - with this servant and a camel he has come all the way from the <placeName ref="#">Red Sea</placeName> to <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName>.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName> rode over to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> of the <orgName ref="#">Kings</orgName> this afternoon - when <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> got home he brought with him two or three queer parcels - and he had an air of great elation.  He first unwrapped a yoke of a chariot, finely decorated in gold and colour - in perfect condition, then a long baton, or wand of office - also finely decorated - then produced a large beautiful green, hard stone scarab, with gilded bands, beautifully inscribed even to the wings.  He said that the workmen had reached the door of the tomb chamber, and they went down into it.  A small aperture had been broken in this door, large enough to admit a man.  This door was of stone, plastered with mud - with many seals on it - and the tomb had been broken into in ages gone by - for the things Theo found in the corridor and brought home, had no doubt been dropped by the thieves.  <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName> remained behind, to sleep with the guards at the tomb, and Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> also went over to stay with him.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> wrote a note to <persName ref="#">M. Maspero</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#">Sayce</persName> who arrived on the <orgName ref="#">Istar</orgName> yesterday, to come and see the things.  They all came over in the evening.  Mrs. <persName ref="#">Sheldon Amos</persName>, who is staying with Mr. <persName ref="#">Sayce</persName>, also came.

Monday, Feb. 13th.
     We all made an early start for the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> this morning.  <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> has not been feeling very well for a few days - and was so melancholy at the idea of being left behind on the opening day of the tomb, that I persuaded <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> to send for one of the <orgName ref="#">Victorias</orgName> that occasionally take people over - and she and I rode over most comfortably.  We had to 

Page 75

go on our donkeys across the wide sand waste - and then take the carriage and we had to get out for the ascent and the descent of the high canal embankment.  But the moment we entered the valley, the going was very good.  We found <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName> and the Smiths, the native Inspector, and <persName ref="#">Maspero</persName> and his Secretary soon arrived.  The inner door was ordered down - and while it was being done, <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#">M. Maspero</persName> made a long hot climb to look at a certain site the latter thought favourable - and the rest of us sat on the rocks, or in the carriage from which the horses had been taken.  Mrs. <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> who was wildly enthusiastic about the whole thing, said that the night had been one of the most beautiful she had ever spent.  They felt the cold very much, and got up twice to make tea - and again very early and climbed to one of the highest points to see the sun rise.  In half an hour the native Inspector came out of the tomb and said to <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName> “the entrance is free”. He and Mr. <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> went down, and in a short time <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName> came up pale and breathless.  I thought he had been affected by bad air - but it was only excitement - for he ejaculated “wonderful” “extraordinary” etc.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> said, “there is everything there but a grand piano., - the place is crowded with furniture and coffins”.  We waited until <persName ref="#">M. Maspero</persName> and <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> were back, when they at once went down and stayed a long time.  The tomb was so accessible, opening by its first flight of steps on a level with the pathway - from which a short descending corridor leads to another short stairway, which gives immediate access to the tomb chamber.  It lies just between No’s 3 and 4 - the former an unfinished tomb intended for Ramses III - 4 also unfinished - the tomb of Ramses XII.  Neither <persName ref="#">M. Maspero</persName> or Quibell thought

Page 76

this site worth working, but <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> in his thorough way said he should go on clearing up both sides of that side valley - and it was just by this method that he found the tomb of Thothmes IV and <persName ref="#">Hatshepsut</persName>.  it is remarkable that this tomb, crowded in between 3 and 4 could have escaped complete spoilation.  When these men at last appeared they told us wondrous tales, and allowed us one by one to go down - by the light of candles I could see a dim glitter of gold everywhere and a confusion of coffins and mummies.  Arrangements were made at once for bringing electric wires into the tomb, as the Duke of Connaught was expected in the afternoon and <persName ref="#">M. Maspero</persName> was very pleased to be able to give him such a sight.  Then we all went up to the Thothmes IV plateau, where <persName ref="#">Jones</persName> had lunch for us.  Too soon after this <persName ref="#">M. Maspero</persName> and <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> started for the tomb again in the hot sun -- and we followed.  They went immediately into it - and when in about 20 minutes I saw one rushing up and demanding water and brandy, I knew that <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> must have fainted as he did a few years ago, under exactly the same circumstances.  When I reached the first flight of steps, I saw that two people were supporting him at the bottom step, bathing his head and hands.  He called up to me however that he was about over it - and was soon able to be helped up - and took refuge in the carriage - and soon seemed none the worse for it.  About 4 o’clock, the <persName ref="#">Duke</persName> and his party arrived with a military escort - and went down into the tomb.  We had withdrawn to a respectful distance and were sitting on the rocks - when the <orgName ref="#">Duke</orgName>, a fine soldierly looking fellow and <persName ref="#">M. Maspero</persName> emerged.  The <orgName ref="#">Duke</orgName> strode over the rocks to where <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> was, and heartily congratulated him, and begged to 

Page 77

present him to the Duchess.  After they left, Mr. <persName ref="#">Quibell</persName> came very much disgruntled, to find the tomb had been opened in his absence.  <persName ref="#">M. Maspero</persName> discovered by the various inscriptions in the tomb, that it was the burial place of <placeName ref="#">Yuaa</placeName> and <placeName ref="#">Tuaa</placeName>, the father and mother of the great <persName ref="#">Queen Tyi</persName>, wife of Amenhotep III.  The cartouche of this king is on many of these things - and that of a daughter of his - Set-amen.  All the objects so far as they have been seen, are in perfect order and good and very beautiful.

Tuesday, Feb. 14th.
     Another day with all the family again to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>.  Again I had the carriage and took Mme. <persName ref="#">Maspero</persName> with me.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Sayce</persName> and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Sheldon Amos</persName> also went over - and we had an open lunch table at the <placeName ref="#">Thothmes</placeName> plateau - all of these, with the Abbe Théadant, <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName>, <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> and <persName ref="#">Ayrton</persName>.  After we got home, Capt. <persName ref="#">Watson</persName> of the <orgName ref="#">Duke</orgName>’s party called, also <persName ref="#">Maspero</persName>, <placeName ref="#">Lacau</placeName>, and the Abbé.  Sir <persName ref="#">John</persName> and <persName ref="#">Lady Evans</persName> dined with us.  The tomb was visited today by the <persName ref="#">Ex-Empress Eugénie</persName>, and also by Prince <persName ref="#">Gustave Adolphe</persName> of <placeName ref="#">Sweden</placeName>.  He and <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> seem to have struck up quite a friendship.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> was much pleased with him - a sensible, intelligent young fellow.  He was very enthusiastic over what he saw, and said, “Moi, Je suis aussi explorer - je fouille dans mon pays - si ca m’arrivera de venir ice pour fouiller comme vous!”  One of his aid-de-camps after sent Mr. <persName ref="#">Davis</persName> a note thanking him again and again.  Also the Duke and Duchess of <placeName ref="#">Devonshire</placeName> saw it.

Page 78

Wednesday, Feb. 15.
     <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#">Sayce</persName> went over to the tomb and spent the day - we stayed at home - a calm day - <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> sent his Thothmes book to the Duke of Connaught.  In the evening after he got back, Capt. <persName ref="#">Yarde-Buller A.D.C.</persName> to his <orgName ref="#">H.R.H.</orgName> called to thank him, and afterwards Capt. <persName ref="#">Watson</persName> came in and joined him.  Capt. <persName ref="#">W.</persName> was very entertaining with his talk about his experiences - having been with <placeName ref="#">Kitchener</placeName> through the whole of the campaign in the <placeName ref="#">Soudan</placeName>.  <persName ref="#">M. Lacau</persName> dined with us.

Thursday, Feb. 16.
     A warm, calm day - over to the Valley again, but I in my donkey chair.  I saw the different things found in the tombs well today for the first time - as they had been brought out of the tomb and placed in that of Ramses XII.  The most wonderful and varied collection of beautiful things in perfect condition.  The 2 mummies of <placeName ref="#">Yuaa</placeName> and Tuaa, well preserved and very impressive, despite the fact that <persName ref="#">Tuaa</persName>’s eyes are wide open.  They had double coffins of the finest workmanship literally overlaid with gold - chairs, boxes, 3 funeral couches, vases, scarabs, a great roll of papyrus, etc etc.  extraordinarily rich - a wonderful find.  At 3 o’clock Theo received a note from Capt. Waters, which had been sent over from the dahabya, saying their Royal Highnesses would be glad to come about 5 o’clock to the boat if it would be convenient.  So we had to drop everything, order out donkeys, and hurry home the 7 miles.  We had just time to wash our faces, and take off our hats, when they arrived, also in riding dress.  The <orgName ref="#">Duke</orgName>, Duchess, their daughter

Page 79

Princess <persName ref="#">Margaret</persName>, a Lady in Waiting and Capt. <persName ref="#">Buller</persName>.  I never met simpler, pleasanter people.  They were very much interested in every thing - and it was queer to see them in my room, which they declared lovely.  They stayed over an hour, and evidently enjoyed themselves, and parted most fraternally from Theodore - Gen. Sir <persName ref="#">John Maxwell</persName> was also with them.  M. and Mme. <persName ref="#">Maspero</persName>, the Abbé, called to say goodbye as they start down the river tomorrow.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Sayce</persName> and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Amos</persName> also called.

Friday, Feb. 17.
     A quiet day and evening at home!  Lovely!

Saturday, Feb. 18.
     <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and the girls went to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> again - <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName> came back with them and had tea.  He still sleeps at the tomb.  M. and Mme. <persName ref="#">Naville</persName> to tea.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Sayce</persName> dined with us.  He starts down on Monday.  We start for <persName ref="#">Aswân</persName> tomorrow - I don’t know for what unless to give <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> a rest.  We can only stay a day or two.

Septuagesima Sunday - Feb. 19.
     9 miles.	Mr. <persName ref="#">Ayrton</persName> came to breakfast - we were off at noon, and with difficulty reached Erment. It is so nice to be free of people once more.

Page 80

Monday, Feb. 20.
     42 miles.	A beautiful warm day - we are about a mile below <placeName ref="#">El Kab</placeName>.

Tuesday, Feb. 21.
     53 miles.	A fine sailing day - we are from 2 to 3 miles below <placeName ref="#">Kom Ombo</placeName>.

Wednesday, Feb. 22.	Aswân.
     28-1/2 miles.	We arrived about 3 o’clock - and have ever since been wondering why we came.  But the dry, warm air is delicious, and so are the red-yellow sands.  Are lying at our old island.

Thursday, Feb. 23.
     <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> and I have been home all day - the girls went to the Barrage this afternoon with Amelie - wind.

Friday, Feb. 24.
     A very high wind all day.  Girls lunched at the <orgName ref="#">Cataract Hotel</orgName> with the <orgName ref="#">Boston Hooper</orgName> girls - who came over to the boat late in the afternoon.  Dr. <persName ref="#">Morrall</persName> called this morning.  The girls and I with <persName ref="#">Jones</persName> were at the <placeName ref="#">Bazaar</placeName> this morning - <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> and I went for tea to the Savoy - and had it in the garden back of the hotel.  it was charming - the gardens are of real extent, and wonderfully improved.  So much more attractive 

Page 81

than the Cataract Hotel.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> has been trying to find a tug - but failed.

Saturday, Feb. 25.
     12 miles.	We got off at 7:30 and are now within 14 miles of <placeName ref="#">Kom Ombo</placeName> - a really warm day.

Sexigesima Sunday. Feb. 26.
     26 miles.	The men have worked nobly from since 4 o’clock this morning - working most of the time - we are lying 3 miles above <placeName ref="#">Silsileh</placeName>.

Monday, Feb. 27.
     40-1/2 miles.	The men began at 3 o’clock, and have rowed until 6 P.M.	We passed 3 dahabyas going up.  Near El Kab.

Tuesday, Feb. 28.
     38 miles.	We have had a warm day and evening - many clouds about - fear N. wind tomorrow.  Gebelen.

Wednesday, March  1st.
     9 miles.	We have had such gales of wind today, and have worked along in all sorts of ways, but have only reached Erment, or a little below it, and tied up at 6 o’clock.

Page 82

<placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> - March 2nd. - Thursday.
     Starting very early this morning we reached our old mooring place on the sand opposite the Castle, at 8 o’clock.  <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> looks quite deserted.  We were a little over 5 days coming down.  We found the <orgName ref="#">Campbells</orgName> here, and they came over to see us at once.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName> also came in with many interesting things to say.  Quite warm - we all rode over to <placeName ref="#">Der el Bahari</placeName> - and had tea with Mr. <persName ref="#">Ayrton</persName> at the little stone house.  I saw for the first time the beautiful sarcophagus found by <persName ref="#">Naville</persName> on the terrace of the Mentuhotep temple - of one of the “favourites” of the King - Kau-it - quite exquisite.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Ayrton</persName> says there were several graves found.  I think he said 7 - three of them bearing names of which the above was one - the rest were nameless.  <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> and I came directly home, but <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> went on to the Quibells.  The <orgName ref="#">Campbells</orgName> started down the river this afternoon.

Friday, March 3rd.
     Very warm.  <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> off to <placeName ref="#">Karnak</placeName> this morning.  The boxes began arriving from the tomb this morning, and were taken to a big felucca just behind us. It looked quite awful to see the long line of men, staggering over those wide burning sands, in that hot sun, carrying such loads.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Quibell</persName> and <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName> came with them, and the latter in to lunch with us.  It will be impossible to get them all over today.  There were several policemen - and Mr. <persName ref="#">Quibell</persName> and a force will sleep there tonight.  <persName ref="#">Ayrton</persName> came to dine.  I had expected Miss <persName ref="#">Buchanan</persName> and <placeName ref="#">Nubaweeya</placeName> to tea this afternoon and was so disappointed that they were 

Page 83

prevented.  <persName ref="#">M. Lacau</persName> was here however, and Miss Insinger.  To tea with Miss <persName ref="#">Buchanan</persName>, <persName ref="#">Theo</persName>, <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> and I, and had such a pleasant visit.

Saturday, March 4th.
     A very hot day - we all went over to <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> and met the Forbes-Leiths, who are coming to dine tonight.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> has arranged with the <orgName ref="#">Sugar Co. of Nag Hamadi</orgName>, to give us a tug on the 8th.  We have had a charming dinner - Mrs. <persName ref="#">Forbes-Leith</persName> - Col. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Burn</persName> (her daughter and son-in-law) and  Mrs. <persName ref="#">Tweedah</persName>.  They were delighted with everything here.  We get off tomorrow.

Quinquagesima Sunday.	March 5th.
     We did not get off this morning, as a gale from the north was raging.  <persName ref="#">Weigall</persName> here for breakfast.  We had waffles - which he said always seemed to him like eating “warm pillows”.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Ayrton</persName> came in late this afternoon, with the Capt. from <persName ref="#">Kons</persName>, with whom he had been to look at the huge prehistoric cemetery up near <placeName ref="#">Kom Ombo</placeName>.  It is supposed to be a secret - and he reported most favourably about it - and says it has the appearance of being absolutely untouched.  He will begin work upon it at once for <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName>.  The Quibells called to say goodbye.  Altogether we have been at <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> this year 5 weeks and 3 days.

Monday March 6th.
     22-1/2 miles.	We got off this morning at 7 o’clock - in almost a calm - but had to give up rowing and begin floating 

Page 84

before we were out of sight of <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> - and so we have come along, and are now near <placeName ref="#">Nagada</placeName> - day has been very cool.

Tuesday, March 7th.
     28 miles.	The usual north wind has prevailed today - but in spite of it we are now lying nearly opposite <persName ref="#">Keneh</persName>, having been driven to the bank at 5 o’clock, with our nose down stream.  The wind is howling tonight - everything is banging and rattling.  We are hoping our tug may come to meet us tomorrow.

Ash-Wednesday, Mar. 8th.
     We laid at our place of last night, until a few minutes before 3 o’clock, our tug appeared - and soon we were swiftly and smoothly putting the miles behind us - until at 8 o’clock, we had tied up at <placeName ref="#">Nag Hamadi</placeName> - very cold - and high winds.

Thursday, Mar. 9th.
     51 miles.	Passed the bridge at 8:30 and pulled up on the other side for mail, marketing etc.  Got a huge mail bag of letters and papers - and were soon off - the tug is a powerful one, and we have come 51 miles since 9:30 - against this northern gale.  It has been astounding to see the towns appear one after the other.  First Balliana, where were lying the <persName ref="#">Sabiha</persName> with the <orgName ref="#">Campbells</orgName>, and the <placeName ref="#">Zenet-el-Nil</placeName> with the Birds - we had  only time to wave to them as we rushed by.  Then came Girga - and then Menshia appeared as if by magic - then 

Page 85

we were upon Akmim - and about 5:30 pulled up at <placeName ref="#">Sohag</placeName>.  The sky has been filled with clouds - no sunshine - and the exquisite little moon seen tonight for the first time.  Passed the <orgName ref="#">Isis</orgName>, and the Ammon-Ra, late in the afternoon.

Friday, Mar. 10th.
     73 miles.	Started at 6:30 much of the time a high wind - and cold.  The thermometer in my room was at 50 this morning - but the air most delicious - with a bright sun, and almost a winters crispness in the air.  The tug went on the sand for a few minutes this morning.  Made Asyût about 3 o’clock - having passed the Bijou with the <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> family aboard this side of Aboutig.  Got our mail at <placeName ref="#">Asyût</placeName> - had an exciting time getting through the <persName ref="#">Weir</persName>.  Heard that Mr. <persName ref="#">Sayce</persName> left <placeName ref="#">Asyût</placeName> yesterday.

Saturday, Mar. 11th.
     88 miles.	A cold north wind all day - tug was twice on the sand.  We passed Mr. <persName ref="#">Sayce</persName> just above <placeName ref="#">Rada</placeName> - and pulled up at <placeName ref="#">Minia</placeName> at 5:30 at the edge of the wide sand bank that lies in front of the town -which seems to make a general promenade, and playground for the town - many boys engaged in football.

First Sunday in Lent, Mar. 12th.
     64-1/2 miles.	Fashen.  We have had a difficult river in places today - and a crowd of gyassas, so that we had to 

Page 86

leave the tug, and the men rowed a short distance to <placeName ref="#">Fashen</placeName>.  Were detained 3 hours at <placeName ref="#">Sheik Fadle</placeName>, the tug getting coal.

Wasta - Monday, Mar. 13th.
     37 miles.	We dismissed our tug as by agreement at <placeName ref="#">Wasta</placeName> - where we arrived at noon, and have had to wait, as the N. wind was so strong.

Tuesday, Mar. 14.
     30 miles.	We started at 7 this morning - not being in a hurry now to reach <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>.  It has been cool, but most delightful - the air having such a delicious quality, and we did so enjoy being without a tug.

Wednesday, Mar. 15th.
     11 miles.	We pulled up here at <placeName ref="#">Bedresheyn</placeName> at 6 o’clock - such a pretty resting place - with the splendid palms characteristic of this neighborhood above us across the sand.  We stopped about a mile above <placeName ref="#">Helouan</placeName> on the opposite side for an hour to rest the men this afternoon, and had a charming walk through the fields and among the palms - and saw on the high road just beyond us, the carriages, omnibusses, automobiles, and other horrid evidences of civilization.

Page 87

Thursday, Mar. 16th.
     We have had the day at <placeName ref="#">Sakara</placeName> - it was hot.  About 40 people lunching at <persName ref="#">Mariette</persName>’s house.  I did not go to a single tomb - having gone only for the ride which is so beautiful until you reach the desert and even then, that great plateau of wavy, undulating, uncompromising desert, has its impressiveness - and always its splendid air.  But those paths through those great palm forests, and the fertile fields is charming beyond description.  But it was not coming home - the donkeys in my chair were miserable, tired to death poor things by the hard service of the winter - and the donkey boys vociferous and unpleasant, and I was glad to reach the comfort of the shaded deck, tea, and <persName ref="#">Billy</persName>’s affectionate greetings.

Friday, Mar. 17.
     15 miles.	<placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>.  We reached here at 11:30 - got through the bridge in the usual exciting manner, and tied up in our old quarters beneath the Ghezireh Palace Hotel at 3 o’clock.  Very hot.  Weigall down from <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> for his exams - dined with us.

Saturday, Mar. 18.
     Home all day.  <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName>, <persName ref="#">Jones</persName> and the men, carried by boat over to the museum this morning the antiquities we brought down from <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName>.  I was glad to get rid of them.

Second Sunday in Lent, Mar. 19.
     Col. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Watson</persName> and baby to tea this afternoon.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Edgar</persName> came in and Mr. <persName ref="#">Carter</persName> down from <placeName ref="#">Tanta</placeName> to dine and talk our affairs over with Theo - he looks wretched.

Monday, Mar. 20.
     Wasted the morning in <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>.

Tuesday, Mar. 21.
     A cold disagreeable day - with gale - thunder and lightning.  The 3 <persName ref="#">Hooper</persName> girls of <placeName ref="#">Boston</placeName> dined with us - very nice people.  To the Museum this morning, to see the things from the tomb which are now pretty well unpacked.  A whole, large room has been given them.  The Bijou, with the Smiths came down on Sunday, and is just ahead of us.

Wednesday, Mar. 22.
     Mr. <persName ref="#">Carter</persName> to lunch - we dined at the Hotel - (Ghezireh) with the Forbes-Leiths - several pleasant people.

Thursday, Mar. 23rd.
     A really, cold day, with high wind - went to the <orgName ref="#">Continental Hotel</orgName> this afternoon to hear <persName ref="#">M. Maspero</persName>, on “the Find” - a lecture for the benefit of the Y.M.C.A. of <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> - a crowded hall.  Everyone showed much interest.  It was difficult to hear him - as his voice was low, with the usual French monotonous manner.

Page 89

Friday, March 24th.
     At home and busy all the morning - Theo engaged the Nitseris the other day to take us to the Barrage this afternoon.  We asked Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Watson</persName>, and the <persName ref="#">Hooper</persName> girls.  We had never seen this Barrage and I have always wanted to see the river below <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>, and so it was very interesting.  It took us about an hour and a half - so that we didn’t have any time for the Barrage, and very little time for that beautiful garden - the best in <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName>.  The whole thing was very un-Egyptian - the two barrages, one over the <placeName ref="#">Damietta</placeName>, the other over the <placeName ref="#">Rosetta</placeName> branch - with their long line of arches and towers - with the land between made into this park-like garden.  The whole effect was rather Venetian.  Home by 7 o’clock - having had tea on the way back.

Saturday, Nov. 25.
     At the Museum this morning - <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> showed Mrs. Burn about - as she was not able to be with her mother and father, Admiral and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Forbes Leith</persName> the other day, when they saw the things.  She went from there to the train, as they all join their yacht at <placeName ref="#">Alexandria</placeName>, and go for a <placeName ref="#">Mediterranean</placeName> tour to the Holy Land, <placeName ref="#">Greece</placeName>, etc.

3d Sunday in Lent, Mar. 26.
     Home all day - a worse <placeName ref="#">Khamsin</placeName> condition than yesterday.  Ther. 86 in the shade, about 5 o’clock we went for a drive towards the Pyramids - very delightful.  Dr. <persName ref="#">Sandwith</persName> for dinner.  He seemed tired and dull - without his old sparkle.  He sails on Thursday for 2 

Page 90

months in <placeName ref="#">America</placeName>.

Monday, Mar. 28th.
     This has been a busy day - in town in the morning - Jean and <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> to the <placeName ref="#">Linton-Smiths</placeName> to lunch.  Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Newman</persName> in the afternoon came in and after that we all went to Miss Morgans garden reception - which was charming - a delightful band playing and many people we knew.  A quiet evening - our last on the boat.

Tuesday, Mar. 29th.
     To the Museum with <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> - the room with the “find” is now open to the public.  Dr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Campbell</persName> were there.  They leave tomorrow on the Roumanie.  Miss <persName ref="#">Morgan</persName> and Dr. <persName ref="#">Sandwith</persName> also go on it.  Left the boat for the Hotel and are now up at the <orgName ref="#">Ghezireh Palace</orgName>.

Wednesday, Mar. 30th.
     <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> and <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> dined in town with the <placeName ref="#">Pecketts</placeName> this evening and <persName ref="#">Joe Smith</persName> and wife dined with us and we all went in to the concert at <placeName ref="#">Shepheards</placeName>.

Thursday, Mar. 31st.
     <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> and I spent the morning at the Zoo.  After the rain of last night the gardens were lovely.  <persName ref="#">Monsieur Lackau</persName> dined with us.

Page 91

Friday, April 1st.
     A last visit to the Museum this morning and drove in town all of us at 3:30 to make some visits - in spite of the threatening skies.  We stopped at the <orgName ref="#">Ottoman Bank</orgName> a moment as we supposed - and a heavy rain began as <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> went in - in a moment or two it had so increased that we sat there in the closed carriage nearly an hour before <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> could come out.  I never saw such a down pour - with constant thunder and lightening - as there is little or no drainage in <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>, the streets soon became veritable rivers - and when we could start for home, it was like driving along the bed of a river.

Saturday, April 2d.
     To town this afternoon with many last things and visits to make - tea at <placeName ref="#">Shepheards</placeName> - <persName ref="#">Carter</persName> dined with us - we leave tomorrow.

Thursday, April 7th.	<placeName ref="#">Venice</placeName>.
     We left <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> on the morning of the 3rd at 11 o’clock - and reached <persName ref="#">Port Said</persName> about 4 o’clock.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Carter</persName> came with us - we had to wait for the mail until the next day at 9 o’clock P.M.  Had the most lovely crossing ever known - arriving at <placeName ref="#">Brindisi</placeName> last evening, about 9 o’clock.  It was midnight before we got off - reaching <orgName ref="#">Bologna</orgName> for tea, and <persName ref="#">Acri</persName> by evening.  we are now in our old rooms at the Britannia.  The crossing was the very best we ever made.

Page 92

Friday, April 7th.
     We went out this morning to <placeName ref="#">Salvadores</placeName> and <placeName ref="#">Barozzi</placeName>’s - then to the <placeName ref="#">San Marco</placeName>.  It is undergoing extensive repairs - some say that it will be necessary to renew the foundations - a large part of the nave is shut off.  In the afternoon to <placeName ref="#">Palazzo Capella</placeName> to see the <orgName ref="#">Bensons</orgName>.  Found him very ill and suffering though he was sitting in his chair - very sad.

Saturday, April 8th.
     I went again this morning and stayed a long time with the <orgName ref="#">Bensons</orgName>.  Before coming home went into the garden - full of spring beauty and growth.  It is sad to see the riant beauty of a garden, when those who cared for it, and loved it, are gone from it never to return.

Sunday, 5th in Lent - April 9th.
     To the Frari this morning which we found filled with scaffolding - were able to see the great <persName ref="#">Mantegna</persName>.  Then I went to the <placeName ref="#">Pallazo</placeName> di <persName ref="#">Capello</persName>.  Poor Mr. <persName ref="#">Benson</persName> apparently very low - did not see him as he was in bed under the influence of opiates.  Sat some time with Mrs. <persName ref="#">Benson</persName>.  Cold weather and high winds.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Newberry</persName> arrived today - to arrange with <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> about the “Find” publication, as he is going to write a description of the contents of the tomb.  He is staying here with us.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Nash</persName> dined with us, and we dined in the big dining room which we never did before.  The music was really delightful.

Page 93

Monday, April 10th.
     To the <orgName ref="#">Bensons</orgName> this afternoon, and found him better.  I went into his room, found him sitting up in bed, and looking brighter. It is sad that great hall and those great rooms with all their pretty things, and those two old people fading out of life!

Tuesday, April 11th.
     At the <placeName ref="#">Academia</placeName> and St. <persName ref="#">Marco</persName> again.  <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName>, <persName ref="#">Newberry</persName>, <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> and I went to have tea with the <orgName ref="#">Johnsons</orgName>.  Their rambling, beautiful old place is in better order than it was last year - and in spite of the rain yesterday and that of last night, we walked about the garden, which was a fairy land of blossoming trees.  <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> and I stopped at the <placeName ref="#">Palazzo Capello</placeName> on our way home.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Benson</persName> still better.

Wednesday, April 12th.
     Home this morning - Mr. <persName ref="#">Newberry</persName> and I went to say goodbye to the <orgName ref="#">Bensons</orgName>.  Found him sitting up and quite bright.  Prince <persName ref="#">Hohenloke</persName> came in and we left him there.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Nash</persName> dined with us.

Thursday, April 13th.
     <persName ref="#">Jean</persName>, Mr. <persName ref="#">Newberry</persName>, <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> and I went to <placeName ref="#">San Marco</placeName> this morning.  Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Johnstone</persName> arrived just after breakfast to see the shawabti and photographs of the tomb.  And we were all off at noon for <placeName ref="#">Milan</placeName>.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Nash</persName> came to say goodbye.

Palm Sunday, April 16th.
     Hotel Cavour - <placeName ref="#">Milan</placeName>.
     	We had a perfectly charming ride over here on Thursday afternoon.  The country so green and smiling - all the people working in their vineyards and fields - and above all the snowy peaks of the <placeName ref="#">Alps</placeName>, and great masses of dark blue and white clouds about them.  It was nice being in <placeName ref="#">Milan</placeName> again, and at this best of hotels, where we are so at home.  We are in our old rooms; and found the pretty table ready in our sitting room, with the best dinner we have had in many a month.  The next morning we all went to the <placeName ref="#">Brera</placeName>, and after lunch <persName ref="#">Newberry</persName> went off and <persName ref="#">Cigala</persName> arrived from <placeName ref="#">Turin</placeName>.  Yesterday morning we spent at the <placeName ref="#">Paldo-Pezzoli</placeName>.  It was good to see our old favourites again.  In the afternoon Theo, <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName>, <persName ref="#">Cigala</persName> and I went to the Castello, which they have been much restoring these past 2 years.  It is quite a wonderful place, as building - old fortress, castle etc.  They are rebuilding and restoring on exactly the old lines.  A store of beautiful things to see, especially the recumbent figure of <persName ref="#">Caston</persName> le <placeName ref="#">Foix</placeName> on his tomb by <persName ref="#">Bambaja</persName>.  Today we went to <placeName ref="#">Bergamo</placeName>, in spite of the threatening weather.  We took 2 hours going, and the same time coming back, in a veritable omnibus train.  We took our lunch with us, and ate it immediately on our arrival just outside the station, under a little arbour covered by Wistaria vines just coming into bloom.  Then we went to the <placeName ref="#">Motalli</placeName> gallery and while there the storm began.  It was impossible to get up to the hill town - and we drove back to the station in a pouring rain, reaching home with thankful hearts in time for tea.  The first night of our arrival we went to “La Scala” to hear 

Page 95

<persName ref="#">Don Pasquale</persName> given.  We had one of the best loges in the house - the orchestra was immense - the scenery wonderful - but what a performance to call musical - and how strange to discover that so many people live who can take Italian Opera seriously!  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and I went to the back of the box, piled the cushions behind us - and I took a quiet nap.  It was 12 o’clock when the ballet began, and as the girls were wild to see it, <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and I came home, and sent the carriage back for them.  The next night they all went again - but I declined and stayed at home.

Monday, April 17th.
     Morning at <placeName ref="#">Ambrosiana</placeName> and <placeName ref="#">Brera</placeName>.  While we were at breakfast this morning <persName ref="#">Jones</persName> brought the news, that the railway strike which has been talked of for some time had been declared this morning - and that for the present no R.R. tickets would be sold.  But this evening the accounts are more encouraging and we hope to get off tomorrow morning, <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> for <placeName ref="#">Dresden</placeName> - the rest for <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName>.  Walked in the Park with <persName ref="#">Theo</persName>.

Tuesday, April 18th.
     <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#">Alice</persName> got off this morning - not knowing if they could get through or not, but I had a telegram from him at <placeName ref="#">Verona</placeName> this afternoon, saying they were all right.  They breakfasted at 6:30 - and I came in to have a cup of coffee with them - and just then received a telegram from the <placeName ref="#">Grande Bretagne</placeName>, <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName>, saying “impossible to give rooms until Thursday”.  Greatly disappointed - but have since heard that 

Page 96

no train for <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName> had gone out.  They are making a great effort to send the through trains - the station and even some parts of the roads are guarded by soldiers.  <persName ref="#">Cigala</persName> made 3 attempts today to get back to <placeName ref="#">Turin</placeName> - saying goodbye soon after breakfast - found no train going - came back for lunch - said goodbye again - returned again, went to drive with us, and had tea, and then made his final adieux.  We spent most of the morning in the charming little park near here.

Wednesday, April 19th.
     The day has been cold and stormy - <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> and <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> spent the morning in the <placeName ref="#">Brera</placeName>.  We hope to get off tomorrow.  But are most snug and comfortable at this best of hotels.  Several people have arrived in automobiles, not being able to get through by rail.  <placeName ref="#">Milan</placeName> is such a hot bed for anarchism, that I would as soon not be in it at this time.

Good Friday, April 21st.
     Hotel Grande Bretagne - <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName>.
     	We made a successful journey yesterday from <placeName ref="#">Milan</placeName> - we had a guard of soldiers on our train, there were soldiers in the stations, at the cross-roads, in control of the sentry boxes, switches, tunnels, etc. so that we probably made the safest journey of our lives.  The strike is about over - it was never one of wages - but aimed against railway reforms, which the Gov. is instituting - and the Gov. has met the strikers with such prompt measures, that it has collapsed.  The rain poured all day - we were an hour and a half late - and found my 

Page 97

poor, dear <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> had been waiting nearly two hours.  We found our rooms ready - as familiar as possible - <persName ref="#">Julia</persName> and <persName ref="#">Francis</persName> in attendance - and we have spent most of the day with <persName ref="#">Lizzie</persName> and the girls at the Villino.  Everything seems very quiet in <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName>, as no church bells, one of the characteristic features of <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName>, are rung during Passion week.

Saturday, April 22d.
     A pleasant day - <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> took <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> to the <placeName ref="#">Duomo</placeName> this morning to see the ridiculous ceremony of the “scoppic” -while <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> and I had a charming ride and visit in the <placeName ref="#">Cascine</placeName>.  They all lunched here, and we went to tea with the Hagemeyers, in their new appartment and saw the new baby.  <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> came back to dinner.  In the evening I went to Mrs. <persName ref="#">Bend</persName>’s sitting room, just above ours, to see her and <persName ref="#">Beatrice</persName>.

Easter Sunday, April 23rd.
     Lunched with <persName ref="#">Lizzie</persName> today as it was her birthday - and stayed the day with her.

Monday, April 24th.
     <persName ref="#">Lizzie</persName> and the girls to lunch - <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> and I, taking <persName ref="#">Amelie</persName>, went to the <placeName ref="#">Bargello</placeName>.  Mrs. Bend, <persName ref="#">Beatrice</persName> and Miss <persName ref="#">Whitney</persName> spent the evening with us.

Tuesday, April 25.
     Bank, shopping and visiting.  <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> to lunch.  Home with her for tea.

Page 98

Wednesday, April 26th.
     <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> and I with <persName ref="#">Amelie</persName> drove up to the <placeName ref="#">Rose Garden</placeName> - and came home laden with roses - most of which I carried up to the Villino where we stayed all day.  The Bends and Miss <persName ref="#">Whiting</persName> again in the evening.  They go off to-morrow to <placeName ref="#">Ravenna</placeName> and <placeName ref="#">Venice</placeName>.

Thursday, April 27th.
     At home this morning - <persName ref="#">Lizzie</persName> and <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> came to lunch, and we went for tea to the Newmans - a charming visit to a perfectly charming and artistic home - stayed disgracefully late.

Friday, April 28th.
     jean and I drove out to I Tatti this morning to lunch - the day was warm and wholly charming - and the world most beautiful.  <persName ref="#">Berensen</persName> looks better than he has done for 3 years.  His nice sister <persName ref="#">Senda</persName> was there, looking ill and worn.  We sat out under the cypresses and had coffee and talked, until it was time to drive home.  In the evening we dined at the Villino.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Cust</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#">Burton</persName> were there - and a beautiful little dinner.  <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> able to be up - but looking a bit tired.

Saturday  April 29th.
     Home all the morning writing letters.  Jean and <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> shopped a little and drove up to <placeName ref="#">San Miniato</placeName>.  All went to a pretty and elaborate tea at Miss Bennetto.

Page 99

Sunday, April 30th.
     I have been the whole day with <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> at the Villino.  She is much better.  Jean and I called on Mrs. <persName ref="#">Hagemeyer</persName> on our way home.  Lovely weather.

Monday, April 31st.
     <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> and I did some shoppings this morning - and all the family came to lunch and stayed to tea.

Tuesday, May 1st.
     I and the girls drove about this morning - went at <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName>’s request to <persName ref="#">Costantini</persName>’s to see <persName ref="#">David C.</persName> about <persName ref="#">Theo</persName>’s pictures.  The place greatly improved and very pretty.  <persName ref="#">Lizzie</persName> and the girls to lunch and we all went to Mr. <persName ref="#">Custs</persName> to tea - and bravely climbed his 97 steps to his interesting appartment, and had an amusing and pleasant visit.

Wednesday, May 2d.
     A busy morning - <persName ref="#">Lizzie</persName> gave us a charming tea with several pleasant friends - we spent the whole day there - and the little villino looked so pleasant - the sunny rooms, and tiny garden - and <persName ref="#">Rex</persName> and his antics.  I am so pleased that they have taken a cottage at <placeName ref="#">Vallambrosa</placeName> for the summer and will go up the 1st of June with <persName ref="#">Rex</persName> and the two maids and have their own home.  <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> and <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> came home with us, as Mr. <persName ref="#">Cust</persName> and <persName ref="#">Harry Burton</persName> were coming to dine.  <persName ref="#">Harry</persName> brought his beautiful photographs to show us - and we had a nice and merry evening.

Page 100

Thursday, May 3rd.
     I had a letter from <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> this morning saying we would find him in <placeName ref="#">Paris</placeName> when we arrived.  We all went to the <placeName ref="#">Academia</placeName> this morning - then to the Rose garden - and brought home some lovely roses.  Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Newman</persName> and <persName ref="#">Lizzie</persName> to lunch, and the girls as well as <persName ref="#">Harold Smith</persName> and <persName ref="#">Bob Ream</persName> came to tea.  Threatening weather.

Monday, May 8th.
     <placeName ref="#">Paris</placeName> - Hotel Westminster.
     	Our last 2 days in <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName> were very busy - the girls came early - <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> and I went to the Uffizzi, and I saw my favourites - and two charming recent acquisitions “<persName ref="#">Madonna</persName> adoring the Infant Christ” ascribed to <orgName ref="#">Filippino Lippi</orgName> - which seems to suggest more the manner of both <persName ref="#">Botticelli</persName> and <persName ref="#">Fra Lippo Lippi</persName> - and a rare picture by the Umbrian master, <persName ref="#">B. Caporali</persName>, a Holy Family - with background in gold, and lovely colouring and expression.  The new Director <persName ref="#">Ricci</persName>, who has done such good work in <placeName ref="#">Milan</placeName> and other cities in reorganizing and rearranging the picture galleries, is now engaged in evolving order and sequence into the long neglected Uffizi - and it already shows marked improvement.  We walked about the corridors, and looked at the views from those lofty windows, as well as the pictures, and went out on the great roof of the <placeName ref="#">Loggia dei Longi</placeName>, which is going to be made into a kind of roof garden.  We found ourselves almost on a level with the <orgName ref="#">Palazzo Vecchio</orgName> tower, and just under it.  Then we walked through the gallery to the <placeName ref="#">Pitti</placeName>, and so home.  In the afternoon <persName ref="#">Smith</persName> and <persName ref="#">Ream</persName> came to the Hotel, and we all 

Page 101

drove to the Villino for tea.  Jean and I stayed to dinner - and we hated to come away and say goodbye to the sweet little house.  Saturday dawned cold and stormy - we had the carriage and <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> went with me to the bank - and to the English Bakery to get some things for our tea basket on the train.  <persName ref="#">Lizzie</persName> and the girls to lunch - and the latter went in the omnibus with us to the station.  <persName ref="#">Harry Surton</persName> came also.  We had a very comfortable journey here - two compartments in the train-de-luxe - one Jean and <persName ref="#">Amelie</persName> occupied - and the other I had to myself, a connecting door made them pleasant.  I did not pull down the blinds of my windows - so that the dawn wakened me - and I piled my pillows and sat up in bed to see the dawn come upon the snow covered peaks - a lovely scenery all day - until as we drew near <placeName ref="#">Paris</placeName> the rain began - and was pouring when we arrived.  Found <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> installed in our old quarters, with a bright fire - and after dinner we sat talking late.  Today has been cold, cloudy and damp. We have been busy - as we have only 5 days here.

Saturday, May 13th.
     We are quite ready to go over to <placeName ref="#">London</placeName> tomorrow.  it has been rather nice here - not too much shopping and dressmaking.  We have seen a good deal of <persName ref="#">Cecile de Lagarde</persName> - we had hoped to take her home with us, but her father is obdurate - but she is going over to <placeName ref="#">London</placeName> with us.

Thursday, May 18th.
     Our journey over from <placeName ref="#">Paris</placeName> the other day was a really pleasant 

Page 102

one.  Daisy Busk came with us.  They sail on the 20th.  The weather was good - the channel boat “Le Nord” was big and comfortable.  The 3 girls stayed on deck and enjoyed it.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and I took possession of the cabin de luxe, he took one sofa and I the other and slept all the way over.  We had an enormous number of passengers, as the <placeName ref="#">Brindisi</placeName> train was just in, and such an amount of luggage, that we were 2 hours late leaving Dover.  It was nice to be in <placeName ref="#">England</placeName> once more.  We reached our hotel of last year, <placeName ref="#">Bucklands</placeName>, in time for dinner which was served in our large pleasant sitting room.  <persName ref="#">Everard Fielding</persName> came in the evening, as pleasant as ever, and looking very well.  Monday the racket began.  The girls and I went to <persName ref="#">Nicolls</persName>, and ordered our tailor gowns.  In the afternoon we all went to the wonderful <persName ref="#">Wallace</persName> Collection, and came home really tired.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Newberry</persName> dined with us and we had a nice evening.  We find Mr. <persName ref="#">Carter</persName> has gone out to <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName>, and <persName ref="#">Newberry</persName> goes himself in June.  Tuesday we spent the whole of the morning at the <placeName ref="#">South Kensington Museum</placeName> - and came home more dead than alive.  Poor <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> had such a headache that she had to take to her bed, where she stayed.  Such a disappointment too, as Fielding was dining here, and we were going to the Court Theatre to hear one of <persName ref="#">Bernard Shaw</persName>’s plays - “<orgName ref="#">John Bulls</orgName> other Island”.  It was admirably done, and very amusing.  Wednesday <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> was all right again - we were driving all the morning - very bright weather, but cold, gusty winds.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Newberry</persName> came to lunch, and after Mr. <persName ref="#">Rathbone</persName>, bringing me most lovely roses.  In, all the afternoon.  Today we have been shopping and driving, lunched with Sir <persName ref="#">WIlliam Farrer</persName> - he looking so well - and so bright 

Page 103

and charming - but grown quite deaf.  Col. <persName ref="#">Watson</persName> was there.  <persName ref="#">Gaspard Farrer</persName> dined with us - also Mr. <persName ref="#">Cary-Elwes</persName> and <persName ref="#">Lady Winifred</persName> - who took <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> and <persName ref="#">Cécile</persName> on to a concert at a private house.

Friday, May. 19.
     At home all the morning.  We all went to the Court Theatre again to the Matinée of “You never can Tell” by <persName ref="#">Bernard Shaw</persName>. <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> and I heard it there three years ago - an amusing, charming play.  Not so strong in character representation as “<orgName ref="#">John Bulls</orgName> other Island”.  Major, and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Wilson</persName> made us a visit this evening.  She sails tomorrow for <placeName ref="#">America</placeName>.

Saturday, May. 20.
     A cold rainy day.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and <persName ref="#">Cécile</persName> went to the British Museum and <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> came home pale and weary.  Fielding came at 3:30 - then he and <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> went out and the girls and I for a drive in the Park - the rain having stopped.  But we found a cold, high wind.  Soon after we got home, and were comforting ourselves with hot tea, Mr. <persName ref="#">Rathbone</persName> called, and made one of his charming visits.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> brought Fielding back to dinner, and they are now looking at the Egyptian photos.

Sunday, 4th After Easter.
     I went to the <orgName ref="#">First Church of Christian Science</orgName> this morning in <placeName ref="#">Sloam Terrace</placeName> and found the same large reverent congregation that I found there last year.  it is really bitterly cold today.  Mr. Field-

ing came back with the girls from the <orgName ref="#">R. Catholic</orgName> and stayed to lunch.  He took <persName ref="#">Cécile</persName> to a concert at <placeName ref="#">Queen’s Hall</placeName> this afternoon, and both of the girls to the first performance of <persName ref="#">Bernhard Shaw</persName>’s play at the Court Theatre, “Man and Superman”.  I went to see Miss <persName ref="#">Farrer</persName> this afternoon - such a pleasant visit, - the old fashioned rooms looking so bright this cold day, with bright fires and lovely flowers.

Monday, May 22nd.
     Shopping and <orgName ref="#">National Gallery</orgName> this morning - driving in afternoon, and dined with the Rathbones this evening - and are just home - 1:30 A.M.  Every one else is gone to bed - where I ought to be.  A charming dinner - I sat between Mr. <persName ref="#">Rathbone</persName> and <persName ref="#">Percival Landon</persName>-- who was the special correspondent of the “Times” with the young husband expedition to <placeName ref="#">Thibet</placeName>.  There were also “Percy Granger” a clever rising musical pianist and two lesser lights - and they gave us some lovely music after dinner.  He has the most extraordinary facility with the piano, and makes most novel and unheard of harmonies.  <persName ref="#">Lady Agnes de Trafford</persName> came in during the evening, and about 11:30 Lady <persName ref="#">Winifred</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#">Cary Elwes</persName> arrived, and he sang two or three delightful songs.  <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName> was quite scandalized with our late hours.

Tuesday, May 23.
     Lady <persName ref="#">Winnie</persName> came to take the girls to the <placeName ref="#">National Portrait Gallery</placeName>.  In the afternoon we went down to Sargents Studio and had tea with him and were so interested in him and his belongings.  A sincere, 

Page 105

simple, and unaffected man - with no aim at artistic fittings in his studio.  Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Rathbone</persName> were there.  This evening we have had an entrancing evening at <placeName ref="#">Drury Lane Theatre - Irving</placeName> as Shylock, and the captivating Mrs. <persName ref="#">Mathewson</persName> as <persName ref="#">Portia</persName>.  A wonderful performance - the setting so fine and perfect - <persName ref="#">Irving</persName> looks very old - and received a real ovation.  The theatre was bitterly cold - all the men wore overcoats - and the women wraps - and we wished for hot water bottles and blankets.

Wednesday, May 24.
     A very busy day - <persName ref="#">Robert Trefusis</persName> came up from <placeName ref="#">Eton</placeName> and spent most of the day here.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and I got a quiet hour at the Nat. Gallery, Mr. <persName ref="#">Rathbone</persName> and <persName ref="#">Newberry</persName> to lunch and to tea as well - and this evening we had a rational, charming dinner at the <persName ref="#">Farrer</persName> boys house.

Thursday, May 25.
     Out all the morning - the girls went off at 12 o’clock with Mr. <persName ref="#">Rathbone</persName> to see Knole-  <persName ref="#">Elena Rathbone</persName> came to lunch - Count <persName ref="#">Trotti</persName> was also here - directly after lunch I took <persName ref="#">Amelie</persName> and went out to <placeName ref="#">Guildford</placeName> to see Mr. <persName ref="#">Upton</persName> of the <placeName ref="#">Hardy Plant Nursery</placeName> - and enjoyed myself.  A quiet evening at home.

Friday, May 26.
     We went out to <placeName ref="#">Oxford</placeName> today, taking Mr. <persName ref="#">Rathbone</persName> with us, and lunched at <placeName ref="#">Queens</placeName> with Mr. <persName ref="#">Sayce</persName>.  We saw <persName ref="#">Magdalene</persName>, <persName ref="#">Christ</persName>, New 

Page 106

College and St. Johns - and went down to the river in the afternoon to see the races.  It was such a pretty sight - the day was so warm - the country so lovely - the Thorns all in bloom as well as the chestnuts.  We went to the <placeName ref="#">Baliel</placeName> barge to see the boats - and had tea there - then back to <placeName ref="#">Magdalen</placeName> to hear the Service of Song, but were just one minute and a half too late, as we found the door of the chapel obdurately closed; so we went back to the <persName ref="#">Randolph</persName> and stayed until it was train time.  We had a saloon carriage going and coming, and had dinner baskets for coming home - as we were not due until 9 o’clock.  Principal <persName ref="#">Rhys</persName> and his wife, and a nice fellow Mr. <persName ref="#">Hodgson</persName> were at the lunch.

Saturday, May 27.
     Shopping this morning - <persName ref="#">Jean</persName> went with Mr. <persName ref="#">Fielding</persName> at 12, on the river for a row.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName>, <persName ref="#">Cecile</persName> and I drove out to Weinbledon Common to take tea with Sir <persName ref="#">William Preece</persName> and his daughters.  After getting beyond <placeName ref="#">Putney</placeName> we came to the Common which I had never seen.  It lies so high and is so big, that the air was delightful - coming over miles of heather and gorse.  Sir <persName ref="#">William</persName> has a charming old fashioned house, with room after room looking on the garden - and the house filled with rare Persian things - arms, stuffs, tiles etc.  The greater part of his collection is at <placeName ref="#">South Kensington</placeName>.  Met some pleasant people - lovely drive home.  Fielding came in late this evening.

Sunday, May 28.
     <persName ref="#">Cecile</persName> and I went for a drive in the Park before I went to 

Page 107

church - which was held in the <placeName ref="#">Aeolian Hall</placeName>, Bond St.  One of the prettiest and simplest concert halls I ever saw - and a very large congregation of the best class.  This is the <orgName ref="#">Second Christian Science Church</orgName>.  Everard Fielding came to lunch after which we took the girls to <placeName ref="#">Kew</placeName>, and <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> and I drove first to call on Mrs. <persName ref="#">Sandwith</persName>, whom we found at home looking very well and pretty.  Then to Miss Lulling - and then about Regent Park.  After we got home, <persName ref="#">Gaspard</persName> and <persName ref="#">Harry Farrer</persName> called.  Fielding again to dinner, and he and <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> are now playing chess.
