Thursday. Nov. 5th 1908.
SS. Princess <persName>Irene</persName>.

    We are nearing the end of this part of our voyage – having sailed from <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName> Saturday the 24th Oct.  <persName>Mary Newberry</persName> who had been spending the week there, and <placeName ref="#">Anita Ohio</placeName>went down to see us off. Mrs. And <persName>Mr. Walter Jennings</persName>and family – 2 children, 2 maids, tutor and governess, with <persName>Miss Gallandet</persName>, and sister <persName>Miss Jennings</persName>, were fellow passengers. They are relatives of <persName>Mrs. Hugh Amkincloss</persName>, who was <persName>Miss Jennings</persName>. Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Herbert Pell</persName>, also on board.  A dull voyage, much rain and warm – I occupied for the 3rd time the Captain’s charming rooms on the bridge – and what lovely hours of rest and quiet I had, after all the din and stir of the summer.  The steamer is comfortable but slow, we reached <placeName ref="#">Gibraltar</placeName> on the 11th day and ought to be in <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> tonight, only we won’t, at least we hope to make our steamer tomorrow.

Monday. Nov. 9.
<placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> – Shepheards
     We did just make our steamer the ‘<orgName ref="#">Preussen</orgName>’ on Friday – Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Pell</persName> with us.  We all occupied the Captain’s and officer’s rooms on the bridge – and were very comfortable – landed at <placeName ref="#">Alexandria</placeName> at 3 this P.M. got the train, and at 7 o’clock were installed in our familiar rooms on the pleasant garden.  We have never been so early before. Not many people yet.

PAGE 61

<persName>Eldon</persName> and <persName>Lady Gorst</persName>. Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Pell</persName> have been dining with us. We have had a busy 10 days in <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>.  Every one has been so kind.  We went to <persName>Lady Gorsts</persName> to a garden party – to the <persName>Iddings</persName>to dine – and to a tea, where we met delightful people. Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Iddings</persName> dined with us that evening, and Capt. <persName>Trefusis</persName> – <persName>M. Maspero</persName> another evening, and the Capt. Who also lunched with us.  The great event was <persName>Theo</persName>’s presentation to the Khedive, which Mr <persName>Iddings</persName>has been trying to persuade him to do for 3 years – but this year he consented – and he was received in a private audience. <persName>Mr. Iddings</persName> came for him in his own carriage, with his decorative Kavass, and 2 gorgeous running Sayces, and <persName>Theo</persName>had to appear in frock coat and top hat at 10 in the morning. I couldn’t but laugh when I saw them drive off in such style, for I knew how he hated it. It was very successful however, and <persName>Mr. Iddings</persName> told me he had never seen the Khedive so interested in an interview.

Friday. Nov. 20.

     In town with <persName>Theo</persName> this morning, doing last things. Capt. <persName>Trefusis</persName> lunched with us.  Our tug took us to the bridge landing at 1 o’clock and we hoped to get through the draw comfortably.  But the usual scrimmage occurred – and we came near losing the top of our big boom.  Then we had to get through the new <placeName ref="#">Ghizeh bridge</placeName> – we landed the Capt. And waited until most of the gyassas had passed through.  We got as far as the big Sugar station, 5 miles below Bedreschein – very cold. 

PAGE 62

Saturday. Nov. 21.

     Very busy settling- made Wasta at 5 P.M. warmer.  The river is tremendous and the current very strong – it is a mighty flood – but will do great good to the country.

23rd Sunday after <orgName ref="#">Trinity</orgName>. Nov. 22.

     Sailed at 6 a.m. and tied up at 7 P.M. making 50 miles – warmer and a wonderful sunset.

Monday. Nov. 23rd.

     Sailed from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.  Delayed for 4 hours at <persName>Sheik Fadl</persName> for coal for the tug – have made 40 miles and are now lying 10 miles below <placeName ref="#">Minia</placeName>.  A most wonderful river – no one knows its channel and our tug goes scalloping about on it in an extraordinary way.

Tuesday. Nov. 24th
 
     We made an early start at 5:30 and are now at <placeName ref="#">Mellawi</placeName> – having made 41-½ miles – beautiful weather, though the wind is cold. 

Wednesday. Nov. 25th. 
48 miles.

     An early start – we are about 10 miles below <placeName ref="#">Asyût</placeName>, weather charming.

Thursday. Nov. 26. 
40 miles.

     Reached Asyût at 8 this morning – we were passing

PAGE 63

the great <persName>Weir</persName>before I knew it – the draw open and all the sluices – and such a tremendous body of water running through. Our tug had hard work to pull us. Stopped for mail. <persName>Mr. Russell</persName> called.

Friday. Nov. 27,
45 miles.

     In spite of strong N.W. wind.  We are lying 6 miles below <placeName ref="#">Girga</placeName>.

Saturday. Nov. 28.
32 miles.
     A very early start, before dawn.  Such a beautiful hour followed! The sunrise, and this strange, interesting land, and the quiet hour of reading and reflection, nothing can ever take it from me.  A fine day, with strong N.W. wind, which meeting the strong current of the river, made quite a sea.  We reached <persName>Nagh Hamadi</persName> at 3 o’clock thinking the bridge opened at 3:30 but found it opened at 3 o’clock – so we were forced to stay the night.  It was quiet enough – and the late afternoon and evening most lovely.

First Sunday in Advent. Nov. 29.

     We passed the bridge most easily at 7:30 – before I got up.  The tug took us up as far as the difficult turn at <placeName ref="#">Kasr es Sayd</placeName> – then left us with much hearty leave-takings and receiving of liberal backsheesh.  The day was absolutely calm, and we were left alone in the middle of the river, with both sails limply hanging – we have tracked, pulled to the anchor and sailed a little very quietly and are now lying

PAGE 64

within sight of  Dishneh – a most exquisite evening.  17 miles.

Monday. Nov. 30.
42 ½ miles.

     Made an early start this morning in a good wind, and reached this high bank, one mile below <placeName ref="#">Nagada</placeName> at 5.30.  An exciting day – the boat careering madly along – sailors shouting – sails changing, and all the clamor of a sharp sailing.  The morning was delicious – I was on deck all the time until we were delayed by a gyassa which cut across our bow in an awkward way, and going immediately upon the sand just in front of us, we had to pull up so sharply that we went with a  great thump on the bank – there was a great tumbling about of all movable things – and when I came below to see about it - I found <persName>Amelie</persName>, <persName>Jones</persName>, <persName>Hassein</persName>, and <persName>Hassoun</persName> busy setting everything straight.  Last year we came on the boat Nov. 30.  We are much in advance this year! 

Tuesday. Dec. 1st.
23-½ miles.

     <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName>. A high wind, but not favourable, all day.  However we came gallantly in with sails filled at 5.30 and found ourselves the first arrival of the season. Everyone was on the lookout for us, and we were told that we made a splendid appearance, as we rushed along past the town to our old mooring ground on the island.  <persName>Harold Jones</persName> was waiting for us at the <placeName ref="#">Winter Palace</placeName>, Tuesday being his off day.  He came over at once, and stayed to dinner and gave us the news.  It took us 10 days and part of another day from <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> here.

PAGE 65

Wednesday. Dec. 2nd.

     I have had a quietly busy and most pleasant day at home.  <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Eleanor</persName> were at <placeName ref="#">Karnak</placeName> and the <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> temple.  A big mail last night, and reams of papers. No bad news.  <persName>Mathilde</persName> better.

Thursday. Dec. 3rd.

     <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Eleanor</persName> went to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> today and did not get back until 4 o’clock.  They report the road very bad as far as the bridge. <persName>Harold</persName> is working between Hor-em-heb and Amenhotep II tomb.  Cold.

Friday. Dec. 4th.

     <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Eleanor</persName> at <placeName ref="#">Karnak</placeName>today – and I over to the town. Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Weigall</persName> were here this afternoon.

Saturday. Dec. 5th.

     Theo at the boat very busy with letters.  <persName>Eleanor</persName>and I went over and called on <persName>Miss Buchanan</persName> – such a very nice visit.  The school very prospering – over 280 pupils.  The place has much improved – a fine stone wall all about it – and a beautiful garden making.  

Second Sunday in Advent. Dec. 6.

     A quiet day at home – <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Eleanor</persName> over at the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>. The roads and embankments have been so spoiled by the river, that they are well nigh impossible – and I cannot get over in my chair until they PAGE 66 are better. Last night about 12 o’clock, I was aroused by cries that I thought must be those of a jackal – it proved to have been a man in the river. Six men had gone to our opposite neighbor <persName>Mr. Insingers</persName>, to rob and steal. They overpowered the night watchman, and one of them got into the house. <persName>Mr. Insinger</persName>sent a shot at the man, who ran, followed by <persName>Mr. Insinger</persName> firing at him – the man took to the river, and found the current so strong that he screamed for help.  The police appeared and caught the man, who gave the names of the men with him.  There is a great deal of lawlessness about the country and some alarm felt.

Monday. Dec. 7th.

     <persName>Eleanor</persName>and I went to see <persName>Miss Buchanan</persName> this morning – such a brave little woman.  Our nights are now most beautiful – full moon.

Tuesday. Dec. 8th.

     Beautiful weather – <persName>Harold Jones</persName>came over this morning and stayed all night. Wednesday. Dec. 9th. A cold day – Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Weigall</persName> here this afternoon.

Thursday. Dec. 10th.

     <persName>Eleanor</persName> and I went over to <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName>and drove out to see <persName>Mrs. Weigall</persName>. Found <persName>Mr. Whymper</persName>and <persName>Dr. Dunn</persName>there. Afterwards to the Savoy PAGE 67 to call on <persName>Mrs. Quibell</persName>and <persName>Miss Pirie</persName>– not at home – then asked for <persName>Miss Bruce</persName>and <persName>Miss Dobie</persName> – the former in bed – and I went up to her room to see her.  <persName>Theo</persName> in the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> today.

Friday. Dec. 11.

     Another fine day – but still cold.  Everybody growling about the continued cold.

Saturday. Dec. 12th.

     Very busy with catalogues and gardening plans.

Third Sunday in Advent. Dec. 13.

     <persName>Eleanor</persName> and <persName>Theo</persName> in the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>. Had a nice visit from <persName>Mr. Carter</persName>this morning – <persName>Mr. Whymper</persName>, Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Weigall</persName>dined with us, a pleasant evening. Monday. Dec. 14th. Rather warmer today. <persName>Mrs. Quibell</persName>and <persName>Miss Pirie</persName> called.  So glad to see them.

Tuesday. Dec. 15th.

     <persName>Harold Jones</persName> lunched here – having spent the night with the Weigalls – and intending to return there for the night.  <persName>Theo</persName> and <persName>Eleanor</persName> at <placeName ref="#">Der el Bahari</placeName>. PAGE 68 Wednesday. Dec. 16th. In doors, except for a long walk on the sands – <persName>Miss Bruce</persName>and <persName>Miss Dobie</persName>here this afternoon. Monday. Dec. 21st. Dr. and <persName>Mrs. Campbell</persName> and daughter came this afternoon, bringing with them Count and Countess d’Albertis of <placeName ref="#">Genoa</placeName>.  <persName>Harold Jones</persName>later, all stayed to tea. The days are so quiet and monotonous there is little to chronicle. Wednesday. Dec. 23rd. The ‘Scarab’ and ‘Osiris’ up today, and came to our side, directly behind us. The Scarab almost poking her nose into my cabin. Friday. Dec. 25th. <persName>Mr. Almerio Paget</persName> called this morning.  He is on the Scarab with his wife (<persName>Pauline Whitney</persName>) and family.  We had our usual little celebration with the men this morning.  The usual Christmas festivities. <persName>Harold</persName>spent the night here – and with those 3 nice men <persName>Mr. Whymper</persName>, and <persName>Mr. Nicol</persName>, dined here.  <persName>Joe Smith</persName> arrived with his wife today, they are staying at <placeName ref="#">Weigalls</placeName>.

Tuesday. Dec. 29th.

     At tea with the Scofields on the Maat.  <persName>Harold</persName>here for the day. <persName>Mr. F. Lagge</persName>and his friend <persName>Mr. Pease</persName> dined with us.  <persName>Theo</persName>has PAGE 69 bought one of <persName>Mr. Nicol</persName>’s best pictures. The Scarab with the Pagets and the Osiris with <persName>Sir Arthur</persName> and <persName>Lady Paget</persName>went up today. Lovely weather. Wednesday. Dec. 30th. <persName>Mrs. Weigall</persName>, <persName>Mrs. Smith</persName>, and <persName>Miss Buchanan</persName> lunched here.  <persName>Baron de Vos</persName> of the <placeName ref="#">Dongela</placeName>called, also <persName>Mr. Mandsley</persName> bringing the horrible news of the <persName>Messina</persName>earthquake. Thursday. Dec. 31st. <persName>Miss Grace Scofield</persName>, <persName>Eleanor</persName> and I, and <persName>Theo</persName> went to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>today, lunched in our comfortable little stone house. Perfect day. Jan. 12th. Tuesday. Various happenings social and otherwise since the month came in. <persName>Mrs. Weigall</persName> and <persName>Corinna Smith</persName>come every Saturday morning to read. Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Walter Brown</persName> of <placeName ref="#">Venice</placeName>are here for a month, with Mrs. B’s mother, <persName>Mrs. Beckwith</persName>.  <persName>Theo</persName>had <persName>Mr. Nicol</persName> out one day in the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>wishing to show him the western valley. <persName>Mrs. Henry Taft</persName>with her daughters dined with us one evening, with <persName>Mr. Nicol</persName>, <persName>Weigall</persName> and <persName>Joe Smith</persName>. Then we had them (Mrs. and <persName>Miss Taft</persName>) out to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName> next day.  The <persName>Jennings</persName> have turned up.  <persName>Baron de Vos</persName> called – some things quite interesting have been found in the debris of the pit tomb Theo has been working in lately.  Bits of gold foil, stamped with the cartouches of

PAGE 70

Thut-ankh-amon, <persName>Ai</persName> and S-ankh-aten, wife of T.A.A.  She was the 3rd daughter of <persName>Akenaten</persName>.

Friday. Jan. 15th.

     Theo again in the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>– <persName>Mr. Erskine</persName> has turned up again – he lunched with <persName>Theo</persName> today.

Saturday. Jan 16th.

     <persName>Hortense Weigall</persName>, and <persName>Corinna Smith</persName> were her this morning for the usual reading.  They are all camping out up at the <placeName ref="#">Beit Wilkinson</placeName> place – and <persName>Eleanor</persName>and I went up there to lunch. <persName>Mr. Erskine</persName> and Rev. <persName>Colins Campbell</persName> were there – a pleasant day.

Jan. 21 – Thursday.

     <persName>Harold</persName> found yesterday in the last corner of the pit tomb, a most lovely alabaster statuette of a woman – about 9 in. high, the most perfect specimen of Egyptian art I have ever seen, and in perfect condition.  To think of her lying under that hard mud for nearly 3000 years! no inscription.  It is thought it may represent the wife of Thut-ankh-amen.  <persName>Theo</persName>, <persName>Eleanor</persName>and M. and <persName>Mme. Maspero</persName> in the valley today.  Lovely weather.

Third Sunday after Epiphany.  Jan. 24th.

     We were distressed and amazed this morning at breakfast to

PAGE 71

Hear of poor <persName>Corinna</persName>’s disaster.  She was here yesterday morning as usual.  I thought she looked very tired and troubled.  She had many things to do in town, before she went back to their camp.  The Petries were dining with them.  She was then suffering extremely from pain in one eye – which grew so bad that she became delirious.  They (she and <persName>Joe</persName>) got some donkeys and came at a walk all the way to the river, where they quietly aroused some of our sailors, who rowed them across to <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> to the doctor.  He advised them to go at once to <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> – and they now are on their way there.  It is a hideous experience for the poor things – a very bad case of opthalmia.  The <persName>Walter Browns</persName> here to tea.
