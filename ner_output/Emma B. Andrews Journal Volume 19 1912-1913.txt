Nov. 21. 1912.

After a hurried and tiring week spent in <placeName ref="#">New York</placeName> at that perfect hotel, the <placeName ref="#">St. Dennis</placeName>, we sailed on Saturday the 16, for <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName> via <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> on that ship well known to us, the “<placeName ref="#">Berlin</placeName>”, on which we have crossed for two years.  Only, this time I was not upstairs in the Captain’s room as usual.  We have <persName ref="#">Mary Newberry</persName> and her daughter, <persName ref="#">Doris</persName>, with us, making their first acquaintance with these southern waters.  But we are unfortunate - for our second day out was bad - the wind and sea increasing in violence, and for 24 hours it was terrific - it is now better, but the rain and mist continue, and we have only caught a glimpse of the Azores - which we are now passing.

Sunday. Nov. 24th.

We dropped our anchor about 2 o’clock at <placeName ref="#">Gibraltar</placeName>.  Most of the passengers went ashore, <persName ref="#">Jones</persName> guiding <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#">Doris</persName>.  They were duly impressed and charmed.  We were soon off - it growing wilder as we got well into the <placeName ref="#">Mediterranean</placeName>.

Tuesday. Nov. 26th.

Reached <placeName ref="#">Algiers</placeName> after dark - many went ashore - mild and lovely.

Wednesday. Oct. 27th. (<persName ref="#">Sarah</persName>’s note - it should be Nov. 27th. Either <orgName ref="#">EBA</orgName> or typist’s mistake)

Arrived at noon today - found <persName ref="#">Harry</persName> waiting for us.  The pleasant old appartment at the <placeName ref="#">Grand Hotel</placeName> - a tea at <persName ref="#">Bertolini</persName>’s - and off in the <persName ref="#">Prinz Heinrick</persName> for <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName> on Friday - a very smooth passage over a summer sea, and <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName> at last, and once again.  How glad we were for <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName>’s sake - and he was so happy to find himself once more here!

<persName ref="#">Dahabya Beduin</persName>. Dec. 11th.

We are now established on our boat - waiting for our tug - which should arrive in the morning.  How pleasant it is! after a whole month from home spent in hotels and steamers! It has been a busy week in <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> - <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#">Doris</persName> have been sightseeing and motoring about.  I have been once to the Museum making a visit to Sir <persName ref="#">Gaston Maspero</persName> with <persName ref="#">Theo</persName>.  We spoke of the magnificent cover to the so-called Tyii’s coffin which has never been shown to the public and is kept entirely apart in a private room.  A man capable of repairing it has been found, and has agreed to do the whole thing and to finish it within 5 months.  The gold work, as well as the exquisite inlay - it will be a grand addition to <persName ref="#">Theodore</persName>’s exhibit at the Museum.  We had quite a little tea party on Sunday afternoon, on the boat.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Sayce</persName>, <persName ref="#">Artin Pasha</persName>, <persName ref="#">Claudius Bey</persName> and the young <persName ref="#">Leavitts</persName>.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Sayce</persName> is on his way to <placeName ref="#">India</placeName>.  We gave a morning to the zoo - and generally a lot of sight seeing.

Saturday. Dec. 21

We arrived about noon today - after a pleasant and successful voyage of 10 days - one day of showers - clearing with most beautiful rainbow.  We have several fine new sailors - young men - making a fine crew - of course our tug was a good strong one, making a fast voyage.  We find several friends here - Mr. <persName ref="#">Whymper</persName>, <orgName ref="#">Contessa di Villamarina</orgName>, Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Pier</persName>, and their 2 heavenly little girls - Miss <persName ref="#">Buchanan</persName> fortunately for 2 days.  She is now at the head of the <orgName ref="#">American College</orgName> for girls in <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName>.  On the 24th the Serapis arrived with Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Tuck</persName> of <placeName ref="#">Paris</placeName>, Major <persName ref="#">Curley</persName> of <placeName ref="#">Newport</placeName>, Miss <persName ref="#">Nelson</persName> and Miss <persName ref="#">Morgan</persName>, niece of Mr. <persName ref="#">Tuck</persName>.  They and Mr. <persName ref="#">Nicol</persName> were here to tea on Christmas day, and <persName ref="#">Harry Burton</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#">Crane</persName> to lunch.

Friday. Dec. 27th.

We all - four of us, and <persName ref="#">Jones</persName> went over to the <placeName ref="#">Valley</placeName>, and stayed 3 days - and had a jolly visit.  Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Arthur James of Newport</persName>, who sailed from there on their yacht, the “Aloha” just before we left, arrived on the “Hyksos” came to tea.  They were so pleased with our boat.  They are going to join their yacht again at <placeName ref="#">Mombasa</placeName> for the return home.

Wednesday. Jan. 1st.

Mr. <persName ref="#">Whymper</persName> came to breakfast and brought us all the news of <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName>.

<persName ref="#">Contessa di Villamarina</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#">Trevaine</persName> came to tea - Baron and <persName ref="#">Baroness</persName> v. Bissing are lying in their boat, just behind us - and <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> and I went to tea with them last evening.

Saturday. Jan. 3rd.

<persName ref="#">Mary</persName>, <persName ref="#">Doris</persName> and I crossed over and paid a visit to Mr. <persName ref="#">Nicol</persName>.  He has the very best picture I ever saw of his - the wonderful mountain range opposite <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> - the finest view in all <placeName ref="#">Egypt</placeName> I think.  He says he painted it for me - but Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Pier</persName> who were her to lunch, say that they are to have it.

Monday. Jan. 6th.

The v. Bissings were here to tea - and Mr. <persName ref="#">Nicol</persName> dined with us.

We dressed the ship on Wednesday - <orgName ref="#">Lincoln</orgName>’s birthday - the

PAGE 110

usual routine - this week - we have had light rain on one day and cold stormy weather since.  <persName ref="#">Contessa</persName> here for luncheon.

We have had Mr. and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Hardy</persName> to tea - Senator <persName ref="#">Aldrich</persName> also.  <persName ref="#">Mary N.</persName> and I have been over to the Winter Palace for tea - we looked very smart on <placeName ref="#">Washington</placeName>’s birthday with all our flags.

Sunday. March 2nd.

On Monday <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> and I went to tea with the Contessa in the gardens of the <placeName ref="#">Luxor Hotel</placeName> - met <persName ref="#">Lady Baring</persName>, <persName ref="#">Miss Murray</persName>, and <persName ref="#">Contessa Pappenheim</persName> and daughter. Charming people all - yesterday we left for Aswân.

Sunday. March 9th.

This is our record for the week - very high wind from the time we left <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName>.  Stopped at <placeName ref="#">Edfou - Kom Ombo</placeName> - where we were held some time by furious wind - after leaving we passed the most wonderful mass of flamingoes - absolutely dense masses of them - attending a mile or two - very remarkable - reached <placeName ref="#">Aswan</placeName> the 4th.  The wind horridly bad. <persName ref="#">Mary</persName> and <persName ref="#">Doris</persName> went to Barrage - the next day we moved down opposite <persName ref="#">Grenfell</persName>’s tomb, and the girls visited them.  The 7th we left <placeName ref="#">Aswan</placeName>, the terrific wind still holding - so that we were tied up some time

PAGE 111

below <orgName ref="#">Kom Ombo</orgName> - the next day we struck upon 3 sand banks, or rather our tug did - and reached here this morning.

Sunday. Mar. 16th.

We spent the days Monday and Tuesday in <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> - <persName ref="#">Doris</persName> and I went over to the town - and Mrs. <persName ref="#">Crispell</persName> and her niece came from the Mayflower to tea - I was so pleased with her.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Crane</persName> and <persName ref="#">Harry</persName> came to tea, and we left <placeName ref="#">Luxor</placeName> the 12th at noon - having had a nice visit from <placeName ref="#">Old Hagg Mahassib - Nag Hamadi</placeName> the 13 - <placeName ref="#">Balliana</placeName> the 14 - where we stopped for <persName ref="#">Mary</persName>, <persName ref="#">Doris</persName>, <persName ref="#">Amelie</persName>, <persName ref="#">Jones</persName> and <persName ref="#">Hassein</persName> to visit <placeName ref="#">Abydos</placeName> - very cold and terrific wind - very severe in the night and rough today.  We passed the <placeName ref="#">Arabia</placeName> stuck at 8:30 A.M. Cold, constant wind.

Wednesday. April 2nd.

We left the boat very reluctantly several days ago, that charming little home, and came to the Ghizereh Palace Hotel - and into our old rooms.  Hotel almost empty.  The new bridge is finished, and trains are running over it.  A very fine and long one - and a great convenience - but it spoils the garden somewhat. <placeName ref="#">Cairo</placeName> is fast changing and improving but losing its unique interesting eastern features.  Mrs. <persName ref="#">Graham</persName> called with Major <persName ref="#">Watson</persName> and asked us to tea on Friday and very pleasant it was, as always.  Mr. <persName ref="#">Tremaine</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#">Carter</persName> called.

PAGE 112

Sunday. April 6th.

Home all day - Baron v. <persName ref="#">Bissing</persName> called and stopped for tea.  <persName ref="#">Contessa Villamarina</persName> and Mlle. Johannis too.

Monday. April 7th.

<persName ref="#">Elena Rathbone</persName> and her friend Miss <persName ref="#">Cholanley</persName> just back from <placeName ref="#">India</placeName> came to tea, as well as Mr. <persName ref="#">Anthony</persName> and Mr. <persName ref="#">Lythgoe</persName>.

Saturday. April 12th.

Arrived in <placeName ref="#">Naples</placeName> at 7:30 this morning, landed in the hideous confusion characteristic of the N.G.L. steamers - rain and cold winds.

Wednesday. April 16th.

Came to <placeName ref="#">Florence</placeName> - a long days journey - very cold.  <persName ref="#">Vesuvius</persName> and the mountains all this way up, covered with snow. We came to the <placeName ref="#">Grande Bretagne</placeName> and to our old appartment  - we have had a little fire every day.  <persName ref="#">Theo</persName> has been almost every day motoring, with <persName ref="#">David Costantini</persName> and <persName ref="#">Harry Burton</persName>, and some one or two of the girls.  The season is very backward - the roses just beginning to show.  Have made some pleasant visits - Theo has made excursions to <persName ref="#">Faenza</persName>, <persName ref="#">Settignano</persName> - <placeName ref="#">Volterra</placeName> and enjoyed it keenly.  He has loved going to the Villino and hearing <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> sing - and to drive to the Cascine for a walk along the little river, with its lovely entourage of blue mountains and green meadows and magnificent trees.  Above all I have enjoyed the companion-

PAGE 113

ship of the two dear nieces, <persName ref="#">Nettie</persName> and <persName ref="#">Mary</persName>.  We go tomorrow at 5 P.M. via the <placeName ref="#">Mt. Cenie</placeName> pass to <placeName ref="#">London</placeName>.
