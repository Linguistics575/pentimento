</span>The Egyptian Museum.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Kasr-en-Nil Barracks rises an imposing new<br/>
building, erected at an expense of more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">8220.000</span>,<br/>
and which was inaugurated some time ago by H.H. the<br/>
Khedive: it is the new Egyptian Museum.<br/>
<br/>
The collection of Egyptian antiquities was begun in<br/>
1854, in the reign of Said Pasha, by the famous Frenchman<br/>
I. <span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Mariette, whose remains are now enclosed in a<br/>
marble sarcophagus placed before the principal entrance<br/>
to the Museum.<br/>
<br/>
The collection was at first installed in an old Post<br/>
Office at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bulak</span>, but it increased so rapidly under the<br/>
able and energetic direction of Mariette (1881) and<br/>
under that of his successors, Maspéro and Grébaut, that<br/>
the Egyptian Government finally decided to assign it<br/>
another building<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
