<span>Mohammed's shirts, brought from Mecca by the founder<br/>
of the mosque, was kept there. Opposite the mosque is<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sebil </span>with <span style="color: #ff0000;">medréseh </span>(school), built by the same<br/>
sultan.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Muristén </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">kalaiin</span>, founded by the Sultan el<br/>
Mansur <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalaton</span>, A.D. 1285, was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>hospital,<br/>
the greater part of which is now in ruins and occupied by<br/>
coppersmiths' workshops. The part containing the<br/>
mausoleum is the only one in good condition. The red<br/>
porphyry columns that formerly supported the dome are<br/>
very interesting. The doorway of the mosque is built of<br/>
alternate layers of white and black marble. The fine<br/>
dadoes that ornamented the lower part of the walls in the<br/>
interior have been reddened by the exudations <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">saltpetre</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muristan </span>(Persian word for hospital) contained a<br/>
ward for each kind of disease, and there were also <span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolrooms</span>, and an orphan asylum.<br/>
<br/>
The tomb mosque of <span style="color: #ff0000;">MohammedaerrNasrubn=Kalatin<br/>
</span>adjoins the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Muristiin</span>, and was erected and built by him,<br/>
A.D. 1300. The marble doorway brought from Akka<br/>
(Palestine), is of little interest.<br/>
<br/>
Third in order after the above two buildings comes the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Barkukiyeh</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Medréseh</span>" of Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barkt1k</span>, containing the mausoleum of his daughter. This edifice was<br/>
restored some years ago. It has a handsome marble <span style="color: #0000FF;">doorway </span>and door with very artistic bronze fittings and<br/>
ornaments.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the street, opposite the above three<br/>
buildings<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">the't </span>Beit el <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kadi</span>" (House of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kadi</span>), a<br/>
beautiful specimen of Arab architecture, worthy of a<br/>
passing inspection.<br/>
<br/>
The Gama'a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Au=Bekr=Mazhar</span>, vizir of Kait Bey,<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span>in A.D. 1480, and contains some very fine<br/>
incrusted marbles <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mosaic</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Gama'a <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Hakem </span>was erected A.D. 1003 by<br/>
the third <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiitimite </span>Khalif<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>on the plan of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tuliin<br/>
</span>mosque, of which, however, it is only a badly-executed<br/>
<br/>
copy<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
