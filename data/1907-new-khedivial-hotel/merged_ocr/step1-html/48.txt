<span>As the taxes were formerly regulated <span style="color: #0000FF;">according </span>to the<br/>
rising of the Nile, it was very important, both for the<br/>
people and its governors, to know the height of the<br/>
water; this was communicated by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sh√©kh</span>, whose<br/>
office it was to guard the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Miky'iis</span>.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the water reaches a certain height. the<br/>
ceremony of the cutting of the Khalig takes place either<br/>
in the first or second week of August.<br/>
<br/>
On the north side of the island there is a tree named<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mandttra</span>, to which the people attribute supernatural<br/>
healing power, and upon the branches of which are<br/>
hanging thousands of rags, the cast-off bandages of those<br/>
who have been there to get cured.<br/>

The village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matariyeh</span>, about 5 miles from Cairo,<br/>
is built on the site of ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>, and can be<br/>
reached by rail in half an hour, or by road through<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh </span>where the barracks, exercise fields, butts,<br/>
and observatory are<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Half way by rail one finds the<br/>
Palace of Kubbeh, the usual residence of H.H. the<br/>
Khedive Abbas Hilmi.<br/>
<br/>
About half a mile from the railway station is the<br/>
Virgin's Tree, under which (according to tradition) the<br/>
Holy Virgin rested after her flight to Egypt. It is a<br/>
sycamore tree of large size, and was planted in the seventeenth century in the place of one that preceded it.<br/>
<br/>
The spring of water near the tree <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>sweet and cool.<br/>
whilst the wells in the neighbourhood have brackish<br/>
water. At this same spot the balsam tree grew until the<br/>
sixteenth <span style="color: #0000FF;">century</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the last specimen died in 1615.<br/>
