Churches.<br/>
<br/>
The only churches in Cairo of any historical interest<br/>
are the Coptic churches, having been founded in the<br/>
first centuries of the Christian era. For all those who<br/>
do not make churches a special study, a passing visit to<br/>
Abu Sargah (St. Sergius) in Old Cairo will suffice, as it<br/>
is the most interesting Coptic church, and may be considered as a prototype.<br/>
<br/>
The churches of other sects are of more or less recent<br/>
date, and it is only the form of service which may be<br/>
interesting.<br/>

Greeks, and the Church of St. Nicolas, which was restored a few years ago and contains some fine paintings.<br/>
The patriarchal library is very rich, and contains many<br/>
precious MSS. of the history of the Christian church<br/>
in Egypt<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
