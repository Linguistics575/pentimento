<span>that they must have come from the avenue of Sphinxes<br/>
of which Strabo wrote in his description of the Serapeum.<br/>
Some time after he found at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkiirah </span>a Sphinx exactly<br/>
similar to those he had already seen, and divined with<br/>
the great perspicacity which has always guided him in<br/>
his excavations<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>that he was on the site of the monument<br/>
that had been so vainly sought after by archaeologists<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>Mariette immediately began the excavations, which<br/>
were suspended<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>however. for some time by order of the<br/>
Egyptian Government, and found the avenue of the<br/>
Sphinxes, two chapels, eleven statues of Greek philosophers, and the Tombs of the Apis-Bulls with thousands<br/>
of bronze votive statuettes and innumerable votive tables,<br/>
the inscriptions on which are of immense value to history<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>because the chronology of Egypt has been determined by<br/>
means of them as far as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">XVI </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilth </span>dynasty. Most of<br/>
these objects are now in the Louvre Museum<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Paris.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Apises </span>or Sacred Bulls of Memphis were buried in<br/>
underground caves over which chapels were erected. All<br/>
these chapels together, surrounded by a high wall, with<br/>
two pylons. to which the avenue of the Sphinxes led<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>formed the Serapeum<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Of that part of the Serapeum<br/>
which was above ground only a few vestiges remain<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and<br/>
the subterranean parts, which can only be visited, are the<br/>
caves which were used as tombs from the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Psam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">metichus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">663-609</span>) to the time of the Ptolemies<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>It is a gallery about <span style="color: #0000FF;">1,200-it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>long, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lO-it.wide</span>, and 18-ft. high,<br/>
on both <span style="color: #ff0000;">sidesof </span>which <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-four </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>of red or black<br/>
granite or limestone still occupy their original positions<br/>
in small caves hewn in the rock. Each of these sarcophagi measures <span style="color: #ff0000;">13x8x12-ft.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and is cut out of one<br/>
block, as is also the lid<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Three of them are covered by<br/>
hieroglyphics and bear the names of Amosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l. </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">XXVIth<br/>
</span>dynasty), Cambyses, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chabbesha</span>. These tombs, as<br/>
well as almost all others, have been opened in ancient<br/>
time, and Mariette found precious objects only in two<br/>
of them.<br/>
<br/>
About 10 minutes to the north-east from the Serapeum<br/>
is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastaba </span>of Ti, one of the best preserved of the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">55<br/>
<br/>
