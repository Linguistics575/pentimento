<span>ten minutes. On the left is an ancient Turkish fortress,<br/>
and about half a mile distant to the right are the ruins<br/>
of the mosque <span style="color: #ff0000;">ETGit1shi</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The view from the summit during sunset is wonderful<span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>it embraces the panorama of the town with its numerous<br/>
minarets, all the country from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tuna </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matariyeh</span>, the<br/>
course of the Nile as far as the Barrage, the edge of the<br/>
Libyan desert, and those most majestic monuments of<br/>
Egyptian antiquity, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pyramids<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Small Petrified Forest and<br/>
the Spring <span style="color: #0000FF;">bf </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Moses<br/>
<br/>
</span>The small petrified forest, as it is usually called, is<br/>
about two hours distant by donkey, and lies to the<br/>
south-east of Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
It is a vast extent of desert over which are scattered<br/>
thousands of pieces of petrified wood, as well as many complete trunks of trees, some of the latter being about 40-ft.<br/>
long. As there are neither branches nor roots to be<br/>
found, it is supposed that the pieces of wood and trunks<br/>
of trees were carried to their present position by the<br/>
water, and became petrified by the influence of the<br/>
silicate contained in the sand.<br/>
<br/>
The roads which lead to it are not very easy to find,<br/>
therefore it will be well to be provided with a good guide.<br/>
One road leads along the top of the Mokattam. It is,<br/>
however, better to go by the Tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs </span>and<br/>
ascend to the plateau between the Red Mountain (Gebel<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Akhmar</span>), which one leaves to the left, and the Mokattam,<br/>
the eastern slopes of which one continues to follow<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
