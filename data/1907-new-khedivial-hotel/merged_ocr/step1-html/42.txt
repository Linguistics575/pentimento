the coast of Spain by the wreck of the vessel which was<br/>
transporting it.<br/>

</span>The Sphinx.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the monuments in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis </span>of Ghizeh,<br/>
excepting the pyramids, the Sphinx is the most famous<br/>
and interesting. It is cut out of the natural rock, and<br/>
represents a crouching lion with a human head. The<br/>
body is simply roughed out, but the head has been<br/>
sculptured with great care. The headdress, a part of the<br/>
beard, and the red colour of the face have disappeared<span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>the face itself, especially the nose, has been much damaged<br/>
by the conquering Arabs, above all by the Mamelukes,<br/>
who used it as a target. The body is <span style="color: #0000FF;">150-ft. </span>long, the<br/>
paws 50-ft. The well-proportioned head is 30-ft. high<br/>
and 14-ft. broad<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>a person standing on the top of one<br/>
ear cannot reach the top of the head.<br/>
<br/>
The Arabs call the Sphinx <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abu-el=H6n </span>(father of the<br/>
terror), and believe it has the power to protect the crops<br/>
from the encroachment of the sand.<br/>
<br/>
The Sphinx was named by the ancient Egyptians<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>Hu," and represents the god Harmachis "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hermem<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">chut </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">( </span>Horus on the horizon). Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span>. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">XVIIIth<br/>
</span>dynasty), whose name we often see accompanied by the<br/>
image of the Sphinx, chose it for his patron.<br/>
<br/>
The origin of the Sphinx is surrounded by mystery;<br/>
but what is certain, is that it already existed in the time<br/>
of Chu-fu and Chefren, as is proved by an inscription<br/>
found by Mariette near the pyramids, and that it was<br/>
probably restored by those two kings.<br/>
