<span>Khalig, the canal which flows from one end of Cairo to<br/>
the other, and after a few minutes Old Cairo (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Masr-elAteeka</span>) is reached.<br/>
<br/>
Scarcely 90 yards from the canal stands a three-storied<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>hexagonal stone tower; this tower is the head-main of<br/>
the aqueduct built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saliiheddin </span>to supply the Citadel<br/>
with water. This aqueduct, about three and a half<br/>
miles long, is constructed on Gothic arches, and is stayed<br/>
by heavy buttresses. Several parts <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>it had to be removed<br/>
to make way for the railway, only some fragments being<br/>
now left<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>In the Coptic quarter, which is built on the ruins of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>Fostat," one may still recognise the walls of a Roman<br/>
castle built on the site of the Persian fortress Babylon.<br/>
Here also is the famous Coptic Church, Abu Sargah<br/>
(Saint Sergius), which may be considered as the type of<br/>
the ancient Egyptian Churches. According to tradition,<br/>
the crypt under the church served as refuge to the Holy<br/>
Virgin after her <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight </span>to Egypt. This crypt dates from<br/>
the Arab conquest, whilst the church itself is of more<br/>
recent date. Some of the carvings in wood and ivory<br/>
representing the birth of our Redeemer, the Last Supper,<br/>
and several saints, are very interesting, and as ancient<br/>
as the church.<br/>
<br/>
There are still several other <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span>and Greek Orthodox<br/>
Churches in the Coptic quarter, as well as two synagogues<br/>
that are interesting only to the learned.<br/>
<br/>
North of the Coptic quarter one finds the mosque of<br/>
Amru, (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gamifa </span>Amr-ibn-el-As). The original mosque,<br/>
built by the Khalif Omar's general, has disappeared<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>it<br/>
has been destroyed and reconstructed several times.<br/>
Some parts of the present mosque date from the fifteenth<br/>
century. Formerly the columns of the interior arcades<br/>
numbered 366; they were taken from Roman and<br/>
Byzantine buildings, and have a great variety of capitals<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>By a strange hazard the white veins of one of the grey<br/>
marble columns form the names Allah, Mohammed, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sui√©man </span>in Arabic characters<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In 1808 a curious spectacle<br/>
was presented at the mosque of Amru of an assembly of<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-44<br/>
<br/>
