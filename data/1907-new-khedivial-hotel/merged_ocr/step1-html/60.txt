<br/>
</span>Though the treasures of the Ghizeh Museum and the<br/>
Pyramids astonish us; it is only by visiting the monuments of Upper Egypt that we can get a concise <span style="color: #0000FF;">idea </span>of<br/>
the high degree of civilisation to which the Ancient<br/>
Egyptians had attained.<br/>
<br/>
The voyage to Upper Egypt, which was formerly so<br/>
difficult and expensive, has become, by means of the<br/>
commodious steamers now on the Nile, a very pleasant<br/>
pleasure trip, available even to persons of moderate<br/>
means.<br/>
<br/>
The steamboats, <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyehs</span>, and Hotels at Louxor<br/>
and Assouan have been expressly built with all the comfort and luxury desirable, and travellers will not fail to<br/>
find all that consideration to which they have been<br/>
accustomed.<br/>
<br/>
The firm of Cook & Son also presents its clients, who<br/>
visit Upper Egypt, with a beautiful Guide, ably written<br/>
by E. A. WALLIS BUDGE, F.S.A., Acting-Assistant<br/>
Keeper in the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian<br/>
Antiquities, British Museum.<br/>
