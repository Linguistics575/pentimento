<span>tombs of ancient Egyptian dignitaries, it dates from the<br/>
time of the IVth dynasty, and is therefore about 4,500<br/>
years old. The outside of this tomb is not to be seen,<br/>
and is of little interest, as the whole building is buried<br/>
in the sand. The interior is so much the more <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting<br/>
</span>for the magnificent sculptures and paintings with which<br/>
the walls are decorated. Space does not allow us to give<br/>
a detailed description of the whole mastaba. Let us only<br/>
remember the sculptures represent Ti superintending the<br/>
various operations connected with the management of his<br/>
large agricultural estates and farmyard, together with<br/>
illustrations of his hunting and fishing expeditions. The<br/>
figure of Ti is easily recognized, being much larger than<br/>
any of his workpeople.<br/>
<br/>
Around the Serapeum are also to be found the Mastabas<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptahotep </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saba</span>, in the interior of which are<br/>
numerous sculptures similar to those in the tomb of Ti.<br/>
These two mastabas are hidden in the sand, and can only<br/>
be visited by a special order.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Méra, discovered in the autumn of 1893<br/>
by Mr. de Morgan, contains thirty-one chambers with<br/>
bas-relief<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and the statue of Méra. It dates from the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Vilth </span>dynasty (<span style="color: #0000FF;">rc</span>. 2500).<br/>
<br/>
Among the other monuments of the Necropolis of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>that one may visit, and which are near the Step<br/>
Pyramid, may be mentioned the Pyramid of Unas<br/>
(Vth dynasty, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Be </span>2600), that was searched by Mr.<br/>
Maspéro in the year 1891 at the expense of Messrs. Thos.<br/>
Cook & Son. The walls of the funeral chambers are<br/>
covered with very interesting ritual texts. The black<br/>
basalt sarcophagus was found broken.<br/>
<br/>
Three quarters of an hour south of the Step Pyramid<br/>
there is a group of Pyramids, the most remarkable of<br/>
which are those of the Kings Pepi l. (VIth dynasty, <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>.<br/>
2530), and Sokar-em-Saf (<span style="color: #0000FF;">IIIrd </span>dynasty, B.C. 2900).<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastaba-el-Feratin</span>, which is always in sight, is<br/>
supposed to be the tomb of King Unas<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
