</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">In </span>the East the shops of merchants of a particular article,<br/>
or the artisans of a particular trade are united and form a<br/>
Khan (district) named after the goods sold in them.<br/>
Formerly several of these districts formed a quarter enclosed<br/>
by heavy gates, which were closed at night. Some of these<br/>
gates still remain in Cairo, but they are never closed<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>The Cairo Bazaars are in the streets right and left of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sikket-Gedideh</span>, the upper part of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mooskee </span>Street.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siiik-lKhamzani </span>European glass and crockery<br/>
ware is exposed for sale. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">SincVAttarin </span>(grocers),<br/>
oil of roses, perfumes, and spices. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siuove1aa2ahhammin<br/>
</span>articles from Algeria and Tunis, especially cloth. At<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Siuoae1-Sudar</span>, one finds articles from the Sudan, es.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">pecially </span>gum and fruits of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">d </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">im </span>palm-tree. The most<br/>
important and attractive bazaar, one that ought to be<br/>
visited several times. is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khan-el=Khalil</span>, near the<br/>
Mosque Hasanein. It was built towards the end of the<br/>
thirteenth century<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and forms quite a quarter with one<br/>
principal street and numerous alleys formed by the shops<br/>
ranged at the side of one another. Here are to be found<br/>
silk stuffs. jewellery, brass articles<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and Persian carpets.<br/>
In this same bazaar is a beautiful Arab gate with ornaments, inscriptions, and mosaics well worthy of attention. Near the gate is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stik-el-Saigh </span>where objects<br/>
in gold and silver filigree are sold, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sti1o.ellNahhasin</span>, where the <span style="color: #ff0000;">coppersmiths </span>offer their wares.<br/>
<br/>
The bazaars are the centres of Arab business<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and<br/>
therefore for travellers the most interesting of the Arab<br/>
quarters; they should consequently often be visited, as<br/>
they give one an opportunity of seeing and studying<br/>
oriental types. One sees there the rich merchant clothed<br/>
in silk, and the beggar covered with rags, the simple<br/>
