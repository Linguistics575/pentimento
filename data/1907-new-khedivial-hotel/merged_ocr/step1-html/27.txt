<span>the walls are made of alabaster from the quarries of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Beni-Su√©f</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>hence the name Alabaster Mosque by which<br/>
it is known.<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">richly-decorated </span>interior at the south-west<br/>
angle, is the tomb of Mohammed Aly (1849) surrounded<br/>
by a beautiful railing.<br/>
<br/>
The effect produced at a distance by the dome and two<br/>
minarets that dominate the town is very picturesque, and<br/>
the Gama'a Mohammed Aly may he considered as the<br/>
most distinctive feature of Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the barracks occupied by the British troops,<br/>
the stores, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>there are within the <span style="color: #0000FF;">enceinte </span>of the<br/>
Citadel several other mosques, one of which, the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gama'a-Ibn-Kaiatin</span>, dates from A.D. 1317.<br/>
<br/>
South of the Gama'a Mohammed Aly is Joseph's<br/>
Well, so named, not after the Biblical Joseph whom<br/>
the dragomen say was imprisoned in it, but after<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Salaheddin</span>'s first name, that was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yfissuf </span>or Joseph.<br/>
The well was sunk by the ancient Egyptians and cleared<br/>
during the construction of the Citadel, which it still<br/>
continues to supply with water.<br/>
<br/>
It is about 290-ft. deep, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakiyieh </span>(machine for<br/>
raising the water) being half-way down.<br/>
<br/>
In the narrow way by which one ascends to the Citadel<br/>
from the side of the town, the massacre of the Mamelukes,<br/>
ordered by Mohammed Aly, took place A.D. 1811. The<br/>
only Mameluke who succeeded in escaping jumped his<br/>
horse over the battlements<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
