<span>Europeans. The native population is principally composed of Fellahs, Copts, Turks, and Jews, to which<br/>
must be added Negroes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bedouins</span>, and people from<br/>
neighbouring countries.<br/>
<br/>
The history of Cairo begins with the Arabs<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Amr-Ibn-el-As</span>, having invaded Egypt in A.D. 638,<br/>
founded on the spot of the ancient fortress Babylon the<br/>
town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fostiit</span>, named thus for his having pitched there<br/>
his tent, <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span>in Arabic, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ik </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fostiit</span>."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahmed-Ibn-Non </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khamariyeh </span>contributed <span style="color: #0000FF;">very<br/>
<br/>
</span>' much to the enlargement of the city, the former by <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructing </span>the mosque that bears his name and the latter<br/>
by building a grand palace.<br/>
<br/>
In A.D. 869 the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalif </span>Muizz, having conquered<br/>
Egypt, founded near <span style="color: #0000FF;">frost-it </span>a new capital that he named<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Masr-ekKahira</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fostiit</span>, which was also called Masr<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>then took the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Masr-el=Ateeka </span>(Old Cairo).<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Salhheddin </span>enclosed the town by a fortification and constructed a Citadel, and each of the following sultans<br/>
added some new monuments that contributed to make<br/>
Cairo, notwithstanding <span style="color: #0000FF;">conflagrations </span>and wars, one <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the most beautiful cities of Islam<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>In 1517 Cairo was taken by Selim <span style="color: #0000FF;">l.</span>, who made Egypt<br/>
a Turkish pashalic. In 1798 Bonaparte made it his<br/>
headquarters, and in 1806 Mohammed Aly made his<br/>
entrance in it.<br/>
<br/>
Since the middle of the last century, Cairo has<br/>
rapidly developed, thanks to successive Khedives, who<br/>
intelligently favoured the immigration of the European<br/>
element. On the north side the fortifications have quite<br/>
disappeared, and new quarters have been founded at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fagallah </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh</span>. On the west side the new<br/>
quarters of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismailiyeh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewhkiyeh</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr-el-Dubarah</span>,<br/>
with wide boulevards planted with fine trees, have<br/>
already reached the Nile and the port of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biilak</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Being the principal residence of <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.H</span>. the Khedive<br/>
Abbas Pasha <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hilmi </span>and of the Consuls General, the seat<br/>
of Government and State Administrations, Cairo does not<br/>
fail to do honour as the capital of Egypt, and life passes<br/>
