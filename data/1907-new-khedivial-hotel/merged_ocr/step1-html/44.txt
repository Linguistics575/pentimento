<span>Campbell's Tomb.<br/>
<br/>
This tomb, named after Campbell, <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.B.M</span>. Consul in<br/>
Egypt at the epoch of its discovery, is situated about 200<br/>
paces to the west of the Sphinx. It is a shaft 55-ft. deep,<br/>
at the bottom of which is a very large mortuary chamber.<br/>
In the year 1837 Voss discovered it, and found four<br/>
sarcophagi which had been already violated.<br/>
<br/>
The pyramids of Ghizeh are surrounded by tombs of<br/>
priests and high dignitaries, of little interest to the<br/>
tourist. Near both the great and third pyramids is a<br/>
group of three small pyramids, having served as tombs<br/>
for the relatives of the builders of the pyramids.<br/>
<br/>
Near the north-west angle of the great pyramid is the<br/>
Khedivial Kiosk, in which is installed a photographer,<br/>
whose speciality is to photograph visitors on camel-back,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">or'on </span>the steps of the great pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
The monuments of Ghizeh are confided to the care of<br/>
Bedouins of extraordinary cupidity. The simplest<br/>
manner of getting rid of them is to provide oneself a<br/>
guide to all the monuments. Besides the tip given to<br/>
this Cicerone, visitors have to pay the fees as noted in the<br/>
notice on the following page<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The antiquities the Bedouins offer for sale are of little<br/>
value, and are often only imitations. Therefore, it will<br/>
be well to make a considerable reduction on their prices.<br/>
<br/>
Should visitors be photographed at the Pyramids they<br/>
will do well to pay for them only on delivery<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
