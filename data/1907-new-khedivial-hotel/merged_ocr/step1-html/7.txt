</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">THIN </span>a few yards from Cook's Office, on the way<br/>
to the Railway Station, stands the magnificent<br/>
structure of the New Khedivial Hotel.<br/>
<br/>
This popular family Hotel is situated in the centre<br/>
of the City, in close proximity to the Opera House, the<br/>
various Theatres, Banks, Post Office, and the principal<br/>
agencies. It was built in 1904 under the superintendence of competent engineers, and is therefore a perfect<br/>
modern building, combining every modern appliance.<br/>
The sanitary arrangements have been specially considered.<br/>
The staircase, corridors, and balconies are of white<br/>
marble, and the building in general is fire-proof throughout.<br/>
<br/>
It is splendidly located on the main avenue, from<br/>
whence <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.H</span>. the Khedive can be seen twice a day driving<br/>
by: whilst the ever-changing scenes of the various<br/>
events and the native life can be witnessed at the same<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Owing to the situation of the Hotel most of the rooms<br/>
receive throughout the day the charming rays of the<br/>
sun, an advantage to be prized by all flying from the<br/>
rigorous northern winter in search of health and comfort<br/>
in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Being open to the four winds the Hotel possesses a<br/>
great circulation of air, thus rendering the stay pleasant<br/>
even in the summer months.<br/>
<br/>
Every Bed Room is lofty, airy, and richly furnished,<br/>
and the Hotel is lit throughout by electricity.<br/>
<br/>
An Electric Lift is on the premises for the convenience<br/>
of guests<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
