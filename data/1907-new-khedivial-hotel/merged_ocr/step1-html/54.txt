<span>The Ruins of Memphis and the<br/>
Necropolis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sukiiiriih</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A whole day is required to visit <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkiirah</span>. The train<br/>
for Upper Egypt, leaving Cairo at 8 <span style="color: #0000FF;">a.m.</span>, passes <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrashtn</span>, where donkeys are in readiness to go to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkiirah</span>.<br/>
The return journey may be made by train leaving <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrashin </span>at 6 p.m. or by crossing the Nile by boat and thence<br/>
by donkeys to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Helwiin</span>, from whence trains start every<br/>
hour for Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
Messrs. Cook & Son have very agreeable weekly excursions by Steam Launch and donkeys to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakk√©rah</span>,<br/>
that have much to recommend them.<br/>
<br/>
Those persons who have no card to visit the <span style="color: #ff0000;">menuments </span>of Upper Egypt must be provided with local<br/>
tickets (<span style="color: #0000FF;">P.T</span>. 5), to be obtained at Cook's Office, the<br/>
Hotel porters, or from the railway station-master at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrashin</span>. Price for donkeys, P. T. 10 and a fee to the<br/>
donkey boy.<br/>
<br/>
Provisions (eatables and drinkables, candles and<br/>
magnesium wire to visit the monuments) to be taken<br/>
from Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
All that remains of ancient Memphis, formerly <span style="color: #ff0000;">oneyof<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">most </span>powerful and populous cities of Egypt and of<br/>
antiquity, are some rubbish mounds covered with palm<br/>
trees, masses of broken bricks and pottery, some blocks<br/>
of granite, and a few mutilated statues, Apart from the<br/>
vast Necropolis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkitrah</span>, it is difficult to believe that<br/>
one stands on the site of such a great city.<br/>
<br/>
The disappearance of Memphis has, however, nothing<br/>
enigmatic about it. The houses, being built of sundried<br/>
bricks, were doomed to disappear as soon as they were<br/>
abandoned. With regard to the temples and palaces<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>solidly built to defy time and weather, they were<br/>
sacked and destroyed by the successive conquerors of<br/>
Egypt. Above all, the Arabs were the worst sinners in<br/>
this respect, by using the ruins of Memphis, little by<br/>
