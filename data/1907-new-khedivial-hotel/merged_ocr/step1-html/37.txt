<span>The ancient Greeks and Romans considered the pyramids as one of the seven wonders of the world, and all<br/>
the Greek authors who have visited Egypt have not<br/>
failed to speak of them with admiration. Herodotus, who<br/>
visited Egypt <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.c</span>. 470-460, gives a very exact <span style="color: #0000FF;">des</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">scription </span>of the monuments.<br/>
<br/>
According to Arab authors they were built by King<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirid </span>300 years before the Deluge.<br/>
<br/>
There are many theories concerning the manner in<br/>
which they were constructed, but the most plausible is<br/>
that of Dr. Lepsius, who solves the different problems on<br/>
this subject in a very satisfactory <span style="color: #ff0000;">manner</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">c </span>Before the actual building of a pyramid was begun<br/>
a suitable rocky site was chosen and cleared, a mass of<br/>
rock<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>possible, being left in the middle of the area to<br/>
form the core of the building. The chambers and the<br/>
galleries leading to them were next planned and excavated.<br/>
Around the core a truncated pyramid building was made,<br/>
the angles of which were filled up with blocks of stone.<br/>
Layer after layer of stone was then built around the<br/>
work, which grew larger and larger until it was finished.<br/>
When a king ascended the throne, he built for himself a<br/>
small but complete tomb-pyramid, and afresh coating of<br/>
stone was built around it every year that he reigned; and<br/>
when he died the sides of the pyramids were like long<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flights </span>of steps, which his successor filled up with right<br/>
angled triangular blocks of stone. The door of the<br/>
pyramid was walled after the body of its builder had been<br/>
laid in it, and thus remained a finished tomb. Near the<br/>
core of the pyramid the work is more carefully executed<br/>
than near the exterior; that is to say, as the time <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the<br/>
king's death approached, the work was more hurriedly<br/>
performed."<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Lepsius' theory also explains in a very natural<br/>
way the difference in size of the pyramids of different<br/>
kings.<br/>
<br/>
The writings of Arabic authors and travellers of the<br/>
seventeenth century bear witness to the fact of the pyramids<br/>
having been faced with a smooth covering bearing in,<br/>
