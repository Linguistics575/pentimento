<span>In 1889 the Museum was transferred from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bulak </span>to<br/>
the Palace of Ismail Pasha at Ghizeh (built in an immense<br/>
park at an expense of nearly one million pounds), and<br/>
was opened by <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.H</span>. the Khedive in January, 1890.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Grébaut was succeeded in the year 1892 by Mr. de<br/>
Morgan, who has reorganised and much enriched the<br/>
collection by many objects which were formerly kept in<br/>
the stores for want of space. Then Mr. de Morgan was<br/>
entrusted by the French Government with an <span style="color: #0000FF;">archaeological </span>Mission in Persia, and Mr. Maspéro assumed again<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">superintendence </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Service des <span style="color: #ff0000;">antiquits's<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptiennes</span>."<br/>
<br/>
The Ghizeh Palace being built with light materials<br/>
there was a constant danger of <span style="color: #ff0000;">tsonflagration</span>, and as<br/>
many monuments on the ground floor began to be<br/>
injured by the dampness, the Egyptian Government<br/>
finally decided to construct a special building to shelter<br/>
definitely that precious collection.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the extraordinary measures taken during<br/>
the transfer, none of the objects were damaged or lost.<br/>
<br/>
The collection of the Egyptian Museum surpasses all<br/>
other similar collections by its wealth in monuments of<br/>
the first six dynasties and by the fact that the places<br/>
where the greater number of antiquities were found are<br/>
well located. The Museum contains also a great<br/>
number of monuments and statues in a complete state,<br/>
and owes this <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>to the fact that the director or the<br/>
conservator was present at the excavation of the sites when<br/>
they were found, and personally superintended their<br/>
transport.<br/>
<br/>
The collection of scarabs, formerly very rich, has for<br/>
some reason or other been considerably reduced, and<br/>
many European antiquaries and museums possess the<br/>
most beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Space will not permit us to make even a short reference<br/>
to the most important monuments. Let us only remember<br/>
the famous wooden statue of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shtkh-el-Btsled</span>, the<br/>
stone of Tanis with the celebrated decree of Canope, the<br/>
treasure of the Queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">A2h-hotep</span>, the royal mummies <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
