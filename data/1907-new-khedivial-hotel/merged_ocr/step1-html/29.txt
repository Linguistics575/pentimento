</span>The Khedivial Library, which is placed in the palace<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Darb-el-Gamameez</span>, near the Ministry of Public <span style="color: #ff0000;">lnstruetion</span>, was formed by the Khedive Ismail Pasha in<br/>
1870, and has been greatly enriched by gifts, especially<br/>
by the donation of Mustapha Pasha's library.<br/>
<br/>
The Library contains over 50,000 volumes, of which<br/>
18,000 are in European languages, 29,000 in Arabic, and<br/>
about 3,000 in different oriental languages.<br/>
<br/>
The section of Egyptian Philology consists exclusively of European works concerning Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The Library is open every day from 8 <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>till 1 p.m.,<br/>
except Fridays and Moslem holidays (entrance free).<br/>

There are special catalogues for the exposition of the<br/>
Koran MSS, and the Egyptian philological section<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and a<br/>
general catalogue (in three volumes) of all the European<br/>
works.<br/>
<br/>
The collection of Oriental <span style="color: #ff0000;">MSS</span>. is on the ground <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor</span>.<br/>
It contains (in the principal Hall) Koran MSS. of all sizes<br/>
and epochs, and includes many masterpieces of Arabian<br/>

of its kind that exists, and its value is inestimable from<br/>
every standpoint.<br/>
<br/>
In the lateral halls are exhibited Persian and Turkish<br/>
MSS., many of which are ornamented with splendid vignettes.<br/>
