<span>Deir-el-Bahary (Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, his son Rhamses ll.), and lastly,<br/>
the wonderful treasures found by Mr. de Morgan at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dashdr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>passing through the new <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismailiyeh </span>quarter in a<br/>
westerly direction, one arrives at the great bridge of<br/>
Kasr-el-Nil. This fine piece of engineering work, which<br/>
is about 1,200-ft. in length, spans the Nile and connects<br/>
the town with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>(island), where may be found<br/>
one of the finest carriage drives imaginable. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedivial </span>Sporting Club has here magnificent grounds for<br/>
riding, driving, and polo. It is very interesting to stand<br/>
at either end of the bridge early in the morning and<br/>
watch the native peasants coming into the town on<br/>
donkeys or camels with their different wares which they<br/>
take to the respective markets to sell.<br/>
<br/>
On crossing the bridge and <span style="color: #0000FF;">continuing </span>in almost a<br/>
straight line the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>promenade is reached: then<br/>
