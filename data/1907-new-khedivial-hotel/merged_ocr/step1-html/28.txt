</span>The Arab Museum was installed up to this day in a<br/>
part of the Gama'a-el-Hakem<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and is just being transferred in a splendid new building, in the Arabic style,<br/>
erected especially for this collection and the "Khedivial<br/>
Library" on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bab-el-Khalk</span>" Square, midway of<br/>
the Mohammed Aly Street.<br/>
<br/>
The Museum, under the direction of Herz Bey, contains a very rich collection of objects of the Arab epoch<br/>
that are of an artistic or archaeological interest, and have<br/>
chiefly been taken from ruined mosques and secular<br/>
buildings.<br/>
<br/>

to visit this museum are the same as for the mosques<br/>
(RT. 2).<br/>
<br/>
Among the most beautiful objects in the Museum we<br/>
may point out: A collection of splendid enamelled glass<br/>
lamps, the richest that exist; a magnificent agate<br/>
bowl, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ll-ft. </span>in diameter and 4-in. thick, beautifully faceted;<br/>
