<span>The most beautiful of these tomb mosques is certainly<br/>
that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalt </span>Bey (A.D. 1468-1496). The high dome is<br/>
richly decorated and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">minaret</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>are extremely elegant.<br/>
<br/>
The mosque of Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barktik</span>, with two very imposing and elegant domes, has had to be propped on all<br/>
sides to prevent it from falling.<br/>
<br/>
In the mosque of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bursbey </span>(A.D. 1422-1438), there are<br/>
some fine mosaics and some pierced-plaster windows.<br/>
<br/>
Among a great number of other tombs, note those of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kansuweh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eGGhtirl </span>(A.D. 1501-16), Yussuf <span style="color: #ff0000;">elAshraf</span>, the tomb of the Seven Women (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Saba'ii </span>Banat)<br/>
that of the Mother of <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Ashraf </span>(Um-el-Ashraf) and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Okella </span>Kait-Bey completely in ruins.<br/>
<br/>
To return to Cairo, take the road between the tombs<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sitt-khawiinda </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siiilemttn </span>Agha el-Wali<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>leaving the hill of the windmills to the right and taking<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sikket-Gedide </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mooskee</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The view to be obtained from the hill of the windmills over the tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs </span>will, <span style="color: #ff0000;">especiallyduring<br/>
</span>sunset, be one of the most agreeable souvenirs one can<br/>
take away from Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The Tombs of the Mamelukes.<br/>
<br/>
The Tombs of the Mamelukes are situated to the<br/>
south of the Citadel and are in a complete state of ruin,<br/>
although the few minarets and domes that are still<br/>
standing bear witness to the ancient beauty of those<br/>
buildings.<br/>
<br/>
As there are no inscriptions except verses from the<br/>
Koran, even the names of the personages buried there<br/>
are unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Around these ruins the Arab cemeteries extend in<br/>
every direction<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
