<span>The Sphinx was for many years buried in the sand,<br/>
only the head being visible. Caviglia was the first to<br/>
completely clear it, and found between its paws and<br/>
close against its breast an open temple, with a small lion<br/>
and divers steles. One of these bears an inscription which<br/>
mentions the restoration of the Sphinx by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thothmes<br/>
</span>IV. (1533 <span style="color: #ff0000;">3.0</span>.), and throws some light on its history.<br/>
Formerly it was considered a work of the Middle Empire,<br/>
whilst it is in reality one of the earliest works of the<br/>
Ancient Empire.<br/>

The Temple of Granite.<br/>
<br/>
A little to the south-west of the Sphinx is a fine specimen<br/>
of the simple and solid architecture of the Ancient Empire;<br/>
it is a temple built of enormous granite blocks. Mariette<br/>
discovered it in 1853, and found some statues of Chefren<br/>
in it, by which we are led to suppose that he built it<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>These statues are now in the Egyptian Museum.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Numbers.<br/>
<br/>
On the western edge of the plateau, near the Arab<br/>
village, is the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">chii-f-Ribd1nch</span>, a priest<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and his<br/>
wife HERN-KA, both related to Chefren. On the west<br/>
wall in the interior of the mastaba is a very finely sculptured bas-relief representing the scribes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chai-f-Ria-tinch</span>,<br/>
numbering their master's cattle. Near the driver of each<br/>
herd is found the number of beasts under his care. Hence<br/>
the name of the mastaba.<br/>
