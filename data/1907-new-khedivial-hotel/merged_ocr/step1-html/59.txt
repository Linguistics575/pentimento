</span>The Pyramids of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dash </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ir</span>, at the extreme south of the<br/>
vast <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis </span>of Memphis and about three miles from<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastaba-el-Ferrin</span>, has just acquired an <span style="color: #0000FF;">extraordinary </span>notoriety by the discovery by Mr. de Morgan,<br/>
in March, 1894, of a double treasure which belonged to<br/>
three Egyptian princesses who were related to Egyptian<br/>
kings of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">XIIth </span>dynasty (3.0. 2300).<br/>
<br/>
These treasures consist of jewellery in solid gold and<br/>
precious stones, which, whether we consider their intrinsic value or beauty of design and execution, far<br/>
surpass previous discoveries.<br/>
<br/>
Of the six <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dashtir </span>Pyramids, four of brick and two of<br/>
stone, the most remarkable is the Blunted Pyramid, so<br/>
called because the lower part is inclined at a different<br/>
angle to the upper part<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
