<span>Some of this smooth covering still remains near the<br/>
summit of the Second Pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
A very interesting fact in connection with their position<br/>
is that the cardinal points are always exactly determined<br/>
and that the entrance is always on the north side.<br/>

In the fifth and fourth centuries <span style="color: #ff0000;">13.0. </span>the Persian conquerors broke open the Ghizeh pyramids and carried<br/>
away the treasures which no doubt they contained.<br/>
<br/>
The Romans and the Khalif <span style="color: #ff0000;">Miimfin </span>also entered them<br/>
and found that others had preceded them.<br/>
<br/>
It is easy to understand how the builders of the mosques<br/>
were tempted to regard the pyramids as-mere quarries;<br/>
in fact, a great many of the sacred and secular Arab<br/>
buildings in Cairo were erected with blocks from that<br/>
source. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Melik-el-Kamil </span>attempted to destroy the small<br/>
(third) pyramid of Ghizeh about the end of the twelfth<br/>
century, but after months of vain efforts had to abandon<br/>
it, having only succeeded in removing the facing of one<br/>
side<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

Half a day, at least, is necessary to visit the Ghizeh<br/>
group of pyramids. They are the nearest to Cairo, and<br/>
forty minutes by Electric tram starting from Kasr-el-Nil,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>one-and-a-half hour distant by carriage or Mena House<br/>
coach.<br/>
<br/>
The road there, planted with beautiful acacia trees,<br/>
follows the Nile, passes the Ghizeh Museum, and, turning<br/>
abruptly to the right just as the village of Ghizeh is<br/>
reached, continues afterwards 5 miles in a straight line<br/>
to the edge of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
On both sides of this raised road, extending as far as<br/>
the eye can reach, are level fields that are transformed<br/>
