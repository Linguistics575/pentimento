<span>little, to build the mosques and palaces of the capital<br/>
they had founded.<br/>
<br/>
On the road which leads across the palm plantations<br/>
from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrashin </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah</span>, and near the village <span style="color: #ff0000;">MitRahhina</span>, there are two gigantic Statues of Rhamses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The more recently discovered of these is in black<br/>
granite, and lies on a small mound, the face turned<br/>
upwards<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The second colossus is to be found sheltered in a<br/>
wooden hut in the interior of which are some steps that<br/>
lead to a small platform from where the statue can be<br/>
easily examined. The statue is sculptured out of hard<br/>
and very fine-grained limestone, and is wrought very<br/>
carefully. Its total length (the legs are missing) must<br/>
have been about <span style="color: #ff0000;">45-ft</span>. The head is covered with the<br/>
royal coif, decorated with the serpent <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ureus</span>; the chin is<br/>
represented with a false beard; on the right shoulder is<br/>
the prenomen of Rhamses "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ra-userma-sotep-en-Ra</span>,"<br/>
and on the breast his name in a cartouche held by the<br/>
gods Ptah and Sekhet; the neck is clasped by the necklace<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nena</span>, and the left hand holds the emblem of power.<br/>
<br/>
This statue was discovered by Sloane and Caviglia in<br/>
1820, referred to by British Museum.<br/>
<br/>
From, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mit-Rahhina </span>the road leads through palm<br/>
plantations to the Arab village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkiirah</span>. There the<br/>
desert and the Necropolis begin, an extended view of<br/>
which may be had as soon as the plateau is reached.<br/>
<br/>
For a distance of 15 miles from north to south, and an<br/>
average of <span style="color: #ff0000;">BOO-ft. </span>broad, are scattered funeral monuments of every kind of the time of the Ancient, Middle,<br/>
and New Empire.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all these tombs have been opened more than<br/>
once by avaricious conquerors, and the sand has been<br/>
searched over and over again. Notwithstanding, the<br/>
modern archaeologists, who have recently explored <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah</span>, have made discoveries that have greatly astonished<br/>
the civilized world.<br/>
<br/>
Visitors who only come to spend a little time in Egypt<br/>
will not have time to visit all the monuments of the<br/>
