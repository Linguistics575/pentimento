The carriages may be left at Mena House, and after<br/>
the remainder of a very sandy road has been walked, we<br/>
find ourselves before the Great Pyramid<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

The Great Pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
This, the greatest of the Ghizeh pyramids, was erected<br/>
by Chufu (the Cheops of the Greek), the second king of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">IVth </span>dynasty 3.0. 3733.<br/>
<br/>
The present measurement of each side is 755-ft. at the<br/>
base and 451-ft. high, but the original dimensions were<br/>
greater by 20 or 30-ft. The blocks of stone, of which<br/>
it is constructed, are from the quarries of Mokattam and<br/>
Turra, and the contents amount to 85,000,000 cubic<br/>
feet.<br/>
<br/>
The ascension is not <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult</span>, but very tiring, because<br/>
of the height of the stone blocks which average 3-ft.<br/>
high.<br/>
<br/>
Starting at the north east angle, aided by two or three<br/>
Bedouins, the top is reached in about 15 minutes. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A<br/>
