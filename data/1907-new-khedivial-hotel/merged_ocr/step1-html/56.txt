<span>Necropolis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkhrah</span>. Besides, many of them have<br/>
been covered up again to prevent them being ruined,<br/>
and can only be seen by means of a special and rather<br/>
expensive order because of the excavations they entail.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the following lines the traveller will find a description of the most important monuments which may be<br/>
visited in one or at most two days.<br/>
<br/>
By crossing many tombs buried in the sand, and<br/>
leaving several small Pyramids of little importance on<br/>
the right hand, the Step Pyramid is reached<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>This<br/>
Pyramid, visible from a great distance in every direction,<br/>
is generally attributed to King Teta of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ist </span>dynasty<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span>. 4366), it is therefore the most ancient monument<br/>
known in the world.<br/>
<br/>
The Pyramid is built in 6 steps, 38, 36, 341, 32, and<br/>
31-ft. high respectively, <span style="color: #0000FF;">6-7-ft. </span>deep, its rectangular base<br/>
being <span style="color: #ff0000;">352x396-ft.</span>; the entire height is 197-ft. It is<br/>
different to all other Pyramids in not being exactly built<br/>
as regards orientation.<br/>
<br/>
In the interior there are a great number of chambers<br/>
and a labyrinth of passages. The Prussian general,<br/>
Minutoli, entered in 1821 and found many very interesting objects that were, however, lost in transit to<br/>
Europe by shipwreck. It was subsequently explored by<br/>
Howard, Lepsius, Vyse, and Mariette.<br/>
<br/>
Its ascension is rather <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult</span>, and the view from the<br/>
top is not so fine as from the Great Ghizeh Pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the Step Pyramid we next go to Mariette's<br/>
House. Under the large verandah, which is provided<br/>
with tables and benches, one may rest and breakfast;<br/>
it was in this house, built by himself, that the immortal<br/>
French scientist, to whose genius science owes the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>covery of numerous Egyptian monuments<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>lived for<br/>
months, superintending the excavations which at last<br/>
resulted on the 12th November, 1851, in the discovery<br/>
of the Serapeum, the most important monument of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Having seen at Cairo and Alexandria Sphinxes bearing<br/>
the name of Osiris-Apis or Serapis, Mariette concluded<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-54<br/>
