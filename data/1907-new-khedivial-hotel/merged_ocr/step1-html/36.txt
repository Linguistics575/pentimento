The Pyramids.<br/>

(See copy of <span style="color: #0000FF;">regulations </span>on page 43)<br/>
<br/>
On the western bank of the Nile, at the edge of the<br/>
Libyan desert, the Pyramids of Abu <span style="color: #ff0000;">Roiish</span>, Ghizeh,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ziiwyet-el-Aryiin</span>, Abusir. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakksirah</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahshlir </span>are<br/>
ranged for a distance of twenty-five miles.<br/>
<br/>
Pyramids are always grouped, and are only to be<br/>
found in the centre of a necropolis. This fact constitutes<br/>
the best answer to all the theories contending the pyramids were constructed for other purposes than the tombs<br/>
erected by Egyptian kings who reigned before the invasion<br/>
of the Hyksos (1780 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.c.</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The tombs of the high officials, commonly called<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">mastiibas</span>, as well as other funeral monuments<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>are to be<br/>
found spread around the pyramids<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
