<span>surmounted by merlons, above which one only sees the<br/>
minarets and domes. The doorways are generally richly<br/>
decorated and sculptured. The doors themselves are<br/>
studded with very artistic fretted and engraved bronze<br/>
plates. The divided windows are often surmounted by<br/>
smaller ones, round or in the form of a heart. They<br/>
are of pierced plaster and ornamented with <span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured<br/>
</span>glass<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The minarets, absent <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the most ancient mosques<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>present a great variety of design. At about two-thirds<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>of the height is a kind of gallery or balcony from which<br/>
the "calls the faithful to prayer. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">minarets </span>as well as the domes are capped by great copper<br/>
crescents and are brilliantly illuminated at night during<br/>
the fast of Ramadan, presenting a most picturesque<br/>
aspect from the roof of any high house.<br/>
<br/>
Almost every mosque possesses a public fountain<br/>
named <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Sebil." <span style="color: #ff0000;">It </span>is a large hall separated from the<br/>
street by a bronze railing through which water is offered<br/>
to passers by. There is generally a primary school above<br/>
the sebil, from which resounds the hurly-burly of the<br/>
children reciting verses from the Koran. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">sebils </span>are<br/>
very often isolated buildings, and many of them are<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">f </span>splendid specimens of architecture.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the mosques, numerous small chapels named<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zawiyeh</span>," and many tombs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">sh√©khs</span>, generally of very<br/>
little interest<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>are scattered about the Arab quarters of<br/>
the town.<br/>
<br/>
Among the pious and religious monuments must also<br/>
be mentioned the Cloisters of dervishes (Tekiyeh), the<br/>
drinking fountains for animals (Had), and the asylums<br/>
and hospitals<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>Excepting the mosque of Amru at Old Cairo the mosque<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ahmed-lbn..Tulim </span>is the most ancient in Cairo<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It is<br/>
constructed on an ancient fortified hill named the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bg </span>Ram's<br/>
Castle" (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kela'at-el-Kabsh</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>because here, according to<br/>
tradition<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Abraham sacrificed the ram in place of Isaac.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is said that the plan of this mosque was made by a<br/>
Christian prisoner who was set at liberty on condition<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-17</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">...<br/>
