The total length of the two weir-bridges, that dam
the two arms of the Nile, is about 260 yards. 126 iron
doors regulate the volume of water passing. At the two
extremities of the Weir-bridges are the openings for the
passage of boats.

At the ends and in the middle of every bridge are
gateways in the style of Norman castles, that give to the









General View of the Barrage of the Nile,

Barrage a very distinctive character. An avenue of
acacias. one kilometre long, unite the two weirs in
crossing the angle of the Delta.

Railway trollies pushed by Arabs are, for a small fee.
at the disposal of visitors.

Messrs. Thos. Cook & Son have weekly excursions by
Steam Launch, which provide a very agreeable day's
pleasure.
