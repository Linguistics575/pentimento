Europeans. The native population is principally composed of Fellahs, Copts, Turks, and Jews, to which
must be added Negroes, Bedouins, and people from
neighbouring countries.

The history of Cairo begins with the Arabs,

Amr-Ibn-el-As, having invaded Egypt in A.D. 638,
founded on the spot of the ancient fortress Babylon the
town of Fostiit, named thus for his having pitched there
his tent, called in Arabic, ik fostiit."

Ahmed-Ibn-Non and Khamariyeh contributed very

' much to the enlargement of the city, the former by constructing the mosque that bears his name and the latter
by building a grand palace.

In A.D. 869 the Khalif Muizz, having conquered
Egypt, founded near frost-it a new capital that he named
Masr-ekKahira. Fostiit, which was also called Masr,
then took the name of Masr-el=Ateeka (Old Cairo).
Salhheddin enclosed the town by a fortification and constructed a Citadel, and each of the following sultans
added some new monuments that contributed to make
Cairo, notwithstanding conflagrations and wars, one of
the most beautiful cities of Islam,

In 1517 Cairo was taken by Selim l., who made Egypt
a Turkish pashalic. In 1798 Bonaparte made it his
headquarters, and in 1806 Mohammed Aly made his
entrance in it.

Since the middle of the last century, Cairo has
rapidly developed, thanks to successive Khedives, who
intelligently favoured the immigration of the European
element. On the north side the fortifications have quite
disappeared, and new quarters have been founded at
Fagallah and Abbassiyeh. On the west side the new
quarters of Ismailiyeh, Tewhkiyeh, and Kasr-el-Dubarah,
with wide boulevards planted with fine trees, have
already reached the Nile and the port of Biilak.

Being the principal residence of H.H. the Khedive
Abbas Pasha Hilmi and of the Consuls General, the seat
of Government and State Administrations, Cairo does not
fail to do honour as the capital of Egypt, and life passes
