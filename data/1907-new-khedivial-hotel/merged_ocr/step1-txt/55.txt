little, to build the mosques and palaces of the capital
they had founded.

On the road which leads across the palm plantations
from Bedrashin to Sakkarah, and near the village MitRahhina, there are two gigantic Statues of Rhamses Ill.

The more recently discovered of these is in black
granite, and lies on a small mound, the face turned
upwards.

The second colossus is to be found sheltered in a
wooden hut in the interior of which are some steps that
lead to a small platform from where the statue can be
easily examined. The statue is sculptured out of hard
and very fine-grained limestone, and is wrought very
carefully. Its total length (the legs are missing) must
have been about 45-ft. The head is covered with the
royal coif, decorated with the serpent Ureus; the chin is
represented with a false beard; on the right shoulder is
the prenomen of Rhamses "Ra-userma-sotep-en-Ra,"
and on the breast his name in a cartouche held by the
gods Ptah and Sekhet; the neck is clasped by the necklace
of, Nena, and the left hand holds the emblem of power.

This statue was discovered by Sloane and Caviglia in
1820, referred to by British Museum.

From, Mit-Rahhina the road leads through palm
plantations to the Arab village of Sakkiirah. There the
desert and the Necropolis begin, an extended view of
which may be had as soon as the plateau is reached.

For a distance of 15 miles from north to south, and an
average of BOO-ft. broad, are scattered funeral monuments of every kind of the time of the Ancient, Middle,
and New Empire.

Nearly all these tombs have been opened more than
once by avaricious conquerors, and the sand has been
searched over and over again. Notwithstanding, the
modern archaeologists, who have recently explored Sakkarah, have made discoveries that have greatly astonished
the civilized world.

Visitors who only come to spend a little time in Egypt
will not have time to visit all the monuments of the
