Mosques.

To visit mosques one should be provided with tickets
issued by the Administration of the ig Wakf,, (Religious
edifices and ecclesiastical properties). These tickets
(2 P.T.) may be had from the Hotel porters.

On entering the mosques felt slippers are provided by the
guardians of the mosques, for which a fee of I or 2 nickel
piastres should be given.

There are several hundred mosques in Cairo, and the
minarets by which they are flanked give to the town
quite a peculiar character,

This great number, however, need not alarm the
tourist, as only a dozen or so are of real interest to the
passing traveller.

All the mosques are built in a uniform style that has
hardly varied during the lapse of centuries. The plan of
the mosque is almost invariably an oblong rectangle, in
the centre of which is a vast courtyard called Ck SahhntlGamii'a." In the middle of it is the fountain of
ablutions, that is often covered by a wooden roof. This
court is usually enclosed by a colonnade, which forms the
" Liwan,, or place of prayer. The sanctuary is formed
by the south-eastern part of the liwéin, directed towards
Mecca. It is often separated from the court by a Ce Mush.
rabiyeh" or trellis screen. In the sanctuary is the
richly-sculptured and decorated niche of prayer (Kiblah
or Mihrab), which is always in the direction of Mecca.
On the right of the "Kiblah" is the "Mimbar" or
preaching pulpit of marquetry which is richly carved. The
reading-desk of the Koran (Kursi), the chandeliers and
lamps of the sanctuary are often of a very high artistic
value.

The exterior of the mosques is very simple, and the high,
smooth walls are finished by a staiactite cornice
