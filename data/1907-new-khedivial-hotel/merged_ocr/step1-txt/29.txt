The Khedivial Library.
h."

The Khedivial Library, which is placed in the palace
of Darb-el-Gamameez, near the Ministry of Public lnstruetion, was formed by the Khedive Ismail Pasha in
1870, and has been greatly enriched by gifts, especially
by the donation of Mustapha Pasha's library.

The Library contains over 50,000 volumes, of which
18,000 are in European languages, 29,000 in Arabic, and
about 3,000 in different oriental languages.

The section of Egyptian Philology consists exclusively of European works concerning Egypt.

The Library is open every day from 8 sun. till 1 p.m.,
except Fridays and Moslem holidays (entrance free).
During Ramadan from 10 a.m. till 1 p.m. only.

There are special catalogues for the exposition of the
Koran MSS, and the Egyptian philological section, and a
general catalogue (in three volumes) of all the European
works.

The collection of Oriental MSS. is on the ground floor.
It contains (in the principal Hall) Koran MSS. of all sizes
and epochs, and includes many masterpieces of Arabian
caligraphy. This collection of Koran MSS. is the greatest
of its kind that exists, and its value is inestimable from
every standpoint.

In the lateral halls are exhibited Persian and Turkish
MSS., many of which are ornamented with splendid vignettes.

The offices and reading-room are also on the first
floor, and one may see there Arab students and professors copying MSS.

Those who wish to study or to get further particulars
may address Dr. Moritz, who will be most happy to give
them all the information they desire.
