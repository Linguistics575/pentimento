tombs of ancient Egyptian dignitaries, it dates from the
time of the IVth dynasty, and is therefore about 4,500
years old. The outside of this tomb is not to be seen,
and is of little interest, as the whole building is buried
in the sand. The interior is so much the more interesting
for the magnificent sculptures and paintings with which
the walls are decorated. Space does not allow us to give
a detailed description of the whole mastaba. Let us only
remember the sculptures represent Ti superintending the
various operations connected with the management of his
large agricultural estates and farmyard, together with
illustrations of his hunting and fishing expeditions. The
figure of Ti is easily recognized, being much larger than
any of his workpeople.

Around the Serapeum are also to be found the Mastabas
of Ptahotep and Saba, in the interior of which are
numerous sculptures similar to those in the tomb of Ti.
These two mastabas are hidden in the sand, and can only
be visited by a special order.

The Tomb of Méra, discovered in the autumn of 1893
by Mr. de Morgan, contains thirty-one chambers with
bas-relief. and the statue of Méra. It dates from the
Vilth dynasty (rc. 2500).

Among the other monuments of the Necropolis of
Sakkarah that one may visit, and which are near the Step
Pyramid, may be mentioned the Pyramid of Unas
(Vth dynasty, Be 2600), that was searched by Mr.
Maspéro in the year 1891 at the expense of Messrs. Thos.
Cook & Son. The walls of the funeral chambers are
covered with very interesting ritual texts. The black
basalt sarcophagus was found broken.

Three quarters of an hour south of the Step Pyramid
there is a group of Pyramids, the most remarkable of
which are those of the Kings Pepi l. (VIth dynasty, B.C.
2530), and Sokar-em-Saf (IIIrd dynasty, B.C. 2900).
The Mastaba-el-Feratin, which is always in sight, is
supposed to be the tomb of King Unas.
