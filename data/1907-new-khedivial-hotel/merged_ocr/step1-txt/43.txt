The Sphinx was for many years buried in the sand,
only the head being visible. Caviglia was the first to
completely clear it, and found between its paws and
close against its breast an open temple, with a small lion
and divers steles. One of these bears an inscription which
mentions the restoration of the Sphinx by Thothmes
IV. (1533 3.0.), and throws some light on its history.
Formerly it was considered a work of the Middle Empire,
whilst it is in reality one of the earliest works of the
Ancient Empire.

The Temple of Granite.

A little to the south-west of the Sphinx is a fine specimen
of the simple and solid architecture of the Ancient Empire;
it is a temple built of enormous granite blocks. Mariette
discovered it in 1853, and found some statues of Chefren
in it, by which we are led to suppose that he built it.
These statues are now in the Egyptian Museum.

The Tomb of Numbers.

On the western edge of the plateau, near the Arab
village, is the tomb of chii-f-Ribd1nch, a priest. and his
wife HERN-KA, both related to Chefren. On the west
wall in the interior of the mastaba is a very finely sculptured bas-relief representing the scribes of Chai-f-Ria-tinch,
numbering their master's cattle. Near the driver of each
herd is found the number of beasts under his care. Hence
the name of the mastaba.
