that they must have come from the avenue of Sphinxes
of which Strabo wrote in his description of the Serapeum.
Some time after he found at Sakkiirah a Sphinx exactly
similar to those he had already seen, and divined with
the great perspicacity which has always guided him in
his excavations, that he was on the site of the monument
that had been so vainly sought after by archaeologists,

Mariette immediately began the excavations, which
were suspended, however. for some time by order of the
Egyptian Government, and found the avenue of the
Sphinxes, two chapels, eleven statues of Greek philosophers, and the Tombs of the Apis-Bulls with thousands
of bronze votive statuettes and innumerable votive tables,
the inscriptions on which are of immense value to history,
because the chronology of Egypt has been determined by
means of them as far as the XVI Ilth dynasty. Most of
these objects are now in the Louvre Museum, Paris.

The Apises or Sacred Bulls of Memphis were buried in
underground caves over which chapels were erected. All
these chapels together, surrounded by a high wall, with
two pylons. to which the avenue of the Sphinxes led,
formed the Serapeum. Of that part of the Serapeum
which was above ground only a few vestiges remain, and
the subterranean parts, which can only be visited, are the
caves which were used as tombs from the reign of Psam,
metichus I. (13.0. 663-609) to the time of the Ptolemies.
It is a gallery about 1,200-it. long, lO-it.wide, and 18-ft. high,
on both sidesof which twenty-four sarcophagi of red or black
granite or limestone still occupy their original positions
in small caves hewn in the rock. Each of these sarcophagi measures 13x8x12-ft., and is cut out of one
block, as is also the lid, Three of them are covered by
hieroglyphics and bear the names of Amosis [ l. (XXVIth
dynasty), Cambyses, and Chabbesha. These tombs, as
well as almost all others, have been opened in ancient
time, and Mariette found precious objects only in two
of them.

About 10 minutes to the north-east from the Serapeum
is the Mastaba of Ti, one of the best preserved of the
