'It is two miles from the Virgin's tree to the Obelisk
of Heliopolis or City of the Sun, in whose temples
thousands of priests were wont to officiate.

This obelisk, which was raised by Usertesen I. (13.0.
2433), is a monolith 66-ft. high, quarried out of red

Obelisk of Heliopolis: Matar'iyem,

granite from Syene (Assuiin), and is one of the most
ancient.

The four sides bear the same inscription which, however, is legible on one side only. The inscriptions on the
other sides are partly covered by wasps' nests, and in
part obliterated.
