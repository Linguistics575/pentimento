The Bazaars.

@ 0423

In the East the shops of merchants of a particular article,
or the artisans of a particular trade are united and form a
Khan (district) named after the goods sold in them.
Formerly several of these districts formed a quarter enclosed

principal street and numerous alleys formed by the shops
ranged at the side of one another. Here are to be found
