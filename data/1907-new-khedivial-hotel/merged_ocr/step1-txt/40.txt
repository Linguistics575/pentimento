charming view is to be had from the top, which is a flat
space of about 30-it. square.

In the interior of the pyramid are three mortuary
chambers, one of which is under the level of the rock.
The entry is by sloping narrow passages, so close and low
that it is necessary to creep in passing through them,
therefore it is not advisable for persons in poor health
to enter the pyramid.











Road to the Pyramids.

In the upper mortuary chamber is the red granite
sarcophagus of Cheops, broken and without a cover, and
in a chamber above the name of Cheops is found painted
in red on the blocks.

According to Herodotus, the pyramid took 20 years to
build, and 100,000 men worked at it at a time.
