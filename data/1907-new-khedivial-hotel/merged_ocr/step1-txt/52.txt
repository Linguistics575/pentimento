Half way between the Red Mountain and the Small
Petrified Forest is a wild and picturesque valley that is
ended by a high and steep semi-circular rock. Here is to
be found the Spring of Moses (Ain Nh" sssa). It is a deep
crevice containing brackish water, where the quarrymen
and the Bedouins with their herds go to quench their
thirst. It is self-evident that the Biblical Moses had
nothing to do with this spring, which must have been
named after some Arab sh√©kh.

If the excursion to the Petrified Forest is made during
the first fortnight in March, that is to say after the rains,
one will be surprised at the abundance of the flora of the
desert which will then be in full bloom.

Two hours and a half east of the Small Forest, near
Bir-el-Fakhm (coal pit), is the Great Petrified Forest;
some of the trunks found there are about lOO-ft. long and
3-ft. in diameter. A whole day is required for the latter
excursion, and it is not recommended except to those who
make a special study of geology.

The Barrage.

The Barrage of the Nile, which visitors should not
fail to see, lies about 50 minutes by rail to the north-east
of Cairo. It was planned by the French engineer, Mougel
Bey, and begun in 1835, during the reign of Mohammed
Aly.

Notwithstanding the great sums expended on its
construction, it worked with little regularity until
Est.500.000 was sunk in alterations and repairs by the
English engineer, Sir C. S. Moncrieff.
