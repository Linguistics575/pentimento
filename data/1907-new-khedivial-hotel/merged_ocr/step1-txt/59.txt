The Pyramids of Dttshtir.
w

The Pyramids of Dash (ir, at the extreme south of the
vast Necropolis of Memphis and about three miles from
the Mastaba-el-Ferrin, has just acquired an extraordinary notoriety by the discovery by Mr. de Morgan,
in March, 1894, of a double treasure which belonged to
three Egyptian princesses who were related to Egyptian
kings of the XIIth dynasty (3.0. 2300).

These treasures consist of jewellery in solid gold and
precious stones, which, whether we consider their intrinsic value or beauty of design and execution, far
surpass previous discoveries.

Of the six Dashtir Pyramids, four of brick and two of
stone, the most remarkable is the Blunted Pyramid, so
called because the lower part is inclined at a different
angle to the upper part.
