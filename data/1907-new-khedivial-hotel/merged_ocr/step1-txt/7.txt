New
Khedivial Hotel.


[ THIN a few yards from Cook's Office, on the way
to the Railway Station, stands the magnificent
structure of the New Khedivial Hotel.

This popular family Hotel is situated in the centre
of the City, in close proximity to the Opera House, the
various Theatres, Banks, Post Office, and the principal
agencies. It was built in 1904 under the superintendence of competent engineers, and is therefore a perfect
modern building, combining every modern appliance.
The sanitary arrangements have been specially considered.
The staircase, corridors, and balconies are of white
marble, and the building in general is fire-proof throughout.

It is splendidly located on the main avenue, from
whence H.H. the Khedive can be seen twice a day driving
by: whilst the ever-changing scenes of the various
events and the native life can be witnessed at the same
time.

Owing to the situation of the Hotel most of the rooms
receive throughout the day the charming rays of the
sun, an advantage to be prized by all flying from the
rigorous northern winter in search of health and comfort
in Egypt.

Being open to the four winds the Hotel possesses a
great circulation of air, thus rendering the stay pleasant
even in the summer months.

Every Bed Room is lofty, airy, and richly furnished,
and the Hotel is lit throughout by electricity.

An Electric Lift is on the premises for the convenience
of guests.
