The Ruins of Memphis and the
Necropolis of Sttkkiirtth.

A whole day is required to visit Sakkirah. The train
for Upper Egypt, leaving Cairo at 8 a.m., passes Bed-
rashin, where donkeys are in readiness to go to Sakkiirah.
The return journey may be made by train leaving Bed-
rashin at 6 p.m. or by crossing the Nile by boat and thence
by donkeys to Helwsin, from whence trains start every
hour for Cairo.

Messrs. Cook & Son have very agreeable weekly ex-

Hotel porters, or from the railway station-master at
Bedrashin. Price for donkeys, P. T. 10 and a fee to the
donkey boy.

Provisions (eatables and drinkables, candles and
magnesium wire to visit the monuments) to be taken
from Cairo.

one stands on the site of such a great city.

The disappearance of Memphis has, however, nothing
enigmatic about it. The houses, being built of sundried
bricks, were doomed to disappear as soon as they were
abandoned. With regard to the temples and palaces.
solidly built to defy time and weather, they were
sacked and destroyed by the successive conquerors of
Egypt. Above all, the Arabs were the worst sinners in
this respect, by using the ruins of Memphis, little by
