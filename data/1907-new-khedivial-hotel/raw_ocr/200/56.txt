Necropolis of Sakk2rah. Besides, many of them have
been covered up again to prevent them being ruined,
and can only be seen by means of a special and rather
expensive order because of the excavations they entail.

in the following lines the traveller will find a descrip-
tion of the most important monuments which may be
visited in one or at most two days.

By crossing many tombs buried in the sand, and
leaving several small Pyramids of little importance on
the right hand, the Step Pyramid is reached. This
Pyramid, visible from a great distance in every direction,
is generally attributed to King Teta of the Ist dynasty
(3.0. 4366), it is therefore the most ancient monument
known in the world.

The Pyramid is built in 6 steps, 38, 36, 341, 32, and
31-ft. high respectively, 6--7-ft. deep, its rectangular base
being 352x396-ft.; the entire height is 197-ft. It is
different to all other Pyramids in not being exactly built
as regards orientation.

In the interior there are a great number of chambers
and a labyrinth of passages. The Prussian general,
Minutoli, entered in 1821 and found many very in-
teresting objects that were, however, lost in transit to
Europe by shipwreck. It was subsequently explored by
Howard, Lepsius, Vyse, and Mariette.

Its ascension is rather difhcult, and the view from the
top is not so fine as from the Great Ghizeh Pyramid.

Leaving the Step Pyramid we next go to Mariette's
House. Under the large verandah, which is provided
with tables and benches, one may rest and breakfast;
it was in this house, built by himself, that the immortal
French scientist, to whose genius science owes the dis.
covery of numerous Egyptian monuments. lived for
months, superintending the excavations which at last
resulted on the 12th November, 1851, in the discovery
of the Serapeum, the most important monument of
Sakkarah.

Having seen at Cairo and Alexandria Sphinxes bearing
the name of Osiris-Apis or Serapis, Mariette concluded
