The Arab Museum.
-

The Arab Museum was installed up to this day in a
part of the Gama'a-el-Hakem, and is just being trans-
ferred in a splendid new building, in the Arabic style,
erected especially for this collection and the "Khedivial
Library'' on the kt Bairlkhalk" Square, midway of
the Mohammed Aly Street.

The Museum, under the direction of Herz Bey, con-
tains a very rich collection of objects of the Arab epoch
that are of an artistic or archaeological interest, and have
chiefly been taken from ruined mosques and secular
buildings.

The Museum is open every day from 10 a.m. till 4 Frm,
except Fridays, During the month of Ramadan (Moham-
medan fast) it is open only in The afternoon. Tickets
to visit this museum are the same as for the mosques
(RT. 2).

Among the most beautiful objects in the Museum we
may point out: A collection of splendid enamelled glass
lamps, the richest that exist; a magnificent agate
bowl, H-ft. in diameter and 4-in. thick, beautifully faceted;
a small Koran chest, and a lovely candlestick in
silver niello work. Besides this there are interesting
bronze and copper objects, sculptured marbles and
stones, incrusted mosaic works in wood and ivory,
ceramics (chiefly fragments), textiles, and lastly, many
tombstones from the first century of Islamism.
