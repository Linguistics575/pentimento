The ancient Greeks and Romans considered the pyra-
mids as one of the seven wonders of the world, and all
the Greek authors who have visited Egypt have not
failed to speak of them with admiration. Herodotus, who
visited Egypt B.C. 470-460, gives a very exact des.
scription of the monuments.

According to Arab authors they were built by King
Sarid 300 years before the Deluge.

There are many theories concerning the manner in
which they were constructed, but the most plausible is
that of Dr. Lepsius, who solves the different problems on
this subject in a very satisfactory manner.

'' Before the actual building of a pyramid was begun
a suitable rocky site was chosen and cleared, a mass of
rock, it possible, being left in the middle of the area to
form the core of the building. The chambers and the
galleries leading to them were next planned and excavated.
Around the core a truncated pyramid building was made,
the angles of which were filled up with blocks of stone.
Layer after layer of stone was then built around the
work, which grew larger and larger until it was finished.
When a king ascended the throne, he built for himself a
small but complete tomb-pyramid, and afresh coating of
stone was built around it every year that he reigned ; and
when he died the sides of the pyramids were like long
fiights of steps, which his successor filled up with right
angled triangular blocks of stone. The door of the
pyramid was walled after the body of its builder had been
laid in it, and thus remained a finished tomb. Near the
core of the pyramid the work is more carefully executed
than near the exterior; that is to say, as the time fur the
king's death approached, the work was more hurriedly
performed."

Dr. Lepsius' theory also explains in a very natural
way the difference in size of the pyramids of different
kings.

The writings of Arabic authors and travellers of the
seventeenth century bear witness to the fact of the pyramids
having been faced with a smooth covering bearing in,
scriptions.
