Campbell's Tomb.

This tomb, named after Campbell, H.B.M. Consul in
Egypt at the epoch of its discovery, is situated about 200
paces to the west of the Sphinx. It is a shaft 55-ft. deep,
at the bottom of which is a very large mortuary chamber.
In the year 1837 Voss discovered it, and found four
sarcophagi which had been already violated.

The pyramids of Ghizeh are surrounded by tombs of
priests and high dignitaries, of little interest to the
tourist. Near both the great and third pyramids is a
group of three small pyramids, having served as tombs
for the relatives of the builders of the pyramids.

Near the north-west angle of the great pyramid is the
Khedivial Kiosk, in which is installed a photographer,
whose speciality is to photograph visitors on camel-back,
or-on the steps of the great pyramid.

The monuments of Ghizeh are confided to the care of
Bedouins of extraordinary cupidity. The simplest
manner of getting rid of them is to provide oneself a
guide to all the monuments. Besides the tip given to
this Cicerone, visitors have to pay the fees as noted in the
notice on the following page,

The antiquities the Bedouins offer for sale are of little
value, and are often only imitations. Therefore, it will
be well to make a considerable reduction on their prices.

Should visitors be photographed at the Pyramids they
will do well to pay for them only on delivery.
