Deir-el-Bahary (Seti L, his son Rhamses ll.), and lastly,
the wonderful treasures found by Mr. de Morgan at
Dashdr.

A general catalogue of the antiquities has been pub-
lished, and it will be well for those wishing to make a
minute inspection of the objects to buy it.

The Museum is open every day from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
except Friday; entrance PT, 5.

During the summer months the entrance is 1 piastre,
except Monday, and is open from 9 a.m. to noon only.

The Museum possesses duplicate articles in great
quantity for sale, at comparatively moderate prices, the
authenticity of which are guaranteed.

Those, therefore, who wish to take away reliable an-
tiquities as souvenirs cannot do better than buy them
at the Museum.
