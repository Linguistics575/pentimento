the walls are made of alabaster from the quarries of
Beni-Suéf. hence the name Alabaster Mosque by which
it is known.

In the richly-decorated interior at the south-west
angle, is the tomb of Mohammed Aly (1849) surrounded
by a beautiful railing.

The effect produced at a distance by the dome and two
minarets that dominate the town is very picturesque, and
the Gama'a Mohammed Aly may he considered as the
most distinctive feature of Cairo.

Besides the barracks occupied by the British troops,
the stores, etc.. there are within the enceinte of the
Citadel several other mosques, one of which, the
Gama'a-urn-Kaiao, dates from A.D. 1317.

South of the Gama'a Mohammed Aly is Joseph's
Well, so named, not after the Biblical Joseph whom
the dragomen say was imprisoned in it, but after
Salaheddin's first name, that was Yiissuf or Joseph.
The well was sunk by the ancient Egyptians and cleared
during the construction of the Citadel, which it still
continues to supply with water.

It is about 290-ft. deep, the sakiyieh (machine for
raising the water) being half-way down.

In the narrow way by which one ascends to the Citadel
from the side of the town, the massacre of the Mamelukes,
ordered by Mohammed Aly, took place A.D. 1811. The
only Mameluke who succeeded in escaping jumped his
horse over the battlements.
