The western liwiin was enlarged by the pious Abder.
Rahmiin Kikhya, and its roof is supported by 380 pillars
of various stones and shapes. This liwin, which as well
as the two others serves as class room, is divided by
partitions into compartments, in each of which only the
students from one province or country meet to study.
The mosque has six gates, the entrance being at the
principal one, the " Barbers' Gate."

The el-Azhar mosque is considered to be the most
important lslamitic university. A few years ago the
number of students rose to 8,000, studying under more
than 200 professors.

When visiting this mosque it will be well not to speak
loudly, and above all not to laugh, so as neither to trouble
the students nor excite their susceptibility.

Quite near the mosque el-Azhar is to be seen the
Okéla Kait Bey, a secular building of great interest.

The Gama'a el-Muaiyad, erected in A.D. 1416, by
the Circassian Sultan Shékh Mahmud el-Muaiyad, is often
called the " Red Mosque" because of the colour of the
outside walls. The chief bronze door comes from the
mosque of Sultén Hasan. The court is planted with trees
and surrounded by arcades, the columns of which were
taken from buildings of other epochs. The liwin is
richly and tastefully ornamented, and the mosaics and
mimbar in it are also very fine. It contains the tombs of
the builder and his family. The two majestic minarets
over the gate Béb-el-Zewéla, were repaired some years
ago.

The Gama’a Kait Bey, A.D. 1468-1496, situated near
the Tuh"sn mosque, is considered as the most elegant
specimen of Arab architecture in Cairo. Inside there are
some tine mosaics, and the mimbar is richly carved. Of
the handsome bronze carving of the gate only a few
fragments remain.

The Gama'a eI-(ihuri, erected in the middle of the
sixteenth century, is one of the best preserved of the
ancient mosques, and is inside and outside one of the
handsomest in Cairo. Formerly, one of the prophet
