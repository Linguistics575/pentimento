surmounted by merlons, above which one only sees the
minarets and domes. The doorways are generally richly
decorated and sculptured. The doors themselves are
studded with very artistic fretted and engraved bronze
plates. The divided windows are often surmounted by
smaller ones, round or in the form of a heart. They
are of pierced plaster and ornamented with coloured
glass.

The minarets, absent in the most ancient mosques,
present a great variety of design. At about two-thirds
of the height is a kind of gallery or balcony from which

arets as well as the domes are capped by great copper
crescents and are brilliantly illuminated at night during
the fast of Ramadan, presenting a most picturesque
aspect from the roof of any high house.

Almost every mosque possesses a public fountain
named "Sebil." [t is a large hall separated from the
street by a bronze railing through which water is offered
to passers by. There is generally a primary school above
the sebil, from which resounds the hurly-burly of the
children reciting verses from the Koran. The sebils are
very often isolated buildings, and many of them are
splendid specimens of architecture.

Besides the mosques, numerous small chapels named
" Zawiyeh," and many tombs of shékhs, generally of very
little interest. are scattered about the Arab quarters of
the town.

Among the pious and religious monuments must also
be mentioned the Cloisters of dervishes (Tekiyeh), the
drinking fountains for animals (Had), and the asylums
and hospitals.

Excepting the mosque of Amru at Old Cairo the mosque
of Ahmed-lbn..Tulim is the most ancient in Cairo, It is
constructed on an ancient fortified hill named the FS Ram's
Castle'' (Kela‘at-el-Kabsh). because here, according to
tradition. Abraham sacrificed the ram in place of Isaac.

Christian prisoner who was set at liberty on condition
