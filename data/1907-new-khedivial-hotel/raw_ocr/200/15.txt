Visit to Places of Interest.
-

The visit to the numerous places of interest mentioned
in this guide may be made in about 8 or 9 days, by means
of donkey or cab ; in some cases the tram cars are also
available.

Persons having but 2 or 3 days at their disposition
must content themselves with a walk in the Arab quarters
and bazaars, a visit to the Mosque of Sultan Hasan and
the Citadel, an excursion to the Pyramids of Ghizeh, and
a visit to the Museum of Egyptian antiquities.

Although it is possible to be understood almost
anywhere in the town, as natives knowing English are
becoming more and more numerous. it will be well (above
all if one has little time) to be accompanied by one of the
numerous Cairo dragomen.

The duration of the visit to each monument cannot
be exactly indicated. The following may, however, be
taken as approximate:--

General walk through the town .. .. .. Half-day.

The Citadel and the Mosques of Sultan Hasén,
Ibn- Tulun and Kait Bey ..

The Muristan Kaiaun, the Barkukiyeh, the
Mosque of Hakem, Bab. en- Nasr and the
Tombs of the Khalifs

The Mosques of el- Muayad. el- Ghuri el Azhar,
el- Hasanein, the dancing Dervishes

The Bazaars, the Arab Museum and Library..

The Egyptian Museum (worthy to be visited
several times if time permit)

The Pyramids of Ghizeh ..

On Friday or Sunday, promenade to Ghez1reh,
about 2 or 3 hours.
