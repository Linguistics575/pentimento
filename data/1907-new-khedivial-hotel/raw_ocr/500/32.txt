The Ezbekiyeh Garden.

This garden, named after the Amir Ezbeki, the Sultan
Kait Bey's famous general, is situated in the centre of
the town. It is of octagonal form, about 20 acres in
extent, and was arranged and planted under the super-
intendence of Barillet, the celebrated Parisian gardener.
A great number of rare tropical trees and plants are
contained in it.

There are several cafes, a very picturesque grotto with
a belvedere,' a small theatre, a lake with swans, a restau-
rant, a fencing hall, and bandstand, where a military
band plays every afternoon from 5---8 p.m., entrance one
small nickel piastre.

The Egyptian Museum.

Near the Kasr-en-Nil Barracks rises an imposing new
building, erected at an expense of more than £220,000,
and which was inaugurated some time ago by H.H. the
Khedive: it is the new Egyptian Museum.

The collection of Egyptian antiquities was begun in
1854, in the reign of Said Pasha, by the famous Frenchman
I. A, Mariette, whose remains are now enclosed in a
marble sarcophagus placed before the principal entrance
to the Museum.

The collection was at first installed in an old Post
Office at Bulak, but it increased so rapidly under the
able and energetic direction of Mariette (1881) and
under that of his successors, Maspéro and Grébaut, that
the Egyptian Government finally decided to assign it
another building.
