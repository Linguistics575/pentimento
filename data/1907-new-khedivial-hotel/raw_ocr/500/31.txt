folks and the harem-lady, also the noisy Arab coster-
mongers crying out and praising aloud the quality of
their goods. In short, it is there that one forms the most
exact and concise idea of that oriental life, so poetic and
picturesque, which tends little by little to disappear
before the encroachment of European civilization.

Visitors should not fail also to inspect the establish-
ment of Joseph Cohen inside of Han-Halil, as his stock
of oriental articles is of the very choicest quality.

For Artistic Brass Work, Oriental Carpets, Mushrabich
Work, and Turquoises, etc., etc., a visit to Messrs. E. M.
Malluk & Co., Mooskee Street, is recommended; the
Musharabieh work, done by the natives mostly with
their feet, is very interesting.
