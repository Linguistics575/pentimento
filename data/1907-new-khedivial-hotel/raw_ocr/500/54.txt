The Ruins of Memphis and the
Necropolis of Sukiiiriih.

A whole day is required to visit Sakkiirah. The train
for Upper Egypt, leaving Cairo at 8 a.rn., passes Bed-
rashtn, where donkeys are in readiness to go to Sakkiirah.
The return journey may be made by train leaving Bed-
rashin at 6 p.m. or by crossing the Nile by boat and thence
by donkeys to Helwiin, from whence trains start every
hour for Cairo.

Messrs. Cook & Son have very agreeable weekly ex-

donkey boy.

Provisions (eatables and drinkables, candles and
magnesium wire to visit the monuments) to be taken
from Cairo.

vast Necropolis of Sakkitrah, it is difficult to believe that
one stands on the site of such a great city.

The disappearance of Memphis has, however, nothing
enigmatic about it. The houses, being built of sundried
bricks, were doomed to disappear as soon as they were
