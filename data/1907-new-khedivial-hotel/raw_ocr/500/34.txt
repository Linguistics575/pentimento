Deir-el-Bahary (Seti 1., his son Rhamses ll.), and lastly,
the wonderful treasures found by Mr. de Morgan at
Dashiir. _

A general catalogue of the antiquities has been pub-
lished, and it will be well for those wishing to make a
minute inspection of the objects to buy it.

The Museum is open every day from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
except Friday; entrance RT. 5.

During the summer months the entrance is 1 piastre,
except Monday, and is open from 9 a.m. to noon only.

The Museum possesses duplicate articles in great

authenticity of which are guaranteed.

tiquities as souvenirs cannot do better than buy them
at the Museum.
