According to Arab authors, there were numerous
vestiges existing in the City of the Sun about the end of
the twelfth century. They have, however, quite disap-

after the ruined mosque on its summit, lies east of the
town.

It is formed of limestone containing numberless masses
of petrified nummulites from the size of a lentil seed to
that of a shilling, as well as many other very interesting
petrifications, such as sea-urchins, oysters, nautili.
sharks' teeth, etc., and sundry crystals.

The rock furnishes building material that has been
much prized during many ages. The Ghizeh pyramids
were erected of blocks from this mountain, whose sides
are pierced by a number of very interesting quarries and
caves) which are well worth a visit.

The best way is to quit the citadel by the Bab-el-Gebcl,
or mountain gate, passing by a bridge over a deep railway
cutting, thus getting to the top of the mountain in about
