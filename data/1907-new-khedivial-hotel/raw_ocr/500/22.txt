Mohammed's shirts, brought from Mecca by the founder
of the mosque, was kept there. Opposite the mosque is
the sebil with medréseh (school), built by the same
sultan.

The Mttristt'in Kalatyn, founded by the Sultan el
Mansur Kalaton, A.D. 1285, was a magnificent hospital,
the greater part of which is now in ruins and occupied by
coppersmiths' workshops. The part containing the
mausoleum is the only one in good condition. The red
porphyry columns that formerly supported the dome are
very interesting. The doorway of the mosque is built of
alternate layers of white and black marble. The fine
dadoes that ornamented the lower part of the walls in the
interior have been reddened by the exudations ofsalt-
petre.

The Muristan (Persian word for hospital) contained a
ward for each kind of disease, and there were also school-
rooms, and an orphan asylum.

The tomb mosque of MohammedaerrNasrubn=Kalatin
adjoins the Muristiin, and was erected and built by him,
A.D. 1300. The marble doorway brought from Akka
(Palestine),is of little interest.

Third in order after the above two buildings comes the
Barkukiyeh, or C''. Medriiseh" of Sultan Barkt1k, con-
taining the mausoleum of his daughter. This edifice was
restored some years ago. It has a handsome marble door-
way and door with very artistic bronze fittings and
ornaments.

At the end of the street, opposite the above three
buildings, is the 't Beit el Kadi '' (House of the Kadi), a
beautiful specimen of Arab architecture, worthy of a
passing inspection.

The Gama'a Au=Bekr=Mazhar, vizir of Kait Bey,
was built in A.D. 1480, and contains some very fine
incrusted marbles andmosaic.

The Gama'a eLHakem was erected A.D. 1003 by
the third Fiitimite Khalif, on the plan of the Tuliin
mosque, of which, however, it is only a badly-executed

copy.
