As the taxes were formerly regulated according to the
rising of the Nile, it was very important, both for the
people and its governors, to know the height of the
water; this was communicated by a Shékh, whose
office it was to guard the Miky'iis.

As soon as the water reaches a certain height. the
ceremony of the cutting of the Khalig takes place either
in the first or second week of August.

On the north side of the island there is a tree named
Mandttra, to which the people attribute supernatural
healing power, and upon the branches of which are
hanging thousands of rags, the cast-off bandages of those
who have been there to get cured.

Meoriyeh, Heliopolis, and the
Ostrich Farm.

The village of Matariyeh, about 5 miles from Cairo,
is built on the site of ancient tde1iopolis, and can be
reached by rail in half an hour, or by road through
Abbassiyeh where the barracks, exercise fields, butts,
and observatory are, Half way by rail one finds the
Palace of Kubbeh, the usual residence of H.H. the
Khedive Abbas Hilmi.

About half a mile from the railway station is the
Virgin's Tree, under which (according to tradition) the
Holy Virgin rested after her flight to Egypt. It is a
sycamore tree of large size, and was planted in the seven-
teenth century in the place of one that preceded it.

The spring of water near the tree is sweet and cool.
whilst the wells in the neighbourhood have brackish
water. At this same spot the balsam tree grew until the
sixteenth Century ", the last specimen died in 1615.
