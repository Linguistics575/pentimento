The Bazaars.

@ 0423

In the East the shops of merchants of a particular article,
or the artisans of a particular trade are united and form a
Khan (district) named after the goods sold in them.
Formerly several of these districts formed a quarter enclosed

principal street and numerous alleys formed by the shops
ranged at the side of one another. Here are to be found
silk stuffs. jewellery, brass articles. and Persian carpets.
