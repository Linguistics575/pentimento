Khalig, the canal which flows from one end of Cairo to
the other, and after a few minutes Old Cairo (Masr-el-
Ateeka) is reached.

Scarcely 90 yards from the canal stands a three-storied,
hexagonal stone tower; this tower is the head-main of
the aqueduct built by Saliiheddin to supply the Citadel
with water. This aqueduct, about three and a half
miles long, is constructed on Gothic arches, and is stayed
by heavy buttresses. Several parts of it had to be removed
to make way for the railway, only some fragments being
now left.

In the Coptic quarter, which is built on the ruins of
IL Fostat," one may still recognise the walls of a Roman
castle built on the site of the Persian fortress Babylon.
Here also is the famous Coptic Church, Abu Sargah
(Saint Sergius), which may be considered as the type of
the ancient Egyptian Churches. According to tradition,
the crypt under the church served as refuge to the Holy
Virgin after her fiight to Egypt. This crypt dates from
the Arab conquest, whilst the church itself is of more
recent date. Some of the carvings in wood and ivory
representing the birth of our Redeemer, the Last Supper,
and several saints, are very interesting, and as ancient
as the church.

There are still several other Coptio and Greek Orthodox
Churches in the Coptic quarter, as well as two synagogues
that are interesting only to the learned.

North of the Coptic quarter one finds the mosque of
Amru, (Gamii'a Amr-ibn-el-As). The original mosque,
built by the Khalif Omar's general, has disappeared: it
has been destroyed and reconstructed several times.
Some parts of the present mosque date from the fifteenth
century. Formerly the columns of the interior arcades
numbered 366; they were taken from Roman and
Byzantine buildings, and have a great variety of capitals.
By a strange hazard the white veins of one of the grey
marble columns form the names Allah, Mohammed, and
Sui√©man in Arabic characters. In 1808 a curious spectacle
was presented at the mosque of Amru of an assembly of
