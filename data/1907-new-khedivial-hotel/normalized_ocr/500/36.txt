The Pyramids.

(See copy of regulations on page 43)

On the western bank of the Nile, at the edge of the
Libyan desert, the Pyramids of Abu Roiish, Ghizeh,
Ziiwyet-el-Aryiin, Abusir. Sakksirah, and Dahshlir are
ranged for a distance of twenty-five miles.

Pyramids are always grouped, and are only to be
found in the centre of a necropolis. This fact constitutes
the best answer to all the theories contending the pyra-
mids were constructed for other purposes than the tombs
erected by Egyptian kings who reigned before the invasion
of the Hyksos (1780 B.c.).

The tombs of the high officials, commonly called
mastiibas, as well as other funeral monuments, are to be
found spread around the pyramids.
