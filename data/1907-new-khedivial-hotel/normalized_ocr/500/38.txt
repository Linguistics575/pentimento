Some of this smooth covering still remains near the
summit of the Second Pyramid.

A very interesting fact in connection with their position
is that the cardinal points are always exactly determined
and that the entrance is always on the north side.

In the fifth and fourth centuries 13.0. the Persian con-
querors broke open the Ghizeh pyramids and carried
away the treasures which no doubt they contained.

The Romans and the Khalif Miimfin also entered them
and found that others had preceded them.

It is easy to understand how the builders of the mosques
were tempted to regard the pyramids as-mere quarries;
in fact, a great many of the sacred and secular Arab
buildings in Cairo were erected with blocks from that
source. Melik-el-Kamil attempted to destroy the small
(third) pyramid of Ghizeh about the end of the twelfth
century, but after months of vain efforts had to abandon
it, having only succeeded in removing the facing of one
side.



The Necropolis of Ghizeh.

Half a day, at least, is necessary to visit the Ghizeh
group of pyramids. They are the nearest to Cairo, and
forty minutes by Electric tram starting from Kasr-el-Nil,
or one-and-a-half hour distant by carriage or Mena House
coach.

The road there, planted with beautiful acacia trees,
follows the Nile, passes the Ghizeh Museum, and, turning
abruptly to the right just as the village of Ghizeh is
reached, continues afterwards 5 miles in a straight line
to the edge of the desert.

On both sides of this raised road, extending as far as
the eye can reach, are level fields that are transformed
