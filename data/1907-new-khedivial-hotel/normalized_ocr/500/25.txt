The most beautiful of these tomb mosques is certainly
that of Kalt Bey (A.D. 1468-1496). The high dome is
richly decorated and the minarets are extremely elegant.

The mosque of Sultan Barktik, with two very im-
posing and elegant domes, has had to be propped on all
sides to prevent it from falling.

In the mosque of Bursbey (A.D. 1422-1438), there are
some fine mosaics and some pierced-plaster windows.

Among a great number of other tombs, note those of
Kansuweh eGGhtirl (A.D. 1501-16), Yussuf el-
Ashraf, the tomb of the Seven Women (Saba'ii Banat)
that of the Mother of eI-Ashraf (Um-el-Ashraf) and
Okella Kait-Bey completely in ruins.

To return to Cairo, take the road between the tombs
of Sitt-khawiinda and Siiilemttn Agha el-Wali,
leaving the hill of the windmills to the right and taking
Sikket-Gedide and the Mooskee.

The view to be obtained from the hill of the wind-
mills over the tombs of the Khalifs will, especiallyduring
sunset, be one of the most agreeable souvenirs one can
take away from Cairo.

The Tombs of the Mamelukes.

The Tombs of the Mamelukes are situated to the
south of the Citadel and are in a complete state of ruin,
although the few minarets and domes that are still
standing bear witness to the ancient beauty of those
buildings.

As there are no inscriptions except verses from the
Koran, even the names of the personages buried there
are unknown.

Around these ruins the Arab cemeteries extend in
every direction.
