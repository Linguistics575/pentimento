The Gama'a Sayede-Zei'nab, begun at the end of the
last century, contains the mausoleum of the Prophet's
grand-daughter, Zeinab, after whom it was named. It
has been quite recently restored.

The Gama'a eI-Hasanein, the mosque of Hasan and
Hussein, the sons of Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet, is of
recent construction and of no architectural interest. It
contains the tomb enclosing the head of Husein, killed at
the battle of Kerbela, A.D. 680.
