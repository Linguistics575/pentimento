Monuments and Curiosities

of

Cairo.

Churches.

The only churches in Cairo of any historical interest
are the Coptic churches, having been founded in the
first centuries of the Christian era. For all those who
do not make churches a special study, a passing visit to
Abu Sargah (St. Sergius) in Old Cairo will suffice, as it
is the most interesting Coptic church, and may be con-
sidered as a prototype.

The churches of other sects are of more or less recent
date, and it is only the form of service which may be
interesting.

At Khamzéni is the Patriarchate of the orthodox
Greeks, and the Church of St. Nicolas, which was re-
stored a few years ago and contains some fine paintings.
The patriarchal library is very rich, and contains many
precious MSS. of the history of the Christian church
in Egypt.
