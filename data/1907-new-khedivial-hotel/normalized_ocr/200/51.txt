ten minutes. On the left is an ancient Turkish fortress,
and about half a mile distant to the right are the ruins
of the mosque ELGii'1shi.

The view from the summit during sunset is wonderful',
it embraces the panorama of the town with its numerous
minarets, all the country from Tuna to Matariyeh, the
course of the Nile as far as the Barrage, the edge of the
Libyan desert, and those most majestic monuments of

The Small Petrified Forest and
the Spring of Moses.

The small petrified forest, as it is usually called, is
about two hours distant by donkey, and lies to the
south-east of Cairo.

It is a vast extent of desert over which are scattered
thousands of pieces of petrified wood, as well as many com-
plete trunks of trees, some of the latter being about 40-ft.
long. As there are neither branches nor roots to be
found, it is supposed that the pieces of wood and trunks
of trees were carried to their present position by the
water, and became petrified by the influence of the
silicate contained in the sand.

The roads which lead to it are not very easy to find,
therefore it will be well to be provided with a good guide.
One road leads along the top of the Mokattam. It is,
however, better to go by the Tombs of the Khalifs and
ascend to the plateau between the Red Mountain (Gebel
Akhmar), which one leaves to the left, and the Mokattam,
the eastern slopes of which one continues to follow.
