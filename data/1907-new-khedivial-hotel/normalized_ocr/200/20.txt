that he erected it after the model of the Kti'aba at Mecca.
One of the series of arcades of the sanctuary, at the side
of the court, fell in 1875.

The Kibla with golden mosaics, byzantine capitals and
marble ornaments, is very remarkable. The mimbar was
a masterpiece of carving and marquetry, of which only
vestiges remain.

The spiral staircase of the minaret is placed around
the outside, instead of being inside as in other
mosques.

The Gama'a Sultan Hasan was erected by one of the
younger sons of Sultan Noisir, A.D. 1356-58, and is
certainly the most imposing mosque in Cairo. It is often
called the "Magnificent," a name that it well sustains.
Its beautiful doorway, 67-ft. high, has served as a model
for a great many Egyptian and Persian mosques. The
southern minaret is the highest in Cairo, being 290-ft.
The northern minaret was destroyed by an earthquake,
and has only been partially replaced. The court is not
surrounded by a celonnade but by four gigantic arches.
The sanctuary contains the mausoleum of Hasan, covered
by an immense dome 180.ft. high. The marble mosaics
and inscribed frieze are also very remarkable.

This splendid mosque is being restored at an expense
of Lstg. 40,000.

The Gama'a el-Rifayeh, opposite the above, was
commenced by the mother of the Khedive Ismail Pasha,
but has remained in the present unfinished state, the
present Arab architects being incapable of finishing it,
and the foundress having sworn that no infidel hand
should touch it. The mosque contains, beside the tomb
of the foundress and some princesses, the mausoleum of
Sh√©kh Rifay, enclosed by a very beautiful railing.

The (inma'a=el-Azhar, "the Flourishing," was founded
in A.D. 973, by G6har, the vizir of Sultin Mu'izz, and
converted into a university A.D. 988, by the Khalif Aziz
Billiih. The mosque had therefore to be greatly enlarged
in the course of-centuries, and as it is surrounded by these
additional buildings, it presents no monumental fagade.
