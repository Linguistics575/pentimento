The Bazaars.
$ 06

in the East the shops of merchants of a particular article,
or the artisans of a particular trade are united and form a
Khan (district) named after the goods sold in them.
Formerly several of these districts formed a quarter enclosed
by heavy gates, which were closed at night. Some of these
gates still remain in Cairo, but they are never closed.

principal street and numerous alleys formed by the shops
ranged at the side of one another. Here are to be found
silk stuffs. jewellery, brass articles, and Persian carpets.

in gold and silver filigree are sold, and SCIk-el:
Nahhasin, where the Coppersmiths offer their wares.

The bazaars are the centres of Arab business. and
