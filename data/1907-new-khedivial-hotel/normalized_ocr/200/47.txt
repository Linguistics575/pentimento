Mohammedan and Christian clergy, and the rabbis met
together to pray God to cause the Nile to rise.

On the south side of this mosque are some manufac-
tories for Kullahs (earthern water bottles), a visit to
which will not fail to be interesting.

On the eastern side of Old Cairo is the Orthodox Greek
Monastery of St. George with cemetery, as well as another
Coptic monastery.

The Cemeteries of other Christian sects are near the
beginning of the Khalig (Fum-el-Kahlig).

The Island of Réda and the
Nilometer.

South-east of the town is the island of ROda, covered
with palaces and gardens.

Take the road to Old Cairo as far as the palace of
SCslernin Pasha, turn to the right and cross, by means of
a bark, the small arm of the Nile, which separates the isle
from Old Cairo. Across gardens and covered courts one
comes at last to the estate of the late Hasan Pasha,
situated at the southern extremity of the isle; there,
quite at the end of the garden, is the Nilometer or
Miky'hs, constructed by the Omayyade' Khalif Siilemin,
A.D. 715-717, and restored by the Khalif El M2mun
(Am. 813-833). It is well built of hard stone, in the centre
of which rises an octagonal column on which is marked
the fluvial scale in ancient Arabic cubits. The Cufic
inscriptions are concerning the restoration of the well.
