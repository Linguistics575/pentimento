In 1889 the Museum was transferred from Bultsk to
the Palace of Ismail Pasha at Ghizeh (built in an immense
park at an expense of nearly one million pounds), and
was opened by H.H. the Khedive in January, 1890.

Mr. Grébaut was succeeded in the year 1892 by Mr. de
Morgan, who has reorganised and much enriched the
collection by many objects which were formerly kept in
the stores for want of space. Then Mr. de Morgan was
entrusted by the French Government with an archao-
logical Mission in Persia, and Mr. Maspéro assumed again
the superintendence of the ik Service des antiquit" s
Egyptiennes."

The Ghizeh Palace being built with light materials
there was a constant danger of confugration, and as
many monuments on the ground floor began to be
injured by the dampness, the Egyptian Government
finally decided to construct a special building to shelter
definitely that precious collection.

Thanks to the extraordinary measures taken during
the transfer, none of the objects were damaged or lost.

The collection of the Egyptian Museum surpasses all
other similar collections by its wealth in monuments of
the first six dynasties and by the fact that the places
where the greater number of antiquities were found are
well located. The Museum contains also a great
number of monuments and statues in a complete state,
and owes this ohiedy to the fact that the director or the
conservator was present at the excavation of the sites when
they were found, and personally superintended their
transport.

The collection of scarabs, formerly very rich, has for
some reason or other been considerably reduced, and
many European antiquaries and museums possess the
most beautiful.

Space will not permit us to make even a short reference
to the most important monuments. Let us only remember
the famous wooden statue of the Shélch-el-iyiled, the
stone of Tanis with the celebrated decree of Canope, the
treasure of the Queen Aiih-hotep, the royal mummies of
