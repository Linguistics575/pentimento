The Second Pyramid.

This pyramid seems at first sight to be greater than
the first, but that is simply because it is constructed on
a higher level.

lt was erected by Chti--f---liti or Chefren, the third
king of the IVth dynasty; his name, however, has not
yet been discovered on any part of the monument. There
are two entrances on the north side, one at a height of
50-ft.. which leads into two mortuary chambers, the
uppermost of which contains the granite sarcophagus of
Chefren. The present height of this pyramid is about
450-ft., base 700-ft. It is not at all advisable to attempt
the ascent of it, although the Bedouins ascend with com-
parative ease.

It was searched by Beizoni in the year 1816, Near
this pyramid are some remains of a temple intended for
the worship of the dead.

The Third Pyramid.

This pyramid. erected by Men=Kau-R:'1 or Myke=
rinus, fourth king of the IVth dynasty, is the one that has
been most damaged; this partial destruction. however,
has one advantage, as it enables us to get a good idea of
the manner in which pyramids were constructed.

The rock on which the pyramid is built being inclined,
the level surface was obtained by adding enormous stones
to the lower part. Its height is about 215-ft., width at
base 350-ft. The entrance, which is on the north side,
is about 13-ft. from the ground. We pass through a long
corridor with several granite ante-chambers and narrow
passages to the well. by which we descend into the granite-
faced mortuary chamber. Here, in 1837, Haward Vyse
found the granite sarcophagus and remains of the coffin
