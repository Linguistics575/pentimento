that they must have come from the avenue of Sphinxes
of which Strabo wrote in his description of the Serapeum.
Some time after he found at Salrk2rah a Sphinx exactly
similar to those he had already seen, and divined with
the great perspicacity which has always guided him in
his excavations. that he was on the site of the monument
that had been so vainly sought after by archaeologists.

Mariette immediately began the excavations, which
were suspended. however. for some time by order of the
Egyptian Government, and found the avenue of the
Sphinxes, two chapels, eleven statues of Greek philoso-
phers, and the Tombs of the Apis-Bulls with thousands
of bronze votive statuettes and innumerable votive tables,
the inscriptions on which are of immense value to history.
because the chronology of Egypt has been determined by
means of them as far as the XVllIth dynasty. Most of
these objects are now in the Louvre Museum. Paris.

The Apises or Sacred Bulls of Memphis were buried in
underground caves over which chapels were erected. All

on both sidesot which twenty-four sarcophagi of red or black
granite or limestone still occupy their original positions
in small caves hewn in the rock. Each of these sar-

block, as is also the lid. Three of them are covered by
hieroglyphics and bear the names of Amosis [ l. (XXVlth
dynasty), Cambyses, and Chabbesha. These tombs, as
well as almost all others, have been opened in ancient
time, and Mariette found precious objects only in two
of them.

About 10 minutes to the north-east from the Serapeum
is the Mastaha of Ti, one of the best preserved of the
