which had contained the body and bore the name of
Men-Kau-Ra. This mummy case is now in the British
Museum; with regard to the sarcophagus, it was lost off
the coast of Spain by the wreck of the vessel which was
transporting it.

There are also near this pyramid the ruins of a temple
in honour of the dead.

The Sphinx.

Of all the monuments in the Necropolis of Ghizeh,
excepting the pyramids, the Sphinx is the most famous
and interesting. It is cut out of the natural rock, and
represents a crouching lion with a human head. The
body is simply roughed out, but the head has been
sculptured with great care. The headdress, a part of the
beard, and the red colour of the face have disappeared',
the face itself, especially the nose, has been much damaged
by the conquering Arabs, above all by the Mamelukes,
who used it as a target. The body is 150Ht. long, the
paws 50-ft. The well-proportioned head is 30-ft. high
and 14-ft. broad: a person standing on the top of one
ear cannot reach the top of the head.

The Arabs call the Sphinx Abu-el=H6n (father of the
terror), and believe it has the power to protect the crops
from the encroachment of the sand.

The Sphinx was named by the ancient Egyptians
"Hu," and represents the god Harmachis "Hermem
chut" (Horus on the horizon). Thothmes [ ll. (XVlllth
dynasty), whose name we often see accompanied by the
image of the Sphinx, chose it for his patron.

The origin of the Sphinx is surrounded by mystery;
but what is certain, is that it already existed in the time
of Chu-fu and Chefren, as is proved by an inscription
found by Mariette near the pyramids, and that it was
probably restored by those two kings.
