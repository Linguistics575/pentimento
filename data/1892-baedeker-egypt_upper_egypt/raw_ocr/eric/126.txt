Both the ‘Three Weeks‘ and the ‘Four Weeks’ Tourist Steamers stop
at Bender-ah in ascending the river, the ﬁrst halting 3 hrs“, the second a
whole day. The mail-steamer also halts here for a few hours in descend-
ing the river.

For a visit to the temple the steemboats and dhahahiyehs moor at the
bank opposite garish. The distance to the temple (about 2 M.) is easily
accomplished in 1/2 hr. by the wellvequipped donkeys standing in readiness.
Those who wish to make a prolonged stay may procure the necessary
conveniences for a. night in the temple from the keeper ‘Alt Eﬁ'cndt, who
lives in Ranch. The Arabs, however. are afraid of the ”shit“ or ghosts.
The visitor should not fail to be provided with candles or (better still) a
magnesium lamp for exploring the crypts and other parts of the temple.

We follow the bank. of the Nile towards the N., through palm-
trees, and then proceed to the W. through well-tilled ﬁelds, pass-
ing (right) a farm-enclosure guarded by yelping dogs; or we may
ride at once towards the W. in the direction of the Gate of Augustus
(p. 88) and proceed thence to the N., passing a door with unﬁlled
cartouches, to the N. entrance, where the cards of admission (see
lntrod., p. air) are shown. The wall enclosing the temple is formed
of Nile bricks, and. there is another entrance on the W. side. The
total enclosure is 317 yds. long and. 306 yds. wide, and besides the
large temple of Hathor contains a small sanctuary dedicated to Isis
and. a so-vcalled ‘hirth-mhouse’ [see below). The N. door, which is in
a straight line with the temple, is only 15" to the E. of N. ; hut in
the templeminscriptions it is always spoken of as the E. entrance,
while the long sides of the temple are called the N. and 8. sides.
In the following description we follow the true geographical posi-
tion. The N. gate was built under the Emp. Domitian, who is here
named Germanicus. On the side next the temple appears the name

Dacicus.

From the N. gate a modern brick passage leads to the temple.
To the left of this passage lies a “building deepmsunken in the do»

of which, with the dwarf—like ﬁgure of the god Bess, project from
the sand. The remains include a rather large vestibule (33 ft. by
161/2 in), a long central room, two narrow sidemrooms,pome small
