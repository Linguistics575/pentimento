the 8., consists of a central portal (closed) and smaller adjoining
door. Its only sculptured ornament is the winged sun-disc above
the central door. In the interior of the temple, which has a sub-
structure of dressed masonry , are four standing columns , with
tastefully carved capitals, and farther on are various ruinous cham-
bers. To the W. are the remains of some large and solid structures.
m— At the foot of the mountains to the S. of the village, not far
from the river, are some scanty remains of enclosures and the angle
of a wall, in which perhaps are to be identiﬁed the traces of the
other and larger temple, which was still. standing in 1870. On the
hill above is a castellated building to which climbers may ascend.

Beyond Tafeh the dark shining rocks advance close to the river-

middle of which, on the E. bank, are some houses with plantations

this representation dates from a late Roman period, it shows that
Amenhotep was regarded as the founder and one of the Ptolemies
as the restorer of the temple. The cartouche also of Tutmes Ill.,
the predecessor of Amenhﬁotep 11., is found on a granite statue lying
before the entrance of the temple. The above-mentioned Ptolemy
