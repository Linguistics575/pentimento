that Moses was born here. Near the cemetery are some ancient snbm
structures, with fragments of inscriptions recording that Hermon-
this, which must have existed even under the old monarchy, was
adorned under the 18th Dyn. with ﬁne buildings for the deity of
the city. Strobe relates that Zeus and Apollo were worshipped. and
that a sacred hull was kept here. As a matter of fact the menu“
merits, besides mentioning several female deities, name Month
(Zeus) and seven forms of Home (Apollo) as the chief gods at Her-s-
monthis, while the coins of the Nomos Hermonthites bear the ﬁgure
of a bull. turned towards the right, and. preparing to ﬁght, with
lowered horns and. extended tail. The Pharaoh is described as fall-

-—-— At Rizdgdt, 41/2 M. to the S.W. of Erment, a stale of the 18th
Dyn. was found, in which this place is named Aimetim.

On the right bank, facing the curve which the Nile describes at
the village of Sendd, lies the village of Tdd, the ancient Taphinm,
with a ruinous chamber, the sole relic of a small temple of the
Ptolemies. Maspero recently discovered here a granite sacriﬁcial
table, with a dedication by Usertesen I. to the god Month. Steles
of the 12th and 13th Dyn. (new at Giaeh) were found at Salamiych,
13/4 M. to the W. of Tdd. ....... At Mealdh, on the E. bank, are frag-
ments of a sphinx with the name of Amenhotep I.

On the W. bank, 13 M. above Erment, and. opposite a large is-
land, rise two rocky heights, known as Gehelén, he. the ‘twe moan-
tains’, on one of which is the tomb of a Stitch March, probably

monthis (Erment) and Latopolis (Esneh). Extensive excavations
carried on at this spot by Maspero yielded sarcophagi of the 12th
Dyn. and also numerous domestic articles, etc., appropriate to per-
sons of comparative poverty.

0n the W. bank, 2131/2 M. farther up, lies Bench, the ancient
Latopolis, a town of 9000 inhab., where the tourists-steamers halt
for 3 hrs, while the maﬁa-steamer on the downward voyage steps
all night. The profane name of this place under the Pharaohs was

Esneh. Esneh has large grain and. cattle markets, at which prices
are lower than at Assnan. The town, in which there are numerous
coffeeuhouses and. ghawizi, is somewhat notorious for the dissolute
disposition of the otherwise industrious inhabitants, many of whom
are employed in woolmweaving. The Bazaar, at the entrance to
which is a kind of Market-Place, is tolerably well furnished. The
streets are well built and some of the shops are European in chau-
