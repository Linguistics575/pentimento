distingished for the beautiful modelling of the kings horses dash-
ing into the ﬁght, and for the representation of the Asiatic fortress
of Tapers, which is stormed by the Egyptians on scaling-ladders,
while the defenders are hurled headlong from the battlements. Sew
veral sons of the Pharaoh, the names of whom are given, distinguish
themselves in the battle. Two of these (towards the left) are dew—
pieted on a larger scale than the others, viz. Khanem—us, the favou-
rite son of Ramses, and. Menth, prince of the blood, each of whom
is in the act of slaying an enemy. The younger princes, Mari-Amen,
Amen—emails, Seti, and Setep-en—Ra, covered with their shields,
take part in the attack (below the fortress). Diodorns apparently
had this scene in his mind when he described the Egyptian army as
commanded by the sons of the king.

The reliefs at the side of and above the portal (adorned with
the concave cornice) in the Rear Watt are in good preservation.
Each pillar is divided into four ﬁelds. In the ﬁrst (top) ﬁelds the
king is shown adoring to SokarmOsiris (on the left) and to PM (on
the right); in both the second ﬁelds he odors sacriﬁce to Amman
Generator; and in the third to Ammoana as king of the gods (left)
and to the same god as lord of heaven (right). From the fourth
ﬁelds we learn the use to which the following rooms were pot; on
the left is enthroned the ibismheaded ThothmHermea, god of wisdom
and of writings; on the right (opposite) is Safekh, goddess of history

(recognizable by the ’21 above her head), named here ‘the king‘s

mother Safekh, the great mistress of boohnwriting’. At the foot is
the dedicatory inscription, informing us that the king erected this
palatial building to his father Amman, king of the gods and lord
of heaven, prince of Thebes. -—-- On each side of the door is a proa-
eession of youthful forms, with the lock of hair hanging to the side,
peculiar to the royal children. Their left hands are raised, and their

right hands hold the herdsman’s crook T, the symbol of princely

dignity, and the fan , the symbol of court-rank. The list to the

right is the more complete; but at the end of the procession on the
left two princesses appear, who are wanting in the other. Over the
ﬁrst ﬁgures but applying equally to the others appear the full titles
of Egyptian royal princes. The ﬁrst is as follows: ‘The fan—bearer
at the right hand of the king, the prince and royal scribe, the leader
of the army, the great (Ur) son of the king, the ﬁrst-born of his
body, his beloved Amen—hi—khOpeshf’. While this son is named the
(great) son of the king, the next one, Ramessn, is called the (great)
son of the lord of both worlds. The third prince, Ra~hi~nanemif
(Ra at his right hand) is named master of the horse and charioteer.
Fourth comes the king’s favourite son, Kha~em«us(eee above), whose
