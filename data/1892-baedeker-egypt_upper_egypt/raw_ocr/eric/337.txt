reaping. Good representations of Egyptian donkeys. From the
point where the two tombs touch, another passage leads to a
mummynsbaft, at the back of which is a square chamber.
Climbing up to the right from this double tomb we ﬁnd several
other tombs, most of which have no inscriptions. One belongs to

to have been a high ofﬁcial under Amcnemha I. It seems also to
be the sepulchre of his son (‘3) Si Renpnt (son of Satihotep), whose
portrait is of frequent occurrence in this tomb and who is named
commander of the light troops in the S. frontier districts. Beyond
a narrow passage follows a hall with 6 square columns, and then
another passage with three recesses on each side, the ﬁrst on the
left containing a bearded ﬁgure of Osiris. At the end of the second
passage is a small chamber with four columns, whence a long
passage leads to the right to a quadruple shaft.

Farther on, at the top of another ascent, is a tomb, named after
the Prince of Naples who was present at its opening, and belongs—-
ing to Baikhcnu, a priest at the pyramid of Pepi H (p. 269). Then
the large sepulchrec of Khuncs and secures. Finally on the N. side
of the same hill is the interesting tomb (No. 3‘2) of another Si
Benput (son of Tens), who served under Uscrtesen 1., and was
grandfather or greatugrandfather of the above—named St Renput
through his daughter Satihotep. To the right and left of the en-
trance are some half—defaced inscriptions. The antechamber has
seven pillars, on one of which (to the right) reference is made to
a campaign undertaken by the king for the subjection of a hostile
tribe (Kat 1?). Another important inscription (unfortunately dam-
aged), over the entrance to the rock-atomic proper, treats of the
influential position enjoyed by Si Renput under the king and“ m
the campaign against Kush (Ethiopia). To the left scenes of ﬁsh-
spearing and fowllng, and cattle. In the interior are a small tetra-
style ball, a long passage, and then another tetrastyle hall, at the
back of which is a recess. We may descend direct from this tomb
to the bank of the river.
