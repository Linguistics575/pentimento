(see below), with a little salt (a 1615 0/9), die Hose}: (spring of Moses) to
the N. of Siwah, and “din ten Lif to the S. The climate is unhealthy only
towards the end of summer, when the evaporation of the numerous marshes
induces fevers. These mshes (soothed) add largely to the difﬁculty
of travelling about the oasis. The mean temperature is 77° Fahr. - The
oasis contains about ammo date—palms; and about 3% tons (90m camel-
loads) of dates are annually exported to North Egypt by the Beduin tribe
of the WetedwiAli. The olive tree also ﬂourishes here, oranges and in»
mono in linearised, and throughout the oasis grapes, pomegranates, aprir
cots, peaches, plums, and a kind of dwarf apple. ...... Live stock. is not
numerous, owing to a dangerous fly, about as large as a bee, whose sting
is fatal to cattle and camels. Wild pigeons abound. ~— Salt is procured
by evaporation in an almost pure state. Sal ammoniac is prepared by
artiﬁcial distillation from camels" dung. Minntoli estimated the number
of the inhabitants at 8000, llohlfs at 5600. The two principal tribes, the
Lifayeh and the Roar-byte, both of which include numerous sub-tribes, are
hostile to each other. ..... The annual tribute to the Egyptian government
is 10,130 Maria Theresa thalers, equal to about 2W3. An Egyptian go-
vernor presides over the oasis. Strangers are quartered in the Kerr, to
the N. of the castle of Siwah, near the date-magazine and the dome of
didi some. Starch and Akﬂ’ﬂii, the chief towns situated like castles upon
steep rocks, lie about 3 M. apart. The streets of both are narrow. Siwah
belongs to the Ltfeyoh and. only the portion of the oasis to the S.W. of
it belongs to the Rharbyta, including Akermi. The Lifayah are forbidden
to enter Akermi, in consequence of their having suddenly seized the town
about it) rears ago", though they were afterwards repelled by the lthars
byin. Shdkh Mohammad Bjorn, the richest man in the caste, resides at
Akerrni as head of the natives.

The mine now to be found are very scanty. The tri leewalled castle
described by lliodorus (see p. 345) appears to be identide with the loftily
situated Abel-mi, also called Sharttysh. An early Egyptian structure,
discovered here in 1&3 under some modern houses by the Scottish
traveller James Emitter, was easily recognised as the fore—court and
chamber of a temple or palace. The interior walls were covered with
hieroglyphics, but so blackened with smoke that the kings’ cartouches
could not be recognized. In the thickness of the well was a narrow
passage, 6 ft. long and 2 ft. wide. In an adjoining street was a colossal
Egyptian gate. Rthfs conﬁrmed this discovery in 1869. Fassing along a
narrow, winding passage, he observed a building with foundation-walls
of hcwn stones, and to the W. of it he came upon the large ediﬁce, the
outer walls of which are visible from outside the village, while the
inner wall extends to the great square of Alter-mi. A rough passage
admits to a forecourt, 15 ft. long and, 10 ft. broad. Two large Egyptian
gateways (181/2 ft. high) lead to the holy of holies, which is entirely ob-
stmcted by houses; the gateways can be passed only through the houses.
Rohlfs found a large number of pictures and. insert tions here, and
copied some of them by candle-alight. The cells was ft. long, 181/: ft.
broad, and 181/2 ft. high. A secret passage, 2 ft. wide, within the E. wall
communicated with the great well of Akermi.

About 300 paces to the S. of Akermi lie the ruins of Um et-dedh
(white mother), facing the town and lying from N. to S. In the time of
Gailliaud and Minutoli the ruins consisted of the left wing of the gate-
way and a covered. portion behind. The former, which has now dis-
appeared, contained the representation of a king oﬁ‘eriug to the rando-
headed Ammon and. his female companion. The other portion, which
still remains, is iii/2 ft. long (at places only 10% ft.) and about % ft.
high, with a passage 16% ft. wide. 0n the right and left sides are pro-
classless of gods in several rows, with the above-mentioned root‘s-headed
Arnmou as the chief deity. Above these gods are numerous vertical lines
of hieroglyphicsm’iﬁ on the W. wall, 53 on the E. (lam-wot which we
unfortunately possess no copies. The ceiling consists of three (before

broad, and 3 ft. thick, decorated with vultures (the symbol t l dship)
