1 kins. The ceremony is named in the inscription ‘tke Building

  

ofihc Temple’; and the words placed in the month of the king and
arranged above the Khns run: ‘I have built the monument, the greet
one, as a perfect building to all eternity’. The ceremony represented
in the following design also refers to the building of the temple.
The king, kneeling before Hathor, is shown shaping the ﬁrst burned ’
brick for the girdles-wall of the temple. As has already been men»-
tioned in the description of the cult of Hathor, that goddess is from
quently extolled in the inscriptions at Denderah as the goddess of
joy, at whose festival wine ﬂowed freely and the air was fragrant
with incense and all the perfnmes of Arabia. Thus, as the inscrip~
time here inform no, the king mingles grains of incense and wine
with the material out of which he moulds the brick. On both sides
of the portal admitting to the hell are two long inscriptions, each
consisting of 14 vertical lines, and containing a list of all the names
under which the great Esther was worshipped at Denderah and else-
wherein Egypt. This is followed by a list of the chief gods and
divine geniuses, those of the temple at Edfo. being named. in great-
est detail; and ﬁnally comes a list of the sacred serpents of Dendorah,
which were probably not kept in the temple itself, but in the ad-
joining sacred groves.

E. external wall as 111/3 ells long and 61/2 ells broad. The ﬁrst

Asht. The inscriptions here clearly indicate that the incense, so
lavishly need at the sacred festivals, was compounded in this room
according to strictly observed recipes in which all kinds of sweet-a,
smelling ingredients were employed; and that the holy oils and
ointments for the various ceremonies were also here prepared. We
may therefore name this apartment the Temple Laboratory. '3' All the
designs and inscriptions on the four walls of this apartment refer to
the incense prepared and preserved hero; to the oils and ointments
need in the temple services; and to the various ingredients of which
they were composed. Two sevonvlined vertical inscriptions on the
two parts of the entrancemwall contain what is to a certain extent a
summarised description of the representations on the adjoining walls
to the right and left. On each well are two representations, 5.6. font
