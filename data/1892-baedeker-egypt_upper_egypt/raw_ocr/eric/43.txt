‘Etesia’ blows, which Herodotus mentions as driving heats up the Nile,
the long pointed craft dies quickly along, passing in rapid succession
the Khediye’s palace and the barracks of Kasr err-Nil, Kasr el—‘Ain,
the island of Rodah with its palaces (on the E. bank), and the chi-s

farther on, are the quarries and hamlets of Torah and Ma‘sarah (see
Baedeker’e Lower Egypt, p. 403). Opposite, on the W. bank, rise the
pyramids of Abusir, Sakkhrah, and Dahshdr. Near the bank, to the
left, amidst a ﬁne grove of palms, is a Ceptic consent, and adjacent
is a gunmiaetory, begun by lsma‘il Pasha, but never ﬁnished.

The steamer remains for some hours at Bedrashén (rail. stat,
p. i), where asses are kept ready for a visit to Memphis, Sakkhrah,
etc. (comp. Bacdelcer’s Lower Egypt, R. 4}. Opposite, on the right
bank of the Nile, lies Helwan (ibid, p. 404), frequented as a water-
ingmplace. ...... 0n the bank at Kofr el-‘Aydt (W. bank; rail. stat),

soil of the desert, 1% H. to the N. of the village of Harlem. This appears
to be the oldest of the local names handed down to us, as it is met with

The Pyramid of Iédhm is so diﬂ‘ereut from all the other structures of
the kind that it is called by the Arabs ‘Ehﬂarm el—Kodddb", or ‘the false
persons". From a large heap of rubbish which covers its base, the
smooth and steep upper part of the structure rises in. three diﬁ'erent
stages at an angle of 74° 10', and is still preserved to a height of 122 ft.
The ﬁrst section is 69 ft, and the second hill/2 ft, while the third, now
almost entirely destroyed, was once 32 ft. in height. The outer wsdlseou-

holes in one of the surfaces were made by Lepsius an Erbkam when
they examined the pyramid, the construction of which aﬁ‘orded them an
admirable clue to the principle upon which the others were built (Vol. 1.,
p. 350). The Pyramid of Hidden was never completed; the heap of debris
at its base consists of the material which once ﬁlled the angles of the
different sections, so as to give the pyramid a smooth surface. The pyra-
