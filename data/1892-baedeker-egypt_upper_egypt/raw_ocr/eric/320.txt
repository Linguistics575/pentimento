the contests of the god Home with his enemies who are depicted
as crocodiles and hippopotami. Perhaps the overthrow of the toes
of King Ptolemy X. Soter H. is symbolically represented in these
compositions. The cartonches on this wall probably belong to this
king; one of them contains the name of Ptulmis, while the other is
vacant. The name of Ptolemy XI. Alexander I. does not appear
until near the left extremity of the wall, towards the end of the
list of names.

The Representations, ranged in two registers, are 22 in number. The
chief are the following: list Scene (below, to the right). The king, stand-
ing on shore, attempts to transﬁx a hippopotamus, that bends its head
aside. Horns, who is accompanied by his mother Isis does the same; in
his left hand he holds a chain, and in his right a Javelin; beside the
helm is a small Horus.—-2nd Scene. The king appears on land, before
two ships, in each of which are a Home and an assistant with a hour‘s
head. Horas holds the hippopotamus with a chain and pierces its head
with a javelin; the assistant carries a ,iayelin in his right hand and a
knife in his left. width Scene. The hippopotamus lies on its back. with
a chain fastened to its hind feet.—-—'lth Scene (the ﬁnest of all). Home,
in a ship with expanded sail, aims a blotsr with his right hand at the
head of a hippopotamus, whose hind foot is caught in a line held in the
god‘s left hand. Isis kneeling in the bow of the boat holds the head of
the animal by a cord. The king, standing on the bank with two attem-
dants armed with javelin and knife. seeks to pierce the skull of the
hippopotamus.

0n the inside of the N. Girdtewtoolt (Pl. g g) are several long
hymns to the god of Edfu. --- The traveller is recommended to walk
round the outside of the girdles-wall, which is also completely
covered with representations and inscriptions. The above-mentioned
important inscription relating to the history of the temple is to be
seen on the outside of the W. Watt (P1. i), and the description of
the "serious rooms outside the E. Walt (Pl. k). The eight Records
of Donations of Fields arealso on the E. well. These inscriptions
and the decoration of the entire external face of the girdlewwall
date from the reign of Ptolemy XI. Alexander I. (NS-87 3.0.).

The half-buried Birth House (Mamcisi), lying to the left of the entrance
to the great temple of Horus, is less worthy of a visit. It was built by
Ptolemy IX. Energetes II. ., While the interior decorations date from
Soter II. In the Interior are seven representations of Hathor, who facili~
tate the birth of the young Horns and nourish him.
