In German there are also pieces of 1/2 and 1/4 Millieme (called also
2 Para and 1 Para pieces, from the old system), but these are used only
for hukahish by tourists.

The difference between Tarif—piastres and Gurrent-ptastres has been
legally abolished; but it still lingers among shopkeepers, so that pur-
chasers should be careful to ascertain in which reckoning the prices of
goods are stated.

The Pound Sterling (Gina; ﬁnalist) is worth 97 iastres 5 million-1e;
the French Went? From piece (Biol, de ived from apoleon Bonaparte)
77 pins. 11/2 mill.; the Turkish Pound (g T.; Msjidiyeh) 873/4. piastres. A
‘purse‘ is equivalent to 500 piastres or about 1041:.

Before starting on the Nile-journey travellers are recommended to
provide themselves with at least 40 or 50 francs‘ worth of small Egyptian
coins (capacially 1/: piastres, 1 and 2 millieme-pieces, and copper). Even
in Cairo a commission is charged on the exchange.

III. The Nile Journey.

The ascent of the Nile may be made either by Steamer or by
Dhahabiych. The former is recommended to those who have not
more than three or four weeks to devote to a visit to the Nile valley
and the monuments of the Pharaohs; and in fact for the immense
majority of travellers , especially for those who do not belong to a
party, the steamers are the only practicable means of making the
Journey. Travellers, however, who desire to make a closer acquain-
tance with the country, who have abundance of time (to Assuan and
back at least 7—8 weeks), and who are indifferent to a considerable
increase of expense, should hire a dhahabiyeh (p. xix).

The company met with on board the steamers is generally un-
exceptionable, though, of course, it is always wise to use some little
exertion to secure an agreeable and sympathetic cabin-companion.
The trunks to be taken into the cabins should be small and handy,
