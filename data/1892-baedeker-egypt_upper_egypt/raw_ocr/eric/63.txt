here, as it were, the advance guard of the invasion of the Hyksos,
towards the end of the 12th Dynasty. The Hyhsos, named ‘Amu’
in an inscription in the neighbouring Specs Artemidos (p. H), con-
sisted of isolated tribes, who purchased permission to enter Enpt
by tribute, crossed its boundaries, and ﬁnally penetrated to the in»
terior. The chief Absha here bows before the Egyptian; his sue-
cessors carried things with a high band and bent the Egyptians
under their yoke. ........ The ﬂock of ostriehes behind the last Amu
belongs to the series of pictures on the left side of the wall, reu-
presenting Khnumhotep, accompanied by his dogs, slaying wild
beasts with bow and arrows. Below is a ﬂock of geese and a fowl--
ingmsoene. In the second row from. the feet are bulls ﬁghting and
scenes of cattleutending.

The S. Well (to the right) is occupied by processions of servants
bringing gifts for the dead, a frequent subject in these representa~
tions, and the oﬁering of animals in sacriﬁce. Before one altar is
the ﬁgure of Khnumhotep, before another his wife Khnti, daughter
of Pent. r

The traveller will ﬁnd many of the above scenes new defaced
beyond recognition, but he should not let this deter him from walls-v
ing a little farther to the S. and enterng some of the other tombs.
That of thti, one of the nearest (No. 7), easily recognised by the
three pairs of columns supporting the roof, contains interesting,
though half-obliterated representations of the innumerable gymnastic
and fencing exercises and games of the ancient Egyptians. Girls
are seen throwing the ball from one to another, and men ponder
carefully ever a game of draughts. The Hunting Scenes are of
linguistic value, as the names of the diﬁ’erent animals are written
above them. Among these was a stag, new totally oﬁaced. Mechanw
ice are depicted at work here and elsewhere. --- Travellers who see
the tombs of the new kingdom at Thebes, after having visited the
graves of Benihasan, will be astonished at the vastness of the im»
pression made upon the life and sentiment of the Egyptians by the
Hyksos period. At Benihasan everything recalls the tombs in the
Pyramids, and the subjects of representation are drawn wholly from
this earth ; under the New Empire scenes of the future life and re»
presentations of the gods are also given. We should also notice that
the horse, so common in later times, never appears under the early
empire. The forms of the columns, including the beautiful lotus capi-
tals (see Bacdekcr’s Lower Emt, p. 164), are of the greatest inter»
eat. The protouDoric column is seen here in all stages ofderelopment.
The plain pillar, the octagonal pillar, the octagonal and sixteen-w
sided columns, with and without ﬂutes, all occur at Benihasan side
by side and may be looked upon as practical illustrations of the
section upon the Cavern Budding of the Egyptians in the intro»
duration to Lower Egypt (p. 160).
