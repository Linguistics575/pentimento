his sanctuary, which had been raised by their ancestors, and to
make it more magniﬁcent than before’.

An inscription (on the outside of the E. girdle-wall) states that
this beautiful monument (the present temple) lay behind (is. pro-
bably to the S. of) the building of his father; another (on the in-
side of the some well) records that the foundationnstone was laid
in the time of Fish in the holy place of Tea Her for the God Ba;
and a third (on the inside of the N. girdleuwall) informs us (on the
left) that the building was carried out ‘as it was in the plan of the
great writing that fell from heaven to the N. of Memphis’, and (on
the right) that ‘this great wall was built according to the book of
the arrangement of temples, written by the Kherhch Imhotcp, son of
the god Ptah’.

An inscription in one of the crypts at Denderah (Mariette Ill, 78) men-
tions a foetal journey of Hathor from Deriderah (p. 80) to the temple of
Home at Edie. This festival, which was established by Tutmes Ill.
(1600 3.0.) took place at the new moon of the month Epiphi.

The Nose, still to be found in the holy of holies (p. 252), bears
the namewrings of Nectanehns I. (378-360 13.0.) and probably
dates from the original temple. The document, inscribed on the
outside of the E. wall of the temple, relating to the gifts of lands,
mentions King Darius as well as Nectanebus I. and Nectanebus H.
as benefactors of the temple.

Two accounts of the building of the present temple have come
down to us. The shorter of these occurs on the outside of the W.
wall of the temple proper, in the second line of the lower marginal
inscription, dating from the time of Ptolemy IX. Energetes IL;
the, other, at greater detail, in the anew-dine lower Marginal In»
scriplion, on the outside of the W. girdles-wall. In the second inn
scription we read as follows:

“On this beautiful day of the opening of the building in the 10th year
(supplied from the shorter inscription), on the 7th Epiphi (the. Aug. $3,
237 B.C.l, in the time of King Ptolemy Ill. Eucrgetes I. "it was a festival
of the Sixth, when the interior of the ground was opened, the ﬁrst of all
the festivals of the Sixth of the ceremony of laying the foundation.

point for determining its halls. its side~chembers (were erected) in their
places, carefully arranged by the wise (seen). The sacred architects built
with the lord of the papyrus-writing. The great hall of the temple was

10th year, on the 7th Epiphi, in the reign of King Ptolemy 1V. Hello-t
pater“ (a date corresponding to Aug. 17, 212 3.0.). Thus 25 years (ﬂ? 13.0.
to 212 3.0.) were spent in erecting the walls of the temple.

The decoration of the walls with hieroglyphics and reliefs and the
completion of the great gateway and of the two ducts to one of the one
are noted as follows:

‘The inscrihing of its walls with well~executed sculpture of the
names, the great ones, of His Majesty, and with the ﬁgures of the gods and
goddesses, the digniﬁed ones of the shining city (one of the many names
of Edie), and the ﬁnishing of its great door and of the two wings of the
