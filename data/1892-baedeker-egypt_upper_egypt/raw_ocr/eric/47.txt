4 Route 1. A’lTFm. From Cairo

‘ 'A little farther to the N. is the tomb of diet, the Wife of Nefermdt.
0n the architraye over the doorway we see the husband of the deceased
engaged in snaring birds, while a servant presents the spoil to the mis-
tress of the house, whose complexion is of a brilliant yellow. On the
outside wall, to the left, we observe the cattle of the deceased browsing
on reeds. On the right stands Refer-mat, who, as the inscription informs
no, ‘cansed this monument to be erected to his gods in indestructible
characters‘. Among the domestic animals are several cattle of very
bright colours. We also notice a gazelle held by the horns by a butcher,
who is cutting od‘ its head. Oderings of wine were also made at this
early period. In the passage leading to the Serddb is a group of labonr~
ere bosily at work. The hunting—scenes are cartons, and, notwithstanding
their simplicity, remarkably tree to nature. Among them is a greyhound
seizing a gazelle by the leg, and another carrying a longueared here.

A. few paces to the RE. is another mastaba built of wellehewn blocks
of limestone. The hieroglyphics and low reliefs, resembling those in
the tomb of Ti at Sahhdrah, are admirably executed. The deceased inn
terred here was named Kissed, and his wife More. Trevor-sing the vestia
hole and a narrow passage, we reach a tomb-chapel with a sacriﬁcial
table, in the passage, on the right, is a handsome male ﬁgure with a
lease, and on the left are stoncwmasons, engaged in making sarcophagi.
0n the left, in the innermost niche of this tomb, we perceive the de-
ceased, and on the right, his wife. We next some to a ruined mastaba,
and to another tomb, half excavated, which was constructed for Rotten
tap, a son of Snefru, one of the highest civil and military dignitaries of
the kingdom, and his wife chm, a relation of the‘royal family. The
statues of this married couple, who died young, or at least are so reprew
seated, which are new among the principal treasures of the museum of
Giseh, were found here. Farther to the W. are several other tombs, now
covered up.

On the right bank, Opposite Rihhah and about ﬁll/2 M. from the
river, lies the hamlet of Am, with some mounds of earth and
debris representing the ancient Aphroditopolis, the territory of which,
according to Strobe, adjoined that of Acanthns [Dahshdr), while its
capital lay, on the Arabian bank of the Nile. A. town of Aphrodite
must also be one of Esther, the Egyptian goddess of love, to whom
the white cow, which Strobe says was worshipped here, was sacred ;
it was the capital of Matched, the 22nd some of Upper Egypt. Its

hieroglyphic name was Top ads, head of the cow.

in the Christian period (ca. $10 All.) dphroditopolis gained some eels-
brity from St. Anthony, who fined his hermit e in the mountains to
the E. of the town, beside a well and a group 0 palms. So many pil-
grime of every class, age, and sex sought out the holy man, that a regular
posting route, with relays of camels, was laid out across the desert. St. Atr-
thony, however, ﬂed from his admirers and buried himself deeper in the
mountains. But while be than shook oﬁ‘ his earthly visitants, he could
not so sully escape those extraordinary tempters from spirit—land, at which
Callot has taught as to smile, thongh to St. Anthony himself, as well as
to St. Hilarion and other similarly persecuted anchorites, the contest was
one of bitter cement. The Coptic convent of lidr Antonina (p. 5), a few
leagues higher up, on the E. side of the Nile, still sends so plies to the
consent of St. Anthony, sitnated in the heart of the Arabian esert { . 6).

After passing a few small islands, we now reach (W. bank ela

shah, 1/4 M. from the Nile), where passengers bound for the Faydm
leave the dhahabiyeb and betahe themselves to the train (see R. 2).
El-Wastah is pleasantly situated in a grove of palms and is ear-

rounded with ﬁelds of clever.
