(in the left bank of the Nile, above Geri lingers, are the consid-

Geri Eugen, has been conjecturally identiﬁed with Kathie, men-
tinned in the Greek inscription of the ofﬁcers of Pee at .. at Abus-

the ‘Scorpion’, an animal that is here remarkably common. The
Roman general Petronius defeated the Ethiopians at Pselchis in
‘23 All, on his campaign to Napata (p. 302). Dakkeh early be»
came the site of a temple; Prof. Eisenlohr found a stone here with
the name of Amcncmha (new at Heidelberg). in the embankment
leading to the N. from the pylon, in the axis of the present temple,
stones of earlier buildings have been used, several with the car-
touche of Tutmes III. (which occurs also on a column) and. Seti l.
Gau’s theory that there was formerly another ediﬁce to the right,
almost as large as the present one to the left, seems insufﬁciently
supported, though suggested by existing remains. The present
temple was built by the native hing Ergamenes (the inner temple
0, comp. Pl. p. 317), Ptolemy IV. Philopator (Sekos B), and Phi--
lemy IX. Eucrgetes II. (the pronaos A), and it was completed by a

is usually understood. It has already been related (p. 30?.) that
the Nubian subahing Ergsmenes, in the reign of Ptolemy H. Phila-v
delphus freed himself from the priests at Napata, causing them to
be murdered in the temple there. Names of such Nubian sub-
kings, especially under the Roman empire, are found on the Ethio-
pian buildings and in the demotic inscriptions at Philae, Kalabsheb,
and Dahkeh. It is somewhat improbable that this same Ergamenes
was the builder of the temple of Dakkeh, for the Ergamencs of the

the title of ‘Piraa’ is usually employed only by the Roman empe—
rors (Augustus, Tiberius i). and often along with ‘Autokrator Kisw
res’, as in the innermost chamber D as well as in the front chamber
A at Dahkeh. 0n the other side, there are proofs that the chamber
D must be more ancient than the two front rooms, which existed
even under Ptolemy PhilOpator and Energetes H.

The present Temple Buildings of Dakkeh embrace the massive
pylons and the temple proper, lying 40 it. behind them, both face
