battle, is traditionally laid in the name of Apcliinopolis. An in«
soripticn relating to the Home myth, on the inside of the W.
girdle-wall, states that ‘they reached Setthyphon and his com-
panions in the name of Apollinopolis’.

Horus emerged victorious from this battle, and the evil Seth-
Typhen was pierced by him (tebu). ’Piercer thereupon became his
name, and. ‘plaoe of the piercing’ the name of his district and town.
This name is clearly preserved in the modern name Edfu. Arr-
other name, that occurs most frequently next to this one and has
also reference to the chief deity of the temple at Edfn, is Hot or
Beirut. Thus the winged suns-disc, which was placed over the en»
trance to every Egyptian temple, was named

625:1[2‘6’9 cal

Behut nuter a nob pe t ab en ti pro em hhu t

‘Hut, the great god, the lord of heaven, who clad in bright plume
age, comes forth from the sun—mountain .

Another name for the winged sunmdiso is Apt, which means
‘ﬂying’ and ’wings’.

At the head of the gods worshipped at Edfu stood, as is apps-:-
rent from what has already been said, ‘Horus, who spreads his
wings, the great god, the lord of heaven, who, clad in bright plum-m
age, comes forth out of the sun-mountain’. Next to him rank the
Hathcr of Denderah, who undertook a special foetal journey to Edie,
Ahi, son of Rather, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, She, and chnut.

History of the Temple. The representations and inscriptions
that cover the walls of the great temple of Home at Edfu place it
beyond doubt that the building in its present form dates from the
period of the Ptolemies. Yet like the sanctuary of Hathor at Don--
derah, it is not an architectonic creation of that period, but merely
a splendid restoration of an earlier temple carried out under the
Lagidae. The Temple proper, to. the sacred apartments exclum
sire of the later hypostyle with its 18 columns (Pl. E) and of the
fore-court with its 3‘2 columns (Pl. F), as well as of the still later
pylons and girdle-wall, was begun by Ptolemy HI. Eucrgctcr I. in
the 10th year of his reign. it was ﬁnished 9.3 years later, in the
28th year of the reign of Ptolemy 1X. Eusrgstes IL, and the 18th
Mesori in that year was ﬁxed by the priests for its consecration,
as an important festival took place upon that day. The image of
Home was. carried in solemn procession into the temple, and the
author of the builders’ inscriptions at Edfu, in describing this sea
lemn entry, introduces the god as astonished by the magniﬁcence
that greeted him, and moved by joy, as addressing his surrounde-
inge. In his speech the god. expressly states that ‘the balls were
renewed in their building’, and that ’commands went forth from
their majesties to rebuild. his house, an ediﬁce of anoienppimes, ,and
