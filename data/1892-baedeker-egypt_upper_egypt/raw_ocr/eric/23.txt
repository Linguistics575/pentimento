as NILE JOURNEY.

The chartering of a private dhahabiyeh is much cheaper though
much more troublesome. The ﬁrst step is to engage a Dragomon,
not without a careful enquiry as to his record at the consulate and
from the hatch-keepers, and an examination of the testimonials from
previous travellers. There are about 90 dragomans in Cairo, all
more or less intelligent and able, but scarcely a half of the number
are trustworthy. Most of them speak English or French, and a few
speak ltalian.

The following are well spoken of: Eastern Spoke, Ahmed Ramadan,
Ibrahim Salem, Ahmed Ahdcrrahim (owner of the Manhattan, p. xix), Eases
Bitters, Salim Sadjer, dishes” Assad, Abdallah Abdelhhalik (all these Egyp-
tians); Sale}: (9. Nubian); Michael (deli, Anton Sapienza (Maltese); Kansas“,
Lewis Mauser, Dneybis Pedal, Elias Telhany, and Elias Abmhdya (Syrians).
It cannot be too strongly impressed upon the traveller that it is essential
for him to show from the very beginning that he is and intends to re-
main the master. Even the best dragomans are inclined to patronize their
clients, a tendency which must at once be quashed.

The next step is to select a suitable dhahabiyeh assisted by the
dragoman. A contract is then made with the dragoman, either on»
trusting him with the entire preparations, or assigning to him only
the duty of engaging and paying the re‘is and crew, while the trav»
eller retains the commissariat department in his own hands. The
re‘is or steersmau is a most important functionary upon whose shill
during the often stormy passage the safety of the vessel depends.
The crew number from. 8 to 12 according to the size of the dhaha—
biyeh. The vessel is either hired by the day (for 2 pers. 5m6£., 3
or 4 pers. 6-75.) or chartered for the whole returnwvoyage to Assuin
(for ‘2 pers. 300-3506., 3 or 4 pers. 350-400l.) In the former case
the dragornan will try to travel as slowly as possible to protract his
engagement; in the latter case he will press on, so as to save
boat-hire and board. The latter arrangement is preferable, but the
right of halting for 15~20 days in the course of the journey should
carefully be stipulated for. The dragoman must also provide don-
keys and camels for the excursions. Farther details are indicated
in the following draftucontracts, in which it is believed that nothing
of importance has been overlooked. The contract must be signed at
the traveller’s consulate, either with the dragoman alone if he has
undertaken the whole of the arrangements, or with the dragoman
and. re'is, when the traveller has hired the db ahabiyeh and pays board
to the dragcman.
