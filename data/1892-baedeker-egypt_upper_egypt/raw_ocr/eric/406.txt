ABUuSIMBEL. 33. Route. 331

Nehi". In the recess at the end of the cave Tntmes HI. sits between
Horns and Sati. Immediately to the left is the second cave (about
10 it. deep), much less skilfully executed, in which appear ten
persons before Ramses. Among these are Seton, prince of Kush
(whose name is found elsewhere in Nubia), and a number of scribes
and ofﬁcials.

The third. cave, which lies a little higher up, also shows the
cartouohe of Tutmes Hi. The recess contains the somewhat roughly
executed ﬁgures of four seated personages; to the right the king
and Sati, to the left the king and Horns, lord of Mam.” The fourth
cave (from the S.) is the most important. It belongs to Amen-
hotep 11., who appears conducted. by Home, lord. of Beheni, to a
row of gods including Khnnm, Sati, and Anuke, the gods of the
cataracts, and Horns, Harbor, and Heben. --- To the S}. of liner
lbrim a few steles are found, one showing a victorious king in his
warwchariot.

The mountains presently retire, leaving room for a strip of with»
voted land. Numerous Sdhiyehs or waterwwheels are seen. To the
left (E) appears the village of Djimench, beside a pretty wood.
Farther on, on the some bank, lies Toshltch (Nubian ‘Threo Moun-
tains’), a small place among palms, with a somewhat unclvilized
population. At Toshbch el-Ghurb, on the W. bank, 7 M. from the
river, a large force of dervishes was defeated with the loss of their
cannon by the British on Aug. 32rd. 1889; several thousand slain
were left on the battle-ﬁeld, and their weapons and clothing were
sold by the neighbouring natives. Cook’s tourists may visit the
battleoﬁeld if they desire it.

The district we next enter upon is very monotonous and almost
uninhabited, and navigation is rendered difﬁcult by rocks. To the
left lie Gurgundi and three shéhhs’ tombs; then the villages of Debitt
and Frosty. The river-bed. becomes very wide at places. On the
right we catch sight of the colossi that guard the temple of Abe-
Simbel.

35. The Rock—Temples of Abu-Simbel.

Cook’s tourist~steamere usually reach Abu-Simhel in the evening of
the third. day, in time to permit of a visit to the temples before night.
Next morning they proceed to dei ljlalfah. 0n the return—voyage they
gain spend the night at AbumSimbel, starting next morning at 9 or
0 o’clock.

The two temples of Abu~8imbcl (‘Father of the Ear of Cor-11’)
die a short distance apart at the foot of a precipitous cliﬁ' close to the
W. bank of the Nile. No other temple in Egypt produces so unexeu
pectedly grand an sheet as the great rock temple of Ramses IL,
especially by moonlight. By itself it would repay the trouble of
the ascent from Philse, both by the dignity of its sculptuges and by
