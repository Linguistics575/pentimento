the king sits between Khnum and hooks, and in that on the left
between Horus, lord. of Bek, and the cow-headed Isis. The colours
of these pictures are walla-preserved. The doors to the little sanctu~
ary, which bore the name Raussrma sehotsp racism, is. ‘Ramses
adoring to the gods’, and the sanctuary itself are decorated with
various inscriptions. The king, staﬁ in hand, is conducted, on the
right by Sati, on the left by Mahet. 0n the wall to the right of the
door, Anuke, mistress of him, oh‘ers her breast to the king, on the

left Isis, mistress of the land of Khent m g Q , does the

same. Each calls herself his mother. Isis says that she bestows
upon him ﬁrmness along with her milk , so that he is said to have
been destined from his mother’s breast to long life and mighty
deeds. [Diodorus relates that Hephaestus appeared to the king’s
father, announcing to him that the news-born babe would subdue
the whole world; and in the long inscription at Abydos Ramses is
said to have done great deeds while still a child] On the side-
walls are scenes of homage to the king, with oﬁerings piled up
upon tables bearing the oartouches of Ramses H. At the back is a
recess with three obscure ﬁgures, perhaps Ptah, Amman, and
the king.

6 M. Temple of Benelux, dating entirely from Roman times. It
consists of a handsome pylon and of the temple proper, supported
by two columns, about 30 ft. farther back. The pylon stands upon
a solid platform of masonry, 14 ft. high and 95 ft. bread... The
portal, single instead of double as at Edfu and Philm, rises at the
back of this platform, surrounded by a low well. At the top is the
winged sunwdise, and within. and on the front (13.) and back CW.)

These sacriﬁcial scenes are particularly interesting because
they make known to us not only some of the native gods , whose
names may be of importance for our knowledge of the native lana-
guage ,7 but also the names of various native princes , such as the
