at Thcdcs. KARNAK. 11. Route. 131

In the second row, to the right, the king in his chariot dashes
against the discomﬁted foe, and aims a blow at a hostile leader,
distinguished by a feather. Next the king on foot deals the ﬁnishing
blow with his lance to an ofﬁcer, who has been brought to his knees.
To the left the victorious monarch fares homeward, preceded by
two rows of prisoners, named ‘hi anta on tahi’. The small ﬁgure
behind the chariot is the crown—prince Ramses. Then follows the
presentation of the prisoners, who are called Retennu and Tahennu
(is. crystalwcolcured, white), to Amman, Math, and Khunsu, who
also receive the captured gold and vessels. m Similar represents-w
tions occupy the lowest row. To the right is the pursuit of the
Khota in their chariots. The inscription above compares the king
to Sutekh and Boat, to a wolf and a lion, that roams through the
try—paths, to a ball that destroys the enemy in their blood. To the
left is the homeward journey. The king leads captives on foot, and
behind him is a chariot containing lettered prisoners, and preceded.
by two rows of the same. He brings his captives to the Theban triad,
who are here accompanied by the goddess Mat. There also are Ito—-
tonne, brought by the king from the land of Kheta ‘to ﬁll the lordly
palace of Ammon’.

o. The older E. part of the Temple of Ammon.
1. From the Hypoetylc Hall to the Sanctuary.

We now return to the central row of lofty columns with the
calyx—capitals, and. follow it eastwards to Pylon 111., which we pass
through on our way towards the sanctuary, like the more highly pri-
vileged worshippers admitted to the temple in early times. This
part of the temple has been terribly destroyed, but enough has been
left standing to aﬁord an idea of the general arrangement. The
picturesque client of the ruinous scene is enhanced by the variety
of artistic forms employed, and by the tall and slender shape of the
largest obelisk in. Egypt, rising from the midst of the ruins, and
testifying to the past proud splendour of this truly royal ediﬁce, which
has been ruthlessly trcdden under foot by the monotonous cycle of
years and shattered by war and earthquakes. ....... The nearer we
approach to the sanctuary the older are the parts of the temple we
traverse. The inscriptions aﬁord materials for ascertaining the date
of each diﬁerent portion; while the practised eye will not ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to support the conclusions thus arrived at by comparison
of the successive styles of art. We here ﬁnd the polygonal pillar"-
column and the ﬁnely carved budwcolumns, bearing clear and un-
mistakeablo evidence as to the idea, to which this order owed its
origin. The third pylon seems to have marked the limit of the
temple under the early empire, before the gigantic buildings of
the 19th Dyn. were added. The W. side of this pylon, within the
great bypostylemball, still shows the incisions models the ,wall.
