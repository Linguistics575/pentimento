on the throne of Osiris. In front of him stands Horus, ‘the avenger of
his father", investing him with immortality, while behind is the jacks]-
headed Apheru (Anubis), ready to protect him from danger. Above the
dedicatory inscription Thoth, the god of divine eloquence, promises Osiris
Rama-men that the chle of the Nine Gods will entitle him with ever-
lasting life. In the chapel itself the representations are very numerous.
The king, in one, appears as a sphinx, resting on a base bearing the
names of six nations that he has conquered. A somewhat singular scene
represents standard—bearers with the assigns of the homes, personifying
the emblems of life, constancy, and power in threefold repetition; those,
like the inscriptions between the standard-poles, teach us that Seti was
endued with courage, length of days, uninterrupted safety and strength,
victory, abundance, and the kingdom of Egypt for life. it would be weari-
some to enumerate the multitude of other inscriptions of a similar tenour.
Among the 22 representations in the king‘s chapel, many of which are in
a very dilapidated condition, the most noteworthy is one in which the
king appears on the throne of Osiris, embraced by the goddesses Nekheb
(Eileithyia) and Beta. Thoth and Horns draw tighter the stems of the
plants symbolising Upper and Lower Egypt, which unfold the sign of union
'_ sane. Satchh, the goddess of history, behind Thoth, inscribes the name

 

of the king. In another scene Seti ° seated on a throne supported by
three ﬁgures in the form of Horus an three in the form of Anubis. Unv
der a canopy adorned with Urmuseerpents appears the state barge of the
king, robably a representation of the vessel kept in. this temple and borne
on big in the processions. Similar representations of the chi in which
the Sun-God was supposed to traverse the heavens have been ound made
of bronco er the precious metals and may be seen in the museum at Giceh
(see Busdeker’r Lowe-r Egypt) and elsewhere. Below are canopi (Vol. 1., p. 301),
in front sacriﬁcial offerings, and behind Thoth and Henmutei‘. ....... We
observe that everything here refers to the king, whose name recurs in weari—
some iteration, and who here receives back. again as Osiris the oﬁ‘erings
he had himself made, during his mortal life, to Osiris and thus to his
future self, the Osirisepotheosis of his soul.

A door in the Osiris Chapel (Pl. e), the third from the right wall, leads
to the rear-structure (Pl. E) mentioned at p. 62. Though the structure is
in a very ruinous state, its groundwplan can easily be made out. A. colon-
node, the roof of which, once supported by 10 columns, has fallen to the
ground, stood in direct connection with the Osiris chapel. It contains 4? re—
presentations, some of which are almost wholly ed‘aoed. By the wall, to
the right on entering, lay three small chambers adorned with ﬁne soul ture.
The ﬁrst of these (Pl. i) is dedicated to Horus, the second (Pl. k) to siris,
the third (Pl. 1) to Isis. Behind them lay another room (Pl. h). In the
wall to the left on entering Room E is a door leading to a room (Pl. m)
with four columns, which was adjoined by three smaller apartments (Pl. n,
o, p). Though the most sacred mysteries were celebrated in this suite of
rooms, they od‘er little that is novel; the implements of the priests were
kept in the side-rooms. Here, no doubt, many a spectacle was prepared
which, when displayed in the Osiris chapel, ﬁlled the pious worshippers
with awe and wonder.

ruinous and most of them roofless, a court, and some smaller

even if all the others be omitted, is a long (65 it.) and low Corridor

between the second and third row of columns. The flat ceiling is
