Thrash for yourselves,

Thrash for yourselves,

Once thrash

For yourselves. Thrash

For yourselves. The straw
Remains for you to eat.

The grain is for your masters.
Do not let wears»

Nose steal over your heart. There is abundance to drink!

In the series below these, Pikm‘t is seen with a book. in which he is
writing, before him a large writing apparatus. The accompanying inscrip-
tion is: ‘Recording the number of cattle by the overseer of Anit, the director
of the ﬁelds of the 8. district, from the temple of Esther (Aphroditopolis,
p. 231) to eluKab.‘ ...... Then follow cattle 0 various kinds, calves, oxen,
asses; several of these being prepared for the table or for sacriﬁce; a ﬁre-
place. Next appears Pihari, seated and inspecting the weighing and ship-
ping of gold which is mostly made into rings. Farther to the right, the
catching and pro arin of ﬁsh and also of poultry, Pihari standing and
looking on. ~— A are ihari bears on his lap the young prince Uasmes,
second son of king Aahmes (1680 BE.) whose nurse (he. tutor) he is
named. Pihari with his wife At retail, in a bower, receiving fruit.
Grapes are being gathered, and troddeu out in a wine-press by nude
ﬁgures, holding cords as they work.

The remaining paintings illustrate the Burial of Pihari, whose cofﬁn
is drawn upon a sledge. On the right well Pihari and his wife receive
an oh‘ering made by their son smoother, who is clad in a leopard‘suskin.
Beneath the chair is a cynocephalus. Behind Amonmes the mourning
friends are seated in two divisions. At the head of each division is a
seated married couple, and then two rows of relatives, father, mother,
grandfather, grandmother, brothers, sisters, and aunts; above is the ship-
master dahmes, son of Abna with his wife; below is Ateﬁsro the nurse
of King Uazmes, and at the foot, female musicians and a female harper.

Of the tombs to the right that of thmes surnamed Pen hcbcn or
Pro cobra is noteworthy, not only because two stones from the base
of a statue with historical inscriptions (new in the Louvre) were
found here and because a statue ot‘Aahmes was discovered in 1883 in
the ruins of el—Kab, but also because the services rendered by the
deceased to the kings of the 18th Dye. and the rewards he received
are recorded on the right and left of the entrance, as well as on the
stones above-mentioned. The kings mentioned are Aahmes, Amen-
hotep 1., Tattoos 1., 11., and 1.11., and Queen us, with her son

and daughter. See Lepsius’e Denkrnaler 111, $6.

From these inscriptions we learn that debates, surnatned Port bobcat,
followed the kings of the 18th Dyn. from Aabznes to Tutrncs 111. on their
various campaigns to Zahi, Rush, Naharina, and against the Sheen, and
that he captured men, horses, and chariots, for which he received rich
gifts. In thistoinb is also commemorated the royal prince Wiretap, our“

named Hapu, chief tsp of El ch, whose father, grandfather,

and greatvgrandfatheralso held the same dignity. Probably this Amen-
hotep reposed also in this tomb.

To the left of the tomb of Pihari, which we inspected ﬁrst, is
that of Seton, whose daughter’s husband Rooters Name in a leopard‘a
shin brings to him the shortage of the high-priests. A. crowd of
relatives, including Hui, another conninwlaw, is also represented.
In this tomb mention is made of the ith year of a kingﬁauneferka . . .,
