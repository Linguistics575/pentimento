The oasis and the oracle of Ammon were celebrated from a remote
antiquity. Bacchus is said to have been the ﬁrst to consult the oracle;
and in the legend of Perseus and Andromeda, the latter was said to have
been offered to the sea-monster to save her country, in obedience to a
response of this god. Hercules presented a great oﬁ‘ering to Amman. Semiramis
consnlted the oracle on her expedition to Egypt. The law-giver Bocchoris
(lichen-rant”; 28th Dying 8th cent. 3.0.) expelled the Jews from the land at the
bidding of the god. Psammetikh I. enrolled the Carlene with plumes ofcoek‘s
feathers in obedience to his response. Herodotus relates (Ill, 25, 26} that
Gambyses sent 50,600 men to take the Ammonites slaves and to destroy their
oracle with ﬁre. This force reached the city of Oasis, also called the Island
of the Blessed, after 7 days march, and then vanished into space, apparently
being overwhelmed by a whirlwind. The oasis and its oracle are, how—
ever, best known from the visit of Alexander the Great, recorded by Dio-
doms (XVII, 49), Quinton Cartier, and Ari-tan after Aristobulns. After
Alexander had made himself master of thnicia by the battle of Issue,
he marched to Egypt which submitted without resistance. Desiring to
consult the famous Oracle of Ammon, he undertook the adventurous march
throngh the desert. Ambassadors from Cyrcne met him with a valuable
gift of warwhorses. His supply of water came to an end after four days,
and he was only saved from perishing by an nnenpectcd fall of rain. The
way was pointed out to him by crows, flying on the right side of the
army. He passed the Bitter Lakes, then 100 stadia (about 10 M.) farther
the so-cslled Cities of Ammon, and another day‘s journey brought him to
the vicinity of the temple. Diodorns thus describes the place. "l‘he Am—
monites dwell in villages, but in the midst of their land is a castle de-
fended by a triple wall. The ﬁrst (is. innermost) wall encloses the pau-
lace of the ruler; the second the women‘s apartments, with the dwellings
of the women and children and the palladia of the place, with the temple
of the god and the sacred spring; the third encloses the abode of the
spearmen, etc. A little beyond the castle another temple of Ammon has
been erected under the shade of nomerons large trees. Hear it is a spring,
called Spring of the Sea on account of its peculiar properties. It is warm
in the morning, cold at midday, and hot at midnight. The image of the
god is encrusted with emeralds and other game , and gives its oracular
responses in a cartons way. It is carried in a golden boat on the shoal-
ders of eighty priests, who direct their course according to signs from the
god. Women and girls accompany the god with songs".

When Alexander entered the temple he was hidden welcome by the
oldest priest in the name of the god. Alexander accepted the welcome
and promised to worship the god, if he gave him the lordship of the
whole earth. The king then asked whether all the murderers of his is.-
ther had been punished. The oracle replied that no one could aim at the
life of him that had made him (is. of the god); but that the murderers
of Philip were punished

The Oasis of Starch, formerly called also Seaman‘s (after lskander, Ale-
xander the Great) lies, according to Jordan‘s calculations, 95 it. below the
scavlevel, in N. lat. 29012’ and long. 25031’ E. of Greenwich. Browne
estimated the length of the oasis at 71/2 hi, its breadth at 6 hi. Rohli‘s
estimates the length from Mamet in the W. to Marley Yes in the E. at
about 181/2 hi, in a line running ﬁrst KW. and SE. and beyond Siwah S.W.
and NE. The breadth varies from a few yards to 11].; M. It is situated
on the S. verge of the steep so~called Libyan coast~platcan, which con»-
sists of limestone, and on the 8. it is bounded by sand-hills.

Several steep rocks are found in the oasis; as. the Atheist and Djari
in the W., the Gabe! Mdtdh, Ils M. to the N. of Siwah, the rocks of Streak
and Atermi, Gsbet Side: Horned to the 8., and. Global Brit: to the S.E. of the
capital. Of the numerous warm springs (upwards of 30) in the oasis,
the strongest are those of Method, and the most famousginfp do:
