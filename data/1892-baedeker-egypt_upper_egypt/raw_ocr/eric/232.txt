Semitic. All of them have pointed boards, and several have long
ringleted hair in ﬁllets ; while those of higher rank wear long robes and
short cloaks of a ﬁnenwoven, richly patterned cloth, dyed a bright
blue and red. Their feet are naked but their legs are covered to the
ankle. Nude slaves, wearing only aprons, appear among them carry-
ing the tribute. Besides costly vessels, lapiswlasuli, and cornelians,
they also bring a lion and two splendid light-coloured horses.

15. u Hahn.

To the SW. of Kurnet Hanoi, and at no great distance, appears
an extensive temple-group. This bears the name of Medinet Hahn, a
Christian village which arose around and even within the ancient
sanctuary as early as the 6th cent, and of which considerable traces
still remain. 0n the N. side ofthe temple—ruins rise heaps of rubbish,
which we follow in the direction of the river, until we reach the
main facade, which fronts the S.E. and is as imposing as it is
curious. The traveller of experience will at once perceive that
here we have not to do with a monument erected, like the Ramos—-
scum, under the inﬂuence of a single continuous impulse, but with
a building begun in early times and not completed until the epoch
of the Ptolemies. The entire ediﬁce may be divided into three
easily distinguished portions. The earliest of these is the small
oblong temple (Pl. N), lying parallel with the N. girdle-wall, and
founded under the 18th Dynasty. The most recent is the pylon
(Pl. K) adjoining this, with a beautiful and richly adorned portal,
seen to cepecial advantage by those who approach the temple from
the plain. A. glance at the capitals of the two large columns rising
in front of the gateway and at the style of the inscriptions informs
the expert that this ediﬁce dates from the epoch of the Ptolemies.
Reserving these for later inspection, we proceed ﬁrst to the third
portion, the main temple.

The Mam Tasman on Mnninnr Ham; was erected as a Memos-
nium by Ramses Ill. of the 20th Byte, without any reference to
the previously existing temple of the 18th Dynasty. Though this
temple is beautiful and ﬁnely proportioned in many of its parts, its
architect has displayed no skill in incorporating what already existed
with the new ediﬁce. The erroneous opinion that the temple of
Medlnet Hahn was a royal palace must be most emphatically contra»
dicted. It was no more a palace than was the Ramcsseum or any of
the other buildings in W. Thebes. It was a Memnonium devoted to
ancestorwworship, and its principal part wasintended for the worship
of the mouse of Ramses KL, and to remind posterity of his fame
and his exploits. The temple served also for the celebration of
festivals, including a specially important one for ugh-esp adaqpato
