The next room, almost square, is entirely berm out of the rock,
six square pillars being left in two rows in the centre. The urchin
trove above the pillars contains the customary dedicationwinscrip-
tion. 0n the right we read: "The living HornRa, the strong lord of
both lands beloved by Mo, who rules Egypt and has conquered the
nations, the goldwhawk, rich in years, great in victories, the king
of Upper and Lower Egypt, Ramses 11., has reared in memory of
his father Harmachis the Hot Ramessu meromon in Pa Ra. ‘Pa
Ra’ is thus the holy name of the spot and ‘temple of Ramses Mora—-
mon" the name of the sanctuary. 0n the left architrave Amazon—Ra
is mentioned instead of llarmachis, as lord of the throne of both
lands, so that the temple must be regarded as dedicated to both
deities. On the six pillars are ﬁgures of the king before Tum, Ptah,
Khnum, and other gods. 0n the right side-wall is the boat of Har-
machis borne by 12 priests and conducted by the king, on the left
side-wall. the king, in a boat, offering incense. From this chamber
a large door, surmounted by the winged sun-"disc, leads into the
sanctuary, and doors to the right and left admit to smaller apart-
merits. Four seated ﬁgures occupy the rear—wall of the sanctuary,
viz... (beginning to the left) Ptah, Amman-“Ra, the king, and Har—
maohis with the bank’s head. They are all represented full face,
and would be difﬁcult to identify were it not for the inscriptions
adjoining. ~— Not far from the temple is a small rock-stale, dediw
rated to the king’s son Amcncmhcb, with the ﬁgure of a temple.

Beyond Dorr the Nile valley again turns to the S.W. To the
right is the island of Tennis. Crocodiles now become more numer-
ous, looking from a distance like treeutrunlrs or like huge frogs. A
nearer view is only to be obtained by rowing on ahead of the dhaha—
biyeh in the felulreh or small boat. At Ellcsiyeh (E. bank), also
called cd-Dukncsroh, is a rock—tomb of the 18th Dynasty. On a stale
here, dating from the 43rd year of Tutmes Hi, the king presents

oﬁ‘ermgs to Home, lord of Mom 2 5% , and to San, mistress of

Abu. The wallvpaintings represent the king seated between Muth
and Una; then offering to Horus, lord of the land of Khent, to Horus
of Mam, and to Thoth and llathor.

0n the W. bank, opposite Keitch, we next see an ancient ruined
fort. Then to the right is the verdant island of Abra Eds, and to
the left the village of -—--

13 M. lbrim. To the E. rises a considerable chain of hills, and to
the W. (left) is a narrow strip of palms and .castorwoil plants, beyond
which is the desert. 0n the W. bank, a little inland from the village
"of Anibeh, and hidden behind a palmw—grove, lies an interesting
