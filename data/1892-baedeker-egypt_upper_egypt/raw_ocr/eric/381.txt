Horns) as at Denderah (p. 80) and Philm. Four columns are also
left on each side, united by means of a building between them,
which has a semi-sported on the W. side, farthest from the Nile.
The capitals of the side-columns resemble those of the front com
lumns of the hypmthral temple on Philm. They are lotnswoalyn
capitals, framed at the top with leaves springing from buds, while
beneath are the usual ﬁve annuli or rings. Only a single crosses
beam new rests upon the beams running lengthwise in this little
temple, which cannot have been more than sheet 25 ft. square.

About 10 min. to the S. is a double girdle-wall of large hewn
stones, stretching to the Nile, and furnished with a gateway. A
ﬂight of steps leads down to the river. The pylenwlike gateway
appears to have been faced by another of the same kind. The wall
has been taken for the remains of a Roman permanent camp. An
ancient road leads thence to the S.W. to some :; Quarries,
which contain about 60 Greek retire inscriptions (and one demons)
dating from the Roman imperial epoch (Septimins Severus, Cara»
calls to Gordian). There are also two busts and a carefully con-
structed. niche, with the winged. sun-disc above it, apparently in»
tended to hold a status. The inscriptions have been carved Mostly
by priests of the Games (lapses 16pm, also dpxlepeoq, .9;
etc.), a word which Frans explains (Corp. lnsorip. Grace. 111,461? -
to mean the carriage of stones under priestly management from the
quarries for the purpose of building temples.

At all events in the inscription to the left of the had of the bust
(in Lepsies 373) a priest of the Gemos, named Gratis, son. of Praetorian,
records that he had dos etched 110 stones for the work of late of Miles,

out o W. side). Considerable sums were paid for the privilege of holding
this robably lucrative ofﬁce. Eight tablets (the four earlier beside the
left not, the four later beside the right best) record that a certain Gates
Dioramas (Julius) Hacienda, who is probably represented by both the
beats, held this office eight times, for which ﬁrst and last be expended
no less than 300 pieces of gold (ypesoda), equal to about 2751. in modern
currency. The years of his ofﬁce are given: the 18th and mud. years (of
Septimins Severus and his coeregent Caraoalla), the 2nd of Heliogabalns
