granite sanctuary (p. 134) are a few half—ruined chambers forming
a kind. of annexe to the S. wall of the temple, and partly constructed
of alabaster , a substance rarely used for building. The ruins
nearest the lake date from the reign of Tutmes 111., these imme-
diately adjoining the templewwall from the reign of the Ethiopian
Taharka. ‘A, square apartment, decoratod'with paintings of which
the colours are still vivid, displays some curious deities, probably
Ethiopian, but only the upper parts of the paintings are now visible.

We now return to the doorway opening to the 8., between the
third and fourth pylons (p. 132), upon which is the cartouehe of

Ramses IX. 0 I Ll Ra nsfcr kn. To the S.W. of this point, in an

irregular line and at varying distances from each other, are Pylons
VIII, IX, X, and XI. Fromthe last of these an avenue of sphinres
(new concealed by a small wood) stretches to the temple of Mirth.
Pylon X1 is turned towards this avenue, but the pylons X, IX, and
VIII, succeeding each other towards'the N., gradually sheet the
transition to the great temple of Ammon by their position and. the
angle they stand at with reference to the S. wall of the great temple;
for, as will be seen from the Plan, none of them is exactly parallel
with that wall. The four pylons are connected with each other by
side-walls running at irregular angles, and thus enclosing four
courts, which, however, are no longer clearly defined owing to gaps
in the walls. Through these four gateways passed the ancient pro-
cessional route, which began at the temple of Math, in which were
the statues of Sekhet (p. 148), and ended at the temple of Ammon
in the space with the two obelishs (p. 132), which may be regarded
as the vestibule of the sanctuary. ‘

The series of four Courts between the pylons, which we now
visit, had an aggregate length of 310 yds. (not reckoning the Sphinx-
avenue). It was begun in the early times of the 18th Dyn. (Tut-w
runs 1.), and was afterwards several times enlarged and adorned.
Beginning at the gateway of Ramses 1X. (see above), we have on
our right the fragment of wall (probably dating from Soil 1.) on
the W. side of which is the famous treaty (p. 142), and. on the
left the wall running to meet Pylon "VIII, and probably dating like
that pylon from Tutmes Ill. 0n the front of this latter wall king
Merenptah, son of Ramses 11., caused an inscription of great inter--

est to be carved. .

From this we learn that the king Victoriously opposed the Libyans
and their allies, the islanders of the Mediterranean, whose later expeditions
against Egypt are recorded in the inscriptions at Eadinet Hahn. (p. 17?).
“Under his father the Egyptians had advanced into Asia; new, the peeples
to the W. and N. of the Nile valley, the Libyans and Kenyans, and with
them Lyciens, Sardiniens, Sicilians, nchwans, and a tribe named Pulesta
(more probably Philiatinea than Pelasgians) dare to invade the Delta and
to dwell there like previous hings‘ (to. probably the Hyksos). ﬁerenptah
assembles an army, and encouraged by a dream, defeats the allies. The
