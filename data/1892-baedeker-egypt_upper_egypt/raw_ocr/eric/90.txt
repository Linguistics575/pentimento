remains of the ancient city, of the lake. and the desert. Each gate of this
curious building is surmounted by a winged disc of the sun; and over
the doors leading into the second and third rooms of the prosekos and
into the sanctuary, instead of the ordinary concave cornice. there is a
series of Urmns snakes, which, with their outstretched heads and. bench
ing necks, together form a kind of cornice. The names of several tray»
cllers- are engraved on the stone of the ﬁrst room, including those of Paul
Lucas, R. Pococke, Jomard, Roux, d‘Anrille Contelle, Bellier, Burton,
Belushi, Hyde, and Paul Martin. user eerie has also been visited by
Lepsius. There are no ancient inscriptions remaining.

To the E. of the large temple are situated two smaller Roman temples,
in tolerable preservation, the larger of which3 situated 300 paces from the
smaller. is not without interest. Its walls (18 it. by 19 ft.) consist of
good burnt bricks, and its substructures of solid stone; the cells ter-
minates in a niche resembling an apse; on each of the side—walls are
two halt-columns, which. as the fragments lying on the ground show,
belong to the Ionic order. There are also some less important ruins
covering an extensive area, but nothing has been found among them
dating from an earlier period than the Roman. The construction of the
walls, the architectural forms, and many coins found here, are Roman;
and none of those small relics of the period of the Pharaohs, which are
usually found so abundantly among the ruins of Egypt. have been dis-
covered here. This was perhaps the site of the ancient Dissector, a town
which probably sprang up on the ruins of a Roman military station,
situated on the extreme western side of Egypt. 0n the outskirts of the
ruins are walls which perhaps belonged to gardens; there must also have
been once an a ueduct for the purpose of supplying the inhabitants and
their gardens wath water.

From gear Kurds; to Dimeh is one day’s journey. Dimeh is
situated opposite to the point at which we approach the lake from
$enhdr. The scanty ruins on the 8. bank of the lake (Editions;
mama, etc), are not worthy of a visit; but the ruins of Dimeh, al—
though no iuscﬁpﬁons have been found there, present some attrac-
tion. A. street, 400 yds. in length, formerly embellished with ﬁgures
of lions, leads to a platform on which an important temple once
stood. The numerous blocks scattered about here, resembling mill-
stones, and apparently artiﬁcially rounded, are discovered on closer
inspection to be of natural formation. The pared court was surn-
reunded by a. brick wall, and the temple itself contained several
apartments; a peristyle, with columns new in ruins, led to the enu-
trance. Notwithstanding the imperfect state of the ruins, they
sufﬁce to prove, that a town of rery considerable importance, per»

hope the ancient Bacchis, once stood here.
