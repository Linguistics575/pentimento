This tomb originally belonged to an anti—hing Siptah and his
wife Tourer, but it was afterwards appropriated by Scti-Nchht,
father and immediate predecessor of Ramses UL, and suppressor
of a rebellion in his kingdom (p. 172). Whether the tomb also
contained the names of Seti 11., who rests in the adjoining tomb,
is exceedingly doubtful; they are not new visible. The queen Tauser
is more conspicuous in the paintings here than her husband, whence
it has been justly inferred that Siptab founded his claim to the
throne on rights vested in his wife.
