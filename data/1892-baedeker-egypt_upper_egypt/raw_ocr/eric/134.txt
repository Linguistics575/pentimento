night, on the left (NJ the twelve hours of the day, each with their
eponymous divinities

The interior band on the W. side exhibits three designs re—
ferring to the moon which is here represented as 31?- Huza , eye

In the ﬁrst are the 14 days of the waning moon, in the second the
14 days of the waxing moon represented by 14 divinities ascending
a ﬂight of steps, while the Victorious Thoth appears as a ﬁfteenth
divinity beyond the moon-disc. Finally appears Osiris as the moon-
god, seated with Isis and Nephthys in a boat, ﬂoating above the
symbol of the sky m, which is supported by four female forms. ----
In the E. section the interior baud exhibits the course of the sun-
disc through the 12 hours of the day, represented by 1‘2 boats. In
each disc appears the ﬁgure of the divinity to which the particular
hour was sacred.

On the W. side of the hall, between the second and third row
of columns (to the right of the entrance), and on the E side be—
tween the third and fourth row (on the left) are SidcwEntmnces
through which the sacriﬁcial oﬁ‘erings used to be brought into the
hall (com. p. 88)..

Of the three Prosckos Halls which we next enter, by far the
largest is the hexastyle ﬁrst hall, the m-

inscription at the foot of the external wall
gives the measurement of this hall as 26 ells
square, which closely coincides with its actual
size, 451/2 ft. square. On feats}. days the'image
of the mighty sorta-goddess was carried in sow
lemn procession from its place in the holy of '
holies, and was not seen by the multitude as»
rambled in the vestibule until it reached this
ball, when the lofty double doors were thrown
open. Hence probably the name of the hall.

It is a remarkable fact that except in the
Khent Hall, the secret passages, and Room xx
(p. 88), the cartouches of the kings in all
the interior rooms of the temple remain
empty. In Room an the accompanying royal
cartouches are found: ‘Lord of the rulers?
chosen by Ptah’, and ‘Kaisaros, ever—diving,
beloved by Ptah and Isis’. The latter, which
is also found on the exterior W wall of the "
temple, probably refers to Augustus, though the same designation
was also used for Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. 0n the E enter-
