in all. They exhibit the royal builder of the laboratory worshipping
before Esther, Isis, Esther with the Home ofEdm, and Isis with He-
res Samteni In two of the designs the king is accompanied by one of
the lords of the laboratory, once with the divine Master of Anointing

El Monet, once with Home, the lord ofthc labou

rotary an , in the other two, by a goddess and two ram’ s-

 

headed divinities, who also stand in some relation to the work of the
laboratory. Both the king and. his companions oﬁer some of the
costly perfumes oi the laboratory to the gods above named.

The room next the laboratory (Pl arm.) is named in the inscripu

tions here found simply

 

Saki, which means ‘assembly-

room’, ‘room’, ‘hall’, ‘apartment’. An indication as to its former use
is aﬁorded by the representations on the walls, which depict the
king adoring the ﬁrst fruits of the ﬁelds, plants, ﬂowers, and fruits,

from whom everything comes that heaven bestows or the earth
brings forth’. From these representations and inscriptions it may

served all things, and that the od’erings intended for Hathor were
placed here on her foetal day.

temple, which opened into this room (comp. p. 89, Room xm, on
the opposite side). From the inscriptions we learn that it was used
for the reception of the oﬂ’erings which were brought into the
temple by the side-entrance It has been mentioned above (p

85) that in a representation in this room (beside the door of exit)
the royal cartonches above the monarch worshipping Hathor have
been ﬁlled in with the ofﬁcial name of Augustus, whereas elsewhere
the cartonches are left vacant.

On the opposite (W0 side of the hell are the side~cbambers
m, m1, and arm. The last two appear from their representations
and inscriptions to have been used for precisely the some purposes
as the corresponding chambers on the E. side. The ﬁrst (Pl. m),
however, to the right of the entrance, is shown by its adornment
