The pictures on the E. wall (entrance-wall) of this hall resemble
those in the great temple; to the left, the king, before Horus who
hands him the sword of victory, seizes an overthrown Tehennu (N
tribesman) {by the hair to slay him; to the right standing before
Amman, he clays a negro. The legends are almost word for word. the
same as those on the architravo. But in both the pictures in this

and two fans. The king stands outside the temple, adoring ﬂowers.

To the N. of the small temple and. still on the smoothed part of
the cliﬁ‘, we observe a tablet on which a prince of Ruth, Ani by
name, a man of Khinensu, appears with the fan and. pﬂncely stud
