comp. p 34) The RAILWAY from Medinet eleayﬁrn via Scam and
Abu Goneheh to (15M) Abraham (see below) and thence to Sen-:-
hair and (71/2 M.) Ttrsoh is used almost exclusively for the con-
veyance of sugar-«cane to the manufacturies of the Khedive. Trava-
ellers going by railway (one train daily from Modineh‘to Abuksa,
starting about noon, and performing the journey in about 5. hr.)
must take horses with them for the continuation of their journey.
The following routes are all practicable, but the third is to be
preferred: —---

(1) We proceed by land via Nesleh (where 13an must be ordered
for the passage of the lake) to Kerr Kordn; then by water to
Dimch, and again by water to the '8 bank of the lake, situated 1n
the latitude of Seeker, which lies about 4 M. inland. The horses
should be sent on from Kasr Kurds); to the lake (unless the some-u
what refractory guides refuse to obey), in order that we may ride
to Senhdr, and thence to Medinet elm-Fayiim. Four or ﬁve days are
required for the excursion; the points of interest are mentioned in
the third route The road from Nezleh (see below) to East Karim
(4 hrs. )leads through the desert, past the remains of a small temple,
called by the Arabs {fogs ethendt, or ‘Maidens’ Castle’.

(2) if the traveller renounces Dimeh and liner Kurdn, and is
satisfied with the sport to be obtained in the Baht el-dei, he may
easily make the excursion in 21/2-3 days. 011 the ﬁrst day the route
skirts the railway (see above) to (2 hrs.) darted; it then leads
through a plantation of opuntia, the growth of which is so gigantic
that it almost resembles a forest, and across a sandy tract overgrown
with tamarisks to (2 hrs.) Am“, situated on a hill, and comm
mending a ﬁne survey of the lake and the Libyan mountains. At
the N. base of the hill near the railway station (see above) is a sugar
manufactory, superintended by a Frenchman, who accords a kind reu-
oeption to travellers. We now proceed to the S.W. across meadows,
and through a somewhat marshy district, to (21/2 hrs.) Abolish, sita-
uated close to Nealch. (The traveller is recommended to spend the
night in a tent rather than among the Beduins.) Next day we fol-
low the valley of the Bohr ct» Wadi (or Bohr Nested), which is
bounded by large mud-hills, to the lake (21,’2hrs.), where we spend
the middle of the day. (The numerous dead ﬁsh on the bank of the
lake render its proximity unpleasant; boats are to be had from the
Beduins.) In the evening we return to Absheh, and on the third
day to Medinet el-Faydm.

(3) Four days at least are required for the somewhat longer
route via Senhdr and the lake to hear-Kurds, if the traveller wishes
to visit Dimeh, and shoot on the lake. The route ﬁrst skirts the
