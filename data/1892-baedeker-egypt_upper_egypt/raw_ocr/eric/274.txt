This tomb was named by the French Expedition Lo. Tombs dc to
Métcmpsychosc, and by British scholars, following the groundless
traditions of the Romans, the Tomb of Momma. This large tomb
is characterized by an abundance of mystic representations and in-
scriptions, of which, however, none are executed in a good style.
Coptic and Greek inscriptions are most numerous in this tomb;
among them one to the aﬂoat that ‘Hermogenes of Amasa has seen
and admired the Syringes, but this tomb of Memnon, after he had
examined it, he more than admired’ (or admired more than the others,
uuspcdouncou). —-~ It is a remarkable fact that the cartouches of
Ramses VI. are superimposed upon others, which either represent the
earlier name of Ramses VL, or probably of his predecessor Ramses V.

Before the doors are representations like those before No. 8. -
- I. To the right is the king before Harmachis, to the left, before Osiris,
then the serpent Apcp, demons with heads of bulls and serpents,
chained captives, etc. m H. Representation like those in Room v. of

men with a guide. Above re a boat, out of which an ape is dravrng mprg ,
