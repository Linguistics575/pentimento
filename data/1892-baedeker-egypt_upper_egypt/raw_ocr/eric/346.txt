them their native rock, this ﬁnal operation being probably accoma
plished with the aid of wet wedges. Such an Obelisk, still attached
to the rock, may be seen about 1/2 M. to the S. of the town and
about as far to the E. of the Nile. it is not easily found, as it is
frequently more than ham-covered with sand. At its broadest part
this obelisk measures 103/2 ft; its length is 92 ft. (72 ft. out out),
not reckoning the pyramidal top, which has already been hewn. The
economy of material on. the part of the stonencutters is noteworthy.
In the quarry near the road and visited by all travellers, is a huge
Block of Rock, from which the mason has begun to how both a
rooﬁng-slab and a column. Here we clearly perceive that the ancients
well understood how to disintegrate the granite with borers and to
split it with wedges. Numerous holes were made in a ﬁxed line
(probably with the help of drawmhoring), the damp wooden wedges
were driven in, and in this manner tolerably even fractures were ob»

tained. The art of splitting the stone by heat was also understood.

The Chapel transported from Elephsutine (he. herein) to Sets by
Aahmes (26th Dyn.) was especially celebrated, and is mentioned by Item-
dotus (II, 175). It consisted of a single block and its trans ort occupied
M0 men for 3 years. It is said to have been 21 ells long, 4 bread, and
8 high, outside measurement; and 18% oils long, 12 broad, and 5 high,
inside measurement. It had to remain outside the temple at Sale, on
account of its size and weight. Still more striking, in point of weight at
least, were the States of Romeo H. transported hence to the Ramesseum
(p. 162), and a stone Chapel, seen by Herodotus (I, 155) at Rate. The
latter was cubical in form and measured 40 ells each way; and it has
been estimated that its weight must have been about 7000 shippingatons,
or more than twice the burden. of a large East Indiaman.

We turn to the right (W) from the quarries and follow the broad
sandy road loading 8.. to Philm. The desert has a wonderml pro-
serving virtue. If the road along which the traveller now rides were
practicable for carriages, Strabo’s description would still ﬁt it in
every point. ‘We droye’, writes the ancient geographer, ‘from Syene
(Assuhn) to Philm, through a very ﬂat plain about 50 stadia long.
At many points all along the road, and on both sides, we saw the
rounded, smooth, and almost conical blocks of dark, hard rock, re-
sembling Hermes—towers, from which mortars are made. Smaller
blocks lie upon larger ones, and support others in their turn; here
and there were isolated blocks’, etc. --— To this we need only add
that pious pilgrims and. wayfarers have chiselled their Names and
short Inscriptions on many of the abovenmentioned blocks. Princes,
digniﬁed priests, and warriors, have travelled this way, as far back
as the times of the Amenemhas and Usertesens. Down to a late
period pilgrims were in the habit of placing inscriptions on these
stones, accompanied with the representation of the soles of the feet.

Among the more noteworthy of these Inscriptions are a short one of

the fourth year of Usertesen l. (.
