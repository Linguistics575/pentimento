touche, like that of a queen; ‘may she protect King Euergetos‘. On
the front of the two columns are not only the names of the founders
of the presses, but also those of their ancestors, the divine Adolphi,
Eucrgetm‘, Philopatores, Epiphanes, and the divine Philometor;
while one of them is dedicated to the memory of Thoth of Pe-
