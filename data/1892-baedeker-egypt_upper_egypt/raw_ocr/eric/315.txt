the complete rebuilding of the temple at Edt‘u was accomplished within
the period of 180 years, 3 months, and 14 days.

As a kind of pendant or companion-piece to this long historical“
inscription of the W. girdle-well, there appears another no less inn
teresting Inscription at the foot of the E. Girdle Walt (Pl. k). This
second inscription, which has a total length of 240 ancient Egyptian
ails, contains a summary account of the whole temple, followed by
a detailed description of each of its rooms. Like all dedicatory inw-
scriptions of the kind, it begins with the name of the monarch
under whom the monument it refers to (in the present case, the
girdle-wall) was completed.

The inscription begins as follows: ‘The golden Horns, who shows
himself in heaven as the wingvspreeding god of Edfu, clad in bright
plumage, he has taken possession of his abode . . . prepared by . . . Pto-
lemy XI. Alexander I.‘

‘This beautiful large wall, behind his temple at the side of his father‘s
building, its length 240 ells, its breadth 90 cite, its height to the summit
20, the thickness of its foundation bells. This monument, which was
erected by His Majesty and his father, is formed like the son-mountain
of heaven.‘ These dimensions correspond with measurements made by
the writer. The length of the girdle-wall to the pylons was found to be
dial/2 i‘t., which reckoning the ancient Egyptian ell at 13/4 ft., is equal to
240.53 ells; breadth 1333/4 it. 2: 89.12 oils; height 331/2 ft. m 19.5 ells; thick:-
ness Ell/s ft, to. not quite 4 (instead of 5) oils.

_We may now bestow a glance on the general arrangement of the
temple as a whole. The main axis lies W. and 8., as is repeatedly
mentioned in the inscriptions referring to this point

"I'I'f: 25;.-

a

Bear (the N. 'constellation)’. The early Egyptian architects seem to
have been guided by these two constellations in determining the
orientation of any new temple, as appears to be indicated with some
certainty by inscriptions at Edfu. The laying of the foundatioun
stone of an early Egyptian temple was a ceremony of peculiar solemw
nity, in which the king himself, as has been observed in the ac-
count of Dendersh (p. 86), took part; and even in the case of
temples built at a time when the rulers of Egypt had ceased to
share personally in these ceremonies as eg. under the Roman emu
perors who did not live in Egypt at all , the inscriptions still some-
times speak. in the emu-fashioned style as though the monarch had
duly performed his part. do inscription along the foot of the wall
in Hall D states that ‘His Majesty in his proper person, with his
hand on the wooden peg and holding the line in his graSp, along
with the goddess Saiekh, is to be found beside his measuring—inu-
strnment to determine the four corners of the temple at Edi‘u’. This
N. and S. axis divides the entire building into a right and a left
(or W. and it.) half, reckoned from Room I (p. 252), which occupies
the exact centre of the rearnwall of the temple, and is named in
the inscriptions ‘dividcr of the middle". All the walls and rooms
to the right of this line (as we look S.) are described in the inscrip-
