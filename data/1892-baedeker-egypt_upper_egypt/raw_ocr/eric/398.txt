TEMPLE or sneﬁnn. 32. Route. 323

few without heads lie behind. Beside the two ﬁrst are two colossal
statues of Ramses IL, 101/2 ft. high, placed against pillars, hearing
the cartouches of the king, ‘heloved of Harmachis and. Ptah’ on the
right, and. ‘heloved of Amman-Ba and Ptah’, on the left. The king’s
name appears on the girdles of both ﬁgures and on the chests
of the sphinxes. Statues of the king, probably four in number (new
destroyed), also steed in front of the pylon, which is 32 ft. high
and 42 ft. broad. 0n the back of one of these statues it is recorded
that the king erected this noble pillar in I’d-Amen (apparently the
holy name of the temple) in memory of his father Ammondla and
adorned it with. costly gems. 0n the outside of the pylon, as in
various other Egyptian temples, are two colossal ﬁgures, which,
however, are difﬁcult to identify owing to the weatherworn state
of the sandstone, of which the temple is built. On the right the
king holds eight fees by the hair, menacing them with his weapon
while they raise their hands in supplicetion: ‘he smites the great
ones of all lands’. The god Harmachis hands him the sword of
victory. To the left is a similar scene, in presence of Amman—Ra,
who promises to the king victory over all alien lands. The large
fore-court, which we now enter, is 65 ft. square. The interior ”is
very interesting. To the right and left are corridors, each with 5
Osirisnpillars supporting an architrave. 0n the left (SJ side the
roof of slabs is still extent, but on the N. side it is wanting, so that
the driftvsand has found entrance and now covers a considerable
portion of the court. At the tsp of the back of the pylon occur the
varying cartouches of Ramses 11., and beneath the cornice his name
occurs again, in anaglyphic characters. On the left (8.) wing of the
pylon, the king presents a sphinx to Amman-Elia and Math, to the
right he offers bread to Harmachis and Jesse. Round the court in
the row nearest the ground appears a procession of the children of

the king, each with the name appended, the sons bearing fans g,

 

the daughters hearing sistra There are two series, both be-
ginning on the W. or backuwall of the court and. running respectively
to the right and left from the W. entrance to the main temple. 0n
the W. wall, to the right of the templeadoor, are 19 men (mostly
concealed by the sand), on the N. wall 40 men and. 8 women, and
on the E. wall, to the N. of the entrance to the court 27 women,
he. in this series 59 sons and 35 daughters. On the W. wall to the
left of the temple-door are 19 men and. 20 women, on the S. wall
33 men and 12 women, he. 52 sons and 352. daughters. If the
names are not repeated, as at Medinet Habu, Ahydos, etc., 111
sons and 67 daughters are thus attributed to Ramses the Great.
