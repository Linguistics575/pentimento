the roof extends the double body of Nut, apparently supported on the
left by She. The visitor should observe the constellations on the body
of the goddess of the sky, the demons of the constellations, the three
crocodiles (one sitting on the back of another) and, farther down, the tables
of the hours. The goddesses of the hours have distorted (too broad) faces.
The roof is vaulted. The sarcophagus is 10 ft. long, 6 it. broad and
"We ft. high, and is adorned with redpresentations. In the next corridor
are inscriptions: ‘0 ye gods of the .eep’, and ‘Doorkeepcrs of the tomb",
etc. Then follows a representation of the boat of Khnnm above the double
lion. To the left of the praying king are the words ‘hiay the coming in and
the going out be blessed”, recalling a similar Christian wish. In the room

behind is a representation of the mummy of the king , repeated 17

who has four rams" heads, to the sunwgod, and to Mersekhet. In the
last chamber is a wide and deep shaft, in which perhaps cofﬁns still are
to be found though probably already plundered by the felldhin. In the
Second Corridor, as in many other tombs, above ground, are niches
sunk in the rock, and generally bearing a long series of gods or demons.
They served probably as depositories for vessels, canopi, etc.
