on the second doorway, about 50 ft. farther back, appears the
winged sunmdiso. The second pylon shows a much damaged Greek
inscription of Ptolemy Philometor and his consort. in a straight
line, ‘24 ft. farther, is a third pylon; and 42 ft. beyond that is the
small. temple proper {65 ft. deep and 40 it. bread), with a side—-

columns, was thrown down in 1868 by earthquake, which also

tcta mar est. This At khcmmon, like the Ergumcncs occurring at
Dahheh (p 316), was one of the dynasty of native kings who
reigned in. Nubia during the period of the Ptolemies and the Roman
emperors. On each of the sides (right and left) of this apartment
are eight scenes in two rows one above the other, representing King
At’kheramon making oﬁ‘erings to the gods of the place, Osiris, Isis,
and Horns, and to the gods of the region of the cataracts. The
sanctuary behind contains a granite naos, broken in two, dating
from Eucrgetes H. Physkon and Sleepatra.

A stale of the 12th dyn. (Ranubkau Amenemha 11.), found here
and now in the Berlin museum, proves that Debit must have been a
very early settlement. The Roman Parcmbole (fortiﬁed camp; p. 292)
must have been situated in this neighbourhood, for in the Itine-
rarinm Antonini, a list of Roman military stations, the distance
from (Centre) Syene to Parembole is given at 16 Roman miles or
about 12 Eng. miles. As a matter of fact, the remains of an ancient
fortiﬁcation are found near Debdt.

At Dinars" (W. bank) is an ancient wall; and on the E. bank
farther on is the substructure of a temple. The island of Merges
(Markos), neat passed, has some unimportant ruins

To the right (W bank) next appears the (151/9 M ) small temple
of Kertassi, an attractive building, recalling the hypzethral temple
at Philm (p 285). At the entrance, which faces N., only two cow-
lumns are new standing, with the cow-headed Isis and Mother
and a house surmounted by a Urmususerpent (Hat-her house of
