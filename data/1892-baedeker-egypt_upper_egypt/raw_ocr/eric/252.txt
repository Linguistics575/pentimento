Doorway of stone (on the SE), by which we have to pass, leads into
the temple, at the back of which (N) are steep rocks. The sanctuw
ary was founded by Ptolemy 1V. Philopator 1., and sculptures were
added by others of the house of the Lagidse, and later also by the
Emperor Augustus. The traveller on passing through the doorway
in the outer wall sees on his left an archway of Nile bricks, and
before him the front of the temple of freestone, on which many
Greeks and Copts have written their names. In Christian times it
was used by the monks as adwellingnplece, and to this is due the
mutilation of many of the inscriptions and also its present name
(Der w monastery). We ﬁrst come to a small hypmthral Antcchamher
with 2 columns, and a few steps further reach the true Ptolemaic en-w
trance of the Naos. This is ornamented by two pilasters Mth masks
of Hathor, and two columns with sculptured calyXecapitals in the
middle, which support the architreve and are connected by walls re-
sembling screens (reaching halfmway up). Between the pillars is a
semi—portal similar to the one at Medami‘it (p 151). The pilasters are
brightly coloured and peculiarly ornamented, with a lotus ﬂower and
a bud on slender stems at the side. Above are litmus—serpents with the
crowns ofboth kingdoms. 0n the left side is an elegant window which
lights a staircase. The inner portion of the temple is in three parts.
Over the door of the middle room, the. sanctuary, are placed 7 Esther-
masks corresponding to the number of the Hathors. Energetes H.
and his wife are named as beautiﬁers of the temple, and the four
sacred bulls, Hopi, Urmerti, Temur, and Abekur, are portrayed. In
the cell to the right is the king before the serious gods of the lower
world, and also an astronomical painting, Sothis (Sirius) and Orion.
in the room. to the left, on the left wall, is a remarkable represen-
tation of the Judgment of the Dead.

The valley of Der eL-Medineh is rich in Tombs of various periods,
some of them early and of great interest, with the colours of the
paintings marrellously preserved.

Here was discovered the welleknown collection of Papers“, obtained
by A. C. Harris in 18%, containing the famous papyrus of Retirees ill. (see

p. 120), the largest known, from the archives of the temple of Medi-
net Babe.

The earliest tombs here belong to the beginning of the New Era--
pire and to the times of Aahmes I. and Amenhotep I. They bew-
longed to great ofﬁcials, especially to the Sotemms, supreme judge
at the Seat of Truth, possibly a college which met at Der sin-Media
neh. We may mention the small brilliantly coloured chapel of the
royal scribe, Moss-d, the similar one of Khd, the tombs of Amenmes,
Zeskcn, and Amenhotep. in several tombs we ﬁnd numerous frag-
manta of mummies, damaged and ransacked by the fellahin. Cori-
tinuing farther into the valley we reach a tomb with a wide entrance
from which there is a ﬁne View of Ddr el—v-Medineh and of the fertile
plains to the E., traversed by the Nile and bounded by the distant
Arabian mountains. in the foreground are seen Medium Hahn, the
