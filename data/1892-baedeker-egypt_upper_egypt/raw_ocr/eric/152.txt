the goods transported hither on camels, or, at an earlier period, on cases,
as is ex ressly mentioned in the great Harris Papyrus (Ramses 111.,
13% 3.8. . The desertoronte to Eoser unites with that from hunch at eb-
Karn before Lahdtah (p. 75). Koptos early became an em orium for many
kinds of goods. Inscriptions of the dih Dyn. are found by t a side of the old
Mile-route to the Red See at the dei Eamdmdt (p. ‘76). In a tomb at
Benihmn belonging to Ameni, a princely ofﬁcial under the 12th Dyn., is
an inscription recording the treasures brought by Antoni to Keptos in
the train of the crown-prince Usertesen. Koptos was the capital of the
ﬁfth name of Upper Egypt, which bore two hawks on its banner. Its

name appears in hieroglyphics as 6 Kent and 5 axes;

in Coptic it is Kcﬂ and Katie; in Greek carer, Ken-rte, Kc roe, etc. The
Arabic heft corresponds to the Coptic Keft. The deity chic y worshipped
here from a very early period was Khem Min (Vol. 1., p. 1%), whose wife
was called Isis, and son Horns. Osiris also had a burial-place here
(Be nub ‘Gold house‘), in which a part of his body (called hub) was
reserved. The book of magic, the search for which is narrated in the

emetic romance of Setnau, was sunk in the Nile at Koptos. A medical
leather-roll fonnd at Koptos, and now in the British Museum, is said to
have been written in the reign of Khnfn or Cheops (4th Dye.) Koptos
was fortiﬁed as early as the 12th Dynasty° for the wealthy city and eth
routes leading to it required to be defended against the warlike tribes
who lurked between the Nile and the Arabian mountains, and who, even
under the Roman emperors, were a source of danger. Guards were
especially necessary at this point, for there is no doubt that a considerable
number of thnician merchants had settled in Koptos at a very early
data along with the Egyptians, and were engaged. in importing the products
of Arabia, and at a later date even those of India, which were conveyed
rid Arabia to the Egyptian Red Sea ports afterwards called Bercnike and
Leukos Limes, and thence across the desert to the Nile. The green
breccia, need for man buildings even under the Romans, was carried
at ﬁamdmat, on the escrtoronte to Koptos. It is even probe is that
Kebbtown or Knit-town means ‘ lace of the thnicians’, for the Phin—
nicians were named Keft er Knit in Egyptian. Strobe and Pliny expressly
state that the population of the town was mixed, containing both Egyptian
and Arabic (is. Semitic) elements. The hieroglyphic name of the town

 

also occurs with the determinative-sign of the post , which is only used

after the names of foreign places or of places in which foreigners were
conspicuous. The reports of Pletarch, Elias, eta, concerning the strange
cults at Koptos farther indicate that a considerable Semitic community
dwelt in the town, and was regarded with hostility by their Egyptian
neighbours. Elian‘s statement that the inhabitants of Koptos worshipped
the crocodile (Seth) and cruciﬁed the hawk (Horus) can only refer to these
Semites. The true Egyptians revenged themselves by throwing an see
from a rock (as Plutarch narrates), because Typhon (Seth) was red-haired
and of the colour of an ass. Red-haired men (and many red-haired
Semites are represented on the monuments) were des ised, and like all
foreigners were stigmatized as ‘Typhonic‘. Many non- gyptians are com-
incinerated at the sides of the trade-route from the Red Sea to Knptos;
names of Persian kings are nowhere more numerous.

The camp of the Beduins, who hired their camels to the caravans
and escorted them through the desert, must have anciently existed within
the circuit of the town. These Arabs appear to have been the instigators
of a rest insurrection in Upper Egypt, which broke out under Diocletian
in 29% A.D., and led to the siege and’destroction of Koptos. The town
revived somewhat under the Khalifs, but finally decayed with the gradual
transference of the Egyptian trade to the route from page to Keoeha
