with by modern buildings. The
house of Moharb Todrus,‘ the Ger-
man consular agent (p. 102), lies
farther to the N., near the landing-
place, where traces of an ancient
construction may be seen, which
is unfortunately disappearing be-
fore the annual inundations, and
not far from the principal py-
lon. To the left of the main pylon
is the village, with a shop, kept
by a Greek, at which provisions
of all kinds and porter, ale, can-
dles, etc. may be purchased. Far-
ther to the N.E. dwell numerous
ghawazi.

The removal of later buildings
from the *Temple of Luxor has
rendered it easy to reconstruct its
ground-plan (see Opposite), and to
see that its erection was gradual
and more or less aﬂ'ected by the
existence of still earlier'buildinge.
The general main axis of the temple
lies from S.W. to N.E.; but the
axis of the N. portion deviates con-
siderably from the direction of that
of the 8. portion, partly on account

- of the shape of the river-bank,

partly because it was desired to have
the pylons at Luxorjcorrespondlng
to those of Kamak. A careful
examination indeed reveals three
different axial directions. These
deviate from the true meridian, at
an angle of 41' 21" on the 8., and
at an angle of 51° on the N. As
was the custom, the part of the
temple containing the sanctuary
(the S. part) was built ﬁrst, includ-
ing the large peristyle ball. This
took place in the 18th Dyn. under
Amenhotep.III., while the W. per--
tions were added by Ramses II.
From the obelisks to the back of
the sanctuary, the total length of
the temple is 284 yds. Later kings,
