mainland; Rohlf‘s return journey). Sohdg, Girgeh, and Beach are the
preferable starting-points, as they are towns of some site Where the
necessary number of camels is easily obtained. About 40 hrs. are re-
quired from Sohdg or Girgeh; while 50~52 are required from Esneh, bow
cause the road leads chieﬂy over rocky soil, and is therefore more
exhausting for the camels. Camels, water, provisions, i‘lrewarms, etc. must
be provided as mentioned on p. 343.

This oasis was visited by Forrest in 1690, by Browne in 1793, and in
the present century by Cailliaud (1818), Drovetti (1832), Hoskins (1835),
P. W. Grey (1843), Rohlfs, with Zittel, Jordan, Ascherson, and Remele
(18M), and Brugsch (18m). The excellent photographs taken by Remeld
have contributed largely to our knowledge of the temple of el-Khiirgeh.

The oasis of el-Khargeh (the enter, in contrast to llakhileh, the
tuner, is. farther into the desert) is named Kansas in the inscription at
Edie. referring to the cases, while in an older inscription in the tomb

Oasis of the mastoid. The ancient name of the town with the temple was

Like all the oases el-Khdrgeh is surrounded by a tolerably steep
chain of cretacious limestone hills, which rises in terraces to the height
of 1475 it. on the side next the desert, and sinks down again towards
the oasis (Katabathmus, descent). The oasis stretches from N. to S. for
about 90 31.64 hrs. travel), and from E. to W. only 1‘2 M. (4-5 hrs),
and its population was estimated by Schweinfurth at 63:10. The natives
who pay an annual tribute of 300 purses (500 pinstres or 104s. each), or 15603.,
to the Egyptian government, are of a dark complexion and are far from
good looking. Every summer they are subject to an intermittent fever,
which is fatal to many. They speak Arabic though they are not pure
felliihin from the Nile but are mixed with the Libyan race. The oasis is
ruled by an Egyptian governor (Hakim). The chief town st-strgeh has
about 3000 inhabitants. Genoa): and oozes, to the 8., have each about 250,
Bérys 3m, Dash and Hats each 100, according to the moderate estimates
of Cailliaud. «- There are about 150 springs in the oasis, most of them
issuing freely from clefts in the oretaceous marl. Several were discovered
by boring, and in this way the fertility of the oasis was increased. Some
of them are warm (%°-9l° F.) and are strongly impregnated with iron.
The chief wealth of the oasis consists in its date—palms, 65,000 in number.

The town of elvxhargeh lies in let. 25° 58' NZ, and long. 30" 40' E.
of Greenwich, at a height of about 245 ft. above the senders} {Esneh
345 in). The chief object of interest is the temple lying a full hour to
the NE. of the town. Immediately on quitting the brick wall that
encircles the torso, we see on the right the domed tombs of some Arab
shdkhs. Our route leads past some enclosed palm—groves and crosses
some dry wator~coursea The ruins of the small building like a temple,
but destitute oi“ hieroglyphics, which Cailliaud discovered halt-way be-
tween the town and the large temple, seem new to have disappeared, as
has also a still smaller building with a sunk doorway to the S. of the
temple.

The Large Temple of cl-Khiirgeh, 150 it. long and about 60 it. broad,
is a well-preserved structure built of a reddish sandstone, which Zittel
believes to have been quarried in Lower Nubia. its axis runs E. and W...
with a slight inclination to the N. In front of the temple is a forecourt
and three successive gateways at irregular distances. Remains of both
