Two main routes lead to the oasis of Siwah. One, beginning at Alex-
andria, leads to the W. along the Mediterranean coast rid the idealist
esclS‘ooké'r (Katabathmus Parvus) to Medjed near Barman (the ancient Pa-
rwtonium), in 80-90 he’s, travel spread over 10-11 days, and there turning
to the S. reaches Siwah in 5 days or 62 hrs. more. This was Alexander
the Grant‘s route, and was also taken by Browne (see above) in 1792. Or
the traveller may follow the Mediterranean coast for a days more to the
idiabet el-Kebir (Katabathrnus Major) near Bir- elud'or, and. there tnrnin 8.,
reach Siwah in 5 days or 84 hrs. more. This was Minatoli‘s route in 820.
The second main route, starting from Terdneh or from Cairo leads viii.
the Natl-on Convents to Siwah, in about 13 days (Homemann 1,798), while
the ﬁrst mate takes 15-20 days. One route is usually taken for the
journey out, the other for the return. Fr. Callltood reached Siwah in 1819
from the Faydm in 16 days, via Raydn, etherri's, and el-Karuh, but the
hostile natives permitted him. to pay but one visit to the monuments. In
the following year (1820) Mohammad rAll despatched a military force with
artillery, which reduced the hitherto independent Siwah under the anthem
city of the probe of Egypt. Drorsttz’ and Ricct accom noted this espedition.
Gerhard Rohlfs has twice visited the oasis; in 188 on his journey irons
Tripoli to Alexandria; and in Feb. 1874 in the course of an expedition
undertaken along with Jordan, Zittel, and darkened, at the expense of Is—
ma‘il Pasha. This expedition startle from Assidt proceeded rid Fordfmh
and dehel , then struck W. to 2704 , where they turned to the N, reach-
ing Siwah in 14 days. The return was made vii. Farifrah, Dakhel, and
etthdrgeh to the Nile. Unfortunately this costly expedition had not so-
cured the services of an Egyptologist, and even their photographer Ro-
melé was left behind at dehel, so that it has contributed little or nothin
to our knowledge of the inscriptions at Siwah. We have on the other hand
very full information concernin the temples at el—Khdrgeh from. Godhead,
Root. Hay, and H. Bronson (187 a), to which also the photo raphs taken by
M. Remelé at dehel and Khdrgeb have largely added. he inhabitants
of the oasis of Siwah speak a peculiar dialect, of which Minutoli has
communicated dOO words. Herodotus (ll, 42) mentions that the Ammo-
nites are colonists from Egypt and Ethiopia and. speak a dialect midway
between the languages of these lands. They understand a little Arabic,
bat their own speech is a dialect of Tamasirht, a Berber tongue, under.
stood in the Atlas and elsewhere in N. Africa.

The deity worshipped in the temple of the oasis was a ram‘s-headed
and ram‘s-horned Amman, such as appears on some Theban monoments
(an. the N. wall of Medinct Hahn), and also on coins of the Ptolemies.
He was snpoosed to have been identified with Hornshof, who was wor—
