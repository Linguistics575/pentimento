106 ft., in order to form the "imposing rooknfacade of this temple.
At the top we see a row of ‘22 cynocephali (some destroyed),
which we learn from other Egyptian temples to recognize as wor-
shippers of the sum-god. Below these are the oartouohes of the
king, surrounded with litmus—serpents. Then follows the short de-
dication inscription of Ramses the Great, which begins in the
middle and runs in both directions; on the right it styles the king
‘beloved by Harmachis’, on the left ‘beloved by Amman, king of
the gods’. Still lower, in a recess in the centre of the temlrlewwall, is
a full—relief statue of Horus (Harmachis), with the sun on his head.
and. the symbols of life in his hands, while below, to the right, is

the goddess Me, to the left the symbol 1 user, thus expressing the

king’s name in picture-writing. To the right and left is the king
again, presenting ﬁgures which also express his name, and wor-
shipping the god. Below, and somewhat indistinct, are the double
cartouches of the king.

Our attention is most forcibly attracted to the four seated Outcast
(Pl. a, b, o, d), been out of the rock, with their backs against the
slid. That to the left of the entrance (Pl. b) has unfortunately been
violently deprived of its head and arms‘, which new lie on the
ground in front. The colossus on the other side of the door (Pl. c)
was restored by Seti ll. Each of those ﬁgures is not less than 66 ft.
high, their various limbs being in proportion. In spite of the enor-

mous scale the general eﬁ’cct is successful, and the countenances
7 have a pleasant and intelligent expression. All four represent
Ramses the Great, as is testiﬁed by the cartonches on the breast
and arms and between the legs. To the right and left of each are
standing ﬁgures, mostly of women; to the right and left of the enu-
trance, Nofsrtcri Merl-cn-mut, consort of Ramses; between the legs
of the injured colossus, prince Amhihhopcshf (‘Ammon in his
sword’), who is introduced in the temple of Don: as the oldest son
(senses) of Ramses 11.; to the left of this colossus Toe, the king’s
mother. Beside the colossus farthest to the left are two daughters
of the king, "viz. Ncbtwtatl, on the left, and Bassinets on the right;
between the legs is an unnamed female ﬁgure. The ﬁgures at the
sides of the colossus to the extreme right, the names of which are
concealed by the sand, probably correspond to these. In 1817 Balm
zoni spent :14 days in freeing the temple from the sand that had
drifted into it from the desert behind. Burokhardt, however, had
mentioned it previously. It was again laid bars by Lepsins in 1844
and by Mariette in 1869, but the sand has already covered great
part of it to a considerable depth.

Before we enter the temple our attention is claimed by a Greek irr-
scription which is found on the left is of the injured. colossus, along wrth
various other Greek, Caries} , and hmnioian insoriptionsw It rups as
