Fowlingupieeea and ammunition (including Lefaueheux cartridges) may
he bought in Cairo, but not higher_up, where only coarse gnu-powder can
he obtained.

Letters. The letter~post, even in Upper Egypt, is both rapid and
punctual. From Cairo to Thebes letters take three days, being forwarded
to death; by rail and thence by steamer. Passengers going beyond Cairo
should instruct the porter of the hotel to forward letters to some ﬁxed
point. Cook‘s manager does this for Cook’s tourists. The post goes on
even beyond Assudn.

N. Works on Egypt.

A good selection of books is one of the necessities of the traveller
in Egypt. The steamer sometimes steams for an entire day without pass-
ing anything of special interest; and the dhahahiyehwtrayeller, when his
vessel is being slowly towed against an adverse wind, will gladly fall bash
upon reading when he is tired. of walking along the bank with a gun on
the ohanee of a shot. A eonsiderahle number of the thief books upon
Egypt have been mentioned. in Vol. 1., meanest, a few more are named
here; while other special works are referred to in the desert tions of some
of the principal monuments (awpﬁdﬂﬁﬂihﬂ, etc.). or authorities
on the Western Gases see pp. , 3&8.
