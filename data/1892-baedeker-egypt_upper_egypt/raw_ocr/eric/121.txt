the Roman town and colony of Hydraulics or Fons Moons, which lies
in the latitude of use, about 3 days‘ journey from lieneh. Outside the
walls lie a temple and other buildings, and some large columns and Greek
inscriptions have been found in the quarries, which were worked chieﬂy
in the time of Hadrian and Trains. About two days‘ journey farther to
the N. is Gebcl Damn (‘smoke mountain‘), the ancient porphyry quarries
of which were worked by the Romans. Here are the ruins of an Ionic
temple of the time of Trajan (never completed), some remains of an irre-
gularly built town, and two large water-reservoirs. The old route led
hence to Myer Harness, the harbour of which has been silted up and is
now practically useless. Travellers making for the Sinai Peninsula jour~
ncy to the N. from the porphyry quarries for two or three days more.
and sense by boat to The (sec Bocdctcr‘s Lower Egypt, p. 515). Those
who undertake one of these journeys should study the ‘Reisehriel‘e‘ of
Lepsius and Wilkinson‘s well-known work.

A much more interesting journey than that to (label anhdn is the
trip to ginger, or at least to dei gonad-met, where there are numerous
Egyptian inscriptions. For the journey (there and back) ill-ll days should
be allowed, and Egyptologists will probably want 2‘3 days more. It is
generally undertaken from lieneh, but we may also choose the old route
from daft (Koptos, p. 98), or we may start from Loner. The ﬁrst two
routes unite at cl-garn and are joined at hoisted by that from Loner.
The necessary camels may be obtained in lioneh with the aid of one of the
consular agents (comp. p. 72). The route from hunch (telegraph—wires from
Eds to ﬁnger) leads ﬁrst through the villages of Shed}: Rekdb, Bowls, and
Kara ‘Imrdn, which follow each other in quick succession the ﬁrst on the
left, the other two on the right side of the road. 'i‘he ﬁrst night is
generally spent at the caravanserai of Blr 'hrnhar, about 31/2 hrs. from
lichen, where the lofty palms and shady sycamores and mimosa od‘cr a
most inviting haltingplace. The large caravanserai was erected at the
expense of an Ibrahim Pasha for the use of the liosér caravans and the
Mecca pilgrims. The structure comprises several separate buildings.
covered with dome-shaped roofs and surrounded by courts and colon-
nades. It has no owner and is free to everyone to use as he likes. do
nothing is done to keep it in repair, it is rapidly falling into decay, like
most of the Oriental buildings of the kind, and threatens soon to be a
complete ruin. In the deserts of Upper Egypt the temperature at night
is so mild, even in winter. that strong and. healthy persons may safely
sleep in the open air if warmly wrapped up; and for various reasons this
is preferable to a night in the caravanserai. Those, however, who prefer
to take their chances in the interior should not fail to make the most
minute examination of the room in which they intend to sleep, in order
to clear out the vermin with which it is almost certain to be infected;
scorpions and venomous snakes are by no means uncommon visitants.

It is the duty of the Khobtr, or guide in charge of the caravan, to see
that everyone and everything are ready betimes in the morning, so that
a sufﬁciently early start may be made to cover the ground allotted to
each day‘s march. He is held responsible for the safe conduct of the
entire party, and expects implicit obedience to his marching orders. We
soon turn our backs on the verdant green district bordering the Nile
and enter the barren desert, almost entirely destitute of vegetation, which
lies between the great river and the coast of the Red Sea. The ﬁrst part
of the route is very uncdii‘ying. We advance steadily, ascending almost
imperceptibly, through a monotonous plain, intersected in all directions
by small undulating heights. All around us extends the interminable
yellowish gray. sun-bleached rocks of the desert; not a trace of
life is visible, not a single green tree or shrub. At the hill of

between Bic mm:- and Lotétoh, the road from Keneh is joined by that

was the starting-point of the road constructed by the ancient Egyptians
for the trafﬁc between the Thcbai'd and the Red Sea. From this point
onwards we therefore follow one of the Hindi, aneigoiitatnhdigg routes
