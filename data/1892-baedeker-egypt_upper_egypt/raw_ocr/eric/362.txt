loser VH. Philometor, and most of its decorations were due to Pto-
lemy IX. Eusrgetos 11., though the later Lagida and Tiberius also
contributed a share. '

The vestibule here is lefties than the other resins of the cells. The
entrance was adormd by Philometor, but the numerous interior reliefs
represent Tiberius before the diﬁ‘ercnt deities of the tem to. The carefully
elaborated doorway at the back of the presses dates rem Eusrgetes II.
The ﬁrst room is quite unadorned. Above the deer to the second room
is a window, bordered on. each side by two Rather-masks. Tiberius is
named several times en die walls, which have been partly plastered over
with mud. The early Christians, who perhaps used the second room for
purposes connected with their services, have entirely plastered over the
heathen Inscriptions there; while the highly interesting Representations in
the third room have been left quite untouched. From. these we learn that
the temple was intended to represent the Birth-House or Meshes, in
which the infant ngos first saw the light (similar buildings at Denderah,
Edfu, etc, pp. 80, 53). The reliefs on the rear wall are in. two sections.
The lower series represents the Birth of Horus, who is introduced into
life by Amman, Thoth, and other gods. In the u per row we see Horus
ascending from a huge bunch of lotusrﬂowers, an beside him the serpent
coiling round a column adorned with lotus~ﬂowers, beneath which kneel
two forms, covered with the Urbano—hood. The allegorical meaning of
this letter composition is obscure. 0n the W. wall of the chamber is
a Goddess (head destroyed), offering the breast to the new-born child, and
close by is Rather, the good fairy of Egyptian nurseries, placing her
left hand. in benediction on the head of Horns, and holding his arm
with her right. King Ptolemy IX. Eusrgetes II. is depicted heading
to her two metalemirrors ‘to rejoice the golden one with the sight of her
beautiful form“. ...... These representations do not only celebrate the mystic
birth of the god, they refer also to the most beautiful and most responsible
duties of motherhood, which Isis, Esther, and Nephthys undertake. Their
nurslin appears indeed to be the infant Horus, but it is evident from
many a lesions, that the young Pharaoh, the heir to the throne of Ra,
was considered as the incarnation in human form of the young god, and
that these representations were meant to convey to the Ptolemies that a deity
had. home and suckled them or. their ﬁrst~born, and that the immortals
had guided their upbringing with invisible hands. Cleopatra 1., the mother
of the two brothers who caused the placing of this inscription, had acted
as guardian and regent especially during the childhood of Philemetor, the
elder. She was the leis of the young Horus. On the E. outside wall of
the cells a relief shows us Home learning from the goddess of the IN.
to play on the 'nine~stringed lute, while Isis superintends the lesson. The
shape of the instrument is Greek, and by the goddess of the north is
perhaps meant Hellenic music, which was cultivated even by the earlier
Lagidse. ‘ '

All the Inscriptions here date from Tiberius, who is named ‘Autokrator
Kisres" on the E. side and ‘Tiberius‘ on the W. side. A double votive-n
inscription of the same date proves that the former phrase applies to
Tiberius. .. H "

The columns of the Colonnades on the W. and N. sides of the
cells exhibit genuine Ptolemaie capitals With a very high abacus.
On the N; side (Pl. 1’) is the peculiar but elegant capital, found
only on Philn, consisting of a bunch of papyrus-buds, supporting
the absent on their tips. Screen-walls, more than half as high as
