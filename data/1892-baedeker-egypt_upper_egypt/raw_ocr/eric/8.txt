PREFACE.

Way-ug-

The present volume forms the second part of the Edi-
tor’s Handbook for Egypt, the ﬁrst part of which has reached
a second edition in “1885. _

The materials upon which this Handbook to Upper Egypt
is chieﬂy founded were contributed principally by Professor
Georg Ebert of Leipsic, and Prob/base? Johannes Dﬁmichen 0f
Strassbur , and their work, w ich was mainl ﬁnished in
1877, hasixeen revised, augmented, and broug t up to date
in all practical details by Professor August Easenlohr of
Heidelber , who has twice visited E ypt for this express
pur use. 0 Prof. Ebers the editor is in ebted for the account
of t e Nile~voyage as far as and including Philse; Prof. Diiw
michen contributed the descriptions of the temples of Den:-
derah and Edfu. of the town of Keneh, and of the caravan-
routes thence via the quarries of ﬂamamat to Koser on the
Red Sea; while the routes in Lower Nubia and to the Western
Gases are wholly from the pen of Prof. Eisenlohr.

The practical introduction to the ﬁrst volume, and the
sections on the geography, history, and art of Egypt, there
pjublished, apply of course also to the districts of Upper

gypt. The special introduction to the present volume deals
chieﬂy with the Nile voyage and the necessary preparations
for it, preceded by a brief survey of the chief steamerwroutes
between Egypt and Europe and a note on the new E. ’
monetary system, introduced since the publication 0151' the
Handbook to Lower Egypt. A. list of works on Egypt is
added, and, to obviate the necessity of too frequent rem
foresees to the ﬁrst volume , also a chronological 11st of the
rulers of Egypt down to the close of the Ptolemaic period,
and a selection from the royal cartouches of most frequent
occurrence in Upper Egypt. Finally the Arabic Alphabet
is given, showing the system of transliteration adopted in
this Handbook.

The MAPS and PLANS have been an object of especial
care. The former are based upon the large maps of Kiepert,
Lepsias, and Linant; the latter chieﬂy upon the plans of
Lamina, though with the necessary additions and corrections.
while some have been specially prepared by ProfEisenlohr
