is rendered difﬁcult by the accumulations of sand. The ﬁrst room
contained six large and six small pillars, the former being meant
tosupport the central beams. The following narrow room is ad-
joinod by two sidewchambers and three other chambers in the
back-wall. In this room appears Ramses II. worshipping and pm
seating oﬁ’erings to various deities. Under a canopy are four gods.
The foremost is Ptah, harem-headed and in his usual mummyufem,

Ptah, wearing a headdress the bull’s home with two feathers

between them , This Ptah is described as ‘iefty with the two

feathers and the horns’. Next is a female ﬁgure with the moon-disc
(perhaps Rat-tail), and ﬁnally comes Esther, goddess of the southern
Nehet (sycamore tree), with home turned upwards enclosing two
feathers and the sunudiso. The colouring of the sacriﬁcial scenes in
the side-chambers is well—preserved; and this is still more the case
in the adytum, the central of the three chambers at the back. Both
to the right and left in this room the king is represented sacriﬁcing
before a richly adorned dhahabiyeh. The dhahabiyeh on the right has
thehawk’s head ofHarmachis as its emblem, that on the left the terms
head of Rheum-vita. Both. stand on ornamented tables. " 0n the left
the king is oﬁering incense above an altar, on the right he is odor-
ing ﬂowers. A large fan is home beside him, and behind are stan-
dards with the heads of the two gods and of the king. ... The con-
tral picture exhibits Khuum—Ra seated in a boat beneath a canopy,
with the kneeling king to the left and three cynocephali to the
right. Beneath is a recess, in which the outlines of three gods may
still he made out, although a ﬁgure of St. Peter, with a halo und a
large key, has been painted over them. The king, who appears on
the right and left, with ﬂowers, has new the appearance of oﬁering
them to the saint. Beneath is an inscription, running both to the
right and to the left and extending on to the side walls: ‘The living
Hora-Ra, the strong, the beloved of Ms, lord of the festivals, like his
father Ptsh, king of both lands, Ramses the Great, he has made it
in memory of his father Amman-dis, king of the gods’.

 

 

Beyond Sebﬁ'ah the scenery assumes a regularly desert character,
which it retains until near Kerusko. Rocky isolated peaks rise on
the left. At Mallet the Nile makes a sudden bend, and beyond this
point the banks are once more cultivated, while dense paints-groves
appear on the left (id), with scattered huts and many edhiyehe.
