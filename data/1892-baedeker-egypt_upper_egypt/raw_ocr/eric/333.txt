the steamboat terminus for the lower Nile, with a post and telegraph
ofﬁce, lies on the E. bank, partly on the plain and partly on a hill,
in N. lat. 24° 5’ 30". The fertile strip here is narrow, but supports
numerous date-palms, the fruit of which still enjoys a high repu—

its former population, when according to Arabian authors, no less
than 20,000 died of the plague at one time. Some of the houses

with artistically dressed curly hair, who odor for sale ostrich feathers
and fans, silver rings and armlets, ivory hoops, weapons from Gene
tral Africa, small monkeys, emulate, beautiful basket—work, and
aprons of leather fringe, the costume of the women of the dedn,
which they oddly call ‘Madama Nubia’. Grey and black ostrich
feathers are comparatively cheap ('8 piastres am 2 fr. each), larger
and perfect white feathers cost 10-»20 fr. apiece and upward. Trove

bazaars of all Nile towns, but is distinguished for its excellent local
pottery of great beauty of form. Candles, porter, ale, and even
tolerable Dutch cigars may be obtained at a Turkish ‘bakkal’. «—
Copper money is, seriously enough, accepted very unwillingly in
