300 LOWER NUBIA. History.

therefore who desire to proceed to the second cataract should stipulate in
their contract (p. anti), for a boat able to perform the entire voyage.

Nubia extends from the ﬁrst cataract to Khartum, he. to N. lat.
10°, and is divided into Lower Nubia, between the ﬁrst two cats--
racts, and Upper Nubia, above the second cataract. Upper Nubia,
which with the dein and Dirfﬁr was formerly subject to Egypt,
is at present independent, and is not accessible for tourists. Lower
Nubia belongs to the mudiriyeh of Eeneh, from which it is governed,
so far as it is not under military (British) rule. It extends to
about N. lat. 22°.

The cultivable strip, even in Lower Nubia, is seldom more than
a few hundred yards wide, while it is generally much narrower, so
that the desert approaches close up to the banks of the Nile. As a
natural consequence the pepulation is scanty; it is estimated to be
not more than 40,000 between the ﬁrst and second cataracts. The
Nile ﬂows for the ﬁrst half of the distance between the cataracts
from S. to N., for the second half from S.E. to N.W., and. in Upper
Nubia from N. to S. The Monuments of Lower Nubia are nearly all
on the W. bank, where they were less exposed to hostile attack. The
most interestingﬂis the temple ofAbu-Simbcl, the last station before
Widi Ealish. The monuments in Upper Nubia are rarer but not less
remarkable, as 6.9. those at Gebel Barks].

History. The ﬁrst cataract forms the natural boundary of Egypt.
But in early times, when the Egyptian monarchy was at its zenith,
it extended its power much farther to the 8., at ﬁrst as far as Tom

kompso. The district of 12 Ar q (Greek, Dodsbaschoinos),

assigned by the Egyptian rulers to the Isis ofPhila, stretched upon
both banks as far as this point, as is attested not only by Herodo-
tus (H, 29) but also by inscriptions in the temple of Philw. If Ta—

kompso (Egypt. 38.33% m m, with many variations) be cor-u

rectly identiﬁed with Hierasykominos (Holy Sycamore), which lay
near the modern village of Maharahah (p. 322), the length of» these
1‘2 schoinoi was, according to measurements by Prohesch, equal to
301/2 hrs. journey or 100 .M., giving about 123/3 M. per or or
schoinos. The inscriptions speak of the entire region above Ombos,
including the Dedekaschoinos, as being in the ﬁrst some of Upper

Egypt, which they name M Tu kbcnt Cl), ‘l‘rontier land’ or “how--

land’, because the natives were armed with bows. To the S. of this
