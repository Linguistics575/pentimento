Also in the doorway appears the praying ﬁgure of Satan, royal prince
of Kush, who according to the royal cartouohe above, served under
Ramses II. The Antechamber itself consists of three rows of pillars,
arranged in three couples on each side, and behind is a. row of

‘The living good god of the Home (genuine), who defeated Ethiopia,

which occupies the whole of the remaining length of the temple
(about :16 it). The doors to the right and left each admit into two
chambers, one behind the other, the front chamber in each case
