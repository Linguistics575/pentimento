ably the sanctuary founded by that prince still lies beneath the
houses of the town. The hypostyle, however, must have been mined
and rebuilt under the Ptolemies, for the adornment of the hell he-
gun by these princes was continued by the early Roman emperors
“and completed by their successors. The inscriptions on the rear-
wall were begun by Ptolemy VH. Philometor. The Dedication Inn
scription above the entrance celebrates the ‘antocrats’, Tiberius,
Claudius, Germanicus, and Vespasian as the builders, while a share
in the decoration of the interior was taken not only by these prin-
ces, but also by Titus, Domitian, Nerve, Trajan, Hadrian, Anto-
ninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius , Commodus , Septimius Severus,
Caracalla, (iota, Julius Philippns, andDeoius (249-251). The name
of Decins is specially noteworthy as being the latest imperial name

that appears in hieroglyphios on any Egyptian monument.
It appears in the following capricious form: ---

sun, and lord of the diadems, Tobie cuts-Mn, in. arm: oeﬁdotoc. The
emperor oﬁ‘ers a ﬁre-altar to Khnnm. On‘the main architrave is Vermin»:
on the absent and entrancevdoor Titers; on the lower side of the main
architrave Domitian; on. the columns News and Trajan. Nerve occurs here
only once and is found nowhere else. Antoniuus Hos, Marcus Aurelius,
and Gommodos, occur on the exterior wall; and the last also on the N.
half of the W. wall and on the N. wall. Sepftmiec Severus, Commits, and
Gate appear on the N. and S. walls; Coveralls and Julius Ph'tlfppos on the
left half of the rear-wall; and Doctor at the foot of the rear—wall.

The building, referred to several times in the inscriptions, as
the ‘House of Khnum’, was dedicated to the ram-headed Ellesm-
Ru, with whom, forming a tried, appear an Isis-Netti; under the name
Q (Nebuut), and a peculiar Horns—form, named Hirka.
There was also a special cycle of gods of Esneh, at the head of
which was Rheum, followed by Re, Tom, Khepers, Shn, Osiris,
Home the son of Isis, Thoth, and Khunsn. Strobe narrates that
Athens and. the ﬁsh Lotus were worshipped here in Latopolis; and
he was not misinformed. We not only ﬁnd the latter mentioned in
the inscriptions of the hypostyle, but the lotus gave the town its
name under the Greeks, while the coins of the Letopotiton Nome
bore the ﬁgure of a ﬁsh, and ﬁnally an inscription at Edfu informs
us that the people of Latopolis were forbidden to eat ﬁsh. Athena
(Nahum) frequently, appears, as we have seen; and. as Strobe makes
no mention of Khnum, who was undoubtedly the chief of all the
godsof this sanctuary, it must be concluded that he was for some
reason led to assign to the lame the place of this deity. Ppobably
