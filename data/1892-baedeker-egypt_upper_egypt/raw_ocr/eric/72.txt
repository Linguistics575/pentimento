here. The northernmost tomb (No. 302’ Lepsius) shorts us the king
and. his family standingbn a dais, below which foreign capn‘res
are depicted. The royal pair receives rich tribute. Those bringing
the‘gii‘ts are Egyptians. hi, to whom the tomb belongs, is adorned
with necklaces on account of the abundance of his contributions.
Numerous servants carry the sacks and bottles to the open cellar-
door, in front of which, in a bending attitude, is a bailiﬁ with a
staﬁ. it is possible that the cellar belongs to Al”, and that the gifts
are royal bounties to him. m The nest grave to the 8., on a prom
jeoting bill, was excavated in 1883. It was destined for Modes, a
commander of the rota]. police, and scenes from his life (Arrest of
mountaineers, Escort of the king’s equipage, etc.) are depicted on
the walls of the ﬁrst chamber (esp. to the right of the entrance).
In the right sideuwall is a door bearing a prayer in behalf of Mshu
to Atom-alto. (theradiating solar disc). «on The next tomb, that of
the royal ofﬁcial Tutu, contains (to the right of the entrance) the
almost complete text of a hymn, sung by a priest in praise of the
sun: ‘The breath of the wind’, says the hymn, ‘enters their nostrils,
and Thy gift it is that they have being All ﬂowers bloom and
grow in their beds, and they ﬂourish at Thy uprising Foetal joy
arises at the sight of Thy countenance, All quadrupeds hurry along
on their feet, all ,thebirde in their nests ﬂutter their wings in joy’.
This tomb also possesses a ‘papyrus’ column, of unusually careful
workmanship and elaborate ornamentation. The basis of the can
pita]. is encircled, among the leaves, by a Urmusw-serpent; and at
the. upper end of the , shaft, below the richlyaadorned band replaw
sing the annuli, are singular decorations consisting of sacriﬁcial
gifts, including: many birds in groups of ﬁre --- To the S. ., at a
little distance, lies the tomb designated by Lepsius as No i This
also is dedicated to a high dignitary named Al, perhaps the same
as in Tomb 3. On the entrance—wall to the right is represented a
festival, which some interpret as that of an order, while others take
it for the marriage of Al, fan-shearer and commander of cavalry, to
the royal nurse. The king, denoted by the disc, his wife, and his
daughters stand on a dais. The courtiers, from the charioteers to
the military ofﬁcers and fan—bearers, receive with deep obeisances
the decorations which the Pharaoh, the queen, and the princesses
throw down to them. The foremost dignitary already wears six
necklaces, and. the lady behind him is just adding a ﬁfth to the
four she already possesses. A. troop of dancers enlivens the pro»
cecdings by energetic leaps and contortions, and secretaries make
a note of the donations. To the S. are several other graves, inn
cluding those of Apii and Ramses, the latter a general and chamber-
lain of Amenhotep HI. To the N.N.W. of these tombs lay the huge
residence of the singular king Khuuenmaten, which was perhaps
destroyed by the same generation that obliterated his name from
the cartouches.
