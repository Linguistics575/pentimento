or Cataract. The remaining? ﬁgures are repetitions of those seen
elsewhere. 0n the left wall the paintings representing the punish-
ment of enemies and eviludoers are particularly interesting. In the
last room, the names of the hours appear to the side; straight in
front are the sun’s disc and a divine ﬁgure. The last is held by a
form, beside which the king sits, saying: ‘Praise be to Amman-Ra,
Harmachis, to the great ﬁre-disc, to the light-god Khepra in the
boat of Seti, Tum, when he parishes, to the beloved soul of heaven,
the venerable Sekhem, who there causes fruitfulness t

and the shaft ﬁlled with rubbish. It belongs to a king Amomnesee,
whose position in the 19th Dynasty is uncertain. It is, however:
certain that he preceded Ramses III. ,for the tomb of the latter (see
below) has had to curve to the right to avoid impinging upon this
tomb of Amonmeses.

Ramses III. This imposing tomb, usually called ‘Brucca Tomh’ or
‘The Harper’s Tomh’, owes its existence to the lavish builder of
Medinet Habu (p. 172). Inferior in size only to No. ‘17 and No. id,
this tomb with the former of these, most deserves careful examin-
ation. The style of the sculptures is not the best, but the variety
and richness of the representations are unexcelled. This tomb pos-
sesses a unique peculiarity in the ten sidemchambers, one on each
side of the ﬁrst corridor, and four on each side of the second corridor.

Above the door appear Isis and Nephthys praying on their knees
to the sun—disc, as at No. 8. At the entrance here the oartouohe
of Ramses III. has been chiseled over that of his predecessor Sati-

nekht 80', who rests in Tomb No. 14 (p. 215). At each

side is a pillar, with a bull’s head in basmrelief at the top. w- I. (to
the left) : the hing before Ilarmachis; then the ‘Book of the entail-
ing of Ra in Amenthes’; in poor preservation. Of the two side-w
chambers in this corridor, that to the left (No. I} is devoted to the
Festival. Oren are being slaughtered, their ﬂesh out in pieces, and
thrown into cauldrons. A. servant is blowing the ﬁre, while another
wields a ladle. A. second group attends to the wine. All kinds of
eatebles, cakes, and implements are at hand, and the cooks are busy.
Two dancers enliven the scene with their performances. In side-
chamber No. 2 (to the right) a dhahabiyeh in full sail is ascending
the Nile, and another, with sweeps, is descending it. ....... H. In the
recesses is a long series of demons, including the ‘great cat’, the
‘lamentiug one’, with hair hanging down, etc. To the right, the
