contains representations of the rem’swheaded Ammon, Isis, end Anubis.
The second room is entered by a narrow door, on which are sacriﬁcial
scenes .before the ram’s—heed Ammon and other deities. The name of
the worshipping king is unfortunately not added and only the word mares
is legible in the second certsnche. Above is the winged sen-disc. This
room is only half as long as the preceding and is destitute of all ornament
except on the control door lending to the Sanctuary. Remelé’s measure-
ments of the latter give the breadth st 7']: ft., the depth at 11 ft., and
the height at 10 ft. The photographs taken by him indicate that the
temple was built by Nero (l), Vespesion, and Titus. It was dedicated to
Amen-Ra, who is frequently represented with the reefs-heed and usually
accompanied by Moth. Once he is styled Lord of Heb, bet his usual

m W
designation is ‘Dweller in Act ab‘, 5.8. the sect of the
£3 Q

moon. Act eh appears to he the name of the site of the temple, for the
some designation is here used for She, son of Ba, and for other gods. --
The abovevmentioned door to the sanctuary had scenes of worship on
both its Wings, and e six-dine dedication-inscription. On passing through
it into the cells, we see on the left, above, Vespssien od’ering to Ammon-
Re, Moth, end Khnnsn; beneath, on the left, the same emperor cheating
to the senile-heeded Ammonvits with his family, and on the right, to Khem
and Osiris Unnot‘cr. In the bottom rows on the side-vvells ere depicted
Nile-gods, bringing offerings. ~—-—- (in the right well of the cells Vespasien
makes offerings to the rem’s~headed Amman-Be, Moth, and Khnnsn, then
to She, son of Ra, end to Tefnnt, and ﬁnally to She, Osiris, and Isis.
The ceiling was occupied by e rode astronomical representation, but
most of the blocks have fallen. The hockavvsll of the cells is divided
in halves, each containing 3 ﬁelds. In all 6 ﬁelds there eppears an
emperor sacriﬁcing to the gods, among whom the ram’svheaded Ammon is
twice represented. The emperor’s name seems to be Nero (or more pro-
bably Nerve) Kisses Germsnicns. -— The platform of the temple com-
mands an excellent *Vietv‘ towards the long Table Mountain mentioned by
Edmonstone. About 120 it. in front of the forevconrt of the temple is e
stone gateway, with various representations new barely visible. The
entire temple is surrounded by a brick wall.
