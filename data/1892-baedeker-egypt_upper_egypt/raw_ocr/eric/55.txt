From Cairo

Opposite Minyeh, on the E. bank, lies Kdm cleofarch, where
some ancient tombs, perhaps belonging to the 12th or 13th Dy-
nasty, have lately‘bcen discovered.

Zhwiyot eln-Hétin and Kern sl-Ahmar( ‘the red rubbish-mound’),
situated on the E. bank, 5-6 M. above Minyeh, may be visited to--
gether. We ﬁrst reach the village of Zdwiysh, user which are the
estate and beautiful garden of the venerable Abe. Sultan Pasha.
Between the village and Kdm elwhhmar, about 1/2 M. from the
latter, lies the ﬁne cemetery of the citizens of Minyeh (p. 9), with
its numerous domed tombs and chapels. Thrice yearly, in the
months of Regeb, Shawwdl, and Dhilhiggehi, at the time of full
moon, funereal festivals, lasting several days, are celebrated here.
Among the ceremonies observed are the sharing of dates to the
dead, which recalls the funereal oﬁerings of the ancient Egyptians,
and the presentation of palm~branches, recalling the Oriental sym-
bolism of early Christianity, still familiar in our churches. A. few
minutes’ walk towards the 8. brings us to the red mound of pottery
and rubbish known as Kdm elnAZtmai', which runs parallel with the
Nile. Climbing over this we reach the burial-avenue of the primeval
monarchy, which are situated among the Arabian hills, with their
gates towards the river.

The tombs are unfortunately in bad preservation, and some of them
have been destroyed by violence, the stones being removed for use in build‘
ing. It is uncertain of what town this was the necropolis, but it undonbt~
edly belonged to the 16th ocean of Upper Egypt, named Moi} or Mallet
(gazelle), in which the gaselle‘was held sacred. In this nome also lay the
towns of Heben and Nefrus, the chief deity of which was represented as
a sparrow-hawk standing on a gazelle, accompanied by Esther, Horns,
and Khnnm. Some of the tombs are still open to visitors. The lower
case are small and dilapidated, including one that was richly adorned
with statues. Similar ﬁgures, horse in the living rock, are still distinguish-
able on the facade and in the rear of the chapel. Farther up is the tomb
of Nefersekbrc, royal secretary and superintendent of the storehouses of
Upper and Lower Egypt, which still contains some good sculptures. This
tomb, in the rear of which are three niches, appems to have been son'-
structcd under the 18th Dynasty. Among its contents are sacriﬁcial lists
and scenes like those in the vaults of ‘Abd el-Kumah: Gsiris under a sa—
nopy; corpse crossing the Nile, accompanied by female mournersr the
deceased in the midst of his family. The tomb of Entrees, a relative of
the Pharaohs, situated farther to the S. and lower down, is of earlier origin
and in all probability belongs to the ancient kingdom. The scenes of
agriculture and navigation in this tomb, reproduced by Lepsius, are new
scarcely visible. From the upper tombs we obtain a splendidly varied
view of the Nile, its fertile Valley and the town of Hinyeh, with the red
mounds of debris in the foreground, while to the N. stretches the sandy
desert, from which the domed tombs of Zdwiyct el~hletin rise like a group
of tents. On the mound of Ram el-Ahmar lies a colossal ﬁgure, 70 ft.
long, without an inscription.

Benihasan and Specs Artemidos, 15 M. from Minyeh and. 162 M.
from Cairo, an important steamboatustation.

 

e These months cannot be reproduced by the names of our months,
as they pass through all the seasons of the solar year. Thus a festival
iwhich is celebrated this year in summer will take place 15 years hence
n winter. _
