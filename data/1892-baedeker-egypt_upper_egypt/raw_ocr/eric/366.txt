Skyablue, lightmgreen, and a light and a dark shade of red are the
prevailing colours; but these were distributed according to conventional
rules. Although vegetable forms are imitated with admirable ﬁdelity,
the artists did not shrink from colouring them with complete disregard
to nature, simply because ancient convention demanded it. Light-green
palm-twigs receive blue ribs, and blue ﬂowers have blue, red, or yellow
petals. Below the annuli on the shaft is a kind of band (found also else»
where), indicating that the vegetable forms surrounding the core of the
capital were supposed to be ﬁrmly bound to the top of the shaft. The
height and ornamentation of the lower parts of the shafts are the same in
all the columns; but the capitals, some of which are beautiful. palm-
capitals, are varied.

On the Ceiling are astronomical representations. The entire hall
bears the inscriptions of Ptolemy IX. Eucrgetes H.----~Abore the
door in the back wall leading to the process is a long Inscription,
carved over the hieroglyphics by the Italian Expedition of 1841..
The Christian successors of the priests of leis have out numerous
Coptic crosses in the walls to signaliss their appmpriation of the
temple and to guard against the cunning malice of the heathen
deities. Christian services were celebrated in this ball. A, Greek
inscription in the doorway to the process, on the right, records
that the good work (probably the plastering up of the reliefs and.
the preparation of the hall for Christian worship) took place under
the abbot Theodorus. This was in the reign of Justinian.

i. The Ghambers of the Pronaos. The three successive rooms
of the process date from Ptolemy ll. Philadelphus. The First
Room (Pl. r) was adjoined on. each side by others. That on the
right, now destroyed, was connected with a Second Room (Pl. s),
on the E. wall of which Philadelphus is shown presenting digest
adoring to his mother Isis. In the room to the left (Pl. t), int-which
the staircase to the roof starts, Philadelphus appears before Isis and
before Esther. The next room to the left is a dark chamber. Right
round the foot of the wall in the following wide Third Room (P1. 11),
immediately before the sanctuary, runs a list of nomes. The doors
on the right and left of this room admit to long, narrow, dark
apartments, perhaps used as Treasure—Chambers. The entrance to
that on the left (Pl. w) is about ‘2 it. from the ground. The visitor
should enter, strike a light, and inspect the sculptures in this
chamber which resembles a huge stone chest. The lower part of
the wall is smooth, as it was concealed by the treasures stored here;
but higher up Ptolemy H. Philadelphus caused the walls to be

adorned with elegant reliefs and inscriptions.
On the rear-wall is represented its. enthroned on the symbol of gold.
