Hebent. 0n the back-wall, to our left as we enter, King Home is depicted
retnrning in triumph from his campaign in Ethiopia.

This *Relt’cf, of great artistic value, shows the Pharaoh seated on
his throne which is home by 12 nobles adorned with feathers. The throne
has lions” feet and its back also consists of lions. The king wears the
war-helmet and carries the etch“ of empire in his left hand. Behind
and before him are court-ofﬁcials, warding off the sun‘s rays with the
longuhandled ﬂabellnm. The Kherheb precedes the litter, offering incense,
and a train of captured Ethiopians is led along by the victor. "Vanquished
blacks are lying on the ground and others are being rapidly marched oil“
by Egyptian soldiers. Above the captives are the words: ‘Leading of the
captives of the miserable Kush byHorus, king of Upper and Lower
Egypt, etc. His majesty came out of the land of Each (Ethiopia) with
the booty which his sword had made, as his father Amnion had com-
mended him”. Before the priests, who stand in a reverential attitude, is
written: ‘The good god approaches, he celebrates his victory over the great
ones of all lands. When he grasps the bow in his right hand he is like
the lord of Thebes (he. Month, the god of war), as king of the strength
of heroes. Above the prisoners is the inscription: ‘Hail to thee, king of
Egypt, sun of the harbariansl Thy name is extolled in the land of the
Ethiopians. Thy battle—cry resounds over their seats. Thy heroic strength,
0 then perfect prince, converts the alien lands into tombs. Pharaoh, long
life and health, 0 my sun-god? (She).

Farther to the right and also on the back~wall is a recess With King
Siptah Khuenra before Ammon, with Bai, an ofﬁcial (overseer of the
whole land). Next is a State of Panelists, of the second year of hiercn‘
ptah l. and his consort Astnefert; then a stale of the time of Ramses 1.,
and upon it the ﬁrst tablet of the Earliest instituted by the king‘s son
Khaemus in honour of his father Ramses II. The first tablet dates from
the 30th year, the second from the 34th,, the third from the 37th, and the
fourth from the 40th.

Beside the pillar is the small Sanctuary of Ramses II. To the left of
the entrance is King Horus (who built the sanctuary), before Harmachis
and the goddess Jesse, and the same hing before Amazon-«Ra and Math.
At the back of the very dark recess is a god, with three forms on each
side. Numerous ﬁgures of gods. To the right of the entrance to the
sanctuary is a reproduction of the Festival Stale mentioned above. Ad-
joining is the stale of the high-priest Moi, who instituted a festival in
the third year of Merenptah I. Farther on is another Festival State, with
Ramses ll. before Harmachis and ninth, Ptah, and Schek. The date is
the same as on the preceding, but the marshal of the festival is here the
Erpa Ha (prince) and mayor Shot. The same ofﬁcial appears also in the
same stole of the 46th year of Ramses II. as marshal of the 6th festival
in the whole land (Khaemus had probably died in. the interval).

The numerous reliefs above and below the ﬁve doors and in the rev
ceases outside should also be noticed. Over the central door: King Horas,
here called the beloved of Ammon and Math,“ of Khnum, of Abe, and. of
Ank, mistress of Sati (Asia). Over the second door (from the left):
Ramses III. with the commander of his cavalry. Between the fourth and
fifth this king presents his to Arthur. Last relief on the right: Ramses ll.
brings his to Ptah m his shrine and toMSebek. Within the adjacent ﬁfth

 

door is the small chapel of Pa war , in which Ramses ll.
appears with his consort Astnefcrt and a princess (Bainut aunt) before
Fish and Neferturn. There is also a small ﬁgure of Khaemus. 0n the
inside of the front wall ,is a Hicratt‘c Ipswiption of the 5th year of Rain-
see 111., containing a command to Sctemhst, overseer of the palace, to
build in the house of eternity in the W. of Thebes (as. the tomb of
Ramses III. in Bibdn elwhfnlnk. The number of workmen under him
(M), ships (40), and hosts (4) are detailed. Two other hieratic Inscripu
time, of asimilar purport, are to be found on the central doorway, to the
right and left.
