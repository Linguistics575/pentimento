Straight on is a room about 25 ft. long. Here on July 5th 1881 Emil
Brasserie discovered the famous royal mummies, now in the 6-inch Museum.
Since January 1876 Ushabtis, tablets, and large funereal papyrus rolls, all
coming from this spot, had been sold to wealthy tourists through the
medium of Mustapha Age, the Eu lish consular agent at Luxor. Attention
was aroused by the Papyrus of ctemit, a queen of the 21st Dyn. which
was produced in several pieces, one of which is now in the Louvre, another
in the British Museum, having been presented to the Prince of Wales, and
a third in the possession of a Bel ian lady. Enquiries showed that there
were several brothers ‘Abd er-Ras 1 who were especially concerned in the
sale of these anti cities. The arrest and trial of Ahmed, one of the
brothers, followed y ﬂogging, led to no result. However partly from fear
of punishment, and partly for a promised. reward the secret was betrayed
by Ahmed‘s elder brother Mohammad, to the Mudir of Keneh, who gave
information to the Khedive. Brugsch describes the discovery as follows:

‘Every inch of the subterranean passage was covered with cofﬁns and

antiquities of all kinds. My astonishment was so overpowering that l
scarcely know whether I was awake or whether it was only a mocking
dream. Resting on a cofﬁn, in order to recover from my intense excite-
ment, I mechanically cast my eyes over the cofﬁn-lid, and distinctly saw
the name of King Self 1., the father of Ramses 11., both belonging to the
19th Dynasty. A few steps further on, in a simple wooden cofﬁn, with
his hands crossed on his breast, lay Ramses II., the great Sessstris him-
self. The farther 1 advanced, the greater was the wealth displayed, here
aimed-splits 1., there . Amorts, the three Trims, Queen domes refer-tort,
Queen Asthctsp, all the mummies well preserved; in all 36 cofﬁns, belong~
ing to kings and their wives or to princes and princesses. . . . .
" By the evening of July lith all the mummies and coffins had been
carefully packed at Luror. Three days later the Museum steamer came
to carry the precious burdens to Bdldh. From Loser to Koptos on both
sides of the Nile, the felldhin women followed the boat with loosened
hair and uttering ‘ plaintive cries, while the men ﬁred oﬁ‘ guns, as at a
funeral. The cofﬁns were taken to the museum at Bullets, and thence
removed .to the new museum. at Gizeh. --- The discovery included King
Racehorses, of the 17th 133711., the opponent of the Hyksos; of the 18th Dyn.
King Address, queens Actress nofsrteri and Aalzhotep, kings Amends-tsp 1.,
Tomes L, 11., and 1H,, prince ottoman, princesses Sttomoo and Merl»
tomes, Retreat a priest, and others; of the 19th Dyn. Ramses 1., Sets 1.,
and Ramses II. Ramses III. of the 20th dye. was also afterwards found.
0f the priest-kings of the 21st Dyn. Pioneers, Nozemit, Remote with her
daughter, a second Hussein, queen Hathorhontfauf, Marchirta a priest, two
princesses Ashton-theta and Nestkhonsd, and others. There were also found
a large leather tent in red, green, yellow, and white for Ashen-then, the
daughter of King Museum, 40 canopi, 8700 statuettes of Osiris, 12 to 15
ceremonial wigs, and d6 wooden chests together with inscriptions, bronze
stools, papyrus rolls, and the like. The inscriptions found on the older
mummy-schools, as. that of Soil 1. and on the wrappings, were of great
importance, recording that the mummies had been taken from their tombs
by the priestokings of the 21st Dyn. (Harbor, Sitamon, Pinozem, and lia-
sahirta the priest) and removed to that of a lady named An ﬁrst or Au
hope, in which also lay hmenhotep I. In the Abbott Papyrus which is a
indicted enquiry into the robbery of the tombs the passage iQO ells long
to the tomb of Amenhotep 1., which was to the bl. of the temple of Amen-
hotep, is mentioned. This corresponds to the passage in the Der el-bahri
pit. The colours of the garlands of ﬂowers Were marvellously well
prmerved. The plants have been named by Prof. Schweinfurth.

(in June isth by the wish of the Khediye the enrolling of the
mummies, a somewhat bold proceeding, was taken in hand, beginning with
the gre‘ywhaired Ramses the Great, whose sharp features and curved nose
arovremarltably striking. In. the cofﬁn of Notes-tart the mummy of Raul-
ses m. was strangely found. Then followed Seti I. with his mild features,
Rmekcnen with his fierce look and broken skull, having perhaps fallen in
battle with the Kheta, Aahmes 1., and the priest-hinge of Thphe s. mummy
