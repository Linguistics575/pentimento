the oldest part, dating ﬁcm Nectanebus. We know also that the
goddess of Philm was worshipped by the Btummyes (p. 302), who
maintained the custom of human sacriﬁces until the time of Justin
nian. After Diocletian, who personally visited the island, had con-
quered these restless children of the desert, be destroyed the
fortifications of Philae , and new temples were erected in which
priests of the Blemmyes and Notaries were permitted to offer
sacriﬁces to Isis along with the Egyptian priests. And these tribes
even obtained the right of removing the miraculous image of
the mighty goddess from the island at certain solemn festivals
and of retaining it for some time. Even after all Egypt had long
been christianieed and the Theba‘id was crowded with monks, the
ancient pagan—worship still held sway in Nubia, in spite of the
Edicts of Theodosius. The Nobedes were converted to Christianity
about 540 AD. under the auspices of the Empress Theodora, and
shortly afterwards Narses, sent by Justinian to Egypt, closed the
temple of Isis on Philm, and sent its sacred contents to Constantin-
cple. At ﬁrst the peeple of Philm adopted the orthodox creed, but
when Egypt was conquered by lsldm, they exchanged this for the
monophysite heresy. Although an inscription has been found in
the presses in praise of 3. Bishop Theodorus (577 ADJ, who do-
dicated a portion at least of the temple of Isis to St. Stephen, it
is doubtful whether Philm was ever an episccrpal seat. It is certain,
however, that Christian services were held in the hypostyle. The
inscriptions and reliefs were plastered over with Nilcumud or had
crosses carved upon them, so as to Spare the feelings of the faith
ful and to exercise the evil spirits. --- Like Christianity, islem was
late in ﬁnding its way to Philm, and there is not a trace of a mosque
or anything of that nature on the entire island. Nubia was choc-
tually conquered. in the 13th cent. by the Egyptian sultans, who
included the cataractmregion in their private domains, and thus
secured the temples from destruction. --- Philm was described in
1787 by Norden and Porsche, though at that time the natives were
as hostile to strangers as they are new friendly and obliging.

Isis, the chief deity of the island, is usually represented in the
triad completed by Osiris and Home, but she frequently also
appears alone. Everywhere, in her various forms, she occupies
the foremost place, just as Hathcr does at Denderah. The deities of
Philm include its and. Month, the twinmgcds Shu and Tefnut, Solo
and Nut, Osiris—Unnofer (Agathodmmon) and Isis, Khnum and
Sati, the gods of the cataracts, Horus the son of Isis, Hathor, and
the child Horus. Thoth, Safehh, and other deities also frequently
appear.

Platter is the pearl of Egypt, and those who have several days to
spend at the cataract, should certainly take up their abode upon it.
