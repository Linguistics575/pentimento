32 Route 1 . ASSI‘O’T. From Cairo

teacher. once planted and watered a piece of dry wood and that a fruit-tree
sprang up, called the ‘Tree of Obedience‘, yielding fruit for the monks.

From very early times Assidt was considered the northernmost point
of the Thebold.

The steamers and dhahabiyehs are met at etwﬂomrah by donkey
boys with well-saddled donkeys and by sellers of pottery, which
can nowhere in Egypt be obtained better than here. The ﬁne pottery
of health, especially its bottles and pipe-bowls, is justly celebrated
and forms an important article in its snport trade, which also deals
in. linen, embroidered leather goods, ostrich feathers and other pro-
ducts of the Sfrddn, natron, soda, and corn. It has, however, lost
part of its commercial importance since the great caravans from W.
Africa have frequented other routes and. places. Large trains of
camels still come from Darfdr and Kordofdn, generally encamping
at Bent ‘Adin (p. 29), 19 M. to the N.W. of Assidt. The vicinity
of Assidt is one of the best-cultivated districts in the valley of the
Nile, the fertile strip between the Libyan and Arabian Mts. here
attaining a width of 12 M. The province of Assiﬁt, the mudir of
which resides here, contains 234 villages with 583,596 inhab. (incl.
the cases of Khdrgch and Ddbhct). Near the harbour are several large
palmmgardens, in which also grow pomegranate, ﬁg, and other fruit-
trees. These gardens are lot at enormous prices and produce rich
harvests of fruit.

Those who have 21f2~3 hrs. to spare should not omit to ride
through the town and to the tombs on the slopes of the Libyan
limestone hills, not only for the sake of the antiquities, but to see
the busy Oriental life in the bazaars and to enjoy the view from the
graves. Candles and matches must not be forgotten. To visit Assidt
from the dhahabiyeh and to ride through it takes about 1 hr. The
town lies about 3/4 M. from the river and is reached from the hat»
hour by an embanked road shaded with beautiful trees. Outside
the town lie the long government buildings. The streets are full
of busy life, especially on Sundays, when the people of the neigh-
bourhood ﬂock into the market. Oriental wares are cheaper in the
bazaars of Assidt than at Cairo, but European goods are dearer. The
better houses are of burned brick, the meaner of sun-dried Nile
bricks. The facades on the street are generally unimposing, but a
glance into one of the courts of the bigger houses will show that
the wealthy merchants of Assiﬁt are not indiﬁ‘erent to comfort and
display. The main. street intersecting the town from E. to W. is
nearly 3 M. long.

Neoropolis of Ancient Lycopolis. To reach this from the her-
hour we require at least 3/4 hr. Riding through part of the town,
we diverge from the main street at the point where it bends to the
right and. proceed to the left, through the cultivated land and across
a handsome bridge, to the foot of the Libyan hills. The dark
openings of the tombs and caves are conspicuous at a distance in
the abrupt sides of the mountain, below which liesgthe ngw Arab
