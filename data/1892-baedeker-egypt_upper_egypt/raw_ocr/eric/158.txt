Antiquities. THEBES. 9. Route. 103

Other claims upon the traveller‘s time will he made in Thebes. If he
have paid a visit to one of the consular-agents, he will he invited to a
antnsiyo, and if he have brought good introductions, the fantasiya will
he preceded by a dinner. Ainong the modern Arabs the word ‘fautasiya‘
is applied to every kind of amusement, from the aimless discharging of
musicals, to the greatest festivity. In the present connection it signiﬁes
an evening party, at which the chief entertainment is the more or less
skilful dancing of hired ghawtizi, and which is recommended especially
to gentlemen who have not before seen anything of the kind. Chihouks,
cigarettes, codes, and liqueurs are otl‘ered to the guests.

Antiquities. The traveller in Thebes is frequently tempted to purchase
antiquities. Half the population of honor is engaged in trafﬁc with an-
tiquities, and the practice of fabricating scarahsei and other articles
frequently found in tombs is by no means unknown to the other half.
many of the articles oﬂ‘ercd for sale are so skilfully imitated that even
experts are sometimes in doubt as to their genuineness; the ordinary
traveller seldom or never secures an authentic s ecimen. Only as many
pleats-es as they ask shillings should ever he 0 ered to the imperialists
hawkers of antiquities at the temples and tombs. Those who desire a
genuine memorial of antiquity should apply to the director of the hotel
or to one of the ahovonamed consular agents. Even in this case, however,
absolute certainty is not attainable; for though honourable traders them-
solves, the consular agents are liable to be deceived in the purchases
they: make. Caution should he observed in the purchase of unopened
Papyrus Rolls; for dishonest vendors are in the habit of pasting torn
fragments of papyrus (frequently found in tombs) upon cause so as to
present the appearance of genuine papyrusnrolls. Egyptian antique hronses,
. with artiﬁcial rest, are made wholesale in Trieste, Paris, and Hanan;

Cairo and honor have the best factories for the fabrication of antiques in
terracotta and carved wood. Valuable and genuine antiques may, however,
still he obtained in honor by those who are prepared to spend money.
The prices are high; 3i. being new charged for a genuine scarabmus.
Good and reliable specimens. including papyri, may be obtained from
Mohammad hi‘hssseh and ‘Ahd elnhiegid.

Photographs. Good photographs are produced by A. Boots in Lunar;
but even in Shephcard‘s and other hotels in Cairo, excellent photographs
of Egyptian temples are sold at moderate prices. Those by H. Béchard

the W. bank they must he ordered beforehand. -- Little girls with water-
bottles run after the traveller, especially on the W. bank, keeping up
with the donkeys with tireless agility. One should be selected and repaid
with a few piastres on the return. The attractive faces of these many
children sometimes vividly recall the portraits of Egyptian women of the
time of the Pharaohs.
