supreme judge to whom Salk conducts the queen. Behind him am
Nephthys and Thoth. 0n the walls a and f are tables of oderings on
which, by the side of distributions of bread etc. , lie masses ofﬁowers
far larger than are found in the tombs of men. In the Sidewchamber at
we see the Esther cow, richly decorated and standing out of a backw-
ground of radiance and ﬂames of ﬁre painted with dazzling colours.
This painting, which meets as several times in the tombs of the
Queens, represents Hathor as a goddess of heaven and especially of
the horizon. She is the cow which in the lower world gives birth
to the young Sun, who begins his active life with ﬂame and light

On the r ight close to the tomb of Tit‘i lies that of Queen Isis,
