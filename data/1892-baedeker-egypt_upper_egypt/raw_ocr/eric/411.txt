com, the other at com men. The Egyptian chariots meet those of the
Khota and their allies, who ride three in a chariot. Many of the enemy,
both Kheta and Libyans, have fallen into the water. To the extreme
right, above the blue-painted river, is the king in his chariot, addressing
gracious words to his officers, who count the covered hands and limbs of
the thta and Naharina before him and bring tattered prisoners. A narrow
strip below represents the chariot—tight. Beneath, to the left, is the
stochadcd camp, into which, according to the adjoining inscription, the
enemy forced their way but were repulsed by the single legion of Amazon,
commanded by the king, who had been lulled into security by the false
reports of two spies, and had dcspatched several of his regiments in
another direction. in the picture to the right the king sits upon his
throne, among his courticrs. To the right and left of the royal person is
the account of an event in the 5th year of his reign, already known to
us from the Ramesseum (p. 161). It relates that two Arabs (Shaun) one
tered the Egyptian camp, pretending to be refugees from the Kheta, and
seeking service under the Pharaoh. They stated that the Khota lay at
Khirabu (Hclbon he. Aleppo) to the N. of Thnncp, and were in terror of
the Egyptians. This information was false, and the two spies were flogged
(in the lowest scene to the right), in order, as the inscription says, that
they might say where the miserable Kheta lurked. The spies were next
brought before the king on his golden throne, and crossucxamined, and
ﬁnally confessed that the Kheta, with numerous allies, lay behind Katesh.
The king assembles his generals, relates what the spies have told, chides
his oft’icrs for being so imperfectly informed, and orders the recall of the
troops that had been sent elsewhere. He himself puts on his armour,
attacks the enemy, clays them, and throws them into the river.

rFwo pictures on the back. (W.) wall of this main hall show the king
presenting the enemies in fettcrs to the gods. 0n the left are two rows
of negrocs and Nubians before Ammomita, the deiﬁed image of the king,
and Math; on the right the Asiatics (Hittites) before Harmachis, the
figure of the king, and a lion-headed goddess (Sekhet). The adjoining in-
scription runs: ‘Bringing of the tribute by the good god (is. the king)
for his father Ra, when he came out of the land Rheta, annihilating the
rebellious lands and smiling the enemies in their dwellings, with silver,
gold, khesbet (lapiswlaculi), mafelt (malachite), and precious stones, as
the conquest of every land had been commanded hint". Between the two
last pillars in this hall is a stain of the 35th year of Ramses 11., on which,
beneath a relief, is a long decree in favour of King Rmnses, issued by
the god Ptah Totunon. This decree was repeated almost word for word
by Ramses III. on the pylon of the temple of Medinet Babe.

The other chambers of this temple are less interesting, and
their examination is rendered troublesome by the swarms of hats
that ﬂy against the lights. They contain only the usual scenes of
shortage, most of them unﬁnished. As the accompanying plan
(p. 33?.) shows, two parallel chambers (Pl. 0, N) run ed from the
N. side of the main hall, while from the ends of the back wall lead
two oblique passages (Pl. K, G), from each of which run two parallel
chambers (Pl. L, M, and P1. H, 1). Round the walls of these latter
chambers run stone benches, less than 3 ft. high. In the S.W.
chamber (Pl. l) is the picture of an altar with a hieratic inscrip—
tion. Directly behind the main hall. (Pl. if) is a smaller hall (Pi. E;
36 ft. broad, ‘25 it. deep), with four pillars. On the N. and S. Ms
are depicted the boats with the shrines of Harmschis and. Amman,
borne in each case by 20 priests. Three doors lead hence to along
narrow chamber (Pl. B), at the back of which are three recesses
(Pl. A, C, D). In the central recess, the sanctuary, eta d n altar,
