The building is at once a temple of the gods and a. temple of fame;
dedicated ‘e toutes les gloires’ of the empire of the Pharaohs, it was
compelled to receive additions, often in most unsuitable placess
whenever it was the Mil of the king to recognize the favours of
Ammon by new buildings which should record for posterity what
the god had done for him, and through him for Egypt.

Before we enter the peristyle court, an inscription on the door of the
pylon. to our right as we enter, merits notice. rthis was placed here by
the caveats who accompanied the army of Napoleon to Egypt, and records
the latitude and longitude of the chief temples of the Pharaohs, as cal-n
saluted by them.

This monument of enticing and successful diligence deserves to be
greeted with respect; it contrasts with the steerable taste of the idle
tourists who have scribbled over and defaced inscriptions within the
temple, with their own insigniﬁcant names. Opposite the French table
an Italian learned society (Feb. 9, 1841) have erected another showin
the variation of the compass (declinaslone dell‘ ago magnetite) as 1096' .
The inscription is signed ‘Harina genio“ etc.

b. The Great Peristyle Court and its Additions.

The great *Peristyle court (Pl. A.) is believed by important
authorities to have been built by the rulers of the 22nd. Dynasty.
The oldest part of the temple is the sanctuary (p. 134), situated
much farther to the E. Probably the clearest view of the growth
and historical development of the great house of Ammon would be
obtained by beginning there and thence visiting the later portions
in the order of their erection; but in following out this plan we
should be obliged to diverge irregularly hither and thither from the
main lines, and so would miss much of the eﬁ'ect designed by the
builders. The inﬂuence of the god was supposed to radiate from
within outwards; while the procession of his adorers advanced slowly
towards Amman from without inwards. The sanctuary was the dual,
unapproacheble goal of the pious, few of whom were permitted to
penetrate farther than the peristyle court. The hypoetyle ball was
indeed open to certain privileged worshippers, but only the ‘initi-n
ated’ were allowed to approach any nearer to the holy of holies. That
sacred chamber itself might only be entered by the high-priest and
the Ring, the representative of the god upon earth. The arrange-
ment of the peristyle and succeeding chambers indicate in the
clearest manner the nature of the services celebratedawiihilhlihbms
