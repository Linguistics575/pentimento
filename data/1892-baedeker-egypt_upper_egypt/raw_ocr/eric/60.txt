the son of the Lady Hanna, who was one of the chief dignitaries
of the kingdom, bore the title of an capo he or prince, governed
the name of Mall in time of peace, and commanded a division of
the army in war. To the left and right of the entrance he is depicts»
ed on a throne with lions" feet, holding his commander’s baton in
his hand. Inside the deer are two well—preserved inscriptions,
out in the stone. That to the right (8.) informs us that Amenemha
departed this life in the ddrd year of Uscrtesen 1., corresponding
to the 25th year of the governorship of Ameni. He undertook all
his wars ‘sailing up-nstream’ : ---i.c. he campaigned only against
the dwellers of the 8., the ‘miserable Kushites’, as they are called
in the inscription. In those days the arms of the Pharaohs had not
yet been carried tost the E. The Sinai peninsula, with its
mines, is the only district in this direction which excited the Egyp—
tion lust of conquest. From his southern campaigns Amenemha
brought home much gold and. other booty. The inscription to the
left (N1) also mentions a victorious campaign towards the S., but
is of special" interest for the light it throws on the truly human
feelings of this bye-gone time. Amenemha describes his occupan-
tions in time of peace as follows (beginning at the fourth line from
below): ‘1 cultivated the entire norms of Mah with many work-
people. I troubled no child and oppressed no widow, neither did
I keep a ﬁsherman from his ﬁshing or a herdsman from his hard.
There was no head of a village whose people I had taken away for
compulsory labour, and there was no one unhappy in my days or
hungry in my times. When, however, a famine arose, I tilled all
the ﬁelds in the nome of Mah, from its 8. to its N. boundary, and
gave nourishment and life to its inhabitants. So there was no one
in the users who died of hunger. To the widow I allowed as much
as to the wife of a man, and in all that I did 1 never preferred the
great man to the small one. Men the Nile rose again and every-n
thing ﬂourished m- ﬁelds, trees, and all else ......... I out ed nothing
from the ﬁelds’.

The paintings in the interior of the tomb-chamber proper are
unfortunately very much faded , and they have also been com-
siderably injured, capeclally in recent years. Some ﬁgures of war-
rlors which snll remain, armed with club and are or club and lance,
have a foreign appearance, as their skin is of a lighter colour than
that of the Egypﬁans, and their hair and boards are red.

Tomb No. 2 is that of Khnumhotcp, the son of Nehera. It owes
its origin to a member of a family of high rank, in which the ofﬁce
of governor of Mah seems to have been hereditary for several gem
neratlons. Amenemha 1., Usertesen 1., and Amenemha H ,the ﬁrst
kings of the 12th Dyu. ., showered titles and digniﬁes with a free
hand on this family, which in return clung to the royal line with
peculiar loyalty and aﬁection. By a wonderful piece of good fortune
we are able to reproduce the entire family—tree of this fa ,1. in
