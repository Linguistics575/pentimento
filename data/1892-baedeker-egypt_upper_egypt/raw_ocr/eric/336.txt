of some rebellious S. tribes in the land of Knsh and the district
of Kenes. Some inscriptions of a certain Senmut before liaison
and her daughter Raneforu record the quarrying and despatch of
two large obelisks; another is from the 9th year of Seti 1.; others
are by a bios (Moses) under Merenptah L; and another is by a certain
Seti, a royal son of Kush and president of the gold—land of Siptah,
and his minister Bai.

In 1885-86 some important Tombs ofthe 6th and 12th Dyn.
were opened on the hills (‘Mount Grcnfcll’) lying to the W. oppo—
site Assuin, ﬁrst by Mustafah Shahir, British consular agent at As-
suan, and. than by Majorwgeneral Sir F. Grcnfell. They lie about
1/4 hr. to the N. of the W. convent (no cl—gharbiych). We cross
the river in the small boat and land at a ruined stone quay, whence
an ancient staircase, hewn in the rock, ascends for about 150 ft,
ﬂanked on either side by a wall of more recent date. The stairs
are in three ﬂights, from the top of each of which inclined planes
lead towards the tombs, evidently intended for the transPort of the
sarcophagi. At the summit of the staircase is a platform with
tombs of the 6th and 12th. Dynasties.+ Tomb No. 26, with a curious
door placed anew—third up the height of another door, belongs to a

courtnofﬂcial named Saben , who ﬂourished under New
NW

ferlrara Pepi Ii. (6th Dyn) and was employed on the pyramid of

that king Men—ankle (see Plan Vol I, p. 378).

The tomb consists of an oblong hall. (69 ft by ‘26 ft), with a coil-
ing supported by M square pillars Close to the entrance, beside
the ﬁrst pillar on the right, is the standing ﬁgure of Saben, with
red complexion and black hair. On the back-wall the deceased
appears spearing ﬁsh from a boat, with a companion engaged in
catching birds that rise from a bed of papyrusnplants. To the left
is a passage, leading to a winding mummy-shaft On the left side
of this tomb, and not separated from it by any partition wall, lies

Tomb. No 25, belonging to a certain Mekhn (:_ This

contains eighteen columns in three rows, resembling the so-called
prom—Doric columns in the tombs at gBenihasan (p 12) Be-
tween the ﬁrst two rows stands a square stone, probably used as an
altar. To the right of the entrance are a few paintings. Mekhu
leans upon a staﬁ‘, being perhaps lame, while oﬂ‘erings are pro-
sented to him. (one of his sons was also named Mek‘hn, his wife
Aha was a priestess of Hathor, while another son, called Sabcn, was
possibly the owner of tomb 26). In the adjoining paintings Melrhu
is shown making an oﬁering himself and ploughing nrlth oxen and
