overcoat, and a substantial rug should not be forgotten. A sun-u
umbrella and kuﬁyeh, a silk handkerchief or mudler, blue or grey

be found useful. Saddles, which may be hired in Cairo, should be
taken, especially if ladies are of the party, for the donkeys hired at

provide themselves with a long and strong ladder; as well, as a
magnesium lamp or magnesium-wire (to be obtained in Cairo). ---
