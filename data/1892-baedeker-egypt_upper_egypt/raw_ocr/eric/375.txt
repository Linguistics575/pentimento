of the petty Egyptian kings by Pssmmetikh l. (SM—Sid). In his
reign, according to the somewhat incredible story of Herodotus (H,
30'), 240,000 soldiers, discontented with the severity of their service,
emigrated to Ethiopia, where they settled near Merci under the
name of Antomoles or Sembrites, and did much to reﬁne the man-
ners of the Ethiopians. Psammetikh H. undertook an expedition
against the Ethiopians (Herod. H, 160), to which references are
made in Greek and Phoenician inscriptions in the temple of Abuse
Simbel (p. 334). The steles at Barks}. mention two other Ethiopian
kings, Horwsiuatcf and Nostessnm, whose reigns cannot be accou-
rately dated. The former reigned for forty years, war-red against the
Redeem and Media, African tribes of Dirfﬁr and Abyssinia, and
erected temples ; of the latter we learn that he was solemnly crowed
in the temple of Napata.

The early royal residence Napata now began to decay, and
Berna (Merci) near Begerawiyeh became the capital of the Ethio~
plans. From Diodoms (HI, 6) we learn that under Ptolemy Phila—
delphus a king of the name of Ergomms shook himself free of the
inﬂuence of the priests and caused them to be massacred in the
golden temple. This can hardly be the same Ergamenes whom we
meet at Dakkeh (p. 316), for the latter does not seem to have
ﬂourished until the time of the Roman emperors. During the R0—
man period, an Ethiopian invasion of the Thebaid led to the cam-
paign of Petronius (25 B.C.), in which Napata was destroyed. Queen
Candace made peace with the Roman general (Strobe XVII, 5d).

Towards the close of the 3rd cent. Al). the country above Philm
was devastated by the Blemmycs, a ﬁerce Nubian tribe dwelling
between the Nile and the Red See, who carried their depredations
even into the Roman territory beyond Assuin. To restrain them
the emperor Diocletian summoned the tribe of the Notaries from
the oasis of elaKhirgeh (p. 348) to the Nile valley, and settled them
in the district from Elephantine upwards, while the temples of
Philm were assigned as common sanctuaries to them and to the
Blemmyes. In spite of the aid of the Nobades, the ﬁve towns of
the Commititium Romannm (Prime, thnicon, Khiris, Taphis,
and Talmls) fell into the hands of the barbarians, who made Talmis
(Kalabsheh, see p. 307) their capital. in the dth and 5th cent.
they ravaged the Theba'id, so that in 451* All. Moriminus, the
general of the emperor Mansion, was forced to conclude a peace on
unfavourable terms for 100 years, which, however, only lasted until
the death of the general. Between 530 and 550 the Nobades were
converted to Christianity; and Stilts, one of their kings, defeated
the Blemmyes. His victory is recorded in a Greek inscription
found in the temple of Kalabsheh (p. 308). Christianity gradua-
ally invaded the temples of Nubia; and the Nobad king Eirpano»
mos and Bishop Theodoms (p. 283) of Philm exterminated pau-
ganism. But not long afterwards Ethiopia, like Egypt, fell into
