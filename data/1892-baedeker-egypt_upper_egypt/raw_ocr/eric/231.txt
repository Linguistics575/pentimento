second row begins with kneeling chiefs from the 81min, who are
followed by white—clad Ethiopians with rings of gold , panther-names,
a giraﬁe, and oxen. The last have unusually variegated hides, and
each has a brown and a black human hand most singularly ﬁxed on
the points of its home. The inscription above this precession runs:
‘the great ones of Knob (Ethiopia) speak, Hail to thee, king of
Egypt, sun. of the foreign peoples. We shall breathe as then peru-
mittest and shall live according to thy pleasure’. In the third row
brown and black chiefs from Knsh bring gold and precious stones,
and semicircular fans of ostrichmfeathers, of exactly the same shape
as the ﬂabellum which new shades the pope on certain solemn
occasions and which was formerly used by the Pharaohs. A11 on
with artiﬁcially bent home, between which is a pond with ﬁsh
and bushes, should be noticed. The fourth and ﬁfth divisions are
much injured. They show bright red persons (Erythmans who
dwelt between the Nile and the Red Sea), Egyptians, and very light
coloured Egyptian women with nosegays, earthen vessels, gasoline,
etc. Hui appears again on the some well. Above and beneath may
be seen the ships which brought to Egypt the choice tribute of the
south. The two richly adorned and brightly painted dhahabiyehs
(above) resemble the craft (the ornamentation of course excepted)
in which the products of the Silddn are to this day transported to
the north. Five Ethiopian princes kneel upon the deck of the second
best. Cattle and other goods are being brought to Emt in the
smaller vessels below.

011 wall c appears the deceased, with the jackalwheaded Anubis
on his right and Osiris on. his left, while between him and the :
are oﬁerings to the dead. 011 wall a, near the door, stands the
deceased, with his domestics, singers, etc., and two richly adorned
Nile boats behind him; still farther back is the prince of Rash again,
surrounded by his treasuresm earthen vessels, skins of wild animals,
bright coloured boxes, etc. Rings of gold are being received and
are weighed by a treasurer named Hornofer

0n the rear wall to the right (a) appears the king (near the
corner pillar), with Hui before him -—~ Amenhotep, another prince
of Blush, is bringing pieces of lapisu-laauli on a dish. By his right
hand hangs a breast-plate, set with precious stones, like that were
by the high priest of the Jews. Behind Hui are several of those
gold and silver vessels, which at that time were manufactured by
the thnicians and Syrians with extraordinary artistic skill. Here
also are lapis~laznli, red cornelians, and priestly breastnplates. A11
inscription extols the Pharaoh in emphatic terms and informs us that
Syria pays this tribute. Their appearance alone is quite sufﬁcient to
enable us to decide with certainty as to the origin ofthe man here re—
presented, casting themselves in the dust before the king, or standing
and adoring him homage and tribute. Some of them are light”
coloured, others of a reddish hue; their proﬁle is unmistakably
