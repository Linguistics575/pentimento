12 Route 1. BENIHASAN. ' From Cairo

the doorway to the neat chamber are a long inscription and. a re--
presentation of the king oﬁering a cynocephalus. In the rearuw’all
is a niche (noes) with the cartouche of Seti I.

To the W. of the Specs Artemidos is a
second grotto (perhaps merely a cat’s tenth),
on the outside of which are the interesting
cartouches of Alexander 11., son of Roxana,
and air. scenes representing the king in the
company of the gods.

The dragomans new hurry on to (1/? hr.)
Benihasan, where we second to the S. tombs.
These, however, have "been almost entirely
destroyed, and. the only one of any interest
is No. 7, the tenth of Rhett, which contains
hunting-scenes and ﬁne clustered columns. Passing on we soon
reach (8 min.) the highly interesting N. tombs of Antoni (No. l.)
and Khnnmmhotep (No. 2); comp. pp. 14"“18.

The necropolis of Benihasan is one of the most interesting in
all Egypt, not only on account of the remarkable architectural
features of the 12th Dyn. seen here, but also for the manifold re—
presentations of scenes from the domestic life of the Egyptians at

that early era.

The journey from the Nile to the tombs takes from 3/4 hr. to 11/; hr.
according to the hot ht of the water and the landingwplace selected. Asses,
with good saddles, 41/2 fr. Candles, and if possible magnesium wire,
should be taken to light the tombs. The rents leads towards the here
limestone hills, at ﬁrst through groves of palms and then ahross sand.
The ancient Benihesea +, Benthasan el-Eadim (‘the old‘), now deserted lies
to the right; the modern village is to the S. of the usual landing-p see.
On reaching the limestone hills we see the remains of a dilapidated path,
supported by masonry, and ascend over debris to the horizontal hillwpath,
to the W. of which stretch the tombs.

Before the traveller enters the tombs to inspect the represen-
tations within, he should. examine the columns at the entrance. At
ﬁrst sight everyone will set these columns down as nnmistakeahle
examples of the Doric order; but the indisputable testimony of the
inscriptions informs us that they date, not from the Ptolemaic
period, but from the invasion of the Hyhsos, in the 152th Dyn., how
tween B.0. 2000 and 3.0. 3000. ,

Champollion named them Proton-Doric or PrenDoric Columns.
Since him many authorities, with these columns as their starting--
point, have tried. to establish the kinship of the early Greek order
with the architecture of Egypt and to prove that the former was
derived from the latter. These views, however, aroused keen op-

 

 

 

 

 

 

t The place was deserted 30 or 40 years before the visit of the French.
Expedition, hmuse the inhabitants wished a wider space for cultivation
near their village. which they accordingly rebuilt farther to the S. The
story that the villagers were expelled by Ibrahim Pasha and eaterminated
for robbery is a fabrication, although it is true that many of them were
executed for this crime.
