the festival of the beginning of the year, that her spirit may unite in
the heavens with her father (the annugod Ra). The goddesses are fee-é-
tire, the goddesses are joyful, when the right eye unites with the left
eye. She rests on her throne in the place for beholding the sun’s
disc, when the bright one unites with. the bright one. Her cycle
of gods is at her right hand and at her left; she protects her be—
loved son, the sun (he. not theisnnmgod but his earthly represenu
tatire, the reigning king of Upper and Lower Egypt)’. The above-
mentioned union of the right eye with the left eye, is. of the sun
with the moon, at which the New Year’s festival at Denderah took
place, is one of the astronomical epochs of the calendar veiled
in mythological language by the Egyptian priests. We next dis-
corn upon poles the images of a jachal and of an ibis, the symw
bols of Anubis as guide of the dead and of the god Thoth, which are
described in an eight—lined vertical inscription, after which the
enplanatory inscription is closed by ﬁve more lines, as follows:
‘0 Rather, than ascendest the staircase in the town of the double-
sweet life, in order to gaze upon thy father on the day ofthe New
Year’s festival. Thou betakest thyself to the roof of thy temple in

before thee, to avert harm from thy path, to purify thy way, to
cleanse thy road from evil , at the double union in the sun’s room

in thy foetal chamber (to. probably the small kiosquedike pavilion
on the roof of the temple)’. The shiatsu-mentioned Bukonkenn
were images borne upon poles .._... small ﬁgures of gods and god»
desses, sacred animals, and other symbolical objects ... which were
carried in front of solemn processions. Then follow representations
of the persons taking part in the procession; the king and queen
of Egypt, and priests and priestesses, some carrying the Buhenkenn
(thirteen. in number) or holding the prescribed adorings in their
hands, and some personating didarent gods and goddesses, and wear"
ing masks representing lions, bulls, oxen, etc. Among the latter may
be pointed out the lionwheaded person (No. 16 in order), walking
behind the chief master of ceremonies who is chanting a hymn enw
grayed on the tablet in his hand; the priestess (No. 24), hearing
a cow’s head as representing the milk-yielding Isis-cow, ‘who
nourishes the mothers with what comes from her breasts’; and the
two priests (Nos. 28, 29) with bulls’ heads, representing Apia and
Mnevis, the two sacred halls of Memphis and Heliopolis. The rear
of the procession is brought up by men bearing the sacred shrines
with the divine images. First comes the shrine with the chief image
