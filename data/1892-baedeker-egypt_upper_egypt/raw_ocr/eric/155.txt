Distribution of Time. The ruins of the city of the hundred gates are
so huge, so widely scattered, and so profoundly interesting, that at least
5—6 days are necessary to inspect the chief points alone. Those who are
specially interested in Egyptology will. of course devote a much longer
time to Thebes; weeks or even months may be spent in a careful study
of its monuments and tombs. «— Cook‘s tourist-programme devotes the
let day to the temple of Seti I. at gurnah and the Tombs of the Kings,
the return. being made at the choice of the tourist either direct or over
the hill to Der eloBahri, the Ramesseum, and the Colossi of Memnon. --
2nd day: Temple of Kat-nah; Luxor in the afternoon. W 3rd day: has
messeum, Tombs of Shekh ‘Ahd clwhurnah, Dir eloliedineh, Medinet Hahn,
and Colossi of Memnon. Those who are fatigued by the previous en-
cnrsions should at least make an short to proceed to Hedinct Hahn where
the party lunches (and in the interval visit Der el-Hedineh). --- A moon»
light ride to Kai-nah may be taken (at the tonrist‘s private expense) on
one of the evenings.

Those who are at liberty to arrange their time for themselves will
find the following programme of a Three Boys" Visit convenient.

let day. Laser and Karnak (E. bank). Though visitors are some-
times advised to reserve this, the most gigantic of the monuments, to the
last, it is really desirable to visit Kernel: ﬁrst of all, before fatigue has
begun. The traveller who visits Kernels on the ﬁrst day proceeds then
to view the other lions, with the satisfactory feeling that Thebes has
fulﬁlled his highest expectations; and he will not fail to take a later
opportunity, by moonlight or at any free time, to return to refresh and
conﬁrm his ﬁrst impression. Visitors should ride early to Karnak , while
the temple of Laser, easily reached in a few minutes from the dhahabiyeh,
may be reserved for an afternoon-visit.

d day. Cross the river early, visit the Colossi of Monsoon, the
Rsmessenm, Medinet Hahn, and no el~Medinoh, in the morning it possible,
if time permit also one of the tombs in the part of the Hours oils of
Thebes known as Kurnet Morrai‘, and finally some of the Tombs ot Shekh
‘Abd cl—liurnah. The view at sunset from this point is of incomparable
beauty and. interest.

3rd day. Cross the river early, visit the temple of Seti I. at Kurdish,
ride to the valley of the Tombs of the Kings (Brbdn el-Moltlk) with the
famous graves of the Pharaohs, then cross the ridge which divides the
latter from the other valleys of the Necropolis, and visit the terrace-temple
of Dér alohahri and some of the tombs of el-Asasit‘. A visit to the Tombs
of the Queens may be combined with an expedition to Hedinetnﬁabu.
Other 1cm important monuments may be included according to their
situation.
