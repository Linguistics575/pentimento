Miamun, who loves the Nile, the father of the gods, his creator. Long
may he lire, possessing ﬁrmness and might, eternally. Long live the
beneﬁcent god, the Nile that loves the primseval waters (Nan), the father
of the gods, who form the cycle of the nine deities, which belong to the
floods, the blessing, the abundance, the support of Egypt, who blesses
all the world with life by his rich abundance, who is digniﬁed in his
course and distributes blessings with his ﬁngers. The elect are rejoiced
at his approach. Thou art one that best created thyself, and no man
knows whence thou art. 0n the day that thou comest out of thy sur-
roundings, all the world rejoices. Thou art a lord of many fishes and
gifts, who bestowest nourishment upon Egypt. Even the nine deities
know not whence thou art. Il‘hou art their life. Therefore when thou
approachest they redouble their od‘erings; they furnish the altars richly
and raise their voices in sanitation when thou appearest. Thou metest
rich measure to us, to nourish the elect, like its when he ruled this land;
Strong and wakeful is he at all times, to seek nourishment for the living,
to make the corn abundant like the sand of the seashore, and to load
the granaries with gifts. Behold, therefore His Majesty sought how he
might exalt the father of all gods, the prince and ruler of the ﬂood, and
meditated like the god Tehuti {Thothl to ﬁnd out what was adequate to
his love (he. how he might give most adequate expression to his love).
No king has done so since thy time, 011 Ref And His Majesty spoke:
‘Whereas the Nile nourishes the world, and blessing and, abundance
follow upon his rising, and behold each one lives in his dwelling, enriched
through his command; and seeing that I know what stands in the book»
store that is preserved in the library; therefore when the Nile comes
forth from his two sources, then let the offerings to the gods be im-

creased; but if the holy stream is at Silsileh ' ...... Khennu-t),

at the right time, King Ramses II. will redouble the shortage to it there.

This king appointed two festivals to be kept at Silsileh in honour
of the Nile, as the following portion of the inscription records. One was
to be observed at the beginning of its gradual rise (the 15th Epiphi), the
other on the 15th Thoth, when the rapid rise set in. L. Stern compares
these appropriately to the two main festivals of the modern Egyptians,
the Night of the Drop, and the Getting ofths Dom, which are also two months
apart (Vol. 1., p. 239). Merenptah l. and Ramses ill. conﬁrmed the grants
made by Ramses II. for the purposes of these festivals, and erected the above-
mentioned steles in commemoration of the fact. The nature of the grants
(sacriﬁcial bread and. cakes, antelopes, beef, veal, sir kinds of wine,
honey, oil, beer, milk, essences, etc.) is recorded in the lists below the
inscriptions, from which we also learn that the king od‘ered fowls to the
river—gods and as much corn as a granary could contain to Amman of
Thebes. — The sideuwalls of the two chapels are also occupied with
scenes of sacriﬁce and worship.

Various opinions have been expressed as to the reason of the
special reverence paid to the Nile at this particular deﬁle. The
narrows of Silsileh were perhaps difﬁcult or even impossible to
pass in earliest antiquity, and so probably came to be regarded as
the second entrance of the river into Egypt, the ﬁrst being at the
cataract at Assudn. This is the more probable as Kdm Ombo was
certainly reckoned as belonging to Nubia.

Between the abovewmentioned chapels of Ramses H. and Maren-o
ptah, is a small Stole erected by the mayor Ponehesi (p. 257), who
appears here along with a son of the king accompanying the hing
before Amman. The prayer is addressed not only to Ammou, but

also to the ‘holy water’ (mu ab, seashore) audio this“ S 1’
