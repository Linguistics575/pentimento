I:
proposes to recognize in this the name, not of the builder of the inner
chambers, but of Darius I. (521486 Bil); but as this king is expressly
styled the ‘beloved of Ammon Ra, lord of Bib, strong with the sword‘,
.he is doubtless to be identiﬁed with Darius ll. who is mentioned within
the temple. Beneath, Darius, accompanied by Hathor with a sistrum and
year—rings, od‘ers to Amman Ra, lord. of the thrones of both the lands of

Darius L, or whether this belongs to Darius ll. and the name Setters to
Darius 1., must remain undecided. ‘

H. Brugsch has proved from an inscription found. at Luxor (Stole
'h‘launier), of the 25th year of Pinoeem l. (1033 B.C.), that the oasis was
used from an early period as a place of banishment. In Christian times
the schismatic Nectarine (435 All.) was banished. hither (p. 50). Christian
monks settled here, protecting themselves against the attacks of the Be-
dnins from a place of refuge on the top of the temple, traces of which
were seen by Hoskins.

At Nodomh, a little to the 8.13. of the great temple, are the ruins of
a temple of the Roman period, 9 paces long by 12 broad. It hm three
doors, above the central and more carefully built of which is the winged
sun-disc. Within the little building is ,found the name of the emperor
Aatcaiaus, which also occurs at Kass es~Zoyds (see below). He is here said
to conduct to the god. the land of Run or Hun with its possessions and
the W. land with its wines. On the outside are a few Coptic names.

Fully an hour to the N. of the town of Khirgeb, 1/, hr. from the
great temple, lies the extensive Christian Necropsits, resembling a city
with its regularly laid out streets, but now utterly devastated. At the
most only a few mortuary chapels are werth visiting. Some of the smaller
of these may have been the mansolea of particular families, but the larger
were probably sepulchral chapels in which religious services were held
in memory of the dead. About 1/4 hr. to the NW. of the necropolis is
{fear Mustcfdh Desk, an ancient Christian monastery, built entirely of brick
except the main portal, which is of hetvn stone. To the N. of it is a
[Ii/possum, 36 ft. long by ‘16 ft. bread, with three chambers on emh side.

 

About 2 hrs. to the S. of Khirgeh is the little village of Gsandh, with
250 inhabitants. The houses are covered with branches of the orangeetree
and pomegranateutree in place of roofs. The streets are so narrow as to
make it difﬁcult for a laden camel to pass through them. About 1% hr.
frmn the village are the ruins of a tensile, dating from the time of the
Ptolemies (Energetes, Philopator, and athyrus), and dedicated to the
,Theban triad, Ammoana, Math, and Khunsu. The ruins, grettily situated
on a bill, are now known as Kerr Gullah or Kerr Walt ( rawings of it,
see Boshins, plates XVII-XIX, and Cailliaud, pl. azv)‘. About 1% hr. far-
.ther is the picturesque ruin of gaps l”sin endured, a temple, enclosed by
a rough brick wall, 230 ft. long and 83 ft. broad. The entrance is on the
8. side. Within the wall is a kind of court, of unburnt bricks, 50ft.
long and 17 ft. broad, at the approach to which are fragments of stone
with part of a Greek inscription. In this court is situated the temple,
13 ft. from the girdle-wall, and entered through a pylon, 2i it. broad, with
the winged sunndisc, facing the S. The doorway, which is All/e ft. wide,

is adorned with representations of the emperor Antoninugmahing offerings
