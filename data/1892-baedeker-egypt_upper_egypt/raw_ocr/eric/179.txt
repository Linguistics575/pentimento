122 Route H. KARNAK. East Bank

The lower parts, especially in the sanctuarywchambers, are covered
with rubbish. A long List of Offerings on the left (E) exterior
wall is of some interest. It records that Ramses 111., in the month
Payni in the 16th year of his reign, decreed that gifts for his tether
Amman-Ra, the king of the gods, should be laid upon the silver
altar, such as provisions, sacriﬁcial cakes, etc. Then follow some
details (injured) as to the amount of the otterings.

3. The Portions dos Bnbastitee (Portico ofthc Bubastitcs; Pl. a),
so called by Champellion, is the part of the court between the left
(EJ wall of the temple just described and the 8. part (is. the far-
thest to the right) of the second pylon. This space, only 43 ft. wide,
had a deer admitting to the temple from the 8., and is to be regarded
as the E. and of the cclonnede which lined the S. wall of the court.
Two nnscnlptured papyrus-"bud columns divide it from the rest
of the court. Numerous inscriptions dating from the 22nd Dyna,
which originated in Bnbastis, cover the walls, and contain impetu-
tent material for the history of that period. This dynasty succeeded
the inglorious line of priest-kings, who seized the throne of Thebes
after the selfnindulgent rulers of the 20th dynasty. Their names
are rather Semitic than Egyptian , a circumstance that need cause
no surprise when we remember that Bubastis is named as their
home, a city in the E. part of the Delta which was settled by Semitic
tribes. As their names appear to be of Aramaic origin it is not
impossible that they were placed upon the throne of the Pharaohs
by the Assyrian conquerors who are mentioned in the cuneiform
inscriptions of Mesopotamia, though the Egyptian hieroglyphics
ignore them. Like their predecessors of the 21st Dyn., they retained
the chief priesthood in their own control, apparently by committing
this ofﬁce to their heirs. In the hall in which we now are the
king appears several times with the crown-prince, who is named
‘ﬂrst prophet of Ammoana’; and the crownuprince occurs also
without his father. Sheshenk I. probably began the decoration of
the building, for his name appears in the usual. place for the tie-
(titration—inscription, he. on the architrare above the columns. The
names of Osorhon I.’ and Takelut I. also occur. The lastwnemed
king appears before Amniotic—Ra accompanied by his son Georken,
clad in the priestly pantherwskin; and Oserkon also occurs alone
offering sacriﬁce in Amman. 0n the E. wall is a double painting
representing Amman to the right and left, wearing the feather-
crown and seated on a throne, while the deceased son of the some
Osorkon approaches in priestly garb to odor sacriﬁce. Beneath is a
long but unfortunately damaged Inscription, dating from the 12th
year of Takelnt ll., which mentions a remarkable event said to
have occurred in the reign of the father of that prince {probably
Shcshenk IL). The passage in question is not absolutely clear,
but this much may be gathered with certainty, viz. that on the 25th
Mesori in the 15th year of the father of Tahelut H.,,semething an»
