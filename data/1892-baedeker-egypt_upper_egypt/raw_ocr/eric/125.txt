~10th Day. Arrival at the ruins of the old temple of Berenike.

The town of Bersnihe (Benedict), situated in the same latitude as
decade, was founded in 3,0. 275 by Ptolemy Philadelphns, who revived
the commerce of the Red Sea by the establishment of several new ports.
The town, which was named by Ptolemy after his mother, survived for
400 or 50d years. . The ruins, still extant, surround the Temple which
faces the ENE. In front is a forescourt 281/2 ft. in width and 3.2 ft. in
depth, which was adjoined by the temple proper (inner length 31 ft.),
comprising two rows of apartments. The central apartment, with some
what sloping sides, seems to have been the main one, as its ri ht and
left walls and also the outside of the entrancewwall (to the is t) bear
traces of paintings, re resenting a king sacriﬁcing to various deities. The
name of the Emp. Ti cries, sacriﬁcing to the god. Khem, appears here.
The representation on the left outside-wall shows an emperor (probably
Hadrian) appearing before a goddess, who seems to be, from the legend,

the tutelary deity of the green .2- "\ use emerald mine. To the left

 

of this main apartment is a covered corridor, with a window, and ad-
jacent is a staircase leading to the roof. The temple was cleared from
rubbish in 1873 by Purdy Pasha, an American in the Egyptian serrice.

The Emerald Hines, which were visited last century by Emma (17%
”73) and in this century by Caitliaud (idle-18), Belconi, and Beechey,
were worked by the Arabs, according to Hakr'iei, down to the year 760 of
the Hegira (1370 ADJ, after which they were abandoned. homestead
rAli made an unavailing attempt to reopen them. They lie gently in the
dei Sahel and partly on the Gets! Zebdrah, id hi. to the N. . They are
best visited from Centre Apollinopolis, but may, like Berenike be ap-
proached by following the coast of the Arabian Gulf from hos r. The
ﬁrst route diverges from the road to Berenike at Photacrc. Between
Contra—Edie and the mines are three old stations. At the ﬁrst of these
is the name of a sun-worshipping king of the 18th Dynasty. Close to the
second, 13 hrs. from the Nile, is a temple hewn in the rock, the

 

of Redéstych (so called after the place of that name on the Nile, see p. n
which Seti 1. dedicated to Amines. lie recious stones are new found
in the emerald mines. To the S. of the shot Zabdreh lies the village of
habit, with the hats of miners and a rook-hows temple, with a few Gmk
inscriptions. Among these is a reference to Sample and the isis of Senskis.
