tnries has heaped itself around the temple; and later dwellings
have been erected on the top of earlier ones. This alone can explain
how the temple is now at a much lower level than the surrounding
village.

The building presented a very diﬁ‘erent appearance only thirty years
ago. Arab houses stood upon the temple itself and were built against
its walls. The interior was ﬁlled with rubbish almost up to the capitals
of the columns, and the outside was equally deeply buried. A picture of
the ediﬁce as it then was may be seen in plates id and 55 in the ﬁrst
volume of the Antiquités in the Description do I‘Eyypte. In the beginning
of the sixties, however, the entire temple was laid here by mariette under
the auspices of the Khedive, and the buildings clustering upon and around
it were removed. Now the temple of Edfu is seen in wonderful, almost
perfect preservation, exceeding that of any other Egyptian temple or even
of any antique building in the world, in spite of the $30 years that
have passed over it. From top to bottom it is covered with represen-
tations and remarkableinscriptions, the interpretation of which was
reserved for the present century, so rich in“ discoveries of every kind.

The “Temple of Edfu is superior to the temple at Dendersh in
the much greater distinctness of its sculptured reliefs and inscrip-
tions, due probably to the use of better sandstone than that of
Dcnderah which contains more lime. It is also much more complete,
for in addition to chambers corresponding to those found at Don--
dot-ah, there are at Edfu a passage running round the temple and
a lofty wall enclosing the latter, besides a spacious threw-court and
two massive pylons. (Comp. the accompanying Plan with that of
Denderah at p. 80.)

The inscriptions in the temple at Edfu have been ublished in
l)iirniehen“s Altdgyptischs Tempeh‘nschriften (113 plates; 18 1’), the geo-
graphical inscriptions in his Recast! do monuments égypticns and in J. de
Rouge‘s Edfa, from notes by his father E. de Rouge (188%). The last-
named work, however, has many errors. The important Builder's“ Inu-
scrtptions are to be found in the Aoypttcche Zettschrtﬂ for 187041-7345,
and in Brngsch’s Kalenderinschrnﬂcn (Thesaurus 11.). Mons. Neville of
Geneva has published the text of the battles of Horus at Edfu, and Lep-
sioc the ﬁrst three of the ﬁeld-texts.

The modern Arabic name of the village of Edfu is derived from

the Ceptic author, formed in its turn from the old-Egyptian

of the second district of Upper Egypt. This district, named Tee»—
Hor, ale. the district of the raising of Hornsﬁ the Apoltinopolitcs
of Greek coins,» was bounded on the S. by the Names Nubia, the
capital of which was Etcphontinc, and on the N. by Lotopoiitcs,
the capital. of which was Sent, the modern Esncb. In the great war
of the gods waged by RauHelios and his companions against the
evil SethuTyphon and his allied demons, the principal champion is
the great Horns-uApollo, who destroys the enemies of—Ra. The
