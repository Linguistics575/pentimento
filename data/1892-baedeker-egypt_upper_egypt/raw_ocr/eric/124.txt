In going from linger towards the Nile the Beduins sometimes prefer
another and more southerly route than that through the dei Earnhardt.
This diverges from the route above described at the Btr tel-Inglis in the
dei Bidets (see above} and loads at ﬁrst through the winding dei .{fohr

Caravans on the way from hoses to Esneh take a route still farther

is now seldom used.

The journey to Ber-safes, on the Arabian Gulf in 24° N. lat... and to
the emerald mines 1/2“ to the N. of it, is seldom undertaken. We may
