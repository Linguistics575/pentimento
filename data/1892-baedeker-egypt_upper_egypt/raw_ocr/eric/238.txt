immederate ﬂattery, and the absence of fact. The names of the conquered
nations are here recorded, but we learn few particulars of the course of
the were. The value of the booty is here and there indicated, but it by
no means corresponds to the gigantic achievements performed by Ramses 111.
according to the exaggerated representations of his priestly ﬁatterers.
There can be little doubt that he successfully opposed a lame of several
peoples, who attacked his kingdom by land and seat but he did not pene—
trate into the heart of Asia as his great ancestors did. and the critic
cannot avoid regarding the pecans of Medlnet Hahn. as exaggerated and
unreliable. The report on the ﬁrst pylon, referring to the victory of the
7th day of the month Mekhir in the year ii, contains some passages of
considerable poetic force.’ After relating that the enemy had intended to
settle in Egypt and to till the land as his own, the account goes on:
‘Death lurked in Tamer (Egypt) for those, who had come on their own
feet to the furnace, in which ﬁre consumed impurity under the glow of
the heroism of his majesty, who ins ired terror like Baal on high. All
his limbs are ﬁlled with the power 0 victory . . . His right hand grasps
multitudes, and over those who place themselves against him his left
hand is stretched out like missiles directed against them to slay them.
His battlewscythe (mews) mightily; like his father Month. -- Kapur (prince
of the Libyans), who came as one smitten with blindness to receive hem-
age, laid down his weapons on the ground with his warriors, and cried
aloud to heaven to beseech grace (r tehh). His son held his foot and his
hand and remained standing in his place. But the God, who knew what
was passing in his inmost mind (what was in his intestines), fell upon
their heads like a mountain of granite . . . Their blood mingled with the
earth like the overﬂowing river‘, etc. '

0n the S. or Left Pylon are similar representations. Between the
two ﬂags-studs the king appears with his fettered enemies before
the god Ptah, who aims a blow at two enemies. Beneath is another
horizontal row of ten conquered peoples, and a stole of the 12th year
of the king imitated from a stole of the 35th year of Ramses II. at
Abu—Simbel , containing a dialogue between Fish and the king.
To the left (5.) is a colossal ﬁgure of Amman-Ra, handing the sword
of victory to the king, beside six rowsof lettered enemies.

Within the gateway (Pl. d) leading to the next court is the
name of Ramses 11L, engrossed unusually deeply in the stone. The
Fore-scours (Pl. D), forming an approximate square of 115 ft., is
enclosed on all sides, and is not destitute of shade even at midday.
On the left (8.) are calyx-columns and on the right (N) are 0siris~
statues placed against pillars, which form galleries with the outer
walls. if we can. imagine this space cleared of rubbish and ruined
walls, we can form some idea of its pristine eﬁ'ect. Even as it is
it impresses the beholder, with its pylons to the E. and W. to shut
out the uninitiated, its colonnedes to the N. and 8., and its mogul—-
ﬁcent decoration in earrings and inscriptions. Here and elsewhere
at Modinet Hahn we notice that want of symmetry, which is
frequently made a reproach to the Egyptian artists; but there is no
doubt that the priestly architects deliberately here placed columns
of diﬁ‘crent forms opposite each other, with the intention of dis--
guising or relieving the uniformity dictated by the hieratic canon.

We now turn to the Inner Side of the ﬁrst pylon. To the right
we see a long hieroglyphic inscription; below, to the leggjt, the ghee
