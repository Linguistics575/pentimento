a. By Railway.

229 M. The railway-station. aster sci-Deleon which is also the start-
ing-point of the direct line to Teh el-Bdrdd and Alexandria, is situated
on the W. bank of the Nile, 3 M. from Cairo (connection with main
railway~station in prospect). Carriage from the hotel to the station a in;
for heavy luggage a second carriage is necessary, as the baggageawaggons
earshot be implicitly relied on. Passengers should be at the station early,
as the processes of ticket—taking and luggageweighing are by no means
expeditions. The ﬁrst-class carriages are, of course, the most comfortable
from a European point of view, and ﬁrst—class passengers are allowed to
take with them in their compartment all their smaller articles of baggage
and even trunks. The natives almost invariably travel seconds-class, and
those who wish to make a nearer acquaintance with the country and the
people should, perhaps, select a second-class compartment, in spite of its
offering less resistance to the incursion of the yel ow desert sand (comp.
Bacdeker‘s Lesser Egypt, p. 1). -- Fsans to Assidt: 1st class 171.8 piastres
(Turkish), 2nd class 114.5 pica, 3rd class 571 2 pias. Payment at the station
may be avoided by previously buying vonc are at the agencies of either
(look or (lace, and exchanging them at the railwayestation through the
dragoman of the agency. lIfhe trains start (1891) at 8.30 arm, 3 porn. (for
Wastah and. intermediate stations), and 7 pm. (Tues. a Frid. only). Those
who wish to go on at once by steamboat from Assidt should take the memo
ing train on the preceding day (see Introduction, p. xvi; and comp. Cook‘s or
Gene‘s Tourists‘ Prcgramme). The journey to Assidt takes nominally 10hrs.,
hot the trains are generally late. A timetable showing the names of stations
in French and Arabic and giving distances in English miles is published
by Penasson of Alexandria and may be bought at the ticket-ofﬁces. Trav-
ellers should provide themselves with a supply of meat, bread, and Wine,
as no stoppage is made for dinner, eggs, bread, water (glass necessary) are
altered for sale at the stations. Seats should at ﬁrst be taken on the right
side fer the sake of the View of the Pyramids; from Minyeh onwards the
left side is preferable, for the views of the Nile valley and Benihasan. -—--
The railway follows the course of the Nile pretty closely, and a sufﬁcient
idea of the views from the carriage-windows may he obtained. from the
account of the dhahabiyeh ‘voyage below. The following is a list of the rail-
way-stations, nearly all of which are also steamer-stations. For descrip»
