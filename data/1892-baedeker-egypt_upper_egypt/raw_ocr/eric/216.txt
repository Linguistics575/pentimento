famous sound. The oldest inscription dates from the 11th year of Nero‘s
reign. --- hiany of the great ofﬁcials who visited the marvels of Thebes were
accompanied. by their wives. Thus Lucius Junius Calvinus and his wife
minicia Rustica,‘in the ith year of Vespasian, heard the phenomenon at the
second hour, though most other visitors heard it at the morning-hour,
he. at or soon after sunrise. The colossus was frequently dumb, in which
case the visitor usually waited until a more favourable occmion. Early
were so struck with the phenomenon that they were not content till they
had heard it three or four times. Hadrian, whojourneyed through Egypt
in 1% All... spent several days here along with his wife Sabina and a
large retinue. In his reign a perfect flood of verses spread over the legs
of the colossus, most of them by the vain court-poetess Baltiifa, the de-
scendant of a noble house, as she is careful to mention. One of her
ed’usions (on the left leg) relates in 16 hexameters, that Hemnou greeted
Hadrian, as well as he could (sit buvcrdv) when be perceived the emperor
before sunrise, but that a clearer note, like that caused by a blow on an
instrument of copper, was emitted at the second hour, and that even a
third sound was heard. Hadrian greeted Hemuon as often, and all the
world could see how dear the emperor was to the god.
‘Balbilla, by an inward impulse stirred?
‘Has written all she saw and all she heard“.

By far the best verses are those on the front of the pedestal by Ace
sleptodotns, who calls himself imperial procurator and poet. They may
be translated as follows: --~

‘Sea—born Thetis, learn that Hemnon dudes-ed never pangs of dying‘.

‘Still, where Libyan mountains rise, sounds the voice of his loud oryiug‘ .......

‘(Honntains which the Nile-stream, loving, parts from Thebes, the hun-
dred-gated)‘I us

‘When he glows, through rays maternal with warm light illuminated‘.

‘But thy son who, never-sated, dreadful battle still was seeking‘,

‘Dumh in Troy and Thessaly, rests now, never speaking”.

(in the right leg of the colossus is a curious “Homeric” poem, inscribed
by a certain Antes, and made up of four lines from the Iliad and Odys-
sey, pieced together by the post so as to express his meaning:

‘Alas, a mighty wonder I there behold with mine eyes"
(It. xiii, 99)
‘Trnly a god is here, a noble inhabitant of heavenl’
(0d. air, 40)
‘Loud he raises his voice, and stays the msgmblpd multitude‘.

‘Neyor could a mortal man accomplish such a thiiig as this”.
(0d. xvi, 196).

The ruins in the neighbourhood of the colossi are unimportant.
About 3 min. beyond them is another Statue of great size, now,
however, almost completely covered by arable land. Farther to the
NW. are very numerous smaller statues. The ruined Amcmphium,
at the gates of which the abovenmentioned statues stood, has left so
important memorial in the shape of a conSpicuous colossal Sund-
stoac State, erected by Amenhotep ill. it now has its broadest
surface uppermost, and is covered with hieroglyphics in the grand
style, which, with the representations, refer to the dedication of the
temple. In the rounded pediment the Pharaoh appears receiving
the symbol of life from Ammon on the right, and from Sekar~Osiris
on the left; above are the winged sunwdisc and the name of Amen-
hotop HI. Behind the Pharaoh in each case is his consort Tii,
adorned with the featherncrown. The ﬁrst line of the inscription
contains the pompous titles of the king; the second begigs-«a 1 $8:
