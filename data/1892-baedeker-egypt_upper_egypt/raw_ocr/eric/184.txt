and sometimes scratching out older names. 011 the capitals the
cartouches of Ramses H. or of his more immediate successors are
found; on the border of the extreme top of the shaft, this same
Phareah is usually named king of Upper and Lower Egypt, lord of
both worlds, son of the sun, lord of the diadems, etc. The broader

twice; once sacriﬁcing to the god, and once with. the cclestlals
oﬁering him emblems, generally symbolizing in some familiar way
one of the higher blessings of life. The simple inscriptio ,
each other over and over again. They begin: ‘1 give ‘1 ‘1
grant thee’, or else mention a visit of the king to the temple. The
carvings and hieroglyphics placed by Ramses H. are much inferior
to those dating from. the reign of hisfathcr Seti L, a fact we have
already noticed at Abydos.

By far the most important place among the gods here is ﬁlled
by Ammon, Mutb, and Khunsu, the Theban triad (Vol. 1., p.138).
At Karnak Amman was conceived of in two capacities, which must
be distinguished from each other; he was in the ﬁrst place Amman
Generator, in the second place Ammonulte, the king of the gods.
Amman may be identiﬁed by his featherucrown, Khuusu by the
creScent on his head and the lock on his temples, and Math by the
vulture-weep. The other gods that appear with them may be easily
identiﬁed with the help of the introduction on the Religion of
Ancient Egypt (Vol. 1., p. 124). 011 the architrave are some clearly
cut inscriptions, of which a few deviate from the usual formulae.
011s of these, dating from Seti 1., on the srchitrave above the bud-
columns in the ﬁrst crossurow to the E. (right), is as follows: ‘He
is a king, mounting his horse like the son of leis (Horus). He is
an archer of a mighty arm and like the (god of war) Mentu a great
wall of brass. He is the protector of his soldiers, when they thirst
in the hollow way, on the day of battle. No opposition is adored
to him from the hundred thousand brave hearts that are united in
one place’. In the inscriptions the king usually boasts of having
erected an eternal and magniﬁcent building in the house of his
father Ammon, of founding festivals, or of sharing great treasures.
