The information as to the Egyptian monetary system given on
pp. 4, 5 of our ﬁrst vol., has to be supplemented by the statement
that the Egyptian Government has recently issued new silver coins
and some gold coins, and that these new form the only legal ouru
renoy throughout the Whole country , where their value is uniform.
The unit of reckoning is still the Piostre (Arabia Ghirsh, plur.
Glmssh). The Egyptian Pound is divided into 1.00 piastres or
1000 Milliimes.
