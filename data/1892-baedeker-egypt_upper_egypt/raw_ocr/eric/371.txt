of Ramses IL, visited this island and recorded the festivals of his
father. Digniﬁed ofﬁcials of the 23th Dyn. celebrated themselves

The island ofKenesso (called by the ancients A

chwt), whose name seems to be connected with Rush and Roads,
also contains numerous Rock Inscriptions, some dating as in back
as the ﬁlth and 12th Dynasties. Several long inscriptions of the
18th Dyn. have been preserved. One of 13 lines celebrates the
victory of Amenhotep 1H,, represented in the colossi of Mom-non,
over the Kushites or Ethiepians. Konosso was also visited by pile
grime down to the 26th Dynasty.

The island of Sahel, which contains many peculiar kinds of
stone, may be reached by the dhahabiyehs. Its rugged rocks abound
with inscriptions, mostly of the 18th and 19th Dyna, though the
earliest date from the 13th, while a few were inscribed under the
20th and 21st. This island was specially dedicated to the cataract-
god Khnum and to the goddesses desks and Sail.
