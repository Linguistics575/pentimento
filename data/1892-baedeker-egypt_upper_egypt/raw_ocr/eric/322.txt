which not more than the common rd records on, an act of reverence or
worship, stood. The inscriptions are found or miles, scratched on the
rocks and megs of the low hills skirting the river; they are most
numerous to the N. of the villages:-

A little to the N. are several Greek Inscriptions, ﬁrst discovered by

On the W. bank, 1/4 hr. above eluﬁﬁsh and about 3/, hr. below
Silsileh, is a gorge known as Shatt ere-Regal, ‘Shore of the Men’,
or eo- sab’d reydt, ‘the seven men’. 0n the left side of a (did here,
a few paces from the river-bank, is a most interesting relief (also

This Mentuhotep, with the stad of empire in his hand, was an ima-
portant king at the close of the 11th Dyan, and his name is mentioned in
all the extant lists of kings. A stole (now at Turin) dating from the iﬁth
year of his reign attests his long and. prosperous role. He seems to have
been the ﬁrst monarch after a long interval (Stir—11th Dyn.) to unite the
whole kingdom under a single empire... and he is thus a worthy predecessor
of the Amenemhas and Usertesens of the 12th Dynasty.

0n the right site of the slid is the name of Penott, an architect
who worked under Amenhotep 1., Tutmes 1., and Tutmes H. Farther
up in the some valley occur the signatures of other royal ofﬁcials,
and. also (according to Patric) the joint cartouches of Hatasu
and. Tutmes Hi, with another mention of Peneti below them. —-—-

who also discovered other hings’ names, some hitherto unknown, on
these rocks.

on the W. bank on which the most interesting monuments lie, we
should not omit to visit also the E. bank, where there are larger
quarries than on the Libyan side.

At Gehet Sitstleh begins the Sandstone Zone of the Nile valley (Vol 1.,
d. 56). The rocky hills which here conﬁne the bed. of the river supplied.
