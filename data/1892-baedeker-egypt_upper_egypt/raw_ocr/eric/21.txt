Holders of Cooks’ tickets may break their journey at Lunar or
Assnan either on the way up or the way down (after previous are
rangement with Cooks’ manager in Cairo), and proceed by a subu-
sequent steamer, if there are vacant berths. The maﬂusteamers,
usually less crowded than the others, may he need in descending
the stream. In all these deviations from the usual tours, very strict
adherence to the terms of the special arrangement is exacted. Trava-
ellers are strongly recommended. to time their voyage so as to an-
rive at Lunar 3-4 days before full moon ; for moonlight adds a pen-
culiar charm to a. visit to the ruins here and at Arenas.

Passengers by steamer should beware of the risk of catching
cold by leaving the windows of their cabin open. They should also
avoid placing themselves too near the edge of the deck; and it is
well to remember (as. when shaving) that the steamers frequently
ran aground, especially above Loner. Liability to delay through
this last fact, makes it impossible to be sure of reaching Cairo in
time to make connection with the ocean-steamers.
