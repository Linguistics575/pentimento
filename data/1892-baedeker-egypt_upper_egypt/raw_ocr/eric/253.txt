18. The Tombs of Shékh ‘Abd ole-Kernel)...

With this part of the Necropolis of Thebes, which may be reached
from Der elwhiedineh in 25 min, we conclude our ﬁrst day on the W. bank
in our three days’ plan. Gore’s tourists make it their second day, Cook‘s
begin their third day with the Bamessenm (it. 13) and the tombs of
‘Abd elsgumah, as in our ﬁve days plan. The tombs to be visited may
be found without a guide. They are reached by ascending the E. side of
the Libyan mountains in a direct line from the Ramesseurn. Many of the
tombs here are inhabited by felldh‘in. The sepulchral chambers serve
as dwellingvplaces, wooden doors are hung in the entrances, and the
fore-court is often enclosed by a clay well for the conﬁnement of their
live stock. in front of most of these cave-dwellings stand covered up
linders like gigantic mushrooms, of Nile mud and straw kneaded ton
gather. These are the primitive granaries of the inhabitants of i’Abd el-
Kurnah, several of whom are well~to-dc, with houses of Nile bricks, con-
spieuous from. a considerable distance. Those who are desirous of staying
any length of time should make arrangements with the wealthy and worthy
Cept, Teams, uncle of the German consular agent at honor. The erec-
tion of a house for travellers has been under consideration, and would
be of especial benefit to scholars by sparing them the daily journey to
and from Lusor. Shelter may be found in the house of Muhammad 'Ahd.

ars have chosen ‘Abd-el-hurnah as their centre for investigations on the
W. hank, among them. Champollion, Wilkinson, Lepsius (whose lodging
in the tombs is still known by the felldhin as the gear Lepsius), Prissc
. d’Avennes, and Ebers. The visitor to the tombs must ﬁrst face some
savage dogs, but he will be thoroughly repaid partly by the interest which
some of the tombs aﬁ‘ord, and partly by the magniﬁcent “View which is
obtained from those in the higher positions, especially at sunset. In this
part of the Necropolis of Thebes were buried the wealthy nobility of the
8th Dye, upon whose tombs large sums of money must have been spent.
The inscriptions record that the deceased were in their lifetime invested
with the highest spiritual and temporal dignities and that they enjoyed
almost royal estates, their pride in which they show in sculptures and
inscriptions. However death is not forgotten in these tombs, for there is
no lack of funereal epitaphs. In almost all of thorn too we ﬁnd. genea-
logical tables, by which we learn that many of those buried here were
related to each other.

The more important tombs were numbered by Wilkinson, but most
of the ﬁgures have been obliterated. In 1885 Prof. Eisenlohr renumbered
the tombs, in all 1127, including those with no inscriptions. In the follow-
ing description}. of the tombs reference is made to these numbers, which
appear in the adjoining small plan. If time is limited, it will be sufd~
cient to visit the tombs of Kha-emvhat, Ramses, chht, Sen-waster, Anna,
Horemheb, and Ramenkhepersencb.

The traveller is recommended to begin with two tombs on the

eastern side of the hill behind the Ramosseum. The one to the loft
is that othaucma-hat a 5: it (No.120), superinton-s
dent of the royal granaries, of the time ofhmenhotep Hi. The tomb
has been long known, and in consequence is much injured. it lies
behind a square court cut out of the hill, and has two other tombs
near it.

The tomb of Kha-enrhd’t consists of three halls lying one behind the
other, the ﬁrst and third of which are at right angles to its 1 h Un
