of Isis. PHELAE 29. Route. 297

ou‘t.~ Although exception may be taken to the height of the about
and. to many other points, no one who has visited Philn will forget
this little temple, least of all if he have seen it by moonlight.

In the NE. of the island are the ruins of a village and of buildings
of various kinds. In the extreme RE. is a Roman Triumphsl Arch (Pl. b),
with a lofty middle portal ﬂanked by lower wings. The structure, which
has'also been taken for a oityvgate, faces the 193., rte. the well-fortiﬁed
bank of the Nile. The S. wing is in good preservation but is somewhat
clumsy. Above it is a brick dome supported on sandstone crlnsoles. It
is possible that Diocletian passed beneath the central arch when he
visited the sacred island of Philm. His name, at all events, is to be
found on the blocks of sandstone scattered on the ground i.

The huge heaps of ruins scattered over the island defy description,
and contain little of interest. On the other hand study may well be
devoted to the numerous Inscriptions in demotio, Greek, Latin, Coptic,
and Arabic. Some of the Greek inscriptions are elegant. The Verses
of Utilities screamed Nicanor, son of Nicanor, who lived 7 3.0., are err-
sellout; and his aerostics display considerable skill.

The Cataract Islands.

The islands in the neighbourhood of Philze are picturesque, but
a visit to them can be recommended only to Egyptologists and goo-
logists, for they contain nothing but rocks with a few inscriptions

carved upon them.

Bigeh, called by the ancient Egyptians W 5'3 Senomw-t, lying

opposite Philn, is the most easily accessible. it is reached in about
two minutes from Phihe, of which it commands a picturesque view,
as Philm does of it,with its bars rocks and ruined buildings. Bigeh
enjoyed a very early reputation for peculiar sanctity, and we‘have
already seen (p. 294) that one of the symbolise} sources of the Nile
was located here. Various Rock Inscriptions and also the hiero-n
glyphics on a granite Statue of Osiris found here record that as
early as the 18th Dyn., under Amenhotep H. and Amenhotep Ill,
this island was visited by pilgrims and was provided with temples.
The deities chieﬂy worshipped in the latter were the ram’s-headed
Khnum, god of the cataracts, and 3 Rather. Senem was not regarded
as belonging to Egypt but to Koch, in. Ethiopia, or Tax-keno, with
which the modern Kcnds may be compared. Among the pilgrims,
whose names are found on Bigeh, were several governors of Ethic-
opia, who were usually royal princes. The ruins of the Temple
visible from Philaz, in which the name of Ptolemy Neos Dionysus
is of most frequent occurrence, are new inhabited by an obliging
Nubian family, only a few of whose members understand anything
but Kends. The most interesting remains here are Two Columns,
with unsculptured Ptolemaic capitals and a Portal with a carefully
built arch, adorned with a Greek ornament. Adjoining the latter is
a House built of bricks, Nile-"mud, and broken stones, in which is
