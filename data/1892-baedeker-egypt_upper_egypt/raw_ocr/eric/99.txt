Mandel), they could have found no more suitable spot for a settlement
than the neighbourhood of Abydos, where the fertile W. bank of the Nile
expands and oﬂ'ere easy cultivation and excellent dwellingvsites, removed
from all danger of inundation. This is the most ancient town in Egypt,
and its neighbour Abydos cannot have been much younger, for even in
the time of the early empire it is frequently spoken of as a holy
city. It possessed the most famous grave of Osiris, of which it was
believed that burial in its vicinity or consecration in its sanctuary went
far in ensuring a favourable jndgment in the world to some. From an
early period the grandees of the land caused their mummies to be brought
hither --- oi‘ten, however, for a limited. time only, directing that, as soon
as the wished~for blessings had been received from Osiris, the bodies
should be carried back to their ancestral burialngrounds. Mariette has
proved that the town itself (Egypt. Able) was never of any great ex-
tent. The extant ruins extend from el-Kherbeh on the NW. to ‘Arabat
elshladfdneh on the 8.3. If, however, Abydos was small in the number
of its citizens, it was great through the importance of the gods wor-
shipped in its temples. Each of the 42 names of Egypt possessed its
temple of Osiris; but none of them, except that of Sokar in Memphis,
rivalled in sanctity that of Abydos. The testimony of the monuments is
conﬁrmed by the classical writers. Herodotus left Upper Egypt unde—
scribed, because Hecattsns had already treated of it, but we quote the
celebrated passage in which the trustworthy Strabo speaks of Abydos:
cAbove it (Ptolemai‘s) lies Abydos, the site of the Memnoninm, a wonderful
palace of stone, built in the manner of the Labyrinth, only somewhat
less elaborate in its complexity. Below the Memnonium is a spring,
reached by passages with low vaults consisting of a single stone and.
prominent by their extent and mode of construction. This spring is
connected with the Nile by a canal, which ﬂows through a grove of
Egyptian thorn—acacias, sacred to Apollo. Abydos seems once to have been
a large city, second only to Thebes, but now it is a small place, etc.‘
Abydos is also mentioned by Pinter-ch, Athenssns, Stephanos of Byzantium,
Ptolemy, Pliny, and others. Ammianus Marcellinns speaks of the oracle
of the god Bess, which ﬂourished here.

The ordinary traveller, especially when he has at his disposal
only the 8 hrs. allowed by the steamer, will conﬁne himself to the
Memnoninm of Seti 1. (Pl. 1) at ‘Aribst el—Madfﬁnoh and the sadly
dilapidated Temple of Ramses H. (Pl. H). The remains of the
so-called Temple of Osiris at ethhcrbeh (Pl. 1H) and the adjacent
site"of Marlette’s excavations in the ancient necropolis among the
Libyan hills are rapidly becoming less and less interesting through

the steady encroachment of the desert sand.

The Momentum of Seti I.

This noble structure, which, from the time of Strabo onwards, has
been visited and described by so many travellers, did not become folly
known to the modern world till Mariette Bey, with characteristic judg-
ment and erseverance and supported by the generosity of the Khodive,
began. in 1 the task of freeing it from the sand. His plan of isolating
the building by digging a trench round and preventing new assume.»-
lations of sand was not carried wholly into chest, but still, with the ex-
ception of portion of the outside of the N. wall of the second court,
there is now no part of the temple where inscriptions are likely to
be found that does not stand open to the explorer. The difﬁculty of the
excavations was much incrmed by the fact that the back part of the
temole was buried in the slope of the hill, in such away that it looked
like a gigantic sepnlchral chapel forming the vestibule to a mighty rock—
tomb in the bowels of the mountain. Mariette believes, and probably
with justice, that this peculiarity of the bismnoninm paplains the name
