011 the pillar between the two columns to the right of the enn-
trance to the main temple is another Greek inscription. This is a
decree of Aurelius Besarion, also named Amonius, military governor
of Ombos and. Elephantine, ordering the owners of swine to remove
their animals from the holy Talmis. It probably dates from the
year 248-9 AD. -—-—- On. the left side of the elegant entrancewdoor

Beside him stands Hor-si-isi (Home, son of Isis), the lord of Talmis.
Leasing now the entranceu-wall with its four columns behind us,
we ﬁnd ourselves in the main building of the temple, ~ the portion
proper, which is 40 it. deep and 66 ft. broad. This portion is com
siderably higher than the three rooms behind it, from which a
double staircase ascends to the roof (new fallen) of the parties. it
has four, or including those of the entrance wall six, elegant co-
lumns "on each side, with varying capitals. Only two, on the left,
are new standing in the interior. 0n the E. wall the emperor ap~
pears sacriﬁcing to the gods of Talmis, and adjoining this scene is
the aborewmentioned relief of Amenhotep II. presenting wine and
milk to KhemhAmmon. m The next three rooms are small (171/2 it
deep and 40 ft. wide), and have sacriﬁcial scenes on their walls.
Each probably contained two columns, those in the second room
being still preserved. The staircase to the roof ascended to the left
from the ﬁrst room. (in the outside of the W. backuwall of the
temple areyarious well—preserved representations, including the god-
dess Isis with Ptolemy Caesarion, son of Julius Caesar and. Cleopatra.
The temple, like that of Edfu, is surrounded by a passage, widen-
ing towards the rear and entered from the fore-court by doors on both
sides; and, as mentioned above, there is also a second. and wider
passage outside the ﬁrst one, with which it has communication by
means of a door on the left side. This outer passage could be closed
by means of doors. The whole structure is a faithful reproduction
of an early Egyptian temple, but dates from Roman times.

 

The little *Temple of Bet el~=Walli, situated upon a hill about
‘20 min. to the N., is much more noteworthy than the large Roman
erection at Kalabsheh. The way to it leads along the verge of the
mountain, level at ﬁrst, but ﬁnally ascends steeply. The temple
consists of a vestibule, of which only the side walls are now stand-
ing, a main chamber, entered by a central and two side doors, and a
small adytum, adjoining the latter. In the vestibule our interest is
excited by the warlike scenes on the side-walls. These indicate
