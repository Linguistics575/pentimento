stale of Piankhi. The whole province was at ﬁrst called the lake-land,
then the district of Crocodilopolis, and lastly the Arsinoite Nome. The
deity most highly revered here was the crocodilenheaded Sebek, the rep-
tile sacred to whom was carefully tended in Lake hlmris. At the same
time the voracious and dangerous monster, notwithstanding the reverence
paid to it on acconnt of its connection with the inundation, was also
regarded as Typhonic, and the Crocodilopolitan nome was therefore
passed over in the lists of nomes. ..... At the period preceding that of the
Psamtikides of the 26th Dynasty the Labyrinth appears to have been need
as a hall for great imperial assemblies. At the period of the Ptolemies
and the Romans the products of the Fay'dm were much extolled. “The
Arsinoite Nome”, says Strobe, ‘is the most remarkable of all, both on sea
count of its scenery and its fertility and cultivation. For it alone is
planted with large, full-grown, and richly productive olive~trees, and the
oil is good when careful} prepared; those who are neglectful may in-
deed obtain oil in than once, but it has a bad smell. In the rest of
Egypt the olive-tree is never seen, except in the gardens of Alexandria,
where under favourable circumstances they yield olives, but no oil. Vines,
corn, podded plants, and many other products also thrive in this district
in no small abundance”. —- Strabo‘s description is still applicable at the
present day. The oranges and mandarins, peaches, olives, ﬁgs, castes
trait, omegranates, and grapes grown here are mach esteemed, and the
beanti n1, rich-coloured red roses of the gardens of the Faydm, which
were once so lavishly strewn at the banquets of Cleopatra, still thrive
here. At the station of Medinet el—Faydm small phials of attar of roses,
of inferior quality, are frequently od‘ered for sale. Ismail]. Pasha devoted
special attenﬁon to this favoured part of his dominions. The ﬁelds, which
are watered by means of wheels of peculiar construction, yield rice, sugar,
cotton, ﬂax, and hemp, besides the canal cereals. The beginning of New
vember is probably the season at which the traveller will obtain the most
distinct idea of the fertile character of the district. ....... The Inhabitants
are felldhin, or tillers of the soil, and Bednins. To the latter race be-
long the poor ﬁshermen who inhabit the banks of the Birhet names.
Many of the peasants also call themselves tombs”, and the wealthier of
them are generally well mounted.
