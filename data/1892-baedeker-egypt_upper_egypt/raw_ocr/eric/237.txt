his enemies. To the left, he again receives the scoptre and leads
behind him captive islanduprinces.

The Inrsmon of the pavilion can only be gained from one of
the walls of the court to our left as we enter. The attempt is not
without difﬁculty; and some of the rooms are not accessible at all.
In several of the apartments are wellmpreserved wall—sculptures of no
little interest; up. in the apartment above the passage and in the
right wing. Ramses III. is here represented in his harem. Thenude
maidens with whom he is playing chose (the scene in the ruined N.
entrance-room to the right is well soon from before the facade of the
building), or who hand to him one a ﬁg, another a pomegranate,
another a melon, another a ﬂower which he smells, appear from the
shape of their faces and. from the arrangement of their hair to be
captive princesses rather than his own children. This supposition
is farther strengthened by the occurrence here of several reproach-
tations of a distinctly immodest character.

The vicious propensities of this hing are bbeted with biting scorn
on other monuments. He himself appears to ave looked. with peculiar
pride upon his harem, which was rich in beauty of all kinds, and to have
immortalized its memory in his Memnonium. At all events his reign

marks the beginning of an epoch of luxury and. immorality, upon which
decay follows close.

After passing through the gateway a, we traverse an open Space
between the pavilion and the ﬁrst pylon. Before we reach the pylon,
210 ft. wide, which conceals the ﬁrst peristyle court, we pass a num—
ber of ruined walls of baked and unbahed bricks, which belonged
to the Captic village built within the temple. In front, to the left,
is a small Temple of Ameniritis (28th Dye), to the rights block
with the cartonohe of Nectanebns 11. Behind is the temple founded
under the 18th Dyn., which we visit later (p. 184). Standing on
the rubbish heap in front of the ﬁrst pylon and looking through the
gateway into the temple, our view penetrates to the last court. There
is no more remarkable perspective in Egypt.

b. Large Temple of Ramses m.

The large First Pylon (Pl. 0) is covered with representations
and inscriptions. First to the right we see the Pharaoh as the con-
queror of his enemies, and opposite is Animus-Ra, the king of the
gods, holding in his right hand. the carved sword, in his left the
sceptre, and several wallwrings surmounted by boats of their princes.
In the ﬁrst we read the name of Punt or Arabia, which, how--
ever, must be here interpreted in a narrow sense, as equivalent to
the coastlands oi" the Red Sea. Between the king and the group of
his enemies is the inscription: ‘He strikes to the earth the princes
of all lands’, beneath which is a horizontal row of ﬁgures of some
tribes ( partly damaged). Beneath that again is the chief Inscription,
from the lith year of the king, relating his great deeds.

All the inscri tions in Hedinet Hahn differ from tbp reportp of view
