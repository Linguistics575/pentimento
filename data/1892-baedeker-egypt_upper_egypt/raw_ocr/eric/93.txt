which the representation occurs, bear pictures of Animus.
‘ At the beginning of the present century an interesting temple stood.
on the site of the old town of which the last column was washed away
by the Nile in 1821. Joiner , who described this temple during the French
Expedition, when the water already lapped its foundations, foretold its
fate. The temple was dedicated. by Ptolemy Philometor and. his wife
Cleopatra to Antares and was restored by Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and
his colleague Verne (164 Ail). This information was conveyed by a
double inscription, in Greek and in hieroglyphics, over the portal. The
halls of the hieroglyphic inscription , , 1 (Ede) probably
denoted the name of the town. The temple was built of limestone and
was at least 225 ft. long, 52 ft. wide, and 51 it. high. Its entrance faced
the river. The 18 columns, which were arranged in 3 rows, were 37 it.
high, with a diameter of 271/4 fit, and. ended in palm-deaf capitals. If the
gigantic blocks that Jomard found on the ground were really parts of
the ceiling, they exceeded in size those of Kai-nah, which now excite
our astonishment. ﬁne of them was 32 ft. long, 4314 ft. high, and. 51/4. ft.
thick, and must have weighed at least 48 tons.

To the S. of Kin elaKehir the Nile makes a‘bend to the W. and.
forms an island by dividing into two branches. 0n the W. cm (W.
bank), to the N. of the island, lies Eda cl-Ghorhi (W. lien), the
seat of a rebellion in 1865, which hadimportant consequences for
all the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and about which the Oriental

The felldhin scarcely venture to utter the name (Ahmed Tayib)’of
the hero of this uprising, but speak of him with hated breath as a
Messiah, who will one day return. He is said to be still living, in.
Abyssinia. High up on the S. side of the hill of Kan are some
more rock—tombs. .

Tahtah, situated ‘2. M. inland, with 3000 inhab. and. a frequented
cattleumarhet. ,

On the E. bank, a little higher up, rises the Gate! Shift}: clu-
Harideh, with ancient quarries and (high up) tombs hcwn in the
rock, the openings of which are visible from the river. The material
of which the temple of Antmopolis was built was procured in the
large quarries on the S. side of the mountain, and consists of a
hard, ﬁnemgrained, grey shellulimestone, which smells unpleasantly
when rubbed but admits of a splendid polish. -—-~ The next steam“
boat stations are cl-Meroghdt and Showdowns, both on the W. bank.
A large market is held in the latter every Saturday. On the E. bank
of the stream, which here encloses several islands, are some rock:-
tombs, without inscriptions. '
