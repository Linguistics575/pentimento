of Khmer. (Pl. V), the portal of which we have already seen on our
way from Loser to the river~front of the great temple of Ammon.
An avenue of sphinxos, approximately parallel with the above-amen-
tionod avenue between Pylon XI and the temple of Math, leads to
the slender Ptolemaic Pylon XII and beyond it to the temple of
Khunsu preper, which lies a little farther N. The temple is beautim
fully proportioned, in many places adorned with remarkable care,
and in various respects of great interest. It was erected by Ram-—
ses HI. in honour of Khunsu, is. the god who represents, so to
speak, the youthful Amman in the triad of Thebes. Elsewhere, it
may here be noted, Khunsu is conceived of almost as the moon~god
(with the child’s lock. of hair on his temple and the crescent-unless.
on his head), and thus identiﬁed with Thom-Hermes. Just as
Amman is called the soul of Ra, so Khunsu is to be regarded as the
spiritual quintessenco of the earlier moonwgod, and may be named,
like Thoth, ‘the representative of the spirit, the ratio interns of all
things‘. As Po or arbiter or ‘planmmaker’ he guides the deliberations
of mortals, and he becomes also the divine physician (Khunsu ncfer
hotsp, ‘tho good helper”), who consideratoly restores the sick to
health. Cynocephali, sacred to Khunsu as well as to Thoth, were
kept here. ....._.. In the great Harris Papyrus Ramses HI. says of this
temple: ‘1 built a house in Thebes for thy son Khunsu, of good hewn
stone, of sandstone, black stone, its doors covered with gold, adorned
with electrum like the celestial horizon’. In the same document it is
named Po (house) Ramses {salt on in Pa Khunsu with 284 persons;
and afterwards: ‘Porsons whom he (Ramses Ill.) gave to Po Khunsu
in Use Neforhoiep, Her lord of the wide heart, 249’. There thus
appear to have been two diﬁerent temples erected to Khunsu. The
inscriptions inform us that he had not time to ﬁnish. the ‘House
of Khunsu’, but was obliged to leave later rulers to complete the
Pcristyle Court and the Pylon. The last was erected by the priest~
king Pinozom, son of Piankhi, of the 21st Dyn.; but Alexander H.
is also commemorated in the doorway to the peristyle court. This
court itself has on three sides a double row of papyrus-«bud columns,
six in each row. From the inscriptions we gather that after por-
tions of this building were built by various Ramses of the 20th Dyn,
the priest-king Harbor, predecessor and perhaps grandfather ofPino-
rem, contributed to its decoration. Most of what we know of the
kings of the 21st Dyn. is derived from the inscriptions here.

The close connection which must at that time have existed between
Asia and the Nile valley is proved. by a diets found in the temple of
Khunsu and now preserved in the Blbliotheque Nationals at Paris. Upon
this one of the last kings of the 20th Dyn. records that he married the
daughter of a tributary prince, made her his queen, and in order to cure
her younger sister who was possessed by devils (is. insane) sent ﬁrst a
physician and then a statue oftKhunsu to Bekhten. After the healing godahad

one what was expected of hem , the fathor~ln~law of the Pharosb dotsmed

the status until he was warned in a dream to send it back to BMW in
its sacred boat.

The peristylo court is succeeded by a narrow Hell
