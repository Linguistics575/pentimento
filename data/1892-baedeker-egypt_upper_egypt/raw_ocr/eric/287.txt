a few tombs at elu- are 123211.25 2:2 5 y Visitbﬂ by the ordinary traveller.
Some belong to the 18th and 19th Dyn., but the most important
are of the 26th. Broken walls seem to indicate that the cemetery
was divided into sections. We also ﬁnd here various brick. buildm
logs and a large arched doorway. During Mariette’s excavations
many mummies were found. not in regular tombs, but either in the
earth itself, or in small vaults 3 to 6 ft. below the surface. In some
of them, papyruswrolls of great value were discovered. The tomb of .

at Blbin el-Muluk, and 1s worth a vrsrt on account of its great size.
Petamenap was a prince of the empire and an ofﬁcial of the 26th
Dyan, whose remarkable position entitled him to the unusual honour
of completing buildings at the temple of Medinet-Habu, and of
placing his name upon them. The tomb is cut out of remarkably
beautiful limestone; and its inscriptions display the neatness of
ﬁnish which is peculiar to the sculptures of the Egyptian renais-n
sauce. It has become the home of thousands of bats, which render
the attempt to copy the inscriptions in the inner rooms very difﬁcult
by constantly extinguishing the light. The smell, moreover, which
they cause is so strong and odensive that a thorough inspection of
the tomb is recommended only to those who can overcome the feel-
ing of nausea. Any one who is subject to giddiness should avoid
going far into the tomb, as in the middle it is necessary to balance
oneself, though only for a few stops, along a narrow path on the
edge of a deep shaft. Sir Gardner Wilkinson undertook the measure-
ment of the tomb, and the inscriptions have been almost completely
copied and partly published by Diimichen. These are important
chieﬂy for the details of the funeral ceremonies.

The entrance, as in almost all the tombs in this part of the noose»
polio, is by an open courtyard without walls, 103 ft. wide and 76 it. deep,
which leads to a hall in the rock (me mortuary chapel), with side-
chambers and passages. This is 6‘? ft. wide by 53 it. deep, and its roof
is supported by two rows of pillars. All the walls are ornamented with
inscriptions and reliefs carefully executed, but new unfortunately much
injured and blackened. These, almost without exception, refer to the fate
of the soul in the lower world. ~— A vaulted Gorridcr leads into a second
large Room (dd ft. by 37 ft.) in which 8 pillars remain to prevent the root
from falling, while in the Room adjoining it, 32% ft. square, only 4 have
been spared. A Chamber with niches (21 ft. by 12 it.) concludes this series
of rooms, the total length of which together with the courtyard is 312 ft.
The nature of the stone having apparently prevented further advance into
the rock in this direction, the masons turned to the left and dug out a
wide Hall, and also to the right, where six successive Passages were
made at right angles leading to a small room. Those not being on the
same level were connected by ﬂights of res ctively 9, 23, and 9 steps.
In the small room mentioned is a shaft it. deep with a chamber.
Caution is necessary here. This series of assages is 177 ft. in length.
From the room containing the shaft a rridor runs again to the
right, and leads to a transverse Chamber, making so ft. in this direction.

However, before reaching the steps on the scarred line, we ﬁnd 1
to a second shaft a fourth set of passages to the right, 125 it. long in a

a, straight direction. Adjoining this on the left is a largg Gallery 68 ft.
