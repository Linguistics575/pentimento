Mounting to the left of the tomb of Rehhmar‘d we reach (to the
left of No. 48) a lately discovered tomb, rather difﬁcult of access.
The trouble of the ascent, however, is repaid by the beauty and
freshness of the paintings. It belonged to Sen-nofer (good brother),
superintendent of the southern city, overseer of the granaries of
Ammon, and superior of the ﬂocks of Ammon, under Amonhotop H.
Strangely enough the name of directories (Arhes antes) is also found
here. To the right, immediately above the tomb of Rekhmar‘a, is
that (now No. 51) of hmuneh, superintendent of the palace under
Tutmes III. and Amenhotcp 11. This also consists of a large restin-
bule with. niches in the sides, and a rather long passage out into
the hill.

The representations on the inner wall of the vestibule are worth no-
ticing. 0n the left are the African tribes bringing in their tribute con»
sisting of gold, ivory, apes, panther—shins and the like. (3n the right is
the tribute of the sciatica, jars, a carriage, a white and a brown horse,
and various weapons. In both corners of the vestibule were steles, of
which only that on the right has been preserved containing a prayer to
Its in the name of the deceased. On the right—hand side of the long pas-
sage into the hill is a scene illustrating the chase of waterfowl.

To the right close to No. 51 is the tomb of Amenwemwheb (No. 36)
known to Champollion and. described by Ebers and Stem. It cons
sists of two halls one behind the other, of which the length is at
right angles to the passage between them, and of a chamber behind
the second hall.

The historical Inscription on the left inner wall of the ﬁrst hall painted
in blue on white stucco, and discovered by Prof. Ebers, is of special in”
terest. In it Amen—onset describes the part which he took in the corn--
. signs of Tonnes 111., and gives‘ exact information of the length of that

haraoh‘s reign, and the accession of his successor Amenhotep II. He
does not forget to record the honours which the favour of his prince had.
heaped upon him. ‘I was”, he begins ‘his lordship‘s great ﬂ elity, the
pride of the king of Lower Egypt, the half of the heart of the king of Upper
Egypt. 1 followed my lord into the country of the north and of the south
according to his will etc. ‘Then he recounts how he took part in the victorious

Karkhernish, beyond the river of Mesopotamia (the Euphrates), Tyre (1?),
Katesh, Niniveh, etc. Everywhere he obtained spoil and was rewarded
with presents of rings and helmets, and decorated with necklaces, the
badges of orders, including the ‘Ornarnent of the Lion‘. The follow-
ing is an interesting passage: ‘Another time the lord of both worlds per—-

their tasks. I killed the greatest among thorn, ﬁghting in me right of His

the last day of the third winter month. ‘He ascended to heaven at the
going down of the sun, and the servant otﬁod made himself one with
his Maker. "When it was morning and the earth became clear and the sun‘s

and Lower Egypt, Amenhotep 11., ascend his father‘s throne‘. ﬁnder t s
Pharaoh also the general enjoyed high honours. His skull is preserved
in the anatomical museum of Leipsie. His biography was composed by
another commander-in-chief, named ﬁsh.
