and stars. Curtius states that the ﬁgure of the god was like a naval;
round it were emeralds and other precious stones. The extent remains
date from a late period; a fragment bearing a royal cartouche appears to
date from Nectanebus I. ’

Minutoli farther mentions the cornerstones of a Girdle Wall near
the temple; they are still to be found at the NE. angle. The girdle-wall
was 7'? paces long and 68 paces broad. It a parently belonged to the
second temple mentioned by Diodorus (see p. , for in a pretty palm-
grove only about 1/2 hi. to the 3.1!}. of it is the Sun Spring, known also
to Herodotus (IV, 181). This oval spring, about 110 paces in. circum—
ference, is now called into Easement, The story of the peculiar properties
of this spring, repeated by all the ancient writers, in virtue of which its
temperature varied at diil'erent periods of the day, rests upon error. For
the water has a uniform temperature of 73%" Fahr., though it may some—
times appear warmer than it really is, in the often very cold. nights,
while at midday it may seem almost cold in contrast to the heat of the
burning sun.

Bohll‘s failed to find in Siwah any confirmation of the statements of
the natives, reported by St. John, that some of the houses rest upon
more ancient buildings.-—To the N. of Siwah is the Gate! Holds, or hill
of the dead, a limestone hill about 150 it. high and 1600 yds. in circum-
ference, perforated with hundreds of vaults, graves, and catacombs.
Some of the vaults are large enough for a hundred or more corpses. All
the graves have been riﬂed, and heaps of skulls and shattered skeletons
lie around. Half way up the hill, on the E. side, is a solitary tomb of
more pretensions, with its entrance adorned with pilasters. Beyond a
fore-court is a spacious sepulchrol chamber, with two side—rooms, and
adorned with a vivid green garland of vine-leaves on a blue ground. In
the background are some defaced chisellcd figures. At Bezed arr—Rom, to
the W. of Siwah, is another cemetery excavated in a hill. Here also are
the remains of an ancient Egyptian temple (gingi- trailers), 62 ft. long by
151/2 ft. broad, without any hieroglyphics. A little to the N. of this
temple are some scanty remains of a late period, on the hill ‘Amdde’a
(Two Columns). At Bat el~Msdtasiz, 3 M. to the SSW. of Siwah, Rohlfs
discovered a marble ram, now in the museum at Berlin.-—-The Late of
Arethtysh, about so M. to the N.W. of Siwah, is of little importance,
though the French colonel Bertie was induced by the wonderful tales of
the Arabs to bring a boat for the purpose of exploring it.
