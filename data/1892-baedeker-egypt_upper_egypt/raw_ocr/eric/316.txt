on the left or E. side.

The ”loan-Portal (Pl. G) forms a worthy introduction to the
temple, ﬂanked on either side by a tower wrth sloping walls, about

100 ft. high This is usually named [Em Mallet,

   

‘portal-building’, ‘entrancewhall’, in the inscriptions, a desig-
nation which is not unfrequently employed to include the entire
gatehouse and the two towers, though the most usual term for the

   

entire cntrance- structure was Belthm, i. a.
‘tower’, ‘watch—tower’.

This passage was formerly closed with a massive door with two
wings. The entire lofty gatchouse is covered from top to bottom
and on all sides with reliefs and inscriptions, amongst which,
esper ially on the right and left, the colossal Eli some of the King (Ncos
Dionysus) is conspicuous, smiting his foes, whom he holds by the
hair, in presence of Horns and Esther. In two rows, above, the
king appears praying and offering sacriﬁces before the gods of Edfu.
m Below, on the left (W2) pylon, the king and queen conduct a
procession of representatives of the districts that yield. gold, silver,
other metals, precious stones, cosmetics, etc., and furnish them to
the temple. On the front of the pylon towers are four wide incisions,
too on each side of the central portal. These were intended to
support the huge copper—mounted wooden poles with gilded tips,
which are illustrated in Vol.1,p.168. One of the lower marginal
inscriptions states that these poles were intended at Edfu to avert
the storms of heaven, and that they were adorned with gay ﬂags at
the top.

The pitch~dark lower Pylon Chambers on each side are entered
from the court by doors to the right and left of the portal, and from
each of them an easy Staircase of 242 steps in 14 ﬂights ascends to
the Platforms of the towers. One of the towers should certainly be
ascended, in spite of the numerous steps. The ViBW from the top
is unusually attractive, commanding not only the most imposing
survey of the templewbuildings, but also ranging over the surround--
ing country. The plain through which the Nile ﬂows, with its
verdant crops and its villages fringed with palms and mimosas,
framed by the desert—mountains in the distance, presents a scene
of surprising beauty, especially when seen under the evening light
that renders the Egyptian landscape so wonderfully distinct.

The Force-Court (Pl. F), which is bounded in front by the
pylons, at the back by the hypostyle hall (Pl. E), and on the right
and left by the great girdlcwwall, is a spacious court, pared. with
broad ﬂags, and surrounded on its E., W., and S. sides with a cor-
cred colonnade of 32 columns. The inscriptions call?“ it fav1;,:ious1y
