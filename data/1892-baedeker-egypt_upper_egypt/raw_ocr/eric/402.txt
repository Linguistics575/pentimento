dedicated. to these two deities, as is also indicated by the reproach-
tations to the right and left of the entrance-door. Above the small
door on the right are the dedications of Tntmes III. and Amenho-
top H. The three apartments contained scenes of worship, scenes
from the founding of the templ e,and sacriﬁcial scenes. The traveller
should notice the carefully executed portraits of the three kings who
took part in. the erection of the temple, Tntmes 11L, Amenhotep 11.,
and Tntmes IV.

011 the bachmwall of the sanctuary is a stale of great historical
importance. At the top is a relief of Amenhotep H. presenting two
vessels of ndne to Harmaohis and Ammon-Ra; beneath is an inu-
scription of 20 lines, from the 3rd year of the reign of Amenho»
top H. After a ﬂattering account of the king and his achievements
(repeated on a stale found at Erment and now in Vienna), the
completion of the temple begun by Tutmes III. is mentioned.

Line 12. ‘Behold, the king adorned the house of the god (which had
been erected by) his father, King Tntmes 1H,, for all the divine fathers,
built of stoneas an enduring work, with a protecting wall of bricks
around it. The doors were of the ﬁnest acacia-wood, the gateways of
enduring stone, with the object of commemorating for ever the great name of
his father Tntmes III. in this temple. King Amenhotep II. celebrated the
festival of the laying of the foundation-stone in honour of all his an—
cestors, while he dedicated to him a massive gate-tower of hard stone in
front of the protecting~wall of this splendid dwelling of the gods, a co»
lonnade round it of hard stone as a lasting work, many sacriﬁcial vessels
and utensils of silver and brass, stands, altars, a bronze caldron, bra-u
tiers, dishes, and censors. Therenpon the king caused this stale to be
prepared and placed in this temple in the place where (stands) the statue
of the great Home, the king, and be caused to be graven on it the
mighty name of Amcnhotep II. in the house of this divine fathers, after
he returned from the land of Upper Syria, where he overthrew all his
adversaries, in order to widen the boundaries oi Egypt on his ﬁrst
campaign.

Still more remarkable is the narrative at the end. of this inu-
scription:

‘The king had retnmed home, with his heart fall of gratitude to his
father Amman. With his own hand he had struck down with his club
seven kings, who were in the region of the land of Takhis. They lay
pinioned on the foreudeclr of the royal ship, the name of which was ‘Ship
of Amenhotep IL, maintainer of the land‘. Six of these enemies were
hanged on the walls of Thebes, and their hands the same. The remaining
enemy was carried up the stream to Nubia, and hanged on the walls of
the town of Nepate, an order to make the victory of the king manifest
for ever among all the tribes of the land of the negroes, since he has
taken possession of the tribes of the 8., and tamed the tribes of the lit,
even to the ends of the whole earth, upon which the sun shines, without
ﬁnding any opposition, according to the command of his father Ammow
Ra, lord of the throne of both lands. Such things has King Amenho~
top II. done”. From Bragsch, History of Egypt, pp. 390, 391.

Those who ascend to the roof of the temple will ﬁnd a memorial
of Herodotus, the ‘father of history’, not, however, inscribed by
himself, for he himself informs as (11.29) that he came no farther
than Elephantine. The were aspect of the letters indicates that the
inscription (as follows) is of considerable antiquity.
