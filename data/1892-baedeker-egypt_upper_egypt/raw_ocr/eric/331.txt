according to the second and third canons are the same; but those
of the upper part of the body diﬂ‘er very essentially. The head is larger,
the chest recedes farther, the abdomen is higher. The contours be-
come in general fuller, and abandon that early beautiful simplicity and
tenderness of form, on which depended their imposing and specially

lated style of art. The proportion of the foot to the total length of the
body still remains, but the foot is no longer the fundamental unit of

whom they applied the Egyptian name Aroeris (Harwar) and the Greek
name Apollo, in gratitude for some special mark of favour shown to them
by the gods.

Beside the door of the next room, the second in the direction
of the Presses, is a sevennlined Calendar of Festivals. The hall
itself was built by Euergetes H. The third room is the ﬁrst that
shows Ptolemy VII. Phﬂometor shoring homage (cartoucbe see
