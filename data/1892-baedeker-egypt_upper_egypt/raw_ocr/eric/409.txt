Egthian. Demerarchon, son of Amoibichos, and Pelckos, son of Uda-
mos, wrote.

The leader of this company is here named Psemmetikh; in a Phoen-
ician inscription on the same spot one of the mercenaries is spoken of
as a servant of Hear, the general. The writers of the other Greek inscrip—
tions were partly lonians from Tees and Kolophon, partly Der-inns from
Rhodes, a Sidonian, and a Carlee.

Providing ourselves with candles, or still better with a mag-
nesium lamp, we now enter the rock-temple, the interior of which,
with its still vividly coloured pictorial decorations, is no less re-
markable than the exterior. The walls of the ﬁrst hall (Pl. F),
which is 58 ft. long by 54 ft. broad, are covered all round with raw
presentations, which were ﬁrst chiselled in the stone, then covered
with a' thin coating of stucco and painted. The ceiling is supported
by eight square pillars, against which stand Osiris~ﬂgures of the
king, with the scourge and the crock in his crossed hands. The
ceiling itself is adorned with vultures and the names of the king.
Above the entrance is the remarkably simple dedicationminscripﬁon,
on the right to Harmachis, lord of the land of Khent, on the left to
Ammon-Ra, king of the gods. The pictorial scenes in this hell are
symmetrically arranged, so that those referring to events in. the N.
of Egypt are placed on. the N. (right) side, those to events in the
8., on the S. (left) side. A similar arrangement was adepted in the
exterior hall of the temple of hit el-Walli (p. 310).

On each side of the entrance-wall within are representations,
such as are commonly found on the pylons of more recent temples;
as rag. at Edfu and Philse. The king aims a blow with his club at
a number of fees, whom he holds by the hair, whﬂe they raise their
hands in supplication. On the left are represented N. tribes, on
the right S. tribes, easily distinguished by their facial character»—
istics. Harmachis stands before the king on the left, and Ammon,
handing him the sword of victory, on the right. Hovering above
the king is a protecting vulture. On a standhrd behind him is the
name Kc nekht meet me, ‘the strong bull, beloved of the goddess
Ms’. In his right hand is an ostrich feather, in his left a head Mth
the Staten Xe, the person of the king, with the legend ‘the living
royal Ks, lord of both lands in the grave, in the house of the deep”.
Beneath are the children of the king; to the right his sons, to the
left his daughters, with sistra.

We now turn to the S. wall, on the left. At the top are ﬁre reu-
ligious pictures: sacriﬁcial scenes before Amazon, Earmachis, the
king in the tree of life kneeling upon the symbolggﬂgf sh festival,
