The tomb between the two last-mentionedhelongs to a lady named Satchel,
perhaps a wife of Bebe.

0n the W. hank opposite el-th, on a hill about 3 M. from the Nile,
are the partly destroyed rock-tombs of Kent el-hhmar (‘Red Hill“), dating
from the time of Tutmes I. Landing at Ghentowiych, we precede thence
due E. through the field viii (20 min.) Marital. In 20 min. more we reach
Kent cl-Agamur, on the site of the ancient town (mentioned by Straho, of

or . The three hawks are Horus, {Enamutet} and Kebseuuf. A

hawk is also named in the tombs as a local god. The name of User-
tesen was not found on the heaps of rubbish in 18% by Professor Eisen.
lohr. - Ahout 1/4 M. farther to the E. begins the desert, and 1/4 hi.
farther is the ancient Roman fort of Seﬁan, on which large vultures fre-
quently perch. In 20 min. more we begin to mount the hill with the
tombs. There are altogether eight tombs, of which only the ﬁrst to the
right (we and the ﬁrst to the left (Hos-enter, chief priest of Hieraconpolis‘)
repay a visit. The former contains a well—preserved stole of the time
of Tutmes 1.; outside the latter, to the right, dancing~girls were painted.
Not long ago three black granite statues were found here, with the names
of Kings Pepi (6th Dyn.), Ra-kha~kheper (Usertesen 11.), and Ra-eu-mat
(Amenemha 111., 12th Dyan). These are now in the museum at Gizeh.
131/2 M. from el—wKih is Edfa, on the W. bank.

Edie is a steamboat-station. The Mail Steamers arriving on Tues. and
Frid. at 8.30 am. halt here for 21/2 hrs; the Tourist Steamers spend a
night here on their upward journey. Tourists on a three—weeks tour visit
the temple on the evening of their arrival (11th day, Frid.): those on a
four-weeks tour visit it the next morning. Steamers do not stop here
on the downward. voyage. The halt of the mail-steamers gives hardly
time even for a hasty visit to the temple, especially as the latter lies

min. from the laudingplace.

Those who travel in their own dhahahiyeh should spend two days at
Edie, bringing their provisions from the boat to the temple. Egyptologists,
who may find material to occupy them here for days and weeks, will obtain,
if necessary, poor lodging and scanty fare in the Post Home, 3/4 E. to the
E. of the temple. Insect-powder should in this case not be forgotten;
and wine and preserved meat should he brought from Luxor.

Donkeys and horses are to be had at the Landingupiace. Camels may
also he obtained. Riders unaccustomed. to the latter animals must be
careful not to fall forward when the camel kneels down.

The way to the temple leads almost due W. from. the landing-—
place, then, turning to the N. (right), skirts the Canal of Edits and.
crosses it by a good new bridge. It then proceeds to the W. through
several streets and ﬁnally turns N. again for a short distance. --~
Another route leads straight on from the landingwplace, bonds to
the right through ﬁelds, and. then traverses the streets of the town
without crossing the canal.
