architecture of the new monarchy; and we here see, in place of the can
pital next the central passage the mask of the goddess Esther, with her
cows’ ears and head-dress. The front of a small portable temple with
handles, which rested on the head of the goddess, was placed on the aba-
cus, and upon this rested the architrave. The mask of Hathor here ap-
pears only on one side of the capital; at Der el~bahri it appears on two
sides. This artistic form was afterwards abandoned, but was again rec
sired by Nekhtneb-vf (Noctanebus II.), a rival king to the Persians, be“
longing to the 30th Dyn., who loved to compare himself to the expellers
of the Eyksos, and who therefore reverted to the artuforms introduced by
them. Finally under the Ptolemies this form was developed into a capital
in the fullest sense of the term. The masks are here united with the
plinths by means of a vertical Genomic! Stripe, covering two of the
sides of the olygonal shafts and adorned with inscriptions. As each of
the sixteen sides or faces of the columns measures 5 inches in breadth,
the stripe is 10 inches in breadth. «- On the walls at the height of the
architraves, beneath the roof, appear other Esther masks, alternating
with the names of the royal builders. dmsaholep HI. dedicated to his

At this chapel we turn, direct our steps towards the Nile, and in
1/2, hr. reach the Boon Taurus, on the right side of the valley, re»
cognisable from a distance by the Slot-r leading up to it. The letter
consists of 41 steps hewn in. the rock, with a massive balustrade
on each side. The temple was constructed under Ptolemy IX.
Energetes H. (Physkon), and subsequently provided with new in-
scriptions by Ptolemy X. Soter H. The site was regarded as holy
even before the building was erected, as we are informed by an in—
scription of the reign of Ramses VL, cut in the rock on the E. side
of the door leading into the mountain.

being the sanctuary of the temple, was constructed earlier than the pre—
ceding chambers to which the stair leads. The letter form. two parts.
0n reaching the top of the stair, we pass through a doorway to a Fore-
Court, not quite 33 ft. wide, the exterior sides of which were hounded by
low walls built between columns. Two rows of columns in the centre led
to_the door of a smaller he“ (only 19 ft. wide) of curious construction,
being bounded on the right and left by four low walls, of which each
was built in between a pillar and a column. The door leading to the

rock-chamber opened at the back of this hall. This sanctuar also was
especially dedicated to Hebent. y
