24 Route I. TELL EL-AMARNAH. From Cairo

of them unﬁnished, and the colouring of the reliefs is sometimes in.
wonderful preservation. The mummy shafts, in spite of their great
depth, have all long since been dospoiled of their contents. in the
very ﬁrst tomb we ﬁnd a representation of the king and his family
oﬁering a sacriﬁce to the sun’s disc. The disc is encircled with
the limes-snake and furnished with several arms, stretching down-
wards; the hands are symbolic of energy, liberality, and the creative
faculty. Dwarfs (then, as later, a favourite royal plaything), fan-
bearers, and bowing courtiers stand below. In front is the provost~
martial with his baton. To the left of the ﬁrst grave, on the hill,
is the Tomb of Panto (No. 2), which is in a very ruinous con-
dition. Farther on to the left is that of Barnett (No. 3), with a ﬁnely
worked exterior. On the leftwall of the second chamber of this tomb
is a military scene, which we do not hesitate to describe as the
most realistic representation found hitherto in any Egyptian grave.
The loan ﬁgure of the Pharaoh, above whom the sun spreads its
arms, stands in his war—chariot and drives the ﬁery steeds, the intro-
duction of which Egypt owes to the Hyhsos. Sills (outwmnners)
with long stares run in front of the chariot, towards the crowd of
people offering sacriﬁce and bonding to the ground in adoration.
Standardwbearers and soldiers clear the way for the rapidly advanw
sing procession, just as the mounted harasses still do for the carriage
of the Khedire. The king appears once more followed by his
children, who also drive their own chariots. The procession hastens to-
wards the royal palace, which covers the right part of the rear-wall
of the chapel and also part of the right well, adording us a clearer
idea of an Egyptian palace than any other scene of the kind. It
has long been established that neither the royal princes nor even
the Pharaohs themselves lived in the temples. 0n the contrary
they used to build themselves airy chdteanx of light materials, with
doors opening on shady galleries and colonnades. Gardens with
fountains and waterubaeins surrounded the building, near which
were also out-houses, stables, and well-stocked storehouses, in
quantity correSponding to the huge number of the dependents
of the royal family. The great entrancendoor is digniﬁed with
double rows of bud columns, and red standards were from lofty
flag-stem. Above one of the side-doors is a round window similarto
those which the French call milwdewbmnf. The palace is adjoined
by a sepulchral chapel, supported by columns and containing ﬁgures
of the king’s ancestors, honoured by rich sacriﬁcial oderings; at the
door is a choir, singing pious songs of remembrance to the accentu-
paniment of the harp, and taking its time from the handnclapping
of the leader (a. custom still preserved in Egypt). ~- In the first
chamber of Tomb 7 (right well, p. ‘26) is a representation of the
Temple of the Solar Disc, with a large peristyle court surrounded
by a colonnade. Pillars resembling Caryatides decorate the walls,
and above all tower the lofty pylons withiheir hollow ampules.
