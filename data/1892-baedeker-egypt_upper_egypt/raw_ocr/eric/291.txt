225 Route 21. THEBES. West Bank:

below, is an’inscription of 13 lines, of which the 8th and 9th
were destroyed by Ramses IL, for the purpose of inserting his own
name in honour of Amman-Ra, the lord of heaven, etc. It speaks
of ‘the voyage on the sea, the beginning of the great journey to

To actor, is. the holy land, the happy arrival in Arabia of

the soldiers of Pharaoh, the lord of the world, according to the
command of Ammon, the lord of the gods’, sin. n— Another ina-
scription between the trees, to which the boat is fastened, tells us
that Punt as well as Arabia Potters was dedicated to the goddess
Hathor. To the left of the two ships are 10 lines describing by name
the diaerent kinds of wares which sailors are carrying on board along
narrow planks. ‘Loading of the ships with untold quantity of
valuables from Arabia, precious kinds of wood from the holy land,
heaps of the grains of incense—“gum (heminentmantaﬁ, Nehut trees
of fresh. incensewgrains (data), ebony (hebni) for sacred vessels with
gold and silver from of the land Aron (Asia), Deceit, and Khesitu
wood, possibly coasts-barb, grains of Ahem tit, incense and cos-
metics (antimony), Anon and Kefu apes, Desem beasts or grey-
hounds, coloured panther-shins from the south, natives and children’.
The inscription concludes with the statement that nothing like it had
been done under any king before, and it speaks the truth. Hatasu
showed her people the way to the land whose products were later
to ﬁll the treasurios not only of the Porsche, but also of the thn
nicians and the Jews. --- These pictures are of special interest as
exactly illustrating 1 Kings x. ‘22: ‘Once in three years came the navy
of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, and spas, and peacocks’.
Except these last named birds all the treasures may be seen on the
vessels of Bataan. Her expedition must have been accompanied by
some nature—loving priests, as below the ships we see the water-line

Prof. Doenits has been able to determine their species. Among them
are Naseus unicornis, Xiphias gladius, Platax Teira, Balistes assasi,

In a sole ‘ona eye was drawn larger than the other, showing a ﬁne
observation of nature’.

0n the wall adjoining the rightvhand corner there was to be seen
until a few years ago the transport of the incense-trees, 9 soldiers with

otiicers, and in two places, one above the other, the prince of Punt, named
