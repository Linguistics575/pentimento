not, etc. The translation of the latter is as follows: ‘Ammonins,
son of Dionysius, fulﬁlled a row made to Isis, Serapis, and the
gods worshipped along with them, by presenting to them the wot—-

his wife Klidemas, and his children Dionysius and Annbas. On the

Augustus, in whose reign therefore the wall, though furnished with
inscriptions by later emperors, must have existed at least in a rough.
state. The other inscriptions are of similar purport.

At the 8. end of the E. Colonnade (Pl. D) was a large Holt
(Pl. O), of which only fragments of the N. and E. walls remain.
It bears the name of Tiberius. The colonnade, which adjoins its
N. wall, was never entirely completed. Only three of the capitals
of the columns {including a very ﬁne palm—capital) are ﬁnished;
the rest are merely roughly blocked. out, but they are of interest as
showing us that the more elaborate carving was not taken in hand
until after the capitals had been placed in position upon the shafts.
The E. colonnade does not extend as far as the ﬁrst pylons, but is
separated from them by a small Temple of .Esculopius , the Egyp-
tian lmhotep, son of Ptah (Pl. E), consisting of two chambers, and.
facing the S. The Greek inscription over the entrance dates from

the pylons.

sessions two lofty and broad Towers, with a narrow Portal between
them. This portal, built and adorned by Nectanebus H. , is the
oldest part of the pylon. The smaller portal, to the left, like the
temple behind it (Birth-house, see p. 289), which stands in rela-

the decoration of the facade was added by Ptolemy XHI Neos, Dies

with his mother and wife, presenting to leis the symbol of a ﬁeld.
The entire imposing erection is 150 ft. broad and 60 ft. high. The
S. facade, fronting the processions advancing from the Nile, is
covered with Beliefs an crests.

At each side of the Central Doorway (P1. 11) is a ﬁgure of Isis. On
the upper part of the left tower is the Pharaoh sacriﬁcing to Osiris and

he appears before Horns and Nephthys, and before Isis and Home. {the
