diderent chapels are still easily distinguishable, partly from the
plan of the building, partly by the representations and inscriptions;
for from each of the seven doors a processional approach led through
the two hypostyle halls straight to the entrance of the correspond—
ing chapel; while the representations on the columns ﬂanking each
approach refer only to the deity to whom the chapel at the end of it
was dedicated. In the vaulted chapels, amid the fumes of in"
cease and. the murmuring of mnﬁled singing, waited the minis-
tering priests of the sanctuary, pouring out libations and uttering
benedictions as the processions wound along the aisles, either
bearing a mommy to be sanctiﬁed or consisting of a group of priviu-
leged laymen bringing offerings to the Osiris gods for the soul’s
welfare of the deceased.-—-The dedications are inscribed on the
door-posts in the traditional forms and with little variation. Similar
vaults occur at Benihasan and Dér el-Bahri, and. also in the lids of
the sarcophagi in the museum at Gireh. in each case the menu-
ments to which they belong serve funerary purposes; the shape of
the vault is, however, intended to represent the vault of heaven,
which the Osiriswsoul has to traverse, and they are usually decorated
with stars. An inscription preserved on one of the vaults of the
sanctuary informs us that the Pharaoh erected this structure for his
father Osiris in the interior of the temple of Beams-union and ﬁtted.

middle place had to be assigned to Amman, the chief of the gods, it was
necessary to mark the special dignity of Osiris, to whom indeed the temiple
was consecrated, by making his chapel (Pl. d) wider than the others. he
rear-walls of the latter are, in each case, occupied by two niches with a
lotus-flower between them, from which rises the slander form oi Osiris,
symbolising the blossoming of the soul in a ‘ha pier sphere". In the back»
wall of the sanctuary of Osiris, however, is a our, leading to attractors
(Pl. E) which, including the adjoining smaller columncd chambers, is as wide
as the whole sanctuary. This was the scene of the mysterious rites eels-t
breted in honour of the Divine-Deceased (Osiris, whose name even the Greek
Herodotus shrank from breathing) by the esoteric priests of the highest class
(see Brewster‘s Lower- Egypt, p. 124). The inscriptions in the chapels inform
us that the priestly processions 1-, which came from all parts of the kingdom,
made a complete circuit of the chapel, keeping to the right Well on entering
and returning to the door along the left wall. Thirty-six rites er ceremonies
had to he performed during this circuit. First came a recitation to prove the
worthiness of the worshipper to approach the holy place and the image of
the god. Then the veil was lifted. The worshipper was next allowed to
witness the investiturs of the god by the priests with his ﬁllets, garments,
ornaments, and the attributes of his divine ower. Not before this was
accomplished did the pilgrim prostrate himself in adoration,bringing drink—
oﬂ‘erings, libations, and. burnt-offerings. The hymns to be song at these
ceremonies are all prescribed, and the pictorial representations show how
the gods were to be clothed and in what attitudes they were to he wor-
shipped. Possibly all these rites were performed only by the priests of
