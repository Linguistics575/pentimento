(new in the Louvre) bears on its N. side an inscription of the king
Takelut. The method of uniting capital and shaft gives evidence
of genuine artistic feeling; but the general effect of this style of
column was unattractive, and after its employment here it found no
admirers and was given up. --- This hall contains no inscriptions
of general interest. The hieroglyphic characters on the architrave
are carved in the large and handsome style of the i8th Dyn., but
they merely announce in the usual formal way that Tutmes 1H.
built the hall of ﬁne limestone and sandstone in honour of his
father Amman.

The S. part of the rear~wall of this hall in adjoined by a
chamber in which seven well-«made polygonal columns are still
standing. Two small doorways lead. from the centre of the colon-
naded ball into a Sancruaur (Pl. 1), on the front of which the name
Alexander may be read. This, however, does not refer to the great
conqueror of Darius, but to his and Ronana’s son, Alexander IL,
a royal puppet for whom Ptolemy I. Soter ruled. Another inscrip~
tlon informs us that Tutmes built this sanctuary also. The latter
was probably used for special cults, while, as we have seen, the
granite room of Philip Aridaens (p. 134) must be regarded as the
holy of holies proper, even for this temple. The colours on the
walls of this room are in good preservation. In spite of the ruins
and rubbish lying about here the traveller should not omit to glance
into the chambers of the rear colonnaded hall. One of them. con»
tains an interesting representation. The god Seth (Vol. 1., p. 132;
here half defaced) of Nob (Rom Ombo) teaches Tutmes H. to
shoot with the bow, while Horus instructs him in the use of the
lance. The hostile twin-brothers bestow upon the Pharaoh strength
to win victory, which is symbolized by the vulture of victory hovering
above the group.

The Columns which are still standing in the binder portions of
the temple are of interest as specimens of the favourite orders under
the 18th Dynasty. Near the centre four beautifully sculptured paw
pyrusabud columns stand in a row from E. to W., and a few paces
to the NW. are two polygonal columns united by an architrave. In
Room Y, excavated by Mariette, are some interesting representations
of animals and. plants, which. as the accompanying inscriptions
inform us, were transplanted from Retennu (Assyria) to Egypt by
Tutmes 111., in the 25th year of his reign.

We now turn to the 8., to the Side-Building of the temple of Tie
mes Ill. (Pl. K), where there are 9 chambers adjoining each other,
each opening to the N. The two at the E. and are halls, each with two
columns to support the roof, while of the other seven chambers three
are completely ruined. Opposite the westernmost of those lay the
chamber which contained the celebrated Kama]: Table: of the
Kings (Vol. 1., p. 85), transferred to Paris by Prisca d’Avennes
and now in the Bibliotheque Nationals. Only ,about 4:0 of the
