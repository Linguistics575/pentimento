By following the Arab hills ,we reach, 51in M. from Seﬂt‘eh, Beams, .
with four large quarries in the hard limestone rock and some tombs of
the old empire with roughly out calyx-capitals and half-offered sculptures.
Similar tombs are found at Shrink {inter and Be‘r. a little to the SE.
Near Homlych, in the steep side of the rocky hill, are three grottoes,
one above another, containing ancient tombs with inscriptions and re-
presentations, belonging to the royal ofﬁcials Afa and linker. In antiquity

the place was named K’s-then: U __ g8 (Upper {they see below).

 

141/2 M. are el~Kebir, situated in the plain on the E. bank,
is surrounded by a ring of hills, containing rock-tombs with sculp-
torso and large quarries with some demotic representations. The
few inscriptions refer to the old. empire. Stamped bricks found
in the mounds of debris belonged to the buildings of the 18th Dya-
nasty. The quarries contain ornaments and representations of the
Roman period. Kin elmKebir stands on the site of the ancient
Antwopolis, capital. of the Antmopolitan name, in which the hero
Antmus and other deities were worshipped. An inscription found
here reads: Armies not role coercion; Stole, ‘to Animus and his
divine colleagues’. In ancient Egyptian it was called the ‘Nome
of the two Gods’, probably in commemoration of the contest be-
tween Seth and Horns. According to the myth Antmus, son of
Poseidon and Gas, was a giant of immense strength, whom Osiris,
on his journey through the world to introduce the vine and the
culture of grain, appointed his ricegerent over the land bordering
on Ethiopia and Libya. Busiris was governor of the land to the E.
Antmus used his giant’s strength to overcome and slay strangers,
and Hercules had to try conclusions with him when he landed in
Libya to steal the cattle of Geryon.‘ After a violent struggle, Her-n
cules succeeded in strangling his huge opponent. The deciding
contest between Typhon (Seth) and Osiris, or rather Horns, son
and represbntative of Osiris, took place, according to the version of
the legend adopted by Diodorus, at Antmopolis, although the in»
scriptions, and notably the great Horus tent of Brits, relate that the
struggle raged from one end of the Nile valley to the other. The

 

Egyptian name of lien was M g} To. be, or ‘town of the

lofty mountain’, whence is derived. theCoptic Thou. It was also

known as

Egyptian mountain—god (frets out z:- mountain), whom the Greeks
compared with their Dionysus. A representation of Antares men-
tinned by Wilkinson, in which he appears with his head, likeHelios,
surrounded with rays, and accompanied by the goddess Nephthys,
has recently been rediscovered by Golenischeﬁ in the NE angle
