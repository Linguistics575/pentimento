the tomb of Osiris, of the righteous prophet of Amen, heferhotep“.
After an introduction, wishing peace to the dead, and glorifying the
sunngod, it continues literally as follows: “Celebrate the great day, 0
prophet. Well is to thee, fragrant resin and ointments are laid before
thee. Here are wreaths and ﬂowers for the waist and shoulders of thy
sister, who is pleasant to thine heart, as she rests beside thee. Let us
then sing and strike the harp in thy presence. Leave all cares behind
and think of the joys, until the day of the voyage comes when men casts
anchor on the land which delights in silence’.

Near this is the once splendid tomb of another chcrhotcp, over-
seer of the cattle of Ammon, but now in ruins and used as a mega--
zine by the keeper of the Gireh museum. There may also be visited
in the neighbourhood the tombs of Kheﬁif, of the time of Amenm
hotep 111., of Moi, and of an ofﬁcial in charge of the stables of
Amenhotep 11., the inner room of which is the resting place of
Make, a writer of the treasury in the time of Ramses ll,

19. The Temple of Suﬁ I. at .

Second ﬁne on the W. bank: 1. Temple of hut-nah; b. Tombs of the
Kings (Biban el-Muldk); 3. Necropolis of el—Asasif and of Drab dbu‘l—
Neggah; 4. Der el—bahri.

To the W. bank as on the previous day, see p. 152. From the
landings-place of the ferry we ride across the ﬁelds in a northerly
direction and in 3/4 hr. reach the handsome a"Temple, the front of
which with its columns is visible at a considerable distance. The
original building (see the annexed plan) was of smaller dimensions
than the Ramesseum and Medinet Hahn, its complete length being
518 ft., and of this only the actual sanctuary with its halls and
chambers, 153 ft. in depth remain, while there are only scanty
remains to prove the former existence of two Courts and the Bylaws
which enclosed. them. The Sphinzrcs which were placed like guar-
dians to the right and left of the door leading into the ﬁrst Court
on the inside, are half covered with earth. They were placed there
by Seti 1., and on the bases were inscribed the names of all the
nations which he had conquered. Of all the buildings in the Necro-
pclis of Thebes, this one most reminds us of the Memnouium of Abydos
(p. 54), and a closer inspection of the style of inscriptions and res-
presentations will both bring out and explain their similarity, for
the temple of Iiumah was founded by Seti L, the builder of Abydos,
and both the sanctuaries were restored and completed by Ramses ll.
They'both served the same purpose, as a place where the menus of
the founder might be remembered, and oderiugs made. At Abydos
it is true that throughout attention was paid to the pilgrims to
Osiris, while here it is the gods of Thebes that were promi-
nent, a this was the centre of the festival of the mountain valley,
