MS Route 1 r. KARNAK. East Ennis

square pillars are used in place of the more usual columns. These
simple artistic forms themselves suggest an early origin for the
ediﬁce, and the inscriptions record that it was built by Amenhotep H.
and III. A. gallery is adjoined by a hall with 20 pillars, and that
again by several apartments arranged in a manner, npt elsewhere
found. On several of the pillars, whose unadorned capitals are
striking, the king appears before Ammon. It is not easy to deter-
mine the purpose of this building. It cannot have been a palace.
Perhaps it contained stables for the sacred animals of the diﬂ’erent
deities, or was the depository for the sacriﬁcial gifts presented within
the ﬁrst pylon. Perhaps Ammon’s guard of honour, which is from
quently mentioned and which had to watch over the temple, was
quartered here; or it may have been used by the priests on duty for
the day as a temporary resort. Various reasons prevent us from
regarding it as the actual abode either of the kings or of the attenm
dents on the gods. -- To the S. of Pylon X1 is the base of a Status
of King Home, the lower part of which dates from Amenhotep 1H.

Beyond the pylon, which we shirt rather than pass through, is
the Avenue of Sphinrcs, bounding the processional route that led to
the 8. buildings. To the E. of the avenue two Chambers, painted
in bright colours, were excavated by Mariette. They belong to a
temple of OsirismPtah, who is here represented as worshipped by
Taharka and by Amontanut, apparently a contemporary hing (the
Urdamani of Assyrian inscriptions). ,

The avenue leads to the temple of Muth (see below), while it is
connected by a branch with the sphinxnaveuue leading from the
temple of Khuusu to Luxor (comp. p. 116). In a straight direction
the ﬁrstwmentioned avenue is terminated by a Gate (Pl. 3:), built by
the Ptolemies, in the N. side of a girdle-swell enclosing a horse-shoe
shaped lake. In front of this lake stood the Temple of Mirth (Pl. T),
built by Amenhotep HI, and. now so completely ruined that it is
difﬁcult to determine its original arrangement. To the right and
left of the gate of Ptolemy Philadelphus (which bears a beautiful
hymn to the goddess Math), and both without and within the girdle-
wall, were numerous ileum-headed Figures of Satchel, many of which
have already found their way to European museums (cg. at Turin).
A second gate bears the cartouches of Setl H. and Setonehht. In a
small Apartment on the E. side of the temple is a record of a restom
ration of the temple by Mentuemhat, priest of Ammon, in the time
of Taber-ha. To the W. of the horse—shoe lake are the remains of a
small Temple (Pl. U), built by Ramses III... who here recorded his
victory over the land of Tahi and the animals and other rich booty
which he thereby obtained.

W. The Temple of Khmer.

About 150 paces to the W. of the last pylon (p. 14-?) passed in
our way towards the 8., lies the beautiful andinterestmg ”Tgmple
