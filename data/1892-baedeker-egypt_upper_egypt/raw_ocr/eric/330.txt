wife and sister, presenting the ﬁgure of Me to Sebek, Esther, and
Khnnsn; above the left door he appears with his second wife,
before Arueris, Tasentnefert, and Piuebtati. Between the cornice
and frieze are the dedicatory inscriptions, on the left to Harwar, on
the right to Sebeh. To the right and left of the two doors to the next
(ﬁrst) room in the direction of the Pronaos, are other two rows of
Dedication Scenes. To the right (Sebek side): in the lower row,

Egypt, of which the temple of Ombos was a representation. The

The traveller’s attention may now be directed to the Astra-
nomicot Representations, some of which are only outlined in red
and left unﬁnished. The constellations in boats floating over the
heavens, on the ceilinguside of the architrave, are the most impor-

the artist in drawing the ﬁgures are still visible, and prove that the
recmieed preportions of the various parts of the human body to
each other were here not identical with those regarded by the artists
of earlier epochs.

Lepsins, who had already established the existence of two canons of
