(the creek and the scourge), and wearing an apron with a lion’s
head. The ﬁgures of Osiris, especially the lower parts, are some-
what roughly exeoumd. On each side of the chamber are four re-
cesses, each with the king, variously clad, standing between two
deities. The wall—spaces above and between these recesses are oo-
cnpied with representations of the king making shortage, the king
being depleted alone in the lower row, and the god to whom he
odors worship in the upper row.

The upper scenes on the Right (NZ) Watt are partly destroyed, but we
can make out the king before Ra, Tum, Monte, and Khnum. In the re»
ceases (right) is the king between Harmaehis and Jesse; between Home,
lord of Earn (Abu-Simbel‘?) and Isis, mother of the gods; between Nefer-
tnrn and Sadie, between Khnnrn and hanks.

On the back-wall, to the right and. left of the entrance to the next
room, are two large scenes. To the left is the king before Ptah, before
Ramses himself and the goddess Esther, with the cow‘s head, with erect
horns, between which are two feathers as in the headdress of Fish (see
above). To the right, the king appears before Fish in the form of a
mommy, before the deiﬁed Ramses, and Sekhet seated on a. throne.

The following room, the Soiree, about 36 ft. wide though only
17 ft. deep, is entered by a proportionately small door, on the left
side of which is the king before Ptah. The ceiling is supported by
two square pillars. To the right and left two oblong recesses (see
PI. p. 314) run od‘ from this chamber, and at the back are three
other recesses, the central and largest of which is the Sanctuary. On
the pillars the king appears worshipping various deities. 0n the
N. side of the right pillar he is named ‘Beloved of Ra—Harmachis

in the land of Wotan? a ﬁ\

of as E": Pa Fish, ‘House of Ptah’, 6.9. on the door of the
sanctuary, it the right of which the king is called the beloved of
