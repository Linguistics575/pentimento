foundations is reckoned at 88,486 individuals, of which 62,8% belonged
to the largest temple (at Medinetwliabnl. The abovewmentioned Temple 0.
here the name Pa Ramses has on (House of Ramses, prince of Heliopolis)
and had 2623 priests and attendants.

The building is in form a complete temple, but in view of the
enormous dimensions of its surroundings can claim only the cha—
racter of a chapel. its total length is ”'0 it. The Pylon with the
entrance door is much injured, especially at the tep. Beyond it is a
Paristyic Chart (Pl. a), with eight Osirismpillars on each side, and
at the and four caryatide pillars forming a Passage (Pl. ﬂ), whence a
door leads to a small Hypostyic (PL 7), with eight papyrusmbud can
pitals. Finally some the chambers of the Sanctuary (Pl. h). Sculp—
ture is not wanting in this temple, which owes its origin to the
wealthy founder of the Memnonium at Medinet Habu (p. 174).
This most lavish of Egyptian kings had already founded within the
hmits oi the temple of Ammon the temple of Khunsu (p. 148) as a
worthy symbol of his liberality to the gods; and that fact explains
the comparative smallness of the temple before us. The exterior of
the pylons was adorned with representations supressing the gratitude
of the Pharaoh to the god for victory in battle. On the Left Wing

(E) Ramses 1H,, wearing the crown of Upper Egypt , holds a

band of prisoners by the hair and raises his sword for a blow which
must strike oﬂ‘ all their heads at once. Amman, standing in front of
him, hands him the sword of victory, and delivers to him chained
together the representatives of the vanquished peoples, who appear
in three rows. In the ﬁrst two rows are the conquered nations of the
south, in the third row those of the north. On the Right Wing are
similar representations, the king here wearing the crown of Lower

Egypt y. in the doorway, Ramses HI. receives from Ammon

the symbol of life, etc. On the right side-wall of the pylons are
representations of battles and captives, which were concealed by
the colonnade, a conclusive proof that the circumference of the court
cannot date from Ramses H,

In the pcristyle court (Pl. 1:) the following inscri tion occurs on the
architrave of the caryatid passage on the right. ( e omit the lengthy
introductory titles of the king.) ‘Ramses, king of Upper and Lower Egypt,
prince of Heliopolis (he. Ramses 111.), the living and beneﬂoent god, who
resembles he that lightens the world with his beams on the E. and W.
horison, the lord of beams, like the sun‘s disc in the heavens. Men extol
him, when they behold Ramses 111., the king of Upper and Lower Egypt,
the son of the sun. the lord of the diadems, Ramses the prince of Helio-
polis, who built this monument for his father Ammonwlta, the king of
the gods. He erected anew (m meet) the building known as Pa Ramses
hak an (princes of Heliopolis), as a house fer Amman, of whitened well“
hewn stone, ﬁnishing it with everlasting work”. The inscription (injured)
goes on to describe the king as a darling of Ammon, a victory-bringing
Horus, who is as rich in years as Turn, a king and protector of Egypt,
who over-throws the alien peoples, etc.
