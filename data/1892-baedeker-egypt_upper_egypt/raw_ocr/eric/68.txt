mighty prince both in war and peace, was apious worshipper of Ammon,
whose name, indeed, forms part of his own (Amen-hotep}. Amenhotep lV.,
on the other hand, turned his back on his father‘s religion and on the in—
creasingly spiritual conception of Ammon (the ‘Eidden One‘) and the other
ancient gods, discarded his name ‘Peace of Ammon‘, became exclusively

and to introduce a religious ceremonial that recalled the practices of the
Asiatic courts rather than the more digniﬁed usages of the ‘Sublime Ports”
of Egypt. Portraits of historical personagcs often cast a clearer light on
their character than piles of written documents, and the numerous re-
presentations of Amenhotep IV. encountered in; these tombs show that he
was a sickly man, a fanatic, and. an enthusiast. {The portrait~statue of
him in the Louvre'snggests similar conclusions] He also, as the inn
scriptions inform us, stood under the inﬂuence of his mother, who was
not of royal birth and seems to have encouraged her son‘s tendency to
prefer the old. popular religion to the elaborately developed. creed of the
priests. His work Was distinctly reactionary and could not long survive
him. Almost everywhere we see his successors scratching out his name as
a sign of their disapproval and. contempt. Where it still stands intact we
may conclude that it was overlooked. The fact that the portraitdike
reliefs of men in these tombs, as well as the horses and buildings, appear
more true to nature than in any other Egyptian monument may be due
to the greater liberty of divergence from the hieratic canon allowed in a
reign which was so unfavourable to the priestly dogmas. These reliefs
excited the special admiration of the Greeks. A Hellene who visited them
inscribed his name as admiring the art of the priestly stonewoutters

also erected a temple in Heliopolis, the remains of which are still extant,

Quite recently anew light has fallen on the history of Amenhotep IV.
and his predecessor through the discovery of several hundred tablets with
cuneiform inscriptions in the large Temple, or rather Palace, of Tell el—
Amaruah 1-, which narrate the intercourse of the Kings of Babylon with
Amenhotep III. and Amcnhotep IV. To the former King Dushratta of hit»

Syrian rascals to the King of Egypt, and diplomatic notes from King
Buruahuriash to Amenhotep IV“, concluding a treaty of peace and asking

Museum at Berlin, but many are in the British Museum and. a few
