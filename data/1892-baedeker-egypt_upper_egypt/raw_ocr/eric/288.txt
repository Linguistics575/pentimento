square, in the decoration of which the central block is treated as if it
were an enormous sarcophagus. In fact the Sarcophagus of the deceased
lies below the centre of this block, and is reached by means of a per-
pendicular shaft, 18 ft. in depth, at the end of a Corridor to the right of
the main passage. By descending the shaft, a room l93/2 ft. deep is reached,
and from the roof of this there is an entrance to the sarcophagus-hall,
which is exactly beneath the sonare block above described. The length
of this private tomb without the side-chambers is 862 ft, and its super-
ficial area 2470 sq. yds. or with the shaft~chambers 2660 sq. yds.

To the N. of this huge tomb are several smaller ones of the
same period, with ﬁnely worked antechambers, and false doors, and

carefully executed inscriptions. Some of these, especially those of

butions to the knowledge of the family of Pharaohs which formed
the 28th Dynasty. A. queen Nitocris of the 6th Dyn., known as a
pyramidubuilder, is said to have been beautiful and lightwhaired.
With her may have been confounded the princess of the 26th Dyn.
with the same name, who was buried at elm-Asasif, and lived shortly
before the famous courtesan of Naucratis, named Rhodopis or the
rosy-checked. Nitocris the older and Rhodopis were probably called
by the same name, he. the fair one, in the mouths of the Egyptians,
and Herodotus hearing that the ‘Fair one’ had lived shortly before
Amasis, confused the two, and reported that the courtesan Rhodopis
was considered the builder of pyramids. Soc Vol. 1., p. 346.

The Terraceu'l‘emplo of Ber elubahri.

This temple derives its name, meaning the North Church or
North Monastery, from an ecclesiastical brick building of the Christ-
ion period, the remains of which are mentioned on p. 22?. Der
elnbahri is reached from ol—Asasif in iOminutes. Its situation is
remarkably ﬁne, its terraces which we ascend, being framed by a
semicircle of high and rugged rocks, of a light brown and golden
colour. If Thebes had been in Greece, this is where its citizens
would have placed their theatre. The Egyptians whose thoughts
were fuller of death than of life, founded a sanctuary for the
worship of the dead. Apparently an avenue of sphinxes, of which
some traces remain, connected this with the landing-stage, where
boats coming from Karuck on the W. bank were anchored. This
magniﬁcent work was carried out during the rise of the New Era--
pire, and the numerous processions of pilgrims began in the
16th cent. 3.0. The laying out of the terraces was begun by Tut-
mes L, and completed by his daughter, Queen Hatshepsu, or Ha»
tasuuRamaka, familiar to us as the raiser of the great obelisk of
Karnak (p. 133). Here too her brothers, Tutmes H. and 111.,
although their names are mentioned, fall into the background
when compared with their energetic and ambitious §i§ter° After-v
