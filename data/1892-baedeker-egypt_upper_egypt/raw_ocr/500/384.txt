On the pillar between the two columns to the right of the en-
trance to the main temple is another Greek inscription. This is a
decree of Aurelius Besarion, also named Amonius, military governor
of Ombos and Elephantine, ordering the owners of swine to remove
their animals from the holy Talmis. It probably dates from the
year 248-9 Al). --- On the left side of the elegant tmtraneB-i1oor

Beside him stands Hir-si-iid (Horus, son of Isis), the lord of Talmis.
Leaving now the entrar1ee-wa11 with its four columns behind us,
we tind ourselves in the main building of the temple, . the portico
proper, which is 40 ft. deep and B6 ft. broad. This portice is con-
siderably higher than the three rooms behind it, from which a
double staircase ascends to the roof (now fallen) of the portion. It
has four, or including those of the entrance wall six, elegant ce-
iumns bn eaeh side, with varying capitals. Only two, on the left,
are now standing in the interior. 0n the E. wall the emperor ap-
pears saerifleing to the gods of Talmie, and adjoining this scene is
the above-mentioned relief of Amenhotep 11. presenting Wine and
milk to Khem'~Ammon. -- The next three rooms are small (171/2 ft,
deep and 40 ft. wide), and have saerif1eia1 scenes on their walls.
Each probably contained two columns, those in the second room
being still preserved. The staircase to the roof ascended to the left
from the first room, On the qutside of the W. back-wall of the
temple arevarious well-preeerved representations, including the god-
dess Isis with Ptolemy Gaesarion, son of J ulius Caesar and Cleopatra.
The temple, like that of Edfu, is surrounded by a passage, widen-
ing towards the rear and entered from the fore-eourt by doors on both
sides; and, as mentioned above, there is also a second and wider
passage outside the firM one, with which it has communication by
means of a door on the left side. This outer passage could be closed
by means of doors. The whole structure is a faithful reproduction
of an early Egyptian temple, but dates from Roman times.

The little *Temple of Bet el-Walli, situated upon a hill about
20 min. to the N., is much more noteworthy than the large Roman
erection at Kalebsheh. The way to it leads along the verge of the
mountain, level at first, but finally ascends steeply,, The temple
consists of a vestibule, of which only the side walls are now tstand-
ing, a main chamber, enteredby a central and two side doors, and a
small adytum, adjoining the letter. In the vestibule our (interest is
excited by the warlike scenes on the side-walls. These in sate
