the temple. In any case the chapels are too small to have admitted more
than the heads, of the deputatioms from other parts of Egypt. Great weight
is laid upon the sacred number seven, as shown in the number of the
chapele themselves and in the seven heads of gparrow-htswks represented
in each. That the king should appear as the seventh object of worship
along with six gods is undoubtedly unusual; but it may be explained by
the fact that Seti built the seventh chapel, not for the adoration of him-
self while alive, but for a. future period when he hoped to be merged in
Osiris. Neither Seti nor his son could avoid the interment of their mum-
mies near the royal residence of Thebes; but it may be assumed that their
earthly remains received consecration at Abydoe, end that the Memnonium
of Seti is to be regarded as a cenotaph, in which the Name of Pharaoh,
as a. symbol of the king himself, was to be honoured and preserved, The
Pharaohs of the early em ire possessed similar monuments here. These,
however, fell into decay uring the Hyksos period; and Beti was enabled
to do what unfavourable times had hindered hie predecessors from doing
- i.e. to build a new and costly Memnonium, in which a place was re-
served, near the tomb of Osiris, for the Names of his royal ancestors. In
the arches above the niches in the rear-wall of the chapels are several
representations of the king offering his Name, eymbolised by the cartouche
or ring CCCDi Which surrounded royal names. In this way Ahydoa
came to be the most important place for the preservation of lists of kings.
The columned aisle leading to Seti‘s Chapel (Pl. a) contains inscriptions
and representations relating to the king alone and showing us his relatiom
ship to the gods in its proper light. On the welled-up door to the first
hall we see Thoth, the Reason 0r Intelligence, the god of the sciences and
of historiea1 records, offering a "eriftes in front of an image of the king
(the latter unfortunately much damaged). The inscription reads 'I, Thoth,
the dweller in Abydes, come to thee on account of thy greatness and thy
glory. For the sake of thy sanctity as king, for the sake of thy might
and thy constancy on earth, and to make thee great', ete. -- On the col-
umns of the ilrst hall the king is represented as susrifUing and receiving
the attributes of the kingdom from Thoth, Anubis Apheru, Home the son
of Isis, and Henmutef, the high priest of Abydoe. The paintings on the
B. well of the same hall show us the king ate a boy, held in the erme of
Isis and euckled at the divine breasts of the Hathors. They admit him
to the place of Horus, that he. may increase in strength and ascend the
throne of Osiris as a men. Hathor, the queen-deity of Heliopolis in Aby-
dos, calls herself the mother of his beauty, and says to him: 'Thou hast
been nourished by my milk, thou who art adorned with the crown of Up er
Egypt‘. The Hethor of Denderah calls herself his nurse, who raised er
arms to embrace his beauty. On the left side of the door farthest to the
left, also leading to the second hall, we see the king, wearing a helmet,
while Thoth pours over his head the signs of life and dominion. To the
right the king appears with the richly decorated royal crown, holding the
eeeptx-e and scourge in his hands. The priest Henmutef burns incense be,
fore him, and the Nile brings him gifts, of which he is the producer. The
king has now passed from the boy Horus to the men Osiris; Henmutef
says: 'I burn incense to thee and to thy name, 0 Osiris, King Ita-ma-men',
The words put in the mouth of the Nile are: 'I bring to thee in my arms
the mtpesrfiuity es en oif'ering, 0 King, lord of both worlds!' On the Miles
of the columns facing the aisle leading to the royal chapel are represented
'tputs/ia-API-a handing to the king the attributes of constancy and might;
Thoth, either pouring the water of life and dominion over the king, or
addreSSing him in set speech, with a roll in his left hand; Henmutef ex-
hurting him, atserifleing to him, and reaching him the sign of approval

, thus reminding us of the passage in Diodome which tells us that
it was the duty of the priests to praise and warn the kings. The king
has instituted festivals in honour of Horns, and Home in return throws
him the symbol of life, Isis, holding in her hand the lotus-tstaff, entwined
by the Urmueueerpent, also invests him with life, which here as olae-
where included life beyond the grave, which the Egyptians termed the
true life. On the 8. wall of the second hell Seti is repre nt ted
