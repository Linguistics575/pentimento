temple was destroyed only a few months before Champollion’s &rsrn
rival at ty1amgttt in 1829, and only a few scanty traces of it (a basin,
some faint hieroglyphice, etc.) are now left. The sanctuary, which
stood within the wall, was dedicated to Sebek end Hehent and
existed even under the 18th Dynasty. Champollion saw here the
enrtouchee of Tutmee IL, Remake, Amenhotep 111., two scenes in
which Ramses 11. did homage to Sehek and Hebent, and Hakoris
and Nectanehus I, from later times. The town itself was founded at
a much earlier date, and in fact is, as we shall see, one of the very
oldest in Egypt. It existed even under the ancient empire. During
the period of the Hykses it was scarcely less eonspieaoasly than
Thebes the residence of the legitimatePheraohs who had been driven
towwds the S. The most important monuments for the history of
the freeing of Egypt from the foreign domination are to be found
here.

ROCK Inscnmoxs. -- The route leads due E. from the Til, gate-
way in the girdle-wall, and crosses the dazzingly white sand, past
a small ruined Temple close to the wall. In rather more than 1/2 hr.
we reach the small temple of Thoth, known to the Arabs as el-,
Eammdm (p. 239). We keep straight on, leaving the larger temple
of the Ptolemiee on the left, and soon reach two Rocks projecting
from the plain, at the point where the road turns N, towards the
desert, halfway between elalflammém and the E, temple of Amen-
hotep III. Both rocks bear numerous inscriptions, most of which
use the hieratic contractions. The royal names of Pepi and Teta
refer these to the 6th Dynasty. The inscriptions are chiefly names
of priests and their sons, who probably selected this spot for the
consummation of the "eriilats to the after-world, At all events there

are but few representations of offerings to the local goddess to

mtrent-Eilisithyia. There are also some brief prayers. On the
S.W. side of the larger rock is a very interesting Figure of am An-
cient King, with bare head, above which hovers the disc with the
Urasasirpynt,

The small temple or CHAPEL OI? AMBNHOTBI’ III. lies fully 1/. hr.
to the E. It may be reached direct in about an hour from the Nile,
though the ehadeless route, ecpecially " midday, is somewhat fati-
guing. The little temple which is nearly 50 ft, deep is of consider-
able interest from the artistic forms which it displays, The small
Calla (221/3 by 19 ft.) stands upon a paved platform, which was at
one time surrounded by a wall of freestone. The gateway still
stands, and was formerly connected with the sanctuary proper by a
passage, at the sides of which stood smooth columns with aslyx-
capitals.

' The INTERIOR of the cella forms a. single octagonal chamber, the roof
of which is supported by four sixteen-aided columns. An attempt was

made, as we have already noted at Dér tsl-tsaw, to continue this eolumn-.
form of the ancient monarchy, along with the pleet' d - “ends of the
