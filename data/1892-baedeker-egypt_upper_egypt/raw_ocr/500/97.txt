better class. It was probably founded by Soter l, and in the time
of the Pharaohs it was called Neshi and Pascbeh (Croeodilopoltu),
afterwards Pse-ptulmaios; under the Ptolemiee it was known as
Ptolemqis-Hermiu Pasui (dwelling of the crocodile). The offitOhs
of Abydes also resided here. The mounds and river-walls at Men-,
shiyeh (no inscriptions) are certainly extensive, but still it is diffla.
cult, when face to face with them, to credit the statement of the
usually trustworthy Straho: 'farther on is the town of Ptelemeis,
the largest in the Thebaid and not inferior in size to Memphis. Its
constitution is drawn up in the Hellenic manner', The Ptolemaic
kings who died here received the same honours as the manes of the
Pharaohs at Abydos. According to Leo Afrieanus Menshiyeh was
the seat of an African prince named Hawiira, Numerous antiquities
have been found here lately.

Before we reach Girgeh the mountains on the Arabian bank
approach close to the stream. At several points are roek-tombs,
either wholly destitute of inscriptions or with none but obliterated
Specimens.

MW, M. Girgeh, on the W. bank, is a srteamboat-sution, with
post and telegraph ofmsets; the touristwsteamers stop for the night
here.

Girgeh, which is 336 M. from mm}; and 236 M. from Amman, has
been from time immemorial the station where the Nile-beatmen halt to
bake a new supply of bread. Ass, however, this operation takes " hrs.
(a supply for several weeks being necessary), and as Girgeh is not a con»
venient place for so long a stoppage, the traveller is advised to make a
eontraet in Cairo before starting to the effect that the halt for baking be
made at Astsid.t 0r Keneh and not in Girgeh. No re‘is will give up this
grivilege, unless he has been previously beund down to do so in writing,

he customs of the Nile boatmen are almost as unchangeable as those of
the desert Arabs The only suitable way in which to iill up a halt of 2d hrs.
at Girgeh would be to make an excursion to the temple of Abydos, but
this is much more conveniently reached from Be1ituiish (p. w, A day
can be very prohtab1y spent at either Aaaiilt m- lgieneh, in the latter case by
a visit to the noble temple of Denderah (comp. the Contract at p. xxi).

Girgeh, which contains 14,900 inheh., preceded Aasiilt as the
capital ot Upper Egypt, but is now merely the chief place in the
province of Glrgeh, while the seat of the Mudfriyeh is at 8ohitg
(p. 48). It becomes more probable every day that Girgeh occupies
the site of the ancient This (hieroglyph. Tani), in which the god
Anhur (Greek Onouris) was specially worshipped (comp. p. 53).
Some ancient tombs of the 6th Dynasty exist here, including one
of the time of Merenptah; and a. little to the N. are some other
graves of the ancient kingdom. Many of the present inhabitants
are Cepte. Outside the town lies a Roman Catholic convent, which
is probably the oldest but one in Egypt; the abbot is a member of
the Fraternity of the Holy Sepulchre. The name of the town is
Christian, being that of St, George or Girges, the patron-aaint of
the Coptic Christians, a representation of whom, in his combat with
the dragon, is present in almost every Coptic ch ch. 8t. George
