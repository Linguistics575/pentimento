temple of Der el-hahri containing 163 mummies of priests and digaitar'iea
of the 19th, 20th, and ihii Dyn. besides & large number of pepyri, Osiris-
atatuetiag, cheats and boxes, hesitate of flowers, fnnereal oiWrings, etc.

their original tombs to preserva them from speliation. The cententa of
the tomb are now at Gizeh, where the deciphering of the papyri will be
undertaken.
