behind the fortress of Katesh. Then they pressed forth on the 8. side of
Kitch and attacked the centre of the legion of Ra, which was on the
march, and having no warning was unprepared for the battle. The archers
and chariots gave why before them. His Majesty alone had made a halt
to the N. of the fortress Kutesh, on the W. bank of the Omntes. News
was brought to His Majesty of what had happened. And behold, the king
rose up like his father Mont (the god of war); he seized his weapons and
put on his armour, like Baal in his hour. The noble horses that bore his
m 'esty (‘Vietory for Thebes‘ was their name) came forth from the stable
ofaitsmses, the beloved of Ammon, and the king dashed in his attack
into the midst of the miserable Kheta. He was alone and no other was
with him. And as he hastened on before the eyes of those that followed
him, he found himself surrounded by 2600 chariot: of war, (cut off) from
his return by all the warriors of the miserable Kheta and the heme
mus peoples that accompanied them; by the people of Arados, Mysis,
and Pisidia. (Aratu, Mass, Pidasa). Each of their chariots bore three men,
and they had all united themselves. 'No prince was with me, no general,
no commander of the archers or chariots. My soldiers have deserted me,
and my knights have fleri1 before them; not one of them has made a stand
to Bght by my side‘. Then spoke his majesty: 'Who art thou, 0 father
Amman? does a father forget his son? Have I ever undertaken anything
without thee? Have I not walked and do I not stand ever according to
thy words? Never have I tres eased thy commands ' ' . What are these
Semites to thee? Ammon ten are the godless helpless. Have I not offered
to thee countless traoriftetss.9 Through me thy holy dwelling was filled
with my captives. I have built thee a temple for millions of years, and
I furnish thy store-honses with all my goods. I brought the whole
world to thee to enrich thy possessions; 30]) oxen I aaeriliead to thee on
all manner of sweet-smelling wood. I have not failed to make thy fore
court. Stone yeee I erected for thee, and I myself erected the flag-shams
before them. caused obelisks to be brought from Elephants, and it was
I who caused stones of eternal duration to be brought. For thee ships
plough the deep and bring to thee the tribute of the nations, Surely a
wretched fate awaits him who resists thy commands, but happiness will
he to him who knows thee. I beseech thee, o father Ammon, look upon
me here in the midst of countless peoples who are strange to me. All
nations have united themselves against me, and I am alone and no one
is with me,, My numerous soldiers have deserted me; no one of my
knights looked oat upon me when I called them; none of them heard
my voice, But I believe that Ammon is of more value to me than a
million of soldiers, than a hundred thousand knights and a hundred
thousand brothers and Young sons, even were they gathered together in
one lace. The work of multitudes of men is as nothing, Ammon out-
weig as them all. This have I tuseomplitshtsd, O Amman, according to the
counsel of thy mouth, and have not exceeded thy commands. Behold,
I have aid honour to thee to the uttermoet ends of the earth‘. My voice
sounds to Hermonthis and Ammon came at my cry. He gave me his
hand I uttered a cry of joy, and he spoke behind me: “I hasten to thine
aid, 6 Ramses, my son, beloved of Ammon. I am with thee“. -- In the
farther course of his speech, Ammon says: ''Not one of them (the foe)
finds, his hand to fight, their hearts have vanished from their breasts for
fright; their arms have become weak. They are no longer able to launch
their arrows, and strength fails them to hold their spears. I thrust them
into the water, so that thay fall in like the eroeodila, They lie prone, one
upon another, and I spread death in their midst. I will not that one
should look behind him or that another should turn himself. m who
falls there shall not rise again", The king of course, as the apes goes on
to narrate, completely vanquished the Asiatics allied against him after
hard flghting and after his ishariotear himself had lost courage. - ihiirii;
the prince of the Khets sends a messenger with a letter. His submission
is accepted; and Ammon greets the Pharaoh returning in triumph.
