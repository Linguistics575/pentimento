234 Route 22. ESNEH. From Thebes

this fish, which appears not only on the coins, bat is also repre-
sented with the disc between the home, was used as a symbolical
representation of Ehaum-Ra, especially as we actually tInd Khnum

united with the tish on the rear-wall of the temple??? ,

The SIDE WALLS are entirely covered with paintings end in»
sseriptiomu The former show the king making offerings, to various
divinities of the temple, who promise him in return the good things
of life. At the foot of the wall to the right of the entrance is the
emperor Commodus with Aruéris and Khnum capturing with a net
the various products of the Nile (birds, flssheis, plants, etc.) On the
other side of the net is Safekh. This symbolical representation 903-
sibly refers to the legend according to which Horus flghting against
Seth-Typhon fell dead into the water and was drawn out of it
again living, MtMtWMrMt, a legend, which is connected with the course of
the moon, A main door and two side portals are seen in the rear:
wall of the temple. The latter probably gave admittance to e corri-
dor surrounding the Sanctuary, which was entered by the central
portal. Recent excavations in this direction have hitherto remained
without result.

On the pieces of wall between the pillars on the Front are sev-
eral highly important inscriptions , of which by far the most
valuable is the celebrated Calendar of Festivals on the wall-pillars
to the right and left. A specimen of the eccentricities and freaks
indulged in by the hierograinmatiste under the Romans, may be
seen in the crowd of erecodiles on the pillar at the extreme left of
the E. or entrance wall.

The 24 Columns of the portico are specially noteworthy on ac-
count of the shapes of their capitals, some of which are overladen
with ornament. Of the columns, 18 stand detached, while 6, to-
wards the front, are built into the outer well. All the columns have
tut plinths, and shafts most elaborately adorned with inscriptions.
The Capitals are of various shapes and of unequal height, but this
irregularity does not offend the eye owing to the fact that the ennuli
of all the columns are arranged so as to lie in the same horizontal
plane. Most of them. belong to the calyx order, and are not adorned
merely with painting as at Kamak or the Ramessenm, bat with
richly carved ornaments from the vegetable kingdom.
