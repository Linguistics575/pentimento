‘Herodotue of Halieamassue beheld and admired'. Beneath, in a
later style of writing, is the word OYAAMQE 'not at ali', indicating
the unauthentic character of the inscription above.

31/2 M. Herr, on the E. bank, prettily situated beneath BP54b'''
mores and date~palme, contains mud-heueee. The one br'iek-bui1ib.
ing is the residence of the Kashef, who was formerly independent
ruler of'Lower Nubia and owned a large harem. Outside the town,
about half-way to the hill, lies the mosque of a saint. The top of
the hill commands an attractive view of the town and the Nile, Near
its foot lies the small and unfortunately much injured Rock Temple
of Dew. The vestibule, the sides of which were formed by the
smoothed rocks of the hill, and which was 421/2 ft. deep by 46 ft,
broad in the open air, contained a triple row of pillars, of which the
hindmost alone is standing. This row has oiirig-f1gurtrs against the
pillars (as at Meiltnet-Habu, p. 175, etc.). The two front rows and
the gateway are now represented only by fragments a few feet In
height. 0n the back of the left side of the gateway are some traces
of a warlike scene, with chariots and warriors. .The right side-well
of the vestibule was covered with warlike representations, now much
damaged, in three rows. In the topmost row only the legs of the
tigtires are now left. In the second row Ramses IL, founder of this
temple, can be distinguished in his chariot accompanied by a lion,
before a group of prisoners. The lowest' row showed the king
launching arrows against his fltsaing fees. We see the fugitives eon-
veying their wounded to the mountains, where a herdsman’s family,
surrounded by their domestic animals, wait in grief and anxiety for
their eon. 0n the left wall also are remains of three scenes, include
ing one in which the king leads two rows of ceptives to Harmeehis.
The third row of pillars, hewn out of the rock and still standing,
bore dedicatione from the king to various gods. The representations
on the back wall of this hall, to the right and left of the entrance
into the dark excavated part of the temple (lights necessary), are
specially effective. . ,

On the right side the king holds by the hair some foes, bending
in presence of Ammon-Ra, while between the king's legs is his
lion, here said to follow the king and to slay his enemies. The
heads of the king and the god are unfortunately destroyed. To the
left of this scene are two smaller ones showing the king before Ptah
and (Sekhet) before Thoth. Beneath is a row of the king's daughters
with sietra, corresponding to a row of his sons, with fans, headed
by Amenhikhopeshf, on the left wall, The chief scene on the left
wall, above the king’s sons, shows the king fighting against his fees
in presence of the hawlr-htssUd Harmaehis, with the lion biting the
leg of one of the fees. In the smell adjoining scene, Ramses presents

"hh, the ram's-headed Khnum with a figure of Ma, goddess of truth.
