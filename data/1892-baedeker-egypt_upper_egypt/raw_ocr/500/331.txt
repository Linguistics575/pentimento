all three divisions beneath the hips. Thence downwards the proportions
according to the second and third canons are the same; but those
of the upper part of the body differ very essentially. The head is larger,
the chest recedes farther, the abdomen is higher. The contours be-
come in general fuller, and abandon that early beautiful aimplieity and
tenderness of form, on which depended their imposing and specially

sequenee of their (the gods') goodwill towards them“. From this inscrip-
tion it appears that the garrison and omeiah, of the Nubian district, which
included Umboe, undertook an adornment of the temple of the gods, to
whom they applied the Egyptian name Aroerie (Herwar) and the Greek
name Apollo, in gratitude for some special mark of favour shown to them

Beside the door of the next room, the second in the direction
of the Proneos, is a seven-lined Calendar of Festivals. The hall
itself was built by Euergetes IL The third room is the tlrtyt that
shows Ptolemy WL Phuometor offering homage (cartouche see
