the contests of the god Home with his enemies who are depicted
as crocodiles and hippopotami, Perhaps the overthrow of the foes
of King Ptolemy X. Soter II. is symbolically represented in these
compositions. The cartouches on this wall probably belong to this
king; one of them contains the name of Ptulmis, while the other is
vacant. The name of Ptolemy XL Alexander L does not appear
until near the left extremity of the wall, towards the end of the
list of names.

The Representations, ranged in two registers, are 22 in number. The
chief are the following: Igt Scene (below, to the right). The king, stand-
ing on shore, attempts to transflx e hippopotamus, that bends its head
aside. Horus, who is accompanied by his mother Isis does the same; in
his left hand he holds a chain, and in his right agavelin; beside the
helm is a small 2rotsmr.--2rid Scene. The king appears on land, before
two ships, in each of which are a Harm and an assistant with a, boat’s
head. Horus holds the hippopotamus with a chain and pierces its head
with a javelin; the assistant carries a javelin in his right hand and a
knife in his 1eft.--mth Scene. The hippopotamus lies on its back, with
a chain fastened to its hind feet.--7th Scene (the flnest of all). Horus,
in a ship with expanded sail, aims a blow with his right hand at the
head of a. hippopotamus, whose hind foot is caught in a. line held in the
god's left hand. Isis kneeling in the bow of the boat holds the head of
the animal by a cord. The king, standing on the bank with two atten-
dants armed with javelin and knife, seeks to pierce the skull of the
hippopotamus. -

On the inside of the N, 6tirdle-wall (Pl. g g) are several long
hymns to the god of Edfu. -- The traveller is recommended to walk
round the outside of the girdle-wall, which is also completely
covered with representations and inscriptions. The Myovty-mentiomytl
important inscription relating to the history of the temple is to be
seen on the outside of the W. Wall (Pl, i), and the description of
the various rooms outside the E. Watt (Pl. k). The eight Records
of Donations of Fields are~alse on the E. wall. These inscriptions
and the decoration of the entire external face of the girdle-wall
date from the reign of Ptolemy XI. Alexander L (i06-'37 13.0.).

The half-lm' Birth House (Mameisi), lying to the left of the entrance
to the great temple of Horus, is less worthy of a visit,, It was built by
Ptolemy IX. Euergetes IL, while the interior deceratione date from
Soter II. In the Interior are seven representations of Hathor, who faeili~
tate the birth of the young Home and nourish him,
