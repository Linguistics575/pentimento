of which tombs have been found, is open to question. Hardly any
traces of earlier monuments have been discovered. The. earliest
prosperity of Thebes dates from the eclipse of the first flourish-
ing period of Memphis. Previously it was named the southern On,
in distinction to Heliopolis, the northern On. A legend, known
to us, however, only from inscriptions of a later date, narrates that
Osiris was born here. Such a myth can scarcely have been invented
in later times, for from the beginning of the New Empire onwards,
Osiris fell into a position quite subsidiary to the other gods of Thebes,
esgeeially to Ammon-Ra with whom Math and Khunsu formed a
triad, Only in connection with the worship of the dead did Osiris
retain his leading rank. Among goddesses a Hethor seems to have
enjoyed especial honour from the earliest times; and even till a corn-
paratively late date the meme Phathyrites (the Pathros of the Bible),
of which Thebes was the flourishing capital, was calle√©i after her the
'Hathor district". Under the early empire the afterwards gigantic city
was not conspicuous. It is seldom mentioned, and even under the
13th Dyn, Assit4-Lyeopolie o, 31) is described as the chief town of
Upper Egypt. When the Hyksos invadedthe Nile valley, the legitimate
princes, who had ruled from the Mediterranean to the Cataracts, were
driven to the south. Here they reigned during several inglorious
ce nturies, until ltaskenen and King Aahmes (p. XXIII) arose and under
the banner of Ammon of Thebes expelled the strangers. The succeed-
ing princes, won important victories not only on Egyptian soil but
also in Asia, always fighting under the auspices of Ammon with
whom was joined the Re of Lower Egypt, and who, as we have seen
(Vol. L, p. 138), was speedily placed at the head of all the national
gods. The liberation of the country was directed from Thebes, and that
city continued for centuriesto be the favourite seat of the Pharaohs,
and the reservoir into which flowed the untold treasures exacted as
tribute or brought as booty from Asia to Egypt. A large share of this
wealth was bestowed upon Ammon. The magnificent and gigantic
temple, erected at this period to the god, is still one of the chief
sights of Thebes. The grandees of the kingdom esteemed it an honour
to become priests of Ammon, the schools beside his temples flourished,
and the kings offered their richest gifts to this god, from whom they
expected a surer fulfilment of their petitions than from any other,
Thus Thebesbecame the city ofAmmon, the No or No-Amon of Serip-
ture and the Diospolis of the Greeks. Victory over foes was the burden
of ever/prayer of the Pharaohs at this culminating period of Thebes,
and the warriors led out by the monarchs were drilled under the eye
of the god. In the introductory remarks on the history of Egypt
mention has already been made of the great warrior-princes who
placed Thebes at the zenith of its fame, and in the description of
the various monuments reference will again be made to them. Here
it may he added that the fame of the huge city early reached the
ears even of the Greeks. In a possibly interpolated passage of the
