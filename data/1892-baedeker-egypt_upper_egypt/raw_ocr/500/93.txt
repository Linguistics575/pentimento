of the hill behind Kan ty1-Ketrtr, Two of the piers of the grotto in
which the representation occurs, bear pictures of Antaeus.
. At the beginning of the present century an interesting temple stood
on the site of the old town of which the last column was washed away
by the Nile in 1821. Jamar , who described thia temple during the French
Expedition, when the water already lapped its foundations, foretold its
fate. The temple was dedicated by Ptolemy Philometor and his wife
Cleopatra to Anteeus and was restored by Marcus Aurelius Anteninus and
his colleague Verus (164 ADJ. This information was conveyed by a
double inscription, in Greek and in hieroglyphics, over the portal,, The
bulls of the hieroglyphic inscription taRkta (Eda) probably
denoted the name of the town. The temple was built of limestone and
was at least 225 ft. long, 52 ft, wide, and 51 ft. high. Its entrance faced
the river. The 18 columns, which were arranged in 3 rows, were 37 ft.
high, with a diameter of 271/; ft., and ended in palm-leaf capitals. If the
gigantic blocks that Jemard found on the ground were really parts of
the ceiling, they exceeded in size those of Karnak, Which now excite
our astonishment. One of them was 32 ft. long, MI: ft. high, and 51/; ft,
thick, and must have weighed at least 48 tons.

To the S. of Kan el-Kebir the Nile makes ahead to the W. and
forms an island by dividing into two branches. On the W. arm (W.
bank), to the N. of the island, lies Kdu eb-Gharhi (W. Kim), the
seat of a. rebellion in 1865, which hadimportant consequences for
all the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and about which the Oriental

$ahtah, situated 2 M. inland, with 3000 inhab. and a frequented
cattle-market, ,

(ht the E, bank, a little higher up, rises the Gebel 8htkh el-
Hartdeh, with ancient quarries and (high up) tombs hewn in the
rock, the openings of which are visible from the river. The material
of which the temple of Autaopolis was built was procured in the
large quarries on the 8. side of the mountain, and consists of a
hard, fine-grained, grey shell-limestone, which smells unpleasantly
when rubbed but admits of a splendid polish. -- The next steam»
boat stations are el-Maraghilt and 8liendaufln, both on thew. bank,
A large market is held in the latter every Saturday, On the E. bank
of the stream, which here encloses several islands, are some rock-
tombs, without inscriptions. '
