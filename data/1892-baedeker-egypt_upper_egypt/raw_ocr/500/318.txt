Temple. EDFU. Ah Route. 251

served here. -rwmt, A Sidc-door (Pl. e) in the E, wall of the hypostyle
admits to the open passage between the temple and the girdle-mail.

The Ceiling of this hall, which, like that at Denderah, is named
thm, ‘the front room' or Khemt m, 'the great antmshamber', is
completely covered with astronomical representations.

To the left are the first six Hour: of Night, to the right the second
six (Champollion, Mon. 11. pp. 123 he o, Above the door to the following
Hall D in a curious representation. he Jihm Due appears with the fl e
of a crowned beetle ascending from the horizon into a boat guide by
Her mat and Her khan: khrud. Next the sun, on the left, is Thom, on the
right Neith, and also Apheru (Anubis), Mat, and Halber. In an attitude
of worship, at the sides, are Four Senses,- to the right the eye and ear
(Le. eight and hearing) to the left taste (symbolized by a tongue) and
reason. At the top at1 this wall is a long astronomical frieze. First
appear tlguretr of the M 'Deeanf, at the end of which are the chief corr-
steilationg of the s. (Orion end the Satin} Cow or Sirius) and of the N.
(the ball's leg fettered by Ape), then come the Planets, the Mair with the
Fourteen Steps of the waxing moon, the gods corretsponding to those lunar
days, representatives of the 30 Day: of the Month, the Gods of the "
Months, and flntsuy three Female Figure: with raised hands i'.

On the Ar, Wall of this hall, on either side of the door to Hall D,
are scenes from the Founding of the Temple by the King similar to those
at Denderah. They are continued along the W. wail oi, the hall.

Next, as at Denderah, follow three Proeekos Halls, with their
side-eh-yrs, and here also the flrgt of these, the Hat or chtal
Hall (Pl. D) is much the largest. This hall is the only one of the
three that has columns, of which there are 12 arranged in three
rows, while the corresponding hall at Dendereh had only 6 columns.
The side-chambers, however, are more numerous atDenderah, where
there were six, three on each side, while here there are bat four,
viz. the Laboratory (Pl. XVII) and a Passage Room (Pl. XVIII) in
front of it, on the W. side, and on the E, side another Passage Room
(PL, xxx), in the S. wall of which is a door leading to a Corner
Room (Pl. xxx). The next of the prosekos halls is the Hall of the
Altar (Pl. c), with two sidB-ehambers (Pl. xrv on the W. and
P1. XVI on the E.), whence we reach the two great staircases lead-
ing to the roof of the temple. Both the structure of the staircases
and their plastic adornment closely resemble those at Denderah.
From the third and last Prosekos hall; the Wall of the Centre' or
of the 'Reptue of the Goda’ (P1. B), we enter on the right the two
connected 'Rooms for the tWering of what is necessary' (Pl. x11 Szxux),
and on the left the 'Room of Ehem' (Pl. xi), We now reach the
Balms Rooms. The Sanctuary (P1. A) in the centre is, like the
sanctuary at Denderah, surrounded on all sides but the front by a
Corridor (P1. t), from which l0 Bide-Chambera open (Pl. I-‘VI on the
left or W., vn-x on the right or E. side). On the inside wall of
the corridor, Le. on the outside of the sanctuary, are represented
the gods of the districts or names. -w- All these rooms, their size
and use, their plastic decorations, the painting , gilding , etc. are
fully described in the inscriptions and in the reliefs.
