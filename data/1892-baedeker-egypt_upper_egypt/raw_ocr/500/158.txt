Antiquities. THERE‘S. 9,, Route. 103

Other claims upon the traveller‘s time will be made in Thebes. If he
have paid a visit to one of the eosisa1arageatis, he will be invited to a
Fantaetya, and if he have brought good introductions, the fat1taatya will
be preceded by a dinner. Among the modern Arabs the word 'fantastya'
is applied to every kind of amusement, from the aimless discharging of
muskete, to the greatest festivity. In the present connection it aignifitss
an evening party, at which the chief entertainment is the more or less
skilful dancing of hired ghawézi, and Which is recommended especially
to gentlemen who have not before seen anything of the kind. Chihouks,
cigarettes, coffee, and liqueurs ere olrered to the guests.

Antiquities, The traveller in Thebes is frequently tempted to purchase
antiquities. Half the populatipn of Luxor is engaged in trafiie with an-
tiquities, and the practice of fabricating scerebeei and other articles
frequently found in tomb: is by no means unknown to the other half.
Many of the articles offered for ends are so skilfully imitated that even
experts are semetimee in doubt as to their genuineness; the ordinary
traveller eeldom or never secures an authentic s eeimen. Only as many
piaatree as they ask shillings tshould ever be 0 bred to the importanate
hewkere of antiquities at the temples and tombs. Those who desire e
genuine memorial of antiquity should apply to the director of the hotel
er to one of the above-named consular agents. Even in this ease, however,
absolute certainty is not attainable; for though honourable traders them-
selves, the consular agents are Iiabte to be deeeived in the purchesee
they make. Caution should be observed in the purchase of unopened
Papyrus Ram; for dishonest vendors are in the habit of pasting torn
fragments of papyrus (frequently found in tombs) upon canes so as to
present the appearance of genuine papyrus-rolls. Egyptian antique breezes,
_ with artifiet'tsl rust, are made wholesale in Trieste, Paris, and Hanan;

Cairo and Luxor have the beet factories for the fabrication of antiques in
terracotta. and carved wood. Valuable and genuine antiques may, however,
still be obtained in Luxor by those who are prepared to spend money,
The prices are high; M. being new charged for a. genuine searebeeue.
Good and reliable specimens. including papyri, may be obtained from
Mohammed M’hasseb and 'Abd el-Megid.

Photographs. Good photographs are produced by A, Beato in Luxor;
but even in 8hepheariPa and other hotels in Cairo, excellent photographs
of Egyptian temples are sold at moderate purines. Those by H. Béchard
are distinguished for artistic teeter, those by Sébah are also good, TMEM- Photo-

the W. bank they must he ordered beforehand. -. Little girls with water-
bottles run after the traveller, especially on the W. bank, keeping up
with the donkeys with tireless agility. One should be selected and repaid
with a few piastree on the return. The attractive faces of these merry
children sometimes vividly recall the portraits of Egyptian women of the
time of the Pharaohs.
