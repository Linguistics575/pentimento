identified as Zekkeri (Teucrians) from the curious striped. cape, not unlike
an Indian headdress. In the middle, among the latter, are oxwwaggena with
children in them. Some of the Egyptian soldiers are Shardane, distinguished
hv the conical ornaments on their helmets. These, at firgt enemies of Egypt,
a terwerde took service under the Pharaohs. -mBF 7th Scene (beyond a gap
in the wall). The king et a lion-hunt, One of the lions, concealed in a
thicket, has been pierced by the king’s spear and arrows; another lies
dying beneath the horse’s feet-, and the king turns to traaufix a third, of
which only the claws are shown. Beneath is a procession of the Egyptitn
army with allies (Shardana and Kehak). -- 8th Scene. The king, having
alighted from his chariot, shoots against the hostile fleet. The painting
illustrates the occurrence mentioned in the inscription of the 8th year,
on the second pylon (p. 176) as well as in the long inscription in the
eolonnaded room. The hostile Shamans and. Zekkuri (Sardinima and
Teucrians) had penetrated into the Nile delta, where they were held fast,
like birds in a net, by the Egyptian army, until they fell beneath the arrows
of the king and his followers. We may elearly distinguish the Teucriams
by their caps resembling tufts of feathers, the Shardana by their horned
helmets, and the Egyptians by their laced htsad-elothg, The representation
is exceedingly animated, though not very distinct in the oblique light,
One of the ships has capsized. The Egyptian vessels are denoted by the
lion‘s head on the prew. The ship below to the right is steered by two
men with large ours, while the rest of the crew are rowers heated upon
benches. Archers standin up ply their hows. In the interior of the ship
are a. number of bound eucriens, and others appear in the lower row.
The king himself is treading upon a captive foe. In front of him are
some archers, and above him, the protecting vulture Uazi. - WK Scene.
The king, having alighted from his chariot. graciously receives the grandma
who conduct the prisoners. In the lower row the severed hands are
being counted and the number noted. Above the horses a fortress is
represented, named Makatiro (Migdol castle) of King Ramses. - 10th Scene.
The king presents two rows of captives, described as Zekkeri (Teueriaua)
and Babe (Libyane), to Ammon, Math, and Khunau, the Thehan triad.

We have now reached the second pylon, between which and the flrtst
pylon are two more Reliafs. One represents the king attacking a hostile
fortress, whose defenders, many of whom are pierced with arrows, beg
for mercy. The other depicts the king waving his sword, at the
head of his charioteera, as he attacks a ortresa. Some of his soldiers
are beating in the doors, while others ascend by ladders. Trees are being
felled in the vicinity.

On the outside of the 8. Watt (P1. f) of the temple is A Ion Festival
Calendar, which contains a list of the appointed ttattr1ifletyt, for t a period
between the 26th Pukhen (the day of Ramses 11133 accession) and the 19th
Tyhi. The mention of the rising of Bothie (Sirius) on the int Thoth
(beginning of the year) hag led to the probably moueoue assumption that
under Ramses m. the Sothis-year of 3651/4 days coincided with the
Egyptian civil year of M5 days, and has thus provided a. Bxtril era. for
Egyptian chronology.

c. The Small Temple of Kedinet Hahn.

We now quit the large temple, beside which we note the con»
siderahle ruins of the Christian village, whose church stood in the
second court (p. 177). We retrace our steps between the pylons,
and to the left we see the smaller temple, founded under the 18th
Dyn., the oldest part of the remains at Medinet Habu. Even if the
inscriptions had been defaced, the architectonic forms here used
would have told us in what epoch of Egyptian history the building was
erected. Its axis is not exactly parallel with that of the temple of
Ramses. The small temple was entered from the E It is open
