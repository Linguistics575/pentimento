274 Route 28. FIRST CATARACT. From Assurin

are fastened to the mast, and the severe struggle with the descend-
ing current begins. Some haul on the ropes from the bank, others
guide the course of the vessel with poles from on board, and others
in the water keep it upright or ward it off from striking on sharp
rocks in the river-bed. Old men, young men, and boys rival each
other in the most exhausting activity, that seems almost frantic,
from its never-ceasing accompaniment of shouts, cries, and chants.
Every saint in the calendar is invoked, especially the btsnef1eent
Sa'id, who is believed-to render eSpecially "eetimy aid in eudclen
dangers. At the most difficult point, the Bab eb-Kel/ir (p. 278)
boys, for a small fee, will plunge htstd-t1rst into the stream, to
reappear astride pieces of wood below the boiling surf, through
which they swim with marvellous skill. If the work is not accomm-
plished before sun-eet, it is left tgniinighei1 till next morning. -ewt
It may be remarked that the Egyptian government contemplates
widening the channel and introducing fixed regulations for' the
passage. -- The time occupied in taking the dhahabiyeh through the
rapids may be advantageously turned to account by the traveller by
first inspecting the cataract from the bank and then, by proceeding
by land to Philae, where he should pitch his tent or take up his
abode in the Osiris room (p. 995). The most necessary articles can
easily be transported through the rapids by a few of the sailors
in the small boat. The dragoman will arrange the new household
with the assistance of the cook and the earnp-serTant. A few days
spent at Phila, especially at full moon, will not easily be forgotten.
---It is not advisable to bring the dhahebiyeh as far as the island
of Sehél and to visit Philae thence, because there are no donkeys
to be there obtained.

Railway in 1/2 hr., fare 5 piutres; one train daily (1891) to Shellil
at 8.30 Bum, returnin‘g at 11 am. - The Ride to Philte takesni‘lz ht;
excellent donkeys at the Ianding-plaee. Rich inhabitants of Aasunn spend
large sums upon their riding-apsi, spirited Abyssinian donkeys, if they
are also handsome, cost from 30t. upwards. -- The inspection of the ob-
jects of interest of Assuz’in occupies 3-4 hrs.

The route leads past the Poet RMee into the town, then turns to the
tight (leaving the Bazaar on the left) and follows the telegraph-wires
across a. (5 min.) bridgeover the railway to Philm (Shellil). The Ptole-
mak Temple lies a few minutes to the left; below (see below). Thence we
proceed straight on to the Mohammedan Tombs, passin l on the way the
graves of an Austrian and of a sailor of the British ship Monarch‘ (Dawe;
d. 1884). The Quarries are reached from the Ptolemaic temple by con-
tinuing straight on for a few minutes, then turning abruptly into the
desert path, which soon brings us in eight of tall blocks of stone, behind
which is the quarry (p, 276). The obelisk lien 10 min. to the right of the
oshovemeniioned European graves.
