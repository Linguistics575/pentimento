229 M. The rtri1mtstation, Bald; ed-Datrilr which is also the start-
ing-point of the direct line to Teh 4t1-Biiriid anti Alexandria, is situated
on the W. bank of the Nile, 3 M. from Cairo (connection with main
railwey-station in prospect). Carriage from the hotel to the station t fix;
for heavy luggage a second earriage is necessary, as the baggage-waggontr
cannot be implieitly relied on. Passengers should be at the station early,
as the processes of tieketuakhtg and luggage-weighing are by no means
expeditious, The first-elagi, eari-ieges are, of course, the most comfortable
from a European point of view, and firgtelagg passengers are allowed to
take with them in their compartment all their smaller ertielee of baggage

but the trains are generally late. A time-tahle showing the names of stations!

as no stoppage is made for dinner; eggs, bread, water (glass necessary) are
offered for sale at the stations. Seats should at Brst be taken on the right
side for the sake of the view of the Pyramids; from Minyeh onwards the
