railway and the villa of MaNntil Bey, and then passes the tomb of
a ehékh, where e. draught of good water is offered to the traveller
by a dervieh. A number of dry ditches must he crossed, and also
several canals, where the traveller on horseback will hardly escape
from wetting his feet when the water is high; if he rides on a
donkey, he should get the Arabs to carry him and his saddle across.
The tuy1i1g which we pass are remarkably well cultivated, and the
eye rests with pleasure on trees of various kinds, including flne
olives tn the gardens, with hedges of cactus. The vegetation is most
luxuriant in the neighbourhood of Fidrntn, a village pietureequely
situated on a slope, bat inhabited by a thievish population. The
Babr eg- ?'dluletek (‘mill river'), one of the broader canals, must he
crossed here,, Beyond this point the oountry is, at places, green and
well irrigated, and at others dry and sterile. One part of the route,
which is flanked by luxuriant gardens of olives, pomegranates, and
ftp, is very muddy. After a. ride of fully three hours we reach the
locks and the bridge Kandtir Hasan. The large body of water of
the canal, which is conducted from the Baht Ytsuf, here falls into
a. channel, which, with many ramifitratioms, eonveys it to the fityldg
of genhiir.

The large village of genhnr (rail. station, see p. 42) lies on the
border of the second plateau of the province. Those who visit Hla-
wiha (p. 38) reach the firgt plateau, while the second is crossed on
the way to fymhtr; the third lies at our feet when looking down on
the Birket tsr-Fun from the great K6171, Le. the ruin-strewn hill
to the N. of the village. The handsome house of the Shékh e1-
Beled offers good aeeommodation, and even quarters for the night.
The traveller should make a bargain here for a boat with the shiikh
of the tltihtyrmtm. About 30 ft, for the day, and a hahshieh for the
rowers (of whom 6-8 are necessary for speed), are demanded.

tysnhtr stands on the site of an ancient, and not unimportant,
town, of which large heaps of ruins still remain. Roman walls are
traceable in many places. A large building has recently been ty?,Or.
cavated by the peasants for the sake of obtaining the hard bricks
of which it is built, but part of it has already been removed. No
remains of columns or inscriptions have been met with.

From 'sphilr to the Birket erdrurihs takes about 11/2 hr, The route
leads through suger-plentatione. We reach the lake near the peninsula
known as et-t7ertreh, on which stands a heap of ruins. A short distance
to the W. are the scanty remains of el-Hammdm. The traveller, after
having ridden to the lake, should not forget to order hie horses, which
return to 13ettltilr, to await him for the return-journey at the spot where
he has quitted them, or to order them to meet him in good time on the
bank of the lake by Nezleh [see p. 42).

The Birket el-Eurtm (‘lake of the horns') owes its name to
its shape, which resembles that of slightly bent cowe’ home, It
measures 34 M. in length, and, at its broadest part, is about 61/2 M.
wide. It is situated on the same level as the Mediterranean, and
its depth averages 13 ft. The greenish water is slightly hr ckish
