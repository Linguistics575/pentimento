is the wee: 15mm“, where the green breecia was quarried in the moat
ancient times. In 1 hr. more we reach the Btr 2Jqmiimdt, a well 16 ft. in
diameter with a stone euping. Near the well are the remains of a Roman
wall, anti between the two are flee xutfiniahad sareophagi, some completely
shattered. Near the well begins a. series of short graffiti, including an
inscription of Phra em Mb, a eu erintendent of labourers, and represent-
ing Amman with e ram‘e heed eating the Atef crown. The certouehe
of Seti II. is also met with. About 1hr. farther on are longer inscrip-
tions, In the first a miner named Art on benipe is mentioned and the

symbol of the erow-her is given. The numerous inscriptions of the

old empire found here, belonging to the 5th, 6th, 11th, 12th, and 13th
Dynasties, have been published by Leeviue (Part IL of his 'Ihsnkmii1er0

corded; it gives the names of the stations, mentions the digging of two
cisterns, an relates the passage from Tut; (the early name of 1,,Cotiyr1 to

the later inscriptions of the 20th Dynasty may be mentioned one of the

and exceedingly hard diorite, Which was highly prized by the Egyptian
sculptors. This region is figured in the fragments of a map of the time
of Ramses IL new dpreserved In the museum of Turin; and from it it
would seem that gol also was procured in the Bekhen Hts. In the treuury
of the temple of Medinet Hebu we find mention made of gold from Kueh

should undoubtedly understand gold brought by the Koptos trading route,
but not gold obtained there. The Turin Muheum possesses the plan of

In the great inscription of Ramses IV. a complete list is given of all
the higher end lower offuia1s, as well as of all the workmen including
800 Aperiu (from the deaert to the E. of the Delta), who 'ii'iil been sent
to the quarries by command of the king. The total number emanate to
8388 souls, for whose support tsommitraariat columns were constantly
on the move between Koptoe and Bekhen. At line 18 we read: 'Total 8868.
Provisions for these were brought upon ten waggons, and six yoke of
oxen were attached to each waggon tn going from Egypt to the Bekhen

the genealogy of 25 architects. Xerxes end Artaxerxee are also mentione
in the ineeripth us of Persian officials,

Just beyond the quarries the route turns from the N.E. to the g. and
passes the ruins of el-rattrdkhir, an old mining site. Those who wish to
