the roof, and there are interior chambers as at Edfu (p. 249). A
small door in the gateway between the pylons also admits to the
pylon on the right. There are no hieroglyphies on the outside
of the pylons, the only place in which they are found being the
inner walls of the central gateway. On the left side here is an un-
named king making offerings to the god Thoth with the quadruple
crown, and to Tefnut and Esther, while Isis appears below. The
sculptures on the right side are destroyed. Numerous inscriptions,
ehiefly Greek though some are demotic, are found both on the out-
side of the pylons and in the central gateway.

The entrance of the Temple has two columns with palm-eap1-
tale. The portal has been partly destroyed, and the partition walls
crowned with serpents, which connect the columns with the sloping
buttresses, have been broken through the middle, and the represen-
tations upon them defaced. On the left (E) side the iasrnp1e-wal1
adjoins a wall of dressed masonry, which formerly enclosed the en-
tire temple, forming a kind of court; while another wider girdle-
wall, now disappeared, seems to have began at the pylons. A path
constructed of ancient hewn stones led from the pylon to the temple,
but this has been destroyed except close to the temple, so that we
have to climb up to the platform. The ilrgt; portion of the temple,
the Promos (P1. A), 241/2 ft. broad and 17 ft, deep, is covered
with huge flagistontssr, placed lengthwise in the direction of the
temple axis. The frieze beneath this roof beers the dedication-
inscriptions of the promos, that in the middle being a. much da-
maged Greek inscription between two winged serpents with royal
crowns. The following, words are still legible: -TM'.

From this we gather that the pronaos was dedicated to Hermes
Paotnuphisi m the Mth year of Euergetes IL (136 B, G .), by that king
and his wife and sister OleoPatre. Paotnuphie occurs as Pautnuphis
in another inscription, placed by Saturninue Veteranus Aquila,
who executed the gilding in the temple. The two-lim, hieroglyphic
inscription, on each side of the Greek, corresponds with the latter
to the left, Worhat (referring to the adjoining protecting vulture
with outspread wings), the great god, . . ' protect thy beloved son
Ptulmis Energetes and his sister and his wife Cleopatra, the divine
Euergetes, beloved of Thoth Penubs'; to the right the last phrase
is altered to ‘beloved of Isis, mistress of Piiak and the southern
gods’. On the right Horhut is described as dwelling in the northern
