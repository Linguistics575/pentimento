chm, a species of Hormyrus (Arab. Mizdeh), was held in such high honour
here, that the inhabitants refused to eat any fhsh caught by a hook, lest
the hook might previously have injured an Oxyrrhynchus. In the neigh-
bouring town of Cynopolis (see below) the dog was; held in eqmsl honour,
and Plutareh relates how a ‘very pretty qaarrei', the settlement of which
required the intervention of the Romans, arose between the two towns,
owing to the facts that the citizens of each had killed and dined on the
sacred animals of the other, Juvenel gives an account of a similar strife
between Ombos and Tentyra (p, W7). On the introduction of Christianity
Oxyrrhynchus became so "full of eonvents that monkish songs were heard
in every quarter", Convent jostles convent all round, forming as it were a
second town of monks. In the tith cent. the diocese of Oxyrrhynchus is
said to have contained 10,000 monks and 12,000 nuns. 1n the town iteelf
were 12 churches. Under the Arabs it is known only a8 Behnesah. In the
Mameluke period it was still of some importance, but it has since steadily
declined. From Behneseh the desert-route leads to the ‘small oasis‘ of
2ta?rtyeh, also known as the Oasis of Behnemh (comp. p. 343).

About 4 M. above Ahu Girgeh, close to the E. bank of the Nile,
are the 'insignif1eant remains of Shékh elmFadhl, near which is
Hamathah. Father Sicard’s discovery of a large number of dog-
mummies here proves that we are standing on the site of the necro-
polis of Cynopotis (ktsviiw otOua), the ‘city of the dogs', which, as the
above story indicates, must have adjoined Oxyrrhynchus. 8trabo's
words are: 'Next come the Cynopoliten nome and Cyn0polis, where
Anubis is worshipped and dogs are held sacred and fed with com-
secreted moat'. Several trough-like hollows and clefts have been
found here, some of which, in the rocks, are ld considerable size;
but no inscriptions have been discovered. Gynopolis itself, aceord-
ing to Ptolemy, lay on an island in the Nile, but no traces of it are
now visible. Opposite, 11/4 M. from the W. bank, lies the village

Kolosaneh (tail. stat., p. 1), 0n the t bank, has a large palm-
grove. Opposite (E. bank) lies Smariych. To the N. and S. quar-
ries are worked in the limestone rock. -- Among the rocks here is
a small temple (not very easily found), bearing the names of Seti ll,
and of Merenptah ITotepher-ma,. supposed to be the Pharaoh of
the Exodus (19th Dyn.). The kings are offering ssaerifiees to the
triad of Sebek, Hathor, and Horus, and representations of Sebek
(with the head of a crocodile), Rather, and Ramses III. may be
made out on the external wall of the grotto, facing the spectator.
The inscriptions are very indistinct but are couched in the usual
form of thanksgiving to the gods for the blessing of a long reign.

0n the W. bank lies tihunai1itt, with a. handsome railway-station
(p. o, sugar-factories, palms, and. fle1dig of clever. A. little farther
to the 8., on the E. bank, rise the steep rocky sides of the Gebel
st-Tie [‘bird-mountain’), with an extensive flat top bearing the
Captic convent of ssl-Bulk.' Those who wish to visit the moun-
tain should disembark just before reaching it and ascend on the N,

t Now gemi''ra11y called Dtr er-dhurah, from a Windlass (bukmh) used

in drawing water. But the name is probably derived from the old legend
of the Bnkir bird.
