the Greeks idtyntif1ed with Artemis. The Temple of this goddess,
hewn in the mek, consists of a vestibule and of an inner chamber
connected with the vestibule by a corridor. Above the door of the
vestibule is a long inscription of the time of the 18th Dynasty,
which celebrates the goddess Pasht and also speaks, under the name
of Ame, of the Hyksos in Avaris who from ignorance of the god
Ra destroyed the ancient temples.-

The temple itself was founded by Tutmes III. and renewed by
Seti I. Of the 8 pillars which supported the vestibule all have
been destroyed except two in the front row, which bear inscriptions
and royal eartouches on their W. and E. sides only. On tho W.
side of the recumbent pillar to the right Champollion saw the

name of Tutmes III. C) eeeh a) , All the other cartouehes are
those of Seti L, who is described as the favourite of the goddess
Pasht, the mistress of ts, M211 Matennu or the dweller in the

mountain q an Ant. 0n the rear-wall of the vestibule
are some intefesting representations. To the left is Pasht in the
guise of a mighty soreeress, stretching out her left hand to king
Seti L, behind whom, sitting in an attitude of benediction, is
the god Ammon-Ra. To the extreme left is the small figure of the
god Thoth, lord of Hermopolis. Appropriate inscriptions are
also furnished. To the right, in three rows, are the deities of Specs
Artemidoe (12 figures), beginning with Mentu and Tum, in front
of whom is Thoth, who conveys to the local gods the command of
Ammon-Ra that Seti I. shall be raised to the throne rHoru "
