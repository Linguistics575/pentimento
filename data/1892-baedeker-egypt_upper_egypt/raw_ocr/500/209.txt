and Auletee. Antoninue Pius bestowed some attention on the decoration
of this tsiriflets, the picturesque remains of which show that even in the age
of the Ptelemies the practice of using ancient columns for new buildings
was well understood, a practice which became very common under the
Arabs. The use of other ancient fragments of buildings (especially hewn
blocks of stone) was frequent even in very early times.

As we return, We may once more walk through the temple of Karnak,
e. digression which will not add more than 'is hr. to the day’s expedition.
If the traveller have made an early start, he may lunch in the hypoatyle
hall of Kamak, under the shadow of the largest columns in the world
where the destroyers of the temple and previous travellers have providezi
seats in the shape of blocks of stone.

B. THE WEST BANK AT THEBES.

Passengers by the threa-wtysks' tourisb.suamtm, devote the ist and 3rd
(Cook) or 2nd and 3rd (Graze) day of their stay at Thebes to the West
nenk; these by the foar-wtytylc'g steamers the 2nd and 4th (Cook) or 3rd
and 4th (Gaze) day; arranging in each case to spend the first day in a
visit to the eepulchrel temple of Seti I. and the Tombs of the Kings (RB. 19,
Al), and the second in visiting the Remeeseum, Shékh 'Abd etvgurneh,
Der el-Medineh, and Medinet Hahn (HR. 13-18). A different arran ement
is recommended on . 102, for a. three day'ss May at Thebes, accor ing to
which the flrgt day a visit to the W. bank ie devoted to the Colessi of
Memnon, Medi‘net Hahn, Dér eI-Medineh, Shékh 'Abd el-Kurnah (RR. 12-
18), and the next day to the eepulchral temple of Seti l, and the Tombs
of the Kings (RR. 19 20). 1f fVve days are spent at Thebes, three should
be devoted to the W. bank, the first being occupied try the Celoesi of
Memnon, the temple of Medinet Hahn, and Der el-Medineh (RR. 12, 15,
17), the second. by the Ramesaeum, the tombs of Shékh 'At1dprAryrna)t,
the temple of Der tsrmaltri, etc. (RR. 13, 18, 21), and the third try the
Temple of Seti I. and the Tombs of the Kings (BR. 19, 20), with which
Cookht and Gem‘s tourists begin.

The ensuing description follows the distribution of time suggested on
p. 102 for a three day‘s visit to Thebes.

The following points may be visited in e. singte day (the 2nd of our
stay in Thebes), though not without considerable fatigue: 1. ‘Coloeei of
Memnon; 2. *Rameseeum; 3. Tombs of Kurnet Murrai", d, I"Medium: Hahn;
5. Tombs: of the Queens and Dtr tsl-Madam; 6. Tombs of Shékh 'Ahd
ttl-Kurtis. A little time may be saved by heginnin at the Remeseeum,
and thence proceeding to the Coloeei of Memuon, Me inet Haha, elm; but
it is better to visit the Coleeei firsst, for they are at no time so impressive
as when seen in the early morning.

An early Mart should be made. Guidu, danteya, ete.1 see p. 103. If
the iihahabtyeh has been anchored at Luxor and not beside the W. bank
tt 100, it will be necessarfv to cross in a boat to the island opposite

uxor. Donkeys are usually band here, but a large party ig recommended
to order them the night before. The island, which is dotted with bushes
and at places we1r-ts11ltivtsttsd, is crossed in about 10 min., and the don-
keys then ford a shallow arm of the river. If the river is high, however,
travellers must row round the island. We pass the village, pleasantly
shaded by trees, and cross a very frail bridge over a watercourse descend-
ing to the Nile. 0n the bank is a handsome farm. - A Ferry (1/: piestre)
also crosses from Luxor and lands its passengers a little higheru , a tMMV.
venience if they are bound for the temple of Kurneh and the embs of
the Kings.

We have already seen that the streets of Thebes with the palaces
and the dwellings of the citizens lay near the great temple of Am-
