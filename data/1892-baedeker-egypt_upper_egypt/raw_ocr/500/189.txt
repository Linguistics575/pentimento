for the support of the flag-saves, The pylons Mag to the S. were
built by the kings of the 18th Dyn., and were connected with the side
of the great temple of Ammon, whence they were reached by a door
between Pylon III and Pylon IV (p. 146).

On the rear of the left side of Pylon III is a long inscription
(unfortunately imperfect at the top), recording the gifts of Amen»
hotep III. to the god Amman; and to the left is the representation
of several ships, reeordingra festival voyage instituted by the king
in honour of the god in his naos. The sanctuary existed before the
Hyksoe period, certainly under the 12th Dyn., and the conquerors
and expellere of the intruders erected in honour of Ammon sue-
cessive additions, increasing in size as they receded from the
sanctuary.

0n passing through the third ruined pylon into the Central
Court (Pl. E), we come first upon two OBBLIBKB, of which, however,
one has been destroyed, though Pocoeke saw them both erect in
1738. The standing obelisk (Pl. g) is, like most others, made of
granite from the quarries of Syene (Aswan). It is 76 ft,, high and
stands upon a base 6 ft. square. Only the lower portions of the
inscriptions on its faces are seriously injured. The central rows are
in larger and finer hieroglyphics than the side-rows. The former
date from the time of Tutmes L, the latter contain the names of
later appropriators of this monument. The usual formulae occur in
these inscriptions; Tutmes L, among other titles, is named the
vietory-bringing Horus, who fuit1ls the years and enlivens the hearts.
m, ‘the lovely son of the sun, erected this monument in honour of
his father Ammon, lord of the throne of the world, who is worn
shipped in E, Thebes ('Aptst'j', In front of this obelisk are the
remains of a cubical basis, which probably served to support a
colossus. The two ehelisks and the colossus marked the entrance to
the temple in the reign of Tutmes l,

Next follows Pylon JV, in such a ruinous condition that its ori-
ginel form cannot be ascertained. It dates from the time of Tut-
mes 1., who is represented by the 0siriir-eolarnmy attached to its
inner JO side. Only the N. door-pillar is now standing. It bears an

expresssion of homage to Ammon from Tutmes IV, (0 eeeh ),

bat beneath the arm of the king is a short inscription, in which the
Ethiopian Sahake records a restoration of the temple by himself.
A similar reference to his campaigns appears in the inscription on
the left side. Seti II. has also placed his name upon this doorway.

The doorway closing the fourth pylon on the E. fell during the
inundation of 1865. Beyond its site are a few ruined fragments of
a structure, the original arrangement of whiehAs only to be under-,
steod on the supposition that five couples of columns stood on the
left and six couples on the right, and that two couples were removed
from tsaehysiths to make room for two imposing Oh-oliske. The
