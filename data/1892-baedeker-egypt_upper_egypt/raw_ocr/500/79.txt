another almost illegible inscription, engraved, like a pelimpsest,
above an older text and referring to Wp-Zeta; on the same side
are eartouches of Userteeen L

Higher up, to the right (NO, is a row of three tombs close to
each other, the northernmost of which has been destroyed. The
second is the Kahf eV'A8dkir, or Soldiers' Tomb, so named from
the rows of warriors on its S. wall. On the right side of this tomb
is a long and partly tyftaeed inscription, referring not only to Rheti,
father of Tef ah, the owner of the tomb, but also to King Merikara
tt2th Dyn., acc. to Maspero, of the 10th or Heraeleopolitan Dyn.),
in whose reign Kheti lived.

The adjoining tomb (to the left or 8.; No. 3) contains a long in-
scription referring to ch Eb, a high-priest of Apheru (Anubis),
lord of Aiusiilt. A little farther to the S. is the tomb (No, lt) of an-

other J,rap-dihtr, son of M and headman of the district ofAtef-khent.

The geological formation of this hill of tombs is very interesting,
especially on account of the numerous specimens of Calls'anasu m‘lotica
and other fossils found on its upper part, The limestone is so hard
that it emits sparks, and hints occur in considerable quantity.

Among the curiosities of Assit) there moat not be forgotten the small
piece of water standing between the river and the town, the ancient le-
gend of whose emset upon virgins is still half seriously related. Paul
Lucas is probably the first author who mentions it, and Michaelis devotes
a paragraph to it in his edition of Abulfeda‘s Deaeription of Egypt (A.
189): 'De quo stagno fingunt Siutenses, ejus potu aigna virginitatis tripi,
undo excusatas habent novas nuptaa virginitatem non prodentesz gi stagnl
uqunm dtsgwstarant, Felix certe inventum, nec despero tales In vieimy tma-
rum quoque et Europae urbium, quod felix fauatumque virginibus
sit, fontes‘.

At Beni Mohammad eVKyftr, opposite Assiiiet, are several important
tombs of the 6th Dynasty, belonging to nomarcha and (probably) rela-

tives of King Pepi.

A Tom: rnnouaa THE Fn'fm, including a visit to the Labyrinth, the
site of Lake Maris , the Birket tsl-NTU with its abundant Wildfowl,
and the ruins in ite neighbourhood, takes 68 days, and requires a. tent,
a dragoman, end a supply of roviaions. A dragomnn charges 30-10 fr,
a day for each person, aeeordiag to the requirements of his employers,
and for that sum he is bound to provide them with a tent, prbvisions
(wine excepted), and donkeys, or other means of conveyance, and to
pay railway fares and all other expenses. A written contract (oomp.
p. xx), specifying the places to be visited, the points where some stay is to
be made (on which occasions a reduced charge per day should be stipulated
for), and other particulars, should be drawn up before starting. Those
who intend to visit Medinet e1Wayiim and its immediate environs only,
and who do not object to rough quarters for one or two nights, may
dispense with a. dmgoman and a tent, but should he provided with a
moderate supply of food. An introduction to the mudir will be of great
service in enabling the traveller to procure the neceasuy horsea or donkeys,
which the inhabitants are often unwilling to hire (comp. pp. 37, 42).

Since the completion of the railway this excursion has usually been
undertaken from Cairo, but It may also be combined with a visit to
Sahhinh. It was formerly usual to visit the Faydm in connection with
a journey up the Nile, but this plan entails needless expense, as the boat
and its crew have to be paid for while lying idle f ''W, ya. If,
