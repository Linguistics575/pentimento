poled out into the middle of the channel. The sailors accompany the
hoisting of the lateen sail with a lusty chorus, and if one of the brisk
'Etesia' blows, which Herodotus mentions as driving boats up the Nile,
the long pointed craft flies quickly along, passing in rapid succession
the Khedive’s palace and the barracks of Keel: en-Nil, Keer el-Ain,
the island of Itlii.1ah with its palaces (on the E. bank), and the chi-
teaux of Gezireh and Cizeh (W. hank). 01d Cairo lies on the E.
bank, and beyond it rise the Mohattam Mm, with the citadel and
Stab} 'Antar, a ruined Arab fort on the 8. end of one of their spurs;
on the W. is the group of pyramids at Gizeh. To the left (E. bank)
farther on, are the quarries and hamlets of Turah and Ma'earah (see
Baedeker's Lower Egypt, p. 403). Opposite, on the W. bank, rise the
pyramids of Abueir, Sahhhrah, and Dahshtr, Near the bank, to the
left, amidst a flue grove of palms, is a Ceptic convent, and adjacent
is a gun-faetory, begun by Iema‘il Pasha, but never f1niishtyi1,

The steamer remains for some hours at Bedrashén (rail. stat",
p. 1), where asses are kept ready for a visit to Memphis, Salrtihah,

bank of the Nile, lies 1.Telwtm (ibid, p. 404), frequented as a water-
ing-plaee. --- On the bank at Kafr el-Ugtt (W. bank; rail. stat),
where the steamer lags to for the night, are some ancient construc-
tions which may hatre belonged to the Canal of Mama. The un-
important pyramids of Lisht lie to the right, while the singularly
shaped pyramid of Madam (the so-celled 'False Pyramid’) becomes.

Rihlguh, on the W. bank, is the starting-point of the excursion
to the Pyramid and Magtabas of 11:18de (asses with poor saddles may
be procured at the village; 2 fr. and hakshish).

The Prmm AND Megan OE hfhothr, the oldest monuments in the
world, deserve a. visit, which if the traveller 1rpproae1yss by the river,may
be accomplished from the village of Eittah in about 6 hrs. (railway trav-
ellers may perform it in about the same time from the el-Waetah station;
comp. p. 1). Crossing the railway, we proeeeirum don1ceruek in about

The Pyramid of 1Eitdiim is so different from Kil the other structures of
the kind that it is called by the Arabs ‘El-Haram el-dreaded?'', 0r 'the taut
pyramid'. From a large heap of rubbish which covers its base, the
smooth and steep upper part of the structure rises in three different
stages at an angle of 'Mo 10', and is Mill preserved to B height of 122 ft.
The fhat section is 69 ft., and the second 201/2 ft., While the third, now
almost entirely destroyed, was once 32 ft. in height. The outer wan-rr,

holes in one of the surfaces were made by Lepsius and Erbkam when
they examined the pyramid, the eonstrueticm of which afforded them am
admirable clue to the principle upon which the others were built (Vol. L,
p. 350), The Pyramid of Mildiim was never completed; the heap of debris
at its base consists of the material which once filled the angles of the
different sections, so as to give the pyramid a smooth surface. The p0a-
mid was pillaged as early as in the time of the 20th Dynasty. It was
opened in 1881 by Haapem, who found a long corridor and a chamber
without sarcophagus. Perhaps in this pyramid krntt,t;,ttr,s,W, st _
