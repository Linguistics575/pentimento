of Old Kagér, corresponding to the harbour of Philotera, the ancient Aen-
uum, which was named thus in honour of the siater of Ptolemy Phila-
delphus. Kogér is now an unimportant town of about 8000 inhab., with
o. quay, a wooden mole 400 ft, long, two mosques, and several bazaars.
The small houses are all whitewashed. The only. tgrifltres of any size are
the government buildings erected by Mohammed un nt,tlt the mole,
the adjacent custom-house, and a. large grain-magazine, a so belonging to
the Egyptian government.

In going from gogér towards the Nile the Beduins sometimes prefer
another and more southerly route than that through the Wiidi IJanifui,
This diverge»; from the route above described at the Btr et-Inglis in the
dei Bédah (see above) and leads at firgt through the winding dei irabr

the more northerly one already described.

Caravans on the way from Kogér to Esneh take a. route still farther

is now seldom used.

The journey to Bcremfke, on the Arabian Gulf in 24° N,, lat, and to
the emerald mines W' to the N, of it, is seldom undertaken. We may
atert from Keneh or Koptos, diverging at Lahétah from the reute to Irotibr,
or we may b in at a. point opposite Edfn (Contra-Apollinopolis) or
Bedéeiyeh (p, J. On both routes traces of old watering stations are
discernible. Both Pliny and the Itinerary of Antonine (3rd cent. A.D.)
