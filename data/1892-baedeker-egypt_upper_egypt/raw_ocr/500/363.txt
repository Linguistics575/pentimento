with the concave cdmice and eetragal, exhibits an unusually ttms
inscription, carved in the grand style, of which a duplicate occurs
on the architrave of the E. eelonnede opposite. This Dedication-
Ineeri'ption records that Ptolemy IX. Euergetee IL .Physkon (with
numerous titles) and his wife Cleopatra, yrineese and mistress of
both worlds, the "Energetze (divine benefactors), loved the life-
giving Isis, the mistress of Abaton, the queen of the island of Philas

At the top of the left Colonnade, next the first pylon, are some
demotic and hieroglyphic Decrees, of the Qiet year of Ptolemy Epi-
phanes, one relating to the celebration of the suppression of a revolt
end the punishment of the rebels, the other in honour of Cleopatra,
wife of Epiphanes. These inscriptions, of great tmitmtitle value
though extremely lightly and almost illegibly carved, were discovered
by Lepsiue in 1843. Unfortunately they have been much injured
by figures carved over them under Neos Dionysus. An upper story
of Nile bricks, now in ruins, was built at some later period on the
roof of this periptera1 temple. It is entirely out of place and
should be removed.

f. The Building an the E. side of the Perixtyle (Pl. M), men-
tioned on p. 288, lies opposite the birth-houee, and presents a long
Colonnade of 10 columns , with elaborate capitals t towerds the
court. In the rtyarasa11 of this colonnade is first, to the left, a
large doorway, leading through a vestibule to the outside of the
temple, and then three lesser doors leading into three small eham-
bers, partly devoted to seientifie purposes. At the 8,, end, close to
the pylon, is a fifth door, admitting to a room now half in mine.
To the left of this room is another chamber (Pl. 1 ; see below), and
straight on is the Staircase (Pl. m) leading to the room on the
upper story, Some of the latter are tolerably spacious, but have no
inscriptions; whereas the lower story and the columns were adorned
with hitsrog1yph'ieis by Ptolemy XIII. Neoe Dionysus. The Inscrip-
tions in the various rooms are due to Tiberius, to whom Philae in
general is much indebted,
