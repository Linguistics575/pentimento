architecture of the new menarchy; and we here see, in place of the ca-
pital next the central passage the mask of the goddess Hathor, with her
cews’ ears and head-dress. 1The front of a. small portable temple with
handles, which rested on the head of the goddess, was placed on the ab:-
eua, and upon this rested the architreve. The mask of Hathor here ap-
pears only on one side of the capital; at Dér el-bahri it appears on two
sides. This artistic form was afterwards abandoned, but was again ro-
vived by Nekhtneb-f (Nectanebua 11.), a rival king to the Persians, be-
longing to the 30th Dym, who loved to compare himself to the expellers
of the Hyksos, and who therefore reverted to the art-forma introduced by
them. Finally under the Ptolemies this form was developed into a capital
in the fullest sense of the term. The masks are here united with the
plinthe by means of a vertical Ornamental Stripe, covering two of the
sides of the olygonel shafts and adorned with inscriptions. As each of
the sixteen sides or faces of the columns measures 5 inches in breadth,
the stripe is 10 inches in breadth. NMqMr- On the walls at the height of the
trrehitravetr, beneath the roof, appear other Hathor masks, alternating
with the names of the royal builders. Amenholep III. dedicated to his
father Tutmcs IV. the chapel of the goddess Hebent, who here appears he-
eide AmmomRe in place of Muth. Both hieroglyphics and pictures re-
tain the freshness of their colours. The former represent the making of
offerings. On the side with the door appear two lions, like door-keepers,
beside lueubrationg of later travellers in demotic characters.

Another Inscription in clear hieroglyphics must he mentioned here. It is

It was engraved , n the rock try a celehreted young French Egyptologist,
whose name we suppress.

At this chapel we turn, direct our steps towards the Nile, and in
1/4 hr, reach the ROCK TEMPLE, on the right side of the valley, re-
cognizable from a distance try the Stair leading up to it. The latter
consists of 41 steps hewn in the rock, with a massive balustrade
on each side. The temple was constructed under Ptolemy IX,
Euergetes II. (Physkon), and subsequently provided with new in-
seriptions by Ptolemy X, Soter II. The site was regarded as holy
even before the building Was erected, as we are informed by en in-
scription of the reign of Ramses YL, cut in the rock on the E. side
of the door leading Into the mountain.

. The Rook Chamber hes a vaulted ceiling covered with stucco, and,
bug the sanctuary of the temple, was constructed earlier than the IFre-
ceding chambers to which the stair leads. The letter form two parts.
On reaching the top of the stair, we pass through a doorway to a Ibre-
Court, not quite 33 ft. wide, the exterior sides of which were bounded by
low walls bum between columns. Two rows of columns in the centre led
to_the door of a smaller .Hau (only 19 ft, wide) of curious construction,
being heunded on the right and left by four low walls, of which emh
was built in between a. pillar and a. column. The door leading to the

roek-ehamber opened at the back of this hall. This sanctum alto WM
eapeeially dedicated to Hebent. y
