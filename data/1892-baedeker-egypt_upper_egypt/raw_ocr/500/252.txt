2htr el-Med‘z‘mh. THEBES. 17. Route, 189

Doorway of stone (on the S.E.), by which we have to pass, leads into
the temple, at the back of which (N) are steep rocks. The sanctu-
ary was founded by Ptolemy IV. Phi1opator 1., and sculptures were
added by others of the house of the Lagidas, and later also by the
Emperor Augustus. The traveller on passing through the doorway
in the outer wall sees on his left an archway of Nile bricks, and
before him the front of the temple of freestone, on which many
Greeks and Copts have written their names. In Christian times it
was used by the monks as ts'dwe11ing-p1ace, and to this is due the
mutilation of many of the inscriptions and also its present name
(Der C'g',t',= monastery). We first come to a small hypathral Antechamber
with ?columne, and a few steps farther reach the true Ptolemaic en-
trance of the Naos. This is ornamented by two pilasters with masks
of Hathor, and two columns with sculptured Calyx-capitals in the
middle, which support the architrave and are connected by walls ro-
sembling screens (reaching half-way up), Between the pillars is a
semi-portal similar to the one at Medamirt (p. 151). The pilasters are
brightly coloured and peculiarly ornamented, with a lotus flower and
a bud on slender stems at the side. Above are Uraeus-serpente with the
crowns ofbeth kingdoms. On the left side is an elegant window which
lights a staircase. The inner portion of the temple is in three parts.
Over the door of the middle room, the sanctuary, are placed 7Hathor~
masks corresponding to the number of the Hathore. Euergetes Ir,
and his wife are named as tMyaatifittrs of the temple, and the four
sacred bulls, Hepi, Urmerti, Temur, and Abekur, are portrayed. In
the cell to the right is the king before the various gods of the lower
world, and also an astronomical painting, Sothis (Sirius) and Orion.
In the room to the left, on the left wall, is a remarkable reprt3st3r1-
tation of the Judgment of the Dead.

The valley of Der el-Medineh is rich in Tombs efvarioue periods,
some of them early and of great interest, with the colours of the
paintings marveliously preserved,

Here was discovered the well-known collection of Papyri, obtained
by A. th Barrie in 1855, containing the famous papyrus of Ramses m, (see

p. 120), the largest knowu, from the archives of the temple of Media
net Haba,

The earliest tombs here belong to the beginning of the New Em-
pire and to the times of Aahmes I. and Amenhotep L They be-
longed to great officials, especially to the Sotem-as, supreme judge
at the Seat of Truth, possibly a college which met at Thir tsla-Mei1'i-,
neh. We may mention the smell brilliantly coloured chapel of the
royal scribe, Mesra, the similar one of Kha, the tombs of Ammmes,
Zesken, and Amenhotcp. In several tombs we find numerous frag-
ments of mummies, damaged and ransacked by the fellehin. Con-
tinuing farther into the valley we reach a tomb with a wide entrance
from which there is a tine view of Der eI-Medineh and of the fertile
plains to the E., traversed by the Nile and bounded by the distant
Arabian mountains. In the foreground are seen Medium ll Ih, the
