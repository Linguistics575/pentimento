mentioned ihrttres' have been supposed to be Castor and Pollux, er two
Roman emperors, but they rather resemble horses brought an tribute, like
the grnupa in the pediment of the Stele of Pinnkhi. Farther to the S.
is a. colossal image, carved out of the rack, of Ramses m, saerificing to
the god Sebek. The imstsriptions in the very ancient group of tombs tn
the B, are in Inch bad preservation that their date can only be guessed
at from their general style.

Hinyeh (yimet-ilm-Khws1b; rail. stat, p. ij, on the W. bank,
a well-built and handsome town with 15,900 inhab., is the seat of
the mudir of a district containing 281 villages and 310,000 inhatnu
tants, There is a telegraph-ofdee at the railway-station, and adja-
cent is the poist-ofiiee, the director of which speaks Italian. At the
hospital is a physician who has studied in Europe. The town pos- '
eessee two hotels and a large and curiously painted Arab cafe, in
which ghawiizi sing in the evening. Parts of the street running
along the river are planted with trees, and in the stream many
steamers and dhahabiyehs lie at anchor. The bazaars and the
Greek bakkale’ (small dealers) possess large stocks of goods. In the
Bazaar street is an Austrian watehmaker and elothier, and among
the houses on the river is an Italian tailor. The palace of the mudir
is a plain and lightly-built structure. The large sugar-factory is
the oldest in Egypt, and a visit to it during the sugar-harvest is of
great interest; most of the offle'ia1t, are French and very obliging,
Market-day in Minyeh presents a very gay and characteristic picture
of Oriental life. There are no public buildings or monuments of
any interest, but the houses of the richer merchant, in spite of their
plain exterior, are often fitted up with great comfort. A glance
into one of their courts will show what a rich and varied life exists
in the interior of houses which from the outside look like miser-
able huts.

It is uncertain what place of the Pharaohs’ time Miuyeh represents;
but the naaertion of Leo Africanus that it was founded by the Arabs may
well.be doubted. Among the facts which render it improbable are the
old masonry on the river (towards the so, the ancient architectural frag-
mentg immured in one of the mosques, h Comic inscription, and the very _
name of the town, which is derived , not from the Arabic, but from the
old-Egyptian dialect. Its Coptic name is noon“ (Moose) and this, as
Bmgach has demonstrated, is derived from the old-Egyptian Henwt. This
name, however (in full Menwt Rhufu, 'nurse of Cheops’), belonged to a
place which lay nearly opposite to the present Minyeh, on a site still
marked by a few remains. At a later date Mena-t was probably trans-
ferred, under the name ot'Minyeh, from the right bank of the Nile to the
left, where, presumably, some of the inhabitants had previously aettled.
To this day the inhabitants of Minyeh maintain a close connection with
the E, bank of the Nile, conveying their dead foe burial to Jirdun'yeh, sur-
named el-Métin (tle. 'of the dead'), 5M. to the S.
