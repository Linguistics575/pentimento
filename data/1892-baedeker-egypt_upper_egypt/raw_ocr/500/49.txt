the desert to the Convent: of ML Anthony and Paul, a few leagues
from the Red Sea. The brotherhood of St. Anthony's Convent oecu iea
the highest rank among the religious societies of the Monophyaite on-
feasion; and the Patriarch, or head of the Coptic. community, must be
aelected from their number. A visit to the eenvents, however, does not
_eomptsn8ate for the fatigue and trouble it involves.

As far as Minyeh the space between the E. bank and the hills
remains narrow, the limestone reeks frequently abutting on the river
in unbroken walls or rounded b1ztff's, Few villages are seen on this
bank, but the fertile alluvial tract on the W. side, 10-12M. in width,
is thickly populated and carefully cultivated, exhibiting in profusion
all the cereals that grow on the Nile, date-palms, and sugarwane.
The huge sugar plantations present a busy scene in November, when
the sweet juiee is collected from the canes and conveyed to the
factories, which are a monopoly of the Khedive and follow each other
in rapid succession. These factories are connected by the railway,
and short bramsh-limss, used in harvest-tima only, run from them
to the plantations lying farther to the W. Their lofty chimneys
impart a very modern-industrial appearance to the ancient land of
the Pharaohs. Large barges full of sugar-eanee and others with
fellahin going to work in the factories are met on the river. Most
of the higher offieials in the factories are Eumpeans. The juice is
expressed from the cane and then ref1msi1 by being boiled twice in
closed vessels. In an average year about 25,000 tons of sugar are
produced in Egypt; in 1889 the value of the sugar exported
amounted to 509,000£..

The boat passes two large islands. On the W. hank lie Balankah
and Btbeh (rail. stat, p. 1), with large sugar-faetories. The chan-
nel new contracts, and numerous islets are passed. chhn frail, stat,,
p. 1), on the W. bank, is 11/2 M. from the river. Near the village
of eGdh'lieli, on the E,, bank, about t M. farther up, are the ruins of
the town of Kheb or Khebi, which belonged to the nome of Aphro-
dite (p. F). These include we1Hraserveil riparian structures of the
time of the Pharaohs and some massive walls made of bricks,
hearing two irittarent stamps. One of these bears the name of the
local goddess, ‘Isis of Kheh’, and the praenomen of Tutmes m. (18th
Dye); the other, discovered by H. Brugsch in 1853, reads 'The
high-priest of Ammon, Pishem the just, governor of the towns of
Urkhenu and Igem-kheb',

0n the B. bank rises the Gcbcl tilhtklt Embdrak. The steamer
steps at Maghhghah, a pleasant place on the W. bank, with acacias,
palms, and large s11gar-works (post and telegraph ofdee at the rail,,
stat., p. 1). The Nile-channel is very Wide here (several islands ,
farther on both banks are flat. At Abu Girgeh (rail, stat, p. l
with tsugar-factories, the railway runs close to the river.

About 12 M. to the E. of Aha Girgeh, on the Baler Yasuf, in the name
