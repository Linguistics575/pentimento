Possibly the last portion of the name may refer to Osiris, whose grave
here attracted so many pilgrims, and Jirailfi1n (mast may be a translation
of the old name of the temple-quarter of Abydoe. In spite of the most
lavish expenditure of time, money, and labour, the excavators failed to
flnd either the spring mentioned by Stratus " the tomb of Osiris, and yet
the latter must tie close to the part of the ruins called Kan: es-Sulgdn,
near the holy hill of Abydos so often mentioned in the inscriptions.

WMA, applied to any large monument or memorial, whether architec-

tural or plastic, led the Greeks to describe every palatial structure of
the ancient Egyptians as a Mewvo'viov (Memnonion) or palace of HomoÂ».
Perhaps they ihst heard the name Mennu given to the colossal figures of
Amanhotep III. at Thebes (p. 153) and were attracted try its resemblance
in sound to the name of the son of Bots who fell before Troy; hence
they called the figures, afterwards so celebrated, statues of Memnon, and
saw Memnonia, er palaces of the same here, in some of the large memorial
buildings described as Mennu. The fact that the Hellenes did not apply
this name to all the great buildings of Egypt, but only to some of the
temples of W. Thebes and to the sanctuary of Seti at Abydos, may be
explained by the supposition that in the time of the Pharaohs these build-
ings monopolised the epithet of Henna, net as the fortress of the Core
queror in London is known as the ewer par excellence among the
numerous towers of that city. The temple of Seti became known as the
Memuonium or Palace of Memnon in the Alexandrina period, and a
natural consequence was the conversion of the name Abtu into the simi-
larly sounding Abydas or Abydus, the name of a town of Trees on the
Helleapont, not far from the burial- place of Memnen. By degrees the
Asiatic hero, son of Tithenus and Eos and ally of Priam (com . p, IM),
was converted into an Ethiopian, and the lively imagination oft e Greeks
transferred the Asiatic legends to Egypt and adapted them to Egyptian
conditions. Thus they related that Tithonus sent an Ethiopian army to aid
his son against Troy. These soldiers, however, heard of the death of
Memnon at Ahydos in Upper Egypt and retreeed their steps, after hang-
ing their garlands on the acaciae in the holy grove at the Memnenium.
Birds were fabled to have sprung from the ashes of Memnon, and reap
peered on certain days every year, removed all impurities from his grave,
dipped their wings in the Aesopos. which flow, into the Propontis at Cy-
zieua, and sprinkled the grave with the water. At a later date these birds
were said to come from Ethiopia. Finally it was asserted that the Egyp-
tian Abydos had been founded by colonists from its Asiatic namesake.

The Memnonium of Abydos is not an ordinary divine or religious
temple like those of Denderah, Karnak, and Edfu, but is rather one
of the series of sepulehrel sanctuaries of which mention is made at
p. 170 of Baedeker'e Lower Egypt. The numerous representations
and inscriptions that cover its walls are mostly of a very general
nature. They tell us, however, that the building they adorn was
primarily intended for funercal purposes. As already mentioned,
the bodies of numerous princes and grandees were brought here to
participate in the blessings that were supposed to emanate from the
sacred tomb of Osiris. The Pharaohs nowhere offered saerifiees to
the manee of their forefathers more gladly than at Abydes, and
prayers were pat up here to the Osiris-kings of the a ci t house
