came to pass that the instigator of the rebels in the outlying lands had
his secret retreat from the city of the throne of the gods to the place
' . ' . in the 3. (One of the chambers of the temple, viz. Pl, V, was
called ‘city of the throne of the gods', but the phrase is here used to
deserihe the town of Edfu.) That ended (nefr) in the year 79 in the reign
of the late King Ptolemy V. Epiphenes, after the king had suppressed the
revolution in the land; behold, his name is offieialiy placed in it' (the
tem 1e).

I:I‘he inscription continues: 'In the 5th year, 1/30 of the Shefthet (i.e.
on the lot of the month Tybi) of his beloved son, the late King Pto-
lemy VII. Phi1ometor, were erected the great wooden door in the Hell of
the Strong Victor (one of the names of the temple of Edfu), and the two
wings of the door of the Hui-hall (the name of Hell D, with the 12 c0-
lumns). Similarly what had been made in work in the interior of the
Chamber of Victory (Le. Room I, behind the adytum) in the 80th year
of this king was restored, The f1uiahing of the hieroglyphies, carved
with the graving tool, the decoration of the walls with a covering of
gold, the application bf the colours, the fhtishing of the top-ornament
of its wooden doors, the making of the door-stands of good brass, with
the metal hinges and locks, the fixing of gold plates on the wings of its
doors, the finishing of the interior of the temple-proper with perfect work
by the best artists of the time -- these operations lasted until the 28th
year on the 18th day of the month Mesori, under the late King Ptole»
my . Euer etes II. and his consort, the regent Cleopatra III. This makes
a. period of 5 years from the ceremony of the flrtst hammer-stroke to the
festal entry, the festival of the consecration of the ancestral abode by
His Majesty to his divine lord, Home of Edfu, god Ahi, the lord of
heaven, which is the great festival of Tekhu, and has been equalled by
nothing since the creation of the world to the present day'.

The dates iven above as to the progress of the work are as follows t -
L flat T hi, th year of Ptol. VII. Philom. C',2,T. 3rd Feb. 176 BAh
2. The th year of the same king == 152-151 13.0.

Finally from the foundation-festival on 23rd Aug. 7 13.0. to the
feetel entry on 10th Sept. 142 BA), is a period of 95 years.

The inscription next devotes some space to the description of the
festival of the solemn entry of the god, and then goes, on: In this beau-
tiful 30th year, month Peyni, 9th day, festival of the union of the meow
god Osiris with the snn-god Ra, again the festival of a 6th of Payni, the
foundation was laid of the Khan! Hall (PL. E, the i8-eo1mnned hyfoisty1e),
which has two side-ehapels within it (referring probably to the smell
chambers to the right and left of the portal, in the front wall), and the
roof of the sun-god who commands in heaven was completed in the
46th year, month Meseri, 18th day (ix, Sept. 6, 122 13.0.), which it 16 years,
2 months, 10 days from the foundation of the hall of the sun-mountain
(another name for Hall E), which was laid on the 9th Payni in the
30th year of Ptolemy IX,, (M. July 2, 140 B.C.). Thus from the founding
of the hall to the completion of the roof there elapsed, es the inscription
correctly states, a epeee of 17 years, 2 months, 10 days, reckoning to the
dedicatory festival of the noble Khent hall, which took place on the day
of the Tekhu festival.

Fifteen definite dates are given in this important inscription detailing
the history of the temple of Edfu beginning with the foundationweere-
many on the 7th Epiphi in the iotii year of Ptolemy 111. (23rd Aug,
237 Bio, and ending with the year of Ptolemy X. Soter 1183 second
assumption of the government, viz. the 236th year of the Lagidee Ta',' 89-88
33.0. To these we may add a sixteenth, dating the fitsa1 cumpletion of
the huge building. From an inscription given thrice inside the portal of
the pylons and the colonnede of the fore-court, we learn that the two
hreae-mounted win 3 of the door of the great ylons were erected on the
Igt Kheiak in the 55th year of Ptolemy XIII. gees Dionysus, and of his
sitter and wife Cleopatra Trypheena, m. on December 5th, 57 Bi. Thus
