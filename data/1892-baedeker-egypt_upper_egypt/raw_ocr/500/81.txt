stele of Piankhi. The whole province was at tirgt called the leke-land,
then the district of C)roeodi1opolis, and lastly the Arainoite Nome. The
deity most highly revered here was the (sroeodilirheaded Sebek, the rep-
tile sacred to whom was carefully tended in Lake Moerie. At the same
time the voracious and dangerous monster, notwithstanding the reverence
paid to it on account of its connection with the inundation, was also
regarded as Typhonie, and the Croeoiri1oporiUn nome was thtsretbre
passed over in the lists of nomes. -- At the period preceding that of the
Psamtikides of the 26th Dynasty the Labyrinth appears to have been used
as B hell for great imperial assemblies. At the period of the Ptolemies
and the Romans the products of the 1iuyilm were much extolled. 'The
Areineite Nome', says Strabo, ‘is the most remarkable of all, both on ecu
count of its scenery and its fertility and cultivation. For it alone is
planted with large, full-grown, and richly productive olive-trear, and the
oil is good when careful] prepared; those who are negleetful may in-
deed obtain oil in ehun ance, but it has a bad smell. 1n the rest of
Egypt the olive-tree is never seen, except In the gardens of Alexandria,
where under favourable circumstances they yield olives, but no oil. Vines,
corn, padded plants, and many other products also thrive in this district
in no smell abundenee‘. -. Strabo‘s description is still applicable at the
present day, The oranges and mandarins, peaches, olives, iiga, cactus
fruit, omegrantstes, and grapes grown here are much esteemed, and the
beauti ul, rieh-eoloured red roses of the gardens of the 1?aytim, which
were once so lavishly strewn at the banquets of Cleopatra, still thrive
here. At the station of Medinet tsl-Nita" small phials of utter of roses,
of inferior quality, are frequently offered for sale. Isma‘il Pasha devoted
special attention to this favoured part of his dominions. The fields, which
are watered by means of wheels of peculiar construction, yield rice, sugar,
cotton, tltrx, and hemp, besides the usual cereals. The beginning of No-
vember is probably the season at which the traveller will obtain the most
distinct idea of the fertile character of the district. - The Inhabitants

The Irramyh-h'ne to the 1i'ayflrn runs towards the W., across
cultivated land, to the village of Abu Rddi, beyond which it tra-
verses a desert tract for 35 mim, and then crosses the low and
bleak Libyan chain of hills, reaching its highest point at a level of
190 ft. above the see. We then descend, cross the Bohr elm Warddn,
which flowiy towards the Bah: Ytssuf from the N., and then the water-

left is a cemetery with the dilapidated tombs of several shékhs.
Numerous peIm-branches are placed by the tombstones as tokens of
affection. On the right stretches an-aucient dyke, which once may
have belonged to the embankment of Lake Moerie (p. 40). We
