that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the

EthiOpians. And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and

came to Jerusalem‘. Verse 9 is the same as the above passage

(C''"""?) from Kings. -- The conquered people named in the represen-

tation are the Ame, Kenue (Nubiene), Menti, and Sekti (Asiatiee).

Champollion, the great deeipherer of 1tierogiyph'hstr, was the

first to perceive that the names in the inscription belonged to

the above-mentioned “fenced eitiee‘, and that Sheshenk, called

by the Greeks Seeenchie, was identical with the Shiehek of the

Bible. The third name in the third row from the top, attracted

his attention especially; it reade 'Judah (Jude) Malek‘, and may

cf}: be translated king of Judah. The heads of the busts above the

name-labels, with their characteristic Semitic features, ere auf-

m fieient by themselves to prove that only places could be here

a the 120 name-lahele only a few can be identified with certainty

with otherwise known names of places in Palestine, such as

.% Rabbath (last ring of the first row), Tamach, Shunem, Rehob,

(:36 ITaphararm, Adullam, Mahanarm, Gibeon, Btrih-Boron, Kedeu

iStChdl moth, Ajalon (in the second row). Several symbols have re-

cently been obliterated by the whitewash used to preserve the

E 1 wall, and some of the name-labels have also been destroyed,

as e.g. Megiddo at the beginning of the third row. The rest of

the inscriptions, which are couched in the usual emphatic style, give no
farther information as to the campaign.

We return to the psrigtyle eourt and eroceed to the Become. Pylon
(Pl. II). The left or N, side has fallen and the right side is sadly
damaged. The eelossi of Ramses w, Which guarded the projecting
entrance, have already been mentionea on p. 119, But neither
Ramses IL, as appearances might suggest, nor even his father Seti T,
built this pylon, but the predeeeseor and father of the latter,
Ramses 1., who also planned the hypeetyle hall, afterwards adorned
by Seti L and Ramses the Great. The cartouehes of Ramses II.
frequently occur sunk instead of being embossed, because they have
been placed on spots previously occupied by the older cartouches
of Ramses I. or Seti I. The same is the case on the back of the
N, pylon, whereas on the back of the S. pylon, which was erected
by Ramses IL, his name appears in genuine bae-relief. In the
doorway (P1. o), where the eartouehee of Ramses 1., Seti 1., and
Ramses II. are found, an intervening door was erectedhy Ptolemy WI.

 

 

Philemetor (e, EB and Ptolemy IX. Euergetes IL, during

=

their joint-reign (170-165 B.C.). The lintel and upper parts of
this latter doorway are wanting, but the jambs are in good pre-
servation, with expressions of homage to Ammon and his feliewa
gods. 0n the inner side (to the left) of the earlier doorway appears
Ramses II. kneeling before Amman and receiving the symbol of
kingship. Behind him stands the goddess Math, and Khunsu, with
the moon's disc on his head, conducts Ptolemy WI. Philometor to
behold the god Ammon. Probably the representation is a restoration
by Philometor of an older work on the same spot.
