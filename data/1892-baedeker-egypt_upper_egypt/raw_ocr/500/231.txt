second row begins with kneeling chiefs from the Bildto, who are
followed by white-clad Ethiopians with rings of gold , panther-tskins,
a giraffe, and oxen. The last have unusually variegated hides, and
each has a brown and a black human hand most singularly flared on
the points of its horns, The inscription above this procession runs:
'the great ones of Kush (Ethiopia) speak, Hail to thee, king of
Egypt, sun of the foreign peoples. We shall breathe as thou pera
mittest and shall live according to thy pleasureâ€™. In the third row
brown and black chiefs from Kush bring gold and precious stones,
and semicircular fans of ostrieh-feathers, of exactly the same shape
as the fiabellum which now shades the pope on certain "solemn
occasions and which was formerly used by the Pharaohs, Att ox
with artificially bent horns, between which is a pond with Nh
and bushes, should be noticed. The fourth and fifth divisions are
much injured. They show bright red persons (1ilrsthrayams who
dwelt between the Nile and the Red Sea), Egyptians, and very light
coloured Egyptian women with nosegeys, earthen vessels, gazelles,
etc. Hui appears again on the same wall. Above and beneath may
be seen the ships which brought to Egypt the choice tribute of the
south. The two richly adorned and brightly painted dhahahiyehs
(above) resemble the craft (the ornamentation of course excepted)
in which the products of the Miltn are to this day transported to
the north. Five Ethiopian princes kneel upon the deck of the aewnd
boat. Cattle and other goods are being brought to Egypt in the
smaller vessels below,

on wall c appears the deceased, with the J''aekabheadtsil Anubis
on his right and Osiris on his left, while between him and the gods
are offerings to the dead. 0n wall a, near the door, stands the
deceased, with his domestics, singers, etc., and two richly adorned
Nile boats behind him; still farther back is the prince of Kueh again,
surrounded by his treasures 'tmtw- earthen vessels, skins of wild animals,
bright coloured boxes, etc. Rings of gold are being received and
are weighed try a treasurer named Hornefer.

On the rear wall to the right (a) appears the king (near the
corner pillar), with Hui before him. q-mth Amenhotep, another prince
of Rash, is bringing pieces of Iapisr-1azuri on a dish. By his right
hand hangs a breast-plate, set with precious stones, like that were
by the high priest of the Jews. Behind Hui are several of those
gold and silver vessels, which at that time were manufactured by
the Phenieians and Syrians with extraordinary artistic skill,, Here
also are 1apisr-lazuli, red cornelians, and priestly tweast-plates. An
inscription extols the Pharaoh in emphatic terms and informs us that
Syria pays this tribute. Their appearance alone is quite smmeient to
enable us to decide with certainty as to the origin of the men here Yes'
presented, casting themselves in the dust before the king, or standing
and offering him homage and tribute. Some of them are light-
eoloured, others of a reddish hue; their profile ' unmistakably
