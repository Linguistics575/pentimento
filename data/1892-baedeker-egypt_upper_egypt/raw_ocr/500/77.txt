From very early times Assitkt was considered the northernmost point
of the Thebaid.

The steamers and dhehabiyehs are met at et-Hamrah by donkey
boys with well-saddled donkeys and by sellers of pottery, which
can nowhere in Egypt be obtained better then here. The fine pottery
of Aisis'itlt, especially its bottles and piptr-trowhs, is justly oelehmteei
emi forms an important artide in its export trade, which also deals,
in linen, embroidered leather goods, ostrich feathers and other pro-
duets of the Stsdtm, matron, soda, and corn. It has, however, lost
part of its commercial importance since the great caravans from W.
Africa have frequented other routes and places. Large trains of
camels still come from Dirftir and KordoGn, generally encamping
at Beni 'Adin (p. 29), 19 M. to the NW. of Assitt, The vicinity
of Assiilt is one of the hest-cultivated districts in the valley of the
Nile, the fertile strip between the Libyan and Arabian Mts. here
attaining a width of 12 M. The province of Assitt, the mudir of
which resides here, contains 234 villages with 583,596inhaty, (incl.
the eases of Rhdrgeh and mad). Near the harbour are several large
palm-gardens, in which also grow pomegranate, fig, and other fruit-
trees. These gardens are let at enormous prices and produce rich
harvests of fruit.

Those who have 2i/sr3 hrs. to share should not omit to ride
through the town and to the tombs on the slopes of the Libyan
limestone hills, not only for the sake of the antiquities, but to see
the busy Oriental life in the bazaars. and to enjoy the view from the
graves. Candles and matches must not be forgotten. To visit Assitt
from the dhahabiyeh and to ride through it takes about i hr. The
town lies about 3/4 M. from the river and is reached from the har-
hour by an embanked road shaded with beautiful trees. Outside
the town lie the long government buildings. The streets are full
of busy life, eSpeoially on Sundays, when the people of the neigh-
bourhood floek into the market. Oriental wares are cheaper in the
bazaars of Assiilt than at Cairo, but European goods are dearer. The
better houses are of burned brick, the meaner of tsun-dried Nile
bricks. The facades on the street are generally unimposing, but a
glance into one of the eeurte of the bigger houses will show that
the wealthy merchants of Aissitg,t, are not indifferent to comfort and
display. The main street interseoting the town from E. to w, is
nearly 3 M, long.

Xecropolis of Ancient Lycopolia. To reach this from the her-
bour we require at least 12 hr. Riding through part of the town,
we diverge from the main street at the point where it bends to the
right and proceed to the left, through the cultivated land and across
a handsome bridge, to the foot of the Libyan hills. The dark
openings of the tombs and caves are eonsspieuous at a distance in
the abrupt sides of the mountain, below which 1iyi,,the new Arab
