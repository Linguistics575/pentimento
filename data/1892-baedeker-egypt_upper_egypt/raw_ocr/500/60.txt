the son of the Lady Hanna, who was one of the chief dignitaries
of the kingdom, bore the title of an erpa ha or prince, governed
the nome of Mah in time of peace, and commanded a division of
the ormy in war. To the left and right of the entrance he is depict-
ed on a throne with lioni feet, holding his eommat1i1er'g baton in
his hand. Inside the door are two well-preserved irustsriptions,
out in the stone. That to the right (8.) informs us that Amenemha
departed this life in the 43rd year of Ueertesen L, corresponding
to the 25th year of the govemorshtp of Ameni. He undertook all
his wars ‘soiling ap-stream':--". he campaigned only against
the dwellers of the S., the ‘miaerahle Kuahitee', as they are called
in the inscription. In those days the arms of the Pharaohs had not
get been carried towards the E, The Sinai peninsula, with its
mines, is the only district in this direction which excited the Egyp-
tion lust of conquest. From his southern campaigns Amenemha
brought home much gold and other booty. The inscription to the
left (NO also mentions a victorious campaign towards the S., but
is of special interest for the light it throws on the truly human
feelings of this hyengone time. Amenemha describes his occupam
tions in time of peace as follows (beginning at the fourth line from
below): 'I cultivated the entire name of Mah with many work-
people. I troubled no child and oppressed no widow, neither did
I keep a flghtmmm from his t1sshing or a herdsman hom his herd.
There was no head of a village whose people I had taken away for
compulsory labour, and there "was no one unhappy in my days or
hungry in my timeew When, however, a famine arose, I tilled all
the fity1dty in the name of Mah, from its & to its N. boundary, and
gave nourishment and life to its inhabitants. So there was no one
in the nome who died of hunger, To the widow I allowed as much
as to the wife of 9. man, and in all that I did I never preferred the
great man to the small one. When the Nile rose again and every-
thing flourished 'h'm'm'mrm' flts1dss, trees, and all else —-— I cut " nothing
from the f1elds',

The paintings in the interior of the tomh-ohamher proper are
unfortunately very much faded , and they have also been eon-
siderahly Injured, eSpeoially in recent years. Some tlgares of war»
riors which still remain, armed with club and axe or club and lance,
have a foreign appearance, as their skin is of a lighter colour than
that of the Egyptians, and their hair and beards are red.

Tomb No, 2 is that of Khnumhotep, the son of Nehera. It owes
its origin to a member of a family of high rank, in which the offlee
of governor of Mah seems to have been hereditary for several ge-
nerations. Amenemha 1., Usertesen L, and Amenemha IL, the first
kings of the 12th Dyn., showered titles and digTtities with a free
hand on this family, which in return clung to the royal line with
peculiar loyalty and affection By a wonderful piece of good fortune
