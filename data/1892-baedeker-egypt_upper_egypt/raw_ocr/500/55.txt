10 Route 1. KGM EL~AHMAR. Frm Cairo

Opposite Minyeh, on the E. bank, lies Rihn el-Kafamh, where
some ancient tombs, perhaps belonging to the 12th or 13th Dy-
nasty, have 1ate1rtreen discovered.

Zhwiyet el-Métin and Kim el-Ahmar( 'the red rubbieh-mound’),
situated on the E, bank, 5-6 M. above Minyeh, may be visited to-
gether. We first reach the village of Ziluriyeli, near which are the
estate and beautiful garden of the venerable Abu Sultan Pasha,
Between the village and Kihn el-Ahmar, about 1/2 M, from the
latter, lies the fine cemetery of the citizens of Minyeh (p, 9), with
its numerous domed tombs and chapels. Thrice yearly, in the
months of Regeh, Shawwél, and Dhiihiggeht, at the time of full
moon, funereal festivals, lasting several days, are celebrated here.
Among the ceremonies observed are the offering of dates to the
dead, which recalls the funereal offerings of the ancient Egyptians,
and the presentation of palm-branches, recalling the Oriental sym-
bolism of early Christianity, still familiar in our churches. A few
minutes' walk towards the S. brings us to the red mound ofpottery
and rubbish known as K6172. el-Alimar, Which runs parallel with the
Nile. Climbing ever this we reach the buriabvaulte of the primeval
monarchy, Which are situated among the Arabian hills, with their
gates towards the river.

The tombs are unfortunately in bad preservation, and some of them
have been destroyed by violence, the stones being removed for use in build-
ing. It is uncertain of what town this was the mstsropoiia, but it undoubb,
edly belonged to the 16th nome of Upper Egy t, named Mai} or lake:
(gazelle), in which the gazelle'wen held sacred. Th this nome also lay the
towns of Heben and Nefrus, the chief deity of which was represented as
a. tSparrow-hawk standing on e gazelle, aecOmpanied by Hether, Horns,
and Khnum. Some of the tombs are still open to visitors. The lower
ones are small and dilapidated, including one that was richly adorned
with statues. Similar figures, hewn in the living rock, are still distinguish-
able on the fagede and in the rear of the chapel. Farther up is the tomb
of Neferselclwu, royal secretary and superintendent of the etorehousea of
Upper and Lower Egypt, which still eonteine some good sculptures. This
tomb, in the rear of which are three niches, appears to have been eon~
atructed under the 18th Dynasty. Among its contents are tsaerifiaits1 lists
and acenes like those in the vaults of 'Ahd tsHSaretah: Oeiris under a tNV
nopy; corpse crossing the Nile, accompanied by female mourners; the
deceased in the midst of his family. The tomb of Khunes, a relative of
the Pharaohs, situated farther to the S. and lower down, is of earlier origin
and in all probability belongs to the ancient kingdom. The scenes of
agriculture and navigation in this tomb, reprodueed by Lepaiua, are now
scarcely visible. From the upper tombs we obtain a splendidly varied
view of the Nile, its fertile valley and the town of Minyeh, with the red
mounds of debris in the foreground, while to the N. etretehea the sandy
desert, from which the domed tombs of 2liiwiytst ts1-ltfitttn rise like a group
of tents, 0n the mound of Kan el-Ahmar lies a colossal ilgure, 70 ft.
long, without an inscription.
