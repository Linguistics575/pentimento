Hebent. On the tmek-wall, to our left as we enter, King Horus is depicted
returning in triumph from his campaign in Ethiopia.

This *Reh'ef, of great artistic value, shows the Pharaoh seated on
his throne which is borne by 12 nobles adorned with feathers, The throne
has lions' feet and its back also consists of lions. The king wears the
war-helmet and carries the staff of empire in his left hand. Behind
and before him are eouri-off1ciais, warding off the sun‘s rays with the
long-handled iiabauam,, The Kherheb precedes the litter, offering incense,
and B train of captured Ethiopians is led along by the victor. Vanquished
blacks are lying on the ground and others are being rapidly marched off
by Egyptian soldiers. Above the captives are the words: 'Leading of the
captives of the miserable Kueh by.Horue, Icing of Upper and Lower
Egypt, ate, His majesty came out of the land of Kush (Ethiopia) with
the booty Which his sword had made, as his father Amman had com-
manded him'. Before the priests, who stand in a reverential attitude, is
written: 'The good god approaches, he celebrates his victory over the great
ones of all lands. When he grasps the bow in his right hand he is like
the lord of Thebes (Le. Month, the god of war), as king of the strength
of heroes. Above the prisoners is the inscription: ‘Hail to thee, king of
Egypt, sun of the barbarians! Thy name is extolled in the land of the
Ethiopians. Thy battle-ery resounds over their seats. Thy heroic strength,
o then perfect prince, converts the alien lands into tombs. Pharaoh, long
life and health, o my eun-god’ (She).

Farther to the right and also on the backwwall is a recess with King
Sipteh Khuenra before Amman, with BM, an off1eial (overseer of the
whole lend). Next is a State of Panehesl, of the second year of Meren-
pteh I. and his consert Aetnefert; then a. stele of the time of Ramses 1.,
and upon it the iUrtst tablet of the Festival instituted by the king’s eon
Khaemus in honour of his father Ramses II. The fuzt tablet dates from
the 30th year, the second from the 34th, the third from the 37th, and the
fourth from the 40th.

Beside the pillar is the small Sanctuary of Ramses II. To the left of
the entrance is King Horus (who built the sanctuary), before Harmachie
and the goddess Jusae, end the same king before Ammon-Ra and Muth.
At the heck of the very dark recess is a god, with three forms on each
side. Numerous figures of gods. To the right of the entrance to the
sanctuary is a reproduction of the Festival Stele mentioned above. Ad-
joining is the stele of the high-priest Moi, who instituted a festival in
the third year of Merenpteh I. Farther on is another Festival Stale, with
Ramses 11. before Hermachis and Math, Ptah, and Sehek. The date is
the same as on the preceding, but the marshal of the festival is here the
Erpe Ha (prince) and mayor Bhat. The same oftieiai appears also in the
same etele of the 46th year of Ramses ll, as marshal of the 6th festival
in the whole land (Kheemue had probably died in the interval).

The numerous reliefs above and below the five doors and in the re-
cesses outside should also be noticed. Over the central door: King Horus,
here called the beloved of Ammon and Muth,~ of Khnum, of Abu, and of
Auk, mistress of Sati (Asia). Over the second door (from the left):
Ramses III. with the commander of his cavalry. Between the fourth and
fUth this king presents Me to Anhur. Last relief on the right: Ramses II.

door is the Small chapel of Pa war t in whithRamsee n,

appears with his eoneort Aetnefert and a princess (Bainut aunt) before
Ptah and Nefertum. There is also a small fhrarts of Khaemue. On the
inside of the front wall is a Hieratic Inscription of the tith year of Ram-
eee m, containing a command to Setemheb, overseer of the palace, to
build in the house of eternity in the W. of Thebes (5.9. the tomb of
Ramses III. in Btbiin el-Muluk. The number of workmen under him
(W3), ships (40), and boats (d) are detailed. Two other hieratie Imorip»
