station also there is a block of granite with the name efTutmes111.,
possibly dating from a temple at Syene, on which Khnum, lord of chu

Its (ii, l) k 3, within Abu (Elephantine) is named. Several

attractive houses, one belonging to a wealthy Jaw, form a kind of
suburb here,

To the left of the road lies the small TEMPLE, founded by Pto-
lemy III. Euergetes and adorned by Ptolemy IV. Philopator, but
never entirely completed. On the left of the Facade is Euergetes L
and his wife Berenice IL, before Isis in Sun (Syene). Isis is named
eonduetress of the soldiers, because the frontier-town and its neigh-
bourhood were strongly garrisened from very early times as well as
under the Romans, (Under the Romans the Cehors Quinta Suenen-
sium was stationed at Contra Syme, the Cohors Sexta Saginarum in
the Castra Lapidariorum, on the E, bank to the S. of Syene, the
Cohors Prima Felix Theodosiana on Elephantine, and the Legie
Prima Maximiana on Philm) Next appears Ptulmis, son of Eugr-
getes, otherwise Philopator, before Khnum, Sati, and Anuke, who
each wears his special head~drees. On the right side of the faeede is
Euergetes 1., before Sehek and Hethor, and offering incense before
Osiris Unnofer (the good), Isis, and the child Horus.

On the inner sides of the two doors leading to the antechamher
with its two square columns, and on the inner side of the door to
the adytum, are inscribed stirring Hymns to Iiis-tlothi8, to whom
apparently the little temple was dedicated. To the left, on the lat-
ter door, are 6.9. the words: 'Thou hurlest forth (sati) the Nile,
that he may fertilize the land in thy name of Sothis, thou em-
bracest (ank) the i1ts1ihs, to make them fertile in thy name of Ankht,
A11 beings on earth exist through thee, through thy name of Ankht
('the living)

Unusually thick pillars in the tlrst and largest chamber of the
temple support flat Week abaci, upon which rests a broad but flat
architrave. Completed inscriptions are to be found only on the
partition-wall between the sanctuary and the preceding hall, on the
entrance door, and at a few points on the inner walls.

Near the templeâ€˜is a roek-inseription of the time of Khu-en-aten,, To
the left appears the sculptor Man, before a sitting figure of Amenhotep III.
perhaps carved by himself, to the right is a son of Men named Bet, mak-

ing an offering. Bek is also a mturter-sn1lptor of the sun, whose beams
radiate in the form of hands. The cartouchee of Khu-en-aten are defaced.

2. THE ARAB CEMETERIES.

A brief ride brings us to an immense number of Arab graves,
lying in the midst of the desert, each marked by a rectangle of
unhewn stones, and a slab bearing an engraved inscription. Many
are covered with a pall of yellow sand, The earliest of the hundreds
of Epitaphs exhibit the venerable Cufle character and, date mostly
from the 9th and 10th cent, AND A few are 1rl,,,,4riistr, "
