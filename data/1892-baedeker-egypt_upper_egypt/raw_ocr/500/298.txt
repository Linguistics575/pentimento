ably the sanctuary founded by that prince still lies beneath the
houses of the town. The hypoetyle, however, must have been mined
and rebuilt under the Ptolemies, for the adornment of the hell he»

'and completed by their successors. The inscriptions on the rear-
wall were begun by Ptolemy VII. Philormstor. The Dedication In-
scription above the entrance celebrates the 'autoersts', Tiberius,
Claudius, Germanicus, and Vespesian as the builders, while a share
in the decoration of the interior was taken not only by these prim"
ces, but also by Titus, Domitian, Nerve, Trajan, Hadrian, Anto-
ninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius , Commodus , Septimius Severus,
Caraealla, Greta, Julius Philippus, andDeeius (249-251). The name

Athena and the tish Latus were worshipped here in Latopolis; and
