G7 heb, before Ptah, befere a ram's-hmuled deity (Mar nut-f,
loving his mother), lord of Ehiiit, and before Apt, Beneath are
three large warlike scenes. The first represents the king in his
chariot at the storm of a fortress. The horses with handsome harness
are gelleping, while the king launches an arrow against the fortress.
Above him is the guardian vulture, and behind him are his three
sons Amenlukliopeshf, Ramses, and Rahiuanemif, with their shield-
bearers in chariots. The defenders of the Weil-drawn fortress are
pierced by arrows; one is falling from the walls, A herdsman takes
to flight with his herd.

Beside the king‘e horses are the words, referring to the king: 'The
good god, son of Ammon, the advancing lord of the sword, protector of
his soldiers, shield of the fighters, bravely knowing the place of his hand,
firm in his war-ehariot like the lord of Thebes, a lord of victory he alaye
hundreds of thousands, one bull against numberlees (foes), he sweeps
away the eonfederates, he defeats the rebels on the summit of their
mountains, he penetrates into their valleys like the grasshoppers. Thou
eauseat them to be eat " in their dwellings. Thou destroyest their seed
with the royal sickle‘.

A second picture exhibits the king on foot, treading upon a
prostrate enemy, and piercing a Syrian with a lance so that his
blood gushes forth. The king is represented as a young man ot
vigorous frame, probably as at the beginning of his warlike career.

The inscription runs: 'The good god who breaks in pieces the nine
tribes of the bow, who exterminate, the lands of the N., e streng hero
against the nations, with a brave sword like Mentu. He leads the land
of the negroes to the N, land, the Ama to the land of Khent (Nubia). He
transplants, the people of the Sheen to the land of . . " he places the land
of Tehen at the mountain-ridge. He fillg with his victories the temples
that he has built with the booty which he won when he overthrew the
{2.114% SP", and annihilated the land of Retennu, thrown down upon
T 5 )ac .

The third picture exhibits the triumphal return of the king
from battle. His chariot is preceded by two rows of fettered cap-
tives ...... black and brown people from the & (o, Nubians and Sib-
dtmuss) -- clad in skins and wearing caps of straw or reeds. The
king follows calmly in his chariot; his horse, named Nekhtu em was
(Victorious in Thebes), paces proudly along; and beneath the horse
is the king's lion, which accompanied him in battle,

The inscription is as follows: 'The living and good god, who tamee
the rebellious, smites the land of the 8., and annihilates the land of the
N, A brave king with his sword he drives far back those who have
eroseed his borders. His majesty comes to (distant) lands, he places many
in terror'. Farther on we read 'He elays their chiefs, he causes the ne-
groes of Wawa to say 'he is like a flame in its uprising, he (spares) not
the Retennu'.

A large picture on the opposite (N. wall) deals with the warlike
events connected with the storming of the fortress of Katcsh, on the
Orontes (Aranute), with which we have already become acquainted
in the Rameeseum (p. 161), and at Luxor, Karnak, and Abydoe.

In the upper half of the picture the besieged furtreae is depicted, with
the king, bending his bow, attacking it on the left. The E yptian chariots

army of the Kheta (Hittites) and their allies, of which 0
