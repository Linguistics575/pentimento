228 Route 21. THEBES. West Bank:

has given its name to the place. To the left me the remains of
other rooms. The name of Ramses IL, inserted by himself as a
correction, should be noticed; behind ere oftsrings for the dead. The
flmy roof is not a true vault, the stones lying horizontally and being
cut out. The colours areafresh; to the right and left of the door
are Tutmes III. and Tutmes II. ; over the door 4 bulls. Mm- Ascend-
ing 34 steps further we reach another granite doorway also built
by Tutmes IIL, through which we enter avault sprinkled with stars.
This last rests against the wall of rock which rises above Der el-
bahri, without being cut into it. A second archway with 2 side-
niches leads deeper into the mountain, and there is a third unvaulted
room which was constructed under Tutmes I. of the 18th Dynasty,
but appropriated by a distinguished otNial named Amenhotep,
under Ptolemy Euergetes IL, and his wife Cleopatra. The inscrip-
tions of this later period compare very disedventageously with
those of the time of the Tutmes kings.

From the N. side of the third terrace 'it is possible to cree into the
Burial Chapel, half filled with rubbish, which is supported by 1 eighteen-
aided columns in four rows, and contains two empty sarcophagua-chestee
On the inner wall are Anubis end offerings for the dead. This is followed
by a vaulted Chamber the arch of which is pointed, and from this a simi-
larly vaulted Passage runs " at a right angle to the W. of Which is a.
very small Room, also vaulted in the same way. Wi,' thus find three vaulted
rooms, each smaller than the preceding. In front of this arrangement of
tombs there was a building of which there now remains (on the right
as we leave the tombs) a Colonnade with 7 eighteen-eided columns, hear-
ing an arehitrave, the astragal, and the concave cornice. These rooms are
much choked up, and full of fragments of mummies, and linen rags. In
later times they were used aa a common burial ground. The same fate
from the 26th Dyn. onwards befel the rooms at the end of Which is the
tine picture of the Hether- Cow (p. 227); but these are now kept clean and
easily accessible.

On the fourth terrace also pictures of a procession have been pre-
served. Of the row of ships nothing is” left but the water-lines below them,
but it is from here that a picture of a ship now in the Berlin Inseam
was taken, with an accompanying inscription telling us that the Promn‘an
was arranged by Tutmes m, in honour of Tutmes IL

At no great distance from Deir elobahri there is a roughly worked
passe 6 cut, only about 3ft. high and scarcely accessible, which was ex-
plore by Eben. It leads: into a aepulchral chamber, entirely mvered
with semi-hieratie inscriptions, in which was buried a. princess named
Nefru, a favourite, and perhaps the mother of a princess Hetaau belonging
to the early period of the New Empire or, according to Neville, to the
11th or 12th Dynasty,

This neighbourhood should not he quitted without a visit to the shaft
from which the famous royal mummies were obtained. In order to reach
it we walk over the heaps of sand to the right at the foot of Dtr el-hehri
(or we may take an easier path from the village and tombs of Shékh
rAbd elwlflurnah down the slope to the west). In scarcely 10 min. we are
in front of a narrow chasm in the rock, up which there is a atee climb
for 5miuutes. Above is the Shaft, Git. square, descending perpen cularly
for 38 ft. A strong rope and great caution are necessary in order to be
let down. At the bottom is an entrance 5 ft. wide and 3 ft. high which
leads in a. straight direction for '24 ft. This passage then turns to the right
in a ICE. direction for the length of more than 195 ft., its height Parr-
Ing from 6 to 13 ft. To the right time or six rude steps lead to a niche.
