Roman general Petrenius defeated the Ethiepians at Peelehis in
23 A.D., on his campaign to Nepate (p. 302). Dakkeh early he-
came the site of a temple; Prof. Eisenlohr found a stone here with
the name of Amenemha (now at Heidelberg). In the embankment
leading to the N. from the pylon, tn the axis of the present temple,
stones of earlier buildings have been used, several with the ear-

Gau’s theory that there was formerly another tydifiee to the right,
almost as large as the present one to the left, seems insuff1etent1y

temple was built by the native king Ergamenes (the inner temple

and Dakkeh. It is somewhat improbable that this same Ergamenes

A at Dakkeh. On the other side, there are proofs that the chamber

even under Ptolemy Philopator and Euergetes II.

The present Temple Buildings of Dakkeh embrace the massive
pylons and the temple proper, lying 40 ft. behind them, both fee-
