whose name also occurs with Aahmes', Binpu, and a king Suezen
on the pedestal of a statuette of Harpocrates, now in the museum
at Gizeh. Those, with the exception, of course, of Aahmes, were
probably provincial or local kings. Above some ships in the left
part of the tomb a festival of Ramses III. is mentioned, probably a
later addition. According to Maspero this tomb dates from the
20th Dynasty.

Farther to the left lies the tomb of Aahmes, Chief of the Sailors,
the son of Alina and her husband Baba, who was the maternal
grandfather of Pihari. The Funereal Inscription is carved in the
rock instead of being painted on stucco , a fact which lends great
importance to this tomb.

The inscription covers nearly the whole wall to the right, as we
enter, sharing it with the figure of the deceased. Aahmes appears with
Atpu his wife, seated in a chair beneath which cowers a. pet monkey;
before them stand their daughter’s son Pihari, who caused this tomb to
he adorned for his gallant grandfather“ Beneath is another Fiber, ofrering
aaerifiee to his father Harari and his wife, and beneath him again are
three sons, including yet another Hhar. Beside the door to the aide-
chamher is another dedication to Aahmes, the chief of the sailors, from
his grandson Pihari (p. 239), to keep his memory green in this spot. The
biography of Aehmes thug begins: rAzthmee (Amasis), commander of the
sailors, son of the late Abna, speaks: I speak to you, all ye people. Learn
the marks of honour which fell to my share; for I was distinguished
seven times with the golden necklace, in the presence of the whole coun-
try . © ' Male and female slaves were my own (the names of the slaves
presented to Aahmee are inscribed on the outside of the tomb), and I
received many fleidss, The name of a great hero which he (the speaker)
won for himself, will nevermore be obscured in this land. . He speaks:
I was born in the town of Hehent (Eileithyiar, my father was a colonel
under the late king Rasekenen (Vol. 1., p. 9), and was named Babe, son
of Roan; then I served in his stead as captain on board the ship 'The
Young Ox', in the reign of Ra-neb-pehti (is, Aahmes IO, I was young
and unmarried and slept on the couch of the Rhenna (perhaps those ex-
eluded from the dwelling of the married, Le. bachelors). But after Ihad
founded a household (taken a wife), I betook myself to fight in the N.
fleet. Then I followed the king on foot, when he mounted his war-
chariot, When the fortress of Ha-war (Aharie, a stronghold of the Hykeos,
Vol. L, p. 89) was besieged, I had to fight on foot before the king. Then
I was appointed to the ship 'Eha em Mennefer‘ (Ascent in Memphis); we
fought in the arm of the river at Abaris and I acquired booty and won
a hand (of a slaughtered enemy). This was reported to the officer of the
king, and I received the golden necklace for velour. Another contest took
place on the same spot and I was again awarded the golden necklace fur
valour', Aahmes was decorated a third time at Takemi, to the S. of the
fortress. ‘Aharis was taken and I captured there in 3114 persons, amen
and 3women; Hie M 'eety assigned them to me as slaves'. - The next
lines inform us that a tar the king had captured the fortress of the Hyk-
303 and overcome the nomadic tribes, he carried on war with the tribes
of the S., in which Aahmes took part and won fresh laurels. He served
also under Amenhotep I. and Tutmes L Under the lastenamed prince the
Egyptian army penetrated far into Asia. The inscription goes on: 'There-
upon his majesty set out for Syria (Ruten), in order to reduce the peoples
to his good pleasure. He reached Mesopotamia (Naharina). His Majesty,
the living, hound1 and strong one, met this wretched one (the prince of
Mesopotamia), and undertook the attack. The king wrought terrible but-

innumerable. I was present as colonel of my soldiers, and His Mmeety
