to Kcneh. KENEH. 5, Route, 73

At the time of the pilgrimage to Mecca Keneh presents a very lively
scene, as it is then frequented by large numbers of the participators
in that great religious picnic. The spiritual and material wants of
the pious Ecdjadj are catered for by six spacious mosques, nume-
rous 1yoftee-hoases, and a large number of places of amusement, among
the attractions of which Egyptian dancing-girls are prominent. For
the rest Keneh differs little in general character from the other
towns of Upper Egypt. The traveller should not fail, however, to
see the most valuable piece of land near Keneh, which is about one
Feddén (3500 sq.yds.) in area and yields an excellent variety of
Potter's clay that has made Keneh pottery, like that of Aesiilt, famous
throughout the country. Keneh has a special reputation for its
Kulal (p1. of Kalle), or cool porous water-bottles, and for its Balms
and Ztr, large vessels used in carrying, purifying, and preserving
water. In some of the early Egyptian inscriptions flgures of the
Balms and Zh appear as distinctive symbols, in thd exact forms in
which they are made to-day. Hundreds of thousands of these clay
vessels are annually exported from Keneh in boats of a primitive
but not unpraetical description, constructed for the purpose, in
which they are piled up in pyramidal form, fastened together with
repeat made of the hast of the date-palm and attached to rectangular
frames. A trustworthy report flares the number sent away in 1860
at 900,000. Considerable activity is also manifested in the manu-
facture of kiln-dried pottery, generally either red or black, used for
ehibouk-hetulis, bottles, pitchers, vases, drinking-vessels, ete., of
every size and shape. The almost invariably graceful forms and
tasteful decorations of these utensils may be unreservedly set down
as a bequest from ancient Egypt,

6, Routes through the Eastern Desert.

Iremsh is a place of some importance as the 'starting-point of the
caravans traversing the Arabian desert to Kogér (p. 77) and as an em-
porium of the trade of Upper Egypt with the eoast-distriea of the Red
Sea. n conaequently affords a good opportunity of making a short and
comparatively easy desert journey, as the interesting excursion to Fottr
can be made without any very great privation or danger. The 4NM5BVaW''
route leads viii Hamdmdt, traversing the rocky Arabian Desert, which is
not only of great scenic grandeur but also full of interest for the natu-
ralist and the archaeologist. Eogér, a port OD the Red Sea, is about
110 M. from geneh, and the journey can be made comfortably in four,
or at most flv"é days. '

These desert-routes were important even in antiquity for the trade
with the seaports and the land of Punt (Arabia) on the one side and the
valuable quarries in the mountains of the Arabian Desert on the other,
Spices and other costly products were sent across the desert to Keneh,
at Brat on donkey-baek and afterwards on camels, while green breccia
and several varieties of granite were sent down to the sea. in return. The
most important points on the Red Sea, named from N. to 8.. were Myas
Harmon (now Abu Bar tl-WN, in the latitude of Monfts1i1t; Lenka:
Timen now Kogér; and Berenike, in the latitude of Assuin. The route
from keneh to Myos Hormoa leads to the N.E., and a short detour may
be made through the dei Fattreh, with its granitequa it -past
