Irrought to be saerifleed. The landing-place 0n the other bank, op-
posite Karnak, was united with the temple of Kurnah by rows of
sphinxes. As the ancient pilgrim continued on his way towards the
N.W. and crossed the hill of the cemetery now called iy1-Asastf, he
came in sight of the rocky amphitheatre which enclosed the terraced
precincts of the temple of Dér elmBahri. Northwards from Kurneh a
well-made route led to the valley of the Tombs of the Kings, now
called BiUn e1-MuWr, which could also be reached by a shorter
though more fatiguing mountain-path from el-Asasif. Between the
entrance of the valley of the Rings' Tombs and el-Asastf and close
to the mountain lay the neeroporis known as Drah Ahu’l Neggah,
Thence following the edge of the fertile strip towards the S.W. we
reach the magnificent Ramesseum, Behind rises the mountain-ridge,
The tombs on its E, slope, partly occupied as dwellings by the
fellal.stn, belong to the village new called Shfkh 'Abd s3ltlriiah.
As we gaze down upon the plain from the higher-lying graves, the
Colossi of Memnon are conspicuous in the midst of the fertile belt.
Behind these are the prominent ruins, known as K6m el-Hétzen,
rising near the central point of an imaginary line connecting the
Ramesseum with the temple of Medinet Habu, the magnificent
Memnonium of Ramses III. Turning from Medinet Helm to the
S.W., we reach a small temple of the Ptolemies; to the tC, near
the mountains, lies the valley with the Tombs of the Queens; and
skirting the line of hills to the NW. we reach the scanty tomb-
remains of Eurnet Murra'i, to the W. of which lies a valley with
the small but interesting temple of Dér el-Medineh. Two points
are of special value for taking one's bearings, One is the summit
of the mountain lying between tyr-Asa/d and Bihhn er-Mu1i'ik; the
other is the door of either of two tombs at Shékh 'Abd erAurnah,
One of the tombs, in which Lepsius lived, is known to the guides as
Kaer Lepsius; the other was inhabited by Ehers, who is remembered
by the fellahin as Abu Bales (Father of Paul).

The name THEBEB is probably the Greek form of the Egyptian

was borne by cities in Bmotia, Attica, Thessaly, Cilicia, near Miletus
