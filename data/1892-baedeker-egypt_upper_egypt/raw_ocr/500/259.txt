the tomb of Osiris, of the righteous prophet of Ammon, Neferhotep’.
After an izstroduetion, wishing peace to the dead, and glorifying the
sumgod, it continues literally as follows: 'Celebrate the great day, o
prophet. Well is to thee, fragrant resin and ointments are laid before
thee. Here are wreaths and flowers for the waist and shoulders of thy
sister, who is pleasant to thine heart, as she rests beside thee. Let us
then sing and strike the harp in thy presence. Leave all cares behind
and think of the joys, until the day of the voyage comes when man casts
anchor on the land which delights in silence’.

Near this is the once splendid tomb of another Neterhotep, over-
seer of theeattle of Ammon, but now in ruins and used as a mage-
zine by the keeper of the Gizeh museum. There may also be visited
in the neighbourhood the tombs of 2rheri'il', of the time of Amen-,
hotep IIE, of Mai, and of an ofheial in charge of the stables of
Amenhotep IL, the inner room of which is the resting place of
Mahu, a writer of the treasury in the time of Ramses II.

If the dhahebiyeh is lying at Luxor, the small boat should he ordered
to wait wiith some men on the left bank of the river at the E. end of
the islan '

19. The Mortuary Temple of Seti I. at Kumah.

Second Day on the W. bank: 1. Temple of $urneh; 2. Tombs of the
Kings (Bibén e1-hruliikr,r 3. Neeropolig of e1-AUatf and of Drah Abu'b.

To the W. bank as on the previous day, see p. 152. Prom the
landing-Pio of the ferry we ride across the fields in a northerly
direction and in 3/4 hr. reach the handsome *Temple, the front of
which with its columns is visible at a considerable distance. The
original building (see the annexed plan) was of smaller dimensions
than the Ramesseum and Medinet Habu, its complete length being
518 ft., and of this only the actual sanctuary with its halls and
chambers, 153 ft. in depth remain, while there are only scanty
remains to prove the former existence of two Courts and the Pylom
which enclosed them. The Sphinx“ which were placed like guar-
dians to the right and left of the door leading into the first Court
on the inside, are half covered with earth. They were placed there
by Seti L, and on the bases were inscribed the name's of all the
nations which he had conquered. Of all the buildings in the Necro-
polis of Thebes, this one most reminds us of the Memnonium of Abydos
(p. 54), and a closer inspection of the style of inscriptions and re-
presentations will both bring out and explain their similarity, for
the temple of Ifurnah was founded by Seti 1., the builder of Abydos,
and both the sanctuaries were restored and completed by Ramses II.
Theyhoth served the same purpose, as a place where the manes of
the founder might be remembered, and offerings made. At Abydos
it is true that throughout attention was paid to the pilgrims to
Osiris, while here it is the gods of Thebes that were promi-
nent, and this was the centre of the festival of the mountain valley,
