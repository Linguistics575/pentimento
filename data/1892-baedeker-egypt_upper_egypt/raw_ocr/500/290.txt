with axes, olive-branehes, etc. Lying on the ground is a peculiar
capital, such as may be seen also in other parts of the temple, con~
sisting of a cube, with the mask of the goddess Hathor carved on
the front and back. The upright broken shafts should also be
noticed; one half was treated as a pillar, the other as a polygonal
column with 7 sides, and an inscription was placed on the surface
of the pillar.

The *2hird Terrace (MarietUhs Terrassc du Centre) deserves
especial notice. Underneath there were on eaéh side, left and right,
two rows of 11 square pillars which together formed two halls, 88 ft.
long, open to the east. Of these the pillars of the left hell still
stand, only two remaining in that on the right. These halls sup-
ported a roof, of which all that remains is a. fragment of the archi-
trave and a 1'blroed slab on the il pillars in the back row, The
scenes represented on the Inner wall and on the left side are of
great interest.

Disregarding for the present the part of the temple to the IeftCSpeos
of Hathor, p. 227) we begin with the right side of the inner wall
below the third terrace. The flrst scenes are somewhat damaged,
but those which follow are in a good state of preservation, and refer
e11iitsfly to the expedition on which Queen 1Iatasa-RamaU sent her

ships to Arabia Cl Punt . 1. Remake represented as
a

king, with the double crown on her head, end the Maff in her hand,
before Ammon-Ra. There is a long but obliterated inscription.
2 The queen with two bowls full of grains of incense, and with
the helmet on her head, before the sacred boat of Ammon-Ra. The
boat with a rem’e head at each end is carried by priests, of whom
the two in the centre are high-priasta, clad in lisoptmr-thimu Next
we see 7 Nehautreee in tube, probably incense-hearing trees imported
to Egypt from the East; men with tube are piling up the incense
in heaps. Above are the weighing and measuring of precious metals,
as may be seen elsewhere. The weights need for weighing the gold
rings are in the form of oxen lying down. The goddess Sefekh marks
the result on a tablet. Next are 3 Nehe~trees. Below is seen a group
of 8 cattle, two eating the rtsaGgrass on the river-side. The scene
reminds us vividly of Pharoah'ss dream (Gem XLI. 1). 'And it came
to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and,
behold, he stood by the rivet. And, behold, there came up out of
the river seven well-favoured kine and fat-tusher, and they fed in
the rsyi1-gtass'. Near this are seeks with cosmetics (mestem). Again
we tind the king with the insignia of power. Than 2 rows of ships
belonging to the fitytst which Ramaka-Hatasm sent to Arabia. The
shape of the vessels, their rigging, ears, and rudders should be
noticed, as well as the cargo which can be seen on board, and the
leading by means of a small boat. The necessary explanations
are given by small inscriptions above the Ir,),,,,),,',:,,',,:,)',,',',,',)';:: To the left,
