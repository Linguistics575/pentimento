to Aot%,tt, TELL EL-AMARNAH. 1. Route, 25

Not only are the subjects of these representations of great interest,
but the character of the architectural drawing itself should be no-
tieed, It is something between a sketeh-plar1 and a finished picture.
The ground-plan i8 clearly indicated, but at the same time an idea
is given of the appearance of the external elevation of the building.
Clearneee and truthful reproduction of details are aimed at here as
zealously as in the figure-drawing. The ground-plan is first sketched
in, and then the outlines of the facades, and even the doors and
trees are added so far as the space allows.

The forms of the personsrepresented vary considerably from those
seen in tombs elsewhere, Almost all have the same thickeetbody and
lean neck that characterize the king. The flgure of the latter is, of
course, a portrait; and it is possible that the courtly artists bur-
dened the subjects with the weaknesses of the prince so that his de-
formities might not appear as anything unusual. Amenhotep IV,
was certainly not a foreigner; but his mother Tii may have been
one, and may have installed her fellow-eountrymen at the Egyptian
court. Even the highest dignitaries have un-Egyptian features.
Among these is the royal favourite Merira, who is represented on
the right wall of Tomb 3, a8 literally overwhelmed with the golden
neeklaces,1inge, and orders, Which the Pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty
delighted to shower on their loyal adherents; he stands in front of
the royal family, the members of which are attended by farr-_ers
and courtiers of all kinds. 'Let him receive gold', says the inserip-
tion, 'on his neck, on his back, and on his feet’. Secretaries make
a note of the donations and write out the royal patents, which are
also mentioned elsewhere. The fourth necklace is being hung
round the neck of Merim, while the fifth and sixth are handed to
him by two off1eials; a third attendant holds three golden rings.
The Urma, to whom this favourite belonged, were, in addition to
their other dignities, the most learned physicians and high-priests of
IIelioporis (mentioned in the inscription). The sickly prince na-
turally pays the highest honours to his physician, one of the Urma
priests. Another of these priests, named Khui, is mentioned in the
Ebers Papyrus as having prepared a famous eye-ssalve, and it is pee-
sible that Amenhotep IV. may have been blind or, at least, threaten-
ed with blindness. His outstretched neck suggests the attitude
of a blind man, and in the song of one of the priestesses by the
door-post of the same tomb occur the words: 'The lord of goodness
arises . . © . No other one opens his countenance, healing his eyes
With his beams',

Tomb d contained the remains of the 'truth-loving' Aahmes, the
royal secretary, adjutant of the farr-heartyrs, and first lord of the
bedehamber. Here we find one of the great dignitaries celebrating
the glory of the sun. He praises the beauty of the setting of the
lord of the lords and princes of the earth, at sight of whom the
