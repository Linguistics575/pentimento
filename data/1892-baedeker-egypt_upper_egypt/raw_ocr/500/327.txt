A fewpaees farther to the S, and'at a lower level than the
stelescis a small Chapel, which in spite of its very ruinous Com1iu
tion, we can reéognize as having been founded by the great builder
Seti I. The inscriptions on the stele are completely obliterated. --
To the right of this chapel is a carefully hewn but empty Recess, and
in the same eliff but facing N. in thé direction of the two steles, is
a Tablet of a chiefmpriest of Ammon named Roi, who here appears
with Merenptah I. before the god.

The Quarries on the W. bank of the Nile are of enormous size,
but few traces of inscriptions are now to be found. An Inscription
of Amenhotep 111., however, records the transport of stones by the
Nile for a temple of Ptah (at Memphis') There are two Posts of
the time of Seti 1., and Demotic Inscriptions from Roman times.
An unfinished tyo1ossa1 Sphinx, nearly opposite the usual landing-
place of the dhahabiyehs, is also net without interest. Even if all
the monuments of Egypt had disappeared, these huge quarries
would serve as a proof that building op erations of unsurpassed "-
tent had Once been carried on here. The town of Khennu appears
to have stood here, not on the E, bank. A few unimportant ruins
may be traced.

According to papyri now in Turin, the residence of the kings of the
12th Dyn., the Amenemhas and Uturrtasens, was transfarred to Khmnu.
Under the 19th and 20th Dyn. this town possessed a University. A papy-

rus, now in the British Museum, contains a'warning to the students of
this institution against excessxve beer-drinking and idleness.

15 M. (39/: M. from Edfu). Irihn Ombo is a Steamer Elation, at which
the three-weeke tourist-eteamer halts 1/2 u., the four~weeke steamer 1 ha,
both on the upward voyage; while the mail-steamer passes a. night here
on the downward voyage. .

The mountains recede from the river immediately above the
iltyi11is of Gebel Silsileh (p, 255), giving space to the desert which
appears grey on the Arabian side and yellow on the Libyan side.
The narrow cultivable strip is tilled by peasants of a distinctlydarker
complexion than the felribin of the Thebaid, Both land and people
approach gradually nearer to the Nubian type. At the village of
Mentyeh (E, bank) we enter the E. branch of the stream, which here
forms the island of Mantstrheh, with a village of the same name,
On the W. bank ofthe Nile, opposite the lower end of this island, lies
Abu Mangar, where Arcelin claims to have discovered stone imple-
ments in a deposit of gravel containing marine mussels, which was
overlaid by more recent deposits of the river.

On a hill on the E, hank next appears the beautiful *Temple of
Kern Ombo, conspicuous from a considerable distance. Somewhat
nearer the river is another temple, now almost entirely destroyed.
