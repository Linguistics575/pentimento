head. The flgures of Osiris, especially the lower parts, are 80mty-

cesses, each with the king, variously clad, standing between two
deities. The wall-spaees above and between these recesses are oe-
cupied with representations of the king making offerings, the king
being depicted alone in the lower row, and the god to whom he
offers worship in the upper row.

The upper eeenea on the Right (N.) Wall are partly destroyed, but we
can make out the king before Ra, Tum, Mentu, and Khnum. In the tea
ceases (right) is the king between Harmachis end Jusas; between Horus,
lord of Mam tAtowsfih'mbty1O and Isis, mother of the gods; between Nefer-

Ramses himself and the goddess Hathor, with the cow‘s head, with erect
horns, between which are two feathers es in the headdress of Ptah (see

mummy, before the dtiihed Ramses, end Sekhet seated on a throne.

The following room, the Sekos, about 36 ft. wide though only
17 ft. deep, is entered by a proportionately small door, on the left
side of which is the king before Ptah. The ceiling is supported by
two square pillars. To the right and left two oblong recesses (see
PI. p. 314) run off from this chamber, and at the back are three
other recesses, the central and largest of which is the Sanctuary. On
the pillars the king appears worshipping various deities. On the
N. side of the right pillar he is named ‘Beloved of RedHarmaehis

in the land of Wawa' W, a name for Nubia
already met with (p. 30?). At various places the temple is spoken
of as cr> g Pa Ptah, 'House of Ptah', e.g. on the door of the
sanctuary, li) the right of which the king is called the beloved of
seven gods, Ammon, Ptah, , Shu, Mentu, Khnum, Sekhet, and

Rather. At the back of the sanctuary is a recess with four seated
ilgurtss, representing (from the left) Ptah, the ileifled Ramses, Ptah
with the headdress (see above), and Hathor with the cow’s head.
