IL Monetary System.

The information as to the Egyptian monetary system given on
pp. 4, ti of our flrist vol., has to be supplemented by the statement
that the Egyptian Government has recently issued new silver coins
and some gold coins, and that those now form the only legal Car-,
rency throughout the whole country , where their value is uniform.
The unit of reckoning is still the Piastrc (Arabic Ghirah, plux.
kaah). The Egyptian Pound is divided into 100 piastres or
i000 Miuiémes.
