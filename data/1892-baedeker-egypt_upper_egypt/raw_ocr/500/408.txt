105 ft., in order to form the imposing roek-fapadts of this temple.
At the top we see a. row of 22 cynocepheli (some destroyed),
which we learn from other Egyptian temples to recognize as wor-
shippers of the tam-god, Below these are the carteuches of the
king, surrounded with TJraus-serpents, Then follows the short de-
dication inscription of Ramses the Great, which begins in the
middle and runs in both directions; on the right it styles the king
'beloved by 1Tarmsshis', on the left â€˜heloved by Ammon, king of
the gods', Still lower, in a recess in the centre of the temple-wall, is
e full-relief statue of Horus (Harmachis), with the sun on his head.
and the symbols of life in his hands, while below, to the right, is

the goddess Ma, to the left the symbol user, thus expressing the

king's name in picture-writiug. To the right and left is the king
again, presenting figures which also express his name, and wer-
shipping the god. Below, and somewhat indistinct, are the double
cartouehes of the king.

Our attention is most forcibly attracted to the four seated Colossi
(Pl, a, b, e, d), hewn out of the rock, with their backs against the
eliff, That to the left of the entrance (Pl. ti) has unfortunately been
violently deprived of its head and arms', which now lie on the
ground in front. The colossus on the other side of the door (Pl, e)
was restored by Seti ll, Each of those figures is not less than 66 ft.
high, their various limbs being in proportion, In spite of the enor-
7 mens scale the general effect is successful, and the eountenances
have a pleasant and intelligent expression. All four represent
Ramses the Great, as he testified by the certouehee on the breast
and arms and between the legs. To the right and left of each are
standing figures, mostly of women; to the right and left of the en-
trance, Nofertari Merl-en-mut, consort of Ramses; between the legs
of the injured colossus, prince Amenhikhopeahf ('Ammon in his
tsword'), who is intxoduced in the temple of Derr as the oldest son
(eemee) of Ramses 11.; to the left of this colossus Tua, the king's
mother. Beside the colossus farthest to the left are two daughters
of the king, viz. Nelib-tati, on the left, and Bant-an.ta on the right;
between the legs is an unnamed female figure, The tlgt1rtss at the
sides of the colossus to the extreme right, the names of which are
concealed by the sand, probably correspond to these. In 1817 Bel-
zoni Spent 14 days in freeing the temple from the sand that had
drifted into it from the desert behind. Burekhardt, however, had
mentioned it previously. It was again laid here by Lepsius in 1844
and by Mariette in 1869, but the sand has already covered great
part of it to a considerable depth.

Before we enter the temple our attention is claimed by a Greek 'in-
eeriptien which is found on the left 1e of the injured colossus, along with
Ir/te other Greek, Carian, and hoenieian imseripiiont, It us as
