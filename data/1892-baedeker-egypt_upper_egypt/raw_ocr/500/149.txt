of Cleopatra, with the sistrum and the Mentv-myekli, Before his
mother stands Ptolemy Kieres, or Caesarion, the son of Caesar, offer-,
ing incense. Both are worshipping Isis and her son Horus.

Behind the temple of Hathor is a Temple of Isis, consisting of a
vestibule and three chambera. The unattractive and uninteresting build-,
ing, which is partly covered with rubbish, owes its origin to the emperor
Augustus. The gate facing the E. bears the Egyptian cartouches of Claudius
and Nero, and two Greek inscriptions on the entablature mention the
2tst year of Tiberius. This gateway marks the limit of the temple area
in this direction; and about 10 min, farther on we reach another gate,
which apparently belonged to another temple-precinet. It bears the car-
touehe of Antoninus.

8. From Keneh to Thebes (Luxor).

kT M, Sueunou in about 5 hrs. Cook’s mail-steemer halts for
21/2 hrs. at Keneh on Wed. and Bat. mornings on its downward voyage,
and crosses thence to Dendemh.

Keneh, see p, 72, The steamer passes three islands. On the
W. bank lies the village of Builds, with clay-deposits from which
most of the ‘Keneh pottery' is made (p. 73). Balglti, (p1. of Belles,
named after the village), h%lal (pl, of Ktiue), and other kinds of jars,
some of considerable size, lie on the banks awaiting shipment.

12% M. (E. bank) Knit, the ancient Koptos, nearly opposite
Belles. Though now of no importance, this place was down to the
time of the Khalifs a populous and thriving trading-town.

Even in antiquity a canal, mentioned by Straho and still
traceable, led from the Nile to the walls of the town, past which the
Canal of Senhur (p. 100) now flows, One of the stones of the bridge
is said to hear the name of an Antef (iith Dyn.); and there is also
a Greek inscription from the same place, of the 8th year of Trajan
and dedicated to the trieoloured Isis. To the S. of the town and on
the road leading to the desert are various remains of ancient build-
ings. One of these is a square pillar of red granite, bearing a
dedication by Tutmes III. to Amman Ra, and apparently a relic
of a temple built by that monarch. Still farther to the S. is a
narrow passage, with inscriptions of the reign of Cains Caligula,
dedicated to Khem Ra of Koptos upon his Staircase (comp. p. 178).
The stair-case with 14 ascending and 14 descending steps typi'fles
the waxing and waning moon (comp. p. 85). The boat of Khem,
borne by four priests, is here depicted, and beside it is an address
to the priests of Khem upon his Staircase. The most considerable
relic of antiquity, a fragment of black granite, probably part of
an altar, lies to the N,, It comprizes an exaltation of Khem, Isis,
and Beh (eternity) by Ptolemy XIII. Neoe Dionysus.

Koptos in mentioned on very early monuments and also by Greeks
and Roman at a late period. Theophxastus, Pauaaniaa, Atheneeua, P1utssreh,
Josephus, Elihu, Lucien, Stephanns of Byzantium, Agatharchides, Pliny,
Ammianus Marcellinue, Apuleiua, and many other authors, all mention
it, proving the widely-apread fame of the city. It was eapecidl famous

for its commerce, The trade-route, which now leads from Fo, r on the
Red Sea to Feneh, formerly ended at Kuptos, where Ni ceived
