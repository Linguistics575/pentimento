sixty years of age,' who eat with his long neck craning forward so long
as we hovered in danger, and who, with his eyes sparkling with intense
excitement and his lean bird-like face, looked like an eagle on the look
out for prey. A11 went well at firtrt, Only a man and boy, however,
were rowing on the left side, while two men were rowin on the right.
As we quitted the second rapid and were entering a di brent channel,
the sailors on the left side had to row with all their strength; that,
however, proved inadequate and the stream swept the boat round, so that
the stern was foremost. This was the culminating point of the passage.
The re'is without losing his presence of mind for an instant, guided the
helm with his foot, while he assisted the rowers with his arms, turned
the boat round once more, brought it into the right ehannel, and finally
into the less rapid part of the Nile, and 30 to Assuin. The entire passage
lasted t2 minutes.

FROM MAKADAH TO Pumas the crooked road skirts the bank of
the river. The villagenchildren pursue the traveller, bagging for
hakshish. When the path, covered with granite-dust, grows narrower
and begins to lead over smooth granite, the traveller should dis-
mount. The curiously-shaped rocks in the bed and on the bank of the
Nile bear numerous inscriptions. Some of them look as though they
had been built up out of artit1eia11y rounded blocks. These forms
seem to have struck the ancient Egyptians most forcibly, for'in the
relief of the Source of the Nile at Phila (p. 294) -wm. one of the few
representations of landscape in Egypt neMrWMeM' the river-god crouches
under a pile of blocks like these. In 25 min, we reach a small plain
and obtain a charming view of Phila, the most beautiful spot on
the Nile, and the goal of travellers who do not wish to go on to the
second cataract. The small plain above-motioned, to the E. of the
island, is shaded with handsome sycamore trees, near which is a
long low building of a semi-European appearance, with battlemented
roof. This is the deserted station of the Roman Catholic missionaries,
who hence founded settlements in Central Africa, all of which, how-

ever, including flnally that at Khartilrn, have been

abandoned, The walled island, surrounded by clear

W. To the N. a massive double rock, with the name

of Psammetikh II. conspieuows upon it, towers

above the rest; to the W. rises the rocky Island of

Bigeh (p. 297), with numerous monuments and in-,

scriptions. The ferry-boat is to be found at the
village of Shelli}. Between the railway-station of 811811511 and the
Nile is a tine palm-grove, with the tents of the Egyptian troops
under British command. The handsome dhahabiyeh near the bank
is the residence of the commandant. Breakfast may be obtained on
board, but those who come by rail are recommended to bring their
provisions with them from Astnan,
