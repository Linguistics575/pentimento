Egyptian, Demerarchon, son of Amoihiehos, and Pelekoe, son of Udar
mos, wrote.

The leader of this company is here named Psammetikh; in a. Phoen-
ician inscription on the same spot one of the mercenaries is spoken of
as a servant of Her, the general. The writers of the other Greek inecrip-
tiens were partly Ionians from Tees and Kolophon, partly Dorians from
Rhodes, a Sidenian, and a Curiae.

Providing ourselves with candles, or still better with a mtrg-
nesium lamp, we now enter the rock-tample, the interior of which,
with its still vividly coloured pictorial decorations, is no less Ity-.
markable than the exterior. The walls of the first hall (Pl. F),
which is 58 ft, long by " ft, broad, are covered all round with rt)-
presentations, which were ilrgt chiselled in the stone, then covered
with a' thin coating of stucco and painted. The ceiling is supported
by eight square pillars, against which stand fhsiris-flgurtsss of the
king, with the scourge and the creek in his crossed hands. The
ceiling itself is adorned with vultures and the names of the king,
Above the entrance is the remarkably simple dedieation-inseription,
on the right to Harmaohis, lord of the land of Khent, on the left to
Ammon-Ra, king of the gods. The pictorial scenes in this hall are
symmetrically arranged, so that those referring to events in the N.
of Egypt are placed on the N, (right) side, those to events in the
s., on the S. (left) side, A similar arrangement was adapted in the
exterior hall of the temple of Bet el-Walli (p. 310).

On each side of the entranee-wall within are representations,
such as are commonly found on the pylons of more recent temples;
es (.9. at Edfu and Philaa. The king aims a blow with his club at
a number of fees, whom he holds by the hair, while they raise their
hands in supplication. On the left are represented N. tribes, on
the right S. tribes, easily distinguished by their facial character-
istics. Harmaohis stands before the king on the left, and Ammon,
handing him the sword of victory, on the right, Hovering above
the king is a protecting vulture. On a standhrd behind him is the
name Ka nekht meri ma, 'the strong bull, beloved of the goddess
Ma'. In his right hand is en ostrich feather, in his left a head with
the Satan Ka, the person of the king, with the legend 'the living
royal Ka, lord of both lands in the grave, in the house ofthe deep’.
"Beneath are the children of the king; to the right hit sons, to the
left his daughters, with sistra.

We now turn to the S. wall, on the left. At the top are ilvty re-
ligious pictures: saiyriflei'a1 scenes before Amman, Harmachis, the
king in the tree of life kneeling Upon the symbol of the festival,
