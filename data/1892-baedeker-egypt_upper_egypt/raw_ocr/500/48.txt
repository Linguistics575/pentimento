touaet.. motaiydar, 1. Route. 5

Visitors to the Ii'aytigy may regain el-Wastah on the following day at
10.15 am. or at 4.16 p.m., by leaving Medinet tsl-mlm at 9 am. or
NB pan. An extra day allows a visit to the Labyrinth and the Pyramid
of Hawirah (p. 89). In this case the dhnhahiyeh should not be sent on in ad-
vance, but should be ordered to await the traveller‘s return. mtmp- The pyra-
mid and tombs of Médam may also be visited from el-Waatah (see 11.2).

A small camel, beginning near the village of Zdwiyeh (W. bank),
runs oat of the Nile into the Balir Yasuf o, 28).

Further up, in the latitude of Alpnsts el-Medineh and Beniguiif, there
seems to have been another deep channel connecting the river with the
Bahr Yiisuf. These four channels enclosed an inland which has been iderr.
tiiiiit with the 2levaeleoyolitan Nome, unanimously described by Greek au-
thorities as an island. Strabo, who visited it on his way to the Irqiim,
after leaving the name of Aphroiiitoppris, cells it 'a large 'island', and mu
lates that in the city of Aerrae1eopolis the ichneumon was worshipped,
the deadliest foe of the crocodile, held sacred in the neighbouring name
of Arsinoe'; for, he tells us it crawls down the throat of the sleeping
monster and devours its entrails. The large mounds of debris at Alma: :1.
Medium, the Umm el-Etmdm ('mother of rubbish-heaps') of the Arabs, have
been idatifleil with EEertre1eopo1ir, they lie 11 M. to the W. (inland) of
Benieuef. The old name of the town was Khimmu, from which Alena is
derived through the Coptic Hues. The ram-horiied god Horshaf, the
prince of terrors, was also worshipped here. A few columns still stand,
here, and other monuments may be buried under the debris. Systematic
excavations are to be undertaken. At present Ahm’ie need scarcely be
visited except by those who approach the li'ayiUn from Benieuéf.

On the W. bank the mountains recede a little from the Nile,
but on the E. bank their steep and lofty spurs frequently extend
down to the bank in rising picturesque forms. None of the Nile-
villages before Beniisuiif need be mentioned. On the E,, bank stands
the Coptic convent of Mdr Antonios (see p. 4). About 2M, inland
(right) from Zhtin (W. bank) lies the hamlet of Bash (rail, stat,
p. 1), which is inhabited by Copts and thus has some interest for
those who wish to study these direct descendants of the ancient
Egyptians in a community of some size.

Beniguéf, on the W. bank, the first place in Upper Egypt (rail.
stat, p. 1; stat, 3/4 M, from the Nile), is a. town of 10,000 inhab.,
pleasantly situated between the railway and the river,, It contains
a post and telegraph ofihse and is the capital of a province of the
same name, which contains 169 villages and about 220,000 inhabiu
tants. To the left of the rail. station is the Mudiriyeh, or residence
of the mudir or governor. The houses or rather huts of this provin-
cial capital are, however, constructed merely of Nile mud,, The linen-
manufacture for which this place was oelebtated in the middle ages
has greatly declined, but there are several 'sugar-plantations and a
small bazaar. To the left of the railway is a fine grove of palms,

A road which was much frequented before the completion of the rails,
way, leads from Benieuéf into the Fayam (p. M), and travellers with a
tent and plenty of time might still hire camele, asses, or horses here and
proceed to Medina: el-Fayam viii. el-Lahdn (‘gate of the 1rtsyitm'), where the
Bahr Yihruf enters the Fayiim, and Hawdmh. By using the railway for the
{Etg-rg-ggggney and giving up Birket er0furi1n, this excursion can be made
