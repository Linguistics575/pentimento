a. Passage of the First Cataract.

The First Cataract (Arab. /rhelldl, from the earlier form Djéndal) lies
between Assutin and Philee. It must be passed by all who desire to
proceed in their own dhahabiyeh to Wiidi Iflalfah and the second cataract.
When the river is high the passage is guite without danger, and though
it is more difBeuit at later periods 0 the year, nothing more serious
need be feared than some alight damage to the boat. A considerable amount
of time, however, is consumed by the passage, except under favourable
circumstances and when the river is at its highest. Including the necessary
preparations, 2-3 days must be set aside for the passage; and a. carefully
drawn-up centract (p. xxx!) will be found here especially useful. Tra-
vellers who have previously arranged with their dragoman to be com
veyed to and from Wtsdi Ijalfah for a. fixed sum including the passage of
the cataract, will come " beet. Those who have no such arrangement
must come to terms with one of the ehéhhe of the Shellhl or chiefs of the
cataracts. With a reliable dragoman the matter may be arranged in ten
minutes but otherwise (too frequently the ease) difflea1ties are sureto
arise, 'i'he boat will be objected to as too high, too weak, or two large,
the water will be described as too low, or the wind (which must certainly
be taken into the calculation) as too gentle; but none of these objections
should be listened to, if the dhahatrtyeh has been originally hired to
ascend beyond the cataract. Energy and hakshish will overcome difiiealties,,
If the dragoman prove too recalcitrant, the traveller should threaten to
groceed to Wiidi Halfah by camel or by a dhahabiyeh from Philar, and to

ring an action for damages against the dragoman on his return to Cairo.
That will generally produce an eirei, but the action for damages should
not, in the interest of future travellers, be allowed to remain an empty
threat. Dhkhabtyehs may he hired above the cataract, but they are in-
ferior and dear, The cost of ascending the rapids varies from t to 61.,
according to the size of the boat, to which a bakshish of at least 2-31. must
be added. This amount of bakehi‘sh must be paid because as many as
50 or 60, or even, when the vessel is large and the water low, 100 men
are required to tow a dhahahiyeh up the rapids. Travellers may remain
on board during the operation if they cheese, but as the passage takes
several hours, they lose much time.

Since the construction of the railway from Aswan to Philee, and
owing to the disturbances caused by the Beduins, the journey between
the cataracts is now very seldom made by dhahatu'yeht and the ascent of
the rapids by a passenger-boat is quite exceptional.

The descent of the foaming srapidr is much more interesting. Those
who ere very cautions may perhaps eeuee their more precious possessions
to be transported past the cataract by land; but serious accidents almost
never occur, though the wrecks of some dhahabtyehts on the banks prove
that the descent is not absolutely without danger. An excellent view of the
passage may be obtained from a rock on the bank (Bab esh-Shelldl, p. 278).

Passengers by Cook‘s steamers are conveyed down the rapids to
Atumiin in a rowing-boat for ks, a. head, an interesting trip, not wholly
devoid of danger. A halt is made before the chief rapid, in order to view
the natives descending it on trunks of trees. As usual the visitor is
harassed by demands for bakshish. The voyage is then continued through
smaller channels, and at dangerous points, the boat is secured by ropes.
8ee description of a. trip of this kind on p. 279.

The dhahabiyeh ascenae in untwuhled water as far as the island
of Sehél, There it is surrounded 1srtha dark, sinewy, and generally
meet symmetrical forms of the Arabs who are to tow it through the
rapids. Some come on board under the direction of a shékh, while
others remain on the btnk. At f1rtst the dhahabiyeh passes the be,
