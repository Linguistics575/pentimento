68 Route d, ABYDOS. Temple of Ramses "

here is all the more striking from the obvious pains of the founder
to make a costly and enduring monument. Where Seti contented
himself with limestone, Ramses made lavish use of granite, Oriental
alabaster, and black graywaoke. The remaining fragments show
that Ramses erected obeliske of granite tn front of his cenotaph, and
that caryatide-like figures of Osiris, now long since shattered, Mood
at the sides of the firist peristyle court. Plastic ornamentation was
freely used and so richly painted that the colours have to this day
clung to some of the fragments. Ramses followed the example of
his father in eorueerat'ir1g a chamber to the memes of his ancestors.
In 1818 Mr. Bankes discovered in the chamber to the left CE.) of
the flrgt octostyle room a royal list of eighteen names, two of which
were partly destroyed, and the relies of these tablets are still in situ.
M. Mimaut, the French Consul General, tore down the walls on
which the important earteuehes were represented and gent the stones
to Paris, whence they passed by purchase to the British Museum.
Almost no inscription has been left intact here. We learn, however,
that Ramses was much more anxious than his father to record his
own achievements. Not a few names of peoples and towns which he
subdued or captured may still be discerned among the ruins.

The visitor will gladly arrest his steps by the representation of
a grand procession, which is to be found inside the great court, to
the right and left of the entrance. The procession, beginning at
the N.W. corner of the hall, which was formerly surrounded with
(hsirits-pillarss, extends over the whole of the N. wall. Four temple
oNeials are represented, one described as a secretary, two with
leopard-tskins as priests of Osiris and of the house of Ramses Me-
riamon Khnumt Abdu (connected with Ahydoe), and the fourth at
Kerhub. Animals, some living and some dead, are brought to them
for saeriaee, Among these are anteloPes, geese, and oxen of extra-
ordinary size and fatness. On the right side of the fore-eourt are
similar scenes, in which the procession is still more grandly equipped.
Here appear the royal waraehariot, numerous officials, and negroee,
while incense is burned before the statue of the monarch. The eo-
loudng of these figares is surprisingly well preserved.

On the outside of the temple, N. side, is an inscription relating to
the Kheta war, discovered by Eisenlohr in 1870; unfortunately only the
lower parts of lines are preserved. Adjacent, to the W. and N., are
representations of events in the Khet-t war. similar to those of the
Ramesseum at Thebes. The exterior of the 8. well is covered with a
long inscription, recounting the building of the temple, of which the
following is a translation. 'Behold his Majesty, Life, Salvation, and
Health, the beloved eon representing his father Unnofer and makin him
a beautiful and lordly dwelling, built for eternity of white, goo , fair
stone, the two great pylons of finished workmanship, the door-ways of

great seat (to. the inner sanctuary) of alabaster; its sanctuary covered

cycle of gods. Hig exalted father lies within, even as Ra is united with
heaven; his lordly ortrait is by him that begat him, even as Horus on
