(scarcely tit for drinking), and abounds in fish, Some of which
are very palatable, The right of ilishing is let by government, and
the whole of the fitehermtyn dwelling on the banks of the lake are
in the service of the lessee, who receives one-half of the catch.
The boats (merkeb) are very simply constructed, being without
deck or mast; the traveller must take up his quarters on the floor-
ing in the stern; none of the boats have sails, for, as the fish al-
ways go in the same direction as the wind, the flghermen have to
row against the wind in order to catch them, Numerous pelicane,
wild duck, and other water-fowl, frequent the lake. The banks
are extremely sterile; on the N, side are barren hills of considerable
height. In the middle of the lake rises a mass of rock, resembling
a table, and serving as a landmark. Near the 8. bank, from E. to
W., lie the villages of Kafr Tamtyeh, Tirseh, SenhaAr, Abulcsa, Be-
shuai, and Ald Goneheh; the ruins of Dime}: are ,ih1tsteil on the N,
bank, but there are no other villages of importance. A the S.â€˜W.
end of the lake is the promontory of Khashm Kham, overgrown
with tamarieks and reeds, the creeks of which afford good landing-
placee. Ascending thence across the desert, we reach the temple in
about 11/4 hours. The ilighermen object to pass the night on the
bank in the neighbourhood of Kasr Karim, being afraid of the Be-
duine and the 'Afrtt' (evil spirits),

Kaer Kumn is a tolerably well preserved temple, probably of
the Roman, or, at the earliest, of the Ptolemaie period. Before
reaching it we observe numerous traces of an ancient town,
which has now disappeared. The ground is strewn with blocks
o.f hewn stone, burnt bricks, broken pottery, and fragments of
glass. A circular foundation wall indicates the site of an ancient
cistern, while other walls seem to have belonged to vineyards. The
walls of the temple consist of carefully hewn blocks of hard lime-
stone. This temple, like almost all the shrines in the oases, was
dedicated to the ram-headed Ammorrmkhnam, as is proved by the
only two fhy1ras of this deity which still exist,, They stand opposite
to each other at the highest part of the posterior wall of the upper
story of the open roof.

The temple is 20 yds. in width across the facade, and 29 yds. in length.
The entrance, facing the E., is approached by a lofty and carefully con-
structed platform, lk yds. in length, formin a. fore-court, on the 8. side
of which rises a massive structure resemb ing a. tower. Adjoining the
fagade of the temple, to the w. of the entrance door, rises a. massive,
semicircular projection, resembling the half of a huge column. On the
lower floor are the apartments of the temple Which were dedicated to
worship, divided into a triple prosekoa, and leading to the Sekoa or sent:-
tuary. In the flrgt three rooms the ground slopes down towards the 8NMV
tuary, which, built in the form of a cells, adjoins the third room of the
prosekos, and (as in the case of other temples) was divided into three
small rooms at the back. The sanctuary is flanked by two narrow pa8-
sages, each of which is ndjoined by three rooms. The rooms of the pro-
aekos also have adgaeent chambers from which we may enter the callers,
or ascend by two ights of steps to the upper floor with its different apert-
ments, and thence to the roof, whence we obtain an extene' ' of t
