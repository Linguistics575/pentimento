Right Obelisk has been overthrown, and the fragments ofits shattered
shaft are seen lying scattered around. The top has fallen some
distance to the N. The 'Left Obelisk (Pl. h), still standing, is the
largest obelisk in Egypt. The total height was estimated by the
engineers of Napoleon‘s expedition at 971/2 It, its diameter at the
base 81/2 ft., its mass 4873 cubic ft, and its weight 3673 tonsxt It
is made of fine red granite, and the inscriptions upon it are among
the finest specimens of the grand style, which tttmrightyd at the date
of its erection. Queen Hatasu Khnumt-Amen, who was regent for
her brother Tntmee 111. during his minority, and who erected this
monument, was a true child of the Egyptian 'age of ehivalry’ which
did not close until the reign ofAmenhotep IV., the sun-worshipper.
Her name will frequently be met with again, especially in her
t6rraets-ternp1ts " Dtr el-bahri (p. 223). She was the half-sister
of two kings (Tutmes IL and Tutmes 111.), and was named
queen by her father Tutmes 1., probably because. her mother was
of purer royal blood than the mother of her hilt-brothers. After
her fatUr's death she reigned in her own name along with Tut-
mes IL, whom she married, and on her husband’s decease she ruled
on behalf of Tutmes IIL, who appears also to have been her MMP.
in-law. Masculine in disposition, she carried on important wars
and reared large buildings. The less energetic Tutmee IL yielded
to the guardianship of his sister and wife, but Tutmes III. appears
to have early compelled her to relinquish to him the crown of Lower
Egypt. After her death he caused her name to be chiselled out in
some places and to be replaced by his own in others -- an instance
of the irreverent disfigurtsrmsnt of monuments only too common
in ancient Egypt. Hatasu Khnumt-Amen , the royal Amazon,
caused herself to be represented with the ornaments of the male
Pharaohs, and even with a heard. The beautifully carved central
inscription, formerly inlaid with electrum or silver-gilt, contains
her name alone; though she permitted her brother's name to appear
" the sides. Later usurpers have not entirely spared even this noble
monument. The iide-ir1soriptitms contain short sentences with the
formulae usually employed for the presentation of gifts and the
bestowing of the blessings of life, while the eentral-imuiiptions
refer to the dedication of the ohelieks. One of the inscriptions is as
follows: 'The mistress of the diadems, whose years do not wither
(literally ‘are green or fresh'), the victory-bringing Horus, ete., Ha-
tasu, erected this as a monument to her father Ammon, the lord of
the thrones of both lands, while she reared two obelisks to him in
front of the pylon of Ammon Areaphes, adorned with statues, and
inlaid it with a profusion of electrum (iibrtrratilt), in order that it
might shine over both lands like the sun's disc. Never since the
