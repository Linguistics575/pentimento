258 Route 24. GEBEL SILSILEH. From Edfu

The *MoNxrhnmays TO THE SOUTH are as interesting as those just
described, from which they are reached in about 1/4 hr. The route
leads to the -S., sometimes skirting the river-bank, sometimes "sail-,
ing through the ancient quarries. We tlrst reach Two Chambers,
with the epeninge fading the river, and recesses at the back. At
the first are two, and at the second are three unnamed sitting stew
tues, hewn eat of the rock. The chambers belonged to offieials of
Tutmes 111., whose name occurs over the entrance along with those
of Ammon Harmachis and Sebek. The first cave belonged to Khem
nekht, overseer of graneries, who is here represented along with his
wife, The second, to the N., belonged to the mayor Amatu and his
wife, and contains a series of figures, To the S. occurs the name of

Amenhotep II. $83 a Ea kheperu; with two small States tn

bad preservation on the left, and two others, better preserved, on
the right. Farther to the S. near the river is a brightly painted Cave,
with painted ceiling. A relief here depicts Amonemhat, a high
priest of Ammon (probably, from his name, under the 12th Dyn.)
saorifieing to his parents and those of his wife Mimi.

The guides point out large square holes in the lofty rocks as
having been used to fasten the above-tmaimed mythical chain of
Silsileh. Skirting the bushy rivtyr-hank we presently reach three
Inscribed Tablets, offering a picturesque appearance as seen from
the Nile. Two of them, adorned with concave eernices and with
doors, lie close beside each other. The arehitrave is borne by setup-,
tured 1yud-eohurinis, the shafts of which represented stems of plants
bound together by a band. Both of these brightly painted facades
act as frames for large States, placed at the back of small chapels
about 6 ft, deep. That to the 8. (left) was erected by Ramses II.
in the f1rst year of his reign, that to the N, (right) try Merenptah I.
(Boat-hi-ma) in his first year. Each is formed of three parts, At
the top is the triad to Which it was dedicated, ~next is a Hymn to
the Nile, and below is a list of saerifleiys, In the one case the divine
triad consists of Ammon, Math, and Khunsu, the chief triad of
Upper Egypt. in the other of Ra Harmaehis, Ptah, and Hapi, recall~
ing Lower Egypt. A third, similar Stale, dating from the 6th year
of Ramses 111., is to be ‘seen on anisoleted rock to the right. All
are more or less damaged; bat a. restoration of the text, which is
the same on all three, with a few trifling variations, is rendered
possible by collation.

L. Stem has published a German Translation of the corrected in-
eeription on the stele of the first year of Ramses IL (the oldest end beat
given preserved), with a collation of the other two, A few extracts are here
from this thrice-repeated Hymn to the Nile, the god to whom Egypt owed
her very origin, and upon whom she was dependent for the conditions of
continued existence from year to year. Similar hymns to the name god
have come down to us in a papyrus from the hand of Anna, one of the

meet famoue’euthore of the period of the Pharaohs; and these are clmly
connected with the hymn now before us. The ineeriptio begins ‘In the
