27. The Island of Il1ephatit'ints,

This island is reached by small boat in th few minutes from the landing-
place. Cook‘s tourists are iirtrt transported in comfortable boats to Ele-
phantine and then to the bazaar at Asauz’in (small gratuity). A row round
the island is recommended (1/2 hr.). The entire visit takes barely an hour.

Elttphantine was a place of great sanctity from a very early pe-
riod among the ancient Egyptians. It formed a name by itself

A,
with a. capital, named like the entire island T j g) Ah and also

am Ab was the Egyptian for elephant, so that Elephantine

is merely the Greek translation of a native name. The Arabs call
it simply Sestreh, tle. island, or 6lesstret Amrtaea; and it is also said
to be named ess-iiMhir or 'the blooming'. Though the vegetation is
luxuriant in many spots, the writer never heard the last-given name

applied to it.

The Egyptian priests described the Source of the Nile " a mystery,
that would only be revealed to the soul at the twelfth gate of the under-
world; yet at the same time, they pointed out the 'aymborieal sources of
the Nile', so to speak, in the eddies among the rocks of the cataract-

eh C)
to the S. of Eiisphantims, They named these
. <::> :5 o I l l
m. the Kerti or sources of 1il1ephantims. Herodotus heard of these from
a scribe in the treasury of the temple of Athena at Sars, The Halicar~
nassien thought that the priest was but jesting when he told him that
between Syene and Elephantine lay two lofty peaked mountains, Krophi
and Mophi, from the midst of which gushed' the bottomless sources of the
Nile, one half of which flowed to the N, to Egypt, the other half to the S.
to Ethiopia. m However foolish this opinion, which Seneca also reports,
may appear, it was not pure invention, for the monuments inform us that
the people were really taught to believe that the Egyptian Nile had his
abode among the rapids to the S. of 1tiephantine, Some located it to the
N. of the island of Bigeh-Senem (p. 297). Khnum, the god of cataracts,
was revered before all other gods on this island; and next to him ranked
Sati (a form of Tsits-tlotus), because the beginning of the inundation coin»
cided with the early rising of this constellation, and the cataract may be
regarded as the threshold of the swollen Nile entering Egypt.

In the year 1822 Mohammed 'Ali, in order to build a palace for
himself at Assuiin, caused the destruction of the Temple of Khnum,
built under Amenhotep m, of the 18. Dyn. near the S. end of the
island, and also of a smaller Temple of Tutmes 111., lying more to
the N .W., and known as the N, temple. Travellers pass the latter
on their way to the city, in whose N. outskirts it lay. The savents
of the French Expedition saw this temple before its destruction and
published views of it. Now all that is to be seen on the island are
some huge heaps of ruins, a granite doorway of the time of Alexan~
der L, and a granite Statue of Merenptah 1. Blocks of stone and
sculptured fragments lie mound.

The inhabitants of the' two villages on the island, many of whom
understand nothing bat Nubian, offer coins, small anti uities (many imi-
tations), and fragments of pottery with inscriptions ostraea) for sale,
The last-named are sometimes valuable; the inscriptions a ‘Vw th
