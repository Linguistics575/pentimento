those in the tombs of the ancient kingdom or with those peculiar
to the times of a Seti or a Tutmee; but we cannot refuse our ad-
miration even to these products of later Egyptian art, Here and
there (as in several chambers of the upper awry) we meet speci-
mens of hasty and poor workmanship; but as a. rule the sculpture
of Dendereh is pleasing and harmonious in style and executed with
a. care that does not overlook the smallest detail. The eye is unl-
formly pleased by the harmony of the whole with its details and by
the great variety of composition which manifests itself in spite of
the prescribed form to which the artist was eonf1aed,,

Neither the general architectural scheme of the temple as a whole
nor the style of the details shows any essential variation from those
that may be traced in the earlier Egyptian temples. The iirist
apartment, here as elsewhere, is a handsome Hypostyle Hall (PL E),
open in front, with IM massive columns supporting the roof (comp.
p. 93), Next follows a room with six columns (Pl. D), with three
apartments to the left (XVIII, XIX, xx) and three to the right
(xxx, nu, xxm), from the last of which (xxm) a passage leads
to the festel chambers beside Hell B. The next room (Pl. q),
with no columns, hes apartments xv: and xvn on the left. A
fourth hell (Pi, B), adjoined on the left by a single apartment
(XII) and on the right by the suite of three festal chambers (x111,
XIV, xv), leads to the Adytum (PI. A), a long narrow room in
which the sacred boats were kept. From the passage (P1. a) which
encircles the latter, entrances lead into eleven side-chambers (left
Iv, V, Yr, VII, m, IS, right vm, 1x, xx, x), which are grouped
round the main chamber (Pl. I) behind room A. There are also a
number of secret passages (crypts), constructed in the hollow wall
of the temple on the EL, W., and 8. sides. These passages, which
are difficult of access, are in three stories, one above another (comp.
p. 96). Finally from the central hall 0, doors lead on the right
and left to the two stairs which ascend to the roof of the temple
(comp. pp. 91, 97). .

The Egyptians had special names for each haliand side-chamher,
for each corridor and staircase, for each door and window, in feet
for each part, great or small, of the more or less complicated temples.
In not a few cases these names explain the use of the different
rooms; but the only certain information " to the special nature of
the various apartments is obtained from the Inscriptions, which
are arranged as a kind of ornamental border above and below the
paintings on the wall, much like the borders seen sometimes on old-
feehiened wall-papers. These inscriptions, which are of the greatest
importance both for the history of architecture and for the eXplenaa
tion of the tempie-tsu1t, usually have their'eorttenta arranged in the
same order. The name of the king, with all his titles and oNeial
epithets, is flrst mentioned, followed by the statement that he built,
repaired, completed, or adorned such and such a room, or gueh and
