miseion-etation or at the house of the Italian cure). It contains
about 40,000 inhah., and is a. not unpleeeing specimen of an Egyp»
tian town. Between the station and the town we observe a. peculiar,
undershot st1tiyeh, 'or water-wheel driven by the water itself. The
very long covered bazaar contains nothing of special interest. The
traveller, even if unprovided with an introduction, should pay a
visit to the mudu', who will protect him from extortion in ease of
any iliff1im1ty with the owners of horses and others (comp p 34).

A broad arm of the Bahr Ytsut (p. 35) flows through the middle
of the town, The mosque of Knit Bey, on the N. side of the town,

now somewhat dilapidated, is the only interesting building of the
kind. It contains numerous antique columns, brought from the
ancient Areinoé, some of Which have shafts of polished marble with
Arabic inscriptions, and Corinthian and other capitals. Below the
mosque, on the bank of the Baht Yt1sut, are some remains of ancient
meeenry. No ancient inscriptions have been discovered here, but
the walls of some of the houses contain fragments which must
have belonged to ancient temples. At the W. end of the town the
Baht Yihmf radiates into numerous branches , which water the
eountry in - direetion. The dilapidated mosque of (,rolt situated
here forms a picturesque foreground.

To the N, of the town are the extensive ruins of grooodi1opo1isre.
Arsinoé, which has been entirely destroyed. The site is now called.
Irtrm Fdris. Many antiquities, both of the Roman and the Christian
period, have been found here, including numerous small terracotta
lamps and many thousand fragments of pepyri, intermixed with
pieces of parehment.~ Most of the papyri ere Greek (among them
fragments of Homer, Euripides, Thueydiileis, also of :1 Christian
eateeheticel boot), many are Arabic from the 2nd cent. of the Be.
gira down to 943 A. D.; and others are in Coptic, Pehlevi, j8agsam,
nidtra%rtsian, and Meroitic-EthioPian characters Several fragments
in hieratic end hieroglyphic characters, the oldest from the time of
Ramses III. (about 1300 B.CO, have also been discovered. As the
writings are for the most part tax-papers, it has been supposed that
they belonged to a tax off1oe of the town of croeodi'1oporiis, where
old pepyri also were used. A large number of the papyri found
here were acquired by Consul Travers for the Berlin Museum, and
even a larger number by Theod. Graf and Arehdnke'Reiner for the
Austrian Museum of Art and Industry at Vienna. The very exten-
sive cemetery of the town, with its picturesque tombstones, covers
part of the site of the ancient city; the highest of the mounds of
rubbish command a survey of the whole of the Fayihm At the N.
