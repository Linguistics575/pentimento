xpedition. We enter from the W.; the tomb soon bends at a right
angle towards the N., but finally resumes the direction from W. to E.
The three ftrat passages have either been destroyed or were never

tenancea are all well-formed and even gentle
and the colouring is unusually well-preaerved,

en-aten (p. 23), discouraged the worship of Am-
mon, which Amenhotep III. favoured, Some of
the pictures have been only sketched in, and the
field divided into squares. Portions of the Book
of the Dead are painted in
red upon stucco. The ear-
eophagus has been broken;
and beside it He human
bones (n0 skull), perhaps 'B-----

mummy was not gonna in the shaft of Dér el-hahri. Fragments of the
eofiin of Amenhotep 111., found in this tomb, are now in the museum at
Gizeh. The Astronomical.Ceiling-painting: in the chamber with the sar-
coyhagus are noteworthy] The chambers beyond this room have no in-
