The oasis was visited in 1818 by Drovetti, in 1819 by Bdmonatoae,
and in 1873 by Rohlfs, with Zittel, Jordan, and Aachereon, starting from
Farurah, The ascent amid the picturesque cliffs of the so-called Bab
el-oem/ia'", on the last mentioned route is very impressive.

The oasis has at present about 17,006 inhabitants. It is very rich in
date-Films and olive-trear, and produces wheat, barley, rice, dura, and
dukhn, though not tmffieient for its own consumption. Large ueaciae

Here are the shattered remains of a small temple in the t1rustraikrsptian
style, on which Wilkinson discovered the name Caesar. According to
Cailliaud‘a measurements the temple is 71% ft, long and 31 ft. broad. It
consisted of a veetibule, and a larger room with a smaller one behind it,
with three doors leading to three other chambers, the central one being
the adytum (Plan in Cailliaud’s Voyage it Mero'é II, XLII, 1). Inside the
girdle-wall of the temple is a scanty spring with a somewhat unpleasant
taste. We continue our journey in B steep gorge, which leads in 1/e hr.

Ddkhet. From this point the oasis of akhel etretches towards the W.,
interrupted twice by the desert, so as to form, strictly speaking, three
oases. The last of these, lying N. and 8., is the most considerable. After
passing two springs, Min Segah and Min Ansorah, we reach the considerable
village of Tanidah, with 600 inhab, largely employed in the production of
indigo. The manufacture is carried on in the open air under pBItwdeave
sheds, The dried leaves are placed in earthen pots with boiling water,
which is stirred with a stick until the dye-stuff has been aeperated from
the leaves. The blue liquid is then poured 'into shallow holes in the
earth, and the water allowed to evaporate. To the left of the route, near
the spring of ‘Atn ist-Birbeh, abunt 1 hr. beyond Tenidah, are the remains
