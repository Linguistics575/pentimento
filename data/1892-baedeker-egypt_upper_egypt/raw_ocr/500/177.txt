We may mention here in anticipation that the roof of the follow-
ing hypostyle hall was supported by a perfect forest of papyrus-bad
columns, through the midst of which a broad passage was marked
by ea1rr-eoiumms, closely resembling the detached pairs of columns
in the first court (comp. p. 120 At this point we flrgt obtain a
clear idea of the arrangement of this portion of the temple, and the
same remark applies also to all the rooms between it and the senc-
tuery. It should also be remembered that the number of those
privileged to follow and behold the procession gradually decreased
from room to room as the sanctuary was approtelmL,' Headed by
the king or chief priest, the crowd of priests, hearing the standards,
symbols, and images of the gods, passed through the doorway of the
first pylon into the peristyle court. The double row of calyx:-
capitals served at once to indicate their passage and to mark the
limits beyond which the pious spectators must not press. The
sacred procession rolled on slowly beneath the shade of the velarium
and entered the hypostyle hall through the second pylon. Many of
those who were permitted to enter the first court had there to quit
the procession and to take up their positions to the right and left
of the ca15rx-eolumnr, Others again were not permitted to advance
farther than the hypostyle, and so with each room until the sanc~
tuary was reached. To this day the clearly defined passage thither
may be traced, and it will be observed that at each successive stage
the place appointed for those who had to quit the procession is
smaller than the preceding.

1. The Small Temple of Seti IL Herenptah (P1. B), in the
N.E. angle of the court, to our left as we enter by the firat pylon.
This building, which has only recently been made partly accessible,
is built of grey sandstone, except beside the three doors, where a
reddish quartzose sandstone thus been used. The figure of the god
Seth has everywhere been erased from the name of the builder. Only
a small portion of the walls is entirely sculptured; and the re-
presentations that are still extent show that the temple was dedicated
to the Theban triad, Ammon, Math, and Khnnsu. In the chamber
entered by the W. (left) door appears the sacred beet of the goddess
Muth, to whom Seti Merenptah, accompanied by his son, oihyrg e.
libation, The richly dressed boy is called 'royal prinee' and 'heir
to the erown’. Adjacent is the tigurd of the helmeted Pharaoh,
presenting the image of the goddess of truth to Ammon and Khunsu.

2. The Temple of Ramses m. CPI, m, dedicated to Amman,
interrupting the S. wall of the peristyle court.

The great Harri: Papyrus, which is tshiefly concerned with the erection
and equipment of temples, details no fewer than six buildings and five
estates in the vicinity of Thebes, distinguished by the terms Hat (temple),

Pa (house), Menmenu (pasture), adding after each one of the two names
of the king and frequently also an additional name, such,» 'thr Niotory
