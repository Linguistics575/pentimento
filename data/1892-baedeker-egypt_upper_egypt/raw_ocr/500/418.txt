is understood a fertile and inhabited spot in the midst of the desert. The
oases owe their fertility to the springs which rise in them, frequently
thermal and containing iron, sulphur, or other mineral ingredients. The
most abundant trees in the oases are the date-palm, aeacias of various
kinds (Acacia Nilotica. or gunt~tree), apricots, and other fruit-treee; the
chief grain-erops ere wheat, barley, and rice, with a little dura (Sorghum
vulgare) and dukhn (Penicillaria sptcata); and indigo, tobacco, and cotton
are also grown (see V01. L, pp. 63 seq.).

Seven oases are mentioned in the Ptolemaic inscriptions in the temple

at Edfu. According to Diimiehen the firat of these, wm Kenem, corre-

sponds to the oasis of ty1urhiirgeh, the second, ces Zuzes, to Dakhel,

A aim ler arrangement, recognized as early as utmes TIL, divides them
into orthern and Southern Gases, the ilrgt signifying probably Eahrtyeh,

em Oasis was also called the sSmalt Oasis (lun, mxpé), and frequently
also El-wdh elnbehnesah, because the route to it diverged at Behnexah on the
Nile. Most travellers who wish to see an oasis will be aatished with a.
visit to Khhrgeh and perhaps also to Dtskhel, for the visit to Stwah in~
valves a long and fatiguing journey. The latter, however, is also de-
scribed below on account of its great historical interest.

For a. visit to the oases a. caravan of riding and tsumpter-eamehs is
necessary. Riding Camels or drnmedaries travel about 28 M. in 12 hrs.,
0r considerably more if pressed (c0mp. p. 75); ordinary camels only about
19 miles. The camels should be divided into convenient. groups, and the
traveller should make sure that he has a comfortable saddle for his ride
of eight days or more. A tent, a generous supply of tinned provisions,
and water must also be provided. Water may be carried either in easka
(hermit), leather skins (which, however, impart a disagreeable flavour to
their contents after a day or two), or still better in iron 4aoif'era lined
with enamel (saftha). The services of a trustworthy ,sarturan-leader should
be secured by application to a consular agent or other reliable authority,
and guns, powder and shot, and a supply of money in small coins and
Maria. Theresa thelere should be provided. The traveller should avoid
displaying large sums of money before the Arabs, and he should be strict
in maintaining the discipline of the caravan.
