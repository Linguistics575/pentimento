beautiful horses. The slaughter which he causes is immense, and,
so far as the vividness 0f the representation goes, may wellhe com-
pared with the similar subjects at Karnak and the 1tamssscum,
though it is inferior in point of style.

Higher up is an inscription from the 11th year of the king; and here
also the long rows of hieroglyphies are more concerned with extolling
the king then with relating events. The war is once more against the
western peoples, the Libyane, Maxyane (Nasrhuuasha), etc. The leaders of
the foe are the Libyan prince Kapur and his son Mishashar. The op-
ponente of Pharaoh were (according to the inscription on the N, Pylon)
utterly routed, and lost miserably both property and life, 'while' the
whole earth rejoiced as it beheld the heroism of King Ramses IIE' The
world bowed before the king, who is compared to Baal, who punishes
the impious. The conquered are compared to a floelr of goats attacked
by anion, The endless pictorial laudations of the victor are positively
wearieome, while the representations of the defeat impotence, and over-
throw of the con uered are almost equally 'iiiafi'iiUi'it Finally the king
harenguee the lea era of his foot-SOIdiers and ehariotetsrs, not forgetting
to celebrate in swelling worde the deeds that he himself has done. The
number of prisoners and slain (the latter with their hands, etc., cut oir)
is recorded. One of the lists accompanying the inscription includes one
prince of the Maehauaeha, 5 superior oMetsws, 1205 common soldiers, 152
inferior of(hasrs, 131 young men, 1494 in all,, A130 342 women, 66 young
women, 151 girls, M8 in all. These figures give a total of 2052 persons.
Besides these 2176 Mashauaehe. were slain by the kin in their ranks.
The total loss of the enemy was thue not more than 4 persona. The
number of captured swords, bows, chariots, ete., corresponds: 115 large
swords, 124 smaller, 603 bows, ete. _

Another series occupies the baek-wa11 of the eolonnade 0n the right
(NO side of the court, supported by seven piuars with the Osiris-figures
of the king. The uppermost row contains traerifieial scenes. The firgh of
these depiete the king, who has aiighted from his chariot, shooting his arrows
against a hostile fortress occupied by warriors (the town Amara, recalling
the Amorites). In the next scene the king drags three rows of prisoners
behind his chariot. He is congratulated by the grendeee. Finally he
presents the captives to Amulet}, Math, and Khunsu. _

The inscriptions and sculptures on the Second Pylon (Pl. E),
enclosing the rear of the court, are still more interesting. To the
left are Ammon Ra and Math, the great queen of heaven, to whom
Pharaoh, wearing a. richly decorated crown, leads three rows of
captives chained together. The two upper rows have distinctly
European features, and wear embroidered aprons and low helmets.
Over the first row no name appears, but according to the inscription
before Pharaoh, they are Shakalsha, i.e. probably Sicilians. The
captives in the second row are called Tanauna or Danauna, a name
in which we are probably correct in recognizing the 'Danai', or
Hellenes of the Trojan era. The third row, in which the individual
figures resemble those of the other two, is accompanied by the
following inscription: 'Provide breath for our nostrils, 0 king, son
of Ammon, say the fees from Palasata', In these Pulasata we must
recognize the Philistines, new and no contemptihle fees of Egypt.

0n the Right Wing of the second pylon is another long in-
scription devoted to the deeds of the king in the 8th year of his reign,

Here also facts are obscured by empty titles and elaborate trifles,
recited in praise of the king. ‘His form, hisrlimbe‘, mm; the fifth line,
'have been weighed in the balances of Baal; he come
