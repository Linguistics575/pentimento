the steamboat terminus for the lower Nile, with a post and telegraph
offlee, lies on the E, bank, partly on the plain and partly on a. hill,
in N . lat, 240 ly 30". The fertile strip here is narrow, but supports
numerous date-palms, the fruit of which still enjoys a high repu-
tation. The native inhabitants have increased under the British
occupation to about 10,000; but that number is only a fraction of
its former population, when according to Arabian authors, no less
than 20,000 died of the plague at one time, Some of the houses
are elegant, bat the mosques do not repay a visit. The howling
dervishes have a house here in whiph they meet on Fridays for

Si‘ldzin and Ahyssinie, brought hither on camels, and shipped north-
wards by the Nile to Keneh, Astsitlt, or Cairo. Among the chief Nt-
ports are ostrich feathers, ivory, india-rubtrar, senna, tamerinds,
wax, skins, horns, and dried dates. The steamers and dhahahiyehs
are here boarded by negroes, Nubians, and handsome Beduins,
with artistically dressed curly hair, who offer for sale ostrich feathers
and fans, silver rings and armlete, ivory hoops, weapons from Gen-
tral Africa, small monkeys, amulets, beautiful basket-work, and
aprons of leather fringe, the costume of the women of the SMU,
which they oddly call Wadama Nubia'. Grey and black ostrich
feathers are comparatively cheap (8 piastres === 2fr, each)“, larger
and perfect white feathers cost i0-20 fr, apiece and upward, Truv-
ellers who desire to buy in quantity should betake themselves to
one of the wholesale dealers in, the town. The bazaar is like the
bazaars of all Nile towns, but is distinguished for its excellent local
pottery of great beauty of form. Candles, porter, lie, and even
tolerable Dutch cigars may be obtained at a Turkish ‘bakkal’. --
Copper money is, curiously enough, accepted very unwillingly in

beforehand with silver piastres.
