302 LOWER NUBIA. History.

of the petty Egyptian kings by Peammetikh L (66d-6ioy In his
reign, according to the somewhat incredible story of Herodotus (II,
30), 240,000 soldiers, discontented with the severity of their service,
emigrated to Ethiopia, where they settled near Mercia“ under the
name of Autemoles or Semhritee, and did much to rtsf1nty the men-
ners of the Ethiopians. Peammetikh II. undertook an expedition
against the Ethiopian: (Herod. II, 160), to "which references are
made in Greek and Phoenician inscriptions in the temple of Atm-
Simhel (p 334). The eteles at Berhel mention two other Ethiopian
kings, Iror-ei-atel' end Naatosmm, whose reigns cannot be 106th-
rately dated, The former reigned for forty years, waned against the
Rehrem and Madia, African tribes of Duttr and Abyssinian, and
erected temples; of the letter we learn that he was solemnly crowned
in the temple of Nepete.

The early royal residence Nepeta now began to decay, and
Berna (Meroii) near Begerewiyeh became the capital of the Etihio-
pians. From Diodoms (III, 6) we learn that under Ptolemy Phile-
delphus a king of the name of Ergamms shook himself free of the
'infiuamse of the priests and caused them to be massacred in the
golden temple. This can hardly be the same Ergemenee whom we
meet at Dekkeh (p. 316), for the letter does not seem to have
flourished until the time of the Roman emperors. During the Ro-
man period, an Ethiopian invasion of the Thabiid led to the cam-
paign of Petronius (25 13.0.), in which Napeta was destroyed. Queen
Candace made peace with the Roman general (Strebo XVII, 54).

Towards the close of the 3rd cent. Al). the country above Philaa
was devastated by the Blemmyes, a ilertMy Nubien tribe dwelling
between the Nile and the Red See, who carried their depredetions
even into the Roman territory beyond Aesuen. To restrain them
the emperor Diocletian summoned the tribe of the Nobadcs from
the oasis of eluKhirgeh (p, 348) to the Nile valley, and settled them
in the district from Elephantine upwards, while the temples of
Philm were assigned as common sanctuaries to them and to the
Blemmyes. In spite of the aid of the Nobadee, the the towns of
the Commititium Romanum (Prime, Phamieon, Khiris, Tephie,
and Talmis) fell into the hands of the barbarians, who made Telmie
(Kelabeheh, see p. 307) their capital. In the 4th and 5th cent.
they ravaged the Thebe’id, so that in 451“A.D. Maximinus, the
general of the emperor Marcian, was forced to conclude a peace on
unfavourable terms for 100 years, which, however, only lasted until
the death of the general. Between 530 and 550 the Nobedee were
converted to Christianity; and Silica, one of their kings, defeated
the Blemmyes. His victory is recorded in a Greek inscription
found in the temple of Kalabeheh (p. 308). Christianity gredu-n
ally invaded the temples of Nubia; and the Nobed king Eitpano-
mas and Bishop Theodorus (p. 283) of Phila, exterminated pa-
ganiem. But not long afterwards Ethiopia, like Egypt, fell into
