232 Route 22. ESNEH. From Thebes

either near the former Mudtrtrsh (nokrernomyd to Keneh), beside
whieh are some ancient riparian constructions dating from the Ro-,
man imperial times, or near the post-is, a. little to the N., where
the steamers lie. The chief object of interest is the Temple; and if
time permit the garden of the Khedive to the N, of the town o, 235)
and the old Ceptie church (p. 235) may also be visited. The former
lies 10-i5 min. from the lending-plaee (see above), and is reached
by passing through part of the town. The old templeusite is at pre-
sentzused by the Excise Office for storing the grain, beans, and
other tribute paid in kind, but travellers will have no ir1ftiei1lty in
inducing one of the br-Standee to fetch the keeper who will unlock
the deer. Cards empowering a visit to the antiquities must not be
forgotten (see p. xiv).

The eowalled Temple is in reality only A Hypoatyle, which evidently
from its size must have belonged to an unusually large sanctuary. The
ground-level of the town has been raised by accumulations of rubbish etc.
to the height of the capitals of the columns, BO that travellers demand
by steps into the interior of the building. Above the rest of the temple
now pass streets, the removal of which would probably bring to the light
of day many monuments of antiquity, The savante of the French Expe~
dition were profoundly impressed by the sight of this huge eolonnaded
hall; and as the traveller standing in front of the steps leading to it,
gazes down into the mysterious twilight of the ancient sanctuary, he cam
not but be struck by the air of solemnity that pervades it.

The remarkable I""Ilypoetyle of Eeneh is built throughout of
excellent sandstone, and remains in perfect preservation with the
exception of the lower part of the rear wall, which has been some-
what corroded by the saline exudations of the soil. The noble hall
is kept clean by government. The roof is borne by 24 columns
(in f) rows), the first six of which are connected by balwstraiiass; and
a dim light penetrates to the remotest corner of the hall between
the columns. The facade is 120 ft. wide and almost 50 ft. high; the
rectangular hall is NW, ft. deep and 108 ft, broad, Each column
is 37 ft. high and 173/4 ft. in circumference. The intqmtoltun-
niation is 11/2 times the diameter of the columns, except in the
central passage, where it is nearly 3 times the diameter. Upon the
somewhat lofty ehaci of the columns rests a massive tsrehitrave,
which supports rooting-tslabs, 22-26 ft. long and 6% ft. wide. It hue
been calculated that about 110,000 cubic feet of sandstone have
been used for this one hall alone. The enormous wall-es, the
entire ceiling, the shafts, the ante (on the facade), and the archb-
trave are covered to the last inch with inscriptions. Though these
last fall short of the dignity of style Which claims admiration in the
earlier works of Egyptian art, yet they display that remarkable care
in the representation of details and that elaborate variety of form
which at once distinguishes the inscriptions of the time of the
Ptolemiee and ot the Romans, and renders their interpretation more
ilitmnut,

The temple of Esneh was founded not later than the 18th Dyn.
under Tutmes 111., according to one of the inscriptions; and prob-
