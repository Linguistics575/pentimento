elsewhere. On the left wall the paintings representing the punish-
ment of enemies and evil-doers are particularly interesting. In the

'The Harper's Tomb', owes its existence to the lavish builder of
Medinet Habu (p. 172). Inferior in size only to No. 17 and No. 14,

Festival. Oxen are being slaughtered, their flesh out in pieces, and

wields a ladle. A second group attends to the wine. All kinds of
eatebles, cakes, and implements are at hand, and the cooks are busy.
Two dancers enliven the scene with their performances. In side-
