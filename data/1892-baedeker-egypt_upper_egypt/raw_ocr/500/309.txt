turies has heaped itself around the temple; and later dwellings
have been erected on the top of earlier ones. This alone can explain
how the temple is now at a. much lower level then the surrounding
village.

The building presented a very different appearance only thirty years
ago, Arab houses stood upon the temple itself and were built against
its walls. The interior was Nled with rubbish almost up to the capitals
of the columns, and the outside was equally deeply huried. A picture of
the edifice as it then was may be seen in plates 49 and 55 in the ftrat
volume of the Antiquités in the Description de I'Egypte. In the beginning
of the sixties, however, the entire temple was laid bare by Mariette under
the auspices of the Khedive, end the buildings clustering upon and around
it were removed. Now the temple of Edfu is seen in wonderful, almost
perfect preservation, exceeding that of any other Egyptian temple or even
of any antique building in the world, in spite of the 2000 years that
have passed over it. Frem top to bottom it is covered with represen-
tations and remarkableinscriptions, the interpretation of which was
reserved for the present century, so rich hr discoveries of every kind.

The “Temple of Edfu is superior to the temple at Denderah in
the much greater distinctness of its sculptured reliefs and inscrip-
tions, due probably to the use of better sandstone than that of
Denderah which contains more lime. It is also much more complete,
for in addition to chambers corresponding to those found at Den-
derah, there are at Edfu a passage running round the temple and
a lofty wall enclosing the latter, besides a spacious fore-eourt and
two massive pylons. (Comp. the accompanying Plan with that of
Denderah at p. 80.)

The inscriptions in the temple at Edfu have been ublished in
Diimiehen's Aliiitryptisclur Tempeh’nschriften (113 plates; 18 7), the geo-
graphical inscriptions in his Recueil de monuments égyptiens and in J. de
Itouge's Edfu, from notes by his father E. de Rougé (18e0). The me
named work, however, has many errors. The important Buildera‘ Irv-
scrtpls‘om are to be found in the Agypthehe geiuehrift for 1870~71-73-75,

The modern Arabic name of the village of Edfu is derived from

the Coptic arrhm , formed in its turn from the old-Egyptian
aTebu, the name given in the inscriptions to the metrepolis

of the second district of Upper Egypt. This district, named Tes-
Hor, zlc. the district of the raising of Horus,+ the Apollinopolitee
of Greek coins, was bounded on the S. by the Names Nubia, the
capital of which was Etephantine, and on the N. by Iurtppoliteor,
the capital of which was Sent, the modern Esneh. In the great war
of the gods waged by Ra-Helios end his companions against the
evil Seth-Typhon and his allied demons, the principal champion is
