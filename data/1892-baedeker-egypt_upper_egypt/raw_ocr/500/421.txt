induces fevers. These marshes faetrkhah) add largely to the ditheunr

oasis contains about 300,000 due-palms, and about 3000 tons (9000 camel-
loads) of dates are annually exported to North Egypt by the Beduin tribe
of the Waled-JAH. The olive tree also floarighag here, erangea end ltr.

cots, peaches, plums, and a. kind of dwarf apple. -- Live stock is not
numerous, owing to a. dangerous fly, about as large as a bee, whose sting
is fatal to cattle and camels. Wild pigeons abound. - Salt is procured

by evaporation in am almost pure state. Sal ammoniae is prepared by
trrtifieiai distillation from eamela' dung, Minutoli estimated the number
of the inhabitants at 8000, Rohlfe at 5600. The two principal tribes, the
Lifayah and the Rharbyia, both of which include numerous sub-tribes, are
hostile to each other, - The annual tribute to the Egyptian government
is 10,000 Maria Theresa thalere, equal to about 2000t, An Egyptian g0-

The mine now to be found are very aeantyt The trigle-walled castle
described by Dioderus (see p. M5) appears to be identifle with the loftily
situated Akermi, also called Sharkiyeh. An early Egyptian structure,
discovered here in 1853 under eome modern houses by the Scottish
traveller James Hamilton, was easily recognized as the fore-court and
chamber of a temple or palace. The interior walls were covered with
hieroglyphics, but 80 blackened. with smoke that the kings'' eertouehea
could not be recognized. In the thickness of the wall was a narrow
passage, 6 ft. long and 2 ft. wide. In an adjoining street was a colossal
Egyptian gate. Rohzfa eonfirmed this discovery in 1869. Paasing along a
narrow, winding passage, he observed a building with foundation-walls
of hewn stones, and to the W. of it he came upon the large ediiiee, the
outer walls of which are vieihle from outside the village, while the
inner wall extends to the great square of Akermi. A rough passage
admits to a foreueonrt, 15 ft. long and 10 ft. broad. Two large Egyptian
gateways (181/2 ft,, high) lead to the holy of holiest, which is: entirely otr,
atmcted by houses; the gateways can be passed only through the houses.

communicated with the great well of Akermi.

About 300 paces to the S. of Akermi lie the ruins of Umm eLBéddh
(white mother), facing the town and lying from N, to S. In the time of
Ceilliaud and Minutoli the ruins consisted of the left wing of the gate-
way and a covered portion behind, The former, which has now dia-
appeared, contained the representation of a king offering to the rem’s-
headed Ammon and his female companion. The other portion, which
still remains, in ih1/2 ft. long (at places only i0% ft.) and about 25 ft.
high, with a passage 161/2 ft. wide. On the right and left sides are pro-
cessions of gods in several rows, with the above-mentioned mm‘s-heeded
Amman as the chief deity, Above these gods are numerous vertical lines
