steamer if there is a berth free. After that, however, the ticket he--
comes invalid, without any recourse against Messrs. Cook.

In 1889-90 Messrs. Cook also organized a MAIL Smmn Snnvwn
between Assitst, the railway terminus, and Assuin (4 days up,
3 days down), starting from Asisitt, on Wed. and Sat. mornings in
connection with the day-trains leaving Btht# ed-Dakrfir on Tues.
and Wid. mernings; and returning from Agauttn on Mon. and Thurs.
afternoons in connection with the train leaving Ased1t for Bt1ltrb
ei1aoDakrur on Wid, and Mon. evenings. The names of the mail-
steamera are Cleopatra , Nefertari , Amenartas, and Hatasoo. In
1891 a maibat;agmer also sailed every Sat. direct from Cairo vii
Aiststiyt, to Aswan, in some respects to be preferred to the others.
This steamer touches at Benihasan (visit to the tombs), reaches
Agsiilt on Tues. evening, and proceeds thence on Wed. morning (as
above). The fare from Cairo is 23t, to Astmtn and back (14 days,
or 18 days if the direct steamer from Cairo be taken) and 20t, to
Lnxox- and back (il days), including lst cl. fare from Cairo to
Astsiiit, transfer of baggage at Atyisiiit, provisions on board the
steamers, and 3-4 days' hotel accommodation at Luxor. Incidental
expenses for sight-seeing, donkeys, guides, etc. are not included in
these fares. About 11/2 day is spent at Aswan, and on the return”
voyage 3 hrs. are spent at Edfu and 2% hrs. at 1pmeh-1hsnderah.
Elim Ombo, Eeneh, and Luxor are night-stations, and travellers who
desire to visit the temples at these places must do so by torch-light.
Passengers may also spend additional time at any of the stations en
route continuing their journey by later steamers, and paying the
fare from stage to stage (to Luxor 2.94£.E. , to Aswan 51.EO together
with 103. per day for food on board the steamers. These mail-
steamers enable travellers to visit the chief points in Upper Egypt
at a less expenditure of time and money than the tourist steamers.
No one should omit the voyage to Assutm, while 8alrlp)rah may be
visited from Cairo. The life on board these vessels is often lively;
and the scenes at the numerous landing-placee are frequently
highly entertaining. The mail-ateamers touch at the following
stations: Abutfg, Nekheleh, Scdfch, Temeh, Meshteh, Tahyah, Mara-
ghah, &umdaua, Sohdg, Akluntm, Mewhtyth , Girgeh, Bclianeh,
