xx NILE JOURNEY.

The chartering of a. private dhahabiyeh is much cheaper though
much more troublesome. The first step is to engage a Dragoman,
not without a careful enquiry as to his record at the consulate and
from the hotei-kssperss, and an examination of the testimonials from
previous travellers. There are about 90 dragomans in Cairo, all
more or less intelligent and able, but scarcely a half of the number
are trustworthy. Most of them speak English or French, and a few
speak Italian.

The following are well spoken of: Hanan Speke, Ahmed Ramadan,
Ibrahim Salem, Ahmed Abderraltim (owner of the Manhattan, 1). xix), Hasan
Bibam, Salim Sadjar, Btthas' Avad, Abdullah Abdelkhatik (all these Egyp-
tians); Saleh (a Nubian); Michael Gan, Anton Sapienza (Maltese); Mamdr,
Lem": Mansar, Daeghis Facial, Elias Tukany, and Elia; Abushdya (Syrians).
It cannot be too strongly impressed upon the traveller that It is essantial
for him to show from the very beginning that he is and intends to re-
main the master. Even the best dragemans are inclined to patronize their
clients, a tendency which must at once be quashed.

The next step is to select a suitable dhahabiyeh assisted by the
dragoman. A contract is then made with the dragoman, either en"
trusting him with the entire preparations, or assigning to him only
the duty of engaging and paying the rtfis and crew, while the traw.
eller retains the commissariet department in his own hands. The
resets " steersman is a most important functionary upon whose skill
daring the often stormy passage the safety of the vessel depends.
The crew number from 8 to 12 according to the size of the dhaha-
biyeh. The vessel is either hired by the day (for 2 pers. 5-65., 3
or 4pers. frm.) or chartered for the whole return-voyage to Aissutn
(for 2 pers. 300-350£., 3 or 4 pets. 350-40(V), In the former case
the dragoman will try to travel as slowly as possible to protraet his
engagement; in the latter case he will press on, so as to save
boat-hire and board. The latter arrangement is preferable, but the
right of halting for 15-20 days in the course of the journey should
carefully he stipulated for. The dragoman must also provide don-
keys and camels for the excursions. Farther details are indicated
in the following i1raft-eontraots, in which it is believed that nothing
of importance has been overlooked. The contract must he signed at
the traveller’s consulate, either with the dragoman alone if he has
undertaken the whole of the arrangements, or with the dragoman
and re'is, when the traveller has hired the dh ahabtyeh and pays board
to the dragoman.
