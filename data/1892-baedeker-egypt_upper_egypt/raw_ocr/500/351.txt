Arabian Nights ends as follows: 'So they lived in the bosom of happiness

tender friendship must take the place of passion t

It seems as though this legend had arisen on Egypt soil, and as
though it contained some echoes of the ancient mythology of Phila,
c.g.. the search of Isis for her beloved Osiris and the disposal of the
goddess on an island in the Nile. It is even more remarkable that
Anes elw-Wogud reached the island on a crocodile and that on the
W. side of the temple of Isis is a relief (p. 294) representing the
mummy of Osiris borne by a crocodile.

The rocky island of Bigeh, opposite Phiiaa, seems to have been
an even earlier pilgrim-resort than the latter; yet there was probably

The principal temple, like the island itself, was sacred to Isis,
whose priests resided here down to comparatively late times as a
learned college. As one of the graves of Osiris was situated here,
it early became a pilgrimage resort for the Egyptians, one of whose
solemn oaths also was by the Osiris of Phila, When the cult of
Isis as well as that of Serepis became known to the Hellenes and
afterwards to the Romans, many Greek and Italian pilgrims fioeked
to the shrine of the mysterious, benign, and healing goddess, Even
under Ptolemy Physkon the priests were compelled to petition the
king to check the superabundant stream of pilgrims, who consumed
the temple-stores and threatened to reduce the priests to the neces»
sity of withholding from the gods their bounden offerings (comp.
p. 284). On all the walls and columns of the temple are inscrip-
