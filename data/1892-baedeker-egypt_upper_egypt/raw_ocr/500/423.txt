the B. of Widi Ntatrtht (comp. the Map at the beginning of Vol, IO are
four Coptic Honuteries, a visit to which is interesting. The monasteries
owe their origin to Macarim of Alexandria (d. 394), a hermit who iirat
retired to the Theben desert in 336, and afterwards, about 373, took up
his abode in a lonely cell in this spot. He was the founder of an order
that won numerous disciples. The monks feet all the year round, except
on Sundays and between Easter and Whitgunt'ide, 2tttttrws mentions fifty
monasteries of asceties, who numbered 5000 in all. In the year 800 the
ruined monastery of St. Macariuc was repaired and fortified by Banutim,
patriarch of Alexandria. The next most interesting monastery is that of
Syriani, built by a saint named Hanna: or Johannes the dwarf. It has
8040 monks and 3 churches. Curzon and afterwards Tattam and Pasha,
who visited the monastery twice, here found most valuable collections
of Syrian MSS., acquired between 1840 and 1850, These 19138., in 371
vols, of which the oldest are one by Emebim of Edema (411 AD.) and
twelve of the 6th cent, included the Theophany and other writings of
Eusebius of Caesarea, the Recognition“ of Clemens, a treatise against the
Manichmans by Tim: of Basra, etc. This monastery contains also an
Abyssinian college with a litsrarr--There is little chance of discovering
any more valuable M38. here, as all except those required for the religious
aergicea have been vtramsferred to the library of the Captie patriarch
at eiro.

A visit to the remaining monasteries, of Harm; (Coptic liturgical
MM.) and Amba Biskhat, with three small churches, scarcely reimys the
trouble, and is not recommended on account of the vermin. -- nteretrt-
ing accounts of these and other monasteries in the Levant are con-
tained in R. thtrronU Visits to the Monasteries in the Levant (London,
1849), and in Quatremére‘s Mémoires Géographiquea, Vol. I. pp. NU seq.
(Paris, 1811).

II. The Gases of Bahriyeh and Farhfrah.

The visit to the oasis of Bahrtyeh (the Northern Oasis), called by
Strabn hsdupa, 'the Second”, and by Ptolemy smegma, 'the Small Oasia',
is of interest only to the naturalist, for its antiquities are few and un-
important. The latter include a small Roman triumphs] arch (Cai11iaud,
Meme, IL P1. 39, 40, 42) and a stele of the reign of Tutmes 111., besides
the scanty remains of a temple at Bawttt (Ascherson).

Cow-land of antiquity (temple of Edfu), es the latter is described as to the
NAV, of Kenem, the great oasis, is of importance, merely as an inter-
mediate station between the oases of Siwah and Diikhel, or the oases of
Bahriyeh and Diikhel. It contains no antiquities, but Some catacombs
in a cliff to the W. suggest that there was at one time a. Christian
settlement here. The oasis which has only 320 inheb., has been since
1860 entirely in the hands of the 8entisi, a rigid Mohammedan sect, founded
by Mohammad Swan of Algiers (Vol. L, p. B7). The people are suspicious
of and hostile to strangere. The chief village is BdraMb, two days' journey
to the W. of Siwah.
