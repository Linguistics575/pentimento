186 Route M, THEBES. West Bank:

line inscriptions which meet in the middle, dating from the time of Tat-
mes III. In front of the second door occurs a mention of the restoration
of the building by Horemheh (18th Dyno, within the eella Seti I. is
named as a reatorer; and in another place the second year of Merenptah I.
is mentioned. The name of Ramses III. also occurs in the rooms behind.
Inside the cella we ehould note the tree on which the god Amman is
writing the name of Seti I. In the adioining building on the N., the roof
of which includes remains of the old building of Ramses IL, not only is
the prieat-king Pinozem, son of Piankhi, of the 21st Dyn. represented, but
also Hakerie of the 29th Dynasty. Ptolemy Euergetes 11. occurs in the
upper inscription running round the cella.

The building, though small, is distinguished by its harmonious
forms. About 65 paces to the HE. is the well-known Fresh Water
Spring, a pool to which a subterranean passage leads. It is a re-
markable Get that the freshness of the water remains entirely tur-
affected by the saline exai1ati'ons from the ground, even in the nfy-
crepolis at Thebes.

To the S. of the temples of Medinet Hahn are traces of a Sacred
Luke of considerable extent, formerly taken for a hippodrome. At
its N.W. angle is a small temple, now known as Kaer ctu‘Agaz,
erected by Ptolemy Euergetes II. to his ancestors. It consists of
a wide vestibule and three rooms, one behind another. Still farther
to the 8., at the S.W. angle of the former lake, stood a small 8ane-
tuary dating from the Roman period. It was erected by Hadrian
and Antoninus Pius, while the ruined pylon bears the names of
vespasian, Domitian, and Otho, the last of exceedingly rare occur-
renee owing to the emperor's short reign (69 A.D.). The temple
consists of a eella surrounded by apartments. A staircase leads to
the roof from a space to the extreme left of the entrance The in-.
seriptions announce that the sanctuary no longer belongs to the
Diespolitan district, but to the district of Hermonthis; and it was
specially dedicated to the Isis of the W. mountain of Hermonthis.
-- Grebeut discovered in 1889 in the vicinity the remains of in Pa-
lace of Amcnhotep III. and his consort Tit,

le, Tombs of the Queens.

The Tomb: of the Queen: are in every way less important than those
of the Kings in Btbin ei-NaN, which should in any case he seem, and
a visit to the former, for which at least 11/4 hr. is necessary, renders it
almost impossible to complete the first day's programme on the West
Bank, Those who, however, decide to visit them ehnuld proceed thither
direct from Medinet Hahn, and visit Dér el-Medfneh on the way back.
From Medinet Hahn to the Tombs 1/s hr.

The road from Madinat-Haba to the Tombs of the Queens crosses
the desert to the W., and passes through a mountain valley with
bare and lofty sides of limestone, pieturasqutsly formed and carved
with inscriptions of various lengths. The latter contain prayers to
the gods ot the regions of the dead, and date from the 19th and
20th Dynasties. The Tombs of the Queens belong to the same
period, except a few which are of the 18th Dyn ty that
