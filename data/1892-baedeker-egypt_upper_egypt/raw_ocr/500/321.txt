the Egyptian government. They also have a. language of their own.
Their domain extends to the Red Sea. It is therefore necessary before
beginning this desert-expedition (11/2 day; camel and tent necessary) to
secure the protection of the shékh of the 'AUbdeh. -- The route leads through
a sandstone region, with many small seya1-aeae'ias. Peseirliwg a (h hrs.)
Well and then the Tomb of a saint, we reach the (3 hrs.) in: Station
on the desert-route, eonsisttng of two rectangular spaces 45-50 ft. long
surrounded by walls. The Second Station, on the route leading to the
Red Sea (comp. R. 8, p. 78), is 6 hrs. farther on. Near it lies the temple,
beautifully situated at the foot of an 'isolated hill. The road to gage:-

The Temple was discovered in 1816 by Gailliaud, on his flrtst Journey
to the mines of Mt. Zabdrah, where he found old emerald-miuea instead
of the sulphur that he expected. It is about 40 ft. long, and the front
portion is occupied by a VESTIBULE, about 22 ft. wide, with 4 columns.
of which the first pair form the entrance. The representation here
are familiar to us from other Egyptian temples. King Set: I. appears
before Ammon-Ra, who hands to him the sword of victory. 'He smites
the princes of the miserable Kush’ (Ethic ia). Behind Amman are 10
names of fettered tribes. Ammon speaks: Receive the sword, Oh King,
lord of the pee les, to smite down the princes of Kush and to out off their
heads. Fear 0 thee penetrates their limbs like Sekhet in her wrath.' On
the other well the king appears before Herbalist (glut), once more smiting
his foes, - At the trear-wall of this vestibule and in two niches to the
right and left of the entrance to the next hall are Osiris Statues. The next
HALL, about 161/2 ft. square, is, like the heck-wall of the preceding, entirely
hewn out of the rock. It contains 4 pillars. At the back are three niches
each with a triad of gods; in the centre is Ramenma (Seti IO himself.
The interesting Inscriptions here record, among other things, that the king
came hither in the 9th year of his reign on his way to the gold-mines,
accompanied by a. large retinue and by architects, and caused wells to he
sunk, etc. -- On an adjoining rock are three stelee. On one of these is
the goddess Ami: on horseback, with a shield in her left hand; the second
is dedicated to the ofheiai entrusted by Seti with the sinking of the well;
and on the third is the kneeling ftgare of Ani, kinghs son of Kush and
commander of the Mazai (police). Higher up on the rock are fuures
of gazelies, Greek tP.,filfit, and the prwnomen of Amenhotep III. preceded
by the statement: made by prince Mermee‘.

Farther along the E, bank (12 M. from Edfu), on the mountain-
slopes approaching close to the river near the hill cs-Scrag, are the
picturesque remains of an ancient Arab fortress with a mosque.
This is sometimes 1i1entifiisd with the ancient Thmuia, which,
however, more probably lay farther to the S.

Near the village of el-Ebsh beside the Gcbcl Abu Shegah, on the
W. bank, a great number of inscriptions and drawings of very
various dates have been found scratched on the rocks.

The oldest King’s Name met with ia that of an Usertesen (12th Dyn.),
but most of the devices are of a very much later date. Greek names
are not wanting, and most of the inscriptions appear to have been carved
by masons who worked in the large quarries, which are still to be found
