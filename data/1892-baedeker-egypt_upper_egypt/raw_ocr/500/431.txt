The second room is entered by a narrow door, on which are stMgrifieial
scenes Jstsfore the rBm'srhsai1 Ammon and other deities. The name of

room is only half as long as the preceding and is destitute of all ornament
except on the central door leading to the Sanctum'y. Remelé‘s memre~

the height at 10 ft. The photographs taken by him indicate that the

most of the blocks have fallen. The back~wall of the calla is divided
in halves, each containing 3 fields, In all 6 field, there appear: an
