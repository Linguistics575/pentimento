of hewn stone went forth, out of the-monntaih, mpre hnutterahly grand
to witness than all things else. "Traeysportshi,p,ii, equigiped vyith all magni-
fietmee, the choicest of my young men and aoldwrs. . y 0211116an followed
me arrayed in feetal ornaments, and the inhabitants of my home, sing-
ing songs of praise, celebrated my arrival in the fortress of this town’.

The other representations in this t'omh off'er nothing unusual. Much
has been destroyed and defaced, principally by the monks, who tried to
aanctify the pagan Wark and drive'the devil from it by marking it with
the sign of the cross. T . ' ' 1 _ [ ' '

Below this tomb is another "of the 12th Dynasty, belonging according
to the inscriptions to the royal eha.P1oiTAa'T,Ney: _ ..

F On the'W.’ batik, 1 M. from the Nile, vie Malawi el-‘Aris’h (tail,
stat, p. 1), , small town with 10,000 inhab., where fowls, eggs,
etc., may be procured cheaply (large market on Sun.). In the vi-
cinity are many large palms and also eugar~plantations._ Farther
on, on them. bank, at the foot of thehill of the same name (p, 20),
lies Bh6kh-aa'til, with tombs of the old empire, including those of
priests of Khufu, Userkaf, and Pepi. t . _

We next reach the ruins of et-Tell ~end the grottoes pf Tell 31..
Amarnah, two very interesting points o.n the E, bank, at-whieh the
'fourweeke' steamer stops for a few hours on its return-j'purney,
The best plan is to disembark at et-Tell, visit the remains of the
old town, return to the dhahabiyeh, and sail toHagg tl-4,rand'te, where
donkeys for the visit to the grottbes are more easily obtained than
at et-Tell. We pass to the right of the village of tt-Teu, 1/411
from the river, and at the point where the cultivated land ends we
tum due 8. (to the right), After passing the ruins of a large build-
ing (probablyatemple), now consisting of the foundations only and
nearly indistinguishable, we turn to the right from the path to vi-
sit the numerous relies of public and private buildings of all kinds.
There are larger and finer ruined temples in other parts of Egypt,
but nowhere else do we obtain so excellent an idea of the actual
dwelling-places of the citizens. It looks as if the hand of deity had
bodily removed this large town (more than 1 M. long from N. to so
from the surface of the earth, leaving nothing but the foundations
to tell the after-world that many thousands of human beings once
lived and worked, suffered and rejoiced on this waste spot. The
lines of the streets may be followed and ground-plans traced; but
the demands of cultivation are steadily effacing the remains.

Tell el-Amarnuh. Whether we proceed by land from et-Tell
or disembark at Hagg e1-1randil, we have to ride towards the hills
to the E., in Which, even from a distance, we discover the gates of
the celebrated tombs of Tell el-Amaruah. In either case it is advisable
to have a guide. On the way we should not omit to visit the recently
discovered grave of the sun-worshipper Jrliu-en-aten (Amend-,
tep IV., see below), Of the two groups of tombs that to the N. is
the more interesting and the more easily accessible.

An interesting and not yet fully explained epoch of Egyptian history
is illustrated here by a large number of paintings and inscriptions. In
