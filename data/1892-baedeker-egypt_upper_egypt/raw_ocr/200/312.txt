soription relating to the Horus myth, on the inside of the W.
girdle-wull, states that 'thay reached Seth-Typhon and his com-
panions in the home of Apollinopolis’.

Horus emerged victorious from this battle, and the evil Seth-
Typhon was pierced by him (tabu). 'Pitsrcarr thereupon became his
name, and 'pUca of the piercing' the name of his district and town.
This name is clearly preserved in the modem name Eats, An-

History of the Temple. The representations and inseriptior1s
that cover the walls of the great temple of Hams at Edm place it
beyond doubt that the building in its yxesent term dates from the
pariod of the ?tolomias. Yet like tha sanctuary of Rather at Den-
derah, it is not an axahitectonic creation of that pariad, but mereiy
a splendid restoration of an earlier temple carriad out under the
