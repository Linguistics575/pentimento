vessals of silver, gold, khesbec (lapis-lazun), and mafak (mu-
lauhitc.)

In the corraspcnding scenes in the lower row the king appears in
his aharict (at they left end of the N. wall), with his back turned to
the great ones of the Khan (Syrians) Be drives past sevaral
castles, built by himself, some of them described as wuryr-stM'lons;
beside the lower ones is a small fresh-water lake. In the second
scene the king is shown in his chariot, shooting arrows against his
foes, who are named ‘Shmu’ (Bedu"ms). IfortiMd water-stations
appear here also and a beaten or wntch-tuwor of King Ramenma.

The foliowinp; reprssantsrtion is one of the most rsmarkable in
Egypt, for it clearly moves that a kind of Suez Canal, Le.. a mum!
dividing Africa. from Egypt, existed as early as the time. of Sad. I.
The relief represents the king on his homeward journey. His
spirited horses prance aleng before the light chariot, whioh marries
only the I’haroah and the heads of his slain enemies. (The king's
favourite horse is named 'Ammon gives the swirrd'.) In his left hand
:he king holds the reins and his bow, and in his right the sword of
victory, the scourge , and a numbax of cords to which pinioned
enemies am fastened. Three of the latter he drags after him, and
three rows of Asiatics fasmxed together by the neck precedes the
horses. The bastions with reservoirs which the proeession has to
pass axe rspresemtod at the foot of the relief, in accordance with the
peculiar Egyptian system of perspective, Th8 desert-station imtue-
diately beside the hind hoof; of the king's horses is called Migdol of
King Ramanma. (Migdol is a Semitic word meaning a trrrtitUd tower
generally.) Between the hind and fbreiegs of the horses appears
another fortress, called the castle of the lions. The train of return-
ing Warriors is sepaxamd from their Egyptian fatherland by a canal
full of crocodilas. That this is not merely an arm of the Nile is in-
dicated by an inscription above the bridge, to this right, which
names it Ta Imam, Ce, literally 'the cutting', The rrTorsodiles, which
do not live in salt water, show that this canal was supplied from
the Nile; and the two groups of figures on the farther bank ahow
that it marked the boundary of Egypt. In the upper group are
priests and grandeeg, with curious nasegays in their hands, who
await the Pharaoh with low oheisances; in the lower group the
women ram: their hands in grseting to the returning king, who
brings with him their husbands and sons. The insariptiou runs:
'The priests, the great ones, and the princes of Upper and Lower
Egypt approach to welcome the good god Ci,e, the king) on his wrt
tam from the Syrian land, with enormous booty. Never has tho
lilo happaned since the time of the god', Le. probably zines the
time of Rs. - The 'eutthig' which thus divided Asia and Africa
can only be the cans} by means of which the early Pharaoh, en-
deavaured to links tbe Nile with theRed Sea (camp. Vol. 1., p.427),
the through communication from the Red Sea to tha Mediterranean

mxoxmn‘a Upper Egypt.
