The *‘Tamyla of Edfu is superior to the temple at Dendersh in
the much greater distinctness of its sculptured reliefs and inscripo
lions, due probably to the use of better sandstona than that of
Dendemh which contains moxalima. It is also much more complete,
for in addition to chambers corresponding to those found at Don-
dernb, there are at Edfu a passage running round the temple and
a lofty wall enclosing the latter, besides a spacious forio-oourt and
two massive pylons. (Comp. the accompanying Pun with that of
Dendsrah at p. 80.)
