they are reptesented’. Melly of the eoiumne ere prostrsto, others
lean as though on the verge of falling, and erehlcrave and roof-
stubs have either fallen or seem on the point of doing BO. Yet the
whole is so wo-pros-l that we never forgot that we are in a
eoionmded hall, and the ruinous eppearenee so far from destroy-
ing the general impression adds a picturesque charm to it. The
enormous proportions of this structuse are perhaps best appreciated,
if we Plate ourselves in the wide doorway of the second pylon and
look through the double row of huge celyx-mlumne towards the
sanctuary, 3,6. tewexde the E. The magic iniimmgis of the place is
fully felt in the morning or evening, or by moonlight, when the
columns east intense black shadows on each otMr,

Roof. The ymcessioml route (p. 119) was distinguished by
plaeing on each side of it higher columns than in the teat of the
temple. These higher columns have eslys-?tpits1s, on which rest
cubical abet-i, supporting the massive archituves which run parallel
with the main axis of the temple, Above the erehitxave another
small erection is visible. The lower columns immediately adjacent
on both sides were connected with this inner row, try enacting upon
them square pillars, separated by Windows, and united with each
ether by means of a long erohitreve, above which another smaller
exertion is ahemved. Only one of the windows Is now extent, and
that in imperfect preservation. The union of these four rows under
a common roof thus provided a lighted passage, about 78 ft. high
(about 32 ft higher than the rest of the hail), through the centre
of the colonneded hm. The shape of the columns in the outer rows
is shown in Vol. L, p. 1641); the oMrx-avrpitals of the two inner
rows in Yoi. L, p. 165r--The Columns are not monolithic, but
are built, like huge wih-towers, of hewn stonest The central
rows have smooth sham and enormous eslyx-cepitals with curved
edges». Five bande st the neck of the trolumn fuxen the striped
petals and stander water-plants, which, mingled with royet
carteuehee and other decorations, cling to the taiyx. Each cepiul
resembles a gigantic goblet. Unfortunately the minutenees of the
ornamentation, especially on the upper parts, is not very suitable
for the huge proportions of the columns. AU the columns, both in
the inner and in the enter row, are adorned with the name of
Ramses II, and various emhelliehmente. The shafts in every case
bore sunk reliefs ('en ereux’), the former painting in which Is stilt
traceable at plums. The 1tisertptioms and rtyprsrentaeonts preasnt,
on the whole, but little variety; but in a few considerable dif-
ferences may be noted as regards the pemena of the gods and the
gifts which they received or bestomsd, This is specially the ease
with the columns. These in the ttrst Ms rows to the N. have,
towards the top, the Gartgaehsa of &sti L, and farther down that
of Ramses IV.; the remaining rows hue Ramses lr, at the top end
