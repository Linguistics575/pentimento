0n the IF. bmk, 1 M. Kota the Nile, in Kelawa tsblrtgh (rail.
stat., p. i), a small town with 10,000 inhab., where fowls, eggs,
eta, mav be procured cheaply (largo market on Sun.). In the vi-
cinity are many large palms and also sugiplar1tatiorus, Farther

lies frh6kh4Bvti1, with tombs of the old empire, ine1miing those or
priests af Khufu, Userkaf, and Pepi,

We next reach the ruins of at-Tell ﬁlld the grottoea pf Tell 61.
Awnah, two very interesting points on Ge R. bank, at which the
Toar weeks' eteame‘r stops for a few hours on m return-joumay.
The best plan is to disembark M st-Tell, visit the remains of the
old town, return to the dhahabi‘yeb, and sail to Ham; el- Kama, where
donkeys for the visit to the grotmea are more easily obtained than
at. et-Tell. We pass to the right of the Village of ct-Tell, 5/. M.

lived and worked, suffered and Iejoic-ed on this waats spot. The
lines of the streets may be followed and grnund-plans traced; bat
the demands of cultivation are steadily effacing the remains.

Tell al-Amarnah. Whether we proceed by land from tst-Teil
or disembark at Hagg el-Kandil, we have to ride towarits the hills
to the E., in which, even from a distance“ W0 disoaver the gates of
the celebrated tombs ofTell e1-Amasmsh. In either use it is advisable
to have a guide. 0n the way we should not omit to visit the recently
discovered grhye of the sun-wershipper Khu-m-alm (Amenho-

the more interesting and the more easily accessibla.
