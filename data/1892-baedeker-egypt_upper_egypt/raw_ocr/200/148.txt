corresponding temple room. " of the twelve crypts axe beneath
the groaud-ievel, and of these two are in the first hypostyle hall E
(Nos. 11 and 12 in Pl. n) The entrance to crypt No. 10 is in
Room xxm, adjoining Ball D. Of the remaining; three subterranean
eaypts (Nest 1, 4, 7), the tirst is only accessible by a ilight of steps
dascending from crypt No. 2, which lies above it and in entered by
an opening in the wall of Room wr. The discomfom of the climb
axe compensated in thie case by the sight of two crypts, the. lower
one, the largest of all, consisting of 7 chambers, and the upper cna
adorned with representations and inscriptions in unusuauy good
preservation. No, 4, entered from Room WU, and No, 7, from
Boom XIV, are closed with doors, which the, teruple-keeper will open
on request Goad stama stairs lead to both, and no visitor should
fail to visit " least these two crypts. Magnesium wire or a lamp
will be found useful in examining the painted walls. 011 the. stair-
case leading to No. t occurs a. mention of a festival celebrated on the
4th Epagamnne day, and within the cryPt is a painting of king
Pepi, kneeling and offering a golden statue of Am. All these
statues, whose dimensions are given, wen probably kept in the
crypts. Still more important are the inseriptiuns in crypt No. 9
{mentioned on p. 81), which in entared by a. very narrow hole high
up in Room w. The calandn-(latas of festivals instituted by Tut-
mes Ill. (1700 B.0.j are here fauna. Mention is also made of the
fact that the annient plan of the temple under Cheops was re-dis~
covered in. the reign of King Pepi (hh Drs).

We now nseend one of the staircases ment‘mued on p. 91 to
the Temple Roof. Caution must be observed on account of the holes
made in the roof to admit light and air to the rooms below. At the
S.W. angle of the roof stands a small open pavilion, supported by
12 columns, which played an important part iluring the solemn
procession at the fastivsl of the new year (p. 91). We pass through
this pavilion in passing from the E, staircase to the W. chambers.
The W. smircaae, which ascends in in1egessi7e irvghts, lends past a
mom in the middle story, probably used as a workshop for restoring
and repairing the status and utausils of the temple. Six chambers
on the root, three on the W, and three on the lil., the iirst in each
can being "rtroofad, were used in the worship of the slain and risen
Osiris, as curious raprestsutations indicate, The second room on
the E. side formerly conuinad the famous Zodiac of Dendgmh, now
in the Bibliothequo Nutlmmlo at Paris.

Finaliy a walk roumi the outside of the: temple will be found
interesting. The Inscriptiom, so frequently reigned to above, which
contain the T1luItN1 and dimensions of the various apartments of tha
temple, were laid bare by Prof, Diimiehssa i111875, am} after being
copied were again covered up. The projecting lions' heads on the
