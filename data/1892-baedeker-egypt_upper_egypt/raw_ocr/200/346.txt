from their native rock, this iiruyl operation being probably accum-
plishmi with the aid of wet wedges. Such an Obelisvk, still attached
to the rock, may be seen about 1/2 M. to the S. of the town and
about as far to the E. of the Nile, It is not easily found, as it is
frequently more than half-eovereir with sand. At its broadest part
this obelisk measures 101/2 ft; its length is 92 ft. (72 ft. cut out),
not reckoning the pyramidal top, which hes already been hewm The
economy of material on the gut of the ,tiynir-intttiprg is noteworthy.
In the quarry near the mad and visited by all travellers, is a huge
Block of Rock, ttam which the mason has begun to hew both a

wail understood how to disintegrate the granite with borers and to
split it with wedges. Numerous holee were made in a tixtsil line
(probably with the help of tiraw-boring), the damp wooden wedges
were driven la, and in this manner tolenbly even fractures were otr.
tained. The art of splitting the stone by heat was also understand.

4. Tue ANCIENT ROAD AND 1m; BRICK WALL.

We turn to the right (wo from the quarriee and follow the broad
sandy road loading S. toPhilm, The desert has a wonderful pre~
serving virtue If the road Along which the traveller now rides were
practicable for carriages, Strabo’s description would still tit it in
every point. ‘We drove’, writes the ancient geographer, 'trem Syene
(Aesuén) to Philm, through a very fist plain about 50 stedin long.
At many points all along the road, and on both sides, we saw the
roundad, smooth, and almost conical blocks of dark, hard rock, te-
sembling Resrmes-towsrs, from which matters axe made. Sumner
blocks lie upon larger ones: and support others in their turn; here
and there were isolated blows', eta, - To this we need only add
that pious pilgrims and wayiarexs have ohiseiNd their Names and
shaft Inscriptions on many or the Myovs-mtsrttioned blocks. Princes,
digriitkii priests, and warriors, have travelied this way, as far back
as the times of the Amenemhas and Usartesens. Down to a late
period pilgrims were in the habit of placing inscriptions on these
stones, accompanied with the representation of the soles of the feet.
