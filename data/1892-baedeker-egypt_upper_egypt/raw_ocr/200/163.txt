spicuous as e city of temples and priests, but its inhabitants dis-.
clined in wealth, It may be easily conjectured that these, formerly
the chief among the citizens orEgypt, bore bat ill the face which
now placed them far behind thsAlaxaudrisag. Strangers sat on ths
throne of Its, and cared not to isle the uoubla to visit in person
the remote Diospolis, the coronation-town of the Pharaohs, who
had been acnustomed to make a mumphal entry after each victory
arm to offer thanks to Ammon. The tyarlier noble Lagidae were suc-
ceeded by worthless ruiers, whose extnvagent mete: forced them
to drain the resources cf the Thubejd and other provinces. Un-
der the gluttouous Energetes Tr. and hie consort Cleopatra Cecce
the Alexandrina rose in revolt and expelled Alexander L, the
king‘s son. The citizens of the cxpital " Upper Egypt dared ated
to rise in the attempt to win back their lost indeyendenee; and
they refused to lay dome their arms even when Ptolemy Sate: II.

besieged the town, whose inhabitants hMVely di0rtded themselves
in the huge temples, each of which served " a fortress. Finally,
however, Thebee wee stormed; ha treasures were plundered end
its venerable monuments terribly mutilated. Thenceforwatd Thebes
is only mentioned as a goal of inquisitive travellers, who under the
Roman emperors were attracted to the Nile by two monuments in
particular _ the pyramids ma the musics] colossus of Memnon on
the W. bank at Thebes. Diodoms (60 BAY) and Strabo (248.0)
describe Thebes as it was site: the destruction The latter found
only a few relies on each side of the Nile, just as the travails: of
to-day does. An earthquake, no common oeeurrence in Egypt,
hed done more then the hand of the ilereiy warrior to destroy the
monuments of thousande of years, In 27 or 24 BAG. 3 convulsion
of this nature wrought such havoc that Eusebiue declared, though
not without exaggeration, that the Egyptian Thebes had been
levelleé with the ground. In the absence of some such natural
force, we should be tempted to declare that the annihilation of
many parts of the mouumenls of Thebes must have been a teak
only less dimeuit then their continuation. At many yoiuts, espeM-
ally in the temple at Kemak, the injury is plainly to be ascribed
to human handa The representations, dating from the period of
the Ptohanies, within the second main pylon, to the Itit as we sp~
preach the large hypostyle hell, have been rammed with use at
hsrmmms. Some smaller injuries, enpecinlly to the - of the
kings, were due to political reasons, as when Tutmes EIL, after he
obtained the sole power, destroyed the curwuches of his too unbi-
tious sister and guardian ; others are to be ascribed to the evil habit
of certain Pharaohs of appropriating the monuments of their pre-
decessurs by imbstitating their own names fox those of the roll
builders; and yet others had religions causes, as when the game of
