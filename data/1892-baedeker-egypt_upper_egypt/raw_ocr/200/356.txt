the oldest part, dating ttom Nectanebua. We know also that the
goddess of Philse was worshipped by the Blammyes o, 30?), who
maintained the custom of human saraifiees until the time of Justi-
nian. After Diocletian, who personally visited the island, had conv
quered these restless children of the desert, he destroyed the
mrtifieations of Phiue, and new temples were erected in which
priests of the Blemmyes and Nnbadex were permitted to offer
sacrifices to Isis along with the Egyptian priests. And these tribes
even obtained the right of removing the miraculous image of
the mighty goddess: from the island at certain solemn fNstivMs
and of retaining it for soma time. Even after all Egypt had long
been christianized and the Theba'id was crowded with monks, the
ancient prgan-worsMp still held sway in sNubir, in spite of the
Edicts of Theodosius. The Nobades were converted to Christianity
about 540 Al). under the auspices of the Empress Theodora, and
shortly afterwards Nurses, sent by Justinian to Egypt, clnsed the
temple of Isis on Philan, and sent its sacred contents to Constantinv
ople. At tlrst the people of Phila, adopted the orthodox creed, bat
when Egypt was conquered by Isifun, they exchanged, this for the
mouophysite heresy. Although an inseription has been found in
the promos in praise of 3 Bishop Theodoms (577 AD.), who de-
dicated a portion at least of the tample of Isis to St. Stephen, it
is doubtful whether Philse Was ever an episcopal seat. It is certain,
however, that Christian services were held in the hypostyle. The
inscriptions and reliefs were plasmred over with Nile-mud or bad
crosses carved upon them, MI as to spare the feelings of tha faith-
ful and to exorcise the evil spirits. _ Like Christianity, tslim was
late in finding its Way to Phila', and there is not atrace ofa mosque
or anything of that nature on the entire island, Nubia was effec-
tually conquered in the 13th cent, by the Egyptian 5111mm, who
included the c'atarsetigion in their private domains, and thus
secured the temples from destruction. --Phi% was described in
1737 by Worden and Pococke, though at that time this natives were
as hostile to strangers as they are now friendly and obiiging.

Im, the chief deity of the island, i5 usually represented 1n the
