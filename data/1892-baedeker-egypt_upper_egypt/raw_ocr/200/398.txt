TEMPLE " SEBU‘AH. 32. Route. 323

few without heads lie behind. Beside the two first are two colossal
statues of Ramses IL, 101/2 ft. high, placed against pillars, hearing
the cutouches or the king, ‘beleved of Harmechis sad Ptah' on the
right, and 'beloved of Ammon-lla and Ptah', on the left. The king’s
name appears on the gird1ise of both tlgartss and on the chests
of tho syhmxea. Statues of the king, probably four in number (now
deatmyed), also stood in front of the pylon, which is 32 ft. high
and 42 ft, broad. On the back of one of these statues it is recorded
that tha king erected this noble pillar in Pa-Amcm (apparently the
holy name of the temple) in memory of his father Ammon-its and
adorned it with costly gems. 0n the oucgide of the pylon, as in
various other Egyptian temples, are two colossal i1,gurss, which,
however, are diriimut to identify owing to the wastherwom state
of tha sandstone, of which the tompm is built, On the right the
king holds eight foes by the, hair, menacing them with his weapon
while they raise their hands in ssqsplisxttion; 'he smites the great
ones of all lamis? The god Harmachis hands him the sword of
victory. To the left is a similar scene, in presume of Ammon-Rs,
who promises to the king victory over all alien lands. The large
fore-court, which we now enter, is 65 ft. square. The interim is
very interesting. To the right and left are corridors: each with 5
Osiris-Piotr" supporting an architrave. On the 1612(8) side the
roof of slabs is still extant, bat on the N. side it is wanting, so that
the drift-sand has found entrance and now covers a considerable
portion of the court. At the top of the back of the pylon occur the
varying cartouches of Ramses IL, and beneath the cornice his name
occurs again, in anaglyphic characters. On the left (8.) wing, of the
pylon, the king presents a. sghinx to Ammon-Ra and Math, to the
right he ofrirrs bread to IIarmachis and Jusis. Rottnil the court in
the row neumst the ground appears a procession of the children of

the king, each with the name appendecl, the sons bearing fans l,

the daughters bearing sislm ' Thom are two sodas, both be-

ginning on the W. or baee-wsll of the court and running respectively
to this right and left from the W. entrance to the main temple, Ott
the W, wall, to the right of the tssmphs-door, are 19 men (mostly
concealed by the sand), on the N. wall M) men ami 8 women, and
(m the B. will, to the N. of the entmme t0 the count 27 women,
Le. in this series 59 sons and 35 daughters. On the W. wan to the
left of the tsmphs-6our ere 19 men and 20 women, on the S. wsil
33 men and 12 women, i.e. 52 sane end 32 daughters, if the
names are not repeated, as at Medina. Hsbu, Ahydos, em, iit
