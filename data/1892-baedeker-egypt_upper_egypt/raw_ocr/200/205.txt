of King Hams, the lower part of which dates from Amenhotsp IO.

Beyond the pylon, which we skirt rather then pass through, is
the Avenue of Syhinxes, bounding the proceeeional route that led to
the S. buildings. To the E. of the avenue two Chambers, painted
in bright colours, were excavated by Mariette. They belong to a

hymn to the goddess Math), and both without and within the girdN-
wall, were numerous lion-headed Figures oszhhet, many of which
have already found their way to European museums fe.sr. at Turin).
