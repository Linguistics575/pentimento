This obelisk has been or the greatest importance [or the interpretation
of the Egyptian hieroglyphica. The names of Ptolemy Eucrgetes am

The W. Obelisk, as we have said, remains in Him though il has
lost its point. Upon it is inscribed, in Greek, a petition from Thaiy.
dotos, son oiAgesighrm, to Isis and her fsl1ow-gods, eating from the
timis of N30: Dionysus. Them are also some Arabic inscriptions.

The hypmhml vestibule was bounded on each side (E. andW.)
by six culumns and one of the obelisk?“ The six W. cohmms are
still standing, bat only three stamps ofthe E, row remain. Between
the columns were sereen-wa0s, half as high as tha shafts, and
adorned with contave comicas and balustxades of Urame-serpsuts,
The cnlumns, only 2% ft, in thickness, am 151/3 ft. high, and have
calyx-capitals supporting an abacus decorated with the Hathw-
mask, on which rests a small chapel. These capitals, which re.-
semble those of the Pmlemaic epoch, are specially remarkable, as
they were erected by Nectanebus before the period of the Lagidaa.
Neetanebus who msirttsimsd himself for some time in opposition m
the Parsian kings, wpears to have delighted in comparing himself
to the ancient Pharaohs, as we may gather from his first name Ba-
khtper-ga, which was also that of Usertesan l. of the 12th Dyn ,
and it ig possible that he adopmd, in the same spirit, old and for-
gotten artistic farms in his exactions. It is certain that the Ilathor-
mask at the top of the columns is only found earlier than his than
on the monuments of the i8th Dyn. at Dér alwbahri (y, 223) and
el-Kéb (p. 236). The architects ofthe Ptolsmies were afterwards ah
traded by the Abacus adorned with the countenance of the goddess
ofDeniierah, adojpted it, and farther developed the sculptured i:Mys-
cnpitai, here first introduced by Nectane‘ous. - 0n the W. and E,
sides of asmh of the six stsruling columns are dediestion-inscriptions.
On the outer (WO side of the most southerly column (next to the
obelisk) is the inscription: 'The good god, lord of both worlds,
Ru-kheper-ka, sun of the sun and lord of the diadoms, Nectanebus,
the sverrslivirtg, erected this sumptuous building for his mother
1515, the bestows: of life, in order to enlarge hes dweliing with ex-
