On entering the First Court (Pl. A) we ubserve that it had on
im right and left sides a double 10w of columns, of which, however,
only a few smnty ramnhâ€˜m are to be found on the S, To the W.
this space is bocnded by the Jkeond Non, now in ruins. 0n the
left (S.) stood the Oulouna of 31mm: II. Pl. d), the material of
which was justly admired by Dlodozus (p. 59), and which madly
may be termed the hugest statue in Egypt. The remarkahla granite
statue (not sandstone like the colossi of Mamnon) was probably
t1oated down the river on rafts from Assam to Thebes. It hes been
deliberawly iiestroyeil (apparently, from the marks at the fractures,
by means of damp wedges), though to do so must have cost its
enormous pain. In the time or Diodoms, who visited Egypt about
60 All, it aypeazs to hava beau still uninjured; and we may 6tril-
clude, therefore, that it was dastropsd la consequence of the trdiet

Ramses IL appears in Weil-preserved hieroglyphim cm the upper
arm and on the seat of the statue, which lies close: by in shunned
