16, Medinat Hahn.

To the S.W. of f.rurnetMurrii, and at no great distance, appears
an extensive temple-group. This bears the nameof Medina: Hubu, a
Christian vinags which arose around tad even within the ancient
sanctuary as early as the 5th cent, and ofwhich wnsidcrablc traces
still remain. On the N. side ofthe temple-ruias rise heaps ot'rObish,
which we follow in the directiun of the river, untii we reach the
main tstadrr, which tttmis the 5.1L and is as imposing as it is
curious. The traveller of experience will at once perceive that
here we have. not to do with a monument erected, like the Rama?

easily distinguished portions, The earliest of these is the small

in front of the gateway and at the style or the inscriptions informs
the expert that this editlee dates from tho egoch of the Ptolemies.
Ressrving these for later inspeuion, we proceed tirst to the third
portion, the main temple.

the previomly existing temple of the 18th Dynasty. Though this
(ample is beautiful and finely proportioned in many of its parts, its
Architect has displayed no skill in ineorporating what already existed
with the new edifice. The emmeons opinion that the temple of
Medina: Rabu was a royal palace mast be most emphatically comm-
dicted. It wns no more a palace than was the Ramesseum or any of
the other buildings in W. Thebes. It WM a Memnonium devoted to
st1eestor-worship, and its principal pan wesiutended for the worship
of the mules of Ramses 111., and to remind posterity of his fame
and. his exploits. The temple survml also for the celebration of
festivals, including a spedauy important one for whose sdgquam
