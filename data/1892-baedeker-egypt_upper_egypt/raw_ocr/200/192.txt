see, that a temple must have stood npan this spot even before the)
epoeh of the Hyksos. Thsdsuildiag uftvary temple, without Excep-
tion, began with the construction of the sanctuary; and beyond
doubt, we are here standing in front of the most ancient part of tin)
entire temple ot Ammon. The granite! pillars to the right and left,
an Which a Inge Mwer-eaVx appears between two smaller ones,
also date from Tutmes Ili, Beyond thesa pillars and 8. small ante-
chamber we reach the - usually regarded as the Sanctuary. It is
built entirely of pink granite, and is divided into two chambaxs, a
very uncommon arrangement, although easily explaineain the present
case (see below). The front chamber, opening to the W., is 19 ft,
long, the hinder one, opening to the K, over 25 it, The roof has
baen completely destroyed; and a slab of granite, leaning obliquely
downwards, seems as though on the point of falling. The latter
was adorned with stars, and tracaa of colour are seen both upon it
and upon the walls; but the seulptares were never fully completed,
and the red outlines which served as a. guide to the sculptor may
still be made out here and there. The holes in which the door-
hingas were fixed, still show trams of verdigris, a proof that the
hinges were made of copper or hronzat

The entire douhIe-chamber and the pillars at its entrance date
mm the reign of Tutmes m, Marietta believed, probably with
juatice, that the actual sanctuary, or at least the original sanctuary
of the 12th Dym, lay behind (Le. to the E. of) the granita chamber,
because that would alone axphain the opening at the back at the
chambert A stale preserved in the museum at Gizeh records that
tho tample of Karmic was in exiatanca as early as the close of the
iith Dym, though then of little importmco. Wilkinson found the
name of Amenamha. 1. (12th Dym) an a shattered pedestal to the S.
of the sanctuary; sad an inscription of the 215tDyu., discovered by
E. da Rougé in the southmost court of the tempts (in tha S.E, angle,
to the right of the entrance by the pillars) contains an announcement
by a certain Amenhotey, chief priest under Ramses IX, that the
sanctuary of the temple of Ammon wag built in the time of Usar-
(esen L and then restored by himself. Two eteles in the quarries 0f

conquerar of the Hyksos, chased atoms to he quarries} for the
temple of Amman, in the 21st and 22nd year of his reign, At all
events the anciant sanctuary stood near the site of the one now he-
fore us, if not actually on the same spot. Tutmss entirely rebuilt
it, providing it with two doors, a peculiarity commented upon
above. The W. entrance must have existad before his time, for
it WAS turntd towards the portions of the temple built by his
ancestors. When Tutmes, however, added the large new atmo-
tura farther to the E. (p. 138), he connected it with the more Bil-
cient hely place, dividing the latter in two and adding I W. door-
way, so that it becama the goal for the pretensions mm: the K, ms
