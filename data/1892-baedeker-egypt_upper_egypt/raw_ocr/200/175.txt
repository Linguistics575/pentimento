The: great 'Yeriatyle cam (Pi. A) is believed by Important
authorities to have been built by tbs rulers of the 22nd Dynuty.
The oldest part of the 13mph is the sanctuary (p. IM), situated
much farther to the B. Probably the clearest view of the growth
and historical devalopment of the great house of Ammon would be
obtained by beginning there and thence visiting the later portions
in the ordar of their erection; but in following out this plan we
should bit obliged to divargn irregularly hithar and thither from the
main lines, and so would miss much ot the effect designed try the
buildars. The influence of the god was supposed to radiate from
within outwards; while ths procession ofhis adorars advanced slowly
cowards Amman from without inwards. The sanctuary was the tittM,
'tnsppriraehsb1s goal of the pious, few of whom were permitted to
?snatrsta farther than the peristyle court The hypcstyla hall was
indeed open to certain privileged worshippers, but only the ‘initla
ated’ ware alluwed to approach any nearer to ma holy of hoiiea. That
sacred clmmbar itself might only be entered by the high-prisst and
the Ring, the representative of the god upon earth. The arrange-
ment of the peristyle and succeeding chambms indicate in the
clearest manner the mime " the services celebrated within than.
