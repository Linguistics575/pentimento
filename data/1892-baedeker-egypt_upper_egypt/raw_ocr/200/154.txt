Bmeen Nahadeh and Luxor (E. bank) the Nile makes a bend,
beginning it ti-Irm4tl.o (W. hank), after which we continue in a
S.W. direction. - 2ramtueli, a mail steamer station on the W. bank,
formerly possessed axleusive plantations of sugarcane. In 1824 it
WAS the residence of Shékh Ahmed, and of 'Ali Kishef Abu-Tar-
bash, who bravely defended it against the iasurgents. - 0n the
E. bank, about. 3'/, M. from the river, lies the temple of Medamitt,
The ruins are not without interest, but it is better to visit them
later from Luxor (p. 151) if time permit, than to interrupt the Jour-
ney so near Thehos.

On the left bank, as we draw mar Thebes, rise high limestone
hills, presenting precipitous sides to the river, from which,hawever,
they are separated by a scrip of fertile land. The right bank is astter,
and the Arabian hills retreat farther into the diamnce. Before
reaching the point where the w, chain projects a long etsrveil mass
of rock towards the river, we see to the 18ft flrgt the great abelisk,
and the yylans of the tempk: of Kamnk, halfwoncealpd by palm-
treesl When we clear the abrupt proflk of the W. diffs and new
formations are visible) " its toot, we may eats}: a. distant view of
Luxor towards the SE. None of the buildings on the W. bank are
visible until the steamer has ascended as high as Knmak; than tlrst the
qolosst of Memnou and afterwards the Ramesseum came into view.
The talegmph-posts andwims, which here obtrude themselves upon
the vieW, seem strangely out of place beside the majestic rOcs of
Egypt'sgolden period. As we: gradually :ppmach Luxor, we distin-
guish the ttsgs firing shove the white houses on the bank and from the
consular dwellings, and the re’fs spptieis himself to tlad a suitable
anchorage beside the other dhahnbiyeha , which are always to be
found here. Those who desire to keep by themselves may ttret halt
oft Luxor, lay in provisions and other necessaries, visit Kamsk, and
then land on the W. bank. In this case the re’is wilt probably raise
o‘njectiom, and the sailors (for whom a sheep should be bought, us
they have tasted no meat ion the voyage) prove mutinous , no that
watchmen will be necessary.
