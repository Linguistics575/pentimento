ritrhly provided for. The rest of the inscription asaumes more and
more, the character of a hymn, like those mentioned at p.258and
elsewhere.

The above will srifiitre to show the tilial piety, with which Ramsea,
at least in the earlier part of his resign, strove to complete and re-
state the work of his father. But the remains of the building f30it-

From the Promos. containing the above inscription, two i1oors
only now lead into the Interior of the temple. the main entrance
in the middle and a narxow door to the extreme right. The First
Eypostyle Room (Pl. 0), a long but narrow apartment, makes
& solemn and imposing impression. The roof, part of which has
fallen in, is supported by " volumns, arranged in two rows and in
groups of four. The slender sharks are surmounted by capitals in
the form of papyrus buds. Scti I. did not eompletc the plastic de,
coxatlon ofthe room. Ramses began new sculptures instead ofttmse

sister Tefntst (giver of health), Se!) (giver of life and strength),

the great god Apham (Anubis), and Nut, Who imparts the fulness of
salvation. - The six lists of the norms of Egypt, on the lower part
of the walls, are also interesting As elsewhere, the districts are
represented as bearded male ilgures with the emblem of the Home
