‘He speaks: came to me Amman Rs, lord of the throne of the world
of E, Thebes. Look upon thy dwelling, which has been prepared
for thee in the exealleat site ofThebes, whose beauty is united with
the region of the dead'. The inscription is continued in the style
of a hymn, extolling what had been done tor this temple, and ex-
pmssing the god's approval of the work that wag hare dedieated to
him. m In the neighbourhood of this atala are numerous blocks
of stone and architectural fragments, which. halongad to the rich
temple of Amenhoiep mentioned in the itrseriptiort. There is no
possibility of reconstructing the grrmmi-pian of this building. mud
the halt-buried sphinxwmiumns and broken statues present little
interest. - Still farther to the N.W., at the foot of the Libyan
mountains, two itagmimts of an aneient brieh-Wilding, known as
JOm sb-W.US, project like huge horns from the ground, and at a
distanee may easily be taken for the cnlossi of Memnon.

18. The Ramesseum.

The *Rameuoum, batter known as the Momnoninm of Ramsesn.,
lies about 1/4 hr. to the N.N.E. of Kha is1-EIttim The mate skirts
the fertile land, and the ruin soon appears conspicuously on our
right, as we look towards the Libyan mountains. We pasa a small
banal with a water-wheel worked by a batUlo, which waters the
weU-eurtivsted tlelds near the Ramesseum, as well as a small grove
of gun! and tamsrur-tress to the E. of it, Whether it is approached
from the N. or from the 5., the Ramesseum presents a most picturesque
appearance‘ Ary almost all the sidevwalls have fallen, it is possible
to obtain a comprehensive view of the weii-prtrrrortioms6 arrange-
ment of this hsautiful temple and to grasp its general architetmml
idel. Though time has destroyed much, it is still possible to realize
the form of its main portions, _ So far as the Purpose of the Rames-
sauxzi is concerned, it may be srserted with absolute certainty that
it was dedicated to the worship of the mamas of Ramses II., and
stood in the same, relation to the tomb of that prime, as the chapels
at the entrance ts? the mcbtombs of wealthy yrivate citizens to the
adjoining mtunmy-shtsfts(vol L, p. 170). This is clearlyindicated by
the position of the monument, by the pmaeszion with imagaa of an-
cestors at the festival of the staircase, on the ti. part of the W. side
of the second pylou, by the list of the sons of the Pharaoh, and by

_ the ceiling-carvings in the last rooms of this Memnonium. Finally
several imusriirtions inferm us that the Ramessaum resembled the
tample which Ramses the Great vowed in gratitude for his rescue
out of the hands of the Khata who had surrounded him o. 16i).
