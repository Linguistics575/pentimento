a. Pavilion of Rama; m.
We lirst enter a kind of FOBB-COCBT (PI, A), with two small
buildings, which Were probably the Porters' Lodycs. Both these
and the girdle-wall stretching towards the: S. are surmounmd by
round pinnacles, resembling those already noted in the pictures of
Asiatic strougho16s sformed by the Egyptian umias Ces, on the lst
pylon of, the Ramasseum). These small buil6ir1gs bear (behind,
above the lintsl) the carmucheg of Ramses IL, Ramses m., and
Ramses IV, Passing between the porters” lodges, ws are confronted
with another buihiing almost in thrs shape of a horse-shoe, which
differs considerably from the pylons of other temples. It consists of
truncated pyramids, with almost imperceptibly sloping walls, and
a slightly receding central adiilee. An excellent survey of this pe-
culiar structure, which contains numerous apartments, may be ob-
tained from without, as there is an open space of about'M fe between
it and the mltrance between the porters' houses. The French EYE-
plorers haw given this tsdi3ce, the name of Pavilion, and it is now
generally regarded as the dwelling of Ramses ML, tshitrfly on M'.-
count of the reliefs in. the Interior "presenting scenes from the
private rim of the Pharaoh {camp 13, 174). The apartments were
probably designed for the reception of the king when engaged
in {estal eelebratioris and in arwrtsstor-worship. As has bean said
before, there wars no regular royal palaces on this bank of the Nile.
The royal dwellings looked very d'tfrertyrtt from the temple of Medina:
