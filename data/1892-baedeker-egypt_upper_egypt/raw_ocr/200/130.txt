Temple. DENDERAH. 7 . Route. 81

Avilline Flewus, the governor Aulus 1hnviuit Grispue, and the dis-
ttiot-goveruor Suapion Trychambos, the inhabitmts of the capital
and of the name dedicates! the Promos to the great goddess Aphro-
dite and her ftsllow-gods, in the twentieth (t) year of the Emp. Ti-
berins . . " .' An inscription recently found by INmiehen on the
B. side of the temple informs us that this outer wall of the temple
wee decorated in the ysttorsd yen of the Emp. Tiberius Claudius
(42 A.D.). There are, however, many representations of the Emp.
Nero both inside and outside the temple. The cryyte of the temple
date from the reigns of Ptolemy X., Ptolemy XL, and Ptolemy XIII.
(Sober IL; Ptolemy Alexander; Neos Dionyeos): The inscriptions
running round the temple refer to Ptolemy XVI. 03333.an and the
Emp. Angusms. 0n the exterior of the rear-wall of the temple ap-
Peara Ptolemy Kieres, accompanied by Cleopatra VI. sad the little
tJarsariors; the inscription is Ptulmis, surnamed Kisres. In both
cases the Cmssrion referred to is apparently the mm of Gamer and
Cleopatra. The temple would thus seem to owe its present form to
the last of the Ptolamies and the iirgt Roman empemra. It is, how-
ever, obvious that the site was prsviously occupied by older tismple
buildings, going back to the earliest period of Egyptian history.
King Pepi of the 6th Dynasty is repeatedly represented in the cryyts,
la am of these crypts (No. 9) the ancient building phn ot Den-
demh is mentioned twice. The first of these mentions acaurs in the
description of an excursion of the goddess to Edfu on the first of
Epiphi: 'The greet building-plan (semi) of Ant [Denderah) was
found written in ancient characters or: hide, of the time of the 6ue-
cessors of Horus, Found in the interior of the wall of the royal
pslnce in the time of King Pepi'. Another passage mule: 'The
great plan of Denderah, a restoration or the monument made by
King Ramenkheper (Tutmes mo, after It was fnund in ancient
characters of the time of King Khah'. The priests of Teutyra thus
"iyribeil the foundation of their temple to Khufu and Pepi. There
are, however, stones hearing the names ot Amenemha L, Tut-
mee m, Tntmea It, Ramses n., and Ramses m, all of whom
probably either built or restored parts of the 01d temple.

if we compare the temple of Benderah With * similar structure
ol the earlier peried, such as the temple trf Abydos or the great
nation] sanctuary of Karnak, we find it not less beautiful in its
own way, though of course in from 'torapeting with theae gigantic
structures in magnifhsense or extent. Its ehief characteristics are a
fine symmetry of proportions and irrgnitiad Luptstion to its pur-
posest A happy blending 0! Egyptian seriousness with Grecian
grace, which meets us unmistakably at every turn, has a yeculiarly
pleasing effect, and we feel much more at home in the halls of the
Hither of Tentyra than in the great hall of the god of Thebes, with
its farm of gigmtic columns. Neither the figures nor the iuserip-
tions sculgtured on the wane compare in masterly executio with
