mam racent. Thu imrerUtions usually give the name oftha deceased
and the data of death. Texts from the Karin are not uncommon,
in spite of the Prophet's express commami that the name of God and
passages from the Kor‘an should never be placed upon tombstones.
Ths tombs of the richer dead are small domed erections. On tha
summit of the hill to the right of the road am some large mosque-
like Cenaiaphs, dedicated to famous saints, such as the Shah Mah-
mild, the Shiikh 'All, om Indy (sine) 2einab, eta, whose memory
is calehrated by festivals Wt chair birthdays, etc.

About I/s hr. beyond Assuin wa quit the road and tum to the
E. (left). In a few minutes more we reach the verge of a hill, on
which blocks of granite am scnzcazad both singly and In hangs. A
moderately Softy emf beyond shows manifold traces of the industry
of the ancient builders, who, from the Braction of the pyramids to
tbs time oi cm Pmlamiaa, drew their supplies of granite from the
quarries of Syone. Almost tll the) granite pillars, columns, arehi-
uaves, roof-slabs, obelisks, and statues that we have hitherto seen
in Egypt, hail from this spot.

portion of hornblende is much greater than Chm. oi tsmite', The glue

The diligent hands of (he stona’cmtera of the Pharaoh haw left
distinm traces behind them. The method in which the blocks were
quarried in tiers may still be distinctly seen on a cliff facing the
N, about 8mim to the N.E. of the town. The skill with which huge
masses were handled and detached without injury from the chi! to
which they belunged, is absolutely marvellous. The cemimy of the
process adopted is amply vouched for by the fact that Obelisks were
completely finished on thres sides before they were Maily detached
