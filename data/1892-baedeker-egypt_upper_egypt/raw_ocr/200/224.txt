colonnudaa passage was suppmtod by 0rs1ris-rrsr_s (facing the
court) and papyrus-bud olarurw, Tha N, And 8, colonnados have
almost completely disappeared, but four oarysttrie-piWrs still stand
on the E. and as many on the W. Towarés the W. end, in the
direction " the entrance to the hypostyla hslt, afterwhrds to be
ilesarribeii, a number of steps ascend from tho pavement of the court
to the i1oorwrxy. Standing in the doorway of the secomi pylon and
looking westwnrd through the central door of the hypostyle hall
and through the smaller doorway In its farther (WO side, we cum-
mand an architectural perspective of great uharm. The builder has
5umeeded in produning the effect of distance and size by raising
the 'ioor-1ime1 of the temple towards the W. and by gradually
diminishing the size of the doorways that succeed mach other in tha

In the second court the roreeerstMimss on the W. Wail of the
Deanna Yylon (Pl. e), in front of which rose the E. row of nary):-
tides, are of special interest. The S. side of the wall has campletaly
cellapsed. In the midst of‘the ruins project two biocks of stane,
which bear a. representation ofthe fortress of Katesh, surrounded
by a blue stream (to the right of the beholder in the second noun).
To ths extreme left, the Pharaoh, much larger than tho other
warriors, dashes along in his chariot with his bow bent. This is
one of the most vigorous of the numerous battie-geenes that have
been preserved on Egyptian pylons. The leaping lion beside the
king's chariot is part of its adornment merely, though at the tirst
gimme it is apt to ha taken for the king's batile-companion preplir-
Mg for a mighty leap. Diadoms perhaps had this in his mind when
he deseribed the relief ot a fortress surrounded by water, and tho
Pharaoh dashing against the foe along with * tieree, lion that used
to accompany him in battle. The Asiatics full before the onset of
tho king like cars of cum before 3 hsil-gtorm. Huddlled perl-melt
tn confusmi heaps, piemad by arrow! or trodden down by the horses,
the Kheta fall a prey to death. The Orontes itows by the aide of
the combatants and crowds of Kheta are hurled into it; warriors,
horses, and chariots sink beneath the waves. We are frressistibiy
reminhd of the crossing of the Red Sea by the Israelites, that took
place only half a century later. 'Pharaoh', chariots and his host
hsth he cast Into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in
the Red sea. The depths have covered them: they sank into the
bottom " a. etone' (Exod, xv, 4, 5). Farther to the right, beneath
the fortress, acme soldiers hold oat a rescuing hand to the drownv
ing. Everything indicates that we have here a free repetition of
the battlevsnane on the tirst pylon. The battle rages neat Katesh.
amnng the slain here also are Khiraptrsor, the hisb0riogrtptter ot
the Khan prince, Kerebumsa hia ehar'1toteer, Titure, uhie’f of his
attendants, Pisa. his masmr of the horse (Kazan), Te k etr.
