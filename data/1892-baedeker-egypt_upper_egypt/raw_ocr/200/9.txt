vi PREFACE.

HEIGHTS above the ses-level and other measmements are
given in English feet or miles.

Though aesrly every page of the Handbook has been
compiied from personal observation and experience. and
although the conlervative East is not nearly so liable to
changes as the mere progressive West, the Editor makes no
claim to absolute accuracy in every detail; and he will feel
indebted to any traveller who, from personal esperieneo,
may be able to indicme errors or omissions in the Handbook.
The name remark applies equally to the PRICES and various
items of expenditure mentioned in the voiume, The expeuaa
of a tour is much more directly affected by the circumstances
of the moment and the individuality of the trageller in the
East than in 1T'E',i, though it may here be added that the
arrangements of easrs. Cook and Gaza (pp. XXV, XV), of
whisk most visitors to Upper Egypt will avail themselves,
offer a comparative immunity against extortion. A carefully
drawn up contract will similarly protect those who prefer to
hire a dhaUbtyeh for themselves,
