EE NILE JOURNEY.

The chartering of a private dhahnhiyah is much cheaper though
much more troublesoma. The first step is to engage & Dmyoymn,
not without a careful enquiry as to his record at the consulate and
from the hntelvkeepere, and an summation of the testimonials from
previous trmellers. There ale about 90 dragomans in Cairo, all
more or less intelligent and sble, but scarcely a half of the numbar
axe trustworthy. Most of them speak English or French, and a, few
spank Italian.

for him to show from the very bsginning that he is and intends to re-

clients, a. tendwcy which must at once he quashed.

The next stop is to select a suitabie dhslsMyeh assisted by the
dragoman. A contract is than made with the dragomxn, either enm
trusting him with the autim preparations, or assigning to him only
the duty of engaging and yaying the re‘is and crew} while the {raw
eller retains the commissariat department in his mm hands. The
ra‘is " steersman is a most important fauetionary upon whose skill
during the often stormy passage the safety of the vessel dependsl
The crew number from 8 to 12 according to the size of the dhaha-
hiyeh, The vessel is aithex hired by the day [for 2 pets. 5-N., 3
Ot 4361's. 6-h.) or ehartetad for the whole return-voyage toAssufm
(for f perss 300-3N)l, 3 or d puts. 350-400t0, In the former case
the dragoman will try to travel as slowly as possible to proiract his
engagement; in the latter case he will pass on, 50 " to save
hout-hire and heard. The latter arrangement is preferable, bat the
right of halting for 15320 days in the course of the journey should
carefully ha stipulated tor. The dragomnn must also provide don-
keys and camels for the excursions. Farther details are indicated
in the foilowlng ilrirrt-eontraets, ia which it is believed that nothing
of importance has been overlooked. The contract must be signed at
the travallefs consulate, either with the dragcman alone if he has
undartnken the whole of the arrangements, or with the dragoman
and rdte, when the trawller has hired the ills ahabiyeh and pays board
to the dragaman.
