the W. puts or Thebes, 8teursas, glittering with gold and
hriuimt arotours, waited here to receive the priests and the seated
images. On the rivet-stepa were ranged choirs, which, at least on
the tlve great festival days of Amman, greeted the pilgrims from the
opposite bank with songs. The ancient constructions on the hanks
have long been washed away. In January and February, the months
in which most travellere visit Kamak, the stream is only 100-200
paces from the yrocession-avonne; while during the inundation the
water penetrates mm the interior of the temple, which in ancient
times it was prevented from doing by huge emhzmhuxents Rem-

The 'Irirst Kain Priest (PI, I) is of enormous size. It is still
124 yds. wide‘ with walls 16 ft. thick and 14fy/g ft. high, This

no record of the fact is known, is destitute of inscriptions. Possibly
it was covered with etucce end adorned with paintings, as: Its iieerr.

mine from this point of vantage, it is useful and interesting to seek
to identify, with the aid of the accompanying plan, the various ool-
umus, obelieks, and pillars which at tirst present themselves in
apparently inexuiceble confusion, This is comparatively easy as
regards the nearer (W.) portion of the temple; but the more distant
portions, from among which ohelisks tower, are partly out of sight,
and are perlly so hyrisshortsrued by distance, that they appear to

of the various parts ot the building. The latter is only to be obtained
by wandering, plan in hand, through the ruins. It must, however,

parts owe their character not to any artistic calculation, but tty
