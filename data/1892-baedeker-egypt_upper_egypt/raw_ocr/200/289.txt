Lathyrus, all contributed by works of restoration to prevent the
building which had been compiated under Bataan from falling
into decay Both the style, and the inscriptions tell us that Dér or-
hahri is to ha considered completely a work of the beginning " the
New Empire. The size and simplicity of its parts, and espsciMly
the polygonal columns are a sign to those who are familiar with
the devehpmeut of Egyptian arehiteotare, that the Eyksos period
must be coneidured to have been a time of stagnation in Egyptian
art, and that tsxsetty the same forms and arrangements cot columns
were common to the architects of the 12th and to those of the
18th Dynasties. In Thebes, and not least at Dtir elahahri, the ob-
server is tampter} to regard the New Empire as an Immediate con-
tinuation of the 0111, although between them lies a period of f1vry

The plan of this, terrace-templo is remarkable, and cannot be
compared with any other in Egypt. The arrangement In four
terraces rising from the levul ground up the steep side of the Li-
byan mountains is quite unique. The stages were cut out of the
E. slope of the mountain, and support was given to the outer and
inner walk; by magma of blocks of the timsst sandstone. At the St
and of the terraces we can beet see the care taken to support tha
earth'worka‘ The outer wall consists here of £11er polished blocks
of Limestone with simpla bat effective ornamentation. Broad pi-
lnstera, but only 3 in. deep, placed some distance spart, projeat
from the wall with which they are connected. Above each is
snthroned a gigantic hawk with the ozown of Upper and Lower
Egypt standing upon an Uraus-vserpsnt, sud above it ig the aymbol

A long Avenue of Sphinx”, probably beginning with a pylon,
near the entrance to the tomb of Petamenap (p, 222) led up to the
series of terraces, the lucceaaive stages being reached by steps
placed in the middle.

Thsr First Terrace (beginning from balow) is almost entirely
destmyed, but wn can make out the pathway which led from tha
bottom to the top, and divided the whole into two equal pun. 139-

were used only under the 17th and 19th Dynasties. The pressure
of the earth is sustained by a lofty inner wall on which are some
