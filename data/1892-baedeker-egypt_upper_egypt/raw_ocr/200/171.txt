bbbolder by the building now, mined but with its whole plan nut
theory still clear um inteliigibls There in nothing new to distract
the eye from the lines and forms of the temple; and ths pomp of
banners am! the clouds of incense are replacad by the magic of
dignified antiquity. Amidst chase hoary rains, we realjm the short-
ness of our mortal span and recognize the evanascence of human
gxeatnass and splendour.

Starting from the great pylon of the temple of Luxor, We pro-
ceed to the E., then follow the street with the 01-001; shops, and
leaving the houses of the ghawiszi and the hill with the tomb of
the shékh to the right, hold towards the N. We soon arrive at the
tlrgt ruins ofkarnak, and thia1iy, if wa haw foilowed the W. route,
reach an imposing row of Criospliinxtsa, Le. sphinxus with the ho-
dies of lions and the heads of rams. Nest this point, to' the S. of
the temple, are two almost panliel Procession: Avenues tieayUd
with sphinxes, one uniting the templa of Muth (p. 148) with the
S. py1ons (p. 147), the other 1sei11'tsg from the tampie of Luxor to
the trample of KhunsMp. 148). These two avenues were connected
with each other by a third crossvavenue of sphinxes, Fa follow‘
the left (W) avenue, the fisnking sphinxas of which my canal in
the grand style and are placed close to Each other. Between the) legs
of each is a suiuette with the name of Auxenhotep IU. (Be-mt-mo),
This leads us to the handsome but almost too slendex Pylon XII,
erected by Ptolemy III, Euergetes L, with a winged aun-disc in the
cmement, with boid1y-spraad pinions. 1n the time of the Lagidae
"ditional pylons, corresponding to this one, were placed at the ex-
treme corners of the tssmpis That on the N. side (y. 143) is still in
admirable yroeenation. Inside the portal Euargetas is represented
in Egyptian style thuugh salad in Gmek costumm To the right of
the lowest representation on the left side, the king appears sacri-
fioittg m Khunsu. Batwaen these an the hawk of Home, the vul-
turs of Nekheb, and the ibis of Thoth, which are 3130 represented

ilediesttsd to Khunsu of Thahea. Another IYOIHIS of sphinses
follows, beyond which rises the Temple of Khumu (Pl. Y.), a hand-
some building on which, however, we now bestow outy a passing
glance (camp. F 148). About 200 paces tuwnrds the W. bring us
to the FiratWirirs Pylon (el-Mb el-gebtri, which faces the river. W3
