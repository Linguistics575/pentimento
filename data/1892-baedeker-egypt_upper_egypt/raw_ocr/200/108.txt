esaencea were poured out in honour of the god, The framework of
each scene, the mouldings separating the lines of hieroglyphics,
and the hieroglyphic symbols themselves are all executed with in-
imitable care. The side-walls of this hall, to the right and left, and
the walls near the gates leading lo the nhapels, hem symbolic w-
presentations, like chase in the first hail, of the names nf Upper
and Lower Egypt.

At a conaiderable interval, beyond the third row of columns in
the second hall, and on the same level with them, is a series of
SmN VAULTED CEAMHRBE " CKAPELE, forming the Sanctuary of
the Memnonium. The metal doors with which they were once closed
have long since disappeared. In the piers separating the doors are
rectangular niches, which probably remained images either of the
deities to whom the chapels Wera dedicated " of King Sssti, Each
chapel is vaulted and the vaults are profusely and beautifully de-
corated with stars and the name Rs-m-ner, (praenomen of Seti L),
Dedicatory Inscriptions on three of the vaults prave that Oairis must
be regarded as the chief divinity of the temple. It must be noted
that the roofs of these chapels are not vaulted in the strict archi-
tectural s'1grf1titation of that word; they cunsist rather of blocks of
atone cut in a rovnd fashion and crowned by a key-storm which is
hollowed (mt. in the interior. The chapels were dedicated (begin-
ing from the left) to the king, Ptah, Harmachis, Amman, Osiris,
Isis, and HDIUS. MI the chief tlgures in the0stris cycle of gods are
represented here with the exception of Seth, the antagonist of Osiris,
and his wife Nephthys. With them is associated the king who has
become Osiris (see 1). 57). Math, who becomes SokaxbOairis when
regarded in his relations to lim beyond the grave, is of course re-
presented. In the ylace of honour in the midst of the seven is Aaw-
mon, 'who is the Duly one and whose years Marish among the gods',
who is ‘loftier in his iiiess than any other god', 'to whose feet the
gods crawl, recognising their lord and master', who is ‘lord of
eternity and ESYBRCO!‘ of tha unending', of whom indeed the other
gods may be regarded as attributes. To the right and left of Am-
mon are two groups of three. To the. right are Osiris, Isis, and Ho-
ms; to the left are Ptah the primwval, tho lord of tho past; Har-
machis, who announces the new day rising in the East, who strug-
gles for the victory of life over death, and assures the future
triumph of good over evil; and King Seti, the temporal incarnation
of itivithe power in the present, In the sphere of human activity.
To these gods, cuneeived as filling these chapels with their prev
aence, were brought the mummies, to be "net'ifiei1 for their eternal
home. The way to the different olmpels wag indicated on the very
threshold of the temple, where. Seti 1., as we have. seen, construct (1
seven doors in the rehr-ws11 of the prongs. Most hf these, how-
ever, were ciosgd by Ramses, probably to intensify and preserve the
secret and mysterious character of the temple, But th paths to the
