of the Pharaohs last as at the neighbouring Ptoiemiie divine honours
were, paid to the deceased yrinces of Macedonian origin. - It was
natural enough that in a sanctuary devoted to yurposea of this kind
no hoistcmus {eatimla or ceremonies should take place, and we are
not surprised to learn that neither singer nor tlute-player nor lute-
player W33 allowed within its walls.

The great building of Abydoe, at tiret sight, impresses neither
by its size nor by its beauty. The walk consist of mse.-grsiruul
limestone, while a harder material (sandstone) has been selected for
the columns, architraves, door-posts, and other bt1riierebearivg
parts. The foundations are nowhere more than 41/2 ft. thick, and
the platforms on which the nolumnn rest are equally suoow.
Numerous blocks have become disjointed, owing, as Mariette has
Shawn, to the giving way of the iiove-ta'1le of sycamore wood
with which they were fastened. The inscriptions " Seti and the
earlier ones of his son and successor show great purity of style, but
this quality disappears in the later texts of the latter. It has been
established that a sanctuary of some imporemee stood at Abydos
even in the days of the ancient- empire, and indeed we hear of its
restoration in that remote epoch. Our witness is h stale, now in
the Louvre, on which Ameniseneb, a priest and architect, who lived
in the reign of nesen I. (12th Dyn.), records the fact that be
renewed the nolouting and imseriptions in the temple of Abydos
from top to bottom. This probably means the building of which
some fragments, belonging to the 12th Dynasty, are seen to the N,
of the Meumonium (see p. 67). Under the Hyksos tha ancient
sanctuary was entirely neglected, and the only record here of the
18th Dynasty, which was almost wholly absorbed by its wars 5nd
foundations in Thebes, is an inscriytian of Tutmes III. Seti 1.,
however, of the 19111 Dynasty7 built an entirely Mew temple, and
his, son Ramses Ir. completed the adornment that his father left
unfhdshed. The gmund-plnn of the structure is uuumal, and difrerts
materially from that of other great Egyptian temples. Among the
features, however, which it has in common with these are the
prions, a tirst and semnd tore-eourt, 1iyposty1o halls, gnd a "ne-
tuary, The last, however, i," much more richly articulated than
usual. The wing to the s. (to the left on entering) forms an AD-
mn-ate right angle with the main isdiarAs. The whole atmctum is in
the shape of a mlsonâ€™s square.

We enter the temple from the Na. The irrbt pylon Ind the
walls enuloaing Court A are in ruins. Comm B, which open: to the
S. on the temple proper, is in better preservation. The sons and
t1srtlghters of Ramses II. were represented an the right and left walls,
but the tlgutss and inscriptions have been almost ts.trueed. In spite
of the fact that all the inscriptions and representations here refer to
Ramsas IL, it has been proved through the discovery by Mariette
of a dova-tail (see above) bearing the name of Beti 1.,1bat the
