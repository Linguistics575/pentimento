In the second row, to the right, the king in his chariot dashes
against the discounted foe, and aims a blow " thostile leader,
distinguished by a feather. Next the kingan foot deele the finishing
blow with his lance to an oflieer, who has been brought to his knees.
To the left the victorious monarch fares hormsward, preceded by
two rows of pris nets, named 'hi ants en tahil The small figure
behind the chariot is the "rtrwtt-pritoes Ramses. Then foilnws the
presentation of the prisoners, who are Mlleti Retennu and Tahannu
(Le. erystsd-eoloarad, white), to Amman, Math, and Khunau, who

calyx-capitals, and follow it qyastwsriis to Pylon IH., which we pass
through on ourway towaras the sanctuary, like the more highly pri-
viimprd worshippers admitted to the tempiu in early times. This
part of the tempie has been terrihly destroyed, but enough has been
left standing to shard an idea of the general arrangement. The
picturasque effect of the ruinous scena is enhanced by the variety
of artistic forms employed, and by the tall and slender shape of the
largeat obelisk in Egypt, rising from the midst of the ruins, and
testifyingto the past proud splendour of this truly royal trdithw, which
has, been ruthlessly trodden undar foot by the monotonous cycle of
years and shatteretl by war and earthquakes, - The - we
approach to the sanetuaxy the older are the parts of the temple we
trevoxse. The inscriptions afford materials for ascertaining; the date
of each different portion; whiie the practised eye will not tind it
dimealt to support the conclusions thus arrived at by comparison
of the successive styles of art. We here (irsd the polygonal pillar-
colunm anti the timsiy carved bud-eoiurnus, hearing clan and un-
mistskeablo evidence as to the idea, to which this order owed its
origin. The third pylon seems to have marked the limit of the
temple under the early empire, before the gigantic' buildings of
the 19th Dyn. were added. The W. side of this pylon, within the
great 1m?ostyia-hadi, still ahows the iucisioue mad u the wall
