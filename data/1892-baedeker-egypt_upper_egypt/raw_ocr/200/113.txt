66 Route d, ABYDO8, Memnonium

Memnoninm atAhydos, which contains no fewer than Ti) csrtouohes,

only two of which are slightly injured. The tablet from the temple

of Ramses (p. SO, now in London, contains i6 entire and 2 hut

destroyed osrtouisheg, while the list of Salshémh, discovered by Map
riette, has 39 whole and 3 damaged eartoueherr.

Mane, La Manes, the first historic king of Egypt, heads

the list. The names following his are theme of the most

eee prominent monamhe, at least those Whose legitimacy was

WM unquestionable. The Hemoleoptr1itams sad the Hyksos are

naturally left out, but other rulers, of whom we possesa

monuments, have also been apparently deemed unworthy of

inclusion in thin important roll of honeur. The merit of

tirst observing and publishing this inestimable historical

decument belongs to Prof. Diimichen.

On the left wall at the corridor we again meet Seti and the
youthful Ramses. The father holds a eenser in his left hand, while
the son, adnmed with the priestly panther-skin, pours ' libntien on
the Mtar in front of him. The titles of the right wall re-apyear
here. The inscription, which the toyal pair faces, contains in sysw
matit order the names of these objects of worship, with their homes,
whom Seti has honoured with gsMtriiicisl gifts. The sculpture in this
corridor, consisting of alto-reliefs on the tine-grained limestone, in
all executed with the greatest delicacy 1n the centre of the right
wall & oor leads into a narrow Chamber? t), vaulted 1n the same
manner as the sanctuaries (ir 61), and preceding the stair (Pl. u)
which leads to the hill at the hack of the temple. The inscriptions
here are in exnellent yreaervation, being injured only in a few places;
the adjoining figures ot Seti and Ramses show the latter arrived at
manhood and the throne. Safekh, the goddess of history, 'the great
mistress of books', addresses her darling sen 8eti. The ceremony of
foundation, which we find more fully represented and described in
the Ptolemaie temples, is nlao depicted here. The praises or the king
are sung, and his merits are, at the command of Ra, to he nommitted
to writing by the goddess of history. Thoth alto congratulates the
king in the emphatic manner asuai to such inscriptions, and promises
him an eternal existence and the stability ofhis kingdom for hundreds
of thousands of years. Thoth 15 named the tongue of RI. and lord
of the speech of the prophet of truth, This staircase was completed
while Ramses shared the throne of his father as iso-ruler.

The other rooms of this part of the building are all more or less
in ruins. From the S. end of the, kings‘ gallery we enter a kind of
peristgie Court CPI, Cr), with seven columna, which perhapa wes

ugrefully executed and appear 'en ereax' instead of in high miiet.
The most interesting scenes are those on the lower part of the walls,
representing the slaughter of the cattle, gazeilee, and antelope:
which Seti had so hsvishly vowed (in the adjoining king's gillexy]
