with axea, olivis-trrsrwhrrs, etc. Lying on the ground is a peculiar
capital, such as mey be seen also in other parts of the temple, con-
sisting at e cube, with the mask of the goddess Hethor carved on
the front md back. The upright broken sham should else he
notiesd; one half was treated as a pillar, the other " a polygonal
column with 7 sides. and an inscription was placed on the surface
of the pillar.

The ‘Third Terrace (Mariette’s Tarmac du Centre) deserves
especial notice. Undemeath there were on each side, left and right,
two rows otit square pillars which together formed two halls, 88 ft.
long, open to the east. Of these the pillars of the left hail still
Maud, only two remaining in that on the right. These hells imp-
ported a roof, of which all that remains is a fragment of the embi-
irevo end & broad slab on the it pillars in the back row. The
scenes represented on the inner Wall and en the left side eye of
great interest.

DisrNpxcding far the ptesenttha part ofme temple to the left(Spwa
of Hathor, p. 227) we begin with the right aide of the inner well
below the third terrace. The first scenes are somewhat damaged,
bat those which follow axe In a good state of preservation, and refer

the helmet on her head, before the seared bent of Arnmoredtt" The
hunt with e xem’s head at each end is carried by priests, of whom
the two in the centre are Iudv-priestas, clad in 1srpard-suus, Next
we see 7 Nehmtxees in tube. probably incense-hearing trees imported
to Egypt trom the East; men with tubs are piling up the incense
in hoses. Above are the weighing endmeasurlng ofpxecious metals,
as may be seen elsewhere. The weights need for weighing the gold
rings are in the form of oxen lying down. The goddess Sefekh marks
the result on a tablet. Next Me 3 Nehe~traae. Balow is seen a group
of 8 cattle, two eating the reed-grass en the riverusidet The scene
reminds us vividly of Phsroah's dream (G en. Km. l), 'And it came
to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and,
behold, he stood by the rivet. And, hehnkl, there came up out "
the river seven well-favonmd kins: and fu-fiashsd; end they fed in
the reed-grass', Nee! this are sacks with cosmetics (mealtm). Again
we tSod the Ring with the insignia of power. Then 2 rows of ships
belonging to the iteet which Ramake~Hetaau sent to Arahie. The
shape of the vessels, their rigging, ears, and rudders should be
noticed, as wen M the cargo which mm be seen an board, and the
loading by means of a. small boat. The necessary sxp1anutioms
are given by small insuiptione above the pictures 0 the left,
