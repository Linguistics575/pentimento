The inscriptions and sculptures (m the Second Pylon (PI, E),
enclosing the rear of the court, are still more interesting. To the
left am Ammon Ra and Math, the great queen of heaven, to whom
Pharaoh, wearing a richly decoramd crown, leads three xows of
captives chained togethar. The two upper rows have distinctly
European features, and wear embroidered aprons and low helmets,
Over the Jirst row no name appears, but according to the inscription
before Pharaoh, they are Shakaisha, Le. probxbly Sicilians. The
captives m the Eewnd row are called Tanauna or Danauna, a name
in which we are probably contact in xecognizing the ‘Danai', or
Hellenes of the Trojan era. The third row, in which the individual
Mums resembla those of the other two, is accompanied by the
following inscription: 'Provide breach for our nostrils, 0 king, son
of Ammon, say the foes from Puiassta'. In these Pulusata we must
recognize the Philistines, new and no contemptible foes of Egypt.
