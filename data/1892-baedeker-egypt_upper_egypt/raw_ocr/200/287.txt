Petamanap was a prince of the empire and an isfbriul of ths 26th
Dym, whose remarkable position entitled him to the unusual honour
of completing buildings at the temple of hreilimst-RMm, and of
placing his name upon them. The tomb is cut oat of ramarkably
tmautifal limestone); and its iaseriptioms display the nmmess of
tinish which is peculiax to the sculptures of the Egyptian resnais-
sance. It has becomn the [mum of thougauds of bats, which lend“
the attsapt to copy lbs inscriptions in the inner rooms very tliminilt
