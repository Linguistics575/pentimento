Here, as in most of Egypt, large quantities of pigeons are kept by
the peasants, "histly for the sake of their droppings, Which form the
only manure used in the fields, the dung of the cattle being dried
and used as fuel. Large pigeon-housea, not unlike pylons, are
visible in all the villages, and huge fioegs of pigeons are seen
wheeling in the sir or settling like a dark cloud on the iieids, Most
of these pigeons are of the cummon grey species, and attain a cam
sidezable size, but many pretty little reddish-grey turtle doves are
Alan seen The traveller is at liberty to shoot these birth, which in
the form of * pigeon-pie with olives form a most acceptable trddi-
tion to his larder, but he should exercise this liberty with discretion
and not rob the harmless fiylitrh of too many of his festherexl friends.
The pigeons really nonaume more than they produce, so that their
ewaouragemeat by the tei1tria is rightly regarded as a serious
mistake in their husbandry.

Those who am interested in Egyptian agriculture may utuise
the. opportunity of an unfavourable wind to go ashore here. Fot..
merly convent after convent occugiad this district, and the gardens
of the. monks, Mcoxding to Makrizi, made, it possible for the tra-
veller to walk continually in the shade. A few convents still remain,
such as the Der ev-Rifch (W. bank}, on the slope of the Libyan
hills, 8 M. tn the S.W. of Assiiit, with the mum of Tums, son ot'
Rahoteg and commander of the archers, and other ancient Egyptian
graves. The insesrlptrous pzove that Shaswhotcp, the capim of the
Hypaelite Dome, lay in this vicinity, and it may perhaps be identi-
fied with the modem Shujzbt Of the Christians who raided here in

The banner need not break his journey betwean Mam; sud
Akhmim, as even the antiquarian will derive little prolit ftom the
scanty remains on this part of the rivar. Waamh, neatly opposite
Assiil,t, perhaps occuyles the site of the ancient Conlralyaopom. In
the Gebel Rokhém, to the E. of the villages of cLGhorébiyeh ind

cultural town on the W. bank with 10,800 lnhab. sud a small har-
boar N1ed with Nile-boats, lies in the ancient Hypselite name; The
present name is probably derived from the conversion of tha ancient
Emtian Mme 21a-abeti into the siraiHr1rsoamrtng Greek meme of
'Aro8ixn (Apetheke; Coptic Tapothyke), Le. Storehouse, an ad..
mlnble name for the chief town of , district so fertile in grain.
Among the Hellenaa it was generally known as Abotit.

reck-tombs without inscriptions. On the W. hank follow the mall
steamboat-atations Sadfeh and Temeh.
