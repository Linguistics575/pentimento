mum, On the West Bank lay the Noampolil or City of the Dead,
connected with which were a large number of temples. These lattar
are called Memnonia, humus: they wens dedicated to the memory
of the lives and deeds of tha gum: Pharaohs, and because they wens
regurdacl as the abode of the dead monarchs, and "ttriileeit were
offered within them to the royal mamas and to the gods, to whom
tbs kings owed their might, Built on the verge of the uaoropo1is,
they stood in close relation to ths worship of the deadh Just as
