19. The Mortuary Temple of Seti I. at Kmah.

Second Day on the W. bank: 1. Temple of guunm; 2. Tomb: of the
Kings (Bibi!) ei-hiuNtV, 3. Necropolis of ei-Abaatf and of Drah Abu‘l-
Neggnh; l. Dér el-bnhri.

To the W. bank as on the previous day, see p. L52, From the
landing-place M the ferry we ride across the i1s1ds in a northerly
direction and in I/s hr. reaoh the handsome ‘Tmple, the front of
which with its columns is visible at a considerable distance. The
original building (see the annexed plan) was of smaller dimensions
than the Rameeseum end Medinet Habu, its mmsphstrs length being
518 ft., and of this oniy the actual sanctuary with its halls and
chambers, 153 it. in t1epth remain, while then are only scanty
mmaine to prove the format existence of two Courts and the Pylon:
which enclosed them, The Sphinx“ which were placed like 5mm
dime to the right and left of the door leading into the firirt Court
on the inside, are half covered with earth. They Were Placed there
by Seti L, and on the bases were inscribed the names of all the
nations which he had conquered. Of all the buildings in the Necro-
polis of Thebes, this one most reminds us ofthe Memnouium ofAbydoa
(p, 54), and a sloset inspection of the style of inscriptions and re-
presentations win both bring out and explain their similarity, for
the temple of Knmah was founded by Seti L, the builder ofAhydos,
and both the sanctuaries were restated and completed by Ramses l1.
They both served the same purpose, as a plave where the menu of
the founder might be remembered, and offerings made. At Ahyxioe
it is true that throughout attention was paid to the pilgrims to
Osiris, while here it is the gods of Thehee that were promi-
nent, and this was; the centre of the festival of the mountain valley,
