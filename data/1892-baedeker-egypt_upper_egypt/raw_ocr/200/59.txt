" Boat: I. BENIHASAN. From Cairo

in its Egyptian counterpart f. Tha aylamtta of Banihasau consist,
likn the Dorie, column, of a basis, an octagonal or eixuNm-a1ded
ahait with 16 or 20 thates, a capital, and an abacus. The echiuus
or chymatium is, however, wanting. While the swelling or entuis
on acme Doric columns, and also the annuli " rings at the top of
tha shaft, hue hitherto met with no 8aftre,ient explanation, the
same features appear as natural and netsssary parts of tha sis-eau"
‘plant column' (:ngpr The architects of the Nile aimed consciously
st a reproduction of the stem of * plant, and as the capitals repre-
sented a hunch of bad)! it was natural that the cards which fastened
them should not be absent. Their number is five; and the 3 or
5 annuli at the top of a Dorie column, anon eoualy explained as in-
cisions made for the ropes used in hoisting it to Its place, are
simply an inheritance from the Egyptian column The idea of the
anuuli, as of the entire Dorie, column, is of Egyptian origin, though
the perfect Greek column, with the beautiful utu1sitiotrmiembet
formed by the echinus, ls far from a mere imitation. The Greek
column has become an entirely new form, animated by a nsw prin-
ciple player to itself, which has thoroughly mastered tha hetero-
geneous elements from without and blended them in a new unity.’
In farther emphasis of the importance of these columns in the hr.
story of art, we may remind the reader that the earliest Darin col-
umns known to us date from about the time that the. Paamtikidae
(p. xxix') were not only allowing the Greeks to enter the valley ot
the Nile bat were inviting them to settle there, and that the col-
umns of Banihasan are 1500 years older than thUThe columns of
Benihaaan are indeed nothing more. than the Pillars in the Temple
of the Sphinx and tho Magtabu (Baedeker's Lower Egypt, pp. 365,
379) provided with tttatm, and chamt’ered edges.

The two tombs of chief interest, the farthest to the N., are easily
zetrogn%ri1 by the beautiful Polygonal equmnB at their entrances.
The donkey-drivers make directly for them, paying no attention to
the others. The numbering begins at the N. and.

Tomb 1. The exterior of the graham or vestibule is distim
guinhed by two tina octagonal columns, heuing a tut vault hewn
out of the rock. Font aixteen-edged commas, with narrow tinting,
stand in the interior of the tombathamber ami appear to bear the
three beautifully painted arches of the ceiling, whmh are hawn in
the form of ahailow barrel vaulting The eids-eoiurnrts touch the
right and left walls of the nearly squats chamber, in the rent a!
which opens a recast containing the statues (much dihpidated) of
the deceased anti his two wives. The usuat long shaft leading to
the bottom of the tomb and the chamber for the corpse at the and
