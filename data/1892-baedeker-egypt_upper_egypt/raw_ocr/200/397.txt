in hirsrog. Ll ho, on the W, hank, are the ruins of a small

temple of tho Amdtsriod, dedicated to Iain and Horus. The
name of Tamas 11L appem‘s here on some blocks built into the
walls. Straight in front of us rises an isolated mountain. The is-
land of Perth (3 M. from 1rort0, which we pass on 0111' right, is the

ancient Takompso, hiemg. 2;) e @: Ta-hem-so OOO),

described by Herodoms (II, 29). Here ended the territory of 12
schoinoi above 2liaphantims belonging to Isis of Philm, of which
mention is made on the stale of Philemon): in tho temple-court of
l’hilm (comp. p, 300).

On the W. bluik, opposite a dark mour1tain-pesk, lies the Temple
of chdinah, also called Temple of Maliara?ah, after the village of
Eshanhnh, which lies a little higher up on ths E. bank. Dating
trom the Roman period, its Greek and daytmstio inecriptions show it
to hive been dedicated to Serapis and Isis. It consisted of an en;
trance-hau (now destroyed) approached by a broad flight of 14 steps,
and of a main colonnadmi building, 40 ft. long and 50 ft. broad.
Part of the walla hag fallen; but 3 columns to the right and 2 to the

a boy with a. jug in his hands; above an thwe other gods. To the

which extends to lbrim. At Mehmdi, on the W. hank, are the ruins
of a Roman settlement. The mountains, especially on the E, be-
come higher. At Med& is a picturesque group of hills with groves
of palms. The river makes a wide band to the W., and we soon
come in sight of the temple of Satnysh, 27 M. from Dakkeh.
