There is a difference of opinion M to the Situation and Form of' the
Ancient Lake. _ Linent-Bey, arguing from the eonaiderable difference of
level between the two lakes, maintains that the Horus. p. M) could never have formed part of Lake Weris, as was
fermerly tsupposed, and he assigns to the letter emueh smaller area then
was attributed to it under the earlier theorr Placing it farther to the
Bah, nearer to the Labyrinth and ai-rash:, he makes its boundary-line
run mum the s.sw, uf 11e6tmstIFsytim to the Birket el-Gharag, and
intersect the men of 5mm Ahmed, where the ancient height of the water, which far exceeds the level attained in modern times, has left its
traces; it then leads to Kalmmha mm to m. R. to Da and then to
the E. and SE. to Dimidlttaeh, follows the embankment of Piuawdneh,
and passes 122mm ez'gawr nu: ma bridge of el-than (see below). Hence the
boundary leads by Dimmo towards the NE. to sum, and thence to the W.

eller to complete this circuit of the bed of the lake, which is now dried
up. Recently, however, Mr. Fiops Whilehnuae, relying upon the great
circumference assigned by Herodetus (u, IN) ) to the lake, of 3600 studio.
(reduced by Linant to 360) or about 3315 M. (Pliny says 23031.), and upon
measurements made by himself on ma spot, ascribes a. considerably larger
area to the lake than Linant, and maintains that it extended on the S, it is not improbable that in ancient times nearly the
whole of the Fnyam could be laid under water, so that even the Birket
1tHpyri1st belonged to Luke lmn'i, but that the entire system was meant
for the watering of the Bayilm alone and net of the Nils may or the
Delta. Considering that the bed of the lake must annually have been raised
by the deposit of File mud, it follows, that he soon as worn as the raising of the
embankment Â» and the removal of the mud were discontinued, the lake
must have become anservieeable, especially after the lock-gates at elLahiln fell to decay each opening of which, as Diodorus informs us,

water probably run through the Bahr Belts M51, which has already been
mentioned (1153), or through the Wadi Nezleh (p. 42), both of which
fall into the Emu erFumhs: The ancient conjecture, that the latter
discharged part of its water into me gammy (or, as Herodotus says, the
'Libyan Syrte'), was not an unnatural one.

A visit to the Pyramid of el-Latin or 11mm: is only interesting to
those who are desirous of convincing themselves of the truth of Linant's
hypothesis, and to make the circuit of the boundaries of the old bed of
the lake (see above). The pyramid, which is built of Nun bricks, may be
ranked from Erawhret el-gaeah in 4-6, or from the Labyrinth in M ham.

About'le M, to the E. of the pyramid of cl-Lamn, Mr. Flindere Pee
trio discovered a. temple in 1889, and close beside it the ruins of the town
2la-traerteseewhotep, now called Kahun. The latter was founded by Usertesen II. (12th Dyn.) for the labourers on his pyramid. Among the minim
found here were pottery, flint and upper implements of the 12th Dyn.,
numerous papyri of the same period, a etatuette of sSV8istrNr' Dyno,
