of the petty Egyptian kings by Peammetikh L (66 (4510 } In his
reign, according to the somewhat incredible story of Herodotus W,
30), 240,000 soldiers, discontented with the severity of their service,
emigrated to Ethiopia, where they settled near MoroE under the
name of Autemoles or Semhritee, and did much to rtsf1nty the menners of the Ethiopians. Peammetikh II. undertook an expedition
against the Ethiopians (Herod, IT, 160), to which references are
made in Greek and Phoenician inscriptions in the temple of Aime
Simbel (p 334). The stem at Berhel mention two other Ethiopian
kings, Irorvatef and Naatosem, whose reigns cannot be acturately mud. The former reigned for forty years, waned against the
Rehrem and Madia, African tribes of Duttr and Abyssinian, and
erected temples; of the letter we learn that he was solemnly crowned
in the temple of Nepete.

The early royal residence Nepeta now began to decay, and
Berna (Meme) near Begerewiyeh became the capital of the Etihiopians. From Diodoms (III, 6) we learn that under Ptolemy Philedelphus a king of the name of Ergamms shook himself free of the
itti1uemsty of the priests and caused them to be massacred in the
golden temple. This can hardly be the same Ergemenee whom we
meet at ankeh (p. 316), for the latter does not seem to have
flourished until the time of the Rams!) emperors. During the Ro,
man period, an Ethiopian invasion of the Thebs'id led to the campaign of Patterning (25133.), in which Napeta was destroyed. Queen
Candace made peace with the Reman general (Strebo XVII, 54).

Towards the close of the 3rd cent Ad). the country above Phuse
was devastated by the Blemmyes, a ilertMy Nubien tribe dwelling
between the Nile and the Red See, who carried their degradations
even into the Roman territory beyond Aesuen. To restrain them
the emperor Diocletian summoned the tribe of the Nobadcs from
the oasis of eluKhirgeh (p, 348) to the Nile valley, and settled them
in the district from Elephantine upwards, while the temples of
Phila were assigned as common sanctuaries to them and to the
Blemmyes. In spite of the aid of the Nobadee, the the towns of
the Commititium Romanum (Prime, Phantom, Khiris, Taphis,
end Tennis ] fell into the hands of the barbarians, who made Talmis
(Kelabeheh, see p. 307) their capital. In the 4th and 5th cent.
they ravaged the Thebe'id, so that in 451" A.D. Maximinus, the
general of the emperor Marcian, was forced to conclude a peace on
unfavourable terms for 100 years, which, however, only lasted until
the death of the general. Between 530 and 550 end 550 the Nebula: were
converted to Christianity; and Silica, one of their kings, damned
the Blemmyes. His victory is recorded in a Greek inscription
found in the temple of Kalabeheh (p. 308). Christianity gredu-n
ally invaded the temples of Nubia; and the Nobed king Eitpanomas and Bishop Theodorus (p. 283) of Phila, exterminated paganiem. But not long afterwards Ethiopia, like Egypt, an into
