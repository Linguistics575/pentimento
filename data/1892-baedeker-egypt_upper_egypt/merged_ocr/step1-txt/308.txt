The tomb between the two lm-memme elongs to a lady named swam,

farther is the ancient Roman fort of JWitm, on which large vultures frequently perch. In 20 min. more we begin to mount the hill with the
tombs. There are altogether eight tombs, of which only the "tin to the

Edfu is a steamboat-statiOn. The Mail Steamers arriving on Tues and

Those who travel in their own dhahabtyeh should spend two days at
Edfu, bringing their provisions from the boat to the temple. Egyptologists,
who may find material to occupy them here for days and weeks, will obtain,

The way to the temple leads almost due W. from the landingplace, then, turning to the N. (right), skirts the Canal of PAN and
