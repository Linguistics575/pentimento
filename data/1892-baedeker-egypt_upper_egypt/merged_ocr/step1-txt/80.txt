Summon AND HISTORY OF THE Bugtu, In the great plateau of the
Libyan oearrt, which rises 300-400 ft. above the sea-level, is situated the
province of the Emma (from the anciem Egyptian Wtdum', u mush or
lake district), Hm hrs: or he hues (p. M3), which is usually considered
to belong to the valley of the Nile, and is justly celebrated for its extraordinary fertility o. J, This tract is in the form of an oval basin,
840 eq. M, in area, and supports a population of 2007000 souls; it is encloaed
by the Libyan hills, which are here of moderate height, and lies about
three-iiftha of a. degree to the B. of Cairo. It enjoys a remarkably the
climate, and has but rarely been visited by the plague. This'Und of
mees' is still one of the most beautiful parts of Egypt, and more than
my otherlrart of the Nile valley deserves the well known epithet of'the
gift of the Ue', bestowed on Egypt by Herodotus, as it is entirely indebted
for its fertility to the waters of the Nile with which it ls tsrtiiieia11y irrigated.
The Batr fw (p, 28), e ehannei 207 IL in length, which is more probably
a. natural branch of the river, artibs1a11y adapted, than a mud, diverges
from the Nile to the N. of Assi'tit, and flows through a narrow opening in
the Libyan chain into the Fayam, where it divides into numerous
ramifUatioru, abundantly watering the whole district. One of its hrwehee
runs tewards the N., skirting the E. slopes of the Libyan him At the point
where the Bah: Yumf mum the Fsyuhn, the district forms a plateau of
moderate height, descending towards the W. in three gradations towerda
the Birket eHruriin, a long: narrow lakes, extending from S.W. to ICE.
On the easternmost and highest part of the oasis the Labyrinth and
Luke Mari: (pp. 39, 40) were once situated; the central part yields the
luxuriant crops for which the province is famous; while the westernmoat part tshiefly consists of sterile desert land. To the W. and N. of the
Birket ssH, rattin rise precipitous limestone hills, beyond which lies the
immense sandy desert of aways. The hymn must have been reclaimed
from the desert ata very early period, probably during the early empire,
in the reign of Amenemha IIL, as monuments of his period indicate
that he was perhaps the flrst of the Pharaohs who sought to regulate
the whole course of the Nile. On the Upper Nile Prof, Lamina has
found Nuamatera hunsmmd try um manhrch, and in the Feyfima on
the me of the Labyrinth, a number of blocks of stone inscribed with his
name: The Greeks chum him Ameris, or Macm }, and believed that the lake
known to them ", which they regarded as a marvel of
engineering skill, was named after him. The word mart, however, is
the Egyptian for take or overflow, so that the great basin of the F-ydm
was simply'the lake'; and it was from his exertions in connection with
the irrigation works that Amenemha obtained the name of Marie. We
lalm from a. papyrus roll heating of the
Irayiun, that the province was known in the time of the Pharaohs as Ta
abet, or the lake-land, or the mm; and, and mat Luke Maria was called hun-t, signifying
the discharge or posterior lake. On its bank rose the celebrated Labyrinth, which was probably renewed by the Bubastite monarchs of the
22nd Dynasty. About the same period the town of Crocodilopolis, smurf
ed on Lake Maria, the wife of Pto.
lemy Phfhsdelphms, was so extended and embellished by Osorkon I. that
it in culled the'city of Oacwkon L' in tho maniptiqn f' tts, nu Med
