bear the same name. The fegedee of the most important of them are
partly uncovered. The street of tombs, which is now accessible, presents the appearance of nuume covered with masonry, manned with
stucco, and provided with ante-chambers. The mouth of each tomb is
towards the E.; the leaning external walls are generally of Nile bricks,
richly embellished with the linear patterns which afterwards formed the
favourite decoration of the sides of the semephegi (which were imitations of the tomtr-ftrpBdeO. The vestibule "in most cues wmparm

wall of the corridor leading to the tomb-ehember, we see the deceased
in a sitting posture, and on the right wall he is represented standing,
with his wife behind him. Adjacent are men and women presenting
omsrinp, M in the maetabes of Ti and Ptahhotep. The flesh-tint of the men
is red, and that of the women pale yellow, and thia circumstance, especially in a monument of this early period, is important as tending to

with a pattern. Although the boilers contained one colour only, it is
said to have imparted several different tints to the stuffs dyed in them.
- In order to impart a durable colour to the larger Mises represented
here, an entirely unique process was employed. The outlines were engraved on the mug while the surfaces enclosed by them were divided
into deeply incised squares, which were filled with emcee of different
