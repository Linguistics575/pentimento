second row begin with kneeling chiefs from the Shah, who are
followed by white-clad Ethiopians with rings of gold, panther-tskins,
a giraffe, and oxen. The last have unusually variegated hides, and
each has a brown and a black human hand most singularly flared on
the points of its horns, The inscription above this procession runs:
'the great ones of Kush (Ethiopia) speak, Hail to thee, king of
Egypt, sun of the foreign peoples. We shall breathe as thou pera
mittest and shall live according to thy pleasure'. In the third row
brown and black chiefs from Kush bring gold and precious stones,
and semicircular fans of ostrieh-feathers, of exactly the same shape
as the fiabellum which now shades the pope on contain solemn
occasions and which was formerly used by the Pharaohs, Att ox
with artificially bent horns, between which is a pond with Nh
and bushes, should be noticed. The fourth and fifth divisions are
much injured. They show bright red persons (1ilrsthrayams who
dwelt between the Nile and the Red Sea), Egyptians, and very light

On the rear wall to the right (a) appears the king (new the
corner pillar), with Hui before him. q-mth Amenhotep, another prince
of Rash, is bringing pieces of Iapisr-1azuri on a dish. By his right
hand hangs a breast-plate, set with precious stones, like that were
