Two main routes lead to the oasis of Siwah. One, beginning at Alexandria, leads to the w. along the Mediterranean coast via the *Atabet
e-/joirlutr (Katabathmus Parvus) co mans near Barman (the ancient Pa.rietbnium), in 80-90 hrAs, travel spread over 10-11 days, and there turning
to the S. reaches Siwah in 5 { lays at 62 hrs. more. This was Alexander)
the Greet's route, and was also taken by Browne (see above) In 1792. Or
the traveller may follow the Mediterranean coast for 4 days more to the
ugmc el-Kebtr (Katabathmus Major) near Bir cum. and there turnin F,
reach Siweh in 5 days or fri hm more. This was Minuteli's route in 820.
The second main route, starting from 12mm or from Cam. man via
the Natron Convents to Siwah, in about 13 days (Homemun 1758), while
the Mst route takes 15-20 days. One route is usually taken for the
journey out, the other for the return. Pr. Cailliaud reached saw }; in 1819
from the Fayiim in 16 days, vii Rages », tl-Perm, and el-Karah, but the
hostile natives permitted him to pay but one visit to the monuments. In
the following year (1820) Mohammad'Ali despateheil a military force with
artillery, which reduced the hitherto independent Siwah under the authority of the Pasha of Egypt. Droeetti and Ricci aceom enied this expedition,
Gerhard Rows m: twice mum the oasis; in 183 on his journey from
Tripoli to Alexandria; and in Feb, 1874 in the course of an expedition
undertaken along with Jordan, Zittel, and Amharic", at the expense of Ir
ma" n Pasha. This expedition Martin from Atv3iti.t proceeded via Fardfrah
and hal, then struck W. to 2704, where they turned to the F, reaching Small in "days. The return was made via Farifrnh, Dana, and
ebdrluirgeh to the Nile. Unfortunately this costly expedition had not secured the services of an Egyptologiat, and even their photographer Ro,
melé wan left behind at Dtkhet, so that it has contributed little or nothing
to our knowledge of the inscriptions at Mwah. We have on the other hand
very full information coneemin the temples at er-Kurs) from Cailtiaud,
Rabi. Hay, and H. Brugsch (187 y, to which also the photographs taken by
M. Remelé at Dtrkhel and Khargeh have largely added. The inhabitants
of the oasis of Btwah speak a peculiar dialect, of which Minutoli has
communicated 400 words. Herodotus (H, 42) mentions that the Ammonites are colonists from Egypt and Ethiopia and speak a dialect midway
between the languages of these lands. They understand a little Arabic,
but their own speech is a dialect of Tamasirht, a Berber tongue, under »
stood in the Atlas and elsewhere in N. Africa,,

(cg. the N, wall of Medinet Hahn), and also on coins of the Ptolemies.
