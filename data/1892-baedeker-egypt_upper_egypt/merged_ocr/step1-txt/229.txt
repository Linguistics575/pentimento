168 Route 14. THEBES. West Bank:

portion of the Ramesseum am in a very ruinous condition, but their
arrangement may be partly made out.

Behind the Ramesseum especially towards the nw', are the remains
of a number of extensive jirick Buildings, some of which were erected in
the time of Ramses IL, as we learn from the stamps on the bricks. Among
the rest are some wel1-eongiraebed vaults. As the tomb of Ramses II.
has been discovered at 331m sst-Merud1; tp. Am, there can he no question
of his grave being here. On the other hand we learn from the papyrur
rolls that a celebrated university and a seminary for scholars, comparable
to the Museum at Alexandria, were connected with the Ramesseum, and
stood at the zenith of their prosperity under Ramses and his son Mereapteh. The lightFoared soil, strewn with fragments of bricks and tiles,
between the Ramesseum and Shékh'Abd _e1rFurptrh, covers a multitude of

raves whose existence is undreemed of by those who walk over them,
ne o these, belonging to a certain Ham, contains some interesting representations, the style of which indicates (for no king is named) that n
dates probably from the early empire, and is certainly not later than the
beginning of the 18th Dynasty. We may therefore conclude that Ramses IL
built his votive Memnonium on an ancient portion of the Theban neeropolia.

About 500 paces to the N. of the Memnonium we observe the
remains of an extensive well built of Nile bricks. The name of
Tutmee III. found here on many tiles renders it probable that a
temple built by this king or dedicated to him stood on this site.

M, The Tombs pf 1h1rmstaalrurra" i,

Travellers who are not pressed for time should visit one of the
tombs of Ifurntyt-Murrai' (viz. that of Hui), on the way to MedinetHahu. On reaching the fields of W. Thebes, if we look towards the
Libyan mountains, our eye falls upon numerous tomb-tyntranetys,
The vaults of the Diospolites of the zenith of the ancient empire
arehewn in the limestone hills that bound the plain of Thebes to the
W. They have recently been ilursii1tyd in groups, bearing the names
of the felleh-villages in whose domain they lie. The tombs on the
slopes behind the Ramesseum are called those of Shékh'Abd eluKumeh. Following thence the undulating desert region at the foot of
the Libyan hills in a S.W. direction towards Medinet Habu, we
soon pass, on the right, the gorge of Der tsl-Madinah, and then
direct our way towards the mountain-slope, projecting between the
Rameeseum and Medinet Habu. This slepe, on which stand so me
fame hats is known to the guides as Xumet Hmei. Several of
the tombs here date from the 18th Dym, but the majority are of no
interest to the ordinary traveller. Only one, to which the guides
conduct travellers at once, is of exceptional interest (though recently
much injured), on account partly of the subject and partly of the
vivid colours of the representations it contains. Near the village
(the dogs of which are cross-grained though cowardly) is a tomb
partly converted into a stable by the fellihin. In the adjoining
tomb of Irortrdrliemtt' are some hieroglyphics, of interest only to
the tteientifle traveller .--Then follow: the flmist tomb in the necropolis, belonging to a certain Hui, who held the high rank ofaprinee
