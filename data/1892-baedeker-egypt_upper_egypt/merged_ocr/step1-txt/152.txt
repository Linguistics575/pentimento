here from a very early period was Khem Min (Vol. L, p, 138), whose wife
was called Isis, and son Horns. Osiris also had a. burial-place here
(He nub'Gold house'), in which a part of his body (called gab) was

reservetl. The book of magic, the search for which is narrated in the

emetic romance of 5mm, was sunk in the Nile at Koptos. A medical
leather-roll found at Keptes, and now in the British Museum, is said to
have been written in the reign of Khut'u or Cheapo (m Dyna.) Kopm
was fortified as early as the 12th Dynasty, for the wealthy city and eth
routes leading to it required to be'ii" the warlike tribes
who lurked between the Nile and the Arabian mountains, and who, even
antler the Roman emperurs, were a source of danger. Guards were
especially necessary at this point, for there is no doubt that a considerable
number of Phcenician merehanta had settled in Koptos at a very early
date along with the Egyptians, and were engaged in importing the products
of Arabia, and at a later date even those of India, which were conveyed
Via Arabia to the Egyptian Red Sea ports afterwards called Berenike and
Leukos Limen, and thence across the desert to the Nils. The green

state that the population of the town was mixed, containing both Egyptian
and Arabic (ke. Semitic) elements. The hieroglyphic name of the town

also occurs with the po", which is only used

after the names of foreign places or of places in which foreigner » were
conspicuous. The reports of Platereh, Emu, ate, concerning the strange
culta at Koptos farther indicate that a considerable Semitic community
dwelt in the town, and was regarded with hostility by their Egyptian
neighbours. Elian'a statement that the inhabitants of KoIivtos worshipped

Seaman The true Egyptians revenged themselves by throwing an use
from a rock (as Plutareh narrates), because Typhon (Beth) was red-haired
and of the colour of an ass. Red-haired men (and many red-haired
Semitea are represented on the monuments) were dab ised, and like all
foreigners were stigmatized as'Typhtmie', Many non- gyptians are commemorated at the sides of the traile-route from the Red Sea to Knptos;

The camp of the Beduina, who hired their camels to the caravans
and escorted them through the desert, must have anciently existed within
the circuit of the town. These Arabs appear to have been the insstigators
