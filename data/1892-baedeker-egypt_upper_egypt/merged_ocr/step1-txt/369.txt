style of the temple of Isis proper by the small portal in its E. wall
between the tirist row of columns and the second pylon, we see
about 50 paces in front of us the Chapel of Rather (Pi. Q), the
smallest temple on the island. That it was especially dedicated to
Rather we learn from hieroglyphic inscriptions

this chapel has no inscriptions and the ruins behind it indicate
