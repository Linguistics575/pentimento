is understood a fertile and inhabited spot in the midst of the desert. The
oases owe their fertility to the springs which rise in them, frequently
thermal and containing iron, sulphur, or other mineral ingredients. The
most abundant trees in the oases are the date-palm, mum ut various
kinds (Acacia Nilotica. or gunt~tree), apricots, and other fruit-treee; the
chief grain-erops ere wheat, barley, and rice, with a little dura (Sorghum
vulgare) and dukhn (Penicillaria sptcata); and indigo, tobacco, and cotton
are also grown (see Vol. L, pp. 63 seq.).

Seven oases are mentioned in the Ptolemaic inscriptions in the temple

at Edfu. According to Diimiehen the firat of these, Maw" Kenm, corre

Ni MOM travellers who wish to see an oasis will be stat'sMUrd with a.
visit to Khhrgeh and perhaps also to Dtskhel, for the visit to Siwah ire
valves, long and fatiguing journey. The latter, however, is also described below on account of its great historical interest.

For a visit to the oases a. caravan of riding m1 sumptervcamels is
necessary. Riding Camels or drnmedaries travel about 28 M. in P2 hrs"
0r considerably more if pressed (mlnp. DA 75); ordinary camels only about
19 miles. The camels should be divided imp convenient groups, and the
traveller should make sure that he has a comfortable saddle for his ride
of eight days or more. A tent, a generous supply of tinned provisions,
and water must also be provided. Water may be carried either in mks
Oermi0, leather skins (which, however, impart a disagreeable flavour to
their contents after a day or two), or still better in iron cuttere lined
with enamel fmsfma). The servtee8 ot u trustworthy carnvan-Ieuder should
be secured by application to a consular agent or other reliable authority,
and guns, powder and shot, and a supply of money in small coins and
Maria Theresa thelere should be provided. The traveller should avoid
displaying large sums of money before the Arabs, and he should be strict
in maintaining the discipline of the caravan.
