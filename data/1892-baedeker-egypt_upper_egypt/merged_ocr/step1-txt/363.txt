At the top of the left colonnade, next the first pylon, are some
demotic and hieroglyphic Decrees, of the Qiet year of Ptolemy Epiphanes, one relating to the celebration of the suppression of a revolt
end the punishment of the rebels, the other in honour of Cleopatra,
wife of Epiphanes. These inscriptions, of great tmitmtitle value
though extremely lightly and almost illegibly carved, were discovered
by Lepsiue in 1843. Unfortunately they have been much injured
