and to many other points, no one who has visited Philm will forget
this little temple, least of all it he have seen it by moonlight.

In the NE. of the island are the ruins of a village and of buildings
of various kinds. In the eeremexE. is a Roman Triumphal Arch (PI, bo.
with a lofty middle portal flanked by lower wings. The structure, wn
has we been taken for a city gate, men the E, us. the well-fortified
bank of the Nile. The s, wing is in good preservation but is somewhat
clumsy. Above it is a brick dome supported on sandstone consoles. It
is possible that Diocletian passed beneath the central arch when he
visited the sacred island of Philae. His name, at 311 event's, is to be
found on the blocks of sandstone scattered on the ground i,

Bigeh, called by the ancient Egyptians Fttttti tCh Smem-t, lying

opposite Philae, is the most easily accessible. It is reached in about
two minute from Phila, of which it commands a picturesque view,
as Philae does of it, with its bare rocks and ruined buildings. Bigeh
enjoyed a very early reputation for peculiar sanctity, and we'have
already seen (p. 294) that one of the symbolical sources of the Kim

The deities chiefly worshipped in the latter were the ram's-hsaded

which the modern Kenils may be compared, Among the pilgrims,
whose names are found on Bigeh, were several governors of Ethiopia, who were usually royal princes. The ruins of the Temple
visible from Phila, in which the name of Ptolemy Neos Dionysus
