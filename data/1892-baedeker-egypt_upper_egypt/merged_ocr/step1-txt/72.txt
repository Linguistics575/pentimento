here. The northernmost tomb (No. Cot Lepsius) shows us the king
and. his family standingen a diia, below which foreign captives
are depicted. The royal pair receives rich tribute. Those bringing
the gifts are Egyptians. At, to whom the tomb belongs, is adorned
with necklaces on account of the abundance of his contributions.
Numerous servants carry the sacks and bottles to the open cellardoor, in front of which, in a bending attitude, is a bailiff with a
stem It is possible that the cellar belongs to M, and that the gifts
are royal haunting to him. _ The next grave to the. s, on a projecting .hill, was excavated in 1883. It was destined for Mahu, a
commander of the royal police, and scenes from his life (Arrest of
mountaineers, Escort of the king's equipage, etc.) are depicted on
the walls of the tirisst chamber (esp. to the right of the entrance).
In the right Mde-wM1 is a door bearing a prayer in behalf of Mehu
to AteneRe (theradirting 801" dish). - The next tomb, that of
the royal Miieial Tutu, centains (to the right of the entrance) the
almost complete text of a hymn, sung by a priest in praise of the
sun:'The breath of the wind', says the hymn,'enters their nostrils,
and Thy gift it is that they have being. All flowers bloom and
grow in their beds, and they flourish at Thy uprising, Festal joy
arises at the eight of Thy countenance, All quadrupeds hurry along
on their feet, all the birds in their pests flutter their wings in joy'.
This tomb also possesses a'papyrus' column, of unusually careful
workmanship and elaborate ornamentation. The basis of the ca-,
pital is encircled, among the leaves, by a Ureeus-serpent; and at
the upper end of the shaft, below the riehiy-adorned band replacing the annuli are singular decorations consisting of sacrificial
gifts, including many birds in groups of ive. - To the 8., at a
little distance, lies the tomb designated by Lepsius as No, I. L This
also is dedicated to a high dignitary named Ai, perhaps the same
as in Tomb 3, On the tentrance-wall to the right is represented a
festival, which some interpret as that of an order, while others take
it for the marriage of M, fan-bearet and commander of cavalry, to
the royal nurse. The king, denoted by the disc, his wife, and his
daughters stand on a date. The eonrtiers, from the charioteers to
the military officers and fan-bearers, receive with deep obeisanees
the decorations which the Pharaoh, the queen, and the princesses
throw down to them. The foremost dignitary already wears six
necklaces, and the lady behind him is just adding a Mth to the
four she already possesses. A troop of dancers enlivens the proceedings by energetic leaps and contortione, and secretaries make
a note of the donations, To the S. are several other graves, including thaw oi Apii and Ramses, the latter a general and ehamberlain of Amehhotep Ill, To the N.N.W. of these tombs lay the huge
residence of the singular king Irhu-en-aten, which was perhaps
destroyed by the same generation that obliterated his name from
the eartoueheg.
