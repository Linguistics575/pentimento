"y-blue, light-green, and a light and a dark shade of red are the
prevailing colon"; but these were distributed according to conventional
rules, Although vegetable forms are imitated with admirable ftdelity,
the mine: did not shrink from colouring them with complete disregard
to nature, simply because ancient convention demanded it. Light-green
palm-twigs receive blue ribs, and blue fiowtsrs have blue, red, or yellow
petals, Below the alumni (m the shaft is a kind of band (found also else'
where), indicating that the vegetable forms surrounding the core of the
capital were suppoaed to be firmly bound to the top of the shaft. The
height and ornamentation of the lower parts of the ahefts are the same In
all the columns; but the capitals, some of which are beautiful palmetrpitals, are varied.

On the Ceiling are astronomical representations. The entire hall
bears the inscriptions of Ptolemy LE, Euargeten IL-Above the
door in the back wall leading to the promos is a long Inscription,
carved over the hieroglyphics by the Italian Expedition of 1841.
The Christian successors of the priests of Isis have cut numerous
Coptic crosses in the walls to signalize their appropriation of the
temple and to guard against the cunning malice of the heathen
deities. Christian services were celebrated in this hall, A Week
inscription in the doorway to the pronam, on the right, records
that the good work (probably the plastering up of the reliefs and
the preparation of the hall for Christian worship) took place under
the abbot Theodorus. This was in the reign of Justinian.

of the promos date from Ptolemy 11, Philadelphus. The First
Room (PL r) was adjoined on each side by others. That on the
right, now destroyed, was connected with a Second Room wr. s),
on the E. wall of which Philadelphus is shewn presentipg aim"
offering to his mother Isis. In the room to the left (PI, t), iiwvhich
the staircase to the roof starts, Philadelphus appears before Isis and
before Rather. The next room to the left is a dark chamber. Right
round the foot of the wall in the following wide Third Room (Pl. a),
immediately before the sanctuary, runs a list of names. The doors
on the right and left of this room admit to long, narrow, dark
apartments, perhaps used as Treasure-Chambers. The entrance to
that on the left (Pi, w) is about 2 ft, from the ground. The visitor
should enter, strike a light, and inspect the sculptures in this
chamber which resembles a huge stone chest. The lower part of
the well is smooth, as it was concealed try the treasures stored here;

adorned with elegant reliefs and inscriptions.
