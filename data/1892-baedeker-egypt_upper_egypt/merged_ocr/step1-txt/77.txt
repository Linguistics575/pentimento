The steamers and dhehabiyehs are met at et-Hamrah by donkey
boys with well-saddled donkeys and by sellers of pottery, which
can nowhere in Egypt be obtained better then here. The fine pottery
of Asaiiit, especially its bottles and pipe-bowls, is justly celebrated
and forms an important article in its export trade, which also deals,
in linen, embroidered leather goods, ostrich feathers and other products ot the Stsdtm, matron, soda, and corn. It has, however, lost
part of its commercial importance since the great caravans from W.
Africa have frequented other routes and places. Large trains of
camels still come from Dirftir and KordoGn, generally encamping
at Beni'Adin (p. 29), 19 M. to the NW. of Assitt, The vicinity
of Assiilt is one of the hest-cultivated districts in the valley of the
Nile, the fertile strip between the Libyan and Arabian Mts. here
attaining a width of 12 M. The province of Assitt, the mudir of
which resides here, contains 234 villages with 583,596inhaty, (incl.
the cases of Rhdrgeh and mad). Near the harbour are several large

the town lie the long government buildings. The streets are full
of busy life, especially on Sundays, when the people of the neighbourhood floek into the market. Oriental wares are cheaper in the
bazaars of Assiilt than at Cairo, but European goods are dearer. The
better houses are of burned brick, the meaner of tsun-dried Nile
bricks. The facades on the street are generally unimposing, but a
