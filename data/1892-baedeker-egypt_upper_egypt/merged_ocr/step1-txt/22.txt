NILE JOURNEY, xix

h. The Dhahabiyeh Voyage.

Though the voyage in a Dhahabiyeh demands much more time
and money than the steamboat-voyage, on the other hand it offers
the only means of a satisfactorily close examination of the country
and its monuments. A party of 4-5 persons will be found advisable,
especially as the expense is not much more than for 1-2 persons.

A large selection of good dhahabiyehe is to be found at Cairo,
on the left bank of the Nile both above and below the new bridge
at Bil1tlr. Travellers who take the train from Cairo to Kiss'tilt. should
despatch their boat from Cairo about a fortnight in advance, for
there are no good dhahabtyehs either "Assiiit or farther up at
Luxor and Asisutur, In Cairo the best dhahahiyehs are those belonging to Messrs. Cook & Son Che','mira','Homs','Hathor','Nephthis', end'Ammon-Ri, costing 1301. per month) or Messrs. Gaze &
Son ('choxlria','Chtopd,'mrodotut', and'Hope', 1103. per month),
Other good craft, with the monthly hire, are as follows:'Diamond'
(100L),'Eva' (8WO,'Admiral' (85t0,' (901.),'India' { each 9010,'Lotus' (TOC),'Alma','Manhattan'
(each 901.), and'Vittoria' (NV.).

These prices include the hire of the dhahatstyah and its full
equipment and the wages of the re'is or captain and the crew. For
the services of a dragoman, cook, and attendant, and for provisions,
saddles, and all the incidental expenses of excursions (excluding
bakehish), the price per day and per pers. is calculated thus: m

Cook Gaze Dragoman
Party of 2, each pers. 333. 358. 303.

- 3 - 283. 243.
- - 4 - - 248. 253. 20s,
- - 5 - - 225. 203. IN.
- - 6 or more, 203. 163. 163.

Thus for a voyage of 60 days from Cairo to Aswan am } back,
including the payment of a dragoman and all provisions (except
wine, ate), Cook charges 5905. for a party of5 (ale. 1181,. each perm,
or 393. 4d. each per day). For smaller parties, the cost per head is
considerably more. A three months' voyage in the'Manhattan' (the
property of a dragoman) costs 4851. for a party of t (Ce, "1029.
par day, or 323. (re, etch pars. per day). The inclusive charge for
Cook's excellent sttsam-dUhabhreh'Nitoeris' (5 berths) is 400i. per
month, a sum that will not appear exorbitant when the time saved
by steaming is taken into account.

Those who employ Cook's or Gaze'g dhahabiyeha are relieved from
all trouble in the matter of engaging a dragoman (quite indispensable to
the traveller who speaks no Arabic) or purchasing provisions. And there
are the addiUonts1 advantages that the store: of meat, fowls, vegetables,
and fruit can be replenished en route from the steamers, and that, in much
uf nud-winda, the small Steam Towing Launches belonging these s, f) rmlr,



may be hired for 6-81. per day.
