LOWER NUBIA
from Phila, to Wédi Ealfah.

217 M. The voyage from Phila: to Wadi { Iaifah was until about ten
years ago easily accomplished and formed an agreeable continuation of the
Nile-route, Travellers either mused their own dhahabiyehs to be towed
up the rapids (p. 273) or proeeeded in Cook's fortnightly tamar~scemm
Circumstanaes were, however, completely altered by the war in the Bildiin
and by the giving up of the region above Wadi Halfah in 1886. After that
date the only means of ascending the Kile to Nubia was offered by the
weekly government manner which conveyed the mails and military stores,
and performed the entire journey without stopping aaffieient1 long at any
intermediate point to allow of a visit to the monuments. In i 90, however,
Messrs, Cook and Son again started aweekly service of steamers between
the iitr" and second cataract. These'trtern-wheelertp (Smash, Ahkeh)
are small (12-14 passengers) and not very comfortable, especially when there
is a large party on board. The dining-tsaloon is over the stern-paddle,
the whim; are eonfhsed, and the commissariat limited, Ha"! are made
at comparatively few points, though it is possible to increase these by
arrangement with the engineer, if the passengers are unanimous. Zaptiyeh
or gens d'armes accompany the steamer to protect it, The voyage lasts

monuments both going and coming. The cost, including the towing of
the dhahabtyeh up the ttrat cataract, may be reckoned at about 1703. for
