who were, about 540 At, defeated by Silko, the Christian king of
the Nohedee (p. 302) who celebrated his victory in an inscription
on one of the pillars of the temple at Kalebeheh (see below).

The extent Large Temple was built under the Roman emperor
Augustus and his successors. The numerous inscriptions (in Greek,
with the exception of one in Latin Mummers ] am from the reigns
of Domitian, Trajan, Hadrian, and Anteninue Pius, and of the later
emperors Alexander Severus and Philippus; they express the raverence of the soldiers of the Spanish, Imman, end Theben cohorts
for the great god Mandulis.

Including the inner girdle-wall the temple is 235 ft, long and
117% ft, broad. There is also an outer giralo-wau, with small
temples at the NE. and SAM angles, Before the last stand the
columns one behind the other. The inner girdle-wall joins the
massive pylon, forming a continuous building with it. In front of
the pylon is a. narrow platform, necked by a Bight of steps beginning at the Nile, then by a gated passage about 10011. long and
25 N broad, leading to a second flight of 20 stays. The entrance to
the temple is blocked by fallen stones and the dwellings of natives,
who have settled all about the entire temple. In the interior of the
pylon are stairs and chambers, as at Edfu o. 244). On peesing
through the door of the pylon, which is not in a straight line with
the rest of the building but at a slight angle with the axis of the
temple, we 3ml ourselves in e fore-court, 65 ft. long, the floor of
which is quite covered with fallen blocks of masonry. Of the double
row of columns which once stood here, probably in h couples on each
side, only a single column, on the left side, is new area. On each
side of this court four narrow chambers have been constructed in
the well; and a. door on the right communicates with the exterior
passage round the temple. The walls of the entrance to the next
room retire towards the top in the manner of a pylon. Here on the
right the tatymytqmmt'itymyd decree of Bike is inscribed in bad Greek.
On the nearest column is a long inscription in the Ethiopian demotie character, hitherto ambwiphtsrtr6, which may perhaps be a replica
or repetition of the decree. [
