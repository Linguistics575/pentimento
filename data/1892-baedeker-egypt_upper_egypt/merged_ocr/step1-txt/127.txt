chambers, and the fragments of a staircase (to the right). This
building is dedicated to the birth of Home, with whom the son of
each successive monarch is compared. Similar Birth-Route, (Egypt.

[ :1.
pa-mes), called by Champellion Memeisi (Capt,'plaee of

birth'), occur in many other Egyptian temples (As, 253, 289, am).
The eartouehes of Autokrator Kisres, which Hathor presents to Borus Sam taut, have been supposed to refer to Augustus; but the
fact that the latter had no son makes this very doubtful. The'birth,
house' also contains the names of Trajan ard Hadrian to whom it
probably owes its existence. The paintings represent the can of
the young Horus, who is nursed and ministered to by goddesses and
women with cows' heads. - We now proceed to the temple, either
by ascending over the heaps of rubbish, or by returning to the N.
gate and walking thence in a straight direction.

"Temple of Hathor at Denderah.

This interesting and mueh-admired building was dedicated to
Hathor, the Egyptian Venue. The Portico (P1. E), which is sup
ported by 24 columns, is 139 ft. in breadth, Each of the columns
has a capital formed of four heads of Rather, with _ ears,
surmounted by a house, in reference to the meaning of Hathor,
Hat (re, house) of Horus. The columns next the entrance show
an open door. The six column! in the front row, three on each
side of the entrance, are united by balustradee. The rubbish round
the temple reaches to the balustrades in front and nearly to the
roof on the E. side; hence the floor of the temple appears sunken
and is reached by a flight of wooden steps. Originally, however,
the temple stood level with the ground, and its present appearance, like that of the temples of Esneh and Edfu, is due to the socumulntsd rubbish of centuries. In accordance with the plan of
other temples, a eolonnade and a pylon should stand in front of this
portion; but perhaps the means to add these were not forthcoming.
The date of the temple is given by a Greek inscription of three
lines, which runs round the cornice on the exterior of the building
and reads as follows:
