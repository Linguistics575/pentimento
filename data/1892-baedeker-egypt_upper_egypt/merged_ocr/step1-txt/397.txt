in hiereg. LI Q, on the W. bank, are the ruins of a small

temple of the Rieman period, dedicated to Isis and Horus. The
name of Tamas 11L appem's here on some blocks built into the
walls. Straight in front of us rises an isolated mountain. The island of Derar (3 M. from Korti), which we pass on our right, is the

ancient Takompso, hierog. 2;) ti? Ta-kcm-so (600),

described by Herodotus (II. 29). Here ended the territory of 12
sehoinoi above Elephantine belonging to Isis of Philas, of which
mention is made on the stale of Philometor in tho temple-court of
Phila, (comp, p. 300).

On the W. bank, opposite a dark mom1tairi-peak, lies the Temple
of Ofedinah, also called Temple of Maliara? ah, after the village of
Maharakah, which lies a little higher up on the E. bank, Dating
from the Roman period, its Greek and demotic inscriptions show it
to have been dedicated to Serapis and Isis. It consisted of an en;
trance-hau (now destroyed) approached by a broad flight of 14 steps,
and of a main colonnaded building, 40 ft, long and 50 ft. broad.
Part of the walls has fallen; but 3 columns to the right and 2 to the
left of the entrance still stand, besides 8 columns in the interior.
In the innermost corner, to the right, are traces of a staircase
leading to the roof. A wall connects this temple with a smaller
equate structure to the K, on which is a curious representation:
beneath a fig-tree (Eapasuxdywog whence the Greek name of the
place, which was perhaps named Penubs in early Egyptian antiquity) sits a goddess with cow's horns (1sismathor), before whom is
a boy with a jug in his hands; above are three other gods. To the
left of this scene is Thoth with tho ell; beneath is Isis.

The route now lies between monotonous hills. At 8eptteh we
reach the boundary between Widi Kemls and the Wddi el-'Arali,
which extends to Ibrhn, At Mehendi, on the W. bank, are the ruins
of a Roman settlement. The mountains, especially on the K, become higher, At Medik is a picturesque group of hills with groves
of palms, The river makes a wide bend to the W., and we soon
come in sight of the temple of Siytstfah, 27 M. from Dakkeh.

The Temple of SeM'uh. - Et-8ebigait Dr Sebmxh (the lions) or
wed: Seba'ah is the site of a temple dedicated toAmmon and Ptah by
Ramses IL, and constructed like the temple at Gerf Eugen, partly try
excavation in the rock, partly by building. The name is apparently
derived from the avenue ot Lions or Sphinx" in front of the temple.
Eight ofthese lions with human faces are supposed to have been ranged
on each side, though only the two first have retaine their heads. A
