preserved here. The roof of the First Room is supported by two
Ptolemaic columns, with Hathor-mashs on the abacus. To the right
and left of this wide hall are two rooms, and behind are three
others, the middle one of which gives access to the Sanctuary. The
inscriptions on the walls owe their origin to the Ptolemies; the
earliest, as the i1asditrati'pn-inseription also informs us, to Ptolemy IX.
Euergetes IL, and to Cleopatra, his sister and wife. The pregnant
hippopotarmts-godilisss Apet was the goddess of births. Her f1msly
executed statue of serpentine, found in the ruins of the ancient
city, is now in the museum at Gizeh. It dates from the 26th D nasty. The inscriptions and.'representations refer largely to Osiris,
whose birth was commemorated here, and to the gods associated
with him. On the outside of the templemwajl and on the walls adjoining it are found the names of Ptolemy Auletes and the emperor
Augustus. A list of homes, also found here, is unfortunately much
damaged..

rapid riding We proceed' tiret to the E, tSphinx-avenue of Karnak, where
the road diverges to the right, along a large embankment. It then turns
to the left and runs mostly along the edge of ditches, frequented, especially
in December, by wild fowl.

The Temple' of 3Odarthrst, at one time a large and beautiful eirifless, is
now so completely ruined that even its ground-pam cannot be traced. The
village, a kind of suburb of Thebes, Was called Teman and lay to the N,
of the temple. Month of Thebes was the god ehiefly worshipped here, but
Buto (uazi) and Apet were also revered. Um erection of this temple dates
from the time of Amenhotep IL, of the 18th Dynasty. His name occurs
on the large granite'pillars which are still standing and which probably
formed part of the Sanctuary. Numerou's blocks of granite lie scattered
around. The sanctuary was adjoined by a large siitfco, lying approximately from E. to W. Much farther to the W. was a Pylon, facing the
river, but now destroyed, leaving nothing bat a heap of blocks of trandstone. Various fragmentary inscriptions in a good style inform us that
it was built by Set": T, and Ramses IL Under the Ptolemies an addition
was made to the earlier temple, including the Colonnade, which is now
the most conspicuous and most interesting feature of the ruins. Five
columns are still standing. Four of these, on which still rests the etene
architrave, appear to have bounded a now destroyed peristyle court and
to have formed the first row of columns in a hypostyle hall, which cannot
have existed before the time of the Ptolemies. The Other mlnmn is the
only relic of the second row, Both this end the two bud-columns (to the
left) in the em row appear to belong to Â£11616": Dim; Has two latter
certainly did, for their sculptured shafts and capitals clearly indicate that
the artistic idea which dictated their form still retained a vigorous
freshness at the time of their erection. On the other hand the late eleborate plastic decoration of the ealyx-etrpita1s of the other two columns
more to the right, the curious closing of the intercolumnietions by mum
of barrier-like wells, half as high as the shafts, and crowned with a concave
cornice, and the treatment of the doors, whose absent covering was merely
indicated on both sides h erections with mucus cornices, would in themselves be proofs that the uilding was not erected before the epoch of the
Ptolemiee, even if the inscriptions did not contain the same information.
Bees have built their nests in many of the deep 1siisrrsg1yphiixs Which com
