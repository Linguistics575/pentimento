Mounting to the left of the tomb of Rekhmari we reach (to the
left of No. 48) a lately discovered tomb, rather difficult of access.
The trouble of the ascent, however, is repaid by the beauty and
freehneee of the paintings, It belonged to Sen-nefer (good brother),
superintendent of the southern city, overseer of the grannies of
Ammon, and superior of the flocks of Ammon, under Amenhotep II.

the tribute of me Asiaticg jars, a carriage, a white and a brown horse,
and various weapons. In both corners of the vestibule were aides. of

Ba in the name of the deceased. On the right-hand side of the long "'"
sage into the hill is a scene illustrating the chase of waterfowl.

To the right close to No. 51 is the tomb of Amen-em-heh (No. 36)
known to Champollion and described by Eben and Stem. It coneiste of two halts one behind the other, of which the length is at
