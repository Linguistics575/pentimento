Alexander had made himself master of Phoenicia. by the battle of Issus,

of the women and children and the palladia of the place, with the temple
of the god and the sacred spring; the third encloses the abode of the
spearmen, am A little beyond the castle another temple of Ammon has
been erected under the shade of numerous large trees. Near it is a spring,

in the morning, cold at midday, and hoe "midnight. The image of the
god is encrusted with emeralds and other gems, and gives its orecular
responses in a curious way. It is carried in a golden boat on the shaniders of eighty priests, who direct their course according to signs from the
god. Women and girls accompany the god with songs'.

When Alexander entered the temple he was hidden welcome by the
oldest priest in the name of the god. Alexander accepted the welcome
and promised to worship the god, if he gave him the lordship of the
whole earth. The king then naked whether all the murderers of his father had been punished, The oracle replied that no one could aim at the
