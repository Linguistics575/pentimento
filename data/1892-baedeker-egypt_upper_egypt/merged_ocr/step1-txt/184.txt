and sometimes scratching out older names. On the capitals the
cartouehee of Ramses II. or of his more immediate successors are
found; on the border of the extreme top of the shaft, this same
Pharoah is usually named king of Upper and Lower Egypt, lord of
both worlds, son of the sun, lord of the Madam Â», etc. The broader

twice; once saorifleing to the god, and once with the celestials
offering him emblems, generally symbolizing in some familiar way
one of the higher blessings of life. The simple inscriptio'tret
each other over and over again. They begin:'I give'lat pal
grant thee', or else mention a visit of the king to the temple. The
carvings and hieroglyphics placed by Ramses IL are much inferior

By far the most important place among the gods here is filled
by Amman, Math, and Khunsu, the Theban triad (Vol. L, p. 138).
At Karnak Amman was conceived of in two capacities, which must
be distinguished from each other; he was in the first place Ammon
Generator, in the second place Ammon-IG, the king of the gods.
Amman may be identified by his feather-crown, Khunen by the
crescent on his head and the lock on his temples, and Math by the

identified with the help of the introduction on the Religion of
Ancient Egypt (Vol. L, p. 124). On the arehitrave are some clearly
cut inscription, of which a few deviate from the usual formulae.
One of these, dating from Seti L, on the architrave above the budcolumns in the flrist crosswrow to the E. (right), is as follows: We

one place'. In the inscriptions the king usually boasts of having
erected an eternal and magnificent building in the house of his
father Ammon, of founding festivals, or of offering great treasures.
