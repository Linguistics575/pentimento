rinth, which was afterwards reckoned as'one of the wonders of the
world', was so vast as to surpass all the buildings of the Greeks taken
together and even the Pyramids themselves. For the beat description
we are indebted to Strabo, who visited the Labyrinth in person. He
am: "There aim the Labyrinth here, a work as important as the
Pyramids, adjoining which is the tomb of the king who built the Labyrinth. After advancing about 30-40 stadia beyond the am entrance of
the canal, there is a table-shaped surface, on which rise a small town
and efvast palace, consisting of as many royal dwellings as there were
formerly nomes. There is also an e mil number of ham, bordered with
columns and adjoining each other, a! being in the same row, and forming one building, like a long wall having the halls in front of it. The
entrances to the halls are opposite the wall. In front of the entrances
are long and numerous passages which have winding paths fuming
through them, so that the ingress and egress; to each hall in not
practicable to a. stranger without a guide. It is a marvellous fact that
each of the ceilings of the chambers consists of a. single atone, and
8.130 that the passages are covered in the same way with single slabs
of extraordinary size, neither wood nor other building material having
been employed. On ascending the roof, the height of which is inconeiderahle, as there is only one story, we observe a stone surface consisting of large slabs. Descending again, and looking into the halls, we may
observe the whole series borne by tWenty-seven monolithic columns. The
walls also are constructed of stones of similar size. At the end of this
structure, which is more than a stadium in length, is the tomb. cousin.

was the custom for all the names, represented by thair mhgmatam with
their priests and victims, to assemble here to offer mreritiee and gifts to the

then took possession of the hall destined for it. Sailing about a hundred

It is very doubtful whether we should consider these buildings
of Nile bricks as remains of the ancient Labyrinth, or rather as
tombs. Certainly nothing is left that recalls in any way the splena
dour of the old'wonder of the world', Except some blocks of limestone, nothing remains of the extensive structures once erected
here, save the pyramid'at the end of the labyrinth'.

To the N. of the pyramid Mr. Flinders Petrie discovered some mummy

dried up, was to receive the superfluous water in the ease of too high
an inundation, and to distribute its contents over the iieldty when the
overflow was insaffleuat. Strabo describes Lake Moeris in the following terms:'Owing to its size and depth it is capable of receiving the
superahundance of water during the inundation, without overflowing the
habitation, and crops; but later, when the water subsides, end after the
