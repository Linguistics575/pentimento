is a window, bordered on each side by two Hathzwmuke. Tiberius is

with mud. The early Christians, who perhaps used the second room for
pumasea connected with their services, have entirely plastered over the
heathen Inscription: there; while the highly interesting Representation: in
the third room have been left quite untouched. From these we learn that
the temple was intended to represent the Birth-Houne or Meghan, in
which the infant Horus i $ rak saw the light (similar buildings at Denderah,

with her right, King Ptolemy IX. Euhrgetea IL is depicted handing
to her two metal-mirrors'to rejoice the golden One with the sight of her
beautiful form', - These representations do not only celebrate the mystic
birth of the god, they refer also to the most beautiful and must responsible
duties of motherhood, which Isis, Rather, end. Nephthys undertake. Their
nursling appears indeed to be the infant Horns, but it is evident from
many a lusions, that the young Pharaoh, the heir to the throne of Ra,
was considered as the incarnation in human form of the young god, and
that these representations were meant to convey to the Ptolemies that a deity
had home and suckled them or their fhzt-born, and that the immortaL-s
had guided their upbringing with invisible hands. Cleopatra L, the mother
of the two brothers who caused the placing of this inscription, had acted
as guardian and regent especially during the childhood of Philometor, the
elder. She was the Isis of the young Horus. On the B. outside wail of
the cella a relief shows us Horus learning from the goddess of the N.
to play on the nine-atringed lute, while Isis superintends the lesson. The
shape of the instrument is Greek, and by the goddess of the north is
perhaps meant Hellenic music, which was cultivated even by the earlier
Lagidae. C _
