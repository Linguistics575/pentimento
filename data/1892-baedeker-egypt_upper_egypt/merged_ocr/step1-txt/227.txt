distinguished for the beautiful modelling of the kings horses dashing into the fight, and for the representation of the Asiatic fortress
of Tapura, which is stormed by the Egyptians on sealing-ladders,
while the defenders are hurled headlong from the hattlements. Several sons of the Pharaoh, the names of whom are given, distinguish
themselves in the battle. Two of these (towards the left) are depicted on a larger scale than the others, viz. Kha-em-us, the favourite son of Ramses, and Menth, prince of the blood, each of whom
is in the act of slaying an enemy. The younger princes, Meri-Amen,
Aman-era-as, Seti, and Setters-Rs, covered with their shields,
take part in the attack (below the fortress). Diodorus apparently
had this scene in his mind when he described the Egyptian army as
commanded by the sons of the king.

peculiar to the royal childish. Their left hands are raised, and their
