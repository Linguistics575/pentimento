24 Route I. TELL EL-AMARNAH. From Cairo

of them unfinished, and the colouring of the reliefs is sometimes in
wonderful preservation. The mummy shafts, in spite of their great
depth, have all long since been despoiled of their contents. In the
very first tomb we find a representation of the king and his family
offering a satrtfh3e to the sun's disc. The disc is encircled with
the Urams-snake and furnished with several arms, stretching downwards; the hands are symbolic of energy, liberality, and the creative
faculty. Dwarfs (then, as later, a favourite royal plaything), fanbearers, and bowing courtiers stand below, In front is the provostmartial with his baton. To the left of the first grave, on the hill,
is the Tomb of Penta (No. 2), which is in a very ruinous condition, Farther on to the left is that of RameriCNo, 3), with a f1nely
worked exterior. On the leftwallofthe second chamber of this tomb
is a military scene, which we do not hesitate to describe as the
most realistic representation found hitherto in any Egyptian grave.
The lean figure of the Pharaoh, above whom the sun spreads its
arms, stands in his war-chariot and driven the fiery steeds, the introduction of which Egypt owes to the Hyksos. Seis (out-runners)
with long staves run in front of the chariot, towards the crowd of
people offering gaeriiiety and bending to the ground in adoration.
Standardehearers and soldiers clear the way for the rapidly adveneing proeestsiort, jast "the mounted kavasses still do for the carriage
of the Khedive. The king appears once more followed by his
children, who also drive their own chariots. The procession hastens towards the royal palace, which covers the right part of the rear-wall
of the chapel and also part of the right wall, affording us a clearer
idea of an Egyptian palace than any other scene of the kind. It
has long been established that neither the royal princes nor even
the Pharaohs themselves lived in the temples. On the contrary
they used to build themselves airy Chateaux of light materials, with
doors opening on shady galleries and colonnades. Gardens with
fountains and water-basins surrounded the building, meat which
were also out-housea, stables, and well-stocked storehouses, in
quantity corresponding to the huge number of the dependents
of the royal family. The great entranee-i1oor is dignified with
double rows of bud columns, and red standards wave from lofty
flag-tstaffs. Above one of the eidedoors is a round window similarto
these which the French call auTitrreuf, The palace is adjoined
by a sepulehra1 chapel, supported by columns and containing figures
of the king's ancestors, honoured by rich saerif1eia1 offerings; at the
door is a choir, singing pious songs of remembrance to the accomw
paniment of the help, and taking its time from the hand-clapping
of the leader (a custom still preserved in Egypt) .--In the tirgt
chamber of Tomb 7 (right wall, p. 26) is a representation of the
Temple of the Solar Disc, with a large peristyle court surrounded
by e colonnade. Pillars resembling Caryetides decorate the walls,
and above all tower the lofty pylons with their hollow eornice.
