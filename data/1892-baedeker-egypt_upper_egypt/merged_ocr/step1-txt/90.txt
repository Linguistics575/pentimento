To the E. of the large temple are situated two smaller Roman temples,
in tolerable preservation, the larger of which, situated 300 paces from the
smaller, is not without interest. Its walls (18 ft, by 19 th) consist of
good burnt bricks, and its substructures of solid stone; the cells terminates in a niche resembling an apse; on each of the side-walls are
two half-columns, which, as the fragments lying on the ground show,
belong to the Ionic order. There are also some less important ruins
covering an extensive area, but nothing has been found among them
dating from an earlier period than the Roman The construction of the
walls, the architectural forms, and many coins found here are Roman;

inspection to be of natural formation. The paved court was 8111yrounded by a brick wall, and the temple itself contained several
apartments; a peristyle, with columns now in ruins, led to the entrance. Notwithstanding the imperfect state of the ruins, they
