Lathyrus, all contributed by works of restoration to prevent the
building which had been completed under Bataan from falling
into decay Both the style, and the inscriptions tell us that Dér el-,

New Empire. The size and simplicity of its parts, and especially
the polygonal columns are a sign to those who are familiar with

series of terraces, the successive stages being reached by steps
