18. The Tomb: of ghtkh'Abd el-Kurnah.

With this part of the Necropolis of Thebes, which may be reached
from Dér elaMedineh in 25 min., we conclude our first day on the W. bank
in our three days' plum Game's tourists make it their second day, Cook's
begin their third day with the Remeeeeum (R. 13) and the tombs of
'Abe elAfurash, as in our five days plan, The tombs to be visited may
be found without a guide. They are reached by ascending the Til, side of
the Libyan mountains in a direct line from the Ramesseum. Many of the
tombs here are inhabited by fe112Nm The sepulchral chambers serve
as dwts11ing-p1aees, wooden doors are hung in the entrances, and the
fore-court is often enclosed by a clay wall for the eonfinament of their
live stock. In front of most of these cave-dwellings stand covered eylinders like gigantic mushrooms, of N e mud and straw kneaded together. These are the primitive grannies "ma inhabitants of'Abd elKurnah, several of whom are we1i-ttrdo, with houses of Nile hricka, eonepieuoue from a considerable distance. Those who are desirous of staying
any length of time should make arrangements with the wealthy and worthy
Capt, Todrus, uncle of the German consular agent at Luxor. The erection of a house for travellers has been under consideration, and would
be of especial benefit to scholars by sparing them the daily journey to
and from Luxor. Shelter may be found in the house of Mohammad rAbtl
tsr-Rasi1l, provisions being brought from Luxor. Several European scholars have chosen'Abd-tIAN) as their centre for investigations on the
W. hank, among mam ammonia », Wilkinson, Lepeiue (whose lodging
in the tomb: is still known by the felliWtn es the xgw Lamina), Prisse
. iPAvennes, and Ebers. The visitor to the tombs must first face some
savage dogs, but he will he thoroughly repaid partly by the interest which
some of the tombs afford, and partly by the magnificent'View which is
obtained from those in the higher positions, especially at sunset. In this

art of the Necropolis of Thebes were buried the wealthy nobility of the
8th Dyn., upon whose tombs large sums of money must have been spent.
The inscriptions record that the deceased were in their life-timg invested
with the highest spiritual and temporal dignities and that they enjoyed
almost royal estates, their pride in which they show in sculptures and
inscriptions. However death is not forgotten in these tombs, for there is
no lack of funereal epitaphs. In almost all of them too we find genealogical tables, by which we learn that many of those buried here were
related to each other.

The more important tombs were numbered by Wilkinson, but most
of the figures have been obliterated. In 1885 Prof. Eisenlohr renumbered
the tombs, in all 197, including those with no inscriptions. In the following description' of the tombs reference is made to these numbers, which
appear in the adjoining small plan. If time in limited, it will be truthcient to visit the tombs of Khe-em-hat, Ramses, mun, Sen-nefer, Anna,
Horemheb, and Remenkheperseneb.

eastern side of the hill behind the Ramesseum. The one to the left
