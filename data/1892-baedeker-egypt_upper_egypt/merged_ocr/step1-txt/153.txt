the ancient Apouinopolia Parva. According to Abulfeda (d. 1331)
this town was second in size only to Fossrit (Cairo), and was the
chief centre of the Arabian trade. To-day heaps of mine are the
only remains. A few stones with fragmentary inscriptions have
been built into the houses of the town; and the mosque contains
a basin formed of a single stone, with the name of Ptolemy Philadelphus upon it. A pylon, which stood here 30 years age but has
now disappeared, bore a Greek inscription, announcing that'Queen
Cleopatra and King Ptolemy, the great gods and Philemetors, and
their children dedicated the temple to the god Amelia and to the
deities worshipped along with him'. Ameris is the earlier Horns,

a picturesque appearance from the river. The traveller who lands

pleasantly surprised to hear the sound of church-hells. The churches
themselves are uninteresting. Great success has attended the
labours of Christian missionaries here and still more in Kile; and
a considerable proportion of the Coptic community (including the
worthy and learned bishop of Kits) have embraced Protestantism.
The missionaries of the United Presbyterian Church of North
America have also had considerable success at Luxor, Esneh, and
other towns in Upper Egypt, their converts, however, being exclusively from among the Copts, never the Mohammedma.
Demetrius IL, patriarch of the thrpts (d, 1870, excommunicated
both the converts and the missionaries. In 1 66 he instigated a

he could lay hands upon them. The British and American consuls
thereupon interfered energetically on behalf of their fellowbelievers, and now the Coptic Protestants enjoy complete immunity
from every form of religions persecution.
