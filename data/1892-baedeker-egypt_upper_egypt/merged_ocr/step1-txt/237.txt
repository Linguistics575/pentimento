behind him captive iiirland-primsir,

The 111111111011. of the pavilion can only be gained from one of
the walls of the court to our left as we enter. The attempt is not
without diffieulty; and some or the rooms are not accessibie at all.
In several of the apartments are well-preeerved wall-ses/es of no
little interest; 6.9. in the apartment above the passage and in the
right wing. Ramses III. is here represented in his harem. The nude
maidens with whom he is playing chess (the scene in the ruined N,
entrance-room to the right is well seen from before the facade of the
building), or who hand to him one a fig, another a pomegranate,
another a melon, another a flower which he smells, appear from the
shape of their feces and from the arrangement of their hair to he
captive princesses miller than his own children. This supposition
is farther strengthened by the occurrence here of several represen-u
tations of a distinctly immodest character.

The vicious propensities of this king are bbeted with biting scorn
on other monuments, He himself appears to hue looked with peculiar
pride upon his harem, which was rich in beauty of all kinds, and to have
immortalized its memory in his Memnonium. At all events his reign

marks the beginning of am epoch of luxury and immorality, upon which
decay followe closet

After passing through the gateway a, we traverse an open Space
between the pavilion and the first pylon. Before we reach the pylon,
210m wide, which conceals the first perietyle court, we pass a number of ruined walls of baked and unbaked bricks, which belonged
to the Coptic village built within the temple. In from, to the left,
is a small Temple of Ameniritis (26th Dyno, to the rights block
with the certouche of Nectanebus IL Buhlnd is the temple founded
under the 18th Dyn, which we visit later (p.184). Standing on
the rubbish hang in front of the ilrst pylon and looking through the
gateway into the temple, our view penetrates to the last court. There
is no more remarkable perspective in Egypt.

The large First Pylon (P1. C) is covered with representations
and inscriptions. First to the right we see the Pharaoh "the conqueror of his enemies, and opposite is Ammon-Ra, the king of the
gods, holding in his right hand the curved sword, in his left the
sceptre, and several wall-rings surmounted by busts of their prince's,
In the flrist we read the name of Punt or Arabia, which, however, must be here interpreted in a narrow sense, as equivalent to
the coastlands of the Red Sea. Between the king and the group of
his enemies is the inscription:'He strikes to the earth the princes
of all lands', beneath which is a horizontal row of Mares of some
tribes (partly damaged). Beneath that again is the chief Inscription,
from the lick year of the king, relating his great deeds.
