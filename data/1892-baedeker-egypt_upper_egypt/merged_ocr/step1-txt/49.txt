As far as Minyeh the space between the E. bank and the hills
remains narrow, the limestone rocks frequently abutting on the river
in unbroken walls or rounded bluffs. Few villages are seen on this
bank, but the fertile alluvial tract on the W. side, 10-12 M. in width,
is thickly populated and carefully cultivated, exhibiting in profusion
all the cereals that grow on the Nile, date-palms, and sugar-gane.
The huge sugar plantations present a busy scene in November, when
the sweet juice is collected from the canes and conveyed to the
factories, which are a monopoly of the Khedive and follow each other
in rapid succession. These factories are connected by the railway,
and short bramsh-limss, used in harvest-tima only, run from them
to the plantations lying farther to the W. Their lofty chimneys
impart a very modern-industrial appearance to the ancient land of
the Pharaohs. Large barges full of augu-canee and others with
fellahin going to work in the factories are met on the river. Most
of the higher offieials in the factories are Eumpeans. The juice is
expressed from the came and then ref1msi1 by being boiled twice in
closed vessels. In an average year about 25,000 tone of sugar are
produced in Egypt; in 1889 the value of the sugar exported
amounted to 509,0002..

The boat passes two large islands. On the W. bank lie Balankah
and Ethel: (rail. stat, p. i), with large sugar-faetories. The channel new contracts, and numerous islets are passed. chhn frail, stat,,

of el-Hibeh, on the E. bank, about t M. farther up, are the ruins of
the town of Kheb or Khaki, which belonged to the news of Aphrodite (p. F). These include we1Hraserveil riparian structures of the
time of the Pharaohs and some massive walls made of bricks,
hearing two different stamps. One of these bears the name of the
local goddess,'Isis of Kheh', and the praenomen of Tutmes m. (18th
Dye); the other, discovered by H. Brugsch in 1853, reads'The
high-priest of Ammon, Pishem the just, governor of the towns of
Urkhenu and Igem-kheb'.
