"according to Quatremere (Mémoires Géographiques, L, pp. My) at 38:1,),
from the fact that the town embraced two dimyrent communities, one

Among the pinto; of the French Expedition are two views of the Ptolemaic period, with two rows "six columns each
(Antiquitée IV, PL 60, 51). The columns were 55 ft. high, and the portieo
w 114% ft, wide. In Minutoli's'Journey to the Oasis
OFJupiter Ammon' (Plate XIV) a view is given of one of the columns

the temple ware used in building B ealtpetre factory.-~At Gebel Tunah,
near Btsrmoporis, is a tablet (much dilapidated) with an inscription of
the eun-worehipper Ehtrematea, who lived on the opposite bank of the
river (comp. Tall ts1-Amarnah, p. 22).

Nearly opposite Rtilah, on the E. bank, lit from Benihesan,
lies the village of Shékh'Abddeh, with the ruins of Antinoé.
Hadrian erected a new town in honour of his favourite Antinous
on the site of the Egyptian town of Bear, where the handsome
youth is said to have drowned himself, to faltH the oracle which
predicted a heavy loss to the emperor and so to prevent a more
serious disaster. The village 1593 on the bank amid palms of uncusual size and beauty, and to the S. of it is a brook, now dry
except after rain, which must formerly have flowed through the
town. The remains of public buildings of the Egyptian period are
scanty. The French Expedition saw a triumphal arch, a theatre,
and two streets flanked with columns, the one running N. and S.
and leading to the theatre, the other at right angles leading to the
eity-gate and the hippodrome. A lofty column bore an inscription
of Alexander Severus (Am. 222), To-day, however, there are few
remains either of Greek or Roman times. Among the palms lies a
fine Corinthian capital. The marble belonging to the'very tMe gate
of the Corinthian order' that Pancake saw here and tlgured in his
book was burned to make lime for building the sugar-factory at
Redah. The extensive ruins of the ancient town lie to the E. of the
village of Shékh'Abadeh. The streets and ground-plans of the
houses are still recognisable. The rooms were small and the walls
were made mainly of Nile bricks. There are, however, some turderground apartments of fiat Roman bricks, _reaehed by stone stair"
eases. Near the scanty ruins of one of the largest buildings lies a
basin of white marble, which must have had a circumference of
at least 23 ft.
