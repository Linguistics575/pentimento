the son of the Lady Hanna, who was one of the chief dignitaries
of the kingdom, bore the title of an erpa ha or prince, governed
the name of Mah in time of peace, and commanded a division of
the "my in war. To the left and right of the entrance he is depicted on a throne with _ feet, holding his communist"; baton in
his hand. Inside the door are two well-preserved inscriptions,
out in the stone. That to the right (8.) informs us that Amenemha
departed this life in the 43rd year of Ueertesen L, corresponding
to the 25th year of the govemorshtp of Ameni. He undertook all
his wars'soiling ap-stream': --". he campaigned only against
the dwellers of the S., the'miaerahle Kuahitee', as they are called
in the inscription. In those days the arms of the Pharaohs had not
yet been carried towards the E, The Sinai peninsula, with its
mines, is the only district in this direction which excited the Egyption lust of conquest. From his southern campaigns Amenemha
brought home much gold and other booty. The inscription to the
left (NO also mentions a victorious campaign towards the S., but
is of special interest for the light it throws on the truly human
feelings of this It-game time. Amenemha describes his occupam
tions in time of peace as follows (beginning at the fourth line from

The paintings in the interior of the tomh-ohamher proper are
unfortunately very much faded, and they have also been considerably injured, especially in recent years. Some figures of warriors whieh still remain, armed with club and axe or club and lance,

Tomb No, 2 is that of Khnumhotep, the son of Nehera. It owes
its origin to a member of a family of high rank, in which the offlee
of governor of Mel } seems to have been hereditary for several generations. Amenemha I., Usertesen L, and Amenemha IL, the first
kings of the 12th Dyn., showered titles and digTtities with a free
