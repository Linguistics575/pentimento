and its neighbour Abydoe cannot have been much younger, for even in
the time of the early empire it is frequently spoken of as a holy
city. It possessed the most famous grave of Osiris, of which it was
believed that burial in its vicinity or consecration in its sanctuary went
far in ensuring a favourable judgment in the world to come. From an
early period the grandees of the land caused their mummies to be brought
hither - often, however, for a limited time only, directing that, as soon
as the wished-for blessings had been received from Osiris, the bodies
should be carried back to their ancestral burial-grounds, Mariette has
proved that the town itself (Egypt. Am) was never of any great extent. The axum: ruin Â» hledf (ineh on the SE. If, however, Abydos was small in the number
of its citizens, it was great through the importance of the gods wershipped in its temples. Each of the 42 names of Egypt possessed its
temple of Osiris; but none of them, except that of Sokar in Memphis,

confirmed by the classical writers. Herodotus left Upper Egypt undescribed, because Hummus had already treated of it, but we quote the
celebrated swam in which the trustworthy Strabo speaks of Abydos:

palace of stone, built in the manner of the Labyrinth, only semewhat

reached by passages with low vaults consisting of a single atone and
prominent by their extent and mode of construction. This spring is
counected with the Nile by a. canal, which flows through a grove of
Egyptian thorn-assets', sacred to Apone. Abydoe seems once to have been
a large cam second only to Thebes, but now it is a small place, etc.'
Abydos is also mentioned by Plntarch, Athenaeus, Stephanus of Byzantium,
mommy, Pliny, and others. Ammianus Marcellinua speaks of the oracle
of the god Base, which flourished here.

began in 1 the task of freeing it from the sand. His plan of isolating
the building by digging a trench round and preventing new accumulation: of sand was not carried wholly into effect, but still, with the exception of portion of the outside of the N. wall of the ascend court,
there is now no part ot the temple where inscriptions are likely to

like a gigantic sepuichral chapel forming the vestibule to a mighty rocktomb in the bowels of the mountain. Mariette beiieves, and probably
