Straight on is a room about 25 ft, long. Here on July 5th 1881 Emil
Bmgsch discovered the famous royal mummies, now in the Gtzeh Museum.
Since January 1876 Ushebtis, tablets, and large funereal papyrus rolls, all
coming from this spot, had been sold to wealthy tourists through the
medium of Mustapha Age, the English consular agent at Luxor. Attention
was aroused by the Papyrus or ornnm a queen of the 21st Dyer, which
was produced in several pieees, one of which is now'in the Louvre, another
in the British Museum, having been presented to the Prince of Wale », and
a third in the possession of a Bel ian lady. Enquiries showed that there
were several brothers'Abd er-Rag 1 who were especially concerned in the
me of these anti uities. The arrest and trial of Ahmed, one of the
brothers, followed y flogging, led to no result. However partly from { w
of punishment, and partly for a promised reward the secret was betrayed
by Ahmed's elder brother 1Koluymmed, to the Madtr of Keneh, who gave
information to the Khedive. Brugseh describes the discovery as follows:

'Every inch of the subterranean passage was covered with Comm, and

antiquities of all kinds. My astonishment was so overpowering that I
namely knew whether I was awake or whether it was only a mocking
dream. Resting on a isofftn, in order to recover from my intense excitement, I mechanically can my eyes over the coma-lid, and distinctly saw
the name of King Se" 1., the father of Ramses u, both belonging to the
190.): Dynasty, A few steps further on, in a simple wooden eoffln, with
his hands crossed an hie breast, lay Ram": 11. the great Besostris himself. The farther I advanced, the greater was the wealth displayed, here
cArmtnophtu L, there, Amomu, the three Tutmes, Queen Ahmes nofermri,
Queen Aahhotep, all m mummies wen preserved; in all 36 eoffing, belong!
ing to king » and their wives or to princes and princeuea. v..'
e By the evening of July my 311 the mummies and tytdftng had been
carefully asked at Luxor. Three days later the Museum steamer came
to carry the precious burdens to mutt. From Luxor to Koptes on both
sides of the Nile, the tputrtiin women followed the. boat with loosened
hair and uttering plaintive cries, while the men fired "guns, as at a
funeral. Th6 exis were taken to the museum at 361515, and thence
removed to the new museum at Gizeh. - The discovery included King
Rasekenen, of the 17th Dyn., the opponent of the Hyksos; of the 18th Dyn.
King Aahmes, queens Aahmes nofertari and Aahhotep, kings Amenhotcp 1.,
Tarmac 1., 11., and IO,, prince Sitamon, princesses Sitamon and Men'tamon, mm »: a. priest, and others, of the 19th Dyn. Ramses A, 3m J,
and Ramses II. Ramses III. of the Ahh drs was also afterwards found.
Of the priest-kings of the let Dyn. Pinozem, Nozemit, Ramaka with her
daughter, a second Ptnozem, queen Hathorhontlaui, Masahirta a priest, two
yrincesses Asbem-kheb and Nesikhomd, and others. There were also found
a large leather tent in red, green, yellow, and white for Ast-sm-kheb, the
daughter of King Mom. 40 canopi, 3700 statuettes of Osiris, 12 to 15
ceremonial wigs, and AS wooden chests together with inscriptions, bronze
steels, papyrus rolls, and the like. The inscriptions found on the older
mummyschests, ta, that of Seti T, and en the wrappintps, were of great
importance, recording that the mummies had been taken from their combs
by the priest-kings of the 213: Dyn. (Harbor, Shaman, Pinozem, and Masehirte the priest) and removed to that of a lady named An keb er Au
hepu, in which also lay Amenhotep L In the Abbott Papyrus which is a
Human enquiry into me robbery of the tombs the passage 120 e113 long
m the tomb of Amenhotep L, which Was to the k. of the temple of Amenhotep, is mentioned. This corresponds to the passage in the Dér el-behri
pit. The colours of the garlands of flowers were marvellously well
preserved. The wan na have been named by Prof. Schweinfurth.

On June ist 1886 by the wish of the Khedive the unrolling of the
mummies, a somewhat bold proceeding, was taken In hand, beginning with
the grey-hired Ramses the Great, whose sharp features and curved nose
tsrtrrersiarub1y striking. in the: omn of Nefertari the mummy of Rammu III. was strangely found. Then followed Seti L with his mild features,
Basekenen with his fleree look and broken skull, havin perhaps fallen in
battle with the Kheta, Aahmes l,, and the priest-kings of shes A mummy
