times, for the feasts of the year, the ream
for each day for himself. He filled the temple with all things, a super »
abundance nr gifts of nourishment, bulls, calves, oxen, geese, incense,
wine, and fruit, fl11ing it with labourers' enriching it with flttldi, presenting cattle, fnling the storehouse with superahundance, the urns
reaching to heaven, the servants of the domains of the offering being the
captives of his brave sword. His tretusurtrhoust, fined with all game,
with silver and gold in bus, the storehouse full of all things sent as
tribute from all countries He has constructed numerous canals, and has
planted timber of all sorts, fragrant plants from the land of Punt; he
has done all this, the son of Ra, the lord of the diademe, the beloved
of Osiris and of the gods the lords of Ahydoi.

Like the temple of Seti, that of his gun Ramses was also a
sanctuary dedicated to Osiris, though in each case the predominant
feature is the giorifieation of the monarch in his apotheosis as
Osiris. Mariette was therefore on a wrong tack when he saw a
special temple of Osiris in the enclosure (PL lil; p. 52) to the N.,
near the village of Eilherbeh, and spent much time and money in
an attempt to find the actual grave of Osiris, Obviously this was
merely an older sanctuary, erected by the kings of the 12th and
13th Dynasties on the site of a still more ancient temple. [ Two
steles in the Louvre, numbered c, "and C 12, and the great stele
of Mentuhotep, now in the museum of Gizeh, give us information
concerning these buildings.) Nowadays this temple is a mere heap
of rubbish, and the few interesting'finds' made here, such as the
statues of Usertesen l, and Usertesen 111., and some inscriptions of
the time of Tutmes 111., have been sent to the museum of Gizeh.
The same institution received the many hundred steles found partly
on the site of this temple and partly in the Necropolis of Abydos.
Three such cemeteries are distinguished. The first, containing
tombs of the New Empire, from the 19th Dynasty downwards,
lies to the S of the temples of Semi L and Ramses II. Another
(Nécropole "Centre) lies to the W. of the path leading from the
temple of Ramses II. to the semealled temple of Osiris, and contains
graves mainly of the 6th and 11th Dynasties. Here was found the
historically valuable tablet of Una (see Baedeker's Lower Egypt,
p. 307), who accompanied three successive rulers of the 6th Dynasty
in their campaigns. The third or neeropolis, to the W. of the
so-eil temple of Osiris, contains numerous graves of the 12th
and 13th Dynasties, but also many of the new empire. Among the
interesting atelea found here were those of a Neferhotep of the
13th Dynasty and of Sheshonk, the latter erroneously pronounced
by H. Brugsch to have been a Persian satrap. The pyramidal struetures found in the N, and central cemeteries are also interesting.
Still farther to the W. lies a quadrangular enclosure surrounded by
a lofty wall and named Shunet ez-Zeb2b (PI. IV; p. 52; magazine of
the Zihehes), which probably served as a place of defence against
the incursions of the Beduins of the Great Oases. A Coptic Convent
(Ph Ar; p. 52) to the Na, of this point, dating from the year 1306
of the Coptic era, anarc'ely repays a visit. _ _." _ _
