girdle-wall, states that'they reached Seth-Typhon and his companions in the home of Apollinopolis'.

Horns emerged victorious from this battle, and the evil Sethu
Typhon was pierced by him (tabu).'Piereer thereupon became his
name, and'place of the piercing' the name of his district and town.
This name is clearly preserved in the modern name Eats, Another name, that occurs most frequently next to this one and has
also reference to the chief deity of the temple at Edfu, is Hut or
Rebut. Thus the winged sun-disc, which was placed over the 611*

a splendid restoration of an earlier temple carried out under the
Lagidae. The Temple proper, i.e. the sacred apartments exclusive of the later hypostyle with its 18 columns CPI, E) and of the

pylons and girdle-wall, was begun by Ptolemy III. Eaerpetee I. in
the 10th year of his reign. It was flnished 95 years later, in the
