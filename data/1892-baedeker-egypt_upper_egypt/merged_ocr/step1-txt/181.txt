that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the

EthiOpians. And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and

came to Jerusalem'. Verse 9 is the same as the above passage

(C""""?) from Kings. - The conquered people named in the represen
tation are the Ama, Kenue (Nubiene), Menti, and Sekti (Asiatiee).

Champollion, ma gram deeipkernr ot biaragiyphica, was the

first to perceive that the names in the inscription belonged to

the above-mentioned "fenced cities" and that Sheshenk, "1195
by the Greeks Seeenchie, was identical with the Shiehek of the

Bible. The third name in the third row from the top, attracted

his attention especially; it reade'Judah (Jude) Malek', amt mly

name-labels, with their characteristic Semitic features, ere auf
m fieient by themselves to prove that only places could be here
e'risysi6ed that were inhabited by peoples related to the Jews. Of

a the m name-lubela only a few can be identified with certainty
with otherwise known names of place; in Palestine, such as

cently been obliterated by the whitewash used to preserve the

E 1 wall, and some of the name-labels have also been destroyed,

as e.g. Megiddo at the beginning of the third row. The rest of

the inscription Â», which are couched in the usual emphatic style, give no
farther information as to the campaign.

We return to the peristyle court and promed to the Second Pylon
CPI, 11). The left or N, side has fallen and the right side is sadly
damaged. The eelossi of Ramses w, Which guarded the projecting
entrance, have already been mentionea on p. 119, But neither
Ramses IL, as appearances might suggest, nor even his father Seti T,
built this pylon, but the predeeeseor and father of the latter,
Ramses L, who also planned the hypeetyle hall, afterwards adorned
by Seti L and Ramses the Great. The cartouehes of Ramses II.
frequently occur sunk instead of being embossed, because they have
been placed on spots previously occupied by the older cartouches
of Ramses I. or ati I. The same is the case on the back of the
N, pylon, whereas on the back of the S. pylon, which was erected
by Ramses IL, his name appears in genuine bae-relief. In the
doorway (P1. o), where the eartouehee of Ramsas L, Seti 1., and
Ramses II. are found, an intervening door was erectedhy Ptolemy WI.





Philemetor (e, EB and Ptolemy IX. Euergetes IL, during

their joint-reign [ 170465 BA).). The lintel and upper parts of
this latter doorway are wanting, but the jambs are in good preservation, with expressions of homage to Amman and his feliewa
gods. 0n the inner side (to the left) of the earlier doorway appears
Ramses LL kneeling before Amman and receiving the symbol of
kingship. Behind him stands the goddess Math, and Khunsu, with
the moon's disc on his head, conducts Ptolemy WI. Philometor to
behold the god Ammon. Probably the representation is a restoration
by Philometor of an older work on the same spot.
