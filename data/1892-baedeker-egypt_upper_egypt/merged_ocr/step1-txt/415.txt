a third room, the eella. The four clustered columns which support
the ceiling of the main chamber recall the proto-Doris columns of
Benihasan o. 12). A stone bench runs round the walls. On the
W. wall is Anuke suckling the infant King Horus, with the words:
u am thy mother, I give thee milk, it brings to thee peaceful life,
youth for thy limbs and strength for thy arms.' Beside her stands

four different forms of the god Horus, viz. as lord of Wim, of Beheni, of Bek, and of Maha - all names of places in Nubia. Over
the door into the left side-chamber is the cartouehe of the king,
'beloved of Ammon-Ra and of Thoth'. On the N. wall the king is
led by the hand by Bath, with the ass's head and the god Horns,
with the symbol of life. Some of the pictures are now scarcely recognizable. On the W. wall, to the right of the entrance, is the
king before Thoth, who promises him strength, health, and victory.
The two side-rooms have neither pictures nor sculptures.

The Saracen fortress of Adder (W. bank), sometimes called
Shataui, is named Mashakit by Champollion. In the mountains to
the S. of it are some almost inaccessible steles and a rock-eaves,
which is wider than it is deep. The cave belonged to the scribe
Pa-uar, prince of Kush and president of the S. lands, fan-bearer at
the king's left hand, Two-thirds of it are occupied by a broken

On the rocky slope to the right of the entrance to the grotto is

The hill of Shataui is the last spur on the E. bank of the range
of hills running close to the Nile from Ibrim, and presenting some
