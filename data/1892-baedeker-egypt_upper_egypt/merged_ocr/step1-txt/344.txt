possibly dating from a temple at Syene, on which Khnum, lord of chu

suburb here,

To the left of the road lies the small TEMPLE, founded by Ptolemy III. Euergetes and adorned by Ptolemy IV. Philopator, but
never entirely completed. On the left of the Facade is Euergetes L
and his wife Berenice IL, before Isis in Sun (Syene). Isis is named
eonduetress of the soldiers, because the frontier-town and its neighbourhood were strongly garrisened from very early times as well as

the Castra Lapidariorum, on the E, bank to the S. of Syene, the

lying in the midst of the desert, each marked by a rectangle of
