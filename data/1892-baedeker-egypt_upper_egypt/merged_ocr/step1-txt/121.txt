the Roman town and colony of Hydrmma or Fons Manna, which lies
in the latitude ot gau, about 3 days' Journey from Keneh. Outside the
walls lie a temple and other buildings, and some large columns and Greek
inscription: have been found in the quarries, which were worked ehiefly
in the time of Hadrian and Trajan. About two days' journey farther to
the N. is thahel Dukluin ('smoke mountain'), the ancient porphyry quarries
of which were worked by the Romans. Here are the ruins of an Ionic
temple of the time of Trajan (never completed), some remains of an irrer
gularly built town, and two large water-reservoire. The old route led
hence to Myos Homes, the harbour of which hm been edited up and is
now practically useless. Travellers making for the Sinai Peninsula journey to the N. from the porphyry quarries for two or three days more,
and cross by boat to Pie [ see Baedeker's Lower Egypt, p. 515). Those
who undertake one of these journeys should may the IteiwtrriiWe' of
Lepsius and Wilkinson's well-known work.

A much more intaresting Gurney than that to Gebel Dukhtn is the
trip to gram, or at least to ddt' Hamdmdt, where there are numerous
Egyptian inscriptions. For the journey (there and back) 10-1X dam should
be allowed, and Egyptologists will probably want 2-3 days more. It is

covered with dome-shaped roofs and surrounded by courts and colonnades. It has no owner and is free to everyone to use as he likes. As
nothing is done to keep it in repair, it is rapidly falling into decay, like
most of the Oriental buildings of the kind, and threatens soon to be a
complete ruin. In the deserts of Upper Egypt the temperature at night
is 50 mild, even in winter, that strong and healthy persons may safely
sleep in the open air if warmly wrapped up; and for various reasons this
is preferable to a night in the caravanserei. Those, however, who prefer

minute examination of the room in which they intend to sleep, in order
