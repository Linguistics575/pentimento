and is 650 sq. M: in extent. The Canal ofSohdg, which leads hence
to Asisiiit, keeps to the W. and is intended to convey the water of
the rising Nile as far as possible towards the Libyan Desert.

On this canal lies Elijah (1W), the ancient Aphroditopolis, so named
from the sandals (tab) made out of the skin of Seti. About 2 M. from Etfeh
is the Red Convent, Dtse'lulimar, also called Dir Abe; Bum". Those who
wish to visit the Red Convent and the similar White Convent (one of the
regular excursions of the passengers by the'four weeks steamer) may
him 15305 at Sohag and ride via Demnu towards the Libyan Desert, The
old church of the convent, I basilica with nave and aisles, is a. very
ancient structure of brick, with elaborate capitals and a richly articulated
awe? The num- wane, decreasing in thickness towards me top and the
eouceve cornice above the portal, are interesting forltheir reminiscence of
ancient Egyptian art.AN1 Bishtd, the founder of the convent is said by
Wensleb to have been a penitent rubber, and he afterwards acquired such
a reputation for sanctity that, according to Mskrizi, 3000 monks placed
themselves under his care. The recluse after whom the White Convent
(Dtr el-Abyad or DÃ©r Abu Shanddi) was named, is stated to have been
one of his pupils. It lies at the foot of the mountains, farther to the
513,, and may perhaps be rather called a Christian village than a convent,
as husbands, wives, and children live here in families. The walls of the
church are built of hewn stone, probably taken from the adjacent ruins
of mama WhNa named), dating from the mmmm and Roman imperial periods. It dates at latest from the tith cent. and is n basilica with
nave and aisles. The columns vary in height and thickness, and the
capitals are partly of later date. The chancel ends In three vaulted apeee

also wretched. -. In the hills to the W of the White Convent are a few
late rock- tombs, one of which, according to the inscription, is that of
Ermine, son of Arehibius.

61/2 M. Akhmim, a steamboat and mail station on the E. bank,
also reached from SoUg by a shorter land-route, is a thriving little
town with about 10,000 inhab., including 1000 Christians, some
of whom are Roman Catholics, with a chapel of their own. The
weekly market on Wed. is much frequented, and the bazaar is wellstocked. The numerous cotton mills produce the cloth for the blue
shirts of the felhWin and for the long shdla (pi. shdlat), or shawls
with fringes, which the poorer classes wear on state occasions and
for proteotion against cold. These articles, which have been made
here since the time of Straho, are extraordinarily cheap. Akhmim
Manila on the site of Khemmis or Panopolis, generally held to be the
most ancient town on the Nile, though this honour probably belongs
to the venerable This-Abydos, on the W. bank (p. 53). The deity
specially venerated here was the form of Amman Generate: known
as Amman Rheum, also called at a later date Min, an appellation
formed by dropping the Khem and abbreviating the Amen. Thus
it is called 211111;, Le. belonging to Min. For a figure of this deity,
who appears in the most ancient texts, see Baedeker's Lower Egypt,
p.137. Diodorus, who among other classical writers gives us much
information about Khernmiis-Patiopo1is, calls it Xeppm, whence
proceed the Coptic Shmin and the Arabic Ekhmim or Akhmim. 1:5
