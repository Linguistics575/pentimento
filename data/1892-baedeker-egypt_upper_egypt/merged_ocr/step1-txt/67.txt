The other representations in this t'omh off'er nothing unusual. Much
has been destroyed and defaced, principally by the monks, who tried to
aanctify the pagan work and drive the devil from it by marking it with
the sign of the cross. T." 1 _ ".

We next reach the ruins of at-Tell filld the grottoes pf Tell 31..
Amarnah, two very interesting points on Ge R. bank, at which the
Toar weeks' steamer stops for a few hours on m return-joumay.
The best plan is to disembark M st-Tell, visit the remains of the
old town, return to the dhahabi'yeb, and sail to Ham; el- Kama, where
donkeys for the visit to the grottbes are more easily obtained than
at et-Tell. We pass to the right of the village of tt-Teu, 1/411
from the river, and at the point where the cultivated land ends we
turn due 8. (to the right), After passing the ruins of a large building (probablyatemple), now consisting of the foundations only and
nearly indistinguishable, we turn to the right from the path to visit the numerous relics of public and private buildings of all kinds.
There are larger and finer ruined temples in other parts of Egypt,
but nowhere else do we obtain so excellent an idea of the actual
dwelling-places of the citizens. It looks as if the hand of deity had
bodily removed this large town (more than l M. long from N. to so
from the surface of the earth, leaving nothing but the foundations
to tell the after-world that many thousands of human beings once
lived and worked, suffered and rejoiced on this waste spot. The
lines of the streets may be followed and ground-plans traced; but
the demands of cultivation are steadily effacing the remains.

Tell al-Amarnah. Whether we proceed by land from tst-Teil
or disembark at Hagg el-Kandil, we have to ride towards the hills
to the E., in which, even from a distance, we discover the gates of
the celebrated tombs of Tell el-Amaruah. In either case it is advisable
to have a guide. On the way we should not omit to visit the recently
discovered grave of the sun-worshipper Jrliu-en-aten (Amend-,
tep IV., see below), Of the two groups of tombs that to the N. is
the more interesting and the more easily accessible.

An interesting and not yet fully explained epoch of Emu" history
