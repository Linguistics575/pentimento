Fayam. LABYRINTH. 2, Route, 39

thug reach the Kataganta structure, which consists of a terrace of
six carefully Jointed steps of large and weli-hem, blocks, but bears
no inscription whatever. We crate tire Balw et-wards, which
now intersects the ruins near the Pyramid of Bswtrsh, and which
is sometimes called by the Arabs Balm cl-Mclekh or Bahr tsh-Surly,
in, river of the East. On the E. side lies the mass of buildings,
which, according to Lepsius, was probably the Labyrinth (see below). In order to obtain a survey of these interesting ruins the
traveller is recommended to ascend at once the Pyramid td Ea,
wAm. This consists of unburnt bricks of Nile mail mixed with straw
(VOL L, p. 370, and, when its sides were perfect, covered an area
of upwards of 16 sq. yards, It has been ascertained that the nueleue of the structure is a natural mass of reek, 39 it. in height. The
dilapidated summit is easily reached in a few minutes by a flight of
well-worn snaps. The entrance to the pyramid, on the S. side, was
discovered in 1889 by Mr. Flinders Petrie. The tomb chamber
is 22 ft. long, 8 ft. wide, and 6 ft, high; it was covered with three
large slabs of stone and contained two sarcophagi, one of them of
polished sandstone without inscription, and fragments of an alaa
baeter vase with the name of Amenemha m. The chamber was
Meil with water to a depth of 3 ft,

Towards the S. we observe a eongeries of chambers and passages
of unhumt bricks, bounded by the Baht csh-Shethi, and pronounced
by Lepsius to be the right side of the Labyrinth, and the only part
of it which is to some extent preserved, On the other side of the
Pyramid there was doubtless a similar collection of rooms which has
new disappeared; and several other structures beyond them, of which
traces still remain, must have once minted there. The whole Labyrinth must have been in the shape of a horseshoe. Between the wing
of the Labyrinth which still exists, and that which has disappeared,
list an extensive Space strewn with broken pottery, in the middle
of which are large fragments of a magnifleent ancient temple. The
base of the shaft of a small papyrus column, and a capital of the same
order, both in the red stone of Aegean, with sculptured stalks and
foliage, are worthy of notice. Some blocks disinterred here bearing
the name of Amenemha m. haw main been covered with sand.
Several large blocks of limestone are also observed in the middle of
this large court of the Labyrinth. The inscriptions are almost errtirely destroyed, but faint traces of painting, and the symbols ca

isting the whole structure would appear to have occupied an area
of 8800sq. wish, and the large inner court an area of about 60 acres.

The Ancient Labyrinth. According to Brugseh, the Greek name Imbyrinthoe, which has been differently interpreted, is derived from'erpa',
er'eipa-rohunt', i, e. the'Temple of the mouth of the Lake', The 111neriptions found here by Lepsius prove that it was founded by Amem
