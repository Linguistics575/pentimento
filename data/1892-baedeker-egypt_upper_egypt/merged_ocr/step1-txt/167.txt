rubbed out. On the left (13.) wing, however, the life-like figure of
the king, shooting arrows from his chariot, and the fine rearing
horses of his chariot, are still clearly to be distinguished. On the
right (W0 wall also a good deal may be made out, The king is here
represented in his camp. He has dismounted from his chariot, which
waits for him, and has seated himself upon his throne Bis offieers
await his instructions, and farther in the background the troops
rest in their camp. The inscriptions are much injured, but it can
be made out from them that they were graven in the stone ehitsfly
in honour of Ramses IL's victory over the Khete (Aramaeans) and
their allies. In the 5th year of the king, on the 9th Payni, the fortress of Katesh on the Orentes wee stormed. The river and the
contest on its banks are still distinguishable. The Epic of Perth!"
in 90 vertical lines, covers the lower part of the W. wing and part
of the E. wing; some of it has recently been uncovered, the rest is
still concealed by rubbish. This poem was the national apes, the
Iliad, of the ancient Egyptians. It occurs twice on the E. bank et
Thebes--on the N. side of the pylon at Luxor and on the S. side
of the temple of Karma }; (here also partly concealed by earth } It is
also found, though in a very fragmentary condition, on the N. wall
of the temple of Ramses U. at Abydos (discovered flrst by Eisenlehr), and in the most complete (hieratie) form in the Papyrus
Haifa (now in the Louvre) and the Papyrus Satiier III. (now in
the British Museum }

The poetic text on the pylons at Luxor is followed by a prose

out at first that the Khets had fled into the land of Khirebu (Helbon or Aleppo) to the N. of Tunep, but who on being scourged revealed the real lurking-Pure of the enemy to the N.W. of Katesh.
The king hastily recalled the Egyptian troops, but too late to prevent his camp being suddenly attached an the S. by the Khan. The
Egyptians were surrounded, and only the personal bravery of the
king secured the final victory. This prose inscription, preserved in
full at the Ramesseum and in the temple of Ahu-Simbel, describes
the same event as the poem of Pentaur, though it dates it a month
later,

of the text by E. do Khug√© are as follows.'Then the miserable and
worthless Kheta. with his numerous allies lay hidden behind the fortress
of Katesh. His majesty found himself alone (with his servants). The

his chariots, that were more in number than the sand of the sea shore. Three

men were in each chariot, and they had united themselves with the warriors
