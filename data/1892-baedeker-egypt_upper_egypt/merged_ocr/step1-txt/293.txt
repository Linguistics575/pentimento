cut out. The colours are fresh; to the right and left of the door
are Tutmes III. and Tutmei IL; over the door 4 bulls. _ Ascend'

by Tutmes IIL, through which we enter avault sprinkled with stars.
This last rests against the wall of rock which rises above Der elbahri, without being out into it. A second archway with 2 aider,
niches leads deeper into the mountain, and there is a third unvaulted
room which was constructed under Tntmes L of the 18th Dynasty,
but appropriated by a distinguished otNial named Amenhotep,
under Ptolemy Euergetes IL, and his wife Cleopatra. The inscriptions of this later period compare very disedventageously with
those of the time of the Tutmes kings.

very small Room, also vaulted in the same way. We thus find three vaulted
rooms, each smaller than the preceding. In front of this arrangement of
tombs there was a building of which there now remains (on the right
as we leave the tombs) a Colonnade with nighmemidcd columns, hearing an arehitrave, the astragal, and the concave cornice. These rooms are
much choked up, and full of fragments of mummies, and linen rags. In
later times they were used aa a common burial ground. The same fate

This neighbourhood should not he quitted without a visit to the shaft
from which the famous royal mummies were obtained. In order to reach
it we walk over the heaps of sand to the right at the foot of Dér cthri

rAbd elwlflurnah down the slope to the west). In scarcely 10 min. we are
in front of a narrow chasm in the rock, up which there is a Mae climb
for 5miuutes. Above is the Shaft, Git. Bfi. At the bottom is an entrance 5 ft. wide and 3 ft. high which
leads in a ICE. direction for the length of more than 195 ft., its height lug trom 6 to 13 ft. To the right time or six rude steps lead to a niche.
