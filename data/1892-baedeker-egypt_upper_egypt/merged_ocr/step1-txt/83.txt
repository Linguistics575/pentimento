The village of Bthamu, about t M. to the N. of Medineh, was

some shepeiess ruins of ancient origin, destitute of inscription, but supposed to be the remains of the pyramids which acoording to Herodotus
once stood in the lake. They are now etr11ed Karat Fm'an, or chair of
Pharaoh, and resemble dilapidated altars rising above other fragments of
solid masonry. If they were once pyramids, the greater part of them
must have been removed, as the walls are new but slightly inclined
inwards, Distinct traces of the water in which they once stood are to
be seen on their bases. and they are still surrounded by remains of
walls, the purpose of which is unknown.

In the fields near Ehgig, or Hem, 2%: M. to the S.W. of Medineh, lies
a. fine obelisk, broken into two parts, which must have once been at least
46 n. in height (route to it rough and dirty). Like other obelisks, it is,
horizontally, of oblong rectangular shape, and its summit is rounded.
The inscriptions, which are damaged at many places, inform us that the
monument wee erectedagg Usertesen L, who also founded the obelisk
of Heliopolis (Vol. L, p., and belonged to the same family (12th Dyn.)

villages, we reach a bridge of ancient brick masonry. Traversing
the slightly undulating tract a little farther, we reach the Balm
Bela Md (? river without water'), also called el-Bats, a deep ehan-u
nel, extending in a wide curve, and terminating near the NE. end
of the Birket eI-Kuran (p, 43). In winter the water, which trichleg down from its lofty banks, forms a few scanty pools. At the
bottom of the channel grow reeds and tamarisks. The S. bank
rises at places nearly perpendicularly to a height of 26 m, so that
the sequence of the strata of the soil is distinctly observable, We
now ascend the plateau (the highest in the province, 88 ft. above
the sea level) on which lies Hawtret elulfiagnh or Hawdnt elMalcta, a considerable village, with a mosque (reached in 1% hr.
from Medinet e1-Ftoiirri), The traveller may apply to the ShékhwelBeled [ prefect of the village) for a guide to the pyramid of Hawéra.
If the water is high, and the canals have to be avoided, we have
