On the pillar between the two columns to the right of the entrance to the main temple is another Greek inscription. This is a
decree of Aurelius Besarion, also named Amonius, military governor
of 01111705 and Elephantine, ordering the owners of swine to remove
their animals from the holy Talmis. It probably dates from the
year 248-9 Al) .--- On the left side of the elegant tyr-ts-dirty,

Leaving now the entrance-wall with its four columns behind us,
we tind ourselves in the main building of the temple,. the portico
proper, which is 40 ft. deep and B6 ft. broad. This pumice is considerably higher than the three rooms behind it, from which a
