and his two wives, against the expense caused by the too frequent visits
of royal officials and their retinues, Which impoverished the temple.
Above this are two other inscriptions, only fragments of which are preserved, in which the granting of the petition by the king and the conaequent royal decree are announced.

This obelisk has been of the greatest importance for the interpretation
of the Egyptian hieroglyphics. The names of Ptolemy Euergetes and
Cleopatra, which occur in Greek on the pedestal, were discovered by
Chempollion in 1822 on the obelisk itself, and from the latter name he
was enabled to add a few more alphabetical signs to those already ascertained from the Rosetta decree (Vol, L, p. 111).

The W. Obelisk, as we have said, remains in Him though it has
lost its point, Upon it is inscribed, in Greek, a petition from Theodotos, son ofAgssiphtm, to Isis and her fty1low-gods, dating from the
time of Neos Dionysus, There are also some Arabic inscriptions.

The hypasthral vestibule was bounded on each side (E. and W.)
by six columns and one of the obelisk?" The six W. columns are
still standing, but only three stumps of the E, row remain, Between
the columns were screen-walls, half as high as the shafts, and
adorned with concave cornices and balustrades of Urteus-serpents.
The columns, only 2% ft, high, and have
calyx-capitals supporting an abacus decorated with the Hethermask, on which rests a small chapel. These capitals, which resemble those of the Ptolemaic epoch, are specially remarkable, as
they were erected by Nectanehus before the period of the Lagidae.
Nectanehue who maintained himself for some time in opposition to
the Persian kings, appears to have delighted in comparing himself
to the ancient Pharaohs, as we may gather from his first name Rakheper-ka, which was also that of Ueertesen I. of the 12th Dorm;
and it is possible that he adopted, in the same spirit, old and forgotten artistic forms in his erections. It is certain that the Bathormask at the top of the columns is only found earlier than his time
on the monuments of the 18th Dyn, at DÃ©r elmbahri (p. 223) and
tyl-tktm (p. 236), The architects of the Ptolemies were afterwards attracted by the abacus adorned with the countenance of the goddess
of Denderah, adopted it, and farther developed the sculptured Calyxcapital, here first introduced by Nectanebus .--0n the W, and E,
sides of each of the six standing columns are ihsdieation-inseriptiorm
On the outer (WO side of the most southerly column (next to the
obelisk) is the inscription:'The good god, lord of both worlds,
Ra-kheper-ka, son of the sun of the sun and lord of the diadems, Neetanehus,
the ever-living, erected this sumptuous building for his mother
1515, the bestower of life, in order to enlarge her dwelling with excellent work, for time and for eternity!" - On the outer side of the

third column the name of Philte appears as Alek A (with the

of the island is named as jg if) Lf (i) a
