Guarani. Until a few years ago Kemeko was the chief emporium
and port of shipment for the caravans crossing the desert to or from
Abu I.ramed, which lies 8-10 long days' journey distant (see below).
This road avoided the three upper cataracts, which are not navigable
when the river is low, and it also shortened the journey considerably
by cutting off the windings of the Nile. Russegger, Lepsius, and
finally Gordon (1884) selected it on their way to Ehartihm A short
excursion along this desert-route, between the hills, black with
iron-scele, is not uninteresting; or the traveller may ascend (1/2 hr.;
steep and stony) the hill of Awas eF6uardni, close to Koruske. On
the summit is the tomb of the saint to whom the hill owes its
name, a frequented pilgrim-resort. The view extends over the Nile
valley as Den: A fort has recently been erected by the Bri
tish at Korusko. On the bank of the river is a LstytRihouss

only water met with on the entire route, and a few huts. "Next follows

is reached on the 8th, or at latest on the 10th day.

A little beyond Korueko the Nile valley trends to the N.W., so that
the N, Windwhieh prevails in winter frequently retards navigation. On
the left bank rises a picturesque chain of hills. In this reach travellers have a chance of seeing crocodiles, which frequent the sandbanks and lay their eggs in the clefts of the shore. Recently, however, they have become somewhat rare. On the W. bank the
inconspicuoue Temple of"Amtidah, 8 M. from Komako, comes in
sight. It lies deeply sunk in the desert-sand, while on the opposite
bank a cultivated strip with many trees stretches between the river
and the hills. Passengers by Cook's steamers have an opportunity of
visiting this temple.

The Temple of'Ava-h has a very unpretending exterior and
seems at first hardly worthy of a visit. Yet it is in reality of great
interest both for tiurietitifle and ordinary travellers as an excellent BXample of the graceful and elegant architecture of the 18th Dyn., under which it was built. Nothing is left of the front of the entrance"
hall except the doorway; and the structure of Nile bricks adjoining
the latter indicates that the temple has been used as a mosque or
as the tomb ofa saint. (A Mohammedan cupola, removed only a few
years ago, was an additional proof.) On the right Sid of
