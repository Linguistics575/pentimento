according to the exaggerated representations of his priestly flatterera,
There can be little doubt that he successfully opposed a league of several
peoples, who attacked his kingdom by land and am but he did not Phetrate into the heart of Asia as his great ancestors did, and the critic
cannot avoid regarding um puma of Medinet Hahn as exaggerated and
unreliable, The report on the first pylon, referring to the victory of the
7th day of the month Mekhir in the year 11, contains some passages of
eonsieerable poetic form. After relating that the enemy had intended to
settle in Egypt and to till the land as his own, We mount goes on:
'Death luau? 1n Tamer (Egypt) for those, who had coma on their own

0n the S. or Left Pylon are similar representations. Between the
two flag-Mars the king appears with his fettered enemies before
the god Ptah, who aims a blow at two enemies. Beneath is another
horizontal row of ten conquered people, and a stale of the 12th year
of the king imitated from a. stele of the 35th year of Ramses II. at
Abu-Simbel, containing a dialogue between Ptah and the king.
To the left (SO is a colossal figure of Ammon-Ra, handing the sword

Within the gateway (Pl. d) leading to the next court is the
name of Ramses m., engraved unusually deeply in the stone. Tho
