Language. LOWER NUBIA. 303

the hands of the Moltaanrmrdtrns,'Amm ibn al-a'Ag conquered Nubia
in the year of the Begin 20, Dongolah was captured, and a tribute
of slaves imposed upon the Nubiana. When Egypt became an independent Mohammedan kingdom under the Fatimite Mutizz in
969, the Nubians recovered their freedom. In the year of the Begin
568 (i172 AD.) Saladin'e brother captured the citadel of [ brim
and plundered the church. Similar disasters followed, and the
people only escaped compulsory conversion to Islam by heavy seethfuasa, the loss of the provinces nearest to Aswan, and the payment of
a pollutant. The Nubian kingdom now split up into various petty
states, among which Sennar, founded in 1484 by the negm-mbe
of the Fungie, rose to importance and held sway over the provinces
of Shendi, Berber, and Dongolah, This, however, was of no long
duration. Dengolah was frequently invaded by the robber tribe of
the Shégiyeh. mlsma'il Pasha, son of Molrasnmedull, made himself
master of all these provinces in 1821. m conquered Dongolah without opposition, defeated the Shé'giyeh at Korti, and acquired iiknngr
also. This conquest, however, cost Isma'il his life. At a festival
given by him at Shendi, a hat in which he had been seemed was set
on fire, and he and his companions perished in the tlamate. But this
incident did not prevent the complete subjugation of the 8tiltn,
which was converted into an Egyptian province, with the ntsm1yfounded Ehartum as its eapitah Dtritr, too, was conquered and
annexed in 1874. But the war with Abyssinia (1875-76), a revolt
in Dtrftr, the rotten state of the Egyptian f1naneas, the rebellion of
Arebi Pasha, the victorious advance of the Mahdi, and the death
of the devoted General Gordon (J an. 1885) led to the loss of all the
Egyptian possessions to the S. of Wtdi Eelfah, in spite of the British
occupation of Egypt 1882) and the belated expeditions to Dongolah
and to Khartilm (13 -86 ]. It is bat too probable that these districts
will remain beyond the iiflmmee of Egypt or of European civilizetion for a long time to come.

POPULATION AND LANGUAGE. t The inhabitants of the upper
valley of the Nils, even from below the tirgt cataract, are called
Barabra (Barbers) by the Arab population of Egypt. A mere MP.
curate name for them is Nubiam, and as the aboriginal inhabitants
of Africa they must be distinguished from the Kushite what; who
immigrated from Asia "a very early period, partly to the N, vit
the isthmus of Suez, and partly to the 8., across the strain of Bib
el-hamlet, into Na. Africa. Of these immigrants the former became
the inhabitants of what is new modern Egypt, the latter (also
Kushites according to Lepsius) were the ancestors of the Begah
tribes, who settled to the E. of the Nile between that river and
the Red Sea. The Begah tribes also include the rAbdbdeh on the N.,
