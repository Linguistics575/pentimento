by fine palms and Nile aeaeiae, especially near the riverside villages.
Here, as in most of Egypt, large quantities of pigeons are kept by
the peasants, "hiatly for the sake of their droppings, which form the
only manure used in the fields, the dung of the cattle being dried
and used as fuel. Large pigeon-houses, not unlike pylons, are
visible in all the villages, and huge floeks of pigeons are seen
wheeling in the air or settling like a dark cloud on the fieli1tL Most
of these pigeons are of the common grey species, and attain a comsiderable size, but many pretty little reddish-grey turtle doves are
Alan seen The traveller is at liberty to shoot these birth, which in
the form of a pigeon-pie with olives form a most acceptable addition to his larder, but he should exercise this liberty with discretion
and not rob the harmless felleh of too many of his feathered friends.
The pigeons really consume more than they produce, so that their
encouragement by the fellahiu is rightly regarded as a serious
mistake in their husbandry.

Those who are interested in Egyptian agriculture may utilise
the opportunity of an unfavourable wind to go ashore here. Formerly convent after convent occupied this district, and the gardens
of the monks, according to Mahrizi, made it possible for the traveller to walk continually in the shade. A few convents still remain,
such as the Dtr er-Rifeh (W. bank), on the slope of the Libyan
hills, 8 M, to the S.W. of Aesidt, with the tomb of Tutus, son of
Rahetep and commander of the archers, and other ancient Egyptian
graves. The inscriptions prove that 8liarhotep, the capital of the
Hypselite nome, lay in this vicinity, and it may perhaps be identified with the modem Shujzbt Of the Christine who resided here in
the 11th cent. we are told that they spoke Greek as well as Coptic.
Interesting Coptic MSS. may still reward the searcher in all these
cements.

The traveller need not break his journey between Asisiiit and
Akhmtm, as even the antiquarian will derive little profit from the
scanty remains on this part of the river, neatly opposite
Assisiiit, perhaps occupies the site of the ancient Conlralyaopom. In
the Gebet Rokhiim, to the E. of the villages of cLGhor√©biyeh ind
Natafdr, is an alabaster quarry.

i5 M. Butts or Abutig (steamboat and mail station), an agricultural town on the W. bank with 10,800 inhab. sud a small harbour Med with Nile-boats, lies in the ancient Hypselite home. The
present name is probably derived from the conversion of the ancient
Egyptian name Handbeti into the siraiHr1rsoamrtng Greek name of
'AnoB-hun (Apotheke; Coptic Tapothyke), Le, Storehouse, an admirable name for the chief town of, district so fertile in grain,
Among the Hellenes it was generally known as Abolis.

At Beddri, on the E. bank, 2 M. from the river, are some rude
reck-tombs without inscriptions. On the W. bank follow the mall
steamboat-atations Sadfeh and Temeh.
