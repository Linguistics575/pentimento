After an izstroduetion, wishing peace to the dead, and glorifying the
sumgod, it continues literally as follows:'Celebrate the great day, o
prophet. Well is to thee, fragrant resin and ointments are laid before
thee. Here are wreaths and flowers for the waist and shoulders of thy
sister, who is pleasant to thine heart, as she mu beside thee. Let us
then sing and strike the harp in thy presence. Leave all cares behind
and think of the joys, until the day of the voyage comes when man mu
anchor on the land which delights in silence'.

Near this is the once splendid tomb of another Neferhotep, overseer of theeattle of Ammon, but now in mine and used as a magezine by the keeper of the Gizeh museum. There may also be visited
in the neighbourhood the tombs of Khanif, of the time of Amen-,
hotep IIE, of Mai, and of an ofheial in charge of the stables of

landing-place M the ferry we ride across the fields in a northerly
direction and in 3/4 hr. reach the handsome *Temple, the front of
which with its columns is visible at a considerable distance. The
original building (see the annexed plan) was of smaller dimensions
than the Ramesseum and Medinet Habu, its complete length being
518 ft., and of this only the actual sanctuary with its halls and
chambers, 153 it. in depth remain, while there are only scanty
remains to prove the former existence of two Courts and the Pylon:
which enclosed them. The Sphinx" which were placed like guardians to the right and left of the door leading into the first Court
on the inside, are half covered with earth. They were placed there
by Seti L, and on the bases were inscribed the name's of all the
nations which he had conquered. Of all the buildings in the Necropolis of Thebes, this one most reminds us of the Memnonium of Abydos
