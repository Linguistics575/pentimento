Behind the temple of Hathor is a Temple of Isis, consisting of a
vestibule and three chambers, The unattractive and uninteresting build-,
ing, which is partly covered with rubbish, owes its origin to the emperor
Augustus. The gate facing the E. bears the Egyptian cartouches of Claudius
and Nero, and two Greek inscriptions on the entablature mention the
2tst year of Tiberius. This gateway marks the limit of the temple area
in this direction; and about 10 min farmer on we reach another gate,
which apparently belonged to another temple-precinet. It bears the cartouehe of Antoninus.
