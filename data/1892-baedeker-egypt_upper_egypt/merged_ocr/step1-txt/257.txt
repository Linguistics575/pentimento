and was only adopiea later in stone architecture. The pavilion has a

is standing below his seat, while oatriehee, wild assets, a kind of wild
goat, and other goats and cattle of various kinds mi colours are being

The interior of the tomb is small, but is not without interest, especially
from the abundant list of offerings on the right wall from which alone we
learn the names of "s kinds of wine and two kinds of beer. On the
left wall is the eountry-homus and garden of the deceased; two women
are standing at the door, probably his wife and his mother. In the background Anna is sitting with his wife before a richly furnished table of
offerings. Opposite to him is seen his eoffin bein drawn along, and the
weeping women throwing dust on their heads, gust as may be seen in
Egypt at the present day. The innermost room of No. 26 together with
the shaft has been filled up with atom, and all that can be recognized
