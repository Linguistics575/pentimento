The building is at once a temple of the gods and a temple of fame;
dedicated'k tomes Isa gioires' of the empire of the Pharaohs, it was
cemyelled to receive additions, often in most unsuitable pleeee3
whenever it was the will of the king to recognize the favours of
Ammon by new buildings which should record for posterity what
the god had done for him, and through him for Egypt.

Before we enter the peristyle court, an inscription on the door of the
pylon, to our right as we enter, merits notice. rum was placed here by

This monument of untiring and successful diligence deserves to be
greeted with respect; it contrasts with the execrahle taste of the idle
tourists who have scribbled over and defaced inscriptions within the
temple, with their own inssignit1ctspt names. Opposite, the French table
an Italian learned society (Feb. 9, 1841) have erected another showing

b. The Great Pttritrtple Court and its Additions.

The great'Periatrie Court (Pi. A) is believed by important
authorities to have been built by the rulers of the 22nd Dynasty.
The oldest part of the temple is the sanctuary (p. IM), situated
much farther to the B. Probably the clearest view of the growth
and historical development of the great house of Ammon would he
obtained by beginning there and thence visiting the later portions
in the order of their erection; but in following out this plan we
should be obliged to diverge irregularly hither and thither from the
main lines, and so would miss mach of the effect designed by the
builders. The influence of the god was supposed to radiate from
within outwards; while the procession of his adorers advanced slowly
towards Ammon from without inwards. The sanctuary was the f1nal,
unapproacheble goal of the pious, few of whom were permitted to
penetxete farther than the peristyle court The hypestyle hall was
indeed open to certain privileged worshippers, but only the'initiated' were allowed to approach any nearer to the holy of holies. That
sacred chamber itself might only he entered by the high-priest and
the Ring, the representative of the god upon earth. The arrangement of the peristyle and succeeding chambers indicate in the
clearest manner the nature of the services celebrated within than.
