to Thebes. 1rhiiihanr 8. Route. tiyt

Bmeen Nahadeh and Luxor (E. bank) the Nile makes a bend,
beginning at ed-2hmt'tlk tw. bank), after which we continue in a
S.W. direction. - 2ramtueli, a mail steamer station on the W. bank,
formerly possessed extensive plantations of sugarcane. In 1824 it
was the residence of Sh√©kh Ahmed, and of'Ali Kashef Ahu-Tarbash, who bravely defended it against the insurgents .--On the
E, bank, about 31/2 M, M. from the river, lies the temple of Medamtit,
The ruins are not without interest, but it is better to visit them
later from Luxor (p. 151) if time permit, than to interrupt the journey so near Thebes.

On the left bank, as we draw mar Thebes, rise high limestone
hills, presenting precipitous sides to the river, from which, however,
they are separated by a strip of fertile land, The right bank is flatter,
and the Arabian hills retreat farther into the distance. Before
reaching the point where the W. chain projects a long curved mass
of rock towards the river, we see to the left first the great obelisk,
and the pylons of the temple of Kamak, half -concealed by palmtreesl When we clear the abrupt profile of the W. diffs and new
formations are visible at its foot, we may catch a. distant view of
Luxor towards the SE, None of the buildings on the W. bank are
visible until the steamer has ascended as high as Karnak; then first the
Qolossi of Memnon and. afterwards the Ramesseum came into view.
The telegraph-poste and wires, which here obtrude themselves upon
the view, seem strangely out of place beside the majestic relics of
Egypt'ss golden period. As we gradually approach Luxor, we distinguish the flags flying above the white houses on the bank and from the
consular dwellings, and the ris'ts applies himself to find a suitable
anchorage beside the other dhahabiyehs, which are always to be
found here. Those who desire to keep by themselves may first halt
off Luxor, lay in provisions and other necessaries, visit Karnak, and
then land on the W. bank. In this case the re'is will probably raise
objections, and the sailors (for whom a sheep should be bought, as
they have tasted no meat ion the voyage) prove mutinous, so that
watchmen will be necessary.
