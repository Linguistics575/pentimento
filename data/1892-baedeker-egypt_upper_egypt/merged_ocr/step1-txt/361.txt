The Amen! of the Pylom, commanding an excellent view of the whole
island and its surrounding, is made from the peristyle court entered by
the central ortal. Within this portal, to the right, is the following In: mym; F fan a oursuivies en deiis des eateractee oh

the names of me brigadier-generals, - The staircase leading to the top
of the'East Tower begins in the Small chamber (Pi, e), in the SE comer
of the peristyle court. It ascends gradually, round a square newel. Several unadorned chambers, probably used for the storing of astronomical
instruments and for the use of astrologers, are to he found within the
tower. They are feehlyr lighted by window-openings, decreasing in size
towards the outside wall. - The West Tower can only be reached from
the E. tower. The Crosses on the Money of the roof formerly held braces
of wood or iron.

Two Obelisk: and two Lions, all of granite, formerly stood before the entrance. The foot of the W. obelisk is all that remains of
the former; the latter lie much damaged on the ground. Numerous
Greek Inscriptions have been carved here by pilgrims .--Adjoining

0n the E, and W. are two oblong ssdidicos, each with columns on
the side next the court. That to the W. (left) is a distinct temple,
forming a kind of peripteros; that to the E. was used by the
priests.'Thia court, which is mostly uneven, contains one spot excellently adapted for the pitching of a tent. Cook's parties usually
lunch here; if there are more than one party at the same time, the
second lunches in the kiosque (Pl. R).

e. The Temple to the W. of the Peristyla (Pl. L) stands immediately behind the left (WI) wing of the first pylon, and a doorway in the latter (p. 287) has exactly apposite the S. Entrance
Door (Pl, d) of the temple, from which it is separated only by a
