60 Route J. ABYDO8, Memmanium

The Emmi Hypostyle Itoom (P1. D) Insemblaa the tust, but is
higher, deeper, and in all respects of mom importance. Seti I. he-
gan it and his artists executed both the architectural dotsils and
the. plastic adornment with the carefulness and purity of style that
marks all their work. The son has here left unchanged the Dune
of the father, which occurs at every point, Three rows of twelve
columns each support the architrave, on which test tha'oariitlg
slabs, and are arranged in six groups, each of six eoitymna, Be,
tween the groups access is Mhmled to tho vaulted chambers in the
wall facing us as we enter. The first two of the thrae rows of oirl-
ums have papyrus-bud capitals. Beyond the seeoud row tho iitpirr of
the temple is considerably rMsed, forming x1 putform from which
the vaulted chambers are Bntered. Upon this platform stands the
third row of columns, the cylindrical shafts of width are entirely
destitute of capitals, but bear huge blocks of stone forming an aha.-
cus for the support td the architrave. This peculiarity is simply ex-
plained by the fact that the cohxmus in the third row are shorter
than the others, owing to their raised platform, so that the architect.
by omitting the capital, brings the ahawg of all on the same level
And avoids the unpleasant eireet which different elevations of the
architmve would make an the eye. When proesssions of worshippers
tllM in and out, Performing pious ceremonies, this hall must have
presented a very imposing spectacle, Ingcriptions below the Nren'
lugs leading from the first hall to the second inform us they were
formerly t11leil with doors of bronze (asarnj. The inscriptions and
representations on the walls and columns repeat themselves weari-
amnely and are of little genersl interest. Here we see the king re-
ceiving from the gods such attributes of the royal dignity as the
crooked swnrd or the scourge and crack (symbols, perhaps, of the
royal duties of incentive on the one side Mid restraint onthe other);
there we behold him ottering b1arntotrerings to a single god, a
triad, or a grouy of gods. If the king is riseeiviug gifts, he is
generally represented on bis knees; when he saorifiires, he laws
slightly forward, holding the burat-oireriag in the left hand and
libuions in the right. Sometimes he is seated, receiving the bless-
ings of the gods; he appears thus in the fue picture on the N. Wall
of the second mom, with Isis, Amersti, and Nephthys in front, and
the goddess Ma and Renpet behindt His proNe is evidently a faith-
ful likeness and is everywhere portrayed with great artistic skill.
The unusual handsomeness of this king is still recognisable in his
mummy at Gizch. The saeritir, ia1 imylumuma should also be noted.
Camera like that in his hand have been found, but in bronze, while
his were doubtless of gold. They are in the form of an Bon, the
hand holding, Email vessel from which the smoke of tbe incense
arises, The handle shows the ramt'mly executed sparrow hawk's
hand of Horus. The libatiou vessel was in thu form of a golden lo-
