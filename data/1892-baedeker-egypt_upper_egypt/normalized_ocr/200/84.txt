thua remix the Kuhngmnta structure, which consists of a terrace of
six carefully Jointed steps of large and weli-hem, blocks, but bears
no inscription whatever. We crate tire Balw et-wards, which
now intersects the ruins near the Pyramid of Bswtrsh, and Which
is sometimes called by the Arabs Balu- cl~Mclckh or Barr ob-Sherri,
in, river ot tha East. On the E. side lies the mass of buildings.
which, xccording to Lepsius, Was probably the Labyrinth (see be-
low). In order to obtain a survey of these interesting ruins the
trawllar is recommended to ascend at once the Pyramid td Ea,
wAm. This consists of unbumt bricks of Nile mud mixed with straw
(VOL L, p. 370' and, when its sides were perfect, covered an axes
of upwards of 16 sq. yards. It has been ascertained that the Rib-
cleus of the structure is * mtural mane ohouk, 39 it. in height. The
dilapidated summit is easily reached in a few minutes by a iiight of
well-worn snaps. The entrance to the pyramid, on ths S. side, was
discovered in 1889 by Mr. Flinders Peale. Tho tomb chamber
is 22 ft. long, 8 ft. wide, and 6 ft. high; it was covered With three
large siatns of atom: and contained two sarcophagi, ans of them of
polished sandstone without inscription, and fragments of 2m Ms-
bseter vase with the name of Amenemha m. The chamber was
Meil with watar to a depth of 3 ft.

Towariig the S. we ohaerve t congen'es of chambers and passages
of unbutnt bricks, bounded try the Baht csh-Shethi, and pronounced
by Lepaius to be the right side of the Labyrinth, and the oniy part
of it which is to some extent preserved, On the other side of the
Pymmiil there was doubtless a similar "otleetion of rooms which has
now disappeared; and several other structures beyond them, of which
trams: still remain, must have once minted there. The whale Lsby-
rinth must have Men in the shape of a horseshoe. Between the wing
of the Labyrinth Which still exists, and that which has disappeared,
list an extensive spate strewn with broken pottery, in the middle
of which are large fragments of a mNyiiiieent ancient temple. The
base of the ahaft at a small papyrus column, sad a capital of the same
order, both in the red stone of Aasuan, with sculptured stalks and
foliage, are worthy of notice. Some blocks disinterred here bearing
the mum: of Amenemha m. haw main been aovereti with sand.
Several laxga blouks ot limestone are also observed in the middle of
this hugs court of the Labyrinth. The iaseriptious am almost an-
tirely dmstroyed, but faint traces of painting, and the symbols ca
