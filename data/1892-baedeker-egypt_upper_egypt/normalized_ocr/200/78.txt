cemetery. On the way, especially in the foreman, we often meet
funeral proesss'urns, resembling, with their waning women and
wuer-dhrtributors, those of Cairo, but yroducing a much more
solemn effect through the absence of the bustle of the crowded
streets sud the ytescnee of the deserted city of the dead. Nowhere,
not, even in Cairo, are the funeral Bangs so strange, and weird as
here, or sung by such deep and tuneful voices.

At the foot of the hill we dismount and follow the good path
which leads to the most interesting tombs. A tomb below, near the
Arab cemetery, is unimportant. Mighty grandam of the aneienz
empire, who filled the highest secular and eess1esitstieai oftioos,
hawed hugeveulte in the rocks here for the reception of their mtkmrr
mies. Other tombs, smalm and less elaborately decorated, belong
to nimple burghers of a JMee period; and there are 9.150 holes in the
rock for mummies of the jackal, which was sacred to Anubis Apheru,
the local deity of Assim. It is this animal that the Greeks in this
instance wrongly calla! Lykos or wolf (whence Lycopelis), but a
few genuine wolfvbones have also been discovered here. Murmaitred
dogs, kittens, and birds of pray have been found, wrspped in linen
hands and sometimes, adorned with gilding, Those who do not ob-
ject m creep into some of the dusty and ii1-smislh'tig holes will still
easily tInd fragments of sacred animals. The jaekal, along with the
Ummwsnake, Haunted proudly on the standard ofthis name, the

tho time of the ancient empire.

The path, whioh is weWqnsdrs though somewhat steep, leads us
$ irat to a large rock-hall, the ceiling Of which is roughly hewn in
the form of b vault and still bears traces of blue stars painted on a
yellow greund. Sadly defaced imseriptirms, in the style of the an-
cient, empire, cover the wtrllg, The hieroglyphies en the door are half
oblimratea, but enough remains te'shew that this was the grave of

wnom setting for the beautiful town of Arrsitat with its eleven mime

from the higher tombs. The secomi chamber of this tombis covered
with imptrrtant 1nsoriptitms. To the right on entering is one of
64 lines, which cannot be read without the aid Ufa long ladder and
a good lantern. It contains ten articles from the code relating to
the worship of the dead, determining, amongst other things, the
