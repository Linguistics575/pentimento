behind which are painted four t1gttrse, viz. Ptah (to the left), Atm.
men in blue, King Ramses, and Harmachis. No one should omit
to enjoy the mysterious effect of the interior view of this temple,

lpssi there are a numbax of much smaller statuea of the uhildren of
the king and queen. Beside the colossi on the right and left of the
