Demetrius IL, patriarch of tho Oopts (d. i870, excommunicated
both the converts and the missionaries. In 1 66 he instigated a
persecution of the prueelytes, whom he sought to terrify by fuses,
stripes, and imprisonment; and he destroyed the publications or
the missionaries (Who have a printing-press of their own) wherever
ho could lay hands upon them. The British and American conauls
thereupon interfered energeticaily on behalf of their fellow-
bclievers, and now the Coptic Protestants enjoy complete immunity
from every form of religious persaoution.
