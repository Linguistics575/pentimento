Beyond Eagg eleendil the Nile-voyeger passes several small
villages, but neither they not the scanty ruins of the Pharaonie
epoch near them di-vt, a visit.

la a ravine near eVEawtgtah (E. hank) stands a etele with I
hieroglyphic inscription, discovered by the iata Mr. Harris, British
consul at Cairo and excellently versed in Egyptian antiquities.
Farther on we akin an island and reach the point on the W. hank,
between the villages of cl- ITestrth (i.e,'island') and el-Mandurah,
where the Babe Yttauf "Joseph's Canal, an arm of the Nile, di-
verges from the main strum to wake: the agricultural districts of
the Libyan bank, the Fsytm (p. 36) etc. The name of Joseph, w-s
given to it by the Arabs, who recognise in the son of Jacob the type
of all edministtsmrs. It probably owes its regulation if not its origin
to Amenemha IIL, "the 12th Dynasty. Extensive works are now
in progress to furnish the W. part of the Libyan bank with water
from a point higher up the Nile, near Agsiiit.

About 5 M. below the divergence of the Baht Ytumf, at same
distance from the Nile, lies Démt esh-Shetlf (rail. stat., p. 1).
About 1% M. abvve (S. or) the fork, on the B, hank, are some
brick ruins, and 11/4 M. further to the S. are the mounds of Dir
el-Kugér, probably the site of the ancient Peach. This is the N.
boundary of the ddmvpelms, which, however, do not attain their
full development till farther up, between Asaiitt and Keneh, where
we see many thw specimens (y, 70). The Arabian Mtg., rising in
precipitous mcky walla, approach the river, 8weliowe, ducks, and
other birds inhabit the caves in the porcus rack on tho banks, and
tty in ami oat in screaming crowds, The Cr1irg cm the right bank of
this part of the Nile are known as Gebel Aba 266311. The stream
below them is considered the most dangerous part of the uhaxmel
between Cairo and Aisrm" am Violent winds blow round the mags,
and numerous sandbanks impede navigation,

The Arabs tell um a ahip-ther or Keneh, Immg snfaly nrrived n
