120 Route M, KARNAK. East Bank

We may mention here in anticipation that the roof of the follow-
ing hypostyle hall wee supported by a perfect forest of pBi! yrus-ttad
calumns, through the midst of which a broad passage was marked
by cMyx-iumuans, closely resembling the Gtashed min: of columns
in the rim court (comp. il. 126). At this point we tlast obtain a
clear idea of the arrangement of this portion of the temple, and the
same remark applies also to all the rooms between it end the sum »
mary. It should also be remembered that the number of those
privileged to follow and behold the pmcession gradually decreased
itom room to mom as the sanctuary was approached. Headed by
this king or chief priest, the crowd ofpriaste, bearing the ntanduds,
symbols, and images of the gods, passed through the doorway "the
tirst pylon into the paristy1o court. The double row of assirx-
capitals served at once to indicate their passage and to mark the
limits beyond which the pious spectators must not pms. Ths
sacred preceesion rolled on slewly beneath the shade of the velsrium
and entered the hypaatyle hell through the second pylon. Mlny of
those who were permitted to enter the first court had there to quit
the procession end to take up their positions to the right sad left
of the calyx-eo1urnrrs, Others again were not permitted to tsiivsnea
farther than the hypoetyle' and so with each room until the "no-
tuary was reached. To this day the clearly xluhned passage thither
may be traced, eml it will be observed that at each succeesive stage
the place appointed for those who had to quit the procession is
smaller than the preceding.

NE. angle of the mutt. to our left M we enter by the fimt pylon.
This building, which has only recently been made partly accessible,
is built of grey enndewne, excapt beside the three doors, where a
reddish quartmse sandstone then been used. The figures of the god
Seth has everywhere been erased from the name or the builder. Only
a small portion of the walls is entirely sculptuxed; 1nd the re-
presisatstions that are still extant show that the temple was dedicated
to the Theban triad, Amman, Math, and Khnmu. In the chamber
entered by the W. (loft) door appears the sacred bout of the goddess
