'21. From man el-Muh'ik to el-Asasif
anti Dar ol-bahri.

From Bib el-Malta we need not return by the way we came,
but may take the path over the hill which separate »; the Tombs of
the Kings from D6: el-bahri and al-Asasif. The path, which cannot
be missed, begins at tomb Mr, from comb 17 which every one will
visit, it is reached by going a few steps to the west. Persons not
equal to the climb may ride to the top, but it is a great strain upon
the donkeys. Riding down the hill is by no means to 393 recom-
mended. Tho donkey-boys usually lead the animals by a narrow
path over the ridge, and await the travallers at the foot, The zigzag
path is fatiguing but safe. and is easily accomplished in'is hr. This
* View is most remarkable; tirst into thes desolate valley of the Tembs
ofthe Kings, then from the summit and as we descend into the 9a-
ouliar [ nvina of Ihir el-bahri; we see; the steep projecting mountain
side with its tombs, sad buildings old and new, with the rich green
of the futile plain below spread oat on both aides of the Nile, wd
here and there its groups of palms and gigantic tismpiass, as far as
Kmnak and Luxor on the) E. bank.

Those who an: interested in the prehistoric Mor-spa, and the iliat
implements 0f the chimmma tyf the world, may notice at the beginning

Before turning to the temple of Dh M-bMprf which is Seen, with
