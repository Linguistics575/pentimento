Like the temple of Seli, that ot his gun Ramses was also a
sanctuary dedicated to Osiris, though in each mass the predominant
feature is the glor'siustiim of the monarch in his apotheosis as
Oeirie. Mariette was therefore on a wrong teak when he saw a
special temple of Osiris 1n the enclosure (PL lil; p, 52) to the N.,
near the village of Eilherbeh, and ispeut much time and money in
an attempt to i1rsil the actual grave of Osiris, Obviously this was
merely an older sanctuary, erected by the kinga of the mm and
13th Dynasties on the site of a still more ancient temple. [ Two
ateles in the Louvre, numbered c, "and C 12, and the great stele
of Mentuhotep, now in the museum of Gizeh, give us information
concerning these buildings.) Nowadays this temple is a mere heap
of ruhbish, and the few interesting Hiadis' made, here, such as the
statues of Ueertesen I. and Usertesen IIL, and some. inseriptions of
the time of Tutmes 111., have been sent. to the museum of Gizah.
The same institution received the many hundred eteles found partly
on the site of this temple and partly In the Keoropolis of Abrslos,
Three such cemeteries are distinguished. The "st, containing
tombs of the New Empire, from the 19th Dynasty downwards,
lies to the S of the temples of Semi L and Ramses Ii. Another
[ Nécropole "Centre) lies to the W, of the path leading from the
temple of Ramses II. to the ao-mlled templs "Osiris, and contains
graves mainly of the 6th and 11th Dynasties. Here was found the
historically valuable tablet of Una (see Baedeker's Lower Egypt,
p. 307), who tseirompaniesl three successive rulers of the 6th Dynasty
in their campaigne, The, third or neeropolis, to the W, of the
soiUed terner of Osiris, contains uumewus graves of the 12th
and 13th Dynasties, but also many of the new empire. Among the
interesting atelea found here were those of a Neferhotep of the
15th Dynaaty and of Sheshonk, the latter erroneously pronounced
by H. Brugsch to have been a Persian satrap. The pyramidal stnie-
mree found in the N. and central nemereries are also interesting.
Stili further to the W. lies a quadrangular enclusuze surrounded by
a lofty Wall and named Shunel es-Zeb'sb (PI, IV; p. :32; magazine of
the Zibebes), which probably served as & place of defence against
the incursions of the Beduins of the Great Gases. A Curtis Convent
(Pl. V; p' 52) to the Na, of this point, dating from the year i300
of the Coptic era, anarc'ely repays a visit. _ _." _ _
