20 have been dueovemsd, many of them othu'shsd and entirely

without decoration, and in their rough and blackmail condition,

msembling mew uvas in the rocks. It is rare to find either in-

Of the two tombs which we reach first, the second only (to the

W.), that of a quaen of Ramses IIE, is preserved. Her name is no
