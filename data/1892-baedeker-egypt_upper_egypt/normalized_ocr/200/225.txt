decisive of all, however, is the luscriptiou beside the heads of the
king's homes, which contains once more the passage from the egic
of Peuteur, telling us what event in the life ot Remaes was com-
memoxated by the erectitm of the Ramesseum. Once more occur the

whither it must fly.'Huste, Amsat, to the S. and bring tidings to
the gods of the S. that Horus, the son of Osiris, has obtained Wrs-
