Seth was obliterated at various epochs; The Introduction of Christ-
ianity and tha edicts of Theodosius were followed by the: destrae-
(ion of many pagan statues and the oblitemiion of many pagan in-
scriptions, At all events the new religion and the closing of the
temples dedicamd to the ancient gods rammed all possibility at
anything being dam; to preserve the monuments of the Pharaohs.
The Nile, which annually overflowed as far as the temple of Karnsk
in psrtieuhrr, and the sMinB axudations of the soil, wrought harm;
jackals and other animals sought shelter in the subterranean cham-
bars; many tombs, at first occupied by Christian harmits, were mm
vetted into peasants' dwellings; Christian churches were erected in
the "rttp1ry-hslls, and houses Were built between um columns of the
temple at Luxor. Carefully hewn blocks and slabs were removml
from the monuments, which Ware used as quarries, and many
limestone details wen: thrown into the furnaces and reduced to
lime. Whither the enormous popuUtion of the hundred -grsted
Thebes bemok itself is unknown. A few witiely-sesttarsd villages

ma various edifices and tombs, whose holy names might only be
uttered with pious awe in the time of the Pharaohs. The ruins of
Thebaa mmainad long forgotten. On this revival of learning classical
students recalled their fame; I'ocouke radiacovered, described them
and drew chain; and lhtMiy the publications of the great French
Expedition tevealad to astonished Europe how much of the ancient
magnificence of the Pharaohs had survived to Mu time. Each
succeading "ientitie expedition made its longest halt here tad
foauii hers its Iichest rewards. The names of Champollion, Wil-
kinson, Lapsms, and other Egypto1ogists are familiar words on the
site of ancient Thebes; and Mariette, who earried on ezcamtions
under thsyusirices or the Khedive: must also be mentioned.
