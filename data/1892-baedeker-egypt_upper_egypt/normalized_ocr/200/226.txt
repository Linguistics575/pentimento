shaped hail mentioned by Diodoras in his desiription of the tomb
or0eymartriryo.r5i0,. The inscriptiuus call it the'Hall of the
Appearance { comp p. 85). Diodorus describes hig hall as square
whereas the one before us is 98 ft. deep and 196 it, broad. The
three Ehtrames mentioned by Diodorus still exist, and are framed
with seulytarsd blocks of granite, The "' IC forms Iispiayed in
this hall are so extraordinariiy congrnous with each other, the di-
mansions "skiifuiiy calculated, and the proportions so harmonious,
that we do not hesitate, to describe it as the) most beautiful hail bw-
tant in any Egyptian temple, in its arrangement it resembled the
great colonnaded hall at Kamak. In the centre ik yassage was
marked out by six couples of higher columns with eslyx-irspitsls,
on each side of which were three rows of lower papyrus-bud co-

numerous wooden statues, rispresstttiug persons before a tribunal
and gazing upon the judgas. Reliefs ofjudges, 30 in number, are
saidm have been seen on one of tha walls (but this has possibly

of the judges appeared a presiding judge, from whose neck hang
the image oftruth with closed eyes, and by whosss side lay numerous
books. These statues were said to intimate by their attitudes (iid

did stand in this hall is indicated by pedestals found between the
