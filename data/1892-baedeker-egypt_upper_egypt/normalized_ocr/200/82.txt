missiou-ststion or at the house 0f the Italian cart), It contains
about 40,000 inhab., and is a not unpleuing specimen of an Egsp-
tian tnwn. Between the station and the town We observe a peculin,
undershot aikiyah,'nr water-wheel tlriven by the water itself. The
very long covered bazaar contains nothing of special interest. The

A broad arm of the Baht Yihmr (p. 35) flows through the middle
of the town. The mosque of Fait Beg, on the N, side of the town,
now somawhst dilapidated, is the only interesting buiming of the
kind. It contains numerous antiques columns, brought from the
ancient Aminoii, some of which have shafts of polished. marble with
Ambit inscription, and Corinthian and other capitals. Below the
mosque, an the bank of tho Be? pr YiUuf, are acme remains ot ancient
mummy. No ancient irutsriptioms have been disoavered here, but
the walls of some of the houses contain fragments which must
ham belonged to ancient temples. At the w, and of the town the
Behr Yi1suf radiates into numerous branches, which water the
country in every direction; The dilapidated mosque of "situated
here forms a picturesque foreground,

To theN, of the town are the extansive ruins of tlrtmoi1Mtrporie.
Arsinoé, which has been entirely destroyed. The site is now called
Kém Iribris. Many antiquities, both ofthe Roman and tho Christian
period, have been found here, insluding numerous small tenawtta
lamps and many thousand fragments of papyri, intermixed with
pieces of pwehrmsnt, Most of the papyri are Greek (Among them
fragmentn of Hamsx, Euripides, Thuoydides, aiso of a Christian
cateehatical book), many an Arabic ttom the 2nd cent. of the Hts..
gin down to M3 A.D.; snd others Are in Comic, Pehlevi, 8assir-
nide-Pamiun, and Meroitic-Ethiopisn characters. Several fragments
in hieratic and hiareglyphlc characters, the oldegt from the time of
Ramses 111. (about 1300 30), have also been discovered. As the
writings are far the most part tax-papexs, it hag been supposed that
they belonged to a tax ortiiye of the town of (1roeodi1opoiis, where
old papyri also were used. A large number of the payyri found
here were muted by Consul Travers for the Berlin Museum, and
even a Xuger number by Theme, Gxai' and Amhduke Rainer for the
Austrian Museum or Art And Industry at Vienna. The van } exten-
sire cemetery of the town, with its picturesque tombstones, covers
part of the site of the ancient city; the highest of the mmands of
rubbish command a survey ofthe whole of the Fayiim. At the N.
and of tha ruins, about 11 /s Ii.from Mediaeh, M. Sehweinfurth
discovered the remains of a large tampla with a pylnn, in front of
which is a sitting frgtare of Amanemha L, the founder of the 12th
Dym, and inside several slabs with the name of Ramses the Great.
