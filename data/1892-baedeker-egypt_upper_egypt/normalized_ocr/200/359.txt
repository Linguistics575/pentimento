Isis, the life giving goddess of dab, he. of Abaton or the holy is-
land. The last name deserves mention here, for the spot known to
the ancients as Abeton. which must have been peculiarly holy in
their eyes, is mmed innumerable times in the inscriptions of the
temple of Isis. It mast therefore bs leaked for on Philas itself. The
inscription on the Arcbiirave of the outer or West Side states that
the king erected this building for his mother Isis, mad that he re-
built the hail for her of good white hewn stone, surrounded with
columns, with inscriptions throughout its whole extent, end, as the
line below the architmve adds, painted in colours. The inner side
of the architmve bears an invocation to Isis, mother of the gods

This little temple had doors en the B. and W. sides, not,
however, opposite to each other, and another on the N. side, next
the main temple. The last lamb into E spacious Fore- Court
(P1. B), enclosed on the right and left by covered Colonnadu. The
W. eolonmde (PI, F) follows the bank of the river, while that to
the E. or right (PL D) runs in the direction of the centre of the
first great pylon, bat not at right angles to it, affording an example
of the variety of axial direetion exhibited throughout the temple.

When we remember that a portion of the first pylon end the
hypwthral space, which we have just quitted, were built by Necta-
nebue, and that all the other parts of the temple am of later dats,
we have an adequate explanation of the great irregularity displayed
in its plan. It is quite certain that the structures that now hear
the name of Nectanebus (s portal and a vestibule) were not the
only buildings on Phila, nudes: that king, for the construction of
every temple, without exception, began with the sanctuary and
encled with the doors. We may assume that an extensive temple
stood here before its removal by the Persians; and that the latter
largely destroyed the works of their rival. The puts that Vera
spared were then irioorporutei1 by the Ptolemeic builders, while the
Romans united the work ot the Lagide with the ancient vestibule
of Nectenebus by means of the teeming peristyle calm.
