at Thebes. KARNAK. ll, mm. 123

"sud happened to the moon, which plunged all Egypt in alarm,
This was probably a. Inna: eclipse t. In the left wing, on the N.
wall, Amman appears presenting Osorkan L with the notched
stsit of years and the sword of Victory; beneath, the king drinks
the milk of llts from the breast of Hathor; and adjacent is 0sor-
kon as a youth with the crown, to whom Khnum hands the symbol
of life.

Befora proceeding on our way towards the sanctuazy, we must
Kaspect a most important historical monument which nwas its origin
to Shaabenk T, (the 8hiehak of the Bible), launder ot tha dynasty
of the Bubastites. This is on the outside oftha S. Wait ofthe temple
of Ammon, and is easily found, Issuing from the doorway of the
Portico of the Bubastites, we tum to the left, and immediately tind
ourselves in front of this imponunt representation. The massive form
of the king, wearing the double crown, appaars brandishing his
weapon over a band of foes with pointed beards, who raise their arms
in srrpprtcseom Farther to tha left is, the large Mure ofAmmnn, with
the double feather onhis head, grasping in his right hand the sword
ofvicmry and in his left cords birtdinghve rows of captives with Mme-
iabeig. Foes with pointed beards kneel before him am ] beg for mercy
with ugliftm bands. The portrait of King Sheshenk was left unihaigh-
ed, the 1nttiine drawing of the crown being still visible on the stone.
Bis canouche sad the inscriptions placed in his and Ammon's mouth
are: more distinct. Beneath Amman appeus the goddess of Thebes

with the symbol of the nome of the city or Ammon uponher

head. In her left hand she holds a bow and arrow, in her right a
battls'ua and six papyxus cards, which unite tNe rows of names or
towns, nurmounted by busts. These are the names of place: besieged
And captured by Sheshenk in his campaign against mshobotrm, and
we hue thus a colhteul corroboration or the Biblical msrrative, such
as has not been fbuad for any other portion of the Old Testament.

The Biblical pulages are "follows: 1 Kings XIV, 26-26:'And it came
My pm in the lam: yeast of king Rehobaam, 11m sumac kim: "Egyvt
came up agninn Jeruulem: And he took away the "etssiiares of tho Muse
of the Lord, And the Croawres "the king's house; he even took away
all; and he took away Ml the "isles of gold which Solomon had made',
9nd 0tsrors. XXL, 24 a 9;'And "came :0 pus, chm, in Hm iitth year of
Rohuhosm, 5mm; king of mm came up ngaim Jerusaxem beuune
they b & d lrnnngreuetl against the Lord, With twelve hundtrail charm",
and: hroascore thousand horsemen; and Re people wars without number

t It reads thus: "In the year etc..... the heavens did not swallow
um moon', This may possibly refer to the appearance of a new moon
on m mm 1qrmMitstely succaading the last appearance "the 01d moon,
without the unull Jnbervgrhtiot1 of a. muonlaaa night A 3 phexmmenon
Which in possible in Carmin exceptional eireumMatureg, But if, u Comb
win suggests' insmd of, _n_. mat, -w- a is to be takesn, it would read
"In the you etc.... the heavens swallowed the; moon", and we should
have t direct mention 0f 3 lunar eclipse. _
