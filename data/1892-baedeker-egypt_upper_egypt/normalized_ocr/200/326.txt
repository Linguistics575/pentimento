to be observed at the beginning of its gradual rise (the ibth Epiphi), the

Various opinions have been expressed as to the reason of the
special reverence paid to the Nile at this particular demo. The
narrows of Silsileh wem perhaps ditfiet1lt or aven impossible to

the second entrance of tha river inn) Peypt, the ftrgt being at the
cataract at Assabn, This is the more probable as K6m Omho was
certainly reckoned as belonging to Nubia.

Between the ahovo-mentioned chapels ofRautses If. and Marea-
ptsh, is' small Stale erected by the mayor Punched (p. 257), who
appears here along with a son of the king accompanying the king
before Ammon. The prayer is tuh1rtysseil not only to Amman, but
also to the'holy water' (mu ab, sea above) and to th I S k.
