this Bsh, which sypmrs not only on the come, bat in also reprew
seated with the disc between the horns, was used as a symbollcsl
xepresentation ot Khrtua1-Rs, especially m; we actually find Khnum

united with the tish on the mrar-wa11 of the temple%,

The SIDE WALLS are entirely covered with paintings and ia-
scriptions. The former show the king making ofrsrittgB to various
divinities of the temple, who promise him in return the good things
of life, At the foot of the wall to the right of the entrance is the
emperor Commodus with Am√©ris and Khnum capturing with I net
the various products of the Nile (births, iiehes, punts, em). On the
other side of the net is Safekh. This symbolicel representation P'-'
sibly refers to the legend according to which Horus fighting against
8eth-Typhon fell deed into the water and was drawn out of it

flat plinths, and shafts moat ehborately adorned with inscriptions.
The Capitals are of vuious shapes and of unequal height, but this
