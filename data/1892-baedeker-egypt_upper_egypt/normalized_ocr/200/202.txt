the colours are still vivid, displays some curious deities, probably
Ethiopian, but only the upper parts of the paintings are now visible.

We now return to the auorway owning to the S., batween the
third and fourth pylons (p. 132), upon which is tlm czartouche of

Ramses IX. Cg LJ Ra ncfer ka, To the 8.W, of this point, in an

irragular line and at varying distances mm; each other, are Pylons
VIII, IX, X, and Ef. From the last of these an Menus of sphinxea
(now concealed by a small wood.) stretches to the temple of Muth.
Pylon XI is turned towards this ammo, bat the pylons X, IX, and
VIII, succeeding each other towards'the N., gradually eitiset the
transition to the great temple of Ammon by their position and the
angle they stand at with reference to the s. wall of the great temple;
for, us will be seen from the Plan, none of them is exactly pnmllel
with that wall. This four yylnns am commuted with each othex by
side-walis running at irregular anglas, and thus anclosing four
courts, which, hnwever, are no longer clearly detlned owing to gaps
in the walls. Through those four gatoways passed the aneiont pro-
cessionai route, which began at the temple of Math, in which ware
the statues of Sekhet (p. 148), and ended at the temyle of Ammou
in ths space with the two obelisks (p. 132), which may be regarded
as the vestibule of the sauctuazy.

The series of four Courts between the prions, which we now
visit, had an aggregate length of 310 y ds. (not reckoning the Sphinx-
avenue). lt was begun in the early times of the 18th Dru. (Tut-
mes L), and Was afterwards several times enlarged and adorned.
Beginning at the gateway of Ramses IE. (see above), we haw on
our right the fragment of wall (probably datingi from Semi L) on
the W. side of which is the famous treaty (p.i i2), and on the
left the wail running to meet Pylon VIII, and probably dating like
that pylon from Tutmes m, On the front of this latter wall king
Merenptah, son of Ramses IL, caused an inscription of great inter;
est to be carved.
