wall as from the W., and even for those sdmmeing through the
series of Pylons on the S. -it is improbable that Gambyses caused
the destruction of this'heart' of the worship nf Amman, if we may
use that expression, and Nectanebus, who was a mighty builder
would certainly have restored it, bad it been injured. On the other
hand, nothing is more likely than that one or the later Persian
kings selected this temple for destruction Mter same abortive in-
surrection on the part of the Egyptians' in (min to punish the re-
bellious province in its most sensitive part. Ptolemy Sonar, who
held the rains for Philip Aridmus, could have found no easier way
to win the hearts of his mw subjects than to restore the holy places
destroyed try the Persians; while to do 50 was to imitate Alex-
ander the Great. In this partitular case the work was not diNeuit,
for though new seuiptures had to be provided for the adytum, its
want; were for the most part still standing In the dtiiest'ton-
inscription in the interior of the sanctuary, Philip rewrds merely
that he had restored with granite the sanctuary which was falling
to rain,'which was built in the time of Tntmea m., king of
Upper and Lower Egypt'; and a fragment of the older structure,
bearing on its upper side a reprsser1tstion of Tntmas olfering gifts

the reddish stone, Amman in both his main characters (Amman
Generator and Amman king of the pods) receives Hm homage of
Philip, or rather of the representative of the royal house of Macedon,
for it is certain that Philip never entered the valley of the Nile. Meth
of course 3150 appears with Ammo, and once is depicted as
embracing him, an absolutely unique Iepresentation. The traveller
will sass with surprise in this sacred spot a rermssontMion of tho
king, under the auspires of Khmun, catching birds with * mat, and
promising to bestow his booty upon Amman.

The Exterior Walls of tha holy of howls are coverea with numer-

in solemn procession to the snnctuary, and the king offering toar
nalvea or different colours (perhaps symbolizing the nations of the
four quarters of the globe, over which he watched as shepherd of
the people ]. The inscription records that Ammon-Ra, the ball (husk
