of the kingdom, hora the title of an erpa ha or prime, governed
the name of Meh. in time of grease, and commanded a division of

ed on a throne with _ feet, holding his communist"; baton in
his haud. Inside the deer are two well-preserved inscriptions,
eat in the stone. That to the right (8.) informs us that Amenemha
depsrted thin life in the 43rd gear of [ hertaaan L, trorztrepomung
to the 25th year of the gnvernerahip of Ameni. He undertook all
his van'sailing ap-str-' :---) he campaigned only: gainst
the dwellers of the 8., the'misernhle Kuahites', as they are called
in the inscriytion. In those days the arms of the Pharaohs had not
yet been carried towards the E. The Sinai peninsula, with its
mines, is the only Mamet in this direutlon which excited the Egyp-
tion lust of mnqnest. From his southern campaigns Amenemha
brought home much gold and other booty. The inscription to the

feelings of this It-game time, Amenemha deseritrem his Mmpm
