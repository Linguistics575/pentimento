On Each side of tha Nile, here interrupted by three islands,
stretches a wide belt of fertile land, hounded both on the E. and
W. by Iauges of hills, displaying a bolder and more iitiinite for-
matlon than is usually the case with the mountains that funk ths
ri-llar 0n the E, the ridge, overtopped by Ihusly shaped
peaks, retires farther from the stream than on the w, The fertile
strip ends as abruptly at the foot of the barren iimisstaus-tsiitm
as a lawn adjoining a gravai-Walk in a garden. Most of the min-
ed temples are situated in the level district and are reached by
the waters of the Nile when the inundatious am at their highest;
while the tombs are ban in the Mnks of the hiils, where their
dark openings are so numerous, that the E. slope of the Libyan
range might be aptly tompued to 3 piece of cork or to a honeycomb.
Viawed from the river, the sita "ancient Thebes prasoma the ap-
yearance o! a wide mountorirwgirt basin or vallay richly endowed with
the gifts of mwerdsir1ng fertility. Nature here revels in perpetual
youth, while the most enormous tydifieBs ever rented by mortal hand,
though grey, desolate, and succumbing to the cnmmcu fate of all
human handiwork, yet compel the admiration of posterity tor the
Wonderful race that has left such mighty memorials of ite exismnce
_ memorials that have indeed been injured but not annihilated in
the flight of thousands of years. The verdant crops and palms which
everywhere cheat the traveller as soon as he has quilted the desert,
the splendid hues that tinge the valley every morning and evening,
the brilliant, unckmded sunshine that bathes every object in the
winter season, and the inspiring feeling that every hour is enriching
the imagination with new and strange pictures, wholly prevents in
Thebes the visa of that melancholy which so often steals over the
mind in presence of the relics of hy-gone greatness and of vanished
msgnithreatme

The various monuments are situated as follows. On the right
(E. bank) risen the Templa of Luxor, now occupied by dwellings,
and to the N. am the immense wins ot Karmrk, formerly connected
with it. Beyond these monuments lay the streets of ancient Thebes.
Farther to tha N. is another extausive temple-sw; "Mtsdsmtrt,
which must he regardad as occupying the site of a suburb of Thebes.
On the left 0V.) beak was the Neuropoliu, with vaults in the rock
and many mortuary tamples. Each of these had its large annexe
for the priasthood, schools, or libraries. The templss were ndjoined
by groves and lakes, and from enciam commercial contracts we
gather that one quarter of the citizen: dwelt here, Nearer the
mountains stood the houses of the emhalmers, xefugvs for visitors
to the necropolie, shops for the sale of numerous articles which the
Egyptians were accustomed to bring us offerings to their nncestms,
stablea for the sacred animals, and suughtm-hoairepdor thal cattle
