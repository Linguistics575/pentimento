was sacred to Khan, i.e, Amman during the ymcaas of his "ir-pro-
creation, and may be regarded as one of the greatest of the Egyptian
festivals, as even among the representations in the Eamessenm and
elsewhere a conspicuous place is given to it. It might welt he solemn-
ized in a Mcmxmnium, for Khem caused the new birth of the dead
god, and the soul separated trom the body arose to new life, a tha
vanishad orb of night returns at the new moon. As the inscription
of Atuaum-eo-rreb Says, the heir to the throne succeeded the dead
Pharaoh on the following iiay, just as { me moon succeeds another
after a moonless night. The inscription shove the raliefs would still
preserve for us their subject es'en if the latter had disappeared, It
runs as follows:'In the month Pakhon, at the festival of the god
Khem, at the appearance of the light of the Moon-god. The king,
Growned with his helmet, tomes in his litter. The body-guard goes
bcfore him. Each hams at his side shield, spear, and sword. Ths
lords ofhis retimle, the higher and lower oil1eisrsi name behind him,
and aftar them the princes and warriors. The thin! omiox ot feati-
v3.15 (hherheb) tonducts the festival of bis father Khan }, while the
king presents to bis father Khem great offerings of bread, beer,
cattle, geese, sud all good things. Khemtthe lord of Sen, is brought

god, Then also appear before the god hie vowed servants, with por-

Beaters. No more follows, for the god pisses himself dawn upon his
staircase, andHisMajesty offers a gmzt stHrritige to his father Khem,
the musort (hull) of his mother. Behold, them algo is the whim
ball before His Majesty, etc.'... In presence of the living king and
of the royal ancestral images an attendant brings the hhck hllde of
a sickle inlaid with gold, and' sheaf of torn, and presents them to
the king, Then the ranger (mamit), walking; round the king seven
times, says'The king has reaped with the sickle tbat is in his
hand, he raises it to his nose, he lays it down before Khem, who
gives the king the harvest. The king quits the staircase, tum: to
the N., and walks round the staircase, etc. - We shall now see how
this description is illustrated by the reliefs.
