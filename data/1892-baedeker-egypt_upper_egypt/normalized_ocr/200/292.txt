The third terrace was formed by the roof of this ban, on the
inner wall of which were the abtyzts-iieHrribed paintings, together
with a Ttmple, placed in the cenu-e and supported by round columns
and by the ground behind. me this terrace a wsrl1-prsserved
grsnito doorway leads to the burial chambers lying behind { see
below.

Agthe end of this terrace to the left there is s remarkable small
Sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Rather, and built by Hatasa and
her husband-brother Tutmes Il., which should not be left unvisited.
The two outer rooms are in ruins, so that even the partition-wxlls
betweeen the halls lying one behind the other are scarcely recogniZw
able. Some of the pillars and buses of the columns, however, are
still upright. We mm to the right and find the remains of a Hamm-
Cow, There are also some more paintings of ships, bat very faint.

of the door is Tutmes III. (Ba-msn-kit-ks), and within Tut-
mes II. who built the door and gave his name to it.

another long room with amt blue veiling, ornamented with red stars
at one time probably gilt. On each side of this funeral chamber
am nichee. Next he a narrow mom with two nichgs, At the back
of this last on the two side-walls above the shaft is an exceedingly
interesting'Representation of Queen Hamel }, drinking the milk of
life trom the udders of the Hathor Cow. The cow is the iitost piece
of animal painting which has come down to us from Egyptian Mb-
tiquity. The cartouche or the queen was eaased, probably by enler
of her indignant ward Tutmes 111. when he became independent.
All the inscriptions and paintings in this mom (cynecephsli, lions,
etc.) are perfect in style; those in the niches tell us that these were
used for the storing of offerings.

The Iast or Faurtln Terrace is badly preserved, We first come to
a granite doorway built by Tutmes IIL en the central path, on the
left hand side of which we see an inscription of the 3rd year of
Merenptah L Next we tench the tower and fragments Orwell, both
