Guarani. Until & few years age Komsko was the chief emporium
and port of shipment for the caravans crossing the desert to or from
Abu I.ramed, which lies 8-10 long days' journey distant (see below).
This road avoided the, three upper cataracta) which are not navigable
when the river is low, and it also shartened the journey considerably
by cutting off the windings of the Nile, Rusaegger, Lepsins, and
finaiiy Gordon (i884) selected it an their way to khartiha. A short
excursion along this desert-router, between the hills, black with
iroa-seshs, is not uninteresting; or the trevellel may ascend (y, hr.;
steep and stony) the hill of Awas cl-Guardmi, close to Korusko. On
the summit is the tomb of the saint to whom the hill owes its
name, 3 frequented piigr'urwritsort. The view extends ever the Nile

A little beyond Kurusko the Nile valley trends tothe N.W., "that
the N, windwhlch prevails in winter frequently retards navigation. On
the left bank rises a picturesque chain of hills, In this reach tts-
vtylirsrs have a chance of seeing emeodiles, which frequent the sand..
banks and lay their eggs in the clefts of the shore. Recently, hom-
ever, they have become somewhat rare. On the w, bank the
ineonapicuous Temple af'Amddah, 8 M. from Komako, comes in
sight. It Iies deeply sunk in the desert-sand, while on the opposite
bank a taWwateit strip with many trees sustches between the river
and the hills. Paesengexs by Cook's steamers have an opportunity of
visiting this temple.

The Temple of'Ava-h has a very unpretending exterior and
seems at first hardly worthy of a visit. Yet it is in reality of great
interest both for "iaagitie. and ordinary travellers as an excellent.'E-
amylo of the graceful and elegant architecture of the i8th Byte, un-
der which it was built. Nothing is left of the front of the entrance"
hall except the doorway; and the structure of Nile bricks adjoining
tho latter indicates that the temple has been used as a mosque or
"the tomb ofa ealnt. (A Mohammedan cupote, removed only a few
