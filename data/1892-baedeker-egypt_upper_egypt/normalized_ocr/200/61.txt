The parties or vestibule of this tomb deserves particular atten-
tion, as it net only possesses proto-Dork columns resembling those
of Tomb 1, bat arsa shows some architectural farms, which Â£66m
intanded to reproduce the beams and rafters of bailiiitsgs above
ground, The rvornice projects strongly above the arghitmve and
is supported by this luths hcwn, like MI the rest of the structure,
oat of the living rock. The resemblance of these Iaths to the Inn.
tulcs of the Doric order is not especially striking in itself, but taken
in conjunction with other points of similarity is, perhaps, worthy of
mention. - The interior of Khnumhotep's tomb is richly adorned
with paintings. Mast of the representations were painted on a thin
layer of stucco, with which tha limestone walls were coated. At the
foot, however, is a long inscription cut in the rock, in lines of:
greenish colour, 2h ft. high. [ In 1890 the royal names were out
out of thi: rock by some vandal hand and offered for sue. ] From this
inscription we receive information shout the family of Khnamhousp,
who owed the greater part of bis dignitics to his maternal grand-
father, about big relatimm with Amenamha u., who, at the iater..
cession of his mother, made him a royal governor, and about Hm
bstaetity he, had conferred on his government and Ita people and the
honour he had done to the gods of his noun: and the memes of his
forefathers. T

The paintings have unfortunately isaiftrral so much in the Inst
30 or 40 years, that the subjects of some of them are now almost
indistinguishable. Most of them, however, wen; wpied by Lepsius,
Raseuini, Wilkinaon, and others, while they were still in fair pre-
eexvaliou; and they have furnished moat impuztant wntributiuns to
our knuwledge of the private life of the ancient Egypti8ms. In the
uppermost row of paintings, above the door, was psprssenttsrd the
festival of the opening of the tomb of Khmuuhotep.'The Lssren
opens', says the iasrarptiau,'as the god (tie. the deceased tank
formed into Osiris) steps forth', To the right, lower down, we sea
the eoitmnados or Khuumhotep's dwelling, with servants measuring
and registering his tremues and (further on) bringing his (3qu ium
the barns. Two of the lower rows shew the operations at ploughing,
harvesting, and threshing, Still lower down is a Nile-boat, hear-
ing the mummy M the deceased, as the inscription iufarms us, to
Abydos (the grave of Osiris), while the high-priest imparts his
blessing. Belowi IS a representation of the vintage and of the gathen
ing of fruit and vegetables. The cattle in thewater and the thsUug
scene (at the foot) vividly recall } the similar arenas in the Mastaba
of Ti. To the left of the door, high up, are seen the processes of
preparing clay for pottery and sawing woo
