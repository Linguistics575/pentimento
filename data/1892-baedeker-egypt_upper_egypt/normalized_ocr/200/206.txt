tho slender Ptolemaic Pylon XII and beyond it to ths tampla of
Khunsu proper, Which Lies 3 little farther N. The temple is beauth
fully proportioned, in many places adorned with remarkable care,
and in various respects of great interest. It was erected by Itam-
sex HL in honour of Kbunm, i.e. the god who represents, so to
speak, the youthful Ammon in the triad of Thebes. Elsewhere, it
may hem be noted, Khunsu is conceivm of almost as the moon-god
(with the ehud's lock of hair on his templa and the pascetit-mtatm
on his Mad), and thus identified with Thoth-Hermes. Just as
Amman is called the soul of Rs, so Khunsa is to be regarded as the
spiritual quinmssanca of the earlier moomgod, anti may be named,

and afterwards:'Peraous whom he (RamsasIIL) gave to Pa Kimmu

appear to have been two different temples, srsjetel to Kluu1sa, Tim
