t the'Dwelliug of the golden and, or the'Chamber of the
golden-beaming one' -'of the noble--of the beautiful - of the
gnddese', also'the room of the great throne' -'the repository of
the sacred host', the'ssrtotmrry'i. Here the lord of Egypt alone
is depicted. He, the living type of the beautiful Home, the son of
the sun, the child of Hathor (ps the Pharaoh is frequently named
in this temyle of Ember), the visible'epresetttatNe of the deity,
and as ruler of Egypt the incorporation of all the temporal interests
of the state, be it wee alone, to judge from the representations and
inscriptions, whose sacred person might enter the holy of holies and
in solitude nommune with the deity, 0an once a year was this
permitted even to him, at the great festival of the New Year. We
here see the monarch opening the door of the sacred calla, closed
with a sealed band of bybloe. Be breaks the seal and rammes the
strip of hyblos (sash tebtu and mm- atom). he places his hands in
the two rings Wt the door and thrusts back the bolts, ascends the
steps leading to the cella, and finally gazes upon the hidden tigtlte
of the. goedese, end MNrs his homage. Other designs exhibit the
monarch performing the prescribed aeremonies of oflerlng innenee
before the two snared beats of Hathor end her mmpeuion, Home of
Edfu, and hefera the boats of Isis and hat companion Osiris, The
portable heats (Tesmefm, LL'the heaters of beauties'), which are
here depicted on the side-wirus, formerly stood in Room A, and
held the shrines in which were the sacred images of the deities.
The shrines were carried in solemn processions by the priests,
sometimes without the heats, as c.g. "the new year's festival rev
presented on the staircase (p. 91), and sometimes standing in the
boats.

The 8ide-rooms of the Adytum are, 35 mentioned above, entered
from carridor a, Behind the Adytnm, to the 8., lies No. I, the
Large Chamber, the largest and most sacred or these sid-isis.
Tho sanctity of this chamber is evidenced by the, painting, in which
the king is portrayed exactly as in the Adytum itself, ascending the
steps to the shrine of Hathor, breaking the seal, and opening the
doors, grasping the handles in his hands, Noteworthy ehao are the
representations of the king ofreriug vases ef wine to Hathor and
to Ahi, her SOR, in eaeh vase followed by a harp-playing goddess of
the north and of the south. Two other pictures represent Pepi, the
original builder of the temple o, 81), kneeling hefore Hathot,
hearing Ahi in his hands, and the later builder with e minor before
tho goddess in a double shrine. The inscriptions give the dimen-
sions of thee images and state that they were made of gold, as that
