a fortrese on the Orautes, probably situated on an island near Hume
(Emesa). Neuter the centre, the king huxrias to the tight, with
bended bow, Above the rearing and spirited hursee in his chariot
am the woxde: They most excellent horse of his majesty Miamun
from the stable of Ramses IL, the beloved of Ammon'. In the in-
scription within the bent bow the Pharaoh is named the beloved of
Mentn, god of war. The royal leader overwhelms his foes with his
impetuous attack and hurls them with their horses and chnriote
into the tttrealm Some of the Egyptisna are put to iiight, and a
legion of archexs hasten in climate to the aid of the Pharaoh. Among
the slain are various noble Aramaic warriors considered worthy of
being specially mentioned t for their names are inscribed above
them. One of these was Rhirapseor, hisioriographtsr of the Khan;
prince, whose dead body is represented beside the hind legs of the
king's horses, between two lines of hieroglyphics. A short 1'2.dine
inseriptioa in front of tha elaborately decorated heads of the king's
horses (the bridle is surmounted with lion's heads and feathers ]

of the gods end his own right arm forms the subject of the epic,
which has been preserved not only upon the walk of templea but
also in, pagyrus-roll. Its chief contents have been given elsewhere

the warlike career of Ramses, while a repetition of the same subject
on the W. aide of the second pylon and the inscription on the
architrave in the second court of the temple, inform us that the
Ramesseum Was erected by Ramses Tr. as * Votive Building in
gratitude for his deliverance out of the hands of 2500 enemies.

To the extreme right, in front of the horses of the king, eppems
that the confused mass of men and horses overthrown by the royal
hero, Beside three Egyptians who hold an Asiatic head downward,
is the inscription:'The miserable lord of Khileb (KhsWbtm-A1epp0
