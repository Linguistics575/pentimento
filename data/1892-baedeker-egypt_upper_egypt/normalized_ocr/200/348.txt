the same, especially when one beholds tho placid surface or the
river to the S. of Philm, one can sympathize with the question of
the "naree1idi Ashoreus in Lucan:'Who would have snpposexl that
thou, Oh gently-flowing Nile, wouldst burst forth with Violent
Whirlpools into such wild mga?' When the river is high all thtt
rocks In the bed of the stream are under water; but in February
and March Even the amaller rocks are visible. ftseeriptt'ons are found
cm many of these, and on all the trstsrset-islsnds, twenty in number.
The smooth glam, like a dark mama }, which covers the granite »
rocks between this point and Phila will not escape notica.

A few yards to the S. of the cataract lie the pleasant villages
or3EahgiUh and 31mm, shaded by palms and sycamores. In Ma-
htuieh huge piles of dried dates lie in the open Mr, brought hither
from Nubia for transport to Egypt. At this point begins the passage
of the rapids downstream; and boats (or dhahabiyehs for large par-
ties) may be hired hers, if desired, for the safe voyage to Phila,
through a picturesque roaky landscape. Allargain should be struck
before the boat is entered. A small boat costs IO plagues by tariff;
a dhahabiyeh not less than 10 ft, This boatman demand much larger
sums at Mst.
