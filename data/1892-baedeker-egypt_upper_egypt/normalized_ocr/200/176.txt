at Therm KARNAK. 11, Roma 119

The Arehiteehmie Features of the court mast ha noticed before we
proeeed to examine its ussst It is 275 ft. deep and 338 ft, wide,
and covers in area of 9755 sq.yds, On each side a kind of colonnade
or atoa is formed by a row of columns and the exterior wall. Eighteun
columns still stand (an the left side, but the row on the right was in-
terrupted by Ramses m, who has ham placed ammpla (Pl. 0), pro-
jecting considerably beyond the S. wall, and at right angles to it, Both
rows of colnmne are unseutptureds Another small temple (Pi. B) was
built in the NE, angle of the court by fikti II. Merenptah. Both
"these smaller temples are later'tiditions, with no reference to the
purpose of the court, and they interfere with the affect deaigned by
the original builder. The double row of huge columns in front of
the doorway of the eecond pylon was, an the other hand, part of the
oxiginal plan. The lofty shafts, which were terminated by ealyz-
capieals of gigantic proportions, taper towards the top, and contract
rapidly immediately above the convex bases on which they stand.
The cawx of the capitals was surrounded with petals, from amidst
which slender msrsh-pHnts sprang. In the centre of each was a
cubical abacus, serving as a pedestal for an image of 3 god. Marietta
conjectured that a small hypathrsl templa (like that at Phiiae) stooal
in from. of the secund pylon, and that not only was there an tddi-
tional (sixth) pair of columns adjoining the others but that the
vaulting of tha whole was rendered possible by two central columns
between the pairs at each end which are about 36 ft. ayart. As,
however, there is not the faintest trace of these conjectunl six
cmumns, it is perhaps more probable that this cofannade "pre-
sents a processioml oz triumphhl avenue, formerly covated only
by a velarium, and that the continuation of it is to be recognized
in the elevated central row of celunms in tho hypostyle hall (p. 126).
Of the original columna only ilvty can now be traced on the left
side, and one on the right, close to the "eoni1 pyion, which termiu
natea the paxistyla on the E. Three still show about Vs of the
original height, one about l/o, and another about I/r, the only com-
plete oolumn is on the right Upon this last Ptammetiklt L, of the
26th Dym, has placed his name overthat ofthe Ethiopian Taharka,
of the 25th Dym; above, on the abacus, is the name of Ptolemy IV.
Philopator, which also appears on the recantly excavated haae of
one of the broken columns. The shaft is composed of 36 courses of
carefully hewn stone, the capital of 5 coarsest The height is 69 ft.;
the greatest breadth of the capital 18 ft., the oiriausnfssenoe at tho
top 49 ft. - The Mrovts-rnantr'onad hecond pylon, on the E. side of
the court, is mostly in ruins. Before the doorway is an autecham-
bar (Pl. tr), the entrance in which was flanked by two atatues of
Ramses II. The Marty on the left side has fallen down; that on
ths right, broken at the top, displays excellent workmanship,
especially in the legs, and racaUs the Daedalian figargs of the earliest
pariada of Greek am
