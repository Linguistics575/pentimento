20 mm I. DER JrN-NAKHrErL From Cam

Those who are interested in Christian antiquities ahould follow
the F. bank Rom Shékh'Ah'adeh towards the S.+ In about'h hr.,
after passing some ruins of a late epoch, we reach the Big Aim
Hamil [ Convent of St, John), called also simply td-DV, 1n the
days of the Mameluke pemreeatiorts the Christiane are said to have
lived here auil at Shékh'Abideh lu cumparative security, as the
Arabs believed that no Mohammad" could exist here on account
of the evil spirits. At present there axe more fellahiu here than
Gopta. There is little to be seen at ed-Dér. The crypt, in which
divine service is held, is eaid to date from the time of the Em-
Press Helena. By ascending the hill "the hack of the houses, we
mach, to the left of the ravine, some cave-like quarries, which
were Mted up as Shristism chayels and were embellished at an early
date with sculptures. The main chamber contains paintings of saints
and aoenes from the New Testsment, but those in one of the side
chapels (Raising of Lazarus, Wedding at cans, eta) are better.
To Judge from their style these interesting pictures are not earliex
than the 6th cent. AD. Among the Coptic monks who reaided here
(from the 4th cent. onwards) were Victor and his brother Koluthus,
SiHurius, 3nd Macxrins; and the tombs of the last two-are still
shown. The adjoining quarry was begun by Amanhoiep III.

Aboat% hr. beyond Dér Alta Hennis we reach 205! en-Nakhlah,
the'aonvent of the data-yulms'. To reach the "Tomb with the pe-
prenmlation of the trsmgportation of a Colossus, we cross the dry
watercourse beyond the houses, ascend the hilt on the left side,
and near the top reach a path on which, a little to the right, the
grave is situated. Guides may be procured for a few paras. Trav-
ellers descending the river ahouid visit the tomb from Beulah,
above which towers the rocky Gcbed Shfkh Sa'id (with a shekts's
bomb), in which the tomb in question is hollowed out, The whole
district be1itngisd to the name of Un or Hermopolis. The represenv
tation in this tomb is highly interesting as being the only one that
gives us an idea of tho procesaes used by the Egyptians in moving
their £0105st statues.

Ths Arabs thought- it imposaihlu that mere human strength could
move such hugs burden, and hence a legend grew up among them that
the subjects of the Phamem were giants, Who knew how 20 move masses
of rock with their magical mm. Even ma man of the preset" day, at
whose commit! stand forces (at which the anaient Egyptians never even
dreamed, are Mlomn'led at their achievements in this direction and feel
inclined lo solve the pru'hlem by asaribing w mm the use of minim
aids, which n have no evidencu um may posmsssed. The pyinciples at
the pulley Ind the lever seem to bus: been unI-umwn to them; and ob-
atsclap, which seem to us to demnnd imporutivgly the application of
5mm m1 machinery, were overcuma by enm'mnus multiplication ofsheer
humm power.
