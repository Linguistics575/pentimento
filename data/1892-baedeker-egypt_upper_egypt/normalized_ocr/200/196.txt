scanty relics of the earliest recognizable buildings of the temple of
the t2th Dymsty. Farther on, in the axis of the sanctuary, axe two
squaze gnuita bases, one behind the other, being the relies of
aixteen-sided aolumna, with the name of Usertesta I. A little
farther to the E. is the doorwsy of the -

Grout Coleman of Tubman ULUPI. H). The reports ofthe mili-
tary success ufthis puma, which we have justparused, telling us of tha
enormous wealth at his disposal, and still more the reverence which
we see him paying to Amman at awry turn, pregame us to iiud in
this temple some important building reared by him to his divine
patron. Th5 space to the W. of tha ancient sanctuary had already
been ocuupied by the 1si1iilees Of his ancestors, so that, as his new
building was sho to maintain connection with the holy place, he
was forced to build. on the site to the E We have already wen
how, contrary to the usual custom, he provided the sacred granite-
cham'ber with a second doorway (opening to the RI). The form and
nppeamnca of the courts and chambers that lay between the sam-
tuary and the colonnade cannot now be determined, for they hams
been utterly deatruyed. The ancient holy place built by the kings
of tho 12th Dyn. was probably surrounded by two concentric walls,
separated by an archway or passage. The culounaded hall, which
We enter by the e, entrsl door, is 144 ft wide and 52it. deep, The
reef was supported by 20 columns in two rows; while 32 square pil-
lars (14 "the sides, d at the ends) foxmad four galleries with the
waUs of the hall. The pillars, though not so tall as the columns, were
of the same height "the walls, sad with the latter supportad tha
rsrofitsg slabs. As the miti√©le of the hall was tlgo roofed, a small
wall, with sloping exterior and decanted with the astrsgal and CAW-
cavu cornice, rose from the rout above the pillars and walls to the
height of the columns in the centre. There was thus formed a kind
of clarestory, which was provided with rectangular windows, broader
than they were high, in order to admit light to the hall. Ths central
columna belong to a peculiar order, the various parts of which on
the shaft and capital were indicated only by yaiuting. They have
raceived the name of'inverted etsbyz-eapitsb8', hecsuse the bells or
calyces Were placed inverted on the smooth shMts, which were
painted a dark red and adorned with vertical inscriptions, recalling
the similar decoration of the central panels of the ituttyd polygonal
columns. Asthe edge of the tlow-Irs rested upun the end of the
shaft, the latter asxprndird at the top, with some abrupmess; am }
the ummli had in consequence to be placed somewhat low down
on the cylindrical emit (below the beginning of the expansion),
to save them from the appearance of slipping down. The uapitala
are adomad with calyx- or msrsVylsats, the tips of whieh, of couxsb,
