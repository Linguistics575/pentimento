Beginning at the E. Pylon of Nectanebus (p. lit), we skirt the
giros-wtslt of the great temple of Ammon, first to the ti. and then
to the W. (left), until We see upon the right or N, side of our path
another girdle-wall of Nile-bricks. Within this lies a ruined Tampa
(Pl. N), the axis of whieh lies S.W. andN.E.. Like theN. py10n [ ses
below) it was dedioated to Mentu, the god ufwnr, and is frequently
mentioned on demotic tiles (ostraca). Stretching Na. from this
building is an avenue of aphinxes, which we reach an passing
through the door of a wsl1-prsssermsd Pylon, Little now remaiixs of
the temple, which dates from the mm of Amenhotep IG, of me
18th Dyn. (who also erected two obelisks, as appears from a frag-
mentm'y inscription found hero), though it WAS subsequently several
times enlarged between the reign of Ramses IV. aml the epoch or
the Ptolemies, especially by Ptolemy w. Philopatox. Ptolemy II.
Philsdttlphas and Ptolemy m. Euargetas have recorded their names
here, and there is also a stone bearing the name of'Rsmses'. The
earlier sculpturas and ambiteciuml fragments are of great beauty;
and columns with mthot capitals were also empluyed. The Mtove-
monlioned Pylon (Pl, VII), the most N, pan of the eyditheay now
remaining, was founded by Ptolemy H. At its fact is a list of

boys are shy of accompanying travellers to this spot towards evening,
as it is said to be haunted by an LUrit or devil. It is called by the
natives Bab sr-'Abld, or gate ofthe 1iagrsy_s, probably on amount
of some of the representations on its walls.

From the pylon we proeesd to the SW, passing the remains of
a Pwlemaic tompiaZU'L o), of whiuh the staircase is still to be
seen, to another Tempbc, consisting of six small shambers (Pl, k
to p). The second from the W, (Pl. 1) contains the name of Ame-
niritis, with that of her brother Sabako. The iMe alzbastar statub
