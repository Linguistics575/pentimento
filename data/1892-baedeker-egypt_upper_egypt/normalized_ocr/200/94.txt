61/g M. Akhmim, a steamboat and mail station on the E. bank,
also reached from Solrhy by a shorter land-mutc, is a thriving little
town with about 10,000 inhah., including 1000 Christians, sum:
of whom are Roman Catholics, with a chapel of their own. The
weekly market on Wed. is much frequented, and the bazaar is well,
ztoaked. The numerous cotton mills produce the cloth for the blue
shirts of the felléhin and for the long abéla (pi. velb8h $ t), or shawia
with fringes, which the poorer classes wear on state occasions and
for proteetiors against cold. These articles, which have been made
here since the time of Straho, axe extraordinarily cheap. Akhmim
stands on the site of Rhemm's or Pammlis, generally held to be the
most ancient town on the Nile, though this honour prohably belongs
to the venerable This-Abydos, on the W. bank (p, 53). The deity
specially venerated here was the form of Amman Generate: known
as Amman Rheum, also called at a later date Min, an appellation
mrmeit try dropping the Khem and sbbrevisting the Amen. Thus
it is called Equ, Le. belonging to Min. For a figure of this dnity,
who appears in the most ancient texts, see Baadeker'a Lower Egypt,
