colonial, and the various subsidiary details, is still not rrtdmptrsirrg;
and the whole entrmce to the tampla at Luxor is unusually pie-
tumsque, perhaps on account of the very abundance of small details
which are unrestrainedly placed here aide by side with the huge
and ilignuiisd.

Beyond the principal pylon Was the'1reratPsriatrla Court (H, A),
Which was antimly surrounded by a double row of columns (twelve
pairs on th of the four sides). It measures 185 n. in length and
167 tc in breadth. This hall was at one time completely built up, but
the W. hide at leasthas now been hirihare. The most recent excava-
tions have revealed a Portico, dating from Ramses IL, on the inner
side of the ti.W. wall of the court The archileatonic purport of
this portico, which is somewhat Iowa: than the court and has three
dustered columns, is not apparent. Between the inner row of ca"
lumus on the S. sida of the court arrows and shields of Ramses II.
were, placed. A mosque situated within this court prevents the ex-
cavaclon of the E, wall, and considerably mm the general ereet.
Ramses II. founded the court, but the Ethiopian Sabnko wrote his
name on the portal, while Ptolemy Philopstor wrote his on several
of the ahaci. On the 5. side this wart was terminated by a smaller
Pylon, beyond which, though not with the same axis (ace above),
is a Colonnada (Pl. B), 58 yds. long, built under the 18th Dynasty.
The Inst is "tolerably gooit preservation and contributes esssentiaiiy
to the dilp0ed appearance of the ruins ofLuxoz when viewed from
the riverbank or still more from the island crossed on the way to
visit the monuments of W. Thebes. Seven cnnples of column,
nearly 42 ft. in height, with calyx-ctpittls, still support a heavy
architrave above a lofty abacus. The whole was built by Aman-
botep m., but King Horus, Seti I., and Seti II. have 3150 recorded
their names "pun it. The marvellous play of colour shown by this
colonuade with its deep, heavy shadows when the setting sun sheds
a rosy light upon the E. sky, is nowhere excelled. The Second
Perintyla Court (Pl. 0) had double rows of columns on m N, E.,
and W. sides. These, belonging to the order of sculptured papymv
bud columns, are specially effective as seen from the river-batik.
The court wa8 48 Pia. long and 66 yds. broad, and ends in a Hypo-
style Hall (Pl. D), the roof of which was borne by 32 smrlptured
trait-eo1usnus ananged in d rows of 8, The two sphiuxes at the env
trance bear the name at Sebekhotep 11. (13th Dym). This hall was
barely 20 yds, deep and 35 yds. wide, and for some unexplained
reason Its E. le1 forms an acute: angle (instead of a right angle ]
with the B. wall of the preeeding perinyle mutt. The Open Spare
(Pi. IO, whlnh we next tInd, is entered from the river side, ind is
specially commended to the traveI1sr's attention. The wciaut WV.
trance to tha "actaaieUtubars has here been altered into a kind
of apsMal recess, bounded on the right anti left by two granite lhe
rinthian columns. The court in mm of this was used "I church
