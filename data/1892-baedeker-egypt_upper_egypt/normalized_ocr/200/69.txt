of them unerstsslsed, and the colouring oi the reliefs is sometimes in
wonderful preservation, The mummy shafts, in spite of their great
depth, have all long since been despailed of their contents. la the
very tlrst tomb we tind a representation of the king and his family
offering a saeriliee to the sun's disc. The disc is encircled with
the Uraas-suirks and furnished with several arms, stretching down-
wards; the hanits are symbolic of energy, lihemlity, and the creative
faculty. Dwarfs (then, as later, a favourite royal plaything), fan-
bearers, and bowing uourtiexs stand below. In front is the provost-
martial with his baton. To the left of the tirst grave' on the hill,
is the Tomb of Penta (No. 2), which is in a very ruinous con-
dition. Farther on to the left is that of RameriCNo, 3), with a t1neig
worked exterior. On the 1eftwaliofthe Bccond chamber of this tomb
is a military scene, which we do not hesitate to describe u the
most reahstic reyreseutation found hitherto in any Egyptian grave.
The lean figure of the Pharaoh, above whom the sun spreads its
arms, stands in his war-chariot and driven the tiery steeds, the, intro-
duction of which Egypt owes to the Hyksos. Sills (outnmnners)
with long FtNTes run in front of the chariot, towards the crowd or
people offering iuyeriiiee and bending to the ground in adoration.
Standardehearers and soldiers clear the way for the rapidly advan-
cing proeession, jast "the mounted kavasses etill do for the carriage
of the Khedive. The king appears once more followeti by his
children, who also drive their mm ohmiots. The procession hastens to-
wnnis the royal palace, which covers the right part of the rear-wall
of the chapel and also part of the right well, aifording us a clearez
idea of RT! Egyptian palace than any other scene of the kind. It
has long been established that neither the royal princes nor even
the Pharaohs themselves lived in the temples. On the contrary
they used to build themselves siry chéteaux of light materials, with
doors owning an shady galleries and colonmdes. Garéens with
fountains and water-basins surrounded the 1suiliiing, meat which
Were also out-houaea, stables, and well-stocked storehouses, in
quantity corresponding to the huge number of the dependents
of the royal family. The great enusrure, -dosyr is dignilied with
double mwa of bud columns, and red standards wave from lofty
fug-stses. Above one of the eidedoors is a round window similarto
those which the French call auTitrreuf, The yalace ia eajeined
by s sepulehral chapel, supported by columns and containing figures
of the king's ancestors, honoured by rich siurr'1irrrial offerings; at the
door is a choir, singing pious sangs of remembrance to the & t30tjme
paniment of the help, and taking ite time from the hand-euppiag
o? the header (a custom still preserved in Egypt). _ In the JIrgt
chamber of Tomb 7 (1ight WAR, y, 26) is a representation of the
Temple of the Sela: Disc, with a large yexistyle court surrounded
by a eolonnade. Pillars resembling C & rystides decorate the walls,
and above ali tower the lefty pyloms with their hollow mgnice.
