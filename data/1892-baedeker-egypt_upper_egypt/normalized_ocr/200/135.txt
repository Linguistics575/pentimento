The representations on the walls am! columns, many or which
wen deserve special attention, exhibit here also the Egyptian ruler
worshipping Kathe: or some other of the divinities revered in her
temple. They illustrate eeverul most remarkable ceremonies, which
the king performed awarding to the prescribed ritual in pregame of
the images (rf the gods in the temple. We have seen reason to be-
lieve that the Sculptural decntatians of MI the temp1e-ehscoers

beginning of the Roman empire. (The irm1lptares in some of the

The WIRE of the tempm at Danderah exhibit exelnsivelyEarly Egyp-
tian Manners and Customs. What we here learn are the ceremonies

ward he goes through the motion of eleaving the earth with the
ahart hand-plough in his hand, because it was an immemorial
custom that the Egyptian king should turn the Brat sod on the nits
"a temple. [ In the explanatory inscription here, as elsewhere,
this ceremony is named'hai ta', cleaving of the ground.) The king
also smote the iirst blow with the hammer at the laying of the foun-
dattim-stirms, sad shaped the am brick for the enclosing walls,
which were usually built of unburnea hncks of Nila-mnd dried in
the mm. All these ceremoniee performed by early Egyptian monarchs
at the foundation of s temple, am here faithfully rsaoxdad nocording
to early models, both in visible shape and by axplamtory in-
ecriptinna. They axe also reautded in the lowest of the mar row:
on the W. and B. exterior walls of the temple. In the temer of
