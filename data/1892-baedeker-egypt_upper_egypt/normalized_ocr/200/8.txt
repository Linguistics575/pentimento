PREFACE.

The present volume forms the second part of the Edi-
tor's Handbaok for Egypt, the first part of which has reached
a second edition in 1885.

The materials upon which this Handbook to Upper Egypt
is ehiefly founded were contributed principally by 2hw.fesstT
Georg Eben? of Leipsio, and Pro 9850? Johanms Diimiehen of
Strassburg, and their work, w ich was main } Euighed in
1877, has been revised, augmented, and J2'/lr'd up to date
in MI practical details by Professor August Ezlmzlohr of
Heidelber, who has twice visited E ypt for this express
pu use. 0 Prof. Ebers the editor is M2U' for the account
of t m Nilewnzage as far as and including PMlar, Prof. Dir,
michen contri uted the descriptions of the templas of Den-
derah and Edfu, of the town of Koneh, and of the caravan-
routes thence vii the quarries of'umimiit to Forir 0n the
Red Sea; while the routes in Lower Nubia and to the Western
Oases are wholly from the pen of Prof, Eisenlohr.

The practival introductiun to the first volume, and the
sections on the geography, history, and art oi Egypt, there
pisNished, apply of course also to the districts of Upper
Egy t. The spatial introductiun to the present volume, deals
chie y with the Nile voyage and the necessary preparations
for it, preceded by a brief survey of the chief isteau-mtes
between Egypt and Earopo and a note on the new E tiau
monetary system, introduced since the publication 0 the
1% u1book to Lower Egypt, A list of works on Egypt is
added, ami, to obviate the necessity of too frequent re-
ferences to the first volume, also a chronological hst of the
rulera of Egypt down to the close of the Ptolemuic period,
and a selection from the royal aartouehes of most fre uent
occurrence in Upper Egypt. Finally the Arabic Alp abet
is given, showing the system of transliteration adopted in
this Handbook.

The MAPS and PLANS have been an objeet of especial
cBre, The former are based upon the large maps of KÃ©epert,
Losius, and Zinant; the latter cxh) edy upon the plums of
Lepsius, though with the necessary additions and eorreetioms,
while some have been specially prepared by Prof Eisenlohr.
