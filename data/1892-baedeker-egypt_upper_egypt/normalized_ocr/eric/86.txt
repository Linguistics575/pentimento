' was probably situated near the modern si--Lohdn (see below), the name of
which is supposed to be derived from the old Egyptian'Ro--han" or'Lc-
haa', its.'the mouth of the lake', and the site of which was probably
once occupiedby' the town of Ptolemei's.

There is a did'erence of opinion as to the Situation and Form of the
Ancient Lots.. Linant-Bey, arguing from the considerable did'erence of
level between the two lakes, maintains that the Birket oldies-fin (Lake
of the Home, p. 43) could never have formed part of Lake hireris, as was
formerly supposed, and he assigns to the latter a much smaller area than
was attributed to it under the earlier theory. Placing it farther to the
S.E., nearer to the Labyrinth and eleLahfin, he makes its boundary-line
run towards the 8.8.W. of Mediuet el--Fayfim to the Birket shadowy, and
intersect the desert of sacks Ahmed, where the ancient height of the wa-
ter, which far exceeds the level attained in modern times, has left its
traces; it then leads to Kolamsho, turns to the N. to Dér, and then to
the E. and SE. to Dimisfipioeh, follows the embankment of Httawdnsh,
and passes Handset cl--Ecbt'r and the bridge etch-Leland (see below). Hence the
boundary leads by Dimmo towards the NE. to hatch, and thence to the W.
to Bikamn (p. 38):, then again to the 3., and thus returns to Medinet el-
Feydm. « mu-A somewhat fatiguing journey of 2-3 days will enable the trava-
eller to complete this circuit of the bed of the lake, which is now dried
up. Recently, however, hlr. F.Cope Whitehonse, relying upon the great
circumference assigned by Herodotus (II, 149) to the lake, of 3600 stadia
(reduced by Linant to 360) or about 385 hi. (Pliny says 230 31.), and upon
measurements made by himself on the spot, ascribes a considerably larger
ares. to the lake than Linant, and maintains that it extended on the S.W.
to the det Haydn. It is not improbable that in ancient times nearly the
whole of the Faydrn could be laid under water, so that even the Birket
ehhnrdn belonged to Lake liceris, but that the entire system was meant
for the watering. of the Faydrn alone and not of the Nile valley or the
Delta. Considering that the bed of the lake must annually have been raised
by the deposit of Nile mud, it follows, that as soon as the raising of the
embankments and the removal of the mud were discontinued, the lake
must have become onseryieeable, especially after the lock-gates at cl"
Lahdn fell to decay, each opening of which, as Diodorns informs us,
cost 50 talents (is. about 1135033). The discharge of the superfluous
water probably run through the Bohr Bold bid, which has already been
mentioned (p. 38), or through the dei Neel-ch (p. 42), both of which
fall into the Birket elfihnriin. The ancient conjecture, that the latter
discharged part of its water into the Solidi-a (or, as Herodotus says, the
'Libyan Syria"), was not an. unnatural one.

A visit to the Pyramid of sin-Laban or mobile. is only interesting to
those who are desirous of convincing themselves of the truth of Linant's
hypothesis, and to make the circuit of the boundaries of the old bed of
the lake (see above). The pyramid, which is built of Nile bricks, may be
reached from Hawdret el--Easab in 4-5, or from the Labyrinth in 3-4. hours.
it has been recently been opened by Fraser, The discovery of an ala-
baster altar with the name of Usertescu 11. renders it probable that the
pyramid was built by that monarch. A smaller pyramid lies to the NE.

he remains of the ancient embankments, which were tolerably well
preserved in the time of the Khalifs, are not without attraction. Those
who are interested in hydraulic engineering should also inspect the en-
trance of the Bohr Ydsuf into the Fayfim.

About 1/2 hi. to the E. of the pyramid of el~Lahdn, Mr. Flinders Pe-
trie discovered a temple in 1889, and close beside it the ruins of the town
Ha-Uscrtesea-hotep, now called Kellen. The latter was founded by User-
team 11. (12th Bye.) for the labourers on his pyramid. Among the articles
found here were pottery, flint and copper implements of the 12th Dyn.,
numerous papyri of the some period, a statuettc of SbSebek (13th Dyed,
a wooden stamp of Apepi and a large wooden door of Qsorkon 1.

Guest, ills M. to the .S.W. of Illahdn and close to the edge of the
desert, owed its origin to Tutmes 111., who built a temple there. Many
of the inhabitants were foreigners. Mr. Petrie discovered her futg
