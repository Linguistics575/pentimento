selected from their number. A visit to the conveuts, however, does not
compensate for the fatigue and trouble it involves.

As far as Minyeh the space between the E. bank and the hills
remains narrow, the limestone reeks frequently abutting on the river
in unbroken walls or rounded binds. Few villages are seen on this
bank, but the fertile alluvial tract on the W. side, 10-12 M. in width,
is thickly populated and carefully cultivated, exhibiting in profusion
all the cereals that grow on the Nile, datenpalms, and sugar-scene.
The huge sugar plantations present a busy scene in November, when
the sweet juice is collected from the canes and conveyed to the
factories, which are a monopoly of the Khedive and follow each other
in rapid succession. These factories are connected by the railway,
and short branchwlines, used in harvest--time only, run from them
to the plantations lying farther to the W. Their lofty chimneys
impart a very modern-industrial appearance to the ancient land of
the Pharaohs. Large barges full of sugarmcancs and others with
fellahiu going to work in the factories are met on the river. Most
of the higher officials in the factories are Europeans. The juice is
expressed from the cane and then refined by being boiled twice in
closed. vessels. In an average year about 25,000 tons of sugar are
produced in Egypt; in 1889 the value of the sugar esported
amounted to 509,000l...

of el--Eibch, on the E. bank, about 4 M. farther up, are the ruins of
the town of Kheh or Kathi, which belonged to the some of Aphro-
dite (p. 5). These include well-preserved riparian structures of the
time of the Pharaohs and some massive walls made of bricks,
hearing two difl'erent stamps. One of these bears the name of the
local goddess,'lsis of Kheb', and the prmuomcn of Tutmes 1H. (18th

farther on "both banks are flat. At Abe Girgch (rail. stat, p.),
with sugarmfactories, the railway runs close to the river.
