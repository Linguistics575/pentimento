Visitors to the Faydm may regain el-Wastsh on the following day at
10.15 am. or at 4.16 pm... by leaving hiedinet elvFaydm at 9 can. or
2.53 pm. An extra day allows a visit to the Labyrinth and the Pyramid
of sthrah (p. 39). In this case the dhahabiyeh should not be sent on in ad »
sauce, but should be ordered to await the traveller's return .--The pyra-
mid. and. tombs of Maidens may also he visited from el-Wastah (see p. 2).

A small canal, beginning near the village of Zdwiyeh (W. bank),
runs out of the Nile into the Bohr Ydsuf (t.'28 }.

Further up in the latitude of Ahnds el-Mcdineh and. Benisudf, there
seems to have been another deep channel connecting the river with the
Bohr Ydsuf. These four channels enclosed an inland which has been iden-
nets with the Heroslcopcliton Nome, unanimously described by Greek an"
thorities as an island. Strabo, who "visited it on his way to the Faydm,
after leaving the name of Aphroditopolis, calls it'a large island", and re » -
lates that in the city of Heracleopolis the ichneumon was worshipped,
the deadliest fee of the crocodile, held sacred in the neighbouring some
of Arslnoe; for, he tells us it crawls down the throat of the sleeping
monster and devours its animals. The large mounds of debris at Agenda s1-
.Hedi'aeh, the Umm el--Ktmdm ('mother of rubbish~heaps') of the Arabs, have
been identified. with Heracleopolis; they lie 11 hi. to the W. (inland) of
Beniguef. The old name of the town was Khinensn, from which Abode is
derived. through the Coptic Bars. The ram~horned god Harshaf. the
prince of terrors, was also worshipped here. A few columns still stand,
here, and other monuments may be buried under the debris. Systematic
excavations are to he undertaken. At present Abode need scarcely be
visited except by those who approach the Faydm from Bcuisudf.

0n the W. bank the mountains recede a little from the Nile,
but on the E. bank. their steep and. lofty spurs frequently extend
down to the bank in rising picturesque forms. None of the Nile--
villages before Benisuéf need be mentioned. 0n the E. bank stands
the Septic content of Mdr Antonina (see p. 4). About 2M. inland
(right) from Zé'tdn (W. bank) lies the hamlet of Bitch (rail. stat,
p. l), which is inhabited by Gupta and thus has some interest for
those who wish to study these direct descendants of the ancient
Egyptians in a community of some sire.

Beniguef, on the W. bank, the first place in Upper Egypt (rail.
etch, p. l; stain, 3/; M. from the Nile), is a town of 10,000 inhab.,
pleasantly situated between the railway and the river. It contains
a post and telegraph office and is the capital of a province of the
same name, which contains 169 villages and about 220,000 inhabim
tents. To the left of the rail. station is the Mudiriyeh, or residence
of the mudir or governor. The houses or rather huts of this preview
cial capital are, however, constructed merely of Nile mud. The linen: -
manufacture for which this place was celebrated in the middle ages
has greatly declined, but there are several sugar-plantations and. a
small bazaar. To the left of the railway is a fine grove of palms.

A. road which was much frequented before the completion of the rail-
way, leads from Benisuéf into the Faydm (p. 3t), and. travellers with a
tent and plenty of time might still hire camels, asses, or horses here and
proceed to Medias: el-Fayam rid sZ--Lohdu ('gate of the Faydm"), where the
Bohr Ydsul' enters the Faydm, and Handrail. By using the railway for the
pgtgrpnggpgney and. giving up Birket el-lfiurdn, this excursion can be made

Another road, traversing the dei Based, which opens near the vil-
lage of Based, on the E. bank of the Nile, opposite Benisngtgl _
