This steamer touches at Benihasan (visit to the tombs), reaches
Assist on Tues. evening, and proceeds thence on Wed. morning (as
above). The fare from Cairo is 235. to decode and back (id- days,
or 18 days if the direct steamer from Cairo be taken) and 2m. to
Luxor and back (11 days), including 1st cl. fare from. Cairo to
Assidt, transfer of Mgage at Assidt, provisions on board the
steamers, and 3-4 days' hotel accommodation at Lunar. Incidental
expenses for sight-seeing, donkeys, guides, etc. are not included in
these fares. About 1% day is spent at Assets, and. on the return"
voyage 3 hrs. are spent at Edi'u and 23/4 hrs. at Kenethenderah.
