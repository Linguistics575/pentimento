NILE JOURNEY. nix

b. The Dhahabiyeh Voyage.

Though the voyage in a Bhahebiyeh demands much more time
and money than the steamboatnvoyage, on the other hand it odors
the only means of a satisfactorily close examination of the country
and its monuments. A party of 4M5 persons will be found advisable,
especially as the espouse is not much more than for 1-2 persons.

A large selection of good dhahabiyohs is to be found at Cairo,
on the left bank of the Nile both above and below the new bridge
at Bdldh. Travellers who take the train from Cairo to Assifit should
despatch their boat from Cairo about a fortnight in advance, for
there are no good dhahabiyehs either at Assifit or farther up at
Loner and domain. In Cairo the best dhahabiyehs are those belongs-
ing to Messrs. Cook & Son was,'Osiris','Horos','Hathor','Nephm
this', and'AmmonuRo', costing 130 $. per month) or Messrs. Gare &
Son ('Scrostris','Chcops",'Hcrodotns', and'Hopc', iiOi. per month).
Other good craft, with the monthly hire, are as follows:'Diumond'
(1005.),'Eect' (803.),'Admiral' (85L),'Timsah' (905.),'Lcadon',
'Lrtxor','Philts' (each 75!),'Indic' (85L),'Alma','Nuoia','Zen
nobie','Gemila' (each 901.),'Lotus' (70l.),'Mccrmin','Manhatten'
(each 755.),'Griffia' (805.),'Zz'ngam' (655.), and'Vittoria' (555.).

These prices include the hire of the dhahabiyoh and its full
equipment and the wages of the re'is or aspirin and the crew. For
the services of a. dragoman, cook, and attendant, and for provisions,
saddles, and all the incidental expenses of excursions (excluding
bahshish), the price per day and per pore. is calculated thus:......

Cook Gaze Dragoman
Party of 2, each para. 338. 353. 30s.
- - 3 =- - 283.'27s. 24s.
-----4 - ~ 243. 253. 20.9.
--- 5 - - 2'23. 203. 18s.
- - 6 or more, 203. 163. 163.

Thus for a voyage of 60 days from Cairo to decode. and back,
including the payment of a dragoman and all provisions (except
wine, eta), Cook charges 500i. for a party M5016. 1181. each para,
or 39s. 4d. each per day). For smaller parties, the cost per head is
considerably more. A. three months' voyage in the'Manhattan' gills
property of a dragoman) costs 4851. for a party of 4 (Le. 6t. 03.
per day, or 32s. 6d. each pore. per day). The inclusive charge for
Cook's excellent steamwdhahabiyeh'Nttocris' (5 berths) is 4005. per
month, a sum that will not appear exorbitant when the time saved
by steaming is taken into account.

Those who employ Cook's or Gaze's dhahabiyehe are relieved from.
all trouble in the matter of engaging a dragoman (quite indispensable to
the traveller who speaks no Arabic) or purchasing provisions. And there
are the additional advantages that the stores of meat, fowls, vegetables,
and fruit can be replenished en route from the steamers, and that, in case
of head~winds, the small Steam Towing Washes belonging to these, flrma
may be hired for 6'8" per day.
