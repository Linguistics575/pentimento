is understood a fertile and inhabited spot in the midst of the desert. The
oases owe their fertility to the springs which rise in them, frequently
thermal and containing iron, sulphur, or other mineral ingredients. The
most abundant trees in the oases are the date--palm, acacias of various
kinds (Acacia Nilotica or sentences), apricots, and other fruit~trees; the
chief grain--crops are wheat, barley, and rice, with a little dura (Sorghum
ralgore) and dukhn (Penisiltarto spindle); and. indigo, tobacco, and cotton
are also grown (see Vol. 1., pp. 63 seq.).

Seven oases are mentioned in the Ptolemaic inscriptions in the temple

at Edfu. According to deichen the first of these, mam Kcssm, corre-

into anthers and Southern (loses, the first signifying probably Bohrtyeh,
the latter Khdrged and Ddthel. The two last were also united under the
name Great Oasis (ducts nerdlnE, distinguished at the same time as the

Outer (21;?) Q5 5:." Elnwdh el-kharigeh) and the Inner Oasis

("935.0 5 }" Eluwal } ed--dakhileh). The oasis of Bahriye'h, the North-

em Oasis was also called the Small Oasis (duets escort), and frequently
also Ell-welt eI--« bshnssoit, because the route to it diverged at Behnssah on the
Nile. Most travellers who wish to see an oasis will be satisfied with a
visit to Khdrgeh and perhaps also to Ditkhel, for the visit to Siwah in-
volves a long and fatiguing .iOurney. The latter, however, is also de «
scribed below on account of its great historical interest.

For a visit to the 03383 a caravan of riding and sumpterscamels is
necessary. Riding Camels or drornedaries travel about 28 M. in 12 hrs,
or considerably more if pressed (comp. p. 75):, ordinary camels only about
19 miles. The camels should be divided into convenient groups, and the
traveller should make sure that he has a comfortable saddle for his ride
of eight days or more. A tent, a generous supply of tinned provisions,
and water must also he provided. Water may be carried either in cache
(hermit), leather skins (which, however, impart a disagreeable flavour to
their contents after a day or two), or still better in iron coffers lined
with enamel (refills). The services of a trustworthy caravan--leader should
be secured by application to a consular agent or other reliable authority;
and guns, powder and shot, and a supply of money in small coins and
Maria Theresa thalers should be provided. The traveller should avoid
displaying large sums ot money before the Arabs, and he should be strict
in maintaining the discipline of the caravan.
