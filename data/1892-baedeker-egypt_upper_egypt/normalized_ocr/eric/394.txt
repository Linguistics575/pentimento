two lowest representations, which are double scenes showing the
king with lotus and papyrus-plants, the queen with bouquets of

of the fields, who carries sacrificial cakes and ferric of various kinds
and is accompanied by a small bull. On the partition-wall, new

touche, like that of a queen;'may she protect King Euergetos'. On
the front of the two columns are not only the names of the founders
of the presses, but also those of their ancestors, the divine Adolphi,
Eucrgetm', Philopatores, Epiphanes, and the divine Philometor;
while one of them is dedicated to the memory of Thoth of Pe-
