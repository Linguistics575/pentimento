234 Route 2?. ESNEH. From Thebes

this fish, which appears not only on the coins, but is also repre-
sented with the disc between the home, was used as a symbolise!
representation of KhnumnRa, especially as we actually fin



united with the fish on the roan-wall of the temple 1;

The Srnn Warns are entirely covered with paintings and iii--
scriptiens. The former shew the king making ofi'eringe to various
divinities of the temple, who promise him in return the good things
of life. At the foot oi" the wall to the right of the entrance is the
emperor Commodus with Arudris and Khnum capturing with a net
the various products of the Nile (birds, fishes, plants, etc). On the
other side of the not is Safelrh. This symbolioal representation poo-
sibly refers to the legend according to which Horus fighting against
SethmTyphon fell dead into the water and was drawn out of it
again living ,--- a legend, which is connected with the course of
the moon. A main door and two side portals are seen in the rear-s
wall of the temple. The latter probably gave admittance to a corri-
dor surrounding the Sanctuary, which was entered by the central
portal. Recent excavations in this direction have hitherto remained
without result.

On the pieces of wall between the pillars on the Front are ser-
eral highly important inscriptions, of which by far the most
valuable is the celebrated Colander of Festioats on the wall-pillars
to the right and left. A specimen of the eccentricitios and freaks
indulged in by the hierogrammatists under the Romans, may be
seen in the crowd of crocodiles on the pillar at the extreme left of
the E. or entrance wall.

The'24 Columns of the parties are specially noteworthy on ac-
count of the shapes of their capitals, some of which are over-laden
with ornament. Of the columns, 18 stand detached, while 6, to-
wards the front, are built into the outer wall. All the columns have
fiat plinths, and shafts most elaborately adorned with inscriptions.
The Capitals are of various shapes and of unequal height, but this
irregularity does not offend the eye owing to the fact that the annuli
of all the columns are arranged so as to lie in the some horizontal
plane. Most of them. belong to the calyx order, and are not adorned
merely with painting as at Kamah or the Ramesseum, but with
richly carved ornaments from the vegetable kingdom.
