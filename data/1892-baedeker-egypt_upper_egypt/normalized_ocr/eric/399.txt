contained six large and six small pillars, the former being meant

joinod by two sidewchambers and three other chambers in the
back-wall. In this room appears Ramses II. worshipping and pm
seating ofi'erings to various deities. Under a canopy are four gods.

between them, This Ptah is described as'iefty with the two

feathers and the horns'. Next is a female figure with the moon-disc
(perhaps Rat-tail), and finally comes Esther, goddess of the southern
Nehet (sycamore tree), with home turned upwards enclosing two
feathers and the sunudiso. The colouring of the sacrificial scenes in
the side-chambers is well--preserved; and this is still more the case
in the adytum, the central of the three chambers at the back. Both
to the right and left in this room the king is represented sacrificing
before a richly adorned dhahabiyeh. The dhahabiyeh on the right has
thehawk's head ofHarmachis as its emblem, that on the left the terms
head of Rheum-vita. Both. stand on ornamented tables. "0n the left
the king is ofiering incense above an altar, on the right he is odor-

dards with the heads of the two gods and of the king.... The con-
tral picture exhibits Khuum--Ra seated in a boat beneath a canopy,
with the kneeling king to the left and three cynocephali to the
right. Beneath is a recess, in which the outlines of three gods may

large key, has been painted over them. The king, who appears on
the right and left, with flowers, has new the appearance of ofiering
them to the saint. Beneath is an inscription, running both to the
right and to the left and extending on to the side walls:'The living
Hora-Ra, the strong, the beloved of Ms, lord of the festivals, like his
father Ptsh, king of both lands, Ramses the Great, he has made it
in memory of his father Amman-dis, king of the gods'.





Beyond Sebfi'ah the scenery assumes a regularly desert character,
which it retains until near Kerusko. Rocky isolated peaks rise on
the left. At Mallet the Nile makes a sudden bend, and beyond this
point the banks are once more cultivated, while dense paints-groves
appear on the left (id), with scattered huts and many edhiyehe.
