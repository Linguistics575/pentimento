28 Route 1. Doom ssnusnnam. From 0am

Beyond Hagg elml'iandil the Nile-voyager passes several small
villages, but neither they nor the scanty ruins of the Pharaonic
epoch near them deserve a visit.

In a ravine near st-Hewdtoh (E bank) stands a stale with a
hieroglyphic inscription, discovered by the late Mr. Harris, British
consul at Cairo and excellently versed. in Egyptian antiquities.
Farther on we shirt an island and reach the point on the W. bank,
between the villages of ct-Gcsireh (tic. fished") and cl-Mnndurah,
where the Bohr Yusuf or Joseph's Count, an arm of the Nile, dia-
yerges from the main stream to water the agricultural districts of
the Libyan bank, the Fayfim (p. 35) etc. The name of Joseph, was
given to it by the Arabs, who recognise in the son of Jacob the type
of all administrators. it probably owes its regulation if not its origin
to Amenemha 111., of the 12th Dynasty. Extensive works are new
in progress to furnish the W. part of the Libyan bank with water
from a point higher up the Nile, near Assidt.

About 5 M. below the divergence of the Bohr Ydsnf, at some
distance from the Nile, lies Dem ash-Shorif (rail. stat, p. l).
About ill/4 M. above (S. of) the fork, on the E. bank, are some
brick ruins, and 11/4 M. farther to the S. are the mounds of Dds
ringleader, probably the site of the ancient Peseta. This is the N.
boundary of the ddmwpalms, which, however, do not attain their
full develOpment till farther up, between Assidt and Keneh, where
we see many fine specimens (p. 70). The Arabian Mts., rising in
precipitous rocky walls, approach the river. Swallows, ducks, and
other birds inhabit the caves in the porous rock on the banks, and
fly in and out in screaming crowds. The clifi's on the right bank of
this part of the Nile are known as Gsbo'l Aha Ftdah. The stream
below them is considered the most dangerous part of the channel
between Cairo and. Assudn. Violent winds blow round the crags,

and numerous sandbanks impede navigation.

The Arabs tell that a shipsmaster of Neath, haying safely arrived at
Bdldlc, was asked by his friends how he had passed the Gabe ]. Abe Edda.
'Quite easily", was his rejoinder,'there's no danger there". An old man
who overheard him remarked:'From your own words I see that you
do not know this mountain'.'I know it as well as my own eyos', said
the boatman.'Whea I return to Keneh I must pass it once more. If my
vessel sud'ers any damage in doing so, I will pay you 10,000 piastres, on
condition that you pay me the like sum it I ass safely. But I pitta you
due warning that I know the Gabe ]. Ahu Fdda perfectly well'. he old
man accepted the wager. and the shipemaster had his boat bound with
iron, engaged the best sailors, and. set forth. As he approached the (label
the boat was assailed at first by one wind, and afterwards by four storm-
winds, each blowing from a did'erent quarter. The ship, in spite of its
iron fastenings, was cast upon the rocks and went to pieces" and the
vainglorious re'is as he scrambled ashore with nothing saved but his
life. cried:'Gebel Abe Fédah, I never knew you till now". Numerous
similar stories are related of these clifi's. And no wonder, for nothing
can be more mysterious and spectral than their appearance at twilight,
when the dark swarms of birds fly towards the rocks and disappear as
suddenly as if engulfed by it.

The bill contains many rock~tombs, which harez; npotx_, ye§lijge.n
