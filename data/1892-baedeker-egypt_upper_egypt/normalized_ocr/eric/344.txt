station also there is a block of granite with. the name ofTutmes 11L,
possibly dating from a temple at Syene, on which Khnum, lord of Kebu

, within Aha (Elephantine) is named. Several



attractive houses, one belonging to a wealthy Jew, form a kind of
suburb here

To the left of the road lies the small Tenses, founded by Pto-
lemy HI. Energetes and adorned by Ptolemy IV. Philopator, but
never entirely completed. 011 the left of the Facade is Eusrgetes I.
and his wife Berenice IL, before Isis in Sun (Syene). Isis is named
eonductress of the soldiers, because the frontierutown and its neigh-
bourhood were strongly garrisoned from very early times as well as
under the Romans. (Under the Romans the Cohors Quinta Suenen-
slum was stationed at Contra Syme, the Cohors Santa Saginarum in
the Castro Lapidariomm, on the E. bank to the S. of Syene, the
Cohors Prime. Felix Theodosiana on Elephantine, and the Legio
Prime Maximiana on Phitm.) Next appears Ptulmis, son of Error--
gates, otherwise Philopator, before Khnum, Sati, and. Anuke, who
each wears his special headudress. On the right side of the faeade is
Energetes 1., before Sebek and Esther, and ofi'ering incense before
Osiris Unnofer (the good), Isis, and the child. Horus.

0n the inner sides of the two doors leading to the anteohamber
with its two square columns, and on the inner side of the door to
the adytum, are inscribed stirring Hymns to Isis--Sothis, to whom
apparently the little temple was dedicated. To the left, on the lat-
ter deer, are my. the words:'Thou hurlest forth. (sati) the Nile,
that he may fertilize the land. in thy name of Sothis, thou em-
bracest (ank) the fields to make them fertile in thy name of Ankht.
All beings on earth exist through thee, through thy name of Ankht
('the living'.)

Unusually thick pillars in the first and. largest chamber of the
temple support fiat Greek abaci, upon which rests a broad but flat
arehitrare. Completed inscriptions are to be found only on the
partition-wall between the sanctuary and the preceding hall, on the

entrance door, and at a few points on the inner walls.

Near the temple is a rock-lnseription of the time of Khn-en-aten. To
the left appears the sculptor Men, before a sitting figure of Amcnhotep III.
perhaps carved by himself, to the right is a son of Men named. Bert, mak-
ing an offering. Belt is also a master-sculptor of the sun, whose beams
radiate in the form of hands. The cartouches of Khu-en-aten are defaced.

A brief ride brings us to an immense number of Arab graves,
lying in the midst of the desert, each marked. by a rectangle of
unhewn stones, and a slab bearing an engraved. inscription. Many
are covered with a poll of yellow sand. The earliest of the hundreds
of Epitaphs exhibit the venerable Cufic character and date mostly
from the 9th and 10th cent AND A few are older and manggggare
