348 Route 35. FARKFRAH. The Whom

the E. of Willi Nata-tin (comp. the Map at the beginning of Vol. I.) are
four Septic monasteries, a visit to which is interesting. The monasteries
owe their origin to Motorists of Alexandria (d. 394), a hermit who first
retired to the Thcban desert in 335, and afterwards, about 373, took up
his abode in a lonely cell in this spot. He was the founder of an order
that won numerous disciples. The monks fest all the year round, except
on Sundays and between Easter and Whitsuntidc. Reflect mentions fifty
monasteries of ascetics, who numbered com in all. In the year 800 the
ruined monastery of St. Moonrise was repaired and fortified by Sonatina,
patriarch of Alexandria. The next most interesting monastery is that of
smear, built by a saint named. Bonner or Johannes the dwarf. It has
30-40 monks and 8 churches. Carson and afterwards Tattoos and Pasha,
who visited the monastery twice, here found most valuable collections
of Syrian MSS., acquired between 18M) and 1 & 0. These MES, in 317i.
vole, of which the oldest are one by Erection of Edessa (iii AD.) and
twelve of the 6th cent., included the Theophany and other writings of
Eusebius of Caesarea, the Recogniticncs of Clemens, a treatise against the
Manichwsns by Tides of Basra, etc. This monastery contains also an
Abyssinian college with a library.~---Therc is little chance of discovering
any more valuable BESS. here, as all except those required for the religious
seréices have been transferred to the library of the Coptic patriarch
at airo.

A visit to the remaining monasteries, of Bummer (Coptic liturgical
nos.) and Arabs Bisthai, with three small churches, scarcely re aye the
trouble, and is not recommended on account of the vermin...... ntercstu
ing accounts of these and other monasteries in the Levant are con-
taincd in R. Carson's Visits to the Monasteries in the Levant (London,
1849), and in Quatrcmtrs's Mdmoires Géographiqucs, Vol. I. pp. 451 seq.
(Paris, 1811).

H. The Cases of Bahriysh and Farafmh.

The visit to the oasis of Bahrlyeh (the Northern Oasis), called by
Strobe holiness,'ths Second", and by Ptolemy dectc'ntspi,'thc Small Oasis",
is of interest only to the naturalist, for its antiquities are few and no »
important. The latter include a small Roman triumphal arch (Caillieud,
March, 11. P1. 39, 40, 42) and a stale of the reign of Tutmes 111., besides
the scanty remains of a temple at Bawtti (Aschcrson).



The oasis of Partisan, probably the To star or

Cots-Inna of antiquity (temple of Edful, as the latter is described as to the
NW) of Kareem, the great oasis, is of importance merely as an inter-
mediate station between the oases of Siwah and Dtkhel, or the cases of
Bahriyeh and Dikhcl. It contains no antiquities, but some catacombs
in a clili' to the W. suggest that there was at one time a Christian
settlement here. The oasis which has only 3'20 inhah., has been since
1860 entirely in the hands of the Sendai, a rigid Mohammedan sect, founded
by Mohammad Sendai of Algiers (Vol. 1., p. 67). The people are suspicious
of and hostile to strangers. The chief village is Sorabdb, two days" journey
to the W. of Siwah.

less difficult than that to the oasis of Jo itcr Ammon, and it may be
combined with a visit to dehel. El-Khargeh may be reached in M
