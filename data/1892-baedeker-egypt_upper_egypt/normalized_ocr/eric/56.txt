steamer remains overnight and leaves the entire foreseen for a visit to
Specs Artemidos and Benihasan. The excursion begins at Specs Artemi-
dos, which lies to the 8. (1/2 hr. on donkeydrack). whence we proceed
towards the N. to (1/2 hr.) the foot of the tombs of Benihasan. We then
walk to (10 min.) the S. graves and descend to Nos. 2 (Khnum-hotep) and
i (hme'ni-Amenemha) of the N. tombs, where the noses are in waiting to
take us back to the steamer We be). Travellers ascending the river in
a dhahabiyeh should land at Benihasan, ride to Specs Artemidos, and send
the dhahabiyeh on to meet them near the village of Sentences cinemas.
Those descending the stream save a little time by landing at a point
somewhat nearer the tombs of Benihasan, almost opposite Benihassn eh
Kadim (p. 12).

crosses fields and. sand, finally ascending considerably. On the
way carefully rolled (zeta-mummies are shared for sale, which
have retained the unmistakeable odour of cats for thousands of




years. The cat was sacred to the goddess Pasht E', whom

the Greeks identified with Artemis. The Templesof this goddess,
