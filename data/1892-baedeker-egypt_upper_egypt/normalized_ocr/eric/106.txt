building operations to construct the sanctuary of his father in the
neeropolis and to how out his statue. Sacrifices and festivals are
richly provided for. The rest of the inscription assumes more and
more the character of a hymn, like those mentioned at p. 258 and
elsewhere.

The above will suffice to show the filial piety, with which Ramses,
at least in the earlier part of his reign, strove to complete and re-
store the work of his father. But the remains of the building con-
structed by him near the Temple of Soil at Abydos (p. 87) prove
that he also founded a large Memnonium for himself in the district
sanctified by the tomb of Osiris.

1. The Hypostylc Halls and the Sevenfold Sanctuary.

From the Pronaos, containing the above inscription, two doors
only now lead into the interior of the temple: the main entrance
in the middle and a narrow door to the extreme right. The First
Hypostyle Boom (Pl. C), a long but narrow apartment, makes
a solemn and. imposing impression. The roof, part of which has
fallen in, is supported by 24 columns, arranged in two rows and in
groups of four. The slender shafts are surmounted by capitals in
.the form of papyrus buds. Seti i. did not complete the plastic de-
coration of the room. Ramses began new sculptures instead of those
begun by his father, apparently forgetting the great filial piety he
arrogates to himself in the aboveuquoted inscription (p. 58).
Whether it was that the zeal of the son abated along with his grief
for his father, or that the priestly sculptors thought it better to cele-
brate a living prince rather than a dead one, the fact remains that
it is Ramses alone who is here depicted and the temple itself is
simply called the temple of Abydos, not, as in the earlier inscrip-
tions, that of Ra-ma--mcn (is. Seti). The sculptures preserved here
are of mediocre workmanship, and the inscriptions and represen~
tations, almost wholly dealing with Ramses and his reception of
gifts from the different gods, are generally uninteresting even for
the scholar. 0n the right wall, near the second chamber, is a series
of gods, consisting of Re, Sins (the giver of all delight) and his
sister Tefnut (giver of health), Sch (giver of life and strength),
Osiris, Home (giver of every victory), Isis (giver of life and strength),
the great god Aphem (Anubis), and Nut, who imparts the fulness of
salvation .---- - The six. lists of the nomes of Egypt, on the lower part
of the walls, are also interesting. As elsewhere, the districts are
represented as bearded male figures with the emblem of the nome
(a piece of surveyed ground, 3"?? 3'35 and a standard hearing the
symbol of the special district. As the lists here have no annota-
tions, they are of less value than those at Denderah and elsewhere.
They indicate that it was customary for all the districts of the land.
