Eduthhel lies d~5 days' journey from Farht'rab { Cailliand, Roblfs),
5 long days" journey from Assidt (Edmonstone), and 8, or at most a, from
el-Khdrgeh. The last~named route is described below.

The oasis was visited in 1818 by Drovetti, in 1819 by Edmonstone,
and in 1873 by Rohlfs, with hittel, Jordan, and Archerson, starting from
Farah-ah. The ascent amid the picturesque slide of the soucalled not
ciwflatllieed, on the last mentioned route is very impressive.

The oasis has at present about 173% inhabitants. It is very rich in
date-palms and olive-trees, and produces wheat, barley, rice, dose, and
dukhn, though not sufficient for its own consumption. Large acacias
(suntantrees), and fruit-trees, such as apricot and walnut trees, flourish.
The chief villages are sl-d'egr, detected, and Badskatu (see b ow).

Here are the shattered remains of a small temple in the Greece-Egyptian
style, on which Wilkinson discovered the name Caesar. According to
Cailliaud's measurements the temple is 713/2 ft. long and 31 ft. broad. it
consisted of a vestibule, and. a larger room with a smaller one behind it,
with three doors leading to three other chambers, the central one being
the adytnxn ("Plan in Caitliaud's Voyage it Marne II, XLII, 1). inside the
girdle-wall of the temple is a scanty spring with a somewhat unpleasant
taste. We continue our journey in a steep gorge, which leads in 112 hr.

village of Tssideh, with 800 inhab., largely employed in the production of
indigo. The manufacture is carried on in the open air under painiwleave
sheds. The dried leaves are placed in earthen pots with boiling water,
which is stirred with a stick until the dye-stud has been separated from
the leaves. The blue liquid is then poured into shallow holes in the
earth, and the water allowed to evaporate. To the left of the route, near
the spring of this st--Blrbsh, about 1 hr. beyond Tenidah, are the remains
of a square vaulted temple or a Roman fort, consisting of three main
