rear-wwall of the hypostyle, i.e. the entranceowall of the adjoining
hall with ten columns, dates from Ptolemy IX. Eucrgetes H. and. his
two wives, CleOpatra H. and Cleopatra 111 .---~ Above the door of
the right (Sebek) side of the temple this king appears with his first
wife and sister, presenting the figure of Me to Sebek, Esther, and
Khnnsn; above the left door he appears with his second wife,
before Arueris, Tasentnefert, and Piuebtati. Between the cornice
and frieze are the dedicatory inscriptions, on the left to Harwar, on
the right to Sebeh. To the right and left of the two doors to the next
(first) room in the direction of the Pronaos, are other two rows of
Dedication Scenes. To the right (Sebek side): in the lower row,

The traveller's attention may now be directed to the Astra-
nomicot Representations, some of which are only outlined in red
and left unfinished. The constellations in boats floating over the
heavens, on the ceilinguside of the architrave, are the most impor-
