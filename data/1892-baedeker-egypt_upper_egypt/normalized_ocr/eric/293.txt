228 Route 21. THEBES. West Bank:

has given its name to the place. To the left are the remains of
other rooms. The name of Ramses IL, inserted by himself as a
correction, should be noticed; behind are adorings for the dead. The
fine roof is not a true vault, the stones lying horizontally and being
out out. The colours are fresh; to the right and left of the deer
are Tutmes 1H. and. Tutmes II.; over the door 4 bulls. ~--Ascend-
ing 34 steps further we reach another granite doorway also built
by Tutmes UL, through which we enter arault sprinkled with stars.
This last rests against the wall of rock which rises above Ddr elu-
bahri, without being out into it. A second archway with'2 sides-n
niches leads deeper into the mountain, and there is a third unvaulmd
room which was constructed under Tutmes I. of the 18th Dynasty,
but appropriated by a distinguished official named Amenhotep,
under Ptolemy Energetes IL, and his wife Cleopatra. The inscrip-
tions of this later period compare very disadvantageously with
those of the time of the Tutmes kings.

From the N. side of the third terrace it is possible to area into the
Burial Chapel, half filled with rubbish, which is supported by 1 eighteen »
sided columns in four rows, and contains two empty sarcOphagusncbests.
On the inner wall are Anubis and od'erings for the dead. This is followed
by a vaulted Chamber the arch of which is pointed, and from this a simi~
larly vaulted Passage runs off at a right angle to the W. of which is a
very small Room, also vaulted in the same way. We thus find three vaulted
rooms, each smaller than the preceding. in front of this arrangement of
tombs there was a building of which there now remains (on the right
as we leave the tombs) a Colonnade with 7 eighteemsided columns, hear »
ing an architrare, the astragal, and the concave cornice. These rooms are
much choked up, and full of fragments of mummies, and linen rags. In
later times they were used as a common burial ground. The same fate
from the 26th Dyn. onwards betel the rooms at the end of which. is the
line picture of the Hathor Cow (p. 227); but these are new kept clean and.
easily accemible.

0n the fourth terrace also pictures of a procession have been pre-
served. 0f the row of ships nothing is' left but the water-lines below them,
but it is from here that a picture of a ship now in the Berlin museum
was taken, with an accompanying inscription telling us that the Procession
was arranged by Tutmes III. in honour of Tutmes Ii.

At no great distance from Him elvbahri there is a roughly worked
passe a out, only about 3ft. high and scarcely accessible, which was ex »
plorc by libero. It leads into a sepulchral chamber, entirely covered
with semi-hieratic inscriptions, in which was buried a princess named
stm, a farourite, and perhaps the mother of a princess Bataan belonging
to the early period of the New Empire or, according to Neville, to the
11th or 12th Dynasty.



This neighbourhood should not be ouitted without a visit to the shaft
from which the famous royal mummies were obtained. In order to reach
it we walk over the heaps of sand to the right at the foot of Ddr ebbahrl
(or we may take an easier path from the village and tombs of Shdhh
'Abd el--liurnah down the slope to the west). In scarcely 10 min. we are
in front of a narrow chasm in the rock, up which there is a sine climb
for admission. Above is the Shaft, bit, square, descending perpen cularly
for 38 it. A strong rope and great caution are necessary in order to be
let down. At the bottom is an entrance 5 ft. wide and 3 ft. high which
leads in a straight direction for 24 it. This passage then turns to the right
in a NE. direction for the length of more than 195 ft, its height vary »
rug from G to 13 ft. To the right live or six rude steps lead to a niche.
