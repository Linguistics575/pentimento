of Hathor is one that seems to indicate that the temple at Denderah
is to be regarded as a replica of a celebrated temple of the sunwgod
of Heliopolis, of which however no trace now remains. Here a
reference is made to the gilding and painting of the sculptured ore

The whole of the sculptures and inscriptions in this room refer to
Esther 1n her capacity as goddess of light who has her seat in the
sun's disc rising from the horizon, and who was as such represented
under the figure of an hawk with a woman's head in the middle of

festival. According to the sculptures and inscriptions the prepared
perfumes were also placed here. One half of the room was devoted
to the garments, the other to the sacred perfumes. Over the latter
presided the divine Manet, previously mentioned among the man-
agers of the manufacture of the incense and anointing oil as one of
the lords of the laboratory (p 88); over the former Hathotep, god
of woven fabrics, with his companion the goddess Tai, held away
