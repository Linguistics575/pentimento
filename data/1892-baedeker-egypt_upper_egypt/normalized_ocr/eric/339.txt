ink in Demotic, Greek, or Ceptic characters. A. roll containing poems by
Homer was also discovered here.

By far the most interesting object on the island is the "Nile-: -
meter, on the W. side facing Assndn, known to the Arabs as
Mityds. The learned court-astronomer of the Khedivs, Mahmdd
Bey, restored this well-preserved monument to use in 1870. Strobe
gives the following excellent description, which is interesting to
compare with the monument as it now exists.'The Nilometer is a
well built of regular hows stones, on the bank of the Nile, in which
is recorded the rise of the stream, not only the maximum but also
the minimum and average rise, for the water in the well rises and
falls with the stream. 011 the side of the well are marks, .measur-
ing the complete rise of the water and all the other degrees of its
rising. These are observed and published for general informatihn'.
Readers are referred to our account of the Mihyis at Cairo (Vol. 1.,
p. 319). The Nilometer at Elephantine consists of a narrow roofless
chamber, connected with the stream, and is reached by 52 steps in
6 flights. The lowest lending is reckoned as 4 Arabian oils or about
7 ft. above the lowest water level gthe dir'e or Arabian ell being
equal to 54 centimetres or about 2 1/3 inches). Above that point
13 oils are marked, so that the highest point marked is 30 ft.
(1'? Arab. oils) above the minimum water--level. Each all is divided
on the side of the well into 8 parts and 2d kirat. The 13 old Egyp-
tian oils, each divided into 7 spans and'28 fingers, have a total
length of 6,395 metres (about 20 it), from which Mahmt'id Bey
obtained 53 centimetres as the equivalent for an all instead of
the previously accepted 521/2 centimetres. The watcrnleyel duo-w
mates actually between the top of the first all and the seventeenth,
is. has a range at Assudn of 16 oils of 54 centimetres each. The
old and new marks are placed on every third step. From the surc-
face of the water upwards are it marks, of which, however, only
the half are necessary, as the Nile no longer rises higher.

Close beside the river, farther to the N1, lies a massive Roman
Structure, built of hewn blocks from earlier edifices. Many of
these blocks are covered with inscriptions of diderent dates, in Â»
cluding fragmentary lists of oti'crings and festival calendars and
a portion of a Nilemetcr. The rock-inscriptions close to the stream
should also be noticed. They include inscriptions by Neferkara
(Pepi), Unas, Antef as, with one by Amenemha on the other side.

The higher parts of the island command a fine *View of the
black and brown, rough and smooth rocks of the cataract, among
which the Nile, split up into many small branches, sometimes
dashes in foaming energy, sometimes flows in unrud'led calmness.
