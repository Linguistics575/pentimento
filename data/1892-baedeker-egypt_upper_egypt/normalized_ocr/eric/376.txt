the hands of the Mohmmedans.'Amm the stn'As conquered Nubia
in the year of the Hegira'20, Dongolah was captured, and a tribute
of slaves imposed upon the Nubians. When Egypt became an in-
dependent Mohammedan kingdom under the Fitimite Mu'izz in
969, the Nubians recovered their freedom. In the year of the Hegira
588 (1172 AD.) Saladin's brother captured the citadel of Maine
and plundered the church. Similar disasters followed, and the
people only escaped compulsory conversion to Isldm by heavy searin-
flces, the loss of the provinces nearest to Assudn, and the payment of
a poll-tax. The Nubian kingdom new split up into various petty
states, among which Sounds, founded. in i by the negro--tribe
of the Fungis, rose to importance and held away over the provinces
of Shcndi, Barber, and Dongclah. This, however, was of no long
duration. Dongolah was frequently invaded by the robber tribe of
the Shegiyeh.w1sma'ilPaska, son of Mohammed'dli, made himself
mmter of all these provinces in 1821. He conquered Dcngolah with-
out opposition, defeated the Sh√©giyeh at Korti, and acquired Sennar
also. This conquest, however, cost lsma'il his life. At a festival
given by him at Shendi, a but in which he had been secured was set
on fire, and he and his companions perished in the flames. But this
incident did not prevent the complete subjugation of the Sfidan,
which was converted into an Egyptian province, with the newly--
founded Khartdm as its capital. Darfdr, too, was conquered and
annexed in 1874. But the war with Abyssinia (187546), a revolt
in Darfdr, the rotten state of the Egyptian finances, the rebellion of
Arabi Pasha, the victorious advance of the Mahdi, and the death
of the devoted General Gordon (Jan. 1885) led to the loss of all the
Egyptian possessions to the S. of wan Haifa }:, in spite of the British
occupation of EgyptiSSQ) and the belated expeditions to Dongolah
and to Kharthm -: It is but too probable that these districts
will remain beyond the influence of Egypt or of Eur-spoon civilian-w

curate name for them is Nations, and as the aboriginal inhabitants
of Africa they must be distinguished from the Karmic tribes who
