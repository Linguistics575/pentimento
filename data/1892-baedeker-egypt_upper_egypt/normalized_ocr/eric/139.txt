on its exterior,'the portal for the entrance of the priest of the
lihations, with the ewer for the Mistress of the gods'. This room
also has an interesting geographical representation on the lower
part of the wall, in which seven waterudistriots of Lower Egypt,

the marginal inscriptions'the room for the Mistress in the town
of the House of Hathor','the room of the hall that lies behind the
hall of the altar', and'the divine hall of the Golden One, the

things' (sacrifices) were carved in this room, along with the gods of
the sacrificial altar; and the W. inscription names it the 6resting--
place of the Mistress of the Goddesses'. The inscriptions on the
upper and lower margins afiord additional information as to the
.orginal purpose of the room, its decorations, and the festivals celes-
hrated within it. The upper inscription, in the half running from
right to left, is as follows:'He has built the Hall of the Altar for
the Princess adorned with the vulture and the Urmns-wcrown, the
wise goddess. It resembles heaven, with its lord. the sure-god. He
