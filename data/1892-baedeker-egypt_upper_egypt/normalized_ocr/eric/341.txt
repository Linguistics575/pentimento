274? Route 28. FIRST CATARACT. From. Asses-a

are fastened to the mast, and the severe struggle with the descend-
ing current begins. Some haul on the ropes from the bank, others
guide the course of the vessel with poles from on board, and others
in the water keep it upright or word it oh from striking on sharp
rocks in the riverw'bed. Old man, young men, and boys rival each
other in the most exhausting activity, that seems almost frantic,
from its nevernceasing accompaniment of shouts, cries, and chants.
Every saint in the calendar is invoked, especially the beneficent
Sa'id, who is believedato render especially efl'ective aid in sudden
dangers. At the most difficult point, the Bob cl-Kehi'r (p. 278)
boys, for a small fee, will plunge head-first into the stream, to
reappear astride pieces of wood below the boiling surf, through
which they swim with marvellous skill. If the work is not accomw
plished before sun-sot, it is left unfinished till next morning. m
It may be remarked that the Egyptian government contemplates
widening the channel and introducing fixed regulations for the
passage .---- ~ The time occupied in taking the dhahabiyeh through the
rapids may be advantageously turned to account by the traveller by
first inspecting the cataract from. the bank. and then, by proceeding
by land to Philae, where he should pitch his tent or take up his
abode in the Osiris room (p. 295 }. The most necessary articles can
easily be transported through the rapids by a few of the sailors
in the small boat. The dragoman will arrange the new household
with the assistance of the cook and the campuservent. A. few days
spent at Philn, especially at full moon, will not easily be forgotten.
wit is not advisable to bring the dhahabiyeh as far as the island
of son and to visit Philn thence, because there are no donkeys
to be there obtained.

b. From Assets to Philse by land.

Railway in 1/2 hr., fare 5 piastres; one train daily (£891) to Shelldl
at 8.30 a.m., returning at 11 mm. m- The Ride to Philm takes iilr ht;
excellent donkeys at the landingaplace. Rich inhabitants of Assnfin spend
large sums upon their riding-asses; spirited Abyssinian donkeys, if they
are also handsome, cost from 363. upwards .---- The inspection of the ob-
jects of interest of Acacia occupies Sui hrs.

The route leads past the Post Office into the town, then turns to the
right (leaving the Bazaar on the left) and follows the telegraph-wires
across a (5 min.) bridgoover the railway to Philm (Shellal). The Hole »
rants Temple lies a few minutes to the left, below (see below). Thence we
proceed straight on to the Mohammedan Tombs, passin' on the way the
graves of an Austrian and of a sailor of the British ship Monarcb' (Dawes
d. 1884). The Quarries are reached from the Ptolemaic temple by con-
tinuing straight on for a few minutes, then turning abruptly into the
desert path, which soon brings us in sight of tall blocks of stone, behind
which is the quarry (p. 2'36). The obelisk lies til min. to the right of the
abovevmentioned European graves.
