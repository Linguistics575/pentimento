brought to be sacrificed. The landings-place on the other bank, opu-
posite Kernels, was united with the temple of Kurnah by rows of
sphin'res. As the ancient pilgrim continued on his way towards the
NW. and crossed the hill of the cemetery now called el-Asasif, he
came in sight of the rocky amphitheatre which enclosed the terraced
precincts of the temple of Der el--Bahri. Northwards from hinrnah a
well-made route led to the valley of the Tombs of the Kings, now
called Bibin el-Mulilh, which could also be reached by a shorter
though more fatiguing mountain--path from elwAsasit'. Between the
entrance of the "valley of the Kings' Tombs and el--Asasif and close
to the mountain lay the necropolis known as Drab Abu'l Neggah.
Thence following the edge of the fertile strip towards the S.W. we
reach the magnificent Ramesseum. Behind rises the mountainuridge.
The tombs on its E. slepe, partly occupied as dwellings by the
fellahini belong to the village now called Sheikh'Abd el-Kurnah.
As we gaze down upon the plain from the higher-dying graves, the
Colossi of Memnon are conspicuous in the midst of the fertile belt.
Behind these are the prominent ruins, known as Kern elnfléien,
rising near the central point of an imaginary line connecting the
Ramesseum with the temple of Medinet Babe, the magnificent
Memnonium of Ramses Ill. Turning from Medinet Hahn to the
S.W., we reach a small temple of the Ptolemies; to the N1, near
the mountains? lies the valley with the Tombs of the Queens; and
skirting the line of hills to the NEW. we reach the scanty tomb-
remains of Enrnet Murral', to the W. of which lies a valley with
the small but interesting temple of Der elnMedineh. Two points
are of special value for taking one's bearings. One is the summit
of the mountain lying between el~Asasif and libhn elaMnldh; the
other is the door of either of two tombs at Shéhh'Abd el-Kurnah.
One of the tombs, in which Lepsins lived, is known to the guides as
Kasr Lepsius; the other was inhabited by Ebers, who is remembered
by the fellahin as Abe Bdlcs { Father of Paul)

The name Tnnnns is probably the Greek form of the Egyptian

Tnabn TheHellenes, familiar saith the name Thebes (Gilded),) which
was borne by cities in Bmotia, Attica, Thessaly, Cilicia, near Miletns
in Asia Minor, etc., believed that in Tuabu they had met it once
more. Possibly, however, the name may be derived from the words

bank at least. Among thelGreeks the town was known as Ardenohtg,
a translation of Panamcn, city of Ammon, also called Diocpolis
Megotc or Diocpolis Mayne to distinguish it from Diospolis Par-ya
or Hon (p. 70).

The famous capital of Upper Egypt was certainly founded an-
