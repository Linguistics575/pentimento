27. The Island. of Elephantine.

This island is reached by small boat in a few minutes from the landing-
place. Cook's tourists are first transported in comfortable boats to Ele-
phantine and then to the bazaar at Assails (small gratuity). A revs round
the island is recommended (1 ] 2 hr.). The entire visit takes barely an hour.

Etephontine was a place of great sanctity from a very early pe-

riod among the ancient Egyptians. It formed a nome by itself

ismerely the Greek translation of a native name. The Arabs call
it simply Gesireb, he. island, or Gesiret Anchors; and it is also said
to be named etuZdhir or'the blooming'. Though the vegetation is
luxuriant in many spots, the writer never heard the last--given name
applied to it.

The Egyptian priests described the Source of the Nile as a mystery,
that would. only be revealed to the soul at the twelfth gate of the under-
world; yet at the same time, they pointed out the'symbolical sources of

the Nile', so to speak, in the eddies among the rocks of the cataracts

to the S. of Elephantine. They named these

as. the Karts or sources of Elephantine. Herodotus heard of these from
a scribe in the treasury of the temple of Athena at Sale. The Helical Â»:
nassian thought that the priest was but jeeting when he told him that
between Syene and Elephantine lay tvvo lofty peaked mountains, Krophi
and Mophi, from the midst of which gushed the bottomless sources of the
Nile, one half of which flowed to the N. to Egypt, the other half to the S.
to Ethiopia. - However foolish this opinion, which Seneca also reports,
may appear, it was not pure invention, for the monuments inform us that
the people were really taught to believe that the Egyptian Nile had his
abode among the rapids to the S. of Elephantine. Some located it to the
N. of the island of Bigeh--Senem (p. 297). Khnum, the god of cataracts,
was revered before all other gods on this island; and next to him ranked.
Sati (a form of Isis--Sothis), because the beginning of the inundation eoin~
sided with the mly rising of this constellation, and the cataract may be
regarded as the threshold of the swollen Nile entering Egypt.

In the year 1822 Mohammad'Ali, in order to build a palace for
himself at Aswan, caused the destruction of the Temple of Khnum,
built under Amenbotep HI. of the 18. Dyn. near the S. and of the
island, and also of a smaller Temple of Tutmss 111., lying more to
the N.W., and known as the N. temple. Travellers pass the letter
on their way to the city, in whose N. outskirts it lay. The savants
of the French Expedition saw this temple before its destruction and
published views of it. Now all that is to be seen on the island are
some huge heaps of ruins, a granite doorway of the time of Alsace-
der 1., and a granite Statue of Msrenpteh 1. Blocks of stone and
sculptured fragments lie around.

The inhabitants of the' two villages on the island, many of whom
understand nothing but Nubian, ofl'er coins, small anti cities (many imi-
tations), and fragments of pottery with inscriptions ostraca) for sale.
The last-named are sometimes valuable; the inscriptions argon! vgith
