shes, a species of Mormyrns (Arab. Misdeh), was held in such high hononr
here, that the inhabitants refused to eat any fish caught by a hook. lest
the book might previously have injured on Onyrrhynchns. In the neigh-
bouring town of Cvnopolis (see below) the dog was held in equal honour,
and Plntareh relates how a'very pretty quarrel", the settlement of which
required the intervention of the Romans, arose between the two towns,
owing to the facts that the citizens of each had killed and dined on the
sacred animals of the other. Juvenal gives an account of a similar strife
between Ombos and Tentyra (p. 907). On the introduction of Christianity
Oxyrrhynchns became so "full of oonvents that monkish songs were heard
in every quarter". Convent jostles convent all round, forming as it were a
second town of monks. In the 5th cent. the diocese of Osvrrhynchns is
said to have contained 10,000 monks and 123131311113. In the town itself
were 12 churches. Under the Arabs it is known only as Behnesah. In the
Mamelnke period it was still of some importance, but it has since steadily
declined. From Behnesah the desert-roots leads to the'small oasis' of
Bohsdyeh, also known as the Oasis of Bchnsseh (comp. p. 3%).

About 4 M. above Abe Girgeh, close to the E. bank. of the Nile,
are the insignificant remains of Shhkh elaFadhl, near which is
Homethoh. Father Sicard's discovery of a large number of dog~
mummies here proves that we are standing on the site of the escrow-
pelts of Cynopotis (Knvtbv ethic), the'city of the dcgs', which, as the
above story indicates, must have adjoined Oxyrrhyncbns. Strebo's
words are:'Next come the Cyncpolitan some and Cvnopolis, where
Anubis is worshipped and dogs are held sacred and fed with con-
secrated moat'. Several troughnliho hollows and clefts have been
found here, some of which, in the rocks, are of considerable size;
but no inscriptions have been discovered. Cynopolis itself, accord-
ing to Ptolemy, lay on an island in the Nile, bnt no traces of it are
new visible. Opposite, 11/4 M. from the W. bank, lies the village
of ct-Eés.

Kotosonch (rail. stat, p. 1), on the W. bank, has a large palm-
grove. Opposite (E. hank) lies Smartest. To the N. and S. quer-
ries are worked in the limestone rock .---- - Among the rocks here is
a small temple [ not very easily found), hearing the names of Seti H.
and of Morenptah Hotepher~ms, - supposed to be the Pharaoh of
the Exodus (19th Dye.) The kings are odering sacrifices to the
triad of Sebeh, Esther, and Horns, and representations of Sebek
(with the head of a crocodile), Esther, and Ramses HI. may be
made out on the external wall of the grotto, facing the spectator.
The inscriptions are very indistinct but are couched in the usual
form of thanksgiving to the gods for the blessing of a long reign.

On the W. bank lies Samalldt, with a handsome railway~station
(p. l), sngsrufactories, palms, and fields of clever. A. little farther
to the 8., on the E. hank, rise the steep rocky sides of the Gebcl
etu'gtr ('bird~monntain'), with an extensive flat top bearing the
Coptic convent of ole-Bnhérfi Those who wish to visit the moon »

in drawing water. But the name is probably derived from the old legend
of the Bahir bird.
