left on each side, united by means of a building between them,
which has a semi-sported on the W. side, farthest from the Nile.
The capitals of the side-columns resemble those of the front com
lumns of the hypmthral temple on Philm. They are lotnswoalyn
capitals, framed at the top with leaves springing from buds, while
beneath are the usual five annuli or rings. Only a single crosses
beam new rests upon the beams running lengthwise in this little
temple, which cannot have been more than sheet 25 ft. square.

About 10 min. to the S. is a double girdle-wall of large hewn
stones, stretching to the Nile, and furnished with a gateway. A
flight of steps leads down to the river. The pylenwlike gateway
appears to have been faced by another of the same kind. The wall
has been taken for the remains of a Roman permanent camp. An
ancient road leads thence to the S.W. to some:; Quarries,
which contain about 60 Greek retire inscriptions (and one demons)
dating from the Roman imperial epoch (Septimins Severus, Cara »
calls to Gordian). There are also two busts and a carefully con-
structed. niche, with the winged. sun-disc above it, apparently in »

by priests of the Games (lapses 16pm, also dpxlepeoq, .9;

quarries for the purpose of building temples.

this robably lucrative office. Eight tablets (the four earlier beside the

beats, held this office eight times, for which first and last be expended
no less than 300 pieces of gold (ypesoda), equal to about 2751. in modern
