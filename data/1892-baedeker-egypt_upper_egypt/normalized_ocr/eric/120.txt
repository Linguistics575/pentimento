to Kermit. KENEH. 5. Route. 73

At the time of the pilgrimage to Mecca { tench presents a very lively
scene, as it is than frequented by large numbers of the participators
in that great religious picnic. The spiritual and material wants of
the pious Hcdjddj are catered for by six spacious mosques, nume-
rous codes-houses, and alarge number of places of amusement, among
the attractions of which Egyptian dancing--girls are prominent. For
the rest lieneh diners little in general character from the other
towns of Upper Egypt. The traveller should not fail, however, to
see the most valuable piece of land near Keneh, which is about one
Feddan (3500 sq.yds.) in area and yields an excellent variety of
potter's clay that has made { tench pottery, like that of Assifit, famous
throughout the country. { tench has a special reputation for its
Kelsi (pl. of Kalle), or cool porous water-bottles, and for its Bonds
and Zir, large vessels used in carrying, purifying, and preserving
water. In some of the early Egyptian inscriptions, figures of the
Belles and Zir appear as distinctive symbols, in the exact forms in
which they are made to-day. Hundreds of thousands of these clay
vessels are annually exported from Keneh in boats of a primitive
but not unpractical description, constructed for the purpose, in
which they are piled up in pyramidal form, fastened together with
ropes made of the best of the datewpalm and attached to rectangular
frames. A trustworthy report fixes the number sent away in 1860
at 900,000. Considerable activity is also manifested in the manu-
factors of kiln-dried pottery, generally either red or black, used for
chibouh--heads, bottles, pitchers, vases, drinkingavessels, etc, of
every size and shape. The almost invariably graceful forms and
tasteful decorations of these utensils may be unreservedly set down
as a bequest from ancient Egypt.

6. Routes through the Eastern Desert.

Enrich is a place of some importance as the starting-point of the
caravans traversing the Arabian desert to linger (p. 77) and as an em.-
porium of the trade of Upper Egypt with the coasts-districts of the Red
Sea. It consequently odor-dc a good opportunity of making a short and
comparatively easy desert journey, as the interesting excursion to { loser
can be made without any very great privatise. or danger. The caravann
route leads vih Eamdmdt, traversing the rocky Arabian Desert, which is
not only of great scenic grandeur but also full of interest for the mate"
ralist and the archaeologist. Eosér, a port 0n the Red Sea, is about
110 M. from Ecneh, and the journey can be made comfortably in four,
or at most five days. _

These desert-routes were important even in antiquity for the trade
with the seaports and the land of Pest (Arabia) on the one side and the
valuable quarries in the mountains of the Arabian Desert on the other.
Spices and other costly products were cent across the desert to $ 911811,
at first on donkey-back and afterwards on camels, while green hreccia
and several varieties of granite were sent down to the sea in return. The
most important points on the Red Sea, named from N. to 8., were Moos
Hermes (now Add Ear cl~§z'bh), in the latitude of blonfaldt; Looker
Limes new goods; and Bcrcnikc, in the latitude of Assn-Sin. The route
from hunch to hires Hermes leads to the N.E., and a short detour may
be made through the Wadi England, with its gran.ite; rgppng'i§p,,, cunt 313333
