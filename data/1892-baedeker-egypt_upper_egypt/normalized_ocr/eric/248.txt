question how the courts were originally arranged, which preceded
the actual sanctuary. Little of them remained, and the later Pharaohs.
and even the Ptolemies and Roman emperors (notably Antoninns
Pins) extended the old building. The following description begins
at the E. facade, which faces us when we turn to the left (NJ after
returning throngh the gate of the sowcalled pavilion.

The visitor approaching from the Nile is confronted with a hand Â»
some Pylon (Pl. K), to the N. of the entrance to the temple
of Ramses. In the centre is a beautiful gateway, with a well-
executed winged disc of the sun in. the deep concave cornice. The
narrow foreu--conrt in front was enclosed under the Ptolemies with
columns, of which only the two at the entrance have been preserved
(beside Pl. I). In the broader forewcourt outside (Pl. H) the car-n
touche of the emperor Antoninns Pins occurs several times. The
large Pylon (Pl. K) dates from the late Ptolemaic epoch, for it exa-
hibits Ptolemy Soter H. Lathyrns worshipping the gods; but it in-
cludes stones from an earlier edifice, some of which are upside down
and some show detached fragments of inscriptions (cg. sacrificial
lists, with the names of Ramses 11.). Beyond the pylon is a Chapel
(Pl. L), only'30 ft. long, dating from the reign of Nectanebns 11.,
who was acknowledged as king by the Egyptians in the middle of
the Persian epoch. The roof was supported by eight columns which,
however, have disappeared, leaving only the low walls which con-
nected them like screens. Immediately adjoining the chapel is a
Second Pylon, 50 ft. wide, which was erected under Taharlra the
EthiOpian (25th Dyn.) and renewed and provided with inscriptions
by Ptolemy Lathyrns. On the front of this pylon appears Nect-
anebns IL, on the back Taharka. Beyond this is a rnined Court
(Pl. M), with (to the right) the granite lintels of a gateway, built by
Petamenap, a noble living nnder the 26th Dyn, to whom the
large tomb at elmAsasif' (p. "222) belongs. We now at last reach the
(learner Tnnrrn Bornmnos, begun under Amenhotep l. and Tut-
mes 1., completed nnderARamaka, Tntmes 11., and Tntmes 111., and
restored by later kings, including even Ptolemy Physhon. These
late restorations were of trifling importance; as a whole the build-
ing is beyond doubt a work of the iBth Dynasty. It consists of a
Sanctuary (Pl. N), like the cells. of a Greek temple, forming the
kernel of the entire edifice, surrounded on three sides by pillars,
while on the rear it is" adjoined by Sir Apartments. Between the
rows of pillars to the right and left and the cells, and also behind the
latter, were polygonal columns, resembling those which are to be
fonnd at Benihasan and the oldest parts of Kamah. Those in
front have been destroyed, but one has remained erect behind
the cells. The inscriptions are written for the most part in the

beautiful style of the 18th Dyn., but contain nothing of importance.

The Buildsrs' Inscriptions, found on various parts of the temple, are
interesting as throwing light on the Hrsronr of the edifice. ngr each
