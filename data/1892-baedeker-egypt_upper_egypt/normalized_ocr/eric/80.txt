Streamers nan Hierosr or run Futon. In the great plateau of the
Wynn Desert, which rises soc-to) ft. above the sea~level, is situated the
province of the Fords: (from the ancient Egyptian'Phiom', i.s. marsh or
lake district), the first of the oases (p. 343), which is usually considered
to belong to the vallegfiof the Nile, and is justly celebrated for its extra-
ordinary fertility (p.). This tract is in the form of an oval basin,
8 & 0 sq. H. in area, and supports a population of WWI) souls; it is enclosed
by the Libyan hills, which are here of moderate height, and lies about
threewdfths of a degree to the S. of Cairo. It enjoys a remarkably fine
climate, and has but rarely been visited by the plague. This'land of
roses' is still one of the most beautiful parts of Egypt, and more than
any other Npart of the Nile valley deserves the well known epithet of'the
gift of the lie", bestowed on Egypt by Herodotus, as it is entirely indebted
for its fertility to the waters of the Nile with which it is artificially irrigated.
The Bohr Ydsttf (p. 28), a channel 207 hi. in length, which is more probably
a natural branch of the river, artificially adapted, than a canal, diverges
from the Nile to the N. of Assifit, and flows through a narrow opening in
the Libyan chain into the Fay'dm, where it divides into numerous
ramifications, abundantly watering the whole district. One of its branches
runs towards the N., skirting the E. slopes of the Libyan hills. At the point
where the Babs Yusdf enters the Faydm, the district forms a plateau of
moderate height, descending towards the W. in three gradations towards
the Birket elcgnrdn, a long2 narrow lake, extending from S.W. to NE.
0n the easternmost and highest part of the oasis the Labyrinth and
Lake Morris (pp. 39, all) were once situated; the central part yields the
luxuriant crops for which the province is famous, while the western »:
most part chiefly consists of sterile desert land. To the W. and ll. of the
Birhet cl-hurdn rise precipitous limestone hills, beyond which lies the
immense sandy desert of Sahara. The Faydm must have been reclaimed
from the desert ata very early period, probably during the early empire,
in the reign of Amenexnha 111., as monuments of his period indicate
that he was perhaps the first of the Pharaohs who sought to regulate
the whole course of the Nile. 0n the Upper Nile Prof. Lepsius has
found Kilometers constructed by that monarch, and in the Faydm, on
the site of the Labyrinth, a number of blocks of stone inscribed with his
name. The Greeks called him Amelie, or Morris, and believed that the lake
known to them as'Lake hiccris", which they regarded as a marvel of
engineering skill, was named after him. The word met-t, however, is
the Egyptian for lake or overflow, so that the great basin of the Fayfim
was simply'the lake", and it was from his exertions in connection with
the irrigation works that Ameuemha obtained the name of Mmris. We
learnfrom several inscriptions, and from a papyrus roll treating of the
Faydm, that the rovince was known in the time of the Pharaohs as To
that, or the lake- and, and that Lake Mmris was called seat, signifying
the discharge or posterior lake. On its bank rose the celebrated Laby~
rinth, which was probably renewed by the Bubastite monarchs of the
22nd 33 arty. About the same period the town of Crocodilopolis, situat-
ed on she Hearts, and afterwards called Arsinod after the wife of Pto-
lemy Philadelphns, was so extended and embellished by Osorhon I. that
it is called the'city of Osorkon I.' in the inscriptionontbc .t d
