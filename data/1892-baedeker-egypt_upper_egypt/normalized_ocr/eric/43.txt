hoisting oi the lateen sail with a lusty chorus, and if one of the brisk
'Etesia' blows, which Herodotus mentions as driving heats up the Nile,
the long pointed craft dies quickly along, passing in rapid succession
the Khediye's palace and the barracks of Kasr err-Nil, Kasr el--'Ain,
the island of Rodah with its palaces (on the E. bank), and the chi-s
tones of Gesireh and Giaeh (W. bank). Old Cairo lies on the E.
bank, and beyond, it rise the Mokattam Mia, with the citadel and

on the W. is the group of pyramids at Gizeh. To the left (E. bank)
farther on, are the quarries and hamlets of Torah and Ma'sarah (see
Baedeker'e Lower Egypt, p. 403). Opposite, on the W. bank, rise the
pyramids of Abusir, Sakkhrah, and Dahshdr. Near the bank, to the
left, amidst a fine grove of palms, is a Ceptic consent, and adjacent
is a gunmiaetory, begun by lsma'il Pasha, but never finished.

The steamer remains for some hours at Bedrashén (rail. stat,
p. i), where asses are kept ready for a visit to Memphis, Sakkhrah,
etc. (comp. Bacdelcer's Lower Egypt, R. 4 }. Opposite, on the right
bank of the Nile, lies Helwan (ibid, p. 404), frequented as a water-
ingmplace....... 0n the bank at Kofr el-'Aydt (W. bank; rail. stat),
where the steamer lays to for the night, are some ancient construe-
tions which may hare belonged to the Count of Mensa. The "on-

shaped pyramid of Hidden (the somcalled'False Pyramid') becomes.

Bikkah, on the W. bank, is the startingmpoint of the excursion
to the Pyramid and Maegabos of Middm (asses with poor saddles may
be procured at the village; 2 fr. and bakshish).

The Presets sun Msspasss or mecca, the oldest monuments in the
world, deserve a visit, which if the traveller approaches by the river, may
be accomplished from the village of Bristol: in about 8 hrs. (railway tray-

11 ].; hr. to the pyramid. which rises close to the cultivated country on the
soil of the desert, 1% H. to the N. of the village of Harlem. This appears
to be the oldest of the local names handed down to us, as it is met with
on the mastabas of the early period of Snefru.

The Pyramid of Iédhm is so difl'ereut from all the other structures of
the kind that it is called by the Arabs'Ehflarm el--Kodddb", or'the false
persons". From a large heap of rubbish which covers its base, the
smooth and steep upper part of the structure rises in. three difi'erent
stages at an angle of 74° 10', and is still preserved to a height of 122 ft.
The first section is 69 ft, and the second hill/2 ft, while the third, now
almost entirely destroyed, was once 32 ft. in height. The outer wsdlseou-

holes in one of the surfaces were made by Lepsius an Erbkam when
they examined the pyramid, the construction of which afi'orded them an
admirable clue to the principle upon which the others were built (Vol. 1.,
p. 350). The Pyramid of Hidden was never completed; the heap of debris
at its base consists of the material which once filled the angles of the
different sections, so as to give the pyramid a smooth surface. The pyra-
mid was pillaged as early as in the time of the filth Dynasty. It was
opened in 1881 by Keepers), who found along corridor "apd a climber
