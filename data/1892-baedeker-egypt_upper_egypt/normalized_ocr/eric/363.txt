with the concave comics and astragal, exhibits an unusually fine
inscription, carved in the grand style, of which a duplicate occurs
on the architrave of the E. colounade opposite. This Dedication-
Inscription records that Ptolemy IX. Energetes fl. .Physhou (with
numerous titles) and his wife Cleopatra, princess and mistress of
both worlds, the Energetm (divine benefactors), loved the life-
giving Isis, the mistress of Ahaton, the queen of the island of Philm

surnames is especially important.

At the top of the left Colonnade, next the first pylon, are some
demotic and hieroglyphic Dec-recs, of the 21st year of Ptolemy Epi-
phanes, one relating to the celebration of the suppression of a revolt
and. the punishment of the rebels, the other in honour of Claspatra,
wife of Epiphanes. These inscriptions, of great scientific value
though extremely lightly and almost illegihly carved, were discovered
by Lepsius in 1843. Unfortunately they have been much injured
by figures carved over them under Neos Dionysus. An upper story
of Nile bricks, new in ruins, was built at some later period on the
roof of this peripteral temple. It is entirely out of place and
should be removed.

f. The Building on the E. side of the Peristyle (Pl. M), men-
tioned on p. 288, lies opposite the births-house, and presents a long
Colonnade of if) columns, with elaborate capitals, towards the
court. In the rear- Â« wall of this colonnade is first, to the left, a
large doorway, leading through a vestibule to the outside of the
temple, and then three lesser doors leading into three small chem-w
hers, partly devoted to scientific purposes. At the 8. end, close to
the pylon, is a fifth door, admitting to a room now half in ruins.
To the left of this room is another chamber (Pl. 1; see below), and
straight on is the Staircase (P1. to) leading to the rooms on the
upper story. Some of the latter are tolerahly spacious, but have no
inscriptions; whereas the lower story and the columns were adorned
with hieroglyphics by Ptolemy XIII. Neos Dionysus. The Inscrip-
time in the various rooms are due to Tiberius, to whom Phflm in
general is much indebted.

The most interesting rooms on the E. side of the peristyle
are first that into which the door nearest the pylonmaud lepdmg to
