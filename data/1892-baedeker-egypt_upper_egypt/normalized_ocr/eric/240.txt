he won so much praise, it is said that they worshipped him as soon as
they heard of his bravery, that they threw themselves on the ground at

the king addresses his faithful followers, telling them that Amman has
lent him his throne, power, strength, and victory. In line 16 the nations
that were unable to resist the attack of the islanders are named. Of the
latter it is said:'No people made head against their arms, from the land
of Kheta to Kati, Kirkamasha (Karhhemish), Aratu (dradosg, and Areas
(Assyria). They assembled in the land of Amara (Amorites?, they ever-
came the people and the land as though they did not exist. They came,

The king barred the mouth of the Nile as with a wall with well-manned
ships, and attached the enemy with land-forces and chariots, treading

The roof is supported on the N. and S. by columns, on the E.
by a row of carystides, while on the W. the rear is closed by a
passage, with eight csryatide-pillsrs in front and eight columns bea-
