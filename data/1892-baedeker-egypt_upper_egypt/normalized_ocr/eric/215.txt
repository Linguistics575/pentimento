and. soldiers, heard the sound about the first hour; but I was unable
to decide whether it proceeded from the base or from the status, or
indeed whether it was deliberately produced by one of those stand-n
iug round the pedestal. For as i do not know the cause, anything
appears to me much more credible than that the sound issued from
the stone thus placed'. Doubts as to the genuineuees of the pho »
nomenou ceased soon after Straho's time, and While that famous
geographer mentions only an iuartieulate soundwdcpos), Pausenias
speaks of a musical note and Juvenal refers to the'resouance from
the magic strings of the shattered Memnon'. By later observers the
sound is compared to that of a stroke upon metal, or even of a tram--
pet-blast and of human voices singing. The sound was heard only at
or soon after sunrise, though by no means invariably then; and some
of the most distinguished visitors were disappointed. of hearing it.
Among these was Septimius Severus, who caused the restoration of
the upper portions, perhaps with a view to propitiate the angry god.
Thereafter the phenomenon ceased, and the colossus, abhorred by
the Christians as a pagan idol, fell rapidly into oblivion as the new
religion spread.

Letronne has proved that the resonance of the stone is on no account
to be explained as a mere priestly trick, and in the opinion of eminent
physicists, it is perfectly possible that a hard resonant stone, heated by
the warm sunlight suddenly following upon the cold nights in Egypt,
might emit a sound in the early morning. A. similar phenomenon has
been observed elsewhere, as by Professors Ebers under the porphyry
slide of the Sinai mountains, and by the savants of the French Expos
» dition near the granitessanctuary at Kernels and in the granite quarries
of Assudn (Syenel. An English traveller near the Maladetta in the Pyre-
nees heard a sound issuing from the rocks, not unlike the note of an
Aeolian harp, and the name given to it by the natives,'the matins of the
damned", seems to prove that it was of frequent if not regular occur: -

sound of splitting stones, ascribed by the natives to the agency of Moheei

phenomena in the volcanic region discovered by him to the E. of De »

one, not with the doves of early morning, was exposed unusually directly
to the rays of the rising sun, and the famous sound may have been pro-
dnced by a current of air, generated by this sudden change of temperature,
passing over the rough and pebbly surface. in that case the phenomenon
would. naturally sense when the upper part of the figure was replaced...

The numerous Greek and Latin inscriptions, in prose and verse, in »
scribed upon the legs of the figure by travellers under the Roman empire,
are peculiarly interesting. These are more numerous on the left than on
the right leg, and none are beyond the reach of a man standing at the
foot of the status. The earliest were carved in the reign of Nero, the
latest in those of Se timius Severus and Caraealla, and the most numer-
ous ('27) in that of adriau. Only one Egyptian (who is responsible for
a short demotic inscription) is found among these scribblers, who show
both more reverence for antiqoity and more wit than their modern represen-
tatives. hi the same time it must be acknowledged that the writings on the
colossus of Kemnon are not Without scientific value. They were for the
