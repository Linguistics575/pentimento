sing with the black mountains and stretching among them for along way
is the Wadi. Emmet, where the green breccia was qumried in the most
ancient times. In 1 hr. more we reach the Bin Enmdmdt. a well 18 ft. in
diameter with a stone coping. Near the well are the remains of a Roman
wall, and between the two are five unfinished sarcophagi, some completely
shattered. Near the well begins a series of short graffiti, including an
inscription of Fibre em hob, a so erintendcnt of laboerers. and represent: -
ing Amman with a ram's head caring the diet crown. The eartouche
of Soil 11. is also met with. About 1 hr. farther on are longer inscrip-
tions. In the first a miner named Art on beatpe is mentioned and the

symbol of the crow-bar is given. The numerous inscriptions of the

old empire found here, belonging to the 5th., 6th, 11th, 12th, and 13th
Dynasties, have been published by Lepvins (Part II. of his'Denhmdler?
and have recently been completed by. Golenischch'. They h n with
kings Testers-Assn and Uses of the 5th, and Unarmed and Pepi o the 6th
Dynasty. The most interesting of all is the inscription of the 8th year of
South tors, in which a military expedition from Koptos to Roses is re-
corded; it gives the names of the stations. mentions the digging of two
cisterns, an relates the passage from Toe (the early name of Roger) to
the'Holy Land' (in. Arabia). The name of Rohannu also occurs. Among
the later inscriptions of the filth Dynasty may he mentioned one of the
3rd year of Ramses ('Denkmdler' of Le sins, III. 219:, transl. in Brngsch's
'Histox'y of Egypt', Eng. trench, Vol.., p. 175 at squ. We learn from
this inscription that in the part of this csert named Robeson

Misf, so called from the Bckhsn found there, a dark-green, almost black,
and exceedingly hard dioritc, which was highly prised by the Egyptian
sculptors. This region is figured in the fragments of a map of the time
of Ramses 11. now { preserved in the museum of Turin; and from it it
wonld seem that gol also was procured in the Behhen Rte. In the treasury
of the temple of Medinet Hahn we find mention made of gold from Rush

a
(Ethiopia), Teh (Edie), Nubit (Omhos) and%. By this last we

should undoubtedly understand gold brought by the Koptos trading route,
but not gold obtained there. The Torin Museum possesses the plan of
another map of a goldmining region (of the time of Soil 1.), the old
from which seems to have been carried over the caravan-route en ng
opposite Edie. The inscriptions in the screened Temple of Reddsiyeh
(more properly dei'dhbds; see p. 253) treat of the waterasupply on this
route to the gold mines.

In the great inscription of Ramses IV. a complete list is given of all
the higher and lower officials, as well as of all the workmen including
em Aperio (from the desert to the E. of the Delta), who had been sent
to the quarries hy command of the king. The total number amounts to
-. souls, to: whose support commissariat columns were constantly
on the move between Koptos and Bekhcn. At line 18 we read:'Total 83%.
Provisions for these were brought a on ten waggous, and six yoke of
oxen were attached to each waggon in going from Egypt to the Behhcn
hits.'---- Among the later inscriptions is one of the time of Darius, giving
the genealogy of 25 architects. Xerxes and Artercrxes are also mentions
in the inscriptii no of Persian officials.

Just beyond the quarries the route turns from the N.E. to the S. and
passes the ruins of st-Fowdkhir, an old mining site. Those who wish to
continue their journey to the Red Sea have still two short days' marches
ahead of them, the route leading through the deifi√©sgfnhtofiidoh (Bin
