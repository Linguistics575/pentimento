by fine palms and. Nile acacias, especially near the riverside villages.
Here, as in most of Egypt, large quantities of pigeons are kept by
the peasants, chiefly for the sake of their droppings, which form the
only manure used in the fields, the dung of the cattle being dried
and used as fuel. Large pigeonuhonses, not unlike pylons, are
visible in all the villages, and huge flocks of pigeons are seen
wheeling in the air or settling like a dark cloud on the fields. Most
of these pigeons are of the common grey species, and attain a con--
siderable size, but many pretty little reddish-grey turtle doves are
also seen. The traveller is at liberty to about these birds, which in
the form of a pigeon-pie with olives form a most acceptable addi-
tion to his larder, but he should exercise this liberty with discretion
and not rob the harmless fetish of too many of his feathered friends.
The pigeons really consume more than they produce, so that their
encouragement by the fellihin is rightly regarded as a serious
mistake in their husbandry.

Those who are interested in Egyptian agriculture may utilise
the opportunity of an unfavourable wind to go ashore here. Fora
merly convent after convent occupied this district, and the gardens
of the monks, according to Mahrizi, made it possible for the tra »
veller to walk continually 1n the shade. A. few oonvents still remain,
such as the Dér era-Rifeh (W. bank), on the slope of the Libyan
hills, 8 M. to the S. W. of Assidt, with the tomb of Tutus, son of
Rahotcp and commander of the archers, and. other ancient Egyptian
graves. The inscriptions prove that Shaswhotsp, the capital of the
Hypselite nome, lay in this vicinity, and it may perhaps be identi-
fied with the modern Sketch. Of the Christians who resided, here 111
the 11th cent. we are told. that they spoke Greek as well as Coptic.
Interesting Coptic MSS. may still reward the searcher in all these
convents.

The traveller need not break his journey between Assifit and
Akhmim, as even the antiquarian will derive little profit from. the
scanty remains on this part of the river. Worm, nearly opposite
nosing perhaps occupies the site of the ancient Contralyoopotis. In
the Gabei Rolrhdm, to the E. of the villages of f and
Notofeh, is an alabaster quarry.

15 M. Butig or dbnttg (steamboat and mail station), an agri-
cultural town on the W. bank with. 10, 800 inhab. and a small harv-
bour filled with Nile- « boats, lies in the ancient Hypselite come. The
present name is probably derived from the conversion of the ancient
Egyptian name Hauabcti into the similarlyusounding Greek name of
Antique } (Apothcke; Coptic Tapothyke), i. e. Storehouse, an ad-
mirable name for the chief town of a district so fertile in grain.
Among the Hellenee it was generally known as Abotic.

At Beddri, on the E. bank, 2 M. from the river, are some rude
rockwtombs without inscriptions. On the W. bank follow the mail
steamboatmstations Ssdfsh and Temeh.
