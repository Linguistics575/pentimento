and sometimes scratching out older names. 011 the capitals the
cartouches of Ramses H. or of his more immediate successors are
found; on the border of the extreme top of the shaft, this same
Phareah is usually named king of Upper and Lower Egypt, lord of
both worlds, son of the sun, lord of the diadems, etc. The broader

By far the most important place among the gods here is filled
by Ammon, Mutb, and Khunsu, the Theban triad (Vol. 1., p.138).
At Karnak Amman was conceived of in two capacities, which must
be distinguished from each other; he was in the first place Amman
Generator, in the second place Ammonulte, the king of the gods.
Amman may be identified by his featherucrown, Khuusu by the
creScent on his head and the lock on his temples, and Math by the
vulture-weep. The other gods that appear with them may be easily
identified with the help of the introduction on the Religion of
Ancient Egypt (Vol. 1., p. 124). 011 the architrave are some clearly

an archer of a mighty arm and like the (god of war) Mentu a great
wall of brass. He is the protector of his soldiers, when they thirst
in the hollow way, on the day of battle. No opposition is adored
to him from the hundred thousand brave hearts that are united in
one place'. In the inscriptions the king usually boasts of having
erected an eternal and magnificent building in the house of his
father Ammon, of founding festivals, or of sharing great treasures.
