The colossal figure within this tomb represents Kai, son of Tot-
hotep, e high-priest, a steward of the mysteries of the word of God,
a privy ehamberlein (superintendent of the works in the inner pal-
ace), and the head of a name. Hie paternal grand-another was a
daughter of Usertesen 1., the second king of the 12th Dynasty,
and he was also connected with the royal family on the mother-
side. He was likewise related to the family of Nehera and Khnum-
hotep (see p. 15).

The successful transportation of the statue figured in his tomb was
one of the chief events m the life of Kai. The scene shows us an image,
13 e115 in height, securely fastened to a sled. Small cushions are inserted
to revent the polished stone from being injured by the ropes. To the
ale are attached four strong cables, each manned by 43 workmen (in all
172), the'young men', as the inscriptions inform us,'of the W. and E.
of the nome'. Ott the lap of the itgurts stands a man clapping his hands,
probably the leader and time-giver of the song of the workmen, whose
task was facilitated by rhythmical movement. To this day in Egypt and
elsewhere the same custom is obaerved wherever the strength of many men
is united in some common exertion, as in the sailor's chant in raising
the anchor or hoisting sail. A man facing the timtrkaeper knocks two
wooden stamps together, obviously to transmit the 1proper time to these
too far off to hear distinctly the hand-clapping 0 the leader. On the
prow of the sled, behind the rings to which the ropes are fastened, stands
a man pouring water on the ground to prevent the heavily loaded sled
from taking fire by friction. Mrattsr-isarritsrs stand ready to rtyil11 the empty

itchar. These are followed by other labourers bearing notched beams,
or laying under the sledge when necessary. Three bailiffs or stewards,
with sticks, are each attended by four men, who eeem from their simple
costume to be foreman, stone-masons, or extra-hands, At the top are
depicted seven we1rsquipptsd companies of infantry, marching in stiff
military order towards the advancing colossus. The btiieerg bear tridents
resembling those in the usual representations of Neptune, which may
either have been used as fuli1-atandards or for driving the cowardly
into action.

This highly instructive representation shows, among other points,
how unlimited was the authority of the nomerch over the people of his
name and how freely, not to say extravagantly, he could ll ply human
labour in effecting his ends. One is tempted to pity the corv e labourers
and to forget how ends which seem petty or even obnoxious to one
generation may have seemed to their ancestors worthy of an unlimited
expenditure of time, blood, and wealth. In the time of the pyramid-
huilding 12th Dynasty it was accounted a. noble and reputable thing to
erect the hugeet and most durable monuments. The mass of the people,
who seem to have regarded the might of their oppreseors in the same
light as we regard the workings of destiny, were proud to have had a
share in the erection of any specially important monument. Similar
considerations are suggested by scenes in the tombs of the pyramids, and
the inscription accompanying the turoveu1emsribed pieture givee us chapter
and verse for the accuracy of this view. It runs as follows:'Transport
of the thirteemell statue made of stone from Hatnub. Behold, the way
by which it was to be transported was of extraordinary diffteu1ty. Truly
diff1eu1t was also the toil of the people in drawing the mighty mass along
it, in dragging (the colossus) in hewn stone. I ordered the hands of young
men to march and prepare the way for it, with waVhmen, carpenters,
end so forth. The most important were among them. The order was
issued that men of a atrOng arm should go forth to fetch'it. My heart
was full of content, and my fe11ow-eitiztyns all rejoiced. The scene was
extremely beautiful to witness; the old man leans on the youth, the
etrong withstood the weak-hearted and timid. They thus became so strong
that each one. effected as much as a thousand. And ts h ue
