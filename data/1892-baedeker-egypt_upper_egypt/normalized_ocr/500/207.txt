by eight columns in two rows with ealyx-eapitals, This was at least
adorned, if not built, by Ramses XIII.; while the door bears the
cartouche of Nekhnebt'l. The adyx-capitahs are comparatively low,
and their edges are bent out to a remarkable extent. Beyond this
hall are the rooms of the Sanctuary. Here, especially in the rooms
to the E., are a series of deeply carved inscriptions, some of which
are of great seientitle importance though of little general interest.
Ramses IV. (Hal; m5) and Ramses XIII. occur here, and several
Ptolemaic princes have carved their names. Various Greeks, of

placed beside representations, of foot-prints (indicating that they

V. The Small Temple of Apet.

The Temple of Apet (Pl. W), once occupied by Champollion as
a dwelling, lies close to the W. wall of the temple of Khunsu. It
is now used as a depository for the smaller monuments found at
Karnak, the best of which are periodically transferred to the Egyp-
