proposes to recognize in this the name, not of the builder of the inner
chambers, but of Darius I. (521-486 13.0.); but as this king is expressly
styled the'beloved of Ammon Ba, lord of Hih, strong with the aword',
he is doubtless to be identified with Darius IL who is mentioned within
the temple. Beneath, Darius, accompanied by Hathor with a sietmm and
year-rings, otters to Amman Ra, lord of the thrones of both the lands of

H, Brugeeh has proved from an inscription found at Luxor (Stele
Meunier), of the 25th year of Pinozem I. (1033 13.0.), that the oasis was
used from an early period as a place of banishment, In Christian times
the gehismatie Nestorius (435 A.DO was banished hither (p. 50). Christian
monks settled here, protecting themselves against the attacks of the Ben
duins from a place of refuge 0n the top of the temple, traces of which
were seen by Hoskine.

At Nadurah, a little to the SE. of the great temple, are the ruins of
a temple of the Roman period, i) paces long by 12 broad. It has three
doors, above the central and more carefully built of which its the winged
eun-disc. Within the little building is Joand the name of the emperor
Antoninw, which also occurs at Kagr ezWapdn (see below). He is here eaid
to conduct to the god the land of Run or Run with its possessions and
the W. land with its wines. On the outside are a few Coptic names.

Fully an hour to the N. of the town of Khttrgeh, 1/4 hr. from the
great temple, lies the extensive Christian Weeropolis, resembling a city
with its regularly laid out streets, but now utterly devastated, At the
most only a few mortuary chapels are worth visiting. Some of the smaller
of these may have been the mausolea of particular families, but the larger
were probably sepulehral chapels in which religious services were held
in memory of the dead, About 1/4 hr. to the N.W. of the necropolis is
Kagr Mugtafah Desk, an ancient Christian monastery, built entirely of brick
except the main portal, which is of he'wn stoae. To the N, of it is a
Hypogeum, 38 ft. long by di, ft, broad, with three chambers on each side.

About 211m. to the S. of Irhiirgeh is the little village of Genndh, with
250 inhabitants. The houses are covered with branches of the orange-tree
and pomegranate-tree in place of roofs. The streets are so narrow as to
make it ditTtimit for a laden camel to pass through them, About 1% hr.
from the village are the ruins of a temgle, dating from the time of the
Ptolemies (Energetes, Philopator, and athyrus), and dedicated to the
Tlushaa triad, Ammon-Ra, Muth, and Khunau. The ruins, rettily situated
on a hill, are now known as Kan Gattah or Kay Walt (Srewinge of it,
see Hoskins, plates xwrxrx, ind Caillieud, pi. xxv). About 18li' hr. fur-
ther is the picturesque ruin of Kagr'Ain ez~Zaydn, a temple, enclosed by
a rough brick wall, 230 ft. long and 83 ft. broad, The entrance is on the
S. aide. Within the wail is a kind of court, of unburnt bricks, 50ft.
long and 17 ft. broad, at the approach to which are fragments of stone
with part of a Greek inscription. In this court is situated the temple,
13 ft,, from the girdltrwtsl1, and entered through a pylon, "ft. bread, with
the winged sun-disc, facing the S. The doorway, which is 41/2 ft. wide,
