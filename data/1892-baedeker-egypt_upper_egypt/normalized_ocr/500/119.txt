The names of the three kings and their pyramids were found in the
inscriptions to the right and left of the entrance (outside). The
tomb is in the form of a rectangle, with the mummy-shaft open-
ing in the back-wall. The representation of Atkhenu, to the left
of the entrance, is very lifelike and derives peculiar interest from
the fact that the grandees of the early period are seldom represented,
as here, in full military activity. Our hero, another Una (see
Baedeker's Lower Egypt, p. 307), lifts the arm vigorously to strike
his foe, The mode of wearing the hair and headdress, seen both
in this figure gnil that of Atkhem1's wife, is unusual. Atkhenu was
a rich man, possessing, aeeording to the inscriptions, 2350 oxen.
On the left side of the rear-wall are represented several scenes from
the private life of the deceased. Cattle are being slaughtered, cooks
are busy at their work, etc. Above the door leading to the mummy-
shaft we see a large altar, adjoining which is a long but much damn
aged inscription. -MaM= The smaller tombs in the vicinity are less
interesting. Several Coptic inscriptions testify that enohorites found
retreats in these tombs during the Christian period. We are now
approaching the region which, in the time of Paehornir1s, was most
thickly populated with monks and anchorites.

Farther on we pass a tine mountain-mass, which looks especially
imposing by afternoon light, and see several thriving villages, often
situated close to the river. Deshneh, a tsteamboat-station on the
N. bank, i3 M. from Keel: tsy4i.hOirii, is situated on the ruins of an
ancient town. F

Thelaite of the celebrated Tabenna, which lay between H611 (Diaspo-
lia) and Denderah (Tentyn), must be sought for either here or close to
Keneh. It belonged to the name of Tentym and its Coptic name was
Tabenneseh which may be translated'place of the Ilia palms'. The Greeks
supposed that'nest' meant mcoc (neson) 0r island, and hence it comes that
the town of Tabenneauc, situated on the mainland, is generally spoken of as
the Island of Tahenna, It is said that the Arabs name it Gcztrct ttt-t7harly
or Isle of the West, but no support of this could be found on the spot.
St. Jerome relates that at the end of the 4th cent. no fewer than
50,000 monks, assembled in the district of Tabennesua to celebrate the
Easter Festival. All of these followed the rule of Pachomiua and be-
longed either to the chief monastery (Monasterium Maine)'pr to the
smaller emnobia, laurae, and anehorite cells dependent on it,, It is mar-
velioua that the temple of Denderah (p. 80), so close to this community
of fanatics. should have been left almost intact. Perhapa the explanation
is that at the time the monks settled here the strife about dogmas aroused
much more excitement in the ecclesiastical breast than the dislike of
heathen goo that had long sinee become harmless.

56 M,, (17 M,, from Deshneh) genoh (steamer-station), a town
with 15,400 inhab., lies on the E. bank of the Nile at the point where
the river, suddenly abandoning its northward course, turns to theW.,
almost at right angles. It is the capital of the tlfth Mudiriyeh of
Upper Egypt, which is 597 sq. M. in extent and contains a population
of406,858. The Greek name of the town was Kawhno K,' wn'.
