int year, on the 10th Epiphi, in the reign of His Meieety etc.... Ramses-
Miamun, who loves the Nile, the father of the gods, his creator. Long
may he live, possessing tirmnegg and might, eternally. Long live the
beneiieent god, the Nile that loves the primeval waters (Nun), the father
of the gods, who form the cycle of the nine deities, which belong to the
floods, the blessing, the abundance, the support of Egypt, who blesses
all the world with life by his rich abundance, who is dignified in his
course and distributes blessings with his fingers. The elect are rejoiced
at his approach. Thou art one that heat created thyself, and no man
knows whence thou art. On the day that thou eomeet out of thy sur-
roundings, all the world rejoices. Thou art 9. lord of many fuhes and
gifts, who bestoweet nourishment upon Egypt. Even the nine deities
know not whence thou art. Thou art their life, Therefore when thou
approachest they redouble their offerings; they furnish the altars richly
and raise their voices in exultation when thou appearest. Thou metest
rich measure to us, to nourish the elect, like Ra when he ruled this land Â»
Strong and wakeful is he at all times, to seek nourishment for the living,
to make the corn abundant like the sand of the seashore, and to load
the granaries with gifts. Behold, therefore His Majesty seught how he
might exalt the father of all gods, the prince and ruler of the flood, and
meditated like the god Tehuti (Thoth) to find out what was adequate to
his love (Le. how he might give most adequate expression to his love).
No king has done BO since thy time, Oh Ra! And His Majesty spoke:
'Whereas, the Nile nourishes, the world, and blessing and abundance
follow upon his rising, and behold each one lives in his dwelling, enriched
through his command; and seeing that I know what stands in the book-
store that is preserved in the library; therefore when the Nile comes
forth from his two sources, then let the offerings to the gods be iw.

creased; but if the holy stream is at Silsileh, Khennu-t),

at the right time, King Ramses II. will redouble the offerings to it there'.

This king appointed two festivals to be kept at Sileileh in honour
of the Nile, as the following portion of the inscription records. One was
to be observed at the beginning of its gradual rise (the 15th Epiphi), the
other on the 15th Thoth, when the rapid rise set in. L. Stern compares
these appropriately to the two main festivals of the modern Egyptians,
the Night of the Drop, and the Cutting ofthe Dam, which are also two months
apart (Vol. L, p. 239). Merenptah I. and Ramses m. eonfirmed the grants,
made by Remees II. for the purposes of these festivals, and erected the above-
mentioned eteles in commemoration of the fact. The nature of the grants
(saerifieisl bread and cakes, antelopee, beef, veal, six kinds of wine,
honey, oil, beer, milk, essences, etc.) is recorded in the lists below the
inscriptions, from which we also learn that the king offered fowls to the
river-gode and ae much corn as a. granary could contain to Amman of
Thebes. -.. The side-Walls of the two chapels are also occupied with
scenes of taaerifiee and worship.

Various opinions have been expressed as to the reason of the
special reverence paid to the Nile at this particular ilef0e. The
narrows of Silsileh were perhaps diffiealt or even impossible to
pass in earliest antiquity, and so probably came to be regarded as
the second entrance of the river into Egypt, the first being at the
cataract at Assaiin,, This is the more probable as K (irn Ombo was
certainly reckoned as belonging to Nubia.

Between the above-mentioned chapels of Ramses If. and Meretro,
ptah, is a small Stale erected by the mayor Panehesi (p. 257), who
appears here along with a. son of the king accompanying the king
before Ammon, The prayer is addressed not only to Ammon, but
also to the'holy water' (mu ab, see-above) and to th -t'l; d S h k.
