Shae'Abd el-lrurnah.'L'HEBES. 18. Route. 191

the sides of the first and third were placed niches of which only one (on
the left ] is preserved in the first hall, and three in the third. There is a
wide passage between halls 1 and 2. The third hall is adjoined by a
fourth smaller room. On the left of the entrance is 2r/urern-lyit offering
a prayer to Ra with uplifted hands. In the niche to the left two statues
of Ehtsypsvnyiit and his relative, Imhotep, the treasurer (the neighbouring
tomb 121 belonged to an Imhotep). On the right of the entrance is the
deceased offering two dishes with two geese in each. On the left are four
series; in the two upper, fowling scenes; below the king driving a four-
horse chariot, and in the lowest, harvest scenes. A flute player encourages
the reapers. On the inner wall to the left Kha-em-hiit presents a. report on



the harvest to King Amenhotep m. sitting beneath

a. canopy. The nine captive tribes, at the out o the canopy, among whom
are Greeks (Hanebu), should be noticed. On the right again the deceased
with a peculiar headdress delivers to the king the harvest report -of the
year 80. Behind him are two rows of his ofiieia1s in humble attitude.
The chess-board decoration of the ceiling is peculiar. In the entrance to
the second hall on the right, there is a long 16 column inscription of
deeplyecut hieroglyphics. In the second hail are eeveral chapters of the
Book of the Dead (110, 112). The sides of the third hall are destroyed,
the fourth was entirely without inscriptions.

To the right at no great distance is a. tomb firgt opened in 1882
(now No. 118), known as Stuart's Tomb from its discoverer Villiers
Stuart. 1t belonged to Ramses, a mayor (mar nut zet) and his sister
Ptahmerit, of the time of Amenhotep I'VE, the eun-worshipper, who,
as Khu~en-aten (splendour of the sun) removed his residence to
Tell el-Amameh (see p. 22). Here as there the sun is represented
with his rays spread out as hands protecting the king and queen.
Proceeding a little farther to the N., we soon reach the tomb of
Nekht (No, 125), t1rat opened in 1889 (the door unlocked on Te-
quest) with representations of fowling, wine-pressing, oter, the
drawing is rough but the colours fresh and well preserved. We then
climb the somewhat steep hill and, passing the richly decorated tomb
(No. 119) of Amenuser, who lived under Tutmes 111., come to
that marked No. 35, irhanuateldttn, by Wilkinson, at one time
considered the most worth visiting of all. It consists of a vestibule,
and a large chamber from the centre of which an unusually long
passage of remarkable and gradually increasing height runs into the
rock. It was laid out by a prince, governor, etc., named Rtsk1v-mvrii,
who died in the time ofAmenhotep IL, the successor of Tutmes 111.,
when the tributes of Asia were flowing into Egypt in exceptional
abundance, to the benefit of the relations and favourites of the royal
family.'

The pictorial decoration of the walls can now be scarcely seen, and
can be much better studied in the works of Wilkinson and Hoekine
(Ethiopia). The tomb eerved. es the abode of old Eue√©n Berlin, the 001m
ganion of Harris and Lepsius, and is a convenient room for luncheon.

he opportunity eheuld be taken of looking at the faded paintings of the
left corridor, and of the, passage into the rock. They represent payment
of tribute by the Ethiopians (Punt, Kefa) and Asiatics (Eetennu), various
kinds of work such as briek-mtsking for building, pottery, carpentry,
joinery, gltustrm1owing, carving and polishing of statues, and a company
of mourners with hampers and women playing mty, s,,, i: ,fi, t, s,1, ing
