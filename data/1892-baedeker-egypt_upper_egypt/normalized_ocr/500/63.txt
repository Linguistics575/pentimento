18 Route 1. BENIHASAN. From Cairo

here, as it were, the advance guard of the invasion of the Hykeoe,
towards the end of the 12th Dynasty. The Hyksos, named'Ama'
in an inscription in the neighbouring Specs Artemidos (p. li), con-
sisted of isolated tribes, who purchased permission to enter Egypt
by tribute, crossed its boundaries, and finally penetrated to the in-,
terior. The chief Aheha here bows before the Egyptian; hie suc-
cessors carried things with a high hand and bent the Egyptians
under their yoke. -_ The f1ook of ostriohee behind the last Amu
belongs to the series of pictures on the left side of the wall, re-
presenting Khnumhotep, accompanied by his dogs, slaying wild
beasts with bow and arrows. Below is a fioek of geese and e fowl-,
ing-scene. In the second row from the foot are bulls ilghting and
scenes of cattlewtending.

The S. Wall (to the right) is occupied by processions of servants
bringing gifts for the dead, a frequent subject in these represents-
tions, and the offering of animals in gaerifhye, Before one altar is
the figure of Khnumhotep, before another his wife Khuti, daughter
of Pent.

The traveller will find many of the above scenes now defaced
beyond recognition, but he should not let this deter him from walk-
ing a little farther to the S. and entering some of the other tombs.
That of Kheti, one of the nearest (No, 7), easily recognised by the
three pairs of columns supporting the roof, contains interesting,
tho ugh hu1f-obliterued representations of the innumerable gymnastic
and fencing exercises and games of the ancient Egyptians. Girls
are seen throwing the ball from one to another, and men ponder
carefully over a game of draughte. The Hunting Scenes are of
linguistic value, as the names of the different animals are written
above them. Among these was a stag, now totally efraeed, Mechan-
ics are depicted at work here and elsewhere. m- Travellers who see
the tombs of the new kingdom at Thebes, after having visited the
graves of Benihasan, will he astonished at the vastness of the im-
preeeion made upon the life and sentiment of the Egyptians by the
Hyksos period. At Benihasan everything recalls the tombs in the
Pyramids, and the subjects of representation are drawn wholly from
this earth; under the New Empire scenes of the future life and re-
presentations of the gods are also given. We should also notice that
the horse, so common in later times, never appears under the early
empire. The forms of the columns, including the beautiful lotus capi-
tals (see Baedeker'g Lower Egypt, p. 164), are of the greatest inter-
est. The proto-Dorie column is seen here in all stages of development.
The plain pillar, the octagonal pillar, the octagonal and sixteen-
sided columns, with and without flutes, all occur at Benihesan side
by gide and may he looked upon as practical illustrations of the
section upon the Cavern Building of the Egyptians in the intro-
duction to Lower Egypt (p. 160).
