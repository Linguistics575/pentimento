(Ceilliaud; Rohlf's return journey). Sohtsg, Girgeh, and Eeneh are the
preferable tstarting-points, as they are towns of same size where the
necessary number of camels is easily obtained,, About 40 hrs. are re~
quired from Mhsig or Girgeh; while 50-52 are required from Eeneh, be-
cause the road leads ehiefly ever rocky soil, and is therefore more
exhausting for the camels. Camels, water, provisions, fire-arms, etc. must
be provided as mentioned on p. M3.

This oasis was visited by Poneet in 1890, by Browne in 1793, and in
the present century by Cailliaud (1818), Drevetti (1882), Hoekins (1835) z
P. W. Grey (1843), Rohlfs, with Zittel, Jordan, Ascherson, and Remelc
(1874), and Bmgsch (1875). The excellent photographs taken by Remelé
have contributed largely to our knowledge of the temple of e1-Ehihgeh,

The oasis of el-Khhrgeh (the outer, in contrast to Dikhileh, the
inner, Le. farther into the desert) is named Konem in the inscription at
Edfu referring to the eases, while in an older inscription in the tomb

Like all the oases el-Ehtsrgeh is surrounded by e tolerably steep
ehain of eretaeioue limestone hills, which rises in terraces tn the height
of 1475 ft. on the side next the desert, and sinks down again towards
the oasis (Ktstabathmus, descent). The oasis stretches from N, to S. for
about 90 M. (M hrs. travel), and from E, to W. only 12 M. (4-5 hrs.),
and its population was estimated by Schweinfurth at 6340. The natives
who pay an annual tribute of800 purses (500 piastres or 1043. each), or 15601.,
to the Egyptian government, are of a dark complexion and are far from
good looking. Every summer they are subject to an intermittent fever,
which is fatal to many. They speak Arabic though they are not pure
felliWin from the Nile hat are mixed with the Libyan race. The oasis is
ruled by an Egyptian governor (Hakim). The chief town el-Khdrgeh has
about 3000 inhabitants. thannah and Baldt, to the s., have each about Mo,
Bérys Boo, Dash and Hats each 100, according to the moderate estimates
of Ceilliaud .--There are about 150 springs in the oasis, most of them
issuing freely from clefts in the cretaceous marl. Several were diswvered
by boring, and in this way the fertility of the oasis was increased. Some
of them are warm (88°-97° F.) and are strongly impregnated with iron.
The chief wealth of the oasis consists in its date-palms, 65,000in number.

The town of el-eh-s lies in lat. 25° 56' N., and long. 30° 40' E.
of Greenwich, at a height of about 245 ft. above the sets-level (Esneh
845 ft). The chief object of interest is the temple lying a full hour to
the NE. of the town. Immediately on quitting the brick wall that
encircles the town, we see on the right the domed tombs of some Arab
shékhs. Our route leads past some enclosed palm-groves end creases
some dry watercourses. The ruins of the small building like a temple,
but destitute of hieroglyphics, which Caillieud discovered half-way be-
tween the town and the large temple, seem now to have disappeared, as
has also a. still smaller building with a sunk doorway to the S. of the
temple.

The Large Temple of ei-Khiirgeh, 150 ft. long and about Bo ft. broad,
is a well-preeerved structure built of a reddish sandstone, which Zittel
believes to have been quarried in Lower Nubia. Its axis runs E. and w.,
with a slight inclination to the N. In front of the temple is a fore-eourt
and three successive gateways at irregular distances. Remains of both
the wings of the outermost gateway are left. On the rig' the
