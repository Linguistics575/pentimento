the Laboratory, in which was prepared the excellent incense known
as Kyphi, which must have been used in great quantities for the
services of the gods. The names and the proportionate quantities
(in"tigurais) of the drugs used in its preparation are recorded on the
door-posts, The interior has no inscriptions. The other (entered

the'eacred ibis of Philea' and thus placed entirely on an equality with
