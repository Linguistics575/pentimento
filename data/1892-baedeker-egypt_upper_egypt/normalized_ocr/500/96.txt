"the tmove-mentioned Greek iruusription informs us, to the old
temple of Pan, who is here represented in an ithyphallic form. Ala
most all the inscriptions are rapidly becoming effaced, and the same
fate is overtaking a circle divided into twelve parts and supposed to
be intended for the Zodiac. 0f the second temple of Khemmis,
which Herodotus describes as dedicated to Perseus, the only re-
mains are a few stones of the 18th Dynasty and some scanty frag-
ments of a building of the Ptolemeic and Roman period. These are
reached by the water when the Nile overflows its banks, and are
gradually being swept away.

In 1884 Maapero discovered an extensive NeeeopRit adjoining a Coptic
monastery among the mountains to the N.E. of Akhmim. Thousands of
mummies have been taken thence and some of them were sent to Europe.
A visit to this necropolia is well worth undertaking. The best plan is
to secure the company of Ehatit-8akkar, keeper of the Egyptian Museum,
and ride with him to the N.E., in the dirdetion of the mountains. On
a hill beyond the village of Ph hr.) erdrateaieheh we see the deserted Coptic
monastery, round which, in a wide circle, lie the tombs, now mostly
destroyed. They date from the 6th Dynasty (Pepiseneb, Khemankhteta,
Ankhu, etc.) down to the Greek and Roman period. The grave of Tutu,
son of Sit aere (daughter of Osiris), with liturgical inscriptions, is well
preserved (1885). Most of the mummies found here were in good preser-
vation, and many contained rolls of papyrus. Among them were many
priests (it) end priestesees (eh?) of Khem, whose genealogies are carried
up for eight or ten generations.

The town of Akhmim has now become the seat of an active
trade in mummies. Objects of considerable interest and value may
often be obtained from the dealers in antiquities, but relic-hunters
should not try to make purchases in the presence of the keeper of
the museum.

Continuing our journey up the Nile, we soon see, close to the
E. bank, a conspicuous eonvent-village, resembling a fortress. On
account of its whitewashed walls the sailors call it Diir el-Abyagl,
a name that properly belongs to the monastery mentioned at p. 49,
which lies much farther to the W. About 50 men, women, and
children occupy the convent, which has little of a religious cha-
racter in its mode of life. The pretty little church, built of light
and dark bricks, is lighted by cupolas, the largest of which ts above
the nave. The nave is separated from the aisles by wooden screens.
The HÃ©kel, or Holy of Holies, at the E. end, is carefully enclosed.
1n the nave, below the dome, stands the reading-desk of the priests,
and at the W. end of the church, separated from the priests, are
the seats for the laity. The paintings are wretched, and there are
no old MSS. I but the church is an excellent specimen of a Coptic
place of worship and is worth visiting, especially as it is only
5 min. walk from the river. The monks are very obligiug and are
grateful for a small donation (1 fr., is., or more) ,--Thoma, which
was occupied by a Roman garrison, must have lain in this neigh-
bourhood.
