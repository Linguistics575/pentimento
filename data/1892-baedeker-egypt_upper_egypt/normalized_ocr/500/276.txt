occupied by a continuous representation of the vault of heaven,
embraced by the long extended tlgars of Nut, with the twelve hours
of the day (OD) and those of the night (R), At the end are two ce-
lestial charts, and tables of the culmination of stars during the
hours of night, from fortnight to fortnight throughout the year. (Si-
milar tables are found in Tomb 60 The results are arranged on the
different parts of a human figure, Biot, the French astronomer,
used these tables in calculating the date of their formation .---- IV.
First small anteehamber, To the left: picture of the serpent Kheti,

Chap. 125 of the Book of the Dead, B-MN *IX. Room, a large hall, of
which the corner pillars remain 1udinished, The sareophagus placed
in the centre is destroyed. On the pillars appears the king praying
to various gods. This has been called the Hall of' Astronomy, _|on
account of the representations on the roof, which have been executed
with the greatest skill and with incredible labour and trouble. We
here see, twice, the goddess Nut, with stars and gods, who sail in
beats on the lake of the heavens, The deities of the hours also
appear, with curious symbols beside them. Next the entrance is the
sky by day, towards the back wall, the sky by night. The imag'w

On the long wall to the right, above, are the Hours, looking
behind them, and each casting on the one preceding a ray from
the disc on her head. Then follow the most varied forms of
the light-god, the solarwdisc, the stars, eta; and finally an inter-
