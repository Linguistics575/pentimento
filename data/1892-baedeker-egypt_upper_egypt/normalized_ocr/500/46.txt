4th Dyn, was buried, as in the neighbouring tombs persona related to him
are interred.

The Haggai )" of Iédhm, which were opened by Mariette, lie to the
N. of the pyramid. These were the tombs of the relations of Snefru
(4th Dyn.), end in many respects resemble the meuaolea of Sahhireh which
bear the same name. The fegedee of the most Important of them are
partly uncovered. The street of tombs, which is now accessible, pre-
sents the appearance of ehill-eide covered with masonry, incmeted with
stucco, and provided with ante-chambers. The mouth of each tomb is
towards the E.; the leaning external walls are generally of Nile bricks,
richly embellished with the linear patterns which afterwards formed the
favourite decorations of the sides of the semephegi (which were imi-
tations of the tomtr-ftrpBdeO. The vestibule fs in most cases compare »
tively large, bat the inner cnrridors are narrow, slope downwards, and
are covered with representations in a remarkably simple and antiquated
style. The archaic character of the scenes and of the tdisroglrphies
proves the great antiquity of these monuments. The tnfhumee of the
hieratie canon is already traceable here, but it does not appear- to have
hampered the efforts of the artists as much as it did at B later age. The
admirably preserved colours are also less conventional then those seen in
later monuments.

The first Open tomb which we reach from the 8., was that of Prince

gSh
(Erpa Ha) Nefemdt, who lived in the reign of King Tete. (There

were 3 kings of this name, in the Ist, hd, and 6th Dfiut, s. On the left
wall of the corridor leading to the tomb-ehember, we see the deceased
in a sitting posture, and on the right wall he is represented standing,
with his wife behind him. Adjacent are men and women presenting
omsrinp, es in the maetabes of Ti and Ptahhotep. The flesh-tint of the men
is red, and that of the women pale yellow, and thia circumstance, especi-
ally in a monument of this early period, is important as tending to
prove the Asiatic origin of the Egyptian nobles,, The features of the
persona represented are of the Caucasian, and not of the Ethiopian
type, Among the villages belonging to Nefermtst, which offered gifts,

there appears on the left the name of the district of 1) c==s +

mm C) tie.'Metun of the cattle'. Metun is the oldest form of

the name Mtdilm, me the neck of the ox, which represents the victim,
flows a black stream of blood. On the right side we find among others
a district named that'of the white sow', which proves that pigs were reared.
in Egypt as early as the time of Snefru. The pig in this group is very

true to nature:': iiiiiii', r% t, In the name of the district Hat en Eek,

or'place of the ploughing', the meet ancient form of the plough is weed
as a. determinative symbol. The advanced condition of industrial pur-
suite, showing that the Egyptians already practised the art in which,
according to Pliny, they afterwards excelled, is proved by the character
of the dress worn by the women represented on the right side of the
firgt passage, consisting of blnck and white cotton stuff, with pleasing
patterns on the borders. He tells us that they were not in the habit of
painting the materials for their dress, but of dipping them in certain
fluids They were coloured with boiling dyes, and came out impressed
with a pattern. Although the boilers contained one colour only, it is
said to have imparted several different tints to the stuffs dyed in them.
-MTF In order to impart a. durable colour to the larger flgures represented
here, an entirely unique process was employed. The outlines were en-
graved on the stone, while the surfaces enclosed by them were divided
into deeply incised squares, which were filled with emcee of different
colours, the flesh-tint of the men being red, that of the women yellow,
and the colour of the robes being white, etc.
