mighty prince both in war' and peace, wee apione worshipper of Ammon,
whose name, indeed, forms part of his own (Amen-hotep). Amenhotep 1V.,
on the other hand, turned his back on his father's religion and on the in-
creasingly spiritual conception of Ammon (the'Hidden One') and the other
ancient gods, discarded his name'Peace of Ammon', became exclusively
a'san-worshippers and named himself Khu-en-eten, Le.'Reflsstion of the
Suis Dise'g It is an interesting but doubtful question whether Amenhe-
phis IV., in his rt" rlts of reformer, intended to resuscitate, as'a patriotic
resterer of the old, cult", the simple trt1prworship from which the religion
of the Egyptians had originally taken its rise; or whether he was moved
by the Semitic'ihfluenees, Which are so noticeable all over the country
after the, expulsion of the Hyksos, to become an adore: of the orb of day
and to introduce a. religious ceremonial that recalled the practices of the
Asiatic courts rather than the more dig, nifui1 usages of the'Sublime Forte"
of Egypt. Portraits of historical personages often cast a clearer light on
their character than piles of written documents, and the numerous re'
presentations of Amenhetep IV. encountened in these tombs show that he
was a sickly man, e fanatic, and an enthusiast. [ The portrait-sit; of
him in the Louvre" suggests similar conclusion" He also, as the in-
scriptions inform us, stood under the iniluenee of his mother, who was
not of royal birth and seems to have encouraged her son's tendency to
prefer the old popular religion to the elaborately developed creed of the
priests. His work was distinctly reactionary and could not long survive
him, Almost everywhere we see his successors tseratehing out his name as
a sign of their disapproval and contempt. Where it still stands intact we
may couclude that it was overlooked. The fact that the portrait-like
reliefs of men in these tombs, as well as the horses and buildings, appear
more true to nature than in any other Egyptian monument may he due
to the greater liberty of divergence from the hieratic canon allowed in a
reign which was so unfavourable to the priestly dogmas. These reliefs
excited the special admiration of the Greeks. A Hellene who visited them
inscribed his name as admiring the art of the priestly stone-cutters
ttit?, (hwsmit: u.w'rdh tepu'iv leet√©emv). Besides the palaces and tombs
of Te 1 el-Amamah, Khu-en~aten also built a large Benben or temple at
Thebes, the blocks of which were used for the pylon of King Horus. He
also erected a temple in Heliopolis, the remains of which are still extant,
md-prohably another in Memphis. He is himself depicted on a pylon in
Soleb (Nubia).'.'

Quite recently anew light has fallen on the history of Amenhotep IV.
and his predecessor through the discovery of several hundred tablets with
cuneiform inscriptions in the large Temple, or rather Palace, of Tell trr,
Amarnaht, which narrate the intercourse of the Kings of Babylon with
Amenhotep III. and Amenhotep IV, To the former King Dushratta. of Mi-
tanni gave his daughter Tadukhepa in marriage; and her dowry is stated
orromrof the tablets. Other tablets contain letters from Palestine and
Syrian vessels to the King of Egypt, and diplomatic notes from King
Burnaburiash to Amenhotep IV., concluding a treaty of peace and asking
for the hand of his daughter. Most of the tablets are now in the Asiatic
Mueeum at Berlin, but many are in the British Museum and a few
at Gizeh.

N, Group, The tombs in each group are marked with red
numbers, running from N, to 8. Most of the tombs are entered
from a small fore-eourt, and the doorways of many are adorned
with concave cornices. Thedoor leads into an oblong apartment,
communicating with a wide sepulchral chapel, with a small burial-
recess in the background. The ornamentation of the ceiling "

t Some authorities believe that these tablets were found in the tomb
of Amenhotep IV, (see above).'.
