the king sits between Khnum and Anuke, and in that on the left
between Horus, lord of Bek, and the cow-headed Isis. The colours
of these pictures are well-preserved. The doors to the little sanctuw
ary, which bore the name Rauserma sehotep neteru, Le.'Ramses
offering to the gods', and the sanctuary itself are decorated with
various inscriptions. The king, staff in hand, is conducted, on the
right by Sati, on the left by Maket, On the wall to the right of the
door, Anuke, mistress of Abu, offers her breast to the king, en the

left Isis, mistress of the land of Khent t=FFF" g tCh, does the

same. Each calls herself his mother. Isis says that she bestows
upon him firmness along with her milk, so that he is said to have
been destined from his motUr's breast to long life and mighty
deeds. [ Diodorus relates that Hephaestus appeared to the king's
father, announcing to him that the new-born babe would subdue
the whole world; and in the long inscription at Abydos Ramses is

consists of a handsome pylon end of the temple proper, supported
by two columns, about 30 ft, farther back. The pylon stands upon
