w. Works on Egypt.

A good selection of books is one of the necessities of the traveller
in Egypt. The steamer sometimes steems for an entire day without pass »
ing anything of special interest; and the dhtihaNyeh-travouer, when his
vessel is being slowly towed against an adverse wind, will gladly fall back
upon reading when he is tired of walking along the bank with a gun on
the chance of a shot. A coasiderable number of the chief books upon
Egypt have been mentioned in Vol, 1., pp.201,202, a few more are named
here; while other special works are referred to in the descri tious of some
of the principal monuments (e.wp.% ,95,% 4,255, ate). or authorities
