prefect Avidtus Heliodorm, the military commandant Septimim Macro and
the general (strategos) Paeniaa Gaepio. The celebrated rhetorician Aristides
came to Egypt in the prefecture of Heliodorua, who was a famous
orator. The tsntrtutea-portal admits to the flrtst hall, 28% ft. long by 191/2 ft.
broad, which is adjoined by the Sanctuary, 16 ft, by'Pls ft. A niche at the
back was probably intended for the statue of a god. To the W. of the

The village of BM (3400 inhab.) is only 11/2 hr. to the S. of liner err
Zayan, and 7 hrs. to the S. of m1ltst is the deserted village ofBaktiktn, A
route leads vii Hade ageh, with a good spring and fine date~palme and damn
palms, to Beeps (inhab.; 13 hrs. from BC11iW), situated on a hill, with
numerous date-palms and surrounded with fields of grain (ehieily dura),
abounding in springs. 2iTUfaks (100 inhab0, 3 hrs. farther is the most
southerly point in the oasis. The caraven-route leads hence in ik, days at Dar-
far. About halfway between Berys and Make, but a little to E. of the mad,
lies the temple of Dash eH, raraly, This temple also was once surrounded
with a high wall of unburned bricks, furnished 0n the inside with stairs
and galleries. Two propy1oms stand in front of the temple which faces
the N.; the first and larger of these is 143/4 ft. broad and 133/4 ft. long.
On the arehitrave of the portal is a Greek inscription (published by
Cuilliaud) of the 19th year of the emperor Trajan (116 NDO, in which
the inhabitants of Ettsis (oto'mo Tii; chsmcg comp. Rus, the above-men-
tioned hieroglyphic name of the oasis) record the building of this pylon,
under Marcus Rutiliue Lupus, prefect of Egypt. On the left wall of the
same pylon is another but hardly iieeiphtss'atsie Greek inscription in which
the name Ã©vt 115m. recurs. Behind the propylon are some remains of columns,
BO that e colonnaded gallery must be en osed to have existed between
the flrgt and second pylons, which are 1 ft. apart. The Second Pylon,
only 13ft. broad and 131/2 ft. long, is united hy a brick wall with the
girdle-wall. The poor sculptures u on it represent a king whose name
is not legible. About 38ft. farther aek is the temple proper, its first
portion being a kind of Vestibule, 0n the sides of which a Roman emperor
presents offerings to Serapis. Isis, and Home. The hieroglyphics, however,
are scarcely legible. This vestibule, with two columns at the entrance,
is only 22ft. broad and 133/4 ft. deep. Beyond it is a portieo with four
columns, the capitals of which are much damaged. A door in the right
(W.) wall seems to have led to a staircase. At the back of the portico
"is a large door between two smaller ones, the former leading into the
sanctuary which is divided into two chambers, the latter into corridors.
The method of lighting the sanctuary chambers by windows at the top of
the walls, like those in the great temple of Karnak, and the vaulted roof
should be noticed. Over the doors ap ears the winged sun-disc, and on
each side are hieroglyphies. The B. (geek) wall of the temple is also
covered with reliefs, one representing the emperor Domitian, sacrificing
to Horus, son of Isis, and to Osiris..

About 60 6115 from this temple are the ruins of another noteworthy
structure, wholly of brick, apparently also a. temple. The entrance is
formed by a pointed Gothic arch, and the three following chambers have
doors of the same form, on which the winged sun-diac is still to be seen.
Hoskina refers this building to the Romans. _
