Der et-bali" THEBES. 21. Route. 229

Straight on is a. room about 25 ft, long. Here on July 5th 1881 Emil
Bmgsch discovered the famous royal mummies, now in the Gtzeh Museum.
Since January 1876 Ushebtis, tablets, and large funereal papyrus rolls, all
coming from this spot, had been sold to wealthy tourists through the
medium of Mustapha Age, the English consular agent at Luxor. Attention
was aroused by the Papyrus of btemit, a queen of the 21st Dyer, which
was produced in several pieees, One of which is now'in the Louvre, another
in the British Museum, having been presented to the Prince of Wales, and
a third in the possession of a Bel ian lady. Enquiries showed that there
were several brothers'Abd er-Rag 1 who were especially concerned in the
gale of these anti uities. The arrest and trial of Ahmed, one of the
brothers, followed y flogging, led to no result. However partly from fear
trf punishment, and partly for e promised reward the secret was betrayed
by Ahmed's elder brother 1Koluymmed, to the Meat: pf Feneh, who gave
information to the Khedive. Brugseh describes the discovery as follows:

'Every inch of the subterranean passage was covered with Comm, and

antiquities of all kinds. My astonishment was so overpowering that I
scarcely knew whether' I was awake or whether it was only a mocking
dream. Resting on a isofftn, in order to recover from my intense excite-
ment, I mechanically east my eyes over the coma-lid, and distinctly saw
the name of King Beti A, the father of Ramses IL, both belonging to the
19th Dynasty, A few steps further on, in a simple wooden eoffln, with
his hands crossed pn his breast, lay Ramses 11., the great Besostris him-
self. The farther I advanced, the greater was the wealth displayed, here
cArmtnophtu L, there, Amomu, the three Tutmes, Queen Ahmes nofermri,
Queen Aahhotep, all the mummiee well preserved; in all 36 eoffing, belomr
ing to kings and their wives or to prineee Bad princesses.....
' By the evening of July 11th all the mummies and tytdftng had been
carefully packed at Luxor. Three days later the Museum steamer came
to carry the precious burdens to BitWc From Luxor to Koptes on both
sides of the Nile, the tputrtiin women followed the. boat with loosened
heir and uttering plaintive cries, while the men fired "guns, as at a
funeral. The eoflim, were taken to the museum at 361515, and thence
removed do the new museum at Gizeh. a-ttsr The discovery included King
Rasekenen, of the 17th Dyn., the opponent of the Hyksos; of the 18th Dyn.
King Aahmes, queens Aahmes nofertari and Aahhotep, kings Amenhotcp 1.,
Tarmac 1., 11., and IO,, prince Sitamon, princesses Sitamon and Men'-
tamon, Nebsem' a. priest, and others, of the 19th Dyn. Ramses A, Seti 1.,

daughter, a second Ptnozem, queen Hathorhontlaui, Masahirta a priest, two
yrincesses Asbem-kheb and Nesikhomd, and others. There were also found
a large leather tent in red, green, yellow, and white for Ast-sm-kheb, the
daughter of Jfing Pinonm, 40 canopi, 3700 statuettes of Osiris, 12 to 15
ceremonial wigs, and M wooden chests together with inscriptions, bronze
steels, papyrus rolls, and the like. The inscriptions found on the older
mummyschests, ta, that of Seti T, and en the wrappintps, were of great
importance, recording that the mummies had been taken from their temhe
by the priest-kings of the 2ist Dye. (Berber, Sitamon, Pinozem, and Ma-
sehirte the priest) and removed to that of a lady named An keb er Au
hepu, in which also lay Amenhotep L la the Abbott Papyrus which is a
judicial enquiry into the mhhery of the tombs the passage 120 e113 long
m the tomb of Amenhotep L, which wee to the k. of the temple of Amen-
hotep, is mentioned. This corresponds to the passage in the Dér el-behri
pit. The colours of the garlands of flowers were marvellously well
preserved. The plants have been named by Prof. Schweinfurth.

On June ist 1886 by the Wish of the Khedive the unrolling of the
mummies, a somewhat bold proceeding, was taken In hand, beginning with
the grey-hired Ramses the Great, whose sharp features and curved nose
tsrtrrersiarub1y striking. In the éothn of Nefertari the mummy of Ram-
mu III. was strangely found. Then followed Seti L with his mild features,
Basekenen with his fleree look and broken skull, havinggerhaps fallen in
battle with the Kheta, Ashmes 1., and the priest-kings of shes A mummy
