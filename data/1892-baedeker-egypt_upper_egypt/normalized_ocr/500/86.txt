' was probably situated near the modern eZ-Lahan (see below), the name of
which is supposed to be derived from the old Egyptian'Rehui or'Ltr.
hun', sic.'the mouth of the lake', and the site of which was probably
once occupied.hy the town of Ptolemei'a.

There is a difference of opinion M to the Situation and Form of' the
Ancient Lake. _ Linent-Bey, arguing from the eonaiderable difference of
level between the two lakes, maintains that the Birket eHruritn (Lake
of the Horns, p. M) could never have formed part of Lake Weris, as was
fermerly tsupposed, and he assigns to the letter emueh smaller area then
was attributed to it under the earlier theorr Placing it farther to the
Bah, nearer to the Labyrinth and eLLehiin, he makes its boundary-line
run towarda the S.S.W. of Medtnet tsrrmryirgi1 to the Birket el-Gharag, and
intersect the desert of Shékh Ayned, where the ancient height of the wa-
ter, which far exceeds the level attained in modern times, has left its
traces; it then leads to Kalamaha, turns to the N. to Dér, and then to
the E. and S.E. to Dimidlttaeh, follows the embankment of Piuawdneh,
and passes Edward el-lfabir and the bridge of el-than (see below). Hence the
boundary leads by Dimmo towards the 2Clil,, to Beleh, and thence to the W.
to Bthamtt (p. 38r, then again to the 8., and thus returns to Medinet er.
1? tsyitm .--A somewhat fatiguing journey of 2-8 days will enable the tmw
eller to complete this circuit of the bed of the lake, which is now dried
up. Recently, however, Mr. F.00pe Whitehouse, relying upon the great
circumference assigned by Herodetus (II, IN) ) to the lake, of 3600 studio.
(reduced by Linant to 360) or about 3315 M. (Pliny says 23031.), and upon
measurements made by himself on the spoh, ascribes a. considerably larger
area to the lake than Linant, and maintains that it extended on the S, ,W,,
to the Weidi Raglan. It is not improbable that in ancient times nearly the
whole of the I? ayihn could be laid under water, so that even the Birket
1tHpyri1st belonged to Lake Hmris, but that the entire system was meant
for the watering. of the Bayilm alone and net of the Nile valley or the
Delta. Considering that the bed of the lake must annually have been raised
by the deposit of Nile mud, it follows, that he soon as the raising of the
embankmeats and the removal of the mud were discontinued, the lake
must have become anservieeable, especially after the lock-gates at el-
Lahiln fell to decay, each opening of which, as Diodorus informs us,
cost 50 talents (tie. about 11,250l.O. The discharge of the tsuperfluous
water probably run through the Bahr Belts M51, which has already been
mentioned (p. 38), or through the Wiidi Nezleh (p. 42), both of which
fall into the Birket eHruri'ui, The ancient conjecture, that the latter
discharged part of its water into the Sahara (or, as Herodotus says, the
'Libyan Syrte'), was not an unnatural one.

A visit to the Pyramid of el-Latin or I11ahtrn is only interesting to
those who are desirous of convincing themselves of the truth of Linant's
hypothesis, and to make the circuit of the boundaries of the old bed of
the lake (see above). The pyramid, which is built of Nile bricks, may be
reached from Erawhret el-gaeah in 4-6, or from the Labyrinth in Td hours,
It has been recently been opened by Fraser. The discovery of en ele~
heater altar with the name of Usertesen II. readers it probable that the
gimmid was built by that monarch, A smaller pyramid lies to the RE.

e remains of the ancient emhenkmente, which were. tolerably well
preserved in the time of the Khelifs, are not without attraction. Those
who are'interested in hydraulic engineering should also inspect the en:
trance of the Baht Yii8uf into the Fayiim,

About'le M, to the E. of the pyramid of ertatim, Mr. Flindere Pee
trio discovered a. temple in 1889, and close beside it the ruins of the town
2la-traerteseewhotep, now called Kahun. The latter was founded by User-
tesen II. (12th Dyn.) for the labourers on his pyramid. Among the articles
found here were pottery, flint and copper implements of the 12th Dyn.,
numerous papyri of the same period, a etatuette of Si-Sehek (13th Dyno,
tb wooden stamp of Apepi and a large wooden door of Osorkon I.

Gurob, l'le H. to the .8.W. of 111ahiin and close to the edge of the
desert, owed its origin to Tutmes m., who built a. temple there. Many
of the inhabitants were foreigners. Mr. Petrie discovered shtrtr, o, ents
