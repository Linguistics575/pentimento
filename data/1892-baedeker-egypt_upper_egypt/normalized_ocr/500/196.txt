at Thebes. KARNAK. 11.1mm. 139

scanty relics of the earliest recognizable buildings of the temple of
the 12th Dynasty. Farther on, in the axis of the sanctuary, are two
square granite bases, one behind the other, being the relies of
sixteen-sided columns, with the name of Ueertesen I. A little
farther to the E, is the doorway of the'tWN9M+

Great Colonnade of Tutmes III. (P1. H). The reports of the mili-
tary success ofthis prince, which we have justperused, telling us of the
enormous wealth at his disyesal, and still more the reverence which
we see him paying to Ammon at every turn, prepare us to find in
this temple some important building reared by him to his divine
patron, The space to the W. of the ancient sanctuary had already
been occupied by the edifues of his ancestors, so that, as his new
building was also to maintain connection with the holy place, he
was forced to build on the site to the E. We have already seen
how, contrary to the usual custom, he provided the sacred granite-
chamber with a second doorway (opening to the E.). The form and
appearance of the courts and chambers that lay between the sene-
tuery and the eelpnnade cannet now be determined, for they have
been utterly destroyed. The ancient holy place built by the kings
of the 12th Dyn. was probably surrounded by two concentric walls,
separated by an archway or passage. The eolonnaded hall, which
we enter by the central door, is 144 ft. wide and 52ft. deep. The
roof was supported by 20 columns in two rows; while 32 square pil-
lars (14 at the sides, 4 at the ends) formed four galleries with the
wells of the hall. The pillars, though not so tell as the columns, were
of the same height as the walls, and with the latter supported the
roofirrg slabs. As the middle of the hall was also roofed, a small
wall, with sloping exterior and decorated with the astragal and con-
cave cornice, rose from the roof above the pillars and walls to the
height of the columns in the centre. There was thus formed a. kind
of eltsrestory, which was provided with rectangular windows, broader
than they were high, in order to admit light to the hall. The central
columns belong to a peculiar order, the various parts of which on
the shaft and capital were indicated only by painting, They have
received the name of'inverted ealyareapital8', because the bells or
calyees were placed inverted on the smooth shafts, which were
painted a dark red and adorned with vertical inscriptions, recalling
the similar decoration of the central panels of the fluted polygonal
columns. As the edge of the f1owtsr-ealrar rested. upon the end of the
shaft, the latter expanitei1 at the top, with some abruptness; and
the ennuli had in consequence to be placed somewhat low down
on the cylindrical shaft (below the beginning of the expansion),
to save them from the appearance of slipping down. The capitals
are adorned with eelyx- or mtmsh-p1ants, the tips of which, of course,
point downwards. In place of the fruit-germ, these inverted ea-
lyeee support somewhat lofty abeci, on which rests an arehitreve
adorned with fine hieroglyphies, The fourth abacus orrthg E. t_side
