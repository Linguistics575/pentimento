of the 18th Dym, viz O Rtrgekhettr8uaz-tati,

The tomb between the two 1agt-menkiontsirlielongs to a lady named & trekhi,
perhaps a wife of Bebe.

On the W. bank opposite el-EM, on a hill about 3 M. from the Nile,
are the partly destroyed reck-tomhs of Kbm ol-Ahmar CRed mli0, dating
from the time of Tutmes I. Landing at t7hemartyth, we precede thence
due E. through the field via. (20 min.) Moniadt. In 20 min, more we reach
Kdm el-Al'mrmr1 0n the site of the ancient town (mentioned by Strabo of
1lieraeonpoh'a (City of hawks'), Egypt. Kamhew, with the town Nekhen C)

-.\-
0r. The three hawks are Horus, Tuamutef, and Kebsenuf. A



hawk is also named in the tombs as a local god. The name of User-
tesen was not found on the heaps of rubbish in 1885 by Professor Eisen-
lohr. - About 1/; M. farther to the E. "begins the desert, and 1/1 M.
farther is the ancient Roman fort of St/tan, on which large vultures fre-
quently perch. In 20 min. more we begin to mount the hill with the
tombs. There are altogether eight tombs, of which only the flrgt to the
right (Tut) and the tirst to the left (Horames, chief priest of Hieraconpolis)
repay a visit. The former contains a. well-preserved Mele of the time
of Tutmes Lt outside the latter, to the right, daneing-girls were painted.
Not long ago three black granite statues were found here, with the names
of Kings Pepi (6th Dyn.), Ra-kha-kheper (Usertesen IL), and Ra-en-mat
(Amenemha 111., 12th Dyn.). These are now in the museum at Gizeh.
13% M. from tsl-Eta is Edfu, on the W. bank.

23. Edfu.

Edfu is a steamboat-statiOn. The Mail Steamers arriving on Tues, and
Frid. at 8.30 am. halt here for 21/2 hm; the Tourist Steamers spend a.
night here on their upwardjourney. Tourists on a three-weeks tour visit
the temple on the evening of their arrival (11th day, Erich): these on a
four-weeks tour visit it the next morning. Steamers do not Mop here
on the downward voyage. The halt of the mail-steamera gives hardly
time even for a hasty visit to the temple, especially as the latter lies

min. from the landing-place.

Those who travel in their own dhahabtyeh should spend two days at
Edfu, bringing their provisions from the boat to the temple. Egyptologists,
who may find material to occupy them here for days and weeks, will obtain,
if necessary, poor lodging and scanty fare in the Past House, tle H. to the
E. of the temple. TnseeHrowder should in this case not be forgotten;
and wine and preserved meat should he brought from Luxor.

Donkeys and horses are to be had at the 2; andlnrptaee, Camels may
also be obtained. Riders unaeeugtamed to the latter animals must be
careful not to fell forward when the camel kneels down.

The way to the temple leads almost due W. from the landing-
place, then, turning to the N. (right), skirts the Canal of Edfu and
crosses it by a. good new bridge. It then proceeds to the W. through
several streets and finally turns N,, again for a. short distance .--
Another route leads straight on from the landing-place, bends to
the right through fields, and than traverses the streets of the town
without crossing the canal.

A flight of steps descends to the massive Pylon: of the temple
(p. 249). As at Esneh (p, 232) the accumulated rubbi h f en-
