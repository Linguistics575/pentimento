An inscription (on the outside of the E. girdl-a10 states that
this beautiful monument (the present temple) lay behind cu, pro-
bably to the S. of) the building of his father; another (on the in-
side of the same wall) records that the foundation-stone was laid
in the time of Ptah in the holy place of Tee Hor for the God Ra;
and a third (on the inside of the N. girdle-wall) informs us (on the
left) that the building was carried out'as it was in the plan of the
great writing that fell from heaven to the N, of Memphis', and (on
the right) that'this great wall was built according to the book of
the arrangement of temples, written by the thrheb Imhotcp, son of

An inscription in one of the crypts at Denderah (Mariette III, 78) men-

Horus at Edfu. This festival, which was established by Tutmee III.
(1600 18.0.) took place at the new moon of the month Epiphi.

The Naos, still to be found in the holy of holies (p. 252), bears
the name-rings of Neetanehus l, (378-360 BC.) and probably
dates from the original temple. The document, inscribed on the
outside of the E. wall of the temple, relating to the gifts of lands,
mentions King Darius as well as Neetanebus l, and Neetanehus II.
as benefactors of the temple.

Two accounts of the building of the present temple have come
down to us. The shorter of these occurs on the outside of the W.
wall of the temple proper, in the second line of the lower marginal
inscription, dating from the time of Ptolemy IX. Euergetes IL;
tht other, "greater detail, in the one-line lower Marginal In-
scription, on the outside of the W. girdlts-ws11. In the second in-
eeription we read as follows:

'On this beautiful day of the opening of the building in the 10th year
(supplied from the shorter inscription), on the 7th Epiphi (Le. Aug. 23,

of the Sixth, when the interior of the ground was opened, the flrat of all
the festivals of the Sixth of the ceremony of laying the foundation.

The king himself, along with the goddess Safekh, was engaged in ful-

point for determining its hells. Its aide-ehemhers (were erected) in their
places, carefully arranged by the wise (ease). The sacred architects built
with the lord of the papyrus-writing. The great hall of the temple was

10th year, on the 7th Epiphi, in the reign of King Ptolemy IV. Mute,
pator" (a date corresponding to Aug. IT, 212 13.0.). Thus 25 yeers t237 13.0.
to 212 13.0.) were spent in erecting the wells of the temple.

The decoration of the walls with hieroglyphics and reliefs end the
completion of the great gateway and of the two dear: to one of the halls
are noted as follows:

'The inscribing of its walls with well-executed sculpture of the
names, the great ones, of His Majesty, and with the figures of the gods and
