remains of the ancient city, of the lake, and the desert. Each gate of this
curious building is surmounted by a winged disc of the sun; and over
the doors leading into the second and third rooms of the prosokos and
into the sanctuary, instead of the ordinary concave cornice, there is a
series of Urteus snakes, which, with their outstretched heads and bench
ing necks, together form a kind of cornice. The names of several trav-
ellers- are engraved on the stone of the Brat room, including those of Paul
Lucas, R. Peaceke, Jomard, Roux, d'Anviiie Coutelle, Bellier, Burton,
Belzoni, Hyde, and Paul Martin. Fatsr, iiiri'il, has also been visited by
Lepsium There are no ancient inscriptions remaining.

To the E. of the large temple are situated two smaller Roman temples,
in tolerable preservation, the larger of which, situated 300 paces from the
smaller, is not without interest. Its walls (18 ft, by 19 ft.) consist of
good burnt bricks, and its substructures of solid stone; the cells ter-
minates in a niche resembling an apse; on each of the side-walls are
two half-columns, which, as the fragments lying on the ground show,
belong to the Ionic order. There are also some less important ruins
covering an extensive area, but nothing has been found among them
dating from an earlier period than the Roman. The construction of the
walls, the architecture ] forms, and many coins found here, are Roman;
and none of those small relies of the period ot the Pharaohs, which are
usually found so abundantly among the ruins of Egypt, have been dig-
covered here. This was perhaps the site of the ancient Dionysias, a town
which probably sprang up on the i-uins of a Roman military station,
situated on the extreme western aide of Egypt. On the Outskirts of the
mine are walls which perhaps belonged to gardens; there must also have
been once an a ueduet for the purpose of supplying the inhabitants and
their gardens with water.

From Kay Kuran to Dimch is one day's journey. Dimeh is
situated opposite to the point at which we approach the lake from
fysnhiir, The scanty ruins on the 8. bank of the lake (EHram-'
mama, ate), are not worthy of a visit; but the ruins of Dimeh, alu-
though no inscriptions have been found there, present some attrac-
tion. A street, 400 yds. in length, formerly embellished with Ap1res
of lion/s, leads to a platform on which an important temple once
stood.'The numerous blocks scattered about here, resembling milk
stones, and apparently artif1iially rounded, are discovered on closer
inspection to be of natural formation. The paved court was 8111y-
rounded by a brick wall, and the temple itself contained several
apartments; a peristyle, with columns now in ruins, led to the en-
trance. Notwithstanding the imperfect state of the ruins, they

Ups the ancient Bacchis, once stood here,

With a favourable wind it takes about twice as long as the steamboat
voyage; to Eahdg t hrs, thence to Girgeh 6 hrs, and thence to Belidneh
