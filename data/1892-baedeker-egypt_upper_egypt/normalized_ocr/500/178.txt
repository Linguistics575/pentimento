foundations in reckoned at 88,486 individuals, of which 62,626 belonged
to the largest temple (at Mtsilhust-Habt1). The ahovemtsnh'oned Temple c.
bore the name Pa Ramae: hak an (House of Ramses, prince of Heliopolis)
and had 2623 priests and attendants.

The building is in form a complete temple, but in view of the
enormous dimensions of its surroundings can claim only the cha~
racter of a. chapel. Its total length is 170 ft, The Pylon with the
entrance door is much injured, especially at the top. Beyond it is a
Pcristyle Court (Pl. a), with eight Osiris-pillare on each side, and
at the end four caryatide pillars forming a Passage (Pl. n, whence a
door leads to a small Hypostylc (Pl, f), with eight papyrus-bud ca-
pitals. Finally come the chambers of the Sanctuary (Pl. 6). Sculp-
ture is not wanting in this temple, which owes its origin to the
wealthy founder of the Memnonium at Medinet Habu (p. 174).

the pylons was adorned with representations expressing the gratitude
of the Pharaoh to the god for victory in battle. 0n the Left Wing

him, hands him the sword of victory, and delivers to him chained
together the representatives of the vanquished peoples, who appear
in three rows. In the first two rows are the conquered nations of the
south, in the third row those of the north, On the Right Wing are
similar representations, the king here wearing the crown of Lower

Egypt V. In the doorway, Ramses III. receives from Ammon

the symbol of life, etc. On the right side-wall of the pylons are
representations of battles and captives, which were concealed by
the eolonnade, a. conclusive proof that the circumference of the court
cannot date from Ramses II,
