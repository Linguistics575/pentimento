known. From the hieroglyphics on the rocks and temple-walls at ITamii-
mil: we learn that the aneieut Koptos road formed a. link, as early as
3000 years before our era, in the intercourse carried on between the Nile
valley and Arabia, vit the desert and the sea.

We new ride in a thB, direction through a dreary district, in which
the only variety is afforded by an occasional Mabwala or Matagga. The
Hohwalas are simply spaces covered with camel's dung, easily dietine
guished from the surrounding soil by their darker ceIOur and their smooth,
eement-like surface. They occur on every great caravan route at regular
intervals and are of the utmost importance as sign-posts showing the road,
Hence no khabir or ea, merilriver passes one of these places without giving
his camels an opportunity to contribute their quota to the maintenance
of the Mohwala. The 3falus.t!, as or halting-plaees are 71/24) M. apart and
serve also as measures of distance. The ewift-ruuning camels take their
name from the number of mahattas they can reach in one day. Thus a.
camel which can cover 10 mehattes, 6.4;.'m-OO M., in one day is known
as an Ugibari (runner of'ien0. Uther milestones, of the desert are afforded
by the skeletons of camels, horses, and asses, and by small cairns above
the remains of unfortunate travellers who have lost their lives in this

chiefly inhabited by'Ababdeh; it is also a halting-plate for caravans com-
ing in the opgosite direction. The small oasis has two wells, fave palms, a
small piece 0 tilled ground, a few mud-huts, and a tttuf-ruined Arab cara-
vaneerai. It is a characteristic specimen of a desert-village and offers much
to interest the stranger. It is a place of great comfort and convenience
to the traveller, as its resources include the materials for a solid and
satisfying supper in the shape of mutton, goat's flesh, poultry, eggs, etc.
The dogs here are great thieves, and care should be taken to leave nothing
within their reach at night. Near the chief well are some fragments of
a Greek inscription of the reign of Tiberius Claudius.

The first Roman military station, the Hydreuma, now called by the
Arabs { fagr el-Bendt ('castle of the maidens"), is 3 hrs. from Lah√©tah. It
lies to the S. of the caravan route and forms an oblong 125 ft. in length
and 101 ft. in breadth. The wall inclosing the oblong, formed of layers
of sandstone without cement, was 6% ft. high. Within the wall lie 20
small chembere opening on a rectangular inner court, the only exit from
which is on the N, aide. No water is now proeurable here. To the N,
of the path, opposite the ruin of the Hydreuma, stands a rock of sand-
stone with numerous graffiti in Greek, Coptic, Arabic, Himyaritic, and
Sinaitie characters.

At a distance of about 2 hrs. from the Hydreuma the rocks close in
and form a. winding ass or gateway named Matron ]; eg-8gldm. On the
Gabe: Abu Ka'eh ('father of the elbow"), the rock at the entrance to the
pass, are more graffiti, older than those at Iratr tsl-Benn; one of them
contains the name of the religious reformer Amenhotep IV. We now

agar route leads. In the distance, to the right, rise the S. foot-hills of
the Kamdmdt Afta, while nearer and in front are the S.W. spurs. Through-
Out the whole of the Nile valley from Cairo to Phillie the traveller en-
counters no such picturesque scenery as he sees in traversing the magni-
fleertt rocky formation, of this part of the 1ilgypiUn-Aratyitut desert. Even

he outliers of the range consist of a yellow sandstone, followed by the
red'Nubian' aandstone, resembling that of the Black Forest, while the great
central mass is composed of granite.

Beyond the Mutrak lyg-8eliim the hills again diverge. Among them,
to the N. of the otsrtsvtvn-route, lies e second Roman station, with a. filled-
tn well. About 2hrs. farther on the hills of reddish-yellow sandstone
give place to 1oftter and almost black hills of hreceia, through the vanqys
