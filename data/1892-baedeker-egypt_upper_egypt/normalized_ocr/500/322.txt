Koptes, and Rebtan, overseer of grenaries. In few cases, unfortunately,
are the reigns mentioned in which they were written. The Greeks generally
wrote merely their names, eome of them suggesting a. Christian data, ell,
"AXOYMKDS { Pachumios), HETROS (Petros). We also Bad a
¢'LTIMON (Philemon), EYENOE (Euanos), and other names, beside
which not more than the common rd npoqxu'v gm, an act of reverence or
worship, stood. The inscriptions are found or miles, scratched on the
rocks and crags of the low hills skirting the river; they are most
numerous to the N. of the villages! -

A little to the N. are several Greek fmrerigWomr, first discovered by
A, C. Harris. These date from the 11th year of the emperor, Antoninus
Pius (149 AD.) and record that e mester-en ineer (a'p twniavtriO, quarried
huge blocks if 11 e119 (16 ft.) for the gate 5mm) of polio (at Edfu l').

On the W. bank, 1/4 hr. above ssl-Wish and about 3/4111. below
Silsileh, is a gorge known as Shut;'trig"'Shere of the Men',
or es » - sab'a regal,'the seven men',, On the left side of a cliff here,
a few paces from the river-bank, is a most interesting relief (also
discovered by Harris) representing the Homage of an inferior king

kher, the uniter of the two lands, and before the king's mother
Aah (moon). Behind Eutef is e ehamberlain named Kheti.

This Mentuhotep, with the gtaff of empire in his hand, was an im-
portant king at the close of the 11th Dym, end his name is mentioned in
all the extant lists of kings. A stele (now at Turin) dating from the 46th
year of his reign atteeta his long and proaperoua rule. He seems to have
been the first monarch after a long interval (8ttrdlth Dyn.) to unite the
whole kingdom under a single eceptre,, and he is thus a worthy predecessor
of the Amenemhas and Ueerteseus of the 12th Dynasty.

On the right site of the cliff is the name of Penati, an architect
who worked under Amenhotep L, TutmesI., and Tutmes II. Farther
up in the same valley occur the signatures of other royal officials,
and also (according to Petrie) the joint cartouches of Hatasu
and Tutmes m., with another mention of Penati below them. -r.

A second Scene of Homage before King Rasenkhha (oo,? Ls),

the successor of Ranebkher or Mentuhotep, is reported by Petrie,
who also discovered other kings' names, some hitherto unknown, on
these rocks.

26 M, Gebel Silsileh (Mountain of the Chain). Though we land
on the W. bank on which the most interesting monuments lie, we
should not omit to visit also the B, bank, where there are larger
quarries than on the Libyan side.

At Gabe! Silsileh begins the Sandstone Zone of the Nile valley (Vol L,
d. 56). The rocky hills which here eonflne the bed of the river supplied

the material for most of the gigantic buildings we have already visited,
for where monuments exposed to the air were to be erected the Egyptians
