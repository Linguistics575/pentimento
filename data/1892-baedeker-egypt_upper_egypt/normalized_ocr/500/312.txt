battle, is traditionally laid in the nome of Apo1linopolis, An in-
scription relating to the Home myth, on the inside of the W.
girdle-wall, states that'they reached Seth-Tulum and his com Â»
panione in the nome of Apollinopolis'.

Horns emerged victorious from this battle, and the evil Sethu
Typhon was pierced by him (tehu).'Piereer thereupon became his
name, and'place of the piercing' the name of his district and town.
This name is clearly preserved in the modern name Edfu. An-
other name, that occurs most frequently next to this one and has
also reference to the chief deity of the temple at Edfu, is Hut or
Behut. Thus the winged sun-dise, which was placed over the 611*
trance to every Egyptian temple, was named

'Hut, the great god, the lord of heaven, who, clad in bright plum-
age, comes forth from the sm1-modntain',

Another name for the winged ta1n-dise is Api, which means
'flying' and'wings',

At the head of the gods worshipped at Edfu stood, as is appa-
rent from what has already been said,'Horus, who spreads his
wings, the great god, the lord of heaven, who, clad in bright plum-
age, comes forth out of the sun-mountain', Next to him rank the
Hathor of Denderah, who undertook a special festal journey to Edfu,
Ahi, son of Hathor, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Shu, and chnut.

History of the Temple. The representations and inscriptions
that cover the walls of the great temple of Horus at Edfu place it
beyond doubt that the building in its present form dates from the
period of the Ptolemies. Yet like the sanctuary of Hathor at Den-
derah, it is not an architectonic creation of that period, but merely
a splendid restoration of an earlier temple carried out under the
Lagidae. The Temple proper, i.e. the sacred apartments exclu-
sive of the later hypostyle with its 18 columns (P1. E) and of the
foreucourt with its 32 columns (P1. F), as well as of the still later
pylons and girdle-wall, was begun by Ptolemy III. Eaerpetee I. in
the 10th year of his reign. It was flnished 95 years later, in the
28th year of the reign of Ptolemy IX. Euergetes IL, and the 18th
'Meseri in that year was flxed by the priests for its consecration,
as an important festival took place upon that day. The image of
Home was. carried in solemn procession into the temple, and the
author of the builders' inscriptions at Edfu, in describing this so-
lemn entry, introduces the god as astonished by the magnificence
that greeted him, and moved by joy, as addressing his aurround~
ings. In his speech the god expressly states that'the halls were
renewed in their building', and that 1ommands went forth from
their majesties to rebuild his house, an tydiflety of ancient imes and
