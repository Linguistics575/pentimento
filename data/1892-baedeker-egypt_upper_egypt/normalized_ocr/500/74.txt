mauoue climb. In descending they may strike the river at a point a
little farther to the S and row thence to the dhahabty eh

On the W. bank, 3 M. from the river, lies el-guetyeh, now an
imsignii1eant fellah town, representing the ancient Xmas, in which,
according to 1E1ian, Venue Urania and her cow (ale. Hathor nebt
pet Rather, the mistress of heaven) were worshipped. No inserip-
tions have been found in Kusiyeh itself, but elsewhere the name
of Hathor occurs as the Lady of Kesi. From Kesi came the Coptic
Bsm: -Bom0riis-koi0, and thence was derived the Arabic Kusiyeh.

At ei-Raith, on the E. bank, are the ruins of an ancient Egyp-
tian town, at the mouth of a Wtrd'i ascending to the Arabian mounm
tains. The walls, provided in places with window-openings, are
high, but fragments of demotie inscriptions show them to be of late
date, Small caves in the rocks contain bones from mummies of
men and cats.

Menfultt, on the W. bank (rail, stat, see p. o, an important
town with 13,2001nhab., is the seat of a Coptic bishop and con »
tains several fine villas and gardens and a bazaar. Its market is
much frequented on Sun., and it also pressesses a. sugar-factory
and a distillery, where date-brandy (raralsi) is made, partly for local
consumption by the Gopts and partly for export. The town lies
close to the river, which must here have greatly encroached 011 the
W. bank since the close of last century. The Arabs translate Mon-
falfit as'Lot's place of banishment'.

To the S. W. of Monfalt1t lies Beni'Adin, where in 1798 a collision
took place between the troops of General Deeaix and the Arabs.111 the
following year, just after the arrival of a caravan from Darhtr, General
Deveuet destroyed it as a. nest of rebels, taking the women prisoners

Jiltrhlhtstri1lti1, a small village on the E. bank,1ies on a
narrow strip of fertile land between the Nile and the S end of the
rocky Gebel Abu Fedah. It 13 the starting-point for a visit to the
Crocodile Grotto of Ma'abdeh. A guide, who may be procured in
the village of Shekilhil, is necessary to show the best way over
the stony hill and to point out the entrance to the cavern, which
easily escapes the eyes of even practised searchers. Lantern and
ropes are also necessary, and a few strong sailors to handle the
latter. Ladies should not attempt this excursion. The distance is
about 41/2M "and most of the way is up a steep hill. We first
mowed. towards the N. W to the (1 /s hr,) village of el-Ma abdeh,
and thence to the N, E. towards the hill, the plateau of which we
reach in 3/4 hr. A walk of 1/2 hr, tewards the S. then brings us to
the grotto. The entrance is in the shape of a hole 12 ft. deep, into
which we are lowered by rapes, a guide previously descending to
