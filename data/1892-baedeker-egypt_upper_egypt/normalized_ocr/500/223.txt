larger than the other soldiers .--The limestone blocks forming the
Doorway of this sandstone pylon display various sculptures and In-.
scriptions, the latter containing the usual dedicatory formulae.
The Theban triad (Amman, Math, and Khunsu) and another triad
iamsisting of Ptah, Sekhet, end Hathor are among the divinities
which here received gatrrifltyss and bestowed gifts.

On entering the First Court (Pl. A) we observe that it had on
its right and left sides a double row of columns, of which, however,
only a few scanty remains are to be found on the 8. To the W.
this space is bounded by the Second Pylon, now In ruins. On the
left (S) stood the Colossus of Ramses IT, PL d), the material of
which was justly admired by Diodorue (p. 59), and which really
may be termed the hugest statue in Egypt. The remarkable granite
statue (not sandstone like the colossi of Memnon) was probably
floated down the river on rafts from Assuin to Thebes. It has been
deliberately destroyed (apparently, from the marks at the fractures,
by means of damp wedges), though to do so must have cost its
enormous pains. In the time of Diodoms, who visited Egypt about
60 A.D., it appears to have been still uninjured; and we may 4ytmmm,
clude, therefore, that it was destroyed in consequence of the edict
of Theodoeius, as one of the principal pagan idols. The name of
Ramses IL appears in well-preserved hierog1yphitsts on the upper
arm and on the seat of the statue, which lies close by in shattered
fragments. It eannet now be put together, as the inhabitants of'Abd
eL-Igurneh have broken oft slabs of granite and smoothed them for
the purpose of bushing their corn. The face is unfortunately 45om-
pletely destroyed. The remains (breast, upper am, one foot, etc.)
still testify to "the care with which this gigantic monument was
chieelled and polished, The eavante of the French Expedition eure-
fully measured the various parts, as follows: length of ear 31/2 ft.,
surface of face from ear to ear 63A ft., surface of breast from
shoulder to shoulder 231/3 ft, from one shoulder to the other in a
straight line 211/2 ft., eircumference of the arm "the elbow
171/2 ft., diameter of the arm between the elbow and shoulder
43/4 ft., length of the index finger 31/5 ft., length of the nail on the
middle finger 71/2 inches, breadth of ditto 6 inches, breadth of the
foot across the toes, 41/2 ft. The total height seems to have been
571/2 ft, and its total weight over two million pounds.

The colossal head of another Statue of Rama II. was found on the
S. side of the temple farther back, and was conveyed to the Nile by
Belzoni in 1816, and thence to Alexandria. It is now one of the chief
treasures in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum.

The Second Peristyle court (Pl. B) is in much better pre-
servation than the first court, and is mentioned with its eeryatides
In Diodorus'ts description of the tomb of anmendyas (p. 159). Its
general arrangement is easily understood. On all four sides were
colonnades, those to the right and left (N. and 3.) having two rows
