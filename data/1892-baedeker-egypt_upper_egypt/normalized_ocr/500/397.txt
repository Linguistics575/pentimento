temple of the Rieman period, dedicated to Isis and Horus. The
name of Tutmes III. appears here on some blocks built into the
walls. Straight in front of us rises an isolated mountain. The ity.

sehoinoi above Elephantine belonging to Isis of Philas, of which
mention is made on the etele of Philometor in the temp1ts-eourt of
Phila, (comp, p. 300).

On the W. bank, opposite a dark mom1tairi-peak, lies the Temple
of Ofedinah, also called Temple of Maharalmh, after the village of
Maharakah, which lies a little higher up on the E. bank, Dating
from the Roman period, its Greek and demotic inscriptions show it
to have been dedicated to Serepis and Isis. It consisted of an NI-
tram-hall (now destroyed) approached by a broad flight of 14 steps,
and of a main colonnaded building, 40 ft, long and 50 ft. broad.
Part of the walls has fallen; but 3 columns to the right and 2 to the
left of the entrance still stand, besides 8 columns in the interior.
In the innermost corner, to the right, are traces of a staircase
leading to the roof. A wall connects this temple with a smaller
equate structure to the E., on which is a curious representation:
beneath a fig-tree (iepaauxdpwoc, whence the Greek name of the
place, which was perhaps named Penubs in early Egyptian anti-
quity) sits a goddess with cow's horns (rsiir-Bathor), before whom is
a boy with a jug in his hands; above are three other gods. To the
left of this scene is Thoth with the e11; beneath is Isis.

The route now lies between monotonous hills. At 8eptteh we
reach the boundary between Widi Kemls and the Wddi el-'Arali,
which extends to Ibrhn, At Mehendi, on the W. bank, are the ruins
of a Roman settlement. The mountains, especially on the K, be-
come higher, At Medik is a picturesque group of hills with groves
of palms, The river makes a wide bend to the W., and we soon
come in sight of the temple of Siytstfah, 27 M. from Dakkeh.

The Temple of Sebn'eh .--Es-Seba'ah or 8ehtgah (the lions) or
wed: Seba'ah is the site of a temple dedicated toAmmon and Ptah by
Ramses IL, and constructed like the temple at Gerf Eugen, partly try
excavation in the rock, partly by building. The name is apparently
derived from the avenue ot Lions or Sphimes in front of the temple.
Eight ofthese lions with human faces are supposed to have been ranged
on each side, though only the two first have retaine their heads. A
