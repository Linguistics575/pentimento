Nana, doting from Ptolemy and C1tsopatraa--If we quitthe 1typo-
etyle of the temple of Isis proper by the small portal in its E. wall
between the tirist row of columns and the second pylon, we see
about 50 paces in front of us the Chapel of Rather (Pl. Q), the
smallest temple on the island. That it was especially dedicated to
Rather we learn from hieroglyphic inscriptions

of the time of the emperor Augustus, and from the Greek inecrip~
tion IEPTIA EHOIHCEN--TH -~ A¢PQAE|TH,'mertia directed
(a prayer) to Aphrodite (Htthor)'.t The fact that the rear wall of
this chapel has no inscriptions and the ruins behind it indicate
that it was once joined to some larger 1siliiitas: At the entrance
stand two Ptolemaic columns, with a doorway between them, the
eiéewposte of which, unconnected with each other at the top, reach
to the bands below the capitals. This doorway is built up, and'it
is probable that the single apartment within the temple was used
as a. dwelling, as its walls are much blackened.

A few minutes bring us from the chapel of Hathor to the elegant
and airy Pavilion (Pl. R) » frequently celled'Pharaoh's Bed', one
of the chief decorations of the island, which may beeseily recognized
by the lofti abaci, or rather imports, that support the arohitrave.
Passengers are usually landed immediately below it. It is situated
on the E. coast of Philm, which is here bounded by a carefully
built wall, The builder of this beautiful temple, dedicated likewise
to Isis, was Nerve Trajanus; but its ornamentation with sculptures
and inscriptions was never quite completed. The iniaeription, s con-
tain little of importance, so that the visitor may resign himself at
once to the pleasure of rest and luncheon on this beautiful spot.
The Kiosque of Phila has been depicted a. thousand times, and the
slender and graceful form, that greets the eyes of the travellers as
they approach the island, wall deserves the honour. The architect
who designed it was no stranger to Greek art, and this pavilion,
standing among the purely Egyptian ternples around it, produces
the tiNet of a line of Hamel.- among hieroglyphic inseri tione, er of
a naturally growing tree among artiNu1hr, trizrtmifd edges, We
