Ramses VI., and announcing to him the gift of Pennut, who presented
the adjacent statues of the king and two silver anointing-vessels In the
lower row, Pennut and Ta Kha, his wife, the singer of Ammon, present

above, the women below. These family scenes are continued on the E.
part of the N. Wall; above is the worship of Hermechie, below that of
Osiris. On the W. part of the N. wall and continued on the Mr, wall
and half of the s. wall are scenes relating to the worship of the dead.

Within the mountain is a chapel with a tapering roof, and in front of
the mountain is the goddess Ape, holding a frog in her hand. On the

rises steeply from the Nile on the E, Upon this stands the partly
ruined fort of Kagr Ibrim, dating from Roman times. A visit to it
is interesting. The ascent is made on the N. At the top are some
blocks with the name of Taharka of the 25th Dym, and a basilica
with Byzantine capitals of granite. Keel: Ibrim is identified with
the Roman Primis Panza or Premis, a fortress stormed by Petronius
o, 302), who afterwards restored it and garrisoned it with 400 men,
with provisions for two years. At the beginning of the 16th cent.
the sultan Selim placed a garrison of Bosniane here, whose descen-
dants were defeated in 1811 by the flssing Mamelnkes. Finally
Ibrahim Pasha captured the fortress.

In the S. slope of the mountain, not far above the river-bank,
are five grottoes hewn in the rock, all of which except the most
northerly, bear inscriptions. The tlrgt (on the so shows ever the

to the king, is the inscription:'Bringing of the tribute of the S.
