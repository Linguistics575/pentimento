rubbed out. On the left (13.) wing, however, the life-like figure of
the king, shooting arrows from his chariot, and the fine rearing
horses of his chariot, are still clearly to be distinguished. On the
right (W0 wall also a good deal may be made oat, The king is here
represented in his camp. He has dismounted from his chariot, which
waits for him, and has seated himself upon his throne. Bis offieers
await his instructions, anti farther in the background the troops
rest in their camp. The inscriptions are much injured, bat it can
be made out from them that they were graven in the stone ehitsfly
in honour of Ramses II.'s victory over the Khete (Aramaeans) and
their allies. In the 5th year of the king, on the 9th Payni, the for-
tress of Katesh on the Orentes wee stormed. The river and the
contest on its banks are still distinguishable. The Epic of Pentaur
in 90 vertical lines, covers the lower part of the W. wing and part
of the E. wing; some of it has recently been uncovered, the rest is
still concealed by rubbish. This poem was the national epoe, the
Iliad, of the ancient Egyptians. It occurs twice on the E. bank et
Thebes--on the N. side of the pylon at Luxor and on the S. side
of the temple of Karnak (here also partly concealed by earth). It is
also found, though in a very fragmentary condition, on the N. wall
of the temple of Ramses II. at Abydos (discovered flrst by Eisen-
lehr), and in the most complete (hieratie) form in the Eapyrus
Raifet (now in the Louvre) and the Papyrus Satiier III. (pow in
the British Museum).

The poetic text on the pylons at Luxor is followed by a prose
text, dealing mainly with the arrival of two hostile spies, who gave
out at first that the Khete had fled into the land of Khirebu (Hel-
bon or Aleppo) to the N. of Tunep, but who on being scourged re-
vealed the real lurking-Pure of the enemy to the N.W. of Katesh.
The king hastily recalled the Egyptian troops, but too late to pre-
vent his camp being suddenly attacked on the S. by the Kheta. The
Egyptians were surrounded, and only the personal bravery of the
king secured the final victory. This prose inscription, preserved in
full at the Ramesseum and in the temple of Ahu-Simbel, describes
the same event as the poem of Pentaur, though it dates it a month
later,

The most important and fhuttrt episodes according to the restoration
of the text by E, de R'oug√© are as follows.'Then the miserable and
worthless Kheta. with his numerous allies lay hidden behind the fortress
of Katesh. Hie majesty found himself alone (with his servants). The
legion of Ammon marched after him; the legion of Ra passed through
the valley to the 8. of the fortress of Shebtun and marched forwards

In the centre was the legion of Ptah, supported by the fortress
of Amara; the legion of Sutekh - (Ststh-Ty hon) went upon its way.
The king had summoned all the leaders 0 his army, who were in the
valleys ot the land of Amaur. The miserable and worthless prince of the
Kheta was in the midst of his soldiers; and for fear of His Majesty dared
not prepare himself to battle. Yet he ordered forward hie archers and
his chariots, that wore mere in number than the sand of the sea shore. Three

men were in each chariot, and they had united themselves with the warriors
of the land of the Kheta, expert with all weapons. Hewsemeih rrvrr hidden
