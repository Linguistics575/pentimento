Distribution of Time. The ruins of the city of the hundred gates are
so huge, 30 widely scattered, and so profoundly interesting, that at least
5-6 days are necessary to inspect the chief points alone. Those who are
specially interested in Egyptology will of course devote a much longer
time to Thebes; weeks or even months may be spent in a careful study
of its monuments and tombs. -MTMTF Cook's tourist-programme devotes the
Ist day to the temple of Seti I. at humah and the Tombs of the Kings,
the return being made at the choice of the tourist either direct or over
the hill to Die: el-Baltri, the Ramesseum, and the Colossi' of Memnon.'NWN'

messeum, Tombs of Shékh'Abd el-Itlurnah, Dér el-Med" tneh, Medinet Hahn,
and Colossi of Memnnn. Those who are fatigued by the previous ex-

the party lunches (and in the interval visit Dar el-Hedineh) .--A moan-
light ride to Karnak may be taken fat the touriat's private expense) on
One of the evenings.

Those who are at liberty to arrange their time for themselves will
find the following programme of a Three Bagit Visit convenient.

ist day. Luxor and Karnak (E. hank). Though visitors are some'
times advised to reserve this, the most gigantic of the monuments, to the
last, it is really desirable to visit Karnak first of ali, before fatigue has
begun. The traveller who visits Kamak on the f1rtst day proceeds then
to view the other liuns, with the satisfactory feeling that Thebes has
fa1fl11ed his highest expectations; and he will not fail to take a later
opportunity, by moonlight or at any free time, to return to refresh and
tsoidrrn his ilrat impression. Visitors ahould ride early to Karnak, while
the temple of Luxor, easily reached in a few minutes from the dhahabiyeh,
may be reserved for an afternoon-visit.

d day, Cross the river early, visit the Coloasi of Hemnon, the
Ramessenm, MUinet Babu, and Der el-Medineh, in the morning it possible.
if time permit also one of the tombs in the part of the Necropolia of
Thebes known as Kumet Murrai', and finally some of the Tombs of Shékh
'Abd eHrttrysh, The view at sunset from this point is of incomparable
beauty and Interest.

3rd day, Cross the river early, visit the temple of Beti I. at Knuth,
ride to the valley of the Tombs of the Kings (Bibi'm eraru1tik) with the

of Dér eluBahri and some of the tombs of erAgastf. A visit to the Tombs
