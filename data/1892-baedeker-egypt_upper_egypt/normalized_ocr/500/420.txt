The oasis and the oracle of Ammon were celebrated from a remote
antiquity. Bacchus is aeid to have been the firgt to consult the oraele;
and in the legend of Perseus and Andromeda, the latter was said to have
been offered to the 8tya-mtyttster to save her country, in obedience to a
response of this god. Hercules preeentedagreat offering to Amman. Semiramis
censulted the oracle on her expedition to Egypt. The law-giver Bocchorie
(Belt-en-rant, 28th Dyn.; 8th cent. B13.) expelled the J ewe from the land at the
bidding of the god. Psammetikh I. enrolled the Cerians with plumes ofeock" a
feathers in obedience to his response. Herodotus relates (III, 25, 26) that
Gambyeee sent 50,000 men to take the Ammonitee slaves and to destroy their
oracle with fire. This force reached the city of Oasis, also called the Inland
of the Blessed, after 7 days march, and then vanished into space, apparently
being overwhelmed by a whirlwind. The oasis and its oracle are, how-
ever, best known from the visit of Alexander the Great, recorded by Dio-
dorus (XVII, 49), Quinta: Curtiua, and Arrian after Arietohulus. After
Alexander had made himself master of Phoenicia. by the battle of Issus,
he marched to Egypt which submitted without resistance,, Desiring to
consult the famous Oracle of Ammon, he undertook the adventurous march
through the desert. Ambassadors from Cyrene met him with a valuable
gift of war-horses. His supply of water came to an end after four days,
and he was only saved from perishing by an unexpected fall of rain. The
way was pointed out to him by crews, flying on the right side of the
army. He passed the Bitter Lakes, then 100 etadia (about 10 MO farther
the so-called Cities of Ammon, and another day"? journey brought him to
the vicinity of the temple. Dioderus thus describes the place.'The Am-
monites dwell in villages, bat in the midst of their land is a castle de-
fended by a triple wall. The first (Le. innermost) wall encloses the pa-
lace of the ruler; the second the women's apartments, with the dwellings
of the women and children and the palladia of the place, with the temple
of the god and the sacred spring; the third encloses the abode of the
spearmen, etc. A little beyond the castle another temple of Ammon has
been erected under the shade of numerous large trees. Near it is a spring,
celled Spring of the See on account of its peculiar properties. It is warm
in the morning, cold at midday, and hot at midnight. The image of the
god is encrusted with emeralds and other gems, and gives its orecular
responses in a curious way. It is carried in a golden boat On the shani-
ders of eighty priests, who direct their course according to signs from the
god. Women and girls accompany the god with eonga".

When Alexander entered the temple he was hidden welcome by the
oldest priest in the name of the god. Alexander accepted the welcome
and promised to worship the god, if he gave him the lordship of the
whole earth. The king then asked whether all the murderers of his fa-
ther had been punished, The oracle replied that no one could aim at the
life of him that had made him (ale. of the god); but that the murderers
of Philip were punished

The Oasis of Mwah, formerly called also Samaria (after Iskander, Ale-
xander the Great) lies, according to Jordan'g calculations, 95 ft. below the
see-level, in N. lat. 29012 and long. 25031' E. of Greenwich. Browne
estimated the length of the oasis at 71/2 M., its breadth at 6 M, Rohlfs
estimates the length from Maragi in the W. to Muzey Yes in the E. at
about 181/2 11., in a line running first N.W. and SE. and beyond Siwah SW.
and NE. The breadth varies from a few yards to 11/4 M. It is situated
on the S. verge of the steep tyo-ealled Libyan eoaiplateau, which Con-s
aiete of limestone, and on the S. it is bounded by sand-hills.

Several steep rocks are found in the oasis; 42.9. the Amelal and Djart
in the W., the Gabe! iifiltiih, 1/231. to the N. of Mwah, the rocks of tmoah
and Akermd, Gabe! Bidi Hamed to the th, and Gebel Brit: to the S.E. of the
capital. Of the numeroue warm springa (upwards of 30) in the oasis,
the strongest are those of Ahamisah, and the most famou tudt' dm
