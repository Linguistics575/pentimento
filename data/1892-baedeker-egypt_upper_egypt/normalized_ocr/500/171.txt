beholder by the building now, ruined but with its whole plan and
theory still clear and intelligible. There is nothing new to distract
the eye from the lines and forms of the temple; and the pomp of
banners and the clouds of incense are replaced by the magic of
dignifled antiquity. Amidst these hoary ruins, we realize the short-
ness of our mortal span and recognize the evanescence of human
greatness and splendour.

Starting from the great pylon of the temple of Luxor, we pro-
ceed to the lil., then follow the street with the Greek shops, and
leaving the houses of the ghawizi and the hill with the tomb of
the shtlrh to the right, hold towards the N. We soon arrive at the
ilrgt ruins of Karnak, and finally, if we have followed the W. route,
reach an imposing row of Krioaphinaas, Le. sphinxel with the be-
dies of lions and the heads of rams. Near this point, to' the S. of
the temple, are two almost parallel Proeearional Avenues flanked
with sphinxea, one uniting the temple of Muth (p. 148) with the
S. pylons (p. 147), the other leading from the temple of Later to
the temple of Khuneu (p, 148). These two avenues were connected
with each other by a third cross-avenue of sphinxes. We follow
the left (W) avenue, the flanking Sphinxes of which are carved in'
the grand style and are placed close to each other. Between the legs
of each is a stetuette with the name of Amenhotep III. (Bev-ma-mm).
This leads us to the handsome but almost too slender Pylon XII,
erected by Ptolemy III. Euergetes 1., with a winged eun-disc in the
easement, with boldly-spread pinions. In the time of the Lagidae
additional pylons, corresponding to this one, were placed at the ex-
treme corners of the temple. That on the N. side (p. 143) is still in
admirable preservation. Inside the portal Euergetes is represented
in Egyptian style theugh clad in Greek costume. To the right of
the lowest representation on the left side, the king appears sacri-
tieing to Khunsu. Between these are the hawk of Horus, the vul-
ture of Nekheb, and the ibis of Thoth, which are also represented
flying, to bear to the world intelligence of the battles, victories, and
wisdom of the prince. The inscriptions record that this pylon was
dedicated to Khuneu of Thebes. Another avenue of sphinxee
follows, beyond which rises the Temple of Khunsu (Pl. YO, e hench-
some building on which, however, we now bestow only a passing
glance (comp. p. 148). About 200 paces towards the W. bring us
to the First'Main Pylon (el-b√©b cl-kebir), which faces the river. We
here begin our description of the temple.

I. The Great Temple of Ammon.

As we stand before the massive pylons of the largest group of
buildings at Earn ek, we may eeeta glance at the rows of Kriosphinxea
which led from the temple-portal to the Nile. Be een these rows
