ascend a branch to the left, The passage in a tstraighrdir'eotiori
chiefly contains human mummies, while that to the left is packed
with mummies of crocodiles. Some of these are of great size, and
in other cases bundles of 25 1ra1sy-eroeodi1es are put up together.
Baskets of best contain erooodi1eeggs, with the shells, contain"
ing the embryo, still unbroken. After some time we reach a more
spacious part of the grotto, where it is possible to stand erect. It in
not improbable that the, cave had a second entrance on the other
side of the hill, but this has net yet been discovered Great care
should be exercised m using the lights; two Frenchmen who acci-
dentally set ilra to the mummrtrandagiis were suffocated by the
smoke and burned to ashes. It was. here, that Mr, Harris found
the celebrated papyrus MS. containing fragments of Homer' 3 Iliad,
which wad held in the hand of the mummy of a man wearing a
coronal of gold. The' enormous number of' Crocodile Mummies
found here will astonish no one who knows the following passage
in the trustworthy'Abdellatif (12th cent.:)'Among the eniinals
peculiar to Egypt the crocodile must not be forgotten, which occurs
in great numbers in the Nile, particularly in the S. part of saiid
(Upper Egypt) and in the vicinity of the cataracts. There they
swarm like worms in the Tater of the river and around the cliffs
that form the cataracts'. In hiitime there were still crocodiles in
the Delta. These animals are now totally extinct on the lower Nile;
none has been seen for many years'between Cairo and Gebel Abu
Fedeh, and they are becoming very rare between the latter point
and Assuen, mainly, it is said, owing to the noise of the steam~
boats. Even between the First and Second Cataracts they are now
rare, though 20 years ago they were very frequent.

The road to Assitt, which we encountered on our visit to et-Tell
(see p. 22), leads across the Gebel Abu Fédah and reaches the Nile
at BeniMohammed, near the S. base of this hill. In the hill beyond
Beni Mohammed are some tombs of the 6th Dym, with ar1intes
esting and half-effaeed representations of agricultural and other
scenes. In the valley lies the Captie convent Dér cl-Gebmi, tOrr-
taining ll Greek inscription (discovered by Mr, Harris) in the shape
of a dedication of the camp of the Lusitanian Cohort, which served
under Diocletian and Maximian, to Zeus, Hercules, and Nike (Vic-
toria). In the desert, between the convent and the hills, are some
scanty fragments of walls of brick, which seem to have belonged
to the forti'fliyd camp.

Between Monfalttt and Asusi'tt (26 M. by water, 17 M. by land)
the Nile makes several great bends, which occasion a good deal of
delay to navigation, The generally favourable N.E. wind here
sometimes blows broadside on, and sometimes even against us. The
greatest curves are at Bdkir el- Mcnkabdd and el- Amrdg. li2-,
Menkabad Coptic Man Kapot ('pottiri village'), situated on an
'rtitisia1 arm of the Nile, has long been famous for it pottery. To
