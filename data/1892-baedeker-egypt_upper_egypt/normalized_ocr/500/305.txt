In the series below these, Pihm-i is seen with e book in which he is
writing, before him a large writing apparatus The accompanying inscrip-
tion is,'Recording the number of cattle by the overseer of Anit, the director
of the fields, of the B. dietrict, from the tem 1e of Rathm- (Aphroditopolia,
p. 231) to ermEi'ib.' -.l- Then follow cattle",'f'",'ed, fl kinda, calves, oxen,
asses; several of these being prepared for the table Or for aaerifuur, t a fire-
place. Next appears Pihari, seated and inspecting the weighing and ship-
ping of gold which is mostly made into rings. Farther to the right, the
catching and pre arin of fish and also of poultry, Pihari standing and
looking on .--A eve ihari beers on his lap the young prince Uazmee,
second son of king Aahmes (1680 B.C.) whose nurse (Le. tutor) he is

Grapes are being gathered, and trodden out in a wine-preae by nude
fhpdtse, holding cords as they work.

The remaining paintings illustrate the Burial of Pihari, whose eoflin
is drawn upon a sledge. On the right wall Pihari and his wife receive
an offering made by their son Amonmet, who is clad in a 1tsoptsrdhrrnekim,
Beneath the chair is a cynocephalus. Behind Amonmea the mourning
friends are seated in two divisions. At the head of each division is a
seated married couple, and then two rows of relatives, father, mother,
grandfather, grandmother, brothers, sisters, and aunts; above is the ship~
master Aehmes, eon of Abua with his wife; below is Ate/tera the nurse
of King Uazmee, and at the i'oot, female musicians and a female harper.

0f the tombs to the right that of Aalimeg snrnemed Pen hebm or
Pen suben is noteworthy, not only because two stones from the base
of a. statue with historical inscriptions (now in the Louvre) were
found here and because a statue of Aahmes was discovered in 1883 in
the ruins of Syl-kits, but also because the services rendered by the
deceased to the kings of the 18th Dyn. and the rewards he received
are recorded on the right and left of the entrance, as well as on the
stones abovementioned, The kings mentioned are Aahmee, Amen-
hotep L, Tutmee L, IL, and 111., and Queen Remake, with her son
and daughter. See Lepsius's Denkmiler m, 436.

From these inscriptions we learn that Am, snmemed Pan Mime,
followed the kings of the 18th Dyn. from Aahmea to Tutmee III. on their
various campaigns to Zahi, Kuah, Nahariaa, and against the Slim, and

that he captured men, horses, and chariots, for which he received rich
gifts. In thistomb is also commemorated the royal prince Ammhotep, our-
