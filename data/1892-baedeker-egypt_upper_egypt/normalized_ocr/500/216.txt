famous sound. The oldest inscription dates from the 11th year of Nero's
reign .--Many of the great omeiaht who visited the marvels of Thebes were
accompanied by their wives. Thus Lucius Junius Celvinus and his wife
Minicia Rutstiea," in the 4th year of Veapasian, heard the phenomenon at the
second hour, though most other visitors heard it at the morning-hour,
tle. at or soon after sunrise. The colossus was frequently dumb, in which
case the visitor usually waited until a more favourable occasion. Mam
were so struck with the phenomenon that they were not content till they
had heard it three or four times. Hadrian, whojourneyed through Egypt
in 130 A.D., apent several days here along with his wife Sabina end a
large retinue. In his reign a perfect flood of verses spread over the legs
of the colossus, most of them by the vain eourt-potstes8 Balbilla, the de-
scendant of a noble house, as she is careful to mention. One of her
effusions (on the left leg) relates in 16 Irexameters, that Memnen greeted
Hadrian, as well as he could ids; Suvarév) when he perceived the emperor
before sunrise, but that a clearer note, like that caused by a blow on an
instrument of copper, was emitted at the eeeoud hour, and that even a
third sound was heard. Hadrian greeted Memnon as often, and all the
world could see how dear the emperor was to the god,
'Balbilla, by an inward impulse stirred'
'Has written all she saw and all she heard',

By far the beat verses are those on the front of the pedestal try Al'-
klepiodolm, who calls himself imperial procurator and poet, They may
be translated as follows: u.wNBamp

'Sewborn Thetis, learn that Memnon suffered never pangs of dying'.

'Bull, where Libyan moan tains rise, sounds the voice of his loud crying" -.

' (Mounteins which the Nile-stream, laving, parts from Thebes, the hun-
dred-gated)'--

'When he glows, through rays maternal with warm light'illuminated'.

'But thy son who, msvér-sstisd, dreadful battle still was eeeking',

'Dumb in Troy and Thessaly, rests now, never speaking".

On the right leg of the colossus is a curious'Homerie' poem, inscribed
by a certain Arden, and made up of four lines from the Iliad and Odys-
sey, pieced together by the poet so as to express his meaning:

'Alas, a mighty wonder I there behold with mine eyes'
(11. xiii, 99)
'Truly a. god is here, a noble inhabitant of heaven!'
Chl, xix, 40)
'Loud he raises his voice, and stays the assembled multitude'.
d. xxiv, 530)
'Never could a mortal man accomplish such B thing as thia'.
(0d. xvi, 196).

The mine in the neighbourhood of the colessi are unimportant.
About 3 min. beyond them is another Statue of great size, now,
however, almost completely covered by arable land. Farther to the
N.W. are very numerous smaller statues. The ruined Amenophium,
at the gates of which the above-mentioned statues stood, has left an
important memorial in the shape of a consPieuous colossal Sand-
stone Stale, erected try Amenhotep 111. It now has its broadest
surface uppermost, and "is covered with hieroglrphies in the grand
style, which, with the representations, refer to the dedication of the
temple. In the rounded pediment the Pharaoh appears receiving
the symbol of life from Ammon on the right, and from sokar-0siris
on the left; above are the winged eun-diee and the name of Amenn
hotep III. Behind the Pharaoh in each case is his consort Tii,
adorned with the ftyather-erown,, The first line of the inscription
contains the pompous titles of the king; the second begi l
