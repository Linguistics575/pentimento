moved the long processions which left the temple of Ammon to visit
the W. parts of Thebes. f3turbargtssr, glittering with gold and
brilliant colours, waited here to receive the priests and the sacred
images. On the river-stepe were ranged choirs, which, at least on
the tive great festival days of Ammon, greeted the pilgrims from the
opposite) bank with songs. The eneient eenstructions on the banks
have long been washed away, In January and February, the months
in whieh most travellers visit Karnak, the stream is only 100~300
paces from the procession-aims; while during the Inundation the
water penetrates into the interior of the temple, which in ancient
times it was prevented from doing by huge embankments Rem-
ses II. constructed this route to the river, yet most of the Krio-
sphinxes that adorn it have statuettes of Seti II. Merenptah
between their legs, and two small broken ohelisks also hear the
name of Seti who rei ed towards the close of the 19th Dynasty.
In 1883 a small temp e with the name of king Psammuthia, of the
29th Dyn., was discovered at the S.W. corner of the pylon to
the right,

The *First Main Pylon (PI, I) is of enormous size. It is still
124, ilir, wide, with walls 16 ft. thick and 14% ]; ft. high. This
gigantic portal, which probably dates from the Ptolemiss, although
no record of the Get is known, is éestitute of inscriptions. Possibly
it was covered with stucco and edemeci with paintings, as its decea-
ration with reliefs would have demanded. ei'iermous toil and time,
No ene should omit to make the *Ascent of this pylon. This may
be done most easily, and without any danger or special diffieaity,
on the N. side, till we are about half way up, and thence by means
of a steep and narrow stair in the interior. The top is so broad that
even those who are subject to giddimsss need not fear to trust them-
selves upon it. After enjoying the extraordinary view of the immense
ruins from this point of vantage, it is useful and interesting to seek
to identify, with the aid of the accompanying plan, the vatious cola
umns, ebelisks, and pillars which at first present themselves in
apparently imsxtrieabie confusion. This is comparatively easy es
regards the nearer (WI) portion of the temyle; but the more distant
portions, from among which ebelisks tower, are partly out of sight,
and are partly so foreshorttsmyil by distance, that they appear to
form one confused system of mine. The view by moonlight is in-

describebly tina. But on the whale the result is a general though"

inefraeeable impression, rather than a. clear idea of the arrangement
of the various parts of the building, The latter is only to be obtained
by wandering, plan in hand, through the ruins. It must, however,
never be forgotten that the temple of Karnak, so fer from having
one single uniform plan, grew up gradually, and that many of its
parts owe their character not to any artistic calculation, but to
such accidental considerations as the space at the disposal of the
architect, the means and length of life of the b11ilderis-aItti the siilrs
