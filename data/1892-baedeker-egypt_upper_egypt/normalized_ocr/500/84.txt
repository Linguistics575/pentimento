Fayam. LABYRINTH. 2, Route, 39

thug reach the Kataganta structure, which consists of a terrace of
six carefully jointed. steps of large and we11-hewn blocks, but bears
no inscription whatever. We cross the Balir el-. Warddn, which
now intersects the ruins near the Pyramid of ] fGmirrtth, and which
is sometimes called by the Arabs Balm cl-Mclekh or Bahr tsh-Surly,
i.e. river of the East. On the E. side lies the mass of buildings,
which, according to Lepsius, was probably the Labyrinth (see be-
low). In order to obtain a survey of these interesting ruins the
traveller is recommended to ascend at once the Pyramid of Ra-
whm. This consists of unburnt bricks of Nile mail mixed with straw
(Vol. L, p. 370, and, when its sides were perfect, covered an area
of upwards of 16 sq. yards, It has been ascertained that the nu-
eleue of the structure is a natural mass of reek, 39 ft. in height. The
dilapidated summit is easily reached in a few minutes by a flight of
well-worn steps. The entrance to the pyramid, on the S. side, was
discovered in 1889 by Mr. Flinders Petrie. The tomb chamber
is 22 ft. long, 8 ft. wide, and 6 ft, high; it was covered with three
large slabs of stone and contained two sareephagi, one of them of
polished sandstone without inscription, and fragments of an alaa
baeter vase with the name of Amenemha III. The chamber was
flUad with water to a depth of 3 ft,

Towards the S. we observe a eongeries of chambers and passages
of unhumt bricks, bounded by the Bahr egh- Sherhi, and pronounced
by Lepsius to be the right side of the Labyrinth, and the only part
of it which is to some extent preserved. 0n the other side of the
Pyramid there was doubtless a similar collection of rooms which has
new disappeared; and several other structures beyond them, of which
traces still remain, must have once existed. there. The whole Laby-
rinth must have been in the shape of a horseshoe. Between the wing
of the Labyrinth which still exists, and that which has disappeared,
lies an extensive Space strewn with broken pottery, in the middle
of which are large fragments of a magnifleent ancient temple. The
base of the shaft of a smell papyrus column, and a capital of the same
order, both in the red stone of Aegean, with sculptured stalks and
foliage, are worthy of notice. Some blocks disinterred here bearing
the name of Amenemha 111. have again been covered with sand.
Several large blocks of limestone are also observed in the middle of
this large court of the Labyrinth. The inscriptions are almost err-
tirely destroyed, but faint traces of painting, and the symbols < FtCCC >

(tsa) and Oi), are still recognisable. From the traces still ex »

iating, the whole structure would appear to have occupied an area

of 8800sq. yds., and the large inner court an area of about 60 acres.

The Ancient Labyrinth. According to Brugseh, the Greek name Imby-
rinthoe, Which has been differently interpreted, is derived from yyre',
er'eipa-rohunt', i, e. the'Temple of the mouth of the Lake', The 111-
neriptions found here by Lepsius prove that it was founded by Amem
emhe III. of the 12th Dynasty. Herodotus declares that th Lab?"
