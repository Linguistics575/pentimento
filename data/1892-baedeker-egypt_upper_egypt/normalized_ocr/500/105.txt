tions, the inscription continues as follows, with special reference to
this temple:'For lo, while the temple of Ra-ma-men (Le. Seti I.)
was still building both hack and front,' Seti ascended to heaven,
before his Memnonium (Mennu) was completed. The columns had
not yet been placed upon their bases, the statue lay on the ground
and was not yet finished off, when he (Seti) became acquainted
with the tomb (the'golden room', the principal chamber of Seti's
tomb at Biban el-Mulino, etc. Then said His Majesty to the seal-
bearer by his side: Summon the courtiers, the military commanders,
and their fellows, and also the whole multitude of architects and
librarians. When these were conducted before Bis Majesty, pressing
their noses in the dust and their knees to the earth, they broke out
into rejoicing and smelled the ground (Le,, prostrated themselves).
They raised their arms, praising His Majesty, and prayed to this
benignant deity, celebrating his perfection', Then follow emphatic
expressions of worship, addressed to the king.'Then spoke His
Majesty unto them and said: I summoned you before me on account
of a. plan that has entered my mind. I have seen the buildings of

to superintend the works... I erected pylons in front of it, I have

was the monument, doubly as glorious as at first. It is (named) after
my name and after the name of my father, for, as the son, so is also

tsun-god Ra there has never been & son who has accomplished what
thou hast,.. I Thou, thou workest, thou renewest one monument
