bis. On the W. bank stretches a broad and fertile plain, on the
E. is the f1ms1y shaped Gebet Shcromh. At el-dratrt, on the E. bank,

appears the flrgt sandstone.

On the W. bank, about% hr. farther to the s, is the pyramid of
el-Kuluh, which now presents the aspect of a tstep-pyramid, owing to the
deeey of the fming-in material. The entrance was on the W. side. In
spite of its ruinous condition it is still about 30 ft. high, while its base
occupies an area about 65 ft. square. Maepero recently carried on exce-
vatiens here, which Injured the building without yielding any important
result. As there are no inscriptions it is d'irfuult to determine the date
of its construction.

. *Ruins of the ancient town; 2, the Rock Inscriptions; 3. the'Chapel
of Amenhotep 111.; 4. the Rock Tcmpel of the Ptelemies; and 5. the
*Tombs. If so much time cannot be spared, the last should at least
be visited. The various monuments may be visited in the above
order as follows We shirt the boundary wall of the ancient town,
which is distinctly visible, then turn to the E. to (% hr.) an isolated
hill, rising from the plain, on the right side of which are most of the
roek-inseriptions. At the end of this valley we turn a little to the
left to reach the chapel of Amenhotep 111., with four columns in
the interior. We here turn round, and following the 8. wall of tho
more northerly chain of hills, reach the steps which lead to the
roelr-temple, We may then visit the small temple of Thoth (called

The interpretation of the name of the city and e, goddess as chheb
and Suben is probably wrong. The *GIRDLB WALL is in excellent

immense thickness, 37 ft. or as wide as a considerable street, and
is built of huge tmn-dried Nile-hricks. The savents of the French
Expedition estimated that the ancient town accommodated 10,000
inhabitants. "Visitors should not omit to mount the broad ascent to
the top of the wall on the W. side, from which a good survey of the
tombs en the N. hill-chain is also obtained, Apparently only the
