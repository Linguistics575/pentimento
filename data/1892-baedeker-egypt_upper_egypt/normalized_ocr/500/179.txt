122 Route 11. KARNAK. East Bank

The lower parts, especially in the tsanetuary-ehambtmr, are covered
with rubbish. A long List of 0reriagt on the left (E) exterior
wall is of some interest. It records that Ramses 111., in the month
Payni in the 16th year of his reign, decreed that gifts for his father
Ammon-Ra, the king of the gods, should be laid upon the silver
altar, such as provisions, traerifieial cakes, etc. Then follow some
details (injured) as to the amount of the omsrings

3. The Portiqne den Bubastitea (Portico ofthe Bubaatitcs; Pl. a),
so called by Champollion, is the part of the court between the left
(E) wall of the temple just described and the S. part (te, the farm
thest to the right) of the second pylon. This space, only 43 ft. wide,
had a door admitting to the temple from the 8., and is to be regarded
as the E. end of the colonnade which lined the s, wall of the court.
Two unseu1pturei1 1yspyrusr-bud columns divide it from the rest
of the court. Numerous inscriptions dating from the 22nd Dym,
which originated in Buhastis, cover the walls, and contain impor-
tant materiel for the history of that period. This dynasty succeeded
the inglorious line of priest-kings, who seized the throne of Thebes
after the seIf-indulgent rulers of the 20th dynasty. Their names
are rather Semitic then Egyptian, a circumstance that need cause
no surprise when we remember that Bubastis is named as their
home, a city in the E. part of the Delta which was settled by Semitic
tribes. As their names appear to be of Aramaic origin it is not
impossible that they were placed upon the throne of the Pharaohs
by the Assyrian conquerors who are mentioned in the cuneiform
inscriptions of Mesopotamia, though the Egyptian hisrog1yphiets
ignore them. Like their predecessors of the gist Dyn., they retained
the chief priesthood in their own control, apparently by committing
this offhys to their heirs, In the hall in which we now are the
king appears several times with the erowrr-prinets, who is named
'flrsst prophet of Ammon-lu'; and the crown-prince occurs also
without his father, Sheshenk I. probably began the decoration of
the building, for his name appears in the usual place for the des-
dication-inscriptidn; Le. on the architrave above the columns. The
names of Osorken I/ and Takelut l, also occur. The hvst-namail
king appears before Ammon-Ita accompanied by his son Osorkon,
clad in the priestly panther-skin; and Osorkon also occurs alone
offering sacrifice to Ammon. 0n the E, wall is a double painting
representing Amman to the right and left, wearing the feather-
crown and seated on a throne, while the deceased son of the same
Osorkon approaches in priestly garb to oifer saerifiee, Beneath is a.
long but unfortunately damaged Inscription, dating from the 12th
year of Takelut 11., which mentions a remarkable event said to
have occurred in the reign of the father of that prince (probably
Sheshenk 11.). The passage in question is not absolutely clear,
but this much may he gathered with certainty, viz. that on the 25th
Mesori in the 15th year of the father of Tekelut IL, omething Im-
