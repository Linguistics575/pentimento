behind which are painted four f1garas, viz. Ptah (to the left), Am-
mon in blue, King Ramses, and Harmachis. No one should omit
to enjoy the mysterious effect of the interior view of this temple,
with its eight 0siris-istataas, as seen by the light of torches or a
magnesium-lamp,

We now climb over fallen stones and heaps of sand to the smaller
temple, which lies a little to the N.

The *Smaller Rock Temple of Abu-Simbel lies close to the river,
The eliif has here been smoothed for a breadth of 90 ft. to make
room for the facade of this attractive temple of Hathor, which in
modest contrast to Ramsee'e huge monument, will not fail to pro-
duce a satisfactory impression. The six statues on the faeade do
not project boldly like the colossi of the great temple, but stand in
niches supported on projecting pillars. Moreover it is not only the
king that is here represented; to the right and left of him stand
female figures equally large in which we recognize his consort No Â»
fertari hferienmut, The latter holds a. sistrum in her hand and wears
a double headdress with home twisted round a disc, such as is worn
by Hathor, goddess of love, whose representative the queen is. The
itgaras at the corners represent Ramses again; on the left in his
usual form with a dagger in his girdle, and on the right as e deiw
tliyd king, with a crown consisting of the double feather springing

from the sun, and the twisted heme. Besides the six co-

lossi there are a number of much smaller statues of the children of
the king and queen. Beside the eolossi on the right and left of the
door are the two eldest sons of the king, viz. (on the right) Amenhi-
khoparhf (Ammon in his sword) and (on the left) Rahiuanemif (Ra at
his left hand); beside the enter colessi are the princes Meritum
(right) and Merira (left); and beside each of the colossi of the queen
are statues of the princesses Meritamon (right) andHonttaut (left),
with sistra in their hands. The first and third pillars on the right
bear interesting inscriptions:'He (the king) has made the temple

in an excavation (Kshes) in the mountain, in everlasting

The Main Hall is practically the only one in this temple, as the
rooms behind are merely its dependencies. It is 34 ft,, deep and
27 ft, broad, and has six pillars in two rows, each decorated with
