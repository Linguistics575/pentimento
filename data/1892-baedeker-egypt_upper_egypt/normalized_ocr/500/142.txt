Diimiehen as Room of Ptsrifeation, It was probably used in the
preparations for the festival ceremonies that took place in the ad-
joining Hall of the Altar; and among Its inscriptions in honour
of Hathor is one that seems to indicate that the temple at Denderah
is to be regarded as a replica of a celebrated temple of the sun-god
of Heliopolis, of which however no trace now remains. Here a
reference is made to the gilding and painting of the sculptured or-
namentation, which are so often mentioned in the inscriptions.
A careful examination of the walls in some of the rooms will still
detect traces here and there of this painting.

The whole of the sculptures and inscriptions in this room refer to
Hathor in her capacity as goddess of light, who has her seat in the
sun's disc rising from the horizon, and who was as such represented
under the figure of an hawk with a woman's head in the middle of
the disc rising on the sun-mountain, (With this we may compare
the representation of the goddess above the central portal in the
rear-wall, i.e, above the entrance to the Adytum A.)

repository for the sacred wreaths and garments, with which the
images of Hathor and her fellow-gods were adorned at the festivals
celebrated in the temple and sometimes at the great new year's
festival. According to the sculptures and inscriptions the prepared
perfumes were also placed here. One half of the room was devoted
to the garments, the other to the sacred perfumes. Over the latter
presided the divine Mazet, previously mentioned among the man-
agers of the manufacture of the incense and anointing oil as one of
the lords of the laboratory (p, 88); over the former Hathotep, god
of woven fabrics, with his companion the goddess Tai, held sway
The sculptured ornamentation on the walls is also arranged 1n har-
