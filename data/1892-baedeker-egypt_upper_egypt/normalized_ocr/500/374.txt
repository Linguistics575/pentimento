History. LOWER NUBIA. 301

War against the Beduine (emu hezut's0, having as allies various
msgro-tritrts, from the lands of Arth, Mara, Amam, Wawa, and
Kaau, as we learn from the inscription of Una (now in the museum
at Gizeh). The Wawa especially are often mentioned in the in-
seriptions as having been fought against and subdued by the Egyp-
tians .--- The powerful monarchs of the 12th Dyn. continued the
eenqueet of the S. Amenemha defeated the Wawa; and a son of
Userteeen L, as e stole now in Flerence records, overthrew seven
negro~trihes. Userteeen 111. advanced the boundary of Egypt to
Semneh; and we hear of a campaign directed against Kush in the
19th year of this king. His successor Amenemha III. recorded at
Semneh and at Kummeh, lying opposite, the height of the Nils,
which was then 25 ft. higher (p. 272) than at present. A king of

the 13th Dym, (G E2 Ra kha nefer, is mentioned on the is-

land of Argo, The kings of the 18th Dym, however, did most of
all to extend the Egyptian might in Upper Nubia. Amenhotep III.
led a proeperous expedition into the land of Abhet and took many
prisoners, He built a large temple "Napata, near the fourth
cataract, and adorned the temple" of Tutmee III. at Soleb. Both
there ehd on a statue of this king in the Louvre are recorded the
namhe of many conquered tribes of the S. The Egyptian governors
of theSe provinces now received the title of primes of Kush. The
victorious campaign of Ramses II. against the Ethiopians, and the
tribute paid by them in ebony; gold, and ivory, are not only de-
scribed by Herodotus (II, 110), but in the temple of Abu-Simbel
and in numerous tombs at Kumeh are depicted negrees as prisoners
and paying tribute. While Egypt was embroiled in internal dig-,
cords, an independent priestly monarchy established itself at Na-
pata beside the holy mountain (Gcbel'Barkal), where Ammon,
Muth, and Khunsu, the triad of Thebes, were worshipped. Numer-
ous buildings were reared of which traces remain to the present
day. We are unfortunately not yet able to decipher either the
peculiar hiprog1yphies or the demptie writing of the Kushitee, found
Side by side with Egyptian hieroglyphics on these monuments.
Some important etelee brought by Mariette from Gehel Berkel record
the victorious advance of the Ethiopian prince Piankhi into Lower
Egypt, hie defeat of several local kings (Tafnekht, Nimrod, (hor-
kon, etc.) probably set up bythe Assyrians, end his capture of the
city orMtsmphis. Shabako and Taharka, the successors of Pienkhi,
repeated his exploits, to the extent at least of making themselves
masters ot Upper Egypt, Thty founded the 25th Dyn., and'in that
way united the whole of Nubia with Egypt preper. Taherka, how-
ever, was defeated try the Assyrian kings Easrliaddost and Assur-
banipal (Sardanapalus), though after his death his sister's eon Ur-
damani (Nut-Amen) mainttfined himself for some time in Thebes
and even besieged Memphis. An end. was putte the Inde endence
