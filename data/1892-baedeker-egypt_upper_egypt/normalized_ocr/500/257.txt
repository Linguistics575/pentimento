194 Route 18. THEEES. West Bank:

of the antechamber has fallen in, and the sun lights up its walls,
which are covered with a variety of interesting representations.

On the fragment of wall to the left prince Anna is seen with his
wife Tuau sitting under a light pavilion, supported by a. pillar, which
shows that the etslyaeeapita1 belonged originally to wooden buildings,
and was'oniy adopted later in stone architecture. The pavilion has a
natural connexion with the picture of Anna's garden as he wee a zealous
planter of trees. A number of the tents'duti'iriii'iil by him are named,
and to this we owe our knowledge, o the names and characters of several
of the plants of ancient Egypt. On the long outer wall, on the ieft, we
see the noble Anna again, this time standing upright, in full emoyment
of his rank, while receiving the different kinds of tributes for the store-
houses of Ammon, There are scribes to take down the amount of each
contribution, and even the number of strekes which are'utiiieteil upon a.
debtor,, From Ethiopia there is a variety of contributions to be received,
including negress slaves carrying their children in baskets on their backs,
ivory, ebony, apes, panther-skins, etc. The Asiatiee bring iapis-1azuli, etc.

On the same outer wall bat to the right of the spectator Anna is
seen again, but this time in company with his united family. His hound
is standing below his seat, while oatriehee, wild assets, B kind of wild
goat, and other goats and cattle of various kinda and colours are being
brought to him. One man brings'rows of pomegranates etc. on strings.
The interior of the tomb is small, but is not without interest, especially
from the abundant list of offerings on the right wall from which alone we
learn the names of five kinda of wine and two kinds of beer. On the
left wall is the eountry-homus and garden of the deceased; two women
are standing at the door, probably his wife and his mother. tn the back-
ground Anna is sitting with his wife before a richly furnished table of
offerings. Opposite to him is seen his eoffin bein drawn along, and the
weeping women throwing dust on their heads, gust as may be seen in
Egypt at the present day. The innermost room of No. 26 together with
the shaft has been filled up with stones, and all that can be recognized
of its paintings is the back of an enormous Apep serpent, the enemy of
the Bun-ship of Ra.

We notice the two long galleries to the left with numerous en-
trances but without any remarkable tombs, and ascend again to the
right to No, 16, a tomb well worth seeing, belonging to Eoremhob,
who seems to have held a series of oftituss, especially that of overseer
of the cattle, in the successive reigns of Tutmee II. and III., Amen-
hotep IL and 111., end Tutmea IV., of the 18th Dynasty. Close to
it is the tomb (No. 17) of Tannin, a fen-beerer on the king's right
hand, and adjoining this, but turned towards the N., the tomb of
Amenophia (No. 102), second Prophet to Ammon, and of his wife
Roi. The paintings in this contain a scale in which gold rings are
being weighed, various workmen, one of whom is making a aphinx,
clerks with tables writing out the crops, and a statue with a ram'e
head; on the right music and dancing.

A little higher to the right is the tomb of Zumni (No. loo, Cara
should be taken at the entrance, to avoid falling into the deep shaft.
The paintings represent Retennu bringing presents in gold, silver, lapis-
lazuli, end emeralds.

We have now almost reached the summit of the hill, and can
enjoy the magnifietsnt Wiew including the Remesseum, the Memnon
statues, and on the other side of the Nile Luxor and Karnak; to the
right below the hills is seen the temple of Dir el-bahri, end the

path leading to the Tombs of the Kings. We now descend past
