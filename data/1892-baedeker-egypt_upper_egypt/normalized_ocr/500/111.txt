on the throne of Osiris. In front of him stands Horus,'the uveng√©r of
his father', investing him with immortality, while behind is the jackah
headed Apheru (Anubis), ready to protect him from danger. Above the

lasting life, In the chapel itself the representations are very numerous.
The king, in one, appears as a Sphinx, resting on a base bearing the
names of six nations that he has conquered. A somewhat singular scene
represents tstandard-bearers with the eneigns of the names, peraonifying
the emblems of life, constancy, and power in threefold repetition; these,
like the inscriptions between the tstaztdard-ptutus, teach us that Beti wee
endued with courage, length of days, uninterrupted safety and strength,
victory, abundance, and the kingdom of Egypt for life. It would be weari-
eeme to enumerate the multitude of other inscriptions of a. similar teneer.
Among the 22 representations in the king'ts chapel, many of which are in
a very dilapidated condition, the most noteworthy is one in which the
king appears on the throne of Osiris, embraced by the goddesses Nekheb
(Eileithyia) and Buto. Thoth and Horus draw tighter the stems of the
plants aymbolising Upper and Lower Egypt, which enfold the sign of union

sam. Safekh, the goddess of history, behind Thoth, inscribes the name

of the king. In another scene Seti It seated on a throne supported by
three flgures in the form of Horus an three in the form of Anubis. Thr.
der a canopy adorned with Urmus~serpenta appears the state barge of the
king, robably a representation of the vessel kept In this temple ind borne
On hig in the processions. Similar representations of the ehi in which
the Sun-God was supposed to traverse the heavens have been'ound made
of bronze or the precious metals, and may be seen in the museum at Gizeh
(see Baedeker's Lower Egypt) and elsewhere. Below are canopi (Vol, T, p. 301),

observe that everything here refers to the king, whose name recurs in weeriw
soree iteration, and who here receives hack again as Osiris the oiftrings

future self, the osirirapotheoa'is of his soul.

A door in the Osiris Chapel (Pl, ts), the third from the right wall, leads
to the r6ar-gtrtgetarty (Pl. E) mentioned at p. 62. Though the structure is
in a very ruinoua state, its ground-plan can easily be made out. A colon-
msde, the roof of which, once supported by 10 columns, has fallen to the
ground, stood in direct connection with the Osiris chapel. It contains "re-
presentations, some of which are almost wholly tsff'aetu1. By the wall, to
the right on entering, lay three small chambers adorned with thys soul ture.
The first of these (P1. i) is dedicated to Horus, the second (Pl.k) to siris,
the third (P1. I) to Isis. Behind them lay another room (Pl. IO,, In the
wall to the left on entering Room E is a door leading to a room (PI, m)
with four culumns, which was adjeined by three smaller apartments (Pl. n,
e, p), Though the most sacred mysteries were celebrated in this suite of
moms, they offer little thatie novel; the implements of the prieste were
kept in the tside-rooms. Here, no doubt, many a spectacle was prepared
Which, when dismayed in the Ogirie chapel, t111ed the pious worshippers
with awe and wonder.

qptHTW- This building consists of a series of rooms, all more or less
ruinous and most of them roofless, a court, and some smaller
chambers. The most important, to which a visit should be paid,
even if all the others be omitted, is a long (65 ft.) and low Corridor

between the second and third row of columns. The flat ceiling is
adorned with a rich network of ornamentation, combining the, name
