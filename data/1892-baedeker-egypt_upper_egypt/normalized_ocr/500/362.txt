lemy IX. Euergetes IL, though the later Lagidze and Tiberius also
contributed a. share..

The vestibule here is loftim' than the other roams of the calla. The
entrmee was adorned by Philometorg but the: numerous interior reliefs
represent Tiberius before the diiTeresit deities of the tcm 1e. The carefully
elaherated doorway at the hack of the pronaas dates mm Euergetes It,
The firgt room is quite unademed. Above the door to the second room
is a window, bordered on each side by two Hathor-mesks. Tiberius is
named several times on the waits, whieh have been partly plastered ever
with mud. The early Christians, who perhaps used the second room for
pumasea connected with their services, have: entirely plastered over the
heathen Inscriptions there; while the highly interesting Representation: in
the third room have been left quite untouched. From these we learn that
the temple was intended to represent the Birth-Eouae or Meghan, in
which the infent H me first saw the light (similar buildings at Denderah,
Edfu, ete., pp. 80, My The reliefs on the rear wall are in two sections.
The lower series represents the Birth of Harm, who is introduced into
life by Ammon, Thoth, and other gods. In the u per row we see Hume

ceiling round a column tsdorrieil with 1otwrflowems, beneath which kneel
two forms, covered with the Urteurhood, The allegorical meaning of
this! latter composition is obscure. On the W. wall of the chamber is
B Goddess (head destroyed), offering the breast to the new-born child, and
eloae by is Hathor, the good fairy of Egyptian nurseries, placing her
teft hand in benediction on the head of Home, and holding his arm
with her right, King Ptolemy IX. Euhrgetea IL is depicted handing
to her two metal-mirrors'to rejoice the golden One with the sight of her
beautiful form', - These representations do not only celebrate the mystic
biith of the god, they refer also to the meat beautiful and must responsible
duties of motherhood, which Isis, Rather, end. Nephthys undertake. Their
nurslin appears indeed to be the infant Horns, but it is evident from
many a lusions, that the young Pharaoh, the heir to the throne of Ra,
was considered as the incarnation in human form of the young god, and
that these representations were meant to convey to the Ptolemies that a deity
had home and suckled them or, their fhzt-born, and that the immortele
had guided their upbringing with invisible hands. Cleopatra 1., the mother
of the two brothers who caused the placing of this inscription, had acted
as guardian and regent especially during the childhood of Philometor, the
elder. She was the Isis of the young Horus. On the B. outside wail of
the cella a relief shows us Horus learning from the goddess of the N.
to play on the'ttine-ii-d lute, while Isis superintends the lesson. The
shape of the instrument is Greek, and by the goddess of the north is
perhaps meant Hellenic music, which was cultivated even by the earlier
Lagidae. C _

Ail the Inscription: here date from Tiberius, who is named'Autoktator
Wvsres' on the E. side and'Tiberius' 0n the w,, side. A double votive,
inscription of the same date proves that the former phrase applies to
Tiberius. _'" _

only on Philae, consisting of a bunch of papyrus-buds, supporting
