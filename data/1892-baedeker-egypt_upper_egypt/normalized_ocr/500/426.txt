describes it as being without inscriptions or representations, though
Hoskine reports otherwise. In the N. and S.W. angles are two separate
spaces with double chambers, one above the other, The next room is
the most remarkable part of the temple. This is the 8aeriJicial Chamber,
a narrow apartment with a. row of four columns supporting the roof,
while four others are engaged in the entranety.wali. The builder was
Darius, who is here named in a secund eartouehe,'the beloved of Ammon
of Hib, the strong-sworded', whilst elsewhere he is usually styled'the,
beloved of Ra and Ammon' (see below), On the inside of the entrance-
wall, to the right, the king is shown kneeling and presenting two vessels
of wine, before the ratn's-headed Amman, lord of Hib, Muth, and Mouth
Two finely carved lines ot hieroglyphies beside this scene state:'This is
Amman of Ira, the great god, strong with the sword; may they (the gods)
grant constant peaceful life'. Beneath is the empty eertouche of the king.
On the left side the cartouche beneath a similar inscription is filled in
with the king's name; while the accompanying representation shows the
king presenting wine (of the oasis) to Osiris, Horus, Isis, and Nephthys.
The highly interesting inscriptions and representations on the walls of
the narrow chamber lend it a peculiar importance. Thus at the top, to
the left, of the S. wall is the Persian king in an attitude of worship,
presenting a rich offering to the deities, Between him and the gods is a
long list of offerings, in horizontal lines. Beneath this scene, and be-
ginning in the NIH. corner, is a Sang of Praise, composed by the king in
honour of the Bun- od He. in very pantheistie terms. This song, in
46 lines, wee flrgt pu lished after copies by Robert Hay, the companion
of Hoskins, and translated by S. Birch (Transactions of the Bibl. Arch.
Society, Vol. V, London 1876), then more completely by Brugsch in his
'Reise mach der greBen Oase' (pp. 276 eeq., Plates 3.1V, xxv-xxvu). On
the E. Wall (back-wail) are tsaeri'ikial scenes on both sides, corresponding
to each other, to Ammon-Ra, Math, and Khunsu. Amman has the ram's
head like the god of the Oasis of Ammon. Towards the N.W. corner of
this wall is a mystic inscription, with the title above it:'The mysterious
sayings of Ammon which are on the tables of multserry-wood.' This text
refers to the secret character of Ammon, the pantheistie god of the oasis,
whose eraeular importance appears from the pass e'his voice is heard,
but he is not visible to all who draw breath' (line J. On the door-pests
on each side of the entrance to the next room is an inscription in the
so-ealled enigmatic (is. secret) characters, of which a duplicate is found
on the outside of the S.W. wall of the temple. This next room has four
columns, and on each side are two side-rooms. The builder was again
Darius. The central door in this room admits to the Sanctuary, the small
door on the right to another room, which evidently was once connected
with the sanctuary, for the mystic representations of the two rooms, as
reported by Hoskins, are parts of one whole. The partition-wall must
be a later addition. The door to the left admits to a staircase, leading
straight on to a crypt, and ascending to the left to the Osiris, rooms,
Which are on the temple-roof as at Philaa, Denderah, and Edfu. Upn
posite the last flight of steps is a fhtely-exeeuhed inscription:'List of
the tsaerif1eiys made by King Darius in the golden hall for Amman of
Bib, the great god, strong with the gword', Another list beneath
contains a catalogue of the gaeriiieial wines from the various districts
of Egypt; at the top the Wine of the Oasis. Of the three Osiris
rooms, the middle one contains the most interesting representations.
At the top of the N,, well is Osiris lying 0n abier, beneath him are four
eauopi, to the right Isis and Nephthys; in the section below the Dead
Osiris lies on the ground with Isis and Nephthye kneeling beside him.
The latter are represented as saying:'Thou art in millions of years,
thy soul is raised to heaven with the soul of Re. I am the light by day,
thou art the moon at night', To the right is the bull Apia, running with
the Osiris-mummy on its back, to the left is a frog (haht) es the re-
presentative of Osiris. At the ottom is Osiris resting in the grave e3
