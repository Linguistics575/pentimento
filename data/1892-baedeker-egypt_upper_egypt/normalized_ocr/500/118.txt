where, too, some stones bearing the cartouches of Ptolemy Philometor
project from the ground in a clear space. Nothing of interest is to be
seen here except one of the largest and oldest lebbek-trees in Egypt.
The extensive cemetery contains numerous Cutie inscriptions. Hiero Â»
glyphic inscriptions have been found in grottoes in a hill to the W. of
the town.

Kagr eeljhri'ydd (mail steamer station) marks the site of the an-
eient Ghenohoskion, which is mentioned by Ptolemy, hy Stephanus
of Byzantium, and in the Itinerary of Antonine, and belonged to
the Nomos Panopolitea No remains are visible except a few frag-
ments of the riverwall, with an unimportant Greek inscription of the
Roman period. It owes its name, meaning'geese pasture' (Xma-
Bocxefov, Copt. genecn'r, from the ancient Egyptian Geese lake),
to the fact that immense quantities of geese, a favourite food and
iuu3rifuia1 offering of the old Egyptians, were reared here. Its pro-
pinquity to the home of Menes (Tlhi'sr-A1ysdois) makes it seem quite
natural that graves of hear antiquity (6th Dynasty) should be found
in the neighbourhood. These are reached from the village of Keg):
ee-Saiyed in about 11/4 hr. Donkeys, but no saddles, may be ob-
tained, through the Shekh er-Beled. We ilrist ride through a well-
tilled district, cross a bridge over a canal Which waters the district,
pass the village of Isbah, and reach the Arab hills, The ancient
tombs, constructed of light-coloured and unusually fine-grained
limestone, now come in sight; they date from the reigns of Pepi,
Merira, and Raneferka, all of the 6th Dynasty. The large tomb
situated farthest to the left contains representations and inscriptions
which are identical in style with those in the most ancient part of
the Neeropolis of Memphis, The ceiling was leftrough-hewn. Some
of the small inscriptions cut in the living reek near the entrance
are in Coptic. The representations on the inside of the entrance-
wall have been almost wholly. destroyed, but some ships may be
distinguished to the right of the door. On the right wall are figures
bearing funereal gifts and a large gaerifieia1 table. The rear-wall
is divided into two distinct portions, as the left side" of the tomb
has been pushed much farther into the rock than the right. In the
latter are two niches. That to the right contains an image of the
deceased, one of the chief dignitaries under the Pharaoh Raneferka,

named Zuta ie, tsas,. From the second niche, farther

to the left, a mummy-shaft descends obliquely; adjacent is a Oop~
tie inscription. In the deeply recessed rear-wall of the left side
are four smaller niches, probably intended for the cofiins of members
of Zuta's household deemed worthy of special honour.'t.iBttH The next
tomb, farther to the right, is of even greater interest than the one
just described. It belonged to an ofNial named Aikhenu, who lived
in the reigns of Pepi, Merira, and Raneferka, and was not only ere'
gaged in the construction ofthe pyramids of these monarchs, but was
also a distinguished warrior. The pyramids were muntriP0aoi1 Platte',
