below, is en > inscription of 131inee, of which the 8th and 9th

name in honour of Ammon-Ra, the lord of heaven, etc. It speaks
of'the voyage on the sea, the beginning of the great journey to

Ta neter, i, e, the holy lend, the happy arrival in Arabia of

the soldiers of Pharaoh, the lord of the world, according to the
command of Ammon, the lord of the gods', ete .--Another in-
scription between the trees, to which the heat is fastened, tells us
that Punt as well as Arabia Petreea was dedicated to the goddess
Hathor, To the left of the two ships are 10 lines describing by name
the different kinds of wares which sailors, are carrying on board along
narrow planks.'Loading of the ships with untold quantity of
valuables from Arabia, precious kinds of wood from the holy land,
heaps of the grains of ineisniur-gum (kemi-ent-anta) t, Nehut trees
of fresh inearisa-grains (ante), ebony (hehni) for sacred vessels with
gold and silver from of the land Ama (Asia), Deas H", and Khesit-
wood, possibly cassia-bark, grains of Ahem ttt, incense and cos-

of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks'.
Except these last named birds all the treasures may be seen on the
