daughter of the Kheta prince, followed by her father. Since her
name (Ra-mawua'rneferu) is enclosed in a royal eartouehe, it is
probable that she became the legal wife of Ramses. Friendly rela-
tions with the Kheta prince Khetasar were established in the 21st
year of the king's reign by the peace mentioned at p. 142. Beside
it is a small tablet of the general Amenhi, with the prince Seti, the
king's mother Tua, and the princess Bant-an.ta, Farther back (to-
wards the E) is another large stele, with the winged eunmdiee hem
neath which Ramses the Great is shewn before Ammon with the
double crown, before Harmachia (Her akhuti, Horus of the two

horizons), and before Home, lord oiuajif" Is MM, the great

god, In the following 23-lims inscription the king, who spreads
abroad fear and terror, annihilated the land of Kush, and subdued
the land of Kheta, is compared to the gods Horus, Mentu, and Seth.

Immediately to the left of this passage a rock-chamber was dis-
covered in 1874 by a party of travellers including Miss Amelia
B. Edwards, the well-known writer, who has described it in her
interesting Thousand Miles up the Nile, The first chamber, 25 ft.
deep, is achoined. by another rock-cave, 15 ft. deep and 21 ft,
broad. This little Temple was dedicated by Ramses to Theth and
Harmaehis, the former of whom is here called lord of Khmunu
(Herm0polis Magma) in Amonhari (perhaps a name for Ahu~Sim-
bel). Both gods are represented in golden coloured dhahablyehs,
before which the king stands worshipping (to the left the boat of
Theth, to the right that of Ammon-Rs). The name of Usertese'n II.

C) fi2 (it Ra-kha-kheper (12th Dyn.), a king celebrated in Nubia,

is also found here. The theory that this was the library of the king,
of which Thoth was president, is unfounded. Still farther to the left
are a. number of steles incised in the rock, some of which are difii-.
cult to reach, One of them dates from Seti II. The farthest to the
left is a double stele ot the 38th year of Ramses IL, inscribed by a
prince of Kueh named Setau.
