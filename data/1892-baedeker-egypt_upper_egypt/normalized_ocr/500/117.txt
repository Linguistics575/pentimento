Between Beliitneh and Kenoh the Dam Palm (Hyphaana the-
baica) becomes more and more common, generally occurring in
groups and increasing in size and beauty as we travel southwards
(comp. p. 28). It is a fanvleaved palm of moderate height, dividing
into two parts at the upper end of the stem and sometimes repeat-
ing this bifurcation two or three times. It extends far to the S. of
Egypt, and whole forests of it are found on the upper Nile. Its
large nuts contain a soft and fibrous pulp, which is edible and
tastes like sweet cake; while various objects are made out of the
hard rind, Its timber and hast are also of considerable industrial
value.

The ancient Lepidotum must have lain on the E. bank of the
river opposite Beliéneh; but, though described by Ptolemy as a
large town, no trace of it remains. The Lepidotus (the Cyprinus
lepidotus of (hrotfros, and Cinex deutex of Savigny) was held here
in high honour, though, according to Plutarch, it was one of the
flshe8 that swallowed the Phallus of Osiris and was hence generally
regarded with special abhorrenoe.

From Ber1tmeh to Keneh the Nile valley lies almost due E. and
W. About 4 M. from the 8. bank lies Samhad, on ancient rubbish-
mounds. Nagi-Hamadi, also on the S. bank, 19 M. from Belfgneh,
is the station for Farshtt, 3 M. to the 8., now an uninteresting
village with a large'sugar-faetory belonging to the Khedive.

Bo late as the 18th cent. this was still the seat of the great shékh,
who was the head of the Favdris (pl, of Fgris, hero pron. Bavaria), or
tribes of mounted Arabs on the left bank of the Nile. The comparative
width of the rivar-plain makes horse-breeding an important occupation
among these tribes, and their shaggy grey dogs are also celebrated. The
lattars are frequently seen guarding the fioeks of sheep, and are easily
distinguishable from the worthless and cowardly ours that haunt the
streets of the towns and villages. When encouraged to attack by their

owners, these brave animals are exceedingly dangerous antagonists--

opposite one another, at one of the sharpest bends in the stream.
Illits, a large but miserable-looking village, was the home of Shékh
Selim, who died a few years ago, at a very advanced age, after
sitting stark naked on the bank of the Nile for 53 years; he was
regarded by pious Moslems with great honour and was deemed to
possess great powers in helping navigation and barren women. His
grave here is covered with Arabic inscriptions and votive gifts in
the form of small boats.

Those who wish to visit the scanty ruins of the ancient Dioupolil
Pans travorse the village in the direction of the mountains, cross two
doe ditches, near which stand the ilnely built piers of a ruined
bri go, and reach i26 min.) a. large mound of debris, known as Gebel Hor
