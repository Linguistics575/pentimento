round it were emeralds and other precioua stanea. The extent remains
date from a late period', a fragment bearing a royal cartouche appears to
date from Nectanebus L _

Minutoli farther mentions the cornerstones of a Girdle Wall near
the temple; they are still to be found at the ICE, angle. The girdle-wall
was 7'? paces long and M paces broad. It a erently belonged to the
second temple mentioned by Diodorus (see p., for in a pretty palm-
grove only about I [ 2 M, to the 8.E. of it is the Sun Spring, known also
to Herodotus av, 181). This Oval spring, about 110 paces in circum-
ference, is now called um Hammdm. The story of the peculiar properties
of this spring, repeated by all the ancient writers, in virtue of which its
temperature varied at different periods of the day, rests upon error. For
the water has a. uniform temperature of 731/2" Fahr., though it may Borne-
times appear warmer than it really is. in the often very cold nights,
while at midday it may seem almost cold in contrast to the heat of the
burning sun.

Rohlfs failed to find in Siweh any eonflrmation of the statements of
the natives, reported by St. John, that same of the houses rest upon
more ancient 1rui1dings.--To the N. of Mwah is the Gebel Matdh, or hill
of the dead, a. limestone hill about 150 ft. high and f800 yds. In circum-
ference, perforated with hundreds of vaults, graves, and catacombs.
Some of the vaults are large enough for a hundred or more corpses. All
the graves have been rifled, and heaps of skulls and shattered skeletons
lie around. Half way up the hill, on the E. aide, is a solitary tomb of
more pretensions, with its entrance adorned with pilaaters. Beyond a
fore-eourt is a spacious sepulchral chamber, with two sriile-raoms, and
adorned with a vivid green garland of vine-leaves on a blue ground. In
the background are some defaced chiselled figures. At Beled er-Ram, to
the W. of Siwah, is another cemetery excavated in a hill. Here also are
the remains of an ancient Egyptian temple (Kagr er-Rttm), 62 ft. long by

151/2 ft, broad, without any hieroglyphics. A little to the N, of this
temple are some scanty remains of a late period, on the hill Umthiea
(Two Columns). At Bat eZ-Medtneh, 3 M, to the SW. of Siwah, Rohlfs
discovered a marble ram, now in the museum at Berlin ,---' Lake of
Ara2htyeh, about BO M. to the N.W. of Siwah, is of little importance.
though the French colonel Berth; was induced by the wonderful tales of
the Arabs to bring a. boat for the purpose of exploring it.

and the Nile, the traveller should not omit to visit the Natron Eona-
Iteries. Leaving Stwah we journey via et-Fatah, (Umm erf..rghér, 2 days),
el-G'atarah, et-Libbah [ Bir Lebm, 3 days), and et-Mdghrah (1 day), and on
the eighth day reach the depression known as the Bale belah mdh or'River
without water', which has various branches, as e.gt. the Baler er2rdeir to
the s., in the direction of SatW'strah. Zittel and Jordan have demonstrated
that the valleys grouped under the name of Italy, belah math could never
have been occupied by side channels of the Nile as was at one time su -
posed. A somewhat stee slope separates this depression from the Wir i
Natriitt (20 M. long, II/e-ro M. broad), the district called Nitria 0r Nih'iotis
by the Greeks, where, according to Straho, Seraph was worshipped. The
