earth and all lands sing songs of praise. The praise of the king is
interwoven with the hymn to the sun:'Thou givest me honour
before the king all my days. A worthy burial after a long life in
this land of the light-region of the sun's disc was accorded to me.
I fulfill the span of my life. I fulfill my life in the completeness
of a servant of the good god, who is free to ascend every throne he
likes. I am a vessel of the king'. Then follows a list of the titles
ofrAahmes.'.' e

Tomb 6 contains representations of columns, the theft: of which
are encircled at regular intervals by rings resembling the tissue
enveloPing the joints of reeds. The capital consists of several erect
bell-flowers, with dependent buds held together by a ring,

The Tomb ofuhua (No. 7), the keeper of the treasury, also
eontains'm'uch that is interesting. The Temple of the Sun, on the
right wall of the iirtst chamber, has already been mentioned. The
king is shown seated upon a 1io, a-guardei1 throne, illuminated by
the solar rays, and borne-by several courtiere. Before and behind
are no-hle youths'with large and small fans. The same'chamber
contains another striking and we11-prtuserrpil scene, representing
the studio of the sculptor Auta, director of the portrait-sua/ss
(lit.'givers of life') of the king'tfinother Tii. A wellnexeeuted
statue of this powerful but unlovely princess is being coloured
by the master himself, while two younger sculptors (jr-ankh) give
the f1ni'tshing touches to the head and legs. The gaeriiityiat1 scenes
are of the usual type. WMtWMtm= The name of Khu, -en-stam has been. almost
everywhere obliterated from the cartouehes. The solar disc with
the arms? uppeers frequently as a kind of talisman, sometimes above
the single hieroglyphies. While demanding devoted loyalty from
his subjects, the king seems to have enjoyed the most effeetionate
and. happy relations with his wife and daughters, in whose names
we recognise an. echo of his own (Aten). The wife is named'Beauty
of the Solar Disc, the beauteous Dame Att'; the daughters are Merit
Aten, the darling of the sun; Aten makt, the ward of the sun;
Ankh-s en pa Aten, she who lives through the sun; Aten neha' ta
shera, beauty of the sun; the little Aten bekt, servant of the sun,
and so on. Tii, the mother of the king, is already known to us
(see above).

The S. Tombs, 11/4~11/2 hr. from the N; group, are not so well
preserved. The graves formerly tytooi1 open, and only those parts
under'cover have escaped serious injury. In 1883 Maspero dug
deeper into the already opened graves, and opened some for the
flrist time, such as that of Maha (p. 27). The cartouehee of Khan
t3nmmateIt are not scratched out in the newly uncovered tombs. Of
special interest me the recently discovered vaulted passages with
steps, leading downwards, which are unlike any other Egyptian
construction. I tie evident that these were the actual burial-pl-tr.
Skulls of bodies which had not been embelmed have been found
