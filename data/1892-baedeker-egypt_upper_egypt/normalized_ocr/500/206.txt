of Khumm (Pl. V), the portal of which we have already seen on our
way from Luxor to the river-front of the great temple of Ammon,
An avenue of ephinxes, approximately parallel with the above-men~
tioned avenue between Pylon XI and the temple of Muth, leads to
the slender Ptolemaic Pylon XII and beyond it to the temple of
Khunsu preper, which lies a little farther N,, The temple is beauti-
fully proportioned, in many places adorned with remarkable care,
and in various respects of great interest. It was erected by Ram-
ses III. in honour of Khumu, Le. the god who represents, so to
speak, the youthful Ammon in the triad of Thebes. Elsewhere, it
may here he noted, Khuneu is conceived of almost as the moon-god
(with the child's lock of hair on his temple and the crescentwmoon
on his head), and thus identified with Thoth-Hermes. Just as
Amman is called the soul of Ra, so Khnnsu is to be regarded as the
spiritual quintessence of the earlier moon-god, and may be named,
like Thoth,'the representative of the spirit, the ratio intema of all
things', As Pa ar sekher or'pun-maker' he guides the deliberations
of mortals, and he becomes also the divine physician (Khunsu nefcr
hotep,'the good helper'), who eonsiderately restores the sick to
health. Oynocephali, sacred to Khuneu as well as to Thoth, were
kept here .--In the great Harris Papyrus Ramses III. says of this
temple:'I built a house in Thebes for thy son Khunsu, of good hewn
stone, of sandstone, black stone, its doors covered with gold, adorned
with electrum like the celestial horizon'. In the same document it is
named Pa (house) Ramses halt an in Pa Khunsu with 264 persons;
and afterwards:'Persons whom he (Ramses III.) gave to Pa Khunsu
in Ca: Neferhotep, Hor lord of the wide heart, 2d9', There thus
appear to have bean two different temples erected to Khunsu. The
inscriptions inform us that he had not time to f1nissh the'House
of Ehunsa', but was obliged to leave later rulers to complete the
Peristyle Court and the Pylon. The last was erected by the priest-
king Pinozem, son of Pienkhi, of the 2ist Dyn.; but Alexander IL
is also commemorated in the doorway to the peristyle court. This
court itself has on three sides a. double row of papyrus-bud columns,
six in each row. From the inscriptions we gather that after por-
tions of this building were built by various Ramses of the 20th Dyn.,
the pritsst-king Herher, predecessor and perhaps grandfather ofPino-
zem, contributed to its decoration, Most of what we know of the
kings of the gist Dyn. is derived from the inscriptions here.

The close connection which must at that time have existed between
Asia and the Nile valley is proved by a Stale found in the temple of
Khunsu and now preserved in the Biblioth√©que kiiitiriui' at Paris. Upon
this one of the last kings of the 20th Dyn, records that he married the
daughter of a tributary prince, made her his queen, and in order to cure
her younger sister who was possessed by devils (Ce. insane) gent flrst a
ghysician and then a statue of'Khuneu to Bekhten. After the healing godhad

one what was expeeted ot him, the father-in-uw of the Pharoah detained

the statue until he was warned in a dream to send it back to Egypt in
its sacred boat,

The peristyle court is succeeded by a narrow flail, exgtending
