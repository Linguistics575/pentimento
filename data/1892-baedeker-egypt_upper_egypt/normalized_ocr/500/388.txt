Nobad king Silko met at Kalahsheh (p.308), who continued to rule
subject to Roman supremacy. Thus in the firat scene under the
door-1intal the Pharaoh is seen before two personagee, of whom the

first, an Osiris j ] d C', Petdgt ('he who belongs to Isis'), is de-
scribed as ma-Klum, Le. as dead, and is named q q Stand

BLBE'll"'":', bet, which is perhaps the ancient name of 1hsndilr,

and with the Her (nte het her) added tn the lowest repre-
sentation to the right, approaches also the modern name. Pethst
was probably a deceased native prince; and Pihar fl, k,, his

/
brother, who stands behind him wearing a Uramg-fillet and no
crown, was probably another. The latter stands in the recess at the
back of the cella before Isis, mistress of Abaton and Pilak. Like

Osiris Unnofer, arpes'gr/rar, un). m- We pass through the pylon and
flnil ourselves in front of the elegant facade of the temple, only
13 ft. wide, and crowned with, the winged eun-disc (behet) and the

symbols of endurance and fertility. Uza (eyes) are xepre~

sented on the abaci of the two columns with palm-capitals. To the
right and left of the central entrance (at the sides of which were
once probably balustrades, now destroyed) are crowned snakes
coiling round a staff, flowers, etc. The pillars to the right and left
