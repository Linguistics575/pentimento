top of the E. side, a. space 8 ft. high and 6 ft. broad, is occupied by a
long iutreription of a, lines, reported both by Ceiliiaud and Hoskine. In
this inscription, which dates from the 2nd year of the emperor Galba
t69 A.D.), Julius Demetrius, goverqor of the oasis, communicates the
answer of the provincial governor ttttig, Tiberius Julius Alexander, to
the complaints of the inhabitants of e oasis against the illegal exactinn of
taxes, etc., to the eli'ect that future extortion is forbidden under penalties
and that what has been unjustly exacted will be restored. On the left
side also, lower down, are some shorter Greek inscriptions. One of these,
by the general (Mpumy√©c) Postdoniua, dated the 7th Mekhir of the emperor
Tiberius Claudius, directs attention to a. decree by the provincial governor
Guam; Virgiliua Capito, inscribed below, This decree warns against pay-
ments to unauthorized extorters of money, and threatens the latter with
severe punishment, viz. the payment of ten timea the extorted mm as
penalty besides restitution fourfold to the victim .--Traces of an avenue
of sphinxea exist between the first and second gateways, which are 50 ft,
apart. Only a fragment of the left (8.) wing of the Second Gateway is
standing. Some crudely executed representations on its inner side depict
an unnamed emperor (the cartonche is empty) before Ammopla, Hath,
and Tum, lord of Hib (Le. tsl-EIA/J,, The Third Gateway, Ito ft,, from
the second, is still entire. It is 18 ft, long and nearly 20 ft. broad,
Beneath the cornice appears the well-known winged tnut-d'ise with the
serpents of both lands. The lintel below has two representations on the
right side: an unknown king before Ammon-Ba and Khnum, and then
before Barmachis; on the left the same king appears before Tum, then
before Ammon-Ra, Usz, and Month.

The next two fleldt, on the right and left are destroyed. Then on the
right, Darius IL (? 425-406 13.0.) (hi lih ou) appears thrice,

viz. before Anhor and Tefnut, before Isis and ephthys, and before Horus,
Isis, and Nephthys. On the left the same king apgears before Osiris,
Horst-isis, and Isis, then before Khnum, and f1naliy efore Thoth in Bil,
and the gods of his cycle. On the inside of this doorway Darius appears
0n the left with the figure of Me. before Ammon-Ra, lorti of Hib, and on
the right (where his name is almost illegible) before Ammon-Ra, the hue-
band of his mother, presenting to him two palm-treps Two vertical in-
scriptions on the exit from this pylon (right and left) are also noteworthy.
These refer to the above-mentioned Darius as'the beloved of Ammon-Ba,
Lord of Hib, the great god, strong with the sword', and continue:'He
has built the walls (amt) of good white stone for a meta (dwelling) of
the god, its doom of acaeia-wood, covered with Asiatic brass in excellent
enduring workmanship. May (the gods) grant him innumerable festival:
on the seat of Horus'. The desi s on the W. side of the pylon are no
longer distinguishable. About, ft. behind this third gateway is the
Fore-court, 52 ft, deep and 30 ft. broad, the front of which has fallen. It
contained four engaged columns, two at the front corners and two at the
sides, and had also a door on each side, of which that to the right (NO
is still entire. This latter hears the eartoueheg of king Nekhthorheb
(Neetanebua L), of the 30th Dyn. (378-364 3.0.), on the right before Tam,
on the left before Month. This king was the builder of the fore-court,
and his cartouches also appear on the side-dours in the following portal,
