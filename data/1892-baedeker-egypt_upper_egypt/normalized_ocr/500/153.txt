steamer station), now an'insigrtifleant village, occupying the site of
the ancient Apouinopolia Parva. According to Abulfeda (d. 1331)
this town was second in size only to 1? ossttt (Cairo), and was the
chief centre of the Arabian trade. To-day heaps of mine are the
only remains. A few stones with fragmentary inscriptions have
been built into the houses of the town; and the mosque contains
a basin formed of a single stone, with the name of Ptolemy Phila-
delphus upon it. A pylon, which stood here 30 years age but has
pow disappeared, bore a. Greek inscription, announcing that'Queen
Cleopatra and King Ptolemy, the great gods and Philemetors, and
their children dedicated the temple to the god Arueris and to the
deities worshipped along with him'. Ameris is the earlier Horus,
usually idtyntif% d by the Greeks with Apollo, whence the name of
the town Apollinopolis. The modern name 1.Ltlis appears to be

derived from the Egyptian lf if Kcslces. Near Senhur (E. bank),

smell temple of Isis, in which the Horus of Apollinopelis, Khem-
Min of Koptos, the triad of Thoes, TAmmorv-Ra, Math, and Khunsu),
and other gods, were also worshipped. To the E. of Senhur passes
the canal of Senhur (p. 98), which begins above Thebes and
extends N. to Keneh. In the 12th cent. 13.0. Kits was notorious for
the number of its scorpions. Numerous Christiane dwell here and
also in Nahddeh, en the W. bank of the Nile, about 3 M. to the ELW.
tGlptdeh (man-ist/lon'), with numerous dove-eotes, a Coptic and a
Roman Catholic church, has old and narrow streets, but presents
a picturesque appearance from the river. The traveller who lands
here near sunset on a Sunday or festival (recommended) will be
pleasantly surprised to hear the sound of chureh-bells. The churches
themselves are uninteresting. Great success has attended the
labours of Christian missionaries here and still more in Kile; and
a considerable proportion of the 00ptic community (including the
worthy and learned bishop of Kits) have embraced Protestantism.
The missionaries of the United Presbyterian Church of North
America have also had considerable success at Luxor, Esneh, and
other towns in Upper Egypt, their converts, however, being ex-
clusively from among the Copts, never the Mohammedane.
Demetrius IL, patriarch of the thrpts (d, 1870, excommunicated
both the converts and the missionaries. In 1 66 he instigated a
persecution of the proselytes, whom he sought to terrify by fines,
stripes, and imprisonment; and he destroyed the publications of
the missionaries (who have a printing-press of their own) wherever
he could lay hands upon them. The British and American consuls
thereupon interfered energetically on behalf of their fellow-
believers, and now the Coptic Protestants enjoy complete immunity
from every form of religions persecution.
