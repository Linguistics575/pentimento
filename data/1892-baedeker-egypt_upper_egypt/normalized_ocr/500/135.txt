lee, Augustus is constantly indicated by the accompanying ear-
touchee'Autokrator Kitret', The temple was probably built in the
unsettled times of the later Ptolemias, and the priests were there-
fore left in doubt whether to f111 in the cartouehee with the name of
Ptolemy or of Augustus.

The representations en the walls and columns, many of which
well deserve special attention, exhibit here also the Egyptian rater
worshipping Rather or some other of the divinities revered in her
temple. They illustrate several most remarkable ceremonies, which
the king performed according to the prescribed ritual in presence of
the images of the gods in the temple. We have seen reason to be-
lieve that the sculptured decorations of all the temple-eumbers
were executed about the end of the period of the Ptolemies and the
beginning of the Roman empire. (The eeulptures in some of the
chambers in the sunk-floor and in several of the higher secret ptur'-
sages, date from the reigns of Ptolemies X., XL, and XIII.) Yet in
spite of that, the entire adornment on the walleis arranged according
to early Egyptian patterns; so that the eeremoniee here depicted
were not firat introduced under the empire, and probably no Roman
emperor ever took part in these ceremonies in this temple of Hathor.
The walls of the temple at Denderah exhibit exclusively Early Egypm
tian Manners and Customs. What we here learn are the ceremonies
imposed by the priesthood on the early Egyptian monarch who de-
sired to worship the goddess. Thus in a representation to the right
of the entrance the king appears twice over in the same design.
First we see him, clad in a long robe and carrying a staff, entering
the hall, preceded by the priest wearing the panther-skin and
sprinkling incense on the burning ceneer. Next we see him tstand-
ing before the image of Rather, his robe laid aside; bending for-
ward he goes through the motion of cleaving the earth with the
short hand-plough in his hand, because it was an immemoriel
custom that the Egyptian king should turn the firat sod on the site
of a temple. (In the explanatory inscription here, as elsewhere,
this ceremony is named'hai ta', cleaving of the ground.) The king
also smote the first blow with the hammer at the laying of the foun-
dation-stone, and shaped the tirgt brick for the enclosing walls,
which were usually built of unburned bricks of Nile-mud dried in
the sun. All these ceremonies performed by early Egyptian monarchs
at the foundation of a. temple, are here faithfully recorded eeeording
to early models t both in visible shape and by explanatory in-
scriptions. They are also recorded in the lowest of the four rows
on the W. and E. exterior walls of the temple. In the temple of
Home at Edfu the king is represented performing similar cere-
monies.

Another picture, also referring to the founding of a temple,
appears on the immediately adjoining wall. Here he king once
more appears before Hathor, bearing in his'), y:,, q, ,t, it, I Sk' g-tool
