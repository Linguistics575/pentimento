8000, the other at 9000 men. The Egyptian chariots meet those of the
Kheta and their allies, who ride three in a chariot. Many of the enemy,
both Kheta and Libyans, have fallen into the water. To the extreme
right, above the blue-painted river, is the king in his chariot, addressing
gracious words to his officers, who count the severed hands and limbs of
the Kheta and Naherina before him and bring fettered prisoners. A narrow
strip below represents the chariot-fight. Beneath, to the left, is the
stockaded camp, into which, according to the adjoining inscription, the
enemy forced their way bat were repulsed by the single legion of Ammon,
commended by the king, who had been lulled into security by the false
reports of two spies, and had despatched several of his regiments in
another direction. In the picture to the right the king site upon his
throne, among his courtiers. To the right and left of the royal person is
the account of an event in the 5th year of his reign, already known to
us from the Ramesseum (p. 161). It relates that two Arabs (8113.811) enw
tered the Egyptian camp, pretending to be refugees from the Kheta, and
seeking service under the Pharaoh,, They stated that the Kheta lay at
Khirabu (Helbon tie. Aleppo) to the N, of Thunep, and were in terror of
the Egyptians. This information was false, and the two agies were flogged
(in the lowest scene to the right), in order, as the inscription saye, that
they might say where the miserable Kheta lurked. The spice were next
brought before the king on his golden throne, and eroea-examined, and
iina1ly confessed that the Kheta, with numerous allies, lay behind Kateeh.
The king assembles his generals, relates what the spies have told, chides
hie offierg for being so imperfectly informed, and orders the recall of the
troops that had been sent elsewhere. lie himself puts on his armour,
attacks the enemy, slaye them, and throws them into the river.

Two pictures on the hack CW.) wall of this main hall show the king
presenting the enemies in fetters to the gods On the left are two rows
of negroee and Nuhiena before Ammon-Ra, the deifled image of the king,
and Muth; on the right the Asiaties (Hittites) before Harmaehia, the
flgure of the king, and e lion-headed goddess (Sekhet). The adjoining in-
scription runs:'Bringing of the tribute by the good god (ta. the king)
for his father Ra, when he came out of the land Rheta, annihilating the
rebellious lands and smiting the enemies in their dwellings, with silver,
gold, kheebet (laptrhwnsri), mafek (malachite), and precious stones, es
the conquest of every land had been commended him'. Between the two
last pillars in this hell ig a stele of the 35th year of Ramaee IE, on which,
beneath a relief, is a long decree in favour of King Ramses, issued by
the god Ptah Totunen. This decree was repeated almost word for word
by Ramses III. on the pylon of the temple of Medinet Habu.

The other chambers of this temple are less interesting, and
their examination is rendered troublesome by the swarms of hats
that fly against the lights. They contain only the usual scenes of
offerings, most of them tinfinisheil. As the accompanying plan
(p. 332) shows, two parallel chambers (P1. o, N) run "from the
N, side of the main hall, while from the ends of the back wall lead
two oblique passages (PI. K, G), from each of which run two parallel
chambers (Pl. L, M, and P1. B, 1). Round the walls of these latter
chambers run stone benches, less than 3 ft. high. In the S.W.
chamber (Pl. 1) is the picture of an altar with a hieratie inserip-
tion. Directly behind the main hall (Pl. F) is a smaller hall (Pl. E;
36ft. broad, 26 ft. deep), with four pillars. On the N. and & walls
are depicted the boats with the shrines of Harmaehis and Ammon,
borne in each case by 20 priests. Three doors lead hence to a long
narrow chamber (Pl. B), at the back of which are three recesses
(Pl. A, C, D). In the central recess, the sanctuary st d elm,
