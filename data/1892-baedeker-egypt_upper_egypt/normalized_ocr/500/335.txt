The place suffered greatly at the hands of the Blemmyes, but be-
came the seat of a Christian bishop, and appears to have rapidly regained
its prosperity under the Khalifs, Leo Africarms (14th cent.) saw here some
towers of unusual height, which can only be regarded as the pylons of
some large temple, as they were named Barba by the natives, a name

To the S. and N. of the landing-plaee, at which various craft
are always lying, two tdifletys project into the river. One of these
is a ruined Arabian fort, the other a ruined building, probably a.
bath, for which stones of earlier buildings have been used, and
dating more probably from the Khalifs than from Roman times.

heaps of rubbish, a dark gray clay wall, and a pure white minaret.
Huge granite cliffs rise from the stream. To the Wt. lies the green
and fertile island of Elephantine, shaped like the head of a lance,

the S., are some huge empty graves of saints. Everywhere the eye

with the 3rd year of his adopted successor Ueertesen IL, and one
from the 5th year of the same king, In both the latter a certain
Mentuhotep is mentioned. There is also a stele of the 10th year of
Usertesen III. and one with the name Neferhotep, of the 13th Dy-
nasty. Another important stele, dating from the flrst year of Tut-

mes II. (E) a ti) id), contains a detailed report of the conquest



, The remains of two other temples are described in the Description
de I'Egyphe, but both have now disappeared. One was a tetrastyle Por-
tico, the other a 190.11, dedicated by the emperor News to the gods of
Aaailatt, Khnum, Satl, Anuke, and Nephthye, and to Osiris, Isis, Sebek,
and Hathor. Champollion saw the latter'in 1829.
