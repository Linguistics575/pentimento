distinguished for the beautiful modelling of the kings horses dash-
ing into the fight, and for the representation of the Asiatic fortress
of Tapura, which is stormed by the Egyptians on sealing-ladders,
while the defenders are hurled headlong from the hattlements. Se-
veral sons of the Pharaoh, the names of whom are given, distinguish
themselves in the battle. Two of these (towards the left) are de-
picted on a larger scale than the others, viz. Kha-em-us, the favoa-
rite son of Ramses, and Menth, prince of the blood, each of whom
is in the act of slaying an enemy. The younger princes, Meri-Amen,
Amen-em-ua, Seti, and Setssp-en-Ra, covered with their shields,
take part in the attack (below the fortress). Diodorus apparently
had this scene in his mind when he described the Egyptian army as
commanded by the sons of the king.

The reliefs at the side of and above the portal (adorned with
the concave cornice) in the Rear Wall are in good preservation.
Each pillar is divided into four iieia, In the first (top) i1ty1ds the
king is shown offering to Sour-Osiris (on the left) and to Ptah (on
the right); in both the second tle1iis he olfers gaerifiets to Amman
Generator; and in the third to Ammon-Ra as king of the gods (left)
and to the same god as lord of heaven (right), From the fourth
fialdts we learn the use to which the following rooms were put; on
the left is enthrened the ihisr-heailed Thoth-Hermo, god of wisdom
and of writings; on the right (opposite) is Safekh, goddess of history

(recognizable by the (u, h above her head), named here'the king's

mother Sefekh, the great mistress of book-writing', At the foot is
the dedicatery inscription, informing us that the king erected this
palatial building to his father Ammon, king of the gods and lord
of heaven, prince of Thebes. qmBriBrimBm On each side of the door is a pro-
cession of youthful forms, with the lock of hair hanging to the side,
peculiar to the royal children. Their left hands are raised, and their

right hands hold the hgrdsman's crook T, the symbol of princely

dignity, and the fan, the symbol of taturt-rtrtlr. The list to the

right is the more complete; but at the and of the procession en the
left two princesses appear, who are wanting in the other,, Over the
ilrst figures but applying equally to the others appear the full titles
of Egyptian royal princes, The first is as follows:'The fan-b-
at the right hand of the king, the prince and royal scribe, the leader
of the army, tho great (Ur) son of the king, the ilrgt-born of his
body, his beloved Ameri-hi-hh-hr'. While this son is named the
(great) son of the king, the next one, Rameseu, is called the (great)
son of the lord of both worlds. The third prince, Ra-hi-ueuemif
(Ra at his right hand) is named master of the horse and cherieteer.
Fourth comes the king's favourite son, Kha~em-ue (se above), whoee
