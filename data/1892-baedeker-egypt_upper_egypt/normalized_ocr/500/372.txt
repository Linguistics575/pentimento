LOWER NUBIA
from Phila: to Wédi Ealfah.

217 M. The voyage from Phila: to Wadi { Iaifah was until about ten
years ago easily accomplished and formed an agreeable continuation of the
Nile-route, Travellers either caused their own dhahabiyehs to be towed
up the rapids (p. 273) or proeeeded in Cook's fortaightly toTtrigt-netsmer,,
Circumstances were, however, completely altered by the war in the Bildiin
and by the giving up of the region above Wadi Halfah in 1886. After, that
date the only means of ascending the Kile to Nubia was offered by the
weekly government steamer which conveyed the mails and military stores,
and performed the entire journey without stopping aaffieient1 long at any
intermediate point to allow of a visit to the monuments. In 1 90, however,
Mesgrg. Cook and Son again started aweekly service of steamers between
the firgt and second cataract. These'trtern-wheelertp (Smash, Ahkeh)
are small (12-14 passengers) and not very comfortable, especially when there
is a large party on board. The dining-tsaloon is over the stern-paddle,
the cabins are eonfhsed, and the commissariat limited. Halts are made
at comparatively few points, though it is possible to increase these by
arrangement with the engineer, if the passengers are unanimous. Zaptiyeh
or gens d'armes accompany the steamer to protect it, The voyage lasts
for T days, Le. P11in is usually reached again on the afternoon of
the 7th day. The inclusive fare la 30?... or 211. for those who have Mas
cended the Nile to Aatmtrn as Cook's tourists.

It is to be hoped that the region of the Upper Nile will soon be safe
enough to permit the voyage to be made t; dhehabiyehs once more. The
writer accomplished such a voyage in l 70, visiting all the important
monuments both going and coming. The eeet, including the towing of
the dhahabtyeh up the ttrat cataract, may be reckoned at about 1703. for
a arty at 4-5, which added te the mat of the journey (2 mohths) to Aa-
an n ir20t, gives a total 01'6201. for the 3 months journey; for il para.'NG,
