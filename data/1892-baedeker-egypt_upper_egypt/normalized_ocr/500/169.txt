114 Route 10. LUXOR. East Bank

celossi, and the various subsidiary details, is still not unimposing;
and the whole entrance to the temple at Luxor is unusually pie-
turesque, perhaps on account of the very abundance of small details
which are unrestrainedly placed here side by side with the huge
and dignified..

Beyond the principal pylon was the Great Periatyle Court (Pl. A),
which was entirely surrounded by a double row of columns (twelve
Emits on each of the four sides). It measures 185 ft. in length and

67 ft, in breadth. This hall was at one time completely built up, but
the W. side at least has now been laid bare. The most recent excava~
tions have revealed a portico, dating from Ramses IL, on the inner
side of the N.W. wall of the court. The architectonic purport of
this portico, which is somewhat lower than the court and has three
clustered columns, is not apparent. Between the inner row of co-
lumns on the & side of the court arrows and shields of Ramses II.
were placed. A mosque situated within this court prevents the ex-
eavation of the E, wall, and considerably mars the general effect,
Ramses II. founded the court, but the Ethiopian Sabako wrote his
name on the portal, while Ptolemy Philopator wrote his on several
of the abaci. On the S. side this court was terminated by a smaller
Pylon, beyond which, though not with the same 3ij (see above),
is a Colonnade (Pl. B), 58 yds, long, built under the 18th Dynasty.
The last ts in tolerably good preservation and contributes essentially
to the dignified appearance of the ruins of Luxor when viewed from
the river-bank or still more from the Island crossed on the way to
visit the monuments of W. Thebes. Seven couples of columns,
nearly 42 ft, in height, with calyx-capitals, still support a heavy
arehitrave above a lofty abacus. The whole was built by Amen-
hotep m., but King Horus, Seti L, and Seti II. have also recorded
their names upon it, The marvellous play of colour shown by this
colonnede with its deep, heavy shadows when the setting sun sheds
a rosy light upon the E. sky, is nowhere excelled. The Second
Periltyle Court (PI, 0) had double rows of columns on its N'" E.,
and W. sides. These, belonging to the order of sculptured paiiyrus-
bud columns, are specially effective as seen from the river-bank.
The court was 48 yds. long and 615 yds. broad, and ends in a Hypo-
style Halt (Pl. D), the roof of which was borne by 32 sculptured
bud-columns arranged in 4 rows of 8. The two sphiuxes at the Bn-
trance bear the name of Sebekhotep ll, (13th Dye.) This hall was
barely 20 yds. deep and 35 yds, wide, and for some unexplained
reason its E. wall forms an acute angle (instead of a. right angle)
with the 8. wall of the preceding peristyle court. The Open Space
(PI, E), which we next find, is entered from the river side, and is
specially commended to the traveller's attention. The ancient en-
trance to the tsanetuary-ehtunbers has here been altered into a kind
of upside ] recess, bounded on the right and left by two granite Go-
rinthian columns. The court in front of this was used a a church
