mummy was found in the region of the Apts-graves of Sehh√©rah.
There are in all 23 princes, of whom only the thirteenth need still be
mentioned. After the death of 12 brothers he ascended the throne
at a ripe age. As we may gather from the list to the left, this is
Mercnptah, frequently though inaccurately named the Pharaoh of the
Exodus, whose name as king was afterwards added in the cartouehe
above him, A similar honour naturally could not fall to any of the
other princes. 0n the columns appears Ramses ll, offering, gaerif1ees
to and receiving gifts from the'gods worshipped in the Ramssisistun',
conspicuous among whom are Amman in his various forms, Seth,
Thoth, Isis, Wi, Nut, Sekhet, etc.

The Second Smaller Colonnaded Ballon, D), with tout couple
of papyrus-bud columns, is remarkable for two features. The tirM;
is the roof richly decorated with astronomical representations, prov-
ing that the Rameeseum was a monument dedicated to the worship
of the dead. The second is a representation on the N,, part of the
reer-wall (the S. part is ruineti), which seems to support the tiattt-
ment of Diodorus that a sacred library was deposited in the tomb
of Osymsndyes, with the legend'Hospital for the soul' (tytnti'it
iatpeiov). The Pharaoh, with all the royal attributes, sits upon his
throne. At his side rises the leafy persea-tree, with hoart-shaptsi1
fruit, upon which the king's name is being written by three deities,
viz. to the left Tum on a lofty throne, to the right the goddess of
history, and behind her Thoth-mrmes, Behind Tum are the words:
'Address of Ammon-Tum, lord of the great hall (of Heliopolis), in
the Rarmstmsmn, to his son Ramses, the beloved of Ammon, Up, for
the distinguishing of thy name to all eternity, that it may be pre-
served on the sacred persea-tree'. In this hell also, on either side
of the door, is a procession with the sacred boats of'Muth, Khunsu,
the dtifltyi1 king, and his consort.

The following Room (PI, E) is much injured, though four co-
lumns are still standing. It contains lists of offerings, and a few not
uninteresting sculptures (ehitstly on the door-pillars), which seem
still farther to support the belief that we are now in the rooms of a
Library. The figures of the Theban triad are notunusual; butthe forms
of Sefekh, mistress of libraries, and Thoth-mrmes, the celestial
scribe (both facing the room we have now entered) are noticeable.
The god is accompanied by a form representing the psrtsoni% d sense
of sight, with an eye as his symbol; the goddess by the pisrsoni% sd
sense of hearing, with an ear above his head, Thoth writes down
the resolutions and thoughts of the god, while Sefekh, the goddess
of history, causes the fame of the great deeds of the past to ring in
the ears of posterity. The dedieatory inscription states that this
door was overlaid with silver-gilt (electrum), and Ghampollion
found that the very low relief wee formerly covered with a cloth
coated with stucco, and was then probably gilded. No traees of the
gilding is new to he found. qt-tttM. The tside-rooms adjoining this W.
