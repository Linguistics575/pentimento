side. The excursion, which has no great interest except for the fine
view of the Nile valley, takes 11/232111'5. Other eonvents of a similar
kind (see, 6.9., p. 51) can be reached more easily, The convent,
also named Ihtr Sittch Maryam el-'Adlirah or convent of Lady Mary
the Virgin, consists of a group of miserable huts, occupied not only
by the monks but by laymen with their wives and children, and
looks like a fortified village. Most of the monks employ themselves
in making shoes. The underground ehapel in which service is held
is uninteresting. The institution is very old, .and curious tales are
told of it by Makrizi, Kezwini, Suyuti, and other Arabic writers,

''This convent', says Makrizi,'is ancient, overlooks the Nile, and is
reached by a staircase hewn in the hill; it lies opposite Samlut'. Then,
following eLShaboehti he narrates how it is visited by pilgrims from all
quarters and lies on t e'hill of the caverns'.'At one point of the hill',
he continues,'is a. narrow fissure, and on the saint", day of the convent
all the buktr-btrOt in the neighbourhood come flying to this fhstmre,
floeking together in a huge crowd and making a tremendous din. One
after the other in constant succession thrusts its head into the cleft, am }
utters a scream, until one cornea whose head sticks fast and connot be
withdrawn, The victim then beats! its wings against the rocks until it
dies, after which all the other birds depart and leave the rock in solitude
and silence.'This', adds the writer,'is now a thing of the ptrst'. Similar
legends are found in antiquity. The Pharaohs, on ascending the throne,
let birds loose to bear the tidings to the four quarters of the globe. Hero-
dotus and Elia!) tell of feathered ambassadors f/tttet) in this way from
Egypt, and to this category apparently belongs t e myth of the birds of
Memnou, which on certain days visited the grave of the Son of the Dawn,
who fell before Troy, cleansed it with their beaks and besprinkled it with
water by dipping their feathers in the stream. hough this legend may
have originated in Asia, it was afterwards, like Memnon himself (p. 154),
transplanted to the Nile.'

The Wadi et-Q'Ã©r (E. bank) leads from the Grebe ] et-ptr to the S.E.
About 1V2 H. to the S. of its mouth u the village of?'slmeh eg-Tahanah
('Tehneh of the mill'). Before reaching it we pass the ancient Hitdn el-
'aggs, or'walls of the old woman', probably erected as a barrier to the
degert-hurrieaneg. At Tehneh, which is about 3/411. from the Nile, are two
groups of tombs, that to the N. belonging to the latest period at which rock-
tombs were constructed on the Nile, while that to the 8, belongs to the
early epoch of the ancient kingdom. The necropolis to which these tombs
belonged is supposed to be that of the town of Akoris, mentioned by Pto-
lemy alone and belonging to the meme of Cynepolis. Mounds mark the
site of the ancient town, Beyond rise the rocks, containing tombs of the
time of the Ptolemies and several short Greek inscriptions. One aepul-
chral chapel, containing some singular representations of a late date, is
interesting. The colours on the ceiling have faded, but the paintings on
the walls are still dietinguishable. In front, on the left wail, stands the
decanted, in Roman costume; opposite, 0n the right wall, he appears again,
oeering a "criftee, as a sign that though in the Roman service or at least
of Roman tastes he yet reveres the gods of his ancestors. The represem
tatiom of these deities occur on all four walls of the chamber and are
Bo numeroua that they must include the local divinities, not only of Akoria,
but also of all the other places in the name, of which the deceased, whose
name is not deeipheratsle-, may have been nomarch. The only inscriptions
extant are on the inner aide of the door. Higher up on the mek-wall, are
.twp horses in the Roman style, held by men. Between the two were other
sculptures, the subjects of which are no longer recognisable. The flrat,
