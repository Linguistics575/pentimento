square pillars are used in place of the more usual columns. These
simple artistic forms themselves suggest an early origin for the
editiee, and the inscriptions record that it was built by Amenhotep II.

found. On several of the pillars, whose unedorned capitals are
striking, the king appears before Ammon,, It is not easy to deter-
mine the purpose of this building. It cannot have been a palace.
Perhaps it contained stables for the sacred animals of the different
deities, or was the depository for the gaeritieial gifts presented within
the first pylon. Perhaps Ammon'e guard of honour, which is fre-
quently mentioned and Which had to watch over the temyle, wee
quartered here; or it may have been used by the priests on duty for
the day as a temporary resort. Various reasons prevent us from
regarding it as the actual abode either of the kings or of the atten-
dants on the gods. -.t.t. To the S. of Pylon X1 is the base of a Statue
of King Horus, the lower part of which dates from Amenhotep III.

Beyond the pylon, which we skirt rather than pass through, is
the Avenue of Sphinxes, bounding the proaystsiona1 route that led to
the 8. buildings. To the E. of the avenue two Chambers, painted
in bright colours, were excavated by Mariette. They belong to a.
temple of Osiris-Ptah, who is here represented as worshipped by
Taharka and by Amontanut, apparently a contemporary king (the
Urdemani of Assyrian inscriptions)

The avenue leads to the temple of Math (see below), while it "
connected by a branch with the ephinx-avenue leading from the
temple of Khunsu to Luxor (comp. p 116). In a straight direction
the flrst-mentiomsd avenue is terminated by 9. Gate (PI, r), built try
the Ptolemiee, in the N. side of e gi'rdlis-ws11 enclosing a 1tortgtreqyhtm
shaped lake, In front of this lake stood the Temple of Hath (Pl. I),
built by Armsnhotep III., and now so completely ruined that it is
diffieuit to determine its original arrangement, To the right and
left of the gate of Ptolemy Philadelphue (which bears a beautiful
hymn to the goddess Math), and both without and within the girdle-
wall, were numerous lion-headed Figures of Sckhet, many of which
have already found their way to European museums (e.g. at Turin),
A second gate bears the cartouches of Seti II. and fikt-mskht, In a
small Apartment on the E. side of the temple is a record of a resto-
ration of the temple by Mentuemhat, priest of Ammon, in the time
of Taherka. To the W. of the horgty-shots lake are the remains of a
smell Temple (Pl. U), built try Ramses III., who here recorded his
victory over the land of Tahi and the animals and other rich booty
which he thereby obtained.
