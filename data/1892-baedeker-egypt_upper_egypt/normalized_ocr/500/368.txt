is in these words:'the very remote and very sacred, who rises in
Bigeh (Senem)'..

On the front of this little temple, to the left, is a Demotic Inscription
in red letters, In which Aurelius Antoninua Pins and Lucius Verna are
mentioned with their titles derived from eon uered provinces. The

Inscriptions; to the left CW.) by Tiberius, to the right (K) by
Autokretor Kisres (perhaps Augustus or even Tiberius again). The
