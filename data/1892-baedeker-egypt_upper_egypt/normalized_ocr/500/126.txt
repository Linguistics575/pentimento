Both the'Three Weeks' and the'Four Weeke" Tourist Steamers stop
at Denderah in ascending the river, the ftrst halting 3 hrs., the second a

ing the rlver.

For a visit to the temple the steamboats and dhahabiyeha moor at the
bank opposite geneh. The distance to the temple (about 2 MO is easily
accomplished in'le hr. by the well-equipped donkeys standing in readiness,
Those who wish to make a prolonged stay may procure the necessary
conveniences for a night in the temple from the keeper'Ali Ejendi, who
lives in Keneh. The Arabs, however, are afraid of the "afrtt' or ghosts
The visitor should not fail to he provided with candles or (better still) a
magnesium lamp for exploring the crypts and other parts of the temple.

We follow the bank of the Nile towards the N., through palm-
trees, and then proceed to the W. through well-tilled fields, pass-
ing (right) a farm-ene1ast1re guarded by yelping dogs; or we may
ride at once towards the W. in the direction of the Gate of Augustus
(p. 88) and proceed thence to the N., passing a. door with 11niilled
eartoaehets, to the N, entrance, where the cards of admission (see
Introd., p. xiv) are shown. The wall enclosing the temple is formed
of Nile bricks, and there is another entrance on the W. side. The
total enclosure is 317 yds. long and 306 yds wide, and besides the
large temple of Hathor contains a small sanctuary dedicated to Isis
and a eo-called'birth-house' (see below). The N. door, which is in
a straight line with the temple, is only 15Â° to the E, of N.; but in
the temple-inscriptions it is always Spoken of as the E, entrance,
while the long sides of the temple are called the N. and 8. sides.
In the following description we follow the true geographical past-
tion. The N. gate was built under the Emp. Domitian, who is here
named Germanicus. On the side next the temple appears the name
of Nerve Trajanue, also with the epithets of Germanieus and
Dacieus.

From the N. gate a modern brick passage leads to the temple.
To the left of this passage lies a building deep-sunken in the de-
brie and wanting its front. Round it ran a colonnade, the capitals
of which, with the dwarf-like figure of the god Besa, project frinn
the sand. The remains include a. rather large vestibule (33 ft. by
