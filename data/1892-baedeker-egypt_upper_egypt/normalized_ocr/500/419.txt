Two main routes lead to the oasis of Siwah. One, beginning at Alex-
andria, leads to the w. along the Mediterranean coast via the *Atabet
e-/joirlutr (Katabathmus Parvus) to Medjed near Barman (the ancient Pa.-
rietbnium), in 80-90 hrAs, travel spread over 10-11 days, and there turning
to the S. reaches Siwah in ,5 days or B2 hrs. more. This was Alexander)
the Greet's route, and was also taken by Browne (see tstrove) In 1792. Or
the traveller may follow the Mediterranean coast for 4 days more to the
'Atabet et-Kel/tr (Katabathmus Major) near Bir 9% ng and there turnin F,
reach Siweh in 5 days or fri hm more. This was Minuteli's route in 820.
The secomi main route, starting from Terdneh or from Cairo leads vik
the Natron Convents to Siwah, in about 13 days (Homemann 1,798), while
the Mst route takes 15-20 days. One route is usually taken for the
journey out, the other for the return. Pr. Cailliaud reached Siwah in 1819
from the Fayiim in 16 days, vial Raydn, el-PereU, and el-Karah, but the
hostile natives permitted him to pay but one visit to the monuments. In
the following year (1820) Mohammad'Ali despateheil a military force with
artillery, which reduced the hitherto independent Siwah under the autho-
rity of the Pasha of Egypt. Droeetti and Ricci aceom enied this expedition,
Gerhard Rohit' has twice visited the oasis; in 183 on his journey from
Tripoli to Alexandria; and in Feb, 1874 in the course of an expedition
undertaken along with Jordan, Zittel, and Ateheruon, at the expense of Ir
ma" n Pasha. This expedition Martin from Atv3iti.t proceeded via Fardfrah
and Dikhel, then struck W. to 2704, where they turned to the N., reach-
ing Siwah in "days. The return was made vit 1i'arirfrah, Dt1rhel, and
ebdrluirgeh to the Nile. Unfortunately this costly expedition had not se-
cured the services of an E'gyptologist, and even their photographer Ro,
meté was left behind at Dtkhet, so that it has contributed little or nothin
to our knowledge of the inscriptions at Mwah. We have on the other han
very full information coneemin the temples at ei-Khéirgeh from Cailtiaud,
Rabi. Hay, and H. Brugsch (i87 i, to which also the photo raphs taken by
M. Remelé at Dtrkhel and Khargeh have largely added. he inhabitants
of the oasis of Btwah speak a peculiar dialect, of which Minutoli has
communicated 400 words. Herodotus (H, 42) mentions that the Ammo-
nites are colonists from Egypt and Ethiopia and speak a dialect midway
between the languages of these lands. They understand a little Arabic,
but their own speech is a dialect of Tamasirht, a Berber tongue, under »
stood in the Atlas and elsewhere in N. Africa,,

The deity worshipped in the temple of the oasis was a ramhrheaded
and ramihorned Amman, such as appears On some Thehan monuments
(cg. the N, wall of Medinet Hahn), and also on ceine of the Ptolemies.
He was sup osed to have been identified with Horwshaf, who was wor-

discovered the correct reading, Khmensu, and recognized in it Aheneg (Heme
eieoporis Magma), the capital of the 20th nome of Upper Egypt. As practi-
cally nothing is known of the Egyptian inscriptions in the oasis of Am-
