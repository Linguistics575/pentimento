192 Route 18. THEBES. Wart Bank:

Mounting to the left of the tomb of Rekhmari we reach (to the
left of No. 48) a lately discovered tomb, rather diffleu1t of access.
This trouble of the ascent, however, is repaid by the beauty and
freehneee of the paintings, It belonged to Sen-nefer (good brother),
superintendent of the southern city, overseer of the grannies of
Ammon, and superior of the flocks of Ammon, under Amenhotep II.
Strangely enough the name of Alexander (Arkee antes) is also found
hers. To the right, immediately above the tomb of Rekhmeri, ts
that (now No. M) of Amuzeh, superintendent of the palace under
Tutmes III. and Amenhotep IL This also consists of a large vesti-
bule with niches in the sides, and a. rather long passage out into
the hill,

The reprsurtsntations en the inner wall of the vestibule are worth no-
ticing. On the left are the African tribes bringing in their tribute een-
tSistine of gold, ivory, apes, panther-skins and the like. On the right is
the tribute of the Asiatiee, jars, a carriage, a white and a. brown horse,
and various weapons. In both corners of the vestibule were eteles, of
which only that on the right has been preserved containing a prayer to
Ba in the name of the deceased. On the right-hand side of the long pae-
eage into the hill is a scene illustrating the chase of waterfowl.

To the right close to No. 51 is the tomb of Amen-em-heh (No. 36)
known to Champollion and described by Ebers and Stem. It con-
eiste of two halts one behind the other, of which the length is at
right angles to the passage between them, and of a chamber behind
the second hall.

The historical Inscription on the left inner wall of the ttrgt hall painted
in blue on white etueeo, and discovered by Prof. Ebers, ie of special in-
terest. In it Amen-em-heb describes the part which he took in the (sam-
gaigns of Tutmea 111., and gives' exact information of the length of that

haraeh" a reign, and the accession of his successor Amenhotep II. He

does not forget to record the honours which the favour of his grinee had

heaped upon him.'I was', he begins'his 10rdship's great fl elity, the

pride of the king of Lower Egypt, the half of the heart of the king of Upper

Egypt. 1 followed my lord into the country of the north and of the south

according to his will etc.'Then he recounts how he took part in the victorious
MMM

expeditions to South Palestine IhgClsdl Helseb 333, lle-

tsopotamia (Nabarain), the we11-wood√© Iran westward of Khalyhon (Aleppo),
Karkhemieh, beyond the river of Mesopotamia (the Euphrates), Tyre co,
Ketesh, Niniveh, etc. Everywhere he obtained spoil and was rewarded
with presents of rings and helmets, and decanted with necklaces, the
badges of orders, including the'Ornament of the Lion'. The follow-
ing is an interesting J1i1" Ei,''Another time the lord of both worlds pew"
formed a mighty dee before Ninivdh, when he hunted 120 elephants for
their tasks. I killed the greatest among them, fighting in the eight of His
Majesty, and cut off its trunk', On returning to Egypt Amen-ein-heb re-
mained with King Tutmee 111., who died in the 54th year of his reign on
the last day of the third winter month. We ascended to heaven at the
going down of the Bun, and the servant of, Goil made himself one with
his Maker. When it was morning and the earth became clear and the sun's
face arose and the heavens were made bright, then did the king of Up
and Lower Egypt, Amenhotep IL, ascend his father', threne'. Under t a
Pharaoh else the general enjoyed high honours. His skull is preserved
in the anatomical museum of Leipeie. Hie biography was composed by
another eommander-in-chief, named nah.
