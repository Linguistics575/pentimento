Nehi'. In the recess at the end of the cave Tutmee III. sits between
Home and Sati. Immediately to the left is the second cave (about
10 ft. deep), much less skilfully executed, in which appear ten
persons before Ramses. Among these ale Satan, prince of Kush
(Whose name is found elsewhere in Nubia), and a number of scribes
and oft1eiahs,

The third cave, which lies a little higher up, also shows the
cartouehe of Tutmes III. The recess contains the somewhat roughly
executed f1garas of four seated pereoneges; to the right the king
and Seti, to the left the king and Horns, lord of Miim.--Ths fourth
cave (from the S.) is the most important. It belongs to Amen-
hotep IL, who appears conducted by Horus, lord of Beheni, to a
row of gods including Khnum, Sati, and Anuke, the gods of the
cataracts, and Horus, Hathor, and Hehen .--. To the S. of Kaer
1brim a few steles are found, one showing a Tietorious king in his
war-ehariot.

The mountains presently retire, leaving room for a strip of culti-
Vated land. Numerous Sdfciyehs or water-wheels are seen. To the
left (E) appears the village of Djimeneh, beside a pretty wood.
Farther on, on the same bank, lies Toshkeh (Nubian'Three Moun-
tains'), a. small place among palms, with a somewhat uneivilized
population. At Toshheh ct-Gharb, on the W. bank, 7 M, from the
river, a large force of dewishes was defeated with the loss of their
cannon by the British on Aug. 3rd 1889; several thousand slain
were left on the battle-field, and their weapons and clothing were
sold by the neighbouring natives. cook's tourists may visit the
batthy-msld if they desire it.

The district we next enter upon is very monotonous and almost
uninhabited; and navigation is rendered diff1eu1t by rocks. To the
left lie Gurgundi and three tshtkhs' tombs; then the villages of Debitt
and Fe craig. The river-bed becomes very wide at places. 0n the
right we catch sight of the eolossi that guard the temple of Abu-
Simhel.

Cook's tourist steamers usually reach Atm- Simhel in the evening of
the third day, in time to permit of a visit to the temples before night.
Next morning they proceed to Wadi Halfah 0n the, r'etureoyBg? they
itgain spend the night at Abu- Simbel, starting next morning at 9 or

The two temples of Abu-Simbel ('Father of the Ear of Cern')
lie 9. short distance apart at the foot of a precipitous Jifi close to the
W. bank of the Nile. No other temple in Egypt produces so unex-
peetedly grand an effect as the great rock temple of Ramses IL,
especially by moonlight. By itself it would repay the trouble of
the ascent from Philar, both by the dignity of its sculptures and by
