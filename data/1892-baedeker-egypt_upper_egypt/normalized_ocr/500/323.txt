preferred sandetoae to limestone and even to the harder but more easily
disintegrating granite. For substructures, however, and for walls
surrounded with earth they wisely gave the preference to limestone.
--The hills on the two banks of the river approach so close together
at Grebe ] Silsileh that they have justly been computed to the pillars of a.
gigantic gateway. The legend of the chain that once barred the passage
of the river here is probably pure invention, taking its rise from the
Coptic name of the city of quarries, which in the hieroglyphiea isnamed

Pa (Chennai. The later Egyptians named the town aroh 1soh i.e.'ae-
pes, claustrum, barrier, probably in reference to the gorge of the river.
The Romans, who maintained a garrison here, eonverted the Tel t'el of
the Egyptians into Silsili, which was confounded by the Arabs with
Sitsa'leh, the Arabic for'chain', The people, seeking meanings for every
name and preferring those that come in the guise of a. legend thereupon
invented the story of a chain, that once barred the gorge at Gehel Silaileh.
By and by the very place where this mythical chain had been fastened
came to be pointed out.

The dhahahiyehs generally halt in the very midst of the mon-
uments. We turn first to the N., ascend a wellobeaten track, and
then gradually descend the rocky hill, On the slope beside the river
are some tomb-like Recesses, belonging to ofVialt, of the 18th
Dyn., with the names of Tutmes III. and his sister Hatasu over the
entrance. In one of these, the surface of which is divided into
squares, some of the ilg11re are sketched bat left unfinished,
Farther on is a cave with a painted ceiling. Beside it are in-
scriptions of the time of Ramses 111., bt1ildtyr of Medinet Habu,
who is represented before Ammon, Math, and Khuneu. There is
also a larger memorial tablet of the let year of Sheshenk 1.
(22nd Dyn.) Sheshenk had commanded his architect Horemsat to
quarry stones at Silsileh for the gateway erected by the king on
the S. side of the first court of the temple of Ammon at Kamak.
Immediately to the N, is a Stale bearing various conventional phrases

*B.ock Chapel (Specs), which may he reckoned among the most
important monuments in the Nile valley, on account of its reliefs
and inscriptions. This chapel, hewn in the rock close to the sum-
mit of a hill, dates from the 18th Dyn. In front are five doorways,
separated from each other by pillars at varying distance, and crowned
with the astregal and concave cornice. Numerous gods are named
in it. Sebek, who forms a triad with Ammon-Ra and Muth, takes
the iirgt place; Ptah of Memphis is also mentioned. King Horus is
here spoken of as the beloved of the Anka-t (Onka),'Mietress of
Asia', and this Egyptian-Pheenician goddess is represented with a
head-dress, elsewhere only found on the heads of Asiatic warriors.

The Interior consists of a broad but shallow vaulted chamber, at the
