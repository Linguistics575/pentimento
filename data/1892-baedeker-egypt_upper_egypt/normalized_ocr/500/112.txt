parts, records that'this Memnonium was erected in the temple of
Ahydos to his forefathers and all the cycles of gods of heaven and
earth, by the king, lord of the diadems, who is born again, who
surpasses all in strength and annihilate, the barbarians, the vie,
torious Horus, who appears in new glory, bearing sway over the
barbarians in all countries, the king of Uppertad Lower Egypt,

tstand in adoration. The praying king raises his right hand and holds,
a eenser in his left hand; the boyuprince, standing in front of him,
still hears the lock of youth, hanging over his temples. In his
raised hands he hears written rolls. The adjoining inscription reads:
'Reoitation of songs of praise by Prince Ramses, son and ilrtrtborn of
the king who loves him'. Above the shields is another inscription,
which describes the king's offering as made to Ptah-Sokar-Osiris,

1000 garments, 1000 barrels of wine,1000 holy otterings The
ilgure 1000 here, which occurs in almost all tyat3ritioia1 lists and also
in other formulae, is not, of course, to be taken literally but simply
as equivalent to many. The king, as we see, brings his youthful
son into the hall dedicated to his ancestors, where the earlier rulers
of Egypt, under the symbol of their name, dwell beside the tomb
of Osiris. He teaches the boy to offer rich gifts, such as hereafter
he would wish offered to his own mamas. It is beyond doubt that
Seti was still living when this inscription was set up, and yet
he already adds his own name to those of his predecessors; it
occupies the whole of the lowest row (the third from the top) of the
royal table, being repeated 19 times with prefix and affix. The
living Seti provides for the future Oeirie and for his worship at the
holy grave.'ttmtg-tgat" In the first volume of this Handbook (p. 85) it has
