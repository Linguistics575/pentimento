square, in the decoration of which the central block is treated as if it
were an enormous sarcophagus. In fact the 8artpphagut of the deceased
lies below the centre of this block, and is reached by means of a per-
pendicular shaft, 18 ft. in depth, at the end of a. Corridor to the Fight of
the main passage. By descending the shaft, a room 191/2 ft. deep is reached,
and from the roof of this there is an entrance to the _s) areophagus-ha1l,
Which is exactly beneath the square block above described. The length
of this private tomb without the gide-ehamberg is 862 ft., and its super-
liciel area. 2470 sq. yds. or with the ghaft-ehamberg 2660srq, yds.

To the N, ot this huge tomb are several smaller ones of the
same period, with finely worked antechambers, and false doors, and
carefully executed inscriptions. Some of these, especially those of

the royal ladies and priestesses of Ammon, 8hep-en-dpt and Neit-

akert or Nitocris tC2Ct:1, < Ã© >, contain valuable contri-

butions to the knowledge of the family of Pharaohs which formed
the 26th Dynasty. A queen Nitocris of the 6th Dyn., known as e
pyramid-builder, is said to have been beautiful and light-haired,
With her may have been confounded the princess of the 26th Dyn.
with the same name, who was buried at el-Asasif, and lived shortly
before the famous ceurtezan of Naueratis, named Rhodopis or the
rosy-eheeked, Nitocris the elder and Rhodopis were probably called
by the same name, tle, the fair one, in the mouths of the Egyptians,
and Herodotus hearing that the'Fair one' had lived shortly before
Amasis, confused the two, and reported that the courtezan Rhodopis
was considered the builder of pyramids, See Vol. 1., p. 346.

The Ttsrrtuser/Nmple of Der el-hahri.

This temple derives its name, meaning the North Church or
North Monastery, from an ecclesiastical brick building of the Christ-
ian period, the remains of which are mentioned on p. 227. Der
el-bahri is reached from el-Asasif in 10minutes. Its situation is
remarkably fine, its terraces which we ascend, being framed by a
semicircle of high and rugged rocks, of a light brown and golden
colour. If Thebes had been in Greece, this is where its citizens
would have placed their theatre. The Egyptians whose thoughts
were fuller of death than of life, founded a sanctuary for the
worship of the dead. Apparently an avenue of sphinxes, of which
some traces remain, connected this with the landing-stage, where
boats coming from Karnak on the W. bank were anchored. This
magniiieant work was carried out during the rise of the New Em-
pire, and the numerous processions of pilgrims began in the
16th cent. 8.0. The laying out of the terraces was begun by Tut-
mes L, and completed by his daughter, Queen Hatshepsu, or Ha-,
tatra-Ramaka, familiar to us as the raiser of the great obelisk of
Karnak o, 133). Here too her brothers, Tntmes II. and 111.,
although their names are mentioned, fall into the background
when compared with their energetic and ambitious sieter. After-
