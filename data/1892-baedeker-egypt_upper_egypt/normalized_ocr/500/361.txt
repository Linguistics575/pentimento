Half of the figures have been deliberately defaced.

The Amen! of the Pylom, commanding an excellent view of the whole
island and its surrounding, is made from the peristyle court entered by
the central ortal. Within this portal, to the right, is the following Itv.

of the'East Tower begins in the Small chamber (Pi, e), in the 8.131. corner
of the perietyle court. It ascends gradually, round a square newel. Sev-
eral unadorned chambers, probably used for the storing of astronomical
instruments and for the use of astrologers, are to he found within the
tower. They are feehlyr lighted by window-openings, decreasing in size
towards the outside wall. mmtmgMN The West Tower can only be reached from
the E. tower. The Crosses on the stones of the roof formerly held braces
of wood or iron.

Two Obetisks and two Lions, all of granite, formerly stood be-
fore the entrance. The foot of the W. obelisk is all that remains of
the former; the latter lie much damaged on the ground. Numerous
Greek Inscriptions have been carved here by pilgrims .--Adjoining
the S.E. side of the pylon is the beautiful Gateway (Pl. G) of Ptou
lemy IL Philadelphus, who appears on its E, side. On its W.
wall, to the right and left, is the emperor Tiberius, above, Phila-
delphus.

d. The Inner Peristyle (Pl. I), bounded on the S. try Pylon IL,
is bounded on the N. by another Pylon (Pl. K) These, however,
are by no means parallel to each other, while the aiifieaiy to the
E. and W. of the peristyle are so entirely difhsrtsnt, that it is at
once apparent that the court was not constructed according to any
preconceived plan. The requirements of the moment and the amdl-
able space were taken into account, not any artistic considers: -
tions. Nevertheless this court, entirely tsmslostsi1 by buildings of
the most varied forms, must be described as unusually tsfNetivs
On the E, and W. are two oblong'silifieeis, each with columns on
the side next the court. That to the W. (left) is a distinct temple,
forming a. kind of peripteros; that to the E. was used. by the
priests, iThits court, which is mostly uneven, contains one spot ex-
cellently adapted for the pitching of a tent. Cook's parties usually
lunch here; if there are more than one party at the same time, the
second lunches in the kiosque (Pl. R).

e. The Temple to the W. of the Peristyla (Pl. L) stands im-
mediately behind the left (WI) wing of the first pylon, and a door-
way in the latter (p. 287) lies exactly apposite the S. Entrance
Door (Pl, d) of the temple, from which it is separated only by a
narrow open passage. At the N. end of the colonnede on the side
of the temple next the court is e tside-tmt-ty, The 8. door trd-
mits to a Promos with d columns, of which two are engaged in
the portal. Beyond lies a Celia with three chambers, surrounded
on three sideshy a eolonnede. This temple was foe Pto-
