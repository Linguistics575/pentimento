w-lotta Day. Arrival at the ruins of the old temple of Berenike.

The town of Berenike (Berentca), situated in the same latitude es
Asusu'iin, was founded in 3.0. 275 by Ptolemy Philadelphue, who revived
the commerce of the Red Sea by the establishment of several new ports.
The towa, which was named by Ptolemy after his mother, survived for
400 or 500 years. The ruins, still extant, surround the Temple which
faces the E.N.E. In front is a. fore-court 281/2 ft. in width and l2 ft,, in
depth, which was adjoihed by the temple proper (inner length 31 no,
comprising two rows of apartments. The central apartment, with some
what sloping sides, seems to have been the main one, as its ri ht and
left walls and also the outside of the entrance-well (to the le t) bear
traces of paintings, re resenting a king sseriMing to various deities. The
name of the Emp. Ti erius, trsusrifieing to the god Khem, appears here.
The representation on the left outside-wall shows an emperor (probably
Hadrian) appearing before a goddess, who seems to be, from the legend,

the tutelary deity of the green uez emerald mine. To the left

of this main apartment is a covered corridor, with a window, and ad-
jacent is a staircase leading to the root, The temple wee cleared from
rubbish in 1873 by Purdy Pasha, an American in the Egyptian service.

The Emerald linen, which were visited last century by Bruce (1163
~73) and in this century by Cailliaud (1815-18), Belzoni, and Beeehey,
were worked by the Arabs, according to Mekrizi, down to the year 760 of
the Hegire (1370 Amo, after which they were abandoned. Mohemmed
rAli made an unavailing attempt to reopen them. They lie gertly in the
dei Saki: and partly on the Gabe! Zabdrah, "M. to the N." They are
best visited from Contra Apo11inopolis, but may, like Berenike be ap-
proached by following the count of the Arabian Gulf from 1509 r. The
flrgt route diverges from the road to Berenike at Phalacro. Between
Contra-Edfu and the mines are three old stations. At the first of these
is the name of a eun-worehipping king of the 18th Dynasty. Close to the
second, 13 hrs. from the Nile, is a temple hewn in the rock, the Tom to
of Rtdelutgeh (so called after the place of that name on the Nile; see p. 2%),
which Seti l, dedicated to Ammon. No recioue stones are now found
in the emerald mines. To the S. of the abet Zaharah lies the village of
Bakét, with the huts of miners and a rock-hewn temple, with a few Greek
inscriptions. Among these is a reference to Serapie end the Isis of Senekie.
