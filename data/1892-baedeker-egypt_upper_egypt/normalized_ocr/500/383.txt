who were, about 540 A.D., defeated by Silko, the Christian king of
the Nohedee (p. 302) who celebrated his victory in an inscription
on one of the pillars of the temple at Kalebeheh (see below).

The extent Large Temple was built under the Roman emperor
Augustus and his successors. The numerous inscriptions (in Greek,
with the exception of (me in Latin hexemeters) date from the reigns
of Domitian, Trajan, Hadrian, and Anteninue Pius, and of the later
emperors Alexander Severus and Phuippwr; they express the rtb3N5-
rence of the soldiers of the Spanish, Iturean, end Theben cohorts
for the great god Mandulis.

Including the inner girdle-wall the temple is 235 ft, long and
117% ft, broad. There is also an outer giriuo-wa1l, with small
temples at the NE. and S.W. angles, Before the last stand the
columns one behind the other. The inner girdle-wall joins the
massive pylon, forming a continuous building with it. In front of
the pylon is a. narrow platform, reached by 9. flight of steps begin-
ning at the Nile, then by a paved passage about 100 ft, long and
26 ft. broad, leading to a second flight of 20 steps. The entrance to
the temple is blocked by fallen stones and the dwellings of natives,
who have settled all about the entire temple. In the interior of the
pylon are stairs and chambers, as at Edfu (p. 244). On peesing
through the door of the pylon, which is not in a straight line with
the rest of the building but at a. slight angle with the axis of the
temple, we f1nil ourselves in e fore-court, 65 ft. long, the tioor of
which is quite covered with fallen blocks of masonry. Of the double
row of columns which once stood here, probably in 4 couples on each
side, only a single column, on the left side, is now erect. On each
side of this court four narrow chambers have been constructed in
the well; and a. door on the right eemmunicetes with the exterior
passage round the temple. The wells of the entrance to the next
room retire towards the top in the manner of a pylon. Here on the
right the tatymytqmmt'itymyd decree of fiyilko is inscribed in bad Greek.
On the nearest column is a long inscription in the Ethiopian demo-
tie character, hitherto uniltstu'phtsred, which may perhaps be a replica

or repetition of the decree. [

The En lish translation of Silko'e tm ertant Greek inscription is as
follows'I, ilko, euh-king (fluctuated of he Nobadee end all Ethiopians,
came twice to Telmis (Kalebsheh) end Taphie (Tefeh). I fought against
the Blemmyee end God'geve me the victory over them, three to one.
Again I conquered and took possession of their cities, I fortified myself
there the first time with my troops. I overcame them and they sued to
me. I made peace with them and they swore to me by the images of
their gods, and I trusted their oath, for they were brave men. I meended
once more into the upper districts. Since I became eub-king, I go no
longer after the other kings but before them. And those who seek to
etrive with me, t do not allow to remain in their land unless the beg for
pardon from me. For in the lower districts I am a lion, and in It upper

Telmie. And I laid waste the other districts, the up "Nohed region,
when they sought to strive with me. The rulers, the other peoples,
who eeek to strive with me, I do not allow to sea in the
