The next room, almost square, is entirely hewn out of the rock,
six square pillars being left in two rows in the centre. The arehi-
treve above the pillars contains the customary dedieuion-inserip-
tion, On the right we read:'The living Hor-Ra, the strong lord of
both lands beloved by Ma, who rules Egypt and has conquered the
nations, the gold-hawk, rich in years, great in victories, the king
of Upper and Lower Egypt, Ramses IL, has reared in memory of
his father Harmeehis the Hat Ramessu meramon in Pa Ra.'Pa
IIa' is thus the holy name of the spot and'temple of Ramses Meme
mon' the name of the sanctuary. On the left architreve Ammon-Ra
is mentioned instead of Harmachis, as lord of the throne of both
lands, so that the temple must be regarded as dedicated to both
deities. 0n the six pillars are ilgurtss of the king before Tum, Pteh,
Khnum, and other gods. On the right side-wall is the boat of Har-
machis borne by 12 priests and conducted by the king; on the left
gid-al1 the king, in a boat, offering incense. From this chamber
a large door, surmounted by the winged sun-disc, leads into the
sanctuary, and doors to the right and left admit to smaller apart-
ments. Four seated ilgurtss occupy the rear-wall of the sanctuary,

viz, (beginning to the left) Ptah, Ammon-Ra, the king, and Har-

maehis with the hawk's head. They are all represented full face,
and would be i1iftiealt to identify were it not for the inscriptions
adjoining .--Not far from the temple is a small roek-stge, dedi-
cated to the king's son Amenemheb, with the figure of a temple.

Beyond Derr the Nile valley again turns to the S.W. To the
right is the island of Tomas. Crocodiles now become more numer-
ous, looking from a distance like trte-trunks or like huge frogs. A
nearer view is only to be obtained by rowing on ahead of the dhahe-
biyeh in the felukeh or small boat. At Ellestyeh (E. bank), also
called cd-Duknesrah, is a roek-tomb of the 18th Dynasty. On a stele
here, dating from the 43rd year of Tutmes 111., the king presents

o o "a o Â©
offerings to Horus, lord of Mam l "iii", and to Sam, mistress of

Abu, The walI-paintings represent the king seated between Math
and Uaz; then offering to Horus, lord of the land of Khent, to Horus
of Mam, and to Thoth and Ilathor.

On the W. bank, opposite Kctteh, we next see an ancient ruined
fort. Then to the right is the verdant island of Abu Rds, and to
the left the village of mt-tiw-

13 M. Ibrim. To the E. rises a considerable chain of hills, and to
the W. (left) is a narrow strip of palms and eastor-on plants, beyond
which is the desert. On the W, bank, a little inland from the village
of Anibch, and hidden behind a palm-grove, lies an interesting

rock-tomh of the reign of Ramses YE (g Om p P _" ] T i) Amen
