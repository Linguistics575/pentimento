different chapels are still easily distinguishable, partly from the
plan of the building, partly by the representations and inscriptions;
for from each of the seven doors a processional approach led through
the two hypeetyle halls straight to tho entrance of the correspond-
ing chapel; while the representations on the columns flanking each
approach refer only to the deity to whom the chapel at the end ofit
was dedicated. In the vaulted chapels, amid the fumes of in-
cense and the murmuring of muffled singing, waited the minis-
tering priests of the sanctuary, pouring out libations and uttering
benedictions as the processions wound along the aisles, either
bearing a. mummy to be ganetiiiiyd or consisting of a group of privi-
leged laymen bringing offerings to the Osiris gods for the soul's
welfare of the daseageda---The dedications are inscribed on the
door-posts in the traditional forms and with little variation. Similar
vaults occur at Berfilyusan and DÃ©r el-Bahri, and also in the lids of
the sarcoPhagi in the museum at Gizeh. In each case the menu-
ments to which they belong serve funerary purposes; the shape ot
the vault is, however, intended to represent the vault of heaven,
which the 0siritr-sou1 has to traverse, and they are usually decorated
with stars. An inscription preserved on one of the vaults of the
sanctuary informs us that the Pharaoh erected this structure for his
father Osiris in the interior of the temple of Ra-ma-men and fitted
up the chapel to resemble the heaven of the ninefold deities, imt-

tating its constellations, etc.

The internal fitting up and appearance of the chapels very little, As the
middle place had to be assigned to Ammon, the chief of the gods, it was
neeesaary to mark the special dignity of Osiris, to whom indeed the tem le
was consecrated, by making his chapel (Pl. d) wider than the others. he
rear-walls of the latter are, In each case, occupied by two niches with a
lotus-flower between them, from which rises the slender form'il Osiris,
symbolisiug the blossoming of the soul in a.'ha. pier sphere'. In the back-
wall of the sanctuary of Osiris, however, is a cor, leading to estructure
(PI, E) which, including the adjoining smaller columned chambers, is as wide
as the whole sanctuary. This was the scene of the mysterious rites cele-
brated in honour of the Di'vinty-Dtyeetrsed (Osiris, whose name even the Greek
Herodotus shrank from breathing) by the esoteric priests of the highest class
(see Baedeter's Lower Egypt, p. 124). The inscriptions in the chapels inform
us that the priestly proetussions f, which came from all parts of the kingdom,
made a complete circuit of the chapel, keeping to the right wall on entering
and returning to the door along the left wall. Thirty-six rites or ceremonies
had to he performed during this circuit. First came a recitation to prove the
worthiness of the worshipper to approach the holy place and the image of
the god. Then the veil was lifted. The worshipper was next allowed to
witness the investiture of the god by the priests with his fil1ata, garments,
ornaments, and the attributes of his divine ower. Not before this was
accomplished did the pilgrim prostrate himseltpin adoration, hriuging drink-
offerings, lihatiens, and hurnt-ofreringr The hymns to be sung at these
ceremonies are all prescribed, and the pictorial representations show how
the gods were to be clothed and in what attitudes they were to be wor-
shipped. Possibly all these rites were performed only by the priests of

+ In the inscriptions the expression invariably used for the proceesions
is the King, who is regarded as the embodiment and representative of all
his subjects.
