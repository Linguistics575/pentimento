times, for the feasts of the seasons" and the feasts of the year, the feasts
for each day for himself. He filled the temple with all things, a. super-
ahundance of gifts of nourishment, bulls, calves, oxen, geese, incense,
wine, and fruit, fl11ing it with Iatrourers, enriching it with flttldi, pre-
senting cattle, fnling the storehouse with superahundance, the arns
reaching to heaven, the servants of the domains of the offering being the
captives of his brave sword. His tretusurtrhoust, fined with all game,
with ailver and gold in bars, the storehouse full of all things sent as
tribute from all countries. He has constructed numerous canals, and has
planted timber of all sorts, fragrant plants from the land of Punt; he
has done all this, the son of Ra, the lord of the diademe, the beloved
of Osiris and of the gods the lords of Abydoa'.

Like the temple of Seti, that of his eon Ramses was also a
sanctuary dedicated to Osiris, though in each case the predominant
feature is the giorifieation of the monarch in his apotheosia as
Osiris. Mariette was therefore on a wrong tack when he saw a
special temple of Osiris in the enclosure (P1. 111; p. 52) to the N.,
near the village of El-eh/eh, and spent much time and money in
an attempt to find the actual grave of Osiris, Obviously this was
merely an older sanctuary, erected by the kings of the 12th and
13th Dynasties on the site of a still more ancient temple. [ Two
steles in the Louvre, numbered 0 il and C 12, and the great Mele
of Mentuhotep, now in the museum of Gizeh, give us information
concerning these buildings. ] Nowadays this temple is a mere heap
of rubbish, and the few interesting'finds' made here, such as the
statues of Usertesen l, and Usertesen 111., and some inscriptions of
the time of Tutmes 111., have been sent to the museum of Gizeh.
The same institution received the many hundred steles found partly
on the site of this temple and partly in the Necropolis of Abydos.
Three such cemeteries are distinguished. The first, containing
tombs of the New Empire, from the 19th Dynasty downwards,
lies to the S. of the temples of Seti I. and Ramses II. Another
(NÃ©cropole du Centre) lies to the W. of the path leading from the
temple of Ramses II. to the semealled temple of Osiris, and contains
graves mainly of the 6th and 11th Dynasties. Here was found the
historically valuable tablet of Una [ see Baedeker's Lower Egypt,
p. 307), who accompanied three successive rulers of the 6th Dynasty
in their campaigns. The third or N. neieropolis, to the W. of the
so-eil temple of Osiris, contains numerous graves of the 12th
and 13th Dynasties, but also many of the new empire. Among the
interesting stelee found here were those of a Neterhotep of the
13th Dynasty and of Sheshonk, the latter erroneously pronounced
by H, Brugseh to have been a Persian satrap. The pyramidal strue-
tures found in the N, and central cemeteries are also interesting.
Still farther to the W. lies a quadrangular enclosure surrounded by
a lofty wall and named Shunet ez-Zeb2b (PI. IV; p. 52; magazine of
the Zihehes), which probably served as a place of defence against
the incursions of the Beduins of the Great Oases. A Coptic Convent
(Ph Ar; p. 52) to the N.E. of this point, dating from the year 1306
of the 1hrptie era, scarrely repays a visit. "u)'r: ri, N rrrv rvr
