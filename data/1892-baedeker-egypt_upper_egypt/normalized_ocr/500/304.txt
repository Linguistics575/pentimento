The SMALL TEMPLE below, farther to the S.W. in the valley, is
in good preservation, but it is only 16 ft, high and 27 ft. deep. The
Arabs cell it el-yammdm, Le. the Bath.

As the walls are about 3 ft. thick the Interior is very small. On the
left and back walls is a small window, at some height from the ground.
Thoth, Hebent, and Horus, the gods here worshipped, are represented as
forming a. tried. In the doorway is the Pharaoh offering gaerifiee below;
and a tsynotsepha1ms with the moen-eiokle and disc on his head, above.
It was to be expected that the sacred animals that eymbolize the qualities
of Thoth should be found represented here along with the moon-goddeae
Hebent.

They are reached in about 1/411r. from the usual 1andi'ng-phree of
the Nile boats; and the last few minutes' climb up the hill-slope
on which the tombs lie, must be accomplished on foot. The

Shafts, found both outside and inside the tombs, require caution.

These Tombs, hewn side by side in the rock, are, like all the monu-
ments at el-Wh, of small dimensions, but their distinct pictures of Mtusg
cient Egyptian domestic life will interest even those travellers who have
already seen the tombs of Benihasan and'Abd el-Eurnah. One of the
Inscription: (in the tomb of the ahip-eaptain Aehmea, see p. 241) ie of the
greatest treientifie importance, partly on account of the contemporary
narrative of the expulsion of the Hykeoe which it contains, partly on
account of the simple and intelligible style in which it is expressed. It
has been critically translated and analysed (by E. de Rouge) as the J1rst
of all the larger inscriptions. - Most of the tombs were constructed be-
fore, during, or shortly after the rule of the Hykeoe, for male and female
members of noble families, who discharged the peaceful duties of chief
priests of Hebent or of tutors and nurses to the royal princes. There
are 31 tombs in all, bat only 13 have inscriptions and only fl repay a. visit.

We first enter the third inscribed tomb, counting from the E.,
which is consiieuous by its wide Opening. This belonged to the

overseer (, of tsl-Etta, the scribe (Le. savant) Pihari

Q "Ã© grandson (daughter's son) of the ship-master

Aahmee, son of Alma, whose tomb lies farther to the left (WO, It is
distinguished by a series of representations from the life and burial

of the deceased, on both sides of the tomb.

To the left (W.) of the entrance appears the deceased with his gtait'
of otfiee in his right hand and a. long stick in his left; behind him stand
three servants. The accompanying inscription is:'The inspection of the
labours of all seasons of the year, which take place in the fields, by the
overseer of Hebent (tsl-Kitts) by the manager of Anit (EsnehT. - The, La-
bour's of the Field are next represented in three registers, beginning from
beneath. In the lowest row: a cart drawn by two horses, showing that
horses were used by the Egyptians as early as the beginning of the 18th
Dym; titling the ground with hoe and plough, ploughing and sowing. .-.W.
Middle row: Reaping, the grain being out not close to the ground but
one-third 0r one-half way up the stalk; veeaels with refreshments for

corn carried away in baskets-, threshing by means of oxen; piling up the
fruits of the earth; packing them in seeks or storing them an graneynes.
