II. The Northern Buildings.

A visit to the mine to the N. of the temple of Ammon need not
detain the traveller for any long time, unless his object he to decipher the
inscriptions and to gather from them philologicel or historical information,
They are in bad preservation; and the ICE, group, the temple of the war-
god Mentu, is in especial so completely ruined that it is diftieait to recon-
street its broundo1tsn, although in size it was originally as large as the
temple of Khuneu (p. Ito, The traveller who has little time at his
disposal, or who must proceed with the steamer, may content himself
with a glance at the great N. girdle-wall of Nile-brieks, and at the gate
of the Ptoiemieg,

Beginning at the E. Pylon of Nectanebue (p. Idi), we skirt the
girdhs-wal1 of the great temple of Ammon, first to the N, and then
to the W. (left), until we see upon the right or N, side of our path
another girdle-wall of Nile-brieks. Within this lies a ruined Temple
(P1. N), the axis of which lies S.W. and N .15 }." Like the N. pylon (see
below) it was dedicated to Manta, the god of war, and is frequently
mentioned on demotie tiles (ostraca). Stretching N.E. from this
building is an avenue of sphinxes, which we reach on passing
through the door of a well-preserved pylon. Little now remaihs of
the temple, which dates from the time of Amenhotep lil, of the
18th Dyn. (who also erected two obelisks, as appears from a frag-
mentary inscription found here), though it was subsequently several
times enlarged between the reign of Ramses IV, and the epoch of
the Ptolemies, especially by Ptolemy IV. Philopetor. Ptolemy II.
Philadelphus and Ptolemy III. Euergetes have recorded their names
here, and there is also a stone hearing the name of'Ramses', The
earlier sculptures and architectural fragments are of great beauty;
and columns with Hather capitals were also employed. The above-
mentioned Pylon (P1. VII), the most N. part of the edifice now
remaining, was founded by Ptolemy II. At its foot is a list of
names, and higher up are numerous other inscriptions. The fell√©hin
boys are shy of accompanying travellers to this spot towards evening,
as it is said to be haunted by an'Afrit or devil, It is called. by the
natives Bab el-'Ahtd, or gate of the negro-slaves, probably on account
of some of the representations on its walls.

From the pylon we proceed to the S.W., passing the remains of
a Ptolemaic tomple,1.1Pi. 0), of which the staircase is still to be
seen, to another Temple, consisting of six small chambers (Pl. k
to p). The second from the W, (Pl. 1) contains the name of Ama-
niritis, with that of her brother Sabako. The fine alabaster statue
of the queen, now in the museum at Gizeh, was found here. The
temple "shows the rare name of Nepherites (29th Dyn.); o dates
from the 22nd Dynasty. The names of Taharka, Osot, 01; 11:'nd
