leviahness, the stems of which, of considerable thickness, surround the
top of the shaft. The leaves lying against the upper part of the calyx are
of an exaggerated coarseness.

In connection with the whole of which they form a part, these
capitals produce an impression of great richness; while regarded
separately they may be taken as specimens of the rococo period in
Egyptian art, lf the phrase may be permitted. -TrErm The Ornament on
the front and back walls is sank into the wall ('relief en ereux');

astronomical representations.

The small Coptic Church in the town contains little of interest.

As in most Jacobite churches, the Nave is divided into two parts by
three arches. Behind the wooden screens, which are tastefully inlaid with
ivory and mother-of-pearl, lies the sanctuary, in four parts, The fhruras
of the saints are poor and comparatively modern. They represent St. George
and the dragon, St. Michael, the Madonna and Child, and an Ascension.

The Palace of the thdive (Kay- Efmdinah), built by Mohammad
'Ali, lies near the Nile, to the N. of the town, The buildings, in-
cluding a handsome rotunda, are much neglected, but the gardens,
with their profusion of roses, lemon-trees, and orange-tree, are
very attractive. The gardener, who usually presents the visitor with
a. nosegay, expects a. small gratuity (about 4 piastres).

The Quay on the right bank of the Nile, near the Mudiriyeh,
also contains some fragmentary inscriptions of the Roman irnptr-
rial epoch.

A Temple, which formerly stood about 21/4 M. to the N. of Eaneh,
is now represented only by a few fragments of columns, which bear the
name of one of the emperors; and with it have disappeared also the
beautiful zodiac and the lists of peoples, among which Macedonians and
Persians were mentioned. This temple too was dedicated to Khnum. - An-
other temple, dating from the later Ptolemies, stood on the W. bank opposite
Esneh (Contra Latopom); but this was demolished before 1 & 30 and has
left not a trace behind.

Numerous memorials of an early Christian civilization are still to be
traced in the Convent of Ammonia, which is considered the oldest con-
vent in Egypt and which was certainly founded at a. very early date,
possibly by the Empress Helena. The route thence from the town follows
at flrat an embankment towards the 8., and then strikes off to the W.
across the fleldm The Convent Litrvary still contains numerous Coptic 1i-
turgical writings, some of them lying on the Mor in a locked room. A
visit to the now abandoned convent, the key of which is kept by one of
the fellahin, is not without interest, for the sake both of the curious M85.
and of the ancient paintings and Coptic inscriptions. A cruel persecution
of the Christians is said to have taken place at Esneh under Diocletian
at the beginning of the 4th cent; and the convent is said to have been
founded in honour of the martyrs who suffered here. According to other
accounts the Christians expelled from Medinet Habu by the Arabs were
massacred here.

About 71/211. to the N.W. of Esneh, on the road to ermE11'grgah (p.

mausolea.
