the goods transported hither on camels, or, at an earlier period, On asses,
as is ex reasly mentioned in the great Harris Papyrus (Ramses m.,
1320 13.0.' The deéert-route to Fottr unites with that from 156118 ]: at el-
Karn before Lugétah (p. 75). Koptos early became an em orium for many
kinds of goods, Inscriptions of the 6th Dyn. are found by t a side of the old
tmde-route to the Red See. at the WLfi lytsqiirmiit (p. 76). In a tomb at
Benihmn belonging to Ameni, a princely official under the 12th Dym, is
an inscription recording the treasures brought by Ameni to Eoptos in
the train of the erown-prinee Usertesen. Keptes was the capital of the
Mth name of Upper Egypt, which bore two hawks on its banner. Its

name appears in hieroglyphies ae if mu and if J 8Jt'febu;

in Coptic It is Ref! and Kebta; in Greek outoc, Kama, Ko 10c, etc. The
Arable Fen corresponds to the Captie Keft. The deity ehie y worshipped
here from a very early period was Khem Min (Vol. L, p, 138), whose wife
was called Isis, and son Horus. Osiris also had a. burial-place here
(He nub'Gold house'), in which a part of his body (called gab) was

reservetl. The book of magic, the search for which is narrated in the

emetic romance of Setnau, was sunk in the Nile at Koptos. A medical
leather-roll found at Keptes, and now in the British Museum, is said to
have been written'in the reign of Khut'u or Cheapo (tth Dyn.). Koptoa
was fortified as early as the 12th Dynasty, for the wealthy city and eth
routes leading to it required to be'ii" i'dAiii against the warlike tribes
who lurked between the Nile and the Arabian mountains, and who, even
antler the Roman emperurs, were a source of danger. Guards were
especially necessary at this point, for there is no doubt that a considerable
number of Phcenician merehanta had settled in Koptos at a very early
date along with the Egyptians, and were engaged in importing the products
of Arabia, and at a later date even those of India, which were conveyed
Via Arabia to the Egyptian Red Sea ports afterwards called Berenike and
Leukos Limen, and thence across the desert to the Nile. The green
breecia, used for man buildings even under the Romans, was married
at 1umamiu, on the esertroute to Koptoa. It in even probe 10 that
Ireht-towa or Eut-towa means'place of the Phasnieituus', for the Phaw
nicians were named Keft or Kaft 1n Egyptian. Strabo and Pliny expressly
state that the population of the town was mixed, containing both Egyptian
and Arabic (ke. Semitic) elements. The hieroglyphic name of the town

also occurs with the dattsrminativeurign of the post, which is only used

after the names of foreign places or of places in which foreigners were
conspicuous. The reports of Platereh, Elihu, ate, concerning the strange
culta at Koptos farther indicate that a considerable Semitic community
dwelt in the town, and was regarded with hostility by their Egyptian
neighbours. Elian'a statement that the inhabitants of KoIivtos worshipped
the crocodile (Seth) and oraeiiled the hawk (Horus) can on y refer to these
Semitea. The true Egyptians revenged themselves by throwing an use
from a rock (as Plutareh narrates), because Typhon (Beth) was red-haired
and of the colour of an ass. Red-haired men (and many red-haired
Semitea are represented on the monuments) were des ised, and like all
foreigners were stigmatized as'Typhtmie', Many non- gyptians are com-
memorated at the sides of the traile-route from the Red Sea to Knptos;
names of Persian kings are nowhere more numerous.

The camp of the Beduina, who hired their camels to the caravans
and escorted them through the desert, must have anciently existed within
the circuit of the town. These Arabs appear to have been the insstigators
of a reat insurrection in Upper Egypt, which broke out under Diocletian
in 295 A.D., and led to the siege aniriiestruuion of Keptos. The town
revived somewhat under the Khalifa, bat finally decayed with the gradual
transference of the Egyptian trade to the route from $ 0963? to Keneh-
