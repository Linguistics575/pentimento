Two important and specially instructive Inscriptions describe the
various rooms in order in the course of a summary review. Une of these
forms the lower marginal inscription 0n the outside of the E. girdle-wall"
the other is On the outside of the'W. wall of the temple proper."

The inscriptions at Edfu begin their account of the different rooms
with Room 1., at the centre of the Tear-wall of the temple, which they
name'Divider of the Middle' (comp. p. 2'48). Thence they proceed to the
rooms lying to the right and left, and then to the Adytum (P1. A) and
the Prosekos rooms in front of it. Those who desire to follow the
description in order begin at Room 1. Of this 6.9. it is said:'The apart-
ment Mesen (No. 1) is in its (the temple's) centre as the chief apartment,
with the great throne of the dispenser of rays; the goddess Ma is with
him, as Hathor the great, in his shrine, the very secret place, in it (LE.
the room), whose breadth is 81/3 ells and its depth 62/3. Its wall is
painted with the cycle of the gods of the true Mesen-chamher, their
forms according to their prototypes'. The word Maser: means here pro-
bably dwelling of the helpers of Horus. In the second inscription this
room is also named Ha ken,'chamber of the victor', and it is stated that
'the figure of the protecting Horus, in his noble shape as a perching
hawk, an e11 high, with the scourge (is there to be seen). The goddess
Na is before him; she does not separate herself from him, who is ever
united with her. As Hathur, the great, she is with him in the shrine
within the mysterious cella of dark granite'. Room ll. is named'the
right chamber' and the "west chamber' or'dedicated to the god of the
west' (Osiris); Room III,'the chamber of the great' (Osiris); Room IV,
'the inner-room of the tomb-chamber'. These three are the Osiris Rooms.
Room Y is called the'room of the throne of the gods'; Room TI, the
'cloth-chamber'; then on the E. side, Room VII,'the Sebek-chamber' of
the moon-god Khunsu; thoom VIH, the sanctuary of Hathor; and Room IN,
the'throne-room of Ra'. Uf Room N we read: "the Room of the Spreader
of Wings (No. x) contains on its E. wall the divine image of the lion-
headed goddess of the north, and of the cycle of gods, that watch
over Usiris. There is the god Shu as the representative of the N. wind,
inilating his nostrils, as is his wont in the kingdom of eternity (Le. the
underworld), and the lion-headed goddess Tefnut, as the representative
of devouring fire, in the act of burning his (Usiris's) enemies, as she does
it in the place that is the goal of millions (another name for the under-
world). There also are the goddess Ment, daughter of the sun, with her
backward glance, and the great Sekhet-Artemis, the mistress of the god-
desses of vengeance'.

The Adytum or Holy of Holies (Pl. A) is next described:'The room
of the great throne (i.e. the adytum) in the centre, round which the
passage runs, is in ells 193/3 +1/s by 101/3. A door leading into the pas-
sage is found on its right and on its left side, in order to reach the
closed rooms lying round it. The sacred boat of Tesneferu the bright-
coloured and his sacred shrine are placed there; his great cella, of dark
granite, it is a wonder to behold it'. This Cella of dark granite, erected
by King Nectanebus, stands to this day in the adytum (p. 246).

With reference to the Staircases the inscription states that the E. stair
was ascended on New Year" s Day, in order to unite the god wnly his
soul, and that the w. stair was ascended to o0er saeritice in the morning.
Of the Doors in Hall D the inscription says:'The door upon its W. side
is for the bringing of refreshing water, and that on its E. side for the
bringing of meat-offerings'.

We now betake ourselves to the passage round the temple proper
(Pl. H). Special attention should be bestowed on the inscriptions

and reliefs on the Inside of the W. Girdle-wall (Pl. f f), representing
