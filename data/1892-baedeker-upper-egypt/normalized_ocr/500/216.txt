and Auletes. Antoninus Pius bestowed some attention on the decoration
of this edifice, the picturesque remains of which show that even in the age
of the Ptolemies the practice of using ancient columns for new buildings
was well understood, a practice which became very common under the
Arabs. The use of other ancient frag, ments of buildings (especially hewn
blocks of stone) was frequent even in very early times.

As We return, we may once more walk through the temple of Karnak,
a digression which will not add more than 1/2 hr. to the day's expedition.
If the traveller have made an early start, he may lunch in the hypostyle
hall of Karnak, under the shadow of the largest columns in the world,
where the destroyers of the temple and previous travellers have provided
seats in the shape of blocks of stone.



B. THE WEST BANK AT THEBES.

Passengers by the three-weeks' tourist-steamers devote the lst and 3rd
(Cook) or 2nd and 3rd (Gaze) day of their stay at Thebes to the West
Bank; those by the four-week's steamers the 2nd and 4th (Cook) or 3rd
and kth (Gaze) day; arranging in each case to spend the first day in a
visit to the sepulehral temple of Seti I. and the Tombs of the Kings (RR. 19,
20), and the second in visiting the Ramesseum, Shékh'Abd el-Furnah,
Irér el-Dledineh, and Medinet Habu (HR. 13-18). A different arratigerneni
is recommended on p. 102, for a three day's stay at Thebes, according to
which the first day's visit to the IV. hank is devoted to the Colossi of
Memnon, Medinet Habu, Dér el-31tgllneh, tihiikh'Abd plAurnah (RR. 12-
18), and the next day to the sepulchral temple of Seti I. and the Tombs
of the Kings JR. 19, 20). 1f five days are spent at Thebes, three should
he devoted to the W. bank, the first being, occupied by the Colossi of
Memnon, the temple of Medinet Habu, and Dér el-Medina (RR. 12, 15,
17), the second by the Ramesseum, the tombs of Shékh'At1dtllurnalf,
the temple of Der el-bahri, etc. (RR. 13, 18, 21), and the third by the
Temple of Seti I. and the Tombs of the Kings (RR. 19, 20), with which
Cook's and Gaze's tourists begin.

The ensuing description follows the distribution of time suggested on
p. 102 for a three day's visit to Thebes.

The following points may be visited in a single day (the 2nd of our
stay in Thebes), though not without considerable fatigue: 1. *Colossi of
Newman; 2. *Ramesseum; 3. Tombs ofKurnet Blurrai'; 4. "Medinet Habu;
5. Tombs of the Queens and Dér e1-Nedineh; 6. Tombs of Shékh'Abd
el-Furnah. A little time may be saved by beginning at the Ramesseum,
and thence proceeding to the Colossi of Nemnon, Dledinet Hahn, ete.; but
it is better to visit the Colossi first, for they are at no time so impressive
as when seen in the early morning.

An early start should he made. Guides, donkeys, etc., see p. 103. If
the dhahabiyeh has been anchored at Luxor and not beside the w. bank
(p. loo, it will be necessary to cross in a boat to the island opposite
Luxor. Donkeys are usually found here, but a large party is recommended
to order them the night before. The island, Which is dotted with bushes
and at places yrell-cultivated, is crossed in about 10 min., and the don-
keys then ford a shallow arm of the river. If the river is high, however,
travellers must row round the island. We pass the village, pleasantly
shaded by trees, and cross a very frailbridge overawater-course descend-
ing to the Nile. On the bank is a handsome farm. - A Perry (1/2 piastre)
also crosses from Luxor and lands its passengers a little higher up, a con-
venience if they are hound for the temple of Furnah and the Tombs of
the Rings.

We have already seen that the streets of Thebes with the palaces
and the dwellings of the citizens lay near the great temple of Am-

mon, on the E. bank. between the river and the Arabian moun-
