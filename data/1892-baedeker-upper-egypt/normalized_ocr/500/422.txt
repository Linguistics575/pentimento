touches of Ramses II. and his queen Nofertari. On the architrave

above is the inscription (to the left):'The living and good god

punishes the Hannu (Nubians), conquers the land of Nehesi, smites

the S. lands, ploughs the N. lands. King Ramses and his great

consort Nofertari Mer-en-mut, they have made the temple on the

in terror, the brave lion, lord of the sword, has overcome the re-
bellious lands' etc.

The pictures on the E. wall (entrance-wall) of this hall resemble
those in the great temple; to the left, the king, before Horus who
hands him the sword of victory, seizes an overthrown Tehennu (N.
tribesman) Joy the hair to slay him; to the right standing before
Ammon, he slays a negro. The legends are almost word for word the
same as those on the arehitrave. But in both the pictures in this
temple, there appears behind the king the form of his consort No-
fertari, who is named the Erpat mm, the great princess, of every
grace in her heart, the beloved palm, mistress of both lands, be-
loved of the king, and united with the ruler. Several portraits on
the pillars (to the right) show her to have been of great beauty.
She is represented wearing the fan-crown, the disc and horn crown,
and the serpent-diadem, holding in her right hand a sistrum with
the head of Hathor, and a flower-stem in her left.

On the S. wall the king appears between the deities Horus,10rd

staves, with the notches for the years, and the symbols of eternity.
Here also appears Hathor with a harp, generally called mistress of

bel. Three doors lead hence into a narrow apartment, which con-
tains a picture of the queen between Isis and Hathor. On each side
of this room is a recess, and another at the back. In the last is a
remarkable figure of Hathor standing in a temple, with a human
head and above it a cow's head with horns surmounted by the disc
and two fans. The king stands outside the temple, offering flowers.

To the N. of the small temple and still on the smoothed part of
the cliff, we observe a tablet on which a prince of Kush, Ani by
name, a man oikhinensu, appears with the fan and princely staff
before Ramses the Great; beside it is a finely executed stele, con-
taining; the homage of a grandee to the king. To the S. of the great
temple is a passage with a somewhat weather-worn stele facing the
N., dating from the 34th year of the king. This is more espeeially
interesting from the fact that above, to the right of the king who
sits beneath a car10Ily between two gods, appears the beautiful
