brought to be sacrificed. The laudlng-place on the other bank, op-
posite Karnak, was united with the temple of liurnah by rows of
sphinxes. As the ancient pilgrim continued on his way towards the
NW. and crossed the hill of the cemetery now called eI-Asasif, he,
came in sight of the rocky amphitheatre which enclosed the terraced
precincts of the temple of D & el-Bahri. Northwards from Iiurnah a
well-made route led to the valley of the Tombs of the Kings, 110w
called Bibim el-Mnlt'lk, which could also be reached by a shorter
though more fatiguing mountain-path from el-Asasif. Between the
entrance of the valley of the kings' Tombs and el-Asasif and close
to the mountain lay the necropolis known as Drah Abu' ] Neggah.
Thence following the edge of the fertile strip towards the S.W. we
reach the magnificent Ramesseum. Behind rises the mountain-ridge.
The tombs on its E. slope, partly occupied as dwellings by the
fellahin, belong to the village now called Shékh'Abd el-Kurnah.
As we gaze down upon the plain from the liigher-1ying graves, the
Colossi of Memnon are conspicuous in the midst of the fertile belt.
', ehiud these are the prominent ruins, known as K6m el-Hétan,
rising near the central point of an imaginary line connecting the
Ramesseum with the temple of Medinet Habu, the magrnT1cent
Iremnonium of Ramses III. Turning from Medinet Habu to the
S.W., we reach a small temple of the Ptolemies; to the N., near
the mountains, lies the valley with the Tombs of the Queens; and
skirting the line of hills to the NW. we reach the scanty tomb-
remains of Igurnet Nurraf, to the W. of which lies a valley with
the small but interesting temple of Dér el-Mediueh. Two points
are of special value for taking one's bearings. One is the summit
of the mountain lying between el-Asasif and Bibin e1-Nrt1i1ki the
other is the door of either of two tombs at Shékh'Abd e1-l.furnah.
One of the tnmhs, in which Lepsius lived, is known to the guides as
Jia: .sr Lepsius; the other was inhabited by Ebers, who is remembered
by the fellahiu as Abu Btslos (Father of Paul).
The name THEBES is probably the Creek form of the Egyptian

Meyale or Diospolis Muyna to distinguish it from Diospolis Parva

The famous capital of Upper Egypt was certainly founded Ilu-
