No. 2 () (see above) to the tomb of Ramenkheperseneb (No. 34),
which, having been opened only for a few years, is remarkably well
preserved and is well worth a visit. For stout people, however, the
entrance is almost too narrow. The deceased was chief architect to
Tutmes III. The right hand inner wall ot the large hall tells us of the
important works which were entrusted to him, such as the carving
of a statue of the king from a single stone, the erection of a hall of
pillars, and of numerous obelisks. Here again we see tribute being
brought by princes, of Keftu (the Phoenicians), of Kheta, Tunep,
Kat, Katesh, etc. The arms and helmets of the foreigners, their
carriages and handsome vases are remarkable. Near this, a little
to the right, is the fine and well-preserved tomb (No. 5-1) of Amen-
emha, the scribe of the harvest, in which should be noticed the
harper and the long list of relations of the deceased, whose father
and mother were named Tutmes and Entef. In a passage there are
represented barges with mummies of himself and his wife Bekt.
In the last chamber there is a Stele of the 28th year of Tutmes III.
The shaft in the tomb contains a large room covered with writings
Still farther to the right is the tomb (No. 60) of a prince (erpa-hi)
Entefaker, and on the N.E. slope that of Amkhent, the son of Auta,
which was completely excavated in 1883. A descent should now
be made to the gallery, in front of which is seen Wilkinson's House,
and to the tomb (No. 88) of Imaiseb, who was scribe of the altars
of sacrifice under Ramses IS. (Neferkara). The festal barges with
the name of the king should be noticed, as well as the many golden
utensils, and the money-bags, and also a series of kings, among
whom appears King Raskenen, who fought against the Hyksos, and
whose remarkable mummy is in the museum at Gizeh.

We now descend to the plain, where there are a few more tombs
to be seen in the direction of el-Asasif, including that of Nefer-
hotep, who lived under King Horus, the last of the 18th Dynasty.
In this should be especially noticed the funeral processions by boat
which have been copied by Wilkinson (Manners and Customs). The
funeral services are also recorded.

We have to crawl through the entrance which is choked up. The
ceiling is decorated, and has a regularly recurring series of hieroglyphics,
signifying'First' and'Prophet'; the deceased in fact held the office of
Prophet of Ammon. The family scene in the first room explains itself;
the 39 rows of hieroglyphics above record the names of the relations of
the deceased, who on the left are paying homage to King Horus with
whom they were closely connected. In the second room we see Nefer-
hotep, sitting by the side of his sister who is adorned with flowers. Be-
hind them is an "Inscription which indicates that distinguished Egyptian
families kept private bands of music: and it may be that the special
duty of the harper whose song has been handed down to posterity by
this inscription, was to gladden the hearts of the family when they were
assembled in their aneestor's tomb for the solemnities in his honour.
The song is not in any way of a mournful character, and it is clear that
in the time of the Pharaohs, it was a pleasure to be reminded in the
tombs of the shortness of life, and the duty to enjoy it, so long as it
lasted. The song is headed:'The words of the harper, who tarries in
