each side of the first apartment. Behind the temple proper, which
is only 42 ft. long, is a small recess hewn in the rock, and adorned

The village of Gerf Husén occupies the site of Tulzis, a place
mentioned in the Itinerarium Antonini, 20 Roman miles, i.e. 18
Engl. M., above Talmis (Aialabsloeh). The sacred name of this

place was, Pa Ptah, the House ofPtah. The pylon, of which

standing (the two to the right have disappeared), and seven of the
original eight pillars, with somewhat clumsy Osiris-statues. The
last bear on their shoulders the name of Ramses IL, who built this
temple and is the only king mentioned in it. He appears not only
as the founder, but also as one of the deities to be worshipped here.
On the beams of the arehitrave he is named with both his names as

and conqueror of his foes (expressed pictorially). The next room
(45 ft. square), hewn out of the rock, requires artificial light; it
produces a serious and gloomy effect. The ceiling is supported by
six Osiris-pillars, 28 ft. high, representing the king as Osiris, with
the crown on his head, his crossed arms bearing the signs of rule
