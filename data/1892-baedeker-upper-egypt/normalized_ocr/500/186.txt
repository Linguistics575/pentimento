The lower parts, especially in the sanctuary-chambers, are covered
with rubbish. A long List of (Y'erings on the left (E.) exterior
wall is of some interest. It records that Ramses m., in the month
Payni in the 16th year of his reign, decreed that gifts for his father
Ammon-Ra, the king of the gods, should be laid upon the silver
altar, such as provisions, sacrificial cakes, etc. Then follow some
details (injured) as to the amount of the offerings.

3. The Portique des Bubastites (Portico of the Bubastites; Pl. a),
so called by Champollion, is the part of the court. between the left
(E) wall of the temple just described and the S. part (Lee. tho far-
thest to the right) of the second pylon. This space, only 43 ft. wide,
had a door admitting to the temple from the s., and is to be regarded
as the E. end of the colonnade which lined the S. wall of the court.
Two 1rnsculpt1sred papyrus-bud columns divide It from the rest
of the court. Numerous inscriptions dating from the 22nd Dyn.,
which originated in Bubastis, cover the walls, and contain impor-
tant material for the history of that period. This dynasty succeeded
the inglorious line of priest-kings, who seized the throne of Thebes
after the self-indulgent rulers of the 20th dynasty. Their names
are rather Semitic than Egyptian, a circumstance that need cause
no surprise when we remember that Bubastis is named as their
home, a city in the E. part of the Delta which was settled by Semitic
tribes. As their names appear to be of Aramaic origin it is not
impossible that they were placed upon the throne of the Pharaohs
by the Assyrian conquerors who are mentioned in the cuneiform
inscriptions of Mesopotamia, though the Egyptian hieroglyphics
ignore them. Like their predecessors of the let Dyn., they retained
the chief priesthood in their own control, apparently by committing
this office to their heirs. 1n the hall in which we now are the
king appears several times with the crown-prince, who is named
'tirst prophet of Ammon-Ra'; and the crown-prince occurs also
without his father. Sheshenk l, probably began the decoration of
the building, for his name appears in the usual place for the de-
rlication-inscription, i.e. on the architrave above the columns. The
names of Osorkon I. and Takelut I. also occur. The last-named
king appears before Ammon-Ra accompanied by his son Osorkon,
clad in the priestly panther-skin; and Osorkon also occurs alone
offering sacrifice to Ammon. On the E. wall is a double painting
representing Ammon to the right and left, wearing the feather-
crown and seated on a throne, while the deceased son of the same
Osorkon approaches in priestly garb to offer saerifice. Beneath is a
long but unfortunately damaged Inscription, dating from the l'lth
year of Takelut IL, which mentions a remarkable event said to
have occurred in the reign of the father of that prince (probably
Shesheuk ll.). The passage in question is not absolutely clear,
but this much may be gathered with certainty, viz. that on the 25th
Mesori in the 15th year of the father of Take111t11., something 1111-
