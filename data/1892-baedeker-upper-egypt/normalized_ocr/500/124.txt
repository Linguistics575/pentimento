Between Beliineh and lieneh the Dam Palm (llyphzeua the-
baica) becomes more and more common, generally occurring in
groups and increasing in size and beauty as we travel southwards
(pomp. p.'28). It is a fan-leaved palm of moderate height, dividing
into two parts at the upper end of the stem and sometimes repeat-
ing this bifurcation two or three times. It extends far to the S. of
Egypt, and whole forests of it are found on the upper Nile. Its
large nuts contain a soft and fibrous pulp, which is edible and
tastes like sweet cake; while various objects are made out of the
hard rind. Its timber and hast are also of considerable industrial
value.

The ancient Lepidotum must have lain on the E. bank of the
river opposite Ileliineh; but, though described by Ptolemy as a
large town, no trace of it remains. The Lepidotus (the Cypriuus
lepidotus of Geoffroy, and Cinex deutex of Savigny) was held here
in high honour, though, according to Plutarch, it was one of the
fishes that swallowed the Phallus of Osiris and was hence generally
regarded with special abhorrence.

From Ilelifmeh to Keneh the Nile valley lies almost due E. and
W. About 4 M. from the S. bank lies Samltfid, on ancient rubbish-
mounds. Naqi-Hamadi, also on the S. bank, IO M. from Belifmeh,
is the station for 1? arshiit, 3 M. to the s., now an uninteresting
village with a large sugar-faetory belonging to the Khedive.

So late as the 18th cent. this was still the seat of the great s1itkli,
who was the head of the Fawciris (pl. of Ftivis, here pron. Haviiris), ur
tribes of mounted Arabs on the left bank of the Nile. The emnparntive
width of the river-plain makes horse-breeding an important, oecupation
among these tribes, and their shaggy grey dogs are also celebrated. T.lys
letters are frequently seen guarding the flocks of sheep, and are, easily
distinguishable from the, worthless and cowardly curs that haunt the
streets of the towns and villages. When encouraged to attack by their
owners, these brave animals are exceedingly dangerous antagonists.--

91/2 M. IL5u (W. bank) and Kasr es-Saiyad (E. bank) he nearly
opposite one another, at one of the sharpest bends in the stream.
Il√©u, a large but miserable-looking village, was the home of Shekh
Selim, who died a few years ago, at a very advanced age, after
sitting stark naked on the bank of the Nile for 53 years; he was
regarded by pious Moslems with great honour and was deemed to
possess great powers in helping navigation and barren Women. Ilis
grave here is covered with Arabic, inscriptions and votive-gifts in
the form of small boats.

Those who wish to visit the scanty ruins of the ancient Diospolis
Parva traverse the village in the direction of the mountains, cross two
deep ilitehes, near which stand the finely built piers of a ruined
bridge, and reach (25 min.) a large mound of debris, known as Gebel 1167'
(i.e. Horus). This is the, only remnant of the ancient Diospolis, with the
exception of a fragment of a temple of the Ptolemies in the village,
