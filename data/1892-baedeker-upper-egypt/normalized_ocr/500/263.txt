the sides of the tirst and third were placed niches of which only one (on
the left) is preserved in the first hall, and three in the third. There is a
wide passage between halls 1 and l?.. The third hall is adjoined by a
fourth smaller room. On the left of the entrance is A" hq-em-lit7t offering
a prayer to Ita with uplifted hands. In the niche io the left two statues
of Rha-em-ltiit and his relative, Imhotep, the treasurer (the neighbouring
tomb 121 belonged to an Imhotep). On the right of the entrance is the
deceased offering two dishes with two geese in each. On the left are four
series; in the two upper, fowling scenes; helow the king driving a four-
horse chariot l and in the lowest, harvest scenes. A flute player encourages
the veapers. On the inner wall to the left, Rha-om-lfiit presents a report on

the harvest to King Amenhotep Ill. oi)'CCD? Sitting beneath

a canopy. The nine captive tribes, at the foot of the canopy, among whom
are Greeks (Hanebu), should be noticed. (in the right again the deceased
with a peculiar head-dress delivers to the king the harvest report of the
year 30. Behind him are two rows of his officials in humble attitude.
The e, hess-board decoration of the ceiling is peculiar. In the entrance to
the second hall on the right, there is a long 16 column inscription of
Jeeply-eut hiernglyphics. In the second hall are several chapters of the
Book of the Dead (110, 11?). The sides of the third hall are destroyed,
the fourth was entirely without inscriptions.

To the right at no great distance is a tomb first opened in 1882
(now No. 118), known as Stuart's Tomb from its discoverer Yilliers
'Stuart. 1t belonged to Ramses, a mayor (mer nut zet) and his sister
Ptuhnm-it, of the time of AmenhoteplV., the sun-wor: hipper, who,
as lou-en-Men (splendour of' the sun) removed his residence to
Tell el-Amarnah (see p. 22. Here as there the sun is represented
with his rays spread out as hands protecting the king and queen.
Proceeding a little farther to the s., we soon reach the tomb of
Nelda! (No. 1'.25), first opened in 1889 (the door unlocked on IC-
quest) with representations of fowling, wine-pressing, etc.; the
drawing is rough but the colours fresh and well preserved. We then
climb the someehat steep hill and, passing the richly decorated tomb
(N0. 119) of Amenuser, who lived under Tutmes IlI., come to
that marked No. 33. Khamsateltitin, by Wilkinson, at one time
considered the most worth visiting of all. It consists of a vestibule,
and a large chamber from the centre of which an unusually long
passage of remarkable and gradually increasing height runs into the
rock. 1t u as laid out by a prince. governor, etc., named Itekh-ma-r2,
who died in the time ofAmenhotep IL, the successor of Tutmes IH.,
when the tributes of Asia were flowing into Egypt in exceptional
abundance, to the benefit of the relations and favourites of the royal
family.

The pictorial decoration of the walls can now be scarcely seen, and
can be much better studied in the works of Wilkinson and IIoskins
(Ethiopia) The tomh served as the ahude of old 1Justm Berlin the com-
panion of Harris and Lepsius, and is a convenient room for luncheon.
The opportunity should be taken Oflonking at the faded paintings of the
left enrridor, and of the, passage into the rock. They represent payment
nf tribute by the Ethiopians (Punt, Kefa) and Asiaiics (Retennu), various
kinds of work such as hrick-making for building, pottery, carpentry,
joinery, glass-blowing, carving and polishing, of statues, and a company
of mourners with harpers and women playing musical instruments.
