sixty years of age, who sat with his long neck craning forward so long
as we hovered in danger, and who, with his eyes sparkling with intense
excitement and his lean bird-like face, looked like an eagle on the look
out for prey. All went well at li1st. Only a man and boy, however,
w ere rowing on the left side, while two men w ere rowing on the right.
As we quitted the second rapid and were entering a different channel,
the sailors on the left side had to row with all their strength; that,
however, proved inadequate and the stream swept the boat round, so that
the stern was foremost. This was the culminating point of the passage.
The re'is without losing his presence of mind for an instant, guided the
helm with his foot, while he assisted the rowers with his arms, turned
the boat round once more, brought it into the right channel, and finally
into the less rapid part of the Nile, and so to Assuiin. The entire passage
lasted 42 minutes.

FROM MAHADAH TO Plum: the crooked road skirts the bank of
the river. The village-children pursue the traveller, begging for
bakshish. When the path, covered with granite-dust, grows narrower
and begins to lead over smooth granite, the traveller should dis-
mount. The curiously-shapedrocks1'11 the bed anion the bank 0fthe
Nile bear numerous inscriptions. Some of them look as though they
had been built. up out of artificially rounded blocks. These forms
seem to have struck the aneient Egyptians most forcibly, for in the
relief of the Source of the Nile at Phila (p. 294) - one of the few
representations of landscape in Eg pt - the river- -god crouches
Under a pile of blocks like these. 111 25 min.we reach a small plain
and obtain a charming view of Phila, the most beautiful spot 011
the Nile, and the goal of travellers iwho: do not wish to go on to the
second cataract. The small plain above-mentioned, to the E. of the
island, is shaded with handsome sycamore trees, near which is a
long lowbuilding ofa semi-European appearance, with battlemented
roof. This is the deserted station of the Roman Catholic missionaries,
who hence founded settlements in Central Africa, all of which, how-

smooth water, presents, with its imposing temple,

graceful kiosque, and flourishing vegetation, a

beautiful contrast to the 1011 gged, bare and precipi-

village of Shellil. Between the railway-station of Shellal and the

Nile is a fine palm-grove, with the tents of the Egyptian troops

under British command. The handsome dhahahiyeh near the bank

is the residence of the commandant. Breakfast may be obtained on

board, but those who come by rail are recommended to bring their
provisions with them from Asstian.
