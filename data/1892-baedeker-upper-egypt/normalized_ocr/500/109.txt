of the adjoining village,'Arftliat el-3radfthlel1, i.e. tArabat of the buried'.
Possibly the last portion of the name may refer to Osiris, whose grave
here attracted so many pilgrims, and Madftin (masc.) may be a translation
of the old name of the tempIe-quarter of Abydos. In spite of the most
lavish expenditure of time, money, and labour, the excavators failed to
find either the spring mentioned by Strabo or the tomb of Osiris, and yet
the latter must lie close to the part of the ruins called Kihn es-Sulttin,
near the holy hill of Abydos so often mentioned in the inscriptions.

Iwwm, applied to any large monument or memorial, whether architec-

the ancient Egyptians as a Mew√©wov (Memnonion) or palace of Memnon.
Perhaps they tirst heard the name Nennu given to the colossal figures of
Amenhotep III. at Thebes (P. 153) and were attracted by its resemblance
in sound to the name of the son of Eos who fell before Troy; hence
they called the figures. afterwards so celebrated, statues of Memnon, and
saw Memnonia, or palaces of the same here, in some of the large 1uemorial
buildings described as Meunu. The fact that the Hellenes did not apply
this name to all the great buildings of Egypt, but only to some of the
temples of W. Thebes and to the sanctuary of Seti at Abydos, may be
explained by the supposition that in the time of the Pharaohs these build-
ings monopolised the epithet of Meumu, just as the fortress of the Con-
queror in London is known as the Tower par excellence among the
numerous towers of that city. The temple of Seti became known as the
Meninonium or Palace of Memnon in the Alexandrine period, and a
natural consequence was the conversion of the name Abtu into the simi-
larly sounding Abytlos or Ahydus, the name of a town of Troas on the
Hellespont, not far from the burial-place of Memnon. By degrees the
Asiatic hero, son of Tithonus and Eos and ally of Priam (comp. p. ICM),
was converted into an Ethiopian, and the lively imagination of the Greeks
transferred the Asiatic legends to Egypt and adapted them to Egyptian
conditions. Thus they related that Tithonus sent an Ethiopian army to aid
his son against Troy. These soldiers, however, heard of the death of
Memnon at Ahydos in Upper Egypt and retraeed their steps, after Lang-
ing their garlands on the acacias in the holy grove at the Memnonium.
tirds were fabled to have sprung from the ashes of Memnon, and reap-
peared on certain days every year, removed alliimpurities from his grave,
dipped their wings in the Aesopos, which flows into the Propontis at Cy-
zieus, and sprinkled the grave with the water. At a later date these birds
wore said to come from Ethiopia. Finally it was asserted that the Egyp-
tian Ahydos bad been founded by colonists from its Asiatic namesake.

The Memnoninm of Abydos is not an ordinary divine or religio11s
temple like those of Denderah, Kamak, and Edfn, but is rather one
of the series of sepulehral sanctuaries of which mention is made at
p. 170 of Baedeker's Lower Egypt. The numerous representations
and inscriptions that cover its walls are mostly of a very general
nature. They tell us, however, that the building they adorn was
primarily intended for funereal purposes. As already mentioned,
the bodies of numerous princes and grandees were brought here to
participate in the blessings that were supposed to emanate from the.
saered tomb of Osiris. I'he Pharaohs nowhere offered saeriflees to
the mnnes of their forefathers more gladly than at Ahydos, and
prayers were put up here to the Osiris-kings of the ancient house
