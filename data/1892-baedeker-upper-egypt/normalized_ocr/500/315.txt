whose name also occurs with Aahmes, Binpu, and a king Suazen
on the pedestal of a statuette of IIarpocrates, now in the museum
at Gizeh. Those, with the exception, of course, ofAahmes, were
probably provincial or local kings. Above some ships in the left
part of the tomb a festival of llamses Ill. is mentioned, probably a
later addition. According to Maspero this tomb dates from the
20th Dynasty.

Farther to the left lies the tomb of Aahmes, Chief of the Sailors,
the son of Alma and her husband Baba, who was the maternal
grandfather of Pihari. The Funcreat Inscription is carved in the
rock instead ofbeing painted on stucco, a fact which lends great
importance to this tomb.

The inscription covers nearly the whole wall to the right, as we
enter, sharing it with the figure of the deceased. Aahmes appears with
Aipu his wife, seated in a chair beneath which cowers a pet monkey;
before them stand their daughter's son Pihari, who caused this tomb to
be adorned for his gallant grandfather. Beneath is another Pihar, offering
sacrifice to his father Jfarari and his wife, and beneath him again are
three sons, including yet another Hhats. Beside the door to the side-
chamber is another dedication to Aahmes, the chief of the sailors, from
his grandson Pihari (p. 239), to keep his memory green in this spot. The
biography of Aahmes thus begins:'Aahmes (Amasis), commander of the
sailors, son of the late Abna, speaks: I speak to you, all ye people. Learn
the marks of honour which fell to my share; for I was distinguished
seven times with the golden necklace, in the presence of the whole coun-
try... Male and female slaves were my own (the names of the slaves
presented to Aahmes are inscribed on the outside of the tomb), and I
received many tields. The name of a great hero which he (the speaker)
won for himself, will nevermnre be obscured in this land. He speaks:
I was born in the town of Hebent (Eileithyia); my father was a colonel
under the late king Rasekenen (Vol. I., p. 83), and was named Baha, son
of Roan; then I served in his stead as captain on hoard the ship'The
Young (is', in the reign of Ra-ueh-pehti (Le. Aahmes I.). I was young
and unmarried and slept on the couch of the Khennu (perhaps those ex-
cluded from the dwelling of the married, i.e. bachelors). But after 1 had
founded a household (taken a wife), I hetook myself to fight in the N.
fleet. Then Ifnllowed the king on foot, when he mounted his war-
chariot. When the fortress of Ha-war (Aharis, a stronghold of the Hyksos,
V01.I., p. bi) ) was besieged, I had to fight on foot before the king. Then
1 was appointed to the ship'Kha em 3lennefer' (Ascent in Memphis); we
fought in the arm of the river at Aharis and I acquired booty and won
a hand (of a slaughtered enemy). This was reported to the officer of the
king, and I received the golden necklace for valour. Another contest took
place on the same spot and l was again awarded the golden necklace fur
valour'. Aahmes was decorated a third time at Takemi, to the S. of the
fortress.'Aharis was taken and I captured there in all l persons, a man
and 3 women; Ilis Majesty assigned them to me as slaves'. - The next
lines inform us that after the king hm ] captured the furtress of the Hyk-
SOS and Overcome the nomadic tribes, he carried on war with the tribes
of the s., in which Aahmes took part and won fresh laurels. He served
also under Amenhotep l. and Tutmesl. Under the last-namerl prince the
Egyptian army penetrated far into Asia. The inscription goes on:'There-
upon his majesty set out for Syria (Iluten), in order to reduce the peoples
to his good pleasure, He reached Mesopotamia (Naharina). His Majesty,
the living, sound, and strung one, met this wretched one (the prince of
Mesopotamia), and undertook the attack. The king wrought terrible hut-
chery among them; and the prisoners taken alive by His Majesty were
innumerable. I was present as colonel of my soldiers, and Ilis Majesty
praised my bravery. I captured a war-ehariot, with its horses, and him
