to the right, Isis with Hor-hut presents him with the staff of victory.
Half of the figures have been deliberately defaced.

The Ascent of the Pylons, commanding an excellent view of the whole
island and its surrounding, is made from the peristyle court entered by
the central portal. Within this portal, to the right, is the following Ia-.
scription:'L'an 6 de la république, le 13 messidor. L'ne armée frangaise
commandée par Bonaparte est descendue it Alexandrie. L'armée ayant
mis 2O jours aprés les mammelouks en fuite aux Pyramides, Desaix com-
mandant la premiere division les a poursuivies au deli! des cataractes oil
il est arrive le 13 ventose de I'an 7'. (i.e. March 3, 1799). Then follow
the names of the brigadier-generals. - The staircase leading to the top
of the *East Tower begins in the small chamber (Pl. c), in the S.E. comer
of the peristyle court. It ascends gradually, round a square newel, Sev-
eral unadorned chambers, probably used for the storing of astronomical
instruments and for the use of astrologers, are to be found within the
tower. They are feebly lighted by window-openings, decreasing in size
towards the outside wall. - The West Tower can only be reached from
the E. tower. The crosses on the stones of the roof formerly held braces
of wood or iron.

Two Obelisks and two Lions, all of granite, formerly stood be-.
fore the entrance. The foot of the W. obelisk is all that remains of
the former; the latter lie much damag, ed on the ground. Numerous
Greek Inscriptions have been carved here by pilgrims. -Adjoining
the S.E. side of the pylon is the beautiful Gateway (Pl. G) of Pto-
lemy IL Philadelphus, who appears on its E. side. On its W.
wall, to the right and left, is the emperor Tiberius, above, Phila-.
delphus.

d. The Inner Peristy1e (Pl.I), bounded on the S. by Pylon IL,
is bounded on the N. by another Pylon (Pl. K). These, however,
are by no means parallel to each other, while the edifices to the
E. and W. of the peristyle are so entirely different, that it is at
once apparent that the court was not constructed according to any
preconceived plan. The requirements of the moment and the avail-
able space were taken into account, not any artistic considera-
tions. Nevertheless this court, entirely enclosed by buildings of
the most varied forms, must be described as unusually effective.
On the E. and W. are two oblong edifices, each with columns on
the side next the court. That to the W. (left) is a distinct temple,
forming a kind of peripteros; that to the E. was used by the
priests. This court, which is mostly uneven, contains one spot ex-
eellently adapted for the pitching of a tent. Cook's parties usually
lunch here; if there are more than one party at the same time, the
second lunches in the Mosque (Pl. Pi).

e. The Temple to the W. of the Peristyle (Pl. L) stands im-
mediately behind the left Cw.) wing of the first pylon, and a door-
way in the latter (p. 287) lies exactly opposite the S. Entrance
Door (Pl. d) of the temple, from which it is separated only by a
narrow open passage. At the N. end of the colonnade on the side
of the temple next the court is a side-entrance. The S. door ad-.
mits to a Pronaos with 4 columns, of which two are engaged in
the portal. Beyond lies a Calla with three chambers, surrounded
on three sides by a colonnade. This temple was founded by Pto-
