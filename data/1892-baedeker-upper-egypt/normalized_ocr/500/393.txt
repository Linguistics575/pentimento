their house. For whosoever raise themselves against me, them I deprive

On the pillar between the two columns to the right of the Bll-
trance to the main temple is another Greek inscription. This is a
decree ofAureliuc, Ilesarion, alsnnamed Amonius, military governor
of Ombos and Eiephantine, ordering the owners of swine to remove
their animals from the holy Talmis. It probably dates from the
year 248-0 AJ). - (in the left side of the elegant entranctr-do0r

Leaving now' the entrance-wall with its four columns behind us,
we fhul oursolves in the main building of the temple, the portico
proper, which is 40 ft. deep and 6611. broad. This portico is con-
siderabiy higher than the three rooms behind it, from which a
double staircase, ascends to the roof (now fallen ] of the portico. It
has four, or including thoqe of the entrance wall six, elegant co-
lumns On each side, with varying capitals. Only two, on tho left,
are now standing in the interior. On the E. wall the emperor ap-
pears saerificing to the gods of Talmis, and adjoining this scene is
the above-mentioned relief of Amenhotep II. presenting wine and
milk to Iihern-Ammom---The next three rooms are small (171/2 ft.
deep and 40 ft. wide), and have sacrif1eial scenes on their walls.
Each probably contained two columns, those in the second room
being still preserved. The staircase to the roof ascended to the left
from the first room. On the outside of the W. back-wall of the
temple are various well-preserved representations, including the god-
dess Isis with Ptolemy (laesarion, son of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra.
The temple, like that of Edfu, is surrounded by a passage, widen-

sides; and, as mentioned above, there is also a second and wider
passage outside the first one, with which it has communication by
means of a door (m the left side. This outer passage could be closed
by means of doors. The whole structure is a faithful reproduction
of' an early Egyptian temple, hut dates from Roman times.

The little *Temple of Bét el-Walli, situated upon a hill about
20 min. to the N., is much more noteworthy than the large Roman
erection at lialabsheh. The way to it leads along the verge of the
mountain, level at first, but finally asrends steeply. The temple
consists of a vestibule, of which only the side walls are, now stand-
ing, a main chamber, entereiiby a central and two side doors, and a
small adytum, adjoining the latter. In the vestibule our interest is
excited by the warlike scenes on the sido-walls. These indicate
