II. Monetary System.

The information as to the Egyptian monetary system given on
pp.4, 5 of our first VOL, has ] to be supplemented by the statement
that the Egyptian Government has recently issued new silver coins
and some gold coins, and that these now form the only legal cur-
rency throughout the whole country, where their value is uniform.
The unit of reckoning is still the Piastrc (Arabic Ghirsh, plur.
Ghmsh). The Egyptian Pound is divided into 100 piastres or
1000 Jlitti? emes.
