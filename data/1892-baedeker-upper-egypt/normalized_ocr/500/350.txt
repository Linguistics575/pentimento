274 Route 28. FIRST CATARAGT. From AssuMn

are fastened to the mast, and the severe struggle with the descend-
ing current-begins. Some haul on the ropes from the bank, others
guide the course of the vessel with poles from on hoard, and others
in the water keep it upright or ward it off from striking on sharp
rocks in the river-bed. Old men, young men, and boys rival each
other in the most exhausting activity, that seems almost frantic,
from its never-ceasing accompaniment of shouts, cries, and chants.
Every saint in the calendar is invoked, especially the beneficent
Sa'id, who is believed to render especially eifeetire aid in sudden
dangers. At the most difticult point, the Bab el-rel/ir (p. 278)
boys, for a small fee, will plunge 1sead-tirst into the stream, to
reappear astride pieces of wood below the boiling surf, through
which they swim with marvellous skill. If the work is not accom-
plished before sun-set, it is left unfinished till next morning. -
It may be remarked that the Egyptian government contemplates
widening the channel and introducing tised regulations for the
passage. - The time occupied in taking the dhahabiyeh through the
rapids may be advantageously turned to account by the traveller by
first inspecting the cataract from the bank and then, by proceeding
by land to Philae, where he should pitch his tent or take up his
abode in the Osiris room (p. 295). The most necessary articles can
easily be transported through the rapids by a few of the sailors
in the small boat. The dragoman will arrange the new household
with the assistance of the cook and the camp-servant. A few days
spent at Phila, especially at full moon, will not easily be forgotten.
---It is not advisable to bring the dhahahiyeh as far as the island
of Seh√©l and to visit Philae thence, because there are no donkeys
to be there obtained.

b. From AssuM1 to Phila by land.

Railway in 1/2 hr., fare 5 piastres; one train daily (1891) to Shellfil
at 8.30 a.m., returning at 11 a.m. - The Ride to Philee takes 11/2 hr.;
excellent donkeys at the landing-plaee. Rich inhabitants of Assuiin spend
large sums upon their riding-asses; spirited Abyssinian donkeys, if they
are also handsome, cost from 301. upwards. - The inspection of the ob-
jects of interest of AssuL1 occupies 3-4 hrs.

The route leads past the Post of/ice into the town, then turns to the
right (leaving the Bazaar on the left) and follows the telegraph-wires
across a (5 min.) bridge over the railway to Philse (Shell21). The Ptole-
maie Temple lies a few minutes to the left, below (see below). Thence we
proceed straight on to the Mohammedan Tombs, passing on the way the
graves of an Austrian and of a sailor of the British ship Ufonarch' (Dawe;
d. 1881). The Quarries are reached from the Ptolemaic temple by con-
tinuing straight On for a few minutes, then turning abruptly into the
desert path, which soon brings us in sight of tall blocks of stone, behind
which is the quarry (p. 276). The obelisk lies 10 min. to the right ofthe
above-mentioned European graves.

1. THE PTOLEMAIC TEMPLE.

The attentive observer will notice many blocks and slabs with
hieroglyphic inscriptions built into the houses of Assuin. In the
