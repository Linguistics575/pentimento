was sacred to Khem, ale. Ammon during the process of his self-pro-
creation, and may be regarded as one of the greatest of the Egyptian
festivals, as even among the representations in the Ramesseum and
elsewhere a conspicuous place is given to it. It might well be solemn-
ized in a Memnonium, for Khem caused the new birth of the dead
god, and the soul separated from the body arose to new life, as the
vanished orb of night returns at the new moon. As the inscription
of Ammon-em-heh says, the heir to the throne succeeded the dead
Pharaoh on the following day, just as one moon succeeds another
after a moonless night. The inscription above the reliefs would still
preserve for us their subject even if the latter had disappeared. It
runs as follows:'In the month Pakhon, at the festival of the god
Kheln, at the appearance of the light of the Moon-god. The king,
crowned with his helmet, comes in his litter. The body-guard goes
before him. Each bears at his side shield, spear, and sword. The
lords of his retinue, the higher and lower officers, come behind him,
and after them the princes and warriors. The chief orator of festi-
vals (kherheb) eondln-ts the festival of his father Khem, while the
king presents to his father Khem great offerings of bread, beer,
cattle, geese, and all good things. Khem, the lord of Sen, is brought.

goddess Ma. The kherheh strikes up a dance, the choir-master
(chief singer) does his duty, and the Arabian negro praise the
god. Then also appear before the god his vowed servants, with por-
traits of the kings of Upper and Lower Egypt, as the divine an-
cestors. No more follows, foy the god places himself down upon his
staircase, and Hishiajesty offers a great sacrifice to his father Khem,
the oonsort0m1l) of his mother. Behold, there also is the white
bull before His Majesty, ete.'... In presence of the living king and
of the royal ancestral images an attendant brings the black blade of
a sickle inlaid with gold, and a sheaf of corn, and presents them to
the king. Then the reaper (niamit), walking round the king seven
times, says'The king has reaped with the sickle that is in his
hand, he raises it to his nose, he lays it down before Khem, who
gives the king the harvest'. The king quits the staircase, turns to
the N., and walks round the staircase, etc. - We shall now see how
this description is illustrated by the reliefs.

**hocession at the beautiful Festival of the Staircase. This
very interesting series begins to the left (W.), on the rear-wall of
the N. colonnade. First appears the Pharoah, on a throne-shaped
litter adorned with figures of lions, borne by 12 grandees, of' whom
four are princes of the blood, Attendants wave fans; and three
smaller figures with feather-fans are supposed to be marching by
the side of the litter. Behind the Pharoah are the two goddesses of
rewarding and punishing justice, w'ith out-spread wings, and with
