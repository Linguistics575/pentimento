348 Route 35. FAltftFuAH. The Western

the E. of Widi Nalriin (comp. the Map at the beginning of Vol. I.) are
four Coptic Monasteries, a visit, to which is interesting. The monasteries
owe their origin to Macarms of Alexandria (d. 301), a hermit who first
retired to the Thehan desert in 335, and afterwards, about 373, took up
his abode in a lonely cell in this spot. He was the founder of an order
that won numerous disciples. The monks fast all the year round, except
on Sundays and between Easter and Whitsuntide. Ru.finus mentions fifty
monasteries of asceties, who numbered 5000 in all. In the year 800 the
ruined monastery of St. Macarius was repaired and fortified by J9vtutius,
patriarch of Alexandria. The next most interesting monastery is that of
Syridni, built by a saint named Homzes nr Johannes the dwarf. It has
30-40 monks and 3 churches. Curzon and afterwards Tattam and Pacho,
who visited the monastery twice, here found most valuable collections
of Syrian MSS., acquired between 1810 and 1850. These 1188., in 371
vols., of which the oldest are one. by Ensrbius "Edessa (111 AM.) and
twelve of the 6th cent, included the Theophany and other writings of
Eusehius of Caesarea, the Recognition" of Clemens, a treatise against the
Nanicheeans by Titus of Basra, etc. This monastery contains also an
Abyssinian college with a library.-There is little chance of discovering
any more valuable MSS. here, as all except those required for the religious
services have been transferred to the library of the Coptic patriarch
at Cairo.

A visit to the remaining monasteries, of Baramus (Coptic liturgical
MRS) and Ambn Biskhai, with three small churches, scarcely repays the
trouble. and is not recommended on account of the vermin. - Interest-
ing accounts of these and other monasteries in the Levant are enn-
tained in R. Curzon's Visits to the Monasteries in the Levant (London,
1849), and in Quatremitre's Ndmoires Ge'ographiques, Vol. l, pp. 451 seq.
(Paris, 1811).

II. The Cases of Bahriyeh and 1? arMrah.

The visit to the oasis of Bahriyeh (the. Northern Oasis), called by
Strabn 65.315901,'the Second", and by Ptolemy Jaotcptxpt'r,'the Small Oasis',
is of interest only to the naturalist, for its antiquities are few and 1111-
important. The. latter include a small Roman triumphal arch (Cailliaud,
Meroii, II. Pl. 39, lo, d?.) and a stele of the reign of Tutmes Ill., besides
the scanty remains of a temple at Batrili (Ascherson).

The oasis of Farefrah, probably the To abe or

Cow-lrmd of antiquity (temple of Edful, as the latter is described as to the
N.W. of Kenem, the great oasis, is of importance merely as an inter-
mediate station between the oases of Siwah and Diikhel, or the oases of
Bahriyeh and Dékhel. n contains no antiquities, but some catacombs
in a cliff to the W. suggest that there was at One time a Christian
settlement here. The oasis which has only 3'20 inhah., has been since
1860 entirely in the hands of the fi'eadsi, a rigid Mohammedan sect, founded
by Mohammad Sendai of Algiers (Vol. L, p. 67). The people are suspicious
of and hostile to strangers. The chief village is 8araldlb, two days' journey
to the W. of Siwah.
