Khnurnhotep appears in a litter, inspecting his potters and carpen-
ters. Some of the latter are felling palm-trees and others are build-
ing a boat for the journey to Abydos (see below). The most inter-
esting of the scenes of artizan life in the lower rows are the
representations of women baking and weaving, under the supervision
of eunuehs. -. The entire Rear Wall is occupied by a tastefully
arranged representation of the water-sports in which the deceased
took delight. A forest of papyrus reeds grows by the water-side,
thickly peopled by all kinds of furred and feathered game. To the
right and left Rhnurnl10tep is depicted in his boat, accompanied in
one instance by his wife Khuti, Who is painted a lighter colour.
Here he transfixes large river-fish, there he holds the birds he has
brought down by his darts. Above are birds caught in a net. In the
river swim characteristically drawn fish, and crocodiles and hippo-
potanli are also seen. A man who has fallen into the water is being
hauled out again. The dominant idea of the chase is farther carried
out in the representations of a hawk seizing a gaily-plumaged bird
and an ibis capturing a hr1tterfly.

The N. Wall (to the left on entering) is the most important of
all, as upon it is the celebrated picture of a Semitic race bringing
cosmetics (mestem) and other presents to Khnnmhotep. In the
lowest row, to the right, are seen the secretaries of Khnumhotep,
receiving the report of the steward of the eattle, who is followed by
the herds and shepherds. Just above this is Khnumhotep himself,
represented on a scale three times as large as the other figures and
accompanied by three dogs and a man with sandals, bearing a staff.
In the 4th row from below, on a level with the head and shoulders
of this huge figure, is represented a curious procession. Neferhotep,
the secretary, and another Egyptian lead towards the governor a
number of foreign people in gay-coloured garments, whose sharply
cut features, hooked noses. and pointed beards unmistakeably pro-
claim their Semitic nationality. This Asiatic visit seems to have
been one of the signal events in the life of the nomarch. Neferhotep
hands his master a document from Which we learn that the strangers
knocked at the door of Egypt in the 9th year of king Usertesen II.
Prince Absha, the leader of the foreigners, leads a gazelle and bows
to the ground. The next Asiatic leads an antelope. Four armed men
march in front of the harem, which consists of four women and three
children. Two of these ride upon an ass, Which also bears imple-
ments for weaving. The women wear brightly coloured raiment of
a curious cut. The clothes and loin-cloths of the men are also
brilliantly coloured. A heavily-laden ass is followed by a lute-
player and a warrior armed with club, bow, and quiver. The in-.
scription, beginning'above the figure of the secretary Neferhotep.
