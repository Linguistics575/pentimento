Right Obelisk has been overthrown, andthe fragments of its shattered
shaft are seen lying scattered around. The top has fallen S0111fy
distance to the N. The *Left Obelisk, (P1. h), still standing, is the
largest obelisk in Egypt. The total height was estimated by the
engineers of Napoleois expedition at 971/2 ft., its diameter at the
base'iw, ft., its mass 4873 cubic ft., and its weight 3673 t0ns.+ It
is made of tine red granite, and the inscriptions upon it are among
the finest specimens of the grand style, which flourished at the date
of its erection. Queen Hatasu Klsnurut-Amen, who was regent for
her brother Tutmes III. during his minority, and who erected this
monument, was a true child of the Egyptian'age of chivalry' which
did not close until the reign ofAmenhotep 1V., the sun-worshipper.
Her name will frequently be met with again, especially in her
terrace-temple at Dtr el-bahl-i (p. 223). She was the half-tister
of two kings (Tutmes 11. and Tutmes IH.), and was named
queen by her father Tutmes 1., probably because her mother was
of purer royal blood than the mother of her half-brothers. After
her father's death she reigned in her own name along with Tut-
mes H., whom she married, and on her husband's decease she ruled
on behalf of Tutmes IH., who appears. also to have been her SOIL-
in-law. Masulline in disposition, she carried on important wars
and reared large buildings. The less energetic Tutmes If. yielded
to the guardianship of his sister and wife, but Tutmes m. appears
to have early compelled her to relinquish to him the crown of Lower
Egypt. After her death he caused her name to be chiselled out in
some places and to be replaced by his own in others -. an instance
of the irreverent disfigurement of monuments only too common
in ancient Egypt. Hatasu khnumt-Amen, the royal Amazon,
caused herself to be represented with the ornaments of the male
Pharaohs, and even with a beard. The beautifully carted central
inscription, formerly inlaid with electrum or silver-gilt, contains
her name alone; though she permitted her brother's name to appear
at the sides. Later usurpers have not entirely spared even this noble
monument. The side-inscriptions contain short sentences with the
formulae usually employed for the presentation of gifts and the
bestowing of the blessings of life, while the ventral-inscriptions
refer to the dedication of the ohelisks. One of the inscriptions is as
follows:'The mistress of the diurlems, whose years do not wither
(literally'are green or fresh'), the victory-bringing Hows, etc., IIa-.
tasu, erected this as' a monument to her father Ammon, the lord of
the thrones of both lands, while she reared two obelisks to him in
front of the pylon of Ammon Arsaphes, adorned with statues, and
inlaid it with a profusion ot eleetrum (silver-gilt), in order that it
might shine over both lands like the sun's disc. Never since the
