side the figure of a king) is noteworthy from the fact that it assigns

another prteuomer1 to Darius, viz. Settura C), which closely
a

resembles one of the names of Ramses II. Q. Lepsius

proposes to recognize in this the name, not of the builder of the inner
chambers, but of Darius I. (521-486 B.C.); but as this king is expressly
styled the'beloved of Ammon Ra, lord of Hib, strong with the sword',
he is doubtless to be identified with Darius II. who is mentioned within
the temple. Beneath, Darius, accompanied by Hathor with a sistrum and
year-rings, offers to Ammon Ra, lord of the thrones of both the lands of
Apt-asa (Thebes). Ch, the outside of the N. wall of the temple is another

cartouche of Darius (h Amman Rameri. Whether this be-

longs to another Darius than that named in the other cartouches, perhaps
Darius I., or whether this belongs to Darius ll. and the name Settura to
Darius 1., must remain undecided.

H.Brugsch has proved from an inscription found at Luxor (Stele
Maunier), of the 25th year of Human 1. (1033 B.C.), that the oasis was
used from an early period as a place of banishment. In Christian times
the schismatic Nestorius (435 A30.) was banished hither (p. 50). Christian
monks settled here, protecting themselves against the attacks of the Be-
duins from a place of refuge on the top of the temple, traces of which
were seen by Hoskins.

At A'adumh, a little to the S.E. of theEgreat temple, are the ruins of
a temple of the Roman period, 9 paces long by 12 broad. It has three
doors, above the central and more carefully built of which is the winged
sun-disc. Within the little building is lfound the name of the emperor
Antoninus, which also Occurs at /rrg.sr? ez-zaydn (see below). He is here said
to conduct to the god the land of Kuu or Huu with its possessions and
the W. land with its wines. 011 the outside are a few Coptic names.

Fully an hour to the N. of the town of Ehiirgeh, 1/4 hr. from the
great temple, lies the extensive Christian s1'eeropolis, resembling a city
with its regularly laid out streets, but now utterly devastated. At the
most only a few mortuary chapels are worth visiting. Some of the smaller
of these may have been the mausolea of particular families, but the larger
were probably sepulchral chapels in which religious services were held
in memory of the dead. About 1/4 hr. to the Nnv. of the necropolis is
Kasr Musgaftih Dash, an ancient Christian monastery, built entirely of brick
except the main portal, which is of hewn stone. To the N. of it is a
Hypogeum, 36 ft. long by 16 ft. broad, with three chambers on each side.

About 2hrs. to the S. of Jrhilrgeh is the little village of Genndh, with
250 inhabitants. The houses are covered with branches of the orange-tree
and pomegranate-tree in place of roofs. The streets are so narrow as to
make it dirlieult for a laden camel to pass through them. About 13/4 hr.
from the village are the ruins of a temple, dating from the time of the
Ptolemies (Euergetes, Philopator, and Lathyrus), and dedicated to the
Theban triad, Ammon-Ra, Muth, and Khunsu. The ruins, prettily situated
on a hill, are now known as Kasr Gaitah or J_fasr Wali (drawings of it,
see Hoskins, plates xvn-XIX, and Cailliaud, pl, XIV). About ly, hr. far-
ther is the picturesque ruin of ffa.sr'Ain ez-Zuydu, a temple, enclosed by
a rough brick wall, 230 ft. long'and 83 ft. broad. The entrance is on the
S. side. Within the wall is a kind of court, of unhurnt bricks, 50 ft.
long and 17 ft. broad, at the approach to which are fragments of stone
with part of a Greek inscription. In this court is situated the temple,
13 ft. from the girdle-wall, and entered through a pylon, "ft. broad, with
the winged sun-disc, facing the S. The doorway, which is 4V2 ft. wide,
is adorned with representations of the emperor Antoninus making offerings
