tailed. The triumphant king does not forget his father Amman, in whose
temple he causes the record of his victory to he inscribed.

Though Tutmes III. erected Pylon VIII, Merenptah after-
wards appropriated it to himself. On the side to the left of the be-
holder the S. tribes, and on the right side, the N. tribes are de-
picted as captives, with their name-rings.

The lists seem to have been edited three times. At first there were on the
left only 47 names, written from left to right, and on the right 52 names,
written from right to left. Subsequently three rows, written in the Oppo-
site direction were added to the three lowest rows - on the left the
name-rings d -70, 71-94, 95-117, and en the right the name-rings 53-74,
75-97, 98-119 - so that 117 S. tribes and Â£19 N. tribes were recorded,
corresponding with the two other long lists of tribes by Tutmes III. on
Pylon VI, in the great temple of Ammon, and on the S. side of Pylon VII.
At a still later date (possibly not till Merenpteh's reign) 152 name-rings
were added at the ends an the left (S. tribes) and 240 name-rings on the
ends on the right (N. tribes).

On the right (N.) end of the N. wing of Pylon VIII is a short
inscription of the 21st Dyn., relating to the restoration of the rights
of a Princess Ramaka. The other ts.) side of the pylon consists of
two portions, some distance apart, representing Tutmes III. seiz-
ing prisoners in presence of Ammon. On the left (W. side) are the
N. tribes, described as the great ones of the Itetennu, of all the
remote (seta) lands, of the Fenekhu (Phenicians). On the right
(E) side are the peoples, of the S. Before the centre of the pylon
are remains of statues of Tutmes III.

The next court is much smaller than the courts between the
pylons farther to the S. The weil-preserved Second Pylon (P1. IN)
is interesting as the most ancient part of the entire building. It
was founded by Tutmes L, and its gateway was provided with
inscriptions by his sons, Tutmes II. and Tutmes III. Tut-
mes I. is seen on the N. side (left) worshipping the triad of
Thebes; and beside this representation is an interesting poetic in-
scription (damaged) extolling the might and the victories of this
prince. Above is the boat of Ammon Ra borne by priests, in front
of which is Tutmes II. receiving the symbol of life from the lion-
headed Uarthekau (the great sorceress), behind whom is the goddess
Hathor ofDenderah, pouring water from a vessel. To the left of this
King Seti I. appears twice before Ammon Ra, who is followed by
fifteen deities in three rows of tive. 0n the right side of the pylon,
towards the top, is a similar boat, beneath which are representations
of Ramses III. Hak an. On the S. side of the pylon, to the right,
is Amenhotep IL, smiting a band of enemies. As this king was
unable to complete the inscriptions on the left side, Seti I. took
advantage of the vacant space to commemorate his name. Four
Colossi originally stood before this pylon. Those to the right have
disappeared, but those still extant to the left. are highly interesting.
The huge yellowish torso immediately to the left of the door has
the name of Tutmes II. on the girdle; and in an inscription on
its back Tutmes III. announces that he erected the statue in the
