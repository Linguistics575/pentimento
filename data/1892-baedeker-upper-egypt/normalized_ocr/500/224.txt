156 Route 12. THEBES. West Bank:

and soldiers, heard the sound about the first hour; but I was unable
to decide whether it proceeded from the base or from the statue, or
indeed whether it was deliberately produced by one of those stand-
ing round the pedestal. For as I do not know the cause, anything
appears to me much more credible than that the sound issued from
the stone thus placed'. Doubts as to the genuineness of the phe-
nomenon ceased soon after Strabo's time, and while that famous
geographer mentions only an inarticulate souni (tfqoc), Pausanias
speaks of a musical note and Juvenal refers to the'resonance from
the magic strings of the shattered Memnon'. By later observers the
sound is compared to that of a stroke upon metal, or even of a trum-
pet-blast and of human voices singing. The sound was heard only at
or soon after sunrise, though by no means invariably then; and some
of the most distinguished visitors were disappointed of hearing it.
Among these was Septimius Severus, who caused the restoration of
the upper portions, perhaps with a view to propitiate the angry god.
Thereafter the phenomenon ceased, and the colossus, abhorred by
the Christians as a pagan idol, fell rapidly into oblivion as the new
religion spread.

Letronne has proved that the resonance of the stone is on no account
to be explained as a mere priestly trick, and in the opinion of eminent
physicists, it is perfectly possible that a hard resonant stone, heated by
the warm sunlight suddenly following upon the cold nights in Egypt,
might emit a sound in the early morning. A similar phenomenon has
been observed elsewhere, as by Professor Ebers under the perphyry
cliffs of the Sinai mountains, and by the savauts of the French Expe-
dition near the granite-sanctuary at Karnak and in the granite quarries
of Assuan (Syene). An English traveller near the Maladetta in the Pyre-
nees heard a sound issuing from the rocks, not unlike the note ot an
Aeolian harp, and the name given to it by the natives,'the matins of the
damned', seems to prove that it was of frequent if not regular occur-
rence. The'music-stones" "the Orinoco are well-known. In the Gova
valley, to the S. of Lake Nyassa, Livingstone observed the thunderous
sound of splitting stones, ascribed by the natives to the agency of Mehesi
or evil spirits. And the German consul, Dr. Wetzstein, reports similar
phenomena in the volcanic region discovered by him to the E. of Da-
mascus. Possibly the extensive broken and sloping surface of the colos-
sus, wet with the dews of early morning, was exposed unusually directly
to the rays of the rising sun, and the famous sound may have been pro-
duced by a current of air, generated by this sudden change of temperature,
passing over the rough and pebbly surface. In that case the phenomenon
would naturally cease when the upper part of the figure was replaced.

The numerous Greek and Latin inscriptions, in prose and verse, in..
scribed upon the legs of the figure by travellers under the Roman empire,
are peculiarly interesting. These are more numerous on the left than on
the right leg, and none are beyond the reach of a man standing at the
foot of the statue. The earliest were carved in the reign of Nero, the
latest in those of Septimius Severus and Caracalla, and the most numer-
ous (27) in that of Hadrian. Unty one Egyptian (who is responsible for
a short demotic inscription) is fouud among these seribblers, who show
both more reverence for antiquity and more wit than their modern represen-
tatives. At the same time it must be acknowledged that the writings on the
e0lossus of Memuon are not without seientilie value. They were for the
most part the work ofmen ot'seme eminence, includingS governors ofEgypt,
3 epistrateges of the Thebaid, 2 proeurators, etc. Many, though not all, are
dated. Nearly all of them afford proof that only the N. colossus emitted the
