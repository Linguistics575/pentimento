The SMALL TEMPLE below, farther to the S.W. in the valley, is
in good preservation, but it is only 16 ft. high and 27 ft. deep. The
Arabs call it el-f.Ltrnnttfrn, Le. the Bath.

As the walls are about 3 ft. thick the Interior is very small. On the
left aud hack walls is a small window, at some height from the ground.
Thoth, llehent, and Horus, the gods here worshipped, are represented as
forming a triad. In the doorway is the Pharaoh offering saeriOe, below;
and a cynocephalus with the moon-sickle .and disc on his head, above.
It was to be expected that the sacred animals that symbolize the qualities
of Theth should be found represented here along with the moon-goddess
Hebent.

*ItocE-TosrBs, A donkey is not necessary for a visit to these.
They are reached in about I/thr. from the usual landing-place 6f
the Nile boats; and the last few minutes' climb up the hill-slope
on which the tombs lie, must be accomplished on foot. The
Shafts, found both outside and inside the tombs, require caution.

These Temps, hewn side by side in the rock, are, like all the menu-
ments at el-Kab, of small dimensions, but their distinct pictures of an-
cient Egyptian domestic life will interest even those travellers who have
already seen the tombs of Benihasan and'Abd cl-Furnah. One of the
Inscriptions (in the tomb of the ship-captain Aahmes, see p. 241) is of the
greatest seientitie importance, partly on account of the contemporary
narrative of the expulsion of the Hyksos which it contains, partly on
account of the simple and intelligible style in which it is expressed. It
has been critically translated and analysed (by E. de Rouge) as the Jirst
of all the larger inscriptions. - Most of the tombs were constructed be-
fore, during, or shortly after the rule of the Hyksos, for male and female
members of noble families, who discharged the peaceful duties of chief
priests of Hebent OI' of tutors and nurses to the royal princes. There
tire 31 tombs in all, but only 13 have inscriptions and only 6 repay a visit.

We first enter the third inscribed tomb, counting from the E.,
which is conspicuous by its wide opening. This belonged to the

Aahmes, son of Alma, whose tomb lies farther to the left CIC). It is
distinguished by a series of representations from the life and burial
of the deceased. on both sides of the tomb.

To the left (W.) of the entrance appears the deceased with his staff
of office in his right hand and a long stick in his left; behind him stand
three servants. The accompanying inscription is:'The inspection of the
labours of all seasons of the year, which take place in the 1'ields, by the
overseer of Hehent (el-Kiib) hy the manager annit (Esneh)'. - The La-
bours of' the Field are next represented in three registers, beginning from
beneath. In the lowest raw: a cart drawn by two horses, showing that
horses were used by the Ep.vptiaus as early as the beginning of the 18th
Dyn.; tilting the ground with hoo and plough, ploughing and sowing. -
Middle row: Reaping, the grain being cut not close to the ground but
one-third or one-half way up the stalk; vessels with refreshments for
the workers are represented, and kept cool by a Screen; binding the,
sheaves; reaping or pressing the fruits of the earth. - Top row: Ears of
corn carried away in baskets; threshing by means of oxen; piling up the
fruits of the earth; packing them in sacks or storing them in granaries.
Above the oxen treading out the corn is the following song, iusrwibed
also in the tombs of Benihasan (p. 12) and Saly.it'isu1: -
