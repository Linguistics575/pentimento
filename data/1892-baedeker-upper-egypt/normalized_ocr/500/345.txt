of some rebellious S. tribes in the land of Kush and the district
of Kenes. Some inscriptions of a certain Senmut before Hatasu
and her daughter Itaneferu record the quarrying and despatch of
two large obelisks; another is from the 9th year of Seti 1.; others
are by a Mes [ Moses ] under Meienptah L; and another is by a certain
Seti, a loyal son of Kush and president of the gold-land of Siptah,
and his minister Bai.

In 1885-66 some important Tomhs of the 6th and 19th Dyn.
were opened on the hills ('Mount Grenfelt') lying to the W. 0ppo-
site Assuan, first by Mustafah Shakir, British consular agent at As-
suin, and then by Major-general Sir F. Grenfell. They lie about
1/4 hr. to the N. of the W. convent (BET el-phat-tttyeh). We cross
the river in the small boat and land at a ruined stone quay, whence
an ancient staircase, hewn in the rock, ascends for about 150 ft.,
flanked on either side by a wall of more recent date. The stairs
are in three flights, from the top of each of which inclined planes
lead towards the tombs, evidently intended for the transport of the
sarcophagi. At the summit of the staircase is a platform with
tombs of the 6th and 19th Dynastiesd Tomb No. 96, with a curious
door placed one-third up the height of another door, belongs to a

court-official named Saben, who flourished under Ne-
tttttts
ferkara Pepi 11. (6th Dyn.) and was employed on the pyramid of

that king Men-ankh (see Plan, Vol. 1., p. 378).

the first pillar on the right, is the standing figure of Saben, with
red complexion and black hair. 011 the back-wall the deceased
