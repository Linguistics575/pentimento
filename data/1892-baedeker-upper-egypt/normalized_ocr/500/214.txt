across the entire breadth of the temple and having its roof supported
by eight columns in two rows with calyx-capitals. This was at least
adorned, if not built, by Ramses PHIL; while the door hears the
cartouche of Nekhnebfl. The calyX-capitals are comparatively low,
and their edges are bent out to a remarkable extent. Beyond this
hall are the rooms of the Sanctuary. Here, especially in the rooms
to the E., are a series of deeply carved inscriptions, some of which
are of great scientific, importance though of little general interest.
Ramses IV. (Hak m5) and Ramses X111. occur here, and several
Ptolemaic princes have carved their names. Various Greeks, of
late date, have also left their names in longer or short inscriptions,
placed beside representations otyoot-prints (indicating that they
had visited the spot as pilgrims), a habit illustrated also at Philae
and elsewhere (6.9. Lesbos). Isis and Khunsu (besides Thoth)

Ra,'lord of the throne of both worlds in E. Thebes, ruler of
heaven, and king of all gods'. Of the o1edieation-ins0riptions,

'The living good god (ie. the Pharaoh) raised this building in the
house of his father Khunsu, the lord ofThebes, and built this temple
of good limestone and sandstone in workmanship for longduration'.

Tr, The Small Temple of Apet.

The Temple of Apet (Pl. W), once occupied by Champollion as
a dwelling, lies close to the W. wall of the temple of lihunsu. It
is now used as a depository for the smaller monuments found at
Karnak, the best of Which are periodically transferred to the Egyp-
tian museum at Gizeh. Diab Timsuh, who lives opposite (a boy
will summon him), opens the temple on request. Among less in-
teresting objects a beautifully executed torso of Tutmes III. is
