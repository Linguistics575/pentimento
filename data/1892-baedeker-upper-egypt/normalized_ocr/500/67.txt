the son of the Lady Hannu, who was one of the chief dignitaries
of the kingdom, bore the title of an erpa ha or prince, governed
the nome of Mall in time of peace, and commanded a division of
the army in war. To the left and right of the entrance he is depict-
ed on a throne with lions" feet, holding his commander" baton in
his hand. Inside the door are two well-preserved inscriptions,
cut in the stone. That to the right (so informs us that Amenemha
departed this life in the 43rd year of Usertesen L, corresponding
to the 25th year of the governorship of Ameni. He undertook all
his wars'sailing up-stream' :--) he campaigned only against
the dwellers of the S., the'miserable Kushites', as they are called
in the inscription. In those days the arms of the Pharaohs had not
yet been carried towards the E. The Sinai peninsula, with its
mines, is the only district in this direction which excited the Egyp-
tion lust of conquest. From his southern campaigns Amenemha
brought home much gold and other booty. The inscription to the
left (NJ also mentions a victorious campaign towards the S., but
is of special interest for the light it throws on the truly human
feelings of this bye-gone time. Amenemha describes his oeoupa-
tions in time of peace as follows (beginning at the fourth line from
below ]):'I cultivated the entire nome of Mali with many work-
people. 1 troubled no child and oppressed no widow, neither did
I keep a fisherman from his fishing or a herdsman from his herd.
There was no head of a village whose people I had taken away for
compulsory labour, and there was no one unhappy in my days or
hungry in my times. When, however, a famine arose, I tilled all
the fields in the name of Malt, from its S. to its N. boundary, and
gave nourishment and life to its inhabitants. So there was no one
in the Dome who died of hunger. To the widow I allowed as much
as to the wife of a man, and in all that I did I never preferred the
great man to the small one. When the Nile rose again and every-
thing flourished - fields, trees, and all else - 1 cut off nothing
from the fields'.

The paintings in the interior of the tomb-ehamher proper are
unfortunately very much faded, and they have also been con-
siderably injured, especially in recent years. Some figures of war-.
riors which still remain, armed with club and axe or club and lance,
have a foreign appearance, as their skin is of a lighter colour than
that of the Egyptians, and their hair and beards are red.

Tomb No. Lo is that of Khnumhotep, the son of Nehera. It owes
its origin to a member of a family of high rank, in which the office
of governor of Malt seems to have been hereditary for several ge-
nerations. Amenemha I., Usertesen I., and Amenemha If., the first
kings of the 12th Dyn., showered titles and dignities with a free
hand on this family, which in return clung to the royal line with
peculiar loyalty and affection. By a wonderful piece of good fortune
we are able to reproduce the entire family-tree of this family, in
