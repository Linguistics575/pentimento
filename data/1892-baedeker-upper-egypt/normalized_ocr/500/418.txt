In Englis t When King Psammetichus came to Elephantine, the com-
panions of Psammetichus, son of Theokles, wrote this. They came by
ship viii Kerkis (p. 316) to where the river rises, the differently speaking
Dechepotasimto (Le. a foreigner, perhaps a Carian) and Amasis speaking
Egyptian. Demerarchon, son of Amoibichos, and Pelekos, 5011 of Uda-
mos, wrote.

The leader of this company is here named Psammetikh; in a Phoen-
ician inscription on the same spot One of the mercenaries is spoken of
as a servant of Her, the general. The writers of the other Greek inscrip-
tions were partly Ionians from Tees and Kolophon, partly Dorians from
Rhodes, a Sidouian, and a Carian.

Providing ourselves with candles, or still better with a mag-
nesium lamp, we 110w enter the roek-temple, the interior of which,
with its still vividly coloured pictorial decorations, is no less re-
markable than the exterior. The walls of the first hall (P1. F),
which is 58 ft. long by 54 ft. broad, are covered all round with re-
presentations, which were first chiselled in the stone, then covered
with a thin coating of stucco and painted. The ceiling is supported
by eight square pillars, against which stand C) siris-tigures of the
king, with the scourge and the crook in his crossed hands. The
ceiling itself is adorned with vultures and the names of the king.
Above the entrance is the remarkably simple dedication-inscription,
on the right to Harmachis, lord of the land of Khent, on the left to
Ammon-lla, king of the gods. The pictorial scenes in this hall are
symmetrically arranged, so that those referring to events in the N.
of Egypt are placed 011 the N. (right) side, those to events in the
s., on the S. (left) side. A similar arrangement was adopted in the
exterior hall of the temple of Bet el-Walli (p. 310).

On each side of the entrance-wall within are representations,
such as are commonly found on the pylons of more recent temples;
as e.g. at Edfu and Philae. The king aims a blow with his club at
a number of foes, whom he holds by the hair, while they raise their
hands in supplication. On the left are represented N. tribes, 011
the right S. tribes, easily distinguished by their facial eharacter-
istics. Harmachis stands before the king on the left, and Ammon,
handing him the sword of victory, on the right. Hovering above
the king is a protecting vulture. On a standard behind him is the
name Ka nekht meri ma,'the strong bull, beloved of the goddess
Ma'. In his right hand is an ostrich feather, in his left a head with
the Suten Ea, the person of the king, with the legend'the living
royal Ka, lord of both lands in the grave, in the house of the deep'.
Beneath are the children of the king; to the right his sons, to the
left his daughters, with sistra.

We now turn to the S. wall, on the left. At the top are five re-
ligious pictures: sacrificial scenes before Ammon, Harmachis, the
king in the tree of life kneeling upon the symbol of the festival,
