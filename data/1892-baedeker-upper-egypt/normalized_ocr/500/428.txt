Two main routes lead to the oasis of Siwah. One, beginning at Alex-
andria, leads to the w. along the Mediterranean coast viii the'A.kabet
es-é'oghe'r (Katittparhmus Parvus) to Medjed near 2larardn (the ancient Pa-
rtetonium), in 80-90 hr.'s. travel spread over 10-11 days, and there turning
to the S. reaches Siwah in 5 da'ys Or 62 hrs. more. This was Alexander
the Great's route, and was also taken hy Browne (see above) in 1792. Or
the traveller may follow the Mediterranean coast for It days more to the
'Atabet el-liebir (Katahathmus Major) near Bit' el-Kor, and there turning s.,
reach Siwah in 5 days or 61 hrs. more. Thie was alfirtutolt" s route in 1820.
The second main route, starting from Terdneh or from Cairo, leads vit
the Natron ("onvents to Hiwah, in about 13 days (Hornemann 1798), while
the first route takes 1530 days. One route is usually taken for the
journey out, the other for the return. Fr. Cailliattd reached Siwah in 1819
from the Faytm in 16 days, vii Raymz, el-Peveis, and el-Earah, but the
hostile natives permitted him to pay but one visit to the monuments. In
the following year (1820) Mol1amrded rAli despatched a military force with
artillery, which reduced the hitherto independent Siwah under the autho-
rity of the Pasha of Egypt. 2) rooettiand Ricci accompanied this expedition.
Gerhard Rohlfs has twice visited the oasrv, in 18 9 on his journey from
Tripoli to Alexandria; and in Feb. ISN in the course of an expedition
undertaken aIOug with Jordan, Zitrel, and Ascherson, at the expense of Is-
mafil Pasha, This expedition starting from Asxifit proceeded viii Fardfrah
and DMchel, then struck IV. to 27°40, where they turned to the IC, reach-
ing Siwah in ld days. The return was made vift Fariifrah, Diikhel, and
el-8hdryeh to the Nile. Unfortunately this costly expedition had not se-
cured the services of an Egyptologist, and even their photographer Re-
meté was left behind at Dzikhel. so that it hm contributed little or nothing
to our knowledge of the inscriptions at Siwah. We have on the other hand
very full information concerning the temples at el-Klu" trgeh from Cailliaud,
Row. Hay, and H. Brugsr-h (1815), to which also the photographs taken by
M. Remelé at Dikhel and Rhiirgeh have largely added The inhabitants
of the oasis of Siwah speak a peculiar dialect, of which Minutoli has
communicated doo words. Herodotus (II, 4?) mentions that the Ammo-
nites are colonist < from Egypt and Ethiopia and speak a dialect midway
between the languages of thee lands. They understand a little Arabic,
but their own speech is a dialect of Tamasirht, a Berber tongue, under-
stood in the Atlas and elsewhere in N. Africa.

The deity worshipped in the temple of the oasis was a team's-headed
and ram's-horued Amman, such as appears On some Thehan monuments
(e.g. the N. wall of Medinet Hahn), and also on coins of the Ptolemies.
He was supposed to have been identified with Bor-shot, who was wor-
