for myself'.

The tomb of Renni, still farther to the left [ W.), contains
numerous representations of interest. The deceased, a son of a lady
named Aahmes and father of another Aahmes, was a prince (erpa
ha) and a large lauded proprietor. Two obelisks seem to have stood
at the entrance to this vault; and the statue of the deceased is to
be seen in its recess.

The roof of the chapel is vaulted, and covered like the walls with a
thin coat of stucco. On which the representations and inscriptions were
painted. On the right wall are the funeral of Renui and other scenes
connected with his death, while on the left wall are scenes from the life
of the deceased, who accompanied by his dog, surveys his possessions.
Here appear his carriage, his serfs husied in tilling the ground, and his
family in friendly union. Beside each of the persons waited on by the
servants of the deceased appears his name and his relationship to the
head of the family. Among, the livestock helouging to Renni 1500 swine
are mentioned, a circumstance which appears somewhat surprising at
first, for the flesh of swine was an article of diet as strictly forbidden
to the Egyptians as to the Jews. Renni, however, was a prophet of
Hebeut, and had to provide swine to he sacrisced to this goddess, which
accounts for his possession of the otherwise ahhorred animals. This re-
markable circumstance did not escape the notice of Herodotus, who
writes:'They saeritiee swine to no gods except Selene (goddess of the
moon, i.e. Hebent) and Dionysus; making this sacrifice to the moon al-
ways at full moon, at which time they also eat swine's flesh, The Egyp-
tians assign a particular reason for ahhorring swine at other festivals
and offering them at this one, butfalthOugh I know it I am not permitted
to reveal it'. Herodotus was bound by an oath not to reveal the mystery,
from which, however, we may he able to lift the veil by a study of the
monuments, lt is related that Typhnn (Seth), while hunting by moonlight,
fell in with the coffin of () siris, and hewed the Corpse into M parts, Le.
the 14 n'ghts of the waxing aud waning moon. This orh is called the
left eye of Horus, and, as the inscriptions explain, it was in jeopardy
on the 15th night, Ce. the time of the full moon. It had been observed
that eclipses of the moon affected the light only of the full moon, and
thus arose the myth that Seth Typhon, in the form of a swine, attacks
the orb of night at the full moon and endeavours to swallow it. The
desire of injuring the enemy of the moon and of assisting the latter in
her contest against the animal that seeks to devour her, linds symbolical
expression in the slaughter of swine at the time of the new moan. Many
other Egyptian customs are also to he explained by reference to the
contest betwixt Horus and Seth.

The last three tombs farther to the left (w.1 appear to date from
the 13th Dyn., and are therefore much more ancient than those
just described, unless we regard the M-17th Dyn. as ruling in
Upper Egypt contemporaneously with the Hyksos in Lower Egypt.
The first was erected to a lady named Sebeknefm, by her father

Beba, who possibly himself is buried here too. Sebeknefru was
- Q suten am, i.e. belonging to the king's court.

Brugsch has published the contents of a Stale from the rear-wall of
this tomb, in which Beba records the great size of his household, and
also bis distribution of grain during a long-con/ui famine. To recog-
nize in this, however, a reference to the famine that brought Joseph's
brethren to Egypt, is entirely gratuitous. In the last tomb to the left,
