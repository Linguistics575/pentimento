mission-station or at the house of the Italian cure). It contains
about 40,000 inhab., and is a not unpleasi "specimen of an Egyp-
tian town. Between the station and the town we observe a peculiar,
undershot stliiyeh, or water-wheel driven by the water itself. The
very long covered bazaar contains nothing of special interest. The
traveller, even if unprovided with an introduction, should pay a
visit to the mndir, who will protect him from extortion in case of
any slif'tiemlty with the owners of horses and others (comp. p. Pu).
A broad arm of the Bahr Ynsut'Cp. 35j flows through the middle
of the town. The mosque of Kait Bey, on the N. side of the town,
now somewhat dilapidated, is the only interesting building of the
kind. It contains numerous antique columns, brought from the
ancient Arsinoii, some of Which have shafts of polished marble with
Arabic inscriptions, and Corinthian and other capitals. Below the
mosque, on the bank of the Bahr Ytist1f, are some remains of ancient
masonry. No ancient inscriptions have been discovered here, but
the walls of some of the houses contain fragments which must
have belonged to aneient temples. At the W. end of the town the
Bahr Ytssuf radiates into numerous branches, which water the
country in every direction. The dilapidated mosque of tj-lol? situated
here forms a picturesque foreground.

To the N. of the town are the extensive ruins of Croeoi1i1opolis-
Arsinoii, which has been entirely destroyed. The site.is now called
1mm F" tris. Many antiquities, both of the Roman and the Christian
period, have been found here, including numerous small terracotta
lamps and many thousand fragments of papyri, intermixed with
pieces of parchment. Most of the papyri are Greek (pmong them
fragments of Homer, Euripides, Thncydides, also of a Christian
eateehetioal book), many are Arabic, from the 2nd cent. of the He-
gira down to 0.i3 A.D.; and others are in Coptic, Pehlevi, Sassa-
onhle-Persian, and Meroitie-Ethiopian characters. Several fragments
in hieratio and hieroglyphic characters, the oldest from the time of
Ramses HI. (about 1300 H.CJ, have also been discovered. As the
writings are for the most part tax-papers, it has been supposed that
they belonged to a tax offiee of the town of (Jroeodilopolis, where
old papyri also were, used. A large number of the papyri found
here were acquired by Consul Travers for the Berlin Museum, and
even :1 larger number by Theod. Graf and Archduke Rainer for the
Austrian Museum of Art and Industry at Vienna. The very exten-
sive cemetery of the town, with its pieturesque tombstones, covers
part of the site of the ancient city; the highest of the mounds of
rubbish command a survey of the whole of the Fayrim. At the N.
end of the ruins, about 11/4 M. from Medineh, M. Sehweinfnrth
discovered the remains of a large temple with a pylon, in front of
which is a sitting fignrc of Amenemha I., the founder of the 12th
Dyn., and inside several slabs with the name of Ramses the Great.
