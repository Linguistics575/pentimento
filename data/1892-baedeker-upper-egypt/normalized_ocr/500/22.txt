for the accommodation is somewhat limited. Greater care is required
in the choice of companions for the dhahabiyeh-voyage, for the close
and constant intercourse in rather narrow quarters and for per-
haps two months at a time is apt to produce somewhat strained re-
lations between those who are not originally sympathetic. The
'dhahabiyeh devil', indeed, is famous in Egypt for causing those
who have embarked as friends to disembark as foes. In especial tray-.
ellers with seientifie aims should avoid travelling with those who
have no particular interest in the gigantic remains of antiquity, and
who are thus constantly wishing to push on hurriedly from sheer
ennui. In all cases it is prudent to distribute the various cabins
and seats on the divan by lot before starting.

A government tax of 100 pias. (20s. 6d.) is levied upon all visitors to
the monuments of Upper Egypt, to be devoted to the maintenance of such

monuments. The tax may be paid and cards admitting to the temples etc.
obtained at the Museum of Gizeh or at Cook's or Gaze's Office.

A. THE STEAMBOAT VOYAGE.

The steamers belonging to Messrs. Thomas Cook & Son (offlees,
see p. xv) are the best on the Nile, as well in point of comfort and
cleanliness, as in point of organization and attentive service. Cook's
TOURIST STEAMERS between Cairo and Assu√©n start every alternate
Tuesday from the middle of November till the end of December,
and every Tuesday from that date until the middle of March, spend-
ing 20 days on the voyage to Assuan and back. Extra-steamers
are also run at the most crowded time; while two special excursions
are organized in the course of the season, allowing four weeks for
the double voyage. The three-weeks service is carried on by the
steamers Rameses the Great, Rameses, Prince Mohammad Ali,
Teujik, and Prince Abbas, of which the two tirst are the best. The
fare is 501., or for occupants of the two superior cabins, specially
adapted for invalids, M) t. The four-weeks steamer is named Sethi;
fare (mt. The fares include provisions (Wine etc. excepted), all
necessary travelling expenses, donkeys, English saddles for ladies,
boats to cross the river, the services of dragomans and guides, and
bakshish to guides. The donkey-boys, however, usually look for
a small bakshish from the traveller, who is also expected to bestow
a gratuity upon the attendants on board the steamer. The tax
levied by the Egyptian Government [ see above) is also not included
in the fares. Each traveller is entitled to ship 200 lbs. of personal
luggage not exceeding 2 cubic metres in measurement. A physician
is carried on each steamer, whose services, if required, are paid for
in addition to the fare. A deposit of 10t. must be paid on taking
a ticket at Cook's offices in Europe. The name, sex, and nationality
of the passenger must be inserted at the time of booking. Tickets
are not transferable except with Messrs. Cook's consent. Ifa trav-

steamer for which he has booked he may proceed with the following
