his arms in prayer. Above the door are Isis
and Nephthys, worshipping the solar disc

with Khnum and.

To the left, in the First Corridor, appear the
king worshipping Harmachis, and the large so-

in Amenthes' (tii lines). The continuation of this
inscription in the second corridor and on the
right wall of the first corridor is not so well

that Horus is replaced by Tum with a lance in
front of the coiled Apep serpent, while the in-
scription runs:'The deed of Tum for Ra, for
he made the god noble, smiling his enemy'. The
