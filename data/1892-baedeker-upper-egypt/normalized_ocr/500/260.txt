daughter of Ra; she has not her like'. In the Side-chambcr 5 is the
mummy-shaft. In the innermost Chamber tl Osiris sits enthroned as
supreme judge to whom Selk conducts the queen. Behind him are
Nephthys and Thoth. Ch, the walls e and f are tables of offerings on
which, by the side of distributions of bread ete., lie masses ot'f1owers
far larger than are found in the tombs of men. In the Side-chamber d
we see the, Hather cow, richly decorated and standing out of a back-
ground of radiance and flames of tire painted with dazzling colours.
This painting, which meets us several times in the tombs of the
Queens, represents llather as a goddess of heaven and especially of
the horizon. She is the cow which in the lower world gives birth
to the young Sun, who begins his active life with flame and light.

On the right close to the tomb of Tity lies that of Queen Isis,

(a
I! sjir) Ast, wife ofRanrses IV. (Nefer-raro-an) of the

20th Dynasty. The entrance is filled up, and the, inscriptions are
much injured and covered with debris. In tlur, innerromn c'orrespond-
ing to room 3 in the tomb of Titi stands a broken granite b'0IT.0-.
phagus.

On the W. side, running: parallel to that just described, the first
tomb approached from the N. is in ruins; close to it is that of a
queen, whose name, has been obliterated, and in its place another
written with ink, apparently to be read TuauentApt. In this the, first
and third rooms were supported by pillars. The names are on the
inner wall of the second room. The inscriptions were incised. The
two tombs beyond were the rosting-plac, es of another princess, the
favourite daughter of ltumses H., Bani ante, and of Amett-eneri,
i.e. the beloved of Amman, the latter consisting of a principal
hall with a chamber behind and on each side. Contrary to custom
the shaft is on the. left of the entrance in front of the principal hall.

17. Der el-Medineh.

No une should miss seeing the beautiful small Ptolemaic temple of
Dh. eI-Medineh lying to the N.W. nf Medinet Irabu. It lies on the way
try Slu'akh'Abd eI-Ifiurnah either from Medinet Hahn or from the Tombs of
the Queens. From Medinet Hahn we. reach Dér el-Nedineh in 20 minutes.

On the way from the Tombs ot' the Queens to Oeh. el-Medineh,
we pass (1/4111'.) a hillside with some remarkable historical steles of
the 18th,19th, and 20th Dynasties. On one appears King Ramses m.
before Horus, and his father Set-mekht before Ammon. Another
contains an account of the campaigns of the former king.

The graceful Temple ofDér el-Medineh was founded under the
Ptolemies for the, worship of the dead, and dedicated to the goddess
Hather. It lies in a barren hollow, in which several fragments of
buildings are to be seen, and is surrounded by a lofty wall of dried
bricks which are titted together in waving lines. Through this a
