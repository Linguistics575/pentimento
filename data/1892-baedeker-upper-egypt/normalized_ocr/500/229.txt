Ramesseum. THEBJSS. M. Route. 150

astronomiCal representations etc.), others seem to apply much more closely
to the temple at Medinet Hahn, built by Ramses IL who bore the name
Usermara merumon (Osymandyas) as well as Ramses HI. Among these
latter points are the lion-hunt en the N. side of the temple, the treasury,
the severed limbs, and perhaps also the teniple-library (p. 167). Possibly
the explanation is that Itiodorus wrote his description from memory after
leaving Thebes and mingled features of both temples in his account.

The traveller will be assisted to form a judgment on the question
for himself by the following main points from the description by Dioi10-
rus.'At the entrance is a pylon of coloured stone (probably granite is
intended, though erroneously), 2 plethra long (202 ft.) and 45 ells high.
Then follows a square peristyle, with sides measuring 4 plethra (404 ft.).
The roof is supported, not by columns, but by 16 figures nfliving beings,
each carved in an antique style out of a single stone. The entire roof
is 2 nrgyia (111/2 ft.) broad, and is formed of solid stone, decorated with
stars on a blue ground. Beyond the peristyle are another entrance and
a pylon, ditfering, from the lirst only in having various flgures carved
upon it. Beside the entrance are 3 monolithie tigures of the Memnnn of
Syene (or, according to a hetter reading'of stone from Syene0. One of
these, a sitting figure, exceeds in size all other statues in Egypt; at its
foot (footstool) it measures more than 7 ells. The others, to the right
and left respectively of the knees of this statue, represent the sister and
mother, and are smaller than the first. This work is not only noteworthy
for its size, but deserves admiration also for its artistic beauty. It is
also remarkable for the character of the stone, in which neither a crack
nor a flaw is to be seen in spite of its unusual size. - This pylon is
suceeeded by a peristyle court which seems even more worthy of remark
than the preceding. It contains various sculptures carved in the stone,
representing the wars carried on hy him (Le. the king) against the Bae-
trians, who had revolted against him'. Diodorus farther informs us that
the army consisted of 400,000 foot soldiers and 20,000 cavalry, in four
divisions commanded by the kingr's sons. On the first wall the king was
represented storming a fortress surrounded by a river, and hurling himself
against the enemy, along with a fierce lion which accompanied him in
battle... "ln front of the last wall were two monolithic sitting statues,
27 ells in height, and beside these were three exits from the peristyle, admitt-
ing to a hypostyle, which had the form of an odeum (music-room), and was
2 plethra (202 ft.) long on each side". According to Diodorus this building
also possessed a library. The last part of the temple and its upper story
are too completely ruined to be satisfactorily compared with the report
of the Sicilian geographer.

We are able to recognize the first pylon, the caryatides in the second
peristyle court, the largest colossus in Egypt, the battle-sculptures with
the lion and the fortress surrounded by water, the hypostyle odeum, and
traces of the library. Diodorus describes them in tolerably correct order,
but as vaguely as hasty travellers usually do who are unable to take
notes on the spot.

We enter the temple by the most easterly of the three extant
I'ylons. This was originally 220 ft. broad, but its ruined exterior
is now more like a quarry than a building. Many representations
are still recognizable, though much defaced, 011 the broad surt'are
of its W. Side, next the first court. Beginning our inspection with
the N. Wing (Pl. al, to the extreme left (SE.) of the beholder, we
tirst notice the slender representations of pinnacled Asiatic fortresses,
in six rows, the two highest of which have been destroyed. Fourteen
of the original eighteen are still recognizable, each with an in-
scription containing its name, and in some cases also the year in
which it was taken by Ramses H. The isolated inscription at the

top, to the left, is translated by iurtou, Champollion, and Brugsch
