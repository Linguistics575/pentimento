105 ft., in order to form the imposing rock-fagade of this temple.
At the top we see a row of 22 cynocephali (some destroyed),
which me learn from other Egyptian temples to recognize as wer-
shippers of the sun-god. Below these are the cartouches of the
king, surrounded with Lrasus-serpents. Then follows the short de-
dication inscription of Ramses the Great, which begins in the
middle and runs in both directions: on the right it styles the king
'beloved by Tfarmachis', on the left'beloved by Ammon, king of
the gods'. Still lower, in a recess in the centre of the temple-wall, is
a full-relief statue of Horus (Harmachis), with the sun on his head
and the symbols of life in his hands, while below, to the right, is

the goddess Ma, to the left the symbol user, thus expressing the

king's name in picture-writing. To the right and left is the king
again, presenting figures which also express his name, and wor-
shipping the god. Below, and somewhat indistinct, are the double
cartouches of the king.

Our attention is most forcibly attracted to the four seated Colossi
(Pl. a. b, c, d), hewn out of the rock, with their backs against the
cliff. That to the left of the entrance (P1. b) has unfortunately been
violently deprived of its head and arms', which now lie on the
ground in front. The colossus on the other side of the door (Pl. C)
was restored by Seti 11. Each of those figures is not less than 65 ft.
high, their various limbs being in proportion. In spite of the enor-
mous scale the general effect is successful, and the tro11ntenaI1ces
have a pleasant and intelligent expression. All four represent
Ramses the Great, as is testified by the cartouches on the breast
and arms and between the legs. To the right and left of each are
standing figures, mostly of women; to the right and left of the en-
trance, Nofertari Meri-en-mut, consort of Ramses; between the legs
of the injured colossus, prince Amenhikhopeshf ('Ammon in his
sword'), who is introduced in the temple of Derr as the oldest son
(semes) of Ramses IL; to the left of this colossus Tua, the king's
mother. Beside the colossus farthest to the left are two daughters
of the king, viz. Nebt-tati, on the left, and Bant-anta on the right;
between the legs is an unnamed female figure. The figures at the
sides of the colossus to the extreme right, the names of which are
concealed by the sand, probably correspond to these. In 1817 Bel-
zoni spent "days in freeing the temple from the sand that had
drifted into it from the, desert behind. I", urekhardt, however, had
mentioned it previously. It was again laid bare by Lepsius in 1844
and by Mariette in 1869. but the sand has already covered great
part of it to a considerable depth.

Before we enter the temple Our attention is claimed by a Greek in-
scription which is found on the leftleg of the injured colossus, along with

various other Greek, Carian, and Phoenician inscriptions. It runs as
follows: -
