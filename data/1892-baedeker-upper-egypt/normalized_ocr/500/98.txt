by fine palms and Nile aeaeias, especially near the riverside villages.
Here, as in most of Egypt, large quantities of pigeons are kept by
the peasants, chiefly for the sake of their droppings, which form the
only manure used in the fields, the dung of the cattle being dried
and used as fuel. Large pigeon-houses, not unlike pylons, are
visible in all the villages, and huge floeks of pigeons are seen
wheeling In the air or settling like a dark cloud on the fields. Most
of these pigeons are of the common grey species, and attain a con-
siderable size, but many pretty little reddish-grey turtle doves are
also seen. The traveller is at liberty to shoot these birds, which in
the form of a pigeon-pie with olives form a most acceptable addi-
tion to his larder, but he should exercise this liberty with discretion
and not rob the harmless fellah oftoo many ofhis feathered friends.
The pigeons really consume more than they produce, so that their
encouragement by the fellzihiu is rightly regarded as a serious
mistake in their husbandry.

Those who are interested in Egyptian agriculture may utilise
the opportunity of an unfavourable wind to go ashore here. For-
merly convent after convent occupied this district, autl the gardens
of the monks, according to Makrizi, made it possible for the tra-
veller to walk continually in the shade. A few oonvents still remain,
such as the D'ir er-Rifeh (W. bank), 011 the slope of the Libyan
hills, 8 N. to the S.W. of AssiM., with the tomb of Tutus, son of
Rahotep and commander ofthe archers, and other ancient Egyptian
graves. The inscriptions prove that Shas-hotep, the capital of the
Hypselite nome, lay in this vicinity, and it may perhaps be identi-.
tied with the modern Shu.teb. Of the Christians who resided here in
the 11th cent. we are told that they spoke Greek as well as Coptic.
Interesting Coptic MSS. may still reward the searcher in all these
eonvents.

The traveller need not break his journey between Assiti.t and
Akhmim, as even the antiquarian will derive little profit from the
scanty remains on this part of the river. Wastah, nearly opposite
Assit1.t, perhaps occupies the site of the ancient Contralyeopolis. In
the Gebel Rokh√©m, to the TI. of the villages of et-Cr'ltortlb'iyeh and
Natufeh, is an alabaster quarry.

15 M. Butig or Abutig (steamboat and mail station), an agri-
cultural town on the W. bank with 10,800 inhah. and a small har-.
bour filled with Nile-toats, lies in the ancient Hypselite uome. The
present name is probably derived from the conversion of the ancient
Egyptian name Ha-abeti into the similarly-sounding Greek name of
'Aottrh'pct) (Apotheke; Coptic Tapothyke), i.e. Storehouse, an ad-.
mirable name for the chief town of a district so fertile in grain.
Among the Hellenes it was generally known as Abotis.

At Bedtri, on the E. bank, 2 M. from the river, are some rude
roek-tombs without inscriptions. On the W. bank follow the mail
steamboat-stations Sedfeh and Temeh.
