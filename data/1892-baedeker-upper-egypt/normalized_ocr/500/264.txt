192 Route 18. TIIEBES. West Bank:

Mounting to the left of the tomb of Ilekhmarii we reach (to the
left of No. d8) a lately discovered tomb, rather difficult of access.
The trouble of the ascent, however, is repaid by the beauty and
freshness of the paintings. It belonged to Sen-nefer (good brother),
superintendent of the southern city, overseer ot' the granaries of
Ammon, and superior of the tlocks ofAmmon, under Amenhotep II.
Strangely enough the name ofAlarander (Arkes antes) is also found
here. To the right, immediately above the tomb of1lekhmas, is
that (now No. 6Oot'Amuzeh, superintendent of the palace under
Tutmes III. and Amenhotep H. This also eonsi: ts of a large vesti-
bnle with niches in the sides, and a rather long passage cut into
the hill.

The representations on the inner wall of the vestibule are Worth nn-
ticing. 0n the left are the African tribes bringing in their tribute eon-
sisiing of gold, ivory, apes, panther-skins and the like. On the right, is
the tribute of the Asiaties, jars, a carriage, a while and a brown horse,
and various weapons. In both corners of the vestibule Were steles, of
which only that on the right has been preserved containing a prayer to
Ra in the name of the deceased. 0n the vight-harut side of the long, pas-
sage into the hill is a scene illustrating the chase of waterfowl.'

To the right close to No. 51 is the tomb ofAmen-em-heb (No. 86)
known to CJhampollion and described by Ebers and Stern. It con-
sists of two halts one behind the other, of which the length is at
right angles to the passage between them, and of a chamber behind
the second hall.

The historical Inscriptimz. on the left inner wall ofthehstballpaintei1
in blue on white stucco, and diseovcred by Prof. Ebers, is of special in-
terest. In it Amen-em-heb describes the purt which he took in the cam-
paigns of Tutmes III., and gives' exact information of the length of that
Pharaoh's reign, and the accession of his successor Anoenhotey II. He
does not forget to record the honours which the favour of his prince had
heaped upon him. "was', he begins'his 1ordship's great fidclity, the
pride of the, king of Lower Egypt, the half of the heart of the king of t'pper
Egypt. I followed my lord into the country of the north and ofthe smith
according to his will etc.'Theu he recounts how he took part in the victorious

expeditions to South Palestine (SCSdl Neheb 2.%, Ne-

sopotamia (Naharain), the well-wooded ITiin westward of Khalybop (Aleppo),
Karkhemish, beyond the river of Mesopotamia (the Euphrates), Tyre (?),
Katesh, Niniveh, etc. Everywhere he obtained spoil and was' rewarded
with presents of rings and helmets, and decorated with necklaces, the
badges of orders, including the'thauunent of the Lion'. The fellow-
ing is an interesting passage:'Another time the lord of both worlds per-
formed a mighty deed before Niniveh, when he hunted 120 elephants for
their tusks. I killed the greatest among them, fighting in the sight nfltis
Najesty, and cut off its trunk'. iln returning to Egypt Amen-em-heb re-
mained with King Tutmes 111., who died in the 54th year of his reign an
the last day Of the third winter month.'He ascended to heaven at, the
going down of the sun, and the servant of God made himself One with
his Maker. When it was morning and the earth became clear and the sun's
face arose and the heavens were made bright, then did the king of Upper
and Lower Egypt, Ameuhotep 11., ascend his father's throne'. Under this
Pharaoh also the general enjoyed high honours. His skull is preserved
in the anatomical museum of Leipsie. His biography was composed by
another commander-in-chief, named Nah.
