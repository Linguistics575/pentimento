and stars. Cnrtius states that the figure of the god was like a navel;
round it were emeralds and other precious stones. The extant remains
date from a late period; a fragment bearing a royal eartonehe appears to
date from Neetanehus I.

Ninuioli further mentions the corner-stones of a Girdle Wall near
the, temple; they are still to be found at the N.E. angle. The girdle-wall
was 77 paces long and 66 paces broad. It a arently belonged to the
seeond temple mentioned by Diodnrus (see p. 515), for in a pretty palm-
grove only about 1/2 M. to the S.E. of it is the Sun Spring, known also
to llerodotus (IV,181). This oval spring, about 110 paces in 1: ireurrv.
ference, is now called'Ain (fammdm. The story ofthe peculiar properties
of this spring, repeated hy all the ancient writers, in virtue of which its
temperature varied at different periods of the day, rests upon error. For
the water has a uniform temperature of73112° Fahr., though it may somew
times appear warmer than it really is, in the often very cold nights,
while at midday it may seem almost cold in contrast to the heat of the
burning sun.

tohtfs t'ailed to find in Siwnh any confirmation of the statements of
the natives, reported by St. John, that some of the houses rest upon
more ancient buildings-To the N. of Siwah is the Gebel Mfltih, or hill
of the dead, a limestone hill about 150 ft. high and 1600 yds. in circum-
ference, perforated with hundreds of vaults, graves, and catacombs.
Some of the vaults are large enough for a hundred or more corpses. All
the graves have been rifled, and heaps of skulls and shattered skeletons
lie around. Half way up the hill, on the E. side, is a, solitary tomb of
more pretensions, with its entrance adorned with pilasters. Beyond a
fore-court is a spacious sepulehra ] chamber, with two side-rooms, and
.adorned with a vivid green garland of vine-leaves on a blue ground. In
the background are some defaced ehisellcd figures. At Beled ev-Mm, to
the IV. of Slwah, is another cemetery excavated in a hill. Here also are
the remains of an ancient Egyptian.temple (Kat'sr er-Pda), ti? n. long hy
IN/e ft. broad, without any hieroglyphies. A little to the N. of this
temple are some scanty remains of a late period, 011 the hill'Amarlin
(Two Columns). At Bdb et-2fedineh, 3 31. to the S.W. of Siwah, Rohlfs
discovered a marble ram, now in the museum at Berlin---The Lake of
Arakhiyeh, about 60 M. to the N.W. of Siwah, is of little importance,
though the French colonel Berlin was induced by the wonderful tales of
the Arabs to bring a boat for the purpose of exploring it.

On the return from the oasis to Terzineh, or to Kafr deud (Vol. L,
