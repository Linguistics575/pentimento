86 Route 7. DENDERAH. Hathor

lae, Augustus is constantly indicated by the accompanying car-
touches'Atttokrator Risres'. The temple was probably built in the
unsettled times of the later Ptolemies, and the priests were there-
fore left in doubt whether to flll in the cartouches with the name of
Ptolemy or of Augustus.

The representations on the walls and columns, many of which
well deserve special attention, exhibit here also the Egyptian ruler
worshipping Hathor or some other of the divinities revered in her
temple. They illustrate several most remarkable ceremonies, which
the king performed according to the prescribed ritual in presence of
the images of the gods in the temple. We have seen reason to be-.
lieve that the sculptured decorations of all the temple-chambers
were executed about the end of the period of the Ptolemies and the
beginning of the Roman empire. (The sculptures in some of the
chambers in the sunk-floor and in several of the higher secret pas-
sages, date from the reigns of Ptolemies X., XL, and XIII.) Yet in
spite of that, the entire adornment on the wallsis arranged according
to early Egyptian patterns; so that the ceremonies here depicted
were not first introduced under the empire, and probably no Roman
emperor ever took part in these ceremonies in this temple of Hathor.
The walls of the temple at Denderah exhibit exclusively Early Egyp-
tian Manners and Customs. What we here learn are the ceremonies
imposed by the priesthood on the early Egyptian monarch who cle-
sired to worship the goddess. Thus in a representation to the right
of the entrance the king appears twice Over in the same design.
First we see him, clad in a long robe and carrying a staff, entering
the hall, preceded by the priest wearing the panther-skin and
sprinkling incense on the burning censer. Next we see him stand-
ing before the image of llathor, his robe laid aside; bending for-
ward he goes through the motion of cleaving the earth with the
short hand-plough in his hand, because it was an immemorial
custom that the Egyptian king should turn the first sod on the site
of a temple. (In the explanatory inscription here, as elsewhere,
this ceremony is named'turi ta', cleaving of the ground.) The king
also smote the first blow with the hammer at the laying of the-foun-
dation-stone, and shaped the first brick for the enclosing walls,
which were usually built of unburned bricks of Nile-mud dried in
the sun. All these ceremonies performed by early Egyptian monarchs
at the foundation of a temple, are here faithfully recorded acomding
to early models, both in visible shape and by explanatory in-
scriptions. They are also recorded in the lowest of the four rows
on the W. and E. exterior walls of the temple. In the temple of
Horus at Edfu the king is represented performing similar cere-
momes.

Another picture, also referring to the founding of a temple,
appears on the immediately adjoining wall. Here the king once
more appears before Ilathor, hearing in his hand the bnihling-too)
