foundations is reckoned at 86,456 individuals, of which b2,620 belonged
to the largest temple (at Medinet-Iiabu ]. The ahove-mentioned Temple U.
bore the name Pa Ramses hak an (House of Ramses, prince of Heliopolis)
and had 2622 priests and attendants.

The building is in form a complete temple, but in view of the
enormous dimensions of its surroundings can claim only the cha-
racter of a chapel. Its total length is 170ft. The Pylon with the
entrance door is much injured, especially at the top. ieyond itis a
Peristyle Court f.l'l. a), with eight Osiris-pillars on each side, and
at the end four caryatide pillars forming a Passage (P1. fi), whence a
deer leads to a small ffypostyle (Pl. 7:), with eight papyrus-bud ca-
pitals. Finally come the chambers of the Sanctuary (Pl. B). Sculp-
ture is not wanting in this temple, which owes its origin to the
wealthy founder of the Memnonium at Medinet IIabu (p. 174).
This most lavish of Egyptian kings had already founded within the

in three rows. 1n the lirst two rows are the conquered nations of the
south, in the third row those of the north. On the Right Wing are
similar representations, the king here wearing the crown of Lower

Egypt. In the doorway, Ramses Ill. receives from Ammon

the symbol of life, etc. On the right side-wall of the pylons are
representations of battles and captives, which were concealed by
the colonmule, a cenelusive proof that the circumference of the court
cannot date from Ramses 11.
