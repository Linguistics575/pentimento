LOWER NUBIA
from Philae to Wédi Halfah.

217 M. The'voyage from Philw to Wddi yal.fali was until about ten
years ago easily accomplished and formed an agreeable continuation of the
Nile-route. Travellers either caused their own dhahabiyehs to be towed
up the rapids (p. 273) 0r proceeded in Cook's fortnightly tourist-steamer.
Circumstances were, however, completely altered by the war in the Siidiin
and by the giving up of the region above Wiidi Halfah in 1885. After that
date the only means of ascending the Nile to Nubia was offered by the
weekly government steamer which conveyed the mails and military stores,
and performed the entire journey without stopping suffieiently long at any
intermediate point to allow of a visit to the monuments. In 1590, however,
Messrs. Cook and Son again started a weekly service of steamers between
the fhat and second cataract. These'stern-Wheelers' (Semneh, Aksheh)
are srnalul2-ll passengers) and not very eomfortable, especially when there
is a large party On board. The dining-saloon is over the stern-paddle,
the cabins are eonfined, and the commissariat limited. Halts are made
at comparatively few points, though it is possible to increase these by
arrangement with the engineer, if the passengers are unanimous. Zaptiyeh
0r gens d'armes accompany the steamer to protect it. The voyage lasts
for 7 days, tie. Philae is usually reached again on the afternoon of
the 7th day. The inclusive fare is 301., or'2it. for those who have as-
cended the Nile to Assutsn as Cook's tourists.

early in the morning and passengers and luggage are transferred to the

When the halts are multiplied at the request of the passengers, a dif-
ferent distribution of time may be adopted; e.g. lst day: 1? ybt1t, Fettappi,
Tafeh, and Falahshelr, 2nd day: Dakkeh (k hrs. halt), Ofedinah, and Fo-
rusko; 3rd day:'Amiidah and Ahu-Simbe1rdth day: Wiidi Halfah; 5th day:
Visit to the second cataract; return in the afternoon to Abu-Simbel;
6th day: Korusko (1/2 hr's. halt) and b'ebit" ah, where the temple is visited;
7th day: After short halts at llendl'lr and Kulabsheh, reach Philm at 5 p.111.

It is to be hoped that the region of the Upper Nile will soon be safe
enough to permit the voyage to be made by dhahabtyehs once more. The
writer accomplished such a voyage in 1870, visiting all the important
monuments both going, and coming. The cost, including the towing of
the dhahabiyeh up the first cataract, may be reckoned at about 1701. for
a party of 4-5, which added to the cost of the journey (2 months) to As-
sntn 4201. gives a total of (3201. for the 3 monthsjourney; for u' pers. TOOL,
for 8 pers. 8001., for 10 pers. 1000!. (comp. the Introduction, p. xix). Some
dhahabiyehs are not adapted to ascend beyond the tirst cataract; travellers
