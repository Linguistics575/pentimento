moved the long processiuns which left the temple ofAmmon to visit
the W. parts of Thebes. State-barges, glittering with gold and
brilliant colours, waited here to receive the priests and the sacred
images. On the river-steps were ranged choirs, which, at least on
the tive great festival days of Ammon, greeted the pilgrims from the
opposite bank with songs. The ancient constructions on the banks
have long been washed away. In January and February, the months
in which most travellers visit Iiarnak, the stream is only 100-200
paces from the procession-avenue; while during the inundation the
water penetrates into the interior of the temple, which in ancient
times it was prevented from doing by huge embankments Ram-
ses 11. constructed this route to the river, yet most of the Krie-
sPhinxes that adorn it have statuettes of Seti II. Merenptah
between their legs, and two small broken obelisks also bear the
name of Seti who reigned towards the close of the 19th Dynasty.
in 1853 a small temple with the name of king I'sammuthis, of the
20th Dyn., was discovered at the SW. corner of the pylon to
the right..

The *First Main Pylon (Pl. I) is of enormous size. It is still
12't yds. wide, with walls 10 ft. think and 1421/2 ft. high. This
gigantic portal, which probably dates from the Ptolemies, although
no record of the fact is known, is destitute of inscriptions. Possibly
it Was covered with stucco and adorned with paintings, as its dece-
ration with reliefs would have demanded enormous toil and time.
No one should omit to make the *Ascent of this pylon. This may
be done most easily, and without any danger or special difficulty,
on the N. side, till we are about half way up, and thence by means
of a steep and narrow stair in the interior. The top is so broad that
even those who are subject to giddiness need not fear to trust them-
solves upon it. After enjoying the extraordinary viewoftheiinmense
ruins from this point of vantage, it is useful and interesting to seek
to identify, with the aid of the accompanying plan, the various col-.
mnns, rbelisks, and pillars which at first present themselves in
apparently inextricable confusion. This is comparatively easy as
regards the nearer UV.) portion of the temple; but the more distant
portions, from among which obelisks tower, are partly out of sight,
and are partly so foreshortened by distance, that they appear to
form one confused system of ruins. The view by moonlight is in-
descrihably fine. lut on the whole the result is a general though
incffaceable impression, rather than a _ idea of the arrangement
of the various parts of the building. The latter is only to be obtained
by wandering, plan in hand, through the ruins. It must, however,
never he forgotten that the temple of liarnak, so far from having
one single uniform plan, grew up gradually, and that many of its
parts owe their chararter not to any artistic calculation, but to
such accidental considerations as the space at the disposal of the
architect, the means and length of life of the huihler, and tho like.
