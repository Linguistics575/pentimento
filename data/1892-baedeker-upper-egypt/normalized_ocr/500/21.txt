In COPPER there are also pieces of 1/2 and / Milliéme (called also
2 Pave and 1 Para pieces, from the old system), but these are used only
for bakshish by tourists.

The difference between Tar'i.tr-piastves and Current-pz'astres has been
legally abolished; but it still lingers among shopkeepers, So that yur-
chasers should be careful to ascertain in Which reckoning the prices of
goods are stated.

The Pound Sterling (Gim'h 1iqlisi) is worth 97 piastres 5 milliéme;
the French Twenty Franc piece (Binl, derived from Napoleon Bonaparte)
77 pies. 11/2 mill.; the Turkish Pound (£1; gfeyidtyeh) 873/4 piastres. A
'purse' is equivalent to 500 piastres or about 10is.

Before starting on the NiIe-journey travellers are recommended to
provide themselves with at least 40 or 50 frames' worth of small Egyptian
coins (especially 1/2 piastres, 1 and 2 mmilune-pieees, and copper ]. Even
in Cairo a commission is charged on the exchange.

Dimhab? yeh. The farmer is recommended to those who have not
more than three or four weeks to devote to a visit to the Nile valley
and the monuments of the Pharaohs; and in fact for the immense
majority of travellers, especially for those who do not belong to a
party, the steamers are the only practicable means of making the
journey. Travellers, however, who desire to make a closer acquain-
tance with the country, who have abundance oftime (to Assuin and
back at least 7-8 weeks), and who are indifferent to a considerable
increase of expense, should hire a dhahabiyeh (p. xix).

The company met with on board the steamers is generally un-
exoeptionable, though, of course, it is always wise to use some little
exertion to secure an agreeable and sympathetic etabin--eornpanion.
The trunks to be taken into the cabins should be small and handy,
