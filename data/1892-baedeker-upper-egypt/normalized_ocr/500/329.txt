the contests of the god Horus with his enemies who are depicted
as crocodiles and hippopotami. Perhaps the overthrow of the foes
of King Ptolemy X. Soter II. is symbolically represented in these
compositions. The cartouches on this wall probably belong to this
king; one of them contains the name of Ptulmis, while the other is
vacant. The name of Ptolemy NI. Alexander I. does not appear
until near the left extremity of the wall, towards the end of the
list of nomes.

The Representations, ranged in twn registers, are W, in number. The
chief are the following: lst Scene (below, to the right). The king, stand-
ing on shore, attempts to transiix a hippopotamus, that bends its head
aside. Horus, who is accompanied by his mother Isis, does the same: in
his left hand he holds a chain, and in his right ajavelin; beside the
helm is a small 2rortre.--2nd Scene. The king appears on land, before
two ships, in each of which are a Horus and an assistant with a hoar's
head. Horus holds the hippopotamus with a chain and pierces its head
with a javelin; the assistant carries a javelin in his right hand and a
knife in his left.--iith Scene. The hippopotamus lies on its hack. with
a chain fastened to its hind feet.-7th Scene (the finest of all). Horus,
in a ship with expanded sail, aims a blow with his right hand at the
head of a hippopotamus, whose hind foot is caught in a line held in the
god's left hand. Isis kneeling in the how of the heat holds the head of
the animal by a eor0. The king, standing on the bank with two atten-
dants armed with javelin and knife, seeks to pierce the skull of the
hippopotamus.

On the inside of the N. Girdle-wall (Pl. g g) are several long
hymns to the god of Edfu. - The traveller is recommended to walk
round the outside of the girdle-wall, which is also completely
covered with representations andinscriptions. The above-mentioned
important inscription relating to the history of' the temple is to be
seen on the outside of the W. Walt (P1. i), and the description of
the various rooms outside the E. Wall (Pl. k). The eight Records
of Donations of Fields are also on the E. wall. These inscriptions
and the decoration of the entire external face of the girdle-wall
date from the reign of Ptolemy XI. Alexander 1. (106-87 B.c0.

The half-buried Birth Rouse (Mameisi), lying to the left of the entrance
to the great temple of Horus, is less worthy of a visit. It was built by
Ptolemy IX. Eueraetes 11., while the interior decorations date from
Soter II. In the Interior are seven representations of Hathor, who facili-
tate the birth of the young Horus and nourish him.

On the E. bank, about 5 M. above Edfu, is the village ofRedisiyeh,
