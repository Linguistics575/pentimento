churches on the Nile as far as Syene to he torn down and the temples to
be restored.

The place suffered greatly at the hands of the Blemmyes, but be-
came the seat of a Christian bishop, and appears to have rapidly regained
its prosperity under the Khalifs. Leo Afrirmms (14th cent.) saw here some
towers of unusual height, which can only'he regarded as the pylons of
some large temple, as they were named Barba by the natives, a name
easily traced from the Egyptian'pa erpe' i.e. the temple.

After the close of the 12th cent. Assuiin suffered still mOre severely
from the incursions of plundering Arab tribes, finally put a stop to by a
Turkish garrison stationed here by the sultan Selim, after the conquest
of Egypt in 1517. Many of the present inhabitants claim descent from
these Turks.

To the S. and N. of the landing-place, at which various craft
are always lying:, two edifices project into the river. One of these
is a ruined Arabian fort, the other a ruined building, probably a
bath, for which stones of earlier buildings have been used, and
dating more probably from the Khalifs than from Roman times.
The upper part of the town presents large clay walls with few win-
dows towards the stream; the lower part is screened by palm-
groves, through whose green foliage gleam the outlines of Frags,
heaps of rubbish, a dark gray clay wall, and a pure white minaret.
Huge granite cliffs rise from the stream. To the W. lies the green
and fertile island of Elephantine, shaped like the head of a lance,
and still farther to the W., on the Libyan hank, rises a ruined Arab
castle, projecting darkly from the yellow sand-slopes of the range
of hills across which the telegraph-wires are conducted. To the E.
the prospect is bounded by the Arabian hills, in which, more to
the s.. are some huge empty graves of saints. Everywhere the eye
finds rest. The Nile, with its divided channel, appears small; but
it still preserves its venerable aspect, for everywhere, even on the
rocks by the stream, are inscriptions and numerous memorials of
the grand old times, especially as we look towards the island.

In Antiquities, Assu√©n is not very rich. Besides the small
Ptolemaie Temple beside the land-route to Philm (p. 974), only
a few Rock Inscriptions on the river-bank call for mention.+ One
dates from Rameren of the 6th Dyn.; several from the 12th Dyn.,
from Usertesen I., from the 35th year of Amenemha II. coinciding
with the 3rd year of his adopted successor Userteseu ll., and one
from the 5th year of the same king. In both the latter a certain
Mentuhotep is mentioned. There is also a stele of the 10th year of
Usertesen III. and one with the name Neferhotep, of the 13th Dy-
nasty. Another important stele, dating from the first year of Tut-

mes ll, (c a 3 y), contains a detailed report of the conquest

'r The remains of two other temples are described in the Description
de I'Egypte, but both have now disappeared. One was a tetrastyle Por-
tico, the other a Hall, dedicated by the emperor Nerve to the gods of
Ass1tan, Khnum, Sati, Anuke, and Nephthys, and to Osiris, Isis, Sebek,
and Hathor. Champollion saw the latter in 1829.
