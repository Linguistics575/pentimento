Romans the oasis was named Oasis Minor and was garrisoned by the Ala
prima Quadorum. The present name et-tod?? ed-tMkh'leh means'inner oasis'.

Ed-Diikhel lies 4-5 days' journey from Fariifrah (Cailliaud, Rohlfs),
5 long days" journey from AvsiCa.t (Edmonstone), and 3, or at most 4, from
e1-Ehiirgeh. The last-named route is described below.

The oasis was visited in 18t8 by Drovetti, in 1319 by Edmonstone,
and in 1873 by Rohlfs, with Zittel, Jordan, and Ascherson, starting from
Ftuiifrah The ascent amid the picturesque cliffs of the so-called Bab
el-0ailliaud, 0n the last mentioned route, is very impressive.

The oasis has at present about 17,000 inhabitants It is very rich in
date-palms and olive-trises, and produces wheat, barley, rice, dura, and
dukhn, though not sufficient for its own consumption. Large aeacias
(s.un.t-tvees), and fruit-trees, such as apricot and walnut trees, fhurish.
The chief villages are el-f.rq.se, Kahuna", and Budshulu (see below).

The route from erirrkeh to Diikhel leads NYW. to (15 hrs) Tlin
Atnttt', there turns due W. to (IN/se hrs.) Tenidah, at the E. extremity of
the oasis, and proceeds viii "hrs.) B (rlad, (41/4 hrs.) Smint, and (31/2h1's.)
Mut, Finally it bends to the N. vist Rnshz'duh and Budshulu to (7 hrs.)
eZ-Kagr, which we thus reach 193/4 hrs after leaving Tenidah.

In 11/4 hr. after leaving el-Kljrgeh we pass the ruins of Kaer et.U.drif,
in 7 hrs. more those of Kaer el-.ftiklidt'tth, and in 51/4 hrs more reach the
foot of the Geiwel AvMr. An ascent of 3/4 hr. brings us to the middle of
the mountain-slope, along which we ride for 1/2 hr to Kasr "Ain Amar.
Here are the shattered remains of a small temple in the "Cartier-Egyptian
style, On which Wilkinson discovered the name Caesar, According to
Cailliaud's measurements the temple is 711/2 ft. long and M ft. broad. It
consisted of a vestibule, and a larger room with a smaller one behind it,
with three doors leading to three other chambers, the central one being
the adytum (Plan in Cailliaud's Voyage it Meroe II, XLII. 1). Inside the
girdle-wall of the temple is a scanty Spring with a somewhat unpleasant
taste. Ive continue our journey in a steep gorge, which leads in 1/2 hr.
to the top of the Gebel Am" (1765 ft. above the sea-level). Thence the
route leads to the W. armg the height to (5 hrs.) el-t7atodczi, beyond
which a rocky path (limestone), very difficult for camels, leads to (31/2 hrs.)
Aim Tartar, an isolated peak rising from the plateau. Our descent (3/4 hr.)
begins at (3 hrs.) "Alcahet esli-8li√©'khdwi. We begin a second descent at
CY/e. hrs.)'Almbet os- & fttmn, which brings us in lo min to the valley of

interrupted twice by the desert, so as to form, strictly speaking, three
oases. The last of these. lying'N and R, is the most considerable. After
passing two springs,'Ain Segah and'Afn Ansorah, we reach the considerable
village of Ten'idah, with $ 00 inhab., largely employed in the production of
indigo. The manufacture is carried on in the open air under palm-leave
sheds. The dried leaves are placed in earthen pots with boiling water,
which is stirred with a stick until the dye-stuff has been separated from
the leaves. The blue liquid is then poured into shallow holes in the
earth, and the water allowed to evaporate. To the left of the route, near
the spring of'Ain el-Birbeh, abrn1t 1 hr. beyond Tenidah, are the remains
of a square vaulted temple er a Roman fort, consisting of three main
