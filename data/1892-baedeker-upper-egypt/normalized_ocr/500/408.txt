324 Route 32. SEBL'MH. From Dakkeh

is rendered difficult by the accumulations of sand. The first room
contained six large and six small pillars, the former being meant
to support the central beams. The following narrow room is ad-
joined by two side-chambers and three other chambers in the
back-wall. In this room appears Ramses IL worshipping and pre-
senting. offerings to various deities. Under a canopy are four gods.
The foremost is Ptah, bare-headed and in his usual mummy-form,

with 1 -i- and. He is named the Ptah of King Ramses in Pa-.

amon. Then, as at Dakkeh, follows the seated figure ofa second
Ptah, wearing, as a headdress the bulrs horns with two feathers

between them J. This Ptah is described as'lofty with the two

feathers and the horns', Next is a female figure with the moon-disc
(perhaps Rat-tati), and finally comes Hathor, goddess of the southern
Nehet (sycamore tree), with horns turned upwards enclosing two
feathers and the sun-dise. The colouring of the sacrificial scenes in
the side-ehambers is well-preserved; and this is still more the case
in the adytum, the central of the three chambers at the back. Both
to the right and left in this room the king is represented sacrificing
before a richly adorned dhahabiyeh. The dhahabiyeh on the right has
thehawk'sheadofHarmachis as its emblem, that on the left the ram's
head of Khnum-Ra. Both stand 011 ornamented tables. On the left
the king is offering incense above an altar, 011 the right he is offer-
ing flowers. A large fan is borne beside him, and behind are stan-
dards with the heads of the two gods and of the king. - The cen-
tral picture exhibits Khnum-Ra seated in a boat beneath a canopy,
with the kneeling king to the left and three cynocephali to the
ri.ght. Beneath is a recess, in which the outlines of three gods may
still he made out, although a figure of St. Peter, with a halo und a
large key, has been painted over them. The king, who appears on
the right and left, with flowers, has, now the appearance of offering
them to the saint. Beneath is an inscription, running both to the
right and to the left and extending on to the side walls:'The living
Hor-Ra, the strong, the beloved of Ma, lord of the festivals, like his
father Ptah, king of both lands, Ramses the Great, he has made it
in memory of his father Ammon-Ra, king of the gods'.



Beyond Sebtfah the seenery assumes a regularly desert character,
Which it retains until near Korusko. Rocky isolated peaks rise on
the left. At Jfalki the Nile makes a sudden bend, and beyond this
point the banks are once more cultivated, while dense palm-groves
appear on the left (E), with scattered huts and many stlityelrs.
