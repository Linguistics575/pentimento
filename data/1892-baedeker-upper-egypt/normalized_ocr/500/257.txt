the actual sanctuary. Little ofthem remained. and the laterPharaohs.
and even the Ptolemies and Roman emperors (notab1y Antoninus
Pius) extended the old building. The following description begins
at the E. fatiade, which faces us when we turn to the left. (N.) after
returning through the gate of the so-called pavilion.

The visitor approaching from the Nile is ronfronted with a hand-
smne Pylon (1'l. K), to the N. of the entrance to the temple
of Ramses. 1n the centre is a beautiful gateway, with a well-
exernted winged disc of the sun in the deep concave cornice. The
narrow fore-eourt in front was enclosed under the Ptolemies with
columns. of which only the two at the entrance have been preserved
(beside Pl. 1). In the hreader fore-court outside LPI. II) the car-
tnuehe ot' the emperor Antoninus Pius occurs several times. The
large Pylon (P1. li) dates from the late Ptoiemaie epeeh. for it ex-
hibits Ptolemy Soter 11. Lathyrus worshipping, the gods; hut it in-
cludes stones from an earlier edifice, some of which are upside down
and some show detached fragments of inscriptions (cg. sacrificial
lists, with the names of Ramses 11.). Beyond the pylon is a Chapel
(Pl. L), only 30ft. long, dating from the reign of Neetanehus 11.,
who was acknowledged as king by the Egyptians in the middle at
the Persian epoch. The roof was supported by eight columns which,
however, have disappeared, leaving only the low walls which con-
nected them like screens. Immediately adjoining the chapel is a
Second Pylon, :30 ft. wide, which was erected under Taharka the
Ethiopian (0s5th Dyn.) and renewed and providedwith inscriptions
by Ptolemy Lathyrns. On the front of this pylon appears Neet-
anebns ll., on the back Taharka. Beyond this is a ruined Court
(PLM), with (to the right) the granite 1inte1s of a g, ateway, built by
Petamenap, a noble living under the'26th Dyn., to whom the
large tomb at el-Asasif (p.'222) belongs. We now at last reach the
OLDEST TEMPLE BUILDINGS, begun Under Amenhotep I. and Tut-
mes I.. completed under llamaka, Tntmes If., and Tutmes Ill., and
restored by later kings, including, even Ptolemy Physkou. These
late restorations were of triiling importance; as a whole the build-
ing is beyond doubt a work of the 18th Dynasty. It consists of a
Sanctuary (_P1. b"), like the cella of a Greek temp! e, forming the
kernel of the entire edifice. surrounded on three sides by pillars,
while on the rear it is adjoined by Sir Apartments. Jetween the
rows of pillars to the right and left and the cella, and also behind the
latter, were polygonal columns, resembling those which are to he
found at Benihasan and the oldest parts of Karnak. Those in
front have been destroyed, but one has remained erect behind
the cella. The inscriptions are written for the mest part in the
beautiful style. of the ch Dyn., but contain nothing of importance.
