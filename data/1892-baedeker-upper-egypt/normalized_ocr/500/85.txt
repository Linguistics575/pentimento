cemetery. On the, way, espeeially in the forenoon, We often meet
funeral processions, resembling, with their wailing women and
water-distributors, those of Cairo, but producing a much more
solemn effect through the absence of the bustle of the crowded
streets and the presence of the deserted city of the dead. Nowhere,
not even in Cairo, are the funeral songs so strange and weird as
here, or sung: by such deep and tuneful voices.

At the foot of the hill we dismount and follow the good path
which leads to the most interesting tombs. A tomb below, near the
Arab cemetery, is unimportant. Mighty grandees of the ancient
empire, who tilled the highest secular and eeclesiastiral offices,
hewerl huge vaults in the rocks here for the reception oftheir mum-
mies. Other tombs, smaller and less elaborately deeorated, belong
to simple burghers of a later period; and there are also holes in the
rock for mummies of the jackal, which was sacred to Anubis Apheru,
the local deity of Assitst.. It is this animal that the Greeks in this
instance wrongly called Lykos or wolf (whence Lycopolis), but a
few genniuewolf-bones have also been discovered here. Mummitied
dogs, kittens, and birds of prey have been found, wrapped in linen
bands and sometimes adorned with gilding. Those who do not ob-.
ject to creep into some of the dusty and ill-smelling holes will still
easily find fragments of sacred animals. The jackal, along with the
Urzeus-snake, ilaunted proudly on the standard of this nome, the
chief town of which was the capital of the whole of Upper Egypt in
the time of the ancient empire.

The path, which is well-made though somewhat steep, leads us
tirsrto a. large rock-hall, the ceiling of which is roughly hewn in
the form of a vault and still bears traces of blue Mars painted on a
yellow ground.'Sadly defaced inscriptions, in the style of the an-
cient empire, Cover the walls., The hieroglyphies on the door are half
obliterated, but enough remains to show that this was the grave of
I.hsp-Ze/h, son ofDame At at, a high-priest, and governor ofS.Egypt.
The Arabs call it Istabl'Antar, or the stable of Antar, a hero of
tradition (comp. their name for the Speos Artemidos at Benihasau,
p. Ir). The *View from this tomb is very tine. The fertile land
and the Nile enclosed by the limestone hills of Libya and the Ara-
bian mountainsin the distance form a quiet but by no means mono-
tonous setting for the beautiful town of Assititwith its eleven mina-
rcts and its environment ofpalm-garclens. The view is still grander
from the higher tombs. The second chamber of this tomb is covered
with important inscriptions. To the right on entering is one of
64 lines, which cannot be read without the aid ofa long ladder and
a good lantern. It contains ten articles from the code relating to
the worship of the dead, determining, amongst other things, the
sacrificial gifts for the statues of the deceased. These were trans-
lated first by Maspero and afterwards by Erman, while the revised
text has been published by F. L. G'riflitlt (1889). To the left is
