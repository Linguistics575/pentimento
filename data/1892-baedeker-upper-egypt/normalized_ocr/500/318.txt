turies has heaped itself around the temple; and later dwellings
have been erected on the top of earlier ones. This alone can explain
how the temple is now at a much lower level than the surrounding
village.

The building presented a very different appearance only thirty years
ago. Arab houses stood upon the temple itself and were built against
its walls. The interior was filled with rubbish almost up to the capitals
of the columns, and the outside was equally deeply buried. A picture of
the edifice as it then was may be seen in plates M) and 55 in the first
volume of the Antiquités in the Description de PEgypte. In the beginning
of the sixties, however, the entire temple was laid bare by Mariette under
the auspices of the Khedive, and the buildings clustering upon and around
it were removed. Now the temple of Edfu is seen in wonderful, almost
perfect preservation, exceeding that of any other Egyptian temple or even
of any antique building in the world, in spite of the 21.00 years that
have passed over it. From top to bottom it is covered with represen-
tations and remarkable inscriptions, the interpretation of which was
reserved for the present century, so rich in discoveries of every kind.

The'" Temple of Edfu is superior to the temple at Denderah in
the much greater distinctness of its sculptured reliefs and inscrip-
tions, due probably to the use of better sandstone than that of
Denderah which contains more lime. It is also much more complete,
for in addition to chambers corresponding to those found at.Den-
derah, there are at Edfu a passage running round the temple and
a lofty wall enclosing the latter, besides a spacious fore-court and
two massive pylons. (Comp. the accompanying Plan with that of
Denderah at p. 80.)

The inscriptions in the, temple at Edfu have been published in
Jhorniehen's Al (c'igyptische Tempelinscliriften (113 plates; 1567), the geo-
graphical inscriptions in his Recucil de monuments égyptiens, and in J. de
Rouge's Edfu, from notes by his father E. de Rougé [ 1880). The last-
named work, however, has many errors. The important Builders' In-
scriptions are to he found in the. Agyptt'sche Zeitschrift for 1870-71-73-75,
and in 1lrugseh's Jralenderinsenriftert (Thesaurus 11.). Mons. Naville of
Geneva has published the text of the battles of Hnrus at Edfu, and Ley-
sito the first three of the field-texts.

The modern Arabic name of the, village of Ed/U is derived from

the Coptic avrfuu, formed in its turn from the old-Egyptian

h Tebu, the name given 111 the jnseriptiorls to the metropolis

of the second district of Upper Egypt. This district, named Tes-
Hor, i.e. the district of the raising of Horus, + the Apoltin0polites
of Greek coins, was bounded on the S. by the Names Nubia, the
capital of which was' Elephantine, and on the N. by Lutopolitess,
the capital of which was Semi, the modern Esneh. In the great war
of the gods waged by Ra-Helios and his companions against the
evil Setlr-Typhon and his allied demons, the principal champion is
the great Horus-Apollo, who destroys the enemies of Ra. The
