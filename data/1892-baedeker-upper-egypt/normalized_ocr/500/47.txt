a. By Railway.

2'.29 M. The railway-station, Btihi.k edu) akrfr, which is also the start-
ing-point of the direct line to Téh e1-Biirt1d and Alexandria, is situated
0n the W. bank of the Nile, 3 M. from Cairo (connection with main
railway-station in prospect). Carriage from the hotel to the station 4 fr.;
for heavy luggage a second carriage is necessary, as the baggage-waggons
cannot be implicitly relied on. Passengers should be at the station early,
as the proaesses of ticket-taking and luggage-weighing are by no means
expeditious. The fhyst-ela8s carriages are, of course, the most comfortable
from a European point of view, and first-class passengers are allowed to
take with them in their compartment all their smaller articles of baggage
and even trunks. The natives almost invariably travel second-ttlass, and
those who wish to make a nearer acquaintance with the country and the
people should, perhaps, select a seeond-elags compartment, in spite of its
ofl'ering less resistance to the incursion of the yellow desert sand (comp.
Baedeker's Lower Egypt, p. 371). - FARES to Assiii.tt Ist class 171.8 piastres
(Turkish), 2nd class 114.5 pias., 3rd class 571/2 pias. Payment at the station
may be avoided by previously buying vouchers at the agencies of either
Cook or Gaze, and exchanging them at the railway-station through the
dragoman of the agency. The trains start (1891) at 8.30 ann., 3 p.m. (for
Wastah and intermediate stations), and 7 p.m. (Tues. d: Frid. only). Those
who wish to go on at once by steamboat from Assid.t should take the morn-
ing train on the preceding day (see Introduction, p. xvi; and comp. Cook's or
Gaze's Tourists' Programme). The journey to Assiitt takes nominally 10 hrs.,
but the trains are generally late. A time-table showing the names of stations
in French and Arabic and giving distances in English miles is published
by Penasson of Alexandria and may be bought at the tieket-offiees. Trav-
ellers should provide themselves with a supply of meat, bread, and wine,
as no stoppage is made for dinner; eggs, bread, water (glass necessary) are
offered for sale at the statioas. Seats should at first be taken on the right
side for the sake of the view of the Pyramids; from Minyeh onwards the
left side is preferable, for the views of the Nile valley and Benihasan. -
The railway follows the course of the Nile pretty closely, and a broffieient
idea of the views from the carriage-windows may be obtained from the
account of the dhahabtyeh voyage below. The following is a list of the rail-
way-stations, nearly all of which are also steamer-stations, For descrip-
tions, see the text. Stations: Gizeh, Hau: amdiyeh; "M. (1/2 hr. from Cairo)

As soon as a favourable wind springs up (which, however, has
sometimes to be waited for for hours), the dhahabiyeh is cast off and
