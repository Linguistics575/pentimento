the king sits between Khnum and Anuke, and in that on the left
between Horus, lord of Bek, and the tow-headed Isis. The colours
of these pictures are well-preserved. The doors to the little sanctu-
ary, which bore the name Rauserma sehotep neteru, Le.'Ramses
offering to the gods', and the sanctuary itself are decorated with
various inscriptions. The king, staff in hand, is conducted, on the
right by Sati, on the left by Maket. On the wall to the right of the
door, Alluke1 mistress of Abu, offers her breast to the king, on the

left Isis, mistress of the land of Khent'=FA=v' Q, does the

same. Each calls herself his mother. Isis says that she bestows
11p011 him firmness along with her milk, so that he is said to have
been destined from his mother's breast to long life and mighty
deeds. [ Diodorus relates that Hephzestus appeared to the king's
father, announcing to him that the new-born babe would subdue
the whole world; and in the long inscription at Abydos Ramses is
said to have done great deeds while still a child.) On the side-
walls are scenes of homage to the king, with offerings piled up
upon tables bearing the cartouches of Ramses If. At the back is a
recess with three obscure figures, perhaps Ptah, Ammon, and
the king.

by two columns, about 30 ft. farther back. The pylon stands 11p0l1
a solid platform of masonry, LI ft. high and 95 ft. broad. The
portal, single instead of double as at Edfu and Philze, rises at the
back of this platform, surrounded by a low wall. At the top is the
winged sun-dise, and within and on the front (E.) and back (\V.)
the pylon is adorned with representations of the emperor sacri-

These sacrificial scenes are particularly interesting because
they make known to us not only some of the native gods, whose
names may be of importance for our knowledge of the native lan-
guage, but also the names of various native princes. such as the
