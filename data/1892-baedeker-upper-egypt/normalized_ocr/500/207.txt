IL The Northern Buildings.

A visit to the ruins to the N. of the, temple of Ammon need not
detain the traveller for any long time, unless his object be to decipher the
inscriptions and to gather from them philologieal or historical information.
They are in bad preservation; and the ICE, group, the temple of the war-
god Mentu, is in especial so completely ruined that it is difticult to rec0n-
struct its ground-plan, although in size it was originally as large as the
temple of Khunsu (p. b18). The traveller who has little time at his
disposal, or who must proceed with the steamer, may content himself
with a glance at the great N, girdle-wall of Nile-bricks, and at the gate
of the Ptolemies.

Beginning at the E. Pylon of Neetanebus (p. 141), we skirt the
girdle-wall of the great temple of Ammon, first to the N. and then
to the W. (left), until we see upon the right or N. side of our path
another girdle-wall of Nile-bricks. Within this lies a ruined Temple
(Pl. N), the axis of which lies S.W. and N.E. Like the N. pylon (see
below) it was dedicated to Mentu, the god of war, and is frequently
mentioned on demotie tiles (ostraea). Stretching NE. from this
building is an avenue of sphinses, which we reach on passing
through the door of a well-preserved pylon. Little now remains of
the temple, which dates from the time of Amenhotep IH. of the
18th Dyn. (who also erected two obelisks, as appears from a frag-
mentary inscription found here), though it was subsequently several
times enlarged between the reign of Ramses IV. and the epoch of
the Ptolemies, especially by Ptolemy IV. Philopator. Ptolemy II.
Philadelphus and Ptolemy III. Euergetes have recorded their names
here, and there is also a stone bearing the name of'Itamses'. The
earlier sculptures and architectural fragments are of great beauty;
and columns with Hathor capitals were also employed. The above-
mentioned Pylon (Pl. VII), the most N. part of the edifice now
remaining, was founded by Ptolemy II. At its foot is a list of
nomes, and higher up are numerous other inscriptions. The fellahiu
boys are shy of accompanying travellers to this spot towards evening,
as it is said to be haunted by an'Afrit or devil. It is called by the
natives L'iib et-'Abid, or gate ofthe uegro-slaves, probably on account
of some of the representations on its walls.

From the pylon we proceed to the SW., passing the remains of
a Ptolemaie temple CPI. O), of which the staircase is still to be
seen, to another Temple, consisting of six small chambers (Pl. k
to p). The second from the W. (Pl. l) contains the name of Ame-.
niritis, with that of her brother Sabako. The fine alabaster statue
of the queen, now in the museum at Gizeh, was found here. The
temple n shows the rare name of Nepherites (29th Dyu.); 0 dates
from the 22nd Dynasty. The names of Taharka, Osorkon 11., and
