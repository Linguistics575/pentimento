2 Route 1. MEDI'JM. From Cairo

poled out into the middle of the channel. The sailors accompany the
hoisting of the Iateen sail with a lusty chorus, and if one of the brisk
'Etesia' blows, which Herodotus mentions as driving boats up the Nile,
the long pointed craft flies quickly along, passing in rapid succession
the Khedive's palace and the barracks of East en-Nil, Iiasir el-'Ain,
the island of Redah with its palaces (on the E. bank), and the chi-
teaux of Gezireh and Gizeh (W. bank). Old Cairo lies on the E.
bank, and beyond it rise the Mohattam Mts., with the citadel and
Stabl'Antar, a ruined Arab fort on the S. end of one of their spurs;
on the W. is the group of pyramids at Gizeh. To the left (E. hank)
farther on, are the quarries and hamlets of Turah and Ma'sarah (see
Baedeker's Lower Egypt, p. 403). Opposite, on the W. bank, rise the
pyramids of Abusir, Salrliirah, and Dahshlir. Near the bank, to the
left, amidst a fine grove of palms, is a Coptic convent, and adjacent
is a gun-factory, begun by Isrnartl Pasha, but never finished.

The steamer remains for some hours at Bedrashén (rail. stat.,
p. 1), where asses are kept ready for a visit to Memphis, Salslsirah,
ete. (comp. Baedeker's Lower Egypt, R. d). Opposite, on the right
bank of the Nile, lies Helwim (ibid, p. 404), frequented as a water-
ing-place.'--On the bank at Kafr el-'Aytt (W. hank; rail. stat.),
where the steamer lays to for the night, are some ancient construe-
tions which may have belonged to the Canal of Manes. The un-
important pyramids of Lisht lie to the right, while the singularly
shaped pyramid of Médam (the so-called'False Pyramid') becomes
more and more prominent.

Rihkah, on the W. bank, is the starting-point of the excursion
to the Pyramid and Mugatabas of flfe" dttm (asses with poor saddles may
be procured at the village; 2 fr. and bakshish).

The PYRAMID AND Mss'ganss OF NADthr, the oldest monuments in the
world, deserve a visit, which may he accomplished from Bilghah in about
fl hrs. (railway travellers may perform it in about the same time from' the
el-Wastah station; comp. p. 1). Crossing the railway, we proceed on don-
key-hack in about II/a hr. to the pyramid, which rises close to the culti-
vated country on the soil of the desert, 11/231. to the N. of the village of
Miidiim. This appears to be the oldest of the local names handed down
to us, as it is met with on the mastahas of the early period of Snefru.

The Pyramid of 1Eidiun is so different from all the other structures of
the kind that it is called by the Arabs'El-Haram el-Eadddb', Or'the false
pyramid'. From a large heap of rubbish which covers its base, the
smooth and steep upper part of the structure rises in three different
stages at an angle of'Molly, and is still preserved to a height of 122 ft.
The tirst section is 69 ft., and the second 20% ft., while the third, now
almost entirely destroyed, was once 32 ft. in height. The outer walls con-
sist of admirably jointed and polished blocks of Mohattam stone. The
holes in One of the surfaces were made by Lepsius and Erhkam when
they examined the pyramid, the construction of which afforded them an
admirable clue to the principle upon which the others were built (Vol. 1.,
p. 350). The Pyramid of GIrldt" trn was never completed; the heap of debris
at its base consists of the material which once filled the angles of the
different sections, so as to give the pyramid a smooth surface. The pyra-
mid was pillaged as early as in the time of the 20th Dynasty. It Was
opened in 1881 by Maspero. who found a long corridor and a chamber
without sareophagus. Perhaps in this pyramid fme.frtt, the first king of the
