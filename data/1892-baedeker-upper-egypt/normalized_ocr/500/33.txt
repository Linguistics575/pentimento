WORKS ON EGYPT. EXT'

1? owling-pieees and ammunition (including Lefaucheux eartridges) may
be bought in Cairo, but not higher TIP, where only coarse gun-powder can
be obtained.

Letters. The letter-post, even in Upper Egypt, is both rapid and
punctual. From Cairo to Thebes letters take three days, being forwarded
to Assid.t by rail and thence by steamer. Passengers going beyond Cairo
should instruct ] the porter of the hotel to forward letters to some fixed
point. Cook's manager does this for Cook's taurists. The post goes on
even beyond Assufin.

IV. Works on Egypt.

A good selection of books is one of the necessities of the traveller
in Egypt. The steamer sometimes steams for an entire day without pass-
ing anything of special intereat; and the dhahabiyeh-traveller, when his
vessel is being slowly towed against an adverse wind, will gladly fall back
upon reading when he is tired of walking along the bank with a gun 011
the chance of a shot. A eonsiderable number of the chief books upon
Egypt have been mentioned in Trol. 1., pp.201,202; a few more are named
here; while other special works are referred to in the descriptions of some
of the principal monuments Ce.tr. pp.83,95,214,255, ete.). For authorities
on the Western Uases see pp. Md, 348.
