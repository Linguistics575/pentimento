all three divisions beneath the hips. Thence downwards the proportions
according to the second and third canons are the same; but those
of the upper part of the. body differ very essentially. The head is larger,
the chest recedes farther, the abdomen is higher. The contours be-
come in general fuller, and abandon that early beautiful simplicity and
tenderness of form, on which depended their imposing and specially
Egyptian character, in favour of an imperfect imitation of an nnassimi-
lated style of art. The proportion of the foot to the total length of the
body still remains, but the foot is no longer the fundamental unit of
measurement'.

The smaller CoIonnaded Rall (two rows of 4 and 2 central co-

sequence of their (the gods') goodwill towards them'. From this inscrip-
tion it appears that the garrison and ofOials of the Nubian district, which
included "mhns. undertook an adornment of the temple of the gods, to
whom they applied the Egyptian name Areeris (Harwar) and the Greek
name Apollo, in gratitude for some special mark of favour shown to them
by the gods.

Beside the door of the next room, the second in the (lirertion
of the Pronaos, is a seven-lined Calendar of Festivals. The hall
itself was built by Energetes II. The third room is the first that
shows Ptolemy VII. Philometor offering homage (eartonehe see
