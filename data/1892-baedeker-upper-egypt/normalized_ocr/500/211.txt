49nd year of his reign in honour of his father Tutmes I. The
skill shown in the working of the sandstone conglomerate used for
the statue is noteworthy. Pebbles as large as bullets occur in the
stone, yet the surface has a wonderfully smooth polish. The other
colossus, which belongs to Amenhotep IL, is made of white lime-
stone of a tine grain. The head is still in situ but the face is dis-
iignred. An adjoining Stele, with a much defaced inscription, re-
cords that Amenhotep II. led the Egyptian army as far as Niniveh.
On the E. side of PylonIX is an invocation of some length to Ammon
from the high-priests Roma and Roi, in the reign of Seti II. Ou
the outside of the E. wall between Pylons VIII and IX and on Py-
lon IX next to the small doorway, are inscriptions by Ameuhotep,
high priest of Thebes in the time of Ramses IN. (Neferkara), in
which he speaks of the restoration of a then ruined building that
had been erected by Usertesen T. (12th Dyn.). Close to Pylon VIII
is a small Chapel (Pl. q).

The next Pylon (P1. X) has c011apsed,1eaving fragments of walls
standing to the extreme right and left, separated by a saddle-shaped
depression. From the shattered inscriptions we learn that King
Iloms founded this pylon, though Ramses II. afterwards unjustly
placed his own name upon it and upon two granite statues no longer
extant. The names of Ramses IV. (Oak msf) and above it Ramses YI.
(Xefer hak ai) are also found, 011 the horizontal band 011 the N. side
of the pylon. King Horus and Ramses TI. are represented on the
W. side of the connecting wall. The ruins are most easily skirted
(m the W. side, and beyond them is a spacious Court, bounded on
the S. by the Last Pylon (Pl. XI). The wings of this huge edifice,
constructed ofhewn sandstone, have collapsed, but the central door-
way of granite is still standing. Four blocks of granite, 011 the right
of the doorway and facing the court, are decorated with a Relief,
representing with remarkable vivaeity King Horus approaching the
god "ith two 1ibation-vessels. Au inscription within the granite
portal informs us that this king, who ruled at the close of the 18th
Dym, built the pylon, using for that purpose some hewn stones
bearing the name of Amenhotep IV. Jihu-en-apsnh the strange
.smn-worshipper whom we met at Tell el-Amarnall (p. 23). From this
it has been concluded that a building erected at Karnak by the
schismatic was destroyed soon after his death. In front of the N.
side of the pylon are two headless limestone colossi. Ramses II.
placed his name upon these as well as upon the pylon; and some
priests of Ammon of the 21st Dyn. have also commemorated them-
selves upon the latter. - On the W. Wall, uniting Pylons X1 and
N is a representation, restored by Horus, of the Sacred Boat
of Ammon, which must have been carried in solemn procession
through the series of pylons 110w engaging our attention. The E.
Wall, which bears an inscription to the effect that King Ilorus 1Jort-.
quered Punt (Arabia), is interrupted by a building (Pl. S) in which
