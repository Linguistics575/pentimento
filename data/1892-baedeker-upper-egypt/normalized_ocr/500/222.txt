154 Route 12. TIIEBES. West Bank:

seated are carved out of a pebbly and quartzose sandstone-con-
glomerate, of a yellowish-brown colour and very diftieult to work.
The S. Colossus is in better preservation than the N. one, but
there is little difference between them in point of size. The dimen-.
sions of the former, in which the original form is more easily seen,
are as follows: height of the figure, 52 ft., height of the pedestal on
which the feet rest, 13 ft., height of the entire monument, 64 ft.
But when the figure was adorned with the long-since vanished
crown, the original height may have reached 69 ft. The legs from
the sole to the knee measure 191/2 ft., and each foot is 101/2 ft.
long:. The breadth of' the shoulders is 193/4 ft.; the middle finger
on one hand is 41/2 ft. long; and the arm from the tip of the
finger to the elbow measures 151/2 ft. The entire colossus, includ-
ing the throne and pedestal, weighs 1175 tons.
Both statues face E.S.E. and stand parallel to the course of the Nile,
though they are no longer perpendicular, as one inclines a little towards
the ether and both are canted slightly backwards. The S. colossus is a
little in front of the N. one, from which it is 22 paces distant. Both are
seamed with cracks, and such large fragments have fallen from them, that
one could imagine that an attempt has been made to destroy them by fire.
The Arabs call the N. colossus Tama, the S. one Shanta, and both to-
gether Salamdt, or'the greetings'. }
When the Nile is at its highest, its waters reach the soles of the feet
of the colossi and sometimes the upper surface of the pedestal on Which
they rest. As this pedestal is 13 ft. high and as the statues must have
been beyond the reach of inundations in the time of the Pharaohs, Lepsius
is correct in assuming from his observations of the nilometer at Semneh
(p. 342) that. the bed of the Nile at that point must have been considerably
raised within histurical times. He estimates the total rise at 25ft. In
winter, however, the traveller reaches the statues dry-shod. These colossi
were not always solitary monuments, remote from all other buildings. (m
the contrary they originally stood on either side of a gigantic Pylon, which
rose behind them and formed the entrance to a Memnonium, of which ex-
tensive relies still remain, though for the most part covered with earth.
This temple, now completely annihilated, was founded by Amenhotep ITL,
who is represented by the colossi. Neither this monarch nor his statues
have any connection whatever with the Greek Memnon, who was the son
of Bus (the dawn) and Tithonus, became one of the allies of Priam, and
slew Antilochus, the brave son of Nestor, for which he was himself slain
by Achilles. Homer mentions this Memnon twice in the Odyssey:
'For he thought in his mind of the likeness of the noble Antiloehus'
'Whom the lurdly son of the brightening (lawn slew'.

And of Neopto1emds, the son of Achilles, it is said:
'No one handsomer than he have I seen, next to the godlike Memnon'.

This Memnnn was an Asiatiehero, who is said also to have built the
fortresses of Susa and Eebatana. When the Greeks became acquainted with
the Nile valley and its monuments, they imagined that they had found
sumptuous buildings of the Homeric hero in the commemorative monu-
ments named'mennu' by the Egyptians (p. 55). The colossi before us
were also called'mennu' by the inhabitants of Thebes, and soon came to
be described by the Ilellenes as statues of Memnon, though the Egyptians
even to a late period knew that they represented Amenhotey ITL, a Icing
of the 18th Dynasty. Pausanias was informed of this fact, and Greek in-
scriptions on the legs of the statues also mention it. When it afterwards



f That at least is the present name. Lepsius states that they were
named in his time /janamdt, or the'idols', which seems more in keeping
with Arab conceptions.
