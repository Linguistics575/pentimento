mighty prince both in war and peace, was a pious worshipper ofAmmon,
whose name, indeed, forms part of his own (Amen-hotep). Amenhutep IV.,
on the other hand, turned his hack on his father's religion and on the in-
creasingly spiritual conception of Ammon (the'Hidden One') and the other
ancient gods. discarded his name'Peace of Ammon', became exclusively
a snn-Worshipper, and named himself Khu-en-aten, i.e.'Refleetion of the
Sun's Dise'. It is an interesting but doubtful question whetherAmenho-
phis IV., in his r6te of reformer, intended to resuscitate, as'a patriotic
restorer of the 01d eult', the simple san-worship from which the religion
of the Egyptians hail originally taken its rise; or whether he was moved
hy the Semitic iufluenees, which are so noticeable all over the country
after the expulsion of the Hyksus, to become an adorer of the orh ofday
and to introduce a religious ceremonial that recalled the practices of the
Asiatic courts rather than the more dignified usages of the'Suhlime Porte'
of Egypt. Portraits of historical personages often cast a clearer light on
their character than piles of written documents, and the numerous re-
presentations of Amenhotep IV. encuuntered in these tombs show that he
was a sickly man, a fanatic, and an enthusiast. [ The purtrait-statue of
him in the Louvre suggests similar conclusions. ] He also, as the in-
scriptions inform us, stood under the influence of his mother, who was
not of royal birth and seems to have encouraged hee son's tendency to
prefer the old popular religion to the elaborately developed creed of the
priests. His work was distinctly reactionary and Cunld not long survive
him. Almost everywhere we see his successors scratching out his name as
a sign of their disapproval and contempt. Where it still stands intact we
may cenclude that it was overlooked. The fact that the portrait-like
reliefs of men in these tombs, as well as the horses and buildings, appear
more true to nature than in any other Egyptian monument may be due
to the greater liberty of divergence from the hieratie canon allowed in a
reign which was so unfavourable to the priestly dogmas. These reliefs
excited the special admiration of the Greeks. A Hellene who visited them
inscribed his name as admiring the art of the priestly stone-cutters
(téyym Sauiiaitwv to }: tape };? .aozépwvi. Besides the palaces and tombs
of Tell el-Amarnah, Khu-en aten also built a large Benben or temple at
Thebes, the blocks of which We~e used for the pylon of King Horus. He
also erected a temple in Heliopolis, the remains of which are still extant,
and probably another in Memphis. He is himself depicted on a pylon in
Soleb (Nubia).

Quite recently a new light has fallen on the history of Amcnhotep IV.
and his predecessor through the discovery of several hundred tablets with
cuneiform inscriptions in the large Temple, OI? rather Palace, of Tell el-
Amarnah -'r, which narrate the intercourse of the Kings of Babylon with
Amenhotep III. and Amenhutep IV. To the former Ring Dushratta of Ni-
tanui gave his daughter Tadukhepa in marriage; and her dowry is stated
on one of the tablets. Other tablets contain letters from Pale, tine and
Syrian vassals to the King of Egypt, and diplomatic notes from King
Burnabnriash to Amenhotep 1V., concluding a treaty of Peace and asking
for the hand of his daughter. Most of the tablets are now in the Asiatic
Museum at Berlin, but many are in the British pluseurn and a few
at Gizeh.

N. Group. The tombs in each group are marked with red
numbers, running from N. to S. Most of the tombs are entered
from a small fore-court, and the doorways of many are adorned
with concave cornices. The door leads into an oblong apartment,
communicating with a wide sepulchral chapel, with a small burial-
recess in the background. The ornamentation of the ceiling is

very varied. Columns with bud-capitals occur frequently, some

, Some authorities believe that these tablets Were found in the tomb
of Amenhotep IV. (see above).
