that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the
Ethiopians. And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and
came to Jerusalem'. Verse 9 is the same as the above passage
from Kings. - The eenquered people named in the reprresen-
tation are the Amu, Kenus (Nubians), Menti, and Sakti (Asiatiesl.

Champo? lion, the great deeipherer of hieroglyphies, was the
first to perceive that the names in the inscription belonged to
the above-mentioned'fenced cities', and that Sheshenk, called
by the Greeks Sesonehis, was identical with the Shishak of the
Bible. The third name in the third row from the top, attracted
his attention especially; it reads'Judah (Jude) Malek', and may
be translated king of Judah. The heads of the busts above the
name-labels, with their characteristic Semitic features, are suf-
ficient by themselves to prove that only places could be here
signified that were inhabited by peoples related to the Jews. Hf
the 120 11ame-labelg only a few can be identified with certainty
with otherwise known names of places in Pale=tiue, such as
Rabbath (last ring of the first row), Taanach, Shunem, Rehab,
Hapharai'm, Adullam, Nahanahn, Gibenn, Iteth-Horon, Kede-
moth, Ajalon (in the second row). Several symbols have re-
cently been obliterated by the Whitewash used to preserve the
wall, and Some of the name-labels have also been deetroyed.

the inseriptiomz, which are couched in the usual emphatic style, give nu
farther information a", to the campaign.

We return to the peristyle court and proceed to the Second Pylon
(P1. Ir). The left or N. side has fallen and the right side is sadly
damaged. The eolossi of Ramses IL, which guarded the projecting
entrance, have already been mentioned on p. 119. But neither
Ramses 11., as appearances might suggest, nor even his father Seti I.
built this pylon, but the predecessor and father of the latter,
Ramses 1., who also planned the hypestyle hall, afterwards adorned
by Seti I. and Itamses tho Great. The eartouehes of Ramses II.
frequently occur sunk instead of being embossed, because they have
been placed on spots previously occupied by the older cartourhes
of Ramses T. or Seti I. The same is the case 011 the back of the
2i. pylon, whereas on the back of the S. pylon, which was erected
by Ramses 11., his name appears in genuine has -relief. In the
doorway (P1. c), where the cartom-hes of Ramses I., Seti I., and
Ramses 11. are found, an intervening door was erectedby Ptolemy TH.

their joint-reign 1i0-165 Ill.), The lintel and upper parts of
this latter doorway are wanting, but the jambs are in good pre-
servation, with expressions of homage to Ammon and his fellow-
gods. On the inner side (to the left) of the earlier doorway appears
Ramses II. kneeling before Amman and receiving the symbol of
kingship. Behind him stands the goddess Math, and Khunsu, ll ith
the moon's disc on his bead, conducts Ptolemy VII. Philometor to
behold the god Ammon. Probably the representation is a restoration
by Philometor of an older work on the same spot.
