20 Route J, DER 4is-NhIiTILTIrf. From Cairo

Those who are interested in Christian antiquities should follow
the pl. bank from Shékh'AbL1eh towards the S.f In about 3/4111'.,
after passing some ruins of a late epoch, we reach the Dér Abu
Hennis (Convent of St. John), called also simply ed-IW. In the
ilays of the Mameluke persecutions the Christians are said to have
lived here and at Shékh'Abideh in comparative security, as the
Arabs believed that no Mohammedan could exist here on account
of the evil spirits. At present there are more fellahin here than
Copts. There is little to be seen at ed-Dir. The crypt, in which
divine service is held, is said to date from the time of the Em-
press llelena. By ascending the hill at the hack of the houses, we
reach, to the left of the ravine, some cave-like quarries, whiuh
were fitted up as Christian chapels and were embellished at an early
date with sculptures. The main chamber contains paintings of saints
and scenes from the New Testament, but those in one of the side
chapels (Raising of Lazarus, Wedding at Cana, etc.) are better.
To judge from their style these interesting pictures are not earlier
than the 6th cent. A.D. Among the Coptic monks who resided here
(from the 4th cent. onwards) were Victor and his brother Kolnthus,
Silvanus, and Macarius; and the tombs of the last two are still
shown. The adjoining quarry was begun by Amenhotep Ill.

About% hr. beyond Ihir Abu Bennis we reach Diir en-Nakhleh,
the'convent of the date-palms'. To reach the *Tomb with the re--
presentation of the transportation ofa Colossus, we cross the dry
water-course beyond the houses, ascend the hill on the left side,
and near the top reach a path on which, a little to the right, the
grave is situated. Guides may be procured for a few paras. Trav-
ellers descending the river should visit the tomb from Bcrsheh,
above which towers the rocky Gebcl Shtkh Sa'id [ with a shekh's
tomb ], in which the tomb in question is hollowed out. The whole
district belonged to the nome of Un or IIerm0polis. The represen-
tation in this tomb is highly interesting as being the only one that
gives us an idea of the processes used by the Egyptians in moving
their p, olossal statues.

The Arabs thought it impossible that were human strength could
move such huge burdens, and hence a legend grew up among them that
the subjects of the Pharaohs were giants, Who knew how to move masses
of rock with their magical staves. Even the men of the present day, at
whose command stand forces of which the ancient Egyptians never even
dreamed, are astounded at their achievements in this direction and feel
inclined to solve the problem by ascribing to them the use of technical
aids, which we have no evidence that they possessed. The principles of
the pulley and the lever seem to have been unknown to them; and o -
staeles, which seem to us to demand imperatively the application of

steam and machinery, were overcome by enormous multiplication of sheer
human power.

+ The dhahabiyeh should he sent on to Bersheh, in order to allow
time for a visit to the ictui-e of the transportation of an Egyptian statue
(see above). About k--hrs. are necessary to see comfortably all the
points on this route.
