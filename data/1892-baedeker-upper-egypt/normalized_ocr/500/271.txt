also Seti I. with filial piety thought of his father Ramses L, the de-.

sculptures on a false door, which is reached by
passing through the left entrance door from the
colonnade 011 the last fatade, and crossing the hall OPI CD

we learn that Seti I. dedicated this portion of his
Memnonium to the memory of his father. His son 9:" < E > =s=za
did for him what he had done for his father, while later kings,
Merenptah, Siptah, and Ramses 111., had their names carved in
various places, but do not seem to have either restored or enlarged
the Memnonium. The traveller should especially notice the extra-
ordinary beauty and purity in style of the inscriptions and paint-
ings. The existing remains of the temple of Iiurnah may be divided
into four parts: l, the colonnade on the front of the temple facing
the E.; 2, 3 and 4, the three series of halls, chambers, and closets
separated by partition-walls, one in the centre, one on the left, and
one on the right.

The CoIonnade (P1. A) originally displayed 10 fine columns
with papyrus-bud capitals, excellent specimens of this order, but
of these one on the S. side (left) has been destroyed. In its
inner wall, the eastern IT all of the temple, are three doors (Pl. a,
b, e), which lead into the three series of rooms mentioned above,
and the sculpture on it is of great interest, representing 12 pairs
of divinities, each a god and a goddess, eight of which may cer-
tainly be taken to represent branches of the Nile forming the Delta.
On their heads they carry well-known geographical symbols. "
each pair it is said that they come in order to bring gifts to Pharaoh.
The dedicatory inscription reads:'The saying of the gods and the
goddesses of the north to their son etc., Ramses II. We come to
thee, our arms are laden with choice goods and produce. We ga-
thered for thee all good things from all that the earth brings forth,
to place the temple of thy father in a festival ofjoy... Thou hast
made good that which had fallen, and built up thy father's house,
in that thou bringest it to an end with works of eternal standing.
