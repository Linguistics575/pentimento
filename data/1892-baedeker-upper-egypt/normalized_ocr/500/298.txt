wa/ds Tutmes 111. erased in many places the name of his obnox-

brother Tutmes 11. The great monarchs of the 19th Dyn., Seti 1.
and Ramses 11., Merenptah, son of the latter, Ramses 111., Pinozem,

of the 25th Dyn., Psammetihh H. and Nitocris of the 26th Dyn.,
Ptolemy IX. Euergetes II. and his wife Cleopatra, and Ptolemy X.
Lathyrus, all contributed by works of restoration to prevent the
building which had been completed under Hatasn, from falling
into decay. Both the style, and the inscriptions tell us that DÃ©r el-.
bahri is to be considered completely a work of the beginning of the
New Empire. The size and simplicity of its parts, and especially
the polygonal columns are a sign to those who are familiar with
the development of Egyptian architecture, that the Ilyksos period
must be considered to have been a time of stagnation in Egyptian
art, and that exactly the same forms and arrangements of columns
were common to the architects of the l12th and to those of the
18th Dynasties. 1n Thebes, and not least at Der el-bahri, the oh-
server is tempted to regard the New Empire as an immediate con-
tinuation of the C) ld, although between them lies a period of tive
hundred years.

The plan of this terrace-temple is remarkable, and cannot be
compared with any other in Egypt. The arrangement in four
terraces rising from the level ground up the steep side of the Li-
byan mountains is quite unique. The stages were cut out of the
E. slope of the mountain, and support was given to the outer and
inner walls by means of blocks of the finest sandstone. At the S.
end of the terraces we can best see the care taken to support the
earth-works. The outer wall consists here of finely polished blocks
of limestone with simple but effective ornamentation. Broad pi-
lasters, but only 3 in, deep, placed some distance apart, project
from the wall with which they are connected. Above each is
enthroned a gigantic hawk with the crown of Upper and Lower
Egypt, standing upon an Uraeus-serpent, and above it is the symbol
of life supported by an Urams-serpent.

A long Avenue of Sphinxes, probably beginning with a pylon,
near the entrance to the tomb of Petamenap (p. 222) led up to the
series of terraces, the successive stages being reached by steps
placed in the middle.

The First Terrace (beginning from below) is almost entirely
destroyed, but we can make out the pathway which led from the
bottom to the top, and divided the whole into two equal parts. Be-
low the Second Terrace (Mariette's Terrasse de l'Est) are the ruins
of a Hall, supported by columns of 16 sides, which in this form
were used only under the 17th and 19th Dynasties. The pressure
of the earth is sustained by a lofty inner wall on which are some
well preserved inscriptions, and representations of ships, soldiers
