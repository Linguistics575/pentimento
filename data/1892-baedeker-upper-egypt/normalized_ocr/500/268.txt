196 Route 18. THEBES. West Bank:

the tomb of Osiris, of the righteous prophet of Ammon, Neferhotepl
After an introduction, wishing peace to the dead, and glorifying the
sun-god, it continues literally as follows:'Celehrate the great day, o
prophet. Well is to thee, fragrant resin and ointments are laid before
thee. Here are wreaths and flowers for the waist and shoulders of thy
sister, who is pleasant to thine heart, as she rests beside thee. Let us
then sing and strike the harp in thy presence. Leave all cares behind
and think of the joys, until the day of the voyage comes when man casts
anchor on the land which delights in silence'.

Near this, is the once splendid tomb of another Neferhotep, over-
seer of the cattle of Ammon, but now in ruins and used as a maga-
zine by the keeper of the Gizeh museum. There may also be visited
in the neighbourhood the tombs of KherM, of the time of Amen-
hotep 111., of Moi, and of an offieial in charge of the stables of
Amenhotep IL, the inner room of which is the resting place of
Mahu, a writer of the treasury in the time of Ramses II.

If the dhahahtreh is lying at Luxor, the small boat should be ordered
to wait with some men on the left bank of the river at the E. end of
the island.

19. The Mortuary Temple of Seti I. at Kurnah.

Second Day on the W. bank: 1. Temple of Furnah; 2. Tombs of the
Kings (Bibitn erofuNkr, 3. Necropolis of el-Asasif and of Drah Atnf1-
Neggah; k. Der el-bahri.

To the W. bank as on the previous day, see p. 152. From the
landing-place of the ferry we ride across the fields in a northerly
direction and in 3/4 hr. reach the handsome *Temple, the front of
which with its columns is visible at a considerable distance. The
original building (see the annexed plan) was of smaller dimensions
than the Ramesseum and Medinet Habu, its complete length being
518 ft., and of this only the actual sanctuary with its halls and
chambers, 153 ft. in depth remain, while there are only scanty
remains to Provo the former existence of two Courts and the Pylons
which enclosed them. The Sphinxes which were placed like guar-
dians to the right and left of the door leading into the first Court
on the inside, are half 00vered with earth. They were placed there
by Setil., and on the bases were inscribed the names of all the
nations which he had conquered. Of all the buildings in the Neero-
polis of Thebes, this one most reminds us ofthe Memnonium ofAbydos
(p. 54), and a closer inspection of the style of inscriptions and re-
presentations will both bring out and explain their similarity, for
the temple of Iiurnah was founded by Seti 1., the builder of Abydos,
and both the sanctuaries were restored and completed by Ramses 11.
They both served the same purpose' as a place where the manes of
the founder might be remembered, and offerings made. At Abydos
it is true that throughout attention was paid to the pilgrims to
Osiris, while here it is the gods of Thebes that were promi-
nent, and this was the centre of the festival of the mountain valley,
