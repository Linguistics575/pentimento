ink in Demutic, Greek, or Coptic characters. A roll containing poems by
Homer was also discovered here.

By far the most interesting object on the island is the *Nilo..
meter, on the W. side facing Assutn, known to the Arabs as
Mitayas. The learned court-astronomer of the Khedive, Mahmtd
Bey, restored this well-preserved monument to use in 1870. Strabo
gives the following excellent description, which is interesting to
compare with the monument as it now exists.'The Nilometer is a
well built of regular hewn stones, on the bank of the Nile, in which
is recorded the rise of the stream, not only the maximum bat also
the minimum and average rise, for the water in the well rises and
falls with the stream. 011 the side of the well are marks, measur-
ing the complete rise of the water and all the other degrees of its
rising. These are observed and published for general information'.
Readers are referred to our account of the Mikyas at Cairo (Vol. I.,
p. 319 ]. The Nilometer at Elephantine consists of a narrow roof1ess
chamber, connected with the stream, and is reached by 52 steps in
6 flights. The lowest landing is reckoned as 4 Arabian ells or about
7 ft. above the lowest water level (the dir'a or Arabian ell being
equal to 54 centimétres or about 211/3 inches). Above that point
13 ells are marked, so that the highest point marked is 30ft.
(17 Arab. ells) above the minimum water-level. Each ell is divided
on the side of the well into 6 parts and'gil kirat. The 13 old Egyp-
tian ells, each divided into 7 spans and'23 fingers, have a total
length of 6,395 métres (about 20 ft), from whieh Mahmtld Bey
obtained 53 centimMres as the equivalent for an ell instead of
the previously accepted 5213 centimetres. The water-level flue-
tnates actually between the top of the first ell and the seventeenth,
Le. has a range at Assutn of 16 ells of 5-1 centimétres each. The
old and new marks are placed on every third step. From the sur--
face of the water upwards are il marks, of which, however, only
the half are neeessary, as the Nile no longer rises higher.

Close beside the river, farther to the N., lies a massive Roman
Structure, built of hewn blocks from earlier edifiees. Many of
these blocks are covered with inscriptions of different dates, in-
cluding fragmentary lists of offerings and festival calendars and
a portion of a Nilometer. The rock-inscriptions close to the stream
should also be noticed. They include inscriptions by Neferkara
(Pepi), Unas, Antef aa, with one by Amenemha on the other side.

The higher parts of the island command a fine *View of the
black and brown, rough and smooth rocks of the cataract, among
which the Nile, split up into many small branches, sometimes
dashes in foaming energy, sometimes flows in unrutfled calmness.
