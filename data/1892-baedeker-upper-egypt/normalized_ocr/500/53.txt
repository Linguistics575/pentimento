to Assi't. BENISUEF. f. Route. 5

Visitors to the Faytun may regain el-Wastah on the following day at
10.15 a.m. or at 4.16 p.m., by leaving Nedinet el-Faytun at 9 aan. or
2.53 p.m. An extra day allows a visit to the Labyrinth and the Pyramid
of Hawiirah (p. 39). In this case the dhahabiyeh should not be sent on in ad-
vance, but should be ordered to await the travel1er's return .--The pyra-
mid and tombs of Me" diim may also be visited from el-Wastah (see 11.2).

A small canal, beginning near the village of Zciwiyeh (W. bank),

runs out of the Nile into the Balm Yteaf (p. 28).

Farther up, in the latitude of Altmis el-Medineh and Benisuéf, there
seems to have been another deep channel connecting the [ river with the
Bahi- Yrtsuf. These four channels enclosed an inland which has been ideu-
titiéd with the Heracleopolitan Nome, unanimously described hy Greek au-
thorities as an island. Straho, who visited it on his way to the Faythn,
afterleaving the nome of Aphroditopolis, calls it'a large island', and re-
lates that in the city of 1ierae1eopo1is the ichneumon was worshipped,
the deadliest foe of the crocodile, held sacred in the neighbouring nome
of Arsinoii; for, he tells us, it crawls down the throat of the sleeping
monster and devours its entrails. The large mounds of debris at Alpttis el-
Ifedineh, the Umm cl-Kimdm ('mother of rubbish-heaps') of the Arabs, have
been identified with Hevaeleopo1is; they lie 11 M. to the w. (inland) of
Benisuét'. The old name of the town was Khinensu, from which A (mds is
derived through the Coptic Hues. The ram-horned god Horshaf, the
prince of terrors, was also worshipped here. A few columns still stand,
here, and other monuments may be buried under the debris. Systematic
excavations are to he undertaken. At piesent Altmts need scarcely be
visited except by those who approach the Fay1hn from Banisuéf.

On the W. bank the mountains recede a little from the Nile,
but on the E. bank their steep and lofty spurs frequently extend
down to the bank in rising picturesque forms. None of the Nile-.
villages before Beuisuéf need be mentioned. On the E. bank stands
the 00ptie convent of Mar Antonia, (see p. 4). About 2M. inland
(right) from Ztttn (W. bank) lies the hamlet of Bash (rail. stat.,
p. o, which is inhabited by Copts and thus has some interest for
those who wish to study these direct descendants of the ancient
Egyptians in a community of some size.

Benisuef, on the W. bank, the first plate in Upper Egypt (rail.
stat., p. 1; stat., l" M. from the Nile), is a town of 10,000 inhab.,
pleasantly situated between the railway and the river. It contains
a post and telegraph office and is the capital of a province of the
same name, which contains 169 villages and about 920,000 inhabi-
tants. To the left of the rail. station is the Mudiriyeh, or residence
of the mudir or governor. The houses or rather huts of this provin-
cial capital are, however, constructed merely of Nile mud. The linen-
manufacture for which this place was celebrated in the middle ages
has greatly declined, but there are several sugar-plantations and a
small bazaar. To the left of the railway is a fine grove of palms.

A road which was much frequented before the completion of the rail-
way, leads from Benituéf into the Faydm (p. 34), and travellers with a
tent and plenty of time might still hire camels, asses, or horses here and
proceed to Medinet el-Faygm viit el-Lahan ('gate of the Faytun0, where the
Bahr Yt" 1sr1f enters the Faytun, and Hawdrah. By using the railway for the
retqrp-journey and giving up Birket el-1iuriin, this excursion can be made
in 3-4 days. _

Another road, traversing the midi Baydd, which opens near the vil-
Page of Baydd, on the E. bank of the Nile, opposite Benisuéf, leads through
