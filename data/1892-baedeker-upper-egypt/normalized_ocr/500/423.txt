daughter of the Kheta prime, followed by her father. Since her
name (Ra-ma-ttttrm/er-u) is enclosed in a royal cartouche, it is
probable that she became the legal wife of Ramses. Friendly rela-
tions with the Kheta prince khetasar were established in the 21st
year of the king's reign by the peave mentioned at p. 142. Beside
it is a small tablet of the general Amenhi, with the prince Seti, the
king's mother Tun, and the princess Bant-rmtu. Farther back (to-
wards the E.) is another large stele, with the winged stur-disp, be-
neath which Ramses the Great is shewn before Ammon with tho
double crown, before Harmachis (Her alchuti, Horus of the two

horizons), and before Horus7 lord OSU/ci? 3iis [ 9.5, the great

god. In the following 23-line inscription the king, who spreads
abroad fear and terror, annihilated the land of Kush, and subdued
the land of Iiheta, is compared to the gods Horus, Mentu, and Seth.

Immediately to the left of this passage a rock-chamber was dis-
covered in 1874 by a party of travellers including Miss Amelia
B. Edwards, the well-known writer, who has described it in her
interesting Thousand Miles up the Nile. The first chamber, 25 ft.
deep, is adjoined by another rock-cave, 15 ft. deep and 21 ft.
broad. This little Temple was dedicated by Ramses to Thoth and
Harmachis, the former of whom is here called lord of Khmunu
(lIermopolis Magna) in Amonhari (perhaps a name for Abu-Sim-
bel). Both gods are represented in golden coloured dhahahiyehs,
before which the king stands worshipping (to the left the boat of
Thoth, to the right that of Ammon-Ra). The name of Usertesen H.

E) C2 Ra-ua-lc/ttper (12th Dyn.), a king celebrated in Nubia,

is also found here. The theory that this was the library of the king,
of which Thoth was president, is unfounded. Still farther t0 the left
are a number of steles incised in the rock, some of which are diffi-.
cult to reach. One of them dates from Seti II. The farthest to the
left is a double stele of the 38th year of Ramses H., inscribed by a
prince of linsh named Setau.

bank, is a small rock-temple, dating from the reign of King llorus
(1101' em heb), the last king of the 16th Dynasty. This temple, which
faces the W., was once- used as a Christian church; a ilgure oi'Christ
may be seen on the ceiling and one of St. George on the wall of the
main chamber. The structure is also sometimes called the Temple
of Gebcl Addeh (Champnllion), and sometimes the Temple of Abu-.
huduh (Prokesch), after a village lying: farther to the S. The main
chamber (25 ft. square, 10 ft. high) is mljoinetl on each side (N. and
