station also there is a block of granite with the name ofTutmes m.,
possibly dating from a temple at Syene, on which Khnum, lordofKebu

libs (i, l) ly 2, within Abu (Elephantiue) is named. Several

attractive houses, one belonging to a wealthy Jew, form a kind of
suburb here.

To the left of the road ties the small TEMPLE, founded by Pto-
lemy Ill. Euergetes and adorned by Ptolemy IV. Philopator, but
never entirely completed. On the left of the Fucude is Euergetes I.
and his wife Bereniee II., before Isis in Sun (Syeue). Isis is named
conductress of the, soldiers, because the frontier-town and its neigh-
bourhood were strongly garrisoned from very early times as well as
under the Romans. (Under the Romans the Cohors Quinta Sueuerr..
sium was stationed at Contra Syene, the Cohors Sexta Saginarum in
the Castro Lapidapiorurn, on the E. bank to the S. of Syene, the
Cohors Prima Felix Thoodosiana on Elephantine, and the Legio
Prime Maximiana on Phila.) Next appears Ptulmis, son of Euer- t"
getes, otherwise Philopator, before lihnum, Sati, and Anuke, who
each wears his special head-dress. On the right side of the facade is
Euergetes 1., before Sebek and Hathor, and offering incense before
Osiris Unnofer (the good), Isis, and the child Horus.

0n the inner sides of the two doors leading to the anteehamber
with its two square columns, and on the inner side of the door to
the adytum, are inscribed stirring Hymns to Isis-Sothis, to whom
apparently the little temple was dedicated. To the left, on the lat-
ter door, are e.y. the words:'Thou hurlest forth [ sati) the Nile,
that he may fertilize the land in thy name of Sothis, thou em-
bracest (ank) the fields to make them fertile in thy name of Ankht.
All beings on earth exist through thee, through thy name of Ankht
('the living')..

Unusually thick pillars in the first and largest chamber of the
temple support flat Creek abaci, upon which rests a broad but flat
architrave. Completed inscriptions are to be found only on the I
partition-wall between the sanctuary and the preceding hall, on the l
entrance door, and at a few points on the inner walls.

Near the temple is a rock-inscription of the time of Khu-eu-aten. To
the left appears the sculptor Men, before a sitting flgure ofAmenhotep III.
perhaps carved by himself, to the right is a son ot'chn named Bek, mak-

ing an olTering. Bek is also a master-sculptor of the sun, whose beams
radiate in the form ofhands. The cartouches of Khu-eu-aten are defaced.

'2. THE ARAB CEMETERIES.

A brief ride brings us to an immense number of Arab graves,
lying in the midst of the desert, each marked by a rectangle of
unhewn stones, and a slab bearing, an engraved inscription. Many
i are covered with a pall of yellow sand. The earliest of the hundreds
t of Epitaphs exhibit the venerable (Juflc'character and date mostly I
l from the Uth and 10th cent. A.D. A few are older and many are
