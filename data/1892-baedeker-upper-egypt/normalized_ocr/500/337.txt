imposing appearance; but the nearer we approach the temple, the
more clearly we perceive that the stream has already washed away
the pylons and colonnade, and that in no long time the whole of
the handsome building will be undermined, like the temple of Jislu
ei-Kebir (p. 48). Large fragments of the building are even now to
be seen sunk beneath the stream, near its edge. On one of these is
the dedication inscription, recording that the building had been
founded as'a work to endure for eternity'. The high-lying ruins
of K6m Ombo are especially picturesque by the light of the
full moon.

A single glance is enough to reveal to the practised eye that a
vomparatbrely late monument lies before the traveller. Ptolemy VII.
Philometor founded the temple:

(reiiitemml Ast en ttetera pir

ptuh kheper sotcp en amen ar ma ra, Epiphanes son of the gods,
begotten by Ptah, chosen by Ammon, making the truth of Ita.
Euergetes 11., Ptolemy XIII. Neos Dionysus, his wife Cleopatra v.,
and at a later date Tiberius enlarged the building. It belonged to

a
the Egyptian town [ W ] q q Nubi (Coptic Mbt0, called by the

Greeks Ombos, as capital of the district Ombites, which formerly
was part of the Nubian nomos, whi1e from the Egyptian Nubi they
formed the names Unbi-Ombi and Omboi ("09300.

It would be a great error to dispute, in face of the present building,
the existence of an earlier temple on this site. A gateway which existed
on the E. side of the girdle-wall down to 1870 showed on its jambs the
Iigure of Tutmes m., builder of the temple, which was named Pa Sebek
(temple of the erroeodile-headed Sehek) in the inscription of Ramaka be-
neath. According to Champollion the door-posts were provided hy one
of the Ptolemies with a new lintel; the old lintel, dating from Tutmes IU.,
was found on the river-bank in 1883 by Maspero, along with a door-post
bearing the name of Amenhotep 1., and a block of stone with the car-
touehe of Ramses the Great. The old temple of Tutmes III. probably faced
the east.

Corresponding ttfthe double division of this temple, two different
triads were especially worshipped within it. The chief of the first
was Sebek-lla with the crocodile-head, along with whom were Ha-
thor and Khunsu; at the head of the second was Har-war. the elder
Horus (Arueris'), with whom were associated Tasentnefert (the good
sister) and her son Pinebtati, lord of both lands. The entire left
halt' of the temple was dedicated to the triad of Arueris, the right
half to that of Sebek. The coins of Onibos display a warrior, with
a Iauciy in one hand and a crocodile in the other; figures which re-
present Horus and Sebek in the Roman style. The'memory of the
worship of the two divine brothers in the same temple seems to have
lingered in the following legend, related to the writer by a boat-
man at Kem Ombo.

'Uhce upnn a time two brothers reigned as princes of Ombo. One
was wicked and strong, the other was good. The latter, who loved his
