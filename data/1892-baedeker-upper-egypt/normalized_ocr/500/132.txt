of that name, crosses our route, and proceeds in windings to the Ited
Sea. The last station is Abtt-Greiah, comprising several buildings, the
largest of which, (K) paces long and k7 paces wide, contains the remains
of rooms. Another building seems to have been a reservoir for rain water.
--10th Day. Arrival at the ruins of the old temple of Berenike.

The town of Berenike (Berem'ce), situated in the same latitude as
Assuiin, was founded in 3.0. 275 by Ptolemy Philadelphus, who revived
the commerce of the Red Sea by the establishment of several new ports.
The town, which was named by Ptolemy after his mother, survived for
400 or 500 years. The ruins, still extant, surround the Temple which
faces the E.N.E. In front is a fore-court r381/2 ft. in width and 12 ft. in
depth, which was adjoined by the temple proper (inner length 31 ft.),
comprising two rows of apartments. The central apartment, with some-
what sloping sides, seems to have been the main one, as its right and
left walls and also the outside of the eutranee-wall (t0 the left) bear
traces of paintings, representing a king sacrifieing to various deities. The
name of the Emp. Tiberius, sacrificing to the god Khem, appears here.
The representation on the left outside-wall shows an emperor (probably
Hadrian) appearing before a goddess, who seems to be, from the legend,

the tutelary deity of the green uaz emerald mine. To the left

of this main apartment is a covered corridor, with a window, and ad-
jacent is a staircase leading to the roof. The temple was cleared from
rubbish in 1873 by Purdy Pasha, an American in the Egyptian service.

The Emerald Mines, which were visited last century by Bruce (1763
-73) and in this century by Cailliaud (181518), Belzoni, and Beeches,
were worked by the Arabs, according to Makrizi, down to the year'760 of
the Hegira (1370 A.D.), after Which they were abandoned. Mohammed
'Ali made an unavailing attempt to reopen them. They lie partly in the
dei Saks? and partly on the Gebel Zabcirah, 14 M. to the ICE. They are
best Visited from Contra Apollinopolis, but may, like Berenike, be ap-
proached by following the coast of the Arabian Gulf from Iioytr. The
first route diverges from the road to Berenike at Phalacro. Between
Contra~Edfu and the mines are three old stations. At the first of these
is the name of a sun-worshipping king of the 18th Dynasty. Close to the
second, 13 hrs. from the Nile, is a temple hewn in the rock, the Temple
of Iledfsiyeh (so called atter the place of that name on the Nile; see p. 253),
which Seti I. dedicated to Amman. No precious stones are now fouwl
in the emerald mines. To the S. of the Gebel Zubiirah lies the village of
Sake't, with the huts of miners and a rnck-hewn temple. with a few Greek
inscriptions. Among these is a reference to Serapis and the Isis of Senskis.
