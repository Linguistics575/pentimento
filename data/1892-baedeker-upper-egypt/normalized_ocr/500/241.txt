Semitic. All of them have pointed beards, and several have long
ringleted hair in fillets; while those of higher rank wear long robes and
short cloaks of a tine-woven, richly patterned cloth, dyed a bright
blue and red. Their feet are naked but their legs are covered to the
ankle. Nude slaves, wearing only aprons, appear among them carry-
ing the tribute. Besides costly vessels, lapis-lazuli, and cornelians,
they also bring a lion and two splendid light-coloured horses.

On wall f, to the right of the entrance, is a representation of
an offering of flowers.

15. Medinet Habu.

To the S.W. ofli1ornetMurroi, and at no great distance, appears
an extensive temple-group. This bears the name of Malinet Habu, a
Christian village which arose around and even within the ancient
sanctuary as early as the 5th cent., and of which considerable traces
still remain. () u the N. side ofthetemple-ruins rise heaps ofrubbish,
which we follow in the direction of the river, until we reach the
main fagade, which fronts the S.E. and is as imposing as it is
curious. The traveller of experience will at once perceive that
here we have not to do with a monument erected, like the Itarnes-
seum, under the intluence of a single continuous impulse. but with
a building begun in early times and not completed until the epoch
of the Ptolemies. The entire edifice may be divided into three
easily distinguished portions. The earliest of these is the small
oblong temple (Pl. N), lying parallel with the N. girdle-wall, and
founded under the 18th Dynasty. The most recent is the pylon
LPI. K ] adjoining this, with a beautiful and richly adorned portal,
seen to especial advantage by those who approach the temple from
the plain. A glance at the capitals of the two large columns rising
in front of the gateway and at the style of the inscriptions informs
the expert that this edifice dates from the epoch of the Ptolemies.
Reserving these for later inspection, we proceed first to the third
portion, the main temple.

The .\l.\I.\' TEMPLE OF MmoisEr 11mm was erected as a Memno-
nium by Ramses m. of the 20th Dyn., without any reference to
the previously existing temple of the 18th Dynasty. Though this
temple is beautiful and finely proportioned in many of its parts, its
architect has displayed no skill in incorporating what already existed
with the new editice. The erroneous opinion that the temple of
Medinet llabu was a royal palace must be most emphatically pontra-
dicted. It was no more a palace than was the Ratnesseurn or any of
the other buildings in W. Thebes. It was a Memnonium devoted to
ancestor-worship, and its principal part wasintended forthe worship
of the manes of Ramses 111., and to remind posterity of his fame
and his exploits. The temple served also for the celebration of
festivals, including a specially important one for whose adequate
