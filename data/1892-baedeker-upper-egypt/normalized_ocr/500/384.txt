302 LOWER NUBIA. History.

of the petty Egyptian kings by Psammetikh I. (004-610). In his
reign, according to the somewhat incredible story of Herodotus (II,
30), 240,000 soldiers, discontented with the severity of their service,
emigrated to Ethiopia, where they settled near Meroii under the
name of Automoles or Sembrites, and did much to refine the man-
ners of the Ethiopians. Psammetikh II. undertook an expedition
against the Ethiopians (Herod. II, 160), to which references are
made in Greek and Phoenician inscriptions in the temple of Abu-
Simbel (p. 334). The steles at Barkal mention two other Ethiopian
kings, Jlor-si-atef and Nastosenen, whose reigns cannot be accu-
rately dated. The former reigned for forty years, warred against the
Rehrera and Media, African tribes of Diirftu and Ahyssinia, and
erected temples; of the latter we learn that he was solemnly crowned
in the temple of Napata.

The early royal residence Napata now began to decay, and
Berna (MeroiO near Begerawiyeh became the capital of the Ethio-
pians. From Diodorus (m, fl) we learn that under Ptolemy Phila-
delphus a king of the name of Ergamenes shook himself free of the
influence of the priests and caused them to be massacred in the
golden temple. This can hardly be the same Ergamenes whom we
meet at Dakkeh (p. 316), for the latter does not seem to have
flourished until the time of the Roman emperors. During the Ro-.
man period, an Ethiopian invasion of the Thebaid led to the cam-
paign of Petronius (25 13.0.), in which Napata was destroyed. Queen
Candace made peace with the Roman general (Strabo XVII, 54).

Towards the close of the 3rd cent. A.D. the country above Phila:
was devastated by the Btemmyes, a fierce Nubian tribe dwelling
between the Nile and the Red Sea, who carried their depredations
even into the Roman territory beyond Assu√©n. To restrain them
the emperor Diocletian summoned the tribe of the Nobades from
the oasis of el--Ehirgeh (p.:3h8) to the Nile valley, and settled them
in the district from Elephantine upwards, while the temples of
Philae were assigned as common sanctuaries to them and to the
Blemmyes. In spite of the aid of the Xobades, the tive towns of
the Commilitium Romanum (Prime, Phamieon, Khiris, Taphis,
and Talmis) fell into the hands of the barbarians, who made Talmis
tlgalabsheh, see p. 307) their capital. In the 4th and 5th cent.
they ravaged the Theba'id, so that in MI A.D. Maximinus, the
general of the emperor Marcian, was forced to conclude a peace on
unfavourable terms for 100 years, Which, however, only lasted until
the death of tht general. Between 530 and 550 the Nobades were
converted to Christianity; and Silica, one of their kings, defeated
the Blemmyes. His victory is recorded in a Greek inscription
found in the temple of Iialabsheh o. 308). Christianity gradu-
ally invaded the temples of Nubia; and the Nobad king Eirpano-
mos and Bishop Theodorus (p. 283) of Phila: exterminated pa-
ganism. But not long afterwards Ethiopia, like Egypt, fell into
