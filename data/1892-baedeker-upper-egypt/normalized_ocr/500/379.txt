out. Although exception may be taken to the height of the abaei
and to many other points, no one who has visited Phila, will forget
this little temple, least of all if he have seen it by moonlight.

In the N.E. of the island are the ruins of a village and of buildings
of various kinds. In the extreme ICE. is a Roman Triumphul Arch (P1. ti),
with a lofty middle portal flanked by lower wings. The structure, which
has also been taken for a eity-gate, faces the E., ale. the well-fortified
hank of the Nile.'Ihe S. wing is in good preservation but is somewhat
clumsy. Above it is a brick dome supported on sandstone consoles. It
is possible that Diocletian passed beneath the central arch when he
visited the sacred island of Philm. His name, at all events, is to be
found on the blocks of sandstone scattered on the ground "r.

The huge heaps of ruins scattered over the island defy description,
and contain little of interest. On the other hand study may well he
devoted to the numerous Inscriptions in demotic, Greek, Latin, Coptic.
and Arabic. Some of the Greek inscriptions are elegant. The Verses
of' Catilz'zrs surnamed Nieanor, son of Nieanor, who lived 7 B.C., are ex-
cellent; and his acroslics display considerable skill.

The Cataract Islands.

The islands in the neighbourhood of Philze are picturesque, but
a visit to them can be recommended only to sEgyptologists and geo-
logists. for they contain nothing but rocks with a few inscriptions

carved upon them.

Bigeh, called by the ancient Egyptians tettels a Senem-t, lying
£2:

opposite Philar, is the most easily accessible. It is reached in about
two minutes from Philze, of which it commands apieturesque view,
as Phila does of it, with its hare rocks and ruined buildings. Bigeh
enjoyed a very early reputation for peculiar sanctity, and we have
already seen (p. 9.94) that one of the isymbolical sources of the Nile
was located here. Various Rock Inscriptions and also the hiero-
glyphies on a granite Statue of Osiris found here record that as
early as the 18th Dyn., under Amenhotep II. and Amenhotep IH.,
this island was visited by pilgrims and was provided with temples.
The deities chiefly worshipped in the latter were the ram's-headed
khnum, god of the cataracts, and a Hathor. Senem was not regarded
as belonging to E, gypt but to Hush. ale. Ethiopia, or Ta-kens, with
which the modern Kemis may be compared. Among the pilgrims,
whose names are found on Bigeh, were several governors of Ethi-
0pia, who were usually royal princes. The ruins of the Temple
visible from Philze. in which the name of Ptolemy Neos Dionysus
is of most frequent occurrence, are now inhabited by an obliging
Nubian family, only a few of whose members understand anything
but Kemis. The most interesting remains here are Two Columns,
with unseulptured Ptolemaic capitals and a Portal with a carefully
built arch, adorned with a Greek ornament. Adjoining the latter is
a House built of bricks, Nile-mud, and broken stones, in which i,
