of the king, the symbol of the'panegyrie tent) I l, and a number

of stars. A dedicatory inscription, dividing the ceiling into two
parts, records that'this Memnonium was erected in the temple of
Abydos to his forefathers and all the cycles of gods of heaven and
earth, by the king, lord of the diadems, who is born again, who
surpasses all in strength and annihilates the barbarians, the vie-.
torious Horns, who appears in new glory, bearing sway over the
barbarians in all countries, the king of Upper and Lower Egypt,
who achieves noble deeds, the lord of both worlds, Ra-ma-men.
He erected to them these venerated sanctuaries outside the Necro-
polis, building them of stone and inlaying them with gold, in
an everlasting work outlasting human life, ete.' - By the right
wall on entering the corridor from the second hypostyle is the eelea
hrated *Tahlet of Abydos, consisting of three long rows of royal

shields or eartouehes 0, before which Seti and his son Ramses II.

stand in adoration. The praying king raises his right hand and holds
a eenser in his left hand; the boy-prince, standing in front of him,
still bears the lock of youth, hanging over his temples. In his
raised hands he bears written rolls. The adjoining inscription reads:
t { eeitation of songs of praise by Prince Ramses, son and firstborn of
the king who loves him'. Above the shields is another inscription,
whieh describes the king's offering as made to Ptah-Sokar-Osiris,
the lord of the sarcophagus in the Memnonium of Abydos and { unit
khet) the royal forefather of Seti. He enumerates his gifts: 1000
loaves of bread, 1000 barrels of beer, 1000 cattle, 1000 geese,
1000 incense-offerings, 1000 oil-offerings, 1000 pieces of cloth,
1000 garments, 1000 barrels of wine, 1000holy offerings. The
flgure 1000 here, which occurs in almost all saerifi cial lists and also
in other formulae, is not, of course, to be taken literally but simply
as equivalent to many. The king, as we see, brings his youthful
son into the hall dedicated to his ancestors, where the earlier rulers
of Egypt, under the symbol of their name, dwell beside the tomb
of Osiris. He teaches the boy to oiTer rieh gifts, such as hereafter
he would wish offered to his own manes. It is beyond doubt that
Seti was still living when this inscription was set up, and yet
he already adds his own name to those of his predecessors; it
occupies the whole of the lowest row (the third from the top) of the
royal table, being repeated IO times with prefix and affix. The
living Seti provides for the future Osiris and for his worship at the
holy grave. .--- In the first volume of this Handbook (p. 85) it has
been shown that the establishment of the chronology of the Egyptian
kings was rendered possible only by a collation ofthe lists ofManethn
with the lists of Pharaohs preserved in the monuments. Among
the latter none approaehes in importanve the royal tahlet ol the
Baahmmu's Upper Egypt. 5
