came to pass that the iustigatnr of the rebels in the outlying lauds had
his secret retreat lrom the city of the throne of the gods to the place
.... in the ti. (Une of the chambers of the temple, viz. Pl. V, was
called'city of the throne of the gods', but the phrase is here used to
describe the town of Edfu.) That ended tnefr) _in the year'N in the reign
of the late King Ptolemy V. Epiphanes, after the long had suppressed the
revolution in the land; behold, his name iiuoft'scially placed in it' [ the
temple).

The in < cripti0n continues:'In the 5th year, 1/30 of the Shaflhet (M.
on the tat of the month t'ybi) of his beloved son, the late King Pto-
lemy VII. Phtlometor, were erected the great wooden door in the hall of
the Strong Victor (one ot the names of the temple of ltdfu), and the two
wings of the door of the Hai hall (the name of Hall D, with the i2 co-
Iumr1s). Similarly what had been made in work in the interior of the
Chamber of Victory (Le. Room 1, behind the adytum) in the 30th year
of this king was restored. The finishing of the hieroglyphies, carved
with the graving tool, the decoration of the walls _With a covering of
gold, the application of the colours, the iiniU1ing, of the top-ornument
of its wooden doors, the making of the door-stands of good brass, uith
the metal hinges and lock;, the fixing of gold plates on the wings of its
door Â», the tinishing of the interior of the temple-proper with perfect work
by the best artists of the time - these operations lasted until the 23th
year, on the 13th day of the month 31erori, under the late King Ptole-
my IX. Euergetes 11. and his consort, the regent Cleopatra III. This makes
a period of 95 years from the ceremony of the first liarumer-stroke to the
fettal entry, the festival of the consecration of the ance, tral abode by
His Majesty to his divine lord, Horus of Edfu, god Ahi, the lord of
heaven, which i, the great festival of tekhu, and has been equalled by
nothing since the creation of the world to the present day'.

The dates given above as to the progress of the work are aq follows'. -
1. Ist Tyhi, 5th year of Ptol. VII. Philom. = 3rd Feb. 176 8.0.
2.'ihe 30th year of the same king = 152-151 3.0.
3. 18th Mesori, thh year of Ptol. IN. Euerg. = 10th aept. rd?, B.C.
Finally from the foundation.- fe, tival on 23rd Aug. 237 BAJ. to the.
festal entry on mm Sept. 142 15.0. is a period of Wo years.

The inscription next devotes some space to the description of the
festival of the solemn entry of the god, and then goes on: In this beau-
tifal 30th year, month Payni, 9th day, festival of the union of the moan-
god Osiris with the sun-gud eta, again the festival of a 6th of Payni, the
foundation was laid of the Ehent Hall (Pl, E, the 1S-coluuined hypostyle),
which has two side-ehapels within it (referring probably to the small
chambers to the right and left of the portal, in the front wall), and the
roof of the sun-god who commands in heaven was completed in the
46th year, month .uesori, ttith day (he. Sept. 5, 122 B.00, which is 16 years,
2 months, 10 days from the foundation of the. ball of the sun-mountain
(another name for Ilall h), uhich was laid on the hth Payni in the
30th year of Ptolemy IN. (is. July 2, 1-10 B.C.). thus from the founding
of the hall to the completion ot the roof there elapsed, as the inscription
correctly states, a space of 17 years, 2 months, 10 days, reckoning to the
dmlicatory festival of the noble Khent hall, which took place on the day
of the't'ekhu festival.

Fifteen detinite dates are given in this important inscription detailing
the history of the temple of Edfu, beginning with the foundation-cere-
mony on the 7th Epiphi in the 10th year of Ptolemy lil. (23rd Aug.
237 15.0.), and ending with the year of Ptolemy X. voter 11.'s second
assumption of the government, viz. the 236th year of the Lagidae = toO-So'
8.0. To these We may add a sixteenth, dating the final e.tupletion of
the huge building. From an inscription given thrice inside the portal of
the pylons and the colonnade of the fore-court, we learn that the two
brass-mounted "ings of the door of the great mlons were erected on the
ist Khuiak in the 25th year of Ptolemy XIII. Sees Diunyms, and of his
sister and wife Cleopatra Tryphama, Le. on llecemher 5th, 57 B.C. Thus
