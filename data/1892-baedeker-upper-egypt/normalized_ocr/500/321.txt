battle, is trarlitiOnally laid in the meme of Apollinopolis. An in-
scription relating to the Horus myth, 0n the inside of the W.
girdle-wall, states that'they reached Stth-Typhon and his com-
panions in the meme of Apo1linopolis'.

Horus emerged victorious from this battle, and the evil Seth-
Typhon was pierced by him (tebu). Tiercer thereupon became his
name, and'place of the piercing' the name of his district and town.
This name is clearly preserved in the modern name Edfu. An-
other name, that occurs most frequently next to this one and has
also reference to the chief deity of the temple at Edfu, is Hut or
Behut. Thus the winged sun-disc, which was placed over the err-
trance to every Egyptian temple, was named

ciz, i'ii: iziiijji'i:'i'if2cc=sc-r-y ie,

Behut miter aneb pe.t iib su.ti per em khu.t

'Hut, the great god, the lord of heaven, who, clad in bright plum-
age, comes forth from the sun-mountain'.

Another name for the winged sun-disc is Apt, which means
'flying' and'wings'.

At the head of the gods worshipped at Edfu stood, as is appa-
rent from what has already been said,'Horus, who spreads his
wings, the great god, the lord of heaven, who, clad in bright plum-
age, comes forth out of the sun-mountain'. Next to him rank the
Hathor of Denderah, who undertook a special festal journey to Edfu,
Ahi, son of lIathor, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Shu, and Tefnut.

History of the Temple. The representations and inscriptions
that cover the walls of the great temple ot Horus at Edfu place it
beyond doubt that the building in its present form dates from the
period of the Ptolemies. Yet like the sanctuary of Hathor at Den-.
derah, it is not an architectonic creation of that period, but merely
a splendid restoration of an earlier temple carried out under the
Lagidae. The Temple proper, i.e. the sacred apartments exclu-
sive of the later hypostyle with its 18 columns (P1. E) and of the
fore-court with its 32 columns (Pl. IC), as well as of the still later
pylons and girdle-wall, was begun by Ptolemy III. Euergetes J. in
the 10th year of his reign. It was finished 95 years later, in the
98th year of the reign of Ptolemy IA". Euergetes 11., and the 18th
Mesori in that year was fixed by the priests for its consecration,
as an important festival took place upon that day. The image of
Horus was carried in solemn procession into the temple, and the
author of the builders' inscriptions at Edfu, in describing this so-
lemn entry, introduces the god as astonished by the magnificence
that greeted him, and moved by joy, as addressing his surround-
ings. In his speech the god expressly states that lthe halls were
renewed in their building', and that'commands went forth from
their majesties to rebuild his house, an edifice of ancient times, and
