immodcrate flattery, and the absence of fact. The names of the conquered
nations are here recorded, but we learn few particulars of the course of
the wars. The value of the booty is here and there indicated, but it by
no means corresponds to the gigantic achievements performed by Ramses HI.
according to the exaggerated representations of his priestly flatterers.
There can be little doubt that he successfully opposed a league of several
peoples, who attacked his kingllum by land and sea; but he did not pene-
trate into the heart of Asia as his great ancestors did, and the critic
cannot avoid regarding the paeans of Medinet Habu as exaggerated and
unreliable. The report nu the first pylon, referring to the victory of the
7th day of the month Mekhir in the year M, contains some passages of
considerable poetic force. After relating, that the enemy had intended to
settle in Egypt and to till the land as his own, the account goes on:
'Death lurked in Tamer (Egypt) for those, who had come on their own
feet to the furnace, in which fire consumed impurity under the glow of
the heroism of his majesty, who inspired terror like Baal on high. All
his limbs are filled with the power of victory... His right hand grans
multitudes, and over those who place themselves against him his left
hand is stretched out like missiles directed against them to slay them.
His battle-Scythe (moWs) mightily, like his father Month. - Kapur (prince
of the Lihyans), who came as one smitten with blindness to receive hom-
age. laid down his weapons on the ground with his warriors, and cried
aloud to heaven to beseech grace (r tebhl. His son held his foot and his
hand and remained standing in his place. But the God, who knew what
was passing in his inmost mind (what was in his intestines), fell upon
their heads like a mountain of granite... Their blood mingled with the
mirth like the overtlowing river', etc.

On the S. or Left Pylon are similar representations. Between the
two f1ast-staffs the king appears with his fettered enemies before
the god Ptah, who aims a blow at two enemies. Beneath is another
horizontal row of ten conquered peoples, and a stele of the 12th year
of the king (imitated from a stele ot' the 35th year of Ramses 11. at
Atm-Simbel), containing a dialogue between Ptah and the king.
To the left JO is a eolossal figure of Ammon-Ra, handing the sword
of victory to the king, beside six rows of fettered enemies.

Within the gateway (P1. l) leading to the next court is the
name of Ramses 111., engraved unusually deeply in the stone. The
Fore-court (Pl. D), forming an approximate square of 115 ft., is
enclosed on all sides, and is not destitute of shade even at midday.
On the left (fo are calyx-eolumns and on the right (N.) are Osiris-
statues placed against pillars, which form galleries with the outer
walls. If we can imagine this space cleared of rubbish and ruined
walls, we can form some idea of it, pristine effect. Even as it is
it impresses the beholder, with its pylons to the E. and W. to shut
out the uninitiated, its colonnades to the N. and s., and its magni-
fieent decoration in carvings and inscriptions. Here and elsewhere
at Metliuet Hahn we notice that want of symmetry, which is
frequently made a reproach to the Egyptian artists; but there is no
doubt that the priestly architects deliberately here placed columns
ofdifi'ereut forms opposite each other, with the intention ot'tlis-
guising or relieving the uniformity dictated by the hieratie ranou.

We now turn to tho Inncr Side of the first pylon. To the right
we see a long hieroglyphic inscription; below, to the left, the Pha-
raoh with his bow bent dashing against the foe, in a chariot drawn by
