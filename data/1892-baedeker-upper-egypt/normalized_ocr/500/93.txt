There is a. difference of opinion "to the'Situation and Form of the
Ancient Lake. Linant- Bey, arguing from the considerable difference of
level between the two lakes, maintains that the Birket el- Kurun (Lake
of the Mor ns, p. 431 could never have formed part of Lake Mieris, as was
formerly'iifa'i2i,"'a'ii1 he as igns to the latter a mneh smaller area than

S.E., nearer to the Labyrinth and el-Lahl1n, he makes its bonndary-line
run towards the S.S.W. of Meilinetel-Fayt1m tn the Birket el-G'ltaral.c, and
intersoc-t the desert of Shikh Ahmed, where the ancientheight of the wa-
ter, which far exceeds the level attained in modern times, has left its
traces; it then leads to Fulamshah, turns to the N. to Drr, and then to
