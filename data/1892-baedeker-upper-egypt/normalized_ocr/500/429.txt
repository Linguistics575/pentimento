The oasis and the oracle of Ammon were celebrated from a remote
antiquity. Bacchus is said to have been the first to consult the oracle;
and in the legend of Perseus and Andromeda, the latter was said to have
been offered to the sea-monster to save her country, in obedience to a
response ofthis god. Hercules presenteda great offksringtoAmmon, Semiramis
consnlted the oracle On her expedition to Egypt. The law-giver ftocehoris
(Bek-en-ranf; 2tlth Dyn.; 8th cent. RC.) expelled the Jews from the land at the
bidding ofthe god. Psammetikh I. enrolled the Carians with plumes ofcoek'g
feathers in obedience to his response. Herodotus relates (HI,'25, 26) that
Gamhyses sent SOJOO men to take the Ammonites slaves and to destroy their
oracle with fire, This force reached the eity of Oasis, also called the Island
of the Blessed, after 7 days march, and then vanished into space, apparently
heing overwhelmed by a whirlwind. The oasis and its oracle are, how-
ever, best known from the Vieit of Alexander the Great, recorded hy Dio-
dorus (XVII, do), Quinta: Curtius, and Arriaa after Aristuhuius. After
Alexander had made himself master of Phremicia by the battle of Issus,
he marched to Egypt which submitted without resistance. Desiring to
consult the famous Oracle of Ammon, he undertook the adventurous march
through the desert, Ambassadors from Cyrene met him with a valuable
gift of war-horset His supply of water came to an end after four days,
and he watt only saved from perishing by an unexpected fall of rain.'Ihe
way wa < pointed out to him by crows, flying on the right Ride of the
army. He pasqed the Bitter Lakes, then 100 stadia (about 10) 1.) farther
the so-called Cities of Ammon, and another day's journey brought him to
the vicinity of the temple. Diodorus thus describes the place.'The Am-
mnnites dwell in villages, hut in the midst of their land is a castle de-
fended hy a triple wall. The first (Le. innermost) wall encloses the pa-
lace of the ruler; the soeond the women's apartments, with the dwellings
of the women and children and the palladia ofthe place, with the temple
of the god and the sacred spring; the third encloses the abode of the
spearmen, etc. A little beyond the castle another temple of Ammon has
been erected under the shade of numerous large trees. Near it is a spring,
called Spring of the Sun On account of its peculiar properties. It is warm
in the morning. enld at midday, and hot at midnight. The image of the
god is encrusted with emeralds and other gems, and gives its oracular
responses in a curious way. It is carried in a golden boat on the shoul-
ders of eighty priests, who direct. their course according to signs from the
god. Women and girls accompany the god with songs'.

When Alexander. entered the temple he was hidden welcome by the
oldest priest in the name of the god. Alexander accepted the Welcome
and promised to worship the and, if he gave him the lordship of the
whole earth. The king then asked whether all the murderers of his fa-
ther had been punished. The oracle replied that no one could aim at the
life of him that had made him (Le. of the god); but that the murderers
of Philip were punished

The Oasis of Siwah, formerly enllerl also Samaria (after Iskander, Ale-
xander the Great) lies. according to Jordan's calculations, 05 ft. below the
sea-level, in N. lat. 20012' and long. 2303f E. of Greenwich. Browne
estimated the length of the oasis at 71/2 M., its breadth at 6 M. Rohlfs
estimates the length from qurayi in the w. to Muteu)'us in the E. at
about MY/a N., in a line running first KAY. and S.E. and beyond Siwah ti.W.
and N.H. The breadth varies from a few yards in 11/. N. It is situated
on the S. verge of the steep so-called Libyan eoost-plaieau, which con-
sists of limestone, and nn the S. it is bounded by sand-hills.

Several steep rocks are found in the oasis; v.9. the Auwlal and Djari
in the w., the Gebel Jltiltih, 1/231. to the N. of Siwah, the rocks of Siwah
and Akermi, Gebel h'; di Ilmned to the s., and Gabe ] Bvik to the S.E. of the
capital. Hf the numerous warm springs (upwards of.30) in the oasis,
the strongest are those of Khumisuh, and the most famous'Ain { lummdm
