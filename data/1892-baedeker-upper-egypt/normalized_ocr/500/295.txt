have been connected with the shaft of Dér el-bahri, in which the
royal mummies were discovered.

21. From Biban tsl-Malts to el-Asasif
and Dér el-bahri.

From Bib e1-Multsk we need not return by the way we came,
but may take the path over the hill which separates the Tombs of
the Kings from Dér eI-bahri and tsl-Asaph'. The path, which cannot
be missed, begins at tomb 16; from tomb 17 which every one will

, visit, it is reached by going a few steps to the west. Persons not
equal to the climb may ride to the top, but it is a great strain upon
the donkeys. Riding down the hill is by no means to be recom-
mended. The donkey-boys usually lead the animals by a narrow
path over the ridge, and await the travellers at the foot. The zigzag
path is fatiguing but safe, and is easily accomplished in 3/4 hr. The
's View is most remarkable; first into the desolate valley of the Tombs
ofthe Kings, then-from the summit and as we descend into the pe-
culiar ravine of Dér el-bahri; we see the steep projecting mountain
side with its tombs, and buildings old and new, with the rich green
of the fertile plain below spread out on both sides of the Nile, and
here and there its groups of palms and gigantic temples, as far as
Karnak and Luxor on the E. bank.

Those who are interested in the prehistoric stone-age, and the flint
implements of the childhood of the world, may notice at the beginning
of the path as well as on the top of the hill, and as they descend to Dér
el-bahri, several open spaces covered with fragments of flint. Lenormaut
and Hamy considered these to he prehistoric khife-manufaetories, and the
myriads of fragments lying about to he the work of man; but Lepsius
has proved that they are nothing more than the fragments of flint nodules
such as may now be seen lying about, which split owing to the rapid
changes of temperature. The traveller will in fact find thousands of
fragments resembling knives and scrapers. And this is only natural, for
whether the splitting is due to nature or to art, the same shapes are likely
to he constantly produced. The calcareous limestone of these hills is full
of crystals of silex. The walls of the tombs may be remembered with
the dark broken nodules which stand out against the light-coloured lime-
stone. What Hamy and Lenormant took for flint manufactories at the
entrance of Bihiin ei-UuJt1k are only heaps of stone, cut out of the rock
with metal tools at the making of the tomb. The fragments of limestone
and flint were necessarily removed from the excavations and were thrown
down on the sides of the valley. On the other hand Virchow assumes
a prehistoric Egyptian stone period, and considers the stoise-fraguients
of Dér el-bahri to be to some extent artitieial productions.

Before turning to the temple of Der el-bal.1ri which is seen, with
the tower of clay-bricks, as we descend the hill, a visit should he
paid to the Necropolis lying between Shékh'Abd el-It'urnah (p. 190)
and Drah Abu'l-Neggah (p. 199) known as -.

El-Asasif. The part to be visited is known by the Arabs as el-
Asas'if el-harris/eh or the northern Asasif. Numerous tombs of various
periods lie here in the series of low hills, which form the back as
it were of the steep rocky range rising behind Dtr el-bahri. Only
