to Assittt. SPEOS ARTEMIDOS. f. Route. 11

The'three weeks' steamer halts here 3-4 hrs., while the'four weeks'
steamer remains overnight and leaves the entire forenoc-n for a visit to
Speos Artemidos and Benilsasan. The excursion begins at Speos Artemi-
dos, Which lies to the s. (1/2 hr. on i1onkey-baek), whence we proceed
towards the N. to (1/2 hr.) the foot of the tombs of Benilyrsam We then
walk to (10 min.) the S. graves and descend to Nos. 2 (Khnum-hotep) and
1 (Ameni-Amenemha) of the N. tombs, where the asses are in waiting to
take us back to the steamer (3/4 hr.). Travellers ascending the river in
a dhahabiyeh should land at Ber1iluvsan, ride to Speos Artemidos, and send
the dhahabiyeh on to meet them near the village of Benittasan el-ithmav.
Those descending the stream save a little time by landing at a point
somewhat nearer the tombs of Benihasan, almost opposite Benihasan el-
Kadim (p. 12).

Specs Artemidos (' grotto of Artemis'), known to the Arabs as
S.tabl'Antar ('stable of Antar'; comp. p. 33), is reached from the
steamboat-landing, where asses are in waiting, in 1/2 hr. The route
crosses fleHs and sand, finally ascending considerably. On the
way carefully rolled cat-mummies are offered for sale, which
have retained the unmistakeahle odour of cats for thousands of

years. The cat was sacred to the goddess Pasht, whom

the Greeks identified with Artemis. The Temple of this goddess,
hewn in the rock. consists of a vestibule and of an inner chamber
connected with the vestibule by a corridor. Above the door of the
vestibule is a long inscription of the time of the 18th Dynasty,
which celebrates the goddess Pasht and also speaks, under the name
of Amu, of the Hyksos in Avaris who from ignorance of the god
Ra destroyed the ancient temples.

The temple itself was founded by Tutmes III. and renewed by
Seti 1. Of the 8 pillars which supported the vestibule all have
been destroyed except two in the front row, which bear inscriptions
and royal cartouches on their w. and E. sides only. On the W.
side of the recumbent pillar to the right Champollion saw the

name of Tutmes III. co eeeh ti). All the other tartouehes are
those of Seti L, who is described as the favourite of the goddess

Pusht, the mistress of'ts, Mi ] Matennu or the dweller in the

mountain Q60 Ant. On the rear-wall of the vestibule

are some inteisting representations. To the left is Pasht in the
guise of a mighty sorceress, stretching out her left hand to king
Seti I., behind whom, sitting in an attitude of benediction, is
the god Ammon-Ra. To the extreme left is the small figure of the
god Thoth, lord of Hermopolis. Appropriate inscriptions are
also furnished. To the right, in three rows, are the deities of Specs
Artemidos (12 figures), beginning with Mentu and Tum, in front
of whom is Thoth, who conveys to the local gods the command of
Ammon-Ra that Seti I. shall be raised to the throne of Horus. In
