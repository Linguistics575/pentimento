Horus) as at Denderah (p. 80) and Phila. Four columns are also
left on each side, united by means of a building between them,
which has a semi-portal on the W. side, farthest from the Nile.
The capitals of the side-columns resemble those of the front co-
lumns of the hypaethral temple on Philee. They are lotus-calyx
capitals, framed at the top with leaves springing from buds, while
beneath are the usual five annuli or rings. Only a single cross-
beam now rests upon the beams running lengthwise in this little
temple, which cannot have been more than about 25 ft. square.

About 10 min. to the S. is a double girdle-wall of large hewn
stones, stretching to the Nile, and furnished with a gateway. A
flight of steps leads down to the river. The Pylon-like gateway
appears to have been faced by another of the same kind. The wall
has been taken for the remains of a Roman permanent camp. An
ancient road leads thence to the sm to some *Sandstone Quarries,
which contain about 60 Greek votive inscriptions (and one demotic)
dating from the Roman imperial epoch (Septimius Severus, Cara-
calla to Gordian). There are also two busts and a carefully con-
structed niche, with the winged sun-disc above it, apparently in-
tended to hold a statue. The inscriptions have been carved mostly
by priests of the Games (Yspsog 769.03, also cipylispeu;'r: prftsrazrs:,
etc.), a word which Franz explains (Corp.1nscrip. Graec. III, 460)
to mean the carriage of stones under priestly management from the
quarries for the pu'rpose of building temples.

At all events in the inscription to the left of the head of the bust
(in Lepsius 373) a priest of the (# 011109, named tlrSES. son of Psenfauax,
records that he had despatched 110 stones for the work of Isis of Philm,
i.e. probably for one of the later temples (perhaps the one next the stream
on the w. side). Considerable sums were paid for the privilege of holding
this probably lucrative office. Eight tablets (the four earlier beside the
left bust, the four later heside the right bust) record that a certain Gains
Dioscuros (Julius) Mncrinus, who is prohahly represented by both the
busts, held this oftice eight times. for which first and last_ he expended
no less than 300 pieces of gold (vuotv5c), equal to about 2751. in modern
currency. The years of his ofheke are given: the 19th and 22nd years (of
Septinoius Severus and his eo-resent Caracalla), the 2nd of Heliogahalus
or Alexander Severus, the 19th (of the last named emperor), the lst (0f
Maximinus), the 3rd (of Gordian), and the 2nd and 5th of Philippus Arabus,
Le. in all a period of about 50 years, between 200 and 249 AM.

A tahlet of the 19th year of Caraealla (19R Am.) records that a priest
of the Gomos (erected) the gnomon (sun-dial) 0n the pylons nspl TOO
1611.00, i.e. probably to determine the right time for sending off the stones.
Gan found a sun-dial in the quarries of Kertassi.

Among the deities worshipped here besides Isis, were a goddess
named Epcottqt; (Sruptichis) and a god named Ihvtr-city.ro5yt;
(Pursepmunis), probably native Ethiopian gods.



On the right (W.) bank lies the considerable village of Umm-
Baratsat.

41/2M. (W. bank) Tafeh occupies the site of Taphis, mentioned
in the Itinerarium Antonini. Two temples are mentioned by earlier
travellers as being here, but in 1890 Prof. Eisenlohr was able to dis-
