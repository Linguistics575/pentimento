el-Inglis) and thence through the Wadi Ambagi to Eosér or Kosseir, on
the Arabian Gulf, the Leukos Limen (White IlarbOur) of the Ptoiemies and
the Tua of the ancient Egyptians. About 4 M. to the N. the scanty remains
of Old Koy'r, corresponding to the harbour of Philotera, the ancient Aen-
mm, which was named thus in honour of the sister of Ptolemy Phila-
delphus. Jios.il is now an unimportant town of about 3000 inhab., with
a quay, a wooden mole t00ft. long, two mosques, and several bazaars.
The small houses are all whitewashed. The only ediliees of any size are
the government buildings erected by Mohammed'Ali opposite the mole,
the adjacent custom-house, and a large grain-magazine, also belonging to
the Egyptian government.

In going from Fos.ir towards the Nile the Beduins sometimes prefer
another and more southerly route than that through the Wiidi JJamitmitt.
This diverges from. the route above described at the Bir el-fag/is in the
Wtidi Bc'dah (see above) and leads at first through the winding It'ddi J.rabr,
el-Ehddim, afterwards passing the Gebel Nulzds and through the pass of
Ri'at el-Ghazdl into the dei Ghazcil. To the right rise the conical Gebel
Daghaatyeh and Gebcl Moshdghir. Ive next follow the midi Hoamtdah, which
farther on takes the name of dei el-f/om" from the fine Gabe! IJomr,
which flanks it on the right. The night is spent at Moilah, a village with
water and a few huts of the Ubabdeh. At the Gebel mi.kif we cross the
Tarit e'dahrdtoi, a road running from N. to S., and farther 0n reach
Amdrah, with another well and more rAhabdeh huts. Thence our route
lies through the Wiidi Nair and the Wadi liktsh to the Bir et-Jfash, a
dried-up well, beyond which we pass numerous quarries of green breccia.
Beyond the passes of Ittrst tyt-lihit (sandstone formation) and Ri'at el-
Yamrah we reach the Mobwala (see p. 75) of Rats isyar, whence we go
on through the dei Mdghlat. to Jfobwalal thir el-tWir. Lastly we pro-
ceed vial, G'dhrat i'Dalfuh to La.kit.ah (p. 75), where our route unites with
the more northerly one already described.

Caravans 0n the way from Eosér to Esneh take a route still farther
to the ti., vii, the well of Davfdiri. The N. route from Nul-hc'l to Eeneh
is now seldom used.

The journey to Berenike, 0n the Arabian Gulf in 2N' N. lat., and to
the emerald mines W' to the N. of it, is seldom undertaken. Ive may
start from Feneh or Koptos, diverging at Lahétah from the route to Fofer,
or we may begin at a point opposite Edfu (Contra-Apollinopoiis ] or
Itcdésiyeh (p. 253). On both routes traces of old watering stations are
discernible. Both Pliny and the Itinerary of Antonine (3rd cent. A.D.)
give a list of the ancient stations, with their distance from each other
in Roman miles. The list in the Itinerary is as follows: Phoenicon 27,
Didyme 24, Afrodito 20, Kompasi 22, Jovis 33, Aristonis 25, Phalacro 25,
Apolluno 23, Kahalsi 27, Keenan Hydreuma 27, Berenike 18 - in all
271 Roman miles = about 250 English miles.

be confounded with the place of the same name near Berenike) .---- hth Day.
Descent thrmtgh the Wddi Bizalt, with its acacias (selem and seyitl, Acacia
Ehrenbergiana and A. niiotica). From this point a diverging route leads
direct to the emerald mines of the Widi Zabiirah (see below). We cross
the Wadi Higeiig. On the rocks to the right are rude representations of
giraffes, camels, and ibcxes. Remains of an ancient station named Samurai,
with a cistern and chambers, occur in the same Tvsdi. \Ve next enter
the broad green Wddi JfoiWyeh., and steer for the Gebel Amgef, near which
is a spring of excellent water.--5th Day. Through huge granite rocks to
groups of ten and twenty rude stone huts, probably built by miners.

bark, with sails and rudder. Farther on is a ruined statiun, with the
remains of a stone hut. Near this point our route is joined by the route
