contains representations of the ram's-headed Amman, Isis, and Anubis.
The second room is entered by a, narrow door, 011 which are sacrificial
scenes before the ram's-head Ammon and other deities. The name of
the worshipping king is unfortunately not added and only the word Kisres
is legible in the secund cartouche. Above is the winged sun-disc. This
roam is only half as long as the preceding and is destitute of all ornament
except on the central door leading to the Sanctuary. Remele" s measure-
ments of the latter give the breadth at 71/2 ft., the depth at 11 ft., and
the height at 10 ft. The photographs taken by him indicate that the
temple was built by Nero O, Vespasian, and Titus. It was dedicated to
Ammon-Ra, who is frequently represented with the ram's-head and usually
accompanied by Muth. Once he is styled Lord of Heb, but his usual
tCh N---"
designation is'Dweller in II Ast ab', ale. the seat of the
[ j G

moon. Ast ab appears to be the name of the site of the temple, for the
same designation is here used for Shu, son of Ra, and for other gods. -
The above-mentioned door to the sanctuary had scenes of worship on
both its wings, and a six-line dedicatinn-inscription. On passing through
it into the cella, we see on the left, above, Yespasian offering to Ammon-
Ra, Muth, and Khunsu; beneath, 0n the left, the same emperor otfering
to the ram's-headed Ammon-Ra with his family, and on the right, to Khem
and Osiris Unnofer. In the bottom rows on the side-walls are depicted
Nile-gods, bringing offerings. - On the right. wall of the cella Vespasian
makes offerings to the ram's-headed Ammon-Ra, Muth, and KhunSu, then
to Shu, son of Ra, and io Tefnut, and finally to Shu, Osiris, and Isis.
The ceiling was occupied by a rude astronomical representation, but
most of the blocks have fallen. The back-wall of the cella is divided
in halves, each containing 3 fields. In all 6 fields there appears an
emperor sacrificing to the gods, among whom the ram'g-beaded Ammon is
twice represented. The emperor's name seems to be Nero (or more pru-
bably Nerva) Kisres Germanicus. - The platform of the temple com-
mands an excellent'View towards the long Table Mountain mentioned by
Edmonstone. About 120 ft. in front of the fore-court of the temple is a
stone gateway, with various representations now barely visible. The
entire temple is surrounded by a brick wall.
