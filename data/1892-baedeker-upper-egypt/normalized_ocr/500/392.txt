who were, about 540 A.D., defeated by Silho, the Christian king of
the Nohades (p. 302) who celebrated his victory in an inscription
on one of the pillars of the temple at Jialabsheh (see below).

The extant Large Temple was built under the Roman emperor
Augustus and his successors. The numerous inscriptions (in Greek,
with the exception of one in Latin hexameters ] date from the reigns
of Domitian, Ttajan, Hadrian, andAntoninus Pius, and of the later
emperors Alexander Severus and Philippus; they express the reve-
rence of the soldiers of the Spanish, fturean, and Thehan cohorts
for the great god Mandulis.

Including the inner girdle-wall the temple is 235 ft. long and
1171/2 ft. broad. There is also an outer girdle-wall, with small
temples at the N.E. and S.W. angles. Before the last stand five
columns one behind the other. The inner girdle-wall joins the
massive pylon, forming a continuous building with it. In front of
the pylon is a narrow platform, reached by a ilight of steps begin-
ning at the Nile, then by a paved passage about 100 ft. long and
25 ft. broad, leading to a second flight of 20 steps. The entrance to
the temple is blocked by fallen stones and the dwellings of natives,
who have settled all about the entire temple. In the interior of the
pylon are stairs and chambers, as at Edf11 o. 244). On passing
through the door of the pylon, which is not in a straight line with
the rest of the building but at a slight angle with the axis of the
temple, we find ourselves in a fore-court, 65 ft. long, the floor of
which is quite covered with fallen blocks of masonry. Of the double
row of columns which once stood here, probably in 4 couples on each
side, only a single column, on the left side, is now ereet. On each
side of this court four narrow chambers have been constructed in
the wall; and a door on the right communicates with the exterior
passage round the temple. The walls of the entrance to the next
room retire towards the top in the manner of a pylon. Here on the
right the above-mentioned decree of Silko is inscribed in bad Greek.
On the nearest column is a long inscription in the Ethiopian demo-
tic character, hitherto undeciphered, which m ay perhaps be a replica
or repetition of the decree.

The English translation of Silkohs important Greek inscription is as
follows. I Silko, sub-king (ilauv) disxoc) ofthe Nobades and all Ethiopians,
came twice to'l'almis (Ealabsheh) and Taphis (Tafeh). I fought against
the Blemmyes and God gave me the victory over them, three to one.
Again 1 conquered and took possession of their cities, I fovtifieil myself
there the first time with my troops. I overcame them and they sued to
me. 1 made peace with them and they swore to me by the images of
their gods, and I trusted their oath, for they were brave men. 1 ascended
Once more into the upper districts, Since I became sub-king, I go no
longer after the other kings but before them. And those who seek to
strive with me, I do not allow to remain in their land unless they heg for
pardon from me. For in the lower districts I am a lion, and in the upper
districts a bear. - I fought again with the Blemmyes from Primis to
Talmis. And I laid waste the other districts, the upper Nobad regions,
when they sought to strive with me. The rulers of the other peoples,
who seek to strive with me, I do not allow to seat themselves In the
