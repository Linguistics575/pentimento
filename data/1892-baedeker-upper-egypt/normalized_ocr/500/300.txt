226 Route T. THEBES. West Bank:

below, is an inscription of 131ines, of which the Sth and 9th
were destroyed by Ramses 11., for the purpose of inserting his own
name in honour of Ammon-Ra, the lord of heaven, etc. It speaks
of'the voyage on the sea, the beginning of the great journey to

"i Ta meter, Le. the holy land, the happy arrival in Arabia of

the soldiers of Pharaoh, the lord of the world, according to the
command of Ammon, the lord of the gods', etc. -Another in-
scription between the trees, to which the boat is fastened, tells us
that Punt as well as Arabia Petraea was dedicated to the goddess
Hathur. To the left of the two ships are 101ines describing by name
the different kinds of wares which sailors are carrying on board along
narrow planks.'Loading of the ships with untold quantity of
valuables from Arabia, precious kinds of wood from the holy land,
heaps of the grains of incense-gum [ kemi-ent-anta) t, Nehut trees
of fresh incense-grains (Enta), ebony (hebni) for sacred vessels with
gold and silver from of the land Amu (Asia), Deastt, and Khesit-
wood, possibly cassia-bark, grains of Ahemier, incense and COS-
meties (antimony), Anau and Kefu apes, Desem beasts or grey-
hounds, coloured panther-skins from the south,11atives and children'.
The inscription concludes with the statement that nothing like it had
been done under any king before, and it speaks the truth. Hatasu
showed her people the way to the land whose products were later
to fill the treasuries not only of the Paraohs, but also of the Phe-.
nieians and the Jews. - These pictures are of special interest as
exactly illustrating } Kings X. 22:'Once in three years came the navy
of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, and apes, and peaeoeks'.
Except these last named birds all the treasures may be seen on the
vessels of Hatasu. Her expedition must have been accompanied by
some nature-loving priests, as below the ships we see the water-line

fish of the Red Sea. The drawings of these are so characteristic that
Prof. Doenitz has been able to determine their Species. Among them
are Naseus unicornis, Xiphias gladius, Platax Teira, Balistes assasi,
Acanthurus velifer, Chaetodon strigangulus, Scarus virideseens, etc.
In a sole'one eye was drawn larger than the other, showing a fine
observation of nature'.

On the wall adjoining the right-hand corner there was to be seen
until a few years ago the transport of the incense-trees, 9 soldiers with

oft'1cers, and in two places, one above the other, the prince of Punt, named
Piralm, coming from the left, and followed by his wife, remarkable for her
