pouring, water from two vases. Un the summit of the rocky source
of the waters are a vulture (31 uth) and a hawk (Horus), gazing into
the distance and keeping watch. This is almost the only landscape
hitherto discovered on any Egyptian monument. The inscription
is in these words:'the very remote and very sacred, who rises in
Bigeh (Senem)'.

On the front of this little temple, to the left, is a Demotic Inscription
in red letters. in which Aurelius Antoninus Pius and Lucius Verus are
mentioned with their titles derived from conquered provinces. The
Cartouches of these late emperors occur also on the walls of the temple;
and on the outside of the W. wall are numerous inscriptions, chiefly
demotic.

L The great Outside Walls of the Temple are covered with
Inscriptions; to the left Cw.) by Tiberius, to the right (R) by
Autokrator Kicres (perhaps Augustus or even Tiberius again). The
most noteworthy is a List of Names. of great importance for the
geography of the ancient Egyptians (Vol. l., p. 31). On the W. wall
are the nomes of Lower Egypt, on the E. wall, near the foot, those
of Upper Egypt. Other lists are found within the temple.

m. The *Osiris Room, remarkably interesting on account of
the sculptures which cover its walls, is found as follows. Returning
to the second room (Pl. t) of the pronaos we pass through the door
on its W. side (next the Nile), and immediately to the right see
a Portal (still in the temple), leading to a Staircase which we as-
cend. A second staircase then leads to the roof of the cella. Here
we turn towards the S. and finally descend some stone steps to a
doorway built over with Nile bricks. The Vestibule is interesting.

shape of a mummy upon a bier. Twenty-eight lotus-plants sprout
from him, referring perhaps to the 28 days of the month, or the
28 ells of the maximum height of the Nile at Elephantine, or to
the 1-1 scattered and reunited parts of his body.

The'sprouting' of the dead into new life is a conception frequently
made use of, even with regard to the passing away of mankind. In the
Book of the Dead are the passages'I have accomplished the great path
(in the boat of the sun), my flesh sprouts', "He has become a god forever,
after his flesh acquired quiqkening power in the underworld'.

At the resurrection of Osiris all the spirits are present who play a
part in the Egyptian doctrine of immortality. They here appear in long
rows on the walls of the sacred chamber. The risen Osiris is adorned
with all the insignia of his dignity as a ruler of the underworld.

On the left door-post of the Usiris room are three Greek Inscriptions,
of which the longest dates from the 165th year of Diocletian (IM) AD.)
and another (very short) from the 169th year of Diocletian (lii3 ALL).
From these it is evident that the pagan worship of Isis and Osiris was
practised here down to a late period. The votive iliscriptions were com-
posed by the proto-stelistes timetkhen and his brother timet.

A few smaller edifices still remain to be visited. To the N. are
the ruins of a Christian Church, into which have been built frag-.

ments of an earlier structure of Tiberius. Here also is an inverted
