and some fragments of the walls of the temple proper still remain.
The temple stood from N. to S. On the pylon appears PtolemyNTH.
Neos Dionysus sacrificing to the gods ofihubos. The same families
of gods are found here as in the larger temple: Horus on one side,
Sebek and Hathor on the other. There is also an altar. From the
frequently repeated figures of Ape, goddess of births, the remaining
walls of the temple proper seem to have belonged to a Pa mes or

Birth-house. Dates are recorded, including the 5 Iipago-

meme or intercalated days, as the birth-day of Osiris and Horns.
On the wall facing the N. are Euergetes ll. and his wife fowling in
presence of lihem Ammon-Ra. Remains of topographical maps of
the nomes are also distinguishable.

The names of Tiberius and several other Roman emperors may
be read on the scattered columns and fragments of walls.

Many blocks bearing interesting inscriptions may be found
between the temple and the Nile. Among them is one, tauf/II-
nately damaged, with a Sacred Inscription, specially composed for
Ombos, commencing:'Beginning of the chapter of the book of
sacred knowledge, composed for_the house of the venerable god, the

lord of Ombos { 3% } g,' etc.

The W. side of the narrow river-channel is barren, while on the
i. side there is only a narrowstrip of cultivated land. Dark-skinned,
nude Arabs of the tribe of the'Ab√©bdeh (p. 25T) here and there
work a water-wheel. Occasionally a crocodile may be seen on the
bank; but travellers who ascend only to Phila: are rarely gratified
with a sight of one of these reptiles. - Dartttri, a station of the
mail-steamer, on the E. bank, marks the limit of Arabic. Here
begins the Ethiopian dialect known as Kem1s, which differs essen-
tially from the dialects spoken farther to the S. by the Mahns and
the Dongoluh (comp. p. 30-1). Even in ancient Egypt, as we learn
from a papyrus, the inhabitants of the Delta did not understand the
speech of Elephantine.

The scenery becomes tamer after the village of Kubtstt" tyeh, on
the W. bank. At el-UMralt, opposite, granite appears for the first
time. Before we reach Assuin the scenery assumes entirely new
aspects. As we approach the city, the scene presented to us is one
of great and peculiar beauty. In front of us lies the S. extremity
of the island of Elephantine (p. 271), with its houses shining from
between the palm trees; the scarlet uniforms ofltritish soldiers and
their white tents, conspicuous at a considerable distance, form a
