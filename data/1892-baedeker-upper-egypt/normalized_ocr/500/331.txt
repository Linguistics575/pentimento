are the reigns mentioned in which they were written. The Greeks generally
wrote merely their names, some of them suggesting a Christian date, 0.9.
TTAXOYMIOS (Pachumios), ITETROS (Petros). We also find a
Â¢|LTJMON (Philemon), EYENOZ (Euenos), and other names, besids
which not more than the common :6 mtiyrry.u'erjia, an act of reverence or
worship, stood. The inscriptions are found for miles, scratched on the
rocks and cmgs of the low hills skirting the river; they are most
numerous to the N. of the village.f

A little to the N. are several Greek Inscriptions, first discovered by
A. C. Harris. These date from the 11th year of the emperor,2) ntonirPt
Pius (149 A.D.), and record that a master-engineer (a'pr, utrj.av7iq). quarried
huge blocks of 11 ells (16 ft.) for the gate (noln) ot Apollo (et Edfu?).

On the W. bank, 114 hr. above el-Hosh and about 3,4 hr. below
Silsileh, is a gorge known as Shatt er-Regal,'Shore of the Men",
or es- sul/a regal,'the seven men'. 0n the left side of a cliff here,
a few paces from the river-bank, is a most interesting relief (also
discovered by Harris) representing the Homage of an inferior king

kher, the uniter of the two lands, and before the king's mother
Aah (moon). Behind Entef is a Chamberlain named Kheti.

This Mentuhotep, with the staff of empire in bis hand, was an im-
portant king; at the close of the 11th Dyn., and his name is mentioned in
all the extant lists of kings. A stele (now at Turin) dating from the doth
year of his reign attests his long and prosperous rule. He seems to have
been the first monarch after a long interval (6th-11th Dyn.) to unite the
whole kingdom under a single seeptre,, and he is thus a worthy predecessor
of the Amenemhas and Usertesens of the 12th Dynasty.

() n the right site of the cliff is the name of Penati, an architect
who worked underAmeuhotep L, TutmesL, and Tutmes II. Farther
up in the same valley occur the signatures of other royal officials,
and also (according to Petrie) the joint cartouchcs of Hatasu
and Tutmes IH., with another mention of Penati below them. _

A second Scene of Homage before King, Rasankhha (CD p 5% Ll),

the successor of Ranebkher or Mentuhotep, is reported by Petrie,
who also discovered other kings' names, some hitherto unknown, on
these rocks.

20 M. Gebel Silsileh (Mountain of the Chain). Though we land
on the W. bank on which the most interesting monuments lie, we
should not omit t0 visit also the E. bank, where there are larger
quarries than on the Libyan side.

At Gebel 8ilsileh begins the Sandstone Zone of the Nile valley (Vol L,
d. 56). The rocky hills which here confine the hed of the river supplied
the material for most of the gigantic buildings we have already visited,
for where monuments exposed to the air were to be erected the Egyptians

f They are published in Flinders Pelrie's'A Season in Egypt' (Lon-
don, 1858).
