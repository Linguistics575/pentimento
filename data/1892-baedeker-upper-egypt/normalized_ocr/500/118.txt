on the throne of Osiris. In front, of him stands Horus,'the avenger of
his father', investing him with immortality, while behind is the Jackal-
headed Apheru (Anubis), ready to protect him from danger. Above the
dedicatory inscription, Thuth, the god of divine eloquence, promises Usiris
'va-ma-Irie" that the Cycle of the Nine Gods will endue him with ever-
lasting life. In the chapel itself the repreeentatiems are very numerous.
The king, in une, appears as a Sphinx, resting: on a base bearing the
names of six nations that he has conquered, A somewhat singular se, e, ne
represents standard-heart-ws with the ensigns of the homes, persunit'ying
the emblems 0t'1ife, constancy, and power in threefold repetition; these,
like the inscriptions between the, standard-poles, teach us that Seti was
endued with courage, length (at days, uninterrupted safety and strength,
victory, abundance, and the kingdom of Egypt for life. It would he weari-
sume to enumerate the multitude nf other inscriptions of a similar tennur.
Among the 22 represente11rms in the king's chapel, many of which are in
a very dilapidated condition. the most noteworthy is i311e in which the
king appears on the throne of Osiris, embraced by the gnddesses Nekheb
(Eileithyia) and Buto. Thoth and Horus draw tighter the stems of the
plants symbolising Upper and Lower Egypt, which ent'uld the sign of union

sam. Safekh, the goddess of history, behind Thnth, inscrihes the name

of the king. 1n another scene Seti is seated on a throne supported by
three figures in the form of Horus and three in the form of Anubis. Un-
der a canopy adorned with Uvtcus-serpents appears the state barge, of the
king, probably a representation of the vessel kept in this temple and home
on high in the prneessiuns. Similar represcniations of the ship in which
the Sun-Gud was supposed lo traverse the heavens have been found made
of bronze OI' the precious metals and may be seen in the museum at Gizeh
(see Baedeker's Lower Egypt) and elsewhere. Below are, canupi (Vol. I., p. 301),
in front sae, rilie, ial offerings, and behind Tuoth and Henmulef. - We,
uhserve that everything here refers to the king, whose name recurs in weari-
some iteration, and who here receives back again as Osiris the offerings
he had himself made, during his murtal life, to Osiris and thus to his
future self, the Jsirirapotheosf1s of his soul.

A door in the Osiris Chapel (P1. e1, the third from the right wall, lends
to the rear-strueture (PI. E) mentioned at p. 62. Though the structure is
in a very ruinous state, its ground-plan can easily be'made out. A colon-
mule, the roof of which, once supported by 10 Columns, has fallen to the
ground, stood in direct connection with the (tsiris chapel. It contains h'? re-
presentations, some of which are almost wholly ell'aeed. By the wall, to
the right on entering, lay three small chambers adorned with fine sculpture.
The first of these (Pl. i) is dedicated to Horus, the second (P1.1r) to Ustris,
the third (P1. 1) to Isis. Behind them lay another room (P1. h). In the

with four columns, Which was adjoined by three smaller apartments (P1. n,
o, p). Though the most sacred mysteries were celebrated in this Suite. of
rooms, they oifer little that is novel; the implements of the priests were
kept in the side-rooms. Here, no doubt, many a spectacle was prepared
which, when displayed in the Usiris chapel, filled the pious worshippers
with awe and wonder.
