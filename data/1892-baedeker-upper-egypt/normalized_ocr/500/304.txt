unknown showed telribly distorted painful features, as if it had died by
poison. In the course of a month all the mummies were unrulled, meas-
ured, described, and covered up again, though whether they will long sur-
vive the process remains to be seen. Excellent photographs of the mum-
mies unrolled were taken by Emil Brugsch, the conservator of the museum.

In Feb. 1801 another large rock-tomh was discovered to the E. of the
temple of Der el-bahri, containing 163 mummies ofpriests and dignitaries
of the 19th, 20th, and 2tstDyn., besides a large number of papyri, Osiris-
statuettes, chests and boxes, baskets of flowers, funereal offerings, etc.
Several of the sarcophagi are elahoraiely adorned with religious scenes.
Judging from the manner in which the sarcophagi were piled upon each
other, and from the fact that several of the mummies are damaged, it is
probable that, like the royal mummies, they were hastily removed from
their original tombs to preserve them from spoliation. The contents of
the tomb are now at Gizeh, where the deciphering ot' the papyri will be
undertaken.

The place contains nothing else worth seeing. as the temple buildings

and of Carsarion the son of Julius Caesar and that queen. The Temple con-

followed by a long room, surrounded hy columns, in the centre of which
