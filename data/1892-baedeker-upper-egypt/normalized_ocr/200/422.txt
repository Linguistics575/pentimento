touehes of Ramses II. and his queen Nefertari. On the architrave
above is the inscription (t0 the left):'The living and good god
punishes the Hanna (Nubians), conquers the land of Nehesi, smites
the s. lands, ploughs the N. lands. King Ramses and his great
consort Nofei-tari Mepen-mut, they have made the temple on the

The pictures on the E, wall Centranee-wall) of this hall resemhle
those in the great temple; to ihe left, the king, before Horus who
hands him the sword of victory, seizes an overthrown Tehennu fy.

Amman, he slays a negro. The legends are almost word for word the
same as those on the architmve. But in both the pictures in this
temple, there appears behind the king the form of his consort No-
ferrari, who is named the Erpat uart, the great princess, of every
grace in her heart, the beloved palm, mistress of both lands, he-
loved of the king, and united with the ruler. Several portraits on
the pillars (to the right) show her to have been of great beauty.
She is represented wearing the fan-erown, the dise and horn crown,
and the secpent-diadem, holding in her right hand a sistrum with
the head of Hathor, and a I1ower-steu1 in her left.

On the S. wall the king appears between the deities Horus, lord

staves, with the notches for the years, and the symbols of eternity.

of this room is a recess, and another at the back In the last is a
remarkable figure of Hathor standing in a temple, with a human
head and above it a enw's head with horns surmounted by the disc
and two fans. The king stands outside the temple, of1'eriilg flowers.

To the N, of the small temple and still on the smoothed part of
the cliff, we observe a tablet on which a prince of Epsh, Ani by
name, a man ot'lihineusu, appears with the fan and princely staff
before Ramses the Great; beside it is a finely executed stele, con-
taining the homage ot' a grandee to the king. To the S. of the great
temple is a passage with a somewhat weather-worn stele facing the
N., dating from the 34th year of the king. This is more especially
interesting from the fact that above, to the right of the king who
sits beneath a canopy between two gods, appears the heautifui
