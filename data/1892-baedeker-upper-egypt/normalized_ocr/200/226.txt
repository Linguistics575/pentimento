'He speaks: come to meAmmon Ra, lord of the throne of the world
of E. Thebes. Look upon thy dwelling, which has been prepared
for thee in the excellent site ofThebes; whose beauty is united with
the region of the deatl'. The inscription is routiuued in the style
of a hymn, extolling what had been done for this temple, and ex-
pr "iug the gorl's 1 rproval ot' the work that was here dedicated to
him. - In the neighbourhood of this stele are numerous blocks
of stone and architectural fragments, which belonged to the rieh
temple of Amenhotep mentioned in the ins'iption. There is no
possibility of reconstrurting the ground-plan of this building, and
the half-buried sph'mx-eoltmyns and broken statues present little
interest. A Still farther to the N.W., at the foot of the Libyan
mountains, two fragments of an ancient brick-building, known as
JLTrrn 51-11230", project like huge horns from the ground, and at a.
distance may easily be taken for the eelossi of Memnon.



13. The Ramesseum.

The *Ramessenm, better known as the Memnoninm of Ramses IL,
lie/s about 1/4 hr. to the N E. of Krhn el-llétén. The route skirts
the fertile land, and the ruin soon appears onspieuonsly on our
right, as we look towards the Libyan mountains. We, pass a small
éanal with a water-wheel worked by a buffalo, which waters the
well-cultivated tields near the llamezseum, as well as a small grove
ofs.un.taud tauiaris -trees to the E. orit. Whether it is approached
from the N. or from the s., the llamesaeum presents a most picturesque
appearance As almost all the side-walls have fallen, it is possible
to obtain a comprehensive view ot' the well-proportioned arrange-
ment of this beautiful temple and to grasp i general architectural
idea, Though time has destroyed much, it is still possible to realize
the form of its main portions .---8o far as the Purpose of the Names-
seum'is concerned, it may be sel'tetl with absolute certainty that
it w ti dedicated to the worship of the maum ufrtasuses, IL, and
stood in the same relation to the tomb of that prince, as the, chapels
at the entrance of the rock tombs of wealthy private citizens to the
adjoining t1usrumy-shafts (ol L, p. 170). TM is clearly indicated by
the position of the monument, by the yrocessirur with image: of an-
cestors at the festival ot' the staircase, an the N. part ut' the W. side
of the second pylon, by the list at the sons t' the Pharaoh, and by
the ceiliug-eariings in the last rooms of this cuemnoniuns. Finally
several inscriptions inform us that the Ramesseum 1esembled the
temple whirh Ramses the Great vowed in gratitude for his rescue
out afthe hands of the Jiheta who had surrounded him (p. 1 (il).

The question has bees, much discussed whether the Rmnessenm is to be
identii'usd with the Tomb of Osymgudyas minutely described by Diodorus.
