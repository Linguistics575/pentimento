vi PREFACE.

HEIGHTS above the sea-level and other measurements are
given in English feet or miles.

Though nearly every page of the Handbook has been
compiled from personal observation and experience, and
although the conservative East is not nearly so liable to
changes as the more progressive West, the Editor makes no
claim to absolute accuracy in every detail; and he will feel
indebted to any traveller who, from personal experience,
may be able to indisrtererr0rrrirbtuissiorrs in the Handbook.
The same remark applies equally-to the PRI'CES and various
items of expenditure mentioned in the'volume. The expense
of a tour is much more directly aireetlurby the circumstances
of the moment { 1nd the' jndiv'iamlity, 6f the traveller in the
East than in Eurtrpej: tlirn! gh it ma luis be added that the
arrangements of Messrs. "Cook um; Gtize (pp. XIV. xv), of
which most visitors to Upper Egypt will avail themselves,
offer a comparative immunity against extortion. A carefully
drawn up contract will similarly protect those Who prefer to
hire a dhahobtyeh for themselves.
