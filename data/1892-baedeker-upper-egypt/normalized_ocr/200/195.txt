at Thebes, KARNAK 11. Route. 131

In the second row, to the right, the king in his chariot dashes
against the 6iseorniited foe, and aims a blow at ahostile leader,
distinguished by a feather. Next the king on foot deals the ijishing
blow with his lance to an oiiteer, who has been brought to his knees.
To the left the victorious monarch fares homewanl.'preceded by
two rows of prisoners, named'hi anta en tahi'. The small figure
behind the chariot is the erowu-prirlee Ramses. Then follows the
presentation of the prisoners, who are called Retennu and Tahennu
(i e eryst; u-eoloured, white), to Ammou, Muth, and Khunsn, who
also receive the captured gold and vessels. - Similar represents-
tions occupy the lowest row. To the right is the pursuit of the
Kheta in their chariots The inscription ahove compares the king
to Sutekh and Baal, to a Wolf and a Iron, that roams through the
by-paths, to a bull that destroys the enemy in their blood. To the
left is the homeward journey. The king leads captives on foot, and
behind. him is a chariot containing fettered prisoners, and preceded
bitwo rows of the same. He brings his captives to the Thehan triad,
who are here accompanied by the goddess'Mat. There also are He-
tennu, brought by the king from the land of Kheta'to till the lordly
palace of Ammon'.

e. The older E. part of the Temple of Ammon.
1. From the Hypostyle Hall to the Sanctuary.

We now return to the central row of lofty columns with the
ealyx-eapitals, and follow it eastwards to Pylon Ill., which Wir pass
through onour way towards the sanctuary, like the more highly pri-
vileged worshippers admitted to the temple in early times. This
part of the temple has been terribly destroyed, but enough has been
left standing to afford an idea of the general arrangement. The
picturesque effect of the ruinous scene is enhanced by the variety
of artistic forms employed, and by the tall and slender shape of the
largest obelirk in Egypt, rising from the midst of the ruins, and
testifyingto thepast proud splendour ofthistvaly royal edifice, which
h - teen ruthless' ttodden under foot by the monotonous cycle of
years and shattered by war and earthquakes. - The nearer we
approach to the sanrtuary the older are the parts of the temple W6
traverse. The inscriptions afford materials for ascertaining the date
of each diirerent portion; white the practised eye will not tind it
difficult to support the conclusions thus arrived at by comparison
of the succe'e styles of art. We here (irid the polygonal pillax-
column and the finely carted bud -columus, bearing clear and un-
mi, takeable evidence as to the idea, to which this order owed its
origin, The third pylon seems to have marked the limit of the
temple under the early empire, before the gigantic buildings of
the 19th Dyn. were added. The W. side f this Pylon. within the
great hyposty1e-hall, still shows the inn: ous made in the wall
