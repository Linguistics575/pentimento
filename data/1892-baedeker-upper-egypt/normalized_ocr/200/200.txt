well as from the W., and even for those advancing through the
series of pylons on the S. -It is improbable that Camhyses caused
the destruction of this'heact' of the worship of Ammon, if we may
use that expression, anti Neetaneblls, who was a mighty builder
would certainly have restored it, had it been injured. On the other
hand, nothing is more likely than that one of the later Persian
kings selected this temple for destruction after some abortive in-
surrection on the part of the Egypt us, in order to punish the 1'8-
hellions province in its most sensitive part. Ptolemy Soter, who
held the reins for Philip Aridmus, could have Found no easier way
to win the hearts of his new subjects than to restore the holy places
destroyed by the Persians; while to do so was to imitate Alex-
ander the Great. In this particular ruse the work was not diflir: ult,
for though new sculptures had to he provided for the adytmu, its
walls were for the most part still standing. in the dedieation-
inscription in the interior of the sanctuary, Philip records merely
that he had restored with granite the sanctuary which was falling
to ruin,'which was built in the time of Tutmes 111.. king of
Upper and Lower Egypt'; and a fragment of the older structure,

the reddish stone. Ammon in both his main characters (Amman
Generator and Ammon king of the gods) receives the homage of
Philip, or rather of the representative of the royal house of Macedon,
for it is certain that Philip never entered the Talley ot' the Nile. Mull:
of course also appears with Ammon, anti once is depicted as
embracing him, an absolutely unique representation. The traveller
will see with surprise in this sacred spot bl, representation of the
king, under the auspices ot'h'hmim, catching birds with a net, and
promising to bestow his booty upon Ammon.

The Exterior Watts of the holy ofholies are covered with numer-
ous low reliefs and inscriptions, not easily seen on aecottnt of the

in solemn procesamn to the sanctuary, and the king offering four
calves of diirerent colours (perhaps symbolizing the nations of the
