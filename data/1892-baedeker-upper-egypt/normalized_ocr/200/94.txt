Abu Gansheh to (151m) Abuksah (see below) and thence to Fen-
Wr and (71,2 M.) Tirseh is used almost exclusively for the con-
veyance of sugarcane to the manufaetories of the Khedive. Trav-
ellers going by railway (one train daily from Medineh to Ahuksah,
starting about noon, and perforruiug the journey in about Ihr,)
must take horses with them for the continuation of their journey.
The following routes are all practicable, but the third is to be
preferred'. -

(1) We proceed by land via Nezteh [ where boats must be ordered
for the passage of the lake) to Kay Kun'in; then by water to
Dtmeh, and again by water to the S. bank of the lake, situated in
the latitude of .SenMir, which lies about 4 M. inland. The horses
should be sent on from Kate! Jiurrin to the lake [ unless the some-

to ynho, and thence to Medinet el-Faytun. Four or tIve days are
required for the excursion; the points of interest are mentioned in
the third route. The road from Nezleh (see below) to Keg: liurtm

hounded by large mud-hms, to the 1ake (21/2hrs.), where we spend
