An inscription (on the outside of the E. girdle-wall) states that
this beautiful monument (the present temple) lay behind (is. pro-
bably to the S. of) the building of his father; another Con the in-
side of the same wall) records that the foundatiou-stone was laid
in the time of Ptah in the holy place of Tes Her for the God Ra;
and l third (on the inside of the N. girvlls-wall) informs us (on the

great writing that fell from heaven to the b. of Memphis', and (on
the right) that'this great wall was built according to the book of
the arrangement of tetuples, written by the thrhcb Imhotep, son at

The Nags, still to be found in the holy of holies (p. Zia), bears
the name-rings of Nettanebus I. (373-360 KC.) and probably
dates from the original temple. The doeument, inscribed on the
outside of the E. wall of the temple, relating to the gifts of lands,
mentions King Darius as well as Neetanebus 1. and Nectariebns II.
as hcnefacturs of the temple.

Two accounts of the building of the present temple have come
down to us, The shorter of these occurs on the outside of the W.
wall of the temple proper, in the second line of the lower marginal
inscription, dating from the time of Ptolemy IX. Euergetes II _
the other, at greater detail, in the one-line lower Marginal In-
seripliorh, en the outside of the W. girdle-wall. 1n the second in-
scription we read as follows:

'On this beautiful day of the opening of the building in the 10th year

The decoration of the walls with hierngiyphics and reliefs and the

are noted as follows:

'The inscribing of its walls with well-executed sculpture of the
