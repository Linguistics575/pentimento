Temple. DEXDERAH. h Route. Sl

Avillius Flaccus, the governor Aulus Fnivius Crispus, and the dis..
ttict-governor Sarapion Tryeharnbos, the inhabitants of the capital
and of the Home dedicated the Prouaoa to the great goddesshphro-
dite and her fellow-gods. in the twentieth (?)'year of the Emp. Ti-
berius....' An inscription recently found by Diimichen on the
E. side of the temple informs us that this outer wall of the temple
was deodated in the second year of the Emp. Tiberius Claudius
(i2 ADJ. There are, however, many representations of the Emp.
Nero both inside and outside the temple. The crypts of the temple
date from the reigns of PtolemyX., Ptolemy SI., and Ptolemy XIII.
(Soter ll.; Ptolemy Alexander: Neos Dionysus). The inscriptions
running round the temple refer to Ptolemy XVI. Cmsarion and the
Emp. Augustus. On the exterior of the rear-wall of the temple ap-
pears Ptolemy Kisres, aerompauied by Cleopatra VI. and the little
Ctesarion; the inscription is Ptulmis, surnamed Kisres. In both
cases the Cmsarion referred to is apparently the son of Csesar and
Cleopatra. The temple would thus seem to owe its present form to
the late of the Ptolemies and the first Roman emperors. It is, how-
ever. obvious that the site was previously occupied by older temple
buildings, going back to the earliest period of Egyptian history.
King Pepi of the (ith Dynasty is repeatedly represented in the crypts.
In one of these crypts (No. 9) the ancient building plan of Den-
derah is mentioned twice. The itrst of these mentions occurs in the
deseriptiou of an excursion of the goddess to Edfu on the first of
Epiphi: "The great building-plan (semi) of Ant (Denderah) was
found written in ancient characters on hide, of the time of the suo-
cessors of Horus. Found in the interior of the Wall of the royal
palace in the time of King Pepi'. Another passage reads:'The
great plan of IJeuderah. a restoration of the monument made by
King ftameukheper (Tutmes Ill0, after it "as found in ancient
characters of the time of King Khufu'. The priests ofTentyra thus
ascribed the foundation of their temple to Khufn and Pepi. There
are, however, stones bearing the names of Amenemha 1., Tut-
mes IH., Tutmes IV., Ramses IL, and Ramses 111., all of whom
prohahly either built or restored parts of the old temple.

If we compare the temple of Denderah with a similar structure
of the earlier period, such as the temple of Ahydos or the great
national sanctuary wf Karnak, we lind it not less beautiful in its
own way, though of course far from competing with these gigantic
structures in magnificence or extent. Its chief characteristics are a
fiue symmetry of proportions and dignified adaptation to its pttr-
poses. A happy blending of Egyptian seriousness with Grecian
grace, which meets us unmistakably at every turn, has a peculiarly
pleasing eifeet. and we feel much more at home in the hails of the
Mather of Teutyra than in the great hall of the god of Thebes, with
its forest of gigantic columns. Neither the figures nor the inscrip-
tions sculptured Oil the walls compare in masterly execution with
