Memnoninm atAbydos, which contains no fess er than 76 tmrtvnrhes,

only two of which are slightly injured. The tablet from the temple

of Haruses (p, (E), now in London, contains 10 entire and 2 half
destroyed cartouches, while the list of Satsl.iirah, discovered by Ma-
riette, has 39 whole and 3 damaged oartouehes,

_ Mena, 112. Menus, the first historic king ofEgypt, heads
the list. The names following his are those of the most
prominent: monarchs, at least those whose 1cgitirnarry was

NWW' unquestionable. The llemeleopolitans and the Hyksos arc
naturally left out, but other rulers, of Whom we possess
monuments, have also been ayparently deemed unworthy of
inclusion in this important roll of honour. The merit of

Â£4 first observing and pnhlishing this inestimable histnrivnl
document belongs to Prof. Diimiehen.

0n the Left wall of the tzvrridor we again meet Seti and the
youthful Ramses. The father holds a censer in his Iefthaml, while
the son, adorned with the priestly panther-skin, pours alihation on
the alter in front of him, The titles of the right wall re-appear
here. The inscription, whivh the royal pairfaecs, containsin syste-
matic order the names of those objeets ot' worship, with their homes,
whom Seti has honoured with saerYutial gifts. The sculpture in this
corridor, consisting of alto-reliefs on the"1ue-gra1icd limestone, is
all executed with the greatest delicacy. 1n the venue of the right
wall a door leads into a nan'ow Chamber (Pl. t ], vaulted in the same
manner as the sanctuaries o. 6t), and preceding the stair CPI. u)
whieh leads to the hill at the bank of the temple. The inscriptions
here are in excellent preservation, being- injured only in a few places;
the adjoining figures of Seti Mill Ramses show thn: latter arrived at
manhood and the throne. Safekh, the goddess of history,'the great
mistress of books", mldresses her darling sou Seti. The ceremony "
foundation, which we find more fully represented and deseribrul ill
the Ptolemaie temples, is also depicted here. The praises ofthe king
are sung, and his merits ave, at the eommand of 11a, to be t'muniittetl
to writing by the, goddess of history. Thotl1 also eongratnlates the
king in the emphatic manner usual to suehinseriptions, and promises
him an eternal existence and the stability ofhis kingdom for hundreds
of thousands of years. Thoth is named the tongue of Ita and lord
of the speech of the prophet of truth. This stairt'ase was completed
while Ramses shared the throne of his father as eo-ruler.

The other rooms of this part of the building an) all more vrlms
in ruins. From the S. eud of the kings' gallery we enter a kind of
peristyle Court LPI. J), with seven nolumns, which perhaps was
never rompletetl, The sculptures and hieroglyphics are not very
carefully executed aud appear im areux' instead "in high relivi'.
The, most interesting smeites are those on tlu: lower part of the walls,
representing the slaughtvr ol' the cattle, gawlles, and mttelopes
whirh Seti had so lavishly vowed tin the adjoining, king's gallely)
