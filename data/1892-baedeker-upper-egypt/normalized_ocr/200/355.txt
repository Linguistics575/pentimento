from their native rock, this final operation being probably accom-
plished with the aid oi' wet wedges. Such an Obelisk, still attached
to the rock, may be seen about taM. to the s. of the town and
about as far to the Fi. of the Nile. It is not easily found, as it is
frequently more than halr-cm-erenl with sand. At its broadest part
this obelisk measures 10511; it: length is 92 ft. (72 ft. cut out),
not reckening the pyramidal top, which has already been hewn. The
economy of material on the part of the stone-cutters is noteworthy
In the quarry near the road and visited by all travellers, is a huge
Block of Rock, from which the mason has begun to hew both a
roofing-slab and a column. Ilere we elearlypereeive that the ancients
well understood how to disintegrate the granite with borers and to
split it with wedges. Numerous holes were made in a fixed line
(probably with the help of draw-boring), the damp wooden wedges
were driven in, and in this manner tolerably even fractures were ob-
tained. The art of splitting the stone by heat was also understood.

The Chapel transported from Elephantinc (Le, Acsn n) to Safe by
Aahmes (26th Um.) was especially celebrated, and is mentioned by Hern-
dotus (n, 175). It consisted of a single block and its transport occupied

We turn to the rightCWO from the quarries and follow the broad
sandy road leading S. to Philac. The desert has a wonderful pre-
serving Tirme. If the mad along which the traveller new rides were
practicable for carriages, Strabo's Alesrriptien would still fit it in
every point.'We drove', writes the aneientgeogi'apher,'from Syene
fAssuin) to Phila, through a wry flat plain about 50 stadia long.
At many points all along the road, and on both sides, we saw the
rounded, smooth, and almost conical blocks ot' dark, hard rock, re-
sembling f1errne-towers, from which mortars are made. aller
blocks lie upon larger ones, and support others in their turn; hem
and there were isolated blue s', ctr. - To this we need only add
that pious pilgrims and wayt'nrers lime ehiselled their Names turd
short Inscriptions on many of the ahove-mentionetl blocks. Princes,
dignified priests, and warriors, lune travelled this way, as fax back
as the times of the Amenemhlw and l'sertesens. Down to a late
period pilgrims were in the habit of placing inwriptions on these
stones, accompanied with the representation "the soles of the feet.
