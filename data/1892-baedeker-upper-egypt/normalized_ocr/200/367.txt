The W. Obelisk, as we have said, remai _ in silu though it has
lost its point. Upon it is ins: med, in Greek, a petition from Theo-
dotos, son ofAgesiphon, to Isis and her fellow-gods, dating front the
time of Neos Dionysus. There are also some Arabic inscriptions.

The hypwthral vestibule was bounded on each side (E. and wo
by six columns and one of the obelisks. The six W. columns are
still standing, but only three stumps ot' the E. row remain. Between
the column; were screen-walls, half as high as the shafts, and
adorned with concave cornice: and halustrades of Uraurs-serpents.
The columns, only 21/6 ft. in thickness, are 151/3 ft. high, and have
Calyx-capitals supporting an abacus decorated with the Ilathor-
mask, on which rests a small chapel. These capitals, which re <
semble those of the Ptoieruaie epoch, are specially remarkable, as
they were erected by Nectanebns before the period of the Lagitizu.
Nectanebus who maintained himself for some time in opposition to
the Persian kings, appears to have delighted in comparing hiuocelt'
to the ancient Pharaoh as we may gather from his first name Ita,
kheper'a, which was also that of Usertesen L of the 19th Dyn.;
and it is possible that he adopted, in the same spi it, old and for-
gotten artistic farms in his erections It is certain that the Hathor-
mask at the top of the columns is only found earlier than his time
on the monuments of the 18th Dyn. at Dér el- bahri (b. 223) and
el- Kit, (p. 236). The architects of the Ptoleuties were afterwards at-
tracted by the abacus adorned with the countenance of the goddess
ofDenderals, adopted it, and farther developed the sculptured caiys-
capital, here first introduced by Sectanebus. - 0n the W. and lit
sides of each of the ~ix standing columns are tiedication-insrriptions.
0n the outer (W.) side ofthe mest southerly column (next to the
obelisk) is the inwriptian:'The good god, lord of both worlds,
Ra-kheper- a, son of the sun and lord of the diadems, Nectanebus,
the erer-lrving, erected this sumptuous building for his mother
Isis, the bestowcr of life. in order to enlarge her dwelling with ex-
cellent work, for time and for eternity". - 0n the outer side of the







third column the name of Philze appears as Aleko d (with the

article, P-ao), a form found at many other place=c > and the mistiess
