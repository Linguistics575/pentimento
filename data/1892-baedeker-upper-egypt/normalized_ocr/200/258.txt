The building, though small, is distinguished by its harmonious
forms. About [ 35 paces to the NE is the well-known Fresh Wulm'
Spring, a pool to "hid:, subterranean passage leads. It is a re-
markahle fart that the freshness of the water remains entirely Inl-
atfeeted by the saline uxudntions from the ground, even in the ne-

To the S. of the temples oi Medinetnabu are traces of nSurmi

The Tombs of the mes are in every way less important than those

a visit tn the former, for which at least il/g hr. is necessary, renders it
almost impnssihle to complete the lint day's programme on the West

The road from Metlinet-llabu to the Tombs of the Queens crosses

the gods of the regions ot' the dead, and date from the 19th and
20th Dynasties. The Tombs of the Queens belong to the same
period, except a few which are of the [ 8th Dynasty. Altogether
