the complete rebuilding of the. temple at Etifu was accomplished "ithln
the period of 180 years, a months, and 14 days.

As a kind of pendant or companion-piece to this long histortear
inscription of the W. girdle-wall, there appears another no less in-
teresting Inscriytion at the foot of the E. Girdle Wall (P1. k). This
second inscription, which has a total length oi'2M) ancient Egyptian
ells, contains tt summary account of the whole temple, followed by
a detailed description of each of its rooms. Like alt dedicatory in-
scriptions of the kind, it begins with the name of the monarch
under whom the monument it refers to [ in the present case, the
girdle-walt) was completed.

The inscription begins as follows:'The golden Horus, Who shows
himself in heaven as the wing-spreading god of Edh1, clad in bright
plumage, he has taken possession of his abode... prepared by .t. Pto-
lemy AU. Alexander r.'

erected by His Majesty and his father, is formed like the srtu-urorrataia

Bear (the N. constellation)'. The early Egyptian architects seem to
have been guided hy these two constellations in determining the
orientation of any new temple, as appears to be indicated with some
certainty by inscriptions at EMu. The laying of the fourrGtiou-
stone of an early Egyptian temple was a CBT (5ir10lly of peculiar solem-
nity, in which the king himself, as has been observed in the IC-
count of Dentietuh (p. 86), took part; and even in the case of
temples built at A time When the rulers of Egypt had ceased to
share personally in these ceremonies (as eg. under the Roman ern-
perors who did not live in Egypt at all), the inscriptions still some-
times speak in the old-fashioned style as though the monarch had
duly performed his part. An inst-riptitm along the foot of the wall
in Hall D states that'His Majesty in his proper person, with his
hand on the wooden peg and holding the line in his grasp, along
with the goddess Safekh, is to be found beside his measuring-in-
strument to determine the four corners of the temple at Edfu'. This
N. and S. axis divides the entire building into a right and a left
(or W. and H) half, reckoned from Room I (p. 252), which occupies
the exact centre of the Tear-wall of the temple, and is named in
the inscriptions'divider of the middle'. All the walls and rooms
to the right of this line (as welook S.) are described in the iosesip-
