beautiful horses. The slaughter which he causes is immense, and,
sis far as the vividness of the representation goes, may well be Cou1-
pared with the similar subjects at Karnak and the Ramesseum,
though it is inferior in point of style.

Higher up is an inscription from the 11th year of the king; and here
also the long rows of hieroglyphics are more concerned with extolling
the king than with relating events, The Wat- is mice more against the
western peoples, the Libyans, hie (us (llashauasht0, etc. The leaders of
the toe are the Libyan prince Italrur and his son Ntishashar. The op-
ponents of Phamuh were (according to the inscription un the N, Pylon)
utterly routed, and lost miserably both property and iire,'while the
whole earth reiuiced as it beheld the hemism of King Ramses IU.' The
world bowed before the king, who is compared to Itaal, who punishes
the impious. The conquered are compared to a flock of goats attached
by a lion. The endless pictorial laaduious or the victor are positively
wcarisome, while the representations or the defeat, impotence, and over Â»
throw of the conquered are inmost equally abundant. Finally the king
hamngnes the leaders of his foot-soldiers and chariuteers, not forgetting
tu celebrate in swelling wuvds the deeds that. he himself has done. The
number of prisoners and slain (the latter with their hands, ete, cut cm
is recorded. One of the lists accompanying the inscription includes one
prince of the Mashauasha, 5 superior otheess, 1205 common soldiers, 152
inferior oflicecs, 131 young men, 1194 in all. Also 312 Women, b5 young
women, 15t girls, 558 in all. These frgr1res give a total at 2,032 persons.
Besides these 2175 Mashunasha were slain by the kine in their ranks.
The total loss (If the enemy ms thus not more than ihi persons. The
number of captured swords, bows, chariots, eta, corresponds: 115 large
swords, 121 smaller, W3 bows, etc.

Another series occupies the bitck-Wal ] of the cohyurtruie 0n the right
01,) side of the court, supported by seven pillar with the Osiris llgures
of the kin The uppermost rnW contains sa' ial scenes. The hrst Of
these depicts the king, who has alighted (mm his r'haru'0r, shootirvg his mnws
against a hostile fortress oucupiad by Warrim's (the town Amara, recening
the Ainorites). 1n the next scene the king drags three rows ut prisoners
behind his chariut. He is congratulated by the grandecs. Finally he
presents the captives to Amman, Nuth, end Khunsu.

The inscriptions and sculptures on the Second Pylon CPI. E),
enclosing the rear of the court, are still more iriterestinu_ To the
left are Ammon Ru and Muth, the great queen of heaven, to whom
Pharaoh, wearing a richly decorated crown, leads three rows of
captives chained together. The two upper rows have distinctly
European features, and wear embroidered apruns and low helmets.
Over the ficst row no name appears, bat according to the inscription
before Pharaoh, they are Shakalsha, .6. probably b'rerlisns. The
captives in the second row are caned Tanauna "Deneuna, a name
in which we are probably correct in recognizing the'Damu", 0r
Hellenes of the Trojan era, The third row, in which the individual
figures re emble those of the other two, is accomgauied by the
following inscription:'Provide breath for our nostrils, 0 king, son
of Amman, say the foes from Pulssata'. In these Palasata we must
recognize the Plruistines, new and no contemptible toes of Egypt,

On the Right Wing of the second pylon is another long in-
