The next room, alrnost square. is entirely hewn out of the rock,
six square pillars being left in two rows in the centre. The arehi-
trave above the pillars contains the customary dedieMion-insrrip-
tion. On the right we read:'The living Hor- la, the strong lord of
both lands beloved by Ma' who rules Egypt and has conquered the
nations, the gold-hawk, rich in years, great in victories, the king
of Upper and Lower Egypt, Ranrses H., has reared in memory of
his father Harmachis the Hut Rumessu merumort in Pa Ra,'Pa
IW is thus the holy name of the spot and'temple of Ramses Mera-
mon' the name of the sanctuary. On the left architrave Ammon-lla
is mentioned instead of Irarmaehis, as lord of the throne ot' both
lauds, so that the temple must be regarded as dedicated to both
deitie", On the six pillars arc i) gures of the king before Tum, Ptah,
Khnum, and other gods. On the right side-wall is the boat of Har-
machis borne by 12 priests and conducted by the king; on the left
side-wa the king, in a boat, offering incense. From this chamber
a large door. surmounted by the winged sun-rlisc, leads into the
sanctuary, and doors to the right and left admit to smaller apart-
ments. l'our seated tigures occupy the rear-wall of the sanctuary,
vir.. (beginning to the left) Ptah, Ammon-Ra, the king, and 1m.
machis with the hawk's headl They are all represented full face,
and would be 1iriicult to identify were it not for the iuseriptions
adjoining _ Not far from the temple is a small iouk-stelei dedi-
cated to the king's son Amenem/teb, with the figure of a temple.

Beyond Den the Nile valley again turns to the SW. To the
right is the Hand of Tomas. Crocodiles now become more numetu
nus, looking from a di~tznce like tree-tranks or like huge frogs, A
nearer view is only to be obtained by rowing on ahead of the dhaha-
hiyeh in the felukeh or small boat. At Ellestyeh (E. bank), also
called ed-Duknesrah, is a rotk-tomt, of the 18th Dynasty On a stale
here, dating from the 43rd year of Tutmes LIL, the king presents

Abu. The wall-paintings represent the king seated between Aluth
and Uar, then otleriug to Ilorus, lord of the land of lx'hent, to Horus
of Mam, and to Thoth and llathor.

On the W. bank, oppocite Ketleh, we next see an ancient ruined
fort. Then to the right is the verdant island of Abu Ihis, and to
the left the village of -

the W. (left) is a narrow strip ofpalms and castor-oil plants, beyond
which is the desert. Hn the W. bank, alittle inland from the village
