The following representation is one of the most remarkable in
Egypt, for it clearly proves that a kind of Sues Canal, i.e. a canal
dividing Africa from Egypt, existed as early as the time of Seti I.
The relief represents the king on his homewartl journey. His
spirited horses prance along before the light chariot, which carries
only the Pharoali and the heads of h s slain enemies. (The king's
favourite he is named'Ammon gnes the sword'.) In his left hand
the king hold the reins and his bow, and in bis right the sword of
victory, the scourge. and a number of cords to which pinioned
enemies are fastened. Three of the latter he drags after him, and
three rows of Asiaties fastened together by the treck precedes the
horses. The bastion: with reservoirs which the procession has to
yes. are represented at the foot of the relief, in accordance with the
peculiar Egyptian system of perspective. The desert-station imme-
diately heside the hint ] hoofs ot' the king's horse is called Migliol of
King liamenma, (Mimlol is a Semitic word meaning a fonitied tower
generally.) Between the hind and foreleg: of the horses appeir:
another fortress, called the castle of the lions. The train of tetilt'u-
ing warrior; is separsted from their Egyptian t'atlierland by a canal
full of crocodiles. That this is not merely all arm of the Nile is hr-
dicated by an in nption above the bridge. to the right, which
names it Ta fenat, i .liteially'the cutting'. The crocodiles, which
do not live in salt water, show that this canal was supplied from
the le; and the two groups of figures on the farther bank show
that it marked the boundary of Egypt, In the impor group are
yriests and grsmlees, with curious nosogay: in their hands, who
await the Pharaoh with low oheisances: in the lower group the
women raise theit hands in greeting to the returning king, who
brings with him their husbands and sons. The inscription runs:
'The priests, the great ones, and the princes of Upper and Lower
Egypt approach to welcome the good god (Le. the king) on his re-
turn from the Syrian land, with enormous booty. Never has the
like happened since the time of the god','e.prohab1y since the
time of Ra. - The'cntting' which thus divided Aria and Africa
can only be the canal by means of which the early Pharaohs eo-
