of Isis. PIIIL/E. 29. Route. 293

Sky-blue, light-green, tun ] a light and a dark shade of red are the
prevailing colours; but Jese were di, rthuted according to conventional
rulest Although vegetable forms are imitated with admirable iidelity,
the artists did not shrink from colouring them with complete disregard
to nature, simply because ancient convention demanded it. Light-green
pathwtgs receive blue ribs, and blue flowers have bhte, red, or yellow
petals. Below the aunuli on the shaft is, kind or band [ found also else-
where), indicating that the vegetable forms surrounding the core of the
capital were supposed to he ihut1ly bound tn the top ofthe sham The
height and ornamentation of thelower parts otthe shafts arc the same in
all the columns; but the capitals, some of which are beautiful palm-
capitals, are varied.

On the Ceiling are astronomical representations. The entire hall
bears the inscriptions of Ptolemy IX. Euergetes Il.-dbore the
door in the back wall leading to the promos is a long Inscription,
carved over the hieroglyphirs by the Italian Expedition orf8dl.
The Christian successors of the pri 3 e of Isis have cut numerous
Coptic crosses in the walls to signalize their appropriation of the
temple and to guard against the cunning malice of the heathen
deities. Christian services were celebrated in this hall. A Greek
inscription in the doorway to the pronaos, on the right, records
that the good work [ probably the plastering up of the reliefs and
the prepa' tion ot' the hall for Christian worship) took place under
the abbot Tbeodorus, This was in the reign of Justinian.

i. The Chambers of the Pronaost The three successive rooms
of the promos date from Ptolemy ll. Philadelphr1s. The First
Room (P1. r) was adjoined on each side by others. That on the
right. now destroyed, was connected with a Second Room (P1. s),
en the E. wall of which Philadelphus is shown presenting a great
offering to his mother Isis. In the mom to the left (Pl. t), in which
the staircase to the roof starts, Philadelphus appears before Isis and
before Hathor, The next room to the left is a dark chamber, Right
round the foot of the wall in the following wide Third Haunt (PL u),
immediately before the sanctuary, runs rt list of nemes, The doors
on the right and left of this room admit to long, narrow, dark
aputruents, perhaps used M''l'reusure-Chmnbers. The entrance to
that on the left (Pl. w) is about 2 ft. from the ground. The visitor
should enter, strike a light, and inspect the sculptures itt this
t-hamber which resembles a huge stone chest. The lower part of
the wall is smooth, as it was- t'onecalcd by the treasures stored here;
but higher up Ptolemy II. Philadelphus caused the walls to be
adorned with elegant reliefs and inscriptions.
