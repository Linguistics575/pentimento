The tomb of Renni, still farther to the left (W.), contains
numerous representations of interest. The deceased, a son of a lady
named Aahmes and father of another Aahmes, was a prince (erpzt
ha) and a large lauded proprietor. Two ohelisks seem to have stood
at the entrance to this vault; and the statue of the deceased is to
be seen in its recess.

The roof of the chapel is vaulted, and covered like the walls with a
thin mat of stuccns On which the representations and inscriptions Were.
painted. On the right wall are the funeral of Renui and other FCEIIPS
connected with his death, While an the left wall are scenes from the life
of the deceased, who ztucumpauied hy his dog, surveys his possessions.
Here apyem his carriage, his serfs busied in tilliug the gruund, and his
family in friendly union. Beside each of the persons waited on by the
servants of the deceased appcars his name and his relationship to the,
head (if the family. Among the livestock belonging to I'teuni 1500 swine
are mentioned, a circumstance which appears somewhat surprising at
ilrst, for, the flesh of swine was an article of diet as strictly forbidden
(u the, Egyptians its to the, Jews. Rentsi, however, Was a prophet of
Heheut, and hard to provide swine In he sruyrir'ced to this goddess, Which
accounts { or his possession of the otherwise ahhorred animals This re-
xnarkahle "irryuuuetaatus did not escape the notice of Herodotus, who
writes'They saeritiee swine to no gods except Sulcne (goddess of the
moon, Frebent) and Dionysus; making this sacrifice to the moon al-
wiws at ull moon, at which time they also eat swine's flesh. The Egypr
tiitus assign a particular reason for ahhurring swine at other festivals
and olrerin, e them at this one, huttalthough I know it I am not permitted
to reveal it', Herodotus Wits hmuul by an oath not to rcvcal the mystery,
from which, however, we may I'm able to lift the veil hy a study of the
monuments. it is related the yplmn (Seth), while hunting by moonlight,
fell in with the atrorf'u1 of Usi s, and hewed the corpse into M parts, Le.

left eye of Horus, and, as the inscriptions explain, it was in jeopardy
rm the 13th night, tie. the time of the full moon. It had heen observed
that solipsos of the 11100I1 affected the light only of the fall moon, and
thus arose the myth that Seth Typhon, in the farm of a swine, attacks
the orb of night at the full menu and endeavours to swallnw it. The

other Egyptian customs are also to he explained hy reference to the
contest betwixt Horus and Seth.

The last three tombs farther to the 1eft (WJappear to date from
the 13th Dyn., and are therefore much more ancient than those
just described, unless we regard the Ci-wth Dyn. as ruling in
Upper Egypt contemporaneously with the Hyksos in Lower Egypt.
The first Was erected to a lady named Scbeknefrlt, by her father

Brugsuh has published the contents of a State from the rearvwall of
this tomb, in Which Beha records the mat si, of his household, and
also his distribution of grain during a long-continued famine. To recog-

brethren to Egypt, is entirely gratuitous. In the last tomb to the left,
