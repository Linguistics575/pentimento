Temple. ABU-SIMBEL. 33. Route. 337

behind which are painted four tigures, viz Ptah (to the left), Am-
man in blue, King Ramses, and Haruaaehis. No one should omit
to enjoy the mysterious effect of the interior view of this temple,
with its eight Osiris-statues, as seen by the light of torches or a
magr1esim11-lart1p.

We now climb over fallen stones and heaps ofs; uld to the smaller
temple, which lie; a little to the N.

The *SmallerRock Temple of Ahu-Simbel lies Hose to the river.
The cliff has here been smoothed for a breadth of 90 ft. to make
room for the facade of this attractive temple oflIathur.'hich in
modest contrast to liamsesls huge monument, will not fail to pro-
Jaco a satisfactory impression. The six statues en the Grade do
not project boldly like the to ] i of the great temple, but stand in
niches supported on projecting pillars. Moreover it is not only the
king that is here represented; to the right and left ofhim stand
female ti, eures equally large in which we recognize his consort No-
ferturi Merimmut. The latter holds a sistrum in her hand and wears
a double headdress with horns twisted round a dice, such as is worn
by Hauler, goddess of love, whose representative the queen is. The
heures m the corners represent Imutses again; on the left in his
usual form with a dagger in his girdle, and on the right as a dei-
Iierl king, with a crown consisting of the double feather springing



from the sun, and the twisted horns. Besides the six co-

l0ssi there are a number of much smaller statues of the children of
the king and queen. Beside the cnlossi 0n the right and left of the
door are the two eldestsons of the king, viz. (on the rightrlmenhi-
/caopesbf (Ammon iu hissword) and (on the left) Rummmemifata at
his left hand); beside the outer rolnssi are the princes Merllum
(right) and.llerira (left); and beside each of the t'nlossi of the queen
are statue Â» of the priuI-esses .lleritumon (rigl1t) and llantltuli (left),
with stra in their ham The hrst and thin ] pillars on the right
