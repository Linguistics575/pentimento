river to the s. ot'Philie, 01m can sympathize with the question of
the linen-elarl Aehoreus in Luann: Who would have supposed that
thou, 0h', rently-i1owiug Nile, wouldst burst forth with violent
Whirlpools into such wild rage".' When the river is high all the
rocks in the bed of the stream are under water; but in l'elnnmry
and March even the smaller rorks are vi ltln. Inscriptions are found
on many of these, and on all the eatataet-islan e, twenty in number.

rocks between this point and Phila? will not esmpe notice.

A similar effect was npticcd by Alexander von Humboldt at the
cataracts of the Orinoco.'The granite hf min', says R. Ilartmaun,
'like that at the southern cataracts, etc., is distinguished by the remark-
ahly rounded shape nf the blocks. These hare surfaces as Smnoth as
glass, and are or a black hue, glistening in the sun, like the ilat surface
of a weihnsed smoothing-iron, The almost spherical shape seems to he
rluc tn the attri on of the detritus washed down by the stream. The
dark colour, which Only penetrates a. few lines, as is easily seen in de-
tached fragments, is caused by pru'nxide ot' irnn according to Busscgger,

A few yards to the S. of the cataract lie the pleasant villages
of MahÃ©dah and Shelli ], shaded by palms and'camores. In Ma-
Lidab huge piles of dried dates lie in the open air, brought hither
from Nubia for transport to Egypt. At this point begins the passage
of the rapids rlownstream; and boats (or ill1ahabiyehs for large par-
ties) may be hired here, if desired, for the safe voyage tn l'hilm
through a picturexque rocky landscape A bargain should be Struck
before the boat is entered. A small boat costs 10 piastres hy tariff;
a tlhahabiyeh not less than 10 fr. The boatmen demand much larger
sums at Mst.

hardly be recnmmendcd, for even when the river is full it is not Im-
attended with danger. u. Brugsch and Ehers both accomplished it. The
latter records that he looks back upon the experience not without pleasure,
especially on account of the estrarrrdinarr skill and presence Of mind of
the cataract-re"" who steered, He describes the trip as follows q had
two of our own sailors on board, nne able-bodied, the other a Nubian
little more than a hoy. The old cataractvrc'is was at the helm. The
roar t-f the cataract Was heard beyond the village of Lureuair, and became
louder every minute: nwc proceeded. The rocks and stones in the river-
bed are reddish brown. but wherever they have been washed by the
stream and then dried by the Scnrchina sun of this latitude, they glisten
like the black surface nf an evaprrrating pond. Behind aml herore, tn
