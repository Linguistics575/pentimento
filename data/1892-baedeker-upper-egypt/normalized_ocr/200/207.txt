II. The Northern Buildings.

A visit to the ruins to the N, of the temple of Amman need not
detain the traveller for any long time, unless his ohjectbeto decipher the
inscriptions .111le gather from them philological or historical information.
They are in bad preservation; and theS E, group, the tumple ofthe War-
god Mentu, is in especial so Complete ] mined that it is 6ihicult to recon-
strucl its ground-plan, although in size it was originally as large its the
[ ample 0f Khnnsu (p, 148). The traveller Who has little time at his
disposal, or who must proceed with the steamer, may content himsun'
with a glance at the great "d. girdle-walt of Nile-bricks, and at the gate
of the Ptolernies.

Beginning at the E. Pylon of Nectanebns (p. 1-"), we skirt the
girdle-wall of the great temple of Ammon, first to the N. and then
to the W. (left), until we see upon the right or N. side of our path
another girdle-wall oftirle-br 5, Within thislies a ruined Temple
(P1. N), the axis of which lies s.w. am1N.E. Like the pylon (see
below) it was dedicated to Manta. the god ofwar, andis frequently
mentioned on demotie tiles (ostraca). Stretching N.E. iron this
building is an avenue of sphinses, which we reach on passing
through the door of a well-preserved pylon. Little now remains of
the temple, Which dates from the time of Amenhotep III. of the
18th Dyn. (who also erected two ohelisks, as appears from a frag-
mentary inscription found here), though it was subsequently several
times enlarged between the reign of Ramses IV. and the epoch of
the Ptolemies, especially by Ptolemy IV. Philopator. Ptolemy II.
Philadelphus and Ptolemy HI. Euargetes have recorded their names
here, and there is also a stone bearing the name of'Ramsas'. The
earlier sculptures and architectural fragments are of great beauty;
and columns with Ilathor capitals were also employed. The above-
mentioned Pylon [ PL VII), the most N. part of the edifice now
remaining, Was founded by Ptolemy II. At its foot is a list of
names, and higher up are numerous other inscriptions. The fell'ahin
boys are shy ofaccompanying travellers to this spot towards evening,
as it is said to be haunted by an "Afrit 0r devil. It is called by the
natives Bab eL-'Abm, or gate ofthe ueesro-sraTes, probably on account
of some of the representations on its walls.

From the pylon we pretend to the SW., passing the remains of
a P (olemaic temple JI. o), of which the staircase is still to be
seen, to another Tempbe, consisting of six small chambers (Pr. k
to p). The second from the W. (Pl. 1) contains the name of Ame-
Mritis, with that of her brother Sahako. The tine alabaster statue
of the queen, mph in the museum at Gizeh, "as found here. The
temple n shows the rare name of Nepherites (29th Dyan); 0 dates
from the 22ud Dynasty. The names of Taharka, Usorhon IL, and
