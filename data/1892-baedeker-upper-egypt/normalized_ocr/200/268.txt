196 Route 18. THEBES. West Bank:

the tomb of Osiris, of the righteous prophet of Ammon, Neferhotep',
After an introduction. wishing peace to the dead, and glorifying the
sun-god, it continues literally as follows:'0eiehvate the great day, 0
prophet. Well is to thee, fragrant resin and ointments are laid before
thee. Here are wreaths and flowers for the waist and shoulders of thy
sister, who is pleasant to thine heart, as she rests beside thee. Let us
then sing and strike the harp in thy presence. Leave all cares behind
and think of the joys, until the day of the voyage comes when man casts
anchor on the land Which delights in silence'.

Near this is the once splendid tomb of another Neferhotep, over-
seer of the cattle of Ammon, but now in ruins and used as a maglr-
zine by the keeper of the Gizeh museum. There may also be visited
in the neighbourhood the tombs of Jrherilf, of the time of Amen-
hotep IH., of Moi, and of an ofiioral in charge of the stables of
Amenhotep II., the inner room of which is the resting place of
Mahu, a writer of the treasury in the time of Ramses H.

If the dhahahiyeh is lying at Luxor, the small boat should be ordered
to Wait with some men on the left bank of the river at the E. end of
the islenet

19. The Mortuary Temple of Seti I. at Kurnah.

Kings tBibiin el-Nulrikl; 3. Necropolis 0f et-A'sastr and of Drab Aha'V
Neggah; d. mh, ei-hahri,

To the W. bank as on the previous day, see p. 152. From the
lar1dingr-plwe of the ferry we ride across the fields in e northerly
direction and in 3/4 hr. reach the handsome *Temple, the front of
which with its eolumus is visible at a considerable distance. The
original building (see the annexed plan) Was of smaller dimensions
than the Ramesseum and Medinet Hahn, its complete length being
518 ft., and of this only the actual sanctuary with its halls and
chambers, 153 ft. in depth remain, while there are only scanty
remains to prove the former existence of two Courts and the Pylons
which enclosed them. The Sphinxes which were placed like'g11ar-
dians to the right and left of the door leading into the first Court
on the inside, are half covered with earth. They were placed there
by Seti L, and on the bases were inscribed the names of all the
nations which he had conquered. Of all the buildings in the Neoro-
polis of Thebes, thisonemostreminds us ofthe Memuonium ofAhydns
(p. 54), and a "loser inspection of the style of inscriptions and re-
presentations will both bring out and explain their similarity, for
the temple of Kumah was founded by Seti L, the builder ofAbydos,
and both the sanctuaries were restored and completed by Ramses IL
They both served the same purpose, as a plate where the manes of
the founder might be remembered, and offering made. At Abydos
it is true that throughout attention was paid to the pilgrims to
Osiris, while here it is the gods of Thebes that Were promi-
nent, and this was the centre of the festival of the mountain valley,
