Iliad (IN, 37 -3tU), Arhilles, enraged with Agameumon, azsures
Ulysses that he will never more unite in council or in deed with the
great Atritles: -

"Tea times as much, and twenty times were vain, the high pin ] store"

"0f rich) lyeenm,: Lth if he ranaack wide tarth far more,"

"Search nm (trchumenus for gold, and by the fertile stream"

"Where, in Egyptiau Thebes. me heaps of precious ingots gleam,"

"The burudred-gated Tl1ebes, where twice ten score in martial state"

"Of valiant men with steeds and ears march through each massy gate."

(Blackz'e's Transluzwn.)
The epithet £11121; .0;, Le.'hundred-gated', here used by

Human" a: .1150 applied by later cla sieal authors to Thebes. Diodorus,

With the rising importance of the god and with the increase of his
wealth, of which they had the disposal, the arehpriests ofAmmtm
gradually grew to regard themselves as the chief persons in the
state; and, after the way had been prepared by a series of weak
princes, they succeeded in usurpinz the throne and by their rule
prepared the ruin of E yptian power, From the. 20th Dyu. onwards,
'l'hehes began to decay. Ramses Ill. indeed adorned the left bank
especially with elaborate buildings; but his immediate st1Cb'iwsorb'
did no more than hew out for themselves deep and richly carved
gnnes in the xalley of the Einrc' Tombs, and the princes of Lower
Egypt who uuuceedetl the priests of Ammon of the 21st Dyn. were
the less able to bestow attention upon Thehes, the more eagerly
they strove to adorn their homes in the Delta with gorgeous stme-
lures. ret even these princes did not wholly abandon Thebes, and
they did not omit to insurihe pretentious reports of their mighty
acts on the walls of the temple of Ammon. The armies of the Assy-
ria s penetrated as far itS Thebes and plundered it; the Ethiopians
planted their rule here and honoured Ammon with buildings and
inscriptions; the princes of the 26th Dyn, did for Sa'is what the
princes oi' the 18th and 19th Dyn. had done for the city ofAmmon,
but they irlso paid their homage to the great god of Thehes by
erecting smaller buildings there. The invading army of Uaxubyses
ascerrtled a~ far as Upper Egypt, but seems to have done little or
no damage at Theb s.) et'tzmehus L, one of the native Egyptian
prince » who maintained thuunselves against the Persians, found
time and means to add a handsome pylon to the temple ofAnunon.
Alexander the Great and the princes of the house of the Lagidae
probably found Thebes still a great though decadent city, and they
assisted to embellish it, as r1lally buildings dating from the period
of the Ptolernies till attest. After the 22nd Dyn. the treasures ot
Ethiopia had cea=ed to enrich Thebes; and when the harbour of
Alexandria began to attract to itself the produce of Egypt brought
from the lied Sea to the Nile 1alley, the vessels of iioptos, with
their ladiug of Indian and Arabian goods, but seldom found their
way S. to the great city ot'Ammon. Thebes still remained Cun-
