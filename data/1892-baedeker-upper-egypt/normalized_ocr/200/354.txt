more repent. The inscriptions usually give thenameofthe deceased
and the date of death Texts from the K0rin are not uncommon,
in spite of the Prophet's express vommand that the name of Coil and
passages from the Koran should never be placed upon tombstones,
The tombs of the richer dead are small domed erections. 0n the
summit of the hill to the right of the road are some large 1110s'que-

is celebrated by festivals on their birthdays, etc.

at Tm: QUARRIES (Arabic Ma'adfn)

About 134 hr. beyond Assuén we quit the road and turn to the
E. (left). In a few minutes more we reach the verge of' a hill, on
which blocks of granite are scattered both singly and in heaps. A
moderately lofty cliff beyond shows manitold traces of the industry
of the ancient builders, who, from the erection of the pyramids to
the time of tho Ptolemies, drew their supplies of granite from the
quarries of Syene. Almost ztll the granite pillars, eolruuns. archi-
traves, roof latss, obelisks, and statues that we have hitherto seen
in Egypt, hail from this spot.

Sytwtltu tlwes its name to the early Greek focn1 of the name of Assuria
(Syene), although the stone here found is far too pom- in hornblende to
be reckoned tru symite att all" Harlnmnu describes it as follows: -
The granite, wlnclt interrupts the sandstone at the cataracts of Assnim,
is of a reddish hue, caused by bright l'ose-noloured ortluyelase. It con~
tains a large proportion ortmnslucent quartz, yellow, brownish, pink, and
black mica, and only a little hornblende. Huge coarse-grained masses of
this crunposition are here found aud also hard tine-grained masses, cum-
tainiug nmcl. red felspar, but little quartz and very little mica. Veins
also occur rich in dark mica and greenish oligoelase, and containing a
little piuite; aud tlually eius of a dark green diorite, in which the pm »
portion of hornblende is much greater then that of Mbite'. The glaze
0n the rocks of the cataracts is nutiuerl on p. 279.

The diligent hands of the stone-cutters of thePharaohs have left
distinct traces behind them. The method in which the blocks were
quarried in tiers may still be distinctly seen on a cliff facing the
N., about Smint to the N.E. of the town. The skill with which huge
masses were handled and detached without injury from the cliff to
which they belonged, is absolutely marvellous. The certainty of the
process adopted is amply vouched for by the fact that obelis were
completely ilnislecl on three sides before they were finslly detached









f This on ous fact is explained by Prof. Zirkel: ts lonmvs. The term
Byenite, whi ,1. occurs in Pliny, was ficst employed in a scientific sense
by "'erller in 1758, who rrpplied it to the characteristiu stelle termed of
orthoelase feispar and black hornblende. found in the Plauensehe Gruud,
in Saxony. Thenceforth that mineral was accepted as the typical syenite.
Wad subsequently proved that the stone quarried at Syeue was nut
syenite at all, Le, that its formation was quite tlitrerent from that vtthe
rocks in the Plan asehe Gruud. When Reziére discovered true syenite on
Mount Sinai he proposed to alter its name slightly and to call it Sinaite,
e suggestion, however, which has never been adopted.
