258 Route 24. GEBEL SILSILEH.. From Elm

The *Meymmy'rs T0 TEIB SOUTH are as interesting as those just
described, from which they are reached in about 1/41". The route
leads to the s., Sometimes skirting the river-bank, sometimes lead-
ing through the ancient quarries. We first reach Two Chambers,
with the openings facing the river, and recesses at the back. At
the first are two, and at the second are three unnamed sitting sta-
tues, hewn out of the rock. The chambers belonged to ofiieials of
Tutmes m., whose name occurs over the entrance along with those
of Amman Harmaehis and Sebek. The first cave belonged to Khem
nekht, overseer of granaries, who is here represented along with his
wife. The second, to the N., belonged to the mayor Amutu and his
wife, and contains a series of ilgures, To the S. occurs the name of

Alueuhotep II. 6 "8 A, khepcru; with two small Steles in

bad preservation on the left, and two others, better preserved, on
the right. Farther to the S. near the river is a brightly painted Fave,
with painted ceiling. A relief here depicts Amonemhat, a high
priest of Ammon (probably, from his name, under the 151th Dyn.)
satritleing to his parents and those of his wife Mimi.

The guides point out large square holes in the lofty rocks as
having been used to fasten the above-mentioned mythical chain of
Siisileh. Skirting the bushy river-bank we presently reach three
Inscribed Tablets, offering a picturesque appearance as seen from
the Nile. Two of them, adorned with concave cornice: and with
doors, liis elose beside each other. The archittave is home by settlp-
tured bm1-eolunms, the shafts of which represented stems of plants
bound together by il band. Both of these brightly painted faqades
act as frames for large Steles, placed at the back at small chapels
about 0 ft. deep. That to the 5. (left) Was erected by { muses 11.
in the fit'st year ot'his reign, that to the N. (right) by Merenpteh I.
(Hotep-hi-ma) in his Erst year. Each is formed of three parts. At
the top is the triad to Which it was dedicated, next is a Hymn to
the Nile, and below is a list of sacritices. 1n the one case the divine
triad consists of Ammon, Muth, and Khuusu, the chief triad of
Upper Egypt. in the other oflta IIarrnaehis, Ptah, and Hapi, recall-
ing Lower Egypt. A third, similar Stele, dating from the Gth year
of Ramses IH., is to be seen on an isolated rock to the light. All
are more or lems damaged; but a restoration of the text, which is
the same on all three, with a few triflingr variations, is rendered
possible by collation.
