10 Route J. Kén EL-A0MAR. From Cuiro

Opposite Minych, 0n the Fa. bank, lies K6111 et-mr/Urals, where
some ancitvnt tombs, perhaps belonging to the 12ty or 13th Dy-
nasty, have lately been diseovered.

"wiyet el-Métin and K6m e1-A1ynar ('the red rrruish-morrrrd'),
situated on the E. bank, 0-0 M. above Jiinyeh, may he visited to-
gether. We first reach the village of Zt'twiyeh, near which are the
estate and beautiful garden of the venerable Abu Sultan Pasha.
Between the village and Kim ] el-Al/inet, about 1,3 M. from the
latter, lies the iiue, cemetery of the citizens of Ninyel1 (p. 9), with
its numerous domed tombs and chapels. Thrice yearly, in the
mouths of llegeb, Shawwil, and DhillJiggehe, at the time of full
moon, funereal festivals, lasting several days, are celebrated here.
Among the ceremonies observed are the offering of dates to the
dead, which recalls the funereal offerings of the aucientEgyptianS,
and the pmsentatiou of palm-hranches, recalling the Oriental sym-
bolism of early Christianity, still familiar in our churches. A few
minutes' walk towards the S. brings us to the red mound of pottery
and rubbish known as Krins el-Alynar, which runs parallel with the
Nile. Climbing over this we reach the barial-vaalts of the pi'imzeval
monarchy, Which are situated among the Arehian hills, with their
gates towards the river.

The U1th are unfortunately in bad preservation, and some of them
h. e been destroyed by violence, the stones being removed for use in intim-
ing. it is uncertain of what town this was the necropolis, but it undoubt-
edly belonged to the 10th home of Upper Egypt, named mg, nr 1mm
(gazelle), in which the gazelle was held sacred. In this name also lay the
towns of Heben and Nefrus, the chief deity of which was represented as
e Sparrow-hawk standing on a gaielle, accompanied by Mather, Home,
and Khnnm. Some of (he tombs are still open to sltors. The lower
ones are sum and dilapidated, including one that was rich adorned
with sbataes, milar figures, hewn in the living rock, are still distinguish-
able 0n the fagade and in the rear of the chapel. Farther up is the tomb
of wTtfersekhru, rnya ] secretary and superintendent of the storehouses of
Upper anti Lower Egypt, which Mill contains some good "ulptures, This
tomb, in the rear of which are three niches. appears to have been con-
slructed under the 15th Dynasty. Among ity Cuntenh are saivritit3ial lists
and scenes like those in the Vault: of'Ahd el-Kurnnh: Osiris under a ca-
110pr, corpse crossing the Nile, accompanied by female mourners; the
deceased in the midst of his family. The tomb of Khlmu, a relative "
the Pharaohs. situated filr|her to the S. and lower down, is of earlier origin
and in all probability belongs to the ancient kingdoru. The scenes of
agriculture and navigation in this tou1b, reproduced by Lepsius, Are. how
scarcely'visible. From the upper lomha we obtain a splendidly varied
view of the Nile, its fertile, valley and the town of Minyeh, with the red
mounds of debris in the fnregrunnd, while In the N. stretches the study
desert, from which the domed tombs ondwiyet et-3itethy rise like a group
of tents. On the mound of Kant el-Ahmar lies a colossal tiguve, 70 ft.
lung, without an inscription.
