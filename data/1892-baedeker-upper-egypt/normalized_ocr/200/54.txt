compensate for the fatigue and trouble it involves,

As far as Minyeh the space between the E. bank and the hills
remains narrow, the limestone rocks frequently abutting on the river
in unbroken walls or rounded bluffs. Few villages are seen on this
bank, bat the fertile alluvial tract on the W. side, 10-12M. in width,
is thirkly populated and carefully cultivated) exhibitiuginprofusiau

The huge sugar plantations present a busy scene in Nos emhcr, when
the sweet juice is collected from the Canes and conveyed to the
factories, which are a monopoly of the Khetlive and follow each other
in rapid succession, These factories are connected by the railway,
and short braueph-liues, used in harvest-time only, run from them
to the plantations lying farther to the W. Their lofty chimneys
impart a very moderu-irrrlstriat appearance to the ancient land of
the Pharaohs. Large barges full of sugar-caues and others with
feilahin going to work in the factories are met on the river. Most
of the higher t) th'oials in the factories are Europeans. The juice is
expressed from the cane and then refined by being boiled twice in
closed vessels. In an average year about 25,000 tons of sugar are
produced in Egypt; in ISK) the value of the sugar exported
amounted to 509, () 001..

The boat passes two large islands. On the W. bank lieBulankah
and Bibeh (rail. stat., p. l), with large sagar-t'actories. The (-1uu1-

of eJ-llibeh, on the E. bank, about 4 M. farther up, are the ruins of
the town of Kheh or Kliebi, which belonged to the name of Aphro-
dite (p. 5). These include well-preserved riparian structures of the
time of the Pharaohs and some massive walls made of bricks,
bearing two different stamps. One of these hears the name of the
local goddess,'Isis of Khetr', and the prmnomcn of Tutmes 111. (18th
Dym); the other, discovered by H. Brugsch in 1853, reads'The
high-priest of Ammon, Pishern thejust, governor of the towns of
Utkhenu and Iseiu-kheb'.

On the E. bank rises the Gebel Shékh Embriruk. The steamer
stops at Maghéghah, a pleasant place on the W. bank, with acarias,
palms, and large sugar-works (post and telegraph ot'tiee at the tail.

with sugar-factories, the railway runs close to the river,

About 12 M. to the B. ofAhu Girgeh, on the Bajr Tami, in the name
