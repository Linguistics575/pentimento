astronomical representations etc.), others Aeenl to apply much more closely
m the tcmpll: at Medinet Hahn, ltuilt by Ramses II who bore the name
Uurmm'a mzt'aman (0symandyas) as well as Ramses HI, Among these
latter points are, the lion-hunt .m the N. itlr, of the temple, the treasury,
the severed limbs, and perhaps also the temple-library (p. IO). Possibly
the explanation is t ltiodmtis wrote his description from memory after
leaving Thebes and mmglud features of both temples in bis account.

The traveller will be assistu to form a judgment on the, question
for himself hy the following it in [ mints from the, description by Diodo-
rus.'Al the entrance is a pylon of cnlnured stone [ probably granite is
intcnded, though erroneously), 2 plethra long (QM! ft.) and "ails high.
Then follows a square peristyle, with sides measuring 4 pletlira (:04 ft.h
The roof is suppnrted, nut hy columns, but by 16 tigures ufliving beings,
tsaelt carved in an antique style nut of a single stone. The entire ronf
is 2 orgyiu (111/2 fl.) bruarl, and is formed nf sulid smite, decorated with
stars on a hlue ground. Beyond the peristyle are another entrance and
a pylon, ditreciug from the tirst only in having various tigures carved
upon it. Beside the entrance are 3 monolithic Mures ofthe llemnan uf
Syene (or, according to a hetter reading'of stone from Sreme0. One. of
these, a sitting figure, eseeeds in size all other status in Egypt; at its
mot (routstuol) it measures more than 7 ells. The others, to the right.
and left respectively of the knees at this statue, represent the sister and
mnther, and are smaller than the tirst. This work is not only note worthy
for its size, bat deserves admiration also fue its artistic beauty. It s
also remarkable for the Lhztrauter of the, stone, in which neither a trraelc
nnr a ilaw is to he seen in spite of its unusual size. - This pylon is
succeeded by a peristylc court Which seems even iiim-e wnrthy of remark
than tht- pruceding. It contains various scuipturas carved in the straw,
representing 1hr, Will's carried on hy him (Le. the king) against the: Race
Irians, wlu, had rusurlted against him'. Dindnrns Farther infnrms us that
the. army consisted vf4COMNtbot snldiers and mum cavalry, in four
div inns commanded by the k g's sons. Ua the tirst wall the king Was
represented storming a fortress surrounded by a river, and hurling himself
against the enemy, along with a fierce lion which accompanied him in
hattle ___ "ln front of the last wall were twn monolithic sitting statues,
27 ellsin height, and hcsidethcse were three exits fron, the peristyle, admits

are tun completely ruined to he satisfactorily cnmpared with the report
nf the b' ian geugraplser.

We are able tn recognize the rust pylon, the caryatides in the second
peristyle cnurt, the largest colossus in Egypt, the battle-sculptures with
the lion and the fortress surrnunded hy water, the hypostyle udeum, and
traces of the library. Dindtirus describes them in tolerably correct order,
but as vaguely as hasty travellers usually I10 who are unable to take
notes (m the spot.

We enter the temple by the most easterly of the three extant
Pylotts. This Was originally 220 ft. broad, but its ruined exterior
is now more like a quarry than a building. Many representations
are still recognizable, though much defaced, on the broad surfat'o
of its w. Side, next the first t'nm't. Beginning our inspection with
the N. Wing (P1. a), to the extreme left. (N.I'I.) of the beholder, we
iirst notice the, slender representations ot'pirruaeled Asiatic fortresses,
in six m" the two highest ofwhich have been destroyed. thrtecn
ot' the original eighteen are still recognizable, each with an in-
scription containing its name, and in some cases alro the year in
which it was taken by Ramses H. The isolated in Tiptiou at the
