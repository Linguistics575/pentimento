proper, which was 490 ft. wide and had a double colonnade, bc-
longs to the 26th Dy1msty.

The village "Bihamn, about 4 M. bo the N. 0f Medineh, Was
douhtless (\nee situated on the hank of Lake Mu'ris, It still contains
some shameless ruins nf ancient origin, destitute uf inscription, but sup-
posed to be the remains hf the pyramids Which according to Herodotus
once stood in the lake, They are now culled Km-si Fawn », or chair of
I'lmmnh, and resemble dilapidated altars rising above other fragments nf
solid masonry, If they were once pyramids, the greater part of them
must have been removed, as the walls are now but slightly inclined
inwards. Distinct traces of the water in which they nucc stood arc to
be seen on their bases, and they are still surrounded by remains of
walls, the purpose of which is unknown

In the fields near Ehgig, m' Degrg, 21 M, to tho sm 0f MeMmels, lies
a fine obelisk' broken into twu parts, Which mnsthzwe tmce been at lea
43 ft. in height (route tn it rough and dirty ]. Like other obelisks, it is,
horizontally, of oblong rectangular shape, and its summit is muuded.
The inscriptions, which are damaged at many places, inform us that the
monument Was erected by Usertesen L, who also founded the nhelisk

_ Exccnsiexs. A Whole day is required for a visit to the Pyramid
of Hauvimh and the Labyrinth/horse lo, donkey 5 ft.) The route
leads at first for% hr. along the bank of the Baht IYssuf. The first
village of any importance is Uiufrels. Our path traverses well eul-
tivated land with numerous water-wheels. The corn and cotton
iiolds are shaded by numerous syeamores, lehhehs, palms, and
other trees. About 1/21111 from Uhéfeh, and beyond two smaller
villages, we reach a bridge of ancient brick masonry Traversing
the slightly undulating tract a little farther, we reach the Balm
IJel0sWiliCriver without vratcr0, also called el-Buls, a deep elrtrn-
nel, extending in a wide am e, and terminating near tho N.E. end
of the Birket el-liurrln (p. 4) In winter the water, which trick-
ies down from its lofty banks, forms a few scanty pools. At the
bottom of the channel grow reeds and tsunarisks. The S. bank
rises at places nearly perpendicularly to a height of 26 ft., so that
the sequence of the strata of the soil is distinctly observable. We
now ascend the plateau [ the highest in the province, 88 ft. above
the sea level) on which lies Kawiret eI-Kagah or Hmm'wet et-
Mulytu, a considerable village, with a mosque (reached in 13/4hn
from Medinet oi-Fay) The traveller may apply to the Sid h-el-
Ihylei1 (pr0Ryet ofthe village) for a guide to the pyramid of Jlawisralc
If tho water is high, and the canals have to be avoided, we have
to make a circuit of nearly 2 hrs. to the Labyrinth, but by riding
through the water, Where necessary, it may be reached in 3/4 hour.

The longer route is preferable, as it passes several relies of
antiquity. A little beyond the village rims the bridge of lfmitir
el-Aglmi, the ten buttresses ot' which rest on a foundation of riltbb'e
sivc stone. We continue to ride along an mmieut embankment, and
