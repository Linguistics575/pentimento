different chapels are still easily tl'tst'thguishahle, partly [ tout the
plan of the building, psrtly by the representations and imwaiptirms;
for from each ofthe seven doors a processionai approach led through
the two hypostyle halls straight to tho entrance of the correspond-
ing chapel; while the representations on the columns flanking each
approach refer only to the deity to whom the chapel at the end ofit
was dedicated. In the vaulted chapels, amid the fumes of in-
cense and the murmurihg of muiner1 singing, waited the minis-
tering priests of the sanctuary, pouring out Iihations and uttering
benedictians as the processions wound along the aisles, either
bearing a mummy to be "nivtitied or consisting of a group of privi-
legetl laymen bringing offerings to the Osiris gods for the soul's

. welfare of the deueased.--Tlw. dedications are inscribed on the
door-posts in the traditional forms and with little variation. Similar
vaults occur at Behihaean and Dh el-Babri, and also in the lids uf
the sareoplsagi in the museum at Gizeh. In each case the menu Â»
meuts to which they belong serve funerary purposes; the shape ot
the vault is, however, iutended to represent the vault of heaven,
Whit-h tiseOsiris-sorn has to traverse, and they are usually decorated
with stars. An inscription preserved on one of the vaults of the
sanctuary informs us that the Pharaoh erected this structure for his
father Osiris in the interior of the temple of Ra-ma-men and fitted
up the chapel to resemble the heaven of the uinetbid deities, imi-
tating its constellations, eta.
