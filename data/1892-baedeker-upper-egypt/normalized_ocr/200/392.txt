308 Route 30. KALABSIIEi-L From Phila:

who were, about 540 A.D., defeated by Silko, the Christian king of
the Nobades (p. 302) who velebrated his victory in an inscription
on one of the pillars of the temple at h'alabs-heh (see below).

The extent Large Temple was built under the Roman emperor
Augustus and his successors, The numerousinscriptions (in Greek,
with the exception of one in Latin hehameters) date from the, reigns
of Domitian,'1'tajan, Hadrian, andAntouinus Pius, and of the later
emperors Alexander Severus and Philippus; they express the reve-
rence of the soldiers of the Spanish, Itureau, and Theban cohorts
for the great god Mandulis.

Including the inner girdle-wall the temple i 235 ft, long and
1171/2 ft. broad. There is also an outer girdle-wall, with small
temples at the N.E. and S.\V. angles. Before the, last stand tive
columns one behind the other. The inner girdle-wall joins the
masiive pylon, forming a continuous building with it. In front of
the pylon is a narrow platform, reached by a tlight of stops begin-
ning at the Nile, then by a paved passage about 100 ft. long and
25 ft. broad, leading to a second night ot'20 stops. The entrance to
the temple is blocked by fallen stones and the dwellings of natives,
who have settled all about the entire templet In the inteiior of the
pylon are stairs and chambers, as at Edt'u o. 244). On passing
through the door of the pylon, which is not in a straight line with
the rest 0fthe building but at a slight angle with the axis of the
temple, we find ourselves in a fore-court, (35 ft. long, the, tloor ol'
which is quite covered with fallen blocks of maeomy. Ofthe double
row of columns which once stood here, probably in 4 couples on each
side, only a single column, on the left side, is now ereet. On each
side of this court four narrow chambers have been ssousstrueted in
the wall; and a door on the right eoruun1mYstes with the exterior
passage round the temple The walls of the entrance to the next
room retire towards the, top in the manner of a Pylon. Here en the
right the above-mentioned decree of Silko isiuscribediu bad Greek.
On the nearest column is a longinscription in the Ethiopian demo-
tie character, hitherto umieeiphered, which may perhaps be a replica
or repetition of the decree,
