290 Route 20. PHIL/E. Temple

with the concave cornice and astragal, exhibits an unusually tine
inscription, carved in the grand style, of which a duplicate occurs
on the architrave of the E. colonnade opposite. This Dedication-
Inscription records that Ptolemy IN. Euergetes II. Physkon (with
numerous titles) and hi; wife Cleopatra, princess and mistress of
both worlds, the Euergetae (divine benefactors ], loved the life-
giving Isis, the mistress ofAbaton, the queen of the island of Phila,

and the queen, Philadelphi $ 1 i) (divine brothers), Energetic
f)'kcrhi1opatosiys, Epiphanes, Eupetores, and Philometores,

erected and restored this beautiful monument, that it might be a
festal hell for his (the king's) mother Usert-Hathor, etc., and a

scene of Joyful excitement, Ctee Tekh, for the mistress of

Philte, that she might settle in it, etc. The above list of Ptolemaie
surnames is especially important.

At the top of the left colennade, next the first pylon, are some
demotie and hieroglyphic Decrees, of the'let year of Ptolemy Epi-
phanes, One relating to the celebration of the suppression ofa revolt
and the punishment of the rebels, the other in honour of Cleopatra,
wife of Epiphanes. These inscriptions, of great stwientifie value
though extremely lightly and almost illegihly carved, were discovered
by Lepsius in 1843. Unfortunately they have been much injured
by figures carved over them under Neos Dionysus. An upper story
of Nile bricks, now in ruins, was built at some later period on the
roof of this peripteral temple. It is entirely out of place and
should be removed.

f. The Building on the E. side of the Peristyle (P1. M), men-
tioned on p. 288, lies opposite the birth-house, and presents a long
Colonnade of 10 columns, with elaborate capitals, towards the
court. In the rear-wall of this eolounade is first, to the left, a
large doorway, leading through a vestibule to the outside of the
temple, and then three lesser doors leading into three small cham-
bers, partly devoted to srrityntiiie purposes. At the S. end, close to
the pylon, is a fifth door, admitting to a room now half in ruins.
To the left of this room is another chamber (P1. 1: see below), and
straight on is the Staircase (P1. m) leading to the rooms on the
upper story. Some of the latter are tolerably spacious, but have no
inscriptions; whereas the lower story and the columns were adorned
with hieroglyphic: by Ptolemy XIII. Neos Irwnysus. The Jnserip-
tions in the various rooms are due to Tiberius, t0 whom Phile in
general is much indebted.

The most interesting rooms on the E. side of the peristyle court
are first that into which the door nearest the pylon and leading to
