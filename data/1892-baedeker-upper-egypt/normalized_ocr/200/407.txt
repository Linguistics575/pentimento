few without heads lie behind. Heside the two Mst are two colossal
statues of Ramses Il 101/2. high, placed against pillars, bearing
the cartonchcs of the hing,'beloved of Harmaelsis and Ptah' on the
right, and'beloved of Aminou-lla and Ptah', on theleftt The kings
name appears on the girdles of both tigures and on the chests
of the sphinxes. btatues of the king, probably tour in number (now
destroyed), also stood in front of the pylon, which is 32 ft. high
and MI, ft. broad. On the hack of one of these statues it is recorded
that the king erected this noble pillar in Pa-Amon (apparently the
holy name of the temple) in memory of his tether Arumotr-Ra and
adorned it with costly gems. On the outside of the pylon, as in
various other Egyptian temples, are two s) olossal figures, which,
however, are diirieult to identify owing to the weatherworn state
of the sandstone, of which the temple is built. On the right the
king holds eight foes by the hair, menacing them with his weapon
while they raise their hands in supplication:'he smites the great
ones of all lands'. The god Harmachis hands him the sword of
victory. To tho left is a similar scene, in presence of Ammon-lla,
who promises to the king victory over all alien lands. The large
fore-court, which we now enter, is 65 ft. square, The interior is
very interesting. To the right and left are corridors, each with 5
Osiris-pillars supporting an arehitmve. On the left CS.) side the
roof of slabs is still extant, but on the N. side it is wanting, so that
the dl'it't-sand has found entrance and now covers a considerable
portion of the court. At the top of the back of the pylon occur the
varying cartouehes of Ramses II., and beneath the cornice his name
occurs again, in anaglyphie characters. 011 the left (S) wing of tho
pylon, the king prosents a Sphinx to Ammon Â» Ra amt limb, to the
right he offers bread to Harmaehis and Jusis. Round the court in
the row nearest the ground appears a procession of the children of



the king, eaeh with the name appended, the sons bearing fans j,

the daughters bearing sistra, There are two series, both be-

ginning on the"'.er back-wall of the court and running respectively
to the right and left from the W. entrance to the main temple. On
the W. wall, to the right of the temple-door, are IO men (mostly
concealed by the sand), on the N. wall 40 men and 8 women, and
on the E. wall, to the N. of the entrance to the court 27 women,
he. in this series 59 Son: and 30 daughters. On the W. wall to the
left of the temple-door are 19 men and 20 women, on the s. wall
33 men and 12 women, La Cf?. sons and 32 daughters. lf the
names are not repeated, as at Medinet Habu, Abydos, etc., 1'11
sons and G7 daughters are thus attributed to Ramses the Great.
