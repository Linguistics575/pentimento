222 Route 21. TIIEBES. West Bunk:

a few tombs at el-Asaeif are usually visited by the ordinary traveller.
Some belong to the 18th and 19th Dyn., but the most important
are of the'26th. Broken walls seem to indicate that the cemetery
was divided into sections. We also find here various brick build-
ings and a large arched doorway. During Mariette's excavations
many mummies Were found, not in regular tombs, but either in the
earth itself, or in small vaults 3 to 6 ft. below the surfaee. In some
of them, papyrus-rolls of great value were discovered. The tomb of

Petamenap < D eee S) is larger than Nos. td and 17



at Bihin el-Mulinc, and is worth a visit on account of its great size.
Petamenap was a prince of the empire and an ofiieial of the? tht
Dyn.., whose remarkable position entitled him to the unusual honour
of completing buildings at the temple of Me0inet-Habu, and of
placing his name upon them. The tomb is cut out of remarkably
beautiful limestone; and its inscriptions display the neamess of
finish which is peculiar to the Sculptures of the Egyptian renais Â»
same. It has become the home of thousands of bats, which render
the attempt to copy the inscriptions in the inner rooms \'ory difiitutlt
by constantly extinguishing the li ht. The smell. moreover, which
they cause is so strong and oiltynsive that a thoroueh inspection of
the tomb is recommended only to those who can overcome the feel-
ing of nausea. Any one who is subject to giddine: should avoid
going far into the tomb, as in the middle it is net-e'ary to balanre
oneself, though only for'd few steps, along a narrow path on the
edge of a deep shaft. Sir Gardner Wilkinson undertook the measure-
ment of the tomb, and the inscriptions have been almost completely
copied and partly published by Diimichen. These are important
thiefly for the details of the funeral eeremonies

The entrance, as in almost all the tombs in this part of the uPt'rn-
polis, is by an open cuimyard without Walls,105ft. wide and 76ft. deep,
Which leads to a hall in the rock (the mortuary chapel), with side-
chambers and passages. This is 61 ft. wide by M ft. deep, and its root
is supported by two rows of pillars. An the walls are ornamented with
inscriptions and reliefs carefully executed, but now unfortunately much
injured and blackened. These almost without exception, refer to the fate
of the soul in the lower World .--A vaulted Corridor leads into a second
large Roomt03 n, by 37 ft.) in which 8 pillars remain to prevent the roof
from falling, while in the Room adjoining it, 321/211. square, only t have
bum spared. A Charubevwith niches (21 ft. by 12 ft.) concludes this series
of rooms, the total length of which together with the courtyard is312 ft.
The nature of the stone having apparently prevented further advance hits
the rock in this iUreetirm, the masons turned to the left and dag out a
wide Hall, and also to the right, where six successive Passage' Were
made at right angles leading to a small room. These not being on the
same level Were connected hy flights of respectireiy 9, 23, and 9 steps.
In the small room mentioned is a shaft "ft. deep with a chamber.
Caution is necessary here. This series at pa ages is 177a. in length.
From the room containing the shaft a Cor dor runs again to the
right, and leads to a transverse Chamber, making 60 ft. in this direction.
Hnwevei, before reaching the stops on the second line, we and leading
to a second shaft a ruurth set or passages to the right, 125 ft. long in a
straight direction. Adjoining this on the left is a large Gallery, 58ft.
