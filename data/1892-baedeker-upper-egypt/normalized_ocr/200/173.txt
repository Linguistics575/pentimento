Seth was obliterated at various epochs. The introduction of Chri
iauity and the BiliCtS of Theohosius were followed by the destruc-
tion of many pagan statues and the obliteration of many pagan in-
scriptions. At all events the new religion and the elesit of the
temples dedieated to the ancient gods cemoved all possibility of
anything being done to preserw the monuments of the Pharaohs.
The Nile, which annually overflowed as far as the temple ofkamak
in particular, and the saline exudations of the soil, wrought harm;
jachals and other animals sought shelter in the subterranean cham-
hers; many tombs, at first occupied by Christian hermits, were Coil-
verted into peasants' dwellings; Christian churches were erected in
the temple-halls, and houses were builtbetwsen the columns of the
temple at Luxor. Carefully hewn blocks and slabs were removed
from the monuments, which were used as quarries, and many
limestone details were thrown into the furnace and reduced to
lime. Whither the enormous population of the hundred-gated
Thebec hetoek itself is unknown. A few widely-scattered villages
alone now represent of the giant city. These have given names to
the various edrtiees and tombs, whose holy names might only be
uttered with pious ewe in the time of the Pharaohs, The ruins of
Thebes remained long forgotten. 0n the revival oflearning classical
students recalled their fame; Peweke redisrwovered, described them
and drew them; and tinally the publications of the great French
Expedition cevealed to astonished Europe how much of the ancient
mitgnith'enee of the Pharaohs had survived to our time. Earl:
sunremling srientitie expedition made its longest halt here and
found here its richest rewards. The names of Champolliou, Wil-
kinsou, Lepsias, and other Egyptolagists are familiar words on the
site of ancient Thebes; and Mariette, who carried on exmrations
uwler the auspices of the Khedive, must also he mentioned.
