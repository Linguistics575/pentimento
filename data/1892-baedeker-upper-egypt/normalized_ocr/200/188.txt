entrance, have already been mentioned on p. 119. But neither

built this Pylon, but the pretleeir or and father of the latter,
Rams _ 1., who also planned the hypostyle hall, afterwards adorned
by Seti I. and Itamses the Great. The cartouchos of Ramses ll,
frequently occur sunk instead of being erubosced, because they have
been plaeed on spots previously occupied by the older cartnurhes
of Ramses T. or Seti I. The same is the case on the back 0fthe
N. pylon, whereas on the back of the S. pylon, Which Was erected
by Ramses IL, his name appears in genuine bas-relief. In the
dnmway (Pl. e), where the eartorwhes ot" llamscs L, Scti L, and
Ramses 11. are found, an intervening door was ereetedbyPtolemy NU.

their joint-reign (170-165 Bi.). The lintel and upper prtrts of
this latter doorway are wanting, but the jambs are in good pre-
servation, with expressions of homage to Amman and his fellow-
gods. On the inner side (to the left) of the earlier doorway appears
Rams H. kneeling before Amman and receiving the symbol "
kingship. Behind him stands the goddess Muth, and Khmlsu, hsith
the moon's disc on his head, conducts Ptolemy VII, Philumetor to
behold the god Amman. Probably the representation is a restoration
by Philometor of an older work on the sam? spot.
