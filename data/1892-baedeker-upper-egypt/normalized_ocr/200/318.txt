The huildiug presented a very diffevent appearance only thirty years
ago. Arab houses stood upon the temple itself and Were built against
its walls. The interior was tilled with ruhhish almnsl up to the capitals
of the columns, and the outside was equally deeply buried. A picture of
the edifice as it then was may be seen in plates MI and 55 in the first
volume of (he Antiquités in the JJescrigrHott Lie PEgypte. In the beginning
of the sixties, however, the entire templu was laid bare by Mariette under
the auspices of the Khedtve, end the buildings clustering upon and around
it were removed. an the temple of Edfu is seen in wonderful, almost
perfect preservation, exceeding that "any other Egyptian temple or even
or any antique building in the world, in spite of the X00 years that
have passed own it. From top to bottom it is covered with represen-
tntions and remarkable inscriptions, the interpretation of which was
reserved for the present century, so rich in discoveries of every kind.

The Temple ofEdfu is superior to the temple at Denderuh in
the mueh greater distinctness of its seulpturcul reliefs and inserip-
tions, due probably to the use of better sandstone than that of
Denderah which contains more lime. It is also much more complete,
for in addition to chambers corresponding to those found atpeu-
derah, there ate at Etlfu a passage running round the temple and
a lofty wall enclosing the latter, besides a spacious foce-eourt and
two massive pylons. (Comp. the accompanying Plan with that of
Dunderah at p. 80.)
