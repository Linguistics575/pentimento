The Ascent o/ the Pylnm, commanding an excellent view of the whole
island and its surrounding, is made from the peristyle court entered by
the central portal. Within this portal, to the right, is the fullowing In-

Two Obelisks and two Lions, all of granite, formerly stood be-

d. The Inner Peristyle (Pl. I), bounded Oil the S by Pylon H.,
is bounded on the N. by another Pylon (Pl. K). These, however,
are by no means parallel to each other, while the editiees to the
E. and W. of the perietyle are so entirely different, that it is at

the most varied forms, must be described as unusually effective.
On the E. and W. are two oblong editiees, each with columns on
the side next the court. That to the W, (left) is a distinct temple,
forming a kind of petipteros; that to the E. w = used by the
