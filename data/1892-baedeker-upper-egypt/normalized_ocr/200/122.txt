68 Route d. Amnos. Temple of Ramses II.

here is all the more striking from the obvious pains of the founder
to make a costly and enduring monument. Where Seti contented
himselfwith limestone, Ramses made lavish use of granite, Oriental
alabaster, and Mark graywaeke. The remaining fragments show
that Ramses erected obelishs of granite in front of his cenotaph, and
that caryatide-like figures of Osiris, now long since shattered, stood
at the sides of the first peristyle eourti Plastic ornamentation was
freely used and so richly painted that: the eolours have to this day
r-lung to some of the fragments. Ramses followed the example of
bis father in eonsenrating a chamber to (he manes of his ancestors,

the first ortostyle room a royal list of eighteen names, two of which
were partly destroyed, and the relics of these tablets are still in situ.
M. Mimaut, the French Consul General, tore down the wall: on
Which the important eartouehes were represented and sent the stones
to Paris, whence they passed by purchase to the British Mnseu1n.
Almost no inscription has been leftintaet here. We learn, however,
that Ramses was mueh more anxious than his father tn record his
own srehievemeuts. Not a few names of peoples and towns which he
subdued or captured may still be discerned among the ruins,

Tho visitor will gladly arrest his steps by the representation of
a grand procession, which is to he found inside the great romt. to
the right and left of the entrance. The pmression, beginning at
the N.W. comer of the hall, which was formerly surrounded with
Osiris-pillars, extends over tho whole of the. N. wall. Four temple
oftieials are represented, one described as a secretary, two with
leopard-skins as priests of 0 and of the house ofliamses Mo.-
riauwn Khnnmt Abdu (connected with Ahydos), and the fourth as
Jierhuh. Animals, some living and some dead, are brought to them
for sae, ritiee. Among these are antelope; geese, and oxen of extra-
ordinary size aml fatness. On the right side of the iore-eourt are
similar scenes, in which the processi on is still more grandly equipped.
Irere appear the royal war-chariot, numerous oNcials, aml negroes,
while incense is burned before the statue of the monarch. The co-
lom'ing of these iitgares is surprisingly well preserved,
