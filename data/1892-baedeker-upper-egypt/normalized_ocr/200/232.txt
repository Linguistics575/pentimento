162 Route 13. THEBES. West Bank:

larger than the other soldie1s--The limestone blocks farming the
Doorway of this sandstone pylon display various sculptures and in-
scriptions, the latter containing the usual detlicntory formulae.
The Thehau triatl (Animon, Muth, antl Khuusu) and another triad
consisting of Ptah, Sehhet, and Hathor are among the divinities
whieh here received sacrifices and bestowed gifts.

On entering the First Court: (Pl. A) we observe that it had on
its right ztntllet't sides a double row orvolumns, of which, however,
only a few scanty remains me to be found on the hi. To the W,
this spm-e is bounded by the Second Pylon, 110w in ruins. 0n the
loft (S.) stood the Colossus of Ramses IL (Pl d), the material of
which was justly admired by Diatlorus fp. Iryd), and which really
may be termed the hugest statue in Egypt. The remarkable granite
statue (not sandstone like the eolossi ot' Memnon) was probably
floated down the river on rafts from Assu√©n to Thebes. It has been
deliberately destroyed (apparently, from the marks at the fractures,
by means of damp wedges), though to do so must have cost its
enormous pains. 1n the time of Diotlurus, who visited Egypt about
00 All, it appears to have been still uninjured; and we may c011-
clutle, therefore, that it was tlestmyerl in consequence oi' the etlict
of I'heodosius, as one of the principal pagan idols. The name of
Ramses H. appears in well-preserved hieroglyphics on the Upper
arm and on the seat of the statue, which lies close by in shattered
fragments. It cannot now be put together, as the inhabitants or'hhtt
el-l.iuruah have broken "slahs of granite and smoothed them for
the purpose of hashing their corn. The face is unfortunately cum-
pletely destroyed. The remains (breast, upper arm, one foot, etc.)
still testify to the care with which this gigantic monument was
chisellatl and polished. The Savant: of the French Expedition Care-
fully measured the various parts, as follows: length of ear 31/2 ft.,
surface of face from ear to ear 63,4 ft., stufatus of breast from
shoulder to shoulder 23h ft., from one shoulder to the other in a
straight line 21/ ft., rrinnuuieremus of the arm at the elbow
171/3E ft., diameter of the arm between the elbow and shoulder
43/4 ft., length of the index fingec 31/5 ft., length of the nail on the
middle tir1ger 71/2 inches breadth of ditto 6 inches, breadth of the
foot across the toes, 41,2 ft. The total height seems to have been

571/2 ft., and its tot.tl we etht over two million pounds.

The'iiirii head of anuthm' Statue of Itamsm II. was ftmnd 011 the
S. side or the temple far Ier back, and Was conveyed to the Nile by
nclzoui in 1616, and thence to Alexandria. It is 110W mm of the chief
treasures in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum,

The Second Peristyle Court (Pl. 1!) is in much better pre-
servation than the first court and IS mentioned with its cafyzttitles
in Diodorus's description of the tomb of Osymmidyas (y. l". Its
general arrangement is easily understood. On all tour sides" were
