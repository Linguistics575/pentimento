No 2 () (see above) to the tomb ot' 1umtsnkhepersenelr (No. 34),
which, having been opened only for tr few years, is remarkably well
preserved and is well worth a visit. For stout people, however, the
entrance is almost too narrow, The deceased was chief Architect to
Tutmes In The right hand inner wall ot the large hall tells us of the
important works which were entrusted to him, such as the carving
of a statue of the king from a single stone, the erection of a hall of
pillars, and of numerous obelisks. Here again we see tribute being
brought by princes, of Keftu (the Phteniciens), of Kheta, Tunep,
Kat, Katesh, etc. The arms and helmets of the foreigners, their
carriages and handsome vases are remarkable Near this, alittle
to the right, is the iine and weli-preserveti tomb (No. 51) of Amen,
emha, the scribe of the harvest, in which should he noticed the
barper and the long list of relations of the deceased, whose father
and mother were named Tutmes and Entef. In a passage there are
represented barges with mummies of himself and his wife Bekt.
In the last chamber there is a Side of the 28th year of Tutmes III.
The shaft in the tomb contains a large room covered with writings
Still farther to the right is the tomb (No. 60) of a mince (erpa-hrr)
Entefaker, and on the N.E. slope that of Amkhent, the son of Auta,
which was completely excavated in 1883. A descent should now
he made to the gallery, in front of which is seen Wilkinson's House,
and to the tomb (No. 88) of Imaiseh, who was scribe of the altars
of sacrifice under Ramses IX. (Nefci'kara). The iestal barges with
the name of the king should he noticed, as well as the many golden
utensils, and the money-bags, and also a series of kings, among
whom appears King Raskenen, who fought against the Hyksos, and
whose remarkable mummy is in the museum at Gizeh.

We now descend to the plain, where there are a few more tombs
to be seen in the direction of cI-Asasif, including that of Nefer-
hotep, who lived under King Hows, the last of the 18th Dynasty.
In this should be especially noticed the funeral processions by boat
which have been copied by Wilkinson (Manners and Customs). The
funeral services are also recorded.

We have to crawl through the entrance Which is thoked up. The
ceiiing is Jecora? ed, and has a regularly recurring series of hieroglyphics,
signifying'First' and'Prophet': the deceased in fact held the ornate of
Prophet of Amman. The iami F scene in the first 1r00u1 explains itself;
the 39 rows of hieroglyphies above retard the names of the relations of
the deceased, who an the left are paying homage to King Home with
whom they were closely connected, in the second t'001I1 we see Nefer-
holep, sitting by the side of his sister who is adorned with flowers. Be-
hind them is an Inscription which indicates that distinguished E tian
families kept private bands of music: and it may he that the pcciai
duty of the harper whose song has been handed down to posterity try
this inscription, was to giadden the hearts of the family when they were
assembled in their ancestors tomb for the soiemuities in his honour.
The snug is not in any way of a mouinful character, and it is clear that
in the time of the Pharaohs, it Was a pleasure to be reminded in the
ttlinhs of the- shortness of ii, and the duty to f! it, so lung as it
