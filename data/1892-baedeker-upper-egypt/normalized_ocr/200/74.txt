On the W. bank, 1 M. from the Nite, is Malawi e1-'Arish (rail.
stat., p1), a small town with 10,000iuilab., where fowls, eggs',
eto., may he mouthed cheaply (large market on Sun.) In the vi-
cinity are many large palms and alsu sugar-poration Further
uit, on the E. bsuk, at the foot of the hill of the s: tmenan1e (p. 20 ],
lies sh√©khWarii1, with tombs of the old empire, including those uf
priests of Khuru, Userkaf, and Pepi.

We next reach the ruins of et-Tell and the grottues of Tell el-
Amaruah, two very interesting points DI) the E. bank, at which the
Tour weeks' steamer stops for a few hours on its returrr-jouru0y.
The best plan is to disembark at ot-Tell, visit the remains of the
old town, return to the dltahahiyeh, alldsai1to Hagg ei- (Cartdll, whisre
donkeys for the visit to the grottoes are more easily obtained than
at et-Tell. We pass to the right of the village ot et-Tell, 1/pr.
from the river, and at the point where the cultivated land ends we
turn due S. (to the sight). After passing the ruins of alarge build-
ing (probably a temple }, now consisting of the foundations onlyaud
nearly indistiirg1trslraNe, we turn to the right from the path to vi-
sit the numerous relies ofpuhlic nnd pxivate buildings of all kinds.
There are larger and liner ruined temples in other parts of Egypt,
but nowhere else do we obtain so excellent an idea of the actual
vlwclling-ylaees of the citizens It looks as if the hand of deity had
bodily removed this large town (mute than 1M. lung from N. to S.)
from the surface of the eartb, leaviug nothing but the t'oturdations
to tell the after-world that many thousands of human beings once
lived and worked, suiiered and rejoiced on this waste spot. The
lines of the streets may he followed and grouud-ylans traced; but
the demands of cultivation are steadily effecting the remains.

Tell el-Amaruah. Whether we proceed by land from et-Tell
01' disembark at Ilagg el-riumlil, we have to ride towards the hills
tu the E., in which, even from a distance, we discover the gates of
the celebrated tenths orTell el-Amarnah. In either case it is advisable
to have :1 guide. On the way we should not omit to visit the recently
discovered grave of the suu-worshipper lou-en-atm (Amenho-
tep 1V., see below). Of the two groups ot' tombs that to the bt is
the moreintetesting and the more easily accessible.

An interesting zutd not yet fully explained epoch of Egyptian history
