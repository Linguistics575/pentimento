mission-station or at the house of the Italian oure0. It rental s'
about 40,000'rrrhab., and is a not unpleasing specimen of an Egyp-
tian town. Between the station and the town we observe a peculiar,
mldershet stl.dyeh, or water-wheel driven by the water itself. The
very long covered bazaar contains nothing of special interest The
traveller, even if uuprovided with an introduction, should pay a
visit to the mlldiry who will protect him from extortion in case of
any'liftirmlty with the owners of horses and others (comp ll. 34).
A broad arm of the Baht 1Trsuf (p. 35) flows through the middle
of the town. The mosque of (fail Bey, on the N. side of the town,
now somewhat dilapidated, is the only interesting building of the
kind. It contains numerous antique columns, brought from tho.
awient Arsinoii, some of Which have shafts of polished marble with
Arabic inscriptions, and Corinthian and other capitals. Below the
mosque, on thebank of the Baht Disuf, are some remains of ancient
masonry. No ancient inscriptions have been discovered here, but
the walls of some of the houses contain fragments Which must
have belonged to aurient temples. At the W. end of the town the
Baly Yhsuf radiates into numerous branches, Which water the
enuntry in every direction. The dilapidated mosque of w'.Joft situated
here forms a picturesque foreground.

To theN. of the town are the extensive ruins of Crocodilopolis-
Al'sino√©, Which has been entirely destroyed. The site, is now called
ATV, h'0ris. Many antiquities, both ofthe Roman and the Christian
period, have been found here, including numewus small terracotta
lamps and many thousand fragments oi' papyri, intermixed with
pieces of parchment. Most of the pnpyri are Greek (among them
fragments of Homer, Euriyides, Thueytlides, else of a Christian
mttwchetieal book), many are Arabic from the 2nd cent. of the He-
gira down to 0-13 A.D.; and others are in Coptic, Pehlevi, Sassa-
nide-Persiarr, and) loroitie-Ethiopian characters. Several fragments
in hieratie and hieroglyphic characters, the oldest from the time of
llamses Ill. [ about 1300 ".00, have also been discovered. As the
writings are for the most part tax-papers, it has teen supposed that
they belonged to It tax Mtiep, of the town of (Jrocotlilepolis, where
old pnpyri also were user ]. A large number of the papyri found
here were arquired by Cousul Travers for the Berlin Museum, and
even A larger number by Theod. Graf and Anthrluke Rainer for the
Austrian Museum of Art and Industry at Vienna. The very exten-
sive remetery of the town, with its pir-turesquc tombstones, rovers
part of the site of the aneient city; the highest of the mounds of
rubbish eornnuurd a survey of the whole of the FayGn. At tlm N.
and of the ruins, about H4 M. from Merliueh, M. Schweinfm'th
discovered the remains ot' a large temple with a pylon, in front of
which is a sitting figure oi' Ameuemhn L, the founder of the 12th
Lyn., and inside several slabs with the name of Ramses the Great.
