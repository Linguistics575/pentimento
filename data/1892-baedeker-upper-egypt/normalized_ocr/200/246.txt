without dit1ieult "; and: ome of the rooms are not acressihle at all.
In several of the apartments are hl ell-preserved wall-sculptures nfno
little interest, - 2.9. in the apartment above the passage and in the
right wing. RamsesIII. is here represented in his harem. Thenude

entrance-room to the right is well seen from before the fatrle of the
hhihiing), or who hand to him one a fig, another a pomegranate,
another a melon, another a I1ower which he smells, appeal from the
shape of their faces and from the arrangement of their hair to be

The large First Pylon CPI. C) is covered with representations
and iusvriptions. First to the right we see the Pharaoh as the coo-
queror of his enemies, and opposite is Ammon-Ra, the king of the
gods, holding in his right hand the curved sword, in his left the
