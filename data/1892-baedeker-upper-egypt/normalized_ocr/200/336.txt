260 Route 26. ROM OMBO.

A few paces farther to the S., and at a lower level than the
steles, is a small Chapel, which in spite ofits very ruinous condi-
tion, we CMI recognize as having been founded by the great builder
Seti I. The inscriptions ort the stele are completely obliterated. -
To the right of this chapel is a carefullyhewn but empty Recess, and
in the same cliff but facing N. in the direction of the two steles, is
a Tablet of a chief-priest of Ammon named Roi, who here appears
with Merenptah 1. before the god.

The Quarries on the w. bank of the Nile are of enormous size,
but few traces of inscriptions are now to be found. An Inscription
of Ameahotep HL, however, records the transport of stones by the
Nile for zt temple of Ptah (at Memphis?) There are two Posts of
the time of Eeti1., and Demctic Inscriptions from Roman timos.
Au unfinished colussal Sphinx, nearly opposite the usual landing-
place of the dhahahiyehs, is also not without interest. Even if all
the monuments of Egypt had disappeared, these huge quarries
would serve as a proof that building op erations of unsurpassed es-
tent had once been carried on here. The tmm of Kltennu appears
to have stood here, not on the E. bank. A few unimportant ruins
may be traced.

According to papyri mm" in Turin, the residence of the Mugs of the
12th Dyn., the Amenemhas and L'sertesens, was transferred to lifrenml.
Under the 19m and 20th Dyn. this town possessed a University. A palry-
ms, unw in the British Museum, contains a warning tn the students hr
this institution against excessive heer-drinking and idleness.

The mountains reeede from the river immediately above the
deNe of Gehel Silsileh (p. 255), giving space to the desert which
appears grey on the Arabian side and yellow on the Libyan side.
The narroweuJtivablestrip is tilled by peasants of a distinctly darker
complexion than the fellil1in of the Thebai0. Both land and people
approach gradually nearer to the Nubian type. At the village of
Manfyelt (E. hank) we enter the E. branch of the stream, which here
forms the island of Jlurry2r'iyeli, with a village of the same name.
On the W.bankofthe Nile, opposite the lower end of this island, lies
Abu Manyar, where Arceliu claims to have discovered stone imple-
ments in a deposit of gravel containing marine mussels, which was
overlaid by more recent deposits of the river.

On a hill on the E, bank next appears the beautiful:" Temple of
K611: Ombo, conspicuous from a considerable distance. Somewhat
nearer the river is another temple, now almost entirely destroyed.
The double door of the hypostyle of the higher temple presents an
