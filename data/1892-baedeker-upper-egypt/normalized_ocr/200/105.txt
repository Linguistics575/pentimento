Leo Africanus says that the Coptic brothers of St. George at Girgeh
were very wealthy and tells how they provided travellers with
what Was necessary on their journey and sent rich gifts for the poor
to the Patriarrh at Cairo. To this day several of the Coptic families
"G'irgeh are very rieh, possessing large estates; preeminent ameng
those is that of Bothrus. The town looks Very picturesque as seen
from the river. The Nile makes a sharp bcnd here, and the effect
is as if the w. bank, on whieh the town stands, Was atright angles
to the E. bank. The Arabian mountains rise like walls, and the
four tall miuarets of the town, on the opposite bank of the Nile,
seem to vie with them in height. A pirtaresque group on the
river-brink is formed by an old and dilapidated mosque and a tall
minaret beside it. Many of the houses in the town are built of
burnt brirk and decorated with glazed tiles. The bazaar resembles
those of other Nile towns.--From Girgch to Abydos ('Antbat ty1-
Mailfinch), 12-13 N., see belowwAt Meshaik, on the ll. bank,
above Girgeh, scholars will find interesting remains ofa temple
hearing the names of Ameuhotep Ill. and llamses 11. Some Very
ancient graves of priests of This have also been found there.
