than the neighbourhood of Ahydos, where the fertile w. bank of the Nile
expands and toifers easy cultivation and excellent dwelling-sites, removed
from all danger of inundation. This is the most ancient town in Egypt,
and its neighbour Ahythie eaunot have been mach younger, for even in
the time of the early empire it is frequently spoken of as e holy
city. It possessed the most famous grave of Osiris, of which it was

early period the grandee: "the land caused their mummies to be brought

less elaborate in its complexity. Below the Mcmnouium is a spring,
reached by passages with low vaults consisting of a single stone and
prominent by their extent and mode or construction. This spring is
