the steamboat terminus for the lower Nile, with a post and telegraph

in N. lat. 24° 5' 30". The fertile strip here is narrow, but supports
numerous date-palms, tho fruit of whieh still enjoys a high rcpuA
tation. The native inhabitants have increased under the British
oern1pation to about 10,000; but that number is only a fraction of
its former population, when according to Arabian authors, no less
than 10,000 died of the plague at one time. Some of the houses

wax, skins, horns, and dried dates. The steamers and dhahabiyehs
are here boardod by uegroes, Nubians, and handsome Beduins,
with artistically dressed curly hair, who offer for sale ostrich feathers
and fans, silver rings and armlets, ivory hoops, weapons from (Jen-
tral Africa, small monkeys, amulets, beautiful basket-work, and
aprons of leather fringe, the costume of the women of the Sttilin,
which they oddly call'Matlama Nnbia'. they and black ostrich
feathers are comparatively cheap (8 piastre == er. each), larger
and perfect white feathers cost to-WJ:. apiece and upward. Trax-
tellers who desire, to buy in quantity should betake tlsemselv0s to
mm of the wholesale dealers in the town. The bazaar is like the
bazaars ot' all Nile towns, but is distinguished for its excellent loc%
pottery of great beauty of form. Candles, porter, ale, and even
tolerable Dutch cigars may be obtained at a Turkish'bakkal'.
Copper money is, curiously enough, accepted very unwillingly in
Assuiu and the rest of Nubia; the traveller should provide himself
beforehand with silver piastres.
