chapels themselves and in the seven heeds of spnrro\v Â» hawks represented
in each. That the king should appear as the s _ nth object at worship
along with six gods is undoubtedly unusual; hut it may be explained by
the fact that Seti built the seventh chapel, not tor the adoration of him-
self white alive, but for a future period when he hoped to be merged in
Osiris. Neither Seti nor his son could avoid the interment oflheir mum-
mies near the royal residence of Tlusher, but it may he assumed that their
earthly remains received eunseruration zit Ahydos, and that the llemnauiuw
of Seti is to be regarded as a eeuotaph, in which the Name of Pharatvh,
as a symbol of the king himself. was to be honoured and preserved. The
Pharaohs or the early empire possessed similar monumen (s here. These,
however, felt into decay during the Hyksos period; and Seti Was enabled
