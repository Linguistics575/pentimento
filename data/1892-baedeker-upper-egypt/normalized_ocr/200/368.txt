286 Route 29. PHILA-T, Temple

Isis, the life giving goddess of dab, i.e. of Abaton or the holy is-
land. The last name deserves mention here, for the spot known to
the ancients as Abaten, which must have been peculiarly holy in
their eyes, is named innumerable times in the inscriptions of the
temple of lsi. It must therefore be looked for on Phila, itself. The
inscription on the Architruve of the outer or West Side state: that
the king erected this building for his mother Isis, and that he re-
built the hall for her of good white hewn stone, surrounded with
columns, with inscriptions throughout its whole extent, and, as the
line below the architrave adds, painted in colours. The inner side
of the arehitrave bears an invocation to Isis, mother of the gods.

This little temple had doors on the E. and W. sides, not,
however, opposite to each other, and another on the N. side, next
the main temple. The last leads into a spacious Fore-Court
(P1. B), cnelesed ou the right and left by covered Colonnades. The
W. colounade (Pl. F) follows the hank ot' the river, while that to
the E. or right (Pl. D) runs in the direction of the centre of the
tirst great pylon, but not at right angles to it, affording an example
of the variety of axial direction exhibited throughout the temple.

When we remember that a portion of the first Pylon and the
hypzethral space, which we have Just quitted, were built by Neeta-
nehus, and that all the other parts of the temple are of later data,
we have an adequate explanation of the great irregularity displayed
in its plan. It is quite certain that the structures that now bear
the name of Nectanebns (a portal and a vestibule) were not the
only buildings on Philm under that king, for the comtmction of
every temple, without exception, began with the sanctuary and
ended with the doors. We may aswme that an extensive, temple
stood here before its removal by the Persians; and that the latter
largely destroyed the works of their rival. The parts that were
spared were then incorporated by the Ptoleumic builders, while the
Romans united the work of the Lagidar with the ancient vestibule
of Nectauebus by means of the tapering yeristyle court.

b. The Colonnaded Court. This space is bounded on the W.
side by a Innsy wall, pierced here and there with windows, which,
based on a firm substructure on the riv er-bank, forms the hat ]: of
a narrow, but unusually long Cotonnade (Pl. F- 100 yds.). The
latter, built under the Romans, has a row of 31 (formerly 32) co-
lumns each 16 ft. high, on its E. side, and has a roof of good cas-
setted work. The colour of the hieroglyp1des and representations
is still remarkably vivid in various places, especially in the S. Ilor-
tion near the vestibule of Ncctanebus. There appear Nero with his
cartouehes, Claudius Ckesar and Germanicus Autoerator before
Horus, Tirsentnefert and Pinchtati (who also apyears at Ombos,
p. 261) worshipping the lord of Ombos. Farther to the N., on the
hawk wall of the Colonnade are the name of Tiberius and a tine
Greek inscription, beginning'Appu'ma; Amvustou 5': iv imi-
