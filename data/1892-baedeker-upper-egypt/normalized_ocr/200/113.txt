huihling operations to construct the sanctuary of his father in the
nemopolis and to hew out his statue. rRaeritiees and festivals are
richly provided for. The rest of the inscription assumes more and
more the character of a hymn, like those mentioned at p.258 aml
elsewhere.

The above will suitiise to show the filial piety, with which Ramses,
at least in the earlier part of his reign, strove to complete and ree
store the work of his father. ltut the remains of the building con-
strueted by him near the Temple of Seti at Abydos (p. 67) prove
that he also fnnndetl a large) lemnoninm for himself in the district
s; uuttiiled by the tomb of Osiris.

INTERIOR OF THE TEUPLE.
l. The Hyposlyle Halls and the Sevenfold Sanctuary.

From the Promos, containing the above inscription, two doors
only now lead into the interior of the temple: the main entrance
in the middle and a narrow door to the extreme right. The First
Hyyostyle Boom (Pl. Cl), a long but narrow apartment, makes
a solemn and imposing impression. The roof, part of which has
fallen in, is supported by'24 columns, arranged in two rows and in
groups of four. The slender shafts are surmounted by capitals in
the form of papyrus buds. Seti J. did not complete the plastic de-
aeration of the room. Ramses began new sculptures i tead ofthose
begun by his father, apparently forgetting the great ii ml piety he
arrogates to himself in the ahove-quoted inscription (p. NS).
Whether it was that the zeal of the son abated along with his grief
for his father, or that the priestly sculptors thought it better to r-cle-
brate a living prince rather than a dead one, the fact remains that
it is llamses alone who is here depicted and the temple itself is
simply called the temple of Ahydos, not, as in the earlier inscrip-
tions, that of Ra-ma-men (tie. Seti), The sculptures preserved here
are of mediocre workmanship, and the inscriptions and represen-
tations, almost wholly dealing with Ramses and his reception of
gifts from the different gods, are generally uninteresting even for
the scholarl On the rightwal1, near the second chamber, is a series
of gods, consisting of Ru, Shu (the giver of all delight) and his
sister Tefnul (giver of health), Sab (giver of life and strength),
Usiris, Horus (girercf everyxictory), Isis (giver oflife and strength),
the great god Apheru (Anubis), and Nut, who imparts the fullness of
salvation. - The six lists of the names of Egypt, on the lower part
of the walls, are also interesting. As elsewhere, the distriets are
represented as bearded male h'guvcs with the emblem of the nome
(a piece of surveyed ground, E8313) and a standard bearing the
symbol of the special district. As the lists here have no annota-
tions, they are of less value than those at Dcnderah and elsewhere.
They indicate that it was vnstomary for all the districts of the land
to pay their rows and bring gifts to the gods ofa sqywiat sanctuary
