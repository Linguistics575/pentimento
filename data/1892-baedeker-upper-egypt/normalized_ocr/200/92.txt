40 Route 9, LABYRINTH. Fayttnt,

rinth, Which was afterwards reckoned its'one UP the Wonders Of the
World" wits so Trast as to surpass all the buildings of the Greeks taken
together and even the Pyramids themselves. For the Lest description
We are indebted to Straho, who visited the Labyrinth in person. He
says:'There is also the Labyrinth here, a work as important its the
Pyramids, adjoining which is the tomb of the king who built the Laby-
rinth. After advancing about 30MO stadia beyond the first entrance of
thu canal, there is a table-shaped surface, on Which rise a. small town
and a vast palace, consisting at as mltny royal dwellings as there werty
irumterly names. There is also an equal number of hMis, burdered with
columns trnd adjoining cnuh other, all being in the same raw, and form »
ing one building, like It lung wall having the halls in front or it. Ths
entrances to the halls ma opposite the wall. In front of the entrances
: n'e lung (mil numertms pmhges Which have winding paths running
through them, in that th ingress and egress to Each hall is not
practicable to it stranger without a guide. it is s marvelhms fact that
each nt' the ceilings of the chambers consists of a single stone, and
also that the passages are covered in the same way with single shth
nf extraordinary ma, neither wood no: other building material having
hash employed. Un ascending the roof, the height of Which is incon-
sillemhle, as there is only Una story, wu olIFel-ve. a stone surface con-
sisting ofltrrge slithsl Descending'apr'1n, andlo0kit1g'ruto the halls, we may
observe the whole series borne by tweuW-seven monolithic Columnist The
walls also are ctmstrntted of stones of similar size At the end nf this
Strlluture' Which is more than a Stadium in length, is the trnnh, uunsis -
ing of a square pyramid, earh side of which is four plethra (400 fr.) in
length, and of eqrurl height. The deceased, who is burieduerv, is called
lsmsmlss. it is also asserted that so minty pslues were built, because it
was the custom for l the homes, represented by their mgmttss, with
their priests and v' ms. to assemble here to Mfer sracritise and gifts to the
gods, and to deliberate rm the most important concerns. Each home
then tunk possession of the hall Eestiruu1 for it. Sit' "allouta hundred
staulift beyond this! point, we next reach the town nf Arsinore", etc. This
tlssut-ipiiun of Stt-ttlio is unnamed hy the contents of twu papyri, one of
which is in the museum of Gi eh, the nther in privule possession (Mr.
Hood). The deities of 66 distn ts are enumerated bere, 24 of whom be-
long tn Upper Egypt, 20 to Lower Egypt, and 22 to the Fayuim.

It is very doubtful whether we should consider these buildings
of Nile bricks as remains of the ancient Labyrinth, or rather as
tombs. Certainly nothing is left that recalls in any way the Splen-
dour of the old'wonder of the world'. Except same blocks of lime-
stone, nothing remains of the extensive structures nnce ereetryl
here, save thupyramid'at the 0nd of the labyrinth'.

To the N. of the pyramid Mr. Flinders Petrie discovered Mme mummy
Cioffircs with carefully painted heath: (now in London). Gt still greater
value'are the portraits funnd at zl-Rultug/ (it, 13 M. to the N.E, of Mr
tlinet cl-Fayl'tm, which were purchased and brought to Europe by N. Thw-
