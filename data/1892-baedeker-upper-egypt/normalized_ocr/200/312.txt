pital next the central passage, the mask of the goddess IIatltur, with her
cows' ears and hcad-dress. The front of a small portable temple with
handles, which rested cm the head of the goddess, was placed on the aba,
cus, and upon this rested the architmve. The mask of Hathor here ap-
pears only or, one side of the capital; at Der eJ-hahri it appears on two
sides. This artistic form was afterwards abandoned, but was again re »
vived by NekhtrsetrftNeetaaebas IL), a rival king to the Persians, "
longing to the 30th Dyn., who loved to comyare himself to the expellers
of the Hyksos, and who therefore reverted to the art-forms intruducedhy
them Finally under the Ptolemies this form was developed into a trspital
in the fullest sense of the term. The masks are here united with the
piihths by means of a vertical Ornamental 6tripe, covering two of the
sides of the polygonal shafts and adorned with inscriptions, As each of
the sixteen sides or faces of the columns measures 5 inches in breadth,
the stripe is 10 inches in breadth. _ oh the walls at the height of the

At this chapel we turn, direct our steps towards the Nile, and in
I/t hr. reach the ROCK TEMPLE, on the right side of the valley, ctr-
cognizable from a distance by the Stair leading up to it. The latter
consists of M steps hevm in the rock, with a massive balustrade
on each side. The temple was constructed under Ptolemy JN.
Euergetes u. (Physkon), and subsequently provided with new in-
sedptions by Ptolemy N, Soter II. The site was regarded as holy
even before the building was erected, as we are informed by an M-
scription of the reign of Ramses V1, cut in the rock on the E. side
of the door leading into the mountain.

The Rnak Chamber has a vaulted ceiling covered with stucco, and,
being the sanctuary of the temple, was constructed earlier Ihan the pro »
ceding chmnhcrs to which the stair leads. The latter form two parts.
0h reaching the top of the stair, we pass through a doorway to a Fore-
Court, not quite 33 ft, wide, the exterior sides of which were bounded by
law walls built between columns. Two rows of columns in the centre led
to the door (If a smaller Hall (only MI ft. wide) of curious construction,
heing bounded on the right and left by four low walls, of Which each
was built in between { t pillar and a column, The door leading to the
rockrchamber opened at the back of this hall. This sanctuary also was
especially dedicated to Hebeut.
