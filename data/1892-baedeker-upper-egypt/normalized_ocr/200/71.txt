Nearly opposite Il6t.lah, on the E. bank, 11 M. from Beuihztsan,
lies the village of 5/12le'AMdeh, with the 1111115 of Antino'é.
Hadrian erected a new town in honour of his favourite Autinmls
on the site of the Egyptian town o? Ram, where the handsome
youth is said to have drowned himself, to fuU'tl the oracle which
predicted a heavy loss to the emperor and so to prevent a more
serious disaster. The village lies on the bank amid palms of ilrr-
11311111 Size and beauty, and to the s. of it is a brook, now dry
except after rain, which must formerly have flowed through the
towni. The remains of public buildings of the Egyptian period are
scanty. The French Expedition saw a triumphal arch a theatre,
and two streets t1anked with columns, the one running N. and S.
and leading to the theatre, the other at right angles leading to the
city-gate and the hippodrnme. A lofty column bore all insoription
of Alexander Severus (A.D 222J. To- -day, however, there are few
remains either of Greek or Roman times.Among the palms lies a
tine Corinthian capital. The marble belonging to the'very fiue gate
ol' the Corinthian onler' that Poeucke saw here and figured in his
book was burned to make lime for building the sugar-factory at
Rriilah. The extensive ruins of the ancient town lie to the E. of the
village of Shékh'Abileh. The streets and gvouud-plaus of the
houses are still recognisable. The rooms were small and the walls
were made mainly of Nile bricks. There are, however, some un-
derground Apartments of Mt Roman bricks,: rcached by stone stair.,
cases. Near the scanty ruins of one of the largest buildings lies a
basin of "bite marble, which must have had a circumference of
atleast 23 ft.
