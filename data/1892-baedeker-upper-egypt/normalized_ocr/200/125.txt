wl re, tun, sumc stulles hearing the curluuches of Ptolemy l'hilnmetor
project from the ground in a clear space. Nothing of interest is to be
seen here except one of the largest and oldest Irybhslc-irees in Egypt.
The e\teusive celnet contains numerous Cutie inscriptions. Hiero-
glyphie inscriptions b; e been found m grmtoes in a Mil to the w. of
the town.

Furr ey-5riyiid (mail steamer station) marks the site of the an-
cient chenoboskian, which is mentioned by Ptolemy, by Stephanus
of Byzantium, and in the Itinerary of Ant nine, and belonged to
the Names Punopoiites. No remains are vi ble except a few frag-
ments ortheriverwml1, withan unimportant Greek inscription of the
Human period. It owes its name, meaning "geese pasture' (X'qvu-
'/sosxsirsv, Capt. gcnccwx, from the ancient Egyptiau Geese bake),
to the fact that immense quantities of geese, a favourite food and
sacrificial offering of the old Egyptians, were reared here. Its pro-
piuquity to the home of Grenes Cvhis-Nsyrios) makes it seem quite
natural that graves of heat antiquity [ 6th Dynasty) should be found
in the neighbourhood, These are reached from the village of Kagr
ca-Sniyéd in about tl 4hr. Donkeys, but no saddles, may be ob-
taiued. through the Shékh ei-Beled. We first ride through a well-.
tilled district, cross a bridge over a canal Which waters the district,
pass the village of Isbuh. and reach the Arab hills. The ancient
tomhs, constructed orr1ght-eoloured and unusually tine-grained
limestone, now come in sight; they date from the reigns of Pepi,
Morin), and l'craeferka, all of the 0th Dynasty. The, large tomb
situated furthestto the left enntains representations and irrseriptiorrs
which are identical in style with those in the most ancient part of
the Necropulis ofMemph. l'he ceiling wasleftrougl1-hewm Some
"the smelt inscriptions cut in the living rock near the entrance
are in Coptic The representations on the inside of the eutranre-
wall have been almost wholly destroyed, but some ships may be
distinguished to the right ofthe door. On the right wall are figures
hearing: funereal gifts and a large sserifieiat table. The rear-wall
is divided into mo distinct portioas, es the left side of the tomb
has been pushed much farther into the rock than the right. In the
latter are two niches. That to the right contains an image of the
deceased, mm of the chief dignitaries under the Pharaoh llaneferka,

to the left, It mummy-shaft desocuds obliquely; adjacent is a Cop-
tie iuscription. In the deeply recessed rear-wall of the left side
are four smaller niches, probably intended for the coflins' ofmcmhers
of Tuta's household deemed worthy of special honour ,--TIse next
tomb, farther to the right, is of even greater intere > t than the one
