nn- each day fur himself, He filled the tcnl'ple with all thing. a super-
abundance of gifts of nourishment, hulls, calves, nVcn, ge ", illcense,

eapt Of his brave sword. His tceasuce-house filled with all gems,
with silver and gold in bars, the storehouse full of all things Sent as
tribute from all countries. He has constructed numerous canals, and has
planted timber of all sorts, fragrant plants from the land or Punt; he
has done all this, the sun at Kn. the lord of the diadems, the beloved
of Osiris anvl nf the gods the lunls of Aby0os'.

Like the temple of seti, that of his son Ramses Was also a
sanctuary dedicated to Osiris, though in each case the predominant
feature is the gloritication of the monarch in his apotheosis as
Osiris. Mariette was therefore on a wrong tack when he saw a
sperihl temple of Osiris in the enclosure CPI, Ill; p. 52) to the N.,
near the village of EL-Kherbelt, and spent much time and money in
an attempt to tlutl the actual grave of Osiris. Obviously this was
merely an older sanctuary, erected by the kings of the 12th and
13th Dynasties on the site of a still more ancient temple. (Two
stcles in the Lougre, numbered 0 "and C) 12, and the great stole
of Met1tul1otep, how in the museum of Gtzelt, give us information
concerning these buildings. ] Nowadays this temple is a mere heap
of rubbish, and the few interesting'tiuds' made here, such as the
statues of Usertescn I. and Usertesen HL, and some inscriptions of
the time of Tutmcs Ill., have been sent to the museum of Gizeh.
The same institution received the many hundred steles found partly
on the site of this temple and partly in the Necropolis of Abydost
Three such cemeteries are distinguished. The first, containing
tombs of the New Empire, from the 19th Dynasty downwards,
lies to the S. of the temples of Seti l. and Ramses II. Another
(NÃ©cropole du Centre) lies to the W. of the path leading from the
temple of Ramses IT. to the so-callcd temple of Osi s, and contains
graves mainly of the 5th and 11th Dynasties. Here was found the
historically valuable tablet of Una (see Bacdeker's Lower Egypt,
p. 307), who accompanied three successive rulers of the (lib Dynasty
in their campaigns. The third or N. necropolis, to the W. of the
so-called temple of Osiris, remains numerous graves of the 12th
and 13th Ilynasties, but also many of the new empire. Among the
interesting stelcs found here were those of a Neferlsotey of the
13th Dynasty and of Sheshouk, the latter erroneously pronounced
by H. Brugsch to have been a Persian satrap. The pyramidal struc-
tures found in the N. and central cemeteries are also interesting.
Still farther to the W. lies a quadrangular enclosure surrounded by
a lofty Wall and named Shunel ez-Tebib (Pl. IV; p. 52; magazine of
the Zibehcs), which probably served as a place of defence ag inst
the incursions of the Beduins of the Great Gases. A Coptic Con rent
(P1. V; p. h2) to the N.E. of this point, dating from the year 1306
of the Coptic em, scarcely repays a visit.
