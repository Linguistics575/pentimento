AHU-SDIBEL. () 3. Route.



Nehi'. In the recess at the end of the cave Tutmes HI. ts between
Horus and Sati. Jnrrmydiately to the left is the second cave (about
10 ft. deep), much less skilfully executed, in which appear ten
persons before llam~es. Among these are Scum, prince of Kush
(whose name is found elsewhere in Nuhia), and l number of scribes
and officials.

The third cave, which lies a little higher up, also shows the
t-artouche of Tutinec m. The recess contains the somewhat roughly
executed figures of four seated personages; to the right the king
and Sati, to the left the king and Horus, lord tyf1Irun.-The fourth
cave (from the S.) is the most important. It belongs to Amen-
hotep IL, who appears conducted by Horus, lord of Beheni, to a
row of gods inchttling X (hmtm, Sati, and Anuke, the gods of the
cataracts, and Horns, Ilathor, and IIeben. - To the S. of Kael-
lhrim a few ~tele < are found, one showing a victorious king in his
war-chariot.

The mountains presently retire, Iemingroom for a strip of eulti-
vatedland. Numerous Wsyivehs or water-wheels are seen. To the
left (E.) appears the village of Djimench, beside a pretty wool.
Farther on, on the same bank, lies Toshkch (Nubian "l'hree Moun-
tains'), a small place among palms, with a somewhat t1ne'rvilized
population. At Tosltlmh cl < (i'ltrlrb, on the W. bank, 7 M. from the
river, a large force of dervishesw was defeated with the I of their
cannon by the British on Aug. 3rd 1869; several that and slain
were left on the battle-field, and their weapons and clothing were
sold try the neighbouring natives. Cook's tourins may visit tlw
battle-field if they desire it.

The distrust we next enter upon is very monotonous and almost
uninhabited; and navigation is rendered diftlcalt by rocks. To the
left He Guryumli and three sbutkiss' tomhsithen the villages of Dehiit
and Fzmig. The river-bed heeomes very wide at places. (m the
right we catch sight of the eolossi that guard the temple of Abu-
Simbel.

35. The Rock-Temples of Abu-Simhel.

Cook's tryurist-steatnevs usually rearh Ahu-Simhel in the evening or
the third day, in time to permit at a visit to the temples before night.
Next nmrniug they proceed to Wadi IJalrah. U" the I'ctltnt-voyztga they
again spend the night at Ahu-Simbel, starting Ilrxt morning ""m-
to n'clock.

The two temples of Ahu-Simbel ('Father ot' the Ear of Com")
lie a short distance apart at the foot ofa precipitous clil'l' eloseto the
W. bank of the Nile. No other temple in Egypt produces so unex-
pectedly grand an effect as the great reek temyle ofllarnses IL,
especially try moonlight. By itself it would repay the trouble ot'
the ascent from Pllilm. both by the dignity of its sculptures and by
