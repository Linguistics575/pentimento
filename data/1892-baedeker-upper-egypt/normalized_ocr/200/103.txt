as the above-mcntioued Greek inscription informs us, to the old
temple of Pan, who is here represented in am ithyphaltie form. Al-
most all the inscriptions are rapidly becoming effaced, and the same
fate is overtaking a circle divided into teelvo parts and supposed to
be intended for the Zodiac. Of the second temple of Khemmis,
which Herodotus describes as dedieated to Perseus, the only You
mains are a few stones of the 18th Dynasty and some scanty frag-
ml-nts ofa building o? the Ptolcmaic and Roman period. These are
reached by the oater when the Nile overflows its banks and are
gradually being swept away.

In 1334 Maspern discovered on extensive Necr'vpnli: adjniniu: a Coptic
monastery among the mountains to the N.E. of Akhmim. Thousands of
mummies have heen taken thence ml some ofthem Weresent lo Europe.
A visit to this necrupulis is well wrrrth undertaking. The best plan is
to secure the L'umpany nf Khalil "rar, keeper of the Egyptian Museum,
and ride with him to the N.E., in the direction of the znuuntaivs. On
a mu beyond the village of P/e hm el-Ilarmisheh we see the deserted Coptic
monastery, muml which, in a with circle, lie the tombs, now mostly
destroyed. They date from the (3m Dyn ty (Pepiseneb, Kl1emsrukhVspa,
Ankhu, at I vllmn lo the Greek and Rmmn pe.riod. The grave of Tutu,
sun uf Sit amt (daughter of Osirish with liturgical inscriptiuns, is well
preserved (1% } Most 0f the mummies found here were in grind preser-
vatien, and many c-Inlziincd run; of papyrus. Amung them were many
pries (5:) and priestesses (51m of Khem, Whose geuesslvaies are carried
up to. right or ten generations.

The town of Akhmim has now become the seat of an aetive
trade in mummies, Objects of considerable interest and Value may
often be ehtaim-d from the dealers in antiquities, bat rclie-hutrters
should not try to make purchases in the presence of the keeper of
the museum.

Continuing our juutney up the Nile, we soon see, close to the
E, hunk, a conspicuous uonvent-village, resembling a fortress. On
amount of its whitewashed walls the sailors call it DÃ©r el-Abyad,
a name that properly belongs to the monastery mentioned at p 49,
uhiuh lies much farther to the W. About 50 men, Women, and
children occupy the convent, wl1ieh has little of a religious eha-
racter in its mode of life. The pretty little ehnrch, built of light
and dark bricks, is lighted by rupolas, the largest of which is above
the nave. The nave is separated from the aisles by wooden sx-recus,
The IL? el, at Holy of Irolies, at the E. end, is carefully enclosed.
In the nave, below the llama7 stands the rearling-t1esk of the priests,
and at the w. end of the church, separated from the priests, are
the seats for the Jaity. The paintings are wretched, and there are
no ol MES; but the church is an excellent spenimcn of a Coptic
place, of worship and is worth visiting, especially as it is only
5 min. walk hom the river. The monks are very ohliging and are
grateful for a small donation (1 fr., is, or mew). -Thornu, which
was occupied by a Roman garrison, must have lain in this neigh-
bonrhood.
