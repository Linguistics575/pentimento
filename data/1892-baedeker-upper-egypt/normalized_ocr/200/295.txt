have been connected with the shaft of Dir e1-balrri, in which the
royal mummies were discovered.

21. From Bihiu1 el-Mhlt'ik to el-Asasif
and Dir el-bahri.

From Bib el-uulfsk We need not return by the way we came,
but may take the path over the hill which separates the Tombs of
the Kings from Dér el-hahri and isl-Asasif. The path, which cannot
be missed, begins at tomb Ir, from tomb 17 which every nne will
visit, it is reached by going a few steps to the west. Persons not
equal to the climb may ride to the top, but it is a great strain upon
the donkeys. Riding down the hill is by no means to be Teeom-
mended. The tlonkey-% ys usually lead the animals by a narrow
path over the ridge, and await the travellers at the foot. The zigzag
path is fatiguing but safe, and is easily accomplished in 3/4 hr. The
- View is most remarkable; firs Into the desolate valley of the Tombs
ofthe Kings, then from the summit and as we descend into the pe-
culiar ravine of Dir el-bahri; we see the steep projecting mountain
side with its tombs, and buildings old and new, with the rieh green
of the fertile plain below spread out on both sides of the Nile, and
here and there its groups of palms and gigantic temples, as far as
Karnak and Luxor on the E. bank.

Those who are interested in the prehistoric stone » age, and the ilint
implements oi the childhood of the world, may notice at the beginning
ofthe path as well as 0n the top of the hill, and "they descend to her
ehhahri, several open spaces covered with fragments of flint. Lemyrmaut
and Hamy considered these to he prehistoric khiie-manataetories, and the
myriads of fragments lying about to he the work at man: but Lepsius
has proved that they are nothingmore than the fragments of ilint nodules
such as may now be seen lying about, which split owing to the rapid
changes of temperature. The travetier will in fact rind thousands of
fragments resembling knives and scrapers And this is only natural, for
whether the spiittiugis due to nature or to art, the same shapes are likely
to he constantly produced. The calcareous limestone at these bills is full
of crystals of sitex. The walls of the tombs may be remembered with
the dark broken nodules which stand out against the light-rumoured lime-
stone. ll hat Hamy and Leuermant took for flint manufactories at the
entrance of Bibén el-mmilc are only heaps of stone, cut out of the cock
with metal tools at the making of the tomb. The fragments of limestone
and flint Were necessarily removed from the excavations and were thrown
down on the sides of the valley. Un the other hand Virchow assumes
a prehistoric Egyptian stone period, and considers the st0hedragu1ents
of Der el-baruri to be tu some extent aruticial productions.

Before turning to the temple otnéi el-trahri which is seen, with
the tower of clay-bricks, as "e descend the hrll, a visit should be
paid to the Necropolis lying between b'hikh'Abd I inmah (p. 190)
and Drah Abu'l-heggah (p. [ OO) known as _

El-Asasif. The part to be visited is known by the Arabs as et-
Asasif el-bayriyel: orthe northern i sasif. Numerous tombs ofwrious
periods lie here in the series of low hills, which form the bark as
it were of the steep rocky range rising behind Dér el-balrri. Only
