granite sanctuary (p. 134) are a few halr-ruiued chambers forming
a kind of annexe to the S, wall of the temple, and partly eonstrueted
of alabaster, a substance rarely used for building. The ruins
nearest the lake date from the reign of Tutmes Ill., those imme-
diately adjoining the trympie-wall from the reign of the Ethiopian
Taherka. A square apartment, decoxated with paintings of whieh
the colours are still vivid, displays some curious deities, probably
Ethiopian, but only the upyer parts of the paintings are now visible.

Wiy now return to the doorway opening to the S., between the
third and fourth pylons (p. [ 32), upon Which is the cartouche of

Ilatnses IN. ol Ll Ra nefer ka. To the SW. of this point, in an

irregular line and at varying distances from each other, are Pylon:
VIII, IX, E, and hu. From the last of these an avenue of sphinxes
(now concealed by a small wood) stretches to the temple of Muth.
Pylon TI is turned towards this avenue" but the pylons X, IN, and
VIII, succeeding each other towards the N., gradually effect the
tmnsition to the great temple of Ammon by their position anti the
angle they stand at With referetice to the S, wall of the great temple;
for, as will be seen from the Plan, none of them is exactly parallel
with that wall. The four pylons are connected with each other by
side-walls running at irregular angles, antl thus enclosing four
courts, which however, aro no longer clearly defmed owing to gaps
in the walls. hrongh these four gateways passed the ancient pro-
cessioual route, which began at the temple ofMuth, in which were
the statues of Sekhet (p. 148), and ended "the temple of Ammon
in the space with the two orelirksCrr.l32), which may be regarded
as the vestibule ofthe sanctuary.

The series of four Courts between the pylons, which we now
visit, had an aggregate length of 310) ds. (not reckoning the Sphinx-
avenue). It was begun in the early times of the 18th Dyu. (Tut-
mes L), and Was afterwards several times enlarged and adorned.
Beginning at the gateway of annes IN, (see above), We have on
our right the fragment of wall (probably dating from Seti l.) on
the W. side of which is the famous treaty (p. 112), and on the
left the wall running to meet Pylon VIII. and probably dating like
that pylon from Tutmes Ill, On the front of this latter wall king
Mereuptah, son of Iinmscs H., tamed an inscription of great inter-
est to be carved.

From this we learn that the king vicrrtriously opposed the Libyans
and their allies, the islanders of the Mediterranean, Whose later ewped inns
against Egypt are recorded in the inscriptions at Medinet Habu (p. 177).
Under his father the Izmptinns hail advanced into Asia; now, the peoples
to the W and N. tl the Nile valley, the Litmus and Maxyans, and with
them Lycians, Sar n5. Sicilians. Achmans, and a tribe named Pulesta
