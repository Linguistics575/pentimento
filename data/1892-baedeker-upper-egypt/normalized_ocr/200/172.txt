now placed them far behind the Aliyxandriaus. Strangers sat on the

the remote Dinspolis, the Coronation-town of the Pharaohs, who
irad been aecustomed to make a trimnphal entry after each victory
and to offer thanks to Amman, The earlier noble Lagidae were sne-

the Alexandrians rose in revolt and expelled Alexander L, the
king's son. The citizens of the capital of Upper Egypt dared also
to rise in the attempt to win hark their lost independence; and
they refueed to lay down their arms even when Ptolemy Soter II.
(Lathyrus') was recalled from banishment by the Alexandrians and
was universally recognized in LowerEgypt. The army ot'Latllyrus
besieged the town, whose inhabitants bras ely defended themselves
in the huge temples, each of which served as a fortress. Finally,
however, Thebes was stormed; its treasures were plundered and
its venerable monuments terribly mutilated. Theneeforward Thebes
is only mentioned as a goal efinqnisitive travellers, who under the
Roman emperors were attracted to the File by two monuments in

of this nature wrought such havoc that Ensehius declared, though
not without exaggeration, that the Egyptian Thebes bad been
levelled with the ground. In the absence of some such natural
force, we should be tempted to decline that the annihilation of
many parts of the monuments of Thebes must have been ll task
only less difflcwult than their construction. At many points, espeei-
ally in the temple at Karnak, the injury is plainly to be ascribed
to human hands. The representations, dating from the period of
the Ptolemie within the second main pylon, to the left as we ap-

halnmers. Some smaller injuries, especially to the names of the
kings, were due to politic l reasons, as when Tutmes Ill., after he
obtained the sole power, destroyed the cartonches of his too ambi-
tious sister and guardian; others are to be ascribed to the evil habit
of certain Pharaohs of appropriatiug the monuments of their Jlre-
