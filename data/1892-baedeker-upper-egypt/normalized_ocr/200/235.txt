part of the shafts. Iieyund this colunnado is a *Hypostyle Hall
(Pl. c), which can hardly, however, be Heutified with the udenm-
shaped hall mentioned by Diurlorus in his descviption of the tomh
of tl > ynmndyas (p. 159). The inscriptions call it the "llall of the
Appearance' (compt p. 65) Dimlenls describes his halt as square,
whereas the one before us is 98 it, Jeep and 196 ft. broad. The
three Entrunt'es mentioned by Diodorns still exist, and are framed
with sculptured blorks of granite, The art ] ie forms displayed in
this hall are so extraordinarily rongrnons with earh other, the di-
Iuellr n. skilfullyealeuiated, and the proportionsso harmonious,
that we do not hesitate to describe it as the most beautiful hall ex-
tant in any Egyptian temple. in its arrangement it resembled the
rereat eolonnaderl hall at Karnak, In the centre a passage h u;
marked out by six couples of higher columns uitlt cal -capital
nn each side of whreh were three rows of lower papyrus-bn" ctr-
lnmus. Upon the latter a wall rose as high as the carys-columns,
with which it shared the weight of the roof, while a subdued but
suftieient light was admitted to the beautiful hall through openings
in tIsis wall. cm the outside of the still standing StE. wall of this
I hypestyle hall appears the kneeling king doin; Homage to Ammon.
Jluth, ainl Khunsu, farther to the left Thoth writing the Cal'-
touche of the king, and to the extreme left the king between Mentu
and Tum. Beneath is a proce sion or the sons of Ramses IL, only
some of whom, with their names, have been preserved, They are
I found in better preservation to the right and left of the door in the
IN. wall of the hall. Dietlorus mentions that the odeum contained
nnnierom wooden statues, representing persons before a tribunal
and gazing upon the judges. { eliefs efjndges, M) in number. are
said to have been seen on one of the walls [ but this has possibly
arisen from a eonfusien with the sons of Ramses), in the midst
ofthe judges appeared a presiding judg' from whose neck hung
the image oftrnth with closed eyes, and y "hose side lay numerous
books. These statues were said to intimate by their attitudes (iv).

prerident could leek only to the truth, - That statues actually
did stand in this hall mlicnted by pedestals found between the
tirst and second eoluml in the central row, It is also by no means
impn ble that a tria scene [ like the Judgment of the Dead at 1161'
el-3redineh, p.139) may hm'e occupied the wall ofone of the arljoin-
ing rhnmbers; and iti easily conceivable that the hypoatyle ol' the
"amesseuru, with wh eh a library and a famous school of scribes
were connected, may hare been used as a court by the supreme
college ofjustiee.
The representations which hav remained are com-enxetl with
