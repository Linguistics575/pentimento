105 it, in order to form the imposing smek-fapade of this temple.
At the top we see a row of'2. cynocephali (some destroyed),
which we learn from other Egyptian temples to recognize as wor-
shippers of the sun-god. Below these are the cartouches of the
king, surrounded with Urieus erpents. Then follows the short de-
dication inscription of Raruies the Great, which begins in the
middle and runs in both directions; on the right it styles the king
'beloved by Rarr11irehis', on the left'beloved by Ammon. king of
the gods'. Still lower, in a recess in the centre of the temple-widl, is
a full-reiief statue of Harm (Barr11aehis), with the sun on his head
and the symbols of life in his hands, while below, to the right, is



the goddess Ma, to the left the symbol user, thus expressing the

king's name in pict-vriting. To the right and left is the king
again, presenting figtues which also express his narne, and wor-
shipping the god. Below, and somewhat indistinct, are the double
canouches of the king.

Our attention is most forcibly attracted to the four seated Colossi
(Pl. a. b, c, d), hewn out of the rock. with their backs against the
elik, That to the left of the eutrar1eefPl.10 has unfortunately been
violently deprived of its head and arms'. which now lie on the
ground in front. The colossus on the other ide of the door (Pl. c)
was restored by Seti IL Each of those figures 13 not less than 65 ft.
high, their various limbs being in proportion. In spite of the enor-
mous scale the general effect is successful, and the t-ountenauces
have a pleasant and intelligent expression. All four represent
Ramses the Great, as is testified by the cattonches on the breast
and arms and between the legs. To the right and left of each are
~tanding figures, mostly of women; to the right and left of the en-
trance, Koferlari Meri-tn-mat, consort of Ramses; between the legs
of the injured colossus, prince Amenhikhopeshf ('Ammon in his
sword'), who is introduced in the temple of Derr as the oldest son
(semes) of Ramses IL; to the left of this colo < sus Tun. the king's
mother. Beside the Colossus farthest to the left are two daughters
of the king, viz. Nebt-tati, on the left, and Banl-anga on the right;
between the legs is an unnamed female figure, The iigures at the
sides of the colossus to the extreme right. the names of which are
concealed by the sand, probably correspond to these. In 1817 liel-
zoni spent It days in freeing the temple from the sand that had
drifted into it tram the, decert behind. JJurckhardt, however, had
mentioned it previously. It wa; again laid bare try Lepsius in 1844
andhy31ariettein1369. but the sand has already covered great
part of it to a considerable depth.

Before we enter the temple our attention is elahued by a Ureek tn.
scription uhich is found on the tattleg of the injured colossus, along with

various other Greek, ('arian, and Phtxnlcian inscriptions. It runs as
