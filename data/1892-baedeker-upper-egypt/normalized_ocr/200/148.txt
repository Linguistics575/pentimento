of gods is at her right hand and at her left; she protects her be-

mentioned union of the right eye with the left eye, feet of the sun
with the moon, at, which the New Year's festival at Denderah took
place, is one of the astronomical epochs of the calendar veiled
in mythological language by the Egyptian priests. We next dis-
cern upon poles the images of: t jackal and ofan ibis, the Sym-

described in am eight-lined vertical inscription, after which the
explanatory inscription is closed hy five more lines, as follows:

in thy festal chamber (Let probably the small kiosque-iike pavilion

were images home upon poles - small figures of gods and god-

carried in front of solemn processions. Then follow representations
of the persons taking part in the procession; the king and queen
of Egypt, and priests and priestesses, some carrying the Bukenkenu
(thirteen in number) or holding the prescribed offerings in their
