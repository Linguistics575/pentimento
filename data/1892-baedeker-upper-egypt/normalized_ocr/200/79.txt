to Assitt. TELL I-zL-AMARNAII. 1. Route. 27

here. The northernmost tomb (t 3 of chsius) shows us the king
and his family standing on a dais, below which foreign captives
are depicted. The royal pair receives rich tribute. Those bringing
the gifts are Egyptians. Ar, to Whom the tomb belongs, is adorned
with necklaces On account of the abundance of his contributions
Numerous servants carry the sacks and bottles to the open cellar-
door, in front of which, in a bending attitude, is a tnriliif with a
staff. It is possible that the cellar belongs to Ai, and that the gifts
are royal bonuties to him. - The next grave to the S., on a pro-
jecting hill, was excamted in 1853. It Was destined for Jfahu, a
commander of the royal police, aud scenes from his life (Arrest of
mountaineers. Esrurt of the king's equipage, etc.) are depicted on
the walls of the Mst L-hamber (esp. to the right of the entrance).
in the right side-wait is a. door hearing a prayer in behalf of Hahn
to Aten-Ra (the radiating solar disc). - The next tumb, that of
the royal offieial Tutu, contains (to the right of the entrance) the
almo > t eomplete text of a hymn, sung by a priest in praise of the
sun:'The breath of the wind', says the hymn,'enters their nostrils,
and Thy gift it is that they have being. All tlowers bloom and
grow in their beds, and they t1ourisl1 at Thy uprising. Festal joy
arises at the s ght of Thy countenance. All quadrupedshurry along
on their feet, all the birds in their nests ih1tter their wings in joy'.
This tomb also possesws a'papyrus' column, of unusually careful
workmanship and elaborate ornamentation. The basis of the ca-
pital is encircled, among the leaves, by a Urcreusr-scrp0nt; and at
the upper end of the shaft, below the richly-adorned hand repla-
cing the annnli, are singular decorations consisting of sacrificial
gifts, including many birds in groups of tive. - To the S., at a
little distance, lies the tomb designated by Lep'us as No. 1. This
also is dedicated to a high dignitary named Af, perhaps the same
as in Tomb 3. 0n the entrance-wall to the right is represented a
festival, whieh some interpret as that ofan order, while others take
it for the marriage of A'i, fan-bearer and commander of eavalry, to
the royal nurse. The king, denoted by the disc, his wife, and Isis
daughters stand on a this. The wurtiers, from tho charioteers to
the military oriieers and fan-bearers, receive with deep oheisances
the decorations which the Pharaoh, the queen, and the princesses
throw down to them. The foremost dignitary already wears six
necklaces, and the lady behind him is just adding a titth to the
four she already possesses. A troop of dancers enlivens the pro-
ceetlings by energetic leaps and contortions, and secretaries make
a note of the donations. To the S. are several other graves, in-
rludiug those of Apii and qut the latter a general and elrcit1hct-
lain of Ameuhetep Ill. To the NNW' ot'these tombs lay the. huge
residence of the singular king Khu-en-aten, which was perhaps
destroyed by the same generation that obliterated his name from
the cartouches.
