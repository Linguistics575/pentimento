rlietiy contains human mummies, while that to the left is packed
with mummies of crocodiles. Some of these are ofgreat size, and
in other cases bundles of 25 baby-eproeodiles are put up together.
taskets of hast contain crocodile-eggs, with the shells, contain-
ing the embryo, still unbroken. After some time we reach a, more
spacious part of the grotto, where it is possible to stand erect. It is
not improbable that the cave had a second entrance on the other
side of the hill7 but this has not yet been discovered. Great care
should be esereisol in using the lights; two Frenchmen who acci-
dentelly set tire to the mummy-bandages were sutfocated by the
smoke and burned to ashes. It was here that Min Harris found
the eelebrated papyrus MS. containing fragments of Homer's Iliad,
which was held in the hand of the mummy ofa man wearing a
Coronal of gold. The enormous number of Crorodile Mummies
found here "ill astonish no one who knows the following pasmge
in the trast1vorthy'Abdellatif (12th cent.):'Among the animals
peculiar to Egypt the crocodile must not be forgotten, which occurs
in great numbers in the Nile, particularly in the S. part of Sa'id
(Upper Egypt) and in the vicinity of the cataracts. There they
swarm like worms in the water of the river and around the cliffs
that form the 4'atnmrt <'. In his time there here still crocodiles in
the Delta. These animals are now totally extinct on thehmer Nile;
none has been seen for many years between Cairo and (iebvl Abu

and Assuin, mainly, it is said, owing to the noise of the steam-
boats. liven between the First and Second Cataracts they are now
rare, though'20 years ago they were very frequent.

The road to Assitrt, "hich we encountered on our visit to et-Tvlt
(see p. 22), leads across the Gebel Ahn FÃ©dah and reaches the Nile
ttt Berti Mahmmned, near the S, base of this hill. In the hill beyond
Hclii Mohammad are some, tombs of the 6th Dym, with uninter..
esting and half-eWeed representations of agricultural and other
scenes. In the valley lies the Coptic convent Jt" w cl-Gcbmi, con-
taining a Greek inscription (discovered by Mr, Harris) in the shape
of a dedication of the camp of the Lusitanian Cohort, which served
under Diocletian and Maximian, to Zeus, Hercules, and Nike Fic-

shanty fragments of walls of brick, which seem to hme belonged
to the fortified camp.

Between Nonfal0t and Assirit (26 M. by water, 17 M. by land)
the Nile makes several great bends, which occasion a good Jeal of
delay to navigation. The generally favourable sN.ru'. wind here
