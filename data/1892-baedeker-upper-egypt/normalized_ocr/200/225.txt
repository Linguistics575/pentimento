Minicizt Rusticn. in the Ith year of Vesp sian, heard the pheurm1enon at the
St and hour, though most uther visitors heard it at the morning'hour,

the visitor usual" waited until a more favourable occasion. Man
were so struck with the phenomenon that the: were not cunteut till they
had heard it three or four times. Hadrian, whnjmn'neyed thmugh Egypt
in 130 Ah, spent several days here along with his wife Sabina and a
1mm retluue. In his reign a perfect ilors6 of verses spread over the legs
of (he colossus, most or them by th ain crrurt-poetess Ilalbilla, the Je.

:3: far the hast verses are those on the front of the pedestal by As-
klypu'orloius, who cans himself imperial procurator and poet. They may
be translated as follows: _

'Sea-born Thetis, learn that lllemutm suffered never pangs of dying

'Still, Where Libyan muuutains rise, soands thevoiee of his loud crying _

'Oruanlaius which the Nile-stream, leaving, parts from Thebes, the huh-

'When he glows, through rays maternal With warm light illulnluated'.

'But thy son who, msrer-sated, dreadful battle still was suekiug',

About3 mia. beyond them is another Statue of great size, now,
however, almost completely covered by arable land. Farther to the
