iii' (117'). A. DO Saladin' s brother captured the citadel of Ibrtm
and plundered the ehureh.Similar disasters followed, and the
people only escaped compulsory conversion tofsliu1 by heax'y sacri-
tices, the loss of the provinces nearest to Assuin, and the payment of
a poll- -tax The Nutrian kingdom now split up into various petty
states, among which Samar, founded in 1484 by the negro-trihe
of the Fungis, rose to importance and held sway over the provinces
of Shendi, Berber, and Dongolab. This, however, was of no long
duration. Dongolah was frequently invaded by the robber tribe of
the Shégiyeh .---Is, rutit Pashu, son of Jlolurmmed'Ali, made himself
master of all these provinces in 1821. He conquered Dongelah with-
out opposition, defeated the Shégiyeh at JOrti, and acquired Sennir
also. This conquest, however, cost Isma'il his life. At a festival
given by him at Shendi, a hut in which he had been secured Was set
on tire, and he and his companions perished in the flames. But this
incident did not prevent the complete sutrjugation of the Sudan

which was converted into an Egyytian province, with the newly-
founded Iihartjsrn as its "apital. Dirffsr, too, was conquered and
annexed in 1874. But the War with Ahyssinia (1875-76), a revolt
in Ihtrftir, the rotten state of the Egyptian finances, the rebellion cf
Arabi Pasha, the victorious advance of the Mahdi, and the death
of the devoted General Gordan (Jan.1885) led to the loss of all the
Egyptian possessions to the S. of" adi Halfah in spite ofthe British
occupation ofEgy pt (1882) and the belated expeditions to Dangolah
and toKhartum (1884-35). It is but too probable that these dist icts
will remain beyond the influentuy of Egypt or of European civilira-
tion for a long time to come.

Porumnoy AND LANGUAGLI' The inhabitants of the upper
valley of the Nile, even from below the first cataract, are called
Brmibra [ ltcrbers) by the Arab population of 1hgypt. A more ac-
curate name for them is Nubianx, and as the aboriginal inhabitants
of Africa they mast be distinguished from the Kushite tribes who
immigrated ft'0i11 Asia at a very early period, partly to the N. vii
the isthmus of Sue7 and partly to the 1., across the straits of Bib
e1 Mandel, into N .E. Africa Of these immigrants the former became
the inhabitants of what is 110W modern Egypt, the latter (also
Kushites arco1ding to Lopsins) were the ancestors of the Begah
tribes, who settled to the E. of the Nile between that river and
the Red Sea. The Begah tribes also include the'Abiibdeh on the N.,
