queen Kammat, and on the wall of the second chamber, ofTakry-
lut II. and his consort Koromama, may be read here. The last
Ã©hamber (Pl. p) dates from h'eutanehus I.

l. 0n the other side ofthe girdle-wall, Le, over the hilt, is another
Building (Pl. P), erected by Tutmes 111., but where also are found
the names of King Horus, Sabakm Taharka, and several of the Pto-
lemies, including Philomet0r and Neos Dionysus. This temple was
dedicated to Ptah and Hathur, whose priests are represented. In a
chamber, which may be, described as the Promos, are traces of the
staircase leading to the roof; now fallen in, Here also are two poly-
gonal columns, whirh, taken in commotion with dedicatory'1i1scrip-
tion, indicate that the erection of the temple was begun under the
lSth Dynasty. As we again approach the N. wall of the hypostyle
of the great temple and the door by which we issued to view the
battle-reliefs ot' Seti L Cp. 127), we pass, a little to the N. of the
latter, two small ruined temples (Pl, Q) of the'20th Dynasty. The
princes ofthis illustrious line were less able to rear elaborate build-
ings at Thebes in proportion as they devoted the means at their
disposal to building magnificent temples in honour of the gods of
Memphis and still mere of Sa'is, their residences in Lower Egypt.
These little temples, now surrounded by the ruined huts of a de..
serted Arab sillago, were, according to the inscriptions, built by
Queen Ankhnes: who here appears with Psammetikh III. (perhaps
her sou?) and with her hushzmd Aalmsesi, Anhhnes was the daughter
of Psammelikh H. To the right of the entrance and in the doorway
to the left of the smaller temple is the queen accompanied by her
young chamberlain Sheshonk, ascion of the Bubastites of the 22nd
Dyn., in whose veins ilowed royal blood, Nitocris7 wife of'samme-
tikh H., also appears in the second doorway of the interior. Her
magniiiceut sarrrrrphagus is how in the museum atGizeh, while that
of Queen Ankhues is in the British Museum.

The, short projecting Wall? on wl1ieh is the treaty mentioned at
p. 142, is part of the series of "olirts and pylons which connected
the temple of Ammon with that of Muth, lying to the S. Before
inspecting this remarkable part ofthe great temple, we find mu- way
through the ruins to the somewhat more distant Lake. The Arabs
name tui Birkct el-Male/t 01' Lake ofthe Salt-pit, as the water has
become saline and unthinkable through infiltration. It is known
that each temple formerly possessed a Sacred Luke, and there is no
doubt that in antiquity the golden boat of the god used to Mat upuu
the mater Dt'this pond, kept pure and fresh. The banks were att-
ciently faced with heWn stones, and traces of these are still to be
seen on the mls, and especially on the N, or nearest ide, though
at most points they Were covered by rubbish in the course of ages.
