are interred.

The Magtahhs of Iiudiurs, which were opened by Mariette, tie to the
N. at the pyramid. These were the tombs of the reietieus of shefru
(4th Dyn.), and in many respeets resemble the xnausolea of Sehhhrah which
bear the same name, The t'ugatles of tbe most important at them are
partly unmavere6. The street of minhs, whieh is how atw.essihle, pre-
sents the apyearance of ehiii-sirie covered with masonry, irrerusted with
stucco, and provided with auteuyhau1becs, The mouth of e tomb is

tivcly large, hut the inner corridors ere hhrrhw, slope downwards, and
are covered with representations in a remarkably simple and antiquated
style. The archaic ehmeter of the scenes and hr the hiemyglypitirrs
proves the great antiquity at these monuments. The iuthrenee at the
hicrtttic Nmou is already treeeehle here, hut it does nut appear to have
hampered the emirts of the artists as mush as it did at a later age. The
admirably preserved Enlnurs are also less vumsresatiunal than those seen in
later monuments.

wall of the corridor leading to the tomb-e21an1'oer, we see the deceased
in a sitting posture, and ou the right wall he is represented standing,
with his wife behind him. Adjacent are men and wnureu presenting
ott'eriuge, as in the uuvhtahas of Ti and Ptat1hutep. The fhsslrtiat of the men
is red, and that ut the Wrimen pale yellow, and this circumstance, especi-
ully in a mmiument of this early period, is important as tending to
prove the Asiatic origin of the Egyptian nnhles. The features of the
persons represented are of the Cancasiau' and not of the Ethiopian
type. Among the Villages heluuging to Nefhrmftt, which offered g ts,
