Temple of set; I. THERES L9. Route. 199

The right hand portion of the temple consisted of a long Hull
(Pl. E) with 10 columns (no longer standing), and of tive rooms
behind, three larger and two smaller, originally separated from
it. The sculptures ofthis part are of the time of Ramses II., and
far inferior to those ofthe central building and left hand portion
of the sanctuary.

A little to the N. of the temple is It water-wheel and spring with
some guut trees, used as a. watering-place for cattle, Passing this
we leave to the left the side of the Libyan mountains with the
Neoropolis of Drah Abu'l Neggah, and continue directly by the lower
path to the valley of the Tombs of the Kings.

Drab AbuT Neggah is one of the oldest cemeteries of Thebes, and
the treasures discovered by Maviette's excavations have been of extra-
ordinary value, but the tombs are now filled up, and the traveller will
ihui nothing unless he excevatcs for himself. Tombs of the 11th, 17th,
and 18th Dynasties were discovered here, and in one of them was the
mummy of Queen Auh-Itutzp, whose precious ornaments Ltre preserved in
the Gizeh Museum (Volt L, p. 302). In her time it was the custom ta pay
more attention to the decoration of the dead hody than to that at the
tnmb. The Necropohs of Drah Ahu'l Neggah Was a source of plunder
from a very early time. There are papyrus legal documents, preserved
in London and Turin, which acquaint us with the proceedings taken
"inst thieves, who had robbed the tombs at Drab Abu'l Neggah, and
those of the queens during the 20th Dynasty.

On the return.

We enter this valley of the dead by an old road of the Pharaohs.
Beyond a rocky ravine we reach an open space, whence two roads
diverge. That to the leftleads to the mbon eb-Ulu proper, visited
by all travellers; that to the right to the W, rrross-vailey of the
gorge of the kings' Tombs. The latter route describes a wide curve
round the greater part of the Bibiu el-Muhik and leads past steep
crags, on which hundreds of vultures perch in the afternoon, to two
Kings' Tombs. We roach the valley of the Tomb of Ai (Arab. Turbet
eb-lfuriid or Tomb of the Apes) by the route leading to the right
from the open space or by a very difficult path (not recommended ]
