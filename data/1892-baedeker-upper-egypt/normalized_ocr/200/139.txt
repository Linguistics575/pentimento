such a stairrase, the name of which is in each case given, followed
by as full a description of the mom in question and of what took
place there, as space will allow. Prof. Diimichen uncovered the
inscription at the foot of the exterior wall of the temple in 1875
(p. 97), and found that, as at Edfa, the names and dimensions of
the chambers lying to the north were inscribed on the N. side, and
on the S. side those of the chambers lying to the south. He has
puhlished the inscription with a translationt.

iiguw is met with twice on the ceiling of the hypostyle room at
Dcudcrah, and it is repeated twice mate in the apartment marked
NY. en the plan and in the central Osiris-room on the N. side of
the ternple-roof. In the two last instances it occupies the entire

golden stars scattered promiscuously on a blue ground, or actual
copies of the constellations as seen at some particular time, have
been adopted as a suitable eeiliwz-decoration in nearly every Idgyp-
tian temple and tomb. The two names above given am by far the
commonest for this iirst room, but it is also called'the seat ofOsixis,
Horus, and Isis', and it is named in the inscriptions'the dwelling
of Hathow, the house of the sistrum-playirvg, the house in which the
tambourine is sounded, the seat of the rapture ofjoy, the birth-
place of the celestial goddess Nat'. The hall is 143 ft. broad, 80 ft.

The decorative designs in this room chiefly consist, after the ancient
Egyptian custom, of representations of the royal builders ot'thc

and Nero are, in turn depicted, each bearing some dedicatory gift
for Ilathor or some other of the gods worshipped at Denderah. The
ventral wall-spaces between the columns to the right and left of the
main portal are each occupied with four designs, referring to the
