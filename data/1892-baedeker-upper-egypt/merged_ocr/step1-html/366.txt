<br/>
who lives with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">children </span>and grandchildren <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>Bigeh, willingly<br/>
assists travellers. The view of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila </span>from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river-bank </span>is unexpectedly beautiful, especially to those who have just quitted the<br/>
rugged <span style="color: #0000FF;">rocks </span>of the cataract or the arid desert; while, on the other<br/>
hand, the views from the island<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>especially from its rocky S. end,<br/>
are imposing and sometimes peculiarly wild.<br/>
<br/>
The buildings on the island which demand a visit <span style="color: #0000FF;">are</span>: 1. The<br/>
'Temple of Isis; 2. The Chapel of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span>; 3. The Ruins and the<br/>
Portal of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diocletian</span>, in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>.<span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>Bigeh<br/>
and the Cataract Islands also repay a visit.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple of Isis.<br/>
<br/>
This beautiful <span style="color: #0000FF;">structure </span>dates from various periods, and its<br/>
different parts show an almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">capricious </span>irregularity in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">positions </span>with reference to each other. The traveller is recommended<br/>
to visit the <span style="color: #0000FF;">various </span>portions in the following order, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>he is warned<br/>
against lingering too long over any of them, if his time be limited<br/>
or if his inspection have no special <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>aim. It is better <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>obtain a good general impression from the whole, than to examine<br/>
the details minutely. In order to understand the arrangement of<br/>
the temple, it must not be forgotten that it was <span style="color: #ff0000;">preiiminently </span>a<br/>
pilgrim-resort. The processions of pilgrims, whether they approached from Egypt or from Nubia, were compelled to steer for<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s. </span>end of the island, for the rocks to the N. of it prevented<br/>
anything like a ceremonial approach<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The portals of the temple<br/>
therefore faced the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s.</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">festal </span>boats <span style="color: #0000FF;">disembarked </span>their passengers on the S. coast. We likewise begin our visit from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>or more exactly from the extreme S.W., to which we proceed<br/>
direct from the landing-place. Our attention is <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">attracted </span>by<br/>
the strong erection of hewn stones facing the stream. The steps of<br/>
a Stone Staircase within the <span style="color: #0000FF;">quay-Wall </span>are still to be seen on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>coast; and there was another staircase on the S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">coast</span>, to the<br/>
E. of the building of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus</span>.<br/>
<br/>
a. The Building of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus </span>(Pl. A). Two Obelisks flanked<br/>
the entrance to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hypaethral </span>Fore-Court, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the pilgrim entered<br/>
first, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>he <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>received, and perhaps also examined and<br/>
taxed. With the exception of the central portion of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>pylon<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>287), dating from this same king, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanehus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, this is the<br/>
oldest part of the whole temple. The obelisks, made of sandstone,<br/>
instead of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">usual </span>granite, were <span style="color: #0000FF;">small </span>and stood <span style="color: #ff0000;">uponptone </span>chests<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>obelisk is still standing, but the E. obelisk is represented<br/>
by its chest merely.<br/>
<br/>
The E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisk </span>itself was found prostrate by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bankes </span>in 1815, and at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>request removed to Alexandria by Belzoni, despite the <span style="color: #0000FF;">protests </span>of<br/>
Drovetti who regarded it <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>private property. From Alexandria it<br/>
was taken to England, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>it now stands at Kingston <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorsetshire</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>On the lowest part of the pedestal is a long Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription<br/>
</span>containing a petition addressed by the priests of Isis to King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
