<br/>
rubbed out. On the left (<span style="color: #ff0000;">E.</span>) wing, however, the life-like figure of<br/>
the king, shooting arrows from his chariot, and the fine rearing<br/>
horses of his chariot, are still clearly to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>distinguished<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On the<br/>
right (W.) wall also a good deal may be made out. The king is here<br/>
represented in his camp. He has dismounted from his chariot, which<br/>
waits for him, and has seated himself upon his throne. His <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers<br/>
</span>await his instructions, and farther in the background the troops<br/>
rest in their camp. The inscriptions are much injured, but it can<br/>
be made out from them that they were graven in the stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span>in honour of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>'s victory over the Kheta (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Aramaeans</span>) and<br/>
their allies. In the 5th year of the king, on the 9th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Payni</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortress </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Katesh </span>on the Orontes was stormed. The river and the<br/>
contest on its banks are still distinguishable. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Epic </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pentax</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">90 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vertical </span>lines, covers the lower part of the W. wing and part<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E </span>wing; some of it has recently been uncovered, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rest </span>is<br/>
still concealed by rubbish<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>This poem was the national epos, the<br/>
Iliad, of the ancient Egyptians. It occurs twice on the E. bank at<br/>
Thebes - <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the N. side of the pylon at Luxor and on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>side<br/>
of the temple of Karnak (here also partly concealed by earth). It is<br/>
also found, though in a very <span style="color: #0000FF;">fragmentary </span>condition, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wall<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the temple of Ramses II. at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos </span>(discovered first by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eisen10hr</span>), and in the most complete (<span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic</span>) form in the Papyrus<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Raifet </span>(now in the Louvre) and the Papyrus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sallier </span>III. <span style="color: #0000FF;">tum </span>in<br/>
the British Museum).<br/>
<br/>
The poetic text on the pylons at Luxor is followed by a prose<br/>
text, dealing mainly with the arrival of two hostile spies, who gave<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>at first that the Kheta had <span style="color: #0000FF;">fled </span>into the land of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iihirabu </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Helbon </span>or Aleppo ] to the N. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tunep</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>who on being <span style="color: #0000FF;">scourged </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">revealed </span>the real lurking-place of the enemy to the N.W. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Katesh</span>.<br/>
The king hastily recalled the Egyptian troops, but too late to prevent his <span style="color: #ff0000;">camp </span>being suddenly attacked on the S. by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheta</span>. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians </span>were surrounded, and only the personal bravery of the<br/>
king secured the <span style="color: #0000FF;">final </span>victory. This prose inscription, preserved in<br/>
full at the Ramesseum <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>in the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abu-Simbel</span>, describes<br/>
the same event as the poem of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pentaur</span>, though it dates it a month<br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
The most important and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>episodes according to the restoration<br/>
of the text by <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>de Rouge are as follows. Then the miserable and<br/>
worthless <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheta </span>with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous </span>allies lay hidden behind the fortress<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Katesh</span>. His majesty found himself alone (With his servants). The<br/>
legion of Ammon marched after him; the legion of Ra passed <span style="color: #0000FF;">through<br/>
</span>the valley <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the S. of the fortress of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shabtun </span>and marched forwards<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the centre was the legion of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pink</span>, supported by the fortress<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Armani</span>; the legion of Sutekh (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Seth-Typhon</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">went </span>upon its <span style="color: #ff0000;">way</span>.<br/>
The king had <span style="color: #0000FF;">summoned </span>all the leaders <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>army<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>who <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>in the<br/>
valleys of the land of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amaun </span>The miserable and worthless prince of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kheta </span>was in the midst of his soldiers; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fear </span>of His Majesty <span style="color: #0000FF;">dared<br/>
</span>not prepare himself to battle<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Yet he ordered forward his archers and<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">chariots</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>that <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>more in number <span style="color: #ff0000;">than </span>the sand of the sea shore. Three<br/>
men were in each chariot, and they <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>united themselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">warriors<br/>
</span>of the land of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khela</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">expert </span>with all weapons<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>He remained <span style="color: #0000FF;">hidden<br/>
<br/>
