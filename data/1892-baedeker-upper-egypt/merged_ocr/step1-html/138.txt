<br/>
</span>those in the tombs of the ancient kingdom or with those peculiar<br/>
to the times of a Seti or a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes</span>; but we cannot refuse our admiration even to these products of later Egyptian art. Here and<br/>
there (as in several chambers of the upper story) we meet <span style="color: #0000FF;">specimens </span>of hasty and poor workmanship; but as a rule the sculpture<br/>
of Denderah is pleasing and harmonious in style and executed with<br/>
a care that does not overlook the smallest detail. The eye is <span style="color: #0000FF;">uniformly </span>pleased by the harmony of the whole with its details and by<br/>
the great variety of composition which manifests itself in spite of<br/>
the prescribed form to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the artist was confined.<br/>
<br/>
Neither the general <span style="color: #0000FF;">architectural </span>scheme of the temple as a whole<br/>
nor the style of the details shows any essential variation from those<br/>
that may be traced in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">earlier </span>Egyptian temples. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>apartment, here as elsewhere, is a handsome <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hypostyle </span>Hall (P1. E),<br/>
open in front, with 24 massive columns supporting the roof (comp<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">OT</span>). Next follows a <span style="color: #0000FF;">room </span>with six columns (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">v</span>), with three<br/>
apartments to the left (XVIII, <span style="color: #ff0000;">XIX</span>, xx) and three to the right<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">XXI</span>, XXII, <span style="color: #ff0000;">XXIII</span>), from the last of which (<span style="color: #ff0000;">XXIII</span>) a passage leads<br/>
to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">festal </span>chambers beside <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall </span>B. The next room (Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">O</span>,<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>columns, has apartments <span style="color: #ff0000;">XVI </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">XVII </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0n </span>the left. A<br/>
fourth <span style="color: #0000FF;">hall </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. B), adjoined on the left by a single apartment<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">XIII</span>) and on the right by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">suite </span>of three festal chambers (<span style="color: #0000FF;">mi</span>,<br/>
XIV, xv), leads to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Adytum </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span>A), a long narrow room in<br/>
which the sacred boats were kept. From the passage (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>.) which<br/>
encircles the latter, entrances lead into <span style="color: #0000FF;">eleven </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">side-chamhers </span>(left<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">IF</span>, v, <span style="color: #0000FF;">TI</span>, VII, <span style="color: #0000FF;">In</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>, right <span style="color: #ff0000;">VIII</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Is</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">XI</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>), which are grouped<br/>
round the main chamber (Pl. I) behind room A. There are also a<br/>
number of secret passages (crypts), constructed in the hollow wall<br/>
of the temple on the E., W., and <span style="color: #ff0000;">8. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sides</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>These passages, which<br/>
are difficult <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>access, are in three stories, one <span style="color: #0000FF;">above </span>another (<span style="color: #ff0000;">comp</span>.<br/>
p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">96</span>). Finally from the central hall <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span>, doors lead on the right<br/>
and left to the two stairs which ascend to the roof of the temple<br/>
(comp. pp. 91, <span style="color: #ff0000;">97 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptians had special names for each <span style="color: #0000FF;">hall </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>side-chamber,<br/>
for each corridor <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>staircase, for each door and window, in fact<br/>
for each part, great <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">small</span>, of the more or less complicated temples.<br/>
In not a few cases these names explain the use of the different<br/>
rooms; but <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>only certain information as to the special <span style="color: #0000FF;">nature </span>of<br/>
the various apartments is obtained <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the Inscriptions, which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>arranged as a kind of ornamental border above and below the<br/>
paintings on the wall, much like the borders seen sometimes on <span style="color: #0000FF;">old-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fashioned </span>wall-papers<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>, which are of the greatest<br/>
importance both for the history of architecture and for the explanation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-cult</span>, usually have their contents arranged in the<br/>
same order. The name of the king, with all his titles and <span style="color: #0000FF;">official<br/>
</span>epithets, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>mentioned, followed by the statement that <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>built,<br/>
repaired, completed, or adorned such and such a room, or such <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
