they ignorantly confounded forms peculiar to these <span style="color: #ff0000;">roelr-tornbs </span>with<br/>
those represented in the entirely independent field of architecture<br/>
above ground. The connoisseurs and students <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Greek </span>art, blinded<br/>
by their love for the object of their study, refused to allow that a<br/>

and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>masterly essay may be taken as the last word on the<br/>
subject. He shows that the development culminating in the polygonal fluted columns of Benihasan can be traced step by step in<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cavern-strurtures </span>of the Egyptians of the ancient kingdom, and<br/>
he also shows that, though the Dorie Column of the Greeks is<br/>
known to us only in its fully developed form, some inexplicable<br/>
features in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Doric </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">order </span>are not only <span style="color: #0000FF;">justified</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>even necessary<br/>
