<span>86 Route 7. <span style="color: #0000FF;">DENDERAH</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hathor<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lae</span>, Augustus is constantly indicated by the accompanying <span style="color: #ff0000;">cartouches'Atttokrator </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Risres</span>'. The temple was probably built in the<br/>
unsettled times of the later Ptolemies, and the priests <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>therefore left in doubt whether to <span style="color: #0000FF;">ilil </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>with the name of<br/>
Ptolemy or of Augustus.<br/>
<br/>
The representations on the walls and columns, many of which<br/>
well deserve special attention, exhibit here also the Egyptian ruler<br/>
worshipping Hathor or some other of the divinities revered in her<br/>
temple. They illustrate several most remarkable ceremonies, which<br/>
the king performed according to the prescribed ritual in presence of<br/>
the images of the gods in the temple. We have seen reason to <span style="color: #0000FF;">believe </span>that the sculptured decorations of <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-chambers<br/>
</span>were executed about the end of the period of the Ptolemies and the<br/>
beginning of the Roman empire. (The sculptures in <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>of the<br/>
chambers in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sunk-floor </span>and in several of the higher secret passages, <span style="color: #0000FF;">date </span>from the reigns of Ptolemies X., XL, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">XIII</span>.) Yet in<br/>
spite of that, the entire adornment on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">wallsis </span>arranged according<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">early </span>Egyptian patterns; so that the ceremonies here depicted<br/>
were not first introduced under the empire, and probably no Roman<br/>
emperor ever took part in these ceremonies in this temple of Hathor.<br/>
The walls of the temple at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Denderah </span>exhibit exclusively Early <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Manners </span>and Customs. What we here <span style="color: #0000FF;">learn </span>are the ceremonies<br/>
imposed by the priesthood on the early Egyptian monarch who <span style="color: #ff0000;">clesired </span>to worship the goddess. Thus in a representation to the right<br/>
of the entrance the king appears <span style="color: #0000FF;">twice </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Over </span>in the same design.<br/>
First we see <span style="color: #0000FF;">him</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">clad </span>in a long robe and <span style="color: #0000FF;">carrying </span>a staff, <span style="color: #0000FF;">entering<br/>
</span>the hall, preceded by the priest wearing the panther-skin <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>sprinkling incense on the burning <span style="color: #ff0000;">censer</span>. Next we see him standing before the image of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span>, his <span style="color: #0000FF;">robe </span>laid aside; bending forward he goes through the motion of cleaving the earth with the<br/>
short <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand-plough </span>in his hand, because it was an immemorial<br/>
custom that the Egyptian king should turn the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>sod on the site<br/>
of a temple<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>(In the explanatory inscription here, as elsewhere,<br/>
this ceremony is <span style="color: #0000FF;">named'bui </span>ta', cleaving <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the ground.) The king<br/>
also smote the first blow with the hammer at the laying of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the-foundation-stone</span>, and shaped the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">brick </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>enclosing walls<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">which </span>were usually built of unburned bricks <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Nile-mud <span style="color: #0000FF;">dried </span>in<br/>
the sun. All these ceremonies performed by early Egyptian monarchs<br/>
at the foundation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>temple, are here faithfully recorded <span style="color: #0000FF;">according<br/>
</span>to early models, both in visible shape and by explanatory <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>. They are also recorded in the lowest of the four rows<br/>
on the W. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>exterior walls of the temple. In the temple of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Home </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu </span>the king is represented performing similar <span style="color: #ff0000;">ceremomes</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Another picture, also referring to the founding of a temple,<br/>
appears on the immediately adjoining wall. Here the king once<br/>
more appears before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">hearing </span>in his hand the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bnilding-to01<br/>
