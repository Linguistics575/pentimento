<span>248 Route 23. <span style="color: #0000FF;">EDFU</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus<br/>
</span>the complete rebuilding of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>temple at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu </span>was accomplished <span style="color: #0000FF;">within<br/>
</span>the period of 180 years, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>months, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">14 </span>days.<br/>
<br/>
As a kind of pendant or companion-piece to this long <span style="color: #ff0000;">historicalinscription </span>of the W. girdle-wall, there appears another no less <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Inscriytion </span>at the foot of the E. Girdle Wall (P1. k). This<br/>
second inscription, which has a total length <span style="color: #0000FF;">oi'2M</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>ancient Egyptian<br/>
ells, contains <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>summary account of the whole temple, followed by<br/>
a detailed description of each of its rooms. Like <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>dedicatory inscriptions of the kind, it begins with the name of the monarch<br/>
under whom the monument it refers to <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>in the present case, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">girdle-wall </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>was completed.<br/>
<br/>
The inscription begins as follows:'The golden Horus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>shows<br/>
himself in heaven as the wing-spreading god of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu</span>, clad in bright<br/>
plumage, he has taken possession of his abode... prepared <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">NI</span>. Alexander <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'This </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful </span>large wall, behind his <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple </span>at the side <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>his father's<br/>
building, its length 240 ells, its breadth 90 ells, its height to the summit<br/>
20, the thickness of its foundation <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gens</span>. This monument, which was<br/>
erected by His Majesty and his father, is formed like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-mountain<br/>
</span>of heaven<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>These dimensions <span style="color: #0000FF;">correspond </span>with measurements made by<br/>
the writer. The length of the girdle-wall <span style="color: #0000FF;">lo </span>the pylons was found to <span style="color: #0000FF;">he<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">4141/</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>, which reckoning the ancient Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">13/4 </span>ft., is equal to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">240.5g </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ails</span>; breadth <span style="color: #0000FF;">1333/4 </span>ft. <span style="color: #ff0000;">= </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">89.12 </span>ells; height 331/2 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>= <span style="color: #0000FF;">19.5 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ems</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">thickness </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">61/2 </span>ft., Le. not quite <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>(instead of 5) ells<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>We may now bestow a glance on the general arrangement of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">temple </span>as a whole. The main axis lies W. and S., as is repeatedly<br/>
mentioned in the inscriptions referring to this point<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Â©<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0 </span>m,'from Orion (the S.star) to the Great<br/>
=<br/>
<br/>
Bear (the N. constellation)'. The early Egyptian architects seem to<br/>
have been guided <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>these two constellations in determining the<br/>
orientation of any new temple, as appears to be indicated with some<br/>
certainty by inscriptions at <span style="color: #0000FF;">EMu</span>. The laying of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">foundationstone </span>of an early Egyptian temple was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">ceremony </span>of peculiar solemnity, in which the king himself, as has been observed in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">account </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Denderah </span>(p. 86), took part; and even in the case of<br/>
temples built at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>time <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>the rulers of Egypt had ceased to<br/>
share personally in these ceremonies (as <span style="color: #0000FF;">6.9. </span>under the Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">em-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">perors </span>who did not live in Egypt at all), the inscriptions still sometimes speak in the old-fashioned style as though the monarch had<br/>
duly performed his part. An <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>along the foot of the wall<br/>
in Hall D states that'His Majesty in his proper person, with his<br/>
hand on the wooden peg and holding the line in his grasp, along<br/>
with the goddess <span style="color: #ff0000;">Safekh</span>, is to be found beside his measuring-instrument to determine the four corners of the temple at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edfn</span>'. This<br/>
N. and S. axis divides the entire building into a right and a left<br/>
(or W. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">H</span>) half, reckoned from Room I (p. 252), which occupies<br/>
the exact centre of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall </span>of the temple, and is named in<br/>
the inscriptions'divider of the middle'. All the walls and rooms<br/>
to the right of this line (as <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">look </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>are described in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscrip<br/>
