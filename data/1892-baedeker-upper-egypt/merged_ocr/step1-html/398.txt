</span>divided into three apartments. A door leads to the outside from<br/>
each side of the first apartment. Behind the temple proper, which<br/>
is only <span style="color: #ff0000;">42 </span>ft. long, is a small recess hewn in the rock, and adorned<br/>
on the outside. The N. and S. outside walls of the temple are also<br/>
sculptured.<br/>

</span>The village <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gerf </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Husén </span>occupies the site of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tutzis</span>, a place<br/>
mentioned in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Itinerarium </span>Antonini, 20 Roman miles, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. 18<br/>
Engl. M., <span style="color: #0000FF;">above </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Talmis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Aialabsloeh</span>). The sacred name of this<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:1<br/>
</span>place was, Pa <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pink</span>, the House <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofPtah</span>. The pylon, of which<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gran </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Charup0llion </span>saw traces in front of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-temple</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">bas<br/>
</span>disappeared, having been washed away by the stream. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ward </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5797/<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Q</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>means, in fact, a bank washed away by a stream. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Several<br/>
<br/>
</span>sphinxes, with small statues of the king, still remain, forming an<br/>
avenue from the river-bank to the temple. Next to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylon </span>was a<br/>
Vestibule, built outside the hill, while the temple properis hewn<br/>
in the rock. In this vestibule two columns to the left are still<br/>
standing (the two to the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>disappeared), and seven of the<br/>
original eight pillars, with somewhat clumsy Osiris-statues. The<br/>
last bear on their shoulders the name of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.</span>, who built this<br/>
temple and is the only king mentioned in it. He appears not only<br/>
as the founder, but also as one of the deities to be worshipped here<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>On the beams of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">arehitrave </span>he is named with both his names as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lord </span>of the festivals like his father Ptah, as the ruler of Egypt<br/>
and conqueror of his foes (expressed <span style="color: #0000FF;">pictorially</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. The next room<br/>
(45 ft. square), hewn out of the rock, requires <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>light; it<br/>
produces a serious and gloomy effect. The ceiling is supported by<br/>
six Osiris-pillars, 28 ft. high, representing the king as Osiris, with<br/>
the crown on his <span style="color: #0000FF;">head</span>, his crossed arms <span style="color: #ff0000;">bearing </span>the signs of rule<br/>
