for the accommodation is somewhat limited. Greater care is required<br/>
in the choice of companions for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dhahabiyeh-voyage</span>, for the close<br/>
and constant intercourse in rather <span style="color: #0000FF;">narrow </span>quarters and for perhaps two months at a time is apt to produce somewhat strained relations between those who are not originally sympathetic. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'dhahabiyeh </span>devil', indeed, is famous in Egypt for causing those<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>have embarked as friends to disembark as foes. In especial <span style="color: #0000FF;">tray-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ellers </span>with <span style="color: #ff0000;">seientifie </span>aims should avoid travelling with those who<br/>
have no particular interest in the gigantic remains of antiquity, and<br/>
who are thus constantly wishing to push on hurriedly from sheer<br/>
ennui<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In all cases it is prudent to distribute the various <span style="color: #0000FF;">cabins<br/>
</span>and seats on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">divan </span>by lot before starting.<br/>
<br/>
A government tax of 100 pias. (20s. <span style="color: #ff0000;">6d</span>.) is levied upon all visitors to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monuments </span>of Upper Egypt, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">devoted </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the maintenance <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">such<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">monuments</span>. The tax <span style="color: #ff0000;">may </span>be paid and cards admitting to the temples etc.<br/>
obtained at the Museum of Gizeh or at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cook</span>'s or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gaze</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">Office</span>.<br/>

<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">steamers </span>belonging to Messrs. Thomas Cook & Son (<span style="color: #ff0000;">offlees</span>,<br/>
see p. xv) are the best on the Nile, as well in point of comfort and<br/>
cleanliness, as in point <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">organization </span>and attentive service<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Cook's<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">TOURIST </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">STEAMERS </span>between Cairo and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assut</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'m </span>start every alternate<br/>
Tuesday from the middle of November till the end of December,<br/>
and every Tuesday from that date until the middle of March, spending 20 days on the voyage to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">back</span>. Extra-steamers<br/>
are also run at the most crowded time; while two special excursions<br/>
are organized in the course of the season, allowing four weeks for<br/>
the double voyage. The three-weeks service is carried on by the<br/>
steamers Rameses the Great, Rameses, Prince <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammad </span>Ali,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Teujik</span>, and Prince Abbas, of which the two <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>are the best. The<br/>
fare is 501., or for occupants of the two superior cabins, specially<br/>
adapted for invalids, <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t. </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">four-weeks </span>steamer is named Sethi;<br/>
fare <span style="color: #0000FF;">651</span>. The fares include provisions (<span style="color: #0000FF;">wine </span>etc. excepted), all<br/>
necessary travelling expenses, donkeys, English saddles for ladies,<br/>
boats to cross the river, the services of dragomans and guides, and<br/>
bakshish to guides. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-boys</span>, however, usually look for<br/>
a small bakshish from the traveller, who is also expected to bestow<br/>
a gratuity upon the attendants on board the steamer. The tax<br/>
levied by the Egyptian Government <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see above) is also not included<br/>
in the fares. Each <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller </span>is entitled to ship 200 lbs. of personal<br/>
luggage not exceeding 2 cubic <span style="color: #ff0000;">metres </span>in measurement. A physician<br/>
is carried on each steamer, whose services, if required, are paid for<br/>
in addition to the fare. A deposit of <span style="color: #0000FF;">lot</span>. must be paid on taking<br/>
a ticket at Cook's offices in Europe. The name, sex, and nationality<br/>
of the passenger must be inserted at the time of booking. Tickets<br/>
are not transferable except with Messrs. Cook's consent. Ifa traveller be prevented by exceptional circumstances from joining the<br/>
steamer for which he has booked he may <span style="color: #0000FF;">proceed </span>with the following<br/>
