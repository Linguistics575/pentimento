<br/>
the tomb of Osiris, of the righteous prophet of Ammon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Neferhotep</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>After an introduction<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>wishing peace to the dead, and glorifying the<br/>
sun-god, it continues literally as follows:<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Celehrate </span>the great day, <span style="color: #0000FF;">o<br/>
</span>prophet. Well is to thee, fragrant resin and ointments are laid before<br/>
thee. Here are wreaths and flowers for the waist and shoulders of thy<br/>
sister, who is pleasant to thine heart, as she rests beside thee. Let us<br/>
then sing and strike the harp in thy presence. Leave all cares behind<br/>
and think of the joys, until the day of the voyage comes when man casts<br/>
anchor on the land <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>delights in silence'.<br/>
<br/>
Near <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>is the once splendid tomb of another Neferhotep, overseer of the cattle of Ammon, but now in ruins and used as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">magazine </span>by the keeper of the Gizeh museum. There may also be visited<br/>
in the neighbourhood the tombs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">KherM</span>, of the time of Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, of Moi, and of an <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieial </span>in charge of the stables of<br/>
Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, the inner room of which is the resting place of<br/>
Mahu, a writer of the treasury in the time of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.<br/>
<br/>
</span>If the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dhahahtreh </span>is lying at Luxor, the small boat should be ordered<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">wait </span>with some men on the left bank of the river at the E. end of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">island</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

<br/>
Second Day on the W. bank: 1. Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Furnah</span>; 2. Tombs of the<br/>
Kings <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bibitn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">erofuNkr</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Necropolis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Asasif </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Drah </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Atnf1Neggah</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">k. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Der </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-bahri</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>To the W. bank as on the previous day, see p. 152. From the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place </span>of the ferry we ride across the fields in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>northerly<br/>
direction and in 3/4 hr. reach the handsome <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Temple</span>, the front of<br/>
which with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span>is visible at a considerable distance. The<br/>
original building (see the annexed plan) <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>of smaller dimensions<br/>
than the Ramesseum and Medinet <span style="color: #0000FF;">Habu</span>, its complete length being<br/>
518 ft., and of this only the actual sanctuary with its halls and<br/>
chambers, 153 ft. in depth remain, while there are only scanty<br/>
remains to <span style="color: #0000FF;">prove </span>the former existence of two Courts and the Pylons<br/>
which enclosed them. The Sphinxes which were placed <span style="color: #0000FF;">like </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">guardians </span>to the right and left of the door leading into the first Court<br/>
on the inside, are half <span style="color: #0000FF;">covered </span>with earth. They were placed there<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seti </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, and on the bases were inscribed the names of all the<br/>
nations which he had conquered. Of all the buildings in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neeropolis </span>of Thebes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reminds </span>us ofthe <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memnonium </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofAbydos<br/>
</span>(p. 54), and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">closer </span>inspection of the style of inscriptions and representations will both bring out and explain their similarity, for<br/>
the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kumah </span>was founded by Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, the builder <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos</span>,<br/>
and both the sanctuaries were restored and completed by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>They both served the same purpose<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>where the manes of<br/>
the founder might be remembered, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>made. At Abydos<br/>
it is true that throughout attention was paid to the pilgrims to<br/>
Osiris, while here it is the gods of Thebes that <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>prominent, and this was the centre of the festival of the mountain valley,<br/>
