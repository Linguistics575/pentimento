<span>134 Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">1 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">J. </span>KARNAK<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>East Bank<br/>
<br/>
creation of the world has anything been made like what has been<br/>
erected by the child of the sun <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khnumt-Amen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasn</span>, who bestows<br/>
life, eternal like the sun'. The queen is uniformly referred to by the<br/>
feminine pronoun, though she is represented as a man and named'a<br/>
son of the sun'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the rectangular base of the obelisk it is recorded<br/>
(N. side) that the queen erected it in seven months in the 16th and<br/>
17th years of her reign, and (E. side) that it was overlaid with gold,<br/>
that the queen herself weighed out the necessary gold in sacks and<br/>
bars, so that (S. side) the people on both <span style="color: #0000FF;">banks </span>beheld it glittering<br/>
at sunrise. - The <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span>are enclosed by a rectangular granite<br/>
wall, 12-15 ft. in height.<br/>
<br/>
As <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>proceed towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E.</span>, we pass another Pylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jn</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Y</span>),<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">completely </span>ruined, and enter a SECOND <span style="color: #0000FF;">COLONNADE</span>, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osirisfigures </span>representing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>I. In each of the spaces to the right<br/>
and left are <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>pairs of columns. Between them was a central<br/>
space enclosed by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tntmes</span>, with two <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Osiris-statues embedded<br/>
in the wall. An inscription informs us that this surrounding wall<br/>
was raised by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>III. to cover the monuments of his father<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>,'so that the monuments of his father Usertesen (12th<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dyn</span>.) and the monuments of his fathers, kings <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Upper </span>and Lower<br/>
Egypt, should not be seen in presence of his own'.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">walls </span>of this narrow room, and on the right and left of<br/>
the gateway with granite pillars <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>forms the opening of Pylon <span style="color: #ff0000;">Y</span>,<br/>
are the name-labels of the peoples conquered by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill</span>. The<br/>
S. peoples are named on the right:'List of the S. lands, of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Anu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kenes </span>from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ehent-hunmefer</span>, defeated by His Majesty, he<br/>
wrought havoc among them, their multitude is not known, he brought<br/>
all that belonged to them as living captives to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">till </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">work-house </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>Ammon-Ra'. Beneath are 116 name-rings of conquered tribes of the S. lands; first those of Kush (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ethiopians </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>the<br/>
Cush of Scripture), then those of Punt (Arabians), and lastly the<br/>
Libu (Libyans). On the left are the names of N. peoples, above<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is an inscription:'List of the tribes of the upper <span style="color: #ff0000;">Retenm1</span>,<br/>
captured by His Majesty in Magda, the miserable place, their<br/>
children brought by His Majesty as living captives to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortified<br/>
</span>place in Apt-asu (Thebes) from his first campaign, as commanded<br/>
him by Ammon, who has led him by good paths'. (Two similar lists<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>and S. tribes, one of them being still more complete, are to<br/>
be found on Pylon <span style="color: #ff0000;">VIII</span>, lying to the S.; comp. p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1-16</span>.)<br/>
<br/>
We now traverse a kind of pronaos and enter the Sanctuary<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>F), a chamber built of hard granite. The frequent repetition<br/>
of the name <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofPhilip </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Aridasus </span>on its walls might lead one at first to<br/>
suppose that this apartment is a comparatively recent structure,<br/>
dating from the reign of this royal puppet under whom the power<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>really wielded <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, son of Lagus <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Soter</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. But Philip<br/>
is here named only as <span style="color: #0000FF;">restorer</span>, not as founder, and certain <span style="color: #0000FF;">fragments </span>of statues found farther to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E.</span>, afford a proof, as we shall<br/>
