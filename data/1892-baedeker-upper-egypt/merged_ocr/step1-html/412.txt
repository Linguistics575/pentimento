</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'Herod0t1ts </span>of Halicarnassus beheld and admired'. Beneath, in a<br/>
later style of writing, is the word <span style="color: #ff0000;">OYAAMQE'not </span>at all', indicating<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unauthentic </span>character of the inscription above.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">31/231</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Derr, on the E. bank, prettily situated beneath <span style="color: #0000FF;">sycamores </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>date-palms, contains mud-houses. The one <span style="color: #0000FF;">brick-building </span>is the residence of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">IGshef</span>, who was formerly independent<br/>
ruler of Lower Nubia and owned a large harem. Outside the town,<br/>
about <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-way </span>to the hill, lies the mosque of a saint. The top of<br/>
the hill commands an attractive view of the town and the Nile. Near<br/>
its foot lies the small and unfortunately <span style="color: #0000FF;">mueh </span>injured Rock Temple<br/>
of Derr. The vestibule, the sides of which were formed by the<br/>
smoothed rocks of the hill, and which was <span style="color: #0000FF;">421/211</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>deep by 46 ft.<br/>
broad in the open air, contained a triple row of pillars, of which the<br/>
hindmost alone is standing. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">row </span>has <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris-figures </span>against the<br/>
pillars (as at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medinet-Habu</span>, p. 175, etc<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>The two front <span style="color: #0000FF;">rows </span>and<br/>
the gateway are now represented only by fragments a few feet in<br/>
height. On the back of the left side of the gateway are some traces<br/>
of a warlike scene, with chariots and warriors. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">right </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">side-wall<br/>
</span>of the vestibule was covered with warlike representations, now much<br/>
damaged, in three rows. In the topmost row only the legs of the<br/>
figures are now left. In the second row Ramses IL, founder of this<br/>
temple, can be distinguished in his chariot accompanied by a lion,<br/>
before a group of <span style="color: #0000FF;">prisoners</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The lowest row showed the king<br/>
launching arrows against his fleeing foes. We see the fugitives conveying their wounded to the mountains, where a <span style="color: #0000FF;">herdsman</span>'s family,<br/>
surrounded by their domestic animals, <span style="color: #0000FF;">wait </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>grief and anxiety for<br/>
their son. On the left <span style="color: #ff0000;">wall </span>also are remains of three scenes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">including </span>one in which the king leads two rows of captives to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>.<br/>
The third row of pillars, hewn out of the rock and still standing,<br/>
bore dedications from the king to various gods. The representations<br/>
on the back wall of this hall, to the right and left of the entrance<br/>
into the dark excavated part of the temple [ lights necessary), are<br/>
specially <span style="color: #0000FF;">effective</span>.<br/>
<br/>
On the right side the king holds by the hair some foes, bending<br/>
in presence of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-Ra</span>, while between the king's legs is his<br/>
lion, here said to follow the king and to slay his enemies. The<br/>
heads of the king and the god are unfortunately destroyed. To the<br/>
left of this scene <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>two smaller ones showing the king before Ptah<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>(Sekhet) before Thoth. Beneath is a row of the king's daughters<br/>
with sistra, corresponding to a row of his sons, with fans, headed<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenhikhopeshf</span>, on the left wall. The chief scene on the left<br/>
wall, above the king's <span style="color: #0000FF;">sons</span>, shows the king fighting against his foes<br/>
in presence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hawk-headed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>, with the lion biting the<br/>
leg of one of the foes<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In the small adjoining scene<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Ramses presents<br/>
the ram's-headed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnum </span>with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of Ma, goddess of truth.<br/>
