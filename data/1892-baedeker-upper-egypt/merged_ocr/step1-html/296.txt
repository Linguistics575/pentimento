<br/>
a few tombs at <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Asasif </span>are usually visited by the ordinary traveller.<br/>
Some belong to the 18th and 19th Dyn., but the most important<br/>
are of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">26th</span>. Broken walls seem to indicate that the cemetery<br/>
was divided into sections. We also find here various brick buildings and a large arched doorway. During Mariette's <span style="color: #0000FF;">excavations<br/>
</span>many mummies <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>found, not in regular tombs, but either in the<br/>
earth itself, or in small vaults 3 to 6 ft. below the <span style="color: #0000FF;">surface</span>. In some<br/>
of them, papyrus-rolls of great value were discovered. The tomb of<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Petamenap </span>< D <span style="color: #0000FF;">eee </span>S) is larger than Nos. <span style="color: #0000FF;">14 </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">17<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Blban </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Muliik</span>, and is worth a visit on account of its great size.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Petamenap </span>was a prince of the empire and an <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">96th<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dyn.</span>, whose remarkable position entitled him to the unusual honour<br/>
of completing buildings at the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nedinet-Ilabu</span>, and of<br/>
placing his name upon them. The tomb is cut out of remarkably<br/>
beautiful limestone<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>and its inscriptions display the <span style="color: #0000FF;">neatness </span>of<br/>
finish which is peculiar to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sculptures </span>of the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">renaissance</span>. It has become the home of thousands of bats, which render<br/>
the attempt to copy the inscriptions in the inner rooms <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult<br/>
</span>by constantly extinguishing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">light</span>. The smell<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>moreover, which<br/>
they cause is so strong and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offensive </span>that a <span style="color: #0000FF;">thorough </span>inspection of<br/>
the tomb is recommended only to those who can overcome the <span style="color: #0000FF;">feeling </span>of nausea. Any one who is subject to <span style="color: #0000FF;">giddiness </span>should avoid<br/>
going far into the tomb, as in the middle it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">necessary </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">balance<br/>
</span>oneself, though only <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few steps, along a narrow path on the<br/>
edge of a deep shaft. Sir Gardner Wilkinson undertook the measurement of the tomb, and the inscriptions have been almost completely<br/>
copied and partly published by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diimichen</span>. These are <span style="color: #0000FF;">important</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>for the details of the funeral <span style="color: #0000FF;">ceremonies</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The entrance, as in almost all the tombs in this part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis</span>, is by an open <span style="color: #0000FF;">courtyard </span>without <span style="color: #ff0000;">walls,103 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>wide and <span style="color: #0000FF;">76 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span>deep,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>leads to a hall in the rock (the mortuary chapel), with <span style="color: #ff0000;">sidechambers </span>and passages. This is <span style="color: #ff0000;">67 </span>ft. wide <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>ft. deep, and its <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof<br/>
</span>is supported by two rows of pillars. <span style="color: #ff0000;">All </span>the walls are ornamented with<br/>
inscriptions and reliefs carefully executed, but now unfortunately much<br/>
injured and blackened. <span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span>almost without exception, refer to the fate<br/>
of the soul in the lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">world</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>A vaulted Corridor leads into a second<br/>
large <span style="color: #0000FF;">Room </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">53 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span>by 37 ft.) <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>8 pillars remain to prevent the roof<br/>
from falling, while in the Room adjoining it, <span style="color: #0000FF;">321/211</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>square, only t have<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>spared. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chamber </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>niches (21 ft. by 12 ft.) concludes this series<br/>
of rooms, the total length of which together with the courtyard <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">312 </span>ft.<br/>
The nature of the stone having apparently prevented further advance <span style="color: #0000FF;">into<br/>
</span>the rock in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">direction</span>, the masons turned to the left and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dug </span>out a<br/>
wide Hall, and also to the right, where six successive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Passage</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Were<br/>
</span>made at right angles leading to a small room. These not being on the<br/>
same level Were connected <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>flights of <span style="color: #0000FF;">respectively </span>9, 23, and 9 steps.<br/>
In the small room mentioned is a shaft <span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>ft. deep with a chamber.<br/>
Caution is necessary here. This series <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">passages </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">177 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>in length.<br/>
From the room containing the shaft a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Corridor </span>runs again to the<br/>
right, and leads to a transverse Chamber, making 60 ft. in this direction.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">However</span>, before reaching the <span style="color: #0000FF;">steps </span>on the second line, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>leading<br/>
to a second shaft a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fourth </span>set <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>passages to the right, 125 ft. long in a<br/>
straight direction. Adjoining this on the left is a large Gallery, <span style="color: #ff0000;">58ft</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
