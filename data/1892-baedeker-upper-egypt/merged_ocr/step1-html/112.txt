<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tions</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>continues as follows, with special reference to<br/>
this temple:'For <span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span>, while the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra-ma-men </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">ale</span>. Seti I.)<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>still building both hack and front, Seti ascended to heaven,<br/>
before his <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memnoninm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Oremui</span>) was <span style="color: #0000FF;">completed</span>. The columns had<br/>
not yet been <span style="color: #0000FF;">placed </span>upon their bases, the statue lay on the ground<br/>
and was not yet finished off, when he (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sen</span>) became <span style="color: #0000FF;">acquainted<br/>
</span>with the tomb (the'golden room', the principal <span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber </span>of Seti's<br/>
tomb at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Biban </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Mitok</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, etc. Then said His Majesty to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sealbearer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">side </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>Summon the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eourtiers</span>, the military commanders,<br/>
and their fellows, and also the whole multitude of <span style="color: #0000FF;">architects </span>and<br/>
librarians. When these were <span style="color: #0000FF;">conducted </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>His Majesty, pressing<br/>
their noses in the dust and their knees to the earth, they broke out<br/>
into rejoicing and smelled the ground (<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>prostrated themselves).<br/>
They raised their arms, praising His <span style="color: #0000FF;">Majesty</span>, and prayed to this<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">benignant </span>deity, celebrating his <span style="color: #ff0000;">perreetiod</span>. Then follow emphatic<br/>
expressions of worship, addressed to the king.<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Then </span>spoke <span style="color: #0000FF;">His<br/>
</span>Majesty unto them and said: I summoned you before me on account<br/>
of a plan that has entered my mind. I have seen the buildings of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">neeropolis </span>and the tombs that are at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos</span>, and also those<br/>
who have to work there. Truly nothing has been restored since the<br/>
time of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">lord </span>unto the present <span style="color: #0000FF;">day</span>. But when a son finds himself on the throne of his father, shall he not renew the monument<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Menim</span>) of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">begetter't</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>From childhood until now I have<br/>
been a prince. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>gave me the earth as a gift, and while I <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>yet<br/>
in the egg the great ones of the earth <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frustrated </span>themselves before<br/>
me<span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>I have called my father to a new life in gold (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Le </span>as a<br/>
statue) in the first year of my <span style="color: #0000FF;">exaltation</span>. I have given orders that<br/>
his temple be adorned and l have made sure <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>possession of the<br/>
land... I have offered him <span style="color: #ff0000;">saerifiees</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">...</span>. And now, when his<br/>
building stood in my power, I watched over all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">labours </span>connected<br/>
with it<span style="color: #0000FF;">...</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>I enlarged and renewed his palatial structure. I did<br/>
not neglect his foundations, as wicked <span style="color: #0000FF;">children </span>do, who do not<br/>
respect their father... I built anew the walls of the temple of<br/>
my begetter. I presented before him the man whom I had selected<br/>
to superintend the works<span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>I erected pylons in front of it, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Covered </span>his house with clothing (sculptures), I have adorned its<br/>
columns and provided stones for the foundations<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>work<br/>
was the monument, doubly as glorious as at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is (named) after<br/>
my name and after the name of my father, for, as the son, so is also<br/>
the father<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. In the following <span style="color: #0000FF;">sentences </span>Ramses is praised as a model<br/>
son and the highest gifts of the gods are assured to him.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Since </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra </span>there has never been a son who has accomplished what<br/>
thou hast<span style="color: #0000FF;">... </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thou</span>, thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">workest</span>, thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">renewest </span>one monument<br/>
to the gods after another, according to the command of thy father<br/>
Ra'. The whole <span style="color: #0000FF;">world </span>obeys him and brings him <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>After<br/>
the grandees have finished their oration, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>more orders the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">offieials</span>, masters, artists, labourers, and all others engaged in the<br/>
