see, that a temple must have stood upon this spot even before the<br/>
epoch of the Hyksos. The building <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofevery </span>temple, without <span style="color: #0000FF;">excel</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tion</span>, began with the construction of the sanctuary; and beyond<br/>
doubt, we are here standing in front of the most ancient part of the<br/>
entire temple of Ammon. The granite pillars to the right and left,<br/>
on which a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">flower-Calyx </span>appears between two smaller ones,<br/>
also date from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill</span>. Beyond these pillars and a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">antechamber </span>we reach the space usually regarded as the Sanctuary. It is<br/>
built entirely of pink granite, and is divided into two chambers, a<br/>
very uncommon arrangement, although easily <span style="color: #ff0000;">explainedin </span>the present<br/>
case (see below). The front chamber, opening to the W., is <span style="color: #0000FF;">19 </span>ft.<br/>
long, the hinder one, opening to the E., over 25 ft. The roof has<br/>
been completely destroyed; and a slab of granite, leaning obliquely<br/>
downwards, seems as though on the point of falling. The latter<br/>
was adorned with stars, and traces of colour are seen both upon it<br/>
and upon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall </span>but the sculptures were never fully completed,<br/>
and the red outlines which served as a guide to the sculptor may<br/>
still be made out here and there. The holes in which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">doorhinges </span>were fixed, still show traces of verdigris, a proof that the<br/>
hinges <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>made of copper or bronze.<br/>
<br/>
The entire double-chamber and the pillars at <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>entrance date<br/>
from the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">111</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Mariette believed, probably with<br/>
justice, that the actual sanctuary, or at least the original <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary<br/>
</span>of the 12th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dyn.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lay </span>behind (Le. to the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>the granite chamber,<br/>
because that would alone explain the opening at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>A stele preserved in the museum at Gizeh records that<br/>
the temple of Karnak was in existence as early as the close of the<br/>
11th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>, though then <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span>importance. Wilkinson found the<br/>
name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span>I. (12th Dyn.) on a shattered <span style="color: #0000FF;">pedestal </span>to the S.<br/>
of the sanctuary; and an inscription of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">let </span>Dyn., discovered by<br/>
E. de <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roug√© </span>in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">soutbmost </span>court of the temple (in the S.E. angle,<br/>
to the right of the entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pillars</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">contains </span>an announcement<br/>
by a certain Amenhotep, chief priest under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rams.es </span>IN., that the<br/>
sanctuary of the temple of Ammon was built in the time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Usertesen </span>I. and then restored by himself. Two steles in the quarries of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ma'sara </span>near Cairo (Vol. <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">405 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>record that King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aahmes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
conqueror of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llyksos</span>, caused stones to be quarried for the<br/>
temple of Ammon, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'let </span>and 22nd year of his reign. At all<br/>
events the ancient sanctuary stood near the site of the one now before <span style="color: #0000FF;">us</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>if not actually on the same spot. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>entirely rebuilt<br/>
it, providing it with two doors, a peculiarity commented upon<br/>
above. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>entrance must have existed before his time, for<br/>
it was turned towards the portions of the temple built by his<br/>
ancestors. When <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes</span>, however, added the large new structure farther to the E. (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">138</span>), he connected it with the more <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span>holy place, <span style="color: #0000FF;">dividing </span>the latter in two and adding a W. doorway<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>so that it became the goal <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">processions </span>from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">H</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
