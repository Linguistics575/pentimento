building which <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>been completed under <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasn</span>, from falling<br/>
into decay. Both the style, and the inscriptions tell us <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">DÃ©r </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bahri </span>is to be considered completely a work of the beginning of the<br/>
New Empire. The size and simplicity of its parts, and especially<br/>
the polygonal columns are a sign to those who are familiar with<br/>
the development of Egyptian architecture, that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilyksos </span>period<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>be <span style="color: #0000FF;">considered </span>to have been a time of stagnation in Egyptian<br/>
art, and that exactly the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">forms </span>and arrangements of columns<br/>
were common to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architects </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">l12th </span>and to those of the<br/>
18th Dynasties. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1n </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span>, and not least at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Der </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-bahri</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ohserver </span>is tempted to regard the New Empire as an immediate continuation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Old</span>, although between them lies a period of tive<br/>
hundred years.<br/>
<br/>
The plan of this terrace-temple is remarkable, and cannot be<br/>
compared with any other in Egypt. The arrangement in four<br/>
terraces rising from the level ground up the steep side of the Libyan mountains is quite unique. The stages were cut out of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>slope of the mountain, and support was given to the outer and<br/>
inner walls by means of blocks of the finest sandstone. At the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.<br/>
</span>end of the terraces we can best see the care taken to support the<br/>
earth-works. The outer wall consists here of <span style="color: #0000FF;">finely </span>polished blocks<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">limestone </span>with simple but <span style="color: #0000FF;">effective </span>ornamentation. Broad <span style="color: #0000FF;">pilasters</span>, but only 3 in<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">deep</span>, placed some distance apart, project<br/>
from the wall with which they are connected. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Above </span>each is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">enthroned </span>a gigantic hawk with the crown of Upper and Lower<br/>
Egypt, standing upon an <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uraeus-serpent</span>, and above it is the symbol<br/>
of life supported by an <span style="color: #ff0000;">Urams-serpent</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A long Avenue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sphinxes</span>, probably beginning with a pylon,<br/>
near the entrance to the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Petamenap </span>(p. 222) led up to the<br/>
series of terraces, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">successive </span>stages being reached by <span style="color: #0000FF;">steps<br/>
</span>placed in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
The First Terrace (beginning from below) is almost entirely<br/>
destroyed, but we can make out the pathway which led from the<br/>
bottom to the top, and divided the whole into two equal parts. Below the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Second </span>Terrace <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mariette</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">Terrasse </span>de l'Est) are the ruins<br/>
of a Hall, supported by columns <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">16 </span>sides, which in this form<br/>
were used only under the 17th and 19th Dynasties. The pressure<br/>
of the earth is <span style="color: #0000FF;">sustained </span>by a lofty inner wall on which are some<br/>
well preserved inscriptions, and representations of ships, <span style="color: #ff0000;">soldiers<br/>
