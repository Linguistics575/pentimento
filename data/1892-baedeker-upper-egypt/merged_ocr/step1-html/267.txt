<span style="color: #0000FF;">No </span>2 () (see above) to the tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramenkheperseneb </span>(No. 34),<br/>
which, having been opened only for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few years, is remarkably well<br/>
preserved and is well worth a visit. For stout people, however, the<br/>
entrance is almost too narrow<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The deceased was chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">architect </span>to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>The right hand inner wall ot the large hall tells us of the<br/>
important works which were entrusted to him, such as the carving<br/>
of a statue of the king from a single stone, the erection of a hall of<br/>
pillars, and of numerous obelisks. Here again we see tribute being<br/>
brought by princes, of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Keftu </span>(the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phoenicians</span>), of Kheta, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tunep</span>,<br/>
Kat, Katesh, etc. The arms and helmets of the foreigners, their<br/>
carriages and handsome vases are <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable </span>Near this, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">little<br/>
</span>to the right, is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-preserved </span>tomb (No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">51</span>) of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">emha</span>, the scribe of the harvest, in which should <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>noticed the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">harper </span>and the long list of relations of the deceased, whose father<br/>
and mother were named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Entef</span>. In a passage there are<br/>
represented barges with mummies of himself and his wife <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bekt</span>.<br/>
In the last chamber there is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Side </span>of the 28th year of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>III.<br/>
The shaft in the tomb contains a large room covered with writings<br/>
Still farther to the right is the tomb (No. 60) of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">prince </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">erpa-hi</span>)<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Entefaker</span>, and on the N.E. slope that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amkhent</span>, the son of Auta,<br/>
which was completely excavated in 1883. A descent should now<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>made to the gallery, in front of which is seen Wilkinson's House,<br/>
and to the tomb (No. 88) of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Imaiseb</span>, who was scribe of the altars<br/>
of sacrifice under Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IS</span>. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Neferkara</span>). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">festal </span>barges with<br/>
the name of the king should <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>noticed, as well as the many golden<br/>
utensils, and the money-bags, and also a series of kings, among<br/>
whom appears King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Raskenen</span>, who fought against the Hyksos, and<br/>
whose remarkable mummy is in the museum at Gizeh.<br/>
<br/>
We now descend to the plain, where there are a few more tombs<br/>
to be seen in the direction of <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Asasif</span>, including that of Neferhotep, who lived under King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hows</span>, the last of the 18th Dynasty.<br/>
In this should be especially noticed the funeral processions by boat<br/>
which have been copied by Wilkinson (Manners and Customs). The<br/>
funeral services are also recorded.<br/>
<br/>
We have to crawl through the entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">choked </span>up. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ceiling </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">decorated</span>, and has a regularly recurring series of hieroglyphics,<br/>
signifying'First' and'Prophet'<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the deceased in fact held the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>of<br/>
Prophet of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">family </span>scene in the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">room </span>explains itself;<br/>
the 39 rows of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>above <span style="color: #0000FF;">record </span>the names of the relations of<br/>
the deceased, who <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the left are paying homage to King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home </span>with<br/>
whom they were closely connected<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">In </span>the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">room </span>we see <span style="color: #0000FF;">Neferhotep</span>, sitting by the side of his sister who is adorned with flowers. Behind them is an Inscription which indicates that distinguished <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptian<br/>
</span>families kept private bands of music: and it may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">special<br/>
</span>duty of the harper whose song has been handed down to posterity <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span>this inscription, was to <span style="color: #0000FF;">gladden </span>the hearts of the family when they were<br/>
assembled in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancestors </span>tomb for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">solemnities </span>in his honour.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">song </span>is not in any way of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mournful </span>character, and it is clear that<br/>
in the time of the Pharaohs, it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a pleasure to be reminded in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>shortness of <span style="color: #0000FF;">life</span>, and the duty to <span style="color: #ff0000;">enjoy </span>it, so <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>as it<br/>
lasted. The song is headed<span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">words </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">harper</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>who tarries in<br/>
<br/>
