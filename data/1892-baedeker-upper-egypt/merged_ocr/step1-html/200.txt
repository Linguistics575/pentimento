<br/>
well as <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">w.</span>, and even for those advancing through the<br/>
series of pylons <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-It </span>is improbable that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cambyses </span>caused<br/>
the destruction of <span style="color: #0000FF;">this'heart</span>' of the worship of Ammon, if we may<br/>
use that expression, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Neetanebus</span>, who was a mighty builder<br/>
would certainly have restored it, had it been injured. On the other<br/>
hand, nothing is more likely than that one of the later Persian<br/>
kings selected this temple for destruction after some abortive <span style="color: #0000FF;">insurrection </span>on the part of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptians</span>, in order to punish the <span style="color: #ff0000;">1'8hellions </span>province in its most sensitive part. Ptolemy Soter, who<br/>
held the reins for Philip <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aridmus</span>, could have <span style="color: #0000FF;">found </span>no easier way<br/>
to win the hearts of his new subjects than to restore the holy places<br/>
destroyed by the Persians; while to do so was to imitate Alexander the Great. In this particular <span style="color: #0000FF;">case </span>the work was not <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult</span>,<br/>
for though new sculptures had to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>provided for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">adytum</span>, its<br/>
walls were for the most part still standing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dedicationinscription </span>in the interior of the sanctuary, Philip records merely<br/>
that he had restored with granite the sanctuary which was falling<br/>
to ruin,'which was built in the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tntmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IIL</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>king of<br/>
Upper and Lower Egypt'; and a fragment of the older structure,<br/>
bearing on its upper side a representation of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>offering gifts<br/>
to Ammon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Generator</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">was </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">11sed </span>as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">ceiling-slab </span>in the restoration.<br/>
<br/>
The inscriptions <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>carvings on the Inner <span style="color: #0000FF;">Walls</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>chamber are neither imposing nor specially interesting. They <span style="color: #0000FF;">still<br/>
</span>exhibit traces of colour, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>of the blue <span style="color: #0000FF;">pigment</span>, which was<br/>
lavishly used to make the <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>stand out more <span style="color: #0000FF;">distinctly </span>from<br/>
the reddish stone. Ammon in both his main characters (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman<br/>
</span>Generator and Ammon king of the gods) receives the homage of<br/>
Philip, or rather of the representative of the royal house of Macedon,<br/>
for it is certain that Philip never entered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">valley </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Nile<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Math<br/>
</span>of course also appears with Ammon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>once is depicted as<br/>
embracing him, an absolutely unique representation. The traveller<br/>
will see with surprise in this sacred spot <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>representation of the<br/>
king, under the auspices <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ehnum</span>, catching birds with a net, and<br/>
promising to bestow his booty upon Ammon.<br/>
<br/>
The Exterior <span style="color: #0000FF;">Walls </span>of the holy <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofholies </span>are covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous </span>low reliefs and inscriptions, not easily seen on <span style="color: #0000FF;">account </span>of the<br/>
smoothness and polish of the granite. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>right side <span style="color: #ff0000;">LS</span>.) the<br/>
Pharaoh is in one <span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>sprinkled with the water of life by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Her </span>Hut<br/>
(Vol. L, p. 133) and Thoth, and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">receives </span>from them the<br/>
royal <span style="color: #ff0000;">crown</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Elsewhere </span>we see the boat of Ammon being brought<br/>
in solemn <span style="color: #0000FF;">procession </span>to the sanctuary, and the king offering four<br/>
calves of <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>colours (perhaps symbolizing the nations of the<br/>
four quarters of the globe, over which he watched as shepherd <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the people). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>records <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-lla</span>, the bull (<span style="color: #0000FF;">husband</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>mother, <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>highly pleased with the beautiful monument<br/>
which Philip has <span style="color: #0000FF;">erected </span>to him, and that <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>promises all kinds of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">gifts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span>in return. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">foundation-cereniony </span>is also <span style="color: #0000FF;">men<br/>
