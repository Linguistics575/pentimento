<br/>
In the second row, to the right, the king in his chariot dashes<br/>
against the <span style="color: #ff0000;">discornfited </span>foe, and aims a blow at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hostile </span>leader,<br/>
distinguished by a feather. Next the king on foot deals the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finishing<br/>
</span>blow with his lance to an <span style="color: #0000FF;">officer</span>, who has been brought to his knees.<br/>
To the left the victorious monarch fares <span style="color: #0000FF;">homeward</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">preceded </span>by<br/>
two rows of prisoners, named'hi anta en tahi'. The small figure<br/>
behind the chariot is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crown-prince </span>Ramses. Then follows the<br/>
presentation of the prisoners, who are called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Retennu </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tahennu<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Le</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">crystal-coloured</span>, white), to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon</span>, Muth, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu</span>, who<br/>
also receive the captured gold and <span style="color: #0000FF;">vessels</span>. Similar <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>occupy the lowest row. To the right is the pursuit of the<br/>
Kheta in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">chariots </span>The inscription <span style="color: #0000FF;">above </span>compares the king<br/>
to Sutekh and Baal, to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">wolf </span>and a <span style="color: #ff0000;">lion</span>, that roams through the<br/>
by-paths, to a bull that destroys the enemy in their blood. To the<br/>
left is the homeward journey. The king leads captives on foot, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">behind </span>him <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>a chariot containing fettered prisoners, and preceded<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">byitwo </span>rows of the same. He brings his captives to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>triad,<br/>
who are here accompanied by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">goddess'Mat</span>. There also are <span style="color: #ff0000;">Retennu</span>, brought by the king from the land of Kheta'to <span style="color: #0000FF;">till </span>the lordly<br/>
palace of Ammon'.<br/>
<br/>
e. The older E. part of the Temple of Ammon<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>1. From the Hypostyle Hall to the Sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
We now return to the central row of lofty columns with the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx-capitals</span>, and follow it eastwards to Pylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill.</span>, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>pass<br/>
through <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">our </span>way towards the sanctuary, like the more highly privileged worshippers admitted to the temple in early times. This<br/>
part of the temple has been terribly destroyed, but enough has been<br/>
left standing to afford an idea of the general arrangement. The<br/>
picturesque effect of the ruinous scene is enhanced by the variety<br/>
of artistic forms employed, and by the tall and slender shape of the<br/>
largest <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisk </span>in Egypt, rising from the midst of the ruins, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">testifying </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">past </span>proud splendour <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">truly </span>royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>, which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ruthlessly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">trodden </span>under foot by the monotonous cycle of<br/>
years and shattered by war and earthquakes. - The nearer we<br/>
approach to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary </span>the older are the parts of the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">we<br/>
</span>traverse. The inscriptions afford materials for ascertaining the date<br/>
of each <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>portion; <span style="color: #ff0000;">while </span>the practised eye will not <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>it<br/>
difficult to support the conclusions thus arrived at by comparison<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">successive </span>styles of art. We here <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>the polygonal <span style="color: #ff0000;">pillarcolumn </span>and the finely <span style="color: #0000FF;">carved </span>bud <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span>, bearing clear and <span style="color: #0000FF;">unmistakeable </span>evidence as to the idea, to which this order owed its<br/>
origin<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The third pylon seems to have marked the limit of the<br/>
temple under the early empire, before the gigantic buildings of<br/>
the 19th Dyn. were added. The W. side <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>this <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylon</span>. within the<br/>
great <span style="color: #0000FF;">hypostyle-hall</span>, still shows the <span style="color: #0000FF;">incisions </span>made in the wall<br/>
