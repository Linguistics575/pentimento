<span>16 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">f. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BENIHASAN</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the names of women <span style="color: #0000FF;">till </span>a very important <span style="color: #0000FF;">role</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">II</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Ra-nub-kau <span style="color: #0000FF;">CD </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">UUU </span>created Khnumhotep governor of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Homes</span>, and as the heir of his maternal grandfather made<br/>
him priest of Horus and Pasht in the town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menat </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khufu </span>(Minyeh).<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">portico </span>or vestibule of this tomb deserves particular <span style="color: #0000FF;">attention</span>, as it not only possesses <span style="color: #0000FF;">proto-Dorio </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span>resembling those<br/>
of Tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>, but also shows some architectural forms, which seem<br/>
intended to reproduce the beams and rafters of buildings above<br/>
ground<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The cornice projects strongly <span style="color: #0000FF;">above </span>the architrave and<br/>
is supported by <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>laths hewn, like all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rest </span>of the structure,<br/>
out of the living <span style="color: #ff0000;">rock</span>. The resemblance of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">lath</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>to the mutules of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>order is not especially striking in itself, but taken<br/>
in conjunction with other points of similarity is, perhaps, worthy of<br/>
mention. - The interior of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnumhotep</span>'s tomb is richly adorned<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">paintings</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Most of the representations <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>painted on a thin<br/>
layer of stucco, with which the limestone walls were <span style="color: #0000FF;">coated</span>. At the<br/>
foot, however, is a long inscription <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>in the rock, in lines <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>greenish colour, 21/2 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>high. [ In 1890 the royal names were <span style="color: #0000FF;">out<br/>
</span>out of the rock <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>some vandal hand and offered for sale.) From this<br/>
inscription we receive information about the family of Khnumhotep,<br/>
who owed the greater part of his dignities to his maternal grandfather, about his relations with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n.</span>, who, at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">intercession </span>of his mother, made him a royal governor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>about the<br/>
benefits he had conferred on his government and its people and the<br/>
honour he had done to the gods of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">manes </span>of his<br/>
forefathers.<br/>
<br/>
The paintings have unfortunately suffered so <span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span>in the last<br/>
30 or 40 years, that the subjects of some of them are now almost<br/>
indistinguishable. Most of them, however, were copied by Lepsius,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rosellini</span>, Wilkinson, and others, while they were still in fair preservation; and they have furnished most important contributions to<br/>
our <span style="color: #0000FF;">knowledge </span>of the private life of the ancient Egyptians. In the<br/>
uppermost row of paintings, above the door, was represented the<br/>
festival of the opening of the tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnumhotep</span>.'The heaven<br/>
opens', says the inscription,'as the god (<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. the deceased <span style="color: #0000FF;">transformed </span>into Osiris) steps forth'. To the right, lower down, we see<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnade</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">khmunhotep</span>'s dwelling, with servants measuring<br/>
and registering his treasures and (farther on) bringing his corn <span style="color: #0000FF;">into<br/>
</span>the barns. Two of the lower rows show the operations of ploughing,<br/>
harvesting, and threshing. Still lower down is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile-hoat</span>, bearing the mummy of the deceased<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>as the inscription informs us, to<br/>
Abydos <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>the grave of Osiris), while the high-priest imparts his<br/>
blessing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Below </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>a representation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vintage </span>and of the gathering of fruit and vegetables. The cattle in thewater and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fishing<br/>
</span>scene <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cat </span>the foot) vividly recall the similar scenes in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastaba<br/>
</span>of Ti. To the left of the door, high up, are seen the processes of<br/>
preparing clay for pottery and sawing wood; in the second row<br/>
