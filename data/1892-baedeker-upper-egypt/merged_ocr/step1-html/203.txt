<br/>
scanty <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>of the earliest recognizable buildings of the temple of<br/>
the 12th Dynasty. Farther on, in the axis of the sanctuary, are two<br/>
square granite bases, one behind the other, being the <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>of<br/>
sixteen-sided columns, with the name of Usertesen I. A little<br/>
farther to the E. is the doorway of the<br/>
Great Colonnade of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111.091</span>. H). The reports <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>military success <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofthis </span>prince, which we <span style="color: #ff0000;">havejust </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">perused</span>, telling us <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>enormous wealth at <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>disposal, and still more the reverence which<br/>
we see him paying to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>at every turn, prepare us to <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>in<br/>
this temple some important building reared by him to his divine<br/>
patron. The space to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>of the ancient sanctuary had already<br/>
been occupied by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>ancestors, so that, as his new<br/>
building was also to maintain connection with the holy place, he<br/>
was forced to build on the site to the E. We have already seen<br/>
how, contrary to the usual custom, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">prodded </span>the sacred <span style="color: #ff0000;">granitechamber </span>with a second doorway <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>opening to the E.). The form and<br/>
appearance of the courts and chambers that lay between the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sartctuary </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>cannot now be determined, for they have<br/>
been utterly destroyed. The ancient holy place built by the kings<br/>
of the 12th Dyn. was probably <span style="color: #0000FF;">surrounded </span>by two concentric walls,<br/>
separated by an archway or passage. The colonnaded hall, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>enter by the central door, is 144 ft. wide and 52 ft. deep. The<br/>
roof was supported <span style="color: #0000FF;">by'30 </span>columns in two rows; while 32 square pillars (14 at the sides, <span style="color: #0000FF;">4 </span>at the ends) formed four galleries with the<br/>
walls of the hall. The pillars, though not so tall as the columns, were<br/>
of the same height as the walls, and with the latter supported the<br/>
roofing slabs. As the middle of the hall was also roofed<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>a small<br/>
wall, with sloping exterior and decorated with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">astragal </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">concave </span>cornice, rose from the roof above the pillars and walls to the<br/>
height of the columns in the centre. There was thus formed a kind<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">clerestory</span>, which was provided with rectangular windows, broader<br/>
than they were high, in order to admit light to the hall. The central<br/>
columns belong to a peculiar order, the various <span style="color: #0000FF;">par </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span>which on<br/>
the shaft and capital were indicated only <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>painting. They have<br/>
received the name of'inverted <span style="color: #ff0000;">calyx-cupitals</span>', because the bells or<br/>
calyces were placed inverted <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the smooth shafts, which were<br/>
painted a dark red and adorned with vertical inscriptions, recalling<br/>
the similar decoration of the central panels of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fluted </span>polygonal<br/>
columns. As the edge of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">f1ower-calys </span>rested upon the end of the<br/>
shaft, the latter expanded <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the top, with some abruptness; and<br/>
the annuli had in consequence to be placed somewhat <span style="color: #0000FF;">low </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">down<br/>
</span>on the cylindrical shaft (below the beginning of the expansion),<br/>
to save them from the appearance of slipping down. The capitals<br/>
are adorned with calyx- <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">marsh-plants</span>, the tips of which, of course,<br/>
point downwards. In place of the fruit-germ<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>these inverted <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyces </span>support somewhat lofty abaci, on which <span style="color: #0000FF;">rests </span>an <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave<br/>
</span>adorned with fine hieroglyphics. The fourth abacus on the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">side<br/>
