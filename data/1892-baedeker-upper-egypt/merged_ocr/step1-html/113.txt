<span style="color: #ff0000;">neeropolis </span>and to hew out his statue. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saerifices </span>and festivals are<br/>
richly provided for. The rest of the inscription assumes more and<br/>
more the character of a hymn, like those mentioned at <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">258 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
The above will <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffice </span>to show the filial piety, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>Ramses,<br/>
at least in the earlier part of his reign, strove to complete and <span style="color: #ff0000;">restore </span>the work of his father. <span style="color: #0000FF;">But </span>the remains of the building <span style="color: #ff0000;">construetetl </span>by him near the Temple of Seti at Abydos <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>67) prove<br/>

INTERIOR <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">TEMPLE</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIypostyle </span>Halls and the Sevenfold Sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
From the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pronaos</span>, containing the above inscription, two doors<br/>
only now lead into the interior of the temple: the main entrance<br/>
in the middle and a narrow door to the extreme right. The First<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hypostyle </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Room </span>(Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span>), a long but narrow apartment, makes<br/>
a solemn and imposing impression. The roof, part of which has<br/>
fallen in, is supported <span style="color: #0000FF;">by'24 </span>columns, arranged in two rows and in<br/>
groups of four. The slender shafts are surmounted by capitals in<br/>
the form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus </span>buds. Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span>did not complete the plastic <span style="color: #0000FF;">decoration </span>of the room. Ramses began new sculptures <span style="color: #ff0000;">instead </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">efthose<br/>
</span>begun by his father, apparently forgetting the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">filial </span>piety he<br/>
arrogates to himself in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">above </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">quoted </span>inscription (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">58</span>).<br/>
Whether it was that the zeal of the son abated along with his grief<br/>
for his father, or that the priestly sculptors thought it better to <span style="color: #ff0000;">relebrate </span>a living prince rather than a dead one, the fact remains that<br/>
it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span>alone who is here depicted and the temple itself is<br/>
simply called the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos</span>, not, as in the earlier <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>, that of Ra-ma-men (<span style="color: #0000FF;">tie</span>. Seti)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The sculptures preserved here<br/>
are of mediocre workmanship, and the inscriptions and representations, almost wholly dealing with Ramses and his reception of<br/>
gifts from the different gods, are generally uninteresting even for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tho </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">scholar</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wall</span>, near the second chamber, is a series<br/>
of gods, consisting <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ru</span>, Shu (the giver of all delight) and his<br/>
sister <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tefnut </span>(giver of health), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sab </span>(giver of life and strength),<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Osiris</span>, Horus (<span style="color: #ff0000;">giver </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">everytietory</span>), Isis (giver <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">life </span>and strength),<br/>
the great god <span style="color: #ff0000;">Apheru </span>(Anubis), and Nut, who imparts the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fullness </span>of<br/>
salvation. - The six lists of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">names </span>of Egypt, on the lower part<br/>
of the walls, are also interesting. As elsewhere, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">districts </span>are<br/>
represented as bearded male <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>with the emblem of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">home<br/>
</span>(a piece of surveyed ground, <span style="color: #0000FF;">EEBE</span>) and a standard bearing the<br/>
symbol of the special district. As the lists here have no annotations, they are of less value than those at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Denderah </span>and elsewhere.<br/>
They indicate that it was <span style="color: #ff0000;">enstomary </span>for all the districts of the land<br/>
to pay their <span style="color: #0000FF;">rows </span>and bring gifts to the gods ofa <span style="color: #ff0000;">sqywiat </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary<br/>
