<br/>
steamer station), now an <span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant </span>village, occupying the site of<br/>
the ancient Apollinopolis <span style="color: #ff0000;">Parva</span>. According to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahulfeda </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">d. </span>1331)<br/>
this town was second in size only to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fostit </span>(Cairo), and was the<br/>
chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">retina </span>of the Arabian trade. To-day heaps of ruins are the<br/>
only remains. A few stones with fragmentary inscriptions have<br/>
been built into the houses of the town; and the mosque contains<br/>
a basin formed of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>single stone, with the name of Ptolemy <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philadelphns </span>upon it. A pylon, which stood here 30 years ago but has<br/>
now disappeared, bore a Greek inscription, announcing <span style="color: #0000FF;">that'Queers<br/>
</span>Cleopatra and King Ptolemy, the great gods and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philometors</span>, and<br/>
their children dedicated the temple to the god <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arneris </span>and to the<br/>
deities worshipped along with him'. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arueris </span>is the earlier Horus,<br/>
usually <span style="color: #0000FF;">identified </span>by the Greeks with Apollo, whence the name of<br/>
the town <span style="color: #0000FF;">Apollinopolis</span>. The modern name <span style="color: #0000FF;">Iftos </span>appears to be<br/>
<br/>
derived from the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Jies..kes </span>Near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senhm </span>(E. bank),<br/>

</span>3 <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>to the S. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">I.05s</span>, Prisse <span style="color: #0000FF;">Avennes </span>discovered the ruins of a<br/>
small temple of Isis, in which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home </span>of Apollinopolis, <span style="color: #ff0000;">KhemMin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Koptos</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">triad </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofThehesIAmmon-Ra</span>, Muth, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu</span>),<br/>
and other gods, were also worshipped. To the E. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senhur </span>passes<br/>
the canal of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senhur </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>98), which begins <span style="color: #0000FF;">above </span>Thebes and<br/>
extends N. to <span style="color: #ff0000;">lieneh</span>. In the 12th cent. <span style="color: #0000FF;">BE</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">If11s </span>was notorious for<br/>
the number of its scorpions. Numerous Christians dwell here and<br/>
also in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nalcddeh</span>, on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>bank of the Nile, about 3 M. to the S.W.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nalp1deh </span>(mail-station), with numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">dove-cotes</span>, a Coptic and a<br/>
Roman Catholic church, has old and narrow streets, but presents<br/>
a picturesque appearance from the river. The traveller who lands<br/>
here near <span style="color: #0000FF;">sunset </span>on a Sunday <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>festival (recommended) will be<br/>
pleasantly surprised to hear the sound of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ch11relv-bells</span>. The churches<br/>
themselves are uninteresting. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Great </span>success has attended the<br/>
labours of Christian missionaries here and still more in <span style="color: #0000FF;">lifts</span>; and<br/>
a considerable proportion of the Coptic community (including the<br/>
worthy and learned bishop of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kits</span>) have embraced Protestantism.<br/>
The missionaries of the United Presbyterian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Church </span>of North<br/>
America have also had <span style="color: #0000FF;">considerable </span>success at Luxor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>, and<br/>
other towns in Upper Egypt, their converts, however, being exclusively from among the Copts, never the Mohammedans.<br/>
Demetrius 11., <span style="color: #0000FF;">patriarch </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts </span>(d. 1870), <span style="color: #0000FF;">excommunicated<br/>
</span>both the converts and the missionaries. In 1866 he instigated a<br/>
persecution of the proselytes, whom he sought to terrify by fines,<br/>
stripes, and imprisonment; and he destroyed the publications <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the missionaries (who have a printing-press of their own) wherever<br/>
he could <span style="color: #0000FF;">lay </span>hands upon them. The British and American consuls<br/>
thereupon interfered energetically on behalf of their <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellowbelievers</span>, and now the Coptic Protestants enjoy <span style="color: #0000FF;">complete </span>immunity<br/>
from every form of religious persecution.<br/>
