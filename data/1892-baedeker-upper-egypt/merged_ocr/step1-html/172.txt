<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">spicuons </span>as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">city </span>of temples and priests, but its inhabitants <span style="color: #0000FF;">de-</span>,<br/>
clined in wealth. It may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>easily conjectured that these, <span style="color: #0000FF;">formerly<br/>
</span>the chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">among </span>the citizens of Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>but ill the fate which<br/>
now placed them far behind the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrians</span>. Strangers sat on the<br/>
throne of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ila</span>, and cared not to take the trouble to visit in <span style="color: #0000FF;">person<br/>
</span>the remote <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dinspolis</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coronation-town </span>of the Pharaohs, who<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>been <span style="color: #0000FF;">accustomed </span>to make a <span style="color: #0000FF;">triumphai </span>entry after each victory<br/>
and to offer thanks to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>The earlier noble Lagidae were <span style="color: #ff0000;">sneeeedetl </span>by worthless rulers, whose extravagant tastes forced them<br/>
to drain the resources of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theba'id </span>and other provinces. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Under </span>the gluttonous <span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ir</span>. and his consort Cleopatra <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cocce<br/>
</span>the Alexandrians rose in revolt and expelled Alexander L, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>king's son. The citizens of the capital of Upper Egypt dared also<br/>
to rise in the attempt to win <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>their lost independence; and<br/>
they <span style="color: #0000FF;">refused </span>to lay down their arms even when Ptolemy Soter II.<br/>
(Lathyrus) was recalled from banishment by the Alexandrians and<br/>
was universally recognized in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lower </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>. The army <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofLathyrns<br/>
</span>besieged the town, whose inhabitants <span style="color: #0000FF;">bravely </span>defended themselves<br/>
in the huge temples, each of which served as a fortress. Finally,<br/>
however, Thebes was stormed; its treasures were plundered and<br/>
its venerable monuments terribly mutilated. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thenceforward </span>Thebes<br/>
is only mentioned as a goal <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inquisitive </span>travellers, who under the<br/>
Roman emperors were attracted to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">File </span>by two monuments in<br/>
particular - the pyramids and the musical <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Memnon on<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>bank at Thebes. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus </span>(60 <span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>) and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Emma </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C24B.00<br/>
</span>describe Thebes <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>it was after the destruction. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">latter </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">found<br/>
</span>only a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>on each side of the Nile, just as the traveller of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>does. An earthquake, no common <span style="color: #0000FF;">occurrence </span>in Egypt,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">done </span>more than the hand of the fierce warrior to destroy the<br/>
monuments of thousands of years. In 27 <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">24 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.0. </span>a convulsion<br/>
of this nature wrought such havoc that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ensehins </span>declared, though<br/>
not without exaggeration, that the Egyptian Thebes <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>been<br/>
levelled with the ground. In the absence of some such natural<br/>
force, we should be tempted to <span style="color: #ff0000;">declare </span>that the annihilation of<br/>
many parts of the monuments of Thebes must have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>task<br/>
only less <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>than their construction. At many points, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>in the temple at Karnak, the injury is plainly to be ascribed<br/>
to human hands. The representations, dating from the period of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>within the second main pylon, to the left as we <span style="color: #0000FF;">approach </span>the large hypostyle'hall, have <span style="color: #0000FF;">becn'remmed </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">axes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hammers</span>. Some smaller injuries, especially to the names of the<br/>
kings, were due to <span style="color: #ff0000;">political </span>reasons, as when <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill.</span>, after he<br/>
obtained the sole power, destroyed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cartonches </span>of his too ambitious sister and guardian; others are to be ascribed to the evil habit<br/>
of certain Pharaohs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">appropriating </span>the monuments of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">predecessors </span>by substituting their own names for those of the real<br/>
builders; and yet others had religious causes, as when the name <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
