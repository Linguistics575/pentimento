battle, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">traditionally </span>laid in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">meme </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Apollinopolis</span>. An inscription relating to the Horus myth, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the inside of the W.<br/>
girdle-wall, states that'they reached <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stth-Typhon </span>and his companions in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Apollinopolis</span>'.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus </span>emerged victorious from this battle, and the evil SethTyphon was pierced by him (tebu)<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'piercer </span>thereupon became his<br/>
name, and'place of the piercing' the name of his district and town.<br/>
This name is clearly preserved in the modern name Edfu. Another name, that <span style="color: #0000FF;">occurs </span>most frequently next to this one and has<br/>
also reference to the chief deity of the temple at Edfu, is Hut or<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Behut</span>. Thus the winged <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-disc</span>, which was placed over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance </span>to every Egyptian temple, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>named<br/>

'Hut, the great god, the lord of heaven, who, clad in bright <span style="color: #0000FF;">plumage</span>, comes forth from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-mountain</span>'.<br/>
<br/>
Another name for the winged <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-disc </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Apt</span>, which means<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'flying</span>' and'wings'.<br/>
<br/>
At the head of the gods worshipped at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu </span>stood, as is apparent from what has already been said,'Horus, who spreads his<br/>
wings, the great god, the lord of heaven, who, clad in bright <span style="color: #0000FF;">plumage</span>, comes forth out of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-mountain</span>'. Next to him rank the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Denderah, who undertook a special festal journey to Edfu,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">AM</span>, son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">lIathor</span>, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shu</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tefnut</span>.<br/>
<br/>
History of the Temple. The representations and inscriptions<br/>
that cover the walls of the great temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Horus at Edfu place it<br/>
beyond doubt that the building in its present form dates from the<br/>
period of the Ptolemies. Yet like the sanctuary of Hathor at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Den-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">derah</span>, it is not an architectonic creation of that period, but merely<br/>
a splendid restoration of an earlier temple carried out under the<br/>
Lagidae. The Temple proper, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. the sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">apartments </span>exclusive of the later hypostyle with its 18 columns (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Al</span>. E) and of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fore-court </span>with its 32 columns (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F</span>), as well as of the still later<br/>
pylons and <span style="color: #0000FF;">girdle-wall</span>, was begun by Ptolemy III. Euergetes <span style="color: #0000FF;">l. </span>in<br/>
the 10th year <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>reign. It was finished 95 years later, in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">98th </span>year of the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IA</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>. Euergetes 11., and the 18th<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mesori </span>in that year was <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>by the priests for its consecration,<br/>
as an important festival <span style="color: #0000FF;">took </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>upon that day. The image of<br/>
Horus was carried in solemn <span style="color: #0000FF;">procession </span>into the temple, and the<br/>
author of the builders' inscriptions at Edfu, in describing this solemn entry, introduces the god as astonished by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificence<br/>
</span>that greeted him, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">moved </span>by joy, as addressing <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>surroundings. In his speech the god expressly states <span style="color: #0000FF;">that'the </span>halls were<br/>
renewed in their building', and <span style="color: #0000FF;">that'commands </span>went forth from<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">majesties </span>to rebuild his house, an <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice </span>of ancient times, and<br/>
