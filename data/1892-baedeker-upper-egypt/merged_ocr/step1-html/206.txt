campaigns, which we have already met with on the pylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Luxor<br/>
</span>(p. 112) and which will be mentioned again when we visit the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Itamesseum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">161</span>), occurs also here in long but not easily accessible lines <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>hieroglyphics. About 40 ft. to the right (E.) of the<br/>
door through which we <span style="color: #0000FF;">pitted </span>the hypostyle, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>short wall projects<br/>
at right angles from the wall of the great temple, bearing a most<br/>
interesting and <span style="color: #0000FF;">important </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">containing </span>the Treaty <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Peace<br/>
</span>destined to put an end to the wars between the Egyptians and the<br/>
Asiatics.<br/>
<br/>
This is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span>international treaty extant in the world, and it is<br/>
as remarkable for its contents as for its <span style="color: #0000FF;">form</span>, which is so conceived in the<br/>
essential points that modern documents of a similar aim <span style="color: #0000FF;">differ </span>from it<br/>
only in the greater conciseness of their expressions<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The bottom of the<br/>
inscription is at present concealed by rubbish. The treaty is dated the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">2tst </span>Tybi in the 21st year of King Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">II</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Miamun</span>, in the town of<br/>
Tanis, <span style="color: #ff0000;">i.e</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramsestown</span>. The Kheta prince caused the treaty to he<br/>
engraved on <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>silver <span style="color: #0000FF;">table </span>and sent an ambassador to seek peace. The<br/>
document proper, divided into paragraphs and <span style="color: #0000FF;">translated </span>by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eminent<br/>
</span>French Egyptologist F. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chabas</span>, begins as <span style="color: #0000FF;">follow'Formerly </span>and for a<br/>
long period the mighty king of Egypt and the prince of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheta </span>lived<br/>
in good understanding (God grant that hostility never again <span style="color: #0000FF;">exist </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">between<br/>
</span>them). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nevertheless </span>he declared <span style="color: #0000FF;">war </span>against the great king (Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>.) of<br/>
Egypt, in the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mautnur</span>, my brother, prince of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kheta</span>. But<br/>
from to-day and from this day <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khetasar</span>, prince of the Kheta, makes a<br/>
treaty in order to arrive at a lasting understanding. <span style="color: #0000FF;">May </span>Ra, may Seth<br/>
lend them endurance, as well for Egypt as for the land of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheta<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Aramzea</span>), so that hostility may never again arise <span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>them. - The<br/>
following points were agreed upon: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khetasar</span>, prince of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheta</span>, unites<br/>
with Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">Niamun</span>, the mighty king of Egypt, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">cause </span>to exist between<br/>
them good <span style="color: #0000FF;">peace </span>and good alliance from this day onwards forever. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He<br/>
</span>shall he allied with me, he shall be at peace with me; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, I shall he<br/>
allied with him, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>I, I shall <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>at peace with him forever'. After a<br/>
brief historical retrospect, the treaty goes on:<span style="color: #0000FF;">'The </span>prince of the Kheta<br/>
will never again invade Egypt to carry <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>anything whatever out of it,<br/>
and Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">Niamun</span>, the mighty king of Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>will never invade the<br/>
land of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khet't</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>to carry <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>anything whatever out of it'. Then, after<br/>
another <span style="color: #0000FF;">historical </span>retrospect:'When enemies turn against the land of<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">Niamun</span>, the mighty king of Egypt, he will send to the prince of<br/>
the Kheta the message<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tome </span>and unite thyself with my might against<br/>
them'. The prince of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheta </span>will be at the disposal of the king of Egypt<br/>
and will smite his enemies. If the prince of the Kheta does not take the<br/>
field in person, he will send his foot-soldiers and <span style="color: #0000FF;">war </span>chariots to smite<br/>
the enemies of the king of Egypt.... and vice <span style="color: #0000FF;">verst </span>(with repetition<br/>
of the above paragraph). - Then follows a remarkable convention by<br/>
which the parties to the treaty <span style="color: #0000FF;">hind </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>to use force in preventing<br/>
skilled workmen from passing <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>one country into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">other</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The gods<br/>
and goddesses, the Baalim of the land of the Kheta (<span style="color: #0000FF;">translated </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Seth</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>),<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Astute</span>, and a'thousand' local deities, mountains, and rivers <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">invoked<br/>
</span>as witnesses by the Asiatics, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the Egyptians invoke <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rat</span>, Seth,<br/>
the warlike gods and goddesses, the mountains and rivers of Egypt, the<br/>
shore of the Mediterranean, the wind, and the clouds. These powers are<br/>
to punish the breaker of the treaty; while to him who keeps it they shall<br/>
grant life, to him and to his <span style="color: #0000FF;">house</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>his estate, and his servants. Next<br/>
follow two <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable </span>articles in which the contracting parties bind<br/>
themselves mutually to <span style="color: #0000FF;">extradite </span>criminals; though, by a condition which<br/>
speaks highly for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eivilization </span>reached by both nations, his crime<br/>
'shall not be permitted to raise itself' against the extradited criminal, <span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span>.<br/>
the criminal process against him shall he suspended, and no harm <span style="color: #0000FF;">shall<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>done to <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>house, or to his wife, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>to his children; he shall<br/>
also not, he punished in the eye, mouth, or foot, and moreover <span style="color: #0000FF;">no<br/>
