portant, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">otherwise </span>the branches were reckoned from east to west.<br/>
More to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">left</span>, but not so well preserved, are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river-gods </span>of the<br/>
southern Nile. Here the dedicatory inscription tells us that Seti I.<br/>
set this up to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-Ra</span>, the lord of the throne of the universe,<br/>
in the region of Ammon of the western Thebes for millions of years<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span>, and that his son Ramses II. was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">restorer </span>of this building.<br/>
'Not all his works', it literally continues,'were <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>in writing<br/>
or in hollowing out. So his son, the lord of both worlds,<br/>

<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Passing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">through </span>the middle door (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl.b</span>) of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>, we enter<br/>
a <span style="color: #ff0000;">kind </span>of Hypostyle with <span style="color: #0000FF;">G </span>papyrus-bud columns (Pl<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>B). This is<br/>
bounded on each side by three chambers, and beyond the last pair<br/>
of these expands to their full depth. It is considerably smaller than<br/>
other similar halls<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>measuring only 50 ft. by 35 ft. A part of the<br/>
roof has fallen in, on the slabs which are preserved are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">vulture </span>forms of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hebent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nekheb'0 </span>and two inscriptions. On the right<br/>
is the ordinary dedication of the building, on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>left a special<br/>
mention of this hall, which like all similar ones is <span style="color: #ff0000;">called'The </span>Hall<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Appearance</span>'. Everywhere we see on the walls Seti I. offering<br/>
incense to the gods of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thebes</span>, and bringing the symbol of his<br/>
name, and flowers etc. On the right and left of the door Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L<br/>
</span>meets us as a boy, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Math </span>on the one side, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hathor </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the<br/>
other giving him the mother's breast. The young prince already<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">wears </span>the helmet and holds the symbol <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">princely </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rank</span>; Hathor<br/>
<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">horns </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofa </span>cow and the disc upon her <span style="color: #0000FF;">head</span>, supports with her<br/>
right hand the nourishing breast, and says:'I am thy mother, who<br/>
fashions everything that is perfect. Feed thyself with my milk'.<br/>
Besides the Theban triad are mentioned <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather </span>as goddess of the<br/>
western horizon, Isis, Tum, Ptah, and Anubis. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The-Frieze </span>of the<br/>
Hall of Appearance displays the name and surname of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">censtantly </span>repeated. Several inscriptions show that Seti left this hall<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished</span>, and that Ramses completed what his father had begun.<br/>
In the adjoining rooms there are several clear references to the<br/>
cultus of the dead which was celebrated here. In hall <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span>, which is<br/>
supported by 4 pillars, we see Seti I. before a Naos with the boat<br/>
of Ammon-Ra.<br/>
<br/>
The series of chambers to the left divides into two parts: a<br/>
Hall (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span>F) with 2 pillars, into which three long <span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms </span>open, while<br/>
behind are three running parallel with the axis of the temple, and<br/>
three in a N. and S. direction, which are reached by a passage from<br/>
the extreme left <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>inner wall of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>. This part of<br/>
the building was dedicated to the memory of father, son, and grandfather, Seti L, Ramses IL, and Ramses L For the inscriptions to<br/>
the last see above.<br/>
