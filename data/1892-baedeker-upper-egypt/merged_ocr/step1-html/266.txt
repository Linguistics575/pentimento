<span>194 Route 18. <span style="color: #0000FF;">THEBES</span>. West Bank<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">anteehamber </span>has fallen in, and the sun lights up its walls,<br/>
which are covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>variety of interesting representations.<br/>
<br/>
On the fragment of wall to the left prince Anna is seen with his<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">wife </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tuau </span>sitting under a light pavilion, supported by a pillar, which<br/>
shows that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Calyx-capital </span>belonged originally to wooden buildings,<br/>
and was only adopted later in stone architecture. The pavilion has a<br/>
natural <span style="color: #0000FF;">connexion </span>with the picture of Anna's garden, as he was a zealous<br/>
planter of <span style="color: #0000FF;">trees </span>A <span style="color: #0000FF;">number </span>of the plants cultivated by him are named,<br/>
and to this we owe our knowledge of the names and characters of several<br/>
of the plants of ancient Egypt. On the long outer wall, on the left, we<br/>
see the noble Anna again, this time standing upright, in full enjoyment<br/>
of his rank, while receiving the <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>kinds of tributes <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the storehouses <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>. There are <span style="color: #0000FF;">scribes </span>to take down the amount of each<br/>
contribution, and even the number <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>strokes which are <span style="color: #ff0000;">inflieted </span>upon a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">debtor</span>. From Ethiopia there is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">variety </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">contributions </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>received,<br/>
including negress <span style="color: #0000FF;">slaves </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">carrying </span>their <span style="color: #0000FF;">children </span>in baskets on their backs,<br/>
ivory, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ebony</span>, apes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">panther </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">kins</span>, etc. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Asiatics </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bring </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lapis-lazuli</span>, etc.<br/>
<br/>
On the same outer wall but to the right of the spectator Anna is<br/>
seen again, but this time in company with his united family. His hound<br/>
is standing below his seat, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>ostriches, wild asses, a kind of wild<br/>
goat, and other goats and cattle of various kinds and colours are being<br/>
brought to him. One man brings rows of pomegranates etc. on strings.<br/>
The interior of the tomb is small, but is not without interest, especially<br/>
from the abundant list <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the right wall <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>alone we<br/>
learn the names of tive kinds of wine and two kinds of beer. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">left </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wall </span>is the country-house and garden of the deceased; two women<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>standing <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the door, probably his wife and his mother. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">background </span>Anna is sitting with his wife before a richly furnished table of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings</span>. Opposite to him is seen his <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oftin </span>being drawn along, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>weeping <span style="color: #ff0000;">women </span>throwing dust on their heads, just as may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>seen in<br/>
Egypt at the present day. The innermost room of No. 26 together with<br/>
the shaft has been filled up with stones<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and all that can <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>recognized<br/>
of its paintings is the back <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>an enormous Apep serpent, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>enemy of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sun-ship </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We notice the two long galleries to the left with numerous entrances <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>without any remarkable tombs, and ascend again to the<br/>
right to <span style="color: #0000FF;">No</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>16, a tomb well worth seeing, belonging to Horemheb,<br/>
who'seems to have held a series of <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices</span>, especially that of overseer<br/>
of the cattle, in the successive reigns of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>II. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, Amenhotep II. and III., and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>IV., of the 18th Dynasty. Close to<br/>
it is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb </span>(No. 17) of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tenuna</span>, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fan-bearer </span>on the king's right<br/>
hand, and adjoining this, but turned towards the N., the tomb of<br/>
Amenophis (No. 102), second Prophet to Ammon, and of his wife<br/>
Roi. The paintings in this contain a scale in which gold rings are<br/>
being weighed, various workmen, <span style="color: #ff0000;">one </span>of whom is making a Sphinx,<br/>
clerks with tables writing out the crops, and a statue with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">ram </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s<br/>
</span>head; on the right music and dancing.<br/>
<br/>
A little higher to the right is the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zanuni </span>(No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Care<br/>
</span>should he taken at the entrance, to avoid falling into the deep shaft.<br/>
The paintings represent <span style="color: #ff0000;">Reteunu </span>bringing presents in gold, silver, lapislazuli, and emeralds<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>We have now almost reached the summit of the hill, and can<br/>
enjoy the <span style="color: #ff0000;">magnificent </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">*View </span>including the Ramesseum, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnon<br/>
</span>statues, and on the other side of the Nile Luxor and Karnak; to the<br/>
right below the hills is seen the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofD </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-bahri</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>path leading to the Tombs of the Kings. We now descend <span style="color: #0000FF;">past<br/>
