is depicted. He, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">living </span>type of the beautiful Horus, the son of<br/>
the sun, the child of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather </span>(as the Pharaoh is frequently named<br/>
in this temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">llathor</span>), the visible representative of the deity,<br/>
and as ruler of Egypt the <span style="color: #0000FF;">incorporation </span>of all the temporal interests<br/>
of the state, he it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>alone, to judge from the representations and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>, whose sacred person might enter the holy of holies and<br/>
in solitude commune with the deity. Only once a year was this<br/>
permitted even to him, at the great festival of the New Year. We<br/>
here see the monarch opening the door of the sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">cella</span>, closed<br/>
with a sealed band of <span style="color: #ff0000;">hyblos</span>. He breaks the seal and removes the<br/>
strip of <span style="color: #0000FF;">byblos </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">sesh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tebtu </span>and seker <span style="color: #0000FF;">ultra</span>), he <span style="color: #0000FF;">place</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>his hands in<br/>
the two rings on the door and thrusts back the bolts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascends </span>the<br/>
steps leading to the cella, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span>gazes upon the hidden figure<br/>
of the goddess, and offers his homage<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Other designs exhibit the<br/>
monarch performing the prescribed ceremonies of offering incense<br/>
before the two sacred boats of Hathor and her companion, Horus of<br/>
Edfu, and before the boats of Isis and her companion Osiris. The<br/>
portable boats (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tes-nefm</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.'the bearers of beauties'), which are<br/>
here depicted on the side-walls, formerly stood in Room A, and<br/>
held the shrines in which were the sacred images of the deities.<br/>
The shrines were carried in solemn processions by the priests,<br/>
sometimes without the boats, as <span style="color: #ff0000;">6.9. </span>at the new year's festival represented on the staircase (p. 91). and sometimes standing in the<br/>
boats.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">8ide-rooms </span>of the Adytum are, as mentioned above, entered<br/>
from corridor <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>. Behind the Adytum, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>, lies No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>, the<br/>
Large Chamber, the largest and most sacred of these side-rooms.<br/>
The sanctity of this chamber is evidenced by the painting, in which<br/>
the king is portrayed exactly as in the Adytum itself. ascending the<br/>
steps to the shrine <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">llathor</span>, breaking the seal, and opening the<br/>
doors, grasping the handles in his hands. Noteworthy also are the<br/>
representations of the king offering vases of wine to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baths</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">t0 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahi</span>, her son, in each case followed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>harp-playing goddess of<br/>
the north and of the south. Two other pictures represent Pepi, the<br/>
original builder of the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>81), kneeling before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>bearing Ahi in his hands, and the later builder with a mirror before<br/>
the goddess in a double shrine. The inscriptions give the dimensions of these images and state that they were made of gold, so that<br/>
