<span>14 Route 1. BENIHASAN<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>From Cairo<br/>
<br/>
in its Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">oounterparti</span>. The columns of Benihasan <span style="color: #0000FF;">consist</span>,<br/>
like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>column, of a basis, an octagonal or sixteen-sided<br/>
shaft with 16 or 20 flutes, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">capital</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and an abacus. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">eehinus<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">chymatium </span>is, however, wanting. While the swelling or <span style="color: #0000FF;">entasis<br/>
</span>on some <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>columns, and also the <span style="color: #ff0000;">annuli </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span>rings at the top of<br/>
the shaft, have hitherto met with no <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>explanation, the<br/>
same <span style="color: #0000FF;">features </span>appear as natural and necessary parts of the so-called<br/>
'plant column' <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEgypt</span>. The architects of the Nile aimed <span style="color: #0000FF;">consciously<br/>
</span>at a reproduction of the stem of a plant, and as the capitals <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented </span>a bunch of buds it was natural that the cords which fastened<br/>
them should not <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>absent. Their number is five; and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">3 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>5 <span style="color: #0000FF;">annuli </span>at the top of a Dorie column, erroneously explained as <span style="color: #0000FF;">incisions </span>made for the ropes used in hoisting it to its place, are<br/>
simply an inheritance fiom the Egyptian column. The idea of the<br/>
annuli, as of the entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>column, is of Egyptian origin, though<br/>
the perfect Greek column, with the beautiful <span style="color: #ff0000;">transitiou-member<br/>
</span>formed by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eehinus</span>, is far from a mere imitation.'The Greek<br/>
column has become an entirely new form, animated by a new <span style="color: #0000FF;">principle </span>proper to itself, which has thoroughly mastered the heterogeneous elements from without and blended them in a new unity.'<br/>
In farther emphasis of the importance of these columns in the history of art, we may remind the reader that the earliest Dorie <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span>known to us date from about the time that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psamtikidae<br/>
</span>(p. xxix) were not only allowing the Greeks to enter the valley of<br/>
the Nile but were inviting them to settle there, and that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span>of Benihasan are 1500 years older than this. The columns of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Benihasan </span>are indeed nothing more than the pillars in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Temple<br/>
</span>of the Sphinx and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastaba </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Paedeker</span>'s Lower Egypt, pp. 365,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">379</span>) provided with flutes and <span style="color: #0000FF;">chamfered </span>edges.<br/>
<br/>
The two tombs of chief interest, the farthest to the N., are easily<br/>
recognised by the beautiful polygonal columns at their entrances.<br/>
The donkey-drivers make directly for them, paying no attention to<br/>
the others. The numbering begins at the N. end.<br/>
<br/>
Tomb I. The exterior of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronaos </span>or vestibule is distinguished by two <span style="color: #ff0000;">fine </span>octagonal columns, bearing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vault </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn<br/>
</span>out of the rock. Four <span style="color: #0000FF;">sixteen-edged </span>columns, with narrow <span style="color: #0000FF;">fluting</span>,<br/>
stand in the interior of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chamber </span>and appear to bear the<br/>
three beautifully painted arches of the ceiling, which are hewn in<br/>
the form of shallow barrel vaulting. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-columns </span>touch the<br/>
right and left walls of the nearly square chamber, in the rear of<br/>
which opens a recess containing the statues (much dilapidated) of<br/>
the deceased and his two <span style="color: #ff0000;">wives</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The usual long shaft leading to<br/>
the bottom of the tomb and the chamber for the corpse at the end<br/>
of it are also present. This is the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span>or Ameni,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Some details on this matter will <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>found in the section devoted<br/>
to Egyptian art in the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">volume </span>of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">Handbook </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">too</span>).<br/>
