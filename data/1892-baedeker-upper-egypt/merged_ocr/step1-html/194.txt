being then completed by the Pelusiac arm of the Nile. The canal,<br/>
frequently suffered to fall into disuse, was restored by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekho </span>(7th<br/>
cent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span>.) and at a later period by Darius <span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>Communication<br/>
between the Nile and the Red Sea was maintained even under the<br/>
Arabs, but it was afterwards interrupted, and not restored until the<br/>
construction of the present fresh-water canal by Lesseps. The<br/>
bastions which defended it are those that compelled the Jews during<br/>
the Exodus to change their <span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>route at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Etham </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Etam, Le.<br/>
the fortified places (<span style="color: #ff0000;">khetem</span>), and to turn towards the Red Sea <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the S. The relief, which is gradually becoming more and more<br/>
indistinct, deserves careful study. The conqueror of the Semites,<br/>
who is here joyfully welcomed as he approaches in his chariot, is<br/>
the ancestor of the Pharaoh of the Bible narrative who perished in<br/>
the Red Sea.<br/>
<br/>
The victorious monarch next appears, after his arrival at Thebes.<br/>
As in the upper representation, he conducts to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>two rows of<br/>
rebellious Asiatic princes, captured in the land of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Retennu</span>, and<br/>
presents to the god magnificent vessels.<br/>
<br/>
We have now returned to the door by which we left the hypostyle hall. It is adorned with the name of Ramses the Great.<br/>
To the right and left are two <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>companion reliefs, in which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>is represented holding several rows of captives by cords, and<br/>
presenting the weapons of victory to King Seti, who raises his sword<br/>
against a band of foes whom he holds by the hair. The name-rings<br/>
on both sides refer to the conquered <span style="color: #0000FF;">tribes </span>The legend on the relief<br/>
to the left is noteworthy<span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>smites the great ones of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Annu<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mentau </span>(with the symbols of the shepherds), all the remote regions,<br/>
all lands, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fenekhu </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Phoenician</span>) of the sea-region, the Sati,<br/>
the great circle of the green ocean' <span style="color: #0000FF;">fi.e</span>. the Mediterranean Sea).<br/>
<br/>
We turn next to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">representation </span>on the RIGHT <span style="color: #0000FF;">two </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sum </span>of the<br/>
door. To the extreme right, at the corner of Pylon IL, above, we<br/>
see the storming of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Katesh </span>in the land of Amara (tho <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amorites</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>.<br/>
This is the fortress which offered such serious resistance to the army<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>III., and it was the greatest obstacle to the victorious<br/>
progress of the Egyptian army in the wars of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seti </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>son<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tamses</span>. The scene is depicted with great <span style="color: #0000FF;">vividness</span>. The Aramaic<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">foes </span>of the king (the Kheta) appear both on foot and in chariots;<br/>
and Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">overcomes </span>his foes <span style="color: #0000FF;">fighting </span>also on foot and in his chariot.<br/>
The fees, who wear curious peaked hoods, flee in wild <span style="color: #0000FF;">confusion<br/>
</span>The Egyptian artist here shows some appreciation of landscape<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">effects</span>. A forest region is represented, though somewhat crudely,<br/>
with six <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>kinds of trees and shrubs. A herd of cattle belonging to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eheta</span>, terrified by the approach of the king, fly from<br/>
their pasture, accompanied by the herdsmen, who toss their arms<br/>
in despair. Katesh is taken, and the defenders are thrown from<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">walls</span>. This is the only relief that has <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>preserved in the<br/>
upper row.<br/>
