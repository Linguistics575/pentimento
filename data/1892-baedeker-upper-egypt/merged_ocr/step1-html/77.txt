<br/>
Not only are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">subject </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â» </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>representations of great interest,<br/>
but the <span style="color: #0000FF;">character </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architectural </span>drawing itself should be <span style="color: #0000FF;">noticed</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is something between a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sketclkplan </span>and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>picture.<br/>
The ground-plan is clearly indicated, but at the same time an idea<br/>
is given <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>appearance <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>external elevation of the building.<br/>
Clearness and truthful reproduction of details are aimed at here as<br/>
zealously as in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tigure-drawing</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">ground-planisfirst </span>sketched<br/>
in, and then the outlines of the facades, and even the doors and<br/>
trees are added so far as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">space </span>allows.<br/>
<br/>
The forms of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">personsrepresented </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">varyeonsiderably </span>from those<br/>
seen in tombs elsewhere. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Almost </span>all have <span style="color: #ff0000;">thcsume </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tlsicksetbudy </span>and<br/>
lean <span style="color: #0000FF;">neck </span>that <span style="color: #0000FF;">characterize </span>the king. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the latter is, of<br/>
course, a portrait; and it is possible that the courtly artists <span style="color: #0000FF;">bur-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dened </span>the subjects with the weaknesses of the prince so that his <span style="color: #ff0000;">clefonnities </span>might not appear as anything unusual<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenhotep </span>IV.<br/>
was certainly <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>a foreigner; but his mother Tii may have been<br/>
one, and may have installed her <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellow-eountrymen </span>at the Egyptian<br/>
court. Even the highest dignitaries have <span style="color: #0000FF;">un-Egyptian </span>features.<br/>
Among these is the royal favourite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Merim</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>represented on<br/>
the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomb </span>3, as literally overwhelmed with the golden<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">necklaces</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">rings</span>, and orders, which the Pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty<br/>
delighted to shower on their loyal adherents; he stands in front of<br/>
the royal family, the members of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are attended by fan-bearers<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">eourtiers </span>of all kinds.'Let him receive gold', says the <span style="color: #ff0000;">iustrription</span>,'on his neck, on his back, and on his feet'. Secretaries make<br/>
a note of the donations <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>write out the royal patents, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are<br/>
also mentioned <span style="color: #0000FF;">elsewhere</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The fourth necklace is being hung<br/>
round the neck <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Merira</span>, while the fifth and sixth are handed to<br/>
him by two <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>; <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>third attendant holds three golden rings.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Urma</span>, to whom this favourite belonged, were, in addition to<br/>
their other <span style="color: #0000FF;">dignities</span>, the most learned physicians <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">high-priests </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lleliopolis </span>(mentioned in the inscription<span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The sickly prince <span style="color: #ff0000;">wrturally </span>pays the highest honours to his physician, one of the Urma<br/>
priests. Another of these priests, named <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khui</span>, is mentioned in the<br/>
libers Papyrus as having prepared a famous <span style="color: #0000FF;">eye-salt </span>and it is possible that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenhotep </span>IV. may have been blind or, at least, <span style="color: #0000FF;">threatened </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>blindness. llis outstretched neck suggests the attitude<br/>
of a blind man, and in the song of one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">priestesses </span>by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">door-post </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>the same tomb occur the words:'The lord of <span style="color: #0000FF;">goodness<br/>
</span>arises.... No other one opens his countenance, healing his eyes<br/>
with his beams'.<br/>
<br/>
Tomb <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span>contained the remains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'truth-loving</span>' <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aulmtes</span>, the<br/>
royal secretary, adjutant of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fan-bearers</span>, and first lord of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bedchamber</span>. Here we <span style="color: #0000FF;">tind </span>one of the great dignitaries celebrating<br/>
the glory of the sun. He praises the beauty of the setting of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lord </span>of the lords and <span style="color: #0000FF;">princes </span>of the earth, at sight of <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">electbreak </span>forth into rejoicing, <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span>rising and setting the whole<br/>
