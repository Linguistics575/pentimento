</span>Seth was obliterated at various epochs. The introduction of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christianity </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">edicts </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theodosius </span>were followed by the destruction <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>many pagan statues and the obliteration of many pagan inscriptions. At all events the new religion and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">closing </span>of the<br/>
temples <span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicated </span>to the ancient gods <span style="color: #0000FF;">removed </span>all possibility of<br/>
anything being done to <span style="color: #0000FF;">preserve </span>the monuments of the Pharaohs.<br/>
The Nile, which annually overflowed as far as the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak<br/>
</span>in particular, and the saline exudations of the soil, wrought harm;<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">jackals </span>and other animals sought shelter in the subterranean <span style="color: #0000FF;">cham-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bers</span>; many tombs, at first occupied by Christian hermits, were <span style="color: #0000FF;">converted </span>into peasants' dwellings; Christian churches were erected in<br/>
the temple-halls, and houses were <span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>the columns of the<br/>
temple at Luxor. Carefully hewn blocks and slabs were removed<br/>
from the monuments, which were used as quarries, and many<br/>
limestone details were thrown into the furnace and reduced to<br/>
lime. Whither the enormous population of the hundred-gated<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Thelma </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">betook </span>itself is unknown. A few widely-scattered villages<br/>
alone now represent of the giant city. These have given names to<br/>
the various <span style="color: #ff0000;">ttditiees </span>and tombs, whose holy names might only be<br/>
uttered with pious <span style="color: #0000FF;">awe </span>in the time of the Pharaohs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The ruins of<br/>
Thebes remained long forgotten. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the revival <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflearning </span>classical<br/>
students recalled their fame; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pococke </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rediscovered</span>, described them<br/>
and drew them; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span>the publications of the great French<br/>
Expedition <span style="color: #0000FF;">revealed </span>to astonished Europe how much of the ancient<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">magnificenee </span>of the Pharaohs had survived to our time. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Each<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeding </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">seientifie </span>expedition made its longest halt here and<br/>
found here its richest rewards. The names of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Champollion</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wilkinson</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius</span>, and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptologists </span>are familiar words on the<br/>
site of ancient Thebes; and Mariette, who carried on <span style="color: #0000FF;">excavations<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">muler </span>the auspices of the Khedive, must also <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>mentioned<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

10. The Temple of Luxor<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The name of Luxor is derived from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Nutt </span>pl. el-.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ar</span>, and means'the castles, having <span style="color: #0000FF;">reference </span>to the extensive<br/>
temple in <span style="color: #0000FF;">whirl</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>part of the village of Luxor was built, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">arljoined </span>by another part. The mosque still stands within the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">temple </span>The house of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">British </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">consul</span>, as well as the so-called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kagi- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Frans/ivi</span>, and other buildings, which formerly stood here,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>been removed within the last few years, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">t. </span>side of the<br/>
temple laid free. and the interior <span style="color: #0000FF;">cleansed</span>. The chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance </span>on<br/>
the N., with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylons </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>their obelisks still on their ancient site,<br/>
is also to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>thoroughly <span style="color: #0000FF;">excavated</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seen </span>from the river, the temple<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>presents a highly imposing <span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">previously </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">interfered<br/>
