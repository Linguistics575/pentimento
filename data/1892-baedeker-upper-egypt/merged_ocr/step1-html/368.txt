<span>286 Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">20</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">PHILA-T</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Temple<br/>
<br/>
Isis, the life giving goddess of <span style="color: #0000FF;">dab</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>of Abaton <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the holy island. The last name deserves mention here, for the spot known to<br/>
the ancients as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abaton</span>, which must have been peculiarly holy in<br/>
their eyes, is named innumerable times in the inscriptions of the<br/>
temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Isis</span>. It must therefore be looked for <span style="color: #0000FF;">011 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila </span>itself. The<br/>
inscription on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arehitrave </span>of the outer or West Side <span style="color: #0000FF;">state</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>that<br/>
the king erected this building for his mother Isis, and that he rebuilt the hall for her of good white hewn stone, surrounded with<br/>
columns, with inscriptions throughout its whole extent, and, as the<br/>
line below the architrave adds, painted in colours. The inner side<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave </span>bears an invocation to Isis, mother of the gods.<br/>
<br/>
This little temple had doors on the E. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">w. </span>sides, not,<br/>
however, opposite to each other, and another on the N. side, next<br/>
the main temple. The last leads into a spacious <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fore- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Court<br/>
</span>(P1. B), <span style="color: #0000FF;">enclosed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the right and left by covered Colonnades. The<br/>
W. <span style="color: #ff0000;">eolonnade </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. F) follows the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bank </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the river, while that to<br/>
the E. or right (Pl. D) runs in the direction of the centre of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>great pylon, but not at right angles to it, affording an example<br/>
of the variety of axial direction exhibited throughout the temple.<br/>
<br/>
When we remember that a portion of the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylon </span>and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">hypathral </span>space, which we have <span style="color: #0000FF;">just </span>quitted, were built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus</span>, and that all the other parts of the temple are of later data,<br/>
we have an adequate explanation of the great irregularity displayed<br/>
in its plan. It is quite certain that the structures that now bear<br/>
the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neetanebus </span>(a portal and a vestibule) were not the<br/>
only buildings on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>under that king, for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>of<br/>
every temple, without exception, began with the sanctuary and<br/>
ended with the doors. We may <span style="color: #0000FF;">assume </span>that an <span style="color: #0000FF;">extensive </span>temple<br/>
stood here before its removal by the Persians; and that the latter<br/>
largely destroyed the works of their rival. The parts that were<br/>
spared were then incorporated by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemaie </span>builders, while the<br/>
Romans united the work of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lagidse </span>with the ancient vestibule<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus </span>by means of the tapering <span style="color: #0000FF;">peristyle </span>court.<br/>
<br/>
b. The Colonnaded Court. This space is bounded on the W.<br/>
side by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>wall, pierced here and there with windows, which,<br/>
based on a firm substructure on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river-bank</span>, forms the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>of<br/>
a narrow, but unusually long <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnade </span>(Pl. <span style="color: #ff0000;">F</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>100 yds.). The<br/>
latter, built under the Romans, has a row of 31 (formerly 32) <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span>each 16 ft. high, on its E. side, and has a roof of good <span style="color: #ff0000;">cassetted </span>work. The colour of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>and representations<br/>
is still remarkably <span style="color: #0000FF;">vivid </span>in various places, especially in the S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">portion </span>near the vestibule of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus</span>. There appear Nero with his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches</span>, Claudius <span style="color: #0000FF;">Casar </span>and Germanicus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Autocrator </span>before<br/>
Horus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tasentnefert </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pinebtati </span>(who also <span style="color: #0000FF;">appears </span>at Ombos,<br/>
p. 261) worshipping the lord of Ombos. Farther to the N., on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>wall of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnade </span>are the name of Tiberius and a tine<br/>
Greek inscription, <span style="color: #0000FF;">beginning'Appu'ma</span>; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Atovusiou </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sr/iv </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">emi<br/>
