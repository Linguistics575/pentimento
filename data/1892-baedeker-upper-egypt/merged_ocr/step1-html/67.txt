<br/>
the son of the Lady Hannu, who was <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>of the chief dignitaries<br/>
of the kingdom, bore the title of an erpa <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>or prince, governed<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mall </span>in time of peace, and commanded a division of<br/>
the army in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wart </span>To the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>right of the entrance he is depicted on a throne with lions<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>feet, holding his <span style="color: #0000FF;">commander</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>baton in<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand</span>. Inside the door are two well-preserved inscriptions<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>cut in the stone. That to the right (<span style="color: #ff0000;">so </span>informs us that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha<br/>
</span>departed this life in the 43rd year of Usertesen L, <span style="color: #0000FF;">corresponding<br/>
</span>to the 25th year <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the governorship of Ameni. He undertook all<br/>
his wars'sailing up-stream<span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>he campaigned only against<br/>
the dwellers of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.</span>, the'miserable Kushites', as they are called<br/>
in the inscription. In those days the arms of the Pharaohs had not<br/>
yet been carried towards the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>The Sinai peninsula, with its<br/>
mines, is the only district in this direction which excited the Egyption lust of conquest. From his southern campaigns <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha<br/>
</span>brought home much gold and other booty. The inscription to the<br/>
left <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">NJ </span>also mentions a victorious campaign towards the S., but<br/>
is of special interest for the light it throws on the truly human<br/>
feelings of this <span style="color: #ff0000;">bye-gone </span>time. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span>describes his <span style="color: #ff0000;">oeoupations </span>in time of peace as follows <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>beginning at the fourth line from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">below</span>):'I cultivated the entire nome of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mali </span>with many workpeople. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>troubled no child and oppressed no widow, neither did<br/>
I keep <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fisherman from his fishing or a herdsman from his herd.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">There </span>was no head of a village whose people I had taken away for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">compulsory </span>labour, and there was no one unhappy in my days or<br/>
hungry in my times. When, however, a famine arose, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>tilled all<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Malt</span>, from its S. to its N. boundary, and<br/>
gave nourishment and life to its inhabitants. So there was no one<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dome </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>died of hunger. To the widow I allowed as much<br/>
as to the wife of a man, and in all that I did I never preferred the<br/>
great man to the small one. When the Nile rose again and <span style="color: #0000FF;">everything </span>flourished - <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields</span>, trees, and all <span style="color: #0000FF;">else</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>cut off nothing<br/>
from the fields'.<br/>
<br/>
The paintings in the interior of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tomb-ehamher </span>proper are<br/>
unfortunately very much faded, and they have also been considerably injured, especially in recent years. Some <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">warriors </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Which </span>still remain, armed with <span style="color: #0000FF;">club </span>and axe or club and lance,<br/>
have a foreign appearance, as their skin is of a lighter <span style="color: #0000FF;">colour </span>than<br/>
that <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the Egyptians, and their hair and <span style="color: #0000FF;">beards </span>are red.<br/>
<br/>
Tomb No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lo </span>is that of Khnumhotep, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">son </span>of Nehera. It owes<br/>
its origin to a member of a family of high rank, in which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office<br/>
</span>of governor of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Malt </span>seems to have been hereditary for several generations. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ameuumha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, Usertesen <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ameliemha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, the first<br/>
kings of the 12th Dyn., showered titles and dignities with a free<br/>
hand on this family, which in return clung to the royal line with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiar </span>loyalty and affection. By a wonderful piece of good fortune<br/>
we are able to <span style="color: #0000FF;">reproduce </span>the entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">family-tree </span>of this family, in<br/>
