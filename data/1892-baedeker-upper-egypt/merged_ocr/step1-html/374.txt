<br/>
the first pylon. An inner staircase <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascends </span>to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>pylon<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>whence<br/>
we proceed across the ruined roof to the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylon</span>. To reach the<br/>
top of the W. pylon, we ascend the staircase to the Osiris-rooms<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>295), and then proceed leaving these on the right. The ascent<br/>
of the first pylon (p. 288) is, however, preferable in every <span style="color: #0000FF;">respect</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the front of the E. wing facing the peristyle court is a semicircular <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stele </span>of reddish brown granite, <span style="color: #0000FF;">erected </span>to commemorate a<br/>
lavish grant of lands, by which Ptolemy VII<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Philometor (94 <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.G</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>
</span>enriched the temple. It was inscribed on the polished <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall </span>of<br/>
a monolithic chapel built into the pylon. The king, however, seems<br/>
merely to have granted to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>priests a new lease of the ancient<br/>
property of the goddess. On the pylon are some <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colossal </span>Figures.<br/>
To the right is King Neos Dionysus holding his enemies by the hair,<br/>
before <span style="color: #ff0000;">Horsiisi </span>and Hathor; beneath, smaller representations. To<br/>
the left the king appears before Osiris and Isis. The grooves for<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">flag-staffs </span>should also <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>noted. The Portal (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. p) to the temple<br/>
proper, approached by a shallow <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight </span>of steps, was built by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span>II. in imitation of the portal of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus </span>in the first pylon.<br/>
Within it the predecessors of the builder are recounted.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple of Isis proper, entered by this portal, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">built<br/>
</span>according to an independent plan, embracing a hypostyle, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronaos </span>with various divisions, and a sanctuary, with two <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-rooms</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">n. </span>Philadelphus <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the founder of this temple, to whose<br/>
decoration the hostile <span style="color: #0000FF;">brothers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Philometor </span>and Euergetes <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Physkon</span>)<br/>
contributed <span style="color: #ff0000;">most </span>largely. It was only natural that <span style="color: #0000FF;">both </span>the weak hut<br/>
amiable <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philometor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the vicious hut energetic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Physkon </span>should interest<br/>
themselves in the sanctuary of Isis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">both </span>were much interested in<br/>
retaining Nubia. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Are </span>aware that the former maintained a military<br/>
station to the S. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">PhiltP</span>, which afterwards grew into the town <span style="color: #ff0000;">of<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Parembole </span>(p.305). Later <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies </span>are also named here. We refrain<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>closer examination of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>reliefs and inscriptions in this temple,<br/>
though they are not uninteresting from a mythological point of view, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eontenting </span>ourselves with a reference to the detailed descriptions of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>temples at Denderah (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">80</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Edfu (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>).<br/>
<br/>
h. The Hypostyle (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. N) contains ten columns arranged in<br/>
three rows. The second and third rows contain each two columns<br/>
to the right and two to the left; while the first row has only the two<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eorner-columns</span>, the space between them being left uncovered for<br/>
the sake of light. The hall thus consists properly speaking of two<br/>
portions: an uncovered <span style="color: #0000FF;">fore-court </span>with two doors, on the right and<br/>
left, leading to the outside of the temple, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">covered </span>part behind.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">columns </span>are <span style="color: #ff0000;">241'2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft.-high </span>and 133/4 ft. in circumference. The<br/>
uncovered portion could be shaded from the sun by means of a<br/>
velarium; the holes for the cords are still visible in the upper part<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the concave cornice turned towards the second pylon. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colouring </span>of this hall, which has been preserved on the ceiling and the<br/>
columns, must have been very brilliant. The Capitals are the most<br/>
instructive of all the specimens that have come down to us of the<br/>
manner in which the Egyptians coloured their columns.<br/>
