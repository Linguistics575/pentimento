is understood a fertile and inhabited spot in the midst of the desert. The
oases owe their fertility to the springs which rise in them, frequently
thermal and containing iron, sulphur, or other mineral ingredients. The
most abundant trees in the oases are the date-palm, acacias uf variuus
Tiind l. rm Nilutica m mums), apricots, and other fruit-trees; the
chief grain-erops are wheat, barley, and rise, with a little dura (Sorghum
tulgure) and dukhn fPenicillaria spicata); and indigo, tobacco, and cotton
are also grown (see Vol. L, pp. 63 seq.).

\ simpler arrangement, recognized as early as Tutmes 111., divides them
into Northern and Southern Oases, the first signifying probably Bahriyeh,
the latter Khtirgeh and dehel. The two last were also united under the
name Great Oasis (85:31.; 11:19.73 ], distinguished at the same time as the

Outer (S: r Lgi J)' El-wits el-kharigeh) and the Inner Oasis

(r1suo' iw El-wih ed-dakhileh). The oasis of Bahriyeh, the North

also El-wdb el-behnesah, because the route to it diverged atBehnesuh on the

visit to Khirgeh and perhaps also to naknch m the visit Ito biwah involves a long and fatiguing journey. The latter, however, is also de"bed below on account of its great historical interest.

For a visit to the oases a caravan of riding and sumpher-caIyels is
necessary. Ruling Camel: or dromedaries travel about 2S N. in 12 m. "
"considerably more if pressed (comp. p. 75); ordinary camels only about
19 miles. The camels should be divided into convenient groups, and the
traveller should make sure that he has a eomfortable saddle for his ride
of eight days or more. A tent, a generous supply of tinned provisions,
and water must also be provided. Water may be carried either in casks
(hermit), leather skins (which, however, impart a disagreeable flavour to
their contents after a day or two), or still better inl iron coffers lined
with enamel (safiha). The services ofa trustworthy caravan-leader should
he secured by application to a consular agent or other reliable authority;
and guns, powder and shot, and a supply of money in small coins and
Maria Theresa Ihalers should be provided. The traveller should avoid
displaying large sums m money before the Arabs, and he should be strict
in maintaining the discipline of the caravan.
