the river the gigantic ruins of Karnak.

18. The Tombs of Sh√©kh cAbel el-Kurnah.

With this part of the Necvopolis of Thebes, which may be reached
from Der el-Medineh in 25 min., we conclude our first day on the w. bank
in our three days' plan. Gaze's tourists make it their second day, Cook's
begin their third day with the Ramesseum (R. 13) and the tombs of
'AM eLRumah, as in our five days plan. The tombs to he visited may
be found without a guide. They are reached by ascending the E. side of
the Libyan mountains in a direct line from the Ramessenin. Many of the
tombs here are inhabited by fellMpin. The sepulchral chambers Serve
as dwelling-places, wooden doors are hung in the entrances, and the
fore-court is often enclosed by a clay wall for the confinement of their
live stock. In from of most of these cave-dwellings stand covered cyiinders like gigantic mushrooms, of Nile mud and straw kneaded together. These are the primitive granaries of the inhabitants of'Abd elIiurnah, several of whom are well-to-do, with houses of Nile bricks, eunspieuous from a considerable distance. Those who are desirous of st
any length of time should make arrangements with the weal thy and worthy
Cum, Team, uncle of the German consular agent at Luxor. The erection of a house for travellers has been under consideration, and would
be of especial benefit to scholars by sparing them the daily journey to
and form Lax Shelter, may be found in the house of Mohammed rAhd
e1sRasill, provisions being brought from Lunar. Several European schuh
; s have chosen'Abi1-elr1iurmah as their centre for investigations nu the
w. bank, amnng them Champelliou, XVilkinson, Lepsius (whose lodging,
in the tombs is still known by the felliiyin as the Kasr Lepsius), Prisse
d'Avennes, and Ebets. The visitor to the tombs hvist lirst face smne
savage dogs, but he will be thoroughly repaid partly by the interest which
some of the tombs afford, and partly by the mag iliveut View which is
ohlained from those in the higher positions. especially at sunset. In this
part of the Necropnlis of Thebes were buried the wealthy nubi tity of the
18th Dyn., upon whose tombs large sums of money must have been spent.
The inscriptions record that the deceased were in their life-tinte invested
with the highest spiritual and temporal dignities and that they enjoyed
ahnnst royal estates, their pride in which they show in sculptures and
inscriptions. However death is not forgotten in these toth, for there, is
no la of funereat epitaphs. In almost all of them too we find genealogical tables, by which we learn that many of those buried here were
related to each other.

The more important tombs were numbered by Wilkinson, but most
of the figures have been obliterated. In 1885 Prof. Eisenlnhr renumbered
the tombs, in all 127, including those with no inscriptions. In the mllon _
ing desrwiptiod Mths tombs reference is made to these numbers, which
appear in the adjoining small plan. If time is limited, it will he suflicient to visit the tombs uf Kha-enx t, Ramses, Nekht, Sen-uefer, Anna,
Horemheh, and Ramenkheperseneh.

The traveller is recommended to begin with two tombs on the

eastern side of the hill behind the Ramesseum. The one to the left

dent of the royal granaries, of the time ofAmenhotep III. The tomb
has been long known, and in consequence is much injured. It lies
behind a square court cut out of the hill, and has two other tombs
near it.

The tomb of Jiha-em-Yit consists of three halls lying one behind the
other, the first and third of which are at right angles to its length. (In
