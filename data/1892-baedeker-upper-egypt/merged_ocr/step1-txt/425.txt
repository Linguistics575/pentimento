above the island of Karyiu, is the village of Aksheh, with a few sepulchral vaults and a small temple, in which Ramses ll. worships
the god Ammon in Pa-Rau-ma as well as his own deified person.
Opposite Serreh (E. bank), lie the ruins of a walled village, a little
beyond which, near Diberch (E. bank), occurs a fine palm-grove.
Above Eallhch [ E bank) are the tombs of the sh√©khs'Omar and
'Ali. We next pass the island ofDubros, with a village of the same
name on the E. bank, and finally reach Wadi Halfah, consisting of
several settlements, and named after a kind of grass0Jalrab) which
is here common. The present military station and stopping-place
of the steamboat is named Ankish. A permanent garrison has been
stationed here since the war in the Sihlin, consisting of native regiments (mainly negroes) under British officers. An introduction to
the commandant is convenient and ensures a friendly welcome. A
