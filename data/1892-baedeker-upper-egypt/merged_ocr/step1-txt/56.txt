side. The excursion, which has no great interest except for the tine
view of the Nile valley, takes 11/2-2 hrs. Other convents of a similar
kind (see, e.g., p. M) can be reached more easily. The convent,
also named Dtr Stitch Maryam elvAdhrah or convent of Lady Mary
the Virgin, consists of a group of miserable huts, occupied not only
by the monks but by laymen with their wives and children, and
looks like a fortified village. Most of the monks employ themselves
in making shoes. The underground chapel in which service is held
is uninteresting. The institution is very old, and curious tales are
told of it by Makrizi, Kazwini, Suyuti, and other Arabic writers.

'This convent', says Makrizi,'is ancient, overlooks the Nile, and is
reached by a staircase hewn in the hill; it lies opposite Saiulutx Theo,
following el-Sh2boshti, he narrates how it is visited by pilgrim" from all
quarters and lies on the'hill of the caverns'.'At one point of the bill',
he continues,'is a narrow fissure, and on the saint" s day of the convent
all the bakir-birds+ in the neighbourhood come flying to this fissure,
flocking together in a huge crowd and making a tremendous aim one
after the other in constant succession thrusts its head into the cleft, and
utters a scream, until one comes whose head sticks fast and eonnot be
withdrawn. The victim then beats its wings against the rocks until it
dies, after which all the other birds depart and leave the rock in solitude
and silence.'This', adds the writer,'is now a thing of the past'. Similar
legends are found in Antiquity The Pharaohs, on ascending the throne,
let birds loose to bear the tidings to the four quarters of the globe. Herodotus and zElian tell of feathered ambassadors dispatched in this way from
Egypt, and to this category apparently belongs the myth of the birds of
MemnOn, which on certain days visited the grave of the Son of the Dawn,
who fell before Troy. cleansed it with their beaks, and besprinkled it with
water by dipping their feathers in the stream. Though this legend may
have originated in A i, it was afterwards, like Nemnnn himself (p.154),
transplanted to the hie.
The Wadi et-Tér (E. bank) leads from the Gebel et-Tér to the S E.
About 11/2 M. to the S. of its mouth is the village of Teimzh ef-.TtMthttte
t'Tehueh of the mill'). Before reaching it we pass the ancient Ifitdn el'agils, or'walls of the old woman', probably erected as a barrier to the
desert-hurricanes. At Tehneh, which is about 3/4 M. from the Nile, are two
groups of tombs, that to the N. belonging to the latest period at which rock-.
tombs were constructed on the Nile, while that to the S. belongs to the
early epoch of the ancient kingdom. The necropolis to which these tombs
belonged is supposed to be that of the town of Akoris, mentioned by Ptolemy alone and belonging to the name of Cynopolis. Mounds mark the
site of the ancient town. Beyond rise the rocks, containing tombs of the
time of the I'tolemies and several short Greek inscriptions. One sepulchral chapel, containing some singular representati us of a late date, is
interesting The colours on the ceiling have faded, but the paintings on
the walls are still distinguishable. In front, on the left wall, stands the
deceased, in Roman costume; opposite, on the right wall, he appears again,
offering a sacrifice, as a sign that though in the Roman service or at least
of Roman tastes he yet reveres the gods of his ancestors. The representations of these deities occur on all four walls of the chamber and are
so numerous that they must include the local divinities, not only of Akoris,
but also of all the other places in the name, of which the deceased, whose
name is not decipherable, may have been nomarch. The only inscriptions
extant are on the inner side of the door. Higher up on the rock-walls are
two horses in the Roman style, held by men. Between the two were other
sculptures, the subjects of which are no longer recognisable. The first

neck, ringed near the head, black wing-feathers, and the ability to swim.
