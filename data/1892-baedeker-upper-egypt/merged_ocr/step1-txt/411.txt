dedicated to these two deities, as is also indicated by the representations to the right and left of the entrance-door. Above the small
door on the right are the dedications of Tutmes Ill. and Amenhotep IL The three apartments contained scenes of worship, scenes
from the founding of the templ e, and sacrificial scenes. The traveller
should notice the carefully executed portraits of the three kings who
took part in the erection ofthe temple, Tutmes 111., Amenhotep 11.,
and Tutmes IV.

On the back-wall of the sanctuary is a stele of great historical
importance. At the top is a relief of Amenhotep II. presenting two
vessels of wine to Harmaehis and Ammon-Ra; beneath is an inscription of 20 lines, from the 3rd year of the reign of Amenhotep 11. After a flattering account of the king and his achievements
(repeated on a stole found at Erment and now in Vienna), the
completion of the temple begun by Tutmes 111. is mentioned.

Line 12.'Behold, the king adorned the house of the god (which had
been erected by) his father, King Tutmes m., for all the divine fathers,
huilt of stone as an enduring work, with in protecting wall of bricks
around it. The doors were of the tiaest acacin-wood, the gateways of
enduring stone, with the object of commemorating, for ever the great name of
his father Tutmes 111. in this temple. King Amenhotep IL celebrated the
festival of the laying of the foundation-stone in honour of all his ancestors. while he dedicated to him a massive gate-tower of hard stone in
front of the prnteetingta11 of this splendid dwelling of the gods, a colnnnade round it of hard stone as a lasting work, many sacrificial vessels
ond utensils of silver and brass, stands, aims, a bronze ealdron, brasiers, dishes, and censers. Thereupon the king unused this stele to be
prepared and placed in this temple in the place where (stands) the statue
of the great Horus, the king, and he caused to he graven on it the
mighty name of Amenhotep ll. in the house of'his divine fathers, after
he returned from the land of T'pper Syria, where he10verthrew all his
adversaries, in order to widen the boundaries of Egypt on his first
campaign.

Still more remarkable is the narrative at the end of this inwription:

'The king had returned home, with his heart full of gratitude to his
father Ammon. With his own band he had struck down with his club
seven kings, who were in the region of the land of Takt 5. They lay
pittinned en the fore-deek of the royal ship, the name of which was'Ship
nt Arnenhotep II maintainer of the land'. Six of these enemies were
hanged on the walls of Thebes, and their han the same. The remaining
enemy was carried up the stream to Nubia, and hanged on the walls of
the town of anata. in order to make the victory of the king manifest
for ever among all the tribes of the land of the negroes, since he has
taken possession of the tribes of the S., and tamed the tribes of the N,
even to the ends of the whole earth, upon which the sun shines, without
tiniling any opposition, according to the command of his father AmmonRa, lord of the throne of both lands. Such things has Ring Amenhntep II. done'. From Brugsth, History of Egypt, pp. 390, 391.

Those who ascend to the roof of the temple will find a memorial
of Herodotus, the'father of history". not, however, inscribed by
himself, for he himself informs us fu.29) that he came no farther
than Elephantine. The worn aspect of the letters indicates that the
inscription (as follows) is of considerable antiquity.
