The mountains of the E. bank now recede, and the foot-hills of the
Libyan Phain approaeh the river, on the banks of whiell grow several
fine groups of sycamores. The minarcts ofAssi0t now come into
sight, and numerous dredgers are seen at work in the canals. We
land at el-ll-tli, the palm-enclosed harbour of Assi0t, with its
steamers and other boats.

Passengers by railway reach maxim in the evening after dark, as the
train is not due till [ 3.30 p.111. and is generally late. Those who do not
wish to spend a day here, in order to see the town and the neighbouring
tombs (p. 32), should at once trancfer themselves and their luggage to
the steamer (dragoman of the steamboat agents at the station). The path
to eHfamrah (see above), a walk of about 20 min. (donkeys for hire), leads
along the railway lynch and, as it is not lighted, a man should precede
the party with a lantern. The train, however, often runs right down to
the harbour. On reaching the steamer the traveller should at once make
sure that all his baggage has been brought aboard.

Plotimls, the greatest of the Neo-Platonic philosophers (205-270 A. D.),
was horn here in the beginning of the am can' and his system was not
unintlueuced by the priestly doctrines of hi: native town. From the beginning of the Ath Mutt. onwards Christianity was dominant in the town
and neighbourhood. Pious believers took refuge in the caves of the
necropnlis to live a life of penitence apart from the world. One of these,
John of' Lycopolis, at the end of the 4th cent., bore the reputation of a
