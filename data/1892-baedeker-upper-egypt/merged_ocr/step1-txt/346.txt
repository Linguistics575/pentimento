reaping. Good representations of Egyptian donkeys. From the
point where the two tombs touch, another passage leads to a
mummy-shaft, at the back of which is a square chamber.
Climbing up to the right from this double tomb we find several
other tombs, most of which have no inscriptions. One belongs to

TA©I Heli-ah, son of Apt and of Penatmai. A four-line ln

be the sepulehre of his son (l?) Si Renput (son of Satihotep ], whose
portrait is of frequent occurrence in this tomb and who is named
commander of the light troops in the S. frontier districts, Beyond
a narrow passage follows a hall with 6 square columns, and then
another passage with three recesses on each side, the first on the
left containing a bearded figure of Osiris. At the end of the second
passage is a small chamber with four columns, whence a long
passage leads to the right to a qlfadruple shaft.

Farther on, at the top of another ascent, is a tomb, named after
the Prince of Naples who was present at it, opening, and belonging to Baikhenu, a priest at the pyramid of Pepi H, (p.269). Then
the large sepnlehres of khurtes and Semnes. Finally on the N. side
of the same hill is the interesting tomb (No. 32) of another Si
Renput (son of Tend), who served under Usertesen L, and was
grandfather or great-grandfather of the above-named Si Renput
through his daughter Sutihotcp. To the right and left of' the ell-.
trance are some half-defaced inscriptions. The anteehamber has
seven pillars, on one of which (to the right) reference is made to
a campaign undertaken by the king for the subjection of a hostile
tribe (Kat?) Another important inscription (unfortunately damaged), over the entrance to the rock-tomb proper, treats of the
influential position enjoyed by Si Renput under the king and in
the campaign against Kush (Ethiopia). To the left scenes of fishspearing and fowling, and cattle. In the interior are a small tetrastyle hall, a long passage, and then another tetrastyle hall, at the
back of which is a recess. We may descend direct from this tomb
to the bank of the river.

Among the other points to be visited hence are Elephantine,
the small Temple of the Ptolemies, the old Cemeteries, and the (? uar-ries on the way to Philm.
