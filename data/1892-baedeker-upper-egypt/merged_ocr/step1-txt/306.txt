232 Route 22. ESNEH. From Thebes

either near the former Mucliriyeh (now removed to Keneh), beside
which are some ancient riparian constructions dating from the Roman imperial times, or near the post-office, a little to the N., where
the steamers lie. The chief object of interest is the Temple; and if
time permit the garden of the Khedive to the N. of the town (p. 985)
and the old Coptic church (p. 935) may also be visited. The former
lies 10-15 min. from the landing-place (see above), and is reached
by passing through part of the town. The old temple-site is at present met ] by the Excise Office for storing the grain, beans, and
other tribute paid in kind, but travellers will have no difficulty in
inducing one of the by-standers to fetch the keeper who will unlock
the door. Cards empowering a visit to the antiquities must not be
forgotten (see p. xiv).

The so-called Temple is in reality only a Harpostyle, which evidently
from its size must have belonged to an unusually large sanctuary. The
ground-level of the town has been raised by accumulations of rubbish ete.
to the height of the capitals of the columns, so that travellers descend
by steps into the interior of the building. Above the rest of the temple
now pass streets, the removal of which would probably bring to the light
of day many monuments of antiquity. The savants of the French Expedition were profoundly impressed by the sight of this huge colonnaded
hall; and as the traveller standing in front of the steps leading to it,
gazes down into the mysterious twilight of the ancient sanctuary, he cannot but be struck by the air of solemnity that pervades it.

The remarkable"" Ryposty1e of Esneh is built throughout of
excellent sandstone, and remains in perfect preservation with the
exception of the lower part of the rear wall, whivh has been somewhat corroded by the saline exudations of the soil. The noble hall
is kept clean by government. The roof is borne by 24 columns
(in G rows), the tint six of which are connected by balustrades; and
a dim light penetrates to the remotest corner of the hall between
the rolumns. The faqsde is 120 ft. wide and almost 50 ft. high; the
rectangular hall is 52151 }. deep and 108 ft. broad. Each column
is 37 ft. high and 173 In. in chcurnferenee. The interrolurnniation is 11'2 times the diameter of the columns, except in the
central passage, where it is nearly 3 times the diameter. Upon the
somewhat lofty ebaci of the rolumns rests a massive architrave,
which supports roofing-slabs,'21-20t't. long and 61/2 ft. wide. It has
been calculated that about 110,000 cubic feet of sandstone have
been used for this one hall alone. The enormous wall-space, the
entire ceiling, the shafts, the antes (on the facade), and the arehitrave are covered to the last inch with inscriptions. Though these
last fall short of the dignity of style which claims admiration in the
earlier works of Egyptian art. yet they display that remarkable care
in the representation of details and that elaborate variety of form
whirl ] at once distinguishes the inscriptions of the time of the
Ptolemies and of the Romans, and renders their interpretation more
diftieult.

The temple of Esneh was founded not later than the 18th Dyn.
under Tutmes 111., according to one of the inscriptions; and prob
