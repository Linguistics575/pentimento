186 Route M. THEBES. West Bank:

line inscriptions which meet in the middle, dating from the time of Tutr
Ines 111. In front of the second door occurs a mention of the restoration
of the building by Horemheb (18th Dyn.); within the cella Seti I. is
named as a restorer; and in another place the second year of Merenptah I.
is mentioned. The name of Ramses III. also occurs in the rooms behind.
Inside the calm we should note the tree on which the god Amman is
writing the name of Seti I. In the adjoining building on the N., the roof
of which includes remains of the old building of Ramses 11., not only is
the priest-king Pinozem, son of Piankhi, of the let Dyn. represented, but
also Hat 0115 or the 29th Dynasty. Ptolemy Euergetes 11. occurs in the
upper inscription running round the cella.

The building, though small, is distinguished by its harmonious
forms. About [ 35 paces to the NE is the well-known Fresh Water
Spring, a pool to "hid:, subterranean passage leads. It is a remarkable fact that the freshness of the water remains entirely 1111affected by the saline exudations from the ground, even in the necropolis at Thebes.

To the S. of the temples of Medinet Habu are traces of a Sacred
Luke of considerable extent, formerly taken for a hippodrome. At
its N.W. angle is a small temple, now known as Kugr el-'Ayfts,
erected by Ptolemy Euergetes II. to his ancestors. It consists of
a wide vestibule and three rooms, One behind another. Still farther
to the S., at the S.W. angle of the former lake, stood a small sanetuary dating from the Roman period. It was erected by Hadrian
and Antoninus Pius, while the ruined pylon bears the names of
Vespasian, Domitian, and Otho, the last of exceedingly rare occurrence owing to the emperor's short reign (69 AIL). The temple
consists of a Belle surrounded by apartments. A staircase leads to
the root" from a space to the extreme left of the entrance. The inscriptions announce that the sanctuary no longer belongs to the
Diospolitan district, but to the district of llermonthis; and it was
specially dedicated to the Isis of the W. mountain of Hermonthis.
- Grebaut discovered in 1880 in the vicinity the remains of a Palace of Amenhotep III. and his consort Tii.

16, Tombs of the Queens.

The Tombs of the Queens are in every way less important than those
of the Kings in Bibin er3luMk, which should in any case be seen; and
a visit to the former, for which at least 11/4 hr. is necessary, renders it
almost impossible to complete the lint day's programme on the West
Bank. Those who, however, decide to visit them should proceed thither
direct from Medinet Habu, and visit Der el-Nedtneh on the way back.
From Medinet Habu to the Tombs 1/2 hr.

The road from Medinet-lIabu to the Tombs of the Queens crosses
the desert to the W., and passes through a mountain valley with
bare and lofty sides of limestone, picturesquely formed and carved
with inscriptions of various lengths. The latter contain prayers to
the gods of the regions of the dead, and date from the 19th and
20th Dynasties. The Tombs of the Queens belong to the same
period, except a few which are of the 18th Dynasty. Altogether
