m Philae. FIRST CATAPSAOT. 28. Route. 270

the same,'a, pecially when one behold, the placid surface of the
river to the s. ot'Philie, one can sympathize with the question of
the liuen-elarl Aehoreus in Luann: Who would have supposed that
thou, Oh gently-flowing Nile, wouldst burst forth with violent
whirlpools into such wild rage?' When the river is high all the
rocks in the bed of the stream are under water; but in February
and March even the smaller rocks are visible: Inscriptions are found
on many of these, and on all the cataract-islands, twenty in number.
The smooth glaze, like a dark enamel, which covers the graniteIocks between this point and Phila, will not escape notice.

A similar effect was noticed by Alexander von Humboldt at the
cataracts of the Orinoco.'The granite hf min', says R. Hartmann,
'like that at the southern cataracts, etc., is distinguished by the remarkably rounded shape nf the blocks. These have surfaces as smooth as
glass, and are of a black hue, glistening in the sun, like the flat surface
of a well-used smoothing-iron. The almost spherical shape seems to be
due to the attrition of the detritus washed down by the stream. The
dark colour, which only penetrates a few lines, as is easily seen in detached fragments, is caused by protoxide of iron according to Russegger,
or by silica according to Delesse, precipitated on the stone by the Xiler
water

A few yards to the S. of the cataract lie the pleasant villages
of Mahadah and Shelli ], shaded by palms and sycamores. In Mah√©dah huge piles of dried dates lie in the open air, brought hither
from Nubia for transport to Egypt. At this point begins the passage
of the rapids downstream; and boats (or dhahabiyehs for large parties) may be hired here, if desired, for the safe voyage to Phila,
through a picturesque rocky landscape A bargain should be struck
before the boat is entered. A small boat costs 10 piastres by tariff;
a dhahabiyeh not less than 10 fr. The boatmen demand much larger
sums at first.

DESCEST OF TUE CATARACT IN A SMALL BOAT. This expedition can
hardly be recommended, for even when the river is full it is not unattended with danger. H. Brugsch and Ehers both accomplished it. The
latter records that be looks back upon the experience not without pleasure,
especially on account of the extraordinary skill and presence of mind of
the cataract-re'is who steered. He describes the trip as follows q had
two of our own sailors on board, one able-bodied, the other a Nubian
little more than a boy. The old cataractvrc'is was at the helm. The
roar, of the cataract was heard beyond the village of shellM, and became
louder every minute as we proceeded. The rocks and stones in the riverbed are reddish brown, but wherever they have been washed by the
stream and then dried by the scorching sun of this latitude, they glisten
like the black surface of an evaporating pond. Behind and hefore, to
the right and left, above and below, I saw nothing but rocks, little pools,
and the blue sky; while my sense of hearing was as though spell-bnund by
the roar of the waters, which as soon as the keel of the heat approached
the rapids proper, lifted up their voice as loud as surf lashing against a
rocky coast in a storm. Then followed some minutes of the most intense
exertion for the crew, who cheered and encouraged themselves by enntinual invocations to helpful saints, especially to the holy Said, the
reseller from sudden dangers. With each stroke of the ears broke forth
a'ya Said' (0 Said) or'ya Nnhafmrned' or'God is gracious'; while the
arms wielding the oars dared not relax their strength, at it was essential
to keep in the middle of the rapids in order to avoid being hurled against
the rocks. The Arab, who guided the hunt. was a sinewy old man Over
