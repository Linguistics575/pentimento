portion of the Ramesseum are in a very ruinous condition, but their
arrangement may be partly made out.

Behind the, Ramesseum, especially towards the NAN, are the remains
of a number of extensive Brick Buildings, some of which were erected in
the time of Billings H. as we learn from the stamps on the bricks. Among
the rest are some wel cunstructcd vaults. As the tomb of Ramses II
has been discovered at Bibiin eroIuliiri (p. 2071, there can be no question
of his grave being here. On the other hand "we, learn from the papyrusrolls that a celebrated university and a seminary for scholars, comparable
to the Museum at Alexandria, were connected with the Ilamesseum, and
stood at the zenith of their prosperity under Ramses and his son 3lerenptah. The light-eoioured soil, strewn with fragments of bricks and tiles,
between the Ramesseum and Shékh'Abd el-Iiurnah, covers a multitude of
graves, whose existence is undreamed of by those who walk over them.
One of these, belonging to a certain Mum contains some interesting representations, the style of which indicates (for no king is named) that it
dates probably from the early empire, and is certainly not later than the
beginning of the 18th Dynasty. We may therefore conclude that Ramses ll.
built his votive, Memnonium on'.an ancient portion of the Theban necropolis.

About 500 pace: to the N. of the Memnonium we observe the
remains of an extensive wall built' of Nile bricks. The name of
Tahnes 111. found here on many tiles renders it probable that a
temple built by this king or dedicated to him stood on this site.

14. The Tombs of 1iurnet-N11rrai.

Travellers who are not pressed for time should visit one of the
tombs of Jiurnet-Murra'i (sir, that of Hui), on the way to MedinetIIabu. On reaching the fields of W. Thebes, if we look towards the
Libyan mountains, our eye falls upon numerous tvin-entrances.
The vaults of the Diospolites of the zenith of the ancient empire
are hewn in the limestone hills that bound the plain of Thehes to the
W. They have recently been classified in groups, bearing the names
of the fellM.1-villages in whose domain they lie. The tombs on the
slopes behind the Ramesseum are called those of Shékh'Abd elIiurnah. Following thence the undulating desert region at the foot of
the Libyan hills in a S.W. direction towards Medinet Habu, we
soon pass, on the right, the gorge of Thir el-Medineh, and then
direct our way towards the mountain-slope, projecting between the
Ramesseum and Medinet Habit. This slope, on which stand some
felleh huts is known to the guides as Kurnet Murra'i. Several of
the tombs here date from the 18th Dye, but the majority are of no
interest to the ordinary traveller. Only one, to which the guides
conduct travellers at once, is of exceptional interest (though recently
much injured), on account partly of the subject and partly of the
vivid colours of the representations it contains. Near the village
(the dogs of which are cross-grained though cowardly) is a tomb
partly converted into a stable by the felléhin. In the adjoining
tomb of JIora-lfhemti are some hieroglyphies, of interest only to
the scientific traveller .--Then follows the finest tomb in the necro, p0 ] is, belonging to a certain Hui, who held the high ra11kofapriuee
