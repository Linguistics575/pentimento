mentioned figures have been supposed to be Castor and Pollux, or two
Roman emperors, but they rather resemble horses brought as tribute, like
the groups in the pediment of the Stele of Piankhi. Farther to the S.
is a colossal image, carved out of the rock, of Ramses III. sacrificing to
the god Sebeki The inscriptions in the very ancient group of tombs to
the S. are in such bad preservation that their date can only be guessed
at from their general style.

Minyeh Ciuinyet-ibn-keaetb; rail. stat., p. 1), on the W. bank,
a well-built and handsome town with 15,900 inhab, is the seat of
the mudir of a district containing 281 villages and 315,000 inhabitants. There is a telegraph-offiee at the railway-station, and adjacent is the post-office, the director of which speaks Italian. At the
hospital is a physician who has studied in Europe. The town possesses two hotels and a large and curiously painted Arab cafe, in
which ghawtzi sing in the evening. Parts of the street running
along the river are planted with trees, and in the stream many
steamers and dhahabiyehs lie at anchor. The bazaars and the
Greek bakkals' (small dealers) possess large stocks of goods. In the
Bazaar street is an Austrian watchmaker and clothier, and among
the houses on the river is an Italian tailor. The palace of the mudir
is a plain and lightly-built structure. The large sugar-factory is
the oldest in Egypt, and a visit to it during the sugar-harvest is of
great interest; most of the officials are French and very obliging.
Market-day in Minyeh presents a very gay and characteristic picture
of Oriental life. There are no public buildings or monuments of
any interest, but the houses of the richer merchant, in spite of their
plain exterior, are often fitted up with great comfort. A glance
into one of their courts will show what a rich and varied life exists
in the interior of houses which from the outside look like miserable huts.

It is uncertain what place of the Pharaohs' time Miuyeh represents;
but the assertion of Leo Africanus that it was founded by the Arabs may
well be doubted. Among the facts which render it improbable are the
old masonry on the river (towards the so, the ancient architectural fragments immured in one of the mosques, a Coptic inscription, and the very
name of the town, which is derived, not from the Arabic, but from the
old-Egyptian dialect. Its Coptic name is AtooftH (Moone) and this, as
Brugsch has demonstrated, is derived from the old-Egyptian Mena-t. This
name, however (in full Mena-t Khufu,'nurse of CheopsO, belonged to a
place which lay nearly opposite to the present Blinyeh, on a site still
marked by a few remains. At a later date Menart was probably transferred, under the name of Minyeh, from the right bank of the Nile to the
left, where, presumably, some of the inhabitants had previously settled.
To this day the inhabitants of Minyeh maintain a close connection with
