the wall to the right, shows the king (Ergamencs) pouring out wine
I: __
for a god described as Tir-iia of Senem. In another the king
QC

appears before Imhotep, son ot'Ptah, kherheb and overseer of the
royal writings.

A small door in the E. (left) wall admits to a richly decorated
Cell (Pl. E). Two lions depicted on the back-wall recall the Gate
of the Lions at Mycerrm. Above them is an allegorical composition:
Thoth in the figure of a baboon stands before a lion (Tefnut), above
which is the sun-disc and a vulture with a curved sword: this is
Te/hut, daughter of Ha on the holy island (of Philae). Another
door on the right of the sanctuary leads to the staircase (P1. F) ascending to the roof of the temple. - The innermost room (Pl. D),
named the'Roman sanctnary' by Champollion, was entirely built



by the emperor designated Em Pir a, and contains

scenes of worship to the same gods as appear in the preceding
chambers. One of the scenes represents the emperor bestowing
upon the goddess Isis a headdress decorated with the 11athor-mask.

Of the Outside Walls only the W. wall is adorned. Above the
door to the outside was placed a four-line hieroglyphic inscription,
with a demotic inscription below. The former is said to read: Way
his name remain before Thoth of Penubs, the great god, the lord of
the town of scorpions (P-selk), before Tefnnt, before the great gods
of the temple of the house of Scorpions'. Prof. Eisenlohr was unable
to discover this inscription in 1890.

On the E. bank, nearly opposite Dakkeh, lies the village of
1iubbirn, on the site of Contra Pselchis, mentioned in the Itinerarium
Antonini as 34 Roman M. (22 Eng. M.) from Contra Talmis (tialabsheh), though in reality it is 32 Eng. M. The ruins here are those
of an ancient Egyptian fortress, defended by ditches and towers.
To the S. are blocks with the names ofTutmes m., Horus, RamsesII.,
and later Ramet ides; and still farther to the s., a stele of Amenemha III. and the foundations of a small temple. Prisse d'Avennes
discovered here the well-known stele describing the route to the
gold-mines in the Writli "thlki and the method of supplying these
with water. This stele, dating from the 3rd year of Ramses 11.,
which was taken by Count St. Ferric ] to his chateau at Uriage,
prompted Chabas to the composition of his interesting treatise on
'Les Inscriptions des Mines d'Or' (Chalon, 1862). The numerous
gold-mines, worked until the Middle Ages, were reached by a route
a little above littbbin leading through the extensive Widi 1) lilii.
Granite mortars and mills and other articles used in the search for
gold are still to be seen, especially in tho Wadi Khawanib. Diodorus (111. 12-11) gives a detailed account ofthe working of the
metal by convicts.
