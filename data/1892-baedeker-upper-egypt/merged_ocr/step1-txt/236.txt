166 Route 13. THERES. West Bank:

distinguished for the beautiful modelling of the kings horses dashing into the fight, and for the representation of the Asiatic fortress
of Tapura, which is stormed by the Egyptians on scaling-ladders,
while the defenders are hurled headlong from the battlements. Several sons of the Pharaoh, the names of whom are given, distinguish
themselves in the battle. Two of these (towards the left) me depicted on a larger scale than the others, viz.liha-em-us, the favourite son of Ramses, end Mouth, prince of the blood, each of whom
is in the act of slaying, an enemy. The younger princes, Meri-Amen,
Amen-em-ua, Seti, and Setep-en-Ra, covered with their shields,
take part in the attack (below the fortress). Diodorus apparently
had this scene in his mind when he described the Egyptian army as
commanded by the sons of the king.

The reliefs at the side of and above the portal (adorned with
the concave cornice) in the Rear Wall are in good preservation.
Each pillar is divided into four fields in the first (top) fields the
king is shown offering to Solrar-0siris (on the left) and to Ptah Con
the right); in both the second fields, he offers sacrifice to Amman
Generator; and in the third to Ammon-Ita as king of the gods (left)
and to the same god as lord of heaven fright). From the fourth
fields we learn the use to which the following rooms were put; on
the left is enthroned the ibis-headed Thoth-Hermes, god of wisdom
and of writings; on the right (opposite) is Safekh, goddess of history

mother Sefekh, the great mistress of 1sooli-wliting'. At the foot is
the dedicatory inscription, informing us that the king erected this
palatial building to his father Amman, king of the gods and lord
of heaven, prince of Thebes. ._ On each side of the door is a procession of youthful forms, with the lock of hair hanging to the side,
peculiar to the royal children. Their left hands are raised, and their

right hands hold the herdsman's crook, the symbol of princely

dignity, and the fan, the symbol of court-rank. The list to the

right is the more complete; but at the end of the procession on the
left two princesses appear, who are wanting in the other. Over the
first tigaros bat applying equally to the others appear the full titles
of Egyptian royal princes. The first is as follows:'The fan-bearer
at the right hand of the king, the prince and royal scribe, the leader
of the army, the great (uf) son of the king, the first-born of his
body, his beloved Amen-ti-kilt". While this son is named the
(great) son of the king, the next one, Ramessn, is called the (great)
son of the lord of both worlds. The third prince, JU-hi-mme)

Fourth comes the king's favourite son, Iiha-enr-usfsee above), whose
