fellow-men, was expelled by his wicked brother, and when he departed
towards the N., all the inhabitants of Ombo went with him as his companions, leaving the town by night. It was then the season for sowing.
When the wicked prince awake, his vizier said to him,'All thy subjects
have left the country along with thy brother; who will now plough the
fields?' The wicked prince was very angry when he beard that; hut as
he was a great magician he said,'Then the dead must help me'. So he
summoned the dead from their graves; and in the morning he heheld from
his castle (the temple) the dead at work, ploughing and sowing. But
when the harvest came, not a blade grew in the fields, for the dead had
carried the ploughs in the air above the earth, and had sowed sand instead of grain. Then the wicked prince once more was angry and descended from his castle to convince himself with his own m of the
failure of the harvest. When he saw not only that no blade of corn grew
green, hut also that the former fields were new covered with sand, be
uttered a terrible curse, so fearful that his castle fell to the earth, and a
block of stone crushed him to death'.

The temple of Ktun Ombo is a Double Temple, and it is the
only one in Egypt that is divided along its longer axis into two distinctly def1ned parts. Even the entrance has two portals. In the interior
the various chambers are not approached as usual by one door each;
everywhere two doorwa ye are seen, separated by broad pillars each of
which is a point in the imaginary line ir1dieatiugthe division between
the two portions of the temple. The plan of the whole may he made
out with perfect certainty, though many of the rooms, especially
those towards the rear, are largely sanded up. The temple moreover
contained two sanctuaries, a fact which is scarcely surprising after
what has been said of the two chief deities, Arneris and Sebek.

The Hypostyle Pronaos. - The Double Portal of the main
temple consists of two doors, framed by three columns and each
displaying a concave cornice and a winged sun-disc. The floor of
the hypostyle is encumbered with sand. Thirteen columns are still
standing, each of which measures no less than 20 ft. round the
middle of the shaft. The two corner columns in front are apparently
wanting; there were in all three rows of five or perhaps three rows
of seven. The capitals, of great variety of form, belong to the
Ptolemaie-Egyptian order; but they differ in various points from
those to be seen atDenderah, Esneh, and Edfu. The middle column
in the hack row has a ealyX-eapital, with a foliage-cup displaying
a unique ornamentation, with three flowers and three buds springing from it. The unfinished Calyx-capital of the most northerly
column in the same (rear) row has, at its base, a wreath of flowers
with serrated edges, between which are arranged pairs of buds, each
pair surmounted by a six-pointed star, though elsewhere the Egyptian star is always five-pointed A.

This hypostyle was built by Ptolemy XIII. Nees Dionysus and
his wife Cleopatra T., whose surname Tryphaena is of frequent oocurrence among the Ptolemies. The name of the builder
