negro-tribes, from the lands of Arth, Mesa, Amam, Warm, and
Kaau, as we learn from the inscription of Una (now in the museum
at Gizeh). The Woman especially are often mentioned in the inscriptions as having been fought against and subdued by the Egyptians. - The powerful monarchs of the 12th Dyn. continued the
conquest of the S. Amenemha defeated the Wawa; and a son of
Usertesen 1., as a stele now in Florence records, overthrew seven
negro-tribes. Usertesen IH. advanced the boundary of Egypt to
Semneh; and we hear of a campaign directed against Rush in the
19th year of this king. His successor Amenemha III. recorded at
Semneh and at Kummeh, lying opposite. the height of the Nile,
which was then 25 ft. higher (p. 272) than at present. A king of

the 13th Dyn., (o C? (i Ra kha nefer, is mentioned on the is
land of Argo. The kings of the 18th Dyn., however, did most of
all to extend the Egyptian might in Upper Nubia. Amenhotep III.
led a prosperous expedition into the land of Abhet and took many
prisoners. He built a large temple at Napalm. near the fourth
cataract, and adorned the temple of Tutmes Ill. at Soleb. Both
there and on a statue of this king in the Louvre are recorded the
names of many conquered tribes of the S The Egyptian governors
of these provinces now received the title of princes of Rush. The
victorious campaign of Ramses 11. against the Ethiopians, and the
tribute paid by them in ebony, gold, and ivory, are not only de-.

and in numerous tombs at Iiurnal1 are depicted negroes as prisoners
and paying tribute. While Egypt was embroiled in internal discards. an independent priestly monarchy established itself at Napata beside the holy mountain (G'ebel Barkul), where Amman,
Muth, and Khunsu, the triad of Thebes, were worshipped. Numerous buildings were reared of which traces remain to the present
day. We are unfortunately not yet able to decipher either the
peculiar hieroglyphics or the demotic writing of the Kushites, found
side by side with Egyptian hieroglyphic: on these monuments.
Some important steles brought by Mariette from Gebel Barkal record
the victorious advance of the Ethiopian prince Piankhi into Lower
Egypt, his defeat of several local kings (Tafnekht, Nimrod, 0:01-kon, etc.) probably set up by the Assyrians, and his capture of the
city of Memphis. Shabako and Taharka, the successors of Piankhi,
repeated his exploits, to the extent at least of making themselves
masters of Upper Egypt. They founded the 25th Dyn., and in that
way united the whole of Nubia with Egypt proper. Taharka, however, was defeated by the Assyrian kings Esarhnddon and Anmbanipat fScrdoruHrisuts/, though after his death his sister's son Urdamani (Nat-Amen) maintained himself for some time in Thebes
and even besieged Memphis. An end was put to the independence
