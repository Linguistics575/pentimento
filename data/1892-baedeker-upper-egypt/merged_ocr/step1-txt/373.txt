the staircase admits us, and secondly that to the right of the large
doorway. Both are without windows. Inscriptions on the doorposts inform us of the purpose of these rooms. The first (PL I) was
the Laboratory, in which was prepared the excellent incense known
as Kyphi, which must have been used in great quantities for the
services of the gods. The name; and the proportionate quantities
(in figures) of the drugs used in its preparation are recorded on the
door-posts. The interior has no inscriptions. The other (entered
by the fourth door from the pylon) is, on the other hand, very rich
in inscriptions. This small room, extremely elegantly adorned
with sculptures by the orders of Tiberius (here named'Autokrator
Eisres0, was the Library (PL h); and on the right door-post is the

legend:'This is the library-room of the gracious Sail l I

fekh, goddess of history, the room for preserving the writings of the

life-bestowing Isis,.

The representations over the door must have been specially objectionable to the Christians, for they have all been carefully chiselled out. On
the left side of the chamber itself is a recess like a wa11-euphoard. in
which perhaps the most precious rolls were preserved. Beneath is a lifelike relief of a cynocephalus (the sacred animal ofThoth-Hermes) writing
a papyrus-scroll. Here as usual the Pharaoh (Tiberius) is depicted receiving
the blessings of life in symbols from the deities upon whom he had hestowed gifts; on the right wall he appears before Isis and Horns, on the
hack-wall before Irish Between the emperor and the goddess in the latter
scene stands an altar, beneath which are two swine, as the sacrificial
animals. On the left wa.ll, over the trhove-mentioned recess, are the sacred
ibis of Thoth, Ma, the goddess of truth with the palette and the chisel in
her hand, Tefuntl and Safekh; on the door-wall is Khunsu, here named
the'sacred ihis of Philat' and thus placed entirely on an equality with
Thoth. On the right wall, opposite, is the cow-headed Best, mother or the
gods, with two vessels with handles, before Osiris, Isis, and Horus.

The next door to the left, higher than the others. leads into a room
(Pl. g), named'Chambre de Tib'ere" by Champollion, because Tiberius is represented sacrificing to the gods on both the side-walls

and over the door, on the outside, while in the secoudrow on the right

_. AS > rhe appears again before the Nubian god q Arhesnefer.

Above are dedicatory inscriptions by Euergetes If. and Cleopatra
his wife, who appear on the door entering from the colonnade.

Returning once more to the colonnade, we find another door at
its N. end (PL n). Here, an inscription informs us, stood the
door-keepers entrusted with the purification of those entering the
temple. The lions on the outside wall were also named in an inscription'temple-guards', though symbolically only. - Outside the
temple M., in the direction of Bigeh, a Nitorneter was discovered by
Capt. Handcock in 1856

g. The Second Pylon (Pl. k), standing at an obtuse angle with
the E. colounade, encloses the peristyle rourt on the N. It is
smaller (10511, wide, M) ft. high) and in poorer preservation than
