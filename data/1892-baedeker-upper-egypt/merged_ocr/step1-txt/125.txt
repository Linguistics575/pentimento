where, tun, some stones hearing the cartnuches of Ptolemy Philometor
project from the ground in a clear space. Nothing of interest is to be
seen here except one of the largest and oldest lel-hek-trees in Egypt.
The extensive cemetery contains numerous Cutie inscriptions. Hieroglyphic inscriptions have been found in gmttoes in a hill to the w. of
the town.

Furr ey-5riyiid (mail steamer station) marks the site of the an
cient Chenoboskion, which is mentioned by Ptolemy, by Stephanus
of Byzantium, and in the Itinerary of Ant nine, and belonged to
the Nomos Panopolitcs. No remains are visible except a few fragments ofthe riverwall, withan unimportant Greek inscription of the
Human period. It owes its name, meaning'geese pasture' (N-tpo-f3oro-zeirw, Copt. gcnccwx, from the ancient Egyptian Geese take),
to the fact that immense quantities of geese, a favourite food and
sacrificial offering of the old Egyptians, were reared here. Its proyinquity to the home of Grenes Cvhis-Nsyrios) makes it seem quite
natural that graves of heat antiquity [ 6th Dynasty) should be found
in the neighbourhood. These are reached from the village of Kagr
ca-Sniyéd in about 11hhr. Donkeys, but no saddles, may be obtaiuetl, through the Shékh ei-Beled. We first ride through a well-.
tilled district, cross a bridge over a canal which waters the district,
pass the village of Isbuh, and reach the Arab hills. The ancient
tombs, constructed orr1ght-eoloured and unusually fine-grained
limestone, now come in sight; they date from the reigns of Pepi,
Morin), and L'aneferlra, all of the 0th Dynasty. The large tomb
situated farthest to the left contains representations and inscriptions
which are identical in style with those in the most ancient part of
the Necropolis ofMemphis. The ceiling wasleftrougl1-hewm Some
"the smelt inscriptions cut in the living rock near the entrance
are in Coptic The representations on the inside of the entrancewall have been almost wholly destroyed, but some ships may be
distinguished to the right of the door. On the right wall are figures
bearing funereal gifts and a large sacrificial table. The rear-wall
is divided into two distinct portions, as the left side of the tomb
has been pushed much farther into the rock than the right. In the
latter are two niches. That to the right contains an image of the
deceased, one of the chief dignitaries under the Pharaoh llaneferka,

natmd Zulu (=. From the second niche, farther

to the left, a mummy-shaft descends obliquely; adjacent is a Coptie, inscription. In the deeply recessed rear-wall of the left side
are four smaller niches, probably intended for the coffins ofmemhers
of Zuta's household deemed worthy of special honour. - The next
tomb, farther to the right, is of even greater interest than the one
just described. It belonged to an official warned Atkhenu, who lived
in the reigns of Pepi, Morin, and ltaneferha, and was not only ell-gaged in the construction ofthe pyramids ofthese monarchs, but was
also adistinguished warrior. The pyramidswere muuerthsoi1Plaeo',
