The name Sun means'the place affording an opening or chief town of the
name to which Sun belonged, was Etephantine, on the island of that
name. The place, however, is very ancient, for even under the 6th Dym,
the granite required by the builders of Lower Egypt was furnished by the
quarries in its neighbourhood. In later times the city of the cataracts
was frequently referred to by Greek and human writers under the name
of Syene. 1t acquired special fame on account of Its well'tsee below),
and as the place of banishment ot' Juvenal in his old age.

The Well of Syerw, in which there was no shadow at midday, and which
thus seemed to prove that 5, that Syene was situated under the tropic, has disappeared. The veporthdits existence led the learned Athenian Eratoslhenes (276199110), attached to the Museum at Alexandria, to the discovery of the
method of measuring the size of the earth that is still employed.'lle
selected the are of the earth between Alexandria and Syene (Assuiin) an
the Nile, of which place he'assumed that it was in the same meridian.
Since he knew that the midday sun at the summer solstice cast no shadow
within a radius of 300 stadia from Syene, and that in Alexandria at the
same time the angle determined by the shadow of the sun-gn0mon was
equal to one-fiftieth of a circle, he correctly concluded that the distance
between Alexandria and Syene must equal the fiftieth part of a meridian
circle, Ur 7° 12'.+ The distance from Alexandria to Syene was taken hy
Eratosthenes simply at the popular estimate of 5300 stadia, equal to
593 M. (Lepsius) or 518 M. (Hultsch). Paschal. - A glance at the map
shows that Assuan no longer has under the tropic of Cancer. but somewhat
to the N. of it, so that no shadowtess well can exist there at present;
but it has been calculated that in the 4th cent. B.C. Syene actually my
exactly under the tropic, whence we may gather that the Egyptians must
have n diced the shadowless well long before Eratosthenes and must have
known the true situation of the tropic.

Jurenat was still living under Hadrian; but it is not quite certain
whether, as is usually assumed, he was sent to Egypt by Domitian. The
rhetorician and satirist, while living in Rome, had fiercely attacked the
actnr Paris, who was a court-favourite, and he was on that account removed
from the capital. He was not exactly banished but appointed prefect of
the garrison at Syene, on the most remote frontier of the empire. His
trenrhant muse found abundant material on the banks of the Nile. His
15th Satire describes the contest between the inhabitants of Ombos and
Tentyra { Denderah) at a festival at Eoptos. The two hostile Domes, whom
he erroneously calls neighbours ('vieinos0, had long cherished a mutual
enmity on account of the gods they worshipped. At Teutyra the crocodile
was persecuted, while it was held sacred at Tentyra for the sake of Sehek
who was worshipped there. Thus arrse a strife resembling that mentioned
un p.7. The Tentyritians even slew a man of names and devoured him.
Juvenat is indignant, and indicates that his residence on the Nile had by
no means taught him to love the Egyptians. If he { composed the 15th
saline at Syene, that iown has the honour of being the birth-place of the
following fine verses:
'That nature gave the noble man a Feeling heart'
'elf, by giving him tears!'

'This is the noblest part of all human nature'.
The 16th Satire, in which Egypt is again mentioned, seems to be erroneously ascribed to Juvenal. Doubts also attach to the authenticity of a
frequently quoted edict of the emperor Diocletian, ordering the Uh iaa
