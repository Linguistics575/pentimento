the gonds tranqported hither on camels. or, at an earlier period, on asses,
as is expressly mentioned in the great Harris Papyrus (Ramses Ill.,
1320 B.C.). The desert-route to 1% s.isr unites with that from Feels at e1Karn before Laig√©tah (p. J. Eoptos earl became an emporium for many
kinds of goods. Inscriptions of the 6th i. are found by the side of the old
trade-route to the Red Sea at the Wadi Hausa "( p. 76). In a tomb at
Benihasan belonging to Ameni, a princely official under the 12th Dyn., is
an inscription recording the treasures brought by Ameni to Koptos in
the train of the "own-Primus Usertesen. Koptos was the capital of the
fifth Dome of Upper F, which bore two hawks on its banner. Its

in Coptic it is Ref! and Hem; in Greek Korrcor, K, o zdc, etc. The
Arabic Feft corresponds to the Coptic Kent The deity chiefly worshipped
here from a very early period was Khem Min (Vol. L, p. 138), whose wife
was called Isis, and son Horus. Osiris also had a burial-place here
(Ha nub,'Gold house'), in which a part of his body (called liar) was
preserved. The book of magic, the search for which is narrated in the
demntic romance of Setnau, was sunk in the Nile at Koptos. A medical
leather-roll found at Koptos, and now in the British Museum, is said to
have been written in the reign of Khufu 0r (heaps (tth Dyn J. Jropto
Win mctitied as early as the 12th Dynasty; for the wealthy city and eth
routes leading to it required to be defended against the warlike tribes
who lurked between the Nile and the Arabian mountains, and who, even
under the Roman emperors, were a source of danger. Guards were
especially necessary at this point, for there is no doubt that a considerable
number of Phoenician merchants had settled in Koptos at a very early
date along with the Egyptians, and were engaged in importing the products
of Arabia, and at a later date even those of India, which were conveyed
vii Arabia to the Egyptian Red Sea ports afterwards called Berenike and
Leukos Limen, and thence across the desert to the Nile. The green
breccia, used for many buildings even under the Romans, was quarried
at Iraniimiit, on the desert-route to Koptos. It is even probable that
Keht-town or Keft-tuwe means'place of the Phrenieians', for the Phase
ni ians were named Keft 0r Kaft in Egyptian. Strabo and Pliny expressly
state that the population of the town was mixed, containing both Egyptian
and Arabic (tie, Semitic) elements. The hieroglyphic name of the town







also occurs with theldeterminative-sign of the post, which is only used

after the names of foreign places or of places in which foreigners were
conspicuous. The reports of Plutarch, Elian, etc., concerning the strange
cults at Koptos farther indicate that a considerable Semitic community
dwelt in the town, and was regarded with hostility by their Egyptian
neighbours. ailian's statement that the inhabitants of Koptos worshipped
the crocodile (Seth) and crucified the hawk (Horus) can only refer to these
Semites. The true Egyptians revengcd themselves by throwing an ass
from a rock (as Plntarch narrates), because Typhon (Seth) was red-haired
and of the colour of an ass. ned-haired men (and many red-haired
Semites are represented on the monuments) were despised, and like all
foreigners were stigmatized as'Typlr nie'. Many non-Egyptians are commeumratrd at the sides of the trade-route from the Red Sea to Roptor,
names of Persian kings are nowhere more numerous.

The camp of the Beduins, who hired their camels to the caravans
and escorted them through the desert, must have auciently existed within
the circuit of the town. These Arabs appear to have been the instigutors
of a great insurrection iu Upper Egypt, which broke out under Diocletian
in 292 A.D., and led to the siege and destruction of Iioplos The town
revived Sumewhat under the Khalifs, but t1nally decayed with the gradual
transference of the Egyptian trade to the route from ign r to Feneh.
