chambers, and the fragments of a staircase (to the right). This
building is dedicated to the birth of Horus, with whom the son of
each successive monarch is compared. Similar Birth-Houses (Egypt.
I:
p pa-mes), called by Champollion Mameisi (Copt.,'place of

birth'), occur in many other Egyptian temples (pp. 253, 289, euro.
The eartouehes of Autokrotor Kisres, which Hathor presents to Horus Sam taui, have been supposed to refer to Augustus; but the
fact that the latter had no son makes this very doubtful. The'birthhouse' also contains the names of Trajan and Hadrian, to whom it
probably owes its existence The paintings represent the care of
the young Horus, who is nursed and ministered to by goddesses and
women with rows' heads. - We now proceed to the temple, either
by ascending over the heaps of rubbish, or by returning to the N.
gate and walking thence in a straight direction.

"Temple of Hathor at Denderah.

This interesting and much-admired building was dedicated to
IIathor, the Egyptian Venus. The Portico (PI. E), which is supported by 24 columns, is 139 ft. in breadth. Each of the columns
has a capital formed of four heads of Hathor, with cows' ears,
surmounted by a house, in reference to the meaning of Hathor,
Hat (Le. house) ofHorus. The columns next the entrance show
an open door. The six columns in the front row, three on each
side of the entrance, are united by balustrades. The rubbish round
the temple reaches to the balustrades in front and nearly to the
roof on the E. side; hence the floor of the temple appears sunken
and is reached by a flight of wooden steps. Originally, however,
the temple stood level with the ground, and its present appearance, like that of the temples of Esneh and Edfu, is due to the anenmulated rubbish of centuries. In accordance with the plan of
other temples, a colonnade and a pylon should stand in front ofthis
portieo; but perhaps the means to add these were not forthcoming.
The date of the temple is given by a Greek inscription of three
lines, which runs round the cornice on the exterior of the building
and reads as follows:
