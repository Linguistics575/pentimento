Fayem. LABYRINTH. 9. Route. 39

thus reach the Kalagantuh structure, which consists of a terrace of
six carefully jointed steps of large and well-hewn blocks, but bears
no inscription whatever. We cross the Balrr el- Ward/in, which
now intersects the ruins near the Pyramid of 1Iawttrah, and which
is sometimes called by the Arabs Balm ei-Afelekh or Ruhr ssh-Surly,
i.e. river of the East. On the E. side lies the mass of buildings,
which, according to Lepsius, was probably the Labyrinth (see below). In order to obtain a survey of these interesting ruins the
traveller is recommended to ascend at once the Pyramid of Hawarah. This consists of unburnt bricks ofNile mud mixed with straw
(Vol, L, p. 370), and, when its sides were perfect, covered an area
of upwards of 116 sq. yards. It has been ascertained that the nucleus of the structure is a natural mass of rock, 39 ft. in height. The
dilapidated summit is easily reached in a few minutes by a flight of
well-worn steps. The entrance to the pyramid, on the S. side, was
discovered in 1889 by Mr. Flinders Petrie. The tomb chamber
is 22 ft. long, S ft. wide, and 6 ft. high; it was covered with three
large slabs of stone and contained two sarcophagi, one of them of
polished sandstone without inscription, and fragments of an alabaster vase with the name of Amenemha HI. The chamber was
filled with water to a depth of 3 ft.

Towards the S we observe a congeries of chambers and passages
of nnhurnt bricks, bounded by the Baht esh-Sherlii, and pronounced
by Lepsins to be the right side of the Labyrinth, and the only part
of it which is to some extent preserved. On the other side of the
Pyramid there was doubtless a similar collection of rooms which has
now disappeared; and several other structures beyond them, of which
traces still remain, must have once existed there. The whole Labyrinth must have been in the shape of a horseshoe. Between the wing
of the Labyrinth which still exists, and that which has disappeared,
lies an extensive space strewn with broken pottery, in the middle
of which are large fragments of a magnifieent ancient temple. The
base of the shaft of a small papyrus column, and a capital of the same
order, both in the red stone of Assutiu, with sculptured stalks and
foliage, are worthy of notice. Some blocks disinterred here bearing
the name of Amenemha lIl. have again been covered with sand.
Several large blocks of limestone are also observed in the middle of
this large court of the Labyrinth. The inscriptions are almost entirely destroyed, but faint traces of painting, and the symbols < > o

(in) and oo, are still recognisable. From the traces still ex
isting, the whole structure would appear to have occupied an area
of 8800 sq. yds., and the large inner court an area of about 00 acres.

The Ancient Labyrinth. According to Brngsch, the Greek name Lallyrinthos, which has been differently interpreted, is derived frum mum"
ftp'elpa-ruinrnt', i. e. the'Temple of the mouth of the Lake'. The inscriptions found here by Lepsius prove that it was founded hy Amery
