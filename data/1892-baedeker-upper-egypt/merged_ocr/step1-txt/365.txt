tho oldest part, dating from Nectauehns. We know also that the
goddess of Philm was 1vorvhipped by the memmyes (p. 302), who
maintained the custom of human sarritices until the time of Justinian. Aftor Diocletian, who personally visited the island, had conquered theso restless children of the desert, he destroyed tho
fortifications of Philip. and new temples were erected in which
priests of the litemmyes and Nobades were permitted to offer
sacrifices to Isis along with the Egyptian priests And these tribes
even obtained the right of removing the miraculous image of
the mighty goddess from the island at certain solemn festivals
and of retaining it for some time. Even after all Egypt had long
been ehristianizml and the Thebaid was crowded with monks, the
ancient pagan-worship still held sway in Nubia, in spin: of the
Edict: of Theodosius. The Nobades were converted to Christianity
about 510 All under the auspices of the Empress Theodora, and
shortly afterwards Nantes, sent by Justinian to Egypt, closed the
temple of Isis on Phila', and sent. its sacred contents to Constantinople. At tirst the people of Philae adopted the orthodox creed, but
when Egypt was conquered by Islam, they exchanged this for the
monophysite heresy. Although an inscription has been found in
the promos in praise of a Bishop Theodorus (577 All), who dedicated a portion at least of the temple of Isis to St. Stephen, it
is doubtful whether Phila, was ever an episcopal seat. It is certain,
however, that Christian services were held in the hypostyle. The
inscriptions and reliefs were plastered over with Nile-mud or had
crosses carved upon them, so as to spare the feelings of the faithful and to exorcise the evil spirits. - Like Christianity, Islam was
late in finding its way to Philas, and there is not a trace of a mosque
or anything of that nature on the entire island. Nubia was effec-.
tnally conquered in the 13th cent. by the Egyptian sultans, who
im-luded the vataraet-region in their private domains, and thus
serured the temples from dmtmrtinn. HPhitzc wa: dest'ribcd in
1737 by Nortlen and Pocovke, though at that time the natives were
as hostile to strangers as they are now friendly and obliging.

Isis, the chief deity of the island, is usually represented in the
triad completed by Osiris and Horns, but she frequently also
appears alone. Everywhnro, in her various forms, she occupies
the foremost place, just as Hathor does at Denderah. The deities of
Phila, include fla and Month, the twiu-gods Shu and Tefnut, Seh
and Nut, C) and Isis, Khnum and
Sati, the gods oftho ratamvtst Horus the son of' Isis, llathor, and
the child Horus. Thoth, Safekh, and other deities also frequently
appear.

Phila, is the pearl of Egypt, and those who have several days to
spend at the rataract, should certainly take up their abode upon it.
