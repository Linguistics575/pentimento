Naos, dating from Ptolemy and Cleopatra.---" we quit the hypostyle of the temple of Isis proper by the small portal in its E. wall
between the first row of columns and the second pylon, we see
about 50 paces in front of us the Chapel of Hathor (P1. Q). the
smallest temple on the island. That it was especially dedicated to
Hathor we learn from hieroglyphic inscriptions

of the time of the emperor Augustus, and from the Greek inseription IEPTIA EHOIHCEN - TH - ACDPQAEITH,'Hiertia directed
(a prayer) to Aphrodite (Hathor)'.f The fact that the rear wall of
this chapel has no inscriptions and the ruins behind it indicate
that it was once joined to some larger edifice. At the entrance
stand two Ptolemaic columns, with a doorway between them, the
side-posts of which, unconnected with each other at the top, reach
to the hands below the capitals. This doorway is built up, and it
is probable that the single apartment within the temple was used
as a dwelling as its walls are much blackened.

Within appear Ptolemy VII. Philometor and Euergetes II. with Cleopatra; and also over the entrance. On the S. side is the emperor before

Hathor and Horsamiaai, and before Khnum and Blather }; on the N. side
before Osiris and Isis. Beneath was a geographical inscription.





The Kiosque.

A few minutes bring us from the chapel of Hathor to the elegant
and airy Pavilion (Pl. R), frequently called'pharaoh's Bed', one
of the chief decorations of the island, which may be easily recognized
by the lofti abaci, or rather imposts, that support the architrave.
Passengers are usually landed immediately below it. It is situated
on the E. coast of Phila, which is here bounded by a carefully
built wall. The builder of this beautiful temple, dedicated likewise
to Isis, was Nerva Trajanus; but its ornamentation with sculptures
and inscriptions was never quite completed. The inscriptions contain little of importance, so that the visitor may resign himself at
once to the pleasure of rest and luncheon on this beautiful spot.
The Kiosque of Phila has been depicted a thousand times, and the
slender and graceful form, that greets the eyes of the travellers as
they approach the island, well deserves the honour. The architect
who designed it was no stranger to Greek art, and this pavilion,
standing among the purely Egyptian temples around it, produces
the effect of a line of Homer among hieroglyphic inscriptions, or of
a naturally growing tree among artificially trimmed hedges. We
here perceive that a beautiful fundamental idea has power to distract
the attention from deflcieneies in the details by which it ie carried
