This tomb originally belonged to an anti-king Siptuh and his
wife Tauser, but it was afterwards appropriated by Seti < XckhL

of a rebellion in his kingdom (p.172) Whether the tomb also
contained the names of Seti 11., who rests in the adjoining tomb,
is exceedingly doubtful; they are not new visible. The queen Tauser
is more conspicuous in the paintings here than her husband, whence
it has been justly inferred that Siptah founded his claim to the
throne on rights tested in his wife.
