ably the sanctuary founded by that prince still lies beneath the
houses of the town. The hypostyle, however, must have been mined
and rebuilt under the Ptolemies, for the adornment of the hall begun by these princes was continued by the early Roman emperors
and completed by their successors. The inscriptions on the rearwall were begun by Ptolemy TH. Philometor. The Dedication Jnscription above the entrance celebrates the'autoerats' Tiberius,
Claudius, Germanium, and Tespasian as the builders, while a share
in the decoration of the interior was taken not only by these princes, but also by Titus, Domitian, Nerve, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Commodus, Septimius Severus,
Uaraealla, Geta, Julius Philippns, and rreeiusCWJ-25t). The name
of Decius is specially noteworthy as being the latest imperial name
that appears in hieroglyphies on any Egyptian monument.

Thegbwas also a special cycle of gods of Esneh, at the head of
which was Khnum, followed by Ila, Turn, Khepera, Shu, Osiris,
Home the son of Isis, Thoth, and Khunsu. Strabo narrates that
Athena and the fish Latus were worshipped here in Latopolis; and
he was not misinformed. We not only find the latter mentioned in
the inscriptions of the hypostyle, but the latus gave the town its
name under the Greeks, while the coins of the Lalopolilan Nome
bore the figure of a fish, and finally an inscription at Edfu informs
us that the people of Latopolis were forbidden to eat fish. Athena
(Nebunt) frequently appears, as we have seen; and as Straho makes
no mention of Khnum, who was undoubtedly the chief of all the
gods of this sanctuary, it must be concluded that he was for some
reason led to assign to the latus the plaee of this deity. Probably
