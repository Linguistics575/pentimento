architecture of the new monarchy; and we here see, in place of the capital next the central passage, the mask of the goddess Hathor, with her
cows' ears and head-dress. The front of a small portable temple with
handles, which rested on the head of the goddess, was placed on the aba,
cus, and upon this rested the arehitrave. The mask of Hathor here appears only on one side of the capital; at DÃ©r el-hahri it appears on two
sides. This artistic form was afterwards abandoned, but was again revived by NekhtrsetrftNeetaaebas IL), a rival king to the Persians, belonging to the 30th Dyn., who loved to compare himself to the expellers
of the Hyksos, and who therefore reverted to the art-forms introduced by
them. Finally under the Ptolemies this form was developed into a capital
in the fullest sense of the term. The masks are here united with the
plinths by means of a vertical Ornamental Stripe, covering two of the
sides of the polygonal shafts and adorned with inscriptions. As each of
the sixteen sides or faces of the columns measures 5 inches in breadth,
the stripe is 10 inches in breadth. - On the walls at the height of the
architraves, beneath the roof, appear other Hathor masks, alternating
with the names of the royal builders. Ameuhotep III. dedicated to his
father Tutmes ly. the chapel of the goddess Hebent, who here appears heside Ammon-Ra in place of Math. Both hieroglyphic: and pictures retain the freshness of their colours. The former represent the making of
offerings. On the side with the door appear two lions, like door-keepers,
beside lucubrations of later travellers in demotic characters.

Another Inscription in clear hieroglyphics must be mentioned here. It is

It was engraved in the rock by a celebrated young French Egyptologist,
whose name we suppress.

At this chapel we turn, direct our steps towards the Nile, and in
1/4 hr. reach the ROCK TEMPLE, on the right side of the valley, recognizable from a distance by the Stair leading up to it. The latter
consists of M steps hewn in the rock, with a massive balustrade
on each side. The temple was constructed under Ptolemy IN.
Euergetes u. (Physkon), and subsequently provided with new in-.
scriptions by Ptolemy X. Soter II. The site was regarded as holy
even before the building was erected, as we are informed by an inscription of the reign of Ramses YI., cut in the rock on the E. side
of the door leading into the mountain.

The Rock Chamber has a vaulted ceiling covered with stucco, and,
being the sanctuary of the temple, was constructed earlier than the preceding chambers to which the stair leads. The latter form two parts.
On reaching the top of the stair, we pass through a doorway to a ForeCourt, not quite 33 ft. wide, the exterior sides of which were bounded by
low walls built between columns. Two rows of columns in the centre led
to the door of a smaller Hall (only MI ft. wide) of curious construction,
being bounded on the right and left by four low walls, of which each
was built in between a pillar and a column. The door leading to the

rock-chamber opened at the back of this hall. This sanctuary also was
especially dedicated to Hebent.
