In the series below these, Pihm'i S seen with a hook in which he is
writing, before him a large writing apparatus. The accompanying inscription is:'Recording the number of cattle by the overseer of Anit, the director
of the fields of the S. district, from the temple of Hathor (Aphroditopolis,
p. 231) to el-mils,' - Then follow cattle of various kinds, calves, oxen,
asses; several of these being prepared for the table or for sacrifice; a fireplace. Next appears Pihari, seated and inspecting the weighing and shipping of gold which is mostly made into rings. Farther to the right, the
catching and preparing of fish and also of poultry, Pihari standing and
looking on. - Above Pihuri ham Oil his lap the young prince Uazmes,

named. Pihari with his wife At renheh, in a bower, receiving fruit.
Grapes are being gathered, and trodden out in a wine-press by nude

The remaining paintings illustrate the Burial of Pihari, whose eoffin

an offering made by their s0n Amonmes, who is clad in a leopard's-skin.

grandfather, grandmother, brothers, sisters, and aunts; above is the shipmaster Aahmes, sou of Abna, with his wife; below is Ateyteea the nurse

various campaigns to Zahi, Rush, Naharina, and against the Shaw, and

skin brings to him the offerings of the high-priests. A crowd of
relatives, including Hui, another son-in-law, is also represented.
