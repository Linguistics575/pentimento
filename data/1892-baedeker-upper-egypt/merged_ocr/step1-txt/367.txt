and his two wives, against the expense caused by the too frequent visits
of royal officials and their retinues, which impoverished the temple.
Above this are two other inscriptions, only fragments of which are preserved, in which the granting of the petition by the king and the consequent royal decree are announced.

This obelisk has been of the greatest imperlanee for the interpretation
of the Egyptian hieroglyphics. The names of Ptolemy Euergetes and
Cleopatra, which occur in Greek on the pedestal, were discovered by
ChampolliOn in 1822 on the obelisk itself, and from the latter name he
was enabled to add a few more alphahetical signs to those already ascertained from the Rosetta decree (Vol. 1., p. 111).

The W. Obelisk, as we have said, remains in situ though it has
lost its point. Upon it is inscribed, in Greek, a petition from Theodotos, son ofAgesiphon, to Isis and her fellow-gods, dating from the
time of Neos Dionysus. There are also some Arabic inscriptions.

The hypathral vestibule was bounded on each side (E. and wo
by six columns and one of the obelisks. The six w. columns are
still standing, but only three stumps of the E. row remain. Between
the column; were screen-walls, half as high as the shafts, and
adorned with concave cornice: and halustrades of Urarus-serpeuts.
The columns, only 21/6 ft. in thickness, are 151/3 ft. high, and have
Calyx-capitals supporting an abacus decorated with the Hathormask, on which rests a small chapel. These capitals, which resemble those of the Ptolemaie epoch, are specially remarkable, as
they were erected by Nectanebus before the period of the Lagidan
Nectanebus who maintained himself for some time in opposition to
the Persian kings, appears to have delighted in comparing himself
to the ancient Pharaoh as we may gather from his first name Ita,
kheper'a, which was also that of Usertesen L of the 19th Dyn.;
and it is possible that he adopted, in the same spirit, old and forgotten artistic forms in his erections It is certain that the Hathormask at the top of the columns is only found earlier than his time
on the monuments of the 18th Dyn. at Dir el-bahri (b. 223) and
el- Kit, (p. 236). The architects of the Ptolcmies were afterwards attracted by the abacus adorned with the countenance of the goddess
ofDenderah, adopted it, and farther developed the sculptured calyxcapital, here first introduced by Nectanebus. - On the w, and E.
sides of each of the Ax standing columns are dedication-inscriptions.
On the outer (W.) side of the most southerly column (next to the
obelisk) is the inscription:'The good god, lord of both worlds,
Ra-kheper-ka, son of the sun and lord of the diadems, Nectanebus,
the ever-living, erected this sumptuous building for his mother
Isis, the bestower of life, in order to enlarge her dwelling with excellent work, for time and for eternity" .--On the outer side of the







third column the name of Phila: appears as Alek (with the

article, P-alek), a form found at many other places, and the mistress

of the island is named "i'Coi) b? ty l ll FttttF e
