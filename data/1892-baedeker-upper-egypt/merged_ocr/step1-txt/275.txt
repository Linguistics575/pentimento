pm Abu'l Neggah. THEBES. 19. Route. 201

Ammon-Ra is the lord and master of the throne of the universe, the
living and acting God of heaven. These three form a trinity which is
the deity of Bibun el-3Iu10k, and is worshipped in Amenthes, as we find
represented in every tenth Here also Isis and Nephthys mourn for
the dead, and worship those who have become lla of Amenthes; for as
the pilgrimage of human life is only an image of the daily and yearly
pilgrimage of the sun, so the dead king, who once ruled over the land,
becomes like a Ha of Amenthes, and every royal tomb an image of Amenthes
itself.

The largest part of all the representations is occupied by the Descrip
a

tion of Life in tk ale. Tua-t, or the depth of the grave. The

centre of this life is Ra the blessed, who is here always called Afu-Ra,
i.e. the body of Ra, in opposition to his soul which dwells not in Tua-t,
but in heaven. He passes by in a boat, always accompanied by Sen and
Hekau. Sometimes he is followed by other gods; he stands in a pavilion,
round which a serpent coils. The gods of That draw his boat. By
the side of this we are generally shown these deities worshipping him,
and also Thin piercing with a lance the serpent which resists his boat.
The serpent may be either good or evil. In No. 8, Room v, the Urteus
serpent, and the serpent urtite are instances of good serpents. Those

that place themselves before the boat are evil. They are called by
various names: Nehehka, Neheb-Ashuljeru, etc. Sometimes they are
rearing up in combat, sometimes lying slothfully coiled up, and sometimes they appear with legs and wings, and scattering five. The serpents
at the doors apparently only held the post at" MO, or doorkeepers.
Besides these we find mentioned a large number of other beings eonuected with Ta -t

As to the Nations represented in Nos. It and 17, it need only he said
that all are humming themselves before Ha, after all his enemies have
been conquered by Tum.

An active life prevails in Tua-t; there is driving, singing, fighting,
reaping, etc. It should be noticed that the same representations of AN..
Ra are found in many of the papyrus-rolls.

The Gods of the Dead by whom the deceased are introduced into this
world are almost all represented here. Most often it is thejackal-headed
Anubis that is invoked as god of the dead by Isis aud Nephthys in
favour of the deceased. The infernal Hathor or Nevsekhet also often
appears. The worship of Osiris gives way to that of the blessed m, but
still the king is represented as adoring him, usually over the door of the
hall of the sarcophagus. Thoth and the Moon only occasionally appear.

Before the King can enter his last resting-place in peace, he must
first be justiliet1; and referring to this the 120th chapter of the Book of
the Dead is usually found in the square room in front of the sarcophagushall, as in No. b' it is found on the left
of the entrance.

The Priestly Ceremonies connected with the king's effigy, in which
apparently his son took part, are most perfect in No. u, less well preserved in No 17, and most abridged in No. If, in the passage leading
down from the first hall of pillars.

The whole represents the Former: of the Dead. After Afu-Ra and
withhim the king have overcome the obstacles of evil, and he has justilied himself from all h sit, he enters into the lllost Holy Place, the
Empyrean, the highest heaven or abode of the blessed, where the visible
world of Anmion-lta appears to touch the Tua-t of the blessed Ila. Here
the songs of joy and hymns of praise resound, and Ammon-Ra spreads
out his wings like a mighty bird. The gods move past in their barks,
the stars rise and set, the hours, the days, the y m pass by. The king
is placed among the gods, he dwells among the i "' and the Divine
Comedy is finished.
