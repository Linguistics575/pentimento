chamber belonging to the Hall of the Altar'; while in the exterior

marginal inscriptions it is called A Se) tua, interpreted by

Diimiehen as Room of Puritieation. It was probably used in the
preparations for the festival ceremonies that took place in the adjoining Hall of the Altar; and among its inscriptions in honour
of llathor is one that seems to indicate that the temple at Denderah
is to be regarded as a replica of' a celebrated temple of the sun-god
of Heliopolis, of which however no trace now remains Here a
reference is made to the gilding and painting of the sculptured ornamentation, which are so often mentioned in the inscriptions.
A careful examination of the walls in some of the rooms will still

repository for the sacred wreaths and garments, with which the
images of Hathor and her fellow-gods were adorned at the festivals
celebrated in the temple and sometimes at the great new year's
festival. According to the sculptures and inscriptions the prepared
perfumes were also platted here. One half of the room was devoted
to the garments, the other to the sacred perfumes. Over the latter
presided the divine Mazet, previously mentioned among the managers of the manufacture of' the incense and anointing oil as one of
the lords of the laboratory (p. 88); over the former IIathotep, god
of woven fabrics, with his companion the goddess Tai, held sway.
