prefect Avidius Heliodorus, the military commandant Septimius Jfaero and
the general (strategus) Pueniat Caepio. The celebrated rhetorician Aristides

route leads sits Hadegugeh, with a good spring and tine date- Walrus and dihvpalms, to Berys (600 iuhab.; 13 hrs. from 311153). situated on a hill, with
numerous date-palms and surrounded with fields of grain (ehiefly dura),
abounding in springs. 51.111111 11m iul 111.), a hrs. farther, is the most
southerly point in the oasis. The caravan-route leads hence in 25 days ot Dariid. About halfway between Berys and Naks, but a little to E. of the road,
lies the lemple rriDgsh et-frrtlVM. This temple also was once surrounded
with p, high wall of unburned bricks, furnished on the inside with stairs
and galleries. Two prupylous stand in front of the temple which faces

the inhabitants of Kysis (oiixo c-it Krssurr, comp. Kits, the above-mentioned hieroglyphic name (if the oasis) record the building of this pylon,
under Marcus Rutilius Lupus, prefect of Egypt. On the left wall of the
same pylon is another but hardly deeiphisvahle Greek inscription in which
the name Ã©'li. m'cn recurs. Behind the propylon are some remains of columns,
so that a colonnaded gallery must be supposed to have e: ted between
the first and second'pylons, which are 10011. The Second Pylon,
onl 131111111 1 trad 13%. ft. long, is united by a brick wall with the
girdle-wall. The poor sculptures upon it represent a king whose name
is not legible. Ahout Mt Farther back is the temple proper, its first
portion being a kind of Vestibule, on the sides of 1111111 111111111 emperor
presents offering; 111 Scrapis. Isis, and Horus. The hiernglyphics, however,
are scarcely legible. This vestibule, with two columns at the entrance,
is only 2'21: broad and 133/, ft. deep. Beyond it is a portico with four
columns, the capitals of which are much damaged. A door in the right
(W.) wall seems to have led to a staircase. At the back of the pnrtim
is a large door between two smaller 111155, the former leading into the
sanctuary which is divided into two chambers, the latter into corridors.
The method of lighting the sanctuary chambers by windows at the top of
the walls, like those in the great temple of Karnak, and the vaulted roof
should he noticed. Over the doors appears the winged sun-disc, and on
each side are hieroglyphics. The S. (back) wall of the temple is also
covered with reliefs, une representing the emperor Domitian, sacrificing
to Horus, son of Isis, and to Osiris.

111111111 430 11115 from this temple are the ruins of another nnteworthy
structure, wholly of brick, apparently also a. temple. The entrance is
formed hy a pointed Gothic arch, and the three following chambers have
doors of the same form, on which the winged sun-disc is still to be seen.
