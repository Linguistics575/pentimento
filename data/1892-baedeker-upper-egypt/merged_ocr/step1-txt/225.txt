Calms: of Memnon. THERES. 12. Route. 157

famous sound. The oldest inscription dates from the 11th year of Nero's
reign. - Many of the great officials who visited the marvels of Thebes were
accompanied by their wives. Thus Lucius Juuius Calvinus and his wife
Ninieia Rustica, in the Ith year of Vespasian, heard the phenomenon at the
second hour, though most other visitors heard it at the morning-hour,
e, m or soon after sunrise. The colossus was frequently dumb, in which
case the visitor usually waited until a more favourable occasion. Many
were so struck with the phenomenon that the: were not content till they
had heard it three or four times. Hadrian, whojourneyed through Egypt
in 130 Ah, spent several days here along with his wife Sabina and a

large retinue. In his reign a perfect flood of verses spread over the legs
of the colossus, most of them by the vain cnurt-poetess Balhilla, the descendant. of a noble house, as she is careful to mention. One of her
etrusions (on the left leg) relates in 16 hexameters, that Memnon greeted
Hadrian, as well as he could (air; aumrm when he perceived the emperor
before sunrise, but that a clearer note, like that caused by a Now on an
instrument of copper, was emitted at the second hour, and that even a
third sound was heard. Hadrian greeted Memnnn as often, and all the
world could see how dear the emperor was to the god.
'flalbilla, by an inward impulse stirred'
'Has written all she saw and all she heard'.

:3: far the best verses are those on the front of the pedestal by Asklrpiodotus, who calls himself imperial procurator and poet. They may
be translated as follows:
'Sea-born Thetis, learn that Memnon suffered never pangs of dying

'Still, where Libyan mountains rise, sounds the voice of his loud crying"
'ofountains which the Nile-stream, leaving, parts from Thebes, the hundred-gated)'
'When he glows, through rays maternal with warm light illu.mi..nated'.

'But thy son who, never-sated, dreadful battle still was seekiug',

'Dumb in Troy and Thessaly, rests now, never speaking'...

On the right leg of the colossus is a curious'Homeric' poem, inscribed
by a certain Areies, and made up of four lines from the Iliad and Odyssey, pieced together by the poet sn as to express his meaning:

'Alas, a mighty wonder I there behold with mine eyes'
(11. xiii, 99)
'Truly a god is here, a noble inhabitant of heaven!'
(Od. sis, M) )
'Loud he raises his voice, and stays the assembled multitude'.
(Od. xxiv, 530)
'Never could a mortal man accomplish such a thing as this'.
(Oil. xvi, IN).

The ruins in the neighbourhood of the colossi are unimportant.
About 3 min. beyond them is another Statue of great size, now,
however, almost completely covered by arable land. Farther to the
N.W. are very numerous smaller statues. The ruined Amenophium,
at the gates of which the above-mentioned statues stood, has left an
important memorial in the shape of a conspicuous colossal Sandstone Stele, erected by Amenhotep 111. It now has its broadest
surface uppermost, and is covered with hieroglyphics in the grand
style, which. with the representations, refer to the dedication of the
temple. In the rounded pediment the Pharaoh appears receiving
the symbol of life from Amman on the right, and from Sokar-C) siris
0n the left; above are the winged sun-dise and the name of Amenhotep m. Behind the Pharaoh in each case is his consort Tii,
adorned with the feather-crown. The first line of the inscription

contains the pompous titles of the king; the second begins as follows:
