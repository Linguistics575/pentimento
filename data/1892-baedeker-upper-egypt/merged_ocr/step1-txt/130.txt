ning with the black mountains and stretching among them for a long way
is the Wirdi Eam√©mat, where the green hreeeia was quarried in the most
ancient times. In the more we reach the Bfr Hamduuit, a well in ft. in
diameter, with a stone coping. Near the well are the remains ofa Roman
wall, and between the two are tive uri0nisheil sarcophagi, some completely
shattered. Near the well begins a series of short graffiti, including an
inscription of Phra em hat, a superintendent of labourers, and representing Ammon with a ram's head bearing the Atef crown. The cartouehe
ot' Seti n, is also met with. About 1 hr. farther on are longer inseriptions. In the first a miner named Art en benipe is mentioned and the







symbol of the etow-bar is given. The numerous inscriptions of the

old empire found here, belonging to the 5th, 6th, 11th, 12th, and 13th
Dynasties, have been published by Lepsius (Part IL at his'Denkmiilcr')
and have recently been completed by W. Goleniseheir. They begin with
kings Tetkara-Assa and Unas of the 5th, and trserkara and Pepi of the Gth
Dynasty. The most interesting of all is the inscription of the 8th year of
Bankh karat, in which a military expedition from Koptos to linger is recorded; it gives the heme: of the stations, mentions the digging of two
cisterns, and relates the passage from Tue (the early name of ittteer) to
the'Holy Land' (ale. Arabia). The name of Rohannu also occurs. Among
the later inscription? of the 20th Dynasty may be mentioned one (if the
3rd year of Ramses ('Denkmiiher' of Lepsius, in. 210; transl. in Brugsch s'History of Egypt', Eng. teet.st., Vol. 2, pp. 175 et squ. We learn from
this inscription that in the part of this desert named Rohmlull

but not gold obtained there. The Turin Museum possesses the plan of
another map at a gold-mining region (of the time of Seti 1.), the gold

In the great inscription of Ramses IV. a complete list is given of all
the higher and lower oN hie, as well as of all the workmen, including
800 Aperiu (from the desert to the E. of the Delta), who had been sent
to the quarries by command of the king. The total number amounts to
8368 souls, fOr whose support eommissariat columns were constantly
on the move between Koptos and Bekhen. At tine is we read:'Total 8368.
Provisions for these were brought upon ten waggons, and six yoke of
oxen were attached to each waggon in going from Egypt to the Bekhen

the genealogy of 25 architects. Xerxes and Artaxerxes are also mentioned
in the inscriptions of Persian offleiahs.

Just beyond the quarries the route turns from the N.E. to the S. and
passes the ruins of eLantikht'n an old mining site. Those who wish to
continue their journey to the Red Sea have still two short days' marches
ahead of them, the route leading through the Wddi Rdgtfah to Bc'dahwir
