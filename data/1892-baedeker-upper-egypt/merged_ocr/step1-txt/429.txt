The oasis and the oracle of Ammon were celebrated from a remote
antiquity. Bacchus is said to have been the first to consult the oracle;
and in the legend of Perseus and Andromeda, the latter was said to have
been offered to the sea-monster to save her country, in obedience to a
response ofthis god. Hercules presenteda great offksringtoAmmon, Semiramis
consnlted the oracle on her expedition to Egypt. The law-giver ftocehoris
(Bek-en-ranf; 5klttt D 8th cent. B c.) expelled the Jews from the land at the
bidding ofthe god. Psammetikh I. enrolled the Carin"; with plumes ofcoek'g
feathers in obedience to his response. Herodotus relates (m, 25, 26) that
Gamhyses sent mrm me" to take the Ammonites slaves and to destroy their
oracle with fire, This force reached the city of Oasis, also called the Island
of the Blessed, after 7 days march, and then vanished into space, apparently
heihe overwhelmed by a whirlwind. The oasis and its oracle are, however, best known from the vi t of Alexander the Great, recorded hy Diodorus (XVII, YO, Quinta: Curtius, and Arl'iml after Aristuhuius. After
Alexander had made himself master of Phremicia by the battle of Issue,
he marched to Egypt which submitted without resistance. Desiring to
consult the famous Oracle of Ammon, he undertook the adventurous march
through the desert, Ambassadors from Cyrene met him with a valuable
gift of war-horset His supply of water came to an end after four days,
and he was only saved from perishing by an unexpected fall of rain.'1 he

the so-called Cities of Ammon, and another day's journey brought him to
the vicinity of the temple. Diodorus thus describes the place.'The Ammnnites dwell in villages, hut in the midst of their land is a castle defended hy a triple wall. The first (Le. innermost) wall encloses the palace of the ruler; the second the women and children and the palladia ofthe place, with the temple
of the god and the sacred spring; the third encloses the abode of the
spearmen, etc. A little beyond the castle another temple of Ammon has
been erected under the shade of numerous large trees. Near it is a spring,
called Spring of the Sun On account of its peculiar properties. It is warm
in the morning. c .t i" midday, and hot at midnight. The image of the
and is encrusted with emeralds and other gems, and gives its oracular
responses in a curious way. It is carried in a golden boat on the shoulders of eighty priests, who direct. their course according to signs from the
god. Women and girls accompany the god with songs'.

When Alexander entered the temple he was hidden welcome by the
oldest priest in the name of the god. Alexander accepted the Welcome
and promised to worship the and, if he gave him the lordship of the
whole earth. The king then asked whether all the murderers of his father had been punished. The oracle replied that no one could aim at the
life of him that had made him (tie. of the god); but that the murderers
