that Moses was born here. Near the cemetery are some ancient substructures with fragments of inscriptions recording that Hermonthis, which must have existed even under the old monarchy, was
adorned under the 18th Dyn. with tine buildings for the deity of
the city. Strabo relates that Zeus and Apollo were worshipped and
that a sacred bull was kept here. As a matter of fact the menuments, besides mentioning several female deities, name Month
(Zeus) and seven forms of Horus (Apollo) as the chief gods at Hermonthis, while the coins of the Nomos llermonthites bear the figure
of a bull turned towards the right, and preparing to fight, with
lowered horns and extended tail. The Pharaoh is described as falling upon his foes, like'Month, the bull raising himself to combat'.
- At Rizagdt, Al 2 M. to the S.W. of Erment, a stele of the 18th
Dyn. was found, in which this place is named Aimatiru.

011 the right bank, facing the curve which the Nile describes at
the village of Sentd, lies the village of Tad, the ancient Tuphium.
with a ruinous chamber, the sole relic of a small temple of the
Ptolemies. Maspero recently discovered here a granite sacrificial
table, with a dedication by Usertesen I. to the god Month. Steles
of the 12th and 13th Dyn. (now at Gizeh) were found at 8alatntyeh,
13 4 M. to the W. of Ttsd. - At JfeaMli, on the E. bank, are fragments of a Sphinx with the name of Amenhotep I.

On the W. bank, 13 M. above Erment, and opposite a large island, rise two rocky heights, known as Gebelén, i.e. the'two mountains', on one of which is the tomb of a Shékh Jlasah, probably
confounded with Moses (see above). Here, on the site of the ancient

path, which, according to Strabo, must be looked for between 11ermonthis (Erment) and Latopolis CEsneh). Extensive excavations
carried on at this spot by Maspero yielded sarcophagi of' the 12th
Dyu. and also numerous domestic articles, etc., appropriate to persons of comparative poverty.

On the W. bank, 131'2 M. farther up, lies Esneh, the ancient
Lntopotis, a town of 9000 ilihabl, where the tourist-steamers halt
for 3 hrs., while the mail-steamer on the downward voyage stops
all night. The profane name of this place under the Pharaohs was

Esneh. Esneh has large grain and cattle markets, at which prices
are lower than at Assn n. The town, in which there are numerous
coffee-houses and ghawazi, is somewhat notorious for the dissolute
disposition of the otherwise industrious inhabitants, many of whom
are employed in wool-weaving. The Bazaar, at the entrance to
which is a kind of Jfarket-Place, is tolerably well furnished. The
streets are well built and some of the shops are European in cha-.
