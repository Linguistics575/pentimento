Distribution of Time. The ruins of the city of the hundred gates are
so huge, so widely scattered, and so profoundly interesting, that at least
576 days are necessary to inspect the chief points alone. Those who are
specially interested in Egyptology will of course devote a much longer
time to Thebes; weeks or even months may be spent in a careful study
of its monuments and tombs. - Cook's tourisi-programme devotes the
Ist day to the temple of Seti I. at t (urnah and the Tombs of the Kings,
the return being made at the choice of the tourist either direct or over
the hill to Dh, the Ramesseum, and the Colossi of Memnon. 2nd day: Temple of Karnak; Luxor in the afternoon. - 3rd day: Ilamcsscum, Tombs of Shékh'Abd eHryrnah, Mr ckodilteh, Medinet Hahn,
and Cnlossi of Memnon. Those Who are fatigued by the previous eseursions should at least make an emu tto proceed to Medinet Hahn where
the party lunches (and in the interval visit Der e1-Nedtneh). - A moonlight ride to Karnak may be taken (at the tourist's private expense) on
one of the evenings.

Those who are at liberty to arrange their time for themselves will
find the following programme of a Three Days' Visit convenient.

Ist day. Luxor and Karnak (E. bank). Though visitors are sometimes advised to reserve this, the most gigantic of the monuments, to the
last, it is really desirable to visit Karnak first of all, before fatigue has
begun. The traveller who visits Karnak on the first day proceeds then
to view the other lions, with the satisfactory feeling that Thebes has
fulii11ed his highest expectations; and he will not fail to take a later
opportunity, by moonlight "at any free time, to return to refresh and
coniirut his first impression. Visitors should ride early to Karnak, while
the temple of Luxor, easily reached in a few minutes from the i1ha1rabiyeh,
may be reserved for an onevnoon-visit.

2nd day. Crnss the river early, visit the Colussi of Memnon, the
Ramesseum, Medinet Hahn, and Dér el-Medineh, in the morning if possible,
"time permit also one of the tombs in the part of the Neeropolis of
Thebes known as Kurnet Nurrar, and finally some of the Tombs of Shtskh
'Abil el-Kurnah. The view at sunset from this point is of incomparable
beauty and interest.

3rd day. Cross the river early, visit the temple of Seti I. at Kurnah,
ride to the valley of the Tombs of the Rings fBibiin e1-hfultk) with the
famous graves of the Pharaohs, thou ems the ridge which divides the
latter from the other valleys of the Necropnlis, and visit the terrace-telnple
of Dér e1-Eabri and some of the tombs ot' cl mi A visit to the Tombs
of the Queens may the combined with an expedition to Medinet-Habu.
Other less important monuments may be included according to their
situation.

The Four days" programme of Gaze's steamers is still better: - Ist
day. Luxor and Karnak. 2nd day. Temple of Seti I, Tombs of the
Rings, Der el-Bahri, and the Ramesseum. 3rd day. Colossi of Menmon,
Medinet Habu, Dér el-Medineh1 and Shékh'Abd el-Eillrnah. 4th day. Great
