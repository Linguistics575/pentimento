to fieneh. JiENEH. 5. mute, 73

At the time of the pilgrimage to Mecca hunch presents a very lively
scene, as it is then frequented by large numbers of the participators
in that great religious picnic. The spiritual and material wants of
the pious IJeditlrli are catered for by six spacious mosques, Humerous coffee-houses, and alarge number of places of amusement, among
the attractions of which Egyptian daneing-girls are prominent. For
the rest Jieneh differs little in general character from the other
towns of Upper Egypt. The traveller should not fail, however, to
see the most valuable piece of land near Iieneh, which is about one
Fuddin (3500 sq.yds.) in area and yields an excellent variety of
potter's clay that has made Iy'eneh pottery, like thatofhssitit, t'arnous
throughout the country. Bench has a special reputation for its
Kulul (pl. of 191110 ], or cool porous water-bottles, and for its Bath'ts
and Zh, large vessels used in carrying, purifying, and preserving
water. In some of the early Egyptian inscriptions figures of the
tall√©s and lit appear as distinctive symbols, in the exact forms in
which they are made to-day. Hundreds of thousands of these clay
vessels are annually exported from Keneh in boats of a primitive
but not unpraetieal description, constructed for the purpose, in
which they are piled up in pyramidal form, fastened together with
ropes made of the hast of the date-palm and attached to rectangular
frames. A trustworthy report fixes the number sent away in 1800
at 900,000. Considerable activity is also manifested in the manufaeture of kiln-dried pottery, generally either red or black, used for
ehibouk-heads, bottles, pitchers, vases, drinking-vessels, etc., of
every size and shape. The almost invariably graceful forms and
tasteful decorations of these utensils may be unreservedly set down
as a bequest from ancient Egypt.

6. Routes through the Eastern Desert.

1ieneli is a place of same importance as the starting-point of the
caravans traversing the Arabian desert to gram Cy. 77) and as an emporium of the trade of Upper Egypt with the nu!
Sea. It consequently affords a good opportunity of making a short and
comparatively eaiy desert journey, as the interesting excursion m F
can be made without any very great privation or danger. The came mute leads viii I.larrvirruU, traversing the rocky Arabian Desert, which is
not nnly of great scenic grandeur but also full of interest for the naturalist and the archaeologist. 15'r, a port on the Red Sea, is about
110 M. ham li neu, and the journey can be made comfortably in four,
ur al must I e days.

These desert-routes were important even in antiquity for the trade
with the seaports and the land of Pant (Arabia) on the one side and the
valuable quarries in the mountains of the Arabian Desert on the other.
Spices and other costly products were sent across the desert to Kench.
at first on donkey-hack and afterwards on camels, while green breecia
and several varieties of granite were sent down to the sea in return. The
most important points on the Red Sea, named from N. to b'., were leos
Harms (now Abu fi'ar el-NW), in the latitude of Noufaltlt; Leukos
Limen, now l; _,' and Berenike, in the latitude of Assuan. The route
from Reach lo Myus Ilurmos leads to the N.E., and a short detour may
be made through the Wadi Fagireh, with its granite-quarries, and past
