purpose. To Prof. Ebers the editoyis indebted for the account
of the Nile-voyage as far as ahifineluding Philte; Prof. Diimichen contributed the descriptions of the temples of Denderah and Edfu, of the town of Keneh, and of the eawaTran1'011tes thence Vii the quarries of 1Jamrimttt t0 Fos.iir 0n the

Oases are wholly from the pen of Prof. Eisenlohr.

The practical introduction to the first volume, and the
sections on the geography, history, and art of Egypt, there
polished, apply of course also to the districts of Upper
Egypt. The special introduction to the present volume deals
ehiefly with the Nile voyage and the necessary preparations
for it, preceded by a brief survey of the chief steamer-routes
between Egypt and Europe and a note on the new Egyptian
monetary system, introduced since the publication of the
Handbook to Lower Egypt. A list of works on Egypt is
added, and, to obviate the necessity of too frequent ITVferences t0 the first volume, also'l chronological list of the
rulers of Egypt down to the close of the Ptolemaie period,
and a selection from the royal earto11ches of most frequent
occurrence in Upper Egypt. Finally the Arabic Alphabet
is given, showing the system of transliteration adopted in
this Handbook.

The MAPS and PLANS have been an object of especial
care. The former are based upon the large maps of Kiepert,
Iepsius, and Linant; the latter chiefly upon the plans of
Lepsizes, though with the necessary additions and corrections,
while some have been specially prepared by Prof. Eisenlohr.
