There is a. difference of opinion "to the Situation anti Form of the
Ancient Lake. Linant- Bey, arguing from the considerable difference of
level between the two lakes, maintains that the Birket el- Kurun (Lake
of the Mor ns, p. 431 could never have formed part of Lake Mieris, as was
formerly supposed and he wines to the latter a mneh smaller area than
11:11 attributed to it under the earlier theory. Placing u farther to the
S.E., nearer to the Labyrinth and el-Lahl1n, he makes its bonndary-line

measurements made by himself on the spot, ascribe: a considerably larger
area to the lake than Linant, and maintains that it extended on the S.W.

whole of the Fayum could be laid under water, so that even the Birket

embankments and the removal of the mud were discontinued, the lake
must have become unserviceahle, especially after the lock-gates at elLahtin fell to decay, each opening of which, as Diodorus informs us,
