investigated. Travellers who wish to do so will find the hill not a very
arduous climb. In descending they may strike the river at a point a
little farther to the S. and row thence to the dhahabiyeh.

On the W. bank, 3 M. from the river, lies eIAKusiyeh, now an
insignificant fellah town, representing the ancient Kusae, in Which,
according to Elian, Venus Urania and her cow (i.e. Hathor neht
pet Hathor, the mistress of heaven) were worshipped. No inscriptions have been found in Iiusiyeh itself, but elsewhere the name
of lIathor occurs as the Lady of Kesi, From Kesi came the Coptic
1'uuc-Hous (kos-koo), and thence was derived the Arabic lgusiyeh.

At el-Harte, on the E. bank, are the ruins of an ancient Egyptian town, at the mouth of a With ascending to the Arabian mountains. The walls, provided in places with window-openings, are
high, but fragments of demotie inscriptions show them to be of late
date. Small caves in the rocks contain bones from mummies of
men and eats.

Mtndaltat, on the W. bank (rail. stat., see p. o, an important
town with 13,900 inhab., is the seat of a Coptic bishop and contains several fine villas and gardens and a bazaar. Its market is
much frequented on Sum, and it also prossesses a sugar-factory
and a distillery, where date-brandy C" ara.ki) is made, partly for local
consumption by the Copts and partly for export. The town lies
close to the river, which must here have greatly encroached on the
W. bank since the close of last century. The Arabs translate Monfaldt as'Lot's place of banishment'.

To the SKY. o? Jlonfrshit lies Beni'Adin, where in 1798 a collision
took place between the troops of General Desaix and the Arabs. In the
following year, just after the arrival of a caravan from Darfdr, General
Davoust destroyed it as a nest of rebels, taking the women prisoners.
Muhammad 2 united his army here in 1320. The journey to the oasis

of Furrifrah (p. 34cl is frequently begun here. The first station to the
N.W. is the convent of Maragh, containing 50 Coptic monks.

Esh-Shelgilhil, a small village on the E. hank, lies on a
narrow strip of fertile land between the Nile and the S. end of the
rocky Gehet Ahu FÃ©dah. It is the starting-point for a visit to the
Crocodile Grotto of Ma'abdeh. A guide, who may be procured in
the village of Shekilhilt is necessary to show the best way over
the stony hill and to point out the entrance to the cavern, which
easily escapes the eyes of even prar'tisetl searchers. Lantern and
ropes are also necessary, and a few strong sailors to handle the
latter. Ladies should not attempt this excursion. The distance is
about 41,2 31., and most of the way is up a steep hill. We first
proceed towards the N.W. to the (1/2 hr.) village of et-Mdabileh,
and theme to the N.E. towards the hill, the plateau of which we
reach in% hr. A walk of 1 2 hr. towards the S. then brings us to
the grotto. The entrance is in the shape of a hole 12 ft. deep. into
which we are lowered by ropes, a guide previously descending to
aid in landing. We then creep on all-fours for some distance
through the dust of aneient mummies, and after some time
