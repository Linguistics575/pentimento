The tomb between the two last-mentioned belongs to a lady named Sebekhi,
perhaps a wife of Beba.

On the w. bank opposite tal-kits, on a hill about 3 M. from the Nile,
are the partly destroyed roek-tombs of Eiun el-Ahmar ('Red 11il10, dating
from the time of Tutmes I Landing at G'hernaxiyeh, we, precede thence
due E. through the field vid (20min.) Monisdt. In 20 min. more we reach

ur. The three hawks are Horus, Tuamutef, and Kehsenuf. A

hawk is also named in the tombs as a local god. The name of Usertesen was not found on the heaps of rubbish in 1885 by Professor Eisenlohr. - About'h N. farther to the E. begins the desert, and 1/4 M.
farther is the ancient Roman fort of 8efian, on which large vultures frequently perch. In 20 min. more we begin to mount the hill with the
tombs. There are altogether eight tombs, of which only the iirst tn the
right (Tut) and the lirst to the left (Horames, chief priest of Hieraconpolis)
repay a visit. The former contains a well-preserved stele of the time
of Tutmes 1.2, outside the latter, to the right, dancing-girls were painted.
Not long ago three black granite statues were found here, with the names
of Kings Pepi thh DynJ, Ra-kha-kheper (Usertesen IL), and Ra-en-mat
(Amenemha IIL, 12th Lyn.). These are now in the museum at Gizeh.

131/2 M. from el-kit, is Edfu, on the W. bank.

23. Edfu.

Edfu is a steamboat-station. The MailSteamers arriving on Tues. and
ma. at 334) am. halt here for 21/2 hrs.; the Tourist Steamer! spend a
night here on their upwardjourney. Tourists on a m weeks tour visit
the temple on the evening of the arrival (11th day, A time uu a
four-weeks tour visit it the next morning. Steamers do not stop here
on the downward voyage, The halt of the mail-steamers gives hardly
time even for a hasty visit to the temple, especially as the latter lies
20 min. from the landing-place.

Those who travel in their own dhahahiyeh should spend two days at
Edfu, bringing their provisions from the boat to the temple. Egyptologists,
who may find material to occupy them here for days and weeks, will obtain,
if necessary, poor lodging and scanty fare in the Post Rouse,'h M. to the
E. of the temple. Insect-powder should in this case not be forgotten;
and wine and preserved meat should be brought from Luxor.

Donkeys and harsh? are to be had at the Landing-place. Camels may
also be obtained. Riders unaccustomed to the latter animals must be
careful not to fall forward when the camel kneels down.

The way to the temple leads almost due W. from the landingplace, then, turning to the N. (right), skirts the Canal of Edfu and
crosses it by a good new bridge. It then proceeds to the W. through
several streets and finally turns N. again for a short distance. Another route leads straight on from the landing-place, bends to
the right through fields and then traverses the streets of the town
without crossing the canal.

A flight of stops descends to the manaive Pylrms of the temple
