also been found here. According to Mr. Flinders Petrie, the temple
proper, which was 400 ft. wide and had a double colonnade, belongs to the 26th Dynasty.

The village of Bihamu, about 4 M, to the N. of Medineh, was
doubtless once situated on the bank of Lake Moeris. It still contains
some shapeless ruins of ancient origin, destitute of inscription, but supposed to be the remains of the pyramids which according to Herodotus
once stood in the lake. They are now called Km-si Far'an, or chair of
Pharaoh, and resemble dilapidated altars rising above other fragments of
solid masonry. If they were once pyramids, the greater part of them
must have been removed, as the walls are now but slightly inclined
inwards. Distinct traces of the water in which they once stood are to
be seen on their bases, and they are still surrounded by remains of
walls, the purpose of which is unknown

In the fields near Ebgig, or Begig, 21 M, to tho sm 0f MeMmels, lies
a fine Obelisk, broken into two parts, which must have once been at least
46 ft. in height (route to it rough and dirty). Like other obelisks, it is,
horizontally, of oblong rectangular shape, and its summit is rounded.
The inscriptions, which are damaged at many places, inform us that the
monument was erected by Usertesen L, who also founded the obelisk
of Ileliopolis (Vol. L, p. 333), and belonged to the same family (12th Dyn.)
as Amenemha III., the founder of the Labyrinth. - A visit to Bihamu
and Ehgig is chiefly interesting to archaeologists, and perhaps to botanists also.

. EXCURSIoNs. A whole day is required for a visit to the Pyramid
of Hawtrah and the Labyrinth. (horse 10, donkey 5 ft.) The route
leads at first for% hr. along the bank of the Bahr Tiisnf. The first
village of any importance is Uhdfeh. Our path traverses well cultivated land with numerous water-wheels. The corn and cotton
fields are shaded by numerous sycamores, lebheks, palms, and
other trees. About 1/21111 from Uhafeh, and beyond two smaller
villages, we reach a bridge of ancient brick masonry Traversing
the slightly undulating tract a little farther, we reach the Balm
IJel0sWiliCriver without water'), also called el-Bats, a deep channel, extending in a wide curve, and terminating near the N.E. end
of the Birket el-liurrln (p. 43). In winter the water, which trickles down from its lofty banks, forms a few scanty pools. At the
bottom of the channel grow reeds and tamarisks. The S. bank
rises at places nearly perpendicularly to a height of 2 () ft., so that
the sequence of the strata of the soil is distinctly observable. We
now ascend the plateau (the highest in the province, 88 ft. above
the sea level) on which lies Hawkret el-Easab or Huw0ret elMalcht, a considerable village, with a mosque (reached in 1% hr.
from Medinet oi-Fay) The traveller may apply to the Shtikh-elBeled (prefect of the village) for a guide to the pyramid of Jlawisralc
If the water is high, and the canals have to be avoided, we have
to make a circuit of nearly 2 hrs. to the Labyrinth, but by riding
through the water, where necessary, it may be reached in 3/4 hour.

The longer route is preferable, as it passes several relics of
antiquity. A little beyond the village rises the bridge of lfmitir
el-Aglmi, the ten buttresses of which rest on a foundation of massive stone. We continue to ride along an ancient embankment, and
