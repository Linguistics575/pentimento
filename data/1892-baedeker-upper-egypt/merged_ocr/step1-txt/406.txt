described by Herodotus (Ii. 20). Here ended the territory of 12
schoinoi above Elephantine belonging to Isis of Philae, of which
mention is made on the stele of Philometor in the temple-court of
Phila: (Comp p. 300).

On the W. bank, opposite a dark mountain-peak, lies the Temple
of Ofedinah, also called Temple of Jfalurral.cah, after the village of
Nal1aralrah, which lies a little higher up on the E. bank, Dating
from the Roman period, its Greek and demotic inscriptions show it
to have been dedicated to Seraph and Isis. It consisted of an entrance-hall (now destroyed) approached by a broad flight of It steps,
and of a main colonnaded building, 40 ft. long and 50 ft. broad.
Part of the walls has fallen; but 3 columns to the right and 2 to the
left of the entrance still stand, besides 8 columns in the interior.
In the innermost corner, to the right, are traces of a staircase
leading to the roof. A wall connects this temple with a smaller
square structure to the E., on which is a curious representation:
beneath (t tig-tree (lsvoasuzdsuvoa, whence the Greek name of the
place, which was perhaps named Penubs in early Egyptian antiquity) sits a goddess with cow's horns (Isis-lotus) before whom is
a boy with a jug in his hands; above are three other gods. To the
left of this scene is Thoth with the ell; beneath is Isis.

The route now lies between monotonous hills. At Seydleh we
reach the boundary between Widi Kruu'1s and the Wadi el-'Arotb,
which extends to Ibrim, At Mchendi, on the W. bank, are the ruins
of a Roman settlement. The mountains, especially on the E., become higher. At Mali ]: is a picturesque group of hills with groves
of palms. The river makes a wide bend to the W., and we soon
come in sight of the temple of Sebts'ah, 27 M. from Dakkeh.

The Temple of sehit'ah. - Es-Selah or Seba'ah (the lions) "
Wtdi Seba'uh is the site of a temple dedicated to Ammon and Ptah by
Ramses H., and constructed like the temple at Gerf Hus√©n, partly by
excavation in the rock, partly by building. The name is apparently
derived from the avenue of Lions or Sphinxes in front ofthe temple.
Eight ofthese lions with human faces are supposed to have been ranged
on each side, though only the two first have retained their heads. A
