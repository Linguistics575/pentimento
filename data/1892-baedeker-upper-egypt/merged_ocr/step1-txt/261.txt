Doorway of stone (on the S.EO, by which we have to pass, leads into
the temple, at the back of which (N.) are steep rocks. The sanctuary was founded by Ptolemy IV, Philopator 1., and sculptures were
added by others of the house of the Lagidze, and later also by the
Emperor Augustus. The traveller on passing through the doorway
in the outer wall sees on his left an archway ofNile bricks, and
before him the front of the temple of freestone, on which many
Greeks and Copts have written their names. In Christian times it
was used by the monks as a dwvlling-plaee, and to this is due the
mutilation of many of the inscriptions and also its present name
(Der: monastery). We first come to a small hypzethral Antechamber
with2columns, and a few steps further reach the true Ptelemaie entrance of the Nuns This is ornamented by two pilasters with masks
of Hathor, and two Columns with sculptured Calyx-r-aprt-Ms in the
middle, which support the erehitrave and are connected by walls resembling screens (reaching half-way top). Between the pillar is a
semi-portal similar to the one at 3iethuurttfp. 151). The pilasters are
brightly coloured and peculiarly ornamented, with a lotus flower and
a bud on slender stems at the side. Above are Urzeus-serpents with the
crowns ofboth kingdoms, on the left side is an elegant window which
lights a staircase. The inner portion of the temple is in three parts.

and his wife are named as beautrtiers at the temple, and the four
sacred bulls, "apt, Urmerti, Temur, and Abekur, are portrayed. In
the cell to the right is the king before the various gods of the lower
world, and also an astronomical painting, Sethis (Sirius) and Orion.
1n the room to the left, on the left wall, is a remarkable representation of the Judgment of the Dead.

The valley of Dér el-Medineh is rich in Tombs ofvarious periods,
some of them early and of great interest, with the colours of the
paintings marvellously preserved.

Here was discovered the well-known collection of I'apyri, obtained
by A. C. Harris in t Contain w, the famous papyrus of Ramses III. (see
p. I'?.) )), the largest; known, front the archives of the temple of Medinet Hahn.

The earliest tombs here belong to the beginning of the New Eur.

at the Seat of Truth, possibly a college which met at Thir er-Mediml. We may mention the small brilliantly coloured chapel of the
royal scribe, 31mm the similar one of Kth, the tombs orAmenmes,
