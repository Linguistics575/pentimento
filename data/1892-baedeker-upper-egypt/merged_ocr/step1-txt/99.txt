By following the Arab hills we reach, 51/2 M. from Sedfeh, Rdhiueh,
with four large quarries in the hard limestone rock and some tombs of
the old empire with roughly cut Calyx-capitals and ha1f-eCaced sculptures.
Similar tombs are found M 3m » (hiber and De'r. a little to the SE.
Near Jramaniyeh, in the steep side of the rocky hill, are three grottoes,
one above another, containing ancient tombs with inscriptions and representations, belonging to the royal officials Afa and Rakes. In antiquity



the place was named Kwkhthl Q53 (Upper 153111; see below).

141/2 M. Kim el-Kebir, situated in the plain on the E. bank,
is surrounded by a ring of hills, containing roek-tombs with siwlptures and large quarries with some demotie representations. The
few inscriptions refer to the old empire. Stamped bricks found
in the mounds of debris belonged to the buildings of the 18th Dynasty. The quarries contain ornaments and representations of the

toman period. Kan el~Kehir stands on the site of the ancient
Antwopolis, capital of the Antaeopolitan Dome, in which the hero
Antaws and other deities were worshipped. An inscription found
here reads: Await » vat tot; cuwdor; Geek,'to Antmus and his
divine colleagues'. In ancient Egyptian it was called the'Nome
of the two Gods', probably in commemoration of the contest between Seth and Horus. According to the myth Antzeus, son of
Poseidon and Cam, was a giant of immense strength, whom Osiris,
on his journey through the world to introduce the vine and the
culture of grain, appointed his vicegerent over the land bordering
on Ethiopia and Libya. Busiris was governor of the land to the E.
Antmus used his giant's strength to overcome and slay strangers,
and Hercules had to try conclusions with him when he landed in
Libya to steal the cattle of Geryon. After a violent struggle, Hercules surceeded in strangling his huge opponent. The deciding
contest between Typhon (Seth) and Osiris, or rather Horns, son
and representative of Osiris, took place, according to tho version of
the legend adopted by Diodoms, at Anteeopolis, although the inscriptions, and notably the great Horus text of Edfu, relate that the
struggle raged from one end of the Nile valley to the other. The

a
Egyptian name of Ifau was MA Tu kn, or'town of the

lofty mountain', whence is derived the Coptic, Thou. It was also

a
known as D 93 Zez. According to Golenischeff Antasus was an

Egyptian mountain-god (from ant == mountain), whom the Greeks
compared with their Dionysus. A representation of Antaus mentioned by Wilkinson, in which he appears with his hemL like Helios,

surrounded with rays, and accompanied by the goddess Nephthys,
has recently been re-diseevered by Goleniseheft in the NE. angle
