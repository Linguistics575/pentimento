the Egyptian soldiers fell upon the goods that were left behind. Great
booty was captured; and the slaughtered enemies'lay in heaps, like fish
upon the shore'. The hostile camp was taken, and Tutmes built a fort
to restrain the rebellious city. The record of these deeds was inscribed
in a leather-roll and deposited in the temple of Ammon, in the midst of
which we are now standing. The great ones of the land came to beseech
mercy and to bring tribute of silver, gold, Japis-lazuli, and malachite.
They brought also corn and wine, Me, The prisoners numbered Mir,
83 severed hands were reckoned up; and 20111 horses, NI colts, and 6 bulls
were captured. The defeated also lost a chariot inlaid with gold, a golden
chariot-hox, a chariot beautifully inlaid with gold belonging to one of
the allied princes, and 892 war-chariots of their worthless warriors, in
all 924; a beautiful suit of iron mail belonging to one of the kings, and
the armour of the King of Blegiddo; 200 other suits of armour, 502 hows,
and 7 silver-mounted posts from the royal tent of the enemy - The
captured oxen numbered 1929, goats 2000, and sheep 20,500. Other prisoners, inc1uding king' sons, were captured in different strong places, and
were led along behind the Pharaoh, to the number of 2503 Syrian metal
vessels, and other metal-work including swords, were also among the
booty, to a total weight of 178'g ten (10 ketziten =31/5 02.). Of gold and
silver ware there were 9661: Â» and 1 ket. There was also a statue, the
head of which was of gold, ivory, ebony, and sesame-wood (probably cedar),
inlaid with gold. The yield of corn was enormous, amounting to
208,000 iena (t tena = nearly _ bushel) of grain,'hesides what was cut
down and borne off by the soldiers of the king'. The other details of the
tribute we omit. - Then follows, probably for the sake of comparison,
a description of the tribute brought to the king in the doth (21th?) year
of his reign from Syria and Assyria (Assur). - The next portions of the
inscription have been removed and are now in the Louvre, having been
acquired partly by purchase (from the Salt Collection in 1826), and partly
by gift to Prince Napoleon (the portions re-excavated by Mariette, and
published by Lepsius in his Altman" and by Mariette in his Kamal').
These refer to the capture of the towns of Tunep, in the 5th campaign
and 29th year of the king's reign, and Aruthut, in the 6th campaign and
Mus year, in the land of Ruten, with the list of the booty and captives,
including the king's sons and brothers. They also contain lists of booty,
of the 31st year, from the town of An-an-rat on the lake Nes-ro-an, and
of the 33rd year, from the land of Ruten and Naharain (Mesopotamia)
with the town of Ni; the tribute from inhabitants of Ramenen, Sangar
(with real and artificial lapis-lazuli), of the Kheta, Punt, of the 31th year
from the land of Zahi, captured towns, horses, chariots, golden utensil ete., also from the king of Ruten. Asehi (Cyprus) and Rush had also
to pay a high tribute. the latter chiefly in gold. In the 35th year, in his
10th campaign, the king met and defeated the Assyrian army near Ariana.
The records of the remaining campaigns and the lists of booty are still
in their original position The 13th expedition (38th year) was against
the town of Auaugas. and was followed by tribute from Zahi, Aschi,
Arirekh, Punt, and Wawat (to the S. of Egypt); the 14th -campaign
(39th year), against the Shasu and Ruten, was marked by the destruction
of the towns ofArantu and Tunep. Finally appears the command to erect
a memorial tablet of all these victories.

In the same corridor as the above inscriptions, appear representations of the gifts presented to the temple by Tutmes 111.,
including the two obelisks mentioned at p. 133.
