Language. LOWER NUBIA. 303

the hands of the Mohammedans.'Amru ibn el-'A: s conquered Nubia
in the year of the Hegira 20, Dongolah was captured, and a tribute
of slaves imposed upon the Nubians. When Egypt became an independent Mohammedan kingdom under the Fatimite Mu'izz in
969, the Nubians recovered their freedom. In the year of the Hegira
568 (1172 AD.) Saladin's brother captured the citadel of Ibrlm
and plundered the church. Similar disasters followed, and the
people only escaped compulsory conversion to Islam by heavy sacrifiees, the loss of the provinces nearest to Assuin, and the payment of
a poll-tax. The Nubian kingdom now split up into various petty
states, among which Samar, founded in 1484 by the negro-tribs
of the Fungis, rose to importance and held sway over the provinces
of Shendi, Berber, and Dongolah. This, however, was of no long
duration. Dongolah was frequently invaded by the robber tribe of
the Shtgiyeh .---1smattt Pasha, son of jifolyammed'Ali, made himself
master of all these provinces in 1821. He conquered Dongolah without opposition, defeated the Sh√©giyeh at Korti, and acquired Sennar
also. This conquest, however, cost Isma'il his life. At a festival
given by him at Shendi, a hut in which he had been secured was set
on fire, and he and his companions perished in the flames. But this
incident did not prevent the complete subjugation of the Sudan

which was converted into an Egyptian province, with the newlyfounded Rhartyhn as its capital. Dirftr, too, was conquered and
annexed in 1874. But the war with Abyssinia (1875-76), a re colt
in Dttrftr, the rotten state of the Egyptian finances, the rebellion of
Arabi Pasha, the victorious advance of the Mahdi, and the death
of the devoted General Gordon (Jan. 1885) led to the loss of all the
Egyptian possessions to the S. of Wtdi Halfah, in spite of the British
occupation of Egypt (1882) and the belated expeditions to Dongolah
and to Eharttsrn (1884-85). It is but too probable that these districts
will remain beyond the influence of Egypt or of European eivilization for a long time to come.

POPULATION AND LANGUAGE.+ The inhabitants of the upper
valley of the Nile, even from below the first cataract, are called
Bartbra (Berbers) by the Arab population of Egypt. A more accurate name for them is Nubians, and as the aboriginal inhabitants
of Africa they must be distinguished from the Kushite tribes who
immigrated from Asia at a very early period, partly to the N. rid
the isthmus of Suez, and partly to the s., across the straits of Bib
el-Mandel, into N.E. Africa Of these immigrants the former became
the inhabitants of what is now modern Egypt, the latter (also
Kushites according to Lepsius) were the ancestors of the Begah
tribes, who settled to the E. of the Nile between that river and
the Red Sea. The Regal: tribes also include the'Abdbdeh on the N.,
