On the inside of the doorway is the name of Seti 1. (19th Dyn.).
Also in the doorway appears the praying figure of Satan, royal prince
of Rush, who according to the royal cartouche above, served under
Ramses II. The Antechamber itself consists of three rows of pillars,
arranged in three couples on each side, and behind is a row of
proto-Doris (p.12) columns. The side-pillars on the right and left
are connected with the side-walls. Most of the pillars exhibit the
cartouches of Tutmes INK, distinguished from that of Tutmes Ill.
by the three strokes signifying the plural. On the first engaged
pillar to the left Tutmes IV. is mentioned as'beloved by Ra Ichu
kau (OD Q Lth Ll), Usertesen 111., lord of Sekhem', a king of
the 12th Dynasty. On the outer and inner sides of the two architraves over the central pillars are dedication-inscriptions by T11tmes IV. On the N. side of the arehitrave on the right, we read:
'The living good god of the Umna (genuine), who defeated Ethiopia,
brought the boundaries like him who was not created (Ptah), a
brave king with his sword, like Mentu, of a steady heart above many,
he makes the mountains quake'. On the S. side of the left architrave
are the words:'Thoth, lord of divine words, speaks to the great
cycle of gods in Pa 11a (probably the home of the gods): Come,
behold the great and holy monument, carefully hewn, the divine
temple of millions of years, made by King Ra-men-kheper11 (Tutmes W.) for his father Ra-tam, the great god, who made him'. The
inscriptions on the other arehitraves are similar. On the two columns to the left are the names of Tutmes 111. and Amenhotep 11., so
that the columns seem to be older than the pillars and architrave.

The Sekos, beyond the anteehamber, is broad but shallow
[ 241/2 ft. by 61/2). On the outside of the doorway here also
Amenhotep 11. is commemorated; on the inside Seti I. is named as

the restorer (f R swam) of this monument meant for Ammon
Ra and IIarmachis; and over the door on the inside, Tutmes 111.
To the right on the inside of the entrance-wall is Tutmes 111. embraced by Isis, and then Amenhotep II. offering drink-offerings to
Ammon-Ra. On the left Thoth and Hor-Hut straw the symbols of
life over Amenhotep 11. Three doors in the hack-wall of this Sekos
lead into other apartments. The central one enters the Sanctuary,
which occupies the whole of the remaining length of the temple
(about 16 ft.), The doors to the right and left each admit into two
chambers, one behind the other, the front chamber in each case
being the larger. Tutmes Ill. styles himself'beloved by Harmachis
and Ammon-lla' in a three-line inscription over the door of the
sanctuary) it is therefore evident that the temple of'AmMah was
