of Khnusu JI. V), the portal of which we have already seen on our
way from Luxor to the river-front of the great temple of Ammon.
An avenue of sphinxes, approximately parallel with the above-mentioned avenue between Pylon XI and the temple of Muth, leads to
the slender Ptolemaic Pylon XII and beyond it to the temple of
Khumu proper, which lies a little farther N. The temple is beautifully proportioned, in many places adorned with remarkable care,
and in various respects of great interest. It was erected by Ramses III. in honour of Khunsu, i.e. the god who represents, so to
speak, the youthful Ammon in the triad of Thebes. Elsewhere, it
may here be noted, Khunsu is conceived of almost as the moon-god
(with the child's lock of hair on his temple and the creseent-moon
on his head), and thus identified with Thoth-Hermes. Just as
Ammon is called the soul of Ra, so Khunsu is to be regarded as the
spiritual quintessenee of the earlier moon-god, and may be named,
like Thoth,'the representative of the spirit, the ratio internal of all
things'. As Pa ar selcher or'plan-maker' he guides the deliberations
of mortals, and he becomes also the divine physician (Khunsu ne/tr
hotep,'the good helper'), who considerately restores the sick to
health. Cynoeephali, sacred to Khunsu as well as to Thoth, were
kept here. - In the great. Harris Papyrus Ramses III. says of this
temple:'I built a house in Thebes for thy son Khunsu, of good hewn
stone, of sandstone, black stone, its doors covered with gold, adorned
with electrum like the celestial horizon'. In the same document it is
named Pa (house) Ramses [ mic an in Pa It'hunsu with 204 persons;
and afterwards:'Persons whom he (RamsesHIJ gave to Pa Khunsu
in Uas Neferhotep, Hoar lord of the wide heart, 249'. There thus
appear to have been two different temples erected to Khunsu. The
inscriptions inform us that he had not time to finish the'House
of khuusn', but was obliged to leave later rulers to complete the
Peristyle Court and the Pylon. The last was erected by the priestking Pinozem, son of Piankhi, of the 21st Pym but Alexander H.
is also commemorated in the doorway to the peristyle court. This
court itself has on three sides a double row of papyrus-UO columns,
six in eavh row. From the inscriptions we gather that after portions of this building were built by various Ramses of the 20th Dyn.,
the priest-king lierhor, predecessor and perhaps grandfather ofPinoxenl, contributed to its decoration. Most of what we know of the
kings of the Qist Dyn. is derived from the inscriptions here.

The eluse eunnectinn which must at that time have existed between
Asia and the Nile valley is proved by a Stale, found in the temple of
Khunsu and now preserved in the Bihliotbicupte Rationale at Paris. Upon
this one of the last k us or the Cloth Dyn. records that he married the
daughter of a tributary prince, made her his queen, and in order to cure
her younger sister who was possessed by devils (tie. insane) sent iirst a
physician and then a statue obeuusu tu Bckhten. After the healing god had
done what was expected of him, the father-in-law of the Pharuah detained

the statue until he was warned in a dream to send it back to Egypt in
its sacred boat.

The peristyle court is succeeded by a narrow Hull, extending
