236 Route 22. EL-KAH. From Thebes

bis. 0n the W. bank stretches a broad and fertile plain, on the
E. is the finely shaped Gebel Sheroneh. At el-flaw?, on the E. bank,
appears the first sandstone.

On the W. bank, about 3/4 hr. farther to the S., is the pyramid of
el-Kulah, which now presents the aspect of a step-pyramid, owing to the
decay of the filling-in material. The entrance was on the W. side. In
spite of its ruinous condition it is still about 30 ft. high, while its base
occupies an area about 55 n. square. Maspero recently carried on excavations here, which injured the building without yielding any important
result. As there are no inscriptions it is difficult to determine the date
of its construction.

18 M. El-Kab, on the E. bank, the ssucientEileithyU. The
station of the four week steamers (from U ann. to 211,111.) and of
the mail-steamer is at Baguliyeh, properly t Frrl? hiyeli.

An old ferrsip appears to promsr his sew es as soon as a Maha,
hiyeh lauds. He is well-informed and provides donkeys, though with very
poor saddle-cloths.

Balt-a-day suffices for a flying visit to the following: 1. the
'U? uins of the ancient town; 2. the Rock fnseriptiomr; 3. the *Chupel
of Amenhotep 111.; 4. the Rack Tempe! of the Ptolemies; and 5. the
'Tombs. If so much time cannot be spared, the last should at least
be visited. The various monuments may be visited in the above
order as follows. We skirt the boundary wall of the ancient town,
which is distinctly visible, then turn to the E. to (3/shr.jan isolated
hill, rising from the plain, on the right side of which are most of the
rock-inscriptions. At the end of this valley we turn a little to the
left to reach the chapel ofAmenhotep 111., with four columns in
the interior. We here turn round, and following the S. wall of the
more northerly chain of hills, reach the steps which lead to the
roek-temple. We may then visit the small temple of Theth (called
by the Arabs ei-rrmnvirrt,'the bath'), or proceed to the tombs,
about 1 M. from the river.

The now vanished town of chent was called by the Greeks
Eileithyin or Lcucotheu (Pliny), and in the inscriptions the Fortress

Hebertt J, often with the surname of CED'the white toum'.

The interpretation of the name of the city and its goddess as Nekheb
and Suben is probably wrong. The *GiRULE WALL is in excellent
preservation, and encloses a square the sides of which are 700 yds.
long, with a total circumference of 2800 yds. The wall itself is of
immense thickness, 37 ft. or as wide as a considerable street, and
is built of huge sun-dried Nile-bricks. The savants of the French
Expedition estimated that the ancient town accommodated 10,000
inhabitants. Visitors should not omit to mount the broad ascent to
the top of the wall on the W. side, from which a good survey of the
tombs on the N. hill-chain is also obtained. Apparently only the
temples and public buildings, the'inner city', stood within thewalls,
while various suburbs stretched beyond them; though in times of
danger the entire population found refuge within the ramparts. The
