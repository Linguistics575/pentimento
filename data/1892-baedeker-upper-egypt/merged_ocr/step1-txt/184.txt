120 Route 11. I (ARNAK. East Bank

We may mention here in anticipation that the roof of the following hypostylehall was supported by a perfect forest of papyrus-bud
columns, through the midst of which a broad passage was marked
by calyX-columns, closely resembling the detached pairsof columns
in the tirst court (comp. p. 126). At this point we first obtain a
clear idea of the arrangement of this portion of the temple, and the
same remark applies also to all the rooms between it and the sanetuary. It should also be remembered that the number of those
privileged to follow and behold the procession gradually decreased
from room to room as the sanctuary was approached. Headed by
the king or chief priest, the crowd of priests, bearing the standards,
symbols, and images of the gods, passed through the doorway of the
first pylon into the peristyle court. The double row of calyxcapitals served at once to indicate their passage and to mark the
limits beyond which the pious spectators must not press. The
sacred procession rolled on slowly beneath the shade of the velarinm
and entered the hypostyle hall through the second pylon. Many of
those who were permitted to enter the first court had there to quit
the procession and to take up their positions to the right and left
of the calyx-columns. Others again were not permitted to advance
farther than the hypostyle, and so with each room until the sanetnary was reached. To this tlay'the clearly defined passage thither
may be traced, and it will be observed that at each successive stage
the place appointed for those who had to quit the procession is
smaller than the preceding





LA'nm Anhnmxs IN THE PERISTYLE COURT.

1. The Small Temple of Seti II. Merenptah (Pi. h), in the
NE. angle of the court, to our left as we enter by the tirst pylon.
This building, which has only recently been made partly accessible,
is built of grey sandstone, except beside the three doors, where a
reddish quartzose sandstone has been used. The figure of the god
Seth has everywhere been erased from the name of the builder. Only
a small portion of the walls is entirely sculptured; and the I'e-.
presentations that are still extant show that the temple was dedicated
to the Theban triad, Amman, Muth, and Khnnsn. In the chamber
entered by the W. (left) door appears the sacred boat of the goddess
Mirth, to whom Seti Merenptah, accompanied by his son, offers a
libation. The richly dressed boy is called'royal prince' and'heir
to the erown'. Adjacent is the tigure of the helmeted Pharaoh,
presenting the image of the goddess of truth to Ammon and Khnnsu.

2. The Temple of Ramses m. LPI. C), dedicated to Amman,
interrupting the S. wall of the peristyle court.

The great Harris Papyrus, which is euiefly concerned with the erection
and equipment of temples, details no fewer than six buildings and five
estates in the vicinity of Thebes, distinguished by the terms Hat (temple),

Pa (house), Menmenu (pasture), adding after each one of the two names
of the king and frequently also an additional name, such as'thy victory
