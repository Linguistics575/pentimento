Guarani. Until a few years ago Korusko was the chief emporium
and port of shipment for the caravans croving the desert to or from
Abu Hamed, which lies 8-10 long days' journey distant (see below).
This road avoided the three upper cataracts. which are not navigable
when the river is low, and it also shortened the journeyconsiderably
by cutting "the windings of the Nile. Russegger, Lepsius, and
finally Gordon (1884) selected it on their way to Kharttirn. A short
excursion along this desert-route, between the hills, black with
iron-scale, is not uninteresting; 01' the traveller may ascend 0/2 hr.;
steep and stony) the hill of Auurs el-Chtarttni, close to Kent. On
the summit is the tomb of the saint to whom the hill owes its
name, a frequented pilgrim-resort. The view extends over the Nile
valley as far as Den: A fort has recently been erected by the British at Kent k0. On the bank of the river is a coffee-house.

The desert route from Korusko to (227NO Abu Hamed and Berber is
described in Lepsius's Letters from Egypt and Ethiopia (see p v). From
Abu Hamed to Berber the hire of camels was formerly BJ piasters each,
afterwards increased to 80 and 90 p. Among the stages on this route are
ei-Bib, a range of sandstone hills extending for two days' journey; Balir
belah mah with its greenish fine-grained rocks continuing the preceding;
Baty' Hagab; and dei Delah, where dthn-palms are found. The route
intersects the Gebel Raft by means of the Wadi es-Sufr, with a few indiarubber stud gunt-treee, and then the Gebel Seneydr by means of the Ifrddt'
Marat. The last, the half-way point, contains some brackish water, the
only water met with on the entire route, and a few huts. Next follows
the wide plain of 21 Jhindemh, bounded by the lofty hills of Abe Siztah then
the stony hills of Adar Au": and the boundless plain of Adererdd, which
extends to Abu Hamed, with the low Gebel Farm on the left, and the
Gebel Mokran on the right. Mirages, called by the Arabs Barr Shet'hin or
'waters of Satan, are frequently seen on the way. Abu Earned on the me
is reached on the 8th, or at latest on the 10th

A little beyond Korusko the Nile valley trendstotlieN.W., so that
the N. windwhich prevails in winter frequently retards navigation. On
the left bank rises a picturesque chain of hills. In this reach travellers have a chance of seeing crocodiles, which frequent the sandbanks and lay their eggs in the clefts of the shore. Recently, however, they have become somewhat rare. On the W, bank the
inconspicuous Temple of'Amadah, S M. from Korusko, comes in
sight. It lies deeply sunk in the desert sand, while on the opposite
bank a cultivated strip with many trees stretches between the river
and the hills. Passengers by Cook's steamers have an opportunity of
visiting this temple.

The Temple of'AmMah has a very unpretending exterior and
seems at first hardly worthy of a visit. Yet it is in reality of great
interest both for scientific and ordinary traveller, as an excellent example of the graceful and elegant architecture of the 18th Dyn., under which it was built. Nothing is left of the front of the entrancehall except the doorway; and the structure of Nile bricks adjoining
the latter indicates that the temple has been used as a mosque or
as the tomb ofa saint. (A Mohammedan cupola, removed only a few
years ago, was an additional proof.) On the right side of the door
