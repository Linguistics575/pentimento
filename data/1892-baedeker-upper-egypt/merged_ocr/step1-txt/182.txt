The building is at once a temple of the gods and a temple of fame;
dedicated'i toute < les gloires' of the empire of the Pharaohs, it was
compelled to receive additions, often in most unsuitable places,
whenever it was the will of the king to recognize the favours of
Autumn by new buildings which should record for posterity what
the god had done for him, and through him for Egypt.

Before we enter the peristyle ecurt, an inscription on the door of the
pylon, to our right as we enter, merits notice. This was placed here by
the savants who accompanied the army of Napoleon to Egypt, and records

the latitude and longitude of the chief temples of the Pharaohs, as calculated by them.

This monument of untiring and successful diligence deserves to be
greeted with respect; it contrasts with the execmble taste of the idle
tourists who have scribbled over and defaced inscriptions within the
temple, with their own insignificant names Opposite the French table
an Italian learned society (Feb. 9, 1841) have erected another showing
the variation of the compass (ilety1inazione dell' ago magneticnl as h). V
The inscription is signed Warina genio' etc.

b. The Great Peristyle Court and its Additions.

The great *Peristyle Court (PI, A) is believed by important
authorities to have been built by the rulers ofthe 20nd Dynastyt
The oldest part of the temple is the sanctuary (p. 134), situated
much farther to the E. Probably the clearest view of the growth
and historical development of the great house of Amman would he
obtained by beginning there and thence visiting the later portions
in the order of their erection; but in following out this plan we
should be obliged to diverge irregularly hither and thither from the
main lines, and so would miss much of the effect designed by the
builders. The influence of the god was supposed to radiate from
within outwards; while the procession ofhis adorers advanced slowly
towards Amman from without inwards. The sanctuary was the final,
unapproaohable goal of the pious, few of whom were permitted to
penetrate farther than the peristyle court. The hypostyle hall was
indeed open to certain privileged worshippers, but only the'initiated' were allowed to approach any nearer to the holy of holies. That
sacred chamber itself might only be entered by the high-priest and
the king, the representative of the god upon earth. The arrangement of the peristyle and succeeding chambers indicate in the
clearest manner the nature of the services celebrated within them
