the E. of Widi Nalriin (comp. the Map at the beginning of Vol. L) are
four Coptic Monasteries, a visit, to which is interesting. The monasteries
owe their origin to Macarms of Alexandria (d. 301), a hermit who first
retired to the Thehan desert in 335, and afterwards, about 373, took up
his abode in a lonely cell in this spot. He was the founder of an order
that won numerous disciples. The monks fast all the year round, except
on Sundays and between Easter and Whitsuntide, RtMrstts mentions fifty
monasteries of asceties, who numbered 5000 in all. In the year 800 the
ruined monastery of St. Macarius was repaired and fortified by J9vtutius,
patriarch of Alexandria. The next most interesting monastery is that of
Syridni, built by a saint named Homzes nr Johannes the dwarf. It has
30-40 monks and 3 churches. Curzon and afterwards Tattam and Pawn,
who visited the monastery twice, here found most valuable collections
of Syrian MSS., acquired between 1810 and 1850. These 1188., in 371
vols., of which the oldest are one by Ettubius nr Edussa (ill A'0 and
twelve of the 6th cent, included the Theophany and other writings of
Eusehius of Caesarea, the Recognition" of Clemens, a treatise against the
Nanicheeans by Titus of Basra, etc. This monastery contains also an
Abyssinian college with a library.-There is little chance of discovering
any more valuable MSS. here, as all except those required for the religious
services have been transferred to the library of the Coptic patriarch
at Cairo.

A visit to the remaining monasteries, of Baramus (Coptic liturgical
MRS) and Ambn Biskhai, with three small churches, scarcely repays the
trouble. and is not recommended on account of the vermin. - Interesting accounts of these and other monasteries in the Levant are enntained in R. Curzon's Visits to the Monasteries in the Levant (London,
1849), and in 1lurrtresrtre" s Némuires Géogruphiqncs, Yo: I pp. 451 seq.
(Paris, 1811).













IL The Cases of Bahriyeh and Faréfrah.

The visit to the oasis of Bahriyeh (the. Northern Oasis), called by
. rahn asu'sspa.'the Second", and by Ptolemy Jaotcptxpt'r,'the Small Oasis',
is of interest only to the naturalist, for its antiquities are few and 1111important. The. latter include a small Roman triumphal arch (Cailliaud,
) and a Male of the reign of Tutmes Ill., besides
the scanty remains of a temple at Batrili (Asch _

in a cliff to the W. suggest that there was at one time a Christian
settlement here. The oasis which has only 3'20 inhah., has been since

by Mohammad Sendai of Algiers (Vol. L, p. 67). The people are suspicious

less difftueult than that to the oasis of Jupiter Ammon, and it may be,
combined with a visit to Dakhel. El-Rhiirgeh may be reached in h-5
