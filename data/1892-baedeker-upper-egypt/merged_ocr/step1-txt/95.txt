railway and the villa of s1fal.1rmli1 Bey, and then passes the tomb of
a shékh, where a draught of good water is offered to the traveller
by a dervish. A number of dry ditches must be crossed, and also
several canals, where the traveller on horseback will hardly escape
from wetting his feet when the water is high; if he rides on a
donkey, he should get the Arabs to carry him and his saddle across.
The fields which we pass are remarkably well cultivated, and the
eye rests with pleasure on trees of various kinds, including fine
olives in the gardens, with hedges of cactus. The vegetation is most
luxuriant in the neighbourhood of Fidmtn, a village pieturesquely
situated on a slope, but inhabited by a thievish population. The
Ruhr (.'rnill river'), one of the broader canals, must be
crossed here. Beyond this point the country is, at places, green and
well irrigated, and at others dry and sterile. One part of the route,
which is tlanked by luxuriant gardens of olives, pomegranates, and
figs, is very muddy. After a ride of fully three hours we reach the
inch: and the bridge Kamifir Hasan. The large body of water of
the canal. which is conducted from the Baht Ytesuf, here falls into
a channel, which, with many ramifications, conveys it to the fields
of Sputhrir.

The large village of tjenhttr (rail. station, see p. 4%) lies on the
border of the second plateau of the province. Those who visit Hawtrah (p. 38) reach the first plateau, while the second is crossed on
the way to Senhl'ir; the third lies at our feet when looking down on
the Birket el-Iiartnl from the great Kan, i.e. the rain-strewn hill
to the N. of the village. The handsome house of the Shéhh elBeled offers good accommodation, and even quarters for the night.
The traveller should make a bargain here for a boat with the shékh
of the fishermen. About 30 fr. for the day, and a hahshish for the
rowers (id whom 6-8 are necessary for speed), are demanded.

Fenhir stands on the site of an ancient, and not unimportant,
town, of which large heaps of ruins still remain. toman walls are
traceable in many places. A large building has recently been excavated by the peasants for the sake of obtaining the hard bricks
of which it is built, but part of it has already been removed. No
remains of columns or inscriptions have been met with.

From Senhiir to the Rirket er.Kuron takes about 11/2 hr. The route
leads thrmigh sugar-plantatinns. We reach the lake near the peninsula
known as eer'ezireh, on which stands a heap of ruins. A short distance
to the w. are the scanty remains of eZ-Hamnuim. The traveller, after
having ridden to the lake, should not forget to order his horses, Which
return to swim, to await him for the return-journey at the spot where

he has quilted them. or to order them to meet him in good time on the
bank of the lake by Nezieh (see p. 42).

The Birket eI-Kunm Clake oi the horns') owes its name to
its shape, which resembles that of slightly bent eows' horns. It
measures M M. in length, and, at its broadest part, is about 61/e M.
wide. It is situated on the same level as the Mediterranean, and
its depth averages 13 ft. The greenish water is slightly brackish
