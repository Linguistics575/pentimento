This was probably a lunar eclipse i. In the left wing, on the N.
wall, Ammon appears presenting Osorkon I. with the notched
staff of years and the sword of victory; beneath, the king drinks
the milk of life from the breast of Hathor; and adjacent is Osorkon as a youth with the crown, to whom Khmrm hands the symbol
of life.

Before proceeding on our way towards the sanctuary, we must
inspect a most important historical monument which owes its origin
to Sheshenk l. (the Shishuk of the tible) 7 founder of the dynasty
of the flubastites. This is on the outside of the s. Walt ofthe temple
of Ammon, and is easily found. Issuing from the doorway of the
Portico of the Pn1bastites, we turn to the left, and immediately tind
ourselves in front of this important representation. The massive form
of tho king, wearing the double crown, appears brandishing his
weapon over a band of foes with pointed beards, who raise their arms

the double feather onhis head, grasping in his right hand the sword

head. In her left hand she holds a bow and arrow, in her right a
battle-axe and six papyrus cords, which unite five rows of names of
towns, surmuunted by busts. These are the names of places besieged
and captured by Shesheuk in his campaign against Ilehoboam, and
we have thus a collateral corroboration ofthe Biblical narrative, such
as has not been found for any other portion of the Old Testament.

The Biblical passages are as follows: [ Kings NIV, 25-26:'And it came
to pass in the hfth year of king Ilehohoam, that tihishak king of Egypt
came up n, ninst Jerusalem: And he took away the treasures ofthe house
of the Lord. and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away
all; and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made'.
Qua Chron. A L, 2-1 & 9: And it came to pass, that, in the Mth year of
ltehobnam, Hhishak king of Egypt. came up against Jerusalem because
they had transgressed against the Lord, With twelve hundred chariots,
and thr0cseore thousand horsemen; and the people were without number

, It reads thus:'In the year Me..... the heavens did not swallow
the moon'. This may possibly refer to the appearance of a new moon
on the night immediately succeeding the last appearance of the old moon,
without the usual intervention of a moonless night - a phenomenon
which is possible in certain exceptional circumstances. But if. as Goodwin suggests, instead of, ._.._ I is to be taken, it would read
"In the year ele.... the heavens swallowed the moon", and we slmutd
have a direct mention of a lunar eclipse.
