such a staircase, the name of which is in each case given, followed
by as full a description of the room in question and of what took
place there, as space will allow. Prof. Diimichen uncovered the
inscription at the foot of the exterior wall of the temple in 1875
(p. 97 ], and found that, as at Edfa, the names and dimensions of
the chambers lying to the north were inscribed on the N. side, and
on the S. side those of the chambers lying to the south. He has
published the inscription with a translation i.

In our description, we begin with the Hypostyle Hall or *Khent
Ball (PL E). The first large hall of an Egyptian temple frequently

here the name Khent, i.e.front room, as is the easehere, at

El
Edfu, at Philae, and elsewhere. It has several other names as well.
Apparently with reference to the astronomical representations which
adorn both halves of the ceiling, it is frequently named in the in
C) a X
scriptitms ii=7d UEO'Nul usekh ur t Le. Great Hall of

the Goddess Nut, who as the symbol of the vault of heaven was represented as a tall woman bending her face towards the earth and
letting her arms hangdown f' I, A colossal representation of this

figure is met with twice on the ceiling of the hypostyle room at
Denderah, and it is repeated twice mate in the apartment marked
NY. on the plan and in the central Osiris-room on the N. side of
the temple-roof. In the two last instances it occupies the entire
surface of the ceiling. Astronomical representations, whether simply
golden stars scattered promiscuously on a blue ground, or actual
copies of the constellations as seen at some particular time, have
been adopted as a suitable ceiling-decoration in nearly every Idgyptian temple and tomb. The two names above given are by far the
commonest for this first room, but it is also called'the seat of Osiris,
Horus, and Isis', and it is named in the inscriptions'the dwelling
of Hathor, the house of the sistrum-playing, the house in which the
tambourine is sounded, the seat of the rapture ofjoy, the birthplace of the celestial goddess Nat'. The hall is 143 ft. broad, 80 ft.
deep, and about 50 ft. high.

On festal occasions the image of the goddess was conveyed in her
boat to this Hall of Heaven, to meet there the sun-god, her father.
The decorative designs in this room chiefly consist, after the ancient
Egyptian custom, of representations of the royal builders of the
temple. The Roman emperors Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius,
and Nero are in turn depicted, each hearing some dedicatory gift
for IIathor or some other of the gods worshipped at Denderah. The
central wall-spaces between the columns to the right and left of the
main portal are each occupied with four designs, referring to the
