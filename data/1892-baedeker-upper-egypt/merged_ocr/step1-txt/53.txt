Visitors to the Cun may regain eLWsttah ou the following day at
10.15 am, or at 4.16 p.m., by leaving Nedinet el-Faytun at 9 am or
2.53 pan. An extra day allows a visit to the Labyrinth and the Pyramid
of Hawiirah (p. 39). In this case the dhahabiyeh should not be sent on in advance, but should be ordered to await the traveller's return .--The pyramid and tombs of lEddm may also be visited from el-Wastah (see 11.2).

A small canal, beginning meat the village of Zciwiyeh (W. bank),

runs out of the Nile into the Balm Yteaf (p. 28).

Farther up, in the latitude of Altmis el-Medineh and Benisuéf, there
seems to have been another deep channel connecting the [ river with the
Bahi- Yrtsuf. These four channels enclosed an inland which has been ideutitiéd with the Heracleopolitan Nome, unanimously described hy Greek authorities as an island. Straho, who visited it on his way to the Faythn,
afterleaving the nome of Aphroditopolis, calls it'a large island', and relates that in the city of 1ierae1eopo1is the ichneumon was worshipped,
the deadliest me of the crocodile, held sacred in the neighbouring nome
of Arsinoii; for, he tells us, it crawls down the throat of the sleeping
monster and devours its entrails. The large mounds of debris at Alpttis elIfedineh, the Umm cl-Kimdm ('mother of rubbish-heaps') of the Arabs, have
been identified with Hevaeleopo1is; they lie 11 M. to the w. (inland) of
The old name of the town was Khinensu, from which A (mds is
derived through the Coptic Hues. The ram-horned god Horshaf, the
prince of terrors, was also worshipped here. A few columns still stand,
here, and other monuments may be buried under the debris. Systematic
excavations are to he undertaken. At present Ahuas need scarcely be
visited except by those who approach the Fay1hn from Benign".

On the W. bank the mountains recede a little from the Nile,
but on the E. bank their steep and lofty spurs frequently extend
down to the bank in rising picturesque forms. None of the Nile-.
villages before Beuisuéf need be mentioned. On the E. bank stands
the Coptic convent of Mar Antonius (see p. 4). About 2M. inland
(right) from Ztttn (W. bank) lies the hamlet of Bash (rail. stat.,
p. o, which is inhabited by Copts and thus has some interest for
those who wish to study these direct descendants of the ancient
Egyptians in a community of some size.

Benis.utd, on the W. bank, the first place in Upper Egypt (rail.
stat., p. 1; stat., l" M. from the Nile), is a town off0,000 inhahY
pleasantly situated between the railway and the river. It contains
a post and telegraph office and is the capital of a province of the
same name, which contains 169 villages and about 920,000 inhabitants. To the left of the rail. station is the Mudiriyeh, or residence
of the mudir or governor. The houses or rather huts of this provincial capital are, however, constructed merely of Nile mud. The linenmanufacture for which this place was celebrated in the middle ages
has greatly declined, but there are several sugar-plantations and a
small bazaar. To the left of the railway is a fine grove of palms.

A road which was much frequented before the completion of the railway, leads from Benituéf into the Faydm (p. M), and travellers with a
tent and plenty of time might still hire camels, asses, or horses here and
proceed to Medinet el-Faygm viit el-Lahan ('gate of the Faytun0, where the
Ruhr Tiisuf enters the Faytun, and Hawdrah. By using the railway for the
returnvjuurney and giving up Birketellur0n, this excursion can be made
in 34 days. _
