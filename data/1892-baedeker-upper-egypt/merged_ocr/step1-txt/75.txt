mighty prince both in war and peace, was a pious worshipper ofAmmon,
whose name, indeed, forms part of his own (Amen-hotep). Amenhutep IV.,
on the other hand, turned his hack on his father's religion and on the increasingly spiritual conception of Ammon (the'Hidden One') and the other
ancient gods. discarded his name'Peace of Ammon', became exclusively
a snn-Worshipper, and named himself Khu-en-aten, i.e.'Refleetion of the
Sun's Dise'. It is an interesting but doubtful question whetherAmenhophis IV., in bis r610 nf reformer, intended to resuscitate, as'a patriotic
restorer of the old cult', the simple san-worship from which the religion
of the Egyptians had originally taken its rise; or whether he was moved
by the Semitic iufluenees, which are so noticeable all over the country
after the expulsion of me Hv sus, to become an adorer of the orh ofday
and to introduce a religious ceremonial that recalled the practices of the
Asiatic courts rather than the more dignified usages oflhe'Sublime lame
of Egypt. Portraits of historical personages often cast a clearer light on
their character than piles of written documents, and the numerous representations of Amenhotep IV. encuuntered in these tombs show that he
was a sickly man, a fanatic, and an enthusiast. [ The purtrait-statue of
him in the Louvre suggests similar conclusions. ] He also, as the inscriptions inform us, stood under the influence of his mother, who was
not of royal birth and seem: to have Encouraged her son's tendency to
prefer the old popular religion to the elaborately developed creed of the
priests. His work was distinctly reactionary and Cunld not long survive
him. Almost everywhere we see his successors scratching out his name as
a sign of their disapproval and contempt. Where it still stands intact we
may conclude that it was overlooked. The fact that the portrait-like
reliefs of men in these tombs, as well as the horses and buildings, appear
more true to nature than in any other Egyptian monument may be due
to the greater liberty of divergence from the hieratie canon allowed in a
reign which was so unfavourable to the priestly dogmas. These reliefs
excited the special admiration of the Greeks. A Hellene who visited them
inscribed his name as admiring the art of the priestly stone-cutters

of Tell el-Amarnah, Khu-en aten also built a large Benben or temple at
Thebes, the blocks of Which we-e used for the pylon of King Horus. He
also erected a temple in Heliopolis, the remains of which are still extant,
and probably another in Memphis. He is himself depicted on a pylon in
Soleb (Nubia).

Quite recently a new light has fallen on the history of Amcnhotep IV.
and his predecessor through the discovery of several hundred tablets with
cuneiform inscriptions in the large Temple, "rath Palace, of Tell elAmaruah "r, which narrate the intercourse of the Kings of Babylon with
Amenhotep III. and Amenhutep IV. To the former Ring Dushratta of )" tanui gave his daughter Tadukhepa in marriage; and her dowry is stated
on one of the tablets. Other tablets contain letters from Pale, tine and
Syrian vassal: to the King of Egypt, and diplomatic notes from King
Burnabnriash to Amenhotep 1V., concluding a treaty of peace and as ing

at Gizeh.
