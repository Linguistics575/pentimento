228 Route 91. THEBES. West Bank:

has given its name to the place. To the left are the remains of
other rooms. The name of Ramses 1L, inserted by himself as a
correction, should be noticed; behind are offerings for the dead. The
line roof is not a true vault, the stones lying horizontally and being
but out. The colours are fresh; to the right and left of the door
are Tutmes HL and Tutmes IL; over the door 4 bulls. - Ascending 3i steps further we reach another granite doorway also built
by Tutmes 111., through which we enter avault sprinkled with stars.
This last rests against the wall of rock which rises above Dir elbahri, without being cut into it. A second archway with 2 side-.
niches leads deeper into the mountain, and there is a third unvaulted
room which was constructed under Tutmes L of the 18th Dynasty,
but appropriated by a distinguished official named Amenhotep,
under Ptolemy Euergetes IL, and his wife Cleopatra. The inscriptions of this later period compare very disadvantageously with
those of the time of the Tutmes kings.

From the N. side of the third terrace it is possible to creep into the
Burial Chapel, half tilled with rubbish, which is supported by 12 eighteensided columns in four rows, and contains two empty sarcophagus-chests.
On the inner wall are Anubis and offerings for the dead. This is followed
by a vaulted Clmmber the arch of which is pointed, and from this a similarly vaulted Passage runs "at a right angle, to the W. of which is a
very small Room, also vaulted in the same way. We thus find three vaulted
rooms, each smaller than the preceding. In front of this arrangement of
tombs there was a building of which there now remains (on the right
as we leave the tombs) a Colonnade with 7 eighteen-sided columns, bearing an architrave, the astragal, and the concave cornice. These rooms are
much choked up, and full of fragments ofmummies, and linen rags. In
later times they were used as a common burial ground. The same fate
from the 26th Dyn. onwards betel the rooms at the end of which is the
fine picture of the Hathor Cow (p. 227); but these are now kept clean and
easily accessible.

0n the fourth terrace also pictures of a procession have been preserved. Of the row of ships nothing is left but the water-lines below them,
but it is from here that a picture of a ship now in the Berlin Museum
was taken, with an accompanying inscription telling us that the Procession
was arranged by Tutmes III. in honour of Tutines II.

At no great distance from DÃ©r el-bahi-i there is a roughly worked
passage cut, only about 3ft. high and scarcely accessible, which was explored by Ebers. It leads into a sepulchral chamber, entirely covered
with semi-hieratic inscriptions, in which was buried a princess named
Nefru, a favourite, and perhaps the mother of a princess Hatasu belonging
to the early period of the New Empire or, according to Naville, to the
11th or 12th Dynasty.

This neighbourhood should not be quilted without a visit to the shaft
from which the famous royal mummies were obtained. In order to reach
it we walk over the heaps of sand to the right at the foot of Der el-hahri
(or we may take an easier path from the village and tombs of Shekh
rAhd el-Kurnah down the snipe to the west). In scarcely IO min. we em
in front of a narrow chasm in the rock, up which there is a steep climb
for 51ninutes. Above is the Shaft, 61t.square, descending perpendicularly
for 38ft. A strong rope and great caution are necessary in order to be
let down At the bottom is an entrance 5 ft. wide and 3 n. high which
leads in a straight direction m YA ft. This passage then turns to the right
in it Me. direction for the length of more than 195 It, its height yaryIng from 6 to 13 ft. To the right five or six rude steps lead to a niche.
