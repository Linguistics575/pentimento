Half of the figures have been deliberately defaced.

The Ascent of the Pylons, commanding an excellent view of the whole
island and its surrounding, is made from the peristyle court entered by
the central portal. Within this portal, to the right, is the following Ia-.

the names of the brigadier-generals. - The staircase leading to the top
of the'East Tower begins in the small chamber (Pl. c), in the S.E, corner
at the peristyle court. It ascends gradually, round a square newel, Several unadorned chambers, probably used for the storing of astronomical
instruments and for the use of astrologers, are to be found within the
tower. They are feebly lighted by window-openings, decreasing in size
towards the outside wall. - The West Tower can only be reached from
the E. tower. The crosses on the stones of the roof formerly held braces
of wood or iron.

Two Obelisks and two Lions, all of granite, formerly stood before the entrance. The foot of the W. obelisk is all that remains of
the former; the latter lie much damaged on the ground. Numerous
Greek Inscriptions have been carved here by pilgrims. -Adjoining
the SE. side of the pylon is the beautiful Gateway (Pl. G) of Ptolemy IL Philadelphus, who appears on its E. side. On its W.
wall, to the right and left, is the emperor Tiberius, above, Philadelphus,

d. The Inner Peristyle (Pl.I), bounded on the S by Pylon H.,
is bounded on the N. by another Pylon (Pl. K). These, however,
are by no means parallel to each other, while the edifices to the
E. and W. of the peristyle are so entirely different, that it is at

the most varied forms, must be described as unusually effective.
On the E. and W. are two oblong edifices, each with columns on
the side next the court. That to the W. (left) is a distinct temple,
forming a kind of peripteros; that to the E. was used by the
priests. This court, which is mostly uneven, contains one spot excellently adapted for the pitching of a tent. Cook's parties usually
lunch here; if there are more than one party at the same time, the

e. The Temple to the W. of the Peristyle (Pl. L) stands immediately behind the left (W) wing of the first pylon, and a doorway in the latter o.287) lies exactly opposite the S. Entrance
Door (Pl. d) of the temple, from which it is separated only by a
narrow open passage. At the N. end of the colonnade on the side
of the temple next the court is a side-entrance. The S. door admits to a Pronaos with 4 columns, of which two are engaged in
the portal. Beyond lies a Calla with three chambers, surrounded
on three sides by a colonnade. This temple was founded by Pto
