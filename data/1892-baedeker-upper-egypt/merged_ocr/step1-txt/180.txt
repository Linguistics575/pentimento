beholder by the building now, ruined but with its whole plan and
theory still clear and intelligible There is nothing now to distract
the eye from the lines and forms of the temple; and the pomp of
banners and the clouds of incense are replaced by the magic of
dignified antiquity. Amidst these hoary ruins, we realize the shortness of our mortal span and recognize the evanescence of human
greatness and splendour.

Starting from the great pylon ot' the temple of Luxor, "e preceed to the E., then follow the street with the Greek shops, and
leaving the houses of the ghawézi and the hill with the tomb of
the shékh to the right, hold towards the N. We soon arrive at the
first ruins of Karnak, and finally, if we have followed the W. route,
reach an imposing row of ACriosphinxes, i.e. sphinxes with the bodies of lions and the heads of rams. r this point, to the S. of
the temple, are two almost parallel Processional Avenues t1ankeil
with sphinxes, one uniting the temple of Muth (p. 148) vith the
S. pylons (p. 147), the other leading from the temple of Liner to
the temple of Khunsu (p. 148). These two avenues were connected
with each other by a third cross-avenue of sphinxes. We follow
the left (W.) avenue, the flanking sphinxes of which are carved in
the grand style and are placed close to each other. Between the legs
of each is a statuette with the name of Ameuhotep Ill. (Ra-ma-neb).
This leads us to the handsome but almost too slender Pylon XII,
erected by Ptolemy Ill. Euergetes L, with a winged sun-disc in the
easement, with boldly-spread pinions. In the time of the Lagidae
additional pylons, corresponding to this one, were placed at the extreme corners of the temple. That on the N. side (p. 143) is still in
admirable preservation. Inside the portal Energetes is represented
in Egyptian style th nigh clad in Greek costume. To the right of
the lowest representation 01: the left side, the king appears sacrificiug to Khunsu Between these are the hawk of Horus, the vulture of Nekheb, and the ibis of Thoth, which are also represented
tlying, to bear to the world intelligence of the battles, victories, and
wisdom of the prince. The inscriptions record that this pylon was
dedicated to Khunsu of Thebes. Another avenue of sphinxcs
follows, beyond which rises the Temple of Khuns-u (P1. Y.), a handsome building on which, however, we now bestow only a passing
glance (comp, p. 148). About 200 paces towards the W. bring us
to the First Main Pylon (et-W, el-keUr), which faces the river. We
here begin our description of the temple.

As we stand before the massive pylons of the largest group of
buildings at Karnak, we may cast a glance at the rows ofHiriosphinses
which led from the temple-portal to the Nile. ietween these rows
