300 LOWER NUBIA. History.

therefore who desire to proceed to the second cataract should stipulate in
their contract (p. xxii), for a boat able to perform the entire voyage.

Nubia extends from the first cataract to Khartum, i.e. to N. lat.
lip, and is divided into Lower Nubia, between the first two cataracts, and Upper Nubia, above the second cataract. Upper Nubia,
which with the Stuh" m and Dirfhr was formerly subject to Egypt,
is at present independent, and is not accessible for tourists. Lower
Nubia belongs to the mudiriyeh of Iieneh, from which it is governed,
so far as it is not under military (British) rule. It extends to
about N. lat. 221

The cultivable strip, even in Lower Nubia, is seldom more than
a few hundred yards wide, while it is generally much narrower, so
that the desert approaches close up to the banks of the Nile. As a
natural consequence the population is scanty; it is estimated to he
not more than 40,000 between the first and second cataracts. The
Nile flows for the first half of the distance between the cataracts
from S. to N., for the second half from SE. toN.W., and in Upper
Nubia from N. to S. The Monuments of Lower Nubia are nearly all
on the W. bank, where they were less exposed to hostile attack. The
most interesting. is the temple OfAbu-Simbel, the last station before
Wtdioalfah. The monuments in Upper Nubia are rarer but not less
remarkable, as e.g. those at Gebel Barkal.
