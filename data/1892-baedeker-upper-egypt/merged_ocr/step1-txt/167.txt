Other claims upon the traveller's time will he made in Thebes. it he
have paid a visit to one of the Consular agents, he will be invited to a
Futuasiga, and if he have brought good introductions, the fantasiya will
be preceded by a dinner. Among the modern Arabs the word'fantastya'
is applied to every kind of amusement, from the aimless discharging of
muskets, to the greatest festivity In the present connection it signifies
an evening party, at which the chief entertainment is the more or less
skilful dancing of hired gliawiizi, and which is recommended especially
to gentlemen who have not before seen anything of the kind. Chibouks,
cigarettes, comes, and liqueurs are offered to the guests.

Antiquities. The traveller in Thebes is frequentlytempted to purchase
antiquities. Half the population of Luxor is engaged in trafhe with am
tiquities, and the practice of fabricating searabtei and other articles
frequently found in tombs is by no means unknown to the other half.
Many of the articles offered for sale are so skilfully imitated that even
experts are sometimes in doubt as to their genuineness; the ordinary
traveller seldom m- neVur secures an authentic specimen. Only as many
piastres as they ask shillings should ever be etrered to the importunate
hawkers of antiquities at the temples and tombs. Those who desire a
genuine memorial of antiquity should apply to the director of the hotel
or to one of the above named consular agents. Even in this case, however,
absolute certainty is not attainable: for though honourable traders themselves, the consular agents are liable to he deceived in the purchases
they make. Caution should be observed in the purchase oruaopetsed
Prtpyturs Irons; rut dishunest vendors are in the habit of pasting torn
fragments of papyrus (frequently found in tombs) upon canes so as to
present the appearance of genuine papyrus-rolls. Egyptian antique bronzes,
with artificial cast, are made wholesale in Trieste, Paris, and Hanan;
Cairo and Luxor have the best factories for the fabrication ofantiques in
terracotta and carved wood. Valuable and genuine antiques may, however,
still be obtained in Luxor by those who are prepared to spend money.
The prices are high; 31. being now charged for a genuine Scarabmuse
Good and reliable specimens. including papyri, may be obtained from
ilohamuted irhasseh and'Abd el-Blegid.

Photographs. Good photrgraphs are produced by A. Beat » in Luxor;
but even in Shepheard's and other hotels in Cairo, excellent photographs
of Egyptian temples are sold at moderate prices. Those by fl. Béchard
are distinguished for artistic taste; those by sew: are also good. - Photographs of the Royal Mummies (p. 230) about ls. (id. each.
