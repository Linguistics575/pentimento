200 Route 19. THEBES. west Bang:

French Expedition mention 11, while at present 25 are accessible,
to which a few more have quite recently been added. Pausanias,
Aillian, Hcliodorus, Ammianus Marcellinus, and other ancient
authors refer to them as the Syringes (coptweg) of Thebes, which
name also occurs in the Greek inscriptions within the tombs. The
word'Syrinx' meant first a shepherd's pipe formed of longish reeds,
then it came to mean a hollow passage, and thus was applied to the
long roek-hewn passages of Bibin tsl-Mule.

These tombs and the subjects represented in them require some
words of explanation. The tombs which are in good condition and aecessible are Nos. i, 2, G, S, 9, li, id, 15, 17; the rest either contain only
the name of a king, or are unsafe owing to snakes (ey. No.7) or are
simple passages cut in the rock. Plan and Arrangement. Nos. f and 2 simply
consist of a passage, a hall for the sarcophagus, and an inner 1001111 01 the
rest only Nos. 9 and 11 are completed. In the first the plan is most
clearly seen: 1) three long halls, 2) a square hall, 3) first smaller hall with
pillars, A) one or two inclined oblong halls or passages, 5) a square room,
6) a second larger hall with pillars, the hall of the sarcophagus, in the
corners of which are side- chambers, 7) at the end another square or
several oblong rooms or passages. - The first hall with pillars has also
a side- chamber to the right, as in los. 8 and li, and with some variation, in
No. IT, The roof of the second is supported by S pillars, and as in No. 17
may also have an adjoining room on the left. From the plan of No. n we
conclude that this tomb was intended for several persons, as there are
two sarcophagus-halls. The tombs of the 18th Dyn. were arranged quite
differently from those of the 19th and 20th. In those a sloping passage
leads into the square sarruophvprrlsall, and adjoining this is a second hall
with pillars, the entrance to which is placed six feet above the ground. The oblong 11101111 usually contain niches, which were hewn in the stone
at four to six feet above the ground, possibly 1111- the keeping of sacrificial
vessels. All the tombs slope downwards into the rock, except Nos. i, 2, 4
and ll; in those of Set; J. (17) and of At we find a flight of well-worked
steps at the entrance, while in the others the descent is made by inclined
planes. Although the general plan is the same in all, and the difference
in size seems to have depended only on the amount of time and money
which each Pharaoh was able to give to the work, there is 110 similar
arrangement of inscriptions and representations; in fact only a certain
general resemblance can be observed, though the inscriptions vary not in
sense or even in words, but only in quantity. The style is often enigmatical and the interpretation of both the signs and their meaning
is extremely 1liftieult, The following is a brief account of the inscriptions and representations. In the first place there is out in the wall a
long hymn to Ra in Amenthes or the lower world, which recounts the
"forms of Put with the invocation:'Praise be to Ra, the Almighty'.'
Then it is said that the king knows the 74 forms of the god by name.
The works of Ra are farther glorified, and his victories over his foes.
In front of this hymn there is usually represented an antelope's head
with a serpent beside it above the disc, and an antelope's head with a
crocodile below. It is usually found in the first oblong hall, as in Nos. 2,
8,11,15 and W. The texts are more or less injured or defective, and
it has been the bask "our. Naville and Lef√©bure to collate and correct them.
- The Sun, with which the worship of the Egyptians began was conceived
by them in various forms, as we have seen (Vol. 1., p. 155). According
to one conception, which is the prevailing one 111 3111111 el- Muluk he is
