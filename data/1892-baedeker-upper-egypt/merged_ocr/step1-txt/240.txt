170 Route 14. THERES. West Bank:

second row begins with kneeling chiefs from the stun", who are
followed by white-clad Ethiopians with rings of gold, panther-skins,
a giraffe, and oxen. The last have unusually variegated hides, and
each has a brown and a black human hand most singularly fixed on
the points of its horns. The inscription above this procession runs:
'the great ones of Kush (Ethiopia) speak, Hail to thee, king of
Egypt, sun of the foreign peoples. We shall breathe as thou permittest and shall live according to thy pleasure'. In the third row
brown and black chiefs from Kush bring gold and precious stones,
and semicircular fans ofostrich-feathers, of exactly the same shape
as the f1abellum which now shades the pope 011 certain solemn
occasions and which was formerly used by the Pharaohs. An ox
with artificially bent horns, between which is a pond with fish
and bushes, should be noticed. The fourth and fifth divisions are
much injured. They show bright red persons (Erythneans who
dwelt between the Nile and the Red Sea), Egyptians, and very light
coloured Egyptian women with nosegays, earthen vessels, gazelles,
etc. Hui appears again on the same wall. Above and beneath may
be seen the ships which brought to Egypt the choice tribute of the
south. The two richly adorned and brightly painted dhahabiyehs
(above) resemble the craft (the ornamentation of course excepted)
in which the products of the Srhhtn are to this day transported to
the north. Five Ethiopian princes kneel upon the deck of the second
boat. Cattle and other goods are being brought to Egypt in the
smaller vessels below.

On wall L' appears the deceased, with the jackal-headed Anubis
on his right and Osiris on his left, while, between him and the gods
are offerings to the dead. On wall a, min the door, stands the
deceased, with his domestics, singers. etc' and two My adorned
Nile boats behind him; still farther back is the prince ot'Kush again,
surrounded by his treasures--earthen vessels, skins ofwihl animals,
bright coloured boxes, etc. Rings of gold are being received and
are weighed by a treasurer named Hornefer.

On the rear wall to the right (e) appears the king (near the
corner pillar), with 1111i before him. - Amenhotep, another prince
of Kush is bringing pieces of 1apis-lazuli on a dish. By his right
hand hangs a breast-plate, set with precious stones, like that worn
by the high priest of the Jews. Behind 1111i are several of those
gold and silver vessels, which at that time were manufactured by
the Phaynicians and Syrians with extraordinary artistic skill. Here
also are 1apis-lazuli, red cornelians, mill priestly breast-plates. An
inscription extols the Pharaoh in emphaticterms and informs us that
Syria pays this tribute. Their appearance alone is quite sufficient to
enable us to decide with certainty as to the origin ofthe men here represented, casting themselves in the dustbefore the king, or standing
and offering him homage and tribute. Some of them are lightcoloured, others of a reddish hue; their pr0tile is unmistakably
