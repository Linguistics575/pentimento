316 Route 31. DAKKEH. From Kalabshch

On the left bank of the Nile, aboveGerf llusén, are the consid-.
erable ruins of fJabayttrah. The village of Kirsh (E. bank), opposite
Gerf Lingen, has been conjecturally identified with Kerkis, mentioned in the Greek inscription of the officers of Psammetikh at AbuSimbel o. 334). At the village of Kostamneh, on the E. bank, are
some ancient walls. Our course bends to the W. and leads past
granite crags to-

the'Seorpiou', an animal that is here remarkably common. The

23 A.D., on his campaign to Napata (p. 302). Dakkeh early bename the site of a temple; Prof. Eisenlohr found a stone here with
the name of Amenemlta (how at Heidelberg). In the embankment
leading to the N. from the pylon, in the axis of the present temple,
stones of earlier buildings have been used, several with the cartouehe of Tutmes III. (which occurs also on a column) and Seti l.
Gau's theory that there was formerly another edifice to the right,
almost as large as the present one to the left, seems insuffiiOntly
supported, though suggested by existing remains. The present
temple was built by the native king Ergamenes (the inner temple
c, camp. Pl. p. 317), Ptolemy IV. Phuopator (Sekos B), and Ptolemy LN. Euergetes 11. (the pronaos A), and it was completed by a

is usually understood. It has already been related (p. 302) that
the Nubian sub-king Ergamenes, in the reign ofPtolemy11. Philadelphus freed himself from the priests at Napata, causing them to
be murdered in the temple there. Names of such Nubian sub..
kings, especially under the Roman empire, are found on the Ethiopian buildings and in the demotie inscriptions at Philas, tialabsheh,
and Dakkeh. It is somewhat improbable that this same Ergamenes
was the builder of the temple of Dakkeh, for the Ergamenes of the

the title of'Pirra' is usually employed only by the Roman emperors (Augustus, Tiberius?), and often along with'Autokrator Kisres', as in the innermost chamber D as well as in the front chamber
A at Dakkeh. On the other side, there are proofs that the chamber
D must be more ancient than the two front rooms, which existed
even under Ptolemy Philopator and Euergetes II.

The present Temple Buildings of Dakkeh embrace the massive
pylons and the temple proper, lying 40 ft. behind them, both fairing the N. (30'l. deviation). The whole stands upon a substantial
