Right Obelisk has been overthrown. and the fragments of its shattered
shaft are seen lying scattered around. The top has fallen some
distance to the N. The'Lett Obetislc (P1. h), still standing, is the
largest obelisk in Egypt. The total height was estimated by the
engineers of Napoleois expedition at 971/2 ft., its diameter at the
base 31 L, ft., its mass 4873 cubic ft., and its weight 3673 tous.t It
is made of tine red granite, and the inscriptions upon it are among
the finest specimens of the grand style, which flourished at the date
of its erection. Queen Hatasu Klsnurut-Amen, who was regent for
her brother Tutmes III. during his minority, and who erected this
monument, was a true child of the Egyptian'age of chivalry' which
did not close until the reign ofAmenhotep 1V., the sun-worshipper.
Her name will frequently be met with again, especially in her
terrace-temple at Dtr el-bahl-i (p. 223). She was the halt-sister
of two kings (Tutmes 11. and Tutmes IH.), and was named
queen by her father Tutmes L, probably because her mother was
of purer royal blood than the mother of her half-brothers. After
her father's death she reigned in her own name along with Tutmes H., whom she married, and on her husband's decease she ruled
on behalf of Tutmes HI., who appears. also to have been her SOILin-law. Masculine in disposition, she carried on important wars
and reared large building: The less energetic Tutmes If. yielded
to the guardianship of his sister and wife, but Tutmes m. appears
to have early compelled her to relinquish to him the crown of Lower
Egypt. After her death he caused her name to be chiselled out in
some places and to be replaced by his own in others -. an instance
of the irreverent disfigurement of monuments only too common
in ancient Egypt. Hatasu khnumt-Amen, the royal Amazon,
caused herself to be represented with the ornaments of the male
Pharaohs, and even with a beard. The beautifully carved central
inscription, formerly inlaid with electrum or silver-gilt, contains
her name alone; though she permitted her brother's name to appear
at the sides. Later usurpers have not entirely spared even this noble
monument. The side-inscriptions contain short sentences with the
formulae usually employed for the presentation of gifts and the
bestowing of the blessings of life, while the ventral-inscriptions
refer to the dedication of the obeiis One of the inscription: is as
