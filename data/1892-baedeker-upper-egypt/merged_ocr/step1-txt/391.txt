cover one only, at the N.E. end of the village. The entrance, facing
the s., consists ofa central portal (closed) and smaller adjoining
door. Its only sculptured ornament is the winged sun-disc above
the central door. In the interior of the temple, which has a substructure of dressed masonry, are four standing columns, with
tastefully carved capitals, and farther on are various ruinous c-hambers, To the W. are the remains of some large and solid structures.
- At the foot of the mountains to the S. of the village, not far
from the river, are some scanty remains of enclosures and the angle
of a wall, in which perhaps are to be identified the traces of the
other and larger temple, which was still standing in 1870. On the
hill above is a castellated building to which climbers may ascend.
On the opposite (E) bank lay Contra Taphis, which has left no
remains of importance.

Beyond Tafeh the dark shining rocks advance close to the riverbank, forming a gloomy gorge, known as Btrb eI-Kalabsheh, in the
middle of which, on the E. bank, are some houses with plantations
of palms. The navigation of this reach is somewhat dangerous,
owing to the frequent bends of the river and the numerous islands.
On one of the islands are some ruins. On the right (W), beyond
the gorge, appears tho large

one of the Ptolemies handing the sign of the possession of a field
to Isis, Mandulis, and another goddess (perhaps Neith?). Although
this representation dates from a late Roman period, it shows that
Amenhotep was regarded as the founder and one of the Ptolemies
as the restorer of the temple. The cartouche also of T11tmes 111.,
the predecessor of Amenhotep IL, is found on a granite statue lying
before the entrance of the temple. The above-mentioned Ptolemy
is probably Rater 11., who appears in several reliefs in the small
temple in the N.E. angle of the passage round the outside of the
large temple. Talmi.s was long the capital of the Blemmyes (p. 302,
