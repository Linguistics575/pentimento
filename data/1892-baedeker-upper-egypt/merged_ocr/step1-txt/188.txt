Ethiopians. And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and

from Kings. - The conquered people named in the reprresentation are the Amu, Kenus (Nubians), Menti, and Sakti (Asiatiesl.

Champo? lion, the great deeipherer of hieroglyphies, was the
first to perceive that the names in the inscription belonged to
the above-mentioned'fenced cities', and that Sheshenk, called
by the Greeks Sesonehis, was identical with the Shishak of the
Bible. The third name in the third row from the top, attracted
his attention especially; it reads'Judah (Jude) Malek', and may

be translated king of Judah. The heads of the busts above the
name-labels, with their characteristic Semitic features, are sufficient by themselves to prove that only places could be here

We return to the peristyle court and proceed to the Second Pylon
(P1. Ir). The left or N. side has fallen and the right side is sadly
damaged. The eolossi of Ramses IL, which guarded the projecting
entrance, have already been mentioned on p. 119. But neither
Ramses 11., as appearances might suggest, nor even his father Seti I.
built this pylon, but the predecessor and father of the latter,
Rams _ 1., who also planned the hypostyle hall, afterwards adorned
by Seti I. and Itamses the Great. The eartouehes of Ramses II.
frequently occur sunk instead of being embossed, because they have
been placed on spots previously occupied by the older cartourhes
of Ramses T. or Seti I. The same is the case on the back of the
2i. pylon, whereas on the back of the S. pylon, which was erected
by Ramses 11., his name appears in genuine bas-relief. In the
doorway (P1. c), where the cartom-hes of Ramses I., Scti L, and
Ramses 11. are found, an intervening door was erectedby Ptolemy TH.

their joint-reign (170-165 Bi.), The lintel and upper parts of
this latter doorway are wanting, but the jambs are in good preservation, with expressions of homage to Amman and his fellowgods. On the inner side (to the left) of the earlier doorway appears
Rams H. kneeling before Amman and receiving the symbol of
kingship. Behind him stands the goddess Math, and Khunsu, ll ith
the moon's disc on his head, conducts Ptolemy VII. Philometor to
behold the god Amman. Probably the representation is a restoration
by Philometor of an older work on the same spot.
