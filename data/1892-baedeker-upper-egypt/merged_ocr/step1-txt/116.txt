different chapels are still easily distinguishable, partly from the
plan of the building, partly by the representations and inscriptions;
for from each of the seven doors a processional approach led through
the two hypostyle halls straight to tho entrance of the corresponding chapel; while the representations on the columns flanking each
approach refer only to the deity to whom the chapel at the end ofit
was dedicated. In the vaulted chapels, amid the fumes of incense and the murmuring of muffled singing, waited the ministering priests of the sanctuary, pouring out libations and uttering
henedictio11s as the processions wound along the aisles, either
bearing a mummy to be sanctified or consisting of a group of privileged laymen bringing offerings to the Osiris gods for the soul's
welfare of the deceased.--The dedications are inscribed on the
door-posts in the traditional forms and with little variation. Similar
vaults occur at Benihasan and Dér el-Barri, and also in the lids of
the sarcophagi in the museum at Gizeh. In each case the menu »
meuts to which they belong serve funerary purposes; the shape ot
the vault is, however, intended to represent the vault of heaven,
which the Osiris-soul has to traverse, and they are usually decorated
with stars. An inscription preserved on one of the vaults of the
sanctuary informs us that the Pharaoh erected this structure for his
father Osiris in the interior of the temple of Ra-ma-men and fitted
up the chapel to resemble the heaven of the ninefold deities, imi
tating its constellations, eta.

The infernal fitting up and appearance of the chapels vary little As the
middle place had to be assigned to Ammon, the chief of the gods, it was
necessary to mark the special dignity of Osiris, to whom indeed the temple
was consecrated, by making his chapel [ PL tn wider than the others. The
mammals of the latter are, in each case, occupied by two niches, with a
lotus-flower between them, from Which rises the slender form of Usiris,
symbolising the blossoming of the soul in a door, leading to astrueture
(Pl. E) which, including the adjoining smaller columned chambers, is as wide
as the whole sanctuary. This was the scene of the mysterious rites celebrated in tumour of the Divine-Deceased (Osiris, whose name even the Greek
Herodotus shrank from breathing) by the esoteric priests of the highest class
(see Baedeker's Lower Egypt, p. 124). The inscriptiOns in the chapels inform
us that the priestly proeessionsl, which came from all parts of the kingdom,
made a complete circuit of the chapel, keeping to the right wall on entering
and returning to the door along the left wall. Thirty-six rites er ceremonies
had to be performed during this circuit. First came a reeitation to prove the
worthiness of the worshipper to approach the holy place and the image of
the god. Then the veil was lifted. The Wnrshipper was next allowed to
witness the investiture of the god hy the priests with his Inlets, garments,
ornaments, and the attributes of his divine power. Net before this was
accomplished did the pilgrim prostrate himself in adoration, hringiug drinkofferings, libations, and huvrtt-otrrsrings The hymns to be sung at these
ceremonies are all prescribed, and the pictorial representations show how
the gods were to be clothed and in what attitudes they were to be wowshipped. Possibly all these rites were performed only by the priests of



's. In the inscriptions the expression invariably used for the processions
is the King, who is regarded as the embodiment and representative of all
his subjects,
