behind which are painted four f1g, ures, viz. Ptah (to the left), Amman in blue, King Ramses, and Harmachis. No one should omit
to enjoy the mysterious effect of the interior view of this temple,
with its eight Osiris-statues, as seen by the light of torches or a
magnesium-lamp.

We now climb over fallen stones and heaps ofs; uld to the smaller
temple, which lie; a little to the N.

The *Sma11er Rock Temple of Abu-Simbel lies Hose to the river.
The cliff has here been smoothed for a breadth of 90 ft. to make
room for the facade of this attractive temple of Uathor, which in
modest contrast to liamsesls huge monument, will not fail to produce a satisfactory impression. The six statues on the facade do
not project boldly like the colossi of the great temple, but stand in
niches supported on projecting pillars. Moreover it is not only the
king that is here represented; to the right and left of him stand
female figures equally large in which we recognize his consort Noferturi Merimmut. The latter holds a sistrum in her hand and wears
a double headdress with horns twisted round a disc, such as is worn
by Hauler, goddess of love, whose representative the queen is. The
figures at the corners represent Ramses again; on the left in his
usual form with a dagger in his girdle, and on the right as a deified king, with a crown consisting of the double feather springing



from the sun, and the twisted horns. Besides the six co
lossi there are a number of much smaller statues of the children of
the king and queen. Beside the colossi on the right and left of the
door are the two eldest sons of the king, viz. (on the right) Amenitikhopeshf (Am1non in his sword) and (on the left) Rummmemifata at
his left hand); beside the outer volossi are the princes Meritum
(right) andMerim (left); and beside each of the colossi of the queen
are statue Â» of the priueesses Jferitamon (right) and Honttrlui (left),
with stra in their ham The first and third pillars on the right
bear interesting inscriptions:'Ile (the king) has made the temple

and'flis Majesty has commanded to make a temple in the land of
Khent, in en excavation in the mountain: never was surh a thing
done before. A narrow portal admits to the temple, which, to judge
from a relief and inscription beside the door, was dedicated also to
Amman and a Home [ em heb).

The Main [ lull is practically the only one in this temple, as the
rooms behind are merely its dependencies. It is 34 ft. deep and
27 ft. broad, and has six pillars in two rows, earl decorated with
