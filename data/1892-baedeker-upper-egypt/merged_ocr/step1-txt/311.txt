temple was destroyed only a few months before Champolliorfs tirrival at el-kit, in 1800, and only a few scanty traces of it (a basin,
some faint hieroglyphics, etc.) are now left. The sanctuary, which
stood within the wall, was dedicated to Sehek and Uehent and
existed even under the 18th Dynasty. Champollion saw here the
cartouches of Tutmes IL, Ramaka, Amenhotep IH., two scenes in
which Ramses H. did homage to Sebek and Hehent, and Hakoris
and Nertanetnts I. from later times. The town itself was founded at
a much earlier date, and in fact is, as we shall see, one of the very
oldest in Egypt. It existed even under the ancient empire. During
the period of the 11yksos it was scarcely less conspicuously than
Thebes the residence of the legitimatePharaohs who had been driven
towards the S. The most important monuments for the history of
the freeing of Egypt from the foreign domination are to be found
here.

ROCK INSCRIPTIONS. - The route leads due E. from the E. gateway in the girdle-wall, and crosses the tlazzingly white sand, past
a small ruined Temple close to the wall. In rather more than h hr.
we reach the small temple of Thoth, known to the Arabs as elHummfim (p. 239). We keep straight on, leaving the larger temple
of the Ptolemies on the left, and soon reach two Rocks projecting
from the plain, at the point where the road turns N. towards the
desert, halfway between el-Iiamm√©m and the E. temple of Amenhotep IH. Both rocks bear numerous inscriptions, most of which
use the hierntie contractions. The royal names of Pepi and Teta
refer these to the 6th Dynasty. The inscriptions are chiefly names
of priests and their sons, who probably selected this spot for the
consummation of the sacrifice: to the after-world. At all events there

are but few representations ofolferings to the local goddess Jr t5

Ilebent-Eileithyia. There are also some brief prayers. On the
SAY. side of the larger rock is a very interesting Figure of an Ancient King, with bare head, above which hovers the disc with the
Urmus-serpent.

The small temple or CHAPEL OF AMBNHOTEP III. lies fully 1/4 hr.
to the E. It may be reached direct in about an hour from the Nile
though the shadeless route, especially at midday, is somewhat fatiguing. The little temple which is nearly M) ft. deep is of consider-.
able interest from the artistic forms which it displays. The small
Celia (221/313 P.) stands upon a paved platform, which was in.
one time surrounded by a wall of freestoue. The gateway still
stands, and was formerly connected with the sanctuary proper by a
passage, at the sides of which stood smooth columns with calyxcapitals,
