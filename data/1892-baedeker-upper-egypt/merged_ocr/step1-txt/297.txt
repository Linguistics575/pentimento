square, in the decoration of which the central block is treated as if it
were an enormous sarcophagus. In fact the Sarcophagus of the deceased
lies below the centre of this block, and is reached by means of a perpendicular shaft, Is ft. in depth, at the end of a Corridor to the right of
the main passage. By descending the shaft, a room 191/2 ft. deep is reached,
and from the roof of this there is an entrance to the sarcophagus-hall,
which is exactly beneath the square block above described. The length
of this private tomb without the side-chamhers is 862 ft., and its superfieial area 2470 sq. yds. or with the shaft-chainhers 2000 sq. yds.

To the N. ot this huge tomb are several smaller ones of the
same period, with finely worked antechambers, and false doors, and
carefully executed inscriptions. Some of these, especially those of
the royal ladies and priestesses of Ammon, Shep-en-apt and Neit
akert or Nitoeris O, contain valuable contri-.

buttons to the knowledge of the family of Pharaohs which formed
the 26th Dynasty. A queen Nitocris of the 6th Dyrc, known as a
pyramid-builder, is said to have been beautiful and light-haired.
With her may have been confounded the princess of the 96th Dyn.
with the same name, who was buried at el-A f, and lived shortly
before the famous courtezan of Naucratis, named Rhodopis or the
rosy-cheeked. Nitocris the elder and 1lhodopis were probably called
by the same name, i.e. the fair one, in the mouths of the Egyptians,
and Herodotus hearing that the Tait one' had lived shortly before
A nasis, confused the two, and reported that the courtezan Rhodopis
was considered the builder of pyramids. See Tol. I., p. 346.

The Terrace-Temple of Der el-bahri.

This temple derives its name, meaning the North Church or
North Monastery, from an ecclesiastical brick building of the Christian period, the remains of which are mentioned on p. 227. DÃ©r
el-bahri is reached from el-Asasif in 10minutes. Its situation is
remarkably fine, its terraces which we ascend, being framed by a
semicircle of high and rugged rocks, of a light brown and golden
colour. If Thebes had been in Greece, this is where its citizens
would have placed their theatre. The Egyptians whose thoughts
were fuller of death than of life, founded a sanctuary for the
worship of the dead. Apparently an avenue of sphinxes, of which
some traces remain, connected this with the landing-stage, where
boats coming from Karnak on the W. bank were anchored. This
magnificent work was carried out during the rise of the New Empire, and the numerous processions of pilgrims began in the
15th cent. 11.0. The laying out of the terraces was begun by Tutmes L, and completed by his. daughter, Queen Ilatshepsu, or Hatasu-Pvamaka, familiar to us as the raiser of the great obelisk of
Karnak o. 133). Here too her brothers, Tutmes ll. and 111.,
although their names are mentioned, fall into the background
when eompared with their energetic and ambitious sister. After
