the rising Nile as far as possible towards the Libyan Desert.

Mu this canal lies Etfek (Wu), the ancient Aplwvdileporis, so named
from the Sandals lich) made out of the skin of Seti. About 2 M. from E (fch
is the Red Convent, Dh. alxn caued Dir Abu Rishdi. Those who
wish to visit the Red Convent and the similar White Convent (one of the
regular excursions of the passengers by the'four weeks' steamer) may
hire asses at 5a A and ride viii Demtm towards the Libyan Desert. The
old church of the convent, a basilica. with nave and aisles, is a very
ancient structure of brick, with elaborate capitals and a richly articulated
apse. The outer walls, decreasing in thickness towards the top, and the
concave cornice above the portal, are interesting forltheir reminiscence of
ancient Egyptian art. Abu Bi,, the founder of the convent, is said hy
Wauslety to have been a penitent robber, and he afterwards acquired such
a reputation for sanctity that, according to Nalrvizi, 3000 monks placed
themselves under his care. The recluse after whom the White Convent

S.E., and may perhaps be rather called a Christian village than a convent,
as husbands, wives, and children live here in families. The walls of the
church are built of hewn stone, probably taken from the adjacent ruins
of Athrihis (ShC-kh Hamed), dating from the Ptolemaie and Roman imperial periods It dale: al latest from the 5th cent. and is a basilica with
nine and aisles. The columns vary in height and thickness, and the
capitals are partly of later date. The chancel ends in three vaulted apses.
The cupolas are ashamed with poor frames. and the other Jeeorations are
also wretched. - In the hills to the w. of the While Convent are a few
late rtek-tomhs, one of which, according tn the inscription, is that of
Ermius, son of Archibius.

town with about 10.001) inhab., including 1000 Christians, some
of whom are Roman Catholics, with a chapel of their own. The
weekly market onWed. is much frequented, and the bazaar is well-.

with fringes, which the poorer classes wear on state occasions and
for protection against cold. These articles, which have been made
here since the time of Strabo, arc extraordinarily cheap. Akhmim
stands on the site of Khmmnis or Punopotis, generally held to be the
most ancient town 011 the Nile, though this honour probably belongs
to the venerable Thi Ahydos. on the W. bank (p. 53). The deity
