On the pillar between the two columns to the right of the Blltrance to the main temple is another Greek inscription. This is a
decree ofAurelitts Ileswion, alsnnamed Amonius, military governor
of Ombos and Eiephantine, ordering the owners of swine to remove
their animals from the holy Talmis. It probably dates from the
year 248-9 A.P. - (in the left side of the elegant entranctr-do0r

Leaving now' the entrance-wall with its four columns behind us,
we fhul oursolves in the main building of the temple, the portico
proper, which is 40 ft. deep and 6611. broad. This portico is considerably higher than the three rooms behind it, from which a
double staircase ascends to the roof (now fallen) of the portico. It

means of a door (m the left side. This outer passage could be closed
by means of doors. The whole structure is a faithful reproduction
of an early Egyptian temple, but dates from Roman times.

The little *Temple ot Bet el-Welli, situated upon a hill about
20 min. to the N., is much more noteworthy than the large Roman
erection at lialabsheh. The way to it leads along the verge of the
mountain, level at first, but finally asrends steeply. The temple
consists of a vestibule, of which only the side walls are now standing, a main chamber, entered by a central and two side doors, and a
small adytum, adjoining the latter. In the vestibule our interest is
excited by the warlike scenes on the sido-walls. These indicate
