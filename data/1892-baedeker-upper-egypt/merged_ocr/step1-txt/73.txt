The colossal figure within this tomb represents Kai, son of Tothotep, a high-priest, a steward of the mysteries of the word ofGod,
a privy Chamberlain (superintendent of the works in the inner palace), and the head of a home His paternal grand-mother was a
daughter of Usertesen I., the second king of the 12th Dynasty,
and he was also connected with the royal family on the motherside. He was likewise related to the family of Nehera and Klmumhotep (see p. 15).

The successful transportation of the statue figured in his tomb was
Jule of the chief events in the life of Ear. The scene shows us an image,
"ells in height, securely fastened to a sled. Small cushions are inserted
to prevent the polished stone from being injured by the ropes. To the
sled are attached four strong cables, each manned by 43 workmen (in all
i7C0, the Oung men', as the inscriptions inform us,'of the w. and E.
of the home, On the lap of the figure stands a man clapping his hands,
probably the leader and time-giver of the song of the workmen, whose
task was facilitated by rhythmical movement. To this day in Egypt and
elsewhere the same custom is observed wherever the strength of many men
is united in some common exertion as in the sailor's chant in raising
the anchor or hoisting sail. A man facing, the time-keeper knocks two
wooden stamps together, obviously to transmit the proper time to those
tun far 011' to hear distinctly the hanrs1apping of the leader. "n the
prow of the sled, behind the rings to which the ropes are fastened, stands
a man pouring water on the ground to prevent the heavily loaded sled
from taking fire by friction. AVaier-earriers stand ready to rrefill the empty
pitcher. These are followed hy other labourers hearing, notched beams,
for laying under the sledge when necessary. Three hailill's or stewards,
with sticks, are each attended by four men, who seem from their simple
costume to he foreman, stone-masons, or extra-hands. At the top are
depicted seven well-equipped companies of infantry, marching in stiff
military order towards the advancing colossus. The officers hear. tridents
resembling those in the usual representations of Neptune, which may
either have been used as field-standards or for driving the cowardly
into action.

This highly instructive representation shows, among Other points,
how unlimited was the authority of the nomarch ever the people of his
heme and how freely, not to say extravagantly, he could apply human
labour in effecting his ends. One is tempted to pity the corv√©e labourers
and to forget how ends which seem petty or even obnoxious to one
generation may have seemed to their ancestors worthy of an unlimited
expenditure of time, blood, and Wealth. In the time of the pyramidhnilding 12th Dynasty it was accounted a noble and reputable thing to
erect the hugest and most durable monuments. The mass of the people,
who seem to have regarded the might of their oppressors in the same
light as we regard the workings of destiny, were proud to have had a
share in the erection of any specially important monument. Similar
considerations are suggested by scenes in the tombs of the pyramids, and
the inscription accompanying the abuve-deseribed picture gives us chapter
and verse for the accuracy of this view. It runs as follows:'Transport
of the thirteen-ell statue made of stone from Hatnnb. Behold, the way
hy which it was to be transported was of extraordinary difficulty. Truly
diffieuU was also the toil of the people in drawing the mighty mass along
it, in dragging (the colossus) in hewn stone. I ordered the bands of young
men to march and prepare the way for it, with watchmen, carpenters,
and so forth. The most important were among them. The order was
issued that men of a strong arm should go forth to fetch it. My heart
was full of content, and my fellow-citizens all rejoiced. The scene was
extremely heautiful to witness; the old man leans on the youth, the
strong withstood the weak-hearted and timid. They thus became so strong
that each one eirsebed as much as a thousand. And behold, this statue
