Tombs ofthe Queens. THEMES M. Route. 187

20 have been discovered, many of them unfinished and entirely
without decoration, and in their rough and blackened condition,
resembling more caves in the rocks. It is rare to tind either inscriptions or representations carved in the stone; even in the finest
tombs the limestone walls were more often covered with plaster
which could be adorned with paintings without much oliffie11lty.

0f the two tombs which we reach first, the second only (to the
W.), that of a queen of Ramses m., is preserved. Her name is no
longer legible, but only those of her husband and her son Ra-lyanemi-f. The tomb consists of an antechamber and a large hall with 4 pillars,
in the midst of which is the broken sarcophagus.

The next three tombs, of which the
Farthest belonged to a Queen Sitra of the
'lmh Dym, need nut be visited. But of
the four on the side of the valley next
rearhell, the second and the h'rst deserve
notice. The former is the Tomb of Queen

Titi'h u, sl ]. It lies on the
mun ] anteehamber (P1. I) open to the N.,
a long passage (Pl.'l), and a large chapel
()'l.3 ] with a small chamber on each of t 1







its three sides. In this as in most of the
better preserved tombs of the Queens the

freshness of the colour is extraordinary. On the left wall (Pl. a) of
the Passage 2 we see the queen before Ptah, ta Harmachis, the genii
ol' the dead Amset and Tuarmrtef, and Isis; on the right (Pl. b)
Titi with the sistrum stand: before Thoth, Tum, IIapi, Kebsenuf
and Nephthys. Ptah is placed opposite to Thoth, Ila Harmaehis,
i.c. the morning sun, to Tum, Let the evening sun, the two genii
of the dead Amset and Tuamutef to the two others Hapi and Reb-.
seuuf, and lastly Isis to her sister Nephthys. As a border above the
figures rum an inscription from which we learn that Titi was the
daughter of a king, the sister and the mother ofa Pharaoh, and
queen of Upper and Lower Egypt, and that she received in the other
world a friendly welcome and all that is wished for the dead.

The name of the. wife of Anwnhotep IH., which often occurs on
searahmi, is also mentiuned on the cuneiform tablets recently discovered
at. Tell el-Amarnuh. She was perhaps the daughter of a Babylonish king.
This would. account fer the reddish skin and blue eyes with which she
is represented here.

In the passage leading to Room 3 are at Pl. P the Goddess Isis
(Silk with the scorpion on her head), and M 1'1. d Neith,'the great
lady of Rat's, the mistress ofheavuu, and print-ess of all the gods, the
