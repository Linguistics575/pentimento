The steamers and dhahabiyehs are met at er-ITamrah by donkey
boys with well-saddled donkeys and by sellers of pottery, which

ofAtrsitht, especially its bottles and pipe-bowls, is justly celebrated
and forms an important article in its export trade, which also deals
in linen, embroidered leather goods, ostrich feathers and other products of the Soho, matron, soda, and corn. It has, however, lost
part of its commercial importance since the great caravans from W.

the town lie the long government buildings. The streets are full
of busy life, especially on Sundays, when the people of the neighbourhood flock into the market. Oriental wares are cheaper in the
