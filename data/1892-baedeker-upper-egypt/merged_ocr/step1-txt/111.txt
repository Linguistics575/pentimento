pronaos. In the time of Seti seven doors, corresponding to the seven
chambers of the sanctuary (see below), pierced the rear-wall, which
was adorned with a cornice otits own. On ceremonial nnrasions
the processions in honour of the king seem to have entered by the
door to the extreme left; the next served for processions to Ptah,
the third for Harmarhis, the fourth for Amman. the fifth for Osiris,
the sixth for Isis, and the seventh for Lorus. tamses, however,
walled tip six of these doors, leaving the central one alone. the

how, on mining to Abydos, he found his father's work unfinished
and resolved to carry it to a conclusion. The grandees rejoiced at
this resolution, and workmen and artists of every kind were summoned to aid in the task. In the semnd part Pharaoh recalls to his

god, the victorious Opponent of the might of Death, who will soon
