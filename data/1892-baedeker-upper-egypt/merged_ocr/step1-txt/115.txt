essenees were poured out in honour of the god. The framework of
eavh srene, the mouldings separating the lines of hieroglyphies,
and the hieroglyphic symbols themselves are all executed with inimitable care. The side-walls of this hall, to the right and left, and
the walls near the gates leading to the chapels, bear symbolic representations, like those in the first hall, of the Homes of Upper
and Lower Egypt.

At a considerable interval, beyond the third row of columns in
the second hall, and on the same level with them, is a series of
SEVEN VAULTED CHA'IBERS "CHAPELS, forming the Sanctuary of
the Memnonium. The metal doors with which they were once closed
have long since disappeared. In the piers separating the doors are
rectangular niches, which probably contained images either of the
deities to whom the chapels were dedicated or of King Seti. Each
chapel is vaulted and the vaults are profusely and beautifully decorated with stars and the name lla-ma-men (pramomen of Seti L).
Dediratory inscriptions on three of the vaults prove that Osiris must
be regarded as the chief divinity of the temple. It must be noted
that the roofs of these chapels are not vaulted in the strict architectural signifieation of that word; they consist rather of blocks of
stone cut in a round fashion and crowned by a key-stone which is
hollowed out in the interior. The chapels were dedicated (beginning from the tuft) to the king, Ptah, IIarmaehis, Amman, Osiris,

i C and Horns. All the ehief figures in the Osiris cycle of gods are
represented here with the eXeeption of Seth1 the antagonist of Osiris,
and his wife Nephthys. With them is associated the king who has
become Osiris (see p. 57). Ptah, who becomes Sokar-0siris when
regarded in his relations to life beyond the grave, is of course reprcscntcd. In the place of honour in the midst of the seven is Amman,'who is the only one and whose years flourish among the gods',
who is'loftier in his ideas than any other god', "to whose feet the
gods crawl, recognising their lord and master', who is'lord of
eternity and t're'ato: of the unending', of whom indeed the other
getls may be regarded as attributes. To the right and loft at'Amman are two groups of threat To the right are Osiris, Isis, and liorus; to the left are Ptah the primasval, the lord of the past; Ilar.,
machis, who announces the new day rising in the East, who struggles for the victory of life over death, and assures the future
triumph ot' good over evil; and King Seti, the temporal incarnation
of divine power in the present, in the sphere of human activity. To these gods, conceived as filling these chapels with their prcsence, were brought the mummies, to be sanctified for their eternal
home. The way to the different chapels was indicated on the very
threshold of the temple, where Seti L, as we have soon, constructed
seven doors in the rear-wall of the pronaos. Most of these, however, were closed by lhunses, probably to intensify and preserve the
ser'ret and mysterious character of the temple. But the paths to the
