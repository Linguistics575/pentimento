The next room, almost square, is entirely hewn out of the rock,
six square pillars being left in two rows in the centre. The architrave above the pillars contains the customary dedieation-inscription. On the right we read:'The living Uor-lla, the strong lord of
both lands beloved by Ma, who rules Egypt and has conquered the
nations, the gold-hawk, rich in years, great in victories, the king
of Upper and Lower Egypt, Ramses II., has reared in memory of
his father Harmachis the Hat Ramessu meramon in Pa Ra.'Pa
Ra' is thus the holy name of the spot and'temple of Ramses Meramon' the name of the sanctuary. On the left architrave Ammon-Ra
is mentioned instead of Harmaehis, as lord of the throne of both
lands, so that the temple must be regarded as dedicated to both
deities. On the six pillars are figures of the king before Tum, Ptah,
Khnum, and other gods. On the right side-wall is the boat of Harmachis borne by 12 priests and conducted by the king; on the left
side-wall the king, in a boat, offering incense. From this chamber
a large door, surmounted by the winged sun-disc, leads into the
sanctuary, and doors to the right and left admit to smaller apartments. Four seated figures occupy the rear-wall of the sanctuary,
viz. (beginning to the left) Ptah, Ammon-Ra, the king, and 1m.
machis with the hawlfs head. They are all represented full face,
and would be difficult to identify were it not for the inscriptions
adjoining. - Not far from the temple is a small rock-stele, dedicated to the king's son Amenemheb, with the figure of a temple.

Beyond Den the Nile valley again turns to the S.W. To the
right is the island of Tomas. Crocodiles now become more numerous, looking from a distance like tree-trunks or like huge frogs. A
nearer view is only to be obtained by rowing on ahead of the dhahablyeh in the felukeh or small boat. At Ellesiyeh (E. bank), also
called ed-Duknesrah, is a roek-tomb of the 18th Dynasty On a stele
here, dating from the 43rd year of Tutmes LIL, the king presents

- -.11 i
offerings to Horus, lord of Ham l C:, and to Sati, mistress of

Abu. The wall-paintings represent the king seated between Aluth
and Uaz; then oifering to Horus, lord of the land of lx'hent, to Horus
of Mam, and to Thoth and Ilathor.

On the W. bank, opposite Ketteh, we next see an ancient ruined
fort. Then to the right is the verdant island of Abu Ihis, and to
the left the village of
13 M. Ibrim. To the E. rises a considerable chain ofhills, and to
the W. (left) is a narrow strip of palms and castor-oil plants, beyond
which is the desert. lln the W. bank, a little inland from the village
of Anibeh, and hidden behind a palm-grove, lies an interesting

rock-tomb of the reign of Ramses VI. (g Om, P "I if i), Amen
