Iliad (IN, 379-384), Achilles, enraged with Agamenmon, assures
Ulysses that he will never more unite in council or in deed with the
great Atrides:
"Ten times as much, and twenty times were vain, the high pin ] store"

"Of rich Myeenm, and if he ransaek wide earth for more,"

"Search old (lrehumenus for gold, and by the fertile stream"

"Where, in Egyptian Thebes, the heaps of precious ingots gleam,"

"The lauudred-gated Thebes, where twice ten score in martial state"

"Of valiant men with steeds and ears march through each messy gate."

(Blackie's Translation. J
The epithet £11121; .0;, i.e.'hundred-gated', here used by

Human" a: .1150 applied by later classical authors to Thebes. Diodorus,
Strum). Pliny, amt llnto of Sinope all make use of it, referring,
however, to the pylons of the temples in the capital of Upper Egypt.
With the rising importance of the god and with the increase of his
wealth, of which they had the disposal, the arehpriests of Ammon
gradually grew to regard themselves as the chief persons in the
state; and, after the way had been prepared by a series of weak
princes, they succeeded in usurping: the throne and by their rule
prepared the ruin of Egyptian power. From the 20th Dyn. onwards,
Thebes began to decay. Ramses Ill. indeed adorned the left bank
especially with elaborate buildings; but his immediate successors
did no more than hew out for themselves deep and richly carved
grates in the valley of the Kings" Tombs, and the princes of Lower
Egypt who succeeded the priests of Ammon of the 21st Dyn. were
the less able to bestow attention upon Thebes, the more eagerly
they strove to adorn their homes in the Delta with gorgeous strnetures. Yet even these princes did not wholly abandon Thebes, and
they did not omit to inscribe pretentious reports of their mighty
acts on the walls of the temple of Ammon. The armies of the Assyrians penetrated as far as Thebes and plundered it; the Ethiopians
planted their rule here and honoured Ammon with buildings and
inscriptions; the princes of the 26th Dyn. did for Sal's what the
princes of the 18th and 19th Dyn. had done for the city of Ammon,
but they also paid their homage to the great god of Thebes by
erecting smaller buildings there. The invading army of Uambyses
asceuded as far as Upper Egypt, but seems to have done little or
no damage at Thebes. Neetanehus L, one of the native Egyptian
prince » who maintained themselves against the Persians, found
time and means to add a handsome pylon to the temple ofAmmon.
Alexander the Great and the princes of the house of the Lagidae
probably found Thebes still a great though decadent city, and they
assisted to embellish it, as many buildings dating from the period
of the Ptolemies still attest. After the 22nd Dyn. the treasures ot
Ethiopia had ceased to enrich Thebes; and when the harbour of
Alexandria began to attract to itself the produce of Egypt brought
from the lied Sea to the Nile valley, the vessels of tioptos, with
their latliug of Indian and Arabian goods, but seldom found their
way S. to the great city of Ammon. Thebes still remained Cun
