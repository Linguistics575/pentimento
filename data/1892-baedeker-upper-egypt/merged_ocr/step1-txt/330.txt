the Egyptian government They also have a language of their own.
Their domain extends to the Red Sea. It is therefore necessary before
beginning this desert-expedition (Ill, tier; came ] and tent necessary) to
secure the protection ofthe sh√©kh of the'Abtbdeh. - The route leads through
a sandstone region, with many small seyal-aeacias. Passing a (4 hrs.)
Well and then the Tomb of a saint, we reach the (3 hrs.) First Station
on the desert-route, consisting of two rectangular spaces 45 50 ft. long
surrounded hy wall. The Second Station, on the route leading to the
Red Sea (comp. R. 6, p. 78), is 6 hrs. farther on. Near it lies the temple,
beautifully situated at the foot of an isolated hill. The road to Roger
(p. 77) diverges to the N., at a valley planted with aeacias.

The Temple was discovered in 1816 by CrtiWaud, on his fhstjourney
to the mines of Mt. Zabdrah, where he. found old emerald-mines instead
of the sulphur that he expected. It is about 40 ft. long, and the front
portion is occupied by a VESIIBULE, about 22 ft. wide, with J columns,
of which the first pair form the entrance. The representations here
are familiar to us from other Egyptian temples. Ring B'eti 1. appears
before Ammon-Ra, who hands tn him the sword of victory.'He smiles
the princes of the miserable Eush' (Ethiopia). Behind Ammon are 10
names of fettered tribes. Ammon speaks:'Receive the sword, Oh King,
lord of the peoples, to smite down the princes of Hush and to cut oft their
heads. Fear of thee penetrates their limbs like Sekhet in her wrath.' On
the other wall the king appears before 11mm: (Hum { mine mare smiling
bis foes At the rear-wall of this vestibule and in two niches to the
right and left of the entrance to the next hall are Osiris Statue The next
time, about 161/2 ft. square. is, like the back-wall of the preceding, entirely
hewn out of the rock. It contains a pillars. At the back are three niches
each with a triad of gods; in the centre is Ramenma (Seti I.) himself.
The interesting Inscriptions here record, among other things. that the king
came hither in the tith year of his reign on his way to the gold-mines,
accompanied by a large retinue and by architects, and caused wells to he
sunk etc. - On an adjoining rock are three steles. On One of these is
the goddess Aasit on horseback, with a shield in her left hand; the second
is dedicated to the oflicial entrusted by Seti with the sinking of the well;
and on the third is the kneeling ftgure of Ani, king's son of Rush and
commander of the Mazai (police). Higher up on the rock are figures
of gazelles, Greek graffiti, and the preenomen of Amunhotep Ill, preceded
by the statement:'made by prince Mermes'.

Farther along the E. bank (12 M. from Edfd), on the mountainslopes approaching close to the river near the hill es-8'erO, are the
picturesque remains of { tn ancient'Arab fortress with a mosque.
This is sometimes identified with the ancient Tlrmuis, which,
however, more probably lay farther to the S.

Near the village of el-Hesh beside the Gebel Abu Shcgah, on the
W. bank, a great number of inscriptions and drawings of very
various dates have been found scratched on the rocks.

The oldest King's Name met with is that of an Usertesen (12th Dyn.),
but most of the devices are of a very much later date. Greek names
are not wanting, and most of the inscriptions appear to have been carved
by masons who worked in the large quarries, which are still to be found
beside the village of eI-Hesh. The signature of a builder's foreman,

Amam, and numerous susmsmasonsmarks (, f e, e, M,









O
seem to support this conclusion.

We here find giraffes, horses, gazelles, boats, fighters, etc., closely
resembling those at Wtidi Mokatteh (Vol. L, p. 493); and there is also
the picture of a man with an ex, an elephant, an ostrich, and a capitally
executed dog. Among Egyptian Names are those of Amenhotep, Asr1rhotep,
