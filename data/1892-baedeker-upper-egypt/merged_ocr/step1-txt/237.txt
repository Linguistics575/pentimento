There are in all'23 princes, of whom only the thirteenth need still be
mentioned. After the death oft'2 brothers he ascended the throne
at a ripe age. As we may gather from the list to the left, this is
Merenptuh, frequently though inaccurately named the Pharaoh ofthe
Exodus, whose name as king was afterwards added in the cartouehe
above him. A similar honour naturally could not fall to any of the
other princes. On the columns appears Ramses H. offering sacrifices
to and receiving gifts from the'gods worshipped in the ltamesseuni',
conspicuous among whom ai'e Amman in his various forms, Seth,
Thoth, Isis, Ms, Nut, Sekhet, etc.

The Second Smaller Colonnaded Ball JI. IO, with four couple
of papyrus-bud columns, is remarkable for two features. The f1rst
is the roof richly decorated with astronomical representations, proving that the Ramesseum was a monument dedicated to the worship
of the dead. The second is a representation on the N. part of the
rear-wall (the S. part is ruined), which seems to support the statement of Diodorus that a sacred library was deposited in the tomb
of Osymamlyas, with the legend'Hospital for the soul' (Yr/rs
iatpeiov). The Pharaoh, with all the royal attributes, sits upon his
throne. At his side rises the leafy persea-tree, with heart-shaped
fruit, upon which the king's name is being written by three deities,
viz to the left Tum on a lofty throne, to the right the goddess of
history, and behind her Thoth-Hermes. Behind Tum are the words:
'Address ot'Aramon-Tum, lord of the great hall (of Heliopolis), in
the Ramessenm to his son Ramses. the beloved of Ammon. Up, for
the distinguishing of thy name to all eternity, that it may be preserved on the sacred persea-tree'. In this hall also, on either side
of the door, is a procession with the sacred boats of Math, Khunsu.

The following Room CPI. E) is much injured, though four columns are still standing. It contains lists of offerings, and a few not
uninteresting se11lptures (m the door-pills, which seem
still farther to support the belief that we are now in the rooms of a
Library. The figures 0ftheThehan triad are not unusual; but the forms
ofSafekh, mistress of libraries, and Thoth-Hermes, the celestial
scribe (both facing the room we have now entered) are noticeable
The god is accompanied by a form representing the personified sense
of sight, with an eye as his symbol; the goddess by the personified
sense of hearing, with an ear above his head. Thoth writes down
the resolutions and thoughts of the god, while Safekh, the goddess
of history, causes the fame of the great deeds of the past to ring in
the ears of posterity. The dedicatory inscription states that this
door was overlaid with silver-gilt (electrumj, and Champollion
found that the very low relief was formerly covered with a cloth
mated with stuc-eo, and was then probably gilded. No traces of the
gilding is now to be found. - The side-rooms adjoining this W.
