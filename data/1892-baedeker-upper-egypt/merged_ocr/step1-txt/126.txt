The names of the three kings and their pyramids were found in the
inscriptions to the right and left of the entrance (outside). The
tomb is in the form of a rectangle, with the mummy-shaft opening in the back-wall. The representation of Atkhenu, to the left
of the entrance, is very lifelike and derives peculiar interest from
the fact that the grandees of the early period are seldom represented,
as here, in full military activity. Our hero, another Una (see
Buedeker's Lower Egypt, p. 307), lifts the arm vigorously to strike
his foe. The mode of wearing the hair and headdress, seen both
in this figure and that of Atkhenu's wife, is unusual. Atkhenu was
a rich man, possessing, according to the inscriptions, 2350 oxen.
On the left side of the rear-wall are represented several scenes from
the private life of the deceased. Cattle are being slaughtered, cooks
are busy at their work, etc. Above the door leading to the mummyshaft we see a large altar, adjoining which is a long but much dam-.
aged inscription. - The smaller tombs in the vicinity are less
interesting. Several Coptic inscriptions testify that anchorites found
retreats in these tombs during the Christian period. We are now
approaching the region which, in the time of Pachomius, was most
thickly populated with monks and anchorites.

Farther on we pass a fine mountain-mass, which looks especially
imposing by afternoon light, and see several thriving villages, often
situated close to the river. Deslmeh,'a steamboat-station 011 the
N. bank, 13 M. from Kasr es.s-fiaiytul, is situated on the ruins of an
ancient town.

The-site of the celebrated Tabenna, which lay between Him (Diospolie) and Denderah (Tentyra), must be sought for either here or close tn
Keneh. It belonged to the name of Tentyra and its Coptic name was
Tabemteseh, which may be translated'place of the Isis palms', The Greeks
supposed that'nesi' meant mm (nesos) or island, and hence it comes that
the town of Tabennesus, situated on the mainland, is generally spoken of as
the Island of Tabenna. It is said that the Arabs name it Geziret el-Gharl
0r Isle of the West, but no support of this could be found on the spot.
St. Jerome relates that at the end of the with can he fewer than
50,000 monks assembled in the district of Tabennesus to celebrate the
Easter Festival. All of these followed the rule of Pachomius and her
lunged either to the chief monastery (Monasterium Majus) or to the
smaller coenobia, laurae, and anchorite cells dependent on it. It is marvellous that the temple of Denderah (p. 80), so close to this community
at fanatics, should have been left almost intact. Perhaps the explanation
is that at the time the monks settled here the strife about dogmas aroused
much more excitement in the ecclesiastical breast than the dislike of
heathen gods that had long since become harmless.

56 M. [ 17 M. from Deshneh) Keheh (steamer-station), a town
with 15,400 inhab., lies on the E. bank of the Nile at the point where
the river, suddenly abandoning its northward course, turns to the w.,
almost at right angles. It is the capital of the fifth Mudiriyeh of
Upper Egypt, which is 5973q. M. in extent and contains a population
of406,858.The Greek name ofthe town was Ktuvir: .o1x or'Newtown'.
