A much more interesting journey than that to Gebel trukhiin is the
trip to (raga, or at least to it'ttdi Hamamatt. where there are numerous
Egyptian inscriptions. For the journey (there and harm 10-11 days should
be allowed, and Egypiologists will probably want 2-3 days more. It is

nothing is done to keep it in repair, it is rapidly falling into decay, like

imperceptibly, through a monotonous plain, intersected in all directions
by small undulating heights. All around us extends the interminable
