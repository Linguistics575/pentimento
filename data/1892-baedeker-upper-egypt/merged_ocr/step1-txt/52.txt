4 Route 1. ATFIU. From Cairo

A little farther to the N. is the tomb of Aid, the wife of Nefermat.
On the architrave over the doorway we see the husband of the deceased
engaged in snaring birds, while a servant presents the spoil to the mistress of the house, whose complexion is of a brilliant yellow. On the
outside wall, to the left, we observe the cattle of the deceased browsing
on reeds. On the right stands Nefermtt, who, as the inscription informs
us,'caused this monument to be erected to his gods in indestructible
characters'. Among the domestic animals are several cattle of very
bright colours. We also notice a gazelle held by the horns by a butcher,
who is cutting off its head. 0frerings of wine were also made at this
early period. In the passage leading to the Serdah is a group of labourers lmsily at work. The hunting-scenes are curious, and, notwithstanding
their simplicity remarkably true to nature. Among them is a greyhound
seizing a gazelle by the leg, and another carrying a loug-eared hare.

A few paces to the N.E. is another mastaba built of well-hewn blocks
of limestone. The hieroglyphics and low reliefs, resembling those in
the tomb of Ti at Saitlfirah, are admirably executed. The deceased interretl here was named Khent, and his wife Mara. Traversing the vestibule and a narrow passage, we reach e tomb here ] with a saeritieial
table; in the passage, on the right, is a handsome male figure with a
lasso, and on the left are stone-masons, engaged in making stureophagi.
On the left, in the innermost niche of this tomb, we perceive the deceased, and on the right, his wife. We next come to a ruined mastaha,
and to another tomb, half excavated, Which was constructed for R (zva
tap, a son of Suefru, one of the highest civil and military dignitaries of
the kingdom, and his wife Nefert, a relation of the royal family. The
statues of this married couple, who died young, or at least are so represented, which are now among the principal treasures of the museum of'
Gizeh, were found here Farther to the W. are several other tombs, now
covered up.

On the right bank, opposite Rililiah and about 11/2 M. from the
river, lies the hamlet of At.fil1, with some mounds of earth and
debris representing the ancientAphroditopolis, the territory ofwhich,
according to Strabo, adjoined that of Acanthus (Dammit), while its
capital lay on the Arabian bank of the Nile. A town of Aphrodite
must also he one of IIathor, the Egyptian goddess of love, to whom
the white cow, which Strabo says was worshipped here, was sacred;
it was the capital of Matennu, the 22nd nome of Upper Egypt. Its
hieroglyphic name was Tep Me, head of the now.

In the Christian period (ea. 310 A.D.) Aphroditopolis gained some celebrity from St. Anthony, who fixed his hermitage in the mountains to
the E. of the town, beside a well and a group of palms. So many pilgrims of every class, age, and sex sought out the holy man, that a. regular
posting route, with relays of camels, was laid out across the desert. St. Am.
thony, however, fled from his admirers and buried himself deeper in the
mountains. But while he thus shook off his earthly visitants, he could
not so easily escape those extraordinary tempters from spirit-land, at which
Gallot has taught us to smile, though to St. Anthony himself, as well as
to St. Hilarion and other similarly persecuted auchorites, the contest was
one of bitter earnest. The Coptic convent of Mir Antonins (p. 5), a few
leagues higher up, on the E. side of the Nile, still sends supplies to the
convent of St.Anthony, situated in the heart of the Arabian Desert (p. 6).

After passing a few small islands, we now reach (W. bank) e1Wastah (pp. 1 and 36; post-office and Arab telegraph at the.rail.
stat., 1/4 M. from the Nile), where passengers bound for the Fayrlm
leave the dhahabiyeh and betake themselves to the train (see R. 2).
El-Wastah is pleasantly situated in a grove of palms and is sur
rounded with fiehls of clover.
