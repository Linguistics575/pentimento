were opened on the hills (Wount Grenfell') lying to the W. 0pposite Assuan, first by Mustafah Shakir, British consular agent at Assuin, and then by Major-general Sir F. Grenfell. They lie about

an ancient staircase, hewn in the rock, ascends for about $ 5011.,

tombs of the 6th and 12th Dynasties.r Tomb No. 96, with a curious
door placed one-third up the height of another door, belongs to a
