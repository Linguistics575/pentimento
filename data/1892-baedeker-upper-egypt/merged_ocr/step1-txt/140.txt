entrance of the ruler into the sanctuary and to the ceremony of
incense, to which he must submit in the first chamber according to
the prescribed ritual, In the first we see the king (Nero) quitting
his palace, preceded by five banners with sacred figures, while the
high-priest (named Anmut-f) offers incense before him. In the
second design, Horus and Thoth sprinkle the king with the symbols
of life; in the third, the goddesses of the south (Nekheb) and of the
north (Uaz) present him with the white crown and the crown
'Nefert'; in the fourth and last, the king is conducted before IIather
by the gods Month of Thebes and Tum of Ileliopolis. Admission
into the temple proper was not granted to him until after this cert3mony had been gone through, the sacred garment assumed, and the
purification by incense and holy water completed. The representations referring to these, and the explanatory inscriptions, are
quite in the same manner as those we have already noted in the
earlier temples of the time of Tutmes and Ramses

The sculptured ornamentation on the ceiling, dealing with
astronomical subjects, is divided into a W. and an E.half. The
figures in the t section are turned towards the N. (outside), those of
the other to the S. (inside). Each sectionis divided intothree bands,
most of which consist of two or more rows. The exterior bands of
each section correspond to each other, as do also the central and
inner bands. Between the two sections is another band, containing
10 sun-discs and 11 vultures, explained by Prof. Lauth as referring
to the 21st year of the reign of Tiberius. - The exterior bands,

principal constellations (Orion, Sirius, Sothis) and tire planets
(Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury). Mingled with the
other figurtss are the gods ofthe twelve hours of night, on the E. side

with the'Deeani' or presidents of the weeks, mentioned elsewhere
in other inscriptions. This long series begins in the W. section and
ends in the E. section. The second bands, both on the right and left,
consist of two rows each. At the four ends ofthe upper rows are the
four Winds, with expanded wings, which are adjoined on the right
(next the entrance) by four figures of gods referring to Ra, and on the
left by four similar figures referring to Tum, the god of evening.
