occupied by a continuous representation of the vault of heaven,
embraced by the long extended figure of Nut, with the twelve hours
of the day F) and thew, of the night, (how of the night (A). At the end are two celestial charts, and tables of the culmination of stars during the
hours of night, from fortnight to fortnight throughout the year.
miler tables are found in Tomb G.) The results are arranged on the
different parts of a human figure. Biet, the French astronomer,
used these tables in calculating the date of their formation. - W.

which the corner pillars remain unfinished. The sarcophagus placed
in the centre is destroyed. On the pillars appears the king praying
to various gods. This has been called the Hall of Astronomy, Ion
account of the representations on the roof, whhl have been executed
with the greatest skill and with incredible labour and trouble. We
here see, twice, the goddess Nut, with stars and gods, who sail in
boats on the lake of the heavens. The deities of the hours also
appear, with curious symbols beside them. Next the entrance is the
sky by day, towards the back wall, the sky by night. The imagination of the artist who designed this ceiling-painting was lieentions, as the immodest representation in the left angle indicate.
On the long wall to the right, above, are the Hours, looking
behind them, and each casting; en the one preceding a ray from
the disc on her head. Then follow the most varied forms of
the light-ged, the solar-dis; the stars, etc.; and finally an inter
