the steamboat terminus for the lower Nile, with a post and telegraph
office, lies on the E. bank, partly on the plain and partly on a hill,
in N. lat. 2.io 5' 30". The fertile strip here is narrow, but supports
numerous date-palms, the fruit of which still enjoys a high reputation. The native inhabitants have increased under the British
occupation to about 10,000; but that number is only a fraction of
its former population, when according to Arabian authors, no less
than 20,000 died of the plague at one time. Some of the houses

1lervishes have a house here in which they meet on Fridays for
prayer. A considerable trade is carried on in the products of the

wards by the Nile to Keneh, Assiu, or Cairo. Among the chief exports are ostrich feathers, ivory, india-rubber, senna, tamarinds,
wax, skins, horns, and dried dates. The steamers and dhahabiyehs
are here boarded by negroes, Nubians, and handsome Beduins,
with artistically dressed curly hair, who offer for sale ostrich feathers
and fans, silver rings and armlets, ivory hoops, weapons from Gentral Africa, small monkeys, amulets, beautiful basket-work, and
aprons of leather fringe, the costume of the women of the Sridin,
which they oddly call'Madama Nubia'. they and black ostrich
feathers are comparatively cheap (8 piastre == er. each), larger
and perfect white feathers cost to-WJ:. apiece and upward. Trasellers who desire to buy in quantity should betake themselves to
one of the wholesale dealers in the town. The bazaar is like the
bazaars of all Nile towns, but is distinguished for its excellent local
pottery of great beauty of form. Candles, porter, ale, and even
tolerable Dutch cigars may be obtained at a Turkish'bakkal'. Copper money is, curiously enough, accepted very unwillingly in
Assuin and the rest of Nubia; the traveller should provide himself
beforehand with silver piastres.
