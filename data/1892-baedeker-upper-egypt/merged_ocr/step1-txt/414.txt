rt1nefer. governor gf Cf ten of the land of Wawa. On the

M
E. part of the S. wall is inscribed a record of the presentation of
lands for the maintenance of the statues of the king in the town of

K' -ll mm. which was apparently the name of this place
=

or of rArmidab.

On the E. wall is a royal prince of Kush, standing, fan in hand, before
Ramses VI, and announcing to him the gift of Peanut, who presented
the adjacent statues of the king and two silver anointing-vessets. In the
lower row, Pennut and Ta Kim, bis wife, the singer of Amman, present
an offering before their deceased relations, the men being represented
above, the women below. These family scenes are continued on the E.
part of the N. Wall; above is the worship of Harmachis, below that of
Osiris. On the Ir. part of the N. wall and continued on the w. wall
and half of the S. wall are scenes relating to the worship of the dead.
Penullt appears on his knees before a mountain, from which the head of
Hathor, a goddess of the under-world, projects among 1otns-flowers.
Within the mountain is a chapel with a tapering roof, and in front of
the mountain is the' goddess Ape, holding a frog in her hand. On the
w. wall is the preparation of the mummy of the deceased, and the presentation of the deceased and his wife to Osiris, by Horns, son of Isis.
Beneath, the fields of Aalnm are being tilled; and Harmachis. Tam, and
Khepera, seated upon a pedestal, are receiving homage. On the W. half
of the S. wall are the balances of the dead, the entrance to the grave,
and the laying of the deceased in the vault by a long train of mourning
relations.

A little above Anibeh (p. 329) a f1at-toppetl hill of some size
rises steeply from the Nile on the E. Upon this stands the partly
ruined fort of Kasr Ibrim, dating from Roman times. A visit to it
is interesting. The ascent is made on the N. At the top are some
blocks with the name of Taharka of the 25th Dyn. and a basilica
with Byzantine capitals of granite. Igasr Ibrim is identified with
the Roman Primis Farm or Premis, a fortress stormed by Petronius
(p. 302), who afterwards restored it and gut ned it with 400 men,
with provisions for two years. At the beginning of the 16th cent.
the sultan Selim placed a garrison of Bosnians here, whose descendents were defeated in 1811 by the fleeing Mamelukes. Finally
Ibrahim Pasha captured the fortress.

In the S. slope of the mountain, not far above the river-bank,
are five grottoes hewn in the rock, all of which except the most
northerly. bear inscriptions. The first (on the S.) shows over the
entrance the cartouches of Tutmes HL/beloved by Horas, lord of

____D
Irrmr, C), and by Sati, mistress of the land of I (hent'. This

grotto belonged to Netti, overseer of the palace and royal son
(probably only a title), and overseer of the S. land. Beside a much
damaged relief of Nehi presenting booty or tribute from the S. land
to the king, is the inscription:'Bringing of the tribute of the S.
lands in gold, ivory, and ebony, by the gracious overseer, the privy
councillor..... , the royal son, and president of the S. land
