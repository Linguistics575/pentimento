- with by modern buildings. The
l house of Moharb Todrus, the German consular agent (p. 102), lies
farther to the N., near the landing, place, where traces of an ancient
nu construction may be seen, which

is unfortunately disappearing before the annual inundations, and
not far from the principal pylon. To the left of the main pylon
is the village, with a shop, kept
by a Greek, at which provisions
of all kinds and porter, ale, c, etc. may be purchased. Farther to the NE. dwell numerous
ghaw√©zi.

The removal of later buildings
from the *Temple of Luxor has
rendered it easy to reconstruct its
ground-plan (see opposite), and to
see that its erection was gradual
and more or less affected by the
existence of still earlier buildings.
The general main axis of the temple
Hes from S.W. to NE; but the
axis of the N. portion deviates considerably from the direction of that
of the S. portion, partly on account

. of the shape of the river-bank,

partly because itwas desired to have
the pylons at Luxor corresponding
to those of Karnak, A careful
examination indeed reveals three
different axial directions. These
deviate from the true meridian, at
an angle of "21" on the s., and
at an angle of Mo on the N, As
was the custom, the part of the
temple containing the sanctuary
(the S. part) was built first, including the large peristyle hall. This
took place in the 18th Dyn. under
Amenhotep 111., while the W. portions were added by Ramses 11.
From the obelisks to the back of
the sanctuary, the total length of
the temple is 284 yds. Later kings,
