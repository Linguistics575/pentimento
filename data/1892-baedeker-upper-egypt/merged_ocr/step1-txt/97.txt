remains of the, ancient city, of the lake, and the desert. Each gate of this
curious building is surmounted by a winged disc of the sun; and over
the doors leading into the second and third rooms of the prosekos and
into the sanctuary, instead of the ordinary concave cornice, there is a
series of Urmus snakes, which, with their outstretched heads and bendng necks, tngether form "kind of cornice. The names of several { raw
CHEFS are engraved on the stone of the that mom, including these of Paul
Lucas, It. Poeocke, Jnmard, Roux, d'Anville Coutelle, Bellier, Burton,
lielzoni, Hyde, and Paul Martin. Fate liuriin has also been visited by
Lepsius. There are no ancient inscriptions remaining.

To the E. of the large temple are situated two smaller Ruman temples,
in tolerable preservation, the larger of which, situated 300 paces from the
smaller, is not without interest. Its walls (18 ft. by 19 ft.) consist of
good bum bricks, and Its substructures of Solid stone; the cella terminales in a niche resembling an apse; on each of the side-walls are
two 1talf-culnmas which, as the fragments lying "n the ground show,
belong tn the Ionic, order. There are also some less important ruins
covering an extensive area. but nothing has been found among them
dating from an earlier period than the Roman The construction of the
walls, the architectural forms, and many coins found here, are Roman;
and none of these small relics of the period of the Pharaohs, which are
usually found so abundantly among the ruins of Egypt, have been discovered here. This was perhaps the site of the ancient Diottysias, a town
which probably sprang up on the ruins of u anan military station,
situated on the extreme western side of Egypt. On the outskirts of the
ruins are walls which perhaps belonged to gardens; there must also have
been once an aqueduct for the Purpose of supplying the inhabitants and
their gardens with water.

From Nu Karim to Dimeh is one day's journey. Dimeh is
situated opposite to the point at which we approach the lake from
Fynhtor. The scanty ruins on the S. bank of the lake (El-long-nu'unah, eta ], are not worthy of a visit; but the ruins ot'Dimeh, al-.
though no inscriptions have been found there, present some attraction. A street, 4003113. in length, formerly embellished with figures
of lions, leads to a platform on which an important temple once,
stood. The numerous blocks scattered about here, resembling millstones, and apparently artifieially rounded, are discovered on closer
inspuetion to be of natural formation, The paved court was surrounded by a brick wall, and the temple itself contained several
apartments; a peristyle, with columns now in ruins, led to the entmuee. Notwithstanding the imperfect state of the ruins, they
sut3iec to prove, that a town of very considerable importance, per
haps the ancient Bacchis, once stood here.
