known. From the hieroglyphies ou the rocks and iemple-walls at Tamimi'st we learn that the ancient Kuptns mad formed a link. as early as
3000 years before our era. in the intercourse carried on between the Nile
valley and Arabia, vil the desert and the sea.

We now ride in' s E. direction through a dreary district, in which
the only variety is afforded by an occasional Mobzrala Or Jlalmtta. The
) Intawalas are simply spaces covered with camel's dung, easily distinguished from the surrounding soil by their darker eaten and their smooth,
eemunt-like surface. They occur on every great caravan route at regular
intervals and are of the utmost importance as sign-posts showing the road.
Hence no khabir or camel-driver passes one of these places withnut giving
his camels an opportunity to contribute their quota to the maintenance
of the Mubwala. The urtzmttas or ha11it1g-plhees are 7'/2-9 If. apart and
serve also as measures of distance. The swift-running camels take their
name from the number of mahattas they can reach in one day. Thus a
camel which can cover 10 mahattas, i.e. 75-90 M, in one day is known
as an'Ashm-i (runner of'ten'). Uther milestones of the desert are aifrorrded
by the skeletons er camels. horses, and asses. and hy small cairns above
the remains of unfortunate travellers who have [ lost their lives in this
dreary waste.

The Foyh caravans usually pass the second night in the village of LaI.ris.tah C) hrs. from Knit and Bir'Amhar, 121/2 hrs. from Keneh). which is
chiefly inhabited by'Ababdeh; it is also a halting-plaee for caravans coming in the opposite direction The small oasis has two wells, five palms, a
small piece of tilled ground, a few mud-huts, and a half-ruined Arab caravanserai. It is a characteristic specimen ofa desert-village and offers much
to interest the stranger. It is a place of great comfort and eOnvenienee
to the traveller, as its resources include the materials for a solid and
satisfying supper in the shape of mutton, goat's flesh, poultry, eggs, ete.
The dogs here are great thieves. and care should be taken to leave nothing
within their reach at night. Near the chief well are some fragments of
a Greek inscription of the reign of Tiberius Claudius.

The first Human military sialion, the Bydreyma, now called hy the
Arabs [ fasr el-Benoit ('castle of the maidens'), is 3 hrs. from Lak√©tah. It
lies to the S. of the caravan route and forms an oblong 125 ft. in length
and 101 it. in breadth The wall inclosing the oblong. formed of la me
of sandstone without cement, was 6% it. high, Within the wall lie 20
small chambers opening on a rectangular inner court. the only exit from
which is an the N side. No water is now procurable here. To the N.
of the path. opposite the ruin of the Hydreuma, stands a rock of sandstone with numerous graffiti in Greek, Coptic, Arabic, Himyaritic, and
Sinaitic characters.

At a distance of about 2 hrs. frnm the Hydreuma the rocks close in
and form a winding pass or gateway named Mayra ]; es-Seldm. On the
Gebel Abtt hWeh r-ihther or the elbow'), the rock at the entrance to the
pass, "are more graffiti. older than those at t i el-Beniit; one of them
contains the name of the religious reformer Amenhntep IV. We now
approach the fine rocky scenery through which the second part of the
linger mute leads. In the distance, to the right, rise the S. foot-hills nf
the [ Innuimtit Awe" while nearer and in front are the S.W. spurs. ThroughOut the whole of the Nile valley from Cairo totPhilae the traveller encounters no such picturesque scenery as he sees in traversing the magnitieeut rocky formations of this part ofthe Egyptian-Arabian desert. Even
the imposing granite cliffs of the Shelia ] islands and the quarries of Assuiia
pale before the rocky mass of the Ifamiirtu'it, rising to a height of 4200 ft.
The outliers of the range consist of a yellow sandstone, followed by the
red'Nuhian' sandstone, resembling that of the Black Forest, while the great
central mass is composed of granite.

Beytmd the Mutmk carStzlfxm the hills again diverge. Among them
In the s. of the caravan-route, lies a second Roman station, with a iilledin well. About ths. farther on the hills of reddish-yellow sandstone
give place to loftier and almost hlack hills of breccia, through the valleys
of which, now wide and 110W narrow, the caravan winds its way. Begin
