make it more magnilieent than before".

An inscription (on the outside of the E. girdle-wall) states that
this beautiful monument (the present temple) lay behind (is. probably to the S. of) the building of his father; another Con the inside of the same wall) records that the foundation-stone was laid
in the time of Ptah in the holy place of Tes Her for the God Ra;
and a third (on the inside of the N. girdle-wall) informs us (on the
left) that the building was carried out'as it was in the plan of the
great writing that fell from heaven to the b. of Memphis', and (on
the right) that'this great wall was built according to the book of
the arrangement of temples, written by the Kherheb Imhotep, son of
the god Ptah'.

An inscription in one of the crypts at Deuderah (Mariette 111, 78) mentions a festal journey of Hathor from Denderah (p. 80) to the temple of
Horus at Edfu. This festival, which was established by Tutmes III.
(1800 B.C.1 took place at the new moon of the month Epiphi.
The Naos, still to be found in the holy of holies (p. 2:12 ], bears
the name-rings of Nectanebus I. (378-380 B.C.) and probably
dates from the original temple. The document, inscribed on the
outside of the E. wall of the temple, relating to the gifts of lands,
mentions King Darius as well as Nectanebus I, and Nectanebus 11.
as benefactors of the temple.

Two accounts of the building of the present temple have come
down to us, The shorter of these occurs on the outside of the W.
wall of the temple proper, in the second line of the lower marginal
inscription, dating from the time of Ptolemy IN. Euergetes IL;
the other, at greater detail, in the one-line lower Marginal fnscription, on the outside of the W. girdle-wall. 1n the second inscription we read as follows:

'On this beautiful day of the opening of the building in the 10th year
(supplied from the shorter inscription), on the 7th Epiphi (Le. Aug. 23,
237 13.0.), in the time of King Ptolemy 111. Euergetes l, It was a festival
of the Sixth, when the interior of the ground was opened, the tirst of all
the festivals of the Sixth of the ceremony of laying the foundation.

The king himself, along with the goddess Safekh, was engaged in fulfilling the ceremony of laying the foundation of the adytum, the startingpoint for determining its halls. Its side-ehambers (were erected) in their
places, carefully arranged by the wise (zasu). The sacred architects built
with the lord of the papyrus-writing. The great hall of the temple was
finished, the sanctuary (mesen) of the golden hawk was prepared, by the
10th year, on the 7th Epiphi, in the reign of King Ptolemy IV. Philopatm" (a date corresponding to Aug. 17, 212 B.00, Thus 25 years (237 13.0.
to 212 B.C.) were spent in erecting the walls of the temple.

The decoration of the walls with hieroglyphies and reliefs and the
completion of the great gateway and of the two doors to one of the halls
are noted as follows:

'The inscribing of its walls with well-executed sculpture of the
name', the great ones, of His Majesty, and with the iigures of the gods and
goddesses, the dignified ones of the shining city (one of the many names
of Edfu), and the finishing of its great door, and of the two wings of the
door of its hall (lasted) till the 16th year of His Majesty. (The first year
