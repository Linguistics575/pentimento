This tomb was named by the French Expedition La Tombs de la
Métempsychose, and by British scholars, following the groundless
traditions of the Romans, the Tomb ofMemnon. This large tomb
is characterized by an abundance of mystic representations and inscriptions. of which, however, none are executed in a good style.
Coptic and Greek inscriptions are most numerous in this tomb;
among them one to the effect that'Hermogenes of Amasa has seen
and admired the Syringes; but this tomb of Memnon, after he had
examined it, he more than admired' (or admired more than the others,
51: -;). - It is a remarkable fact that the cartouches of
Ramses TI. are superimposed upon others, which either represent the
earlier name ofll amses YI., or probably of his predecessor Ramses V.

Before the doors are representations like those before No. 8. f. To the right is the king before Ilarmaehis, to the left, before Osiris,
then the serpent Apep, demons ssith heads of bulls and serpents,
chained captives, ctr. - ll. Representation like those in Room v. of
No.8:'the heniu of the deep','the bearers ofthecord in the fields ofthe
deep', etc. In achapel with steps appears Osiris, and on the steps are
men with a guide. Above is a boat, out ofwhieh an ape is driving a pig
