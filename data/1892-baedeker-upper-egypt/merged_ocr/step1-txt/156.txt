From Keneh

of Cleopatra, with the sistrum and the Mena-necklace. Before his
mother standsPtolemy Kisres, or Causation, the son of Caesar, offering incense. Both are worshipping Isis and her son Horus.

Behind the temple of HathOr is a Temple of Isis, consisting ofa
vestibule and three chambers. The unattractive and uninteresting building, which is partly covered with rubbish, owes its origin to the emperor
Augustus. The gate facing the E. bears the Egyptian cartouches of Claudius
and Nero, and two Greek inscriptions on the entahlature mention the
let year of Tiberius. This gateway marks the limit of the temple area
in this direction; and about 10 min. farther on we reach another gate,
which apparently belonged to another temple-precinct. It bears the u'ru"
touch of Antoninus.

8. From Keneh to Thebes (Luxor).

47 N. STEAMBOAT in about 5 hrs. Cook's mail-steamer halts for
21/2 hrs. at Eeneh on Wed. and Sat. mornings on its downward voyage,
and crosses thence to Denderah.

Keneh, see p. 72. The steamer passes three islands. On the
W. bank lies the village of Butts, with clay-deposits from which
most of the'Keneh pottery' is made (p. 73). Bal√©lis (pl. of Ballis,
named after the village), 1iilalCyl.0fl01lle), and other kinds ofjars,
some of considerable size, lie on the banks awaiting shipment.

121/2 M. (E bank) Knit, the ancient Koptos, nearly opposite
Ballast Though now of no importance, this place was down to the
time of the Khalifs a populous and thriving trading-town.

Even in antiquity a canal, mentioned by Straho and still
traceable, led from the Nile to the walls of the town, past which the
Canal amethL 100lnow flows. One of the stones of the bridge
is said to bear the name of an Antef (11t11 Dyn.); and there is also
a Greek inscription from the same place, of the 8th year of Trajan
and dedicated to the tricoloured Isis. To the S. of the town and on
the road leading to the desert are various remains of aneientbuildings. One of these is a square pillar of red granite, bearing a
dedication by Tutmes Ill. to Ammon Ra, and apparently a relic
of a temple built by that monarch. Still farther to the S. is a
narrow passage, with inscriptions of the reign of Cains Caligula,
dedicated to Khern Ra of Koptos upon his Staircase (comp. p.178).
The staircase with 14 ascending and 14 descending steps typifies
the waxing and waning moon (comp. p. 85). The boat of Khem,
home by four priests, is here depicted, and beside it is an address
to the priests of Khem upon his Staircase. The most Ponsiderable
relic of antiquity, a fragment of black granite, probably part of
an altar, lies to the N. It comprises an exaltation of Khem, Isis,
and 11011 (eternity) by Ptolemy XIII. Neos Dionysus.

Koptos is mentioned on very early monuments and also by Greeks
and Romans at a late period. Theophrastus, Pausanias, Athenseus, Plutarch,
Josephus, Elian, Lucian, Stephanns of Byzantium, Agatharchides, Pliny,
Ammianus Mareellinus, Apuleius, and many other authors, all mention
it, proving the widely-spread fame of the city. It was especially famous

for its commerce. The trade-route, Which now leads from Iioyr on_the
ted Sea to lieneh, formerly ended at Koptos, where Nile-Mats received
