behind the fortress of Katesh. Then they pressed forth on the S. side of
Katesh and attacked the centre of the legion of Ra, which was on the
march, and having no warning was unprepared for the battle. The archers
and chariots gave way before them. His Majesty alone had made a halt
to the N. of the fortress Katesh, on the w. bank of the Orontes. News
was brought to His Majesty of what had happened. And behold, the king
rose up like his father Mani. (the and of war); he seized bis weapons and
put on his armour, like Baal in his hour. The noble horses that bore his
majesty ('Ticiory for Thebes' was their name) came forth from the stable
of Ramses, the beloved of Ammon. and the king dashed in his attack
into the midst of the miserable Kheta. He was alone and no other was
with him. And as he hastened on before the eyes of those that followed
him, he found himself surrounded by 2500 chariots of war, (cut off) from
his return by all the warriors of the miserable Kheta and the numerous peoples that accompanied them; by the people of Arados, Ilysia,
and Pisidia (Aratu, Masa, Pidasa). Each of their chariots bore three men,
and they had all united themselves.'No prince was with me, no general,
no commander of the archers 0r chariots. My soldiers have deserted me,
and my knights have fled before them; not One or them has made a stand
to tight by my side'. Then spoke his majesty:'Who art thou, it father
Amman? does a father forget his son? Have I ever undertaken anything
without thee? Have I not walked and do I not stand ever according to
my words? Never have I trespassed thy commands... What are these
Semites to thee? Ammon renders the godless helpless. Have I not offered
to thee Countless saeciiic Through me my holy dwelling was filled
with my captives. I have built thee a temple for millions of years, and
I furnish thy store-houses with all my goods. f brought. the whole
world to thee to enrich thy possessions; 3b00 oxen l sacrificed to thee on
all manner of sweet-smelling wood. I have not failed to make thy foreeuurt. Stone pylons I erected for thee, and I myself erected the flag-staffs
before them. I caused obelis 5 lo Le brought from Elephanta, and it was
I who caused stones of eternal duration to be brought. For thee ships
plough the deep and bring to thee the tribute of the nations. Surely a
wretched fate awaits him who resists thy commands, hut happiness will
be in him who knows thee. I beseech thee, U father Ammon, look upon
me here in the midst of countless peoples who are strange to me An
nations have united themseives against me, and I am alone and no one
is with me. My numerous soldiers have deserted me; no one of my
knights looked out upon me when 1 called them; none of them heard
my voice. But I believe that Amman is of more value to me than a
million of soldiers, than a hundred thousand knights and a hundred
thousand brothers and young sons even were they gathered together in
one place. The work of multitudes of men is as nothing, Amman outweighs them all. This have I accomplished, (l Amman. according to the
counsel of thy mouth, and have not exceeded thy commands. Behold,
I have paid honour to thee to the uttermost ends of the earth'. My voice
sounded to Hermonthis and Amman came at my cry. He gave me his
hand, I uttered a cry ofjoy, and he spoke behind me: "I hasten to thine
aid, U Ramses, my son, beloved of Ammon I am with thee". - In the
farther course of his speech. Amman says"Not one of them (the foe)
finds his hand to fight-, their hearts have vanished from their breasts for
fright; their arms have become weak. They are no longer able to launch
their arrows, and strength fails them to hold their spears I thrust them
into the water, so that they fail in like the crocodile. They lie prone, one
upon another, and I spread death in their midst. I will not that one
should look behind him or that another should turn himself. He who
falls there shall not rise again". The king of course, as the epos goes on
to narrate, completely vanquished the Asiatics allied against him, after
hard fighting and after his charioteer himself had lost courage-Finally
the prince of the Kheta sends a messenger with a letter. His submission
is accepted; and Amman greets the Pharaoh returning in triumph.
