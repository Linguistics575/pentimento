28. From Assa2n to Philae.

a Passage of the First Cataract

The First Cataract (Arab. Sheila'l, from the earlier form DvUndal) lies
between Assuin and Philae. It must be passed by all who desire to
proceed in their own dhahabiyeh to Widi Hum and the second cataract.
When the river is high the passage is quite without danger, and though
it is more difficult at later periods of the year. nothing more serious
need be feared than some slight damage to the boat. A considerable amount
of time. however. is consumed by the passage, except under favourable
circumstances and when the river is at its highest. Including the necessary
preparations, 2-3 days must be set aside for the passage; and a carefully
drawn-up contract (p _ o will he found here especially useful. Travellers who have previously arranged with their dragoman to be conveyed to and from Wiidi Halfah for a fixed sum including the passage of
the cataract, will come "best. Those who have no such arrangement
must come to terms with one of the shékhs of the Shellél or chiefs of the
cataracts. With a reliable dragoman the matter may be arranged in ten
minutes, bat otherwise (too frequently the case) difficulties are sure to
arise. The boat will be objected to as too high, too weak, or two large,
the water will be described as too low, or the wind (which must certainly
be taken into the calculation) as too gentle; but none of these objections
should be listened to, if the dhahabiyeh has been originally hired to
ascend beyond the cataract. Energy and bakshish will overcome dif" culties.
If the dragnman prove too recalcitrant, the traveller should threaten to
proceed to Wadi Halfah by camel or by a dhahabiyeh from Philte. and to
bring an action for damages against the dragoman on his return to Cairo.
That will generally produce an effect; but the action for damages should
not, in the interest of future travellers, be allowed to remain an empty
threat. Dhahabiyehs may be hired above the cataract, but they are inferior and dear. The cost of ascending the rapids varies from 4 to 63.,
according to the size of the boat, to which it bakshish of at least 2-31. must
he added. This amount of bakshish mast be paid because as many as
50 or Even. When the vessel is large and the water low, 100 men
are required to tow a dhahabiyeh up the rapids. Travellers may remain
on board during the operation if they choose, but as the Passage takes
several hours, they lose much time.

Since the construction of the railway from Assuta to Phila?, and
owing to the disturbances caused by the Beduins, the journey between
the cataracts is now very seldom made by dhahabiyeh; and the ascent of
the rapids by a passengcr-hoat is quite exceptional.

The descent of the foaming rapid: is much more interesting. Those
who are very cautious my perhaps cause their more precious possessions
to be transported past the cataract by land; but serious accidents almost
never occur. though the wrecks of some dhahahiyehs On the banks prove
that the descent is not absolutely without danger. An excellent view of the
passage may be obtained from a rock on the bank (Bab esh-Shelldl, p. 278).

Passen, gers by Cook's steamers are conveyed down the rapids to
Aswan in a rowing-boat for L, a head, an interesting trip, not wholly
devoid of danger. A hall is made before the chief rapid, in order to view
the natives descending it on trunks of trees. As usual the visitor is
harassed by demands for bukshish. The voyage is then continued through
smaller channels, and at dangerous points, the boat is secured by ropes.
See description of a trip of this kind on p. 279.

The dhahabiyeh ascends in untroubled water as far as the island
of SehU. There it is surrounded by the dark, sinewy and generally
most symmetrical form, of the Arabs who are to tow it through the
rapids. Some come on board under the direction of a shékh. while
others remain on the bank. At first the dhahahiyeh passes the beginning of the rapids comparatively easily, but by-and-by, ropes
