the temple. In any case the chapels are, too small to have admitted more
than the heads of the ileputations from other parts of Egypt. Great weight
is laid upon the sacred number seven, as shown in the number of the
chapels themselves and in the seven heads of sparrow-hawks represented
in each. That the king should appear as the seventh object of worship
along with six gods is undoubtedly unusual; but it may he explained by
the fact that Seti built the seventh chapel, not for the adoration of himself while alive, but for a future period when he hoped to be merged in
Osiris. Neither Seti nor his son could avoid the interment oftheir mummies near the royal residence ofTheber, but it may he assumed that their
earthly remains received eunseeration at Abydos, and that the Memnonium
of Seti is to he regarded as a cenotaph, in which the Name of Pharaoh,
as a symbol of the king himself, was to be honoured and preserved. The
Pharaohs of the early empire possessed similar monuments here. These,
however, fell into decay during the Hyksos period; and Seti was enabled
to do what unfavourable times had hindered his predecessors from doing
- i.e. to build a new and costly Memnonium, in which a place was reserved, hear the tomb of Osiris, for the Name: of his royal ancestors. In
the arches above the niches in the rear-wall of the chapels are several
representations of the king oirering his Name, embolism hy the eartouehe
or ring C31 which surrounded royal names. In this way Abydos
came to be the most important place for the preservation of lists of kings.
The columned aisle leading to Seti's Chapel CPI. a) contains inscriptions
and representations relating to the king alone and showing us his relationship to the gods in its proper light. On the walled-up door to the first
hall we see Thoth, the Reason or Intelligence, the god of the sciences and
of historical records, offering a sacrifice in front of an image of the king
(the latter unfortunately mueh damaged). The inscription reeds u, Thoth,
the dweller in Ahydt F come to thee on aeeount of thy greatness and thy
glory. For the sake of thy sanctity as king, for the sake of thy might
and thy constancy on earth, and to make thee great', etc. - On the eolumns of the first hall the king is represented as sacrificing and receiving
the attributes of the kingdom from Thoth, Anubis Apheru, Hows the son
of Isis, and Henmuteti the high priest of Ahydns. The paintings on the
s. wall of the same hall show us the king as a boy, held in the arms of
Isis and suckleil at the divine breasts of the Iiathurs. They admit him
to the place of Horus, that he may increase in strength and ascend the
throne of Usiris as a man. Hathor, the queen-deity of Heliopolis in Abydos, calls herself the mother of his beauty, and says to him'Thou hast
been nourished by my milk, than who art adorned with the mm vu ofUppcr
Egypt'. The IIathor of Denderah calls herself his nurse, who raised her
arms to embrace his beauty. On the left side of the door farthest to the
left, also leading to the second hall, we see the king, wearing a helmet,
while Thoth pours over his head the signs of life and dominion. To the
right the king appears with the richly decorated royal crown, holding the
sceptre and scourge in his hands. The priest Henmutef burns incense before him, and the Nile brings him gifts, of which he is the producer. The
king has now passed frrm the boy Horns tn the man Osiris; IIenmutef
says:'I burn incense to thee and to thy name, 0 Osiris, King Ita-ma-men'.
The words put in the mouth ofthe Kile are:'l bring to thee in my arms
the superfluity as an uttering, 0 King, lord of both worlds!' (in the sides
of the columns facing the aisle leading to the royal chapel are represented
Anubis-Avhuru handing to the king the attributes of constancy and might;
Thoth, either pouring the water of life and dominion over the king, "
addressing him in set speech, with a roll in his left hand; Henmutei exliming him, sacrificing to him, and reaching him the sign of approval

, thus reminding us of the passage in Diodorus which tells us that
it was the duty of the priests to praise and warn the kings. The king
has instituted festivals in honour of Horus, and Horns in return throws
him the symbol of life. Isis, holding in her hand the lotus-stair, entwined
by the Urtus-serpent. also invests him with life, which here as elsewhere included life beyond the grave, which the Egyptians termed the
true life. On the S. wall of the second hall Heti is represented as seated
