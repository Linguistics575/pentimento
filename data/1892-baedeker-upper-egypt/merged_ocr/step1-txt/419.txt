C07 heb, before Ptah, before a ram's-headed deity (Mer nut-f,
loving his mother), lord of K Sit, and before Apt. Beneath are
three large warlike scenes. The tirst represents the king in his
chariot at the storm of a fortress. The horses with handsome harness
are galloping, while the king launches an arrow against the fortress
Above him is the guardian vulture, and behind him are his three
sons AmeMikhopeshf, Ramses, and Rahiuanemif, with their shieldbearers in chariots. The defenders of the well-drawn fortress are
pierced by arrows; one is falling from the walls. A herdsman takes
to flight with his herd.

Beside the king's horses are the words, referring to the king:'The
good god, son of Ammon, the advancing lord of the sword, protector of
his soldiers, shield of the lighters, bravely knowing the place of his hand,
firm in his war-chariot like the lord of Thebes, a lord of victory he slays
hundreds of thousands, one bull against numberless (foes), he sweeps
away the eontederates, he defeats the rebels on the summit of their
mountains, he penetrates into their valleys like the grasshoppers. Thou
eausest them to be cut "in their dwellings. Thou destroyest their seed
with the royal sickle'.

A second picture exhibits the king on foot, treading upon a
prostrate enemy, and piercing a Syrian with a lance so that his
blood gushes forth. The king is represented as a young man ot
vigorous frame, probably as at the beginning of his warlike career.

The inscription runs: "The good god who breaks in pieces the nine
tribes of the bow, who exterminates the lands of the N., a strong hero
against the nations, with a brave sword like Nentu. He leads
"the negroes to the N. land, the Amu to the land of Khent (Nubia). He
transplants the people of the Shasu to the land of.. "he places the land
of Tehen at the mountain-ridge. He fills with his victories the temples
that he has built with the booty which he wen when he overthrew the
land of Syria, and annihilated the land of Retennu, thrown down upon
its back'.

The third picture exhibits the triumphal return of the king
from battle. His chariot is preceded by two rows of fettered captives - black and brown people from the S. (Le. Nubians and th
d√©nese) - clad in skins and wearing caps of straw or reeds. The
king follows calmly in his chariot; his horse, named Nekhtu cm was
(Victorious in Thebes), paces proudly along; and beneath the horse
is the king's lion, which accompanied him in battle.

The inscription is as follows:'The living and good god, who mines
the rebellious, smites the land of the s., and annihilates the land of the
N. A brave king with his sword he drives far hack those who have
crossed his borders. His mAjest V umes 0 (distant) lands, he es many
in terror'. Farther on we read'He slays their chiefs, he causes the negroes of Wawa to say'he is like a llama in its uprising, he (spares) not
the Retennu'.

A large picture on the opposite (N. wall) deals with the warlike
events connected with the storming of the fortress of Kutesh, on the
Orontes (Aranuta), with which we have already become acquainted
in the Ramesseum (p. 161), and at Luxor, Karnak, and Abydos.

In the upper half of the picture the besieged fortress is depicted, with
the king, bending his bow, attacking it on the left. The Egyptian chariots
surround that of the king Beneath the fortress are the divisions of the
army of the Khela (Hittites) and their allies, of which one is stated at
