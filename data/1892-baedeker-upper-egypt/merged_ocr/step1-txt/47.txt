a. By Railway.

229 M. The railway-station, Btihi.k edu) akrfr, which is also the starting-point of the direct line to Téh e1-Biirt1d and Alexandria, is situated
on the W. bank of the Nile, 3 M. from Cairo (connection with main
railway-station in prospect). Carriage from the hotel to the station 4 ft;
for heavy luggage a second carriage is necessary, as the baggage-waggons
cannot be implicitly relied on. Passengers should be at the station early,
as the processes of ticket-taking and luggage-weighing are by no means
expeditious. The fhyst-ela8s carriages are, of course, the most comfortable
from a European point of view, and first-class passengers are allowed to
take with them in their compartment all their smaller articles of baggage
and even trunks. The natives almost invariably travel secuurelass, and
those who wish to make a nearer acquaintance with the country and the
people should, perhaps, select a seeond-elags compartment, in spite of its
ofl'ering less resistance to the incursion of the yellow desert sand (comp.
Baedeker's Lower Egypt, p. 371). - FARES to Assiti.r. Ist class 171.8 piastres
(Turkish), Shut class 114.5 pias., 3rd class 571/2 pias. Payment at the station
may be avoided by previously buying vouchers at the agencies of either
Cook or Gaze, and exchanging them at the railway-station through the
dragoman of the agency. The trains start (1891) at 8.30 ann., 3 p.m. (for
Wastah and intermediate stations), and 7 p.m. (Tues. d: Frid. only). Those
who wish to go on at once by steamboat from Assid.t should take the morning train on the preceding day (see Introduction, p. xvi; and comp. Cook's or
Gaze's Tourists' Programme). The journey to Assiitt takes nominally 10 hrs.,
but the trains are generally late. A time-table showing the names of stations
in French and Arabic and giving distances in English miles is published
by Penasson of Alexandria and may be bought at the ticket-oNces. Travellers should provide themselves with a supply of meat, bread, and wine,
as no stoppage is made for dinner; eggs, bread, water (glass necessary) are
offered for sale at the statioas. Seats should at first be taken on the right
side for the sake of the view of the Pyramids; from Minyeh onwards the
left side is preferable, for the views of the Nile valley and Benihasan. The railway follows the course of the Nile pretty closely, and a broffieient
idea of the views from the carriage-windows may be obtained from the
account of the dhahabtyeh voyage below. The following is a list of the railway-stations, nearly all of which are also steamer-stations, For descriptions, see the text. Stations: Gizeh,1frucamdiye2r; "M. (1/2 hr. from Cairo)

sometimes to be waited for for hours), the dhahabiyeh is cast off and
