I Medhtet Habu. THERES. M. Route. 181

The lower series of representations on the N. and E. walls are
less interesting. Several boats appear in them, and beneath them
(to the extreme left) the festal-loarge of Ammon. A dialogue between the king and the gall Amman, in which the building of the
temple is extolled, also occurs here.

Corresponding to the festival of Khan) on the N. and E. walls,
a Festival of Ptult-Sokar-Osiris is displayed in the upper tow of the
S. and S.E. side of the eolonmvle. It begins to the left of the door
with a train of priests of various forms, bearing standards and
arranged in two rows. Next appears the king, to whom incense is
offered, and above whom hovers a vulture. Then follow dignitaries,
succeeded by a colossal symbol of the god Nefer Tum, borne by
18 priests. The kherheh reads 16 formulae of invocation After
him come 16 exalted personages, including the king's sons holding
a cord which reaches to the hands of the king. Then follow 10
priests hearing the barge ofPtah-Sokar-osiris; and finally the king
before Khnum and Ptah-Sokar-Usiris.

More interesting than these festa ] representations are the Wurlike
Reliefs, in the lower division on on the S. and E. walls. The inscriptions relate the conquest of the Libyans and the annihilation of
the N. tribes of the Philistines and Zekkari, who had penetrated
into the Nile delta and were there ruptured by the king. One of
the reliefs on the exterior of the N. wall represents this occurrence.
The inscription contains 75 lines and covers a considerable part of
the S. wall. The lst Scene to the left of it depicts in four rows
the captured Libu, conducted by the king's sons and other notabilities. One counts and anothernotes upon aleafthenumher ofhands

shoots an arrow against the failing foe: "He sees defeat like a tlame
beneath them; he holds the how in his right hand and looses the
arrow with his left; he goes against them, knowinghis own strength.
Fare to face, he smites a hundred thousand. The hearts of the
Temhu, their life, their soul have ceased'. - 3rd Scene. The king
drives with his enemies in fetters. Beneath marches a row of his
soldiers, armed with spear, shield, and knife. - 4th Scene (next the
door in the E. wall). The king, standing, brings three rows of

the king's sons, with their names; on each side the same number
