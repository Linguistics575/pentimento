of Lek, he. of Causing or of the Emit, referring to the Nile-voyage
hither from the N. The Copts called it Pilak or Petals, and the
Arabs used to call it Bilak. Now-a-days none of these names are
known to the natives, who usually call the island Anus el-Woyod,
after the hero of one of the tales in the Thousand and One Nights,
which has undergone considerable change in the Egyptian version
