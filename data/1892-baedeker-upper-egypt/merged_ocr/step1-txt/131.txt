el-Inglis) and thence through the Wadi Ambagi to Knee: or Kosseir, on
the Arabian Gulf, the Leukos Limen (White Harbour) of the Ptolemies and
the Tua of the ancient Egyptians. About 4 M. to the N. the scanty remains
of Old Koy'r, corresponding to the harbour of Philotera, the ancient Aenmm, which was named thus in honour of the sister of Ptolemy Philadelphus. ighséi is now an unimportant town of about 3000 inhab., with
a quay, a wooden mole 400 ft. long, two mosques, and several bazaars.
The small houses are all whitewashed. The only ediliees of any size are
the government buildings erected by Mohammed'Ali opposite the mole,
the adjacent custom-house, and a large grain-magazine, also belonging to
the Egyptian government.

In going from Fos.ir towards the Nile the Beduins sometimes prefer
another and more southerly route than that through the Wiidi JJamitmitt.
This diverges from the route above described at the Bir elrlnglis in the
Wtidi Bc'dah (see above) and leads at first through the Winding ti't'tdilfatr
el-Ehdrfim, afterwards passing the Gebel Nulzds and through the pass of
mat eerhuztil into the dei Ghazcil. To the right rise the conical Gebel
Daghaatyeh and Gebcl Moshdghir. We next follow the midi Hoamtdah, which
farther on takes the name of midi el-troms' iron the fine Gabe! yaw,
which flanks it on the right. The night is spent at Mot'mn, a village with
water and a few huts of the Ubabdeh. At the Gebel de we cross the
Tarit e'dahrdtoi, a road running from N. to s, and farther on reach
Am rah, with another well and more rAhabdeh huts. Thence our route
lies through the midi Mir and the det' { rush to the air tt- (rnsh, a
dried-up well, beyond which we pass numerous quarries of green breccia.
Beyond the passes of Ittrst tyt-lihit (sandstone formation) and JtCat elmtmmh We reach the niobium (see p. 75) of Rats isyar, whence we go
on through the Wtidi Miymt to Jfobwalat 1mm eVUhir. Lastly we prueeed tia Gdhral f0alfah to La.kit.ah (p. 75), where our route unites with
the more northerly one already described.

Caravans on the way from hoses to Esneh take a route still farther
to the ti., via the well of Davfdiri. The N. route from Nukht'z tn igeiteh
is now seldom used.

The journey to Berenike, 0n the Arabian Gulf in 24° N. lam, and to
the emerald mines W' to the N. of it, is seldom undertaken. we in
start from Feneh or Koptos, diverging at Lahétah from the route to Fus.
or we may begin at a point opposite Edfu (Cuntm-Apeninopoii
It hesiyeh (p. 253). On both routes traces of old watering stations are
discernible. Both Pliny and the Itinerary of Antonine (3rd cent. A.D.)
give a list of the ancient stations, with their distance from each other
in Roman miles. The list in the Itinerary is as follows: Phoenicon 27,
Didyme 24, Afrodito 20, Kompasi 22, Jovis 33, Aristonis 25, Phalacro 25,
Apolluno 23, Kahalsi 27, Keenan Hydreuma 27, Berenike 18 - in all
271 Human miles = about 250 English miles.

direct to the emerald mines of the Widi Zabiirah (see below). We cross
the Wadi Higeiig. On the rocks to the right are rude representations of
giraffes, camels, and ibcxes. Remains of an ancient station named Summit,
with a cistern and aha hers, occur in the same Wridi, We next enter
the broad green ll Ji M wen: and steer for the Gebel Amgef, near which
