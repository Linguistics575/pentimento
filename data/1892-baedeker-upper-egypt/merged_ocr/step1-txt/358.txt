280 Route 28. FIRST CATARACT.

sixty years of age, who sat with his long neck craning forward so long
as we hovered in danger, and who, with his eyes sparkling with intense
excitement and his lean bird-like face, looked like an eagle on the look
out for prey. All went well at li1st. Only a man and boy, however,

As we quitted the second rapid and were entering a different channel
the sailors on the left side had to row with all their strength; that,
however, proved inadequate and the stream swept the boat round, so that
the stern was foremost. This was the culminating point of the passage.
The re'is without losing his presence of mind for an instant, guided the
helm with his foot, while he assisted the rowers with his arms, turned
the boat round once more, brought it into the right channel, and finally
into the less rapid part of the Nile, and so to Assuiin. The entire passage
lasted 42 minutes.

FROM MAHSDAH T0 PnnLe the crooked road skirts the bank of
the river. The village-children pursue the traveller, begging for
bakshish. When the path, covered with granite-dust, grows narrower
and begins to lead over smooth granite, the traveller should dismount. The curiously-shapedrocks1'11 the bed anion the bank ofthe
Nile bear numerous inscriptions. Some of them look as though they
had been built up out of artificially rounded blocks. These forms
seem to have struck the aneient Egyptians most forcibly, for in the
relief of the Source of the Nile at Phila (p. 294) - one of the few
representations of landscape in Eg pt - the river-god crouches
under a pile of blocks like these. In 25 min.we reach a small plain
and obtain a charming view of Phila, the most beautiful spot 011
the Nile, and the goal oftmvellers iwho Z110 not wish to go on to the
second cataract. The small plain above-mentioned, to the E. of the
island, is shaded with handsome sycamore trees, near which is at
longlow building ofa semi-European appearance, with battlemented
roof. This is the deserted station of the Roman Catholic missionaries,
who hence founded settlements in Central Africa, all of which, how
ever, including finally that at Khart.tim, have been

smooth water, presents, with its imposing temple,

graceful kiosque, and flourishing vegetation, a
beautiful contrast to the rugged, bare and precipi
tous rocks that bound it, especially on the N.and

W. To the N. a massive double rock, with the name

:3 of Psammetikh II. conspicuous upon it, towers

:7 above the rest; to the W. rises the rocky island of

:4: d Bigeh (p. 297), with numerous monuments and in
scriptions. The ferry-boat is to be found at the

village of Shellil. Between the railway-station of Shellal and the

Nile is a fine palm-grove, with the tents of the Egyptian troops

under British command. The handsome dhahahiyeh near the bank

is the residence of the commandant. Breakfast may be obtained on

board, but those who come by rail are recommended to bring their
provisions with them from Asstian.
