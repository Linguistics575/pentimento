the desert to the Convent: of SS. Anthony and Paul, a few leagues
from the Red Sea. The brotherhood of St. Anthony's Convent occu ies
the highest rank among the religious societies of the Monophysite Confession; and the Patriarch, or head of the Coptic, community, must be
selected from their number. A visit to the convents, however, does not
compensate for the fatigue and trouble it involves.

As far as Minyeh the space between the E. bank and the hills
remains narrow, the limestone rocks frequently abutting on the river
in unbroken walls or rounded bluffs. Few villages are seen on this
bank, but the fertile alluvial tract on the W. side, 10-12M. in width,
is thickly populated and carefully cultivated, exhibiting in profusion
all the remain that grow on the Nile, date-palms, and Sugar-oar".
The huge sugar plantations present a busy scene in November, when
the sweet juice is collected from the canes and conveyed to the
factories, which are a monopoly of the Khedive and follow each other
in rapid succession. These factories are connected by the railway,
and short braneh-Iines, used in harvest-time only, run from them
to the plantations lying farther to the W. Their lofty chimneys
impart a very modern-industrial appearance to the ancient land of
the Pharaohs. Large barges full of sugar-canes and others with
fellahin going to work in the factories are met on the river. Most
of the higher offieials in the factories are Europeans. The juice is
expressed from the cane and then refined by being boiled twice in
closed vessels. In an average year about 25,000 tons of sugar are
produced in Egy pt; in 1889 the value of the sugar exported
amounted to 509, () 001..

The boat passes two large islands. On the W. bank lieBalankah
and Blbeh (rail. stat., p. l), with large sugar-factories. The channel new contracts, and numerous islets are passed. Feshn (rail. tat.,
p. 1), on the W. bank, is Ir, M. from the river. Near the village
of el-Hibeh, on the E. bank, about 4 M. farther up, are the ruins of
the town of Kheb or Khebi, which belonged to the name of Aphrodite (p. 5). These include well-preserved riparian structures of the
time of the Pharaohs and some massive walls made of bricks,
bearing two different stamps. One of these bears the name of the
local goddess,'Isis of Kheb', and the prrenomen of Tutmes 111. (18th
Dym); the other, discovered by H. Brugsch in 1853, reads'The
high-priest of Ammon, Pishem the just, governor of the towns of
Urkhenu and 1sem-kheb'.

On the E. bank rises the Gebel Shékh Embérak. The steamer
stops at Maghéghah, a pleasant place on the W. bank, with aeacias,
palms, and large sugar-works (post and telegraph office at the rail.
stat., p. 1). The Nile-channel is very wide here (several islands);
farther on both banks are flat. At Abu Giryeh (rail. stat., p. I),
with sugar-factories, the railway runs close to the river.

About 12 M. to the E. of Abu Girgeh, on the Bajr Tami, in the name
of Sep, lies the town of Behnesah, on the site of the ancient Oxyrrhynchus

(Demons; profane name Pe-mmt, Coptic Danae, Greek Hehwq), now
represented only by a few desolate heaps of debris. The fish Oxyrrhyn
