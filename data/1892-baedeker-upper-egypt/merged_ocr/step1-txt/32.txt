A hanging-lamp, bought in the Muski for 120 fr., suspended over the
saloon-table, and a pack of playing-cards were found very convenient.

The above stores, purchased for 281., not only were amply sufiiI-ieut, but 70s. worth was returned to the dealers at the end of the
voyage. For no one should omit to make an arrangement entitling
him to return unused stores (at a reduction of about 100/0 on the
original price) and to have the agreement entered on the invoice.

Other stores, such as eggs, fresh beef, buffalo-meat, mutton,
poultry, oranges, lemons, etc., are taken only in small supplies, it
being easy to replenish the larder en route, either from the steamers
or still better from the markets on the banks, where prices are moderate. The cook makes the purchases and submits his accounts.

and thin storkings, flannel shirts, a broad-brimmed hat, a warm
overcoat, and a substantial rug should not be forgotten. A sunumbrella and kufiyeh, a silk handkerchief 01' muffler, blue or grey
spectacles, and a leathern cushion stuffed with horse-hair will also
be found useful. Saddles, which may be hired in Cairo, should be
taken, especially ladies are of the party, for the donkeys hired at
the various points do not always have saddles. - Explorers should
provide themselves with a long and strong ladder; as well as a
magnesium lamp or magnesium-wire (to be obtained in Cairo). Photographic apparatus should be brought from home, for chemicals
are either not obtainable or very dear in Egypt, and good dry plates
are scarcely to be obtained. The plate should not be more than 8 to
10 inches at the largest. The traveller should superintend the oustom-house examination in person.
