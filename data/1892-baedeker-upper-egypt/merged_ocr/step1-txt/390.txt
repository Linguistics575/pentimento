left on each side, united by means of a building between them,
which has a semi-portal on the W. side, farthest from the Nile.
The capitals of the side-columns resemble those of the front columns of the hypaethral temple on Phila. They are lotus calyx
capitals, framed at the top with leaves springing from buds, while
beneath are the usual five annuli or rings Only a single crossbeam now rests upon the beams running lengthwise in this little
temple, which cannot have been more than about 25 ft. square.

About 10 min. to the S. is a double girdle-wall of large hewn
stones, stretching to the Nile, and furnished with a gateway. A
flight of steps leads down to the river. The Pylon-like gateway
appears to have been faced by another of the same kind. The wall
has been taken for the remains of a Roman permanent camp. An
ancient road leads thence to the sm to some *Sandstone Quarries,
which contain about 60 Greek votive inscriptions (and one demotic)
dating from the Roman imperial epoch (Septimius Severus, Caracalla to Gordian). There are also two busts and a carefully constructed niche, with the winged sun-disc above it, apparently intended to hold a Statue The inscriptions have been carved mostly
by priests of the Games (tsvoc 765mm also cipylispeu;'r: p√©cmrng.

to mean the carriage of stones under priestly management from the
quarries for the pu'xpose of building temples.

At all events in the inscription to the left of the head of the bust
(in Lepsius 373) a priest of the (# 011109, named tlrSES. son of Psenfauax,
records that he had despatched 110 stones for the work of his of Philm,
i.e. probably for one of the later temples (perhaps the one next the stream
on the w. side). Considerable sums were paid for the privilege of holding
this probably lucrative office. Eight tablets (the four earlier beside the
left bust, the four later beside the right bust) record that a certain Gains
Dioscuros (Julius) Alumnus, who is prohahly represented by both the
busts, held this oftice eight times. for which first and Wh he expended

Among the deities worshipped here besides Isis, were a goddess
named Epcottqt; (Sruptichis) and a god named Iloupsetlwiwg
