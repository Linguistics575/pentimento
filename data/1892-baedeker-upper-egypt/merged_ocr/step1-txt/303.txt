straight on is a room about 25 ft. long. Here on July 5th 1881 Emil
Brugsch discovered the famous royal mummies, now in the Gizeh Museum.
Since January 1876 Ushahtis, tablets, and large funereal papyrus rolls, all
coming from this spot, had been sold to wealthy tourists through the
medium of Mustapha Aga, the English consular agent at Luxor. Attention
was aroused by the Papyrus of Notemit, a queen of the Qist Dyn. which
was produced in several pieces, one of which is now in the Louvre, another
in the British Museum, having been presented to the Prince of Wales, and
a third in the possession of a Belgian lady. Enquiries showed that there
were several brothers'Ahil er-1lastll who were especially concerned in the
sale of these antiquities. The arrest and trial of Ahmed, one of the
brothers, followed by flogging, led to no result. However partly from fear
of punishment, and partly for a promised reward the secret was betrayed
hy Ahmed's elder brother Mohammad, to the Mudir of Feneh, who gave
information to the Khedive. Brugseh describes the discovery as follows:

'Every inch of the subterranean passage was covered with homes and
antiquities of all kinds. My astonishment was so overpowering that I
scarcely knew whether I was awake or whether it was only a mocking
dream. Resting on a coffin, in order to recover from my intense excitement, 1 mechanically cast my eyes over the coffin-lid, and distinctly saw
the name of King Sen 1., the father of Ramses 11., both belonging to the
19th Dynasty. A few steps further on, in a simple wooden coffin, with
his hands crossed on bis breast, lay Ramses 11., the great Svsostris himself. The farther I advanced, the grea'er was the wealth displayed, here
Amenophis 1., there Amosis, the three Tutmes, Queen Ahmes nofertari,
Queen Aahhofep, all the mummies well preserved; in all 35 coflhss, belonging to kings and their wives or to princes and princesses.....

By the evening of July tith all the mummies and coffins had been
carefully packed at Luxor. Three days later the Museum steamer came
to carry the precious burdens to Ilttls. From Luxor to Koptos on both
sides of the Nile, the fe1ltiph1 women followed the boat with loosened
hair and uttering plaintive cries, while the men fired off guns, as at a
funeral. The coffins were taken to the museum at ntihih, and thence
removed to the new museum at Gizeh. - The discovery included King
Ilasekenen, of the 17th Dyn., the opponent of the Hyksos; of the 18th Dyn.
King Aahmes, queens Aahmes nofertari and Aahhotep, kings Amenhotep I.,
Tutmes A, 11.. and ffl,, prince simmen, princesses Sitamon and Meritamon, Nebseni a priest, and others; of the 19th Dyn. Ramses 1., F'eti I,
and Ramses fl. Ramses 111. of the 20th dyn. was also afterwards found.
or the priest-kings of the 21st Dyn. Pinosem, Nozemit, Ramaka with her
ilauehier, a second Pinozem, queen Hathorhont'aui, Masahirta a priest, two
princesses Ast-ern-kW; and Wesikhonstt, and others. There were also found
a large leather tent in red, green, yellow, and white for Axl-em-kheb, the
daughter of King Pinozem, hr) statuettes of Osiris, 12 to 15
ceremonial wigs, and 46 wooden chests together with inscriptions, bronze
stools, papyrus rolls, and the like. The inscriptions found on the older
mummy-chests, e.!?. that of Seti I. and on the wrappings, were of great
importance, recording that the mummies had been taken from their tnmt.s
by the priest-kings of the 21st Dyn. (Ilerhor, Sitamon, Pinozem, and Nasahirta the priest) and removed to that of a they named An keb or An
hapu, in which also lay Amenhotep I. In the Abbott Papyrus, which is a
judicial enquiry into the robbery of the tombs, the passage 120 ells long
in the tomb ottmenhtttep L, which was to the N. of the temple of Amenhotep, is mentioned. This corresponds to the passage in the Dtlr eI-bahri
pit. The eoIours of the garlands of flowers were marveJlously well
preserved. The plants have been named by Prof Sehweinfurth.

(tn June lst 1886 by the wish of the Khedive the unrolling of the
mummies, a somewhat bold proceeding, was taken in hand, beginning with
the grey-haired Ramses the Great, whose sharp features and curved nose
are remarkably striking. In the coffin of Nefertari the mummy of Ramses Ill. was strangely found. Then followed Seti I. with his mild features,
nast-hent-h with his Ionk amt hmhen skull. having perhaps fallen in
battle with the Kheta, Aahmes 1., and the priest-kings of Thebes. A mummy
