here. The northernmost tomb (No. 3 of Lepsius) shows us the king
and his family standing on a dais, below which foreign captives
are depicted. The royal pair receives rich tribute. Those bringing
the gifts are Egyptians. Ar, to whom the tomb belongs, is adorned
with necklaces on account of the abundance of his contributions
Numerous servants carry the sacks and bottles to the open cellardoor, in front of which, in a bending attitude, is a bailiff with a
staff. It is possible that the cellar belongs to AT, and that the gifts
are royal bounties to him. - The next grave to the S., on a projecting hill, was excavated in 1883. It was destined for Mahu, a
commander of the royal police, and scenes from his life (Arrest of
mountaineers. Escort of the king's equipage, etc.) are depicted on
the walls of the first chamber (esp. to the right of the entrance).
In the right side-wall is a door bearing a prayer in behalf of Mahu
to Aten-Ra (the radiating solar disc). - The next tomb, that of
the royal offieial Tutu, contains (to the right of the entrance) the
almOst complete text of a hymn, sung by a priest in praise of the
sun'.'The breath of the wind', says the hymn,'enters their nostrils,
and Thy gift it is that they have being. All flowers bloom and
grow in their beds, and they t1ourish at Thy uprising. Festal joy
arises at the sight of Thy countenance. All quadrupeds hurry along
on their feet, all the birds in their nests flutter their wings in joy'.
This tomb also possesses a'papyrus' column, of unusually careful
workmanship and elaborate ornamentation. The basis of the capital is encircled, among the leaves, by a Urcreusr-scrp0nt; and at
the upper end of the shaft, below the richly-adorned hand replacing the annuli, are singular decorations consisting of sacrificial
gifts, including many birds in groups of tive. - To the S., at a
little distance, lies the tomb designated by Lepsius as No. 1. This
also is dedicated to a high dignitary named Af, perhaps the same
as in Tomb 3. () n the entrance-wall to the right is represented a
festival, which some interpret as that of an order, while others take
it for the marriage of M, fan-bearer and commander of cavalry, to
the royal nurse. The king, denoted by the disc, his wife, and his
daughters stand on a this. The eourtiers, from tho charioteers to
the military officers and fan-bearers, receive with deep obeisances
the decorations which the Pharaoh, the queen, and the princesses
throw down to them. The foremost dignitary already wears six
necklaces, and the lady behind him is just adding a fifth to the
four she already possesses. A troop of dancers enlivens the proceedings by energetic leaps and contortions, and secretaries make
a note of the donations. To the S. are several other graves, including those of Apii and Ramses, the latter a general and chamberlain of Am√©nhotep 111. To the N.N.W. of these tombs lay the huge
residence of the singular king Khu-eu-aten, which was perhaps
destroyed by the same generation that obliterated his name from
the cartouches.
