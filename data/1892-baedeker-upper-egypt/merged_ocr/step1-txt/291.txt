In beauty of execution it far surpasses all the other tombs of Bibin
vl-Muli'ik, and the sculptures on its walls appear to have been
executed by the same artists whose works we had the opportunity
of admiring at Abydos. In size it resembles Nos. 11 and 14; its
length is 330 ft. The descent is made by a steep flight of steps,
in which it resembles only the tomb of AT.

f. On the left begins'The book ofthe praise of Ra in Amenthes',
which has been edited by Naville. It says:'When this book is read,
the figures of clay are upon the ground at the going down of the
sun, Le. the lordship of Ra over his enemies in Amenthes; who is
wise on earth is wise also after death'. This paragraph of the book is
followed by a picture divided into three compartments, in the
middle a scarabants with Khnum, below a crocodile with an antelope's head, above a serpent with an antelope's head reversed. The
first chapterbegins in the first corridor on the left, and runs straight on,
occupying only a part of the wall. In the second corridor on the left
begins the second chapter, while the upper part is covered with the
15 forms of Ra in long niches. The two sides of the second corridor
contain the 2nd, 3rd, and part of the 4th chapters. At the end some
passages were omitted, and the rest of the 4th chapter was placed
on the part of the right hand wall of the first corridor that was yet
unused. - ff. Here the proces: of the work may be followed, a part
