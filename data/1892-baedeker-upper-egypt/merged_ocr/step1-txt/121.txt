to the gods of the temple. Some of the resisting oxen are remarkably
true to nature. Probably the sacrificial animals were actually slain
in this court, a conclusion strengthened by the broken pottery found
here by Mariette and the two springs of turbid water. A well has
also been discovered outside the E. wall of the temple, which may
be the spring described by Straho.

The Room marked l? on the plan is the most interesting of the
other apartments in this wing. The entrance to it is on the left
(S.) side of the space between the sanctuary and the third row
of columns in the second hypostyle hall. The door leading to it is
named'the great door of lla-ma-men (ie. Seti), the favourite of
Sokar't To this deity, Osiris-Sokar or Ptah-Sour-Osiris, keeper of
the realm of shades, this room is consecrated, though other gods,
such as Nefer Turn, Horns, and Thoth are also represented here.
The king appears in the act of offering sacrifice. To the extreme
right on entering, on the wall between the doors, are reliefs of
richly adorned Kilometers, the symbols of the state of stability
and permanence aimed at by Pharaoh; the inscriptions inform
us that they were dedicated to the Osiris of the under-world, PtahSokar-Tatuuen, who was worshipped in the Meinnonium of Abydos.
On the entranee-wall, to the right of the door, is the bark of Sokar,
and a list is given of the titles of this god of the many aliases,
who was revered in so many different spots. The form of the three
columns preserved here is peculiar. The cylindrical shafts, which
bear the abacus without any transitional member, are flattened at
the points where their periphery would touch an exseribed square,
and hence their section is in the shape of an octagon with four
straight and four curved sides. - The doors to the right, on each
side of the above-mentioned Kilometers, lead into two oblong rooms
with Vaulted veiling, which have partly fallen in (P1. q, f). - The
other apartments of this wing contain nothing of special interest.
They are all ruinous, and five of them eannothe entered except from
the outside. - In visiting the Memnonimn of Abydos, the traveller
should bear in mind that he has to do with a Cenotaph, dedicated
to the manes of a king apothoosised as Osiris and to his forefathers;
and he should also remember that the site of the building was Jetermined by the belief that the souls of those who had been'sanetified' near the Holy Tomb vonhl look forward with confidence to the
highest joys of the world to come.

MONUMENTS TO THE NORTH. Not only Seti, lmt also his son has
erected a eenotaph to himself' near the tomb of Osiris. To reach
this Sepulchral Temple of Ramses II. we turn towards the N. and
skirt the margin of the desert for a few minutes. It is in a very
ruinous state, but still pma't-nts many features of interest. The
ground-plan of a peristyle x-nurt, several rooms, and the sanctuaries
beyond them can still he (raved: but the average height of the ly" maining walls is only 5.1m. Tlw mmm- ofruin preitlutmi to us
