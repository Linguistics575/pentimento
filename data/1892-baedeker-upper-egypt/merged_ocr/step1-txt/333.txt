long-handled flahellum. The Kherheh precedes the litter, offering incense,
and a train of captured Ethiopians is led along hy the victor. Vanquished
blacks are lying on the ground and others are being rapidly marched "
by Egyptian soldiers. Above the captives are the words:'Leading of the
captives of the miserable Kush by Horus, king of Upper and Lower
Egypt, etc. His majesty came out of the land of Kush (Ethiopia) with
the booty which his sword had made, as his father Amman had commanded him'. Before the priests, who stand in a reverential attitude, is
written:'The good god approaches, he celebrates his victory over the great
