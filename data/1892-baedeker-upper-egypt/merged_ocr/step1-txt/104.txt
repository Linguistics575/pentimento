better class. It was probably founded by Soter I. and in the time
of the Pharaohs it was called Kathi and Pasebck (Crocodilopolis),
afterwards Pse-ptulmuios; under the Ptolemies it was known as
Ptolcmu -Hermiu Pusui (dwelling of the crocodile). The officials
of Abydos also resided here. The mounds and river-walls at Menshiyeh (no inscriptions) are certainly extensive, but still it is difticult, when face to face with them, to credit the statement of the
usually trustworthy Strabo:'farther on is the town of Ptolemais,
the largest in the Thebaid and not inferior in size to Memphis. Its
constitution is drawn up in the Hellenic manner'. The Ptolemaic
kings who died here received the same honours as the manes of the
Pharaohs at Abydos. According to Leo Africanus Menshiyeh was
the seat of an African prince named Hawaiian Numerous antiquities
have been found here lately.

Before we reach Girgeh the mountains on the Arabian bank
approach close to the stream. At several points are roelc-tomhs,
either wholly destitute of inscriptions or with none but obliterated
specimens.

12ti'2 M. Girgeh, on the W. bank, is a steamboat-station, with
post and telegraph offices; the tourist-steamers stop for the night
here.

Girgeh, which is 336 M. from Bf1lil.; and 935 M. from Assuttn, has
been from time immemorial the station where the Kile-bmttmcn halt to
bake a new supply of bread. As, however, this operation lakes N hrs.
(a supply for several weeks being necessary), and as Girgeh is not a convenient place for so long a stoppage, the traveller is advised to make a
contract. in Cairo before starting to the alien that the halt for baking be
made at Assiiiy m- iieneh and not in Girgeh. No re'is will give up this
privilege, unless he has been previously bound down to dn so in writing.
The customs of the Nile boatmen are almost as unchangeable as those of
the desert Arabs. The only suitable way in which to fill up a halt of 2k hrs.
at m geh would be to make an excursion to the temple nf Abydos, but
this is much more conveniently reached from Ttelitmish tp. 53). A day
can he very pvoiltably spent at either Assit1.t or Keneh, in the latter case by
a visit to the noble temple of Denderah (emup. the Contract at p.).

Girgeh, which contains 14,900 inhah., preceded Assmt as the
capital of Upper Egypt, but is now merely the chief place in the
province of Girgeh, while the seat of the Mudiriyeh is at Sohig
(p. 48). It becomes more probable every day that Girgeh occupies
the site of the ancient This (hieroglyph. Tent), in which the god
Anhur (Greek Onouris) was specially worshipped (pomp. p. 53).
Some ancient tombs of the 6th Dynasty exist here, including one
of the time of Merenptah; and a little to the N are some other
graves of the ancient kingdom. Many of the present inhabitants
are Copts. Outside the town lies a Roman Catholic convent, which
is probably the oldest but one in Egypt; the abbot is a member of
the Fraternity of the Holy Sepulchre. The name of the town is
Christian, being that of St. George or Girges, the patron-saint of
the Coptic Christians, a representation of whom, in his combat with

the dragon, is present in almost awry Coptic churchi Sh George
