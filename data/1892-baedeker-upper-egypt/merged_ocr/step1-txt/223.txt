became known that the N. eolossus emitted a musical nnle at sunrise, a
new and beautiful myth arose among the Greeks who were always ready
to invent a legend in order to explain a fact. The hero of this myth was
a Memnnn, hailing from Ethiopia, who fell at Troy. Appearing as a stone
image at Thebes, he greeted his mother Ens with a sweet and plaintive
note when she appeared at dawn. The goddess heard the sound, and the
morning dews are the tears which she shed upon her beloved child.

The enormous size of the cuiessi and the, legends that clustered round
them, rendered them so attractive to the Greeks and Romans, that Tacitus
mentions them among the chief marvels (praec-ipua miracula) of Egypt;
and under the Roman empire travellers to the Nile considered that the
abject of their journey was attained when they had seen the pyramids
and heard the musical note of Memnnn.

The Northern Colossus is the famous Vocal Statue of Memnon.
This is distinctly indicated by the effusions of early tourists,
varying both in length and excellence, which are inscribed on the
legs. The statue is composed of two parts. The lower and older
part consists of a single block of sandstone-conglomerate, and
reaches to the middle of the arm resting on the knee and, behind,
to above the girdle. The upper part was broken off by an earthquake in the year 2? BAh, and was not restored until the reign of
Septimius Severus, many years later. The restoration was not very
happily managed, for instead of being made out of a single block,
the body and head were built up of thirteen blocks of common
sandstone in five courses. The care with which the lower part (now
much injured) was executed offers a great contrast to the crudeness
of this newer part. To the right and left and between the legs stand
female statues leaning against the throne, representing the mother
and wife of Amenhotep 111., Mai em ac: and Tit. On each side of
the seat two Nile-gods were represented in sunk relief, holding
papyrus plants wound round the symbol of the union of Upper and



Lower Egypt g The inscriptions on the S. colossus enable us to

supply what is here broken off; but these, and the hieroglyphics on
the hack of the statue, contain nothing beyond the high-sounding
titles of Amenhotep III. and the information that he erected these
palatial building: and colossal statues of sandstone in honour of
his father Ammon. The king, whom we have elsewhere found itleritionerl as a great warrior-prince, is also named a destroyer of foreign peoples, a Horus (who conquered the enemies of his father),
and the beloved of Ammon.

After the breaking of the colossus by the earthquake of" 27 BA).,
attention began to be directed to the musical phenomenon connected
with it. Strabo says:'Of two gigantic monolithic statues situated
close to each other, one is entire, while the upper portions of the
other, from the waist upwards, are said to have been thrown down
by an earthquake. It is popularly believed that a sound, as though
caused by a gentle blow, is heard once a day proceeding from the
remaining portion on the throne and pedestal. I myself, when I
was on the spot alnngwith Anlius Galius and numerous other friends
