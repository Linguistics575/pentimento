SITUATION AND HISTORY oF THE Fiufm. In the great plateau of the
Libyan Desert, which rises 300400 ft. above the sea-level, is situated the
province of the Fasibst (from the ancient Egyptian'Phiom', Le. marsh Or
lake district), the first of the oases (p. 313), which is usually considered
to belong to the valley of the Nile, and is justly celebrated for its extraordinary fertility (p. 36). This tract is in the form of an oval basin.
tao sq. M. in area, and supports a population of 200,000 souls; it is enclosed
by the Libyan hills. which are here of moderate height, and lies about
three-fifths of a degree to the S. of Cairo. It enjoys a remarkably fine
climate, and has but rarely been visited by the plague. This Hand of
roses' is still one of the most beautiful parts of Egypt. and more than
any other part of the Nile valley deserves the well known epithet of'the
u', bestowed on Egypt by Heroilotns, as it is entirely indebted
for its fertility to the waters ofthe Nile with which it is artificially irrigated.
The Batu" Ytuuf (p. W). a channel 207 DI. in length, which is more probably
a natural branch of the river, artificially adapted, than a. canal, diverges
from the Nile to the N. of Assiitt, and flows through a narrow opening in
the Libyan chain into the Fayilm, where it divides into numerous
ramifications, abundantly watering the whole district. One ofits branches
runs towards the N., skirting the E. slopes ofthe Libyan hills. At the point
where the Ram Yu; f enters the Fayiim, the district forms a plateau of
moderate height, descending towards the w. in three gradations towards
the Birket el-Furihy a long, narrow lake, extending from s.w. to N.E.
On the easternmost and highest part of the oasis the Labyrinth and
Lake Mums (pp. 39, 40) were once situated; the central part yields the
luxuriant crops for which the province is famous; while the westernmost part chiefly consists of sterile desert land. To the W. and N. of the
Birkct el-Furiin rise precipitous limestone hills, beyond which lies the
immense sandy desert of Sahara. The Fayiim must have been reclaimed
from the desert at a very early period. probably during the early empire,
in the reign of Atuenemhh HL. as monuments of his period indicate
that he was perhaps the first of the Pharaohs who sought to regulate
the whole course of the Nile. On the Upper Nile Prof. Lepsius has
found Kilometers constructed by that monarch. and in the Fay1Ln, on
the site of the Labyrinth. anumher of blocks of stone inscribed with his
name. The Greeks called him Amerie, "Moeris, and believed that the lake
known to them as "Lake mens', which they regarded as a marvel of
engineering skill, was named after him. The word meri. however, is
the Egyptian for lake or overflow, so that the great basin of the Fayiim
was simply'the lake", and it was from his exertions in connection with
the irrigation works that Amenemha obtained the namc nf Nreris. We
learn from several inscriptions. and from a papyrus roll treating of the
Fayfun, that the province was known in the time of the Pharaohs as Ta
shet, m' the lake-land, and that Lake Naeris was called hun-t, signifying
the discharge or posterior lake. On its bank rose the celebrated Labyrinth, which was probably renewed by the Bubastite monarchs of the
22nd Dynasty. About the same period the town of Crncodilopulis, situated on Lake Mreris, and afterwards called Arsinne after the wife of Piolemy Philadelphus. was so extended and embellished by mom )" i. that
it is called the'city of Osorkon L' in the inscription on the celebrated
