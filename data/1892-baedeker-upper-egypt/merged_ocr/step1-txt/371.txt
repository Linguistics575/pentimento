lemy VII. Philometor, and most of its decorations were due to Ptolemy IN. Euergetes 11., though the later Lagidae and Tiberius also
contributed a share.

The vestibule here is loftier than the other rooms of the cella. The
entrance was adorned by Philometor, but the numerous interior reliefs
represent Tiberius before the ditlbrent deities of the temple. The carefully
elaborated doorway at the back of the pronaos dates from Euergetes II.
The first room is quite unadorned. Above the door to the second room
is a window, bordered on each side by two Hathor-masks. Tiberius is
named several times on the walls, which have been partly plastered over
with mud. The early Christians, who perhaps used the second room for
purposes connected with their services, have entirely plastered over the
heathen Inscriptions there; while the highly interesting Representations in
the third room have been left quite untouched. From these we learn that
the temple was intended to represent the Birth-House or Jleshen, in
which the infant Horus first saw the light (similar buildings at Denderah,
Edfu, etc., pp. 80, 253). The reliefs on the rear wall are in two sections.
The lower series represents the Birth of Horus, who is introduced into
life hy Amman. Thoth, and other gods, In the upper row we see Horns
ascending from a huge bunch of lotus-tlowers, and beside him the serpent
coiling round a column adorned with lotus-flowers, beneath which kneel
two forms, covered with the I'rzeus-hood. The allegorical meaning of
this latter composition is obscure. On the W. wall of the chamber is
a Goddess (head destroyed), offering the breact to the new-born child, and
close by is Hathor. the good fairy of Egyptian nurseries, placing her
left hand in benediction on the head of Horus, and holding his arm
with her right. King Ptolemy IX. Euergetes II. is depicted handing
to her two metal-mirrors'to rejoice the golden one with the sight of her
beautiful form'. - These representations do not only celebrate the mystic
birth of the god, they refer also to the most beautiful and most responsible
duties of motherhood, which Isis, Hathor, and Nephthys undertake. Their
nursling appears indeed to he the infant Horus, but it is evident from
many allusions, that the young Pharaoh, the heir to the throne of Ra,
was considered as the incarnation in human form of the young god, and
that these representations were meant to convey to the Ptolemies that a deity
had borne and suckled them or their first-born, and that the immortals
had guided their upbringing with invisible hands. Cleopatra L, the mother
of the two brothers who caused the mating of this inscription, had acted
as guardian and regent especially during the childhood of Philometor, the
elder. She was the lsis of the young Horus. On the E. outside wall of
the cella a relief shows us Horus learning from the goddess of the N.
to play on the nine-stringed Jute, while Isis superintends the lesson. The
shape of the instrument is Greek and by the goddess of the north is
perhaps meant Hellenic music, which was cultivated even by the earlier
Lagidae.

a All the Inscriptions here date from Tiberius, who is named'Autokrator
Risres' on the E. side and'Tiberius' on me W. side. A double votiveinscription of the same date proves that the former phrase applies to
Tiberius.

The columns of the Colonnades on the W. and N. sides of the
cella exhibit genuine Ptolemaio capitals with a very high abacus.
On the N. side (Pl. f) is the peculiar but elegant capital, found
only on Phila:, consisting of a bunch of papyrus-buds, supporting
the abacus on their tips. Screen-walls, more than half as high as
the shafts, connect the columns. The most conspicuous columns are
the seven on the side of the temple next the court. These have
tinely sculptured Ptolemaic capitals, surmounted by a cubical a
one with 1Iathor-ruasks and chapels. The Architrave above, ador
