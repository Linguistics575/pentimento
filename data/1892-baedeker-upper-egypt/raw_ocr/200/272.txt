Passingthrough the middle door(Pl.h) of the Colonnade, we enter
a Mud of Hypostyle with G papyrus-bud columns (Pl, B). This is
bounded on each side by three chambers, and beyond the last pair
of these expands to their full depth. It is considerably smaller than
other similar halls: measuring only 50 ft. by 35 ft. A part of the
roof has fallen in, on the slabs which are preserved are the Vul-
tuxe forms of Hehent CNekheb'?) and two inscriptions. On the right
is the ordinary dedication of the building, on tho left a special
mention of this hall, which like all similar ones is Called 'The Hall
of Appetvwnee'. Everywhere we see on the walls Seti I. offering
incense to the gods of Thebcs, and bringing the symbol of his
name, and flowers etc. On the right and left of the door Seti l,
meets us as a boy, with Math on the one side, and Hather en the
other giving him the mother's breast. The young prince already

with thehornsofe cow and the disc upon her bead, supports with her
right hand the nourishing breast, and says: 'I am thy mother, who
fashions everything that is perfect. Feed thyself with my milk'.
Besides the Theban triad are mentioned Rather as goddess of the
western horizon, Isis, Tum, Ptah, and Anubis. The-Friae of the
Hall of Appearance displays the name and surname of Seti I. cen-
stantly repeated. Several inscriptions show that Seti left this hall
unfinished, and that Ramses completed what his father had begun.
In the adjoining rooms there are several clear references to the
cultus of the dead which was celebrated here. In hall 0, which is
supported by 4 pillars, we see Seti I. before a Naos with the boat
of Ammon-Ra.

The series of chambers to the left divides into two parts: a
Hall (PL F) with 2 pillars, into which three long rooms open, while
behind are three running parallel with the axis of the temple, and
three in a N. and S. direction, which are reached by a passage from
the extreme left ofthe inner wall of the eolonnade. This part of
the building was dedicated to the memory of father, son, and grand-
father, Seti L, Ramses IL, and Ramses L For the inscriptions to
the last see above.
