The lower parts, especially in the sanctuary-chambers, are covered
with rubbish. A long List of Offerings on the left (E.) exterior
wall is of some interest. It records that Pomses IH., in the month
Payni in the 16th year of his reign, decreed that gifts for his father
Ammon-Ra, the king of the gods, should be laid upon the silver
altar, such as provisions, saerHieial cakes, etc. Then follow some
details (injured) as to the amount of the offerings.

3. The Portique des Buhastites (Portiro nflhe Bulmstilcs; Pl. a),
so called by Cl1ampollion, is the part of the court between the left
(rr) wall of the temple just described and the s. put [i.e. the far-
thest to the right) ofthe second pylon, This spare, only 23 ft. wide,
had a door admitting to the temple from the s., and is to be regarded
as the E. end ot' the colonnadewhich lined the s. wall of the court.
Two unsculptured papyrus-bud columns divide it from the test
of the court. Numerous inscriptions dating from the 22nd Dym,
which originated in Bnhastis, cover the walls, and contain iitlpor-
tant material for the history of that period. This dynasty succeeded
the inglorious line of priest-kings, who seized the throne of Thebes
after the self-indulgent rulers of the 20th dynasty. Their name:
are rather Semitic than Egyptian, a circumstance that need cause
no surprise when we remember that Iluhastis is named as their
home, a city in theE. part of the Delta which Was settled by Semitic
tribes, As their names appear to he of Aramaic origin it is not
impossible that they were placed upon the throne of the Pharaohs
by the Assyrian conquerors who are mentioned in the cuneiform
inscriptions of Mesopotamia, though the Egyptian hieroglyphics
ignore them. Like their predecessors of the 21st Wus., they retained
the chief priesthood in their own control, apparently by committing
this ofilee to their heirs. In the hall in which we now are the
king appears several times with the crown-prince, who ls named
'tirst prophet of Ammon-Ra'; and the "own-prince occurs also
without his father. Shcsheuk J. probably began the decoration of
the building, for his name appears in the usual place for the tie-
dieatiou-inseription, i.e. on the arehitrave above the columns. The
names of Osorhon J. and Takeltit I. also occun The last-named
king appears before Ammon-Ita accompanied by his son Osorkou,
I-latt in the priestly panther-skin; and Osorhon also occurs alorus
offering saeritiee to Amman. 0n the Fa. wall is a double painting
representing Ammon to the right and left, wearing the feather-
nrown anti seated on a throne, while the decersed son of the same
Usorkon approaches in priestly garb to offer sacrifice. Beneath is a
long but unfortunately damaged Inscription, dating from the Nth
year of Tahelut IL, which mentions at remarkable event said to
have occurred in the reign of the father of that prince (probably
Shesheuk IL). The passage in question is not atrsolutely clear.
but this much may be gathered with certainty, viz, that on the ?Tith
