292 Route 29. PHIL/E. Temple

the first pylon. An inner staircase aseeuds to the w. pylon. whence
we proceed across the ruined roof to the E. yylon. To reach the
top of the W. pylon, we ascend the staircase to the Osiris-rooms
(p. 295), and then proceed leaving these on the right. The ascent
of the first pylon (p. 288) is, however, preferable in every vespeet.
0n the front of the E. wing facing the peristyle court is a semi-
circular Stele of reddish brown granite, ereoted to commemorate a
lavish grant of lands, by which Ptolemy VII, Philometor (94 B.O.]
enriched the temple. It was inscribed on the polished reer-well of
a monolithic chapel built into the pylon. The king, however, seems
merely to have granted to the priests a new lease of the ancient
property of the goddess. On the pylon are some Colosml Figures.
To the right is King Neos Dionysus holding his enemies by the hair,
before Horsiisi and Hathor; beneath, smaller representations. To
the left the king appears before Osiris and Isis. The grooves for
the flag-stairs should also he noted. The Portal (P1. p) to the temple
proper, approached by a shallow i1ight of steps, was built by 1her-
getes II. in imitation of the portal of Nectanebus in the first pylon.
Within it the predecessors of the builder are recounted.

The Temple of Isis proper, entered by this portal, was huilt
according to an independent plan, embracing a hypostyle, a pro-
mo; with various divisions, and a sanctuary, with two side-rooms.

Ptolemy n. Philadelphus Was the founder of this temple, to whose
decoration the hostile hruthere Philometar and Euergetes IL (Physkon)
contributed must largely. It was only natural that both the weak hut
amiable Philumetor and. the vicious hut energetic Physkon should interest
themselves in the sanctuary of Isis, fm- hoth were much interested in
retaining Nubia. We Are aware that the former maintained a military
station to the S. of Philee, which afterwards grew into the town nf
Parembaze (p.305). Later Ptolemiee are also named here. We refrain
from a closer examination of the reliefs and inscriptions in this temple,
though they are not uninteresting from a mythological point of view, cun-
tenting ourselves with a reference to the detailed descriptions of the
Ptalemaic temples at Denderah (p. 30) end Edfu (p. m).

h. The Hypostyle (P1. N) contains ten columns arranged in
three rows. The second and third rows contain each two columns
to the right and two to the left; while the first row has only the two
borner-cNumns, the space between them being left uncovered for
the sake of light. The hall thus consists properly speaking of two
portions: an uncovered fore-court with two doors, on the right and
left, leading to the outside of the temple, and e oovered part behind.
The Columns are 241'? tr. high and 133/4 ft. in circumference. The
uncovered portion could be shaded from the sun by means of a
velarium; the holes for the cords are still visible in the upper part
of the concave cornice turned towards the second pylon. The Colour-
ing of this hall, which has been preserved on the ceiling and the
columns, must have been very brilliant. The Capitals are the most
instructive of all the specimens that have come down to us of the
manner in which the Egyptians coloured their columns.
