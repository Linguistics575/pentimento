with axes, olive-branches, etc. Lying on the ground is a peculiar
capital, such as may be seen also in other parts otthe temple, con-
sisting of a cube, with the [Hark of the goddess Hathor carved on
the front and back. The upright broken shafts should also be
noticed; one half was treated as a pillar, the other as a polygonal
column with 7 sides, and.an inscription was placed on the surface
of the pillar.

The *Third Terrace (Narietie's Tcrmasc da Centre) deserves
especial notice Underneath there were on each side, left and right,
two rows of 11 square pillars which together formed two halls, te ft.
long, open to the east. of these the pillars of the left hall still
stand, only two remaining in that on the right. These halls sup-
ported a roof, of which all that remains is a fragment of the areui-
trave and a broad slab on the Il pillars in the back row. The
scenes represented on the inner wall and on the left side are of
great interest.

Disregarding for the present thepart otthe temple to the 1eitCSTpeos
of Ilathor, p. '227) we begin with the right side of the inner wall
below the third termee. The first scenes are somewhat damaged,
but those which follow are in a good state orpxeservation, and refer

"hieily t0 the expedition on which Queen Hatasa-Itanlaka sent her

kinz, with the double crown on her head, and the stair in her hand,
before Ammon-lla. There is a long but obliterated inscription.
2. The queen with two bowls full of grains ofineense, and with
the helmet on her head, before the sacred boat ofAmmon-lla. The
boat with a raus's head at earh end is carried by priests, of whom
the two in the centre are high-priests, Clad in leopard-skins. Next
we see 7 Aeha-trees in tubs, proublyineensitearing trees imported
to Egypt from the East; men with tubs are piling up the incense
in heaps. Above are the weighing and measuring ofpriwious metals,
as may be seen elsewhere. The weights used for weighing the gold
rings are in the form ot‘oxen lying down. The goddess éat‘ekh marks
the result on a tablet. Next are 3 Neha-trees. Below is seen a group
of S cattle, two eating the reerl-grass on the river-side, The scene
reminds us vividly of Pl1aroais dream (Gen. XLT. 1). 'And it came
to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and,
behold, he stood by the river. And, beheld, there came up out of
the river seven 1vell-favoured hint) and fat-fleshed; and they fed in
the reevl-grass'. Near this axe sacks with cosmetics (mextam). Again
we Ilud the king with the insignia of power. Then 2 rows of ships
belonging to the fleet whieh llamalta-lratasu sent to Arabia. The
shape of the vessels, their rigging, oats, and rudders should he
noticed, as well as the cargo which can be seen on board, and the
loading by means of a small boat. The necessary explanations
are given by small inscriptions above the pictures. To the left,
