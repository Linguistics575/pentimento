Between Nahadeh and Luxur (E. bank) the Nile makes n bend,
beginning at ed-pen_W. hank), after which we eontinrm in 11
S.W. direiwtiou.-- KumtUeh, a mail steamer station on the W. bauk,
formerly possesscd extenshe plantations of sr1gar-L'aile. la 1894 it
was the residence of 511131111 Ahmed, and of 'Ali Késhef Abu-Tar-
biisls, who bravely defended it " 11st the insurgents. - 011 the
E. bank, ahont 3/1IL from the NYClr, lies the temple of MuMrmit.
The ruins are not without interest, but it is better to visit them
later from Luxor(p.151) iftime permit, than to interrupt the jour-
ney so near Thebes.

On the left bank, as we draw near Thebes, rise high limestone
hills, presenting precipitous sides to the river, from which,however,
they are seperated by a strip of fertile land. The right bank is flatter,
arid the Arabian 1111111 retreat farther into the distance. Before
rem'hing the point when) the W. rhaiu projects l long curved mass
" cork towards the river, we see to the left tirst the great obelisk,
and the pylons of the temple of Karnak, half-eoucealed by palm-
trees. When we clear the abrupt prohle of the W. diffs and new
formations are vi ible at its foot, we may catch a distant view of
Luxor towards the S.E. None of the buildings on the W. bank are
v ible until the steamerhas ascended as high as Karnak; then first the
Colosd 0fMemuo1I anil afterwards the Ramessenm come into view.
The tekgraph-posts andwires, which here obtmde themselves upon
the view, seem strangely out of place beside the majestic relies of
Egypt's golden period. As we gradually approach Luxor, we distin-
guish the ilags tlying above the white houses on the 111111; and fromthe
consular dwellings, and the re'ts applies himself to find a suitable
anchorage beside the other Jl1ahabtyWs, Which are always to be
found here. Those who desire to keep by themselves may 11rst halt
off Luxor, lay in provisions and other 'reeessaries, Visit Karnak, and
then land on the W. bank. In this case the 1e’is wil1probirbly raise
objections, and the sailors (for whom a sheep should be bought, :15
they have tasted no meat ion the voyage) prove mutiuous, so that
watchmen will be necessary
