Ptoiemaie columns, with llatluyr-masks on the abacus. To the right
and left of this wide hall are two rooms, and behind are three
others, the middle one of which gives access to the Sanctuary. The
inscriptions on the walls owe their origin to the Ptolemies; the
earli st, as the deilitration-inseription also informs us, to Ptolemy IN.
Euergetes IL, and to Cleopatra, his sister and wife. The pregnant
hipyopotsrnus-goddess Apet was the goddess of births. Her finely
executed statue of serpentine, found in the ruins ofthe ancient
city, is nowiu the museum at Gizeh. It dates from the 25th Dy-
nasty. The inscriptions and representations refer largely to Osiris,
whose birth was commemorated here, and to the gods associated
with him. On the outside of the temple-wall and 011 the walls ad-
Joining it are found the names of Ptolemy Auletes and the emperor
Augustus. A list of Homes, also found here, is unfortunately much
damaged.
