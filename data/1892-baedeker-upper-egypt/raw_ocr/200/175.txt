including some of the Ptolemies placed inscriptions “ith their
names on the ancient. buildings. 1'he PRINCIPAL PYLDN is easily
revognized by the ohelisks and colossi at its portal. The visitor who
places himself in front of this perceives at once that rubbish and
earth conceal one-haltof the sloping fatade which is richly adorned
uith carvings and inscriptions now sadly damaged. Like all pylons,
the one before us consists of two truncated pyramids with an Bu-
trance-door between them. The latter was 55 ft. in height. The side-
towers, which rose about. 20 ft. higher, Were crowned with an ele-
gant concave cornice, which has now almost completely disappeared,
and were framed with the astragal, The entrance-door is Cor11-
pletely ruined. Undryr the cornice is a compicuous Inscription in
large letters, Which may be traced also on the arehitrave of the
peristyle court, wherever it has remained visible and entire. This
inscription contains a dedication, intimating that Ramses H. built
this imposing ediftee for his father Ammon-Ra, the king of the
Gods. (in each side of the entrance Were two monolithic Oolosei,
M) ft. in height; the most easterly has disappeared, the three
others are half-buried in ruhbish. In front of the central figures,
though not quite syuunetrieally placed, rose two Obelisks of pink
granite, DnL' of Which (the W.) now adorns the Place de la Con,
corde at Pa It is to be hoped that aorack, which has been
noticed in the monument from the days of antiquity, will not. lead
to its rlestruction under the iuiiuence of a northern climate. This
w. obelisk was smaller than its E. neighbour which is still stand-
ing: and the ancient architects eudeavoured to counteract this in-
equality hy giving the smaller obelisk a higher lr, 'e than the other,
and placing it a little farther forward. The inscriptions on the
obelisk still standing at Luxor are clearly and fmely out in the stone
and are perfectly legible. They name Ramses the Pharaoh, with
many pretentious titles, as the founder of this gorgeous building
erected in honour of Ammon in southern Thebes (Apt res). The
faces of these ohelisks, like those of most. others, are slightly con-
rex, as the priestly architcrts observed that a ilat shrfave was apt to
appear concave in a strong light. Details supplied by the French
engineers gixe a vivill idea of the enormous weight that hzul to he
handled in the erection of an obelisk, although the Paris uh ; is
comparatively small; considerably larger obeli. s are to be seen at
liarunk. The w. obelisk ot' Luxnt is 75 ft. high, its hase is 7V2 ft.
square, audits weight is ulmanls of r212 tuns,

The exterior walls of the pylons of nearly every Egyptian temple
are adorned with representations referring to victories granted by
the gods of the sanctuaries tn the rnynl lulihlcrs. At Luxor these
representations refer to victories granted by Ammon to Ramses H.
