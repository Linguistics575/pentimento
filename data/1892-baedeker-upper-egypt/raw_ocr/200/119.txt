of the king, the symbol of the 'panegyrio tent' , and a number

of stars. A dedicatory inscription, dividing the ceiling into two
parts, records that 'this 1femnonium was erected in the temple of
Abydos to his forefathers and all the cycles of gods of heaven and
earth, by the king, lord of the diadems, who is born again, who

He erected to them these, venerated sanctuaries outside the Necro-
polis, building them of stone and inlaying them with gold, in

still bears the lock of youth, hanging oi'cr his temples. In his
raised hands he bears written rel The adjoining inscription reads:
' tocitation of songs of praise by Prince Ramses, son and firstborn of
tho, king who loves him'. Above the shields is another inscription,
whieh describes the king's offering as made to Ptah-Sokar-Osiris,
the lord of the sarcophagus in the Memnonium of Abydos and (mill
khet) the royal forefather of Seti. He enumerates his gifts: 1000
loaves of bread, 1000 barrels of beer, 1000 cattle, 1000 geese,
1000 ineorrse-offerings, 1000 oil-offerings, 1000 pieces of cloth,
1000 garments, 1000 barrels of wine, 1000 holy offerings. The
ilgure 1000 here, which occurs in almost all saerititsial lists and also
in other formula, is not, of course, to be taken literally but simply
as equivalent to many. The king, as we see, brings his ymithfnl
son into the hall dedicated to his ancestors, where the earlier rulers
of Egypt, under the symbol of their name, dwell beside the tomb
of Osiris. He teaches the boy to offer rich gifts, such as hereafter
he would wish offered to his own mani‘s. It is beyond damn that
Seti was still living when this inscription Was set up, and yet
he already adds his own name to those of his predecessors; it
occupies the whole of the lowest row (the thin] from the top) of the
royal tatrle, being repeated 19 times with prefix and aitix. The.
living Seti provides for the future Osiris and for his worship at thi-
holy grave. - In the first Volume of this Handbook (p. 85) it has
