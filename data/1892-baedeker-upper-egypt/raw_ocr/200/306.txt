232 Route 22. ESNEH. From Thebes

either near the former Mudiriyeh (now removed to Keneh), beside
which are some ancient riparian constructions dating from the Ro-
man imperial times, or near the post-omee, a little to the N., where
the steamers lie. The chief object of interest is the Temple; and if
time permit the garden of the Khedive to the N. of the town (p.235)
and the old Coptic church (p. 233) may also be visited. The former
lies 10-15 min. from the landing-place (see above), and is reached
by passing through part of the town. The old temple-site is at pre-
sent met] by the Excise Office for storing the grain, beans, and
other tribute paid in kind, but travellers will have no dit'ticulty in
inducing one of the by-standers to fetch the keeper who will unlock
the door. Cards empowering a visit to the antiquities must not be
forgotten fsee p. xiv).

The so-crtlled Temple is in reality only a fTyprstvre, which evidently
from its size must have belonged to an unusually large sanctuary. The
ground-level of the town has been raised by accumulations of rubbish etc.
to the height of the capitals of the columns, so that travellers descend
by steps into the interior of the building. Above the rest of the temple
170W pass streets, the removal of which would prohahly bring to the light
Of day many monuments of antiquity. The savants nf the French Expe-
ditinn Were profoundly impressed by the sight of this huge cnlunnnded
hall; and as the traveller standing in front ofthe steps leading to it,
gazes down into the mysterious twilight of the ancient sanctuary, he can-
not but he struck by the air of solemnity that pervades it.

The remarkable 'i'''1ryposty1e ot'Esneh is built throughout of
excellent sandstone, and remains in perfect preservation with the
exception of the lower part of the rear wall, whivh has been some-
what eorroded by the saline exudations of the soil. The noble hall
is kept clean by government. The roof is borne by 24 columns
(in G rows), the tint six ofwhich are connected by balustrades; and
a dim light penetrates to the remntest (‘Oruet of the hall between
the volumns. The faqade is 120 ft. wide and almost 50 ft. high; the
rectangular hall is 52151}. deep and IOS' ft. broad. Each column
is 37 ft. high and 173 In. in cirvurnferenee. The interrolurn-
niation is 11trtimes the diameter of the columns, except in the
central paesaze, where it is nearly 3 times the diameter. Upon the
somewhat lofty mbaci of the roluums rests a massive arel1itrave,
which supports rooting-slabs, '2'2-20rt. long and (P/eft. wide. It has
been calculated that about 1l0,000 cubic feet of sandstone have
been Tti d for this one hall alone. The enormous wall-space, the
entire ceiling, the shafts, the enue (on the facade], and the arvhi-
trave are covered to the last inrh with inscriptions. Though these
last fall short of the dignity ofstyle which claims admiration in the
earlier works of Egyptian art. yet they display that remarkable rare

Ptolemies and ot the Romans, and renders their interpretation more
difiieult.

The temple of Esneh was founded not later then the 15th Dyn.
under Tutmes 111., aeeording to one of the inscriptions; and prob-
