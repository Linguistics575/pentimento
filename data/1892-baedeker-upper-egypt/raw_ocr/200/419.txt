C97 lien, before Ptah, before a ram's-headed deity (Nernul-/',
loving his mulher), lord of K Sit, and before Apt. Beneath are
three large w rlike scenes. The tirst repr trts the king in his
chariot at the storm of: fortre . The horses with handsome harness
are galloping, while the king launches an arrow against the fortress
Above him is the guardian vulture, and behind him are bis three
sons AmeMikhopeshf, Ramses, and Rahiuanemif, with their shield-
bearers in chariots. The defenders of the well-drawn t'tiitwes are
pierced by arrows; one is falling from the walls. A herdsmau takes
to flight with his hen].

Beside the king‘s horses are the wuvds, referring to the king: 'The
good gud, son of Ammon, the advancing lord of the sword, proleclui' or
his soldiers, shield of the 'igllters, bravely knowing the place of his hand,
firns in his war-ehariot like the lord otThebes, a lord of victory ho slays
hundreds ot' thousands, one bull against nuniherless (toes), he sweeps
away the eontederates, he defeats the rebels on the summit of their:
tuouatains, he penetrates into their valleys like the grasshoppers. Thnu
causesl them to be cut off in their dwellings. Thou desrruyest their seed
with the royal sickle'.

A second picture exhibits the king on foot, treading upon a
prostrate enemy, and piereiug a Syrian with a lance so that iris
blood gushes forth. The king is represented as a young man ot
vigorous frame, probably as at the beginning of his warlike career.

The inscription runs: "The good god who breaks in pieces tue nine
tribes of the bow, who estermiaates the lands of the N., a strong hem
against the nations, with a brave sword like Mentn. He leads
" the negroes lo the N. land, the Amu tu tile land ufKheut (Nubia).
transplants ihe people of the shasu to the land of . . ., he places the land
III Tehen AL Ihe mountain-ridge. He tills with his victories the temples
that he has built with the booty Which he. won when he overthrew the
land of Syria, and annihilated the land of Retennu, thrown down upon
its back'.

The third picture exhibits the triumphal return of the king
from battle. His chariot is preceded by two rows of fettered cap-
tives - black and brown people from the s. (Le. Nubian: and th
dénese) - clad in skins and wearing caps of straw or reeds. The
king follows calmly in his chariot; his horse, named thlttu wt was
(Victorious in Thebes), paces proudly along; and beneath the hum:
is the king's lion, which accompanied him in battle.

The inscription is as fullows; ‘The living and gnud god, who mines
the rebellious, smiles Ihc land of the 5., and aunilrilares the land of the
N, A brave king "ith his sword he drives far hack those Vim lime
crossed his borders. His mAjest V umes 0 (distant) lands, he es many
in terror'. Farther on Ivu' read 118 Sin tlseir chie lie causes the ne-
grues ofWawa to say 'he is like a llama in its upri ng, he (spares) not
[he llctennu‘.

A large picture on the opposite (N. wall) deals with the warlike
events connected with the storming of the fortress of Kutesli, on the
Orontes (Aranuta), with which we have already become acquainted
in the Poruesseum (p. 161), and at Luxor, Karnak, and Abydus.

In the upper halfof the picture the besieged Fortress is depicted, with
the king, beudinghis bow, attacking it ah the left, The Egyptian chariots
