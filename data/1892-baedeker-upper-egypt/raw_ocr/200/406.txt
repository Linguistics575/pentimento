temple of the Roman period, dedicated to Isis and Horus. The
name of Tutmes Ill. appears here on some blocks built into the
walls, Straight in front of us rises an isolated mountain The is-
land of Denir (3 M. from Korti), which we pass on our right, i the

ancient Takompso, hierog. (Q) (2 Ta-Kem-so (OOO),

des ibed by Herodotus (Ii. 20). Here ended the territory of 12
schomoi above Elephantine belonging to Isis of Philae, of which
mention is made on the steie of Philometor in the teruple-eoart of
Philte (Comp p. 300].

On the W. bank, opposite a dark moantair1-pesk, lies the Temple
of Ofetlfnah, also called Temple o/'iUararalpsh, after the village at
IKsi.1aral.ral1, which lies a little higher up on the E. bank. Dating
from the Roman period, its Greek and demotic inscriptions show it
to have been dedicated to Seraph and Isis. " consisted of an en-
tranee-hallWow destroyed) approachedby a broad flight of It steps,
and of a main colmmaded building, 40 ft. long andt50ft. broad.
Part of the wells has fallen; but 3 columns to the right and‘l to the
left of the entrance still stand, besides 8 columns in tho interior.
In the innermost corner, to the right, are traces of a staircase
leading to the root'. A wall connects this temple with a smaller
square structure to the E., on which is a curious representation:
beneath (t tig-tree (lsvoasuzdsuvoa, whenre the Greek name of the
place, which was perhaps named Penubs in early Egyptian anti-

a boy with a jug in his hands; above are three other gods. To the
left of this scene is Thoth with the ell; beneath is Isis.

The route now lies between monotonous hills. At Seyttlelr we
reach the boundary between Widi Kruu'1s and the W0di el-‘Arub,
which extends to Ibrim, At Jldmndi, on the W. bank, are the ruins
of a Roman settlement, The mountains, especially on the E., be-

of palms. The river makes a wide bend to the w., and we soon
came in sight of the temple of b"eluyah, 27 M. from Dakkeh.

The Temple of sehit'ah. - Es-Selah or Seba’ah (the lions) "
Wtdi Seba’uh is the site of a temple dedicated to Ammon andPtah by
Ramses IL, and constructed like the temple at Geri 1.lusisu, partly by
excavation in the rock, partly by building. The name is apparently
derived from the avenue of Lions or Sphinzes in front ofthe temple.
Eight 0fthese lions with human faces are supposed tohave been ranged
on each side, though only the two first have retained their heads. A
