French Expedition mention 11, while at present 25 are accessible,
to which a few more have quite recently been added. Pausantas,
xEliall, IIcliodon1s, Atumianus Maceeliiuus, and other ancient.
authors refer to them an the Syringes (:L’lplwe' of Thebes, which
name also occurs ill the Greek inscriptions within the tombs. The
word 'Syrinx' meant tirst a shepherd} pipe formed oflongisll reeds,
then it came to mean at hollow passage, and thas was applied to the
long rock-Ilewn passage: of Bibin tsl-Mule.

These tombs and the subjects represented in them require some
words of explanation. The tombs which are in good uouditioa and at'.

may also have au aJioiuiug room 011 the left. From the plan 01110. 11 we
conclude that this tomb was iuteuded foi- eeverel persons, as there are
two srureuphagurl1alls. The tombs of the 18th Dyn. were arranged quite
dilrerehtly from those of the 19th aud 201h. In those a sloping passage
leads into the square sarruophvprrlsall, aad ad u'rring this is a second hall
with pillars, the entrance to which is placed six feet above the ground. -
The oblong 11101111 usually contain niches, which were hewn in the stone
at ions, to six feet above the ground, possibly 1111- the keeping of saeruieiin
vessels. All the tombs slope dquiWards into the reek, Except Nos. 1, 2, 4
and IV, itt those of Set; J. (17) and of Ai we find a ilight ur welt-worked
steps at the enlmucu, while in the others the deseent is made by iaclined
planes. Althuugh the general plan is the same in 1111, and the ditrerense
in size seems t1. have depended only on the altlnullt of time and money
which eeeh Pharaoh was able to give to the Work, there is 110 similar
arrangement of inscriptions and representations; iu {eat only a certain
general vesetruylarree one he observed, though the inscriptions vary hot 111
sense " even in witrds, hut only ia quantity. The style is utteii enig-
matieal aud the interpretation of both the signs aud their meaning
is extremely 111ftieult. The following is a brief account of the inscrip-
tions and rTrtteaPti/ous lu the first plate there is out in the wall a
long hymn to Ra in Amentbes or the lower world, which recounts the
" forms of Put with the irrvoeatiou: 'Praise be to Ra, the Almighty'.'
Then it is said that the king knuws the Ti fovms of the gud by name.
The works ofRa are farther .glmriiierl,, and his victories over his foes.
In front of this h- m there is usually represented an autelope's heed
with a serpent be e it above the d_isc, and an antelope 8 head with a
crocodile below. Itis usually 111111111 in the furst oblong hall, as in Nos. 2,

it has been the bask "our. thille aud Lefébure to collate and torrect them.
