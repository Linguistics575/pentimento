late, Augustus is constantly indicated by the accompanying Clare
touches â€˜Autokrntor Kisres'. The temple was probably built in the
unsettled times of the later Ptolemies, and the priests wore there-

Ptolemy or of Augustus.

The representations on the walls and columns, many of which
well deserve special attention, exhibit here also the Egyptian ruler
worshipping Hathor or some other of the divinities revered in her
temple. They illustrate several most remarkable ceremonies, which
the king performed according to the prescribed ritual in presence of
the images of the gods in the temple. We have seen reason to be-
lieve that the sculptured decorations of .111 the temple-rhamhers
were executed about the end of the period of the Ptolemies and the
beginning of the Roman empire. (The sculptures in Some of the
chambers in the snnk-tloor and in several of the higher secret pas-
sages, (late from the reigns of Ptolemies X., XL, and NIU.) Yet in
spite of that, the entire adornment on the wallsis arranged according
to oarly Egyptian patterns; so that the ceremonies here depicted
were not first introduced under the empire, and probably no Roman
emperor ever took part in these ceremonies in this temple of Hathor.
The walls of the temple at Dendemh exhibit exclusively Early Is'gyp-
tian Jlanners and Customs. What we here team are the ceremonies
imposed by the priesthood on the early Egyptian monarch who tle-
siretl to worship the goddess. Thus in a representation to the right
of the entrance the king appears twiee over in the same design.
First we see htm, vlad in a long robe and ranying a staff, enteviug
the hall, preceded by the priest wearing the panther-skin amt
sprinkling incense on the burning censor. Next we see him stand-
ing before the image of Hathor, his rohe laid aside; bending for-
ward he goes through the motion of cleaving the earth with the
short hatrd-prough in his hand, because it was an immemorial
custom that the Egyptian king should turn the tirst sod on the site
of a temple, (In the explanatory inscription here, as elsewhere,
this ceremony is named 'bui ta', cleaving at the ground.) The king
also smote the first blow with the hammer at the laying of thefourvt
'lation-stone, and shaped the 11rst hriek for the, enclosing walls.

the sun. All these ceremonies performed by early Egyptian monarchs
at the foundation ofa temple, are here faithfully recorded according
to early models, both in visible shape and by explanatory in-
srriptions. They are also recorded in the lowest of the four rows
on the W. and K, exterior walls of the temple. In the temple of
Home at Edtu the king is represented performing similar cere-
IHOHIGS.

Another picture, also referring to the founding of a temple,
appears on the immediately adjoining wall. Here the king once
more appears before Hathor, bearing in his hand the bnilding-to01
