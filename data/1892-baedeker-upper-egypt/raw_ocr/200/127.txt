to treneh. JiENEH. 5. mute, 73

At the time of the pilgrimage to Mecca hunch presents a very lively
scene, as it is then frequented by large numbers of the participators
in that great religious picnic. The spiritual and material wants of
the pious lladjtidj are catered for by six spacious mosques, Ilume-
mus cotree-hoases, and alarge number ofplaees of amusement, among;
the attractions of which Egyptian dru10ing-xirls are prominent. For
the rest Jieneh differs little in general character from the other
towns of Upper Egypt, The traveller should not fail, hoxxever, to
see the most Valuable piece of land near Jiei1ch, which is about one
Fulld'an (3500 sryds.) in area and yields an excellent variety of
Potter's clay that has made Iy'eneh pottery,like thatofhssitit, t'amuus
throughout the country. Hench has a special reputation for its
Kulul (pl. of 191110], or cool porous water-bottles, and for its fhtilsis
and Tlr, large vessels used in carrying, purifying, and preserving
water. In some ofthe early Egyptian inscriptions figures of the
Ialhis and lit appear as distinctive symbols, in the exact forms in
which they are made to-day. Hundreds of thousands ofthese clay
vessels are annually exported from Keneh in boats of a primitive
but not uupractical description, constructed for the purpose, in
which they are piled up in pyramidal form, fastened together with
ropes made of the hast of the date-palm and attached to rectangular
frames. A trustworthy report fixes the number sent away in 1860
at 900,000. Considerable activity also manifested in the manu-
faeture ot'Liln-driedpottery, generally either red or black, used for
ehibouk-lreads, bottles, pitchers, vases, drinking-v Eels, etc., of
every size and shape. The almost invariably graceful forms and
tasteful decorations of these men ils may be u11reservedly set down
as a bequest from ancient Egypt.
