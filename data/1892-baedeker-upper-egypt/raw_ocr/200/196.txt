for the support of the tlag-stirs-es, The pylons lying to the S. were
built by the kings ofthe 18th Dym, and were connected with the side
of the great temple of Ammon, whence they were reached by a door
between Pylon III and Pylon IV (p. li5).

On the rear of the left side of Pylon III is a long inscription
(unfortunately imperfect at the top], recording the gifts of Arrum-
hotep IH. to the god Amman; and to the left is the representation
of several ships, recording a fe ' al voyage instituted by the king
in honour of the god in his nae. The sanctuary existed before the
Hykios period, certainly under the 12th Dyn.. end the e00rluer0rs
and expeUei-s ofthe intruders eret-tctl in honour ofAmmon suc-
cessive additions, increasing in size a: they receded from the
sanctuary.

On passing through the third ruined pylon into the Central
Court (Pl. E), we come first upon two 0sEmsss, of which, however,
one has been destroyed, though Pococke saw them both erect in
1738. The standing obelisk (P1. g) is. like most others, made of
granite from the quarries of Syene (Aswan). It is 70 n. high and
stands upon a base 6 ft. square. Only the lower portions of the
inscriptions on its faces are seriously injured. The central rows are
in larger and liner l1ieroglyphies than the side-rows. The former
date from the time of Tutmes L, the latter contain the names of
later approprietors of this monument. The usual formulae occur in
these inscriptions; Tutmes L, among other titles, is named the
vietory-Uinginw Horus, who fultils the years and enliveus the hearts.
He, 'the lovely son of the sun, erected this monument in honour of
his father Ammon, lord of the throne of the world, who is Troy-
shipped in E, Thebes ('Apet')'. In front of this obelisk are the
remains of a cubical basis, which probably served to support a
colossus. The two obelisks and the colossus marked the entrance to
the temple in the reign of Tutmes 1.

Next follows Pylon JV, in such a ruinous condition that its ori-
ginal form rennet he ascertained, It dates from the time of Tut-
mes 1., who is represented by the Osiri -eoltunus attached to its
inner CE.) side. Only the N, door-pillar is now standing. It bears an

but beneath the arm of the king is a short inscription, in which the
Ethiopian Sabako records it restoration of the temple by himself.
A similar reference to bis campaigns appears in the inscription on
the left side. Seti II. has also placed his name uprm this doorway,

The doorway closing the fourth pylon on the E. fell during the
inundation of 1561' Beyond its site are a few ruined fragments of
a structure, the mug] ar arrangement of which is only to be undryr-
stood on the supposition that five couples of columns stood on the
left and six couples on the right, and that two couples were removed
from each side to make room fur two imposing Obelisks. The
