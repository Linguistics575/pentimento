42nd year of his reign in honour of his father Tutmes I. The
skill shown in the working: of the sandstone conglomerate used for
the statue is noteworthy. Pebbles as large as bullets occur in the
stone, yet the surface has a wonderfully smooth polish. The other
colossus, which belongs to Ameuhetep 11., is made of white lime-
stone of a i1ne grain. The head is till in situ but the face is dis-
figured. Au adjoining Slate, with a much defaced inscription, re-
eords that Amenhotep IL led the Egyptian army as far as Niniveh.
On then 10 of PylonIX is an invocation of' some length toAmmou
from the high-priests tome and Roi, in the reign of Seti II. On
the outside of the E. wall between Pylons VIII and IX and on Ily-
lou IX next to the small doorway, are insr'riptions by Ameuhotep,
high priest of'fhehes in the time of Ramses IN. (Nefetkara), in
which he speaks of the restoration of a then ruined building that
had been erected by Usertesen I. (12th Dyu.). Close to Pylon VIII
is a small Chapel (Pl. q).

The next Pylon (P1.X)has collapsed, leaving frazments or walls
standing to the extreme right and left, separated by a saddle-shaped
depression. From the shattered inscriptions we learn that King
Horus t'onuded this pylon, though Ramses II. aiterwards unjustly
placed his em) name upon it and upon twogranite statues no longer
extant. The names of IlamseSIV. (link mal and above it RamsesYI.
(Nefer hak ai) are also found, on the horizontal baud on the N,side
of the pylon. King Horns and Ramses V1. are represented on the
W. side or the connecting Wall. The ruins are most easily skirted
0n the W. side, and beyond them is a spacious Court, bounded on
the S. by the Inst Pylon (P1. NL). The wings of this huge edifice,
constructed of hewn sandstone, hate collapsed, but the central door-
way of granite is still standing. Four blocks of granite, ou the right
of the doorway and facing the court, are decorated with il Relief,
representing oith remal 'ahle vivaeity King Horus approaching the
god with two libation-ve els. Au inscription within the granite
portal informs us that this king, who ruled at the close of the 18th
Wm, built the pylon, using for that purpose some hemt stones
hearing the name of Amenhotep IV. Jihu-eit-at_enh, the strange
suut-worslsipper whom we met at Tell ol-Arms-mah (p. 23). From this
it has been concluded that a building erected at Karnak by the
sehisn1Mie was destroyed soon after his death. In front of the N.
side of the pylon are two headless limestone colessi. tamses u.
placed his name upon these as well as upon the pylon; and some
priests of Ammon of the 2ist Dyâ€œ. have also eommernorated thom-
sels es upon the latter. - 0n the W, Wall, uniting Pylous X1 and
X is a representation, restored by Horus, of the Sacred Boat
