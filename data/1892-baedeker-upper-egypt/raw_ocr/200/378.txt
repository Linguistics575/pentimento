296 Route 29. PHILAE. Temple

Aaos, dating from Ptolemy and (yeopatra.-ff we quit the hypo-
style of the temple of Isis yroper by the small portal in its E. wall
between the first row of columns and the serond pylon. we see
about 50 paces in front of us the Chapel of Hathor (Pl. Q). the
smallest temple on the island. That it was espeeially dedicated to
llathor we learn from hieroglyphic inscriptions

" the time of the emperor Augustus, and from the Greek insrrip-
tion tEPTlA ETIOIHCEN --TH - A¢PQAEITH, 'Hiertia directed
(a prayer) to Aphrodite CHathorJ'i The fact that the rear wall of
this chapel has no inscriptions and the ruins behind it indicate
that it was once joined to some larger edillee. At the entrance
stand two Ptolemaic columns, with a doorway between them, the
side-iusts of which, unconnected with each other at the top, roarh
to the hands below the capitals. This doorway is built up, and it
is probable that the single apartment within the temple Was used
as a dwelling as its walls are much blackened.

The Kiosque.

A few minutes bring us from the chapel of Hathor to the elegant
and airy Pavilion (Pl. R), frequently called u'haraoVs Bed', one
of the chief decorations of theisiand, which may he easily recognized
by the lofti abaei, or rather imposts, that support the trrehitrare.
Passengers are usually landed immediately below it. It is situated
on the F. coast of Philm, which is here bounded by a carefully
built wall. The builder of this beautiful temple, deilieated likewise
to Isis, was Nerva Trajanus; but its ornamentation with sculptures
and inscriptions was never quite completed. The inscriptions con-
tain little of importance, so that the visitor may resign himself at
once to the pleasure of rest and luncheon on this beautiful spot.
The Kiosque of Pbilas has been depicted a thousand times, and the
slender and graceful form. that greets the eyes of the travellers as
they approach the island, Wei] deserves the honour. The architect
who designed it was no stranger to Greek art, and this pavilion,
standing among the purely Egyptian temples around it, produves
the effect of a line of Homer among hieroglyphic inseriptioas, or of
a naturally growing tree among artiiieially trimmed hedges. We
here perceive that a beautiful fundamental idea has power to stract
the attention from rleiieieneies in the details by which it ie carried
