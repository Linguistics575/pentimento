of Khnusu JI. V), the portal of which we have already seen on our
way from Luxor to the river-front of the great tempie of Ammon.
Au avenue of sphinxes, approximately parallel with the above-men-
tioued avenue between Pylon Ni and the temple of Muth, leads to
the slender Ptoienmie Pylon X11 and beyond it to the temple of
Khumu proper, which lies a little farther N. The temple is beauti-
fully proportioned, in many places adorned uith remarkable care,
and in various mspeets of great interest. It was erected by Itans-
ses ill. in honour of Khunsu, Le. the god who represents, so to
speak, the youthful Ammon in the triad of Thehes. Elsewhere, it
may hers be noted, Khunsu is conceived of almost as the moon-god
(with the child’s lork of hair on his temple and the tyveseent-m00n
on his head), and thus identified with 1hotlt-Hermes. Just as
Ammon is called the soul of Ita, so Khunsu is to be regarded as the
spiritual quiutesseuce of the earlier moon-god, and may be named,
like 'l'hoth, 'the representative of the spirit, the ratio internal of all
things'. As Pa CII' Hither 0r 'plan-urssv' he guides the deliberations
of mortals, anti he becomes also the divine physician (rounsu nc/er
hotep. 'the good helper’), who considerately restores the sick to
health. 0ynoeephali, sacred to Khmlsu as well as to Tlroth, were
kept here. - In the gh' at Harris Pupyrus Ramses III. says of this
temple: 'I built a house in Thebes for thy son khunsu, ot'gooti hewn
stone, of sandstone, black stone, its doors covered with gold, adorned
with eiertrum like the celestial horizon'. In the same document it is
named Pu (house) Ramses {mic an in Pa It'hunsu with 264 persons;
and afterwards: 'Persons whom he UtamsesHI.) gave to Pa It’lxunxu
in Ues .Veferlmtep, IIor lord of the wide heart, CMJ'. There thus
appl‘ar to have been two different temples erected to Khunsn. The
insrriptions inform us that he had not time to finish the 'llouse
of Khunsm', but was obliged to leave later rulers to complete the
Peristyle Court and the Pylon. The last was erected by the priest-
kiug i’inozem, coll ot Piankhi, ot' the 21st Pym but Alexander H.
is also commemorated in the doorway to the per tyle court. This
court itself has on three sides a double 1"Ohh ofpirpyrus-btul columns,
six in elwh TOW, From the inscriptions we gather that after por-
tions of this bnildingwere built by various Ramses of the 20th Dyn.,
the priest-king Irerhor,prediwesso: and perhaysgramifather orl'ino-
mm, contributed tn its decoration. Most of what we know of the
kings or the 2dst Dyu. is derived from the inscriptions here.
