earth and all lands sing songs of praise. The, praise of the king is
interwoven with the hymn to the sun: 'Thou givest me honour
hefore the king all my days. A worthy burial after a long life in
this land of the light-region ot' the sun’s disc was accorded to me.
I tultul the span of my life. 1fuWrll my life in the copipleteness
of a servant of the good god, who is free to ascend every throne he
lilws. I am at vassal of the king'. Then follows a list of the titles
of Aahmes.

Tomb 6 contains representations of columns, the shafts of which
are encircled at regular intervals by rings resembling the tissue
enveloping the joints of reeds. The capital consists 01'severa1 uruct
bell-tlowers, with dependent buds held together by a ring.

The Tomb of Hum (No. 7), the keeper of the treasury, 3150
contains much that is iuteresting. The Temple of the Sun, on the
right wall of the thst chamber, has already been suenrioued. The
king is shown seated upon a lion-guarded throne, illuminated by
the solar rays, and home by several courtiers. Before and behind
are noble youths uith large and small fans. The same chamber
contains another striking and well-preserved scene, representing
the studio of the sculptor Aulu, director of the portrait-sculptors
(lit. 'girers of life') of the king’s mother Tii. A well-e-ttted
statue of this [iowerful hut unlovely priin-nss is being coloured
by the master himself, while two younger st'ulptors (s-aukh) give
the tinisbiug touches to the head and legs. The sacrificial scenes
are of the usual type. w The name oflihri-en-aten has been almost
everywhere obliterated from the eartnuchc. The solar disc with
the arms appears frequently as a Lind of talisman, sometimes above
the single 11i0roglyplrics. While demanding devoted loyalty from
his subjects, the king seems to have enjoyed the most atTcrtionate
and happy relations with his wife am] daughters, in whose names
we recognise an echo of his own (Aten) The uife is named 'Beauty
ot'the Solar Disc. the beauteous Dame Att'; the daughters are Irerit
Aten, the darling of the sun; Aten malct, the ward of the sun;
Ankh-s en pa Atrm, she who lives through the sun; Aten "efra' ta
Shem, beauty of the sun; the little Aten bvkt, servant of the sun,
and so on. Tii, the mother of the king, is already known to us
(see above

The S. Tombs, 11,2-11/e hr. from the N. group, are not so well
preserved. The graves formerly stood open, and only those, parts
under cover have escaped serious injury, In 1883 Maspero dug
deeper into the already opened graves, and opened some forthe
lirst time, such as that of Mahu (p. 27). The cartouchvs of lou-
eu-aten are not scratched out in the newly uncovered tombs. Uf
special interest are the recently discovered vaulted passages with
steps, leading downwards, which are unlike any other Egyptian
construction. It is evident that these were the actaslburral-plarres.
Skulls of bodies which had not been embalmed have been found
