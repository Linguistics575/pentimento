became known that the N. cnlussm emitted a musical nnte at sunrise, 3,
new and heautifu! myth arose anmng the Greeks who were niwhys ready
to invent a legend in Order to esplaia a fact, The hero of this myth was
a Nemnon, hailing from Emiop t who fell at Troy. Appearing as a stone
image at Thebes, he greeted his mother Ens with .1 sweet and plaintive
note when she appeared at dawn. The goddess heard the sound, and the
morning dews are, the tears which she shed upon her beloved child.

The enormuus size of the culossi and thelegcnds that clustered round
them, rcndereni them so attractive tn the Gmxks and Romans, that Tacitus
mentions them among the chief marvels (prrsecipurs mit'umla) of Egypt;
and under the Roman empire travellers to the Nile considered that the,
object hr their journey Was attaiued when they had seen the pyramids
and heard the musical nnte nf hlemuuu.

The Northern Colossus is the famous Vocal Statue of Memnon.
This is distinctly indicated by the effusions of early tourists,
varying both in length and excellence, which are inserihed on the
Legs, The statue is composed of two parts. The lower and older
part consists of a single block of sandstone-conglomerate, and
reaches to the middle of the arm resting on the knee and, behind,
to above the gildte, The upper part was broken oir by an earth-
quake in the year 2? BAh, and was not restored until the reign of
Septimius Severus, many years later. The restoration was not very
happily managed, for instead of being made out ot a single block,
the body and bead were built up of thirteen blocks ot' common
sandstone in five courses, The care with which the lower part (now
much injured) was executed oirers a great contrast to the c: udeness
of this newer part. To the right and left and between the legs stand
female statues leaning against the throne, xepresenting the mother
and wife of Amenhotep 111., Mut em ua and Tit. On each side of
the seat two Nile-gods were represented in sunk relief, holding
papyru: plants wound round the symbol of the union of Upper and

 

Lower Egypt g The inscriptions on the S. colossus enable us to

supply what is hcrehrohen off; but these, and t11ehteroglyphiirs on
the bark of the statue, contain nothing beyond the high-sounding
titles of Amentmtcp ML and the information that he erected these
palatial building: and colossal statues ofsandstone in honour of
his father Ammon. The king, whom we have elsewhere found itleri-
tionerl as a great warrior-prince, is also named a destroyer of for-
eign peoples, a Horus (who rnnquercli the enemies of his father),
and the beloved of Ammon.

After the breaking of the eolossus by theearthquake 0(27 B.0.,
attention began to lircutell to the musical phenomenon connected
with it. Straho say. ' 'Of twn gigantic monolithic statues situated
close to each other, nm- is entire, while the upper portions of the
other, from the war.st upwards, am said to have been thrown down
by an earthquake. It is popularly believed that a sound, as though
caused hy a gentle blow, is heard once a day proceeding from the
remaining portion on the, throne and pedestal. I myself, when I
was on the spot alnngwith Anlius Galius and numerous other friends
