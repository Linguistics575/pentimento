AmmoneRa. is the lord and master of the throne of the universe, the
living and acting God of heaven. These three form a Irinity which is
the deity of Bibun ei-Mhhik, and is worshipped in Amentlles, as we fnsrl
represented in every tenth Here also Isis and Nephthys mourn for
the dead, and worship the vim have heeome lla Ut Amehthes; for as
the pilgrimage at human life is only all image of the daily and yearly
pilgrimage of the sun, so the dead king, who onee ruled over the land,
becomes like aha ofAmenlhcs, and every royal tomb an image ofAmenlhes
itself.

The largest part of all the representations is occupied by the Descrip-

. the body of Ra, in opposition to his soul Which dwells httt ia Tart,
but in heaven. He passes by in a boat, alwars accompanied by Sen and
Hekau. Sometimes he is followed by other gods; he stands in a pavilion,
round which a serpent eoits. The gods of That draw bis boat. By
the side uf this we are generally shown these deities worshipping him,
and also Thin piercing with at mice the serpent which resists his heet.
The sevpent may be eiihcr good or evil. In No. 8, Room v, the tTreeus-

 

 

That, or the depth of the grave. The

 

 

serpent , and the serpent urtite are instances of good serpents. Those

that place tbemselves before the boat are evil. They are called by
various names; Nehebka, Neheb-Ashuljeru, et _ Sometimes they are
nearing up in mmhat, sometimes lying slutldally toiled up, and some-
times they appear with legs and wings, and scattering tive. The sei-pehts
at the doors apparently only held the post at" MO, or doorkeepers.

As to the Natiuas represented in Nos. It and 17, it need only be said
that all are humming themselves before Ha, after ll]! his enemies have

An active life prevails in Tue-t; there is driving, singing, righting
l't'ilpiug, etc. It shonhi he noticed that the same representations " Afn-
