uomer was also discovered here.

By far the most interesting object on the island is the *Nilo-
meter, on the w. side facing Assuin, known to the Arabs as
hrtligas. The learned court-astronomer of the libetlive, Mahnuid
Bey, restored this well-preserved monument to use in 1870. Stxabo
gives the following excellent description, which is interesting to
compare with the monument as it now exists. 'The Nilometer is a
well built of regular hewn stones, on the bank of the Nile, in which
is recorded the rise of the stream, not only the maximum but also
the minimum and average rise, for the water in the well rises and
falls with the stream. On the side of the well are marks, measur-
ing the complete rise of the water and all the other degrees of its
rising. These are observed and published for general information'.
Readers are referred to our account of the Mik s at Calm (Vol. I
p. 319). The Nilometer at Elephantine consists ofa naxmw roofle
chamber, connected with the stream, and is reached by 52 steps in
0 flights. The lowest landing is reckoned as 4Arabian ells or about
7 ft. above the lowest water level (the dir'a or Arabian ell being
equal to " centimétres or about 211/3 inches) Above that point
’13 ells are marked, so that the highest. point marked is 30 ft.
(17 Arab. e115) above the minimum water-level. Each ell is divided
on the side of the well into 6 parts and cu kirul. The 13 old Egyp-
tlan ells, each divided into 7 spans and ‘25 tiugers, have a total
length of (tsr, métres (about 20 IL), from wh'wh Jraluntd Bey
obtained 53 CentiruFtres as the equivalent for an ell instead of
the previously act-epted 521 2eerrtrtnMres. The water-level flue-
mates actually between the top of the tirst ell and the seventeenth,
Le. has a range at Assufm of IG ells of 54 centimetres each. The
old and new marks are placed on every third step. From the sur-
face of the water upwards are 11 marks, ot' which, however, only
the half are necessary, as the Nile no longer rises higher.

Close beside the river, farther to the N. lies a massive Roman
Structure, built of hewn blocks from earlier editiees. Many of
these blocks are covered with inscriptions of different dates, in-
cluding fragmentary lists of offerings and festival calendars and
a portion of a Nilometer. The roek-inseriptior1s close to the stream
should also be noticed. They include inscriptions by Neferkam
(Peyi), Unas, Antef air, with one by Amenemha on the other side.
