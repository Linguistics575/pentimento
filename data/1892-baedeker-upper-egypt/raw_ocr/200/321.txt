battle, is traditionally laid in the name ofApollinopolis. An in-
scription relating to the Horus myth, on the inside of the W.
girdle-wall, states that 'they reached b'eth-'l'yphon and his com-
panions in the home of Apollinopolis’.

Horu< emerged victorious from this battle, and the evil Seth-
Typhon was pierced by him (tebu). 'piercer thereupon became his
name, and 'place of the piercing' the name of his district and town.
This name is clearly preserved in the modern name Edfu. An-
other name, that vccurs most frequently next to this one and has
also reference to the chief deity of the temple at Edfu, is Hut or
Bzhut. Thus the winged sua-disc, which was placed over the en-
trance to every Egyptian temple, Was named

‘Hut, the great god, the lord of heaven, who, clad in bright plrm1-
age, comes forth from the san-mountain'.

Another name for the winged sun-dise is Api, which means
'tlying' and 'wings'.

At the head of the gods worshipped at Edt‘u stood, as is appa-
rent from what has already been said, 'Horus, who spreads his
wings, the great god, the lord of heaven, who, clad in bright pltun-
age, comes forth out of the sun-rr-aiu'. Next to him rank the
Halhor ot' Denderah, who undertook a special festal journey to Edfu,
AM, son of Irathor, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, Sim. and Tefnul.

History of the Temple. The representations and inscriptions
that cover the walls of the great temple of Horus at Edfu place it
beyond doubt that the building in its present form dates from the
period of the Ptolemies. Yet like the sanctuary of Hathor at Den-
derah, it is not an architectonic creation of that period, but merely
a splendid restoration of an earlier temple carried out under the
Lagidae. The Temple proper, Le. the sacred aparti11ents exclu-
sive of the later hypostyle with its 18 columns (Al. E) and of the
rore-eoart with its 32 columns (P1. F), as well as of the still later
pylons and girdle-ts all, was begun by Ptolemy III. Euergetes l. in
the 10th year ofhis reign. It was finished 95 years later, in the
28th year of the reign of PtoUmy 1X. Euergetes 11., and the 18th
Mesuri in that year was tJxed by the priests for its consecration,
as an important festival touk plane upon that day. The image of
Horus was carried in solemn profession into the temple, and the
author of the builders' inscriptions at Edfu, in describing this so-
lemn entry, introduces the god as astonished by the magniticenco
that greeted him, and iuored by joy, as addressing bis surround-
ings. In his speech the god expressly states that 'the halls were
renewed in their building', and that 'coruiuands went forth from
their 1aajesties to rebuild his house, an edihce of ancient times, and
