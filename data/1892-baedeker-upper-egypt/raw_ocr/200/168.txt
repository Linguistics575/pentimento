On each Me of the Nile, here interrupted by three islands,
stretches a wide belt of fertile laud, bounded both on the E. and
W. by ranges of hills. displaying a bolder and more definite for-
mation than is usually the case oitlt the mountains that ilank the
river-valley. On the E., the ridge, orertupped by tlmyly shaped
peaks, retires farther horn the stream thnn on the W. The fertile
strip ands as abruptly at the foot of the batten limestone»c]1ffs
as a lawn adjoining rt gravel-walk in a garden. Most of the ruin-
ed temples are situated in the level district and are reached by
the waters of the Nile when the inundation: are at their highest;
while the tombs are hewn in the fUnks of the hills, where their
dark openinms are so numerous, that the E. slope of the Libyan
range might be aptly eompared to a piece ot'cork or to a honeycomb,
Viewed from the river, the site of ancient Thebes presents the a -
penance ofa wide mountain-girt bashr at valley richly endowed with
the gifts of never-Failing fertility. Nature here revels in perpetual
youth, while the most enormous editlses ever reared by mortal band,
though grey, desolate, and succumbing to the rommon fate of all
human handiwork, yet ornpel the mlmimtion of posterity for the
wonderful race that has left such mighty memorials nfits exi:tenre
- memorials that have indeed been injured but not annihilated in
the tlight of thousands otyears. The verdant Mops and palms “hich
everywhere rheur the traveller as soon a: he has quitted the desert,
the splendid hues that tinge the valley every morning and evening,
the brilliant, unclonded sunshine that hathes every object in the
winter season, and the inspiring feeling that every houris enriching
the imagination with new and strange pictures, whully preveuts in
Thebes the rise of that melancholy which so often steals over the
mind in presenre of the relics of by-gone greatness and of vanished
um: ihrmiree,
1he various monuments are situated as follows. 0n the right
(E. bank) ri es the Temple of Luxor, now occupied by dwellings,
and to the N. are the immense ruins of Karnak, futtnetly ronnertml
with it. Beyond these monuments lay the streets of ancient Thehvs.
'Farther to the N. is another extensive temple-site at Gred-cruttt,
which must be regarded as occupying the site. of a suburb of Thebes.
On the left (WO bank was the Nerropolis. with vaults in the rork
and many mortuary temples. Each of these had its large annexe
for the priesthood, schools, or libraries. The temples were anljoixwd
by groves and lakes, and from ancient t'ommerrial contracts we
gather that one quarter of the citizens dwelt here. Nearer the
mountains stood the, houses of the embahners, refuges for visitors
to the necropolis, shops for the sale of numerous articles which the
Egyptians were arcustomed to bring as otferings to their ancestors,
stables for the sacred animals, and slaughter-houses for the cattle
