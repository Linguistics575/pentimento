traces of earlier monuments have been discovered. The earliest
prosperity of Thebes dates from the eclipse of the lirst t1oudsh-
ing period of Memphis. Previously it was named the southern On,
in distiuction to Ileliupolis, tho northern On. A legend, known
to us, however, only from inscriptions of rt later date, narrates that
()siriS was born Mrs. Such a myth mm scarcely have been invented
in later times, for f m the beginning of the New Empire onwards,
Osiris fell into a position quite snheidiary to theothergutls orThebes,
especially to Amnien-Itu with whom Much and Khunsu formed a
triad. Only in t‘unnertiun with the worship of the dead did INiris
retain his leading rank. Among goddesse: :t Hethor seems to hem

Iraratively late date the nmue 1'lrtvtlryvitcs (the Pathros of the Bible),
of which Thebes was the tl0nrishingeapital, was called after her the
'Uathor distrij. Vnder the early empire the afterwards gigantic city
was not conspicuous. It is sellhiui mentioned, and even under the

Upper Egypt. When theHyksus invader] the ?iile valley, the legitimate
princes, who hadrnlwi from the Ireditertaueau to the Cataracts, were

centuries, nnti] lteslteuen and King Aalimes (p. S331) ar so and untler

also in Asia, always tigl1ting under the ausyices of Ammon with

(Vol. 1., p. 138), we: speedily placed at the head at all the national

and the reservoir into which tlowed the untold treasures macted as
tribute or brought m: booty from Asia to Egypt. A large share of this
wealth was bestowed upon Amman. The magnificent and gigantic
temple, erected at this period to the god, is still one of the (-hief
