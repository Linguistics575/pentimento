of the lives and deeds of the great Pharaohs, aml because they were
regarded as the abodes of the dead monarrhs, and sacri0ees were
offered within them to the royal nlanes and to the gods, to whom
the kings owed their might. Built on the verge of the necropolis,
they stood in elose relation to the worship of the dead. Just as
seientitic institutions etc. were maintained in ronnertiori with the
Serapee adjoining the cemeteries of Memphis and Alexandria, so
the temples here were adjoined by various other establishments.
These included libraries, schools, dwellings for the priests, medical
