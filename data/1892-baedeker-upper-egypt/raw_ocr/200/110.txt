were paid to the deceased primes of Macedonian origin. i It was
natural enough that in a sanutuary devoted to purposes of this kind
no boisterous festivals or Ceremonies should take place, and we are
not surprised to learn that neither singer nor tlute-player nor lute-
player was allowed within its walls.

The'greut building of Ahytlos, at first sight, imprcsscs neither
by its size nor by its beauty. The walls Consist of 1inc-graimul
limestone, While a harder material Lsentlstone) has been selected for
the roluums. awhitraves, door-posts, and other burden-bearing
parts. The foundations are nowhere more, than 41/2 ft. thick, and
the platrornts on Which the rolumns rest are equally shalltmn
Numerous blocks have heroine disjointed, owing, us Mariette has
shown, to the giving way of the dove-tails ot' syvamore wood
with which they were fastened. The inscriptions of Seti and the
earlier ones of his son and successor show great purity of style, but
this quality disappears in the later texts of the, latter. It has been
established that .1 sanctuary of some importance stood at Ahydns

unfinished. The ground-plan of the structure is unusual, and differs
materially from that of other greet Egyptian temples. Among the
features, however, which it has in nonunion with these are the
pylons. a tirst and sewoud forc-vouxt, hypostylu halls, and 2t 5;tne,-

usual. The wing to the St (to the left on entering) forms an atr-

We enter the temple from the NE. The first pylon and the
walls enclosing Court A are in ruins. L'ocrcr B, “hit-h opens to the

daughters of Ramses H. Were represented on the right and left walls,
