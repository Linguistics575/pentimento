weekly government steamer which conveyed the mails and military stores,
and performed the entire journey without stopping suftieievtly long a.t any
intermediate point to allow of a visit to the monumentst In 1890, however,
Messrs. Cook and Son again started aweekly service ofsteamers between
the tirst and second cataract, These 'stecu-whetlers' (Semneh, Ahheh)
are smamwu passengers) and not very comfortable, especially when there
is a large party on board. The dining-saloon is over the stern-paddle,
the cabins are coaiiaed, and the commissariat nmited. Halts are made
at comparatively few points, though it is possible to increase these by
arrangement with the euginuer, if the passengers are unanimous. Zaptiyeh
