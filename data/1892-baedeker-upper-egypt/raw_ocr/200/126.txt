The names of the three kings and their pyramids were found in the
inscriptions to the right and left of the entrance (outside). The
tomb is in the form of a rectangle, with the mummy-shaft open-
ing in the back- all. The representation of Atkhenu, to the left
of the entrance, is very lifelike and derives peculiar interest from
the fact that the grandees of the early period are seldom represented,
as here, in full military aetivity. 0111 hero, another Una (see
Buedeker's Lower Egypt, p. 307), lifts the anti vigorously to strike
his foe. The mode of weaxing the hair and headdress, seen both
in this flgrure and that ofAtkhenu's Wife, is unusual. Atkhenu was
a rich man, possessing, according to the inscriptions, 2350 oxen,
0n the left side of the rear-wall are represented several scenes from
the private life of the deceased. Cattle are being slaughtered, cooks
are busy at their work, ete. Above the door leading to the mummy-
slsait we see a large altar, adjoining which is a long but much dam-
aged inscription. - The smaller tombs in the vicinity are less
interesting. Several Coptic inscriptions testify that anchorites found
retreats in these tombs during the Christian period. We are now
approaching the region which, in the time of Pachumius, was most
thickly populated with monks and anehorites.

Further on we pass a fine mountain-mass, which looks especially
imposing by afternoon light, and see several thriving villages, often
situated vlose to the river. Deslmeh, a stearnlyoat-statun on the
N. bank, 13 M. from [Sagr eg-t; iyid, is situated on the ruins of an
ancient town.

The'site of the. celebrated Tabenna, which lay between Him (Diospn-
lie) and Dcnderah (Tentyrei, must be sought for either here or close tn
Keneh. It belonged to the name of Tentyi-e and its Coptic name was
Tabemteseh, which may he translated 'place of the Isis palms'. The Greeks
supposed that 'nesi' meant mm (nesos) orisiend, and hence it comes that
the Lawn of Tahennesrrs, situated on the mainland, is generally spuken of as
the Island of Tabenna. It is said that the Arabs name it Geziret el-t7havb
or Isle of the West, but no support of this could be found on the spat.
St. Jerome relates that at the end of the with can he fewer than
50,000 monks assembled in the district of Tabennesus to celebrate the
Easter Festival. All of these Followed the rule of Pachomius and her
lunged either to the chief monastery [Monasterium Majus) or to the
smaller cmnohia, Jaurac, and unehth-ite cells dependent on it. it is mar-
vellous that tho tmtpic nf lienriemh (p. 80), so cinse to this community
tit fanatics. should have been left almost intact. Perhaps the explanation
is that at the time the 1tumks settled here the strife eheutdegmas aroused
much more excitement in the ecelcsiastical breast than the dislike of
heathen gods that had long since become harmless.

56 Jr. (17 M. from Deshneh) Keheh (steameI-stetian), a town
with 15,400 inhab., lies on theE. bank of the Nile at the point where
the river,sudden1y abandoning its northward e0urse,turrrs to theW.,
almost at right angles. It is the capital of the fifth Mudiriyeh of
UpperEgypt, Which is 5975q. M. in extent and contains a population
oi406,858.The Greek name ofthe tow ll was Ktuvir.o/r, or 'Newtown'.
