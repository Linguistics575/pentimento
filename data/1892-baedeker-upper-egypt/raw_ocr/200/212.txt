148 Route I I. KARNAK. East Bank

square pillars are inset! in place of the more usual columns. These
simple artistic forms themselves suggest an early origin for the
edifice, and the inscriptions record that itwas built by Amenhotep H.
and IU. A gallery is adjoinctl by a hall with QUpillars, and that
again by several apartments arranged in a manner not elsewhere
found. On several of the pillars, whose ttu-adorned capitals are
striking, the king appears before Amman. It is not easy to detiyr-
mine the purpose of this building. It cannot have been a palace.
Perhaps it contained stables for the sacred animals of the durisrent
deities, 01' was the depositoryfoc the mum'ficial gifts presented within
the first pylon. Perlutys Ammun’s guard ot'hunour, which is fre-
quently mentioned and which had to watch over the temple, was
quartered here; er it may have been used by the priests on duty for
the day as a temporary resort Various reasons preventns from
regarding it as the actual abode either of the hings or of the atten-
dents on the gods. - To the S. of Pylon X1 is the base of at Statue
of King Horus, the lower _ " which dates from Amenhotep III.

Beyond the pylon, whi h we skirt rather than pass through, is
the Avenue nfSphim'es, bounding the processional route that led to
the S. buildings. To the E. of the avenue two Chambers, painted
in bright colours, were excavated by Mariette. They belong to a
temple of Crsiris-Ptah, who is here represented as worshipped by
Taharks and by Amontaimt, apparently a contemporary king (the
Urdauumi of Assyrian inscriptions).

The avenue leads to the temple of Mnth (see below), while it is
connected by a branch with the sphinx-aveuue leading from the
temple of Iihunsn to Luxor (comp. p.116). In a straight direction
the tlrst-mentioired avenue is terminated by a Gate (P1. r), built by
the Ptclemies, in the N. side of a girdle-wall enclosing a horse-shoe
shaped lake. In front of this lake stood the Temple of Muth (P1. T),
built by Amenhotep lib, mil now so completely mined thetit is
difMult to determine its ovi ital arrangement. To the right and
left of the gate of Ptolemy Philadelphus (“hich bears a beautiful
hymn to the goddess Muth), and both without and within the girdle-
wall, were numerous lion-headed Figures o/'8elchet, many of which
have already found their way to European museums (6.9. at Turin).
A seeond gate bears the eartoucbes of Seti Jr. and Set-nekht. Jn a
small Apartment 011 the E. side of the temple is a record of a resto-
ration ot' the tnmyle by Meutuemhat, priest of Ammon, in the time
of Tahaika. To the w. of the horse-shoe lake Me the remains of a
small Temple (Pl. U), built by Ramses UL, who here recorded his
victory over the land of Tahi and the animals and other rich booty
which he thereby obtained.
