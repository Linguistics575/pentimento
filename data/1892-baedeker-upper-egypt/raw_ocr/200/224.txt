and soldiers, heard the sound about the first hour; butI was unable
to decide whether it pro eded from the base or from the statue, or
indeed whether it was deliberately produced by one of those stand-
ing round the pedestal. For as I do not know the cause, anything
appears to me much more credible than that the sound issued from
the stone thus placed'. Doubts as to the genuineness of the Phe-
nomenon ceased soon after Strabo's time, and while that famous
geographer mentions only an inarticulate soundCfoa), Pausanias
speaks of a musical note and Juveual refers to the 'resonanee from
the magic strings of the shattered Memnon'. By later observers the
sound is compared to that ofa stroke upon metal, or even of a trum-
pet-blast and of human voices singing. The sound was heard only at
or soon after sunrise, though by no means invariably then; and some
of the most distinguished visitors were disappointed of hearing it.
Among these was Septimius Severus, who caused the restoration of
the upper portions, perhaps with l view to propitiate the angry god.
Thereafter the phenomenon twaased, and the colossus, ahhorred by
the Christians as a pagan idol, fell rapidly into oblivion as the new
religion spread.

Letrnnne has prttved that the resonance ofthe stone is on no account
to be explain 1 as e mere prieetty trick, and in the opinion at eminent
physicists, it is perteutly pus ible that e hard resonant stoue, heated by
the Warm sunlight suddenly iollowiug upon the told nights in Egypt,
might emit at sound in the early morning, A similarphenomeuoi has

to the rays of the rising sun, and the mmons sound may have been pro-
duced by (‘Ilrrunt of air, generated by this sudden change of temperature,
