Ptolcmu -Hermiu Pusui (dwelling of the crocodile). The officials
of Ahydos also resided here. The mounds and river-walls at Men-
shiyeh (no inscriptions) are certainly extensive, but still it is dim-
cult, when face to face with them, to credit the statement of the
usually trustworthy Straho: “further on is the town of Ptolemais,
the largest in the Theba'l'd and not inferior in size to Memphis. Its
constitution is drawn up in the Hellenic manner'. Tho Ptolcrnaie
kin who died here received the same honours as the xuaues of the
Pharaohs at Abydos. According to Leo Africanus Mcnshiyoh was
