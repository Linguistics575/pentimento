royal writings.

A small door in the E. (left) wall admits to a richly decorated
Cell (Pl. E). Two lions depicted on the baclt-wall recall the Gate
of the Lions at Myceme. Above them is an allegorical composition:
'l'hoth in the figure ofa baboon stands before a lion (Tefnut), above
which is the san-dise and ll vulture with a curved sword: this is
Te/hut, daughter of lla on the holy island [of Philae). Another
door on the right of the sanctuary leads to the staircase (Pl. F) as-
cending to the roof of the temple. - The innermost room (Pl. D),
named the 'Tloman sanctuary' by Cbampollien, was entirely built

 

by the emperor designated Em Pir a, and contains
scenes of worship to the same gods as appear in the preceding
chambers. One of the scenes represents the emperor bestowing
upon the goddess Isis a headdress decorated with the llathDr-mask.

I the Outside Walls only the \V.wa11 is adorned. Above the
door to the outside was placed a four-lim, hieroglyphic inscription,
with a demotic inscription below. The former is said to read: Way
his name remain before Thoth of Penubs, the great god, the lord of
the town of scorpions (P-selk). before Tethut, before the great gods
of the temple of the house ofscorpions'. Prof. Eisenlohr was unable
to discover this inscription in 1890.

On the E. bank, nearly opposite Dakkeh, lies the village of
Kubb√©n, on the site of Contra Pselchis. mentioned in the Itinerarium
Autonini as 34 Roman M. (22 Eng. M.) from Contra Talmis (lialab-
sheh), though in reality it is 32 Eng. M. The ruins here are those
of an ancient Egyptian fortress, defended by ditches and towers.
To the S. are bloc swith thenames ofTutmesm., IIorus,PomsesIr.,
and later Ramet ides; and still farther to the s., a stele of Ame-
ncmha IH. and the foundations of a small temple, Prisse d'Arennes
discovered here the well-known stele describing the route to the
gold-mines in the Writli "thlki and the method of supplying these
with water. This stele, dating from the 3rd year of Ralmes IL,
which was taken by Count St. Ferric] to his chateau at Uriage,
prompted Chabas to the eornpositiou of his interesting treatise on
'Les Inscriptions dea Mints dor' (Chilon, 1862). The numerous
gold-mines, worked until the Middle Ages, were reached by a route
a little above liubbirr lending through the extensive Widi "Oli.ki.
Granite inortars sud mills and other artieles med in the search for
gold are still to be reel], esperially in the BTrdi Yhawanib. "io-
