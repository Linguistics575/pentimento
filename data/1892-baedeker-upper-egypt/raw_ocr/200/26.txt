290.1 Day. Arrival in Cairo.

Holders of Cooks' tickets may break their journey at 111110: or
Assuén either on the way up or the way down (after previous ar-
rangement with Cooks' manager in Cairo], and proceed by a sub-
sequent steamer, it there are vacant berths. The marl-steamers,
usually less uowded than the others, may be used in desnending
the stream. In all these deviations from the usual tours, very strict
adherence to the terms of the speriaiarrangement is exacted. Trav-
ellers are strongly recommended to time their voyage so as to ar-
rive at Luxor 3-4 days before full moon; for moonlight adds a po-
culiar charm to a visit to the ruins here and at Assuin,

Passengers by steamer should beware of the risk of catching
cold by leaving the windows of their cabin open. They should also
avoid placing themselves too near the edge of the deck; and it is
well to remember (e.g. when shaving) that the steamers.rrequently
run aground, especially above Lusor. Liability to delay 1hrough
this last fact, makes it impossible to be sure of reaching Cairo in
time to make connection with the orye'cut-sttyamtsrs,
