statues of Osiris, while on the W. (rear) side, the roof of the
colounaded passage was supported by Osiris-care-ati) (facing the
court) and papyrus-bud rolnmns. The N. and S. colonnades have
allunnt eompletely disappeared, but four earyatUe-piWars still stand
on the rl. and as many on the w. Towards the W. and, in the
direction of the entrance to the hypostyle ball, afterwards to be
described‘ a numher of steps ascend from tho pavement of the court
to the dooiway. Standing in the doorway of the soronti pylon and
looking westward through the ventral door of the hyposty1ehall
and through the smaller doorway in its farther (W.) side. we corn-
mand an arrhitectural persprwtive of great charm. Thebuilder has
succeeded in produeing the effect of distance and size by raising
the Mor-level of the temple towards tho W. and by gradually
diminishing the size of the doorways that succeed each otherin the
same axis.

In the second mutt the representations on the W. Wall of the
Second Pylon LPI. rs), in front of which rose tho E. row of Cary»
tides, are of special interest. The S. side of the wall has completely
collapsed, 1n the midst of the ruins project two blocks of stone,
which bear a representation of the fortress of Katesh, surrounded
by a blue streara.lto the right of the hcholtier in the second court).
To the extreme left, the Pharaoh, much larger than the other
warriors, dashes along in his chariot with his bow bent. This is
one of the most sigorous of the numerous battle-scenes that have
been preserved on Egyptian pylons. The leaping lion beside the
king's "hariot is part of it, adornment merely, though .tt the first
glance it is apt to he taken for the king's battle-eompanirm prepar-
ing for a mighty leap. Itiodorus perhaps had this in his mind when
he tleseribed the relief of a fortress surrounded by water, and the
Pharaoh dashing against the {no along with a iisyree lion that used
to accompany him in battle. The Asiatics fall] before, the onset of
the king like ears of corn before a hail-storm, Huddled Pell-melt
in confused Maps, pierced by arrows or trorlden down by the horses,
the thta fall a prey to death. The Orontes flows by the side oi'
the combatants and crowds of Kheta are hurled into it; warriors,
horses, and chariots 'ink beneath the waves. We are irresistibly
reminded of the cm lg of' the iled Sea by the Israelites, thattuok
place only half a century later. Wliaraoh's chariots and his host
hath he cast into the son: his chosen captains also are drowned in
the Red Sea The depths have coverett them; they sank into the
bottom a5 a stone' (Exod. xv, Jr, b). Farther to the right, beneath
the fortrc s, same soldiers hold out n rescuing hand to the tlrowt1-
ing. JDverything indicates that we have here a free repetition of
the battle-su- on the first pyloa. The battle macs near liatesh,
