'Usekht mm or court of the oiferings, usekhl 1;le en 8a-Hor or r'ourt
of the appearant'e of tho protecting Horus, usekht en belchen or court
of the pylons, and usekht en tesnefrtt Ru-Khuti or court of the sacred
heat of the god of the s11n-mouutain. Ptolemy I. Sam If. is named
in the marginal '1nser'rptrons as the builder and iinisbty: of this
court, in harmony with the great inscription on the W. girdle-wall.

The lower marginal inscription on Wall a M the court says of this
king: Me has built the Court of the Appearance of the protecting Horus
[usekht khfl en Sa-Hor), the lord of the gods, as a copy of the building
of the sun-mountain with the god of the sua-mountain, enmpieted in his
building in excellent work in good sandstone; otrevings are, made tn his
divine image in it'. Au inscription on the opposite wall (m. b) says of
the same king, that he built the Court of Ull'eriugs [usekht ateart) 'ia Iix'del'
tu sar:ritirse to the sun-gud thrice a day'.

Detailed information is given in the inscriptions as to the size
of this fore-court, tho height and thickness of its walls, the number
and shape of the columns, and the side-doors and main-portal. The
length is repeatedly given as 90 Egyptian ells, the breadth as 80,
the height of the walls as 20, and their thickness as 5; measure-
ments, which taking the ell as 13/4 ft. correspond telerahly closely
with measurements made on the spot length 155 it, breadth
135 rt, height ofwall 541,2 ft., thirkness h re). The number of
the â€˜rotumns, the great ones, erected in rt' is correctly given as 32;
their beauty and strength is extolled; and the capitals and shafts
minutely descrihodt The doors are aise described in order, details
being sometimes given as to whether they had one or two wings, of
what wood they wore made, and whether they opened inwards or
outwards. Besides the four side-doors of the court and the main
portal between the pylons, the two doors loading from the court to
the gate-towers are also described, as well as the door tel. d) in
the N. half of the E. girdle-wall and another smaller door, nearer
the N, end of the same wall, leading to the Temple-Well.

The Back of this court, forms, as has already been remarked,
the hont of the Temple Proper, which differs but slightly from the
temple ofDenderah. Here, as atDenderah, the fiyst chamber is a -

Hypostyle Hall (P1. E), open in front. The roof is borne by
i8 columns, wlsile atDenderah there are 21; and the two small
chapels in front have nothing corresponding to them at Denderah.
The chapel to the left as we entei' is called T' Patna, Le. 'in-
eense-chamber', and was used by the monarch, in his capacity as
high-priest, when performing the ceremonies of purifying himself
on his entrance into the temple, with holy water and incense. The
small room on the right was called Eli, Pa-hotels CO, Let
'room of the written rolls' and appears from the inscriptions to
have been used to contain all the written documents referring to
the ternple-serviee: 'many boxes with papyrus-rolls Umtepli) and
great leather-rolls (aru-uru-0n-ineselr)'. A very iutoxesting Cuta-
