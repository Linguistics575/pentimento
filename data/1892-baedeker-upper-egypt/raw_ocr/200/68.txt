whieh the names of women titl a very important rile. Amenemha ll,
Ra-nub-kau CD m UUU created Khnumhotep governor of
the Fu. uemes, and as the heir of his maternal grandfather made
him priest of Horus and Pasht in the town of 1lentrt Khuh1 (Minyeh).

The partico or vestibule of this tomb deserves particular atten-
tiau, as it not only possesses proto-Dori" eolumns resembling those
of Tomb 1, but also shows some architectural forms, which seem
intended to reproduce the beams and rafters of buildings above
ground, The cornice projects strongly ahovo the architrave and
is supported by tine laths hewn, like all the Test of the structure,
out of the living rank. The resemblance of these lath: to the mu-
tules of the Doric order is not especially striking in itself, but taken
in conjunction with other points of similarity is, perhaps, worthy of
mention. - The interior of Khnumhotep‘s tomb is richly adorned
with paintingst Most of the representations Were painted on a thin
layer of stucco, with which the limestone walls were eoated. At the
foot, however, is a long inscription cut in the rock, in lines ofa
greenish colour, 21/2 ft. high. [In 1890 the royal names were cut
out of the rock by some vandal hand and offered for sale.) From this
inscription we receive information about the family of Khnumhotep,
who owed the greater part of his dignities to his maternal grand-
father, about his relations with Amenemha n., who, at the inter-
eession of his mother, made him a royal governor, am] about the
benefits he had conferred on his government and its people and the
honour he had done to the gods of his name and the wanes of his
forefathers.

The paintings have unfortunately suffered so mush in the last
30 or 40 years, that the subjects of some of them are now almost
indistinguishable. Most of them, however, were copied by Lepsius,
Roseilini, Wilkinson, and others, while they were still in fair pre-
servation; and they have furnished most important contributions to
our knowletige of the private life of the ancient Egyptians. In the
uppermost row of paintings, above the door, was represented the
festival of the opening of the tomb of Khnurnhotep. 'The heaven
opens', says the inscription, 'as the god (tie. the deceased trams-
formed into Osiris) steps forth'. To the right, lower down, we see
the Colonnade: of Khnnmhotep’s dwelling, with servants measuring
and registering his treasures and (farther on) bringing his corn intu
the barns. Two of the lower rows show the operations of ploughing,
harvesting, and threshing. Still lower down is a Nile-boat, bear-
ing the mummy of the deceased. as the inscription informs us, to
Abydos [the grave of Osiris), while the high-priest imparts his
blessing. Beluwis a representation of thevintage and of the gather-
ing of fruit and vegetables. The cattle in thewater and the tishiug
scene Lat the foot) vividly recall the similar scenes in the Muggaha
of Ti. To the left of the door, high up, are seen the processes of
preparing clay for pottery and sawing wood; in the second row
