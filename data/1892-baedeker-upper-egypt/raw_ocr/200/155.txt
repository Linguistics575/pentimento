corresponding temple room. Six of the twelve rrygts are beneath
the grood-leswl, and of these two are in the Mst hypostyle hall E
(Nos. It and Iv?, in Pl. n]. The entrance to crypt No. 10 is in
Room xxm, adjoining Hall l). Ut' the remaining three subterranean
crypts (Nos. t, i, 7i, the first is only aecessible by a flight of steps
tlesrenxling from crypt No, 2, which lies above it and is entered by
an opening in the wall of Room VII. The discomfort: of the climb
are uompuusated in this case by the sight of two crypts, the lower
one, the Largest of all, consisting of 7 rhambets, and the upper one
adorned with represent ions and inscriptions in unusually good
preservation. No. b, entemtl from Room VIII, and No. 7, from
litmm xiv, are closed with doors, which the tsmpre-kieeper will open
on request. Goutl stone stairs lead to botls, and no visitor should
fail to visit at lt‘ast those two crypts. Magnesium wire or a lamp
will be fonol useful in examining the painted walls. (In the stair-
case leading to No. i (\Cl‘lll‘i zt mention of a festival celebrated on the
4th Epagnmeue day, aml within the crypt is a painting of king
Pepi, kneeling anll oll'ering a golden statue of AN. All these
statues, whose dimensions are given, were probably keptiu the
crypts. Still more important are the inscriptions in crypt No. fl
(mentioned on p. 81). which is entered by a very narrow hole high
up in ltoom x. The calendar-dates of festivals instituted by Tut-
mes m. (1700 RC.) are here found. Mention is also made of the
t'act that the aneient plan of tho temple under Chews was re-dis-
r-oxored in the reign of King, Pepi Wth Dy").

We now ascent] one of the staircases mentioned on p. 91 to
the Temple Roof. Caution must, be observed on account of the holes
mmle in the roof to admit light and air to the moms below. At the
S.W. angle of the roof stands a small open pavilion, supported by
12 columns, which played an important part during the solemn
procession at the festival of the new year (p. 91). We pass through
this pavilion in passing from the G. stair: . to the W. chambers.
The w. staircase, which aseends in successive flights, leads past a
room in the mitltllt: story, probably used as a workshop for restoring
and repairing the statues and utensils of the temple. Six chamhel‘s
on the roof, three on the W. aml three on the E., the first in each
ease being vuroored, were used in the worship of the slain and risen
Osiris, as curious representations indicate, The second mom on
the E. side formerly contained the famous Zodiac o/'Denderals, now
in the Jlibliotli?tTio nationale at Paris.

Finally a walk round the outside of the temple will be found
interesting. The Inscriptions, so frequently referred to above, which
rennin the names and dimensions of the various apartments of tho
temple, were laid bare by Prof.i)iimicheu in 1875, and afterheiug
copied were again covered up. The projecting lions' heads nu the
