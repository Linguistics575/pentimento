trt mm. KAP.NAfi. ll. Route. 110

The Arrlriteetonlc Features of the court must be noticed before wo
proceed to examine its 11se8. It is 37511. deep and 338 rt. wide,
and covers an Ftre'l of 9755 sq,y s. On each side l kind of Colonnade
or stoa is formed by a row ofcnlumns and the exterior wall. Eighteen
columns still stand on the left side, but the row on the right was in-
terrupted by Ramses Ill., who has here placed n temple (P1. (O, pro-
jecting considerablyheyonll the S, wall, and atright angles to it. Both
rows of columns are unsculptured, Another srmll temple (Pl. B) was
huilt in the N.E. angle of the rourt by 5 ti II. Merenptah. Both
of these smaller temples are later additions, with no reference to the
purpoce of the roll“. and they interfere with the effect designed by
the original builder, The double row of huge columns in front of
the doorway of the second pylonwae, on the other hand, part of the
original pla The lofty sludts, which were terrainated by ealyx-
eapitals of g Lrtrntic proportions, taper towards the top, and contract
rapirlly imm ately ahove the convex bases on which they stand.
The calyx of the capitals w i surrounded with petals, from amidst
whirh slender mar -plauts Sprang. In the centre of each was a
cuhical aharm, serving asapedestalfor an image ofs god. Mariette
conjectured that a small hyptethrnl temple [like tirit at Philae) stood
in front ot' the second pylon, and rhltt not only was there an addi-
tional (sixth) pair of columns adjoining the others but that the
vaulting of the whole WIU; rendered possible by two central columns
between the wdrs at each end which are about 36 ft. apart. As,
however, there is not the faintest trace of these conjeetmal six
CHIIIHIHS . it " perhaps more probable that this eolmmatle repre-
sent: a pram one] or triumphal axenue, formerly coxered only
by a velarium, and that the continuation of it is to be recognized
in the elevated Central row of Columns in the hypostylc hall (p. [25).
III' the original Columns only five, can now be traced on the left
side, and rule on the right, rinse to the second pylon,whieh termi-
nat ‘ the peristyle on the 11 Three still show about 1/s of the
original height, nne about 1,4. and another about yr, the only com-
plete column is en the right. Upon this la,t Psammetikh L, of the
Lrifth Dyn., has placed his name over that ofthe Ethiopian Taharka,
ofthe 25th Pym; above. on the abacus, is the name of Ptolemy IV.

one at the broken columns The shaft is composed of 36 courses of
carefully hewn stone, the capital 0 cnnrser. The height is GU ft.;
the greatest breadth of the capital 16 ft., the circumference at the
top 20 ft. - The above-mentioned second pylon, on the E. side of
the: runsrt,is mostly in ruins. Kefere the doorway is an antecharu-
her [P1, b), the entrance to which wa: i1anlied by two statues nf
Ramses II. The figure on the left =itlo has fallen down: that on
the right, broken at the top, displays excellent workmanship,
especially in thelegs, and recalls the llaetlaliiln figures oi'the tsarliest
periods of Greek art,
