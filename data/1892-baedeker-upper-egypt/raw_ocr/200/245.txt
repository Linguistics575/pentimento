and oppo ta earth other, are some curious projecting heads. These
are, as is still clearlyvisihle, representations of foreign peoples eon-
qnnred by the Pharaoh, and probably served to support a balcony,
or to fasten the velaria which shaded the entrance to the temple,
The reliefs Oil the exterior walls of the pavilion are much mutilated.
On the walls facing us as we approach, of the wings b and e, we
may reeognixe [towards the top) the Pharaoh, holding a number of
enemies hy the hair and raising his battle-axe to strike, while Am-
men lie, on the lett, and Harnmchis, on the right, offer him the

s 'onl of victory . Lowdown, immediately above the sloping sub-.

structure, are the captive princes of the conquered peoples. In
these, as in all representations of foreign tribes at Medinet Hahn,
raret'ul attention is paid to the race-type and the costumes and
weapon: of the various conquered peoples. Even those who are not
Egyptologists will at once perceive that here we have to do for the
most part with tribes entirely different from those against whom the
kings ol" the Itlth and 19th Iryn. waned. The present pictures Te-
present especially the western neighbours of the Nile valley, the
Libyan: and the allied (and apparently related) islanders of the
Mediterranean, who even in the time of Merenptah made an ex-
pedition a; inst Egypt, and who after their repulse returned with
new and stronger forces in the reign ofitamsesltl. All are depicted
with light eompiexions, a circumstance as natural in the ease of the
islanders as it seems strange in the case ofthe Lihyans. The latter,
however, must be regarded as immigrants from the north, among
whom the Mashnarha played an important part. Along with the
Pelarsrians, Etrusinus, Danai1 Sicilians, Sertlinians, Osrans, ete.,
they were ii . wmluered by Itamses IH., and then permitted to
take service under the Pharaohs, at whose court, especially under
the 22nd l)yu., they were destined to Play an important part. Un
the lower part of the E. Walt of Wng e we perceive their captive
representatives beside those of the Lihyans and of two other western
peoples, whose banner the Ethiopians also followed. On the E. Wall
of Wing b are captive princes of the islanders, among whom spit-
rialiy to he noted are the leader of the Zekkari, with a curious
hood, the prime of the ',Sardinians from the ses', and of the
'Tursha fritruseans) from the see', whose head is adorned with a
iisher's cap.

Uther representations occur to the right and left in the Narrow
Court, over which the above-mentioned velaria piobnhly extended.
As in all orher parts of thi, temple, the Ileeds of Ramses III. are here
trelebrated. To the left " we enter, the him; bow in hand, presents
to Autumn the ronxluereut tribes, arranged in two columns and bound
with lotus-bands. 0n the right (N.) watt Ramses III. reaches the
weapons of victory from Ammo". In the narrow (iulewuy to the
