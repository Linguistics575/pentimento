A small canal, beginning meat the village of Ztwiyee (W. bank),
runs out of the Nile into the Balm ’asu/(p. 28).

tiOd with the FferrtvWoporitat' Nome, unanimously described hy Greek au-
thurities its an island. Sirsbo, who visited it on his way (u the Faytirrs,
arter1eaviagthe home of Aphruditopolis, calls it 'a large island', and re-
lutes that in the city of Tleraeleopolis the ichneumou was wrrvshipped,
the deadliest me of the crocodile, held sacred in the neighbouring home
at Arsinob; for, he tells us, it crawls down the throat of the sleeping
nmnster and devours its entrails. The large mounds or debris atA/pxds el-

prince of terrors, ms also worshipped here. A few culumns still stand,
here, and other mnnuments may be buried under the debris. Systematic

0n the W. bank the mountains recede a little from the Nile,
but on the E. bank their steep and lofty spurs frequently extend
down to the bank in rising picturesque forms. None ofthe Nile-
villages before Beuiguéf need be mentioned. On the E. bank stands
the Coptic convent of Mar Antonius (sue p. 4]. About 2M. inland
(right) from Ztt0n (W. bank) lies the hamlet of Bash (rail. stat.,
p. I), which is inhabiteil by Gopts and thus has some interest for
those who wish to study these direct descendants of the aneient
Egyptians in a community of some size.

Benis.utd, on the W. bank, the first place in Upper Egypt (rail.
stat., p. 1; stat., l,, M. from the Nile), is a town off0,000 inhahY
pleasantly situated between the railway and the river. It contains
a post and telegraph ofiiee and is the capital of a provinne of the
same name, which contains 160 villages Mul about 2'?0,000 inhabi-
tants. To the left of the sail. station is the Mudiriyel1, or residence
of the mudir or governor. Tho houses or rather huts of this provir1-
cial capital are, however, constructed merely of Nile mud. The linen-
manufacture for which this place was celebrated in the middle ages
has greatly declined, but there are several sugar-plantations and a
small bazaar. To the left of the railway is a tine grove of palms.

A road which Was much frequented before the compleliou of the mil-
way, leads from Meniysrtf into the Faygrn (p. M), and travellers with a
tent and plenty of time might still hire camels‘ uses, or horses here and
proceed to 21/211th eblv‘uytm via gt-Luhms (‘gate ofme Faytsm0,where the
Ruhr Tiisuf enters the FayCua, and muvdrtsh. By using the railway for the
returnvjuurney and giving up Birketellur0n, this excursion can be made
in 34 days.
