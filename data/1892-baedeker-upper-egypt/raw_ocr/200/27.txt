NILE JOURNEY. xix

b. The thhabiyeh Voyage.

Though the voyage in a Dhahabiyeh demands much more time
and money than the steamboat-voyage, on tho other hand it offvrs
the only means of a satisfactorily close examination of the country
and its monuments. A party ofi-5 persons will be found advisable,
especially as the expense ie not much more than for 1-2 persons,

A large selection of good dhahabiyehs is to be found at Cairo,
on the left bank of the Nile both above and below the new bridge
at Btilili. Travellers who take the train from Cairo to Assiit should
despateh their boat from Cairo about a fortnight in advance, for
there are no good dhahabiyehs either at AssiM. " farther up at
Luxor and Assa"an, In Cairo the best dhahabiyehs are those belong-
ing to Messrs. Cookk Son ('rsis', 'Osiris', 'Horus', 'Hathor', 'Neph-
tlu's', and 'Amman-Ra', Costing 130t. per month) 01' Messrs. Gaze &
Son ('8esostris', ‘Cheops', 'rrerodotus', and 'Hope', 1101. per month).
Other good craft, with the monthly hire, are as follows ' 'Diamond'
(ION.), 'Esw' (80c), 'Admiral' (85L), 'Timoah' (901.), 'London',
'Luxor', 'Phihe' (each 75L), 'India' (851.), 'Alma', 'Nubia', We-
nobW, 'Gamita' (each 90L), 'Lotus' (701.), 'Jfeermin', 'Manhattan'
(each 751.), 'Griffin' (80L), 'Zingara' (051.), and 'Vittoria' [55l.).

These prices include the hire of the dhahabiyeh and its full
equipment and the wages of the re'is or captain and the crew, For
the services of a dragoman, cook, and attendant, and for provisions,
saddles, and all the incidental expenses of excursions [excluding
balrshtsh), the price per day and per pets. is calculated thus: -

Cook Gaze Dragnmau

Party of 2, each pers. 33s. Ms. 30s.
- - 3 - - 28s. 27s, 24s,
- - 4 - - 24s. Wh. 20s.
- - 5 - - 2h. 20s. 18s.

- - G or more, 20s. 16s. 165.

Thus ior a voyage of (50 days from Cairo to Assain and back,
including the payment of a dragoman and all provisions (exeept
wine, eta), Cook charges 5901. for a party off) (Le. 1181. each pers.,
or 30s. 4d. each per day). For smaller parties, the cost per head is
considerably more, A three months' voyage in the '01anhattarr' (the
property of a Jragoman) costs 4851. for a party of4 (Let 6t. los.
per day, or 32s. G. each pets. per day). The inclusive charge for
Cook's excellent steam-dhahabiyeh 'Nitoeris' (5 berths) is 4001. per
month, a sum that will not appear exorbitant when the time saved
by steaming is taken into account.

Those who employ Cook‘s or Gaze‘s dhahabiyehs are relieved from
all trouble in the manor of engaging a dragoman (quite indispensable to
the traveller Who speaks no Arabic) or purehasing provisions. And there
are the additional advantages that the stores or meat, rowls, vegetables,
and fruit can be replenished en route from the steamers, and that, in cam,

at heud-wiuds, the small Steam Towirer Launches belonging to these fhuns,
may be hired for (LS). per day.
