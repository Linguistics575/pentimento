The practical introduction to the first volume, and the
sections on the geography, history, and art of Egypt, there
polished, apply of course also to the districts of Upper
Egypt. The special introduction to the present volume deals
ehiefly with the Nile voyage and the necessary preparations
for it, preceded by a briefsurvey of the chief steamer-routes
between Egypt and Europe and a note on the new Egyptian
monetary system, introduced since the publication of the
Handbook to LowcrEgypt. A list of works on Egypt is
added, and, to obviate the necessity of too frequent ITV-
ferences t0 the first volume, also 'l chronological list of the
rulers of Egypt down to the close of the Ptoleu1aie period,
and a selection from the royal curtouches of most frequent
occurrence in Upper Egypt. Finally the Arabic Alphabet
is given, showing the system of transliteration adopted in
this Handbook.

lhe MAPS and PLANS have been an object of especial
tale. The former are based upon the large maps of Kiepert,
Leysius, and Linant; the latter ehiehr upon the plans of
Lepsira, though with the necessary additions and corrections,
while some have been specially prepared by Prof. Eiseulohr.
