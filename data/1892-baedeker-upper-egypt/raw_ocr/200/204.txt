(now in the Louvre) hears 01 its N, side an inscription of the king
Takelut. The method ofuniting capital and shaft gives evidence
of genuine artistic feeling; but the general effect of th . C yle of
column was unattrat-tive, and after its employment here it found no
admirers and was given up _-_ This ball contains no inseriptions
of general interest. The hieroglyyhic characters on the architrave
are canon in the large and handsome style of the 18th Dyn., but
they merely announce in the usual formal way that Tutmes IIL
built the hall of tine limestone and sandstone in honour of his
father Ammon.

The s. part of the rear-wall of this hall in arijoined by a
chamber in which seven well-marle polygonal columns are still
standing. Two small doorways lead from the centre of the colors
naded ball into (LSANCTYARY (Pl. 1), on the front of which the name
Alexander may he read. This, however, does not refer to the great
conqueror of Darius, but to bis and Roxana: sen, Alexander 11.,
a royal puppet for whom Ptolemy L Soter ruled. Another inscrip-
tion informs us that Ttttmes built this sanctuary also. The latter
was probably used for special cults, while, as we have seen, the
granite mom of Philip Aridmus [p. 131) must be regarded as the
holy of holies proper, even for this temple. The colours on the
walls of this room are in good preserration. In spite of the ruins
and rubbish lying about here the traveller should not omit to glance
into the chambers of the rear colounaded hall. One of them con-
tains an interesting representation, The god Seth (Vol. I., p. 132;
here half ttcfatzcd) of Nub (lidm ()mho) teaches Tutu] 11. to
shoot with the bow, while Home instructs him in the use of the
lance, The hostile twin-brothers bestow upon the Pharaoh strength
to win sivtory, whichi symbolized by thes ultute oi sietory hovering
above the group.

The Columns which are still standing in the hinder portions of
the temple are of interest as syenimens of the fax ourite orders under
the 18th Dynasty. Near the centre four beautifully seulptnred pa-
p.rrus-bud columns stand in a row from E. to w., and a few paces
to the NAV. are two polygonal columns united by an architrm . In

loom Y, excavated by Mariette, are some interesting rcpt nntations

ot' animals and plants, which, as the accentpal ing ins riptiors
inform us, were tiansplanted from Retemm (Asso a) to Egypt by
Tutntes Hi., in the 25th tear of his reign.

We now turn to the 3., to the Sitleuilding of the temple of Tt-
mes Ill. (Pl. K), where there are o chambers adjoining each other,
each opening to theN. The two at the E. end are balls, each with two
columns to support the roof, while of the other seven chambers three
are completely mined. Opposite the westernmost of these lay the
chamber Which contained the celebrated Kumak Tablet of the
Kings (Vol. p. 85), transferred to Pari, hy Prism 1Avennes
and now in the BilaliothFqr1e Nationale. Unly about 40 of the
