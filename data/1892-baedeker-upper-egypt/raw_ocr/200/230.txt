160 Route 13. THEBES. West Bank:

as follows 'The fortress, captured by His Majesty in the 3th year;
Shalma (its uaute)â€™. Lcpsius suggests a different translation. Shalma
is perhaps Salem for possibly thupa --', Hierosolyma?). The in-
scription referring to the second fortress from the top in the third
row to the right, reads: 'Fortress captured by His Majesty in the
land of the Amaur; Tapur its name'. The mention of Armjur and
the names of the other fort: es seem to refer Tapur to Palestine
[a fortress on Mount Tabor), in spite of the natural temptation to
connect Tapur with the ancient name of the Tapurs, a people
dwelling in the Margiaua between Bactria and Hyrcania, and to
recall Diodorus's statement that the warlike representations on the
tomb ofOsymandyas referred to the campaigns of the builder against
the Bactriaus. Between the fortresses Egyptian youths appear
leading the captured Asiatic princes, most of whom are chained by
the neck, though some of them have their hands tied together
above their heads. The conquerors accelerate the steps of their
unhappy victims with strives, and in the second row from the foot,
a young otr1eer is shown plucking the beard of an aged Asiatic.
Farther to the right, and reaching to the fallen and more or less
severely injured summit of the pylon, are some very varied military
representations, some ot' which are unfortunately much defaced.
To the right is a realistic battle-scene. The Egyptian chariots have
overwhelmed those uftheAsiatics ', and below appear fresh regiments
of Egyptian infantry. marching in step. Each soldier is armed
with a lance, a short or curved sword, and a large shield. Before
every four soldiers is a riot1-comutissioned officer with a staff. The
command to pitch the camp has already been given, and below and
to the left of the combatants are men and animalsenjoying theirwell-
earned rest. Weapons and booty lie in heap<; soldiers are drinking
from leather-hottles; and others are fodrlering the horses and asses.
Tlle war-Chariots are drawn up in tp 0 long lines, and the veterinary
surgeon is opmrting with a pointed instrument on the hoof of an
ass. The camp-police are using their states. not in jest merely,
for beside a man drinking from a wiue-skin are some drunken and
onstering soldiers. Immediately above the horizontal surface,
whence the broken part of the pylon rises in step, we see the war-
horses beside the chariots, and the recumbent fighting-lion of the
Pharaoh guarding the royal tent. The chariot; approach in good
order like the infantry; in the lowest row the wheels pass over
slaughtered enemies. The tire extant rows of chariots excellently
illustrate the passage in Exodus sir, 7: 'Arul he took " hundred
chariots, and all the chariot: of Egypt, and captains over every one
of them'.

The representations on the S. Hutt ofthe W. side (P1. b) of the
first pylon, also representing scenes from the war uith the Klusta,
are even more realistic. [Other similar scenes from the ltheta
campaign are to be seen on the pylon at Lnxor, p. 112, and in the
