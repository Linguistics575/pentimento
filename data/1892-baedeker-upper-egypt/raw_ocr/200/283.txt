This tomb was named by the French Expedition La Tambe de la
Milempsychose, and by British scholars, following the groundless
traditions of the Romans. the Tomb ofMemnon. This large tomb
is characterized by an abundance of mystic representations and in-
scriptions. of which, however, none are executed in a good style.
Coptic and Greek inscriptions are most numerous in this tomb;
among them one to the effect that 'Hermoger1es' of Amasa has seen
and admired the Syringes; but this tomb of Memnon, after he had
examined it, he more than admired' (oradmired more than the others,

lamses YI. are superimposed upon others, Which either represent the
earlier name ofltamses TI., or probably of his predecessor Ramses v.
