across the entire breadth of the temple and having its roof supported
by eight columns in two rows with ealyx-errpitals. This was at least
adorned, if not built, by Ramses NHL; while the door bears the
cartouehe of Nekhnebt‘l. The ealyx-eapitals are compavatively low,
and their edges are bent out to a remarkable extent. Beyond this
hall are the rooms of the Sanctuary. Here, especially in the rooms
to the E., are a series of deeply carved inscriptions, some of which
are of great seientifie impurtanee though of little general interest.
Ramses IV. (Hal: m5) and Ilamses N111. oceur here, and several
Ptolemaic princes have carved their names Various Greeks, of
late date, have also left their names in longer or short inscriptions,

Ita, 'lord of the throne of both worlds in E. Thebes, ruler of
heaven, and king of all gods'. 0f the dedicatiort-inseriptions,
whirh abound in wearisome profusion on the architraves and i3ls.e-
where, one, of the time of Ramses NIU., will serve as an example:
'The living good god ' the Pharaoh) raised this building in the
house of his fatheriihunsu, tbelord oCrhebes, and built thistemple

V. The Small Temple of Apet.

The Temple of Apet (Pi, W), once occupied by Champollion as
a dwelling, lies close to the W. wall of the temple of Khunsu. It
is now used as a depository for the smaller monuments found at
Karnak, the best of which are periodically transferred to the Egyp-
tian museum at Gizeh. Diub Timsuh, who lives opposite (a boy
will summon him), opens the temple on request. Among less in-
teresting objects a beautifully executed torso of Tutmes IU. is
