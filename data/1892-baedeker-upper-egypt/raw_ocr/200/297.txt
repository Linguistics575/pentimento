The Terrace-Temple of Dér ei-bahri.

This temple derives its name, meaning the North Church "
NortlvMonastery, from an ecclesiastical brick building of the Christ-
ian period, the. remains of which are mentioned on p. 927. Del-
ei-bahri is reached from el-Asasif in 10minutes. Its situation is
remarkably line, its terraces whiels we ascend, being framed by a
semicircle or high and rugged rocks, of a light brown and golden
colour. If Thebes had been in Greece, this is where its citizens

tasu-Ramaka, familiar to us as the raicer " the great obeli:k of
Karnak o. 133). Here too her brothers, ’I'utmes 11. and 111.,
