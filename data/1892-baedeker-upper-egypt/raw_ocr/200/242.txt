For Ramses 111. and his time, see Vol. L, [1.30. Here it may be
briefly nuted that after the reigns of Ramses n. and bis weaker sun

a. Pavilion of Ramses III.

We first enter a kind of Foes-COURT (Pl. A), with two small
buildings, which were probably the Porters' Lodyes. Both these
and the girdle-wall stretching towards the S, are surmounted by
round pinuaeles, resembling those already noted in the pietures of
Asiatic strongholds stormed by the Egyptian armies (9.51. on the Ist
pylon of the Ramessemn). These small buildings beer (behind,
above the Iintel) the eartouehes of Ramses H., Ramses IU., end
Ramses IV. Passing between the porters' lodges, we are confronted
with another building almost in the 'shape ora horse shoe, which
differs considerably from the pylons ot' other temp] It (-011 As of
truncated pyramids, with almostimpereeptibly sloping wtrlls,aml
a slightly receding central editiee. An excellent survey of this pe-
culiar structure, which contains numerous apartments, may be ob-
taimul from without, as there is en open spene of about 35tt.between
it and the entrance between the porters’ house The French ex-
plorers have given this editiee the xlnme of Pavi Ion, and it is now
generally regarded as the dwelling of Ramses m., clOfly on ac-
count of the reliefs in the interior representing scenes from the
private life of the Pharaoh (comp. p. 174). The npartmeuts were
probably designed for the reception of the king when engaged
in festal celebrations and in ancestor-worship, As has been said
before, there were 110 regular royal palaces on this bank of the Nile.
The royal dwellingslo0ker1verycliiferent from the temple of Medinet
Hahn, and were never built of hewn stone. - To the W. opens the
Gate a, of lesser height. This led from the pavilion to the temple
proper, and affords a view of the first court.

The CENTRAL EDIFICE has windows and doors in every direction.
