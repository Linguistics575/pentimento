On the inside of the doorway is the name of Seti 1. (19th Dyn.),
Also in the doorway appears the praying figure of Satan, royal prince
of Kush, who according to the royal cartonehe above, served under
Iamses II. The Anleehmnber itself consists of three rows of pillars,
arranged in three oro11plBs on each side, and behind is a row of
proto-Dori: (p.12) columns. The side-pillars 0n the right amt left
are connected with the side-walls. Most of the pillars exhibit the
cartouthes of Tutmes INK, distinguished from that of Tutmes Ill.
by the three strokes signifying the plural. On the first engaged
pillar to the left Tutmes IV. is mentioned M 'beloved by Ra khu
kuu (3 Q Lth Ll), Usertesen IIL, lord of Sokhem', a king ot'
the 12th Dynasty. On the outer and inner sides of the two wrehi-
traves over the central pillars are dedication-inscriptions by Tut-
mes IV. On the N. side of the arehitrave on the right, we read:
'The living good god of the Unrna (genuine), who defeated Ethiopia,
brought the boundaries like him who was not rreated (Ptah), a
brave king with his sword, like Mentu, of a steady heart zthovemeny,
he makes the moantainsquake'. On the S. side of the left architrave
are the words: 'Thoth, lord of divine words, speaks to the great
cyrle of gods in Pa Ila (probably the home of the gods): Come,
behold the great and holy monument, carefully hewn, the divine
temple of millions of years, made by King 1la-men-khepern (Tut-
mes W.) for his father Mt-tum, the great god. who made him'. The
inscriptions on the other ai'rhitraves are similar. 0n the two co-
linims to the left are the names ofTutmeS Ill. and Amenhotep IL, so
that the columns seem to be older than the pillars and arehitrave.
The Sakai, beyond the antechamher, is broad but shallow
(24% ft. by 6%). On the outside of the doorway here also
Amenhotep 11. is commemorated; on the inside Fcti I. is named as

the restorer CN mm) of this monument meant for Ammon-

Ra and 11armaehis; and over the door on the inside, Tutmes Ill.
To the iight on the inside of the entrance-wall is Tutmes 111. em-
braced by Isis, and then Amenhotep II. offering drink-offerings to
Ammon-Ra. On the left Thoth and Hor-Hut straw the symbols of
life over Amenhotep II. Three doors in the hack-wall of this Sekos
lead into other apartments. The central one enters the Sanctuary,
which occupies the whole of the remaining length of the temple
(about 16 ft.) The doors to the right and left each admit into two
chambers, one behind the other, the front chamber in each case
being the larger. Tutmes Ill. styles himself 'beloved by Hermachis
and Ammon-lla' in a three-line inscription over the door of the
sanctuary} it is therefore evident that the temple of 'Amidah was
