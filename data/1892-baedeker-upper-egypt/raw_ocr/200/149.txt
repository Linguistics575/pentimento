chamber belonging to the Hall of the Altar'; while in the exterior

marginal inscriptions it is called A Se) tua, interpreted by

Diimiehen as Room of Puritieation. It was probably used in the

of Heliopolis, of which however no trace now remains Here a
reference is made to the gilding and painting of the sculptured or-
