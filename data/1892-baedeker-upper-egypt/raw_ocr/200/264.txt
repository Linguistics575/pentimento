West Bank :

Mounting to the left of the tomb of Rekhmari we reach (to the
left of No. 48) a lately discovered tomb, rather difficult Ol'access.
The trouble of tha ascent, however, is repaid by the beauty and
freshness of the painting's. It belonged to Sen-nefer (good brother),
superintendent of the southern city, merseer ot' the granules of
Ammon, and superior of the t1oelis ofAniumn, under Amenhotep H.
Strangely enough the name ofArexandevCArkes antes) is also found
here. To the right, immediately above the tomb of llekimrars,is
that (now No. 51) ot' Amuzeh, snperiutendent of the palace under
'ruunes III. and Amenhotop II. This also consi>ts of a large Testi-
bnln with niches in the sides, and a rather long; passage cut into
the hill.
