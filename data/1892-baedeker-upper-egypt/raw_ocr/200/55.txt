(has, a species of Mormyrus (Ayah. mzdeh), Was held in such high honour
here. that the inhabitants refused to eat any fish caught by a hook, last
the hook might previously have injured an oxyrrlsyueturs. In the neigh-
bouring town of Cynopulis (see below) the dog was held in equal honour,
and Platareh relates haw a 'very prettyqnarrel‘, the settlement of Which
req ired the intervention of the Romans, arose between the two towns,
owing to the facts that the citizens of each had Killed and dined on the
sacred animals of the other. Juvenal gives an account of a similar strife
between Omhos and Tenure (9,207). On the introduction orrJhristianity
Osyrrhyrrehus became su “full of c(vuvenls that monkish sengs“ ere beard
in every quarter'', Cenveut jestles convent all round, forming as it Were a
second trtwn of monks. In the 5th cent. the diocese of oxyrrhysuUuts is
said to have contained 10,030 monks and 12,000 nuns. In the lewn itself
were 12 churches. Under the Arabs it is known only as Behnesah. In the
llameluke period it was still " some importance, bat it has since steadily
declined. From Behnesah the desert-route leads to the 'small oasis' of
Bayriyeh, also known as the Oasis tif Behnemh (comp. p.313).

About 4 M. above Ahu Girgeh, close to the E. bank of the Nile,
are the hrsignifieant remains of Shékh el-Fadhl, near Which is
Hamalhuh. Father Sieard's discovery of a large number of dog-
mummies here Il1'0ves that we are standing on the site ofthe irecri'o-
polis of Cynapolis [kuviw 7:04;), the‘cityofthe dogs', whieh,as the
above story indicates, must have adjoined Oxyrrhynchus. Straho’s
words are: 'Next come the Cynopolitan Home and Cynopolis, where
Anubis is worshipped and dogs are held sacred and fed with Cr011-
secrated meat'. Several trough-like hollows and clefts have been
found here. some of which, in the rocks, are of considerable size;
but no h1se1iptior1s have been discovered. Cynopolis itself, accord-
ing to Ptolemy, lay on an island in the Nile, but no traces of it are
now visible. Opposite, 11,4 u. from the W. bank, lies the village
of el-Kés.

Kolosaneh (rail. Mat., p. I), on the W. bank, has a large palm-
grove. Opposite (E. bank) lies Surortyeh. To the N. and S. quar-
ries are worked in the limestone rock. - Among the rocks here is
a small temple (not very easily found), hearing the names ofSetiII.
and of )Ierenptah Hotepher-ma, supposed to be the Pharaoh of
the Exodus (19th Dyn J. The kings are ofrering saerifiees to the
triad of Sehek. Hathor, and Horus, and representations of Sehek
(with the head of a crocodile), Hathor, and Ramses lil. may be
made out on the external wall of the grotto, facing the spectator.
The inscriptions are Very indistinct but are eouel1er1 in the usual
form of thanksgiving to the gods for the blessing of a long reign.

0n the W. bank lies Samalmt, with a handsome railway-station
(p. 1), sugar-factories, palms, and fields of clover. A little farther
to the s., on the E, hank, rise the steep rocky sides of the Gebel
et-Tir ('bird-mour1tain'), with an extensive flat top hearing the
Coptic convent of e1-Bulrér.f Those who wish to visit the moun-
tain should disembark just before reaching it and ascend on the N.

' Now generally called IVr eerukrah, from a Windlass (bukrah) used

in drawing water. Bat the name is probably derived from the old legend
of the Bukir bird.
