the roof, and there are interior chambers as at Etlfl). (p. 249). A
small door in the gateway between the pylons also admits to the
pylon on the right. There are no hieroglyphics 0n the outside
of the pylons, the only place in which they are found being the
inner walls of the central gateway. On the left side here is an un-
named king making offerings to the god Thuth with the quadruple
crown, and to Tefnut and Hather, while Isis appears below. The
sculptures on the right side are destroyed. Numerous inscriptions,
chiefly Greek though some art) demotic, are found both on the out-
side of the pylons and in the ventral gateway.

The entrance of the Temple has two columns with paln1-c'api-
tals. The portal has been partly destroyed, and the partition walls
crowned with serpertts,whieh eouuevt the columns with the sloping
buttresses, have been broken through the middle, and the represen-
tations upon them defaced. (m the left (E) side the temple-wall
adjoins a wall of dressed masonry, which formerly enclosed the CII-
tire temple, forming a kind of court; white another wider girdle-
wall, now disappeared, seems to have begun at the pylons A path
constructed of ancienthewn stones led from the pylon to the temple,
but this has been destroyed except close to the temple, so that we
have to Climb up to the platform. The first portion of the temple,
the l’ronuos (PL A), 241,ir. ft. broad and 17 ft. deep, is covered
with huge tragstones, placed lengthwise in the direction of the
temple axis. The frieze beneath this roof bears the dedication-
iuscrrptiorus of the pranaos, that in the middle being a much da-
maged Greek inscription between two winged serpents with royal

crowns. The following words are still legible: -

From this we gather that the prunaos was dedicated to Hermes
Paotnuphis in the 35th year of Euecgetes H, (136 11.0.), by that king
and his wife and sister Cleopatra. Paotnuphis occurs as Pautaupliir:,
in another inscription, placed by Saturuinus Veteranus Aquila,
who executetl the gilding in the temple. The two-line hieroglyphic
iuseriptio, on each side of the Greek, corresponds with the latter:
to the left, W0rhut (referring to the adjoining protecting vulture
with outsptead wings), the great god, . . . protect thy beloved sou
Ptuln Euergetes and his sister and hi wife Cleopatra, the divine
Euergetes, beloved of Thath Penubs’; to the right the last phrase
is altered to 'beloved of Isis, mistress of Pilah and the southern
gods'. 0n the right llorhut is described as dwelling in the northern

   

a
house <CT> t and on the left as dwelling in the southern

house. The side-pillars on the right audieft bear scenes of worship,
on the left addressed to Shu and Tefnut, Thoth and Nehemaaut,
Khuum, and Ilathm; on the right to Arrunon-Ilir and Muth, Horus
