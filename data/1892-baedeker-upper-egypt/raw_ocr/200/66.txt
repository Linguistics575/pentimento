14 Route 1. BENIHASAN, From Cairo

in its Egyptian eounterparti. The columns of Benihasan eonsist,
like the Doric column, of a basis, an octagonal or sixteen-sided
shaft with 16 or 20 flutes, a capital7 and an abacus. The eehinus
or ehymatium is, however, wanting. While the swelling or entusis
on some Dorie columns, and also the annali er rings at the top of
the shaft, have hitherto met with no sufiitsiont explanation, the
same featuxes appear as natural and necessary parts of the so-called
'plant column' ongypt. The architects of the Nile aimed cousviously
at a reproduction of the stem of a plant, and as the capitals repro-
sented a bunch of buds it was natural that the cords which fastened
them should not he absent. Their number is five; and the e, 0r
5 annuii at the top of a Dorie column, erroneously explained as in-
cisions made for the ropes used in hoisting it to its place, are
simply an inheritance fiom the Egyptian column. The idea of the
annuli, as of the entire Doric column, is of Egyptian origin, though
the perfect Greek column, with the beautiful transition-memhcr
formed by the echinns, is far from a mere imitation. 'The Greek
column has become an entirely new form, animated by a new prin-
ciple proper to itself, which has thoroughly mastered the hetero-
geneous elements from without and blended them in a new unity.'
In farther emphasis of the importance of these columns in the hi-
story of art, we may remind the reader that the earliest Dorie col-
nnms known to us date from about the time that the Psamtigidae
(p. xxix) were not only allowing the Greeks to enter the valley of
the Nile but were inviting them to settle there, and that the col-
Iimns of Benihasan are 1500 years older than this. The columns of
Benihasen are indeed nothing more than the pillars in the Temple,
of the Sphinx and the Mastaha (rhrede/cer's Lower Egypt, pp. 365,
TN) provided with flutes and chamfered edges.

The two tombs of chief interest,the farthest to the N., are easily
recognised by the beautiful polygonal columns at their entrances.
The donkey-drivers make directly for them, paying no attention to
the others. The numbering begins at the N. end.

Tomb I. The exterior of the promos or vestibule is distin-
guished by two line octagonal columns, bearing a tlat Vault luswn
out of the rock. Four sixteeu-edged columns, with narrow flutiug,
stand in the interior of the Uunb-eharnher and appear to bear the
three beautifully painted arches of the ceiling, which are hewn in
the form of shallow barrel vaulting. The side-eolumns touch the
right and left walls of the nearly square chamber, in the rear of
which opens a recess containing the statues (much dilapidated) of
the deceased and his two Wives, The usual long shaft leading to
the bottom of the tomb and the chamber for the corpse at the end
of it are also present. This is the tomb of Amenemhu or Ameni,

t Some details on this matter will he found in the section devoted
to Egyptian art in the first vulmne of this Ilandhonk (p. too).
