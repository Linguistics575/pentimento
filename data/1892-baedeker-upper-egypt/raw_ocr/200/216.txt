and Auleies, Autoninus Pius bestowed some attention on the decoration
of Ibis editice, the picturesque remains ofwliich show that even in the age
of the Ptolemies the praciire of using ancient columns for new buildings
was well understood, a practice which became very common under the
Arabs. The use of other ancient fragments of buildings (especially hewn
blocks of stone) was frequent even in very early times.

As we return, we my once more walk through the tempie tthamak,

B. THE WEST BANK AT THEBES.

Passengers hy the three-weelcs' tourist-sreamers devote the Is: and 3rd
(Cook) or 2nd and 3rd (Gaze) day of their, stay at Thebes to the West
Bank; those by the fouv-week's steamers the 2nd and 4th (Cnnk) in 3rd
and 4th (Gaze) da arranging in each case to spend the first day in a
visit to the sepulehral temple of Seti i. and the Tombs of the Kings (RR. Ill,
20), and the second in visiting the Ilamesseum, Shékli rdlyd eldfurnuh,
DEr el-nedineh, and Medinet Habu (HR. 13-18J, A dWerent arrangement
is recommended on p. 102, for a three day's stay at Thebes, according to
which the tirst rlay's visit to the W bank is devoted to the Colnssi uf
Mclunon, )Ietiinet Hahn, Iic-i- eidiedineh, ehéhh 'Abd ellurnah um. 12-
18), and the next day to the sepulclual temple of Seti 1. and the Turnbs
of the Kings um. 19, 20). If iive days are spent at Thebes, three should
be devoted io the w. bank, the tirst being occupied by the C'rnossi of
Memunn, the temple of Medina: Hahn, and De: eieMedineh (RR. 12, 15,
17), the second by the Ramesseum, the tombs of Shehh 'AhdeI-gumah,
the temple of Der elehahri, etc, (RR. 13, 18,211, and the third by the
Temple of Set', 1. and the Tombs of the Kings (RR. 19, 20), with which
Cook's and Gale‘s louris 3 begin.

The ensuing desc iption follows the distribution of time suggested on
p. 102 for a three " s visit to Thebes.

The following points may be visited in a tingle Am (the 2nd of our
stay in Thebes), though not without considerable falign ' 1. ‘Cnloeei of
Memnon; 2. Ammcsseum; 3, Tombs tirKumet Mucrais t. NeritnetHahu;
5. Tombs nf the Queens and Dtu, el-2ledineh; b'. Tombs of Shékh 'Abd
cieRui-nah. A little time may he saved by beginning at the ltamesseum,
and thence prt iug to the Cnlossi of Mcmnou, Jlediraerrfabu, em; but
it is better to t the Colossi first, for they are at no time so impressive
as when seen in the early mtirxling.

An early start should be made. Guides, donkeys, Ms., see p. 103. If
the dhalmhiyeh has been anchured at Luvor and nut beside the w, hank
(p. loo, it will he necessary to cross in a heat to the island opposite
Luxor. Donkeys are, usuallyfound here, but a largepacty is recommended
to order them the night before. The island, which is dotted with bushes
and at places well-cultivated, is crossed in about 10 mini, and the don,
keys then ford a shallow arm of the river. If the river is high, however,
travellers must mw round the island. We pass the village, pleasantly
shaded by trees, and cross a veryfrailhz-idge m-emwaterecourse descend-
ing to the Nile. Un the bank is a handsome farm. - A Perry (1/2 piastcel
also crosses from Lusor, and lands its passengers a little higher up, a con-
Venieuce if they are bound for the temple of Kurnah and the Tombs of
the Kings.

We have already seen that the streets of Thebes with the palaces
and the dwellings of the citizens lay near the great temple of Am-

mon, on the E. bank. between the river and the Arabian monu-
