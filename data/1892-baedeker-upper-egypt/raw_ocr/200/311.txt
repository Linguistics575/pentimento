temple was destroyed only a few months before Champolltois tbr-
rival at el-kit, in i800, and only a few scanty traces ot'it (a basin,
some faint hieroglyphics, etc.) are now left. The sanctuary, whieh
stood within the wall, was dedicated to Sehek and liebent and
existed even under the 15th Dynasty. Champollion saw here the
rat‘tonehes of Tntmes IL, Ilamaka, Amenhotep IH., two scenes in
whieh Ramses H. did homage to Sehek and Hehent, and Hakoris
and Nertanetnts I. from later times. The town itself was founded at
a much earlier date, and in fact is, as we shall see7 one of the very
oldest in Egypt. It existed at en under the ancient empire. During
the period of the llyksos it was scarcely less conspicuously than
Thebes the residence of the legitimatePharaohs who had been driven
towards the S. The most important monuments for the histery ot'
the freeing of Egypt from the foreign domination are to he found
here.

ROCK lwecmmmxs. i The route leads due E. from the E. gate-
way in the ginlle-wall, and crosses the Atazzingly white sand, past
a small rained Temple close to the wall. In rather more than 1/2 hr.
we reach the small temple of Thoth, known to the Arabs as el-
Httrnntl‘tm (p. 939). We keep straight on, leaving the larger temple
of the Ptolemies on the left, and soon reach two [locks projecting
from the plain, at the point where the road turns N. towards the
rlesert, halfway between el-Iiammém and the R. temple of Amen-
hntep Ill. Both rocks bear numerous inscriptions, most of which
me the hierntie contractions. The royal names of Pepi and Teta
refer these to the Gth Dynasty. The inscriptions are chielly names
orpriests and their sons, who probably selected this spot for the
consummation of the sacrifice: to the, after-world. At all events there

are but few representations ofnlferings to the local goddess 3r (5

ltebent-Eileithyia. There are also some brief prayers. On the
SW. side of the larger rock is a very interesting Figure of an An-
cient King, with bare head, above which hovers the dise with the
Urasnrs-secpeut.

The small temple or CHAPEL 0e AMEXHOTEI‘ III. lies fully1/4hr.
to the E. It may be reached direct in about an hour from the Nile
though the shadeless route, especially at midday, is somewhat att-
guing. The little temple which is nearly 50 ft. deep is of consider-,
able interest from the artistic forms which it displays. The small
reuu (221/313 P.) n.) stnurls upon a paved platform, which was in.
one time surrounded by a wall of freestoue. The gateway still
stands, and was formerly ronnected with the sanctuary proper by
passage, at the sides of whith stood smooth columns with calyx-
capitals,
