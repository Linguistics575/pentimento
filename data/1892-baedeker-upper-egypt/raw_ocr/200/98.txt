A16 Route 3, Asm/io. From Assit‘tt

by line palms and Nile aeacias, especially near the riverside villages,
Here, as in most of Egypt, large quantities of pigeons are kept by
the peasants, chieily for the sake of their droppings, which form the
only manure used in the tields, the (lung of the cattle being dried
and used as fuel. Large pigeon-houses, not unlike pylonsY are
visible in MI the villages, and huge iloekg of pigeons are seen
wheeling in the air or settling like a dark cloud on the fierdg. Most
of these pigeons are of the common grey species, and attain a con-
sixlerable size, bat many pretty little reddish-grey turtle doves are
also seen. The traveller is at liberty to shoot these birds, which in
the form of a pigeon-pie with olives form a most acceptable addi-
tion to his larder, bathe should exercise this liberty with discretion
and not rob the harmless felW.1 oftoo many ofhis feathered friends.
The pigeons really consume more than they produce, so that their
encouragement by the fellahin is rightly regarded as a serious
mistake in their husbandry,

Those who are interested in Egyptian agriculture may utilise
the opportunity of an unfavourable wind to go ashore here. Fer-
merly vonvent after convent occupied this district, and the gardens
of the monks, according to Maktizi, made it possible fer the tra-
veller to walk continually in the shade, A few convents still remain,
such as the Dér er-Ritek fw, bank), 011 the slope of the Libyan
hills, 8 M. to the S.W. of Assirit, with the tomb of Tums, soil of
ltehutep and commander ofthe archers, and other ancient Egyptian
graves. The inscriptions prove that 8lsas-lsotep, the, capital of the
Hyvselite Home, lay in this vicinity, and it may perhaps be ideuti-
tied with the modern Sliuteb, ()f the Christians who resided here in
the 11th cent. we are told that they spoke Greek as well as Coptic,
Interesting coptie MSS. may still reward the searcher in all those
eonvents.

The traveller need not break his journey between Assitst. and
Akhmiiu, as even the antiquarian will derive little profit from the
scanty remains on this part of the river. Wastuh, nearly opposite
Assitrt., perhaps ocengies the site of the ancient contrtrtyeopolis. In
the (itbel Rolchém, to the E. of the villages of et-Cr'hor?bfyeh and
Ahtufels, is an alabaster quarry.

15 M. Batig or Abutig (steamboat and mail station), en agri-
cultural town on the W, bank with 10,800 inhabl and a small har-
hunr filled with Nile-hoats, lies in the eueiunt 11ypselitu home. The
present name is probably derived from the conversion of the ancient
Egyptian name Ila-abeti into the sirniurly-souudiug Greek name of
’A-rmiHTA'q (Apotheke; Coptic Tapothyke), i.e. Storehouse, an ad-
mirable name for the chief town of a district so fertile in grain.
Among the llellenes it was generally known as Abotis.

At Bed0ri, on the E. bank, 2 M. from the river, are some rude
roek-tomhs without inscriptions. On the W. hank follow the mail
steamboat-statious Sedfels and Temeh.
