temple ofAbu-Sirubei, p.335.) To the left is the storming ofKatesh,
a fortress 0n the Urontes, probably situated on an island near I.lnuss
[Emesa). Nearer the centre, the king hurries to the tight, with
bended bow. Above the rearing aud spirited horses in his chariot
are the words: 'The most excellent horse of his majesty Miamun
from the stable of Ramses IL, the beloved of Ammon'. In the in-
seription within the bent bow the Pharaoh is named the beloved of
Mentu, god of war. The royal leader overwhelms his toes with his
impetuous attack and hurls them with their horses and chariots
into the stream. Some of the Egyptians are put to flight, and a
legion of archers hasten in chariots to the aid of the Pharaoh. Among
the stain are various noble Aramaic warriors considered worthy of
being specially mentioned, for their 11aIIWs are inscribed above
them. Une of these was Khimpasor, historiegrapher of the Kheta
prince, whose dead body is represented beside the hind legs of the
king’s ho between two lines of hieroglyphres. A short 12-line
inscription in front of the elaborately decorated heads of the king's
horses tthe bridle is surmounted with lion‘s heads and feathers)
explains the exact episode here depicted. it is the famous scene
that forms the culminating point of the Epic ofPentaur, that Egyp-
tian Iliad, ohieh we have already met with on tho Pylon at Luxor
(p, Il llami on the S. wall ofthe temple orKarnak(jr.iit). 'He (Le.
s) halted and eneamped to the N.W. of Katesh. Then be pressed
the worthless foe, the Kheta. Hewus ulrme and no other
1CH8 with him He found himself surrounded by 2500 war-O/ts,
ete.' The escape of the king from his imminent danger by the help
oflhe gods and his own right arm forms the subject of the epic,
which has been preserved not ouly upon the walls of temples but
also in a papyrus-roll. Its chief contents hmebeen given elsewhere
Cp. In). The relief before us represents this eventful moment in
the warlike career ofitamses, while a repetition of the same subject
on the W. side of the second pylon and the inscription on the
architrave in the second court of the temple, inform us thatthe
lamesseum Was erected by Ramses Il. as a Votive Building in
gratitude for his deliverance out of the hands (it"2500 enemies.

To the extreme right, in front of the horses of the king, appears
first the ronfusetl ma of men and horses overthrown by the royal
hero. Beside three Egyptians who hold an Asiatic head downward,
is the inscription: ‘The miserable lord of Khileb 0oarybon-Areppo).
His soldiers pnll him out of the water into which His Majesty had
cast him'. At the end of the relief the prince of the Kheta is shown
in his chariot, surrounded by unarmed followers, with the autom-
panying words: 'He smut) ill beside his foo ltliers and eavalry.
His face turned backwart h. lie anivanued no more into the battle
from fear of His Majesty, when he had seen His 1rajesty'.--Hero as
elsewhere the king and his rhariot are on a larger scale than the
other figures; the Kheta prince is stualler than the Pharaoh but
