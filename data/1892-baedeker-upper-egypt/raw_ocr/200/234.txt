Here also appear long rows of chariots. hastening to the fight. Most
decisive of all, however, is the inscription beside the heads of the
kina's horses, which contains once more the passage from the epic
of Pentaur, telling us what event in the life of Ramses was com-
memorated by the erection of the Ramesseum. Once more occur the
words: We was alone and no other was with him. He found him-
self surrounded by 250!) chariots‘, etc.

It my be mentioned here that It series of monuments of the Hittites
rmmm with piMure-wvitirrg (dmmug from hieroglyphics) has veceutly
been discovered, including several blocks in It bridge at (Immzh (now in
Constantinople) and a silver plate (also found ar Hal to) with the name
of 'Im'rlkttmma (Tarkonrlétuos) in cuneifnnu :lud Kheta characters‘ In 1888
Dr. numauu excavated one or the chief aims of the Xiheta, near Sinjerli,
m the ICE. of Antioch. The highly impnrtant inscribed stones found
there are now in the New Museum " Berlin.

0n the Upper Part of this pylon we observe the proee ‘ion of
the Festival of the Staircase, in honour ofthe god Iihem (represented
in detail at Medinet Hahn and described on p. ITS). The figures
1shicls bear the statues of the king's ancestors, should be noticed.
The names besides the ancestral images are those of Irena, first king
of Egypt, and of the Pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty. From this
representation we perceive that the monument is sepulehral. Ad-
jacent are priests letting fly the birds into which the four children
of Horus (Amset, Hapi, etc.) have changed themselves, for the pur-
pose of carrying tidings to the four quarters of the globe that the
Pharaoh has attained the crown of both worlds. Each bird is told
whither it must fir, 'Haste, Amset, to the S. and bring tidings to
the gods of the s. that Horus, the son of Osiris, has obtained ros-
session of the crowns of Lower and Upper Egypt' In the next line
this is repeated with the substitution of Ramses for Horus. The
other birds are despatched in similar terms to the N., E., amt w.

thus discharging the second Coronation-ceremony usual at the festi-
val of the staircase.

Proceeding now to examine the rest of the court, we observe
that on the Arehitrave of the W. Colonnade the space usually devoted
to the dedieatory inscription is occupied by fine hierogtyphics.
After what has already been said, it is scarcely surprising to meet
once more the famous passage from the epic of Pentaur: - 'The
king, who abounds in strength, who chastises the barbarians and
the world of alien lands, striking them to the earth. He u-as atone
Imrl ru? other was with him. ltamses 11., the life-giver, king of
Upper and Lower Egypt'. Statues ot' the king adorned this periatyle
court, As is indicated by the extant pedestals. Fragments of one
of these, in beautiful grey granite, lie upon the ground. The Wired,
with down-east eyes. is a master-piece.

We ascend to the W. eolormade by means of the shallow steps
