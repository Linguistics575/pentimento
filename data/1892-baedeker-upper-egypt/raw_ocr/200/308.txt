V he Sum WALLS are entirely covered with paintings and in-
' ipti nst The former show the king making offerings to various
diri es of the temple, who promise him in return the good things
of life. At the foot of the wall to the right of the entrance is the
emperor Chrmnodus with Aruiiris ant] lihhum capturing with a net
the various products of the Nile (birds, f1shrrs, plants, et On the
other sitle of the net i Safekh. This symtrolir'al representation pos-
sibly refers to the legend according to which Horus tightrng against
t'eth-Typhon fell dead into the water and was drawn out of it
again living, - a legend, which is connected with the course of
the DIODIL A main door and two side portals are seen in the rBllr-
wall of the temple. The latter probably gave admittance to a eorri-
dor surrounding the Sanctuary, which was entered by the central
portal. Recent excavations in this direction have hitherto remained
without result.

0n the pieces of wall between the pillars en the Front are FAST-
eral highly important inscriptions, of whieh by far the most
valuable is the celebrated Calendar of Festivals on the wall-pillars
to the right and left. A specimen of the ecier1trieities aml freaks
indulged in by the hierogrammatists under the Romans, may be
seen in tho ttrowtt of crocodiles on the pillar at the extreme left of

The " Columns of the portion are specially noteworthy on Mr-
Ctvluit ot' the shapes of their tmpitais, some of which are overlatieu
with ornament. Of the columns, 18 stand detached, while 6, to-
wards the front, are built into the outer wall. All the columns have
flat plinths, and shafts most elaborately adorned with inscriptions.
The Capitals are of ions shapes and of unequal height, but this
irregularity does not offend the eye owing to the t'act that the mmuli
of all the columns are arranged so as to lie in the same horizontal
plane. Most of them belong to the calyx order, and are not adorned
merely with painting as at Karnak or the Ramesseum, but with
richly carved ornaments from the vegetable kingdom.
