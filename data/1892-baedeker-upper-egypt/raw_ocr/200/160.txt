the ancient Apollinopolis Parvut. According to Ahnlt'eda fd. 1331)
this town was second in size only to Fostit (Cairo), and was the
chief retina of the Arabian trade. To-day heaps of ruins are the
only remains. A few stones with fragmentary inscriptions have
been built into the houses of the town; and the mosque contains
a basin formed of A single stone, with the name of Ptolemy Phila-
delphns upon it. A pylon, which stood here 30 years ago but has
now disappeared, bore a Greek inscription, announcing that 'Queers
Cleopatra and King Ptolemy, the great gods and Philemetors, and
their children dedicated the temple to the god Arneris and to the
deities worshipped along with him'. Arueris is the earlier Horus,
usually irlentilied by the Greeks with Apollo, whence the name of
the town Apolliuopolts. The modern name Iftos appears to be

3 yr. to the S. of I.05s, Prisse Avennes discovered the ruins of a
small temple of Isis, in which the Horus of Apollinopolis, Khom-
Min ofkoptos, thetriad ofThebesIAmmon-Ra, Muth, and Khunsn),
and other gods, were also worshipped. To the E. of Seuhur passes

Naldideh (mail-station), with numerous dova-cotes, a Coptic and a
Roman Catholic church, has old and narrow streets, but presents
a picturesque appearance from the river. The traveller who lands
here near Sunset on a Sunday Ot' festival (recommended) will be
pleasantly surprised to hear the sound of ehnrrh-bells. The churches
themselves are uninteresting. Greet success has attended the
labours of Christian missionaries here and still more in lifts; and
a considerable proportion of the Coptic community (including the
worthy and learned bishop of Tftrs) have embraced Protestantism.
The missionaries of the United Presbyterian Churtâ€˜h of North
America have also had eonddemble success at Luxor, Esiieh, and
other towns in Upper Egypt, their converts, however, being ex-
clusively from among the Copts, never the Mohammedans.
Demetrius 11., patriareh of the Copts (d. 1870), excomraunieated
both the converts and the missionaries. In 1866 he instigated a
persecution of the proselytes, whom he sought to terrify by fines,
stripes, and imprisonment; and he destroyed the publications "
the missionaries (who have a printing-press of their own) wherever
he could lay hands upon them. The British and American consuls
thereupon interfered energetically on behalf of their fellow-
believers, and now the Coptic Protestants enjoy t-mnplete immunity
from every form of religious persecution.
