These tribes inhabit the region known a< the Etbai. Lepsius ascribes
to the ancestors of the =Begah the numerous inscriptions that are
found as far up as Meme, both in picture-Writing resembling
Egyptian Isieroglyphies and in a demotic alphabetic writing; which
suggests an independent literature. A different view is held by
H. Rrugsch, who has made within the last few years the first attempt
to decipher these 11eroitic-Ethiopian inscriptions, as they are called.
He inclines to the opinion that they hare some connection with
the Nubian tonguert Three Nubian dialects are recognized, ec-
cording to their geographical distribution, the Kertiis, Mahas, and
Dongohsh. The first is spoken in the district between Assuin and
Sebit'ah, where it is succeeded by an Arabic strip, at the beginning
of the desert-routes to Atm 1.Jamed on the s. and to Widir0la'.ki
on the E. Thence to Hanuek, above the third cataxaet, the Mahas
idiom prevails, while the Dangolah dialect is spoken from Hannek
throughout the province of Dongolah to Gebel DEgah. The most N.
and the most S. of these dialects have a closer affinity with each
other than either has to the central Mahas, a fact explained by
Dioeletian's txansference of the Dongolese inhabitants of the oasis
of el-Khérgeh to the district ahove Assuin (p 302). The )Iahas
apply the name Oshkir to both the N. and S. dialects.

As we leave Philw [Shelldh p. 2N), we have a iiue view of the
pylons of the temyle of Isis and the other buildings, and of the
rocks of the island of Bigeh. On both sides of the river rise lofty
granite cliffs. To the left, the ruins of cl-JIeshhed and then the
tomb of a shékh. Beyond Bigeh lies the island of el-Hesseh, se-
parated from the W. bank by a rocky ehaunel. At et-t7uti our

The scenery becomes less wild, and a narrow strip of verdure ap-
pears on each bank. - To the W, is the Gebel 8hemt-et- Walt.
