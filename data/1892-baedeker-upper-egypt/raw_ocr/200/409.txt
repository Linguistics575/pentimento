and port of shipment for the caravans croving the desert to or from
Abu r.lamed, whirh lies 8-10 long days'journey distant (see below).
This road avoided the three upper cataracts. which are not navigable
when the river is low, and it also shortened the journeycohsiderahly
by cutting off the windings of the Nile. Russegger, Laps ts, and
finally Gordon (1884) selected it on their way to Khartt‘tm. A short
excureion along this desert-route, between the hills, black with
iron-scale, is not uninteresting; " the traveller may ascend (1 hr.;
steep andstony) the hill of Att-ae et-Guartmi, close to Kent. 0n
the summit is the tomb of the saint to whom the hill owes its
name, a frequented pilgrim-resort. The view extends over the Nile
valley as far as Den: A fort has recently been erected by the Bri-
tish at Kent k0. On the bank of the rite: is a colfee hon e

and the hills. Passengers by Cooy's steamers have an opportunity of

The Temple of'AmAdah has a very ttnpretcntling exterior and
