236 Route 22. EL-KA lr. From Thebes

bis. Orr the W. bank stretches a broad and fertile plain, on the
E. is the finely shaped Gebet Sheromh. At el-flaw?, en the E. hank,
appears the first sandstone.

On the W. bank, about 'h hr. farther tn the s., is the pyramid 0f
el-Kumh, which now presents the aspect of n step-pyramid, owing to the
decay of the filling-in material. The entrance was on the w. side, In
spite nf its ruinous 20nd ion it is still about 30 ft. high, While its base
occupies an area ahuut 55 n. square. Naspero recently carried on exch-
vations here, which injured the huilding without yielding any important
IDSHIL. As there are no inscriptions it is oirrrcult to determine the flute
of its constructinn.

station of the four week steamers (from U ann. to 211,111.) and oi'
the mail-steamer is at Baguliyeh, properly t Frrl?hiyeli.

An old femiy appears m prntTer his sew es as smm as a Maha,

poor Huddlerclnths.

1Glf-a-day suffices for a ilyiu,: C it to the following: 1. the
*Ruins of the ancient tuwn; 2. the Rack Inseviptions; 3. the *Chupel
of Amcnhotcp 111.; 4. the Rack Tempe! of the Ptolemies; and 5. the
'Tombs. If so much time rannut be spared, the last shuuld at least
be visited. The various monuments may be visited in the zubove
order as follows. We skirt the huundary wall of the ancient town,
which is distinctly Visible, then turn to the bl. to (3/4hr.|au isolated
hill, rising from the plain, on the right side oiihiult are must of the
rock-inscriptions. At the end of this valley we turn a little to the
left to rear-h the chapel of Arueulsotep 111., witl; tour columns in
the interior. We here turn round, and fnlluwing the s. wall 01" the
more northerly chain of hills, reach the steps which lead to the
1woek-ternple. We may then visit the small temple of Thoth (called
try the Arabs ei-rrmnvirrt, 'the heth’), er proceed to the tombs,
about 1M. from the river.

The new vanished town of Hebent was called by the Greeks

The interpretation of the mme at" the city and its goddess as Nelclmb
and Suhen is probably wrong. The *Gmum WALL is in exrellcnt
Preservation, and encloses a square the sides of which are 700 yds.
long, with a total circumference et'QSOO yds. The wall itself is of
immense thickness, 37 ft. or as wide as a L-unsiderahle street, and
is built of huge san-dried Nileebrirks. The savauts of the French
Expedition estimated that the ancient town aeeoulmodated 10,000
inhabitants. Visitors should not omit to mount the broad ascent to
the top of the wall on the W. side, from which a good survey of the
tombs en the N. hill-ehain is also obtained. Apparently only the
temples and public buildings, the linner city', stood within thewalls,
while various suburbs stretched beyond them; though in times of
danger the entire population found refuge within the ramparts. The
