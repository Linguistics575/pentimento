the contests of the god Horus with his enemies who are depicted
as Crocodiles and hipprspotarni. Perhaps the overthrow of the foes
of King Ptolemy X. Soter H. is synthetically represented in these
compositions. The cartouches on this wall probably belong to this
king; one at them contains the name of Ptulmis, while the other is
vacant. The name of Ptolemy XI. Alexander I. does not appear
until near the left extremity of the wall, towards the end of the
list of names.

The Reyresentations. ranged in um registers, are '22 in number. The
chief are the following; lst Scent. (helow, m the right). The king, stand-
ine on shore attempts to transiix a hippopotamus, that bends its head

On the in de of the N. Girdle-u'all (PI. g g) are several long
hymns to the gnd of Erlfu.--The traveller i. recommended to walk
round the outside of the girdle-wall, which is also completely
covered with representations andinscriptions. The above-meutioned
important inscription relating to the history of the temple is to be
seen on the outside of the W. Watt (Pl. il, and the description of
the various rooms outside the E. Mrolt (Pl. k). The eight Rwards
of Donations of Fields are also on the E. wall. These inscriptions
and the decoration of the entire external face of the Jrirdle-wall
date from the reign of Ptolemy XI. Alexander I. (106- -87 B. J).
