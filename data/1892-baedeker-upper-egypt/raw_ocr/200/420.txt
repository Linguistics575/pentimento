reports of two spies, and had despatched several of his regiments in
another direction. In the picture to the right the king sits upon his
throne, among his courtiers. To the right and left or the royal person is
the account of an event in the 5th year of his reign, already known In

seeking service under the Pharaoh They stated that the Khete lay at
Khirahu (Helhon tie. Aleppo) to the N. of Thunep, and were in terms of
the Egyptians This information was false, and the two spies were Mgged
[in the lowest scene to the right), in order, as the inscription seys, that
they might say where the miserable Kheta lurked. The spies were next
brought before the king UTI his golden throne, and cruss-examinet}, and
finally confessed that the Kheta, with numt‘z‘ous allies, lay behind Katesh.
The king assembles his generals, relates what the spies have told, chides
his timers for being so imperfectly informed, and orders the recall of the

The other chambers of this temple are less interesting, and
their examination is rendered troublesome by the swarms of bats
that fly against the lights. They contain only the usual scenes of
offerings, most at them unfinished. As the accompanying plan
(p. 332) shows, two parallel chambers (P1. 0, N) run oil' from the
N. side of the main hall, while from the ends of the back wall lead
two oblique passages (P1. K, G), from each of which run two parallel
chambers (Pl. L, M, and Pl, I , 1). Round the walls of these latter
chambers run stone benches, less than 3 ft. high. In the S.W.
chamber (P1. r) is the picture of an altar with a hieratic inscri -
tion. Directly behind the main hall (Pt. F) is a smaller hall(Pl. E;
36 ft. broad, 25 ft. deep), with four pillars. 0n the N. and S. walls
are depicted the boats with the shrines of Harmachis and Amnlon,
borne in each case by 20 priests. Three doors lesu1 hence to a long
narrow chamber (Pl. ll), at the back of which are three recesses
(PL A, C, D). In the central recess, the sanctuary, stands an altar,
