When the wicked prince awake, his vizier said tn him, 'Alt thy snhjects

fields?' The wicked prince was very angry when he beard that; hut as

summoned the dead frnm their graves; and in the murminghe hehehl rmm

when the harvest came, not it blade grew in the fields, for the dead had

The temple of Kém Omho is a Double Temple, and it is the
only one in Egypt that is divided along its longer axis into two dis-
tinrtly disilned parts. Even the entrance has two portals. In the interior
the various chumhers are not approached as usual by one door each;
everywhere two dontwa ys are seen. separated by broad pillars earh of
which is a point in the imaginary line ir1dieatiugthe division between
the two portions of the temple. The plan ofthe whole may be made
ont with perfect certainty, though many of the rooms, especially
those towards the rear, are largely sanded up. The temple moreover
contained two sanctuaries, a fact which is scarcely surprising after
what has been said of the two chief deities, Arueris and Seheh.

The Hypostyle Pronaos. - The Double Portal ot' the main
temple consists of two doors, framed by three columns and each
displayinga concave rnrnice and a winged sun-disc. The floor of
the hypostyle is eneurnbered with sand. Thirteen columns are still
standing, each of which measures no less than 20 ft. round the
middle of the shaft. The two corner columns in front are apparently
wanting; there were in all three rows of tive or perhaps three rows
of seven. The capitals, of great variety of form, belong to the
Ptolemaie-Egyptian order; but they differ in various points from
those to be seen atDendorah, Esroeh,audEclim The middle column
in the hack row has a calyx-eapital, with A foliage-cup displaying
a unique ornamentation, with three tlowers and three buds spring-
ing from it. The unfinished ealyx-eapital of the most northerly
column in the same (rear) row has, at its base, a wreath of fJowers
with serrated edges, between which are arranged pairs ofhuds, each
pair surmounted by a six-pointed star, though elsewhere the Egyp-
tian star is always five-pointed W.

This hypostyle was built by Ptolemy XIII. Neos Dionysus and
his wife Cleopatra v., whnse surname Tryphaena is of frequent oo-
currence among the Ptolemies. The name of the builder
