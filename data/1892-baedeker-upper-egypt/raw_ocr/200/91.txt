FruJfmu LABYRINTH. 2. Route. 39

thus reach the Kalagantuh structure, which consists of a terrace of
six carefully jointed steps of large and u'ell-hewn blocks, but bears
no inscription whatever, We cross the Balm et-Ward/in, which
now intersects the ruins near the Pyramid of Hawirah, and which
is sometimes called by the Arabs Balrr et-hMekh or Ruhr ssh-Surly,
Le. river at the East. 0n the E. side lies the mass of buildings,
which, according to Lepsius, was probably the Labyrinth (see be-
low). In order to obtain a survey of these interesting ruins the
traveller is recommended to asrend at once the Pyramid ot Ha-
whrah. This consists of unbnrut bricks orNile mud mixed with straw
(Vol, L, p. 370), and, when its sides were perfect, covered an area
of upwards of 116 sq. yards. It has been ascertained that the nu-
eieus of the structure is a natural mass of rock, 39 ft. in height. The
dilapidated summit is easily reached in a few minutes by a, flight or
well-worn stops. The entrance to the pyramid, on the S. side, Was
discovered in 1889 by Mr. Flinders Petrie. The tomb chamber
is 22 ft. long, S ft. wide, and 6 ft. high; it was covered with three
large slabs of stone and eontaincd two sarcophagi, one of them of
polished sandstone without inscription, and fragments of an ala-
baster vase with the name of Arnenemha m. The chamber Was
tlrled with water to a depth of 3 ft.

Towards the S we thervc a cungeries of chambers and passages
of uuhnrnt bricks, bounded hy the Baht esh-Sllerlii, and pronounced
by Lepsins to he the right side of the Labyrinth, and the only part
of it which is to some extent preserved. 0n the other side of the
Pyramid there was doubtless a similar collection of rooms “hich has
now disappeared; and several other structures beyond them, of which
traces still remain, must have once existed there. The whole Lr1by-
rinth must have been in the shape of a horseshoe. Between the hh ing
of the Labyrinth which still exists, and that which has disappeared,
lies an extensive space strewn with broken pottery, in the middle
of which are large fragments of l magniiieerrt ancient temple. The
base of the shaft of a small papyrus column, and .1 capital of the same
order, both in the red stone of AssuLr, with sculptured stalks and
fnhage, are worthy of notice. Some Mocks disintened here bearing
the name at Amenomha m. have again how covered with sand.
Several large hlncks of limestone are also ohsewod in the middle of
this large court of the Labyrinth. The inscriptions are almost cn-
tirely destroyed, but faint traces of painting, and the symbols co

(in) and oo, are still recngnisabie. From the traces still es-

isting, the whole structure would appear to have occupied an area
of 8800 sq. yds., and the large inner court an area of about 00 acres.

The Ancient Labyrinth. According tu Brngsch, the Greek name Lama
rinthus. which has been ain'mnny interpreted, is derived frum mum“
ftp 'elpa-ruinrnt', i. e. the ”Temple of the mouth of the Lake'. The im
srrripttrms found here by Lepsins prove mu it was founded hy Amery
