beholder by the building new, ruined but with its whole plan and
theory still clear and intelligible There is nothing now to dirtrat't
the eye from the lines and forms of the temple; and the pump ot'
banners and the clouds of im-eme are replaced by the magic of
dignified antiquity. Amidstthesehnary ruins, we realize the short-
ness ot' our mortal span and recognize the BVant‘bcent‘B of human
greatness and splendour.

Starting from the great pylon ot' the temple of Luxnr, “e pre-
ceed to the E., then follow the street with the Greek shops, and
leaving the houses of the ghawird and the hill with the tomb of
the shékh to the right, hold towards the N. We soon arrise at the
lirst ruins orkaruak, and tirudly, " we have followed the W. mute,
reach an imposing row or Kriosphimres, Le. sphium with the bo-
dies at lions and the heads of rams. r this point, to the S. ot
the temple, are two almost parallel Prostssiumtl Avenues tlanltetl
with sphinxes, one uniting the temple of Muth (p. 128) “ith the
S. pylons (p. Iii), the other leading from the temple of Liner to
the temple of lihunsu (p. MS) The<e two avenues were connected
with each other by a third -ayer1ue of sphinses. We follow
the left CW.) M‘enue. the tlanking sphinxes of which are can ed in
the grand style and are placed close to each other. Between the legs
of each is a :tatuette with the name ofAmenhotep Ill. (Ra-ma-rw-b).
This leads us to the handsome but almoat toe slender Pylon tlf,
erected by Ptolemy Ill. Euergetes L, ssith a winged sun-disc in the
easement, with boidry-sprsad piniom. 1n the time of the Lapidae
additional pylons, corresponding to this one, were placed at the us-
treme corners of the temple, That on the N. side (p. 133] ie, still in
admirable preservation. Inside the portal Euergutc rcprcrented
in Egyptian style th nigh clad in Greek costume. To the l It oi
the lowest npresentatirm on the left side, the king appear. V t-ri-
ticiug to Khunsu Between these are the hawk ot' Horus, the sul-
ture of Nelcheb, and the ibis of Thoth, which are also repwsrmterl
tlying, to bear to the worlrl intelligence ofthe hutlles, victun ., and
wisdom ot' the prince. The inscriptions record that this pylon was.
dedicated to Khunsn of Thehee. Another avenue of sphinms
follows, beyond which rises the Temple of Khunsu (P1. Y.), a hand-
some building on which, however, He now bestow only a passing
glance (comp, y. 143). About 200 paces towards the W. bring us
to the First Main Pylon (et-W, el-keUr), which faces the river. We
here begin our description of the temple.
