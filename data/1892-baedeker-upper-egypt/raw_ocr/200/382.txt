300 LOWER NUBIA. History.

therefore who desire to proceed to the second cataract should stipulate in
their contract (p. SSH), for a boat able to perform the entire voyage.

lip, and is divided into Lower Nubint between the first two cata-
racts, and Upper Nubia, above the second cataract. Upper Nubia)
which with the Sridlin and Dirhir was formerly subject to Egypt,
is at present independent. and is not accessible for tourists. Lower
Nubia belongs to the mudinyeh of I.ieneh,icom which it is governed,
so far as it is not under military (British) rule. It extends to
about N. lat. 200.

The cultivable strip, even in Lower Nnhia, is seldom 1I10t0 than
a few hundred yards wide, while it is generally much narrower, so
that the desert approaches close up to the banks of the Nile. As a
natural consequence the population is scanty; it is estimated to be
not more than 40,000 between the iirst and second cataracts. The
Nile tlows for the first half of the distance between the cataracts
from S. to N., for the second half from SE. toN. w., and in Upper
Nubia from N. to S. The Monuments of Lower Vuhia are nearly all
on the W. bank, where they were lecs exposed to hostile attack. The
most interesting. is the temple ofAbu-Simbcl, the last station before
MTulirVltah. The monuments in Upper Nubia are rarer but not less
remarkable, as e.g. those at Gebel Barkal.
