glomerate, of a yellowish-brown colour and very diftisult to work.

The tl. Colossus is in better preservation than the N. one, but
there is [ittlediiferenee between them in point of size. The dimer.
sions of the former, in which the original form is more easily seen,
are as follows: height of the figure, 52’ ft, height of the pedestal on
which the feet rest, 13 ft, height of the entire monument, 64 ft.
But when the Jigure was adorned with the long-since vanished
crown, the original height may have reached 69 ft. The legs from
the sole to the knee measure IN 2 ft., and each foot is 101/2 ft.
long. The breadth orthe shoulders is IN 4 ft.; the middle Jinger
on one hand is 41/2 ft. long; and the arm from the tip of the
ilnger to the elbow measures 151/2 ft. The entire colossus, includ-
ing the throne and pedestal, weighs 1175 tons.

Both statues face 13.5.13. and stand parallel to the course of the Nile,
though they are un longer perpendicular, as one inclines a little towards
the other and both are canted slightly backwards. The S. rolnssus is it
little in front of lhe N, one, from Which it is 22 paces distant. Both are
seamed with cracks, and such large fragments have ialien from them, that
one chum imagine that an attempt has been made tn destruy them by fire.
The Arahs call the N. eolossus Tania, the S. one 8hama, and both ue
gether Salamn’l, Ot' 'the greetingsw

When the Nile is at its highest, its waters reach the soles of the feet
of the colossi and some mos the upper surface of the pedestal ou Which
they rest, As this pedestal is [3 ft. high and as the statues must have
been beyond the reach hf inundatious in the time Of the Pharaohs, Lepsius
is correct in assuming from Is observations of the nilumeter at e‘emneh
(p. 312) that the bed " the IV le at that puint must have been considerably
raised within historical times. He estimates the total rise at 25ft. In
