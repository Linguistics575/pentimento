278 Route 28. ntnRN vasn-,csHELL,tL. From Assurht,

fifth year Of Amenhotep IH., in which the king is likened to a t'usrrye linn
that seizes the Kusbitcs in his claws. A 51312 also, of the second year of
Ramses the Great, shows on the left Amman and on the right Khnum
presenting the snopesn " sword nf victory to the king, who grnsps a negro
by the hair. Many other ancient r iefs imd inscriptions will be found by
the careful seeker, bath Mrrng this road and beside, the Nile in the dimer
tioss of and beside Assarrn.t

By-and-by we perceive considerable fragments of a high Brick
Wall, built to protect the road front the attacks of the Blemmyes
o. 302) and also perhaps from the shifting sand. Straho, curiously
enough, does not mention It. It first appears to the right (W.) ofthe
road, crossesittwice, remains then 011theE.sitle,and ends on theilat
bank opposite Philze. It is 6 ft. broad, and at some places 13 ft, high.

As this curious erection is almost entirely destroyed or eovererl
with sand in the neighbourhood of Assuén, and as there are also
other points of interest on the Iancl-route to Philm (the inscriptions
are most numerous near the island], no one who has a reasonable
time to devote to the region of the first cataract, should fail to
traverse this route once at least. The siew ofPbilre, as the traveller
approaches the end of his journey, will never be forgotten.

 

c. Route partly through the Desert, partly beside the Cataract.

This route is recommended to those who have arrived by steamer
and have time to go to Phila, and hack mire only. The return to
Assuin is usually made (when there is moonlight invariably) after
sunset, in which case, however, the traveller follows the desert-
route all the Way and sees nothing ot'tho cataract. The rocky nature
of the river-bank renders it impossible to shirt the stream during
the ilrst half of the Iliitance from Assuén to Philas. After visiting
the quarries, thvrnfnro, we follow the above-described desert-route
for about 1/3 hr. towards the Fr, then enter a path diverging to the
right fw.1, which brings us in about an hour after quitting As-
suin to the rocky bank of the river, whose hoarse roar is heard far
some time before, Hence me are conducted to the rocks known
as the Bibém esh-0e11it1, OT 'gates of the cataracts', that with the
largest fall being known as Btd, el-Kebfr 01' 'great gate'. Here we
may be fortunate enough to she n boat guided through the rapids;
but in any rate there am always naked young Nubianr ready to
plunge into the river nml allow theruselves to be carried down by
the foaming stream, either ammo of h tree-trunk or tloating Itll-
supported in the water, in the mnnnPl’ described long ago by Stcakro.
The air of Course remumls with shouts and requests for bakshish.
Those who expect to see [b casearle like the falls of the Rhine at
vSiyhat1hausert will be disappointed. The foaming and impetuous
stream makes noise enough as it dashes through its rocky bed, but
there is nothing here in the shape of a regular waterfall. Yet all
