S.) by a smaller side-room, while at the bank several steps lead into
a third room, the Celia. The four clastered columns which support
the ceiling of the main chamber recall the proto-Doris t-oiumns of
Renihnsan (p.12). A stone bench runs round the walls. On the
W. wall is Anuke suckling the infant K g Horus, with the words:
'l am thy mother, I give thee milk, it brings to thee peaceful life,
youth for thy limbs and strength for thy arms.‘ Beside her stands
the ram’s-headed Khnum, lord of the fresh water in Tumb. 0n the
2i.wirll (left) King Horus appears before the 'tbis-headed 'J'hoth and
four different forms of the god Horus, viz. " lord of Min, of Be-
heni, of Eek, and of Maha - all names of places in Nubie. Over
the door into the left side-chamber is the cmtouche of the king,
'beloved ot' Ammon-Ra and of Thoth', On the N. wall the king is
led by the hand by Seth, with the ass's head anti the god Horus,
with the symbol of life. Some of the pictures are now scarcely re-
cognizable. 0n the W. wall, to the right of the entrance, is the
king before Thoth, who promises him strength, health, and victory.
The two side-rooms have neither pictures nor sculptures.

The Saracen fortress of Addeh (W. bank), sometimes called
Sh/Imui, is named Mushulcil by Champolliou. In the mountains to
the S. of it are some almost inaccessible steles and a rock-cave,
which is wider than it is deep. The cave belonged to the scribe
Pa-uar, prince of Rush and president of the S.1and=, fau-bearec at
the king's left hand. we-thirds of it are occupied by a broken
seated ti,eare of a god. 0n the inner side of the entrance is the
kneeling figure of Padmr before Anuke, mistress ot Amonhari.
On the walls we see one of the sun-worshipping kings (p. 23), viz.

On the rocky slope to the right of the entrance to the grotto is
a proskynema dedicated to the gods of the district, by Kara, son
of a Tutmes.

The hill of Shatani is the last spur on the E. bank of the range
ofhilis running close to the Nile from Ihrim, and presenting some
curious pyramidal formations. At this point the chain bends east-
wards towards the desert. On the W. bank, however, the river is
still skirted by hills for a short distance farther. On this bank lies
Farm, probably the Pldhuris of Pliny, round which are numerous
