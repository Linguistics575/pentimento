railway and the villa of )Iahmi‘id Bey, and then passes the tomb of
a shékh, where a draught of good water is offered to the traveller
by a dCrvish. A number of dry ditches must be crossed, and also
several canals, where the traveller on horseback will hardly escape
from wetting his feet when the water is high; if he rides on a
donkey, he should get the Arabs to carry him and his saddle across.
The fields which We pass are remarkably well eultivated, and the
eye rests with pleasure on trees of various kinds, including fine
olives in the gardens, with hedges of cactus. The vegetation is most
luxuriant in the neighbourhood of Fidmtn, a village pieturcsqaely
situated on a slope, but inhabited by a thievisl1 population. The
Ruhr ( Ttrlisrseh L‘mill river'), one of the broader canals, must be
rtossed here. Beyond this point the country is, at places, green and
well irrigated, and at others dry and sterile. One part of the route,
which is tlankcd bylusuriant gardens of olives, pomegranates, and
Jigs, is very muddy. After a ride of fully three hours we reach the
inch: and the bridge Nmilir Ijasan. The large body of Water of
the canal. which is conducted from the Bah: Trisuf, here falls into
a channel, which, with many ramifications, conveys it to the tields
of Sputhrir.

The large village of tituthi'ur (rail. station, see p. 4'2) lies on the
border of the second plateau of the province. Those who visit Ha-
wirah (p. 38) reach the first plateau, while the second. is crossed on
the way to Senhl‘ir; the third lies at our feet when looking down on
the Birket el-t0rCul from the great Kain, i.c. the rain-strewn hill
to the N. of the village. The handsome house of the Shékh ei-
Beled offers good accommodation, and even quarters for the night.
The. traveller should make a bargain here for a boat with the shékh
ot' the fishermen. About 30 fr. fer the day, and a bahshish for the
rowers (id whom ()-8 are necessary for speed), are demanded.

Fenhir stands on the site of an ancient, and not unimportant,
town, of which large heaps of wins still remain. toman walls are
traceable in many places. A large building has recently been ex-
eavated by the peasants for the sake of obtaining the hard bricks
of which it is built, but part of it has already been removed. No
remains of columns or inscriptions have been met with.

From Serrhrhr to the Birket el-Ruvrht takes about Ws: hr. The route
leads mrmigh sugar-plantations. We reach the lake nm- the peninsula
knnwn as eer'ezireh, on which stands a heap of ruins. A shurt distance
to tlee w, are the scanty remuins uf el-llanvrwrrr. The traveller, after
having ridden to We lake, should nut forget to order bis horses, Which
return to swim, to await him for the return-jnurney at the spot where

he has quilted them. or in order them tn meet him in good time on the
bank of the lake hy Nezleh (see 11. AZ).

The Birket eI-Kunm Clake oi the horns') owes its name to
its shape, which resembles that of slightly bent eows'horns. It
measures M M. in length, and, at its broadest part, is about 61/e M.
wide. It is situated on the same level as the Mediterranean, and
its depth averages 13 ft. The greenish water is slightly brarkish
