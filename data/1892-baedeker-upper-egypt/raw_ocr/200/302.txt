has given its name to the place, To the left are the remains of
other rooms, The name of Ramses IL, inserted by himself as a
correction, should be noticed; behind axe offerings for the dead. The
line roof is not a true vault, the stones lying horizontally and being
but out. The colours are fresh; to the right and left of the door
are Tutmes HL and Tutmes IL; Over the door 4 bulls. _ Asouu1-
ing " steps further we reach another granite doorway also built
by Tutmeslll,, through which we enter avsult sprinkled with stars.
This last rests against the wall of rock which rises above Dir el-
bahri, without being cut into it. A second archway with 2. side-
niches leads deeper into the mountain, and there is a thirdur1vaultad
room which was constructed under Tutmes L of the 18th Dynasty,
but appropriated by a distinguished omcial named Amenhotep,
under Ptolemy Eucrgetes 11., and his wife C)leopatra. The iuscrip-
tions of this later period compare very disadvantageously with
those of the time of the I'uttuas kings,

1"rom the N. side of the tllild terrace it is possible to Creep into the
Burittt Chapel, hulrtilled with rubbish, which is supported by 12 eigl1ttsers-
sided columns in four rows, and contains two empty sarcophagusmhests.
On the inner wall are Anubis and offerings for the dead. This is fulluwed
by & vaulted Cliambsr the arch uf Which is pointed, and frum this a simi-
larly vaulted Passage rims " at a right angle, to the W. of which is iy
very small Roam, also vaulted in the same Way, We thus 'iad three vaulted
rooms, each smaller then the preceding. in front or this arrangement of
tumbs there was a building of which there now remains [on the right
as we leave the tombs) a Faltmnttda With 7 eigh:eeu-sided eulnnms, bears
ing att arehidave, the astragal, and the concave eom e. These rooms are
much ehoked up, and full of fragments ofmummies, and linen i-ttgs. In
later times they were used as a Common burial ground. The same fate
from the 26th Dyh, onwards betel the rooms at the end of which is the
iiue picture of the Hathor Cow (p. 227); but these are now kept clean zuttl
easily accessible.

0n the tunith terrace also pictures of a procession have been pre-
served. Uf the row ofships nuihiug is left but the water-lines below them,
but it is from here that a picture of a ship how in the Berlin Museum
wits taken, with an accompanying inssriptiuu telling us that the Pr'oct'ssion
Wits arranged by Tntmes III. in honour of Tutmes II.

At no great distance from iiei- ei-bhhri there is at roughly worked
passage cut, tinly about 3ft. high and scarcely accessible, whieh was ex-

with semihierrttic inscriptions, in Which was buried ll priueess named
