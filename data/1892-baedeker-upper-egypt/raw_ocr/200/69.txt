Khnumhutep appears in a litter, inspecting Iris putters and carpen-
ters. Some of the latter are felling palm-trees and others are build-
ing a boat for the journey to Abydos [see below). The most inter-
esting of the scenes of artizan life in the lower rows are the
representations of women baking and weaving, under the supervision
of eununhs. - The entire Rear Wall is occupied by a tastefully
arranged representation at the water-sports in Which the deceased
took delight. A forest at papyrus reeds grows by the water-side,
thinkly peopled by all kinds of furred and feathered game. To the
right and left Khnumhotep is depicted in his boat, aneumpanied in
one instance by his Wife Khuti. who is painted a lighter colour.
Here he t:ansfixes large river-tish there he holds the birds he has
hmnght down by his darts. Above are birds caught in a net. In the
river swim 1rlroraeteristira1ly drawn fish, and crocodiles am] hippo-
patami are also seen, A man who has fallen into the Water is being
hauled out again. The dominant idea of the chase is farther curried
out in the representations of a hawk seizing a gaily-plumaged bird
anti an ibis capturing a buttertly.

The N. Wall (to the left on entering) is the most important of
all, as upon it is the celebrated picture of a Semitic race bringing
cosmetics (mcstem) and other presents to JGnumhotep. In the
lowest row. to the right, are seen the secretaries of Khnumhatep,
reneiving the report of the steward of the cattle, who is followed by
the herds and shepherds. Just above this is Khnumhotep himself.
represented an a scale three times as large as the other iigares and
ivtornpauied by three dogs and a man with sandals, bearing a staff.
In the .1th row from below, on a level with the bead and shoulders
of this huge ''1gure, is represented a curious procession, Neferhotep,
the secretary, and another Egyptian lead towards the gavemor a
number of foreign people in gay-ealoured garments, whose sharply
cut features, booked noses, and pointed beards 1onrnistakeably pro-
elaim their Semitic nationality. This Asiatic visit seems to have
been one of the signal events in the life of the nomarch. Neferhotep
hands his master a donument from which we learn that the strangers
knoeked at the door of Egypt in the 9th year of king Usertesen IL
Prime Absha, the leader of the foreigners, leads a gazelle and bows
to the ground. The next Asiatic leads an antelope. Four armed wen
marsh in front of the harem, which consists of four women and three
children. Two of these ride upon an ass, which also bears imple-
ments for weaving. The women wear brightly coloured niment of
a curious eut. The clothes and loin-cloths of the men are also
brilliantly coloured. A heavily-laden ass is followed by a lute-
player and a warrior armed with club, bow, and quiver. The in-
scription, beginning 'ahave the figure of the secretary Neierhotep,
is as follows: 'Arrival of those bringing the eru-salve mestem [kohl
or antimhny), He (Le. Neferhotep)introduces 37Amus'. TheAmus
