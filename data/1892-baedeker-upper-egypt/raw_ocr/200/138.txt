82 Route 7. DENDERAH. Humor

those in the tombs of the ancient kingdom or with those peculiar
to the times of a Seti or a Tutmes; but we cannot refuse our ad-
miration even to these products of later Egyptian art. Here and
there (as in several chambers of the upper story) we meet sped-
mens of hasty and poor workmanship; but as a rule the sculpture
of Denderah is pleasing and harmonious in style and executed with
a care that does not overlook the smallest detail. The eye is uni-
Formiy pleased by the harmony of the whole with its details and by
the great variety of composition which manifests itself in spite of
the prescribed form to Which the artist was confined.

Neither the general amhitcutnml scheme of the temple as a whole
nor the style of the details shows any essential variation from those
that may be traced in the eaxlior Egyptian temples. The iirst
apartment, here as elsewhere, is a handsome Hypnslyle Hall (P1. E),
open in front, with 24 massive columns supporting the roof (comp,
p. OJ). Next follows a mom with six columns (PL v), with three
apartments to the left (XVIII, xxx, xx) and three to the right
(xxx, XXII, xxm), from the last of which (xxm) a passage leads
to the featnl chambers beside Hall B. The next room (Pl. O,
with no columns, has apartments NVI and EVII on the left. A
fourth hail (Pr. B), adjoined on the left by a single apartment
(str) and on the right by the smite of three festal chambers (mi,
XIV, xv), leads to the Atlytum (PL A), a long narrow room in
which the sacred boats were kept. From the passage (Pl. a.) which
encircles the latter, entrances lead into eleten side-chi/rs, (left
IF, v, TT, VII, In, Ir, right Wu, Is, XI, x), which are grouped
round the main chamber (Pl. I) behind room A. There are also a
number of secret passages (crypts), constructed in the hollow wall
of the temple on the E., W., and S, so " These passages, which
are difficult of access, are in three stories, one ahoie another (Comp.
p. OO). Finally from the central hall 0, doors lead on the right
and left to the two stairs which ascend to the roof of the temple
(comp. pp. 91, 97).

The Egyptians had special names for each hallami side-chamber,
for each corridor aml staircase, for each door and window, in fact
for each part, great orsmau, of the more or less complicated temples.
In not a few cases these names explain the use of the different
rooms; but tho only certain information as to the special natum of
the various apartments is obtained [mm the Inscriptions, which
axe arranged as a kind of ornamental border above and below the
paintings on the wall, much like the borders seen sometimes on old-
fashioned wall-papers. 'lâ€˜hesc inscriytious, which are of the greatest
importance both for the history of architecture and for the explana-
tion of the tempie-cult, usually have their contents arranged in the
same order. The name of the king, with all his titles and ofiieial
epithets, is lirst mentioned, followed by the statement that be built,
repaired, completed, or adorned such and such a room, or such and
