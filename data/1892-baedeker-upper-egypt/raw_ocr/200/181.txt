in Itltl0, a small mnpte with the name at hing I'wmmutnis, or the
‘10th T)yn., was discovered at the S.W. corner at the pylon to
the right.

The *First Main Pylon (PL I) is of enormous size. It is still
121 ytis. wide, with walls tb' ft. thirk and 1121/2“. high. This
gigantic portal, which probably dates from the Ptolemies, although
no record of the fact is known, is destitute of iusrriptions. Possibly
it " t covered with sturm arul adurned with paintings, as its tiere-
ration with reliefs would have demanded enormous toil and titne.
No one shuuid omit to make the *Ascent of this Pylon. This may
be done mnst easily, and without any danger or special difiieulty,

even those wlro are subject to giddiness need not fear to trust them-

ruins from th point of vantage, it is useful and interesting to seek
to identify, with the aid of the accompanying plan, the various col-
umns, rheli is, and pillars which at first present themselves in
apparently inextricabie confusion. This is comparatively easy as
regards the nearer (ICI portion of the temple; but the more distant
portions, from among which obelisks tower, are partly out of sight,
and are partly so foreshorteriel by dimmre, that they appear to
form one confusuul system of ruins. The view by moonlight is in-
'lescrihably line. 'mt on the whole the result is a general though
inefraeeable impression, rather than a clear idea of the arrangement
or the various pans of the huihting. The latter is only to he obtained
by wandering, plan in hand, through the ruins. It must, however,
never he forgotten that the temple of Knrnnk, so far from having
one single uniform plan, grew up gradually, and that many of its
parts owe their character nut to any artistic cnlrulation, but to
such accidental considerations As the space at the tlisposal of the
