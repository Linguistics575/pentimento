those represented here come other gods 'who have already found
admission'. Below all is Tum, the coiiquewr of the foes, who lie
bound on the ground before him. Again we see the boat, the heniu,
and the men or people of the lower world; also the members of the
household of Ra, to which belong (1) nine apes which sing when Ra

who praise Ra on the ninth of the month, (d) twelve women who
do homage to Re, when he enters the Atur names, or Ocean. The
roof contains astrological tigures, lists of deceni, constellations and
