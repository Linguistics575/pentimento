mentioned figures have been supposed to he Caster and Pollux, or two
Rnuutn emperors, but they rather resemble hnrseshrnught as tribute, like
the groups in the pediment of the. Stale of Piankhi. Farther to the S.
is a colossal image, carved out of the rock, of Ramses IIL saerificiug to
the god Sebeki The inscriptions in the very ancient group of tom'he to
the S. are in such bad preservation that their date can only be guessed
at frum their general style.

Minyeh Ciuinyet-ibn-keaetb; rail. stat., p. 1), on the W. bank,
a well-built and handsome town with 15,900 inhab, is the seat of
the mudir of a district containing 281 villages and 3151000 inhahi-
tttuts. There is a te1egraph-oftioe at the milmtststiort, and adja-
cent is the post-office, the director of which speaks Italian. At the
hospital is a physician who has studied in Europe. The town pos-
sesses two hotels and a large and curiously painted Arab oafé, in
which ghawézi sing in the evening. Parts of the street running
along the river are planted with trees, and in the stream many
steamers and dhahabfyehs lie at anchor. The bazaars and the
Greek bakkals' [small dealers) possess large stocks of goods. In the
Bazaar street is an Austrian watchmaker and elothier, and among
the houses on the, river is an Italian tailor. The palace of the mudir
is a plain and lightly-built sttucture. The large sugar-faetory is
the oldest in Egypt, and e visit to it during the sugar-l-st is of
great interest; most of the ofMials are French and yery obligiug.
Market-day in Minyeh presents a very gay and characteristic picture
of Oriental life. There are no public buildings or monuments of
any interest, but the houses of the richer merchant, in spite of their
plain estevior, are often ilttec1 up with great comfort. A glance
into one of their courts will show what a rich and varied life exists
in the interior of houses which from the outside look like miser-
able huts.

It is uncertain what place or the l’hztraohs’ time Miuych represents;
but the assertion M cht Atricunus that it was founded hy the Arabs may
well be doubted. Among the facts which render it improbable are the
old masonry on the river(t0wurds the so, the ancient architectural frag-
ments isumured in one of the mosques, a Captic inscription, and the very
mime uf the town, which is derived, not from the Arabic, bat from the
old-Egyptiau dialect. Its Cnptic mine is .uoonn (Mame) and this, as
Brugsch has demonstrated, is derived from the (yld-Egyptian Menu-t. This
mime, however (in full Mena-t Krtufu, 'nurse of Chenps‘), belonged to a
place which lay nearly opposite to the present minych, [In a site still
marked by a few remains. At a later date Menart was probuhly [rank
ferrcd, under the name of Minyeh, from the right bank of the Nile to the
left, where, presumably, some of the inhabitants had previously settled.
