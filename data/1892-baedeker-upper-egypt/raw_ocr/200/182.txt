The building is at once a temple of the gods and a temple of fame;
dedicated 'i toute< les gloires' of the empire of the Pharaohs. it was
compelled to receive additions, often in most unsuitable places,
whenever it was the will of the king to recognize the favours of
Autumn by new buildings which should record for posterity what
the god had done for him, and through him for Egypt.

Before we enter the pcristyle court, an inscription On the door ofthe
pylon. to our right as we enter, merits notice. luis was placed here by
the savants who accompanied the army ofNapoleon to Egypt, and records
the latitude and longitude of the chief temples 0f the Pharaohs, as cal-
rnmted by them.

This monument of unliring and successful diligence deserves to he
greeted With respect; it contrasts with the exeerable taste of the idle
tourists who have scribbled nm- and dotaced inscriptions Within the
temple, with their uwn insignificant names Opposite the French tahle

b. The Great Peristyle Court; and its Additions.

The great *Peristyle Court (Pt. A) is believed by important
authorities to have been built by the rulers ofthe 20nd Dynastyt
The oldest part of the temple is the sanctuary (p. 134), situated
much farther to the E. Probably the clearest view of the growth
and historical development of the great house of Amman would he
obtained by beginning there and thence visiting the later portions
in the order of their erection; but in follawing out this plan we
should be obliged to diverge irregularlyhither and thither from the
rmin lines, and so would miss much of the eireet designed by the
tmilders. The influence of the god w upposed to radiate from
within outwards; while the proeession ofh < 'ulnrers advanced slowly
towards Amman from without inwards. The sanctuary was the final,
unapproarhable goal of the pious, few of whom were permitted to
penetrate farther than the pe style court. The hypostyle hall w s
indeed open to certain privileged worshippers, but only the 'initi-
ated' were allowed to approach any nearer to the holy of holie< That
sacred chamber itself might only be entered by the high-pri and
the king, the representative of the god upon earth. The arrange-
ment of the peristyre and succeeding chambers indicate in the
clearest manner the nature " the services celebrated within them
