is rendered difficult by the accumulations of sand. The first room
contained six large and six small pillars, the former being meant
to support the central beams. The following narrow room is at!-
joined by two side-eharnbers and three other chambers in the
taek-wall. In this room appears Ramses II. worshipping and pre-
senting orerings to various deities. Under a canopy are four gods.
The foremost is Ptah, bare-headed and in his usual mumrny-iorrn,

with 1 oo- and _ He is named the Ptah of King Ramses in Pa-

nman. Then, as at Dakkeh, follows the seated figure ofa second
Ptah, wearing as e headdress the bull's horns with two feathers

between them j) This Ptah is described as 'lofty with the two

feathers and the horns'. Nest is a female figure with the moon-dise
at-tuti), and finally comes Hathor, goddess of the southern
,eamore tree), with horns turned upwards enclosing two
feathers and the sun- e. The colouring of the sacciticial scenes in
the side-chambers is well-preserved; and this is still more the case
in the adytum, the central of the three chambers atthetraek. Both
to the right and left in this room the king is represented sacrificing
before a richly adorned dhahabiyeh. The dhahabiyeh on the right has
thehawk"sl1eadofllavrmuNs as its emblem, that on the left, the ram‘s
head of I0nun1-Ra. Both stand on ornamented tables. On the left
the king is offering incense above an altar, Dn the right he is oiter-
ing flowers. A large fan is home beside him, and behind are stan-
dards with the heads of the two gods and of the king. - The cen-
tral picture exhibits I0num-Ra seated in a boat beneath a canopy,
with the kneeling king to the left and three eynocephali to the
right. Beneath is a recess, in which the outlines of three gods may
still be made out, although a tigure of St. Peter, with a halo und a
large key, has been painted over them. The king, who appears on
the right and left, with flowers, has now the appearance ofofrisr'u1g
them to the saint. Beneath is an inscription, running both to the
right and to the left and extending on to the side walls: ‘The living
IIor-Ra, the strong, the beloved of Ma, iord of the festivals, like his
father Ptah, king of both lands, Ramses the Great, he has made it
in memory of his father Ammon-Ra, king of the gods'.

  

 

 

 

Beyond Ccebri'ah the sreuery assumes a regularly desert character,
Which it retains nntil near Igorusho. Rocky isolated peaks rise on
the left. At Mulki the Nile makes a sudden bend, and beyond this
point the banks are once more cultivated, while dense palrtr-groves
appear on the left (E), with scattered huts and many silciyelrs.
