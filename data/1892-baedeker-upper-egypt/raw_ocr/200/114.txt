The:Second Hypostyle Room (P1. D) resembles the tint, but is
higher, deeper, and in all respects of more importance. Seti 1. tC-
gan it and his artists executed both the arehrteetural details and
the plastie adornment with the earefulness and purity of style that
marks all their work. The son has here left unchanged the name
ofthe father, which occurs at every point, Three rows of twelve
columns each support the arehitrave, on which rest the rooting
slabs, and are arranged in six groups, each ofsis columns. Be-
tween the groups acces. is alluded to the vaulted chambers in the
wall facing us as we enter. The f'tost two of the three rows of syol,
ums have papyms-hud napitals. Beyond the, second row the floor of
the temple is considerably raised, forming a platform from whieh
the vanrtcd chambers are cut0red. Upon this platform stands the
third row of columns, the nylindrieal shafts ot'wlsieh are entirely
destitute of capitals, but bear huge blocks of stone forming an aba-
cus for the support of the urchitmve. This peculiarity is simply ex-
plaincd by the fact that the columns in the third row are shorter
than the others, owing to their raised platform, so that the architect,
by omitting the capital, brings the abacus of all on the same level
and avoids the unpleasant cifert which dift'erent elevations of the
zm-hitrave would make on the eye. When proeessions of worshippers
tiled in and out, performing pious ceremonies, this hall must hem
presented a very imposing spertwlc. Jusrrriptios below the open-
ings leading from the first hall to the seeoml inform us they Sh ere
formerly filled with doors of bronze (asem) The inscriptions and
repoieseutirtittns on the walls and rolumns repeat themselves Nh emi-
somely and are oflittle general interest. Here We see the king IU'-
reiting from the gods such attributes of the royal dignity as the
crooked sword or the St'Olll‘gC and crank (symbols, perhaps, of the
royal duties ofineeutive 0n the (me side and restraint on the other);
there We behold him offering burnt-olferiiigs to a single god, l
triad, or a group of gods. If the king is receiving gifts, he is
generally represented on his knees; When he saoriliecs, he leans
slightly forward, holding the bucr1t-0ifreriug in tho left hand and
libatious in the right. Sometimes he is seated, receiving thebless-
ings of the gods; he appears thus in the fit1e pit'ture on the N,Walt
ot' the second room, With Isis, Amunti, and Nophthys in front, and
the goddess Ma and ltenpet behind. liis proiite is evidently efaith-
ful likeness and is everywhere portrayed with great artistic skill.
The unusual handsomeness of this king is still rer‘ognisahle in his
mummy at Gizch. The saerifu01 implements should also be noted.
Censexs like that in his hand have been found, but in bronze, while
his Were doubtless of gold. They are in the form of an arm, the
hand holding a small vessel from which the smoke of the incense
arises, The handle shows the eavcf11lly exeruted Sparrow bawk's
head of Horus, The libation vessel Was in the form ol' a golden lo-
tus flower, with small vases rising above the open corolla, from whirh
