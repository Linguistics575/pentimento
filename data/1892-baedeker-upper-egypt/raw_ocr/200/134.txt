chambers, and the fragments of a stairnase (to the right). This
building is dedicated to the birth of Horus, with whom the son of
each successive monarch is compared. Simiiar Birth-Houses (Egypt.
I:

fpa-mcs), called by Champollion Mameisi [Copt., 'place of

birth'), occur in many other Egyptian temples (pp. 253, 289, euro.
The mrtouches of Autokralor Kisses, Which Hathor presents to Ho-
rus Sam taui, have been supposed to refer to Augustus; but the
thet that the latter had no son makes this very doubtful. The 'birth-
house' also contains the names of Trajan and Hadrian, to whom it
probably owes its existence The paintings represent the care of
the youngHorus, who is nursed and ministered to by goddesses and
women with rows’ heads. - We now proceed to the temple, either
by asnending over the heaps of rubbish, or by returning to the N.
gate and walking thence in a straight direction.

"Temple of Hathor at Denderah.

This interesting and much-admired building was deriimted tn
IIalhor, the Egyptian Venus. The Portieo (PI. E), wlrieh is sup-
ported by 24 eolurnns, is 139 ft. in breadth. Each of the columns
has a capital formed of four heads or Iratluyr, with cows' ears,
surmounted by a house, in reference to the meaning of Hathor,
Hut (Le. house) afllarus. The I'oluums next the entranve show
an open door. The six columns in the front row, three on each
side of the entrance, are united by balnstrades. The mhhish round
the temple reaches to the haiustrades in front and nearly to the
roof on the E. side; hence the, floor of the temple appears sunken
mm is reached by a flight of wooden steps. 1)riginally, however,
the temple stood level with the ground, and its present Hlpear-
ance, like that of the temples of Esneh and Edfu, is due to the ac-
cumuiated rubbish of centuries. In acrordance with the plan of
other tmnples, a colonnade and a pylon should standin front ofthis
portirn; but perhaps the means to add these were not fortheomiug.
The date of the temple is given by ll, Greek inscription of three
lines, which mils round the cornice on the exterior of the building
and reads as follows:
