pouring water from two vases, lln the summit of the rocky source
of the waters are a vulture (Muth) and a hawk (Horus), gazing into
the distance and keeping watch. This is almost the only landscape

in red letters. in which Aurelius Anmniuus Pius and Lucius Verus are

Inscriptions; to the left Chr.) by Tiberius, to the right (rl.) by
Autokrator kicres (perhaps Augustus or even Tiberius again) The
most noteworthy is a List of Names, of great importance for the
geography of the ancient Egyptians (Vol. 1., p. 31). Un the W. wall
are the homes of Lower Egypt, on the E. wall, near the foot, those
of Upper Egypt. Other lists are found within the temple.

the sculptures which cover its walls, is found as follows. Returning
to the second room (Pl. t) of the pronaos we pass through the door
on its W. side (next the Nile), and immediately to the right see

we turn towards the S and f1nally descend some stone steps to a
doorway built over with Nile bricks. The 12stibule is interesting.
