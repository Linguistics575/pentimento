20 Route 1. Dim I?uN-NAhmLTrm. From Cairo

Those who are interested in Christian antiquities should follow
the E. bank from Shékh 'Ahiulch towards the SJ’ In about 55/41112,
after passing some ruins of a late epoch, we reach the Dér Aba
Hennis (Convent of St. John), called also simply ed-IW. Jn the
days of the Iramerttke persecutions the Christians are said to have
lived here and at Shékh 'Abirdeh in comparative security, as the
Arabs believed that no Mohammedan could exist here on account
of the evil spirits. At present there are more fullzthin here than
Copts. There is little to be seen at ed-OCT, The crypt, in which
divine service is lwhl, is said to date from the time of the fini-
press llelena. By ascending the hill at the back of the houses, we
mach, to the left of tho ravine, some cave-like qunrries, which
were fitted up " Christian chapels and Wore embellished at an early
date with sculptures. The main chamber contains paintings of saints
and scenes from the New Testament, bat those in one of the side
chapels (liaising of Lazarus, Wedding at Gena, etc.) are better.
To judge from their style these interesting pictures are not earlier
than the 6th cent. A.D, Among the Coptic monks who resided here
(from the 4th cent. onwards) Wore Victor and his brother Koluthus,
Silvanus, and hraearius; and the. tombs of the last two are still
shown. The adjoining quarry was begun hy Amenhotep m.

Alleluia; hi'. beyond Dér Abu Henniswe reach Der en-Nakhleh,
the ‘conveht of the date-palms'. To reach the *Taml/ with the Tir-
presentation of the transportation ofa Colossus, wo cross the dry
wateT-eottrr;e beyond the houses, ascend the hill on the left side,
and near the top reach a path on which, a little to the right, the
grave is situated. Guides may be procured for a few paras. Tray-
ellers descending the river should visit the tomb from L’ersheh,
above Which towers the rocky Gebel Shiloh Sand (with a shekh’s
tomb), in Which the tomb in question is hollowed out. The whole,
district belonged to the name of Un or fresrnopolis. The Whpresen-
tation in this tomb is highly interesting as being the only one that
gives us an idea of the processes used by the Egyptians in moving
their e0l0ssa1 statues.

The Arahs thought. it impossible that were human strength could
move such huge burdens, and hence a legend grew I11) among them that
[he subjects of the Pharaohs were L auts, who know how to move, masses
of rock with their magical staves. Even the men of the present day, at
whose command stand forces nf " ich the, ancient Eryptians never even
dreamed, are astounded at their achievements in Chi; direction and ichl
inclined m solve (he pruhlem by ascrihing in them the use of technical
aids, which we have no evidence that they possessed. The principles of
