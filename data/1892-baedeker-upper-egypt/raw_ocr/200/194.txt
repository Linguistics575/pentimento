being then completed by the Pelusiac arm of the Nile. The canal,
frequently suffered to fall into disuse, was restored by chho (7th
cent. BA).) and at a later period by Darius L Communication
between the Nile and the Red Sea was maintained even under the
Arabs, but it was afterwards interrupted, and not restored until the
construction of the present fresh-water canal by Lesseps. The
bastions which defended it are those that compelled the Jews during
the Exodus to change their N.E, route at Ethan) cr Etam, Le.
the fortified places (khetem), and to turn towards the Red Sea on
the S. The relief, which is gradually becoming more and more
indistinct, deserves careful study. The conqueror of the Semites,
who is here joyfully welcomed as he approaches in his chariot, is
the ancestor of the Pharaoh of the Bible narrative who perished in
the Red Sea.

The victorious monarch next appears, after his arrival at Thebes.
As in the upper representation, he conducts to Amman two rows of
rebellious Asiatic princes, captured in the land of the Retemtu, and
presents to the god magnificent vessels.

We have now returned to the door by which we left the hypo-
style hall. It is adorned with the name of Ramses the Great.
To the right and left are two colossal companion reliefs, in which
Amman is represented holding several rows of captives by cords, and
presenting the weapons of victory to King Seti, who raises his sword
against a band of foes whom he holds by the hair. The name-rings
on both sides refer to the conquered tribes The legend on the relief
to the left is noteworthy: â€˜He smites the great ones of the Arum
Mentau (with the symbols of the shepherds), all the remote regions,
all lands, the Fenckhu (Phoenician) of the sea-region, the Sati,
the great circle of the green ocean' fi.e. the Mediterranean Sea).

We turn next to thereprcsentatiou on the RIGHT two Sum of the
door. To the extreme right, at the corner of Pylon IL, above, we
see the storming of Katesh in the land of Amara (tho Amorites].
This is the fortress which offered such serious resistance to the army
of Tutmes III., and it was the greatest obstacle to the victorious
progress of the Egyptian army in the wars of Scti and bis son
{amses. The scene is depicted with great rividness. The Aramaic
foes of the king (the Kheta) appear both on foot and in chariots;
and Seti overcomes his foes Eglsting also on foot and in his chariot.
The fees, who wear curious peaked hoods, flee in wild confusion
The Egyptian artist here shows some appreciation of landscape
Mteets. A forest region is represented, though somewhat crudely,
with six diiferimt kinds of trees and shrubs. A herd of cattle be-
longing to the Kheta, terrified by the approach of the king, fly from
their pasture, accompanied by the herdsmen, who toss their arms
in despair. Katesh is taken, and the defenders are thrown from
the Walls. This is the only relief that has teen preserved in the
upper row.
