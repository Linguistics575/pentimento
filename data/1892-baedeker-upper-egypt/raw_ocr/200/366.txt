284 Route 99. PHILIE Temple

who lives with his ahildren and grandchildren on Bigeh, willingly
assists travellers. The view of Phila, from the n'vec-bavk is un-
expectedly beautiful, especially to those who have just quitted the
rugged rowks of the cataract or the arid desert; while, on the other
hand, the views from the island. especially from its rocky S. end,
are imposing and sometimes peculiarly wild.

The buildings on the island which demand a visit ale: 1. The
'Temple of Isis; 2. The Chapel of Hathot'; 3. The Ruins and the
Portal of Diacletizm, in the N.Wr, and i. The *Kiosque. -- Bigeh
and the Cataract Islands also repay a visit.

The Temple of Isis.

This beautiful strurture dates from various periods, and its
different parts show an almost eaprieious irregularity in their va
sitions with reference to each other. The traveller is recommended
to visit the Tarious portions in the following order, hut he is warned
against lingering too long over any of them, if his time be limited
or if his inspection have no special scie11tifi0 aim. It is better t0
obtain a good general impression from the whole, than to examine
the details minutely. In order to understand the arrangement of
the temple, it must not be forgotten that it was preliminently a
pilgrim-resort. The processions of pilgrims, whether they ap-
proached from Egypt or from Nubia, were compelled to steer for
the S. end of the island, for the rocks to the N. of it prevented
anything like a ceremonial approach, The portals of the temple
therefore faced the S., and the t'estal boats disiymbarlred their pas-
sengers on the S. coast. We likewise begin our visit from the S,.
or more exactly from the extreme S.W., to which we proceed
direct from the landing-place. Our attention is tipst attlacted by
the strong erection of hewn stones facing the stream. The steps of
a Stone Staircase within the quay-Wall are still to be seen on the
SW. coast; and there was another staircase on the S. eoast, to the
E. of the building of Nectanehus.

a. The Building of Nectunebus (Pl. A). Two Obelisks flanked
the entrance to the hypaethral Fore-Court, Which the pilgrim entered
first, and Where he Wat received, and perhaps also examined and
taxed. With the exception of the central portion of the tipst pylon
Cw 287), dating from this same king, Nectanehus IL, this is the
oldest part of the whole temple. The obelisks, made of sandstone,
instead of the mual granite, were "nall and stood up0n.stone chests,
The w. obelisk is still standing, but the E. obelisk is represented
by its chest merely.

The E. Uhclisk itself was found prostrate by Baukes in 1815, and at
bis request removed to Alexandria by Belzoni, despite the protests of
Drovetti who regarded it a, bis private property. From Alexandria it
was taken to England, Where it now stands at Kingston Halt in Dorset-
Shine On the lowest part of the pedestal is a long Greek inseriptiou
containing a petition addressed by the priests of Isis to King Eaergetes IL
