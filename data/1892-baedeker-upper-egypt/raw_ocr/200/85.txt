cemetery. On the way, espevially in the foreman, we often meet
funeral proeessiorvs, resembling, with their wailing “omen and
water-distributors, those of Cairo7 but producing a much more
solemn efrect through the absence of the bustle of the crowded
streets and the presence of the deserted city of the dead. Nowhere,
not even in Cairo, are the funeral songs so strange and weird as
here, or sun: by such deep and tuneful voice .

At the foot of the hill we dismount and fallow the good path
which leads to the mast interesting tombs. A tomb below, uearthe
Arab cemetery, is unimportant. Mighty grandees ot' the ancient
empire, who tilled the highest "wular and eeelesiastieal ofiioes,
hesred hugevaults in the racks here for the reception oftheir mum»
mies. t)ther tombs, smaller and less elaborately derorateti, belong
to simple burghcrs of a later period; and there are also holes in the
rock for mummies of the jackal, which was sacred to Anubis Aphem,
the local deity of Assirit. It is this animal that the Greeks in this
instance wrongly called Lykos " wolf [whence Lyropolis), but a
few genuirrewolf-boes have also been discovered here. Mumruitied
dogs, kittens, and birds of prey have been found, wrapped in linen
hands aud sometimes adorned with gilding. Those who do not oh-
ject to creep into some of the dusty and ill-smeiling holes will still
easily find fragments of sacred animals. The jarkal, along with the
trrreus-su1alce, frauated proudly on the standard ofthis Home, the
chief town of which was the capital of the Whole of Upper Egypt in
the time of the ancient empire.

The, path, wlrish is well-made though somewhat steep, leads us
tirstto .1 large rm-k-hall, the ceiling of which is roughly hewu iu
the form of a 1ault and still bears traces of blue stars painted on a
yellow ground. Sadly defaced inscriptions, in the style of the an-
cient empire, cover the walls. The hieroglyphics on the door are half
obliterated, but enough Icmaius to shew that this was the grave of
I/up-ide/h, sou oIDame At M, a higls-priest, and governor ofri.Egypt.
The Arabs call it [stubl ’ilnlar, or the stable of Autar, a hero of
