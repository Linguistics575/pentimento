xx til LE JOURNEY.

The chartering of a private dhalmhiych is much cheaper though
much more troubl me. The tint step is to engage a Drayaman,
not without a careful enquiry as to his record at the consulate and
from the hotel-keepers, and an examination of the testimonials from
previous travellers. There are about 90 dragomans in Cairo, all
more Or less intelligent and able, but scarcely a half of the number
are trustworthy. Most of them speak English or French, and a. few
speak Italian.

The following are well spukea of: JItrsstta Syeke, Ahmed Ramadan,
Ibrahim Salem, Arrrred Abdu'raln'm (owner of the Manhattan, 1cxix), Hamm
Btbars, Sal“?! Sudjar. Bisha'r Awad, Abdullah Abdelkhalik [all these Irgyp-
iians); Saleh (n Nubian]; Michael Gall, Antors8apie (Maltese); Illmuvlr,
Lewis Mmmzr, Dneybis Fadiir, Ezra: Telhully, and Elias Abusheya tsyriaas).
It cannot be too strongly impressed upon the traveller that it is essential
for him to show tram the very beginning that he is and intends to re-
main the master. Even the host dragomans are inclined to petronize their
clients, a tendency which mast at once be quashed.

The next step is to select a suitable dhahahiyeh assisted hy the
ilragoruau. A contract is then made with the dragoimm, either eu-
trusting him with the entire preparations, or assigning tohim only
the duty of engaging and payingthe re'is and crew, while the trav-
eller retains the cousruissariat department in his own hands. The
rifis OT Steetsmau is a most important fnuctionary upon whose slsilt
(luring the often stormy pi1sslvg0 the safety of the vessel depends.
The crew number from S to I'?, according to the size of the Illiahrw
biyeh. The vessel is either hired by the day (for 21mm 5-U., 3
or 4 pers (i-TI.) or chartered for the whole return-voyage toAssuiu
(for 2 pers. 300-3501., 3 or 4 pets. 350-'i00l0. 1n the former case
the dragoman will try to travel as slowly as pas ible to protract his
engagement; in the latter case he will press on, so as to save
boat-hire and bond. The latter arrangement is ptefoi‘ablo, but the
right of halting for J5-20 days in the course of the journey should
carefully he stipulated for. The dragoman must also provide tlon-
keys and I'amrls for the excursions Farther details are indicated
in the following ihart-eontraets, in which it is believed that nothing
of importance has been overlooked, The contract must be signed at
the traveller's consulate, either with the dragomau alone if he has
undertaken the whole of the arrangements, or with the dragoman
and sisis, when the traveller hashired the dhahahiyeh aurlpayshoartl
