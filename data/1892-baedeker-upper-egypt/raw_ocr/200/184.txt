We may mention here in antieipatiun that the roofofthe forlow-
ing hypostyle hall was supported by a perfect forest orpapyrus-burl
columns, through the midst of which a broad passage was marked
by ealyx-eolumtrs, closely resembling the detached pairsoreoltuurrs
in the tirst court (comp. p. 126). At this point we first obtain a
clear idea of the arrangement of this portion of the temple, and the
same remark applies also to all the rooms between it and the saue-
tuary. It should also he remembered that the number of those
privileged to follow null behold the procession gradually decreased

the king or chief priest, the crowd opr s, hearing the standards,

first pylon into the peristyle court. The double mw of ealys-
capitals served at unee to indicate their passage and to mark the
limits beyond which the pious spectators must not press. The
sacred procession rolled on slowly beneath the shade of the relarium
and entered the lsypostyle hatl through the second Pylon. Many of
those who were permitted to enter the first court had there to quit
the procession and to take up their positions to the right and left
of the calyx-columns. Others again were not permitted to advance
farther than the hypostyle, and so with each room until the sanc‘

may be traced, and it will be observed that at each successive stage
the place appointed for those who had to quit the procession is
smaller than the preceding

This building, which has only recently been made partly accessible,
is built of grey sandstone, except beside the three doors, where a
riyldish quartzose sandstone has been used. The tigure of the god
Seth has everywhere been erased from the name ofthe builder. Only
a small portion of the walls is entirely sculptured; and the INV'
