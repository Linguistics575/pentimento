the island ot‘Kenisub, at the beginning ofthe rapids, or more safely
on land by donkey or the quicker and 1mm: agreeable camel. Tra-
vellers by land must cross to the opposite bank. The British com-
mandant will on request himlly telephone to the fort opposite to
have the new ary camels in readiness; but donkeys must be taken
from the E. bank. The route at Mst skirts the stream, p " the
ttbove-rrreutioued temple of Horus of Beheni, then Llltlie inland
towards the mountain ridge, finally ascending with considerable
steepness to a plateau, where the donkeys 0r camels are left. The
summit uf the hill is reached on foot in about 5 min. more after a
somewhat steep climb. A rock on the stop bears the xmmes of some
famous travellers, including that of (Jharupolliou, The view of the
broken cataract, which extends for 5 M., is very interesting, The
stream here forces its way through fen'eous sandstone, not through
granite as at Assuin. The boulders at the foot of the rock are
coated with dark feneous Nile mud. The view southwards to the
blue hills of New Dongolah is not less attractive, and kimllos the
desire to visit Upper Nubia, which contains numerous most inter-.
esting antiquities between this point and Elsarttlm. We think of
the temples of Soleb and Sesebi, the temples and pyramids of Gebel
Bmkal, the fifteen pyramids of NW, Jlemé with its group of py-
ramids, and the temples of Naguhaml el-Jleeaurdl. All these, how-
ever, are at present forbidden regions for the tourist. At most he
may visit the ancient fortresses of Semneh and Kummeh, situated
in the Batu el-{Iayer (belly of stones), 37 M. from Widi Halt‘ah.
These contain buildings of the 12th Dyn. and the remains of two
temples built by Tutmes 111.; and they are interesting also for the
records of the height of the Nile under the 12th Dyn.. which show
that 2600 years before Christ the Nile rose about 25ft. higher than
it does to-day.

To visit these spots we take the railway to (23 MO Siyaja (2 hrs‘;
see p. Mi), thence proceed by donke to (12 MO Sm'ras and W) M.) Kum-
melt. Semmh, 0n the upposite bank, is reached by boat or by (me of the
native rafts made of palm-logs. The expedition from " [mm and
back takes 2-8 days. Permission {rum the military authorities is 11eces-
sary, ami is somewhat 1rnwillingly granted as Semneh lies heyund the lines.

It is much to be hoped that the time will soon come when the
way will be open as far as Khart.iirn, whieh fell into the hands of
the )Iahdists on Jan. 27th 1883, when the brave Gordon met his
death. The possession ofkhactint and the security not only ofthe
b'ile-rot1te thither but also of the desert-route from Berber to Suit-
kim am the necessary conditions for the gradual eivilizat'um of the
Stalin.
