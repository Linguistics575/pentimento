another almost Illegible inscription, engraved, like a paiimpsest,
above an older text and referring to liap-Zefa; on the same side

are caxtouches of Usenescn I.

Ilighex up, to the sight (NJ, is a row of three tombs close to
each other, the northernmost of which has been destroyed. The
second is the Ii'tthf el-'Astfkir, or Soldiers' Tomb, so named from
the rows of warriors on its S. wall. On the right side of this tomb
is a long and partly Mrireed inscription, referring not only to Kheti,
father of Tet iib, the owner of the tomb, but also to King Merikaxa
(I‘lth Dyn., ace, to Maspero, of the 10th " lIeracleopolitau Dyn.),
in whose reign Kheti lived.

The adjoining tomb (to the left or S.; No. 3) contains a long in-
scriptiou referring to Tefab, a 1dgh-priest of Aphem (Anubis),
lord of Assiht. A little farther to the S. is the tomb (No. 2) of an-
other Http-Zefu, son of AI and hendmau of the district ofhtef-kheut.

The geologieal formation of this hill or tombs is v interesting,
especially on account of the numemus specimens of Callxandne m'lolictz
and other fossils found on its upper part. The limestone is so hard
that it emits sparks, and hints or'A'raI, in considerable quantity.

. Among the curiosities ofAssii‘it there must not be forgotten the small
piece of Water standing between the river and the town, the ancient le-
gend ofwhose effect upon virgins is still half seriously related, Paul
Lucas is prubabl the xirst author who mentions it, and Michaelis devotes
a paragraph to it in his edition of Abu1frara's Description Of Egypt (A.
189): 'De quo stagno fingunt Siutenses, qius pom signe virginitatis ctipi,
uhde cxcuseths hahent hovhs nuptas virginiratem non prodentes, si stapi
