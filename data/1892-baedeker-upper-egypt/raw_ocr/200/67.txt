cut in the stone. That to the right (S.) informs us that Amenemha
departed this life in the 43rd year of Usertesen L, eocresponding
to the 25th year Of the governorship of Ameni. He undertook all
his wars 'sailing up-stream".- .e. he campaigned only against
the dwellers of the s., the 'miserable Kushites', as they are called
in the inscription. In those days the arms of the Pharaohs had not
yet been carried towards the F, The Sinai peninsula, with its
mines, is the only district in this direction which excited the Egyp-
tion lust of conquest. From his southern campaigns Ameliemha
brought home much gold and other booty. The inscription to the
left LN.) also mentions a victorious campaign towards the S., but
is of special interest for the light it throws on the truly human
feelings of this tye-gone time. Amenemha describes his oee11pa-
tions in time of peace as follows [beginning at the fourth line from
below): 'I cultivated the entire nome of Mah with many work-

The paintings in the interior of the tomb-ehamher proper are
unfortunately very much faded, and they have also been con-
siderably injured, especially in recent years. Some tigvlres of war-
riors Which still remain, armed with ulnh and axe or club and lance,

Tomb No. 2 is that of Khnumhotep, the sou of Nehera. It owes
its origin to a member of a family of high rank, in which the oftiee
of governor of Math seems to have been hereditary for several ge-
nerations. Ameuumha L, Usertesen L, and Ameliemha IL, the first
