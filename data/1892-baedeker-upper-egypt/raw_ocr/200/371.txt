iemy VII. Philotuetor, and most of its decorations were due to Pto-
lemy IS. Euergetes 11.,thougl1 the later Lagidas and Tiberius also
contributed a share.

The vestihule here is loflier than the other rooms nf the ceila. The
entrance was adorned hy Philometttr, hat the numcrttus interior reliefs
represent Tiberius before the ditlbrent deities of the temple, The carefully
eiahurated doorway at the back of the pronaas dates from Euergetcs II.
The first room is quite nuadorncd. Above the door to the second room
is a window, bordered on each side by two Uathor- masks. Tiberius is
named several times on the IV ans, which have been partly plastered mox-
with mad, The early Christians, who perhaps used the second room for
purposes connected with their services, have entirely plastered ever the
heathen Inacriptiam there-, while the highly interesting Reprus 1mtieni in
the third room have been left quite untouched. From these we learn that
the temple was intended to represent the Birth- House or Jfesherr, in
uhieh the infant unrus first saw the light (similar buildings at Deudemh
Edfu, etc., pp. 80, 253). The reliefs on the rehrwall are in two sections.
The lower series represents the Birth of IIurur, who is introduced into
life hy Amman. Tholh. and other gods. In the upper row we see Horns
ascending from a huge bunch of lotus-tlowers, and beside him the serpent
coiling round .1 column adorned with l0tus-i1nwers. beneath which kneel
two forms, covered with the Urreurlsood. The allegorical meaning of
this latter composition is obscure. On the IV. wall of the chamber is
a Goddess (head destroyed), otreriug the breact to the newborn child, and
close by is Untitcm the good fairy of Egyptian nurseries, placing her
left hand in benediction 0n the head of Horus, and holding his arm
with her right. Ring Ptolemy IN, Energetcs ll, is depicted handing
to her two tnetal-ruirrors 'to rejoice the golden one with the sight of her
beautiful form'. - These representations do not only celehrate the mystic
birth of the god, they refer also to the most heautifnl and most responsible
duties of motherhood, which Isis, Halhor, surd Nephthys undertake. Their
nursling appears indeed to he the infant Horus, hat it is evident from
many allusions, that the young Phaiaeh, the heir m the throne of Ra,
was considered as the incarnation in human form of the Voung god, and
that these representations were meant to convey to the Ptttlemies that a deity
had hnrne and suckled them or the iirsV -hom, and that the immortals
had guided their upbringing withi 1111 ible hands. Cleopatra. I., the mother
of the two brothers who caused the mating of I is inscription, had acted
as guardian and regent especially daring thee idhaod of Philou1etor, the
elder. She was the Isis oi the young Horus. 011 the E. outside wall of
the cella a. relief shows us Horus learning from the goddess of the N.
In play on the niue-stringed lute. while Isis superintends the lesson. The
shape of the instrument is Greek and by the goddess of the narth is
perhaps meant Hellenic music, which Was cultivated even by the earlier
Lagidae.

All the Jrucviptions here date from Tiberius, who is named 'Autokeator
Kisres' on the E, side and "Tiberius' on me W. side. A double votive-
inscription of the same date proves that the farmer phrase Applies to
Tiberius.

The columns of the Cotonnadee ou the W, and N. sides of the
cells exhibit genuine Ptoiemaiu capitals with a very high abacus.
On the N. side (Pl. f) is the peculiar but elegant capital, found
only on Phila:, consisting of a bunch of papyrus-buds, supporting
the abacus on their tips. Screen-walls, more than half as high as
the shafts, connect the columns. The most conspicuous columns ate
the seven on the side of the temple next the court. These hthe
