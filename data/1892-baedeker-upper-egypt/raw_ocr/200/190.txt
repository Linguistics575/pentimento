they are represented'. Many of the columns are prostrate, others
loan as though on the verge of falling, and arcbitrave and roof-
slabs haw either fallen or seem on the point of doing so. Yet the
whole is SO well-preserved that we never forget that we are in a
1uol0ruvaded hall, and the ruinous appearance so far from destroy-
ing the general irupression adds a picturesque charm to it. The
enormous proportions of this structure are perhaps beet appreciated,
it' we place ourselves in the wide doorway of the second pylon and
look through the double row of huge esl r'elunms towards the
sauetuary, i1. towards the E, The ruagir, iuiluence of the place is
fully felt in the morning or meniug, or by moonlight, when the
columns cast intense black shadmts on oath ether.

Roof. The proeessional route (p. 119) was distinguished by
plating on each side of it higher columns than in the rest of the
temple. These higher r'elmmts have calyx»eapitals, on which rest
t-uhiml abiwi, supporting the massive arehitmves which run parallel
with the main axis of the temple. Above the architrave another
small erection is visible. The lower columns immediately adjacent
on both :itles were connected with thisilmer row, by exerting upon
them square pillars, separated by windows, and united with each
other by means of a long architrave, above which another smaller
ertwtiou is observed. Only one nfthe windows is now extant, and
that in irnperl'twt preservation. The union efthese ttmr rntts uvdruw
a common roof thus provided a lighted lmsaege, about 78 ft. high
(about 32 ft. higher than the rest of the hall), through the centre
of the colunnruled hall. The shape of the columns in the outer COPS
is shown in Yol.1., p. Itiitr, the calyx» tpitals of the two inner
rows in Vol.1., p. 1b'5a,-Tbe Columns are not monolithic, but
are built, like huge wateh-Urwers, of hewn stones. The central
rous have smooth shafts and enormous ealyx-capitals 1sith curved
edges. Five bands at the neck of the column fasten the, striped
petals and slender ws-ttec-plants, which, mingled with royal
cartonnhes and other decorations, cling to the relyx. Each capital
resembles a gigantic goblet. Unfortunately the miuuteness t' the
ornamentation. especially on the upper pane, is not \ery suitable
for the huge proportions of the columns. All the columns, both in
the inner and in the outer row, are adorned with the name of
llnmses 11. and various embellishments. The shafts in every c'tse
here sunk relief: ('en ereux'), the former painting in “hivh is still
traceable at plat , . The inscriptions and representatiuns present,
on the whole, but little variety; but in a few considerable dif-
ferences may be noted as regards the persons of the gods and the
gifts \thich they received or bestowed. This is specially the case
with the columns. Those in the first six rows to the N. have,
towards the top, the eurtouche of Seti L, and further down that
ot' Raruses IV; the remaining rows have ltamses IL at the top and
Ramses IV. below. Ramses IIL, llamses Vi., and Ramses NUI.
