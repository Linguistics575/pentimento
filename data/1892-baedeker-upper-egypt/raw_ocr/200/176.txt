rubbed out. On the left (15.) wing, however, the life-like figure of
the king, shooting arrows from his chariot, and the fine rearing
horses of his chariot, are still clearly to he distinguished, On the
right (W.) wall also a good deal may be made out. The king is here
represented in his camp. He has dismounted from his chariot, which
waits for him, and has seated himself upon his throne. His oflicers
await his instructions, and farther in the background the troops
rest in their camp. The inscriptions are much injured, but it can
be made out from them that they were graven in the stone ehieily
in honour of Ramses Ii.'s victory over the Kheta (Aramkahs) and
their allies. In the 5th year of the king, on the 9th Payui, the fov-
tress of Iiatesh on the Orontes was stormed. The river and the
contest on its banks are still distinguishable. The Epic of Pentax"
in 90 . tical lines, covers the lower part of the W. wing and part
of the E wing; some of it has recently been uncovered, the Test is
still concealed by rubbish, This poem was the national epos, the
Iliad, of the ancient Egyptians. It occurs twice on the E. bank at
Thebes - (m the N. side of the pylon at Luxor and on the s. side
of the temple of Karnak (here also partly concealed by earth). It is
also found, though in a very t'mgmentary condition, on the N.wall
ot' the temple of Ramses II. at Ahydos (discovered first by Eisen-
10hr), and in the most complete (hicratic) form in the Papyrus
Ruifct (now in the Louvre) and the Papyrus Sallicr III. tum in
the British Museum).

The poetic text on the pylons at Luxor is followed by a prose
text, dealing mainly with the arrival of two hostile spies, who gave
out at first that the Kheta had fied into the land of Khirabn (trel-
hon or Aleppo] to the N. of Tunep, but who on being scourged re-
vealed the real lurking-place of the enemy to the N.W. of I(atesh.
The king hastily recalled the Egyptian troops, but too late to pre-
vent his came being suddenly attacked on the S. by the thta. The
Egygtians were surrounded, and only the personal bravery of the
king secured the tlnal victory. This prose inscription, preserved in
full at the Ramesseum aunt in the temple of Alon-Simbel, describes
the same event as the poem of Pentaur, though it dates it a month
later.

The most important and iis1est episodes according to the restoration
of the text by li. de Rouge are as follows. Then the miserable and
worthless Khetn with his numcruus allies lay hidden behind the fortress
of Katcsh. His majesty found himself alone (With his servants). The
legion of Ammon marched after him; the legion of Ra passed lhrungh
the valley tn the S. of the fortress of Slmbtun and marched forwards
