to the gods of the temple. Some of tho resisting oxen are remarkably
true to nature. Probably the saerifieial animals were actually slain
in this court, a rom‘lusion strengthened by the broken pottery found
here by Mariette and the two springs of turbid water. A well has
also been discovered outside, the It. wall of the temple, which may
be the spring described by Straho.

The Rnom marked y nn the plan is the most interesting of the
other apartments in this wing. The entrance to it is on the left
(S.) side of the space between the sanctuary and the third row
of mhxnins in the second hypostyle hall. The door leading to it is
named 'the great door of lla-ma-men Lite. Scti), the favourite of
Sokar’t To this deity, Osiris-Sokar or Ptah-Soi-Osiris, keeper of
the realm of shades, this room is consecrated, though other gods,
shah as Nefer Turn, Horns, and Tlmth are also represented here.
The king appears in the act of offering sarsritiee. To the extreme
right on entering, on the wall between the doors, are reliefs of
richly adorned kilometers, the symbols of the state or stability
amt pei'nmnenee aimed at by Pharaoh; the inscriptions inform
us that they were tledirated to the Osiris of the nmleer-world, Ptah-
Sokar-Tatoen, who was worshipped in the Memnonium ofAbydos.
On the otramus-wall, to the right of the door, is the bark of Snkar,
and alist is given of the titles of this god of the many aliases,
who was revered in FO many different tIts. The form of the three
columns prcsuorrsy1 here is peculiar". The nylindrical shafts, which
hear the hhamls without any transitional member, are flattened at
the points whore their periphery would touch an exscrihed square,
and hence their seetiru1 is in the shape of MI octagon with tour
straight and four curved sides. - The doors to the right, on each
side of the above-mentioned Kilometers, lead into two oblong rooms
with Vaulted veiling, which have partly mm. in (P1. q, r). - The
other apartments of this wing rontain nothing of Special interest.
They are all ruinous ml five of them eaunotbeeutercd except from
the outside. - In y " the Mnmumiium of'Abydos, the traveller
should hear in mind that he has to do with a Cenotaph, dedicated
to the mnnes of a king apotlwosised as Osiris and to his forefathers;
and he should also remcrnlrer that thp, site of the building was vle-
termined by the helicf that the souls of those who had been 'saneti-
fied' near the Holy Tomb t-ouirl look forward with contislence to the
highest joys of the world to come.
