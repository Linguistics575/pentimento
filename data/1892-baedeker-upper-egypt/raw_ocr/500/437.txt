to the ranfs-headed Amman, Osiris, Isis, and IIurus. According to the
Greek inscription here, the temple was dedicated to Amenebis, Le. the
Amman of llih, god of Tkhonemyris, i.e. Tu-Hnmm-ra 'belonging to
Elmum', the name of the place. This inscription relates to a rebuilding
of the sanctuary (cnxdzl and of the vestibule (:pdvaoc), carried out in the
3rd year (140 AND) of" the emperor Antoninus Pius Cvltrs.3ic) under the
prefect Avidius Heliodorus, the military commandant Septimius Jfaero and
the general (strategus) Pueniat Caepio. The celebrated rhetorician Aristides
came to Egypt in the prefecture of Helindorus, who was a famous
orator. The entrance-portal admits to the first hall, 2iph., ft. long by 191/e ft.
broad, which is adjoinetl toy the Sanctuary, IO ft. by "ills ft. A niche at the
hack was probably intended for the statue of a god. To the w. of the
sanctuary is another ch mber, 10ft. long by 23/4 broad. The total length
of the temple was ll ft.

The village of 2rou.-(3-400 inhah.) is only ll/elm to the S. of Kasr cz-
Zayin, and 7hrs. to the S. of Hula}; is the deserted village of Dakakin. A
route leads sits Hadegugeh, with a good spring and tine date-palms and dihv-
palms, to Berys (600 iuhab.; 13 hrs. from 311153). situated on a hill, with
numerous date-palms and surrounded with fields of grain (ehiefly dura),
abounding in springs. El-Jluks (100 inhah.), 3hrs. farther, is the most
southerly point in the oasis. The caravan-route leads hence in 25 days ot Dar-
iid. About halfway between Berys and Naks, but a little to E. of the road,
lies the temple of Dash el-Iial'uh. This temple also was once surrounded
with p, high wall of unburned bricks, furnished on the inside with stairs
and galleries. Two prupylous stand in front of the temple which faces
the N.; the tirst and larger of these is 13/; ft. broad and 133/; ft. long.
(in the arehitrave of the portal is a Greek inscription (published by
Cailliaud) of the 19th year of the emperor Trajan (116 A.l).), in which
the inhabitants of Kysis (oiixo c-it Krssurr, comp. Kits, the above-men-
tioned hieroglyphic name (if the oasis) record the building of this pylon,
under Marcus Rutilius Lupus, prefect of Egypt. On the left wall of the
same pylon is another but hardly deeiphisvahle Greek inscription in which
the name é'li. m'cn recurs. Behind the propylon are some remains of columns,
so that a colonnaded gallery must be supposed to have existed between
the first and second 'pylons, which are 100 ft. apart. The Second Pylon,
only 13ft. broad and Ily/e ft. long, is united by a brick wall with the
girdle-wall. The poor sculptures upon it represent a king whose name
is not legible. About 38ft. farther back is the temple proper, its first
portion being a kind of Vestibule, 0n the sides of whi'h a Roman emperor
presents offerings to b'erapis, lsis, and Horus. The hiernglyphics, however,
are scarcely legible. This vestibule, with two columns at the entrance,
is only 22 ft. broad and 133/, ft. deep. Beyond it is a portico with four
columns, the capitals of which are much damaged. A door in the right
(W.) wall seems to have led to a staircase. At the back of the pnrtim
is a large door between two smaller ones, the former leading into the
sanctuary which is divided into two chambers, the latter into corridors.
The method of lighting the sanctuary chambers by windows at the top of
the walls, like those in the great temple of Karnak, and the vaulted roof
should he noticed. Over the doors appears the winged sun-disc, and on
each side are hieroglyphics. The S. (back) wall of the temple is also
covered with reliefs, une representing the emperor Domitian, sacrificing
to Horus, son of Isis, and to Osiris.

About GU ells from this temple are the ruins of another nnteworthy
structure, wholly of brick, apparently also a. temple. The entrance is
formed hy a pointed Gothic arch, and the three following chambers have
doors of the same form, on which the winged sun-disc is Mill to be seen.
Hoskins refers this building to the Romans,
