282 Route 29. PHILXE. History.

Arabian Nights ends as follows: 'So they lived in the bosom ofhappiness
to the advanced age, in which the roses of enjoyment shed their leaves and
tender friendship must take the place of passion'.-?

It seems as though this legend had arisen on Egypt soil, and as
though it contained some echoes of the ancient mythology of Phila:
e.g. the search of Isis for her beloved Osiris and the disposal of the
goddess on an island in the Nile. It is even more remarkable that
Anas el-Wogtii1 reached the island on a crocodile and that on the,
W. side of the temple of Isis is a relief (p. 1194) representing the
mummy of Osiris borne by a crocodile. .

The rocky island of Bigeh, opposite Philar, seems to have been
an even earlier pilgrim-resort than the latter; yet there was probably
a temple also on Phila in comparatively early times. In the 4th
cent. B.C. this must have been either unimportant 01' in ruins, for

reigned as a rival king to the Persian Achaemenides and recognized
only by his countrymen, at the date mentioned. The work that he
began was zealously continued by the Ptolemies, who had greater
resources at command, but even they left ample room for additional
buildings and farther decorations at the hands of the Roman em-
perors down to Diocletian.

The principal temple, like the island itself, was sacred to Isis,
whose priests resided here down to comparatively late times as a
learned college. As one of the graves of Osiris Was situated here,
it early became a pilgrimage resort for the Egyptians, one of whose
solemn oaths also was by the Osiris of Philay. When the cult of
Isis as well as that of Serapis became known to the Hellenes and
afterwards to the Romans, many Greek and Italian pilgrims tlocked
to the shrine of the mysterious, benign, and healing goddess. Even
under Ptolemy Physkon the priests were compelled to petiti'on the
king to check the superabundant stream of pilgrims, who consumed
the temple-stores and threatened to reduce the priests to the ntyCeos-
sity of withholding from the gods their bounclen offerings (comp.
p. 284). On all the walls and columns of the temple are inserip-
tions, placed there by Greek or Roman officials, tourists, and pil-
grims. They are most numerous in the S. part of the temple and in

t In the Thousand and One Nights this tale occupies the 37lst to
the 380th nights. It differs considerably front the, versions of the sailors,
which moreover vary very much among themselves. The tale of Anas
et-Wog0d and his mistress Bl-Ward ('the Rose') is the title of a litho-
graphed pamphlet of 34 leaves in which the above story is narrated in
verse in the fellahin dialect (not the literary Arabic). With several other
pieces, e.g. the tat and the Rats', it supplies the usual material for re-
citations in the Arab coffee-houses, and is thus universally known. It
begins 'I shall build for thee a castle in the midst of the sea (i.e. water)
