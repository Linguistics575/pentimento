350 Route 35. KHARGEH. The Western

top of the E. side, a space 8 ft. high and 6 ft, broad, is occupied by a
long inscription of 66 lines, reported both by Cailliaud and Hoskins. In
this inscription, which dates from the 2nd year of the emperor Galba
(GE) A.D.), Julius Demetrius, gevernor of the oasis, communicates the
answer of the provincial governor (irsuus'v), Tiberius Julius Alexander, to
the cowplaints of the inhabitants of the oasis against the illegal exaction of
taxes, etc., to the effect that future extortion is forbidden under penalties
and that. what has been unjustly exacted will be restored. On the left
side also, lower down, are some shorter Greek inscriptions. One of these,
by the general (crpmm√©q) Posidonitts, dated the 7th Mekhir of the emperor
Tiberius Claudius, directs attention to a decree by the provincial governor
Gncws Vir-gilius Capito, inscribed below. This decree warns against pay-
ments to unauthorized extorters of money, and threatens the latter with
severe punishment, viz. the payment of ten times the extorted sum as
penalty besides restitution fourfold to the victim. - Traces of an avenue
of sphinxes exist between the first and second gateways, Which are 50 ft.
apart. Only a fragment of the left (S.) wing of the 'Second Gateway is
standing. Some crudely executed representations on its inner side depict
an unnamed emperor (the cartouehe is empty) before Ammon-Ra, Muth,
and Tum, lord of Hi?) (Le. e1-Ehtrgeh). The Third Gateway, 140 ft. from
the second, is still entire. It is 18 ft. long and nearly 20 ft. broad.
Beneath the cornice appears the well-known winged sun-disc with the
serpents of both lands. The lintel below has two representations on the
right side: an unknown king before Ammon-Ra and Khnum, and then
before Harmaehis; on the left the same king appears before Tum, then
before Ammon-Ra, Uaz, and Month.

The next two fields on the right and left are destroyed. Then on the
right, Darius II. (P d25-h05 B.CO I i I g I appears thrice,

viz. before Amber and Tefnut, before Isis and Nephthys, and before Horus,
Isis, and Nephthys. On the left the same king appears before Osiris,
Horsi-isis, and Isis, then before Khnum, and finally before Thoth in Hit;
and the gods of his cycle. On the inside of this doorway, Darius appears
on the left with the tigure of Ma before Ammon-Ra, lord of Bib, and on
the right (where his name is almost illegible) before Ammon-Ra, the hus-
band of his mother, presenting to him two palm-trees. Two vertical in-
scriptions on the exit from this pylon (right and left) are also noteworthy.
These refer to the above-mentioned Darius as 'the beloved of Ammon-Ra,
Lord of Hib, the great god, strong with the sword', and continue: 'He
has built the walls (mm!) of good white stone for a meska (dwelling) of
the god, its doors of aeaeia-wood, covered with Asiatic brass in excellent
enduring workmanship. May (the gods) grant him innumerable festivals
on the seat of Horns'. The designs on the W. side of the pylon are no
longer distinguishable. About 40 ft. behind this third gateway is the
Fore-court, 52 ft. deep and 30 ft. broad, the front of which has fallen. It
contained four enraged columns, two at the front corners and two at the
sides, and had also a door on each side, of which that to the right (NJ
is still entire. This latter bears the cartouehes of king Nekhthorheb
(Nectanebus 1.), of the 30th Dyn. (378-364 B.C.), on the right before Tum,
on the left before Month. This king was the builder of the fore-court,
and his cartouches also appear on the side-doors in the following portal,
the architrave of which is imperfect. To the left Nekhthorheh appears
before Ptah and Sekhet, then, below, before Month and Caz, and iinall.v
before Ammon-Ra, Muth, and Khnum; to the right he appears before
Osiris and Isis, then before Thoth and Jfehemaut, and iiuall.v before the
ram's-headed Ammon and Muth. The gods are styled lords of Bib
