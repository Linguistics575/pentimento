66 Route J. AIiYDOS. Mcmnonium

Memnonium at Abydos, which contains no fewer than 76 eartouches,

only two of which are slightly injured. The tablet from the temple

of Ramses (p. 68), now in London, contains 16 entire and 2 half
destroyed eartonches, while the list of Salslsirah, Jiseovered by Ma-
riette, has 39 whole and 3 damaged eartouches.

/'''""-'""1 Mena, Le. Memes, the first historic, king of Egypt, heads
the list. The names following his are those of the most
prominent monarchs, at least those whose legitimacy was

NWWâ€˜ unquestionable. The Tferaeleopolitans and the Hyksos are,
naturally left out, but other rulers, of whom we possess

q monuments, have also been apparently deemed unworthy of

inclusion in this important roll of honour. The merit of
first observing and publishing this inestimable historieal
document belongs to Prof. Diimichen.

On the left wall of the corridor we again meet Seti and the
youthful Ramses. The father holds a eenser in his lefthand, while
the son, adorned with the priestly panther-skin, pours a lihation on
the altar in front of him. The titles of the right wall re-appear
here. The inscription, which the royal pair faces, contains in syste-
matic order the names of theseobjeets ot'worship, with their homes,
whom Seti has honoured with saerifieial gifts. The sculpture in this
corridor, consisting of alto-reliefs on the fine-grained limestone, is
all executed with the greatest delicacy. 1n the centre of the right
wall a door leads into a narrow Chamber (P1. t), vaulted in the same
manner as the sanctuaries (p. (ll), and preceding the stair CPI. ii)
which leads to the hill at the bank of the temple. The inscriptions
here are in excellent preservation, being injured only in a few places;
the adjoining figures of Seti aml Ramses show the latter arrived at
manhood and the throne. Safeldi, the goddess of history, 'the great
mistress of books', addresses her darling son Seti. The ceremony of
foundation, which we find more fully represented and described in
the Ptolemaie temples, is also depicted here. The praises of the king
are sung, an d his merits are, at the command of lla, to be committed
to writing by the goddess of history. Thoth also congratulates the
king in the emphatic manner usual to such inscriptions, and promises
him an eternal existence and the stability ofhis kingdom for hundreds
of thousands of years. Thoth is named the tongue of Ra and lord
of the speech of the prophet of truth. This staircase was completed
while Ramses shared the throne of his father as co-ruler.

The other rooms of this part of the building are all more or less
in ruins. From the S. end of the kings' gallery we enter a kind of
peristyle Court CPI. G), with seven columns, which perhaps was
never completed. The sculptures and hieroglyphies are not very
carefully executed and appear 'en ereux' instead of in high relief'.
The most interesting scenes are those on the lower part of the walls,
representing the slaughter of the cattle, gazelles, and antelopes
which Seti had so lavishly vowed Lin the adjoining kiug's gallery)
