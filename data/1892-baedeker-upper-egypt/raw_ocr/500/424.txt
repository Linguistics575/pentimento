S.) by a smaller side-room, while at the back several steps lead into
a third room, the cella. The four clustered columns which support
the ceiling of the main chamber recall the proto-Done columns of
Benihasan (p. I'?) A stone bench runs round the walls. On the
W. wall is Anuke suckling the infant King Horus , with the words:
‘I am thy mother, I give thee milk, it brings to thee peaceful life,
youth for thy limbs and strength for thy arms.' Beside her stands
the 1'arn's-headed Khnum, lord of the fresh water in Tu-ab. On the
Rwall (left) King Horus appears before the ibis-headed Thoth and
four different forms of the god Horus, viz. as lord of Mam, of Be-
heni, of Bek, and of Maha - all names of places in Nubia. Over
the door into the left side-chamber is the cartouche of the king,
'beloved of Ammon-Ra and of Thoth'. On the N. wall the king is
led by the hand by Seth, with the ass's head and the god Horus,
with the symbol of life. Some of the pictures are now scarcely re-
cognizable. On the W. wall, to the right of the entrance, is the
king before Thoth, who promises him strength, health, and victory.
The two side-rooms have neither pictures nor sculptures.

The Saracen fortress of Addeh (W. bank), sometimes called
Shataui, is named Mashakit by Champollion. In the mountains to
the S. of it are some almost inaccessible steles and a rock-cave,
which is wider than it is deep. The cave belonged to the scribe
Pa-uar, prince of Rush and president of the S. lands, fan-bearer at
the king's left hand. Two-thires of it are occupied by a broken
seated figure of a god. 0n the inner side of the entrance is the
kneeling figure of Pa-uar before Anuke, mistress ot Amonhari.
On the walls we see one of the sun-worshipping kings (p. 23), viz.

On the rocky slope to the right of the entrance to the grotto is
a proskynema dedicated to the gods of the district, by Kaza, son
of a Tutmes.

The hill of Shatani is the last spur on the E. bank of the range
of hills running close to the Nile from Ibrim, and presenting some
curious pyramidal formations. At this point the chain bends east-
wards towards the desert. On the W. bank, however, the river is
still skirted by hills for a short distance farther. On this bank lies
