investigated. Travellers who wish to do so will find the hill not a very
arduous climb. In descending they may strike the river at a point a
little farther to the S. and row thence to the dhahabiyeh.

On the W. bank, 3 M. from the river, lies el-Kusiyeh, now an
insignificant fellah town, representing the ancient Kusae, in Which,
according to Elian, Venus Urania and her cow (i.e. Hathor neht
pet Hathor, the mistress of heaven) were worshipped. No inscrip-
tions have been found in Iiusiyeh itself, bat elsewhere the name
of IIathor occurs as the Lady of Kesi. Prom Kesi came the Coptic
liuIc-Hom (kos-koo), and thence was derived the Arabic lgusiyeh.

At el-Harib, on the E. bank, are the ruins of an ancient Egyp-
tian town, at the mouth of a With ascending to the Arabian moun-
tains. The walls, provided in places with window-openings, are
high, but fragments of demotie, inscriptions show them to be of late
date. Small caves in the rocks contain bones from mummies of
men and eats.

Mtndaltat, on the W. bank (rail. stat., see p. o, an important
town with 13,900 inhab., is the seat of a Coptic bishop and con-
tains several fine villas and gardens and a bazaar. Its market is
much frequented on Sun., and it also prossesses a sugar-factory
and a distillery, where date-brandy Caralsi) is made, partly for local
consumption by the Copts and partly for export. The town lies
close to the river, which must here have greatly encroached on the
W. hank since the close of last century. The Arabs translate Mon-
faldt as 'Lot's place of banishment'.

To the SAV. of Monfalt"st, lies Beni 'Adin, where in 1798 a collision
took place between the troops of General Desaix and the Arabs. In the
following year, just after the arrival of a caravan from Darfdr, General
Davoust destroyed it as a nest of rebels, taking the women prisoners.
Mohammed 'Ali united his army here in 1320. The journey to the oasis

of Furrifrah (p. 34cl) is frequently begun here. The first station to the
N.W. is the convent of Maragh, containing 50 Coptic monks.

Esh-Shelgilhil, a small village on the E. hank, lies on a
narrow strip of fertile land between the Nile and the S. end of the
rocky Gebe] Abu Fédah. It is the starting-point for a visit to the
Crocodile Grotto of Ma'abdeh. A guide, who may be procured in
the village of Sheliilliil, is necessary to show the best way over
the stony hill and to point out the entrance to the cavern, which
easily escapes the eyes of even prar'tisetl searchers. Lantern and
ropes are also necessary, and a few strong sailors to handle the,
latter. Ladies should not attempt this excursion. The distance is
about 41,2 31., and most of the way is up a steep hill. We first
proceed towards the N.W. to the (1/2 hr.) village of et-Mdabileh,
and theme to the N.E. towards the hill, the plateau of which we
reach in 3/4 hr. A walk of 1 2 hr. towards the S. then brings us to
the grotto. The entrance is in the shape of a hole 12 ft. deep. into
which we are lowered by ropes, a guide previously descending to
aid in landing. We then creep on all-fours for some distance
through the dust of aneient mummies, and after some time
