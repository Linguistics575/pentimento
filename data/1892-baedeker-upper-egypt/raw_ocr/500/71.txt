with post and telegraph offioes, several mosques, and a large sugar
factory, the railway approaches close to the river. The factory is
said to contain a stone with a hitherto unpublished Creek inscription.

About 1 N. inland (W.) from Raglah, between the Bahr Yusuf and
the Nile, lie the ruins of the once famous Ashmunén. The ancient
C), while the Greeks called

it ITermopotis, the town of Hermes-Thoth, the god of writing and science,
whose ehiefsar1etiaary was situated here. Hence the town was also named
Pa Teyuti, or town of Thoth. Hermopolis Magna was the capital of the
Herniopnlitan name of Upper Egypt. The name Ashmunén is derived,
according to Quatremére (Mémoires Géographiques, 1., 1313.490 etseq.)1
from the fact that the town embraced two different communities, one
on the site of the present ruins, the other, with a harbour, on the Nile.
Among the plates of the French Expedition are two views of a fine
Portico of the Ptolemaic period, with two rows of six columns each
(Antiquités IV, P1. 50, 51). The columns were 55 ft. high, and the portieo
was 1241/2 ft. long and 291/2 ft. wide. In Minutoli’s 'Journey to the Hasis
of Jupiter Ammon' (Plate XIV) a view is given of One of the columns,
with the cartouche of Philippus Aridzeus, one of the successms of
Alexander the Great, who was a native of Ashmunén. The remains of
the temple Were used in building a saltpetre faetory.-At Gebel Tunalz,
near Hermopolis, is a tablet (much dilapidated) with an inscription of
the sun-worshippers Khu-en-aten, who lived on the opposite bank of the
river (comp. Tell el-Amarnah, p. 22).

Nearly opposite Rédah, on the E. bank, MM. from Benihasan,
lies the village of Shtkh 'Alithleh, with the ruins of Antinoii.
Hadrian erected a new town in honour of his favourite Antinous
0n the site of the Egyptian town of Base, where the handsome
youth is said to have drowned himself, to fnUl the oracle which
predicted a heavy loss to the emperor and so to prevent a more
serious disaster. The village lies on the bank amid palms of un-
usual size and beauty, and to the S. of it is a brook, now dry
except after rain, which must formerly have flowed through the
town. The remains of public buildings of the Egyptian period are
scanty. The French Expedition saw a triumphal arch, a theatre,
and two streets flanked with columns, the one running N. and S.
and leading to the theatre, the other at right angles leading to the
city-gate and the hippodrome. A lofty column bore an inscription
of Alexander Severus (A.D. 222). To-day, however, there are few
remains either of Greek or Roman times. Among the palms lies a
fine Corinthian capital. The marble belonging to the 'very fine gate
of the Corinthian order' that Pocoeke saw here and figured in his
book was burned to make lime for building the s11gar-faetory at
Rt'u.lah. The extensive ruins of the ancient town lie to the E. of the
village of Shékh 'Abideh. The streets and ground-plans of the
houses are still recognisable. The rooms were small and the walls
were made mainly of Nile bricks. There are, however, some IM--
derground apartments of flat Roman bricks, :reaehed by stone stair-
cases. Near the scanty ruins of one of the largest buildings lies a
basin of white marble, which must have had a circumference of
at least 23 ft.
