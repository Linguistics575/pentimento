for the support of the flag-stares. The pylons lying to the S. were
built by the kings ofthe 18th Dyn., and were connected with the side
of the great' temple of Ammon, whence they were reached by a door
between Pylon III and Pylon IV (p. 145).

On the rear of the left side of Pylon III is a long inscription
(unfortunately imperfect at the top), recording the gifts of Amen-
hotep III. to the god Ammon; and to the left is the representation
of several ships, recording a festival voyage instituted by the king
in honour of the god in his naos. The sanctuary existed before the
Hykios period, certainly under the 12th Dyn., and the conquerors
and expellers of the intruders erected in honour of Ammon suc-
cessive additions, increasing in size as they receded from the
sanctuary.

On passing through the third ruined pylon into the Central
Court (PI, B), we come first upon two OBELISKS, of which, however,
one has been destroyed, though Pococke saw them both erect in
1738. The standing obelisk (Pl. g) is, like most others, made of
granite from the quarries of Syene (Assuen). It is 70 ft. high and
stands upon a base () ft. square. Only the lower portions of the
inscriptions on its faces are seriously injured. The central rows are
in larger and finer hieroglyphics than the side-rows. The former
date from the time of Tutmes L, the latter contain the names of
later appropriators of this monument. The usual formulae occur in
these inscriptions; Tutmes 1., among other titles, is nemed the
victory-bringing Horus, who fulftls the years and enlivens the hearts.
He, 'the lovely son of the sun, erected this monument in honour of
his father Ammon, lord of the throne of the world, who is wor-
shipped in E. Thebes ('Apet'). In front of this obelisk are the
remains of a cubical basis, which probably served to support a
colossus. The two obelisks and the colossus marked the entrance to
the temple in the reign of Tutmes I.

Next follows Pylon IV, in such a ruinous condition that its ori-
ginal form cannot be ascertained. It dates from the time of Tut-
mes I., who is represented by the Osiris-columns attached to its
inner JO side. Only the N. door-pillar is now standing. It bears an

expresssion of homage to Ammon from Tutmes IT. (CD eeee III),

but beneath the arm of the king is a short inscription, in which the
Ethiopian Sabeko records a restoration of the temple by himself.
A similar reference to his campaigns appears in the inscription on
the left side. Seti II. has also placed his name upon this doorway,

The doorway closing the fourth pylon on the E. fell during the
inundation of 1865. Beyond its site are a few ruinecl fragments, of
a structure, the original arrangement of which is only to be under-
stood on the supposition that five couples of columns stood on the
left and six couples on the right, and that two couples were removed
from each side to make room for two imposing Obelisks. The
