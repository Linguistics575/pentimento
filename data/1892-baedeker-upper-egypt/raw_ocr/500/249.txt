and there is none like to him'. Of the enemy, through whose disconititure
he won so much praise, it is said that they worshipped him as seen as
they heard of his bravery, that they threw themselves on the ground at
his feet, etc. He is compared with Ptah, Osiris, She, and Ra. In line 13
the king addresses his faithful followers, telling them that Ammon has
lent him his throne, power, strength, and victory. In line 16 the nations
that were unable to resist the attack of the islanders are named. Of the
Patter it is said: 'No people made, head against their arms, from the land
of Kheta to Kati, Kirkamasha (Karkhemish), Aratu (Armies), and Arasa
(Assyria). They assembled in the land of Amara (Amorites f), they over-
came the pcople and the land as though they did not exist. They came,
and a tire was prepared beforehand for these who bad turned their faces
towards Egypt'. Among these foes, as line 18 recounts, were the Pulasata
(Philistines), Zekkari (Teuerians'0, Shakalsha (Sicilians). Danauna(Danai),
11nd Pashasha (? Oscans according to Chabas). Their hearts were high, and
they were tilled with their plans'. But the king of Egypt laid a snare
for them. God stood by him. He firmly maintained Zaha (Northern
Syria) as his frontier. The battle must have taken place in Egypt itself.
The king barred the mouth of the Nile as with a wall with well-manned
ships, and attacked the enemy with land-forces and chariots, treading
them to the ground. The king boasts that he had fought like Month at
the head of bis troops, acting like a champion (ustenuu), that knows his
strength, like a brave warrior, that saves his people in the day of battle.
"Those, who reached my borders reaped no more harvests on carth'. He
strewud their corpses along the bank; their ships and goods sank in the
waters. 'l made the lands go back, to remember the land of Egypt, chant-
ing my name in their lands'. In line 25 he extots himself and claims to
have taken their lands from the barbarians, to have made their borders
his own, and to have received the homage of their princes. He orders
general rejnieing, calms the hearts of his followers, and extels his own
strength. At this point the inscription is interrupted by a gap in the
fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh courses of masonry from the top. The
runainder contains nothing of interest.

The granite gateway of the second pylon admits to theColounaded
Hall (PI. IO, which presents a rnrious appearance owing to the
prostrate columns of a Christian church, erected here at an early
period and destroyed after the spread of Islam in Upper Egypt.
This second court is a specially retired enclosure, in which the
slightly projecting concave cornice, running round the entire open
space of the square hall, produces the finest effect. It is 125 ft.
long; and 138 ft. broad. On all four sides is a coionnade.

The roofis suppmted 0n the N. and S. by columns, en the Fl.
by a rew of raryatides, while on the W. the rear is closed by a
passage, with eight caryati0-pillars in front and eight eeiumns be-
hind. An inscription at the top of the inner side of the left (S.]
pylon informs us that this was the Festut Hull proper; while the
same fact is to be gathered from the sculptures on the back-walls
ofthe cnlonnmles. Turning first to the right we see, in the upper
row a series ofNlepresentutirms, beginning, at the N.W. angle of
the hall and running all allong the N. side and en the E. side as far
as the entrance. This illustrates the beautiful FESTIVAL OF THE
S'mmcmse, which was eeiehrated in hemonr of the god Khem. It
took place in the month T'akhon, i.e. the first harvest-month, and at
the new moon. The course of the moon was represented as a stair-
case with fourteen steps (days), hence the name of the festival. It
