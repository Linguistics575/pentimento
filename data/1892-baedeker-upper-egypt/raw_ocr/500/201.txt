to the gett ofThehes at a step-altar. Various nomes of Upper and
Lower Egypt took place in this t-eremony. Mention should be made
of a large flabellum or feather-screen, which appears to-conceal the
figure of Ammon, Le. the hidden, the veiled. This symbolically
indicates that the deeper conception of the essence of the god must
remain hidden from the uninitiated.

Around the sanctuary lay a number of apartments (now all
more or less destroyed) in which later kings, such as Seti IL,
Sheshenk, and the Ethiopians Sabako and Taharka, have inscribed
their names. The last placed their inscriptions upon walls which
had been built much earlier, at the latest under Tutmes 111. The
last-named great warrior and builder caused a list of his acquisi-
tions through war to be carved near the holy of holies, and this has
proved ofthe greatest value for the history of his times. Part of
this inscription was" taken to Paris; what remains at Karnak is
much injured, though still quite legible. It is to be found in the
passage to the N. of the sanctuary (Phi), where it begins at the E.
end, is continued beyond the door, and then at the point where the
wall recedes to the W. First copied by Lepsius, it has been trans-
lated by S. Birch and II. Brugseh and several others, but it is too

long to allow of more than an extract being here given.

Statement of the Acquisitions of Tutmes III. The iirst lines below,
half destroyed, contain the royal commands to undertake the placing of
the inscription. In the month Pharmnthi (the day is broken off) of the
22nd year of his reign the first campaign was undertaken, from Zar
(Tanis). (The victorious king on his return in the following year seems
to have got vid of the guardianship of his sister Hatasu.) The march of
the Egyptian army leads at first through well-known towns, as the fortress
of the land of Sharohaun (nharon), which begins at Jeriza (Jericho?), etc.

before the fortress of Gazatn (Gaza?), and entered it in triumph on the
5th. lle brought the accurscd prince thereof to ruin, that he might
extend the borders of Egypt aeeending to the commands of his father
Amman. (In the 16th Pukhtm in the same year t23rd) he proceeded

encamped before the fortress of Aalnna, ncurwhich there must have been
a navigable river as Tutmes made use of one. The army proceeded
through the valley of Autumn and at the seventh (i.e. an auspicious) hour
reached the hank of the brook of Kina (Kanah) to the S. of Megiddn.

Here the king pitched his tent and delivered an iuspiriting speech to
his troops. The festival of the new moon, which was also the anniver-
sary of the coronation, was celebrated nu the Qist Pakhon. The king
mounted his chariot, which was richly adorned with silver-gilt, and in
his war-harness i'resembling Horus, Mentu, the god of battles, and his
father Ammon, drew up his troops in two wings and a centre, which he
himself commanded. The battle began in the plain of 3legiddo and the
enemy was defeated. Their horses were taken, and their golden chariots
