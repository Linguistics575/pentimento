6000, the other at 9000 men. The Egyptian chariots meet those of the
Kheta and their allies, who ride three in a chariot. Many of the enemy,
both Kheta and Libyans, have fallen into the water. To the extreme
right, above the blue-painted river, is the king in his chariot, addressing
gracious words to his ofheers, who count the severed hands and limbs of
the Kheta and Naharina before him and bring fettered prisoners. A narrow
strip helow represents the chariot-iight. Beneath, to the left, is the
stockaded camp, into which, according to the adjoining inscription, the
enemy forced their way but were repulsed by the single legion of Ammon,
commanded by the king, who had been lulled into security by the false
reports of two spies, and had despatched several of his regiments in
another direction. In the picture to the right the king sits upon his
throne, among his eourtiers. To the right and left of the royal person is
the account of an event in the 5th year of his reign, already known to
us from the Ramesseum (p. 161). It relates that two Arabs (Shasu) e11-
tered the Egyptian camp, pretending to be refugees from the Kheta, ahd
seeking service under the Pharaoh. They stated that the Kheta lay at
Khirabn (Helhon i.e. Aleppo) to the N. of Thunep, and were in terror of
the Egyptians. This information was false, and the two spies were flogged
(in the lowest scene to the right), in order, as the inscription says, that
they might say where the miserable Kheta lurked. The spies were next
brought before the king On his golden throne, and cross-examined, and
finally confessed that the Kheta, with numerous allies, lay behind Eatesh,
The king assembles his generals, relates what the spies have told, chides
his offiers for being so imperfectly informed, and orders the recall of the
troops that had been sent elsewhere. He himself puts on his armour,
attacks the enemy, slays them, and throws them into the river,

Two pictures on the back (W.) wall of this main hall show the king
presenting the enemies in fetters to the gods, On the left are two rows
of negroes and Nubians before Ammon-Ra, the deihei1 image of the king,
and Math; on the right the Asiatics (Hittites) before Harmaehis, the
figure of the king, and a lion-headed goddess (Sekhet). The adjoining in-
seription runs: 'Bringing of the tribute by the good god (Le. the king)
for his father Ra, when he came out of the land Kheta, annihilating the
rebellious lands and smiting the enemies in their dwellings, with silver,
gold, kheshet (lapis-lazuli), mafek (malachite), and precious stones, as
the conquest of every land had been commanded him'. Between the two
last pillars in this hall is a stele of the 35th year of Ramses 11., on which,
beneath a relief, is a long decree in favour of King Ramses, issued by
the god Ptah Totunen. This decree was repeated almost word for word
by Ramses IU, on the pylon of the temple of Medinet Habu.

The other chambers of this temple are less interesting, and
their examination is rendered troublesome by the swarms of bats
that fly against the lights. They contain only the usual scenes of
offerings, most of them unfinished. As the accompanying plan
(p. 332) shows, two parallel chambers (P1. 0, N) run off from the
N. side of the main hall, while from the ends of the back wall lead
two oblique passages (Pl. K, G), from each of which run two parallel
chambers (Pl, L, M, and Pl. B, 1). Round the walls of these latter
Phambers run stone benches, less than 3 ft. high. In the SW.
chamber (P1. 1) is the picture of an altar with a hieratie inscrip-
tion. Directly behind the main hall (Pl, F) is a smaller hall (Pl. E;
36 ft. broad, 25 ft. deep), with four pillars. On the N. and S. walls
are depicted the boats with the shrines of IIarmaehis and Ammon,
borne in each case by 20 priests. Three doors lead hence to a long
narrow chamber (Pl. B), at the back of which are three recesses
(Pl. A, C, D). In the central recess, the sanctuary, stands an altar,
