occupied by a continuous representation of the vault of heaven,
embraced by the long extended figure of Nut, with the twelve hours
of the day (CD) and thew, of the night, (pk). At the end are two ce-
lestial charts, and tables of the culmination of stars during the
hours of night, from fortnight to fortnight throughout tho year. (Si-
milar tables are found in Tomb G.) The results are arranged on the
different parts of a human figure. Biet, the French astronomer,
used these tables in calculating the date of their formation. - ffl
First small antecha1uber. To the left ". picture of the serpent Kheti,
darting fire against fettered forms; demons stand upon it. In the
second row are persons 'bathing and swimming' in Nun, Le. the
ocean, and also souls praying. To the right: Disc, serpent, and at
the left angle a curious representation of Seb; then (in the left
angle) the serpentrearing up, and 'this great god' in ithyphallic re-
presentation. V. First Room with Pillars, considerably deeper than
the preceding. In the corner to the right, the heat. of the sun upon
the hands of Nut; above the door [twice] Osiris and the king offer-
ing sacritice. Under the roof, Nut. - The bodies of two gigantic,
winged serpents with crowns stretch hence down into the following
room; to the left is Hebent, with the double crown, to the right,
Mersekhet , princess ofAmenthes, with the crown of Lower Egypt.
-- Y1. and VH. are two farther corridors. The representations in
the former are so mystit- as to defy description. The latter con-
tains gods, serpents, boats, the moon C), and, above the door, a
hitherto unexplained figure. - VIII. Second small anteehamber,
with inscriptions: the king before Ma, the goddess of Truth, and
Chap. 125 of the Book of the Dead. - *LY. Room, a large hall, of
which the corner pillars remain unfinished. The sarcophagus placed
in the centre is destroyed. On the pillars appears the king praying
to various gods. This has been called the Hall of Astronomy, Ion
account of the representations on the 1tof,whiul1 have been executed
with the greatest skill and with incredible labour and trouble. We
here see, twice, the goddess Nut, with stars and gods, who sail in
boats on the lake of the heavens. The deities of the hours also
appear, with curious symbols beside them. Next the entrance is the
sky by day, towards the back wall, the sky by night. The imagi-
nation of the artist who designed this ceiling-painting was lieen-
tions, as the immodest representations in the left angle indicate.
On the long wall to the right, above , are the Hours, looking
behind them, and each casting; en the one preceding a ray from
the disc on her head. Then follow the most varied forms of
the light-ged, the selar-dise, the stars, etc.; and finally an inter-

esting* tepresentation ofthe boat efthe Il)). accompanied by Khepra

and Tum, being drawn on the waters of Nun er the celestial ocean
ever the eastern Aker or lion of the horizon, and sinking from the
western, being received by Tatunen. The Arabs call this the Shelltl
