preferred sandstone to limestone and even to the harder but more easily
disintegrating granite. For substructures, however, and for walls
surrounded with earth 'they wisely gave the preference to limestone.
- The hills on the two banks of the river approach so close together
at Gehel Silsileh that they have justly been compared to the pillars of a
.gigantic Egateway. The legend of the chain that once barred the passage
of the river here is probably pure invention, taking its rise from the
Coptic name of the city of quarries, which in the hieroglyphics isn amed

Pa Fhersnu. The later Egyptians named the town so2 soft Le. sae-
Jies, claustrum, barrier, probably in reference to the gorge of the river.
The Romans, who maintained a garrison here, converted the Tel t'el of
the Egyptians into Silsili, which was confounded by the Arabs with
Silsileh, the Arabic for 'cuain'. The people, seeking meanings for every
name and preferring those that come in the guise of a legend, thereupon
invented the story ofa chain, that once barred the gorge at Gebel Siisileh.
By and by the very place where this mythical chain had been fastened
came to be pointed out. -

The dhahabiyehs generally halt in the very midst of the men-
uments. We turn first to the N., ascend a well-beaten track, and
then gradually descend the rocky hill. On the slope beside the river
are some tomb-like Recesses, belonging to offieials of the 18th
Dyn., with the names of Tutmes III. and his sister Hatasu over the
entrance. In one of these, the surface of which is divided into
squares, some of the figures are sketched but left unfinished.
Farther ou is a cave with a painted ceiling. Beside it are in-
svriptions of the time of Ramses IH., builder of Medinet Ilabu,
who is represented before Ammon, Muth, and Khmisu. There is
also a larger memorial tablet of the 2lst year of Sheshenk 1.
(22nd Dyu.) Sheshenk had commanded his architect IIoremsat to
quarry stones at Silsileh for the gateway erected by the king on
the S. side of the first court of the temple of Ammon at Karnak.
Immediately to the N. is a Stele bearing various conventional phrases

‘i‘Rock Chapel (Speos), which may be reckoned among the most
important monuments in the Nile valley, Oil account ofits reliefs
and inscriptions. This chapel, hewn in the rock close to the sum-
mit of a hill, dates from the 18th Dyn. In front are five doorways,
separated from each other by pillars at varying distance, and crowned
with the astragal and concave cornice. Numerous gods are named
in it. Sebek, who forms a triad with Ammon-Ra and Muth, takes
the first Plare; Ptah of Memphis is also mentioned. King Horus is
here spoken of as the beloved of the Anka-t(0nkaj, 'Mistress of
Asia', and this Egyptian-Phoenician goddess is represented with a
head-dress, elsewhere only found on the heads of Asiatic warriors.

The Interior consists of a broad but shallow vaulted chamber, at the
back of which is an oblong mom. All the walls are covered with carving
sand inscriptions. Lyn the ti. wall is the Uvarus goddess, offering the breast
to the infant king Horus, while above her head hovers the vulture of
