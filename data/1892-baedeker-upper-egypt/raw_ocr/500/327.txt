Temple. EDFU. 2.3. Route. 251

served here. - A Side-door (Pl. i) in the E. wall of the hypostyle
admits to the open passage between the temple and the girdle-wall.

The Ceiling of this hall, which, like that at Denderah, is named
Khent, 'the front room' or Khent ur, 'the great anteehamber', is
completely revered with astronomical representations.

To the left are the tirst six Hours of Night, to the right the second
six (Champul1ion, Non. 11. pp. 123 seq.). Above the deer to the following
Hall D is a curious representation. The Sun Disc appears with the figure
of a crowned beetle ascending from the horizon into a boat guided by
Her Mai and Ear Irhent khrud. Next the sun, on the left, is Thom, ou the
right Net'th, and also Apheru (Anubis), JIM, and Harbor. In an attitude
of worship, at the sides, are Four 'Senses; to the right the eye and ear
(Le. sight and hearing), to the left taste (symbolized by a tongue) and
reason. At the top of this wall is a long, astronomical frieze. First
appear figures of the 36 'gsecani', at the end of which are the chief con-
stellalions of the ti. (Orion and the Semis Cow or Swim) and of the N.
(the bult's leg fettered by Ape), then come the Planets, the kitair with the
Fourteen tyeps of the waxing moon, the gods corresponding to those lunar
days, representative? of the ifi/ Days of Me Month, the Gods qr the 12
Months, and tinally three Female Figures with raised handst.

On the J'. Wall of this hall, on either side of the door to Hall D,
are scenes from the Founding of the Temple by the king, similar to those
at Denderah. They are continued along the W. wall of the hall.

Next, as at Demlerah, follow three Presekos Halls, with their
side-chambers, and here also the first of these, the Hat or Festat
Hall (P1. D) is much the largest. This hall is the only one of the
three that has columns, of which there are 12 arranged in three
rows, while the corresponding hall at Denderah had only 6 columns.
The side-chambers, however, are more numerous atDenderah, where
there were six, three on each side, while here there are but four,
viz. the Laboratory (Pl. XVII) and a Passage Room (VI. XVIII) in
front of it, on the W. side, and on the E. side another Passage Room

Pl. srs), in the S. wall of which is a deer leading to a Corner
Room JI. XXI). The next of the prosekes halls is the Halt ofthe
Altar (Pl. U), with two side-chambers (Pl. xrv on the IT. and
Pl. XVI en the fl.), whence we reach the two great staircases lead-
ing to the roof of the temple. Both the structure of the staircases
and their plastic adornment closely resemble those at Denderah.
Front the third and last I'rosekos hall, the 'Hull of the Centre' or
of the 'A'epose of the tiods' (P1. ll.), we enter en the right the two
connected 'L’ooms for the U/fering ofwltat is necessary" (Pl. XII & Kilt),
and en the left the 'floorn ofKhern' (Pl. x1). We now reach the
Sekes Rooms. The h'utwtuury (Pt. A) in the centre is, like the
sanctuary at Deuderah, surrounded on all sides but the front by a
Corridor P1. e), from which JO Side-Chant/vers Open JI. I-VI en the
left or W., TII-N en the right or E. side). On the inside wall of
the corridor, i.e. 0n the outside of the sanctuary, are represented
the gods of the distrirts or nemes. - All these rooms, their size
and use, their plastic decorations, the painting , gilding , etc. are
fully 'les,cribed in the inscriptions and in the reliefs.
