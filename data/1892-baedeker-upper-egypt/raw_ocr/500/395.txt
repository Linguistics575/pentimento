is again the king's son Ammemapt. An Egyptian hears a pole with rings
and skins, and then in both rows approach negroes, some bound and
others free, with all kinds of animals - monkeys, a girall'e, antelopes,
a lion, cows with twisted horns, greyhounds, ostriches, and panthers.
The negroes are unmistakable, not only On account of the swartuy hue
of their skins but also on account of their excellently reproduced facial
characteristics. Another scene shows us the king in his chariot, followed
by his sons, among whom Khaemus appears (lower row), launching an
arrow against the tleeing negrues, some ofwhom are already prostrate on
the ground. The wounded father is brought back to his wife and chil-
dren, and a meal is cooked for him. A monkey sits upon one of the trees
peculiar to this region, with heart-shaped leaves and fascicular fruit.

These scenes serve as excellent illustrations to the life of king se-
soGsis (Ramses IL), as related by lliodorus (L 53 seq.) Sesoosis was first
sent by his father with an army into Arabia, and succeeded in Suhduing
the people of that land, hilherto invincible. He was then despatched to
the W. regions and made himself master of the greater part of Libya,
while still but a youth, On his father s death he assumed the kingdom.
Ile prepared a mighty armament and marched that (I. 55) to the In. against
the Ethiopians. He conquered the country and imposed upon it a tribute
of ebony, gold, and ivory.

The temple proper, hewn in the rock, is entered by three doors.
The central and highest, is rounded at the top; the smaller doors
to the right were obviously not made until after the wall had been
covered with sculptures. 0n the inner side of both of these side
doors is Jlam,ses represented as a traveller, with a long staff, and
saying 'I come to thee, Ammon-lla, I am thy son , ete.' 0n the
bank of the two entrance-pillars is the king receiving the symbols

of life from Horus, lord of o Mam (the name of a temple

near Dakkeh), and on the right from Tum. The two representations
on the right and left of the entrance-wall are unusually fine; on
the left the king holds a negro (Kush), and on the righto Tehennu,
by the hair, and smites them with his weapon. In earâ€˜h case the
single enemy symbolizes the entire nation; so that the inscription
beside the right seene reads: pet pet ment mehet, 'he smites the
people of the N.' The architrave supported by two columns has a
tine effect. The Dorie columns are fluted, and the abacus bears the
name of Ramses H. (similar columns at the tombs of lienihasan,
see p. 1'3). The builder's inswriptior1 is 011 the arrhitrave. In the
right half the king is relied a son of Khnnm, who formed himself
on the potter's wheel with his own hand (lihnum is the creator of
men J. In the left half are the words: 'The king of the L'nmtznez-
ms, the true defender (Gr. Setter), who sacrifices to the cycle of
the gods, built the temple for his father's father, and renewed the
buildings of the temple'. Hy Wther's father' the god lihnum may
be meant or the king's actual grandfather Ramses I. On the right
side-wall liam<es 11., mmdueted by Anuke, proffers wine to khnum
and Sati, the gods of the cataracts; and on the left wall he otters
incense to Horus, lord of "eheni [Oppodte Widi l.lalfah, p. 3'11},
and to Isis-Sell; with the scorpion on her head. On the baek-wall
similar homage is paid to Ammon-lla. In the recess on the right
