the Bisharin, adjoining these, and the Hadendoah farther to the S.
These tribes inhabit the region known as the Etbai. Lepsius ascribes
to the ancestors of the 11fegah the numerous inscriptions that are
found as far up as Meroé, both in picture-writing resembling
Egyptian hieroglyphics and in a demotie alphabetic writing; which
suggests an independent literature. A different view is held by
H. Brugsch, who has made within the last few years the first attempt
to decipher these Merditic-Ethiopian inscriptions, as they are called.
He inclines to the opinion that they have some connection with
the Nubian tonguet Three Nubian dialects are recognized, ae-
cording to their geographical distribution, the Xmas, Mahas, and
Dongoluh. The first is spoken in the district between Assuén and
Setnt'ah, where it is succeeded by an Arabic strip, at the beginning
of the desert-routes to Abu Earned on the S. and to Wédi '0ltllii
on the E. Thence to Hannek, above the third cataract, the Mahas
idiom prevails, while the Dongolah dialect is spoken from Hannek
throughout the province of Dongolah to Gebel Dégah. The most N.
and the most S. of these dialects have a closer affinity with each
other than either has to the central Mahas, a fact explained by
Dioeletian's transference of the Dongolese inhabitants of the oasis
of el-Ehirgeh to the district above Assuén (p. 302). The Mahas
apply the name Oshkir to both the N. and S. dialects.

P As we leave Philm (Shelli1l, p. 279), we have a fine view of the
pylons of the temple of Isis and the other buildings, and of the
rocks of the island of Bigeh. On both sides ot the river rise lofty
granite cliffs. To the left, the ruins of ei-Meshhed and then the
tomb of a shékh. Beyond Bigeh lies the island of el-Hesseh, se-
parated from the IT. bank by a rocky channel. At er-Gut; our

, Two elaborate works have appeared on the Nubian language: One
by Reinisch, Die Nuba-Spraehe, I. That], Grammatik und Texte, IL Theil,
hTUiseb-Deutsehes und Deutiseh-Nuhisehes W6rterbueh. Vienna. 1879
(not absolutely reliable for pronuneiMion and quantities); the other, by
R. Lepsius, Nuhisehe Grammatik, with an introduction oIt the peoples
and languages of Africa, Berlin, 1880. To the latter important book, a
most instructive and valuable work, our description is considerably in-
debted.
