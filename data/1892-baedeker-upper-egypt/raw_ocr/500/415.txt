Nehi', In the recess at the end of the cave Tutmes IH. sits between
Horus and Sati. Immediately to the left is the second cave (about
10 ft. deep), much less skilfully executed, in which appear ten
persons before Pctmces. Among these are Setau, prince of Kush
(whose name is found elsewhere in Nubia), and a number of scribes
and officials.

The third cave, which lies a little higher up, also shows the
cartouehe of Tutmes III. The recess contains the somewhat roughly
executed flgures of four seated personages; to the right the king
and Sati, to the left the king and Horns, lord of Mim.--The fourth
cave (from the S.) is the most important. It belongs to Amen-
hotep 11., who appears conducted by Horus, lord of Beheni, to a
row of gods including Khnum, Sati, and Amlke, the gods of the
cataracts, and Horus, Ilathor, and Heben. - To the S. of [(aer
lhrim a few stele< are found, one showing a victorious. king in his
war-chariot.

The mountains presently retire, leaving room for a strip of culti-
vated land. Numerous Srilciyehs or water-wheels are seen. To the
left (E.) appears the village of Djimeneh, beside a pretty wood.
Farther on, on the same bank, lies Toshlceh (Nubian 'Three Moun-
tains’), a small place among palms, with a somewhat uneivilized
population. At Toshtceh er-Cntarb, on the W. bank, 7 M. from the
river, a large force of dervishes was defeated with the loss of their
cannon by the British on Aug. 3rd 1859; several thousand slain
were left on the battle-field, and their weapons and clothing were
sold by the neighbouring natives. Cook‘s tourists may visit the
battle-field if they desire it.

The district we next enter upon is very monotonous and almost
uninhabited; and navigation is rendered t1ifficult by rocks. To the
left lie Guryuruli and three shtkbs' tombs 3 then the villages of Oebiit
and Feraig. The river-bed becomes very wide at places. 011 the
right we catch sight of the colossi that guard the temple of Ahn-
Simbel.

35. The Rook-Temples of Abu-Simbel.

Cook's tourist-steamers usually reach Abu-Simbel in the evening of
the third day, in time to permit of a visit to the, temples before night.
Next morning they proceed to Wiidi I.lalfah. (tn the return-voyage they
again spend the night at Abu-Simbel, starting next morning at {I or
10 o'eloek.

The two temples of Abu-Simbel ('Father of the Ear ot' Corn')
lie a short distance apart at the foot ofa precipitous elilf close to the
W. bank of the Nile. No other temple in Egypt produces so unex-
pectedly grand an effect as the great rock temple of Ramses Il.,
especially by moonlight. By itself it would repay the trouble of
the ascent from Phitae. both by the dignity of its sculptures and by
