342 Route 34. with: HALFAII.

the island of Kenisub, at the beginning of the rapids, or more safely
on land by donkey or the quicker and more agreeable camel. Tra-
vellers by land must cross to the opposite bank. The British com-
mandant will on request kindly telephone to the fort opposite to
have the necessary camels in readiness; but donkeys must be taken
from the E. bank. The route at first skirts the stream, passing the
above-mentioned temple of Horus of Beheni, then turns inland
towards the mountain ridge, finally ascending with considerable
steepness to a plateau, where the donkeys or camels are left. The
summit of the hill is reached on foot in about 5 min. more after a
somewhat steep climb. A rock on the stop bears the names of some
famous travellers, including that of Champollion. The view of the
broken cataract, which extends for 5 M., is very interesting. The
stream here forces its way through ferreous sandstone, not through
granite as at Assutn. The boulders at the foot of the rock are
coated with dark ferreous Nile mud. The view southwards to the
blue hills of New Dongolah is not less attractive, and kindles the
desire to visit Upper Nubia, which contains numerous most inter-.
esting antiquities between this point and Eharttun. We think of
the temples of Soleb and Sesebi, the temples and pyramids of Gebel
Barkal, the fifteen pyramids of Nuri, Meme with its group of py-
ramids, and the temples of Nayah and el-Jfe.saurtrt. All these, how-
ever, are at present forbidden regions for the tourist. At most he
may visit the ancient fortresses of Semneh and Kummeh, situated
in the Batn el-I.1ager (belly of stones), 37 M. from Widi Talfah.
These contain buildings of the 12th Dyn. and the remains of two
temples built by Tutmes 111.; and they are interesting also for the
records of the height of the Nile under the 12th Dyn., which show
that 2600 years before Christ the, Nile rose about 25 ft. higher than
it does to-day.

To visit these spots we take the railway to (23 M.) Sigaja C?, hrs.;
see p, Mi), thence proceed by donkey to (12 M.) Smâ€˜ras and (10 M.) Kum-
meh. Semneh, on the opposite bank, is reached by boat or by one of the
native rafts made of palm-logs. The expedition from Wiidi I.1alfah and
back takes 2-3 days. Permission from the military authorities is neces-
sary, and is somewhat unwillingly granted as Semneh lies beyond the lines.

It is much to be hoped that the time will soon come when the
way will be open as far as Eharttun, which fell into the hands of
the Mahdists on Jan. 27th 1885 , when the brave Gordon met his
death. The possession of Jfhartphn and the security not only of the
Nile-route thither but also of the desert-route from Berber to Sui-
kim are the necessary conditions for the gradual eivilization of the
Siidin.
