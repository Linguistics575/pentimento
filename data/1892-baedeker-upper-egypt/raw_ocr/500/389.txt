on the second doorway, about 50 ft. farther back, appears the
winged sun-disc.. The second pylon shows a much damaged Greek
inscription of Ptolemy Philometor and his consort. In a straight
line, 21 ft. farther, is a third pylon; and 49, ft. beyond that is the
small temple proper (65 ft. deep and 40 ft. broad), with a side-
chamber on the left (so side. The temple-facado, with its four
columns, was thrown down in 1868 by earthquake, which also
destroyed the first room. The latter contained a dedication from

Dakkeh (p. 316), was one of the dynasty of native kings who
reigned in Nubia during the period of the Ptolemies and the Roman
emperors. On each of the sides (right and left) of this apartment
are eight scenes in two rows one above the other, representing King
At'kheramon making offerings to the gods of the place, Osiris, Isis,
and Horus, and to the gods of the region of the cataracts. The
sanctuary behind contains a granite naos, broken in two, dating
from Euergetes II. Physkon and Cleopatra.

A stele of the 12th dyn. (ltanubkan Amenemha 11.), found here
and now in the Berlin museum, proves that Debét must have been a
very early settlement. The Roman Parentboleff'ortiiied ramp; p. 292)
must have been situated in this neighbourhood, for in the Itine-
rarium Antonini, a list of Roman military stations, the distance
from (Contra) Syene to Parembole is gis en at 161toman miles or
about 12 Eng. miles. As a matter of fact, the remains of an ancient
fortitication are found near Debét.
