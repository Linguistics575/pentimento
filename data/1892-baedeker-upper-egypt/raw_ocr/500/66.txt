14 Route 1. BENIHASAN. From Cairo

in its Egyptian oounterparti. The columns of Benihasan consist,
like the Dorie column, of a basis, an octagonal or sixteen-sided
shaft with 16 or 20 flutes, a capital, and an abacus. The eehinus
er chymatium is, however, wanting. While the swelling or entasis
on some Doric columns, and also the annuli or rings at the top of
the shaft, have hitherto met with no sufficient explanation, the
same features appear as natural and necessary parts of the so-called
'plant column' ofEgypt. The architects of the Nile aimed consciously
at a reproduction of the stem of a plant, and as the capitals repre-
sented a bunch of buds it was natural that the cords which fastened
them should not be absent. Their number is five; and the 3 or
5 annuli at the top of a Dorie column, erroneously explained as in-.
cisions made for the ropes used in hoisting it to its place, are
simply an inheritance fiom the Egyptian column. The idea of the
annuli, as of the entire Dorie column, is of Egyptian origin, though
the perfect Greek column, with the beautiful transitiou-member
formed by the eehinus, is far from a mere imitation. 'The Greek
column has become an entirely new form, animated by a new prir1-
ciple proper to itself, which has thoroughly mastered the hetero-
geneous elements from without and blended them in a new unity.'
In farther emphasis of the importance of these columns in the hi-
story of art, we may remind the reader that the earliest Dorie col-
umns known to us date from about the time that the Psamtikidae
(p. xxix) were not only allowing the Greeks to enter the valley of
the Nile but were inviting them to settle there, and that the col-
umns of Benihasan are 1500 years older than this. The columns of
Benihasan are indeed nothing more than the pillars in the Temple
of the Sphinx and the Mastaba (Paedeker's Lower Egypt, pp. 365,
379) provided with flutes and ehamfered edges.

The two tombs of chief interest, the farthest to the N., are easily
recognised by the beautiful polygonal columns at their entrances.
The donkey-drivers make directly for them, paying no attention to
the others. The numbering begins at the N. end.

Tomb I. The exterior of the pronaos or vestibule is distin-
guished by two fine octagonal columns, bearing a flat vault hewn
out of the rock. Four sixteen-edged columns, with narrow fluting,
stand in the interior of the tomb-chamber and appear to bear the
three beautifully painted arches of the ceiling, which are hewn in
the form of shallow barrel vaulting. The side-columns touch the
right and left walls of the nearly square chamber, in the rear of
which opens a recess containing the statues (much dilapidated) of
the deceased and his two wives. The usual long shaft leading to
the bottom of the tomb and the chamber for the corpse at the end
of it are also present. This is the tomb of Amenemha or Ameni,

, Some details on this matter will be found in the section devoted
to Egyptian art in the first volume of this Handbook (p. 160).
