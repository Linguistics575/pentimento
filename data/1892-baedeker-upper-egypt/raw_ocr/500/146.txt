trances, one from IIalI D, the other from without. According to
the exterior marginal inscription this was the room set apart for the
libations, and the door from the outside is named in an inscription
on its exterior, 'the portal for the entrance of the priest of the
libations, with the ewer for the Mistress of the gods'. This room
also has an interesting geographical representation on the lower
part of the wall, in which seven water-districts of Lower Egypt,
conducted by the ruler ofLower Egypt, are seen approaching Hathor
and Horus. - The third room (Pl. xxnr) on this side is named in
the marginal inscriptions 'the room for the Mistress in the town
of the House of Hathor', 'the room of the hall that lies behind the
hall of the altar', and 'the divine hall of the Golden One, the
daughter of the sun, (lying) on the left side, where the left stair-
case (is situated)'. The chief exit from this room leads into HallD,
while another smaller door (to the left of the entrance) admits to
a narrow passage communicating at one end with the Hall of the
Altar (Pl. CO, and at the other with the Staircase (p. 91) leading
hence to the roof. Farther on this passage leads to the â€˜ChiefFestal
Room' (Pl. XIII; comp. p. 94). Mariette included Room XXIII in
the suite of festal chambers, because it has direct communication
with the festal Hall XIII and Rooms xrv and xv lying behind the

temple-wail states that the ceremonies of the 'offering of the divine
things' (saeritiees) were carved in this room, along with the gods of
the saerifleial altar; and the W. inscription names it the 'resting-
place of the Mistress of the Goddesses'. The inscriptions on the
upper and lower margins afford additional information as to the
orginal purpose of the room, its decorations, and the festivals cele-
brated within it. The upper inscription, in the half running from
right to left, is as follows: We has built the Hall of the Altar for
the Princess adorned with the vulture and the Urzeus-erown, the
wise goddess. It resembles heaven, with its lord the sun-god. He
has richly loaded the altar for the revered goddess within it.-- The
gods are carved within it, as is seemly; the sacred offerings are
laid at the foot of her throne with the ceremonies appropriate to
the cult of IIathor. The names of the gods and the names of the
place are inscribed on one of the walls in it, and the serpent-deities
of Denderah are likewise recounted within it'. The last sentence
