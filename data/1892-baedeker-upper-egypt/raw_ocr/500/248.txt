beautiful horses. The slaughter which he causes is immense, and,
sb far as the vividness of the representation goes, may well be com-
pared with the similar subjects at Karnak and the Ramesseum,
though it is inferior in point of style.

Higher up is an inscription from the iith year of the king-, and here
also the long rows of hieroglyphics are more concerned with extolling
the king than with relating events. The war is once more against the
western peoples, the Libyans, Naxyans (Nashauasha), etc. The leaders of
the foe are the Libyan prince Kapur and his son Mishashar. The op-
ponents of Pharaoh were (according to the inscription on the N. Pylon)
utterly routed, and lost miserably both property and life, 'while the
whole earth rejoiced as it beheld the heroism of King Ramses IH.' The
world bowed before the king, who is compared to Baal, who punishes
the impious. The conquered are compared to a lloek of goats attacked
by a lion. The endless pictorial laudations of the victor are positively
wearisome, while the representations of the defeat, impotence, and over-
throw of the conquered are almost equally abundant. Finally the king
harangues the leaders of his foot-soldiers and charioteers, not forgetting
to celebrate in swelling words the deeds that he himself has done. The
number of prisOners and slain (the latter with their hands, ete., cut off')
is recorded. Une of the lists accompanying the inscription includes one
prince of the 31aOauasha, 5 superior oifieers, 1205 common soldiers, 152
inferior officers, 131 young men, 1494 in all. Also 3i2 women, 65 young
women, 15t girls, 558 in all. These figures give a total of 2052 persons.
Besides these 2175 Mashauashti were slain by the king in their ranks.
The total loss of the enemy was thus not more than 4227 persons. The
number of captured swerds, bows, chariots, eta, corresponds: 115 large
swords, 12/1 smaller, 603 bows, etc.

Another series occupies the back-wall of the colounade on the right
(N.) side of the court, supported by seven pillars with the Osiris-figures
of the king. The uppermost row contains saeritieial scenes. The first of
these depicts the king, who has alighted from his chariot, shooting his arrows
against a hostile fortress oeeupied by warriors (the town Amara, recalling
the Amorites). 1n the next scene the king drags three rows of prisoners
behind his chariot. Be is congratulated by the grandees. Finally he
presents the captives to Ammon, Nuth, and Khunsu.

The inscriptions and sculptures on the Second Pylon (Pl. If),
enclosing the rear of the court, are still more interesting. To the
left are Ammon Ra and Muth, the great queen of heaven, to whom
Pharaoh, wearing a richly decorated crown, leads three rows of
captives chained together. The two upper rows have distinctly
European features, and wear embroidered aprons and low helmets.
Over the first row no name appears, but according to the inscription
before Pharaoh, they are Sholralsha, i.e. probably Sicilians. The
captives in the second row are called Tanauna or Danauna, a name
in which we are probably correct in recognizing the 'Danai', or
Hellenes of the Trojan era. The third row, in which the individual
figures resemble those of the other two, is accompanied by the
following inscription: 'Provide breath for our nostrils, 0 king, son
of Ammon, say the foes from Pulasataâ€™. In these Pulasata we must
recognize the Philistines, new and no contemptibie foes of Egypt.

On the Right Wing of the second pylon is another long in-.
scription devoted to the deeds of the king in the 8th year of his reign.

Here also facts are obscured by empty titles and elaborate trifles,
recited in praise of the king, 'His form, his limbs', runs the faftl1 line,
'have been weighed in the balances of Real; he commands the multitude;
