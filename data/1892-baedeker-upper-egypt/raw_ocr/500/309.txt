Iavishness, the stems of which, of considerable thickness, surround the
top of the shaft. The leaves lying against the upper part ofthe calyx are
of an exaggerated coarseness.

In connection with the whole of which they form a part, these
capitals produce an impression of great richness; while regarded
separately they may be taken as specimens of the rococo period in
Egyptian art, if the phrase may be permitted. - The Ornament on
the front and back walls is sunk into the wall (â€˜relief en prenx');
the side-walls and columns were on the other hand adorned with
bas-reliefs. - The Ceiling is occupied with a rich profusion of
astronomical representations.

The small Coptic Church in the town contains little of interest.

As in most Jacobite ehurehes, the Nave is divided into two parts by
three arches. Behind the wooden screens, which are tastefully inlaid with
ivory and mother-of-pearl, lies the sanctuary, in four parts. The figures
of the saints are poor and comparatively modern. They represent St. George
and the dragon, St. Michael, the Madonna and Child, and an Ascension.

The Palace of the Khedive (Knew Efendinah), built by Mohammed
'Ali, lies near the Nile, to the N. of the town. The buildings, in-
cluding a handsome rotumla, are much neglected, but the gardens,
with their profusion of roses, lemorr-trees, and orange-trees, are
very attractive. The gardener, who Usually presents the visitor with
a nosegay, expects a small gratuity (about i. piastres).

The Quay on the right bank of the Nile, near the Mudirtyeh,
also contains some fragmentary inscriptions of the Roman impe-
rial epoch.

A Temple, which formerly stood about 2% M. to the N. of Esneh,
is now represented only by a few fragments of columns, which bear the
name of one of the emperors; and with it have disappeared also the
beautiful zodiac and the lists of peoples, among which Macedonians and
Persians were mentioned, This temple too was dedicated to Khnum. - An-
other temple, datiugTrom the later Ptolemies, stood on the TWbank opposite
Esneh (Contra Latopolis); hut this was demolished before 1980 and has
left not a trace behind.

Numerous memorials of an early Christian civilization are still to he
traced in the Convent of Ammonius, which is considered the oldest con-
vent in Egypt and which was certainly founded at a very early date,
possibly by the Empress Helena. The route thence from the town follows
at tirst an embankment towards the s., and then strikes off to the W.
across the fields. The Convent Library still contains numerous Coptic li-
turgical writings, some of them lying on the floor in a locked room. A
visit to the now abandoned convent, the key of which is kept by one of
the fellabin, is not without interest, for the sake both of the curious NSS.
and of the ancient paintings and Coptic inscriptions. A cruel persecution
of the Christians is said tn have taken place at Esneh under Diocletian
at the beginning of the 4th cent.; and the c0nvcnt is said to have been
founded in honour of the martyrs who suffered here. According to other
accounts the Christians expelled from 31edinet Habu by the Arabs were
massacred here. .

About 71/231. to the NN'. of' Esneh, on the road to el-Rhiirgeh (p.
MS), lies the large ruined Convent of Pachomius, with numerous elegant
mausnlca.

Esueh is sometimes selected as a starting-point for journeys to the
w. oases of Dakhel and Ehdrgeh; sce R.3

El-Irene/in, 131h,. M. to the S. of Esneh on the W. bank, where
there are ancient river-embankincuits, is perhaps the ancient Ehna-
