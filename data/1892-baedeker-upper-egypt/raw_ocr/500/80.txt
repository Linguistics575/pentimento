28 Route f, Dinah wnr,t,tupnip, From Cairo

Beyond Hagg el-liandil the Nile-voyager passes several small
villages, but neither they nor the scanty ruins of the Pharaonic
epoch near them deserve a visit.

In a ravine near el-IIatrtiah (E. bank) stands a stele with a
hieroglyphic inscription, discovered by the late Mr. Harris, British
consul at Cairo and excellently versed in Egyptian antiquities.
Farther on we skirt an island and reach the point on the W. bank,
between the villages of el- Gesireh (i.e. 'island') and tg-Jfartdurvh,
where the Baht- Yi1suf 01' Joseplt's Canal, an arm of the Nile, di-
verges from the main stream to water the agricultural districts of
the Libyan bank, the 1?aytun (p. 35) etc,. The name of Joseph, was
given to it by the Arabs, who recognise in the son of Jacob the type
of all administrators. It probably owes its regulation ifnot its origin
to Amenemha 111., of the 12th Dynasty. Extensive works are now
in progress to furnish the W. part of the Libyan bank with water
from a point higher up the Nile, near Assifo.t.

About 5 M. below the divergence of the Bahr Ytrtiut', at some
distance from the Nile, lies Dirrt1t esh-Sherif (rail. stat., p. 1).
About 11/4 ll. above ffl of) the fork, on the E. bank, are some
brick ruins, and 11/4 M. farther to the S. are the mounds of PET
el-F'uytr, probably the site of the ancient Peecla. This is the N.
boundary of the 1lftm-palms, which, however, do not attain their
full development till farther up, between Assiht and lieneh, where
we see many tine specimens (y. 70). The Arabian Mts., rising in
precipitous rocky walls, approach the river. Swallows, ducks, and
other birds inhabit the caves in the porous rock on the banks, and
fly in and out in screaming crowds. The cliffs on the right bank of
this part of the Nile are known as Gebel Abu Fédah. The stream
below them is considered the most dangerous part of the channel
between Cairo and Assutn. Violent winds blow round the erags,
and numerous sandbanks impede navigation.

The Arabs tell that a ship-master of Feneh, having safely arrived at
Billing, was asked by his friends how he bad passed the Gehel Abu Féda.
‘Quite easily', was his rejoinder, 'there's no danger there'. An old man
who overheard him remarked: 'From your own words I see that you
dn not know this mountain'. 'I know it as well as my own eyes', said
the boatman. 'When I return to Feneh I must pats it once more. If my
vessel suffers any damage in doing so, I will pay you 10,000 piastres, on
condition that you pay me the like sum if I pass safely. But I give you
due warning that 1 know the Gehel Abu Fédah perfectly wen”. The old
man accepted the wager, and the ship-master had his boat bound with
iron, engaged the rest sailors, and set forth. As he approached the Gebel
the boat was assailed at iirst by one wind, and afterwards by four storm-
winds, each blowing from a different quarter. The ship, in spite of its
iron fastenings, was cast upon the rocks and went to pieces-, and the
vainglorious re'is, as he scrambled ashore with nothing saved but his
life, Cried; ‘Gebel Abu Fédah, I never knew you till now'. Numerous
similar stories are related of these cliffs. And no wonder, for nothing
can be more mysterious and spectral than their appearance at twilight,
when the dark swarms of birds ily towards the rocks and disappear as
suddenly as if engulfed by it.

The hill contains many rock-tomhs, which have not yet been carefully
