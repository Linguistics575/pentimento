29. The Island of Philee.

Both the tourist-steamers and the mail-steamers allow one day for a
visit to Philze. Tourists by the four-weeks steamer may visit the island
twice, and they are recommended to do so. Travellers m Nubia who are
unable to tind time to visit Phila. on the outward journey, should not
fail to devote to it at least a few hours on the return, either on the
evening of reaching Shelliil, or on the next morning, after spending the
night on board the steamer. When more than one visit is paid the trar-
eller should come once hy rail, once by land returning by boat. Ae-
commodation at Philte can only be obtained if a dhahahiyeh happens to
be there.

The name of Phila, is derived from the old Egyptian, in which

it is called, with the article, Pe-alek , or usuallymere-
A CY

1y Alek . This name occurs thousands of times on the
<::CzC> G
island itself, with many variations, and probably means the island
of Lek, i.e. of Causing or of the Emit, referring to the Nile-voyage
hither from the N. The Copts called it Pilak or Petals, and the
Arabs used to call it Bilak. Now-a-days none of these names are
known to the natives, who usually call the island Anus el-. Wogad,
after the hero of one of the tales in the Thousand and One Nights,
which has undergone considerable change in the Egyptian version
and has its scene transferred to Philze.

The boatmen relate it as follows. 'Once upon a time there was a
king, who had a handsome favourite named Aims el-Wogtsd, and a vizier,
whose daughter was named Zuhr el-Ward, i.e. Flower of the Rose, The
two young people saw and fell in love with each other, and found 0ppor-
tunities of meeting secretly, until they were discovered through the im-
prudence of the maiden's attendant The vizier was violently enraged
and, in order to secure his daughter from the farther pursuit of the
young man, despatched her to the island of Philze, where he caused her

guarded. But Anas el-Wogiid could not forget his love. He forsook the
court and wandered far and wide in search of her, and in the course of
his travels showed kindness to various animals in the desert and else-
where. At last a hermit told him that he would tind Zahr el-Ward on
the island of Philte. lie arrived on the bank of the river and beheld the
walls of the castle, but was unable to reach the island, for the water all
around it was alive with Crocodiles. As he stood lamenting his fate one of
the dangerous monsters otTercd to convey him to the island on his back, out
of gratitude for the young man's previous kindness to animals. The lover
was thus able to reach the prison of his mistress, and the guards suffered
him to remain on the island. as he representedhimselftn be a persecuted
merchant from a distant land. Birds belonging to Zahr cl-\Vard assured
him that she was on the island, but he could never obtain sight of her.
Meanwhile the lady also became unahlc longer to endure her fate. Letting
herself down from her prism-window by means of a rope made of her
clothes, she found a compassionate ship-master, who conveyed her from
the island in which the lover she sought then was. Then followed another
period of search and linally the meeting of the lovers. A marriage, with
the consent of the father, ends the tale. - The Osiris Room on Philte
(p. 205) is regarded by the Arabs as the bridal-chamber. The tale in the
