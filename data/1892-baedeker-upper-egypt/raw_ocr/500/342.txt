strange feature in the landscape; and sandstone now gives place to
masses of granite on the banks and in the channel of the stream.
Farther towards the S. this rock forms the natural fortress known
as the first cataract, which consists of innumerable 1yliff's, of dark
parti-Coloured granite, among which the Nile pursues its rapid
course towards Egypt by means of many narrow channels.

When the stream is low the steamers are compelled to anchor below
Asstuin, but at other times they touch near the bazaar. Dhahabiyehs anchor
at various points, sometimes beside the island of EElephautine opposite.

Assukn, Coptic Son(Arabie, with the article, Al-Satin, Assuaj,
the steamboat terminus for the lowerNile, with a post and telegraph
office, lies on the E. bank, partly on the plain and partly on a hill,
in N. lat. 2.io 5' 30". The fertile strip here is narrow, but supports
numerous date-palms, the fruit of which still enjoys a high repu-
tation. The native inhabitants have increased under the British
occupation to about 10,000; but that number is only a fraction of
its former population, when according to Arabian authors, 110 less
than 20,000 died of the plague at one time. Some of the houses
are elegant, but the mosques do not repay a visit. The howling
1lervishes have a house here in which they meet on Fridays for
prayer. A considerable trade is carried on in the products of the
Stidin and Abyssinian, broughthither 011 camels, and shipped uortlr-.
wards by the Nile to Keneh, Assito.t, or Cairo. Among the chief ex-
ports are ostrich feathers, ivory, india-rubber, senna, tamarinds,
WHX, skins, horns, and dried dates. The steamers and dhahabiyehs
are here boarded by negroes, Nubians, and handsome Beduins,
with artistically dressed curly hair, who offer for sale ostrich feathers
and fans, silver rings and armlets, ivory hoops, weapons from Gen-
tral Africa, small monkeys, amulets, beautiful basket-work, and
aprons of leather fringe, the costume of the women of the Sridin,
which they oddly call â€˜Madama Nubia'. Grey and black ostrich
feathers are comparatively cheap " piastres == 2fr. each), larger
and perfect white feathers cost 10-20tr. apiece and upward. Tras-
ellers who desire to buy in quantity should betake themselves to
one of the wholesale dealers in the town. The bazaar is like the
bazaars of all Nile towns, but is distinguished for its excellent local
pottery of great beauty of form. Candles, porter, ale, and even
tolerable Dutch cigars may be obtained at a Turkish 'bakkal'. -
Copper money is, curiously enough, accepted very unwillingly in
Assuin and the rest of Nubia; the traveller should provide himself
beforehand with silver piastres.
