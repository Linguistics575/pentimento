At the beginning of the present century an interesting temple stood
on the site of the old town, of which the last column Was, washed away
by the Nile in 1821. Jomard, who desc1ibed this temple during the French
Expedition, when the water already lapped its foundations, foretold its
fate. The temple was dedicated by Ptolemy Philometor and his wife
Cleopatra to Antaus and was restored by Marcus Aurelius Antoninns and
his colleague Venn: (161 A.D.). This information was conveyed by a
double iii/Tai/ii,' in Greek and in hieroglyphics, over the portal. The
bulls of the hieroglyphic inscription Ra m (K1111) probably
denoted the name of the town. The temple was built of limestone and
was at least 225 ft.long, 52 ft. wide, and 5111. hivh. Its entrance fated
the 111 er The i8 columns which were arranged in 3 rows1 were 37 ft.
high, with a diameter of 271/1 ft., and ended in palm-leat'capitals. 1f the
gigantic blocks that Jomard found on the, ground w ere really parts of
the ceiling, they exceeded in size those of Karnak, which new excite
our astonishment. One of them was 32 ft, long, iii/i' ft. high and 51/1 ft.
lhick, and must have weighed at least 48 tons.

To the S. of Liam el-. liebir the bile makes a bend to the W. and
forms an island by dividing into two branches. On the w. arm (W.
bank), to the N. of the island, lies [17111 et-Cr'harbi (W. [(1111), the
seat of a rebellion in 1865, which had important consequences for
all the inhabitants of Upper Egypt and about which the Oriental
facility in forming tradition has already woven numerous legends.'
The t'elltl.tin scarcely venture to utter the name [Ahmed Tayib) of
the hero of this uprising, but speak of him with bated breath as a
Messiah, who will one day return. He is said to be still living, in
Abyssinia. High up un the S. side of the hill of J.Cru are some
more reck-tombs.

121/2 M. S&hel, 011 the W. bank, is the station for the town of
rpatitah, situated 2 M. inland, with 3000 inhab. and a frequented
cattle-market.

011 the E. bank, a little higher up, rises the Gebel Shékh el-.
Havtdeh, with ancient quarries and (high mi) tombs hewn in the
rock, the, openings of which are visible from theriver. The material
of which the temple of Antteopolis was built was procured in the
large quarries 011 the S. side of the mountain, and consists of a
hard, fine-grained, grey shell-limestone, which smells unpleasautly
when rubbed but admits of a splendid polish. - The next steaur-
boat stations are el-MtrtrylMt and Shendawin, both on theW. bank.
A large market is held in the latter every Saturday. On the E. bank
of the stream, which here encloses several islands, are some Isoek-.
tombs, without inscriptions.

201/2 M. Sohig [Hétel du Nil, 011 the river-bank; tritish and
American consular agents), on the W.bauk, has recently become
the seat of the mudir in place of Girgeh and centains a very hand-.
some goventmentt-bttildiug. The Mudiriyeh contains 521,413 inhah.
