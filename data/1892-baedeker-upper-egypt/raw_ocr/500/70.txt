18 Route 1. BENIHASAN. From Cairo

here, as it were, the advance guard of the invasion of the Hyksos,
towards the end of the l'.2th Dynasty. The Hyksos, named 'Amn'
in an inscription in the neighbouring Speos Artemidos (p. ir), con-
sisted of isolated tribes, who purchased permission to enter Egypt
by tribute, crossed its boundaries, and finally penetrated to the in-
terior. The chief Absha here bows before the. Egyptian; his sne-
eessers carried things with a high hand and bent the Egyptians
under their yoke. - The fhwk of ostriehes behind the last Amn
belongs to the series of pictures on the left side of the wall, ICC--
presenting Khnumhotep, aeeomprmied by his dogs, slaying wild
beasts with bow and arrows. Below is a floek of geese and a fowl-
ing-scene. In the second row from the foot are hulls tighting and
scenes of cattle-tending.

The S. Wall (to the right) is oecnpied by processions of servants
bringing gifts for the dead, a frequent subject in these representa-
tions, and the offering of animals in saerifiee. Before me altar is
the figure of Khnnmhotep, before another his wife lihnti, daughter
of Pent.

The traveller will find many of the above scenes new defaeecl
beyond recognition, but he should not let this Jeter him from walk-
ing a little farther to the S. and entering some of the other tombs.
That of Kheti, one of the nearest (No. 7), easily recognised l»y.the
three pairs of columns supporting the roof, contains interesting,
though half-obliterated representations of the innumerable gymnastic
and fencing exercises and games of the ancient Egyptians. Girls
are seen throwing the ball from one to another, nnd men ponder
carefully over a game of draughts. The Hunting Scenes are of
linguistic value, as the names of the different animals are written
above them. Among these was a stag, now totally effaced. Mechanv
ies are depicted at work here and elsewhere. -. Travellers who see
the tombs of the new kingdom at Thebes, after having visited the
graves of Benihasan, will be astonished at the vastness of the im-
pression made upon the life and sentiment of the Egyptians by the
Hykses period. At Benihasan everything recalls the tombs in the
Pyramids, and the subjects of representation are drawn wholly from
this earth i under the New Empire scenes of the future life and re-
presentations of the gods are also given. We should also notice that
the horse, so common in later times, never appears under the early
empire. The forms of the columns, including the beautiful lotus eapi-
tals (see Ihredeker's Lower Egypt, p. ”164), are of the greatest inter-
est. The proto-Doris column is seen herein all stages ofdevelopment.
The plain pillar, the octagonal pillar, the octagonal and sixteen-
si1led columns, with and without flntes, all occur at lienihasan side
by side and may be looked upon as practical illustrations of the
section upon the Cavern Building of the Egyptians in the intro-.
dnatien to Lower Egypt (p. {160).
