another almost illegible inscription, engraved, like a palimpsest,
above an older test and referring to Hap-Zefa; on the same side
are eartouehes of Usertesen I.

Higher 11p, to the right (NO, is a row of three tombs close to
each other, the northernmost of which has been destroyed. The
second is the Kahf el-'Asttkir, or Soldiers' Tomb, so named from
the rows of warriors on its S. wall. On the right side of this tomb
is a long and partly effaced inscription, referring not only to Kheti,
father of Tef iib, the owner of the tomb, but also to King Merikara
Ct.2th Dyn., ace. to Maspero, of the 10th or Heracleopolitan Dyn.),
in whose reign Kheti lived.

The adjoining tomb (to the left or S.; No. 3) contains a long in-
seription referring to Tef ab, a high-priest of Apheru (Anubis),
lord of Assitit. A little farther to the S. is the tomb (No. 2) of an-
other Wp-Zeta, son of Ai and headman of the district ofAtef-kheut.

The geological formation of this hill of tombs is very interesting,
especially on account of the numerous specimens of Callianasse nilotica
and other fossils found 011 its upper part. The limestone is so hard
that it emits sparks, and flints occur in eonsiderable quantity.

Among the curiosities of Assi0.t there must not be forgotten the small
piece of water standing between the river and the town, the ancient 1e-
genil of whose effect upon virgins is still half seriously related. Paul
Lucas is probably the tirst author who mentions it, and Michaelis devotes
a paragraph to it in his edition of Abulfedaâ€˜s Description of Egypt (A.
189): 'De quo stagno fingtont Siuteuses, ejus potu signa virg,initatis eripi,
nude excusatas habent novas nuptas virginitatem non prodentes, si stagni
aquam degustarunt. Felix certe inventum, nec despero tales in vicina alia-.
rmn quoque et Europae urhium, quod felix faustumque virginibus
sit, fontes'.

At Bent Mohammad el-fra/tlr, opposite Asshi.t, are several important
tombs of the 6th Dynasty, belonging to nomarchs and (probably) rele-
tives of King Pepi.

A Totm THROUGH THE Fasih1, including a visit to the Labyrinth, the
site, of Lake Moeris, the Birket eHruri1n with its abundant Wildfowl,
and the ruins in its neighbourhood, takes 6-8 days, and requires a tent,
h dragoman, and a supply of provisions. A dragoman charges 30-di) fr.
a day for each person, according to the requirements of his employers,
and for that sum he is bound to provide them with a tent, provisions
twine excepted), and donkeys, or other means of conveyance, and to
pay railway fares and all other expenses. A written contract (comp.
p. xx), specifying the places to be visited, the points where some stay is to
he made (on which occasions a reduced charge per day should be stipulated
for), and other particulars, should be drawn up before starting. Those
who intend to visit Medinet el-Fayiim and its immediate environs only,
and who do not object to rough quarters for one or two nights, may
dispense with a dragoman and a tent, but should be provided with a
moderate supply of food. An introduction to the mudir will be of great
service in enabling the traveller to procure the necessary horses or donkeys,
which the inhabitants are often unwilling to hire (comp. pp. 37, 42).

Since the completion of the railway this excursion has usually been
undertaken from Cairo, but it may also be combined with a visit to
fra1.ctitrah. It was formerly usual to visit. the Fay1hu in connection with
a journey up the Nile, but this plan entails needless expense, as the boat
and its crew have to be paid for while lying idle for several days. If,
