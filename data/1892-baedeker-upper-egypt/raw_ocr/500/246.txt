his enemies. To the left, he again receives the sceptre and leads
behind him captive island-prinees.

The INTERIOR of the pavilion can only be gained from one of
the walls of the court to our left as we enter. The attempt is not
without difficulty; and some of the rooms are not accessible at all.
In several of the apartments, are well-preserved wall-sculptures of no
little interest; e.g. in the apartment above the passage and in tho
right wing. Ramses III. is here represented in his harem. The nude
maidens with whom he is playing chess (the scene in the ruined N.
entrance-room to the right is well seen from before the fagade of the
building), or who hand to him one a fig, another a pomegranate,
another a melon, another a flower which he smells, appear from the
shape of their faces and from the arrangement of their hair to be
captive princesses rather than his own children. This supposition
is farther strengthened by the occurrence here of several 1"epresen-
tations of a distinctly immodest character.

The vicious propensities of this king are gibbeted with biting scorn
on other monuments. He himself appears to have looked with peculiar
pride upon his harem. which was rich in beauty of all kinds, and to have
immortalized its memory in his 3lemuonium. At all events his reign

marks the beginning of an epoch of luxury and immorality, upon Which
decay followed close.

After passing through the gateway a, we traverse an open Space
between the pavilion and the first pylon. Before me reach the pylon.
210ft. wide, which conceals the flrst peristyle court, we pass a num-
ber of ruined walls of baked and linhaked bricks, which belonged
to the Coptic village built within the temple. In front. to the left,
is a small Temple of Ameniritis f'2(hh Dye), to the right a block
with the cartouche of 1Neetanebus II. Behind is the temple founded
under the 18th Dyu., which we visit later (p. 184). Standing on
the rubbish heap in front of the first pylon and looking through the
gateway into the temple, our view penetrates to the last court. There
is no more remarkable perspective in Egypt.

b. Large Temple of Ramses III.

The large First Pylon (P1. C) is covered with representations-
and inscriptions. First to the right we see the Pharaoh as the Con-
queror of his enemies, and opposite is Ammon-Ra, the king of the
gods, holding in his right hand the curved sword, in his left the
sceptre, and several wall-rings surmounted by busts of their princes.
In the first we read the name of Punt or Arabia, which, how-
ever, must be here interpreted in a narrow sense, as equivalent to
the coastlands of the Red Sea. Between the king and the group of
his enemies is the inscription: 'He strikes to the earth the princes
of all lands'. beneath which is a horizontal row of figures of some
tribes (partly damaged). Beneath that again is the chief Inscription,
from the 11th year of the king, relating his great deeds.

All the inscriptions in Medinet Habu differ from the reports of vie-
tories under the 18th and 19th Dyn., by their extravagant titles of honour,
