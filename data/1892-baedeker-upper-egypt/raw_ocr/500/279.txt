the roof extends the double body of Nut, apparently supported on the
left by Shu. The visitor should observe the constellations on the body
of the goddess of the sky, the demons of the constellations, the three
crocodiles (one sitting on the back of another) and, farther down, the tables
of the hours. The goddesses of the hours have iii's'dGiii (too broad) faces.
The roof is vaulted. The sarcophagus is 10 ft. long, 6 ft. broad and
7112 n. high, and is adorned with representations. In the next corridor
are inscriptions: 'O ye gods of the deep' , and 'Doorkeepers of the tomb',

etc. Then follows a representation of the boat of Khnum above the double
1ion.To the left of the praying king are the words 'Nay the coming in and
the going, out be blessed , recalling a similar Christian wish. In the room

behind is a representation of the mummy of the king ,repeated17

A representation of the tomb of Ramses IV., giving the dimensions,

who has four rams' heads, to the sun- god, and to Mersekhet. In the
last chamber is a wide and deep shaft, in which perhaps eoffins still are
to he found though p.robahly already plundered by the fellahin. In the
Second Corridor, as in many other: tombs, above ground, are niches
sunk in the rock, and generally bearing a long series of gods or demons.
They served probably as depositories for vessels, canopi, etc.
