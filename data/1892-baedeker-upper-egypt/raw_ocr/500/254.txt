formerly supported by 24 columns in drows of six, of which the cen-
tral row was considerably thicker than the others. The roof, however,
haslong fallenin,anilnothing remains ofthe columns save the plinths
and the lower part of the shafts. Two smaller chambers follow,
with four eo11ples ofcolumns, and then a Central Apartment with four
pillars. On both sides these are adjoined by a series of rooms(comp.
P1.), of which those to the N. are accessible, those to the S. covered
with rubbish except the two front apartments (P1. g). A special
door leads from the eelennaded hall to the latter, which are arranged
differently from those on the N. These rooms have been carefully
examined by Prof. Diirnichen; and from the inscriptions in and near
them they are now known as the TREASURY of this Memnonium of
Ramses III. Even on the external walls of these apartments are
artisticrepresentations ofvases, jars, and other vesselsin the precious
metals.

The INTERIOR of the treasury eensists of a halt turned towards the N.,
adjoined on each side by two chambers. The inseripiicms Withuut exception
relate to the gifts of gold, silver, electrum, lapis-lazuli, malachite and
ether stones which Ramses III. extravagantly heaped upon Ammon, so
that 'the offering of his gifts found 110 end'. Even those visitors who do
not understand the inscriptions will at once recognize that they are in tt
tve'asuve-house, from the representations which adorn all the walls, especiaily
those of the chambers 0n the right. The hieroglyphic rm nub means

gold and nub hez white gold or silver. Whole heaps of these metals

are seen lying in grains 0r nuggets. Sacks of gold from different lands and
all kinds of preuiuus vessels meet the eye. Pieces of lapis-lazuli and
malachite shaped like bricks are built 111) in stepped masses, each in three
rows. Arabian indiarubber (Kami) and the tree whence it is obtained are
also depicted. 111 the chambers 011 the right appear also sheets of silver,
and plates of brass and lead. The Pharuah boasted ceaselessly that he
had titted the tveasure-house of his father Amman; and the god Theth
(in the, second chamber to the right) writing reckons it by the countless
hundreds of thousands and tens of thousands (a million altogether) in
silver, gold, brass, Japis-lazuli, malachite from Reshata (Sinai Peninsula),
ete., which he has offered to his venerable father Ammon-Ra, king of the
gods, Who on his side has accorded to the king the periods of Ra and the

years of Tum. - It is impossible net to reeatl the passage in Diodorus's ,

description of the Mini) of Osymandyas (p. 159), in Which the king is
represented as offering to the. divinity gold and silver to the value of 32
million minae.

Ramses IH. was 110 ether than the rich Rhampsinitns of Herodotus
(11, 1â€˜21); and it is not impossible that we here stand before the very
Treasure-house of Ilhttnosirsitus which fsgures in the pleasant tale narrated
by the Father of IIistm-y.

Ithampsinitus the Pharaoh was possessed of such vast treasures that
he Cmnmanded a builder to erect for their safe custody a stone building
beside the palace. The architect coveted the treasures, and being a cunning
man so arranged a stone in the wall that two men, or indeed one, eould
easily withdraw it. Before his death he imparted the secret to his sons.
These immediately (m the death of their father betoek themselves to the
treasure-house, removed the stone, and favoured by the darkness of night,
succeeded in carrying olf , large amount oftreasure. They repeated their
visits, until the king remarked that his treasure was decreasing, without,
however, being able to accuse anyone of the theft, as he invariably found
the seals unbroken and the doors fast looked. He accordingly had a trap
