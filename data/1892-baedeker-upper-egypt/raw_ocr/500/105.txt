was eanonised on April 23rd, 303 A.D. ; and even as early as the
5th and 6th cent. we find him a favourite saint of the Egyptians.
Leo Africanus says that the Coptic brothers of St. George at Girgeh
were very wealthy and tells how they provided travellers with
what was necessary on their journey and sent rich gifts for the poor
to the Patriarch at Cairo. To this day several of the Coptic families
at Girgeh are very rich, possessing large estates; preeminent among
these is that of Bothrus. The town looks very picturesque as seen
from the river. The Nile makes a sharp bend here, and the effect
is as if the W. bank, on Which the town stands, was atright angles
to the E. bank. The Arabian mountains rise like walls, and the
four tall minarets of the town, on the opposite bank of the Nile,
seem to vie with them in height. A picturesque group on the
river-brink is formed by an old and dilapidated mosque and a tall
minaret beside it. Many of the houses in the town are built of
burnt brick and decorated with glazed tiles. The bazaar resembles
those of other Nile towns.---- From Girgeh to Abydos (rArstbat el-
Mailiintel0, 12-13 M., see below.---At Mesha'ilc, on the E. bank,
above Girgeh, scholars will find interesting remains of a temple
bearing the names of Amenhotep III. and Ramses 11. Some very
ancient graves of priests of This have also been found there.

8 M. Beli/ineh, on the W. bank, is a mail-station and the start-
ing-point from Which passengers', on both the 'three weeks' and
the 'four weeks' steamer make the excursion to Ahydos (see below).

A. Abydos.

Ir'eli/lnels is now the usual starting-point for a visit to 'Ardbat
ei-jlhul/7tneh (Abydos), which lies about 8% M. to the s.w., in-
land from the river. This highly interesting excursion, whieh should
on no aerount be omitted, involves a ride of 12, hrs. (there and back
4 hrs.). The donkeys at Beliineh are hail and provided only with
loose rugs or straw-mats instead of' saddles, and those at Girgeh
are he better. At Ahydos aeeommodation may be obtained in the
house of Salibeh, keeper of the antiquities.

The track crosses the large Canal of RÃ©mmeh, traverses a fertile
district dotted with numerous villages, and finally leads ever part
of the Libyan Desert. Fine view of the mouutaiu-rshain running
towards the Nile. The ancient Abydos lay in advanve of this chain,
on a site which may confidently be called the cradle of the earliest
line of the Pharaohs.

Menes, the tlrst king of Egypt, is said to have been a Thinite, t'.e. an
inhabitant of the Home of This (Egypt. Toni). Adolf Schmidt, in his
'Forsehurrgen auf dem Gehiet des Alterthums', tries to pruve that This
(Tenn lay near el-Eherheh, a. little to the N. of Abydes, while Poeoeke
seeks it at et-Birheh (the temple}, 3 M. to the W. of Hirgeh (comp. p. 52).
