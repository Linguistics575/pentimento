Colossi of Memnon, and the Ramesseum, and on the other side of

18. The Tombs of Sh√©kh cAbel el-Kurnah.

With this part of the Necvopolis of Thebes, which may be reached
from Der el-Medineh in 25 min., we conclude our first day on the w. bank
in our three days' plan. Gaze's tourists make it their second day, Cook's
begin their third day with the Ramesseum (R. 13) and the tombs of
'Abd el-Ijiurnah, as in our five days plan. The tombs to he visited may
be found without a guide. They are reached hy ascending the E. side of
the Libyan mountains in a direct line from the Ramessenin. Many of the
tombs here are inhabited by fellMpin. The sepulehral chambers Serve
as dwelling-places, wooden doors are hung in the entrances, and the
fore-court is often enclosed by a clay wall for the confinement of their
live stock. In front of most of these cave-dwellings stand covered cy-
iinders like gigantic mushrooms, of Niie mud and straw kneaded to-
gether. These are the primitive granaries of the inhabitants of 'Abd el-
Iiurnah, several of whom are well-to-do, with houses of Nile bricks, eun-
spieuous from a considerable distance. Those who are desirous of staying
any length of time should make arrangements with the weal thy and worthy
Copt, Todrus, uncle of the German consular agent at Luxor. The erec-
tion of a house for travellers has been under consideration, and would
be of especial benefit to scholars by sparing them the daily journey tn
and from Lusir. Shelter may be found in the house of Mohammed rAhd
e1sRasill, provisions being brought from Luxor. Several European schnl-
are have chosen 'Abi1-elr1iurmah as their centre for investigations nu the
w. bank, amnng them Champelliou, XVilkinson, Lepsius (whose lodging,
in the tombs is still known by the felliiyin as the Kasr Lepsius), Prisse
d'Avennes, and Ehers. The visitor to the tombs hvist lirst face smne
savage dogs, but he will be thoroughly repaid partly by the interest which
some of the tombs afford, and partly by the magnificent *View which is
ohlained from those in the higher positions. especially at sunset. In this
part of the Necropnlis of Thebes were buried the wealthy nohitity of the
18th Dyn., 11p0n whose tombs large sums of money must have been spent.
The inscriptions record that the deceased were in their life-tinte invested
with the highest spiritual and temporal dignities and that they enjoyed
ahnnst royal estates, their pride in which they show in sculptures and
inscriptions. However death is not forgotten in these toth, for there, is
no lack of funereat epitaphs. In almost all of them too we find genea-
logical tables, by which we learn that many of those buried here were
related tn each other.

The more important tombs were numbered by Wilkinson, but most
of the figures have been obliterated. In 1885 Prof. Eisenlnhr renumbered
the tombs, in all 127, including those with no inscriptions. In the foilow--
ing description' of the tombs reference is made to these numbers, which
appear in the adjoining small plan. If time is limited, it will he sufli-
cient to visit the tombs of Kha-em-lrat, Ramses, Nekht, Sen-uefer, Anna,
Horemheh, and Ramenkheperseneh.

The traveller is recommended to begin with two tombs on the

eastern side of the hill behind the Ramesseum. The one to the left

has been long known, and in consequence is much injured. It lies
behind a square court cut out of the hill, and has two other tombs
near it.

The tomb of Jiha-em-Yit consists of three halls lying one behind the
other, the first and third of which are at right angles to its length. (In
