NILE JOURNEY. xix

b. The Dhahabiyeh Voyage.

Though the voyage in a Dhahabiyeh demands much more time
and money than the steamboat-voyage, on the other hand it offers
the only means of a satisfactorily close examination of the country
and its monuments. A party of 4-5 persons will be found advisable,
especially as the expense is not much more than for 1-2 persons.

A large selection of good dhahabiyehs is to be found at Cairo,
on the left bank of the Nile both above and below the new bridge
at B15lstlr. Travellers who take the train from Cairo to Assirlt should
despatch their boat from Cairo about a fortnight in advance, for
there are no good dhahabiyehs either at Assifit or farther up at
Luxor and Assuin. In Cairo the best dhahabiyehs are those belong-
ing to Messrs. Cook & Son (Usis', 'Osiris', 'Horus', 'Hathor', 'Neph-
this', and 'Ammon-Ra', costing 130t. per month) or Messrs. Gaze &
Son (‘Sesostri3‘, 'Cheops', 'mrodotas", and 'Hope', 110l. per month).
Other good craft, with the monthly hire, are as follows: 'Diamond'
(100D, 'Eva' (8010, 'Admiral' (85L), 'Timsah' Cool.), 'London',
'Luxor', 'Phila:' (each 75L), 'India' (Mt.), 'Alma', 'Nubia', 'Ze-
nobia', 't7amila' (each 90L), 'Lotus' (701.), 'jlfeermin', 'Manhattan?
(each 7510, 'Grifitd (8011.), 'Zingara' (651.), and ' Vittoria' (551.).

These prices include the hire of the dhahahiyeh and its full
equipment and the wages of the re'ts or captain and the crew. For
the services ofa dragoman, cook, and attendant, and for provisions,
saddles, and all the incidental expenses of excursions (excluding
hakshish), the price per day and per pers. is calculated thus: ---.

Cook Gaze Dragoman
Party of 2, each pers. 33s. Ms. 30s.
- - 3 - - 28s. 27s. 24s.
- - 4 - - Uis. 25s. 20s.
- - 5 - - 22s. 20s. 183.

- - 6 or more, 20s. 163. 163.

Thus for a voyage of 60 days from Cairo to Assuin and back,
including the payment of a dragoman and all provisions (except
wine, etc. , Cook charges 590l. for a party off) (i.e. 118l. each pers.,
or 30s. 4d. each per day). For smaller parties, the cost per head is
considerably more. A three months' voyage in the 'Manhattan' (the
property of a dragoman) costs 4852. for a party of/l (Le. El. los.
per day, or 32s. 6d. each pers. per day). The inclusive charge for
Cook's excellent steam-dhahabtyeh 'Nitoeris' (5 berths) is 400l. per
month, a sum that will not appear exorbitant when the time saved
by steaming is taken into account.

Those who employ Cook's or Gaze's dhahabiyehs are relieved from
all trouble in the matter of engaging a dragoman (quite indispensable to
the traveller who speaks no Arabic) or purchasing provisions. And there
are the additional advantages that the stores of meat, fowls, vegetables,
and fruit can be replenished en route from the steamers, and that, in case

of head-Winds, the small Steam Towing Launches belonging to these firms,
may be hired for (b-8t. per day.
