158 Route 13. THEBES. West Bank:

'He speaks: come to me Ammon Ita, lord of the throne of the world
of E. Thebes. Look upon thy dwelling, which has been prepared
for thee in the excellent site of Thebes, whose beauty is united with
the region of the dead'. The inscription is continued in the style
of a hymn, extolling what had been done for this temple, and ex-
pressing the god's approval of the work that was here dedicated to
him. - In the neighbourhood of this stele are numerous blocks
of stone and architectural fragments, which belonged to the rich
temple of Amenhotep mentioned in the inscription. There is no
possibility of reconstructing the ground-plan of this building, and
the half-buried sphinx-columns and broken statues present little
interest. - Still farther to the N.W., at the foot of the Libyan
mountains, two fragments of an ancient brick-building, known as
Kém el-lrt.tdn, project like huge horns from the ground, and at a
distance may eaSily be taken for the eolossi of Memnon.

13. The Ramesseum.

The *Ramessemn, better known as the Memnonium of Ramses IL,
lids about 1/4 hr. to the N.N.E. of K6111 el-0ttin. The route skirts
the fertile land, and the ruin soon appears conspicuously 011 Our
right, as we look towards the Libyan mountains. We pass a small
éana] with a water-wheel worked by a buffalo, which waters the
well-cultivated fields near the Ramesseum, as well as a small grove
of sunt and tamarisk-trees to the E. of it. Whether it is approached
from the N. 01' from the S., the Ilamesseum presents a most picturesque
appearance. As almost all the side-walls have fallen, it is possible
to obtain a comprehensive view of the well-proportioned arrange-
ment of this beautiful temple and to grasp its general architectural
idea, Though time has destroyed much, it is still possible to realize
the form of its main portions. - So far as the Purpose of the Rames-
seum'is concerned, it may be asserted with absolute certainty that
it was dedicated to the worship of the memes of Ramses 11., and
stood in the same relation to the tomb ofthatprinee, as the ehapels
at the entrance of the rock-tombs of wealthy private citizens to the
adjoining mummy-shafts (.Vol I., p. 170). This is clearly indicated by
the position of the monument, by the procession with images of an-
cestors at the festival of the staircase, on the N. part of the IV. side
of the second pylon, by the list of the sons of the Pharaoh, and by
the ceiling-carvings in the last rooms of this Memnonium. Finally
several inscriptions inform us that the Ramesseum resembled the
temple which Ramses the Great vowed in gratitude for his rescue
out of the hands of the Kheta who had surrounded him (p. 161).

The question has been much discussed whether the Ramesseum is to be
identified with the Tomb of Osymandyas, minutely described by Diodorus.
The affirmative view has been stoully advocated by Jollois and Devilliers in
the report of the French Expedition, and is now generally adopted in spite

of Letrontse'g protest. It is true that while many points in Diodorus's
description tally with the Ramesseum (e.g. the eolossa1 sitting statues, the
