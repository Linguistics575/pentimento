Doorway of stone (on the S.hh),by which we have to pass, leads into
the temple, at the back of which (N.) are steep rocks. The sanctn-
ary was founded by Ptolemy IV, Philopator 1., and sculptures were
added by others of the house of the Lagidas, and later also by the
Emperor Augustus. The traveller on passing through the doorway
in the outer wall sees on his left an archway ofNile bricks, and
before him the front of the temple of freestone, on which many
Greeks and Copts have written their names. In Christian times it
was used by the monks as a dwvlling-plaee, and to this is due the
mutilation of many of the inscriptions and also its present name
(1)tr == monastery). We first come to a small hypzethral Antechamber
with2columns, and a few steps further reach the true Ptelemaie en-
trance of the Nrtos. This is ornamented by two pilasters with masks
of Hathor, and two Columns with sculptured calyx-t-apitals in the
middle, which support the erehitrave and are connected by walls re-
sembling screens (reaching half-way top). Between the pillars is a
semi-portal similar to the one at Ilet1am1it. (p. 151). The pilasters are
brightly coloured and peculiarly ornamented, with a lotus flower and
a bud on slender stems at the side. Above are Urzeus-serpents with the
crowns ofboth kingdoms, on the left side is an elegant window which
lights a staircase. The inner portion of the temple is in three parts.
Overthe (loorof the middle room, the sanctuary, are placed "illathor-
masks corresponding, to the number of the tlathors. Euergetes ll.
and his wife are named as beautitiers ot' the temple, and the four
sacred bulls, Ilapi, Urmerti, Temur, and Abekur, are portrayed. In
the cell to the right is the king before the various gods of the lower
world, and also an astronomical painting, Sethis (Sirius) and Orion.
1n the room to the left, 011 the left wall, is a remarkable represen-
tation of the Judgment of the Dead.

The valley of Dér el-Medineh is rich in Tombs ofvarious periods,
Some of them early and of great interest, with the colours of the
paintings marvellously preserved.

Here was discovered the well-known collection of I’apyri, obtained
by A. C. Harris in t855, containing the famous papyrus of Ramses III. (see
p. I'?.))), the largest; known, front the archives of the temple of Medi-
net Hahn.

The earliest tombs here belong to the beginning of the New Eur.
pire and to the times ofAahmes 1. and Amenhotep I. They be-
longed to great officials, especially to the Sotem-as, supreme judge
at the Seat of Truth, possibly a college which met at Thir er-Medi-
ml. We may mention the small brilliantly coloured chapel of the
royal] scribe, .llesrr-t. the similar one of Kth, the tombs ol'Amemncs,
chken, and Amenhotcp. In several tombs we find numerous frag-
ments of mummies, damaged and ransacked hy the fellil.i'iu. Con-
tinuing farther into the valley we reach a tomb with a wide entrant-e
from which there is a flue view ofl>ér er-Mediueh and of the fertile
plains to the E., traversed by the bile and bounded by tho distant
Arabian mountains. 1n the foreground are seen Medinet Habu, the
