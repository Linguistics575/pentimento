(f'ailliaud; ItohlPs return journey). Soht1g, Girgeh, and Esneh are the
preferable starting-points, as they are towns of some size where the
necessary number of camels is easily obtained. About 10 hrs. are re-
quired from Sohég 0r Girgeh; while 50-52 are required from Esneh, be-
cause the road leads; chiefly over rocky soil, and is therefore more
exhausting for the camels. Camels, water, provisions, tire-arms, etc. must
he provided as mentinned on p. 313.

This oasis was visited by Poneet in 1690, by Browne in 1793, and in
the present century by Cailliaud (1818), Drovetti (1832), Hoskins (18555),
P. w. Grey [1543), ltohlfs, with Zittel, Jordan, Ascherson, and Remelé
(1874), and Brugseh (1515). The excellent photographs taken by ltemelé
have contributed largely to our knowledge or the temple of el-Rhiirgeh.

The oasis of el-Khs'trgeh (the outer, in contrast to Diikhileh, the
inner, i.e. farther into the desert) is named Kenem in the inscription at
Edfu referring to the owes, while in an older inscription in the tomb

c: o
of an ofticial of Tutmes 111. it is called the South Oasis, l

it Gai; usydln éiunéptu, the Great Outer Oasis, titrabo f, 7:903:13 whom,
the First Oasis, and Ptolemy, the Great Oasis. It is also referred to as the
Oasis of the Thebaid. The ancient name of the. town with lhe temple was

garrison is mentioned in the Iiotitia Dignitatum as 'Ala prima Abasgorum
Hibeos Haseos 3lajoris'.

Like all the oases el-Khalrgeh is surrounded by a tolerably steep
chain of erctaeious limestone hills, which rises in terraces to the height
of 1475 ft. on the side next the desert, and sinks down again towards
the oasis (Katabathmuc, descent). The oasis stretches frtm N. to s. for
about 90 BI. (34 hrs. travel), and from E. to W. only 12 M. (1-5 hrs.),
and its population was estimated by Schweinfurth at 6340. The natives
who pay an annual tribute 0f 3L0 purses (500 piastres or 1045. each), or 15601.,
to the Egyption government, are of a dark complexion and are far from
good looking. Every summer they are subject to an intermittent fever,
which is fatal to many. They speak Arabic though they are not pure
fellzihin front the Nile but are mixed with the Libyan race. The oasis is
ruled by an Egyptian governor (Hakim). The chief town el-Ehdryeh has
about Nil) inhabitants. Gennah and Bmélc, to the bl, have each about 250,
Bérys 600, Dash and Muks each 1t0, according to the moderate estimates
of Cailliaud. -- There are about 150 springs in the oasis, most of them
issuing freely from elefts in the cretaceous marl. Several were, discovered
by boring, and in this way the fertility of the oasis was increased. Some
of them are warm (88192° F.) and are strongly impregnated with iron.
The chief wealth of the oasis consists in its date-palms, 6'),00)in number.

The 10wn of el-Khirgeh lies in lat, 25° " N., and long. 30° 40' E.
of Greenwich, at a height of about 216 ft. above the sea-level (Esnch
310 ft.). The chief object of interest is the temple lying a full hnur to
the N.E. of the town. Immediately on quitting the brick wall that
encircles the town, we see on the right the domed tombs of some Arab
shHihs. Uur route leads past some enelnsed palm-groves and crosses
snine dry water-courses. The ruins of the small building like a temple,
hut destitute of hieroglyphics, which L'ailliaunl discovered half-way he-
tween the town and the, large temple, seem now to have disappeared, as
has also a still smaller building with a sunk doorway to the S. of the
temple.

The Large Temple of el-Khtirgels, i.50 ft. long and about 60 ft. broad,
is a well-preserved structure built of a reddish sandstone, which Zittel
believes to have hecn quarried in Lower huhia. Its axis runs E. and IW,
with a slight inclination to the N. In front of the. temple is a fure-cnurt
and three successive gateways at irregular distances. Ru-maius of lmth
