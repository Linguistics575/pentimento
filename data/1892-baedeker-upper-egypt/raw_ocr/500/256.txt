identified as Zekkari (Teuerians) from the curious striped caps, not unlike
an Indian headdress. In the middle, among the latter, are ox-waggons with
children in them. Some of the Egyptian soldiers are Shardana, distinguished
by the eonieal ornaments on their helmets. These, at first enemies of Egypt,
afterwards took service under the Pharaohs. - 7th Scene (beyond a gap
in the wall). The king at a lion-hunt. One of the lions, eoncealed in a
thicket, has been pierced by the kinghs spear and arrows; another lies
dying beneath the horse's feet; and the king turns to transiix a third, of
Which only the claws are shown. Beneath is a procession of the Egyptian
army with allies (Shardana and Kehak). - 8th Scene. The king, having
alighted from his chariot, shoots against the hostile fleet. The painting
illustrates the oeeurrenee mentioned in the inscription of the 8th year,
on the second pylon (p. 176) as well as in the long inscription in the
colonnaded room. The hostile Shardana and Zekkari (Sardinians and
Teuerians) had penetrated into the Nile delta, where they were held fast,
like birds in a net, by the Egyptian army, until they fell beneath the arrows
of the king and his followers. TVe may clearly distinguish the Teuerians
by their caps resembling tufts of feathers, the Shardana by their horned
helmets, and the Egyptians by their laced head-eloths. The representatiOn
is exceedingly animated, though not very distinct in the oblique light.
Une of the ships has capsized. The Egyptian vessels are denoted by the
lion's head on the prow. The ship below to the right is steered by two
men with large oars, while the rest of the crew are rowers seated upon
benehes. Archers standing up ply their bows. In the interior of the ship
are a number of bound Teuerians, and others appear in the lower row.
The king himself is treading upon a captive foe. In front of him are
some archers, and above him, the proteeting vulture Unzi. - 31h Scene.
The king, having alighted from his chariot, graciously receives the grendees
who conduct the prisoners. In the lower row the severed hands are
being counted and the number noted. Above the horses a fortress is
represented, named Makatiro (Migdol castle) of King Ramses. - 10th Scene.
The Icing presents two rows of captives, described as Zekkari (Teuerians)
and Rabu (Lihyans), to Ammon, Muth, and Khnnsu, the Thehan triad.

We have now reached the second pylon, between which and the first
pylon are two more Reliefs. One represents the king attacking a hostile
fortress, whose defenders, many of whom are pierced with arrows, beg
for mercy. The other depicts the king, waving his sword, at the
head of his eharioteers, as he attacks a fortress. Some of his soldiers
are beating in the doors, while others aseeud by ladders. Trees are being
felled in the vicinity.

On the outside of the S. Wall (P1. f] of the temple is a long Festival
Calendar, which contains a list of the appointed saevifices for the period
between the 26th Pakhon (the day of Ramses 1H.'s accession) and the 19th
Tyhi. The mention of the rising of Sothis (Sirius) on the Ist Thoth
(beginning of the year) has led to the probably erroneous assumption that
under Ramses III. the Sothis-uvear of 365% days coincided with the
Egyptian civil year of 305 days, and has thus provided a iixed era for
Egyptian chronology.

c. The Small Temple of Medinet Habu.

We now quit the large temple, beside which we note the con-.
siderable ruins of the Christian village, whose church stood in the
second court (p. 1'77). We retrace our steps between the pylons,
and to the left we see the smaller temple, founded under the 18th
Dyn., the oldest part of the remains at Medinet Habu. Even if the
inscriptions had been defaced, the architectonic forms here used
would have told usin what epoch of Egyptian history the building was
erected. Its axis is not exactly parallel with that of the temple of
Ramses. The small temple was entered from the E. It is an open
