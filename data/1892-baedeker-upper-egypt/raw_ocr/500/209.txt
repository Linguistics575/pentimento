granite sanctuary (p. 134) are a few half-ruined chambers forming
a kind of annexe to the S. wall of the temple, and partly constructed
of alabaster , a substance rarely used for building. The ruins
nearest the lake date from the reign of Tutmes 111., those imme-
diately adjoining the temple-wall from the reign of the Ethiopian
Taharka. A square apartment, decorated with paintings of which
the colours are still vivid, displays some curious deities, probably
Ethiopian, but only the upper parts of the paintings are now visible.

We now return to the doorway opening to the s., between the
third and fourth pylons (p. 132), upon which is the cartouche of

tamses LN. G); L Ra nefer ka. To the S.W. of this point, in an

irregular line and at varying distances from each other, are Pylons
THI, IX, l, and AU. From the last of these an avenue of sphinxes
(now concealed by a small wood) stretches to the temple of Muth.
Pylon NI is turned towards this avenue. but the pylons N, JN, and
V111, succeeding each other towards the N., gradually effect the
transition to the great temple of Ammon by their position and the
angle they stand at with refererice to the S. wall of the great temple;
for, as will be seen from the Plan, none of them is exactly parallel
with that wall. The four pylons are connected with each other by
side-walls running at irregular angles, and thus enclosing four
courts, which, however, are no longer clearly defined owing to gaps
in the walls. Through these four gateways passed the ancient pro-
cessional route, which began at the temple of Muth, in which were
the statues of Sekhet (p. 148), and ended at the temple of Ammon
in the space with the two obelisks (p. 132), which may be regarded
as the vestibule of the sanctuary.

The series of four Courts between the pylons, which we now
visit, had an aggregate length of 310yds. (not reckoning the Sphinx-
avenue). It was begun in the early times of the 18th Dyn. (Tut-
mes 1.), and was afterwards several times enlarged and adorned.
Beginning at the gateway of Ramses IX. (see above), we have on
our right the fragment of wall (probably dating from Seti 1.) on
the W. side of which is the famous treaty (p. 1-19), and on the
left the wall running: to meet Pylon VIII, and probably dating like
that pylon from Tutmes 111. On the front of this latter wall king
Merenptah, son of Ramses JI., caused an inscription of great inter-
est to be carved.

From this we learn that the king Victoriously opposed the Libyans
and their allies, the islanders of the Mediterranean, whose later expeditipps
against Egypt are recorded in the inscriptions at Medinet Habu o, 177).
Under his father the Egyptians had advanced into Asia; now, the peoples
tn the w, and N. of the Nile valley, the Lihyans and Maxyans, and with
them Lyeians, Sardinians, Sicilians, Aehmans, and a tribe named Pu'lesta.
(more probably Philistines than Pelasgians), dare to invade the Delia and
to dwell there 'likeprevious kings' (Le. probably the llyksos). Merenptah
assembles an army, and encouraged by a dream, defeats the allies. The
number of the slain and the most valuable portions of the booty are de-
