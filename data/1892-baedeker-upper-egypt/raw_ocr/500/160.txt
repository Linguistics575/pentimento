steamer station), now an insignificant village, occupying the site of
the ancient Apollinopolis Parva. According to Ahulfeda (d. 1331)
this town was second in size only to Fostit. (Cairo), and was the
chief centre of the Arabian trade. To-day heaps of ruins are the
only remains. A few stones with fragmentary inscriptions have
been built into the houses of the town; and the mosque contains
a basin formed of a single stone, with the name of Ptolemy Phila-.
delphns upon it. A pylon, which stood here 30 years ago but has
now disappeared, bore a Greek inscription, announcing that '0ueen
Cleopatra and King Ptolemy, the great gods and Philometors, and
their children dedicated the temple to the god Arneris and to the
deities worshipped along with him'. Arueris is the earlier Horus,
usually identified by the Greeks with Apollo, whence the name of
the town Apollinopolis. The modern name 1.ftrs appears to be

derived from the Egyptian if if feslces. Near Senhm (E. bank),

Ch

3 M. to the S. of 1ftos, Prisse dt,e,,nes discovered the ruins of a
small temple of Isis, in which the Home of Apollinopolis, Khem-
Min of Koptos, the triad ofThehesIAmmon-Ra, Muth, and Khunsu),
and other gods, were also worshipped. To the E. of Senhur passes
the canal of Senhur o, 98), which begins above Thebes and
extends N. to lieneh. In the 12th cent. B.G. If11s was notorious for
the number of its scorpions. Numerous Christians dwell here and
also in Nalcddeh, on the W. bank of the Nile, about 3 M. to the S.W.
Nalp1deh (mail-station), with numerous dove-cotes, a Coptic and a
Roman Catholic church, has old and narrow streets, but presents
a picturesque appearance from the river. The traveller who lands
here near sunset on a Sunday or festival (recommended) will be
pleasantly surprised to hear the sound of ch11relv-bells. The churches
themselves are uninteresting. Great success has attended the
labours of Christian missionaries here and still more in Iit1s; and
a considerable proportion of the Coptic community (including the
worthy and learned bishop of Kits) have embraced Protestantism.
The missionaries of the United Presbyterian Church of North
America have also had considerable success at Luxor, Esneh, and
other towns in Upper Egypt, their converts, however, being ex-
clusively from among the Copts, never the Mohammedans.
Demetrius 11., patriarch of the Cepts (d. 1870), excommunicated
both the converts and the missionaries. In 1866 he instigated a
persecution of the proselytes, whom he sought to terrify by fines,
stripes, and imprisonment; and he destroyed the publications of
the missionaries (who have a printing-press of their own) wherever
he could Jay hands upon them. The British and American consuls
thereupon interfered energetically on behalf of their fellow-
believers, and now the Coptic Protestants enjoy complete immunity
from every form of religious persecution.
