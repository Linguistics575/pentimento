with axes, olive-branehos, etc. Lying on the ground is a peculiar
capital, such as may be seen also in other parts of the temple, con-
sisting of a cube, with the mask of the goddess Hathor carved on
the front and back. The upright broken shafts should also be
noticed; one half was treated as a Pillar, the other as a polygonal
column with 7 sides, andyrn inscription was placed on the surface
of the pillar.

The *Third Terrace (Mariette’s Termsse da Centre) deserves
especial notice. Underneath there were on each side, left and right,
two rows of11 square pillars which together formed two halls, 88 ft.
long, open to the east. Of these the pillars of the left hall still
stand, only two remaining in that on the right. These halls sup-
ported a roof, of which all that remains is a fragment of the archi-.
trave and a broad slab on the 11 pillars in the back row. The
scenes represented on the inner wall and on the left side are of
great interest.

Disregarding for the presentthepart ofthe temple to the 1eft(Speos
of Hathor, p. 227) we begin with the right side of the inner wall
below the third terrace. The first scenes are somewhat damaged,
but those which follow are in a good state of preservation, and refer
chiefly to the expedition on which Queen Hatasa-Itamaka sent her

ships to Arabia( Punt . 1. Ramaka represented as

Ch
king, with the double crown on her head, and the staff in her hand,
before Ammon-Ra. There is a long but obliterated inscription.
2. The queen with two bowls full of grains of incense, and with
the helmet on her head, before the sacred boat of Ammon-lla. The
boat with a rarn's head at each end is carried by priests, of whom
the two in the centre are high-priests, clad in leopard-skins. Next
we see T Neha-trees in tubs, probably ineer1yr-bearing trees imported
to Egypt from the East; men with tubs are piling up the incense
in heaps. Above are the weighing and measuring ofpreeious metals,
as may be seen elsewhere. The weights used for weighing the gold
rings are in the form of oxen lying down. The goddess bafekh marks
the result on a tablet. Next are 3 Neha-trees. Below is seen a group
of 8 cattle, two eating the reed-grass 0n the river-side. The scene
reminds us vividly of Pharoah's dream (Gen. ELL 1). 'And it came
to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and,
behold, he stood by the river. And, behold, there came up out of
the river seven well -favoured kine and fat-fleshed; and they fed in
the reed-grass'. Near this are sacks with cosmetics (meslem). Again
we find the king with the insignia of power. Then 2 rows of ships
belonging to the fleet which ltamaka-llatasu sent to Arabia. The
shape of the vessels, their rigging, oars, and rudders should be
noticed, as well as the cargo which can be seen ou board, and the
loading by means of a small boat. The necessary explanations
are given by small inseriptious above the pictures. To the left,
