Hebent. On the back-wall, to our left as we enter, King Horus is depicted
returning in triumph from his campaign in Ethiopia.

This "helief, uf great artistic value, shows the Pharaoh sealed on
his throne which is borne by 12 nobles adorned with feathers. The throne
has lions' feet and its back also consists of liens. The king wears the
war-helmet and carries the staff of empire in his left hand. Behind
and before him are eourt-ofticials, warding " the sun's rays with the
long-handled flahellum. The Kherheh precedes the litter, oCering incense,
and a train of captured Ethiopians is led along hy the victor. Vanquished
blacks are lying on the ground and others are being rapidly marched "
by Egyptian soldiers. Above the captives are the words: 'Leading of the
captives of the miserable Kush by Horus, king of Upper and Lower
Egypt, etc. His majesty came out of the land of Kush (Ethiopia) with
the booty which his sword had made, as his father Amman had com-
manded him'. Before the priests, who stand in a reverential attitude, is
written: 'The good god approaches, he celebrates his victory over the great
ones of all lands. When he grasps the bow in his right hand he is like
the lord of Thebes (i.e. Month, the god of war), as king of the strength
of heroes. Above the prisoners is. the inscription: 'Hail to thee, king of
Egypt, sun of the barbarians! Clhy name is extolled in the land of the
Ethiopians. Thy battle-ery resouuds over their seats. Thy heroic strength,
0 thou perfect prince, converts the alien lands into tombs. Pharaoh, long
life and health, I) my sun-god' (Shu).

Farther to the right and also on the back-wall is a recess with King
Siptah Khuenm before Ammon, with Bai, an oflicial (overseer of the
whole land). Next is a Stele of Panehesi, of the sec0nd year of Meren-
ptah I. and his consort Astnefert; then a stele of the time of Ramses L,
and upon it the tjrst tablet of the Festival instituted by the kinghs son
Khaemus in honour of his father Ramses II. The tirst tablet dates from
the 30th year, the second from the 3Ith, the third from the 37th, and the
fourth from the 40th.

Beside the pillar is the small Sanctuary of Ramses II. To the left of
the entrance is King Horus (who built the sanctuary), before Harmachis
and the goddess Jusas, and the same king befoce Ammon-Ra and Muth.
At the back of the very dark recess is a god, with three forms on each
side. Numerous figures of gods. To the right of the entrance to the
sanctuary is a reproduction of the Festival Stete mentioned above. Ad-
joining is the stele of the 1sigh-priest Moi, who instituted a festival in
the third year of Nerenptah I. Farther on is another Festival Stale, with
llamses 11. before Harmachis and Muth, Ptah, and Sebek. The date is
the same as on the preceding, hut the marshal of the festival is here the
Erpa Ila. (prince) and mayor Shut. The same ofticial appears also in the
same stele of the 46th year of Ramses II. as marshal of the 61h festival
in the whole land (Khaemus had probably died in the interval).

The numerous reliefs above and below the five doors and in the re-
cesses outside should also be noticed. Over the central door: King Horus,
here called the beloved of Ammon and Muth, of Khuum, of Aim, and of
Auk, mistress of Sati (Asia). Over the second door (from the left):
