(see below), with a little salt (. 1615 0/0), Airs lemh (spring of Moses) to
the N. of Siwah, end 'Ain ban Lif to the S. The climate is unhealthy only
towards the end of summer, when the evaporation of the numerous marshes
induces fevers. These marshes (sebkhah) add largely to the difflculty
of travelling about the oasis. The mean temperaiu1T is Tro Fahr. - The
oasis contains about 300,000 date-palms; and about 3000 tons (9000 came]-
loads) of dates are annually exported to North Egypt by the Beduin tribe
of the Tfraled-tAli. The olive tree also flot1vishes here, oranges and 1e-
mons in Khamisah, and throughout the oasis grapes, pomegranates, apri-

cots, peaches, p1ums,and a kind of dwarf apple. - Live stock is not
numerous, owing to a dangerous fly, about as large as a bee, whose sting
is fatal to cattle and camels. Wild pigeons abound. - Salt is procured

by evaporation in an almost pure state. Sal mumoniae is prepared by
artificial distillation from camels' dung. Minutoli estimated the number
of the inhabitants at 8000, Rohlfs at 5600. The two principal tribes, the
Lifayah and the Jlharbyth, both of which include numerous st1trtribes, are
hostile to each other. - The annual tribute to the Egyptian government
is 10,000 Maria Theresa thalers, equal to about 2000l. An Egyptian go-
vernor presides over the oasis. Strangers are quartered in the Ifasir, to
the N. of the castle of Siwah, near the date-magazine and the dome of
Sidi Slimdn. Siwah and Akermi, the chief towns situated like castles upon
steep rocks, lie about 3 M, apart. The streets of both are narrow. Siwah
belongs to the Lifayah and only the portion of the oasis to the SAV. of
it belongs to the Rharbyin, including Akermi. The Lifayah are forbidden
to enter Akermi, in consequence of their having suddenly seized the town
about 40 years ago', though they were afterwards repelled by the Rhar-
byin. Shékh Mohammad Djari, the richest man in the oasis, resides at
Akermi as head of the natives.

The ruins now to be found are very scanty. The triple-walled castle
described by Diodorus (see p. 345) appears to be identified with the loftity
situated Akermi, also called Sharkigeh. An early Egyptian structure,
discovered here in 1853 under some modern houses by the Scottish
traveller James Hamilton, was easily recognized as the fore-court and
chamber of a temple or palace. The interior walls were covered with
hieroglyphics, but so blackened with smoke that the kings' cartouches
could not be recognized. In the thickness of the wall was a narrow
passage, 6 ft. long and 2 ft. wide. In an adjoining, street was a colossal
Egyptian gate. Rohlfs eonfirmed this discovery in 1869. Passing along a
narrow, winding passage, he observed a building with foundation-walls
of hewn stones, and to the W. of it he came upon the large edifice, the
outer walls of which are visible from outside the village, while the
inner wall extends to the great square, of Akermi. A rough passage
admits to a fore-court, 15 ft. long and 10 ft. broad. Two large Egyptian
gateways (181/2 ft. high) lead to the holy of holies, which is entirely ob-
structed by houses; the gateways can be passed only through the houses.
Rohlfs found a large number of pictures and inscriptions here, and
copied some of them by candle-light. The cella was 50 ft. long, 181/2 ft.
broad, and 181/2 ft. high. A secret passage, 2 ft. wide, within the E. wall
communicated w ee the great well of Akermi.

About 300 pa s to the S. of Akermi lie the ruins of Umm et-2h'tltili
(white mother), facing the town and lying from N. to S. In the time of
Cailliaud and Minutoli the ruins consisted of the left wing of the gate-
way and a covered portion behind. The former, which has now dis-
appeared, contained the representation of a king ofrering to the ram's-
headed Ammon and his female companion. The other portion, which
still remains, is 141/2 ft. long (at places only 101/4 ft.) and about 25 ft.
high, with a passage 161/2 ft. wide. On the right. and left sides are pro-
cessions of gods in several rows, with the above-mentioned ram’s-headed
Ammon as the chief deity. Above these gods are numerous vertical lines
of hieroglyphics--55 on the w. wall, 53 on the E. (lef0---of which we
unfortunately possess no copies. The ceiling consists of three (before
the earthquake in 1811 of five) massive stone blocks, 28 ft. long, 5 ft.
broad, and 3 ft. thick, decorated with vultures (the symbol of lordship)
