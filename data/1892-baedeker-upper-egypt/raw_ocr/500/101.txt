am] is 650 sq. M. in extent. The Canal ofSohdg, which leads hem-e
to Assiirt., keeps to the W. and is intended to convey the water of
the rising Nile as far as possible towards the Libyan Desert.

(In this canal lies Et/eh (Itfu), the ancient Aphrodilopolz's, so named
from the sandals tteb) made out of the skin of Seti. About 2 M. from Etfeh
is the Red Convent, Dh. el-Aiamar, also called Diir Abu Bishdeâ€˜. Those who
wish to visit the Red Convent and the similar White Convent (one of the
regular excursions of the passengers by the 'four weeks' steamer) may
hire asses at tlol/tig and ride viii Demtm towards the Libyan Desert. The
old church of the convent, a basilica. with nave and aisles, is a very
ancient structure of brick, with elaborate capitals and a richly articulated
apse. The outer walls, decreasing in thickness towards the top, and the
concave cornice above the portal, are interesting forltheir reminiscence of
ancient Egyptian art. Abu Bishaii, the founder of the convent, is said by
\Vausleh to have been a penitent robber, and he afterwards acquired such
a reputation for sanctity that, according to Nalrvizi, 3000 monks placed
themselves under his care. The recluse after whom the White Convent
(Nits ei-Alrytt4 " Dip Aim ,Shaniidi) was named, is stated to have been
9116 of his pupils. It lies at the foot of the mountains, farther to the
S.E., and may perhaps be rather called a Christian village than a convent,
as husbands, wives, and children live here in families. The walls of the
Church are built of hewn stone, probably taken from the adjacent ruins
of Athrihis (ShC-kh Hamed), dating from the Ptolemaie and Roman im-
perial periods 1t dates at latest from the 5th cent. and is a basilica with
nave and aisles. The columns vary in height and thickness, and the
capitals are partly of later date. The chancel ends in three vaulted apses.
The cupolas are tvhumed with poor frescoes. and the other Jeeorations are
also wretched. - In the hills to the w. of the While Convent are a few
late rtek-tomhs, one of which, according tn the inscription, is that of
Ermius, son of Archibius.

Ut/g M. Akhmim, a steamboat and mail station 011 the It. bank,
also reached from F'ohig by a shorter land-route. is a thriving little
town with about 10.00() inhab., including 1000 Christians, some
of whom are Roman Catholics, with a chapel of their own. The
weekly market onWed. is much frequented, and the bazaar is well-.
stocked. The numerous cotton mills produce the cloth for the blue
shirts of the fellrihin and for the long sluita (pl. sMldt). or shawls
with fringes, which the poorer classes wear on state occasions and
for protet'tion against cold. These articles, which have been made
here since the time of Strabo, an- extraordinarily cheap. Akhmim
stands 011 the site of Khmmnis or Punopotis, generally held to be the
most ancient town 011 the Nile, though this honour probably belongs
to the venerable This-Abyilos, 0n the, W. hank (p. 53). The deity
Spet-ially venerated here was the form of Ammon Generator known
ith; Ammon Khem, also called at a later date Min, an appellation
formed by dropping the Khem and abbreviating the Amen. Thus
it is ealletl Emu; Le. belonging to Min. For a figure of this deity,
who appears in the most ancient texts, see JJuedelcer"s Lower Egypt,
p. 137. Diodorus, who among other classical writers gives us much
information about iihemmis-Panopolis, calls it Kappa), whence
proceed the Coptic Shmin and the Arable Ekhmim 01' Akhmim. Its
profane name on the monuments is Apu,

Herodotus Ill, 91) distinguishes the citizens of Khemmis as the only
Egyptians who favoured Greek customs and relates that they erected a
