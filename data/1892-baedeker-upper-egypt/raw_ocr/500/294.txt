Sa and Hekau, drawn by 'those who are in the depths'. To meet
those represented here come other gods 'who have already found
admission'. Below all is Tum, the conqueror of the foes, who lie
bound on the ground before him. Again we see the boat, the heniu,
and the men or people of the lower world; also the members of the
household of Ra, to which belong (1)11ine apes which sing when Ra

enters the depths, (2) fire-breathing serpents l which illumine

the darkness in the depths, (3) nine men with arms upraised,
who praise Ita on the ninth of the month, (A) twelve women who
do homage to Ra, when he enters the Atur names, 01' Ocean. The
roof contains astrological figures, lists of deeani, constellations and
the like,be10wisApi etc. The magnificent sarcophagus of alabaster,
iiiliiiiii'l, with the fragments of the lid, discovered here by Belzoni
(Oct.19th 1817), is now at the Soane Museum in London. It was
empty, and the splendid mummy of Seti I. was diseoveredi 111 1881
in the shaft at Dér el-balm' (see p. '2/29) in a sarcophagus borrowed
from the high-priests of the 21st Dynasty. AU. Serpents at the
door, boat, recumbent Osiris, etc. .--N11. Astronomical figures.
The cow, supporting Shu, and surrounded by worshippers-TOL
Larger square room, with one of the pillars supporting the roof
destroyed. Round it runs a parapet on which statuettes, vases,
amulets etc., probably stood. The astronomical figures are ex-
ceedingly difficult to understand; below is a serpent with the heads
of the four genii of the dead. n The boat of Afu-Ra with his usual
companions. At their head Isis, with hands outstretched, exercises
a serpent, which has many knives sticking in its body, and is held
by the neck and throttled by a goddess'. ---XIIr remains unfinished.
The rudely constructed passage which slopes downwards some
70 yds. farther offers nothing more, and the traveller may now return
satisfied with what he has seen, and astonished at the labour which
it must have cost.

The inner part of the tomb is filled up. The portrait of the deceased
should be noticed. In 1885 several ornaments, fragments of a gar-
ment of many colours and with gold buttons, etc. were discovered
in the tomb.
Near the above is a passage sloping downwards for 80 yds., first
