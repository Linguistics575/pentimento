1st year, on the 10th Epiphi, in the reign of His Majesty etc. . . . Ramses-
Miamun, who loves the Nile, the father of the gods, his creator. Long
may he live, possessing firmness and might, eternally. Long live the
benefieent god, the Nile that loves the prinueval waters (Nam), the father
of the gods, who form the cycle of the nine deities, which belong to the
floods, the blessing, the abundance, the support of Egypt, “ho blesses
all the world with life hy his rich abundance, who is dignified in his
course and distributes blessings with his tingers. The elect are rejoiced
at his approach. Thou art one that hast created thyself, and no man
knows whence thou art. On the day that thou cumest out of thy sur-
roundings, all the world rejoices. Thou art 3. lord of many fishes and
gifts, Who bestowest nourishment upon Egypt. Even the nine deities
know not whence thou art. Thou art their life. Therefore when thou
approachest they redouble their oiferingsi they furnish the altars richly
and raise their voices in exultation when thou appearest. Thou metest
rich measure to us, to nourish the elect, like Ra when he ruled this land.
Strong and wakeful is he at all times, to seek nourishment for the living,
to make the corn abundant like the sand of the seashore, and to load
the granaries With gifts. Behold, therefore His Majesty sought how he
might exalt the father of all gods, the prince and ruler of the flood, and
meditated like the god Tehuti (Thothl to tind out what was adequate to
his love (Le. how he might give most adequate expression to his love).
No king has done so since thy time, Uh Ita' And His Majesty spoke:
'Whereas the Nile nourishes the world, and blessing and abundance
follow upon his rising, and behold each one lives in his dwelling, enriched
through his command; and seeing that I know what stands in the book-
store that is preserved in the library; therefore when the Nile comes
forth from his two sources, then let the offerings to the gods be in-

creased; but if the holy stream is at Silsileh Rhennu-t),

Ci
at the right time, King Ramses 11. “ill redouble the olTerings to it there'.

This king appointed two festivals to be kept at Silsileh in honour
of the Nile, as the following portion of the inscription records. One, Was
to he observed at the beginning of its gradual rise (the 15th Epiphi), the
other On the 15th Thoth, when the rapid rise set in. L. Stern compares
these appropriately to the two main lestivals of the modern Egyptians,
the Night of the Drop, and the Cutting ofthe Dam, which are also two months
apart (Vol. L, p. 230J. Merenptah l, and Ramses Ill, confirmed the grants
made hy Ramses II. for the purposes 0fthese festivals, and erected the above-
mentioned steles in conunenmration of the fact. The nature of the grants
(saerifieial bread and cakes, antelopes, beef, veal, six kinds of wine,
honey, oil, beer, milk, essences, etc.) is recorded in the lists below the
inscriptions, from which We also learn that the king olfered fowls to the
river-gods and as much corn as a granary could contain to Ammon of
Thebes. - The side-walls of the two chapels are also occupied with
scenes of sacrifice and worship.

Various opinions have been expressed as to the reason of the
special reverence paid. to the Nile at this particular defile. The
narrows of Silsileh were perhaps diftlcntlt or even impossible to
pass in earliest antiquity, and so probably came to be regarded as
the second entrance of the river into Eg 'pt, the first being at the
cataract at Assuan. This is the more probable as K6111 Ombe was
certainly reckoned as belonging to Nubia.

tetween the above-mentioned chapels of Ramses II. and Meren-
ptah, is a small Stale erected by the mayor Punchesi (p. 257), who
appears here along with a son of the king accompanying the king;
before Amman. The prayer is addressed not only to Ammon, but
also to the 'holy water' (mu ah, see above) and to the god Sebek.
