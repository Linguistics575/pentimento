234 Route 22, ESNEU. From Thebes

this fish, which appears not only on the coins, but is also repre-
sented with the disc between the horns, was used as a symbolieal
representation of Khnurn-Ra, especially as we actually find Khmlm

united with the fish on the rear-wall of the tempie%P i'iieei) .

The SIDE WALLS are entirely covered with paintings and in-
scriptions. The former show the king making offerings to various
divinities of the temple, who promise him in return the good things
of life. At the foot of the wall to the right of the entrance is the
emperor Commodus with Arue'ris and iihnnm capturing with a net
the various products of the Nile (birds, fishes, plants, etc.). 011 the
other side of the net is Safekh. This symbolical representation pos-
sibly refers to the legend according to which Horus fighting against
Seth-Typhon fell dead into the water and was drawn out of it
again living, - a legend, which is connected with the course of
the moon. A main door and two side portals are seen in the rear-
wall of the temple. The latter probably gave admittance to a corri-
dor surrounding the Sanctuary, which was entered by the central
portal. Recent excavations in this direction have hitherto remained
without result.

On the pieces of wall between the pillars on the Front are sev-
eral highly important inscriptions . of which by far the most
valuable is the celebrated Calendar of Festivals on the wall-pillars
to the right and left. A specimen of the eceentrieities and freaks
indulged in by the hierogrammatists under the Romans, may be
seen in the crowd of crocodiles on the pillar at the extreme left of
the E. or entrance wall.

The 'll Columns of the portico are specially noteworthy on ac,-
count of the shapes of their capitals, some of which are overladen
with ornament. Of the columns, 18 stand detached, while 6, to-.
wards the front, are built into the outer wall. All the columns have
flat plinths, and shafts most elaborately adorned with inscriptions.
The Capitals are of various shapes and of unequal height, but this
irregularity does not offend the eye owing to the fact that the aimuli
of all the columns are arranged so as to lie in the, same horizontal
plane. Most of them belong to the calyx order, and are not adorned
merely with painting as at Karnak or the Ramesseum, but with
richly carved ornaments from the vegetable kingdom.

We begin with the front row, reckoned from the right (N.). Columns
1-6: Four petals, separated at the top, surround the calyx, which is or-
namented with marsh-plants and mushrooms. - 7-12 (second vow): ealyees
with circular horizontal section, adorned with palm-twigs. and other fo-
liage. - 13 (beginning of third row, to the right), Calyx with palm-twigs.
- 14-17: Calyx with foliage. - 18. Smooth [ealyx-eapital, in circular ho-
rizontal section, adorned with palm-twigs amongst which appear a lavish
profusion of all kinds of fruit, especially grapes and dates. - 19, 20 (two
lirst to the right, at the rear wall): C)alyx-eapitals, with marsh-plants. -
21-23: Calyces at the base of which are fruits in flat work, interrupted

by leaves, towards the top, a network ofslender plant-fronds. F24: The
base of the capital is formed of luxuriant vegetable forms in exaggerated
