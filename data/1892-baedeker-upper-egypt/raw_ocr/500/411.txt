dedicated to these two deities, as is also indicated by the represen-
tations to the right and left of the entrance-door. Above the small
door on the right are, the dedications of Tutmes III. and Amenho-
tep II. The three apartments contained scenes of worship, scenes
from the founding of the templ e,and sacrificial scenes. The traveller
should notice the carefully executed portraits of the three kings who
took part in the erection ofthe temple, Tutmes 111., Amenhotep 11.,
and Tutmes IV.

On the back-wall of the sanctuary is a stele of great historical
importance. At the top is a relief of Amenhotep II. presenting two
vessels of wine to Harmaehis and Ammon-lla; beneath is an in-
scription of 20 lines, from the 3rd year of the reign of Amenho-
tep 11. After a flattering account of the king and his achievements
(repeated on a steie found at Erment and now in Vienna), the
rompletion of the temple begun by Tutmes 111. is mentioned.

Line 1'2. 'Behold, the king adorned the house of the god (which had
been erected hy) his father, King Tutmes m., for all the divine fathers,
huilt of stone as an enduring work, with in protecting wall of bricks
arpund it. The doors were of the tiaest acacin-wood, the gateways of
enduring stone, with the object of commemorating, for ever the great name of
his father Tutmes 111. in this temple. King Amenhotep II. celebrated the

festival of the laying of the foundation-stone in honour of all his an-
cestors. while he dedicated to him a massive gate-tower of hard stone in
front of the prnteetingta11 of this splendid dwelling of the gods, a co-
lnnnade round it of hard stone as a lasting work, many sacrificial vessels
ond utensils of silver and brass, stands, altars, a bronze ealdron, bra-
siers, dishes, and eensers. Thereupon the king caused this stele to be
prepared and placed in this temple in the place where (stands) the statue
of the great Horus, the king, and he caused to he graven on it the
mighty name of Amenhotep ll. in the house of 'his divine fathers, after
he returned from the land of T'pper Syria, where he10verthrew all his

adversaries, in order to widen the boundaries of Egypt on his first
campaign.

Still more remarkable is the narrative at the end of this in-
sr'ription '.

'The king had returned home, with his heart full of gratitude to his
father Ammon. With his own band he had struck down with his club
seven kings, who were in the region of the land of Takhis. They lay
pininued on the fore-deek of the royal ship, the name of which was 'Ship
of Amenhotep11., maintainer of the land'. Six of these enemies were
hanged on the walls of Thebes, and their hands the same. The remaining
enemy was carried up the stream to Nubia, and hanged on the walls of
the town of anata. in order to make the victory of the king manifest
for ever among all the tribes of the land of the negroes, since he has
taken possession of the tribes of the S., and tamed the tribes of the N.,
even to the ends of the whole earth, upon which the sun shines, without
tiniling any opposition, according to the command of his father Ammon-
Ra, lord of the throne of both lands. Such things has Ring Amenhn-
tep II. done'. From Brugsth, History of Egypt, pp. 390, 391.

Those who ascend to the roof of the temple will find a memorial
of Herodotus, the 'father of history". not, however, inscribed by
himself, for he himself informs 115 (11.29) that. he came no farther
than Elephantine. The worn aspect of the letters indicates that the
inscription (as follows) is of considerable antiquity.
