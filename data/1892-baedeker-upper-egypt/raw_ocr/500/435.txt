describes it as being without inscriptions or representations, though
lloskins reports otherwise. In the N. and SAV. angles are two separate
spaces with tluulrle chambers, one above the other. The next mom is
the most remarkable part of the temple. This is the 8aeri.tieiat Chamber,
a narrow apartment with a row of four columns 'supporting the voof,
while four others are engaged in the entrance-wall. The builder was
Darius, who is here named in a second cartouche, 'the beloved of Ammon
of Hib, the strrong-sworded', whilst elsewhere he is usually styled 'the
beloved of Ba and Ammon' (see below). On the inside of the entrance-
wall, to the right, the king is shown kneeling and presenting two vessels
of wine, before the ramhrheaded Ammon, lord of Hih, Nuth, and Mouth.
Two f1nely carved lines ot hieroglyphics beside this scene state: 'This is
Amman of Hib, the great god, strong with the swurd; may they (the gods)
grant constant peaceful life'. Beneath is the empty cartouche ofthe king.
on the left side the cartouche beneath a similar inscription is filled in
with the King's name; while the accompanying representation shows the
king presenting wine (of the oasis) to Usiris, Horus, Isis, and Xephthys.
The highly interesting inscriptions and representations on the walls of
the narrow chamber lend it a peculiar importance. Thus at the top. to
the left, of the s. wall is the Persian king in an attitude of worship,
presenting a rich offering to the deities. Between him and the gods is a
long list of otrerings, in horizontal lines. Beneath this scene, and be-
ginning iu the N.E. corner, is a Song of Praise, composed hy the king in
honour of the sun-god Ha in very pantheistic terms. This sung, in
46 lines, was first published after copies by Robert Hay, the companion
of Hoskins, and translated by S. Birch (Transactions of the Bihl. Arch.
Society, Vol. V, London 1876), then more completely by Brugsch in his
'Reise nach der groBen Uase‘ (pp. 276 seq., Plates XIV, xxv-xxnr). On
the E. ll’all (hack-wall) are sacrificial scenes on both sides, corresponding
to each other, to Ammon-Ra, 3lath, and Khunsu. Ammon has the ram's
head like the god of the Oasis of Ammon. Towards the N.W. corner of
this wall is a mystic inscription, with the title above it: 'The mysterious
sayings of Ammon which are on the tables of mulberrrwood.' This text
refers to the secret character of Ammon, the pantheistic god ofthe oasis,
whose oracular importance, appears fro“) the passage 'his voice is heard,
but he is not visible to all who drawhreath' (line 30‘). On the door-posts
cm each side of the entrance to the next room is an inscription in the
so-called enigmatic (i.e. secret) characters, of which a duplicate is found
on the outside of the SN', wall of the temple. This next room has four
columns, and on each side are two side-rooms. The builder was again
Darius. The central deer in this room admits to the 'Sanctuary, the small
door on the right to another room, which evidently was once connected
with the sanctuary, for the myStic representations of the two rooms, as
reported by Huskies, are parts of one whole. The partition-wall must
he a later addition. The door to the left admits to a staircase, leading
straight on to a crypt, and ascending to the left to the Osiris rooms,
which are on the temple-roof as at Philm, Denderah, and Edfn. Llp-
Wrsite the last flight of steps is a finely-executed inscription: 'List of
the sacriiiecs made by Ring Darius in the golden hall for Ammon of
llib, the great god, strong with the sword'. Another list beneath
contains a catalogue of the saeriticial wines from the various districts
of Egypt; at the top the Wine of the Oasis. Of the three Osiris
rooms, the middle one contains the most interesting representations.
At the top of the N. wall is Osiris lying on a hier, beneath him are four
canopi, to the right Isis and Nephthys; in the section below the Lead
Osiris lies on the ground with Isis and Nephthys kneeling beside him.
The latter are represented as saying: 'Thou art in millions of years,
thy soul is raised to heaven with the soul of lla. I am the light by day,
thou art the moon at night'. To the right is the bull Apis, running with
the C)siris-muntmy on its hack; to the left is a frog (haht) as the re-
presentative of Osiris. At the bottom is Osiris resting in the grave as
Khem of Koptus, with Khem, Isis, and Nephthys beside him. - A frag-
