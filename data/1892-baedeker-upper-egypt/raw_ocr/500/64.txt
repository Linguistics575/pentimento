12 Route 1. BENWASAN. From Cairo

the doorway to the next chamber are a long inscription and a re-

presentation of the king offering a eynoeephalus. In the rear-wall
is a niche (naos) with the eartouehe of Seti I.

To the W. of the Speos Artemidos is a

second grotto (perhaps merely a cat's tomb),

ii, 011 the outside of Which are the interesting

cartouches of Alexander IL, son of Roxana,

and six scenes representing the king in the

company of the gods.

The dragomans 110w hurry on to (1/2 hr.)
Benihasan, where we ascend to the S. tombs.
I These, however, have been almost entirely

destroyed, and the only one of any interest

is No. 7, the tomb of Kheti, whieh contains
bunting-siwmes and fine clustered columns. Passing on we soon
reach (8 min.) the highly interesting N. tombs of Ameni (No. 1]
and Khnum-holep (No. '2); comp. pp. 14-18.

The necropolis of Benihasan is one of the most interesting in
all Egypt, not only on account of the remarkable architectural
features of the 12th Dyn. seen here, but also for the manifold re-
presentations of scenes from the domestic life of the .gyptians at
that early era.

The journey from the Nile to the tombs takes from 3/4 hr. to 11/4 hr.
according to the height of the water and the landing-place selected. Asses,
with good saddles, 1-11/2 fr. Candles, and if possible magnesium wire,
should be taken to light the tombs. The route leads towards the bare
limestone hills, at first through groves of palms and then across sand.
The ancient Benifaasan f, Benitasan el-Kadz‘m ('the old'), now deserted, lies
to the right; the modern village is to the S. of the usual landing-place.
On reaching the limestone hills we see the remains ofa dilapidated path,
supported by masonry, and ascend ever debris to the horizontal hill-path,
to the IV. of which stretch the tombs.

Before the traveller enters the tombs to inspect the represen-
tations within, he should examine the columns at the entrance. At
first sight everyone will set these columns down as unmistakeable
examples of the Dorie order; but the indisputable testimony of the
inscriptions informs us that they date, not from the Ptolemaie
period, but from the invasion of the Hyksos, in the 12th Dyn., be-
tween B.C. 2000 and BA). 3000.

Champollion named them Proto-Dorie 01' Pre-Dorie Columns.
Since him many authorities, with these columns as their starting-
point, have tried to establish the kinship of the early Greek order
with the architecture of Egypt and to prove that the former was
derived from the latter. These views, however, aroused keen op-

, The pl ace was deserted 30 or h0 years before thelvisit of the French
Espeduioh, because the inhabitants wished a wider space for cultivation
near their village, which they accordingly rebuilt farther to the S. The
story that the villagers Were expelled by Ibrahim Pasha and exterminated
for robbery is a fabrication, although it is true that many of them were
executed for this crime.
