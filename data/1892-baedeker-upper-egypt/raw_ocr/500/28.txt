The chartering of a private dhahabiyeh is much cheaper though
much more troublesome. The first step is to engage a Dragoman,
not without a careful enquiry as to his record at the consulate and
from the hotel-keepers, and an examination of the testimonials from
previous travellers. There are about 90 dragomans in Cairo, all
more or less intelligent and able, but scarcely a half of the number
are trustworthy. Most of them speak English or French, and a few
speak Italian.

The following are well spoken of: Hassan Speke, Ahmed Ramadan,
Ibrahim Salem, Armed Abderral/im (owner of the Manhattan, y. six), Hasan
Bibars, Salim Sadjar, Bishai Awatl, Abdullah Abdelkhalik (all these Egyp-
tians); Sateh (a Nubian); Michaez Gall, Anton Sapienza (Maltese); Mansilr,
Lewiz 2fartsdr, Daeybis Fadzil, Elias Telhany, and Elias Abushdya (Syrians).
It cannot be too strongly impressed up0n the traveller that it is essential
for him to show from the very beginning that he is and intends to re-
main the master. Even the best dragomans are inclined to patronize their
clients, a. tendency which must at once be quashed.

The next step is to select a suitable dhahabiyeh assisted by the
dragoman. A contract is then made with the dragoman, either en-
trusting him with the entire preparations, or assigning to him only
the duty of engaging and payingthe re'is and crew, while the trav-
eller retains the commissariat department in his own hands. The
reris or steersman is a most important fuuetitmary upon whose skill
during the often stormy passage the safety of the vessel depends.
The crew number from 8 to I'.?, according to the size of the dhaha-
biyeh. The vessel is either hired by the day (for 2 pee. 5-iu., 3
or ipers. G-Tl.) or chartered for the whole return-voyage to Asswin
(for 2 pers. 300-350l., 3 or 4 pers. 350-'i00t0. In the former case
the dragoman will try to travel as slowly as possible to protract his
engagement; in the latter case he will press on, so as to save
boat-hire and board. The latter arrangement is preferable, but the
right of halting for 15-'20 days in the course of the journey should
carefully be stipulated for. The dragoman must also provide Jon-
keys and camels for the excursions. Farther details are indicated
in the following draft-contracts, in which it is believed that nothing
of importance has been overlooked. The contract must be signed at
the traveller's consulate, either with the dragoman alone if he has
undertaken the whole of the arrangements, or with the dragoman
and re'is, when the traveller has hired the dhahabiyeh autl paysboartl
to the dragoman.
