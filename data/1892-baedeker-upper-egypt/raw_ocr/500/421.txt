Temple. ARU-SIMBEL. 33. Route. 337

behind which are painted four f1g,ures, viz. Ptah (to the left), Am-.
mon in blue, King Ramses, and Harmachis. No one should omit
to enjoy the mysterious effect of the interior view of this temple,
with its eight Osiris-statues, as seen by the light of torches or a
magnesium-lamp.

We now climb over fallen stones and heaps ofsand to the smaller
temple, which lies a little to the N.

The *Sma11er Rock Temple of Abu-Simbel lies "lose to the river.
The cliff has here been smoothed for a breadth of oo ft. to make
room for the facade of this attractive temple of Uathor, which in
modest contrast to ltamsesâ€™s huge monument, will not fail to pro-
duce a satisfactory impression. The six statues on the facade do
not project boldly like the colossi of the great temple, but stand in
niches supported on projecting pillars. Moreover it is not only the
king that is here represented; to the right and left of him stand
female figures equally large in which we recognize his consort A'o-
feriari Meriemnut. The latter holds a sistrum in her hand and wears
a double headdress with horns twisted round a disc, such as is worn
by Hathor, goddess of love, whose representative the queen is. The
figures at the corners represent Ramses again; on the left in his
usual form with a dagger in his girdle, and on the right as a dei-
fied king, with a crown consisting of the double feather springing

from the sun, and the twisted horns . Besides the six co-

lossi there are a number of much smaller statues of the children of
the king and queen. Beside the colossi on the right and left of the
door are the two eldest sons of the king, viz. (on the right) Ameniti-
khopeshf(Am1non in his sword) and (on the left) Rahimmemif (Ra at
his left hand); beside the outer volossi are the princes Meritum
(right) andMerim (left); and beside each of the colossi of the queen
are statues of the priueesses Jferitamon (right) and Honttrlui (left),
with sistra in their hands. The first and third pillars on the right
bear interesting inscriptions: 'Ile (the king) has made the temple

in an excavation ( Reheat) in the mountain, in everlasting
GM

as
work, in the land of Khent" , 'Frontier-land' or'llow-land',

and 'flis Majesty has commanded to make a temple in the land of
Khent, in en excavation in the mountain: never was suvh a thing
done before'. A narrow portal admits to the temple, which, to judge
from a relief and inscription beside the door, was dedicated also to
Ammon and a llorus (em heb).

The Main [lull is prartieally the only one in this temple, as the
rooms behind are merely its dependencies. It is 34 ft. deep and
27 ft. broad, and has six pillars in two rows, ear-h decorated with
the head of llathor 1sith the cow's, ears Q, and bearing the ear-.
