stele of l’iankhi. The whole province was at first called the lake-land,
then the district of Crocodilttpolis, and lastly the Arsinoite Nome. The
deity most highly revered here was the eroeodile-headed Sehek, the rep-
tile saered to whom was carefully tended in Lake Moeris. At the same
time the voracious and dangerous monster, notwithstanding the reverence
paid to it 011 aeeount of its eonneetion with the inundation, was also
regarded as Typhouie, and the Crocodilnpulitan nnme was therefore
passed over in the lists ot'nemes. - At the period preceding that of the
Psamtikides of the 26th Dynasty the Labyrinth appears to have been used
as' a hall for great imperial assemblies. At the period of the Ptelemies
and the Itomans the products of the Faytiu1 were mueh extolled. 'The
Arsiuuite Nome.', says Strabo, 'is the most remarkahle nfall, both en ae,-
emint of its scenery and its fertility and Cultivation. For it alone is
planted with large, full-grown, and richly productive o1ive-trees, and the
nil is good when carefully prepared; those who are neglectful may im.
deed obtain oil in abundance, but it has a bad smell. In the rest of
Egypt the olive-tvee is never seen, except in the gardens of Alexandria,
where under favourable cireumstances they yield olives, but no nil. Vines,
corn, padded plants, and matey other products also thrive in this district
in 110 small abuudanee'. - Strabu’s description is still applieahle at the
present day. The oranges and mandarins, peaches, olives, figs, eaetus
fruit, pomegranates, and grapes grown here are much esteemed, and the
beautiful, AeA-eoloured red roses of the gardens of the Fayihn, which
were once 50 lavishly strewn at the banquets of Cleopatra, still thrive
here. At the statiun of hledinet erFayfun small phials of attar of rinses,
nt' inferior quality, are frequently uttered for sale. hsma% Pasha denuded
special attention to this favoured part of his dosninions. The fields, which
are watered by means of wheels of peculiar eonsiruetion, yield riee, sugar,
eettnn, flax, and hemp, besides the usual cereals. The beginning of No..
vember is probably the season at which the traveller will obtain the most
distinct idea of the fertile character of the district. - The Inhabitants

The branch-line to the Faytuu runs towards the W., across
cultivated land, to the village of Abu flildi, beyond which it tra-
verses a desert tract for 35 min., and then crosses the low and
bleak Libyan ehain of hills, reaching its highest point at a level of
190 ft. above the sea. We then descend, cross the Baler el-. Warden,
which flows towards the 1',alirytsuf from the N., and then the water-.
eourse of el-Bats (p. 38), and near the station of (19 M.) et-Ad'weh
(09 ft.), 011 the right, we again perceive cultivated land. On the
left is a cemetery with the dilapidated tombs of several shékhs.
Numerous palm-brauehes are placed by the tombstones as tokens of
affection. On the right stretches an ancient ilyke, which once may
have belonged to the embankment of Lake Mueris (p. 40). We,
pass' the station of el-Nasliib, traverse rich arable land, and soon
reach (231/2 M.) -
