in later Christian times, and the tine ancient sculptures were co-
vered with lime and gaudily painted in the early Christian style.

Beyond this space were the series of chambers forming the
Sanctuary, now accessible only from the side next the river. This
is certainly the most ancient part of the temple, and unusually
clearly-cut hieroglyphies inform us that it was built by the same
monarch who reared the Colossi of Memnon, i.e. by Amenhotep Ill.
The first Room (Pl. F), with four columns, contains a series of re-
presentations of homage and sacrifice before Ammon Generator,
and in the chamber to the E. of it (Pl. n) are represented the con-
tinement of the mother of the king (Mut-em-ua) and the nursing of
the infant Amenhotep. Beyond Room F is the Holy of Holies (Pl. CI).
It is doubtful whether Assyrians 01' Persians destroyed the original
sanctuary, but at all events after the Macedonians had conquered
Egypt and after the death of Alexander the Great, it was restored
in the name of Alexander IL, for whom Ptolemy Soter I. ruled
as 'satrap'. Alexander boasts in the dedicatory inscription of hav-.
ing restored the work of Amenhotep. The last rooms of this part of
the temple have now also been excavated, and contain various fine
sculptures of the 18th Dynasty. Ammon of Thebes, especially in
his ithyphallie form as the productive power, appears everywhere
as the chief deity of the temple, receiving sacrifices and bestowing
gifts. In the chamber adjoining the last square hall traces have
been found of a staircase ascending to the roof of the temple.

Travellers who arrive at Luxor in the morning should devote the
afternoon to a tirst visit to Karnak; if they arrive in the evening they
should spend on it the next morning. Karnak is about 1[211193. ride from
Luxor; ass 1 fr., for the whole day 2 fr. Guides Cs.; p. 103), who speak
a little broken English, are useful to save time on a tirst visit, but they
are not indispensable. The donkey-boys and temple-keepers also speak
broken English. A visit to Karnak Ly moonlight is exceedingly attractive,
but travellers are advised not to make it alone, even although there is
nothing to fear from robbers.

Next to the Tombs of the Kings, Karnak is by far the most in-
teresting part of ancient Thebes. Even under the Pharaohs the group
of temples here was considered the most striking creation of an age
peculiarly famous for architectural avhievemeuts. Centuries have
here destroyed much, yet there is no other building in the world
that can match the dimensions of the temple of Ammon at Karnak.
The brilliant life that once enlivened these halls with enlour and
sound has long slept in silence beneath the dust. Could it be re-
called by some magician's wand it would present to the beholder a
dazzling aud bewildering scene of unique splendour; but it may
be questioned whether the admiration and interest commanded by
the temple in its uninjured ansl frequented days could equal the
pure enjoyment 1xhich is awakened in the breast of the sympathetic
