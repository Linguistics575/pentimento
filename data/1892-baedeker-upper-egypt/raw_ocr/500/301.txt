obese appearance, ttson and a daughter, as well as a donkey, to carry the
princess on her travels. Unfortunately this piece of wall has been de-
stroyed by tourists, and only a small fragment showing the princess and
her husband is preserved in the museum at Gizeh.

The representation ends with a settlement of the inhabitants ofPunt.
It lies close to the water which is populated by tish, turtles, and crayfish,
and it would seem as if the inhabitants were lake-dwellers. At all events
their conical houses rest upon piles. The door eOuld only be reached hy
a ladder, which the artist has not forgotten to represent. Palms and in-
cense-trces give shade to the village. In this southern landscape appear, or
rather used to appear, on the right a cow reclining, and On the left a long-
tailed bird flying through the air.

The third terrace was formed by the roof of this hall, on the
inner wall of which were the above-described paintings, together
with a Temple, placed in the centre and supported by round columns
and by the ground behind. From this terrace a well-preserved
granite doorway leads to the burial chambers lying behind (see
below).

At the end of this terrace to the left there is a remarkable small
Sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Hathor, and built by Hatasu and
her husband-brother Tutmes II., which should not be left unvisited.
The two outer rooms are in ruins, so that even the partition-walls
hetweeen the halls lying one behind the other are scarcely reeogniz-
able. home of the pillars and bases of the columns, however, are
still uprigl t. We turn to the right and find the remains of a Hathor
Cow. Thgre are also some more paintings of ships, but very faint.
0n the outer wall of the temple built into the mountain, is an ox
licking the hand of king, Le. queen Ramaka. As the adjoining
text says, 'She licks Horus to whom she gave birth'. To the right
of the door is Tutmes III. [Ita-men-kheper-ka), and within Tut-
mes II. who built the door and gave his name to it.

The Burial Chambers lying behind are reached through an ante-.
chamber with two small niches on each side. This is succeeded by
another long room with a flat blue ceiling, ornamented with red stars
at one time probably gilt. On each side of this funeral chamber
are niches. Next is a narrow room with two niches. At the back
of this last on the two side-walls above the shaft is an exceedingly
interesting *Representation of Queen IIatasu, drinking the milk of
life from the udders of the Hathor Cow. The cow is the finest piece
of animal painting which has come down to us from Egyptian an-
tiquity. The cartouche of the queen was erased, probably by order
of her indignant ward Tntnies III. when he became independent.
All the inscriptions and paintings in this room (eynocephali, lions,
etc.) are perfect in style; those in the niches tell us that these were
used for the storing of offerings.

The last or Fourth Terrace is badly preserved. We first come to
a granite doorway built by Tutmes III. on the central path, on the
left hand side of which we see an inscription of the 3rd year of
Jferenptalt I. Next we, reach the tower and fragments of wall, both
of rough Nile bricks, belonging to the monastery or church, which
