Other claims upon the traveller‘s time witt he made in Thebes. If he,
have paid a visit to one of the consular-agents, he will be invited to a
Futuasiga, and if he have brought good introductions, the fantasiya will
be preceded by a dinner. Among the modern Arabs the word 'fantastya'
is applied to every kind of amusement, from the aimless discharging of
muskets, to the greatest festivity. In the present connection it signifies
an evening party, at which the chief entertainment is the more or less
skilful dancing of hired gliawiizi, and which is recommended especially
to gentlemen who have not before seen anything of the kind. Chibouks,
cigarettes, coffee, and liqueurs are offered to the guests.

Antiquities. The traveller in Thebes is frequentlytempted to purchase
antiquities. Half the population of Luxor is engaged in trafhe with am
tiquities, and the practice of fabricating searabtei and other articles
frequently found in tombs is by no means unknown to the other half.
Many of the articles offered for sale are so skilfully imitated that even
experts are sometimes in doubt as to their genuineness; the ordinary
traveller seldom m- neVur secures an authentic specimen. Only as many
piastres as they ask shillings should ever be otfez-ed to the importunate
hawkers of antiquities at the temples and tombs. Those who desire a
genuine memorial of antiquity should apply to the director of the hotel
or to one of the above named consular agents. Even in this case, however,
absolute certainty is not attainable: for though honourable traders them-
selves, the consular agents are liable to he deceived in the purchases
they make. Caution should be observed in the purchase of unopened
Pltpyrus Rolls,- for dishonest vendors are in the habit of pasting torn
fragments of papyrus (frequently found in tombs) upon canes so as to
present the appearance of genuine papyrus-rolls. Egyptian antique bronzes,
with artificial rust, are made wholesale in Trieste, Paris, and Hanan;
Cairo and Luxor have the best factories for the fabrication ofantiques in
terracotta and carved wood. valuable and genuine antiques may, however,
still be obtained in Luxor by those who are prepared to spend money.
The prices are high; 31. being now charged for a genuine scarabeeus.
Good and reliable specimens. including papyri, may be obtained from
3lohammed 3I'hasseb and 'Abd el-Blegid.

Photographs. Good photrgraphs are produced by A. Beaio in Luxor;
but even in Shepheard’s and other hotels in Cairo, excellent photographs
of Egyptian temples are sold at moderate prices. Those by fl. Béchard
are distinguished for artistic taste; those by Sébah are also good. - Photo-

Guides and Donkeys. A guide is of great assistance in saving time.
The charge is 4-5 fr. per day, or more for a large party. Guides on the
E. bank are not allowed to serve on the W. bank, and vice versa. The
following guides may be recommended: On the right bank (for Karnak),
[Irwin Ahmed, Selan, and 'Abd eZ-Jlegid: 0n the left (WO bank, 'AN, who
can take good ruhtings; Jfohammed 'Ali, Aliment Gorgdr, 'Abd al-3ftrrvylr,
Jsma'tt. Huse‘n, frharifeh and his son Selim, Ahmed 'Abd er-ftasiU, etc.

The Dosrricss on the E. side of Thebes are good and have good saddles.
To Karnak 1 fr. or ls., and as much more when the traveller is called for or
keeps the ass for the day. On the w. side the donkeys, which are much
more heavily worked, are not so good, but they are fairly well saddled.
t‘harge 2fr. per day. The hotels on the E. bank provide donkeys; on
the w. bank they must be ordered heft rehand. -- Little girls with water-
bottles run after the traveller, especially on the W. bank, keeping up
with the donkeys with tireless agility. thae should he selected and repaid
with a few piastres on the return. The attractive faces of these merry
children sometimes vividly recall the portraits of Egyptian Women of the
time of the Pharaohs.

Sport. Sportsmen may have an opportunity of shootinga jackal, the
best time and place being at and after sunset near Bibiin e1-3rult1k or the
Ramesseum. An experienced hunter is to be found at the Luxor Hotel.
Hyenas are sometimes shot on the Karnak side. In March numerous quail
are found here.
