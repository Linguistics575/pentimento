spicuons as a city of temples and priests, but its inhabitants de-,
clined in wealth. It may be easily conjectured that these, formerly
the chief among the citizens of Egypt, here but ill the fate which
now placed them far behind the Alexandrians. Strangers sat on the
throne of Ila, and cared not to take the trouble to visit in person
the remote 1)iospolis, the coronation-towu of the Pharaohs, who
had been accustomed to make a triumphai entry after each victory
and to offer thanks to Ammon. The earlier noble Lagidae were sne-
eeedetl by worthless rulers, whose extravagant tastes forced them
to drain the resources of the Theba'id and other provinces. Un-
der the gluttonous Energetes II. and his consort Cleopatra Cocce
the Alexandrians rose in revolt and expelled Alexander L, tho
king's son. The citizens of the capital of Upper Egypt dared also
to rise in the attempt to win back their lost independence; and
they refused to lay down their arms even when Ptolemy Soter II.
(Lathyrus) was recalled from banishment by the Alexandrians and
was universally recognized in Lower Egypt. The army ofLathyrns
besieged the town, whose inhabitants bravely defended themselves
in the huge temples, each of which served as a fortress. Finally,
however, Thebes was stormed; its treasures were plundered and
its venerable monuments terribly mutilated. Thenceforward Thebes
is only mentioned as a goal of inquisitive travellers, who under the
Roman emperors were attracted to the tiile by two monuments in
particular - the pyramids and the musical colossus of Memnon on
the W. bank at Thebes. Diodorus (60 13.0.) and Strabo (2dB.00
describe Thebes as it was after the destruction. The latter found
only a few relics on each side of the Nile, just as the traveller of
to-day does. An earthquake, no common occurrence in Egypt,
had done more than the hand of the fierce warrior to destroy the
monuments of thousands of years. In 27 or 24 11.0. a convulsion
of this nature wrought such havoc that Ensehins declared, though
not without exaggeration, that the Egyptian Thebes had been
levelled with the ground. In the absence of some such natural
force, we should be tempted to declare that the annihilation of
many parts of the monuments of Thebes must have been a task
only less difficult than their construction. At many points, especi-
ally in the temple at Karnak, the injury is plainly to be ascribed
to human hands. The representations, dating from the period of
the Ptolemies, within the second main pylon, to the left as we ap-
proach the large hypostyle 'hall, have beerrremoved with axes or
hammers. Some smaller injuries, especially to the names of the
kings, were due to political reasons, as when Tutmes 111., after he
obtained the sole power, destroyed the cartonches of his too ambi-
tious sister and guardian; others are to be ascribed to the evil habit
of certain Pharaohs of appropriating the monuments of their pre-
decessors by substituting their own names for those of the real
builders; and yet others had religious causes, as when the name of
