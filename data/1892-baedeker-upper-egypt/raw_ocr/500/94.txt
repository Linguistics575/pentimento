of pottery of the time of Tutankhamon and Ramses IL, resembling the
most ancient potsherds found at Mycenae. The coffin of Amentursha,
discovered here, is now at Oxford. The pottery bears Egyptian stamps,
but also letters of the Cyprian, Phwnieian, and other alphabets.

Birket el-frurt"tn and Fatt J.ruriin (tent, horses, provisions, ete.,
comp. p. 34). The RAILWAY from Medinet el-Fayt1rn via (ilenru and
Abu Gonsheh to ('15 M.) Abuksah [see below) and thence to Sen-
Mr and (71,’21\I.) Tirseh is used almost exclusively for the con-
veyance of sugar-0ane to the manufactories of the Eheilive. Trav-
ellers going by railway Cone train daily from Medineh to Abuksah,
starting about noon, and performing the journey in about 1hr.)
must take horses with them for the continuation of their journey.
The following routes are all practicable, but the third is to be
preferred: -

(1) We proceed by land vie N zleh [where boats must be ordered
for the passage of the lake) to Eager Kum’tn; then by water to
Dimeh, and again by water to the s. bank of the lake, situated in
the latitude of fienhor, which lies about d, M. inland. The horses
should be sent on from Igaer Iiuriin to the lake (unless the some-
what refractory guides refuse to obey), in order that we may ride
to f,ijenhfor, and thence to Medinet e1-Faytlrn. Four or five days are
required for the excursion; the points of interest are mentioned in
the third route. The road from Nezleh [see below) to J.'Gs.ar Jiurtrn
L4hrs.)1eads through the desert, past the remains of a small temple,
called by the Arabs Tfatr eh--Betttt, or 'Maidens' Castle'.

(Pi) If the traveller renounees Dimeh and Kay Tiuriin, and is
satisfied with the sport to be obtained in the Baht el-Whili, he may
easily make the excursion in 21/2-3 days. On the first day the route
skirts the railway (see above) to (P hrs.) Senn‘t; it then leads
through a plantation of opuntia, the growth of which is so gigantic
that it almost resembles a forest, and across a sandy tract overgrown
with tamarisks to Cl?, hrs.) Abuksah, situated on a hill, and com-
manding a fine survey of the lake and the Libyan mountains. At
the N. base of the hill near the railway station (see above) is a sugar
manufactory, superintended by a Frenchman, who accords a kind re-
ception to travellers. We now proceed to the S.W. across meadows,
and through a somewhat marshy district, to (21/2 hrs.) Absheh, sit-
uated. close to Nezleh. (The traveller is recommended to spend the
night in a tent rather than among the Beduins.) Next day we fol-
low the valley of the Balzr el- Wadi (or Baln- Nezleh), which is
bounded by large mud-hills, to the lake (21/2 hrs.), where we spend
the middle of the day. (The numerous dead fish on the bank of the
lake render its proximity unpleasant; boats are to be hail from the
Beduins.) In the evening we return to Absheh, and on the third
day to Medinet el-Fay11m.

C3) Four days at least are required for the somewhat longer
route vil f.1enhu and the lake to Iias.sr Iiurtm, if the traveller wishes
to visit Dimeh, and shoot on the lake. The route first skirts the
