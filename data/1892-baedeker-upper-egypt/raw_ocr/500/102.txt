temple to Perseus, worshipped him with Hellenic rites, and held games
in his honour. The citizens elaiu ed Perseus as a native of their town
and told the garrulous Halicarnassian that he had visited Khemmis, when
on his way to Libya in pursuit of the Gorgon's head, and had recognised
them as his kinsmen. A statue of him stood in the temple. From time
to time the hero revisited Khemmis, leaving, as a sign of his presence,
his sandals, which were two ells long; the finding of these was con-
sidered a porteut ofgeod fortune. The festival of pole-climbing, celebra-
ted in honour of Khem, probably suggested his identification with the
Greek Pan. - It is obvious that Perseus has been confused with Horus,
the destroyer of Typhon-Seth. Among the various forms assumed hy the
'Libyan Monster' in his long battle with Horus was that of a dragon 01'
serpent, while Horus, like Perseus, was supported by wings in his eu-
wunter; hence the mistake of Herodotus. In any case he is excusable
for seeking in Egypt the home of Perseus, whose genealogy may be traced
back to lo. ' It is an interesting fact that a later author states that the
Persea tree was thrst planted in Egypt by Perseus. As no goat-Noted
deities have been so far discovered in the Egyptian eult, it is somewhat
diflieult, to explain bow Khem came to be identified with Pan, unless on
account of his Priapiau characteristics. The Pans and satyrs at Khemmis
first received and disseminated the news of the, death of Osiris, and hence,
says Plutareh, the sudden dread and confusion of a multitude is called
panic. Akhmim is thus the true home of Panic Fear. A white bull and a
black cow were sacred to lihem. He appears in the triad along with the
child Horus and Isis Sekhet, surnamed t-erpa (trepha), whence the Greeks
may have formed the name TriphiS. Tryphama was also a eoghomeu of
some of the queens of the Ptolemaie line.

Khemmis still flourished in the Roman period, and its ancient
and famous temple was finally eompleted in the 12th year of Trajan.
After christianity established itself here, the vicinity of Panopolis
became crowded with eonvents. Nestorius, Bishop of Constantin-
opie, who had been banished to the oasis of Hibeh (Khargeh,
Egypt. Heb, p. 352) on account of his disbelief in the divine
motherhood of the Virgin Mary, was attacked there by the plunder-
ing Blenimyes, and carried captive into the Theha'itl, where he
surrendered himself to the prefect of Panopolis, to avoid a charge
of wilful tlight. He died in Panopolis-Akhmim. Even after the
conquest of Egypt by Islam, the temple of the 'great town' of
Akhmim was, as Abulteda and other Arabs relate, among the most
important remains of the days of the Pharaohs. Edrisi gives the
following account of it: 'At Akhmim we see the building called the
Barbe (Le. Perpa, Coptic for temple), which the first Hermes erected
before the flood . . . . . (of many ancient temples) that of Akhmim
is the most enduring and also the most remarkable for the beauty
of its svulpture. In truth we tind represented in it not a few stars
only, hut also various arts and artists, along with numerous in-
seriptions. The building lies in the midst of Akhmim'. Since this
account a great part of the town must have vanished, as the temple
ruins now lie outside it, to the N. They are neither extensive nor
beautiful, but are of interest to the savant, because they belonged,

 

' Damtii, the mother of Perseus, was the daughter of Aerisius, son
of Alias, son of Lyneeus and Hypermnestra. Lyneeus was the son of
Aigyptos, and Hypermnestra was the daughter of Danaos, from whom
tho line runs up through Belos, Libye, and Epaphos (Apis) to Io.
