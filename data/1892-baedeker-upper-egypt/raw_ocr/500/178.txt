114 Route JO, LUXOR. East Bantu

colossi, and the various subsidiary details, is still not 1min1posiug;
and the whole entrance to the temple at Luxor is unusually pic-
turesque, perhaps on account of the very abundance of small details
which are unrestrainedly placed here side by side with the huge
and dignified.

Beyond the principal pylon was the Great Peristyle Court (PI. A),
“hieh was entirely surrounded by a double row of columns (twelve
pairs on earh of the four sides). It measures 185 ft. in length and
167 ft. in breadth. This hall was at one time completely built up, but
the W. side at least has now been laid bare. The most recent excava-
tions have revealed a portico, dating from Ramses IL, on the inner
side of the N.W. wall of the court. The architectonic purport of
this portico, which is somewhat lower than the court and has three
clustered columns, is not apparent. Between the inner row of Co-
ltrrnns on the S. side of the court arrows and shields of Ilamses ll.
were placed. A mosque situated within this court prevents the ex-
cavation of the E. wall, and considerably mars the general effect.
llamses H. founded the court, but the Ethiopian Sabako wrote his
name 011 the portal, while Ptolemy Philopator wrote his on several
of the abaci. On the S. side this court. was terminated by a smaller
Pylon, beyond which, though not with the same axis (see above),
is a Colonnade (Pl. B), 58 yds. long, built under the 18th Dynasty.
The last is in tolerahly good preservation and contributes essentially
to the dignified appearance of the ruins ofLuxor when viewed from
the river-haul; 01' still more from the island crossed 0n the way to
visit the monuments of W. Thebes. Seven couples of columns,
nearly 4?, ft. in height, with calyx-capitals, still support a heavy
architrave above a lofty abacus. The “hole was built by Amen-
hotep 111., but King Horus;, Seti1., and Seti 11. have also recorded
their names Upon it. The marvellous, play of colour shown by this
colonnade with its deep, heavy shadows when the setting sun sheds
a rosy light upon the E. sky, is nowhere excelled. The Second
Peristyle Court (Pl. q) had double rows of columns on its N., E.,
and w. sides. These, belonging to the order of sculptured papyrus-
bud columns, are specially effective as seen from the river-bank.
The court was 48 yds. long and 55 yds. broad, and ends in a Jlypo-
style Hail (Pl. D), the roof of Which was borne by J? sculptured
bud-columns arranged in 4 rows of 8. The two sphiuxes at the en-
trance bear the name of Sebekhotep 11. (13th Dynf). This hall was
barely ?.0 yds. deep and 35 yds. wide, and for some unexplained
reason its E. wall forms an acute angle (instead of a right angle)
with the S. wall of the preceding peristyle court. The Open Space
(Pl. E), which we next find, is entered from the river side, and is
specially commended to the travelle/s attention. The ancient PII-
trance to the sanctuary-chambers has here been altered into a kind
of apsidal recess, bounded on the right and left by two granite Co-
rinthian columns. The court in front of this was used as a church
