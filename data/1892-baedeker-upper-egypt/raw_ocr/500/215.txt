preserved here. The roof of the First Room is supported by two
Ptolemaic columns, with llathor-masks on the abacus. To the right
and left of this wide hall are two rooms, and behind are three
others, the middle one of which gives access to the Sanctuary. The
inscriptions on the walls owe their origin to the Ptolemies; the
earliest, as the dedication-inscription also informs us, to Ptolemy IN.
Euergetes 11., and to Cleopatra, his sister and wife. The pregnant
hippopotamus-goddess Apet was the goddess of births. Iler finely
executed statue of serpentine, found in the ruins of the ancient
city, is now in the museum at Gizeh. It dates from the 26th Dy-
nasty. The inscriptions and representations refer largely to Osiris,
whose birth was commemorated here, and to the gods associated
with him. On the outside of the temple-wall and on the walls ad-
joining it are found the names of Ptolemy Auletes and the emperor
Augustus. A list of homes, also found here, is unfortunately much
damaged.

rapid riding We proceed first to the E. sphinx-avenue of Karnak, where
the road diverges to the right, plong a large embankment. It then turns
to the left and runs mostly along the edge of ditches, frequented, especially
in December, by wild fowl.

The Temple of Nedamist, :t one time tt large and beautiful edifice, is
now so completely ruined that even its ground-plan cannot be traced. The
village, a kind of suburb of Thebes, was called Teman and lay to the N.
of the temple. Month of Thebes was the god chie'ly worshipped here, but
Buto (uazi) and Apet were also revered. rthe erection of this temple dates
from the time of Amenhotep 11., of the 16th Dynasty. His name occurs
on the large granite pillars which are still standing and which probably
formed part of the Sanctuary. Numerous blocks of granite lie scattered
around. The sanctuary wus adjoiued by a large ediliee, lying approxi-
mately from E. to W. Much farther to the w. was a Pylon, facing the
river, but now destroyed, leaving nothing hut a heap of blocks of sand-
stone. Various fragmentary inscriptions in a good style inform us that
it. was built by ueti I. and Ramses II. Under the Ptolemies an addition
was made to the earlier temple, including the Colonnade, which is now
the most conspicuous and most interesting feature of the ruins. Five
columns are still standing. Four of these, on which still rests the stone
arehitrave, appear to have bounded a now destroyed peristyle court and
to have formed the first row of columns in ahypostyle hall, which cannot
have existed before the time of the I’t‘olemies The other column is the
only relic of the second row. Both this and the two bud-columns (to the
left) in the first row appear to helung to the 18th Dynn, the two latter
certainly did, for their sculptured shafts and capitals clearly indicate that
the artistic idea which dictated their form still ret ined a vigorous
freshness at the time of their erection. 0n the other hand the late ela-
borate plastic decoration of the calyx-eapitals of the other two columns
more to the right, the curious closing of the intercolumniations by means
of barrier-like walls, half as high as the shafts, and crowned with a concave
cornice, and the treatment of the doors, whose absent covering was merely
indicated on both sides hy erections with concave cornices, would in them-
selves he proofs that the building was not erected before the epoch of the
Ptolemies, even if the inscriptions did not contain the same information.
Bees have built their nests in many of the deep hieroglyphics which com-
pose the inscriptions, but we can still distinguish the names ut Ptolemy 1X.
