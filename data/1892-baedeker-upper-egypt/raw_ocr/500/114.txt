The:Second Hypostyle Room (Pl. D) resembles the first, but is
higher, deeper, and in all respects of more importance. Seti I. be-
gan it and his artists executed both the architectural details and
the plestie adornment with the earefulness and purity of style that
marks all their work. The son has here left unchanged the name
of the father, which occurs at every point. Three rows of twelve
columns each support the architrave, on which rest the 1nofing,
slabs, and are arranged in six groups, each of six columns. Ile-
tween the groups access is afforded to the vaulted chambers in the
wall facing us as we enter. The first two of the three rows of col-
ums have papyrus-bud capitals. Beyond the second row the floor of
the temple is considerably raised, forming a platform from which
the vaulted chambers are entered. Upon this platform stands the
third row of columns, the cylindrical shafts efwhieh are entirely
destitute of capitals, but bear huge blocks of stone forming an aba-
cus for the support of the arehitrave. This peculiarity is simply ex-
plained by the fact that the columns in the third row are shorter
than the others, owing to their raised platform, so that the architect,
by omitting the capital, brings the abacus of all on the same level
and avoids the unpleasant effect which different elevations of' the
architrave would make on the eye. When processions of worshippers
filed in and out, performing pious ceremonies, this hall must have
presented a very imposing spectacle. Jrtscriptions below the open-
ings leading from the first hall to the second inform us they were
formerly filled with doors of bronze (asem). The inscriptions and
representations on the walls and columns repeat themselves weari-
somely and are of little general interest. Here we see the king; re-
ceiving from the gods such attributes of the royal dignity as the
crooked sword or the scourge and crook (symbols, perhaps, of the
royal duties ofineentive on the one side and restraint on the other);
there we behold him offering burnt-offerings to a single god, a
triad, " a group of gods. 1f the king, is receiving, gifts, he is
generally represented on his knees; when he saeritieos, he leans
slightly forward, holding the burnt-offeriug in the left hand and
libations in the right. Sometimes he is seated, receiving the bless-
ings of the gods; he appears thus in the fiile picture on the N. Wall
of the second room, with Isis, Amenti, and Nephthys in front, and
the goddess Ma and llenpet behind. His profile is evidently a faith-
ful likeness and is everywhere portrayed with great artistic skill.
The unusual handsemeness of this king is still recognisable in his
mummy at Gizeh. The saeriticial implements should also be noted.
Censers like that in his hand have been found, but in bronze, while
his were doubtless of gold. They are in the form of an arm, the
hand holding a small vessel from which the smoke of the incense
arises. The handle shows the carefully executed sparrow hawk's
head of Horus. The libatieu vessel was in the form of a golden lo-
tus flower, with small vases rising above the open corolla, from which
