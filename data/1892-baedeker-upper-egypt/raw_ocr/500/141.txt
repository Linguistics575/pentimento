night, on the left (N.) the twelve hours of the day, each with their
eponymous divinities.

The interior band on the W. side exhibits three designs re-

ferring to the moon, which is here represented as 'uza', eye.

In the first are the Li days of the waning moon, in the second the
14 days of the waxing moon, represented by " divinities ascending
a flight of steps, while the victorious Thoth appears as a flfteenth
divinity beyond the moon-dise. Finally appears Usiris as the moon-
god, seated with Isis am] Nephthys in a boat, floating above the
symbol of the sky F==il, which is supported by four female forms. --
In the TI. section the interior band exhibits the course of the surr-
disc through the 12 hours of the day, represented by 12. boats. In
each disc appears the fig11re of the divinity to which the particular
hour was sacred.

through which the sacrificial offerings used to be brought into the
hall Lcom. p. 88).

size, 451/2 ft. square. On festal days the image f l t l

of the mighty sun-goddess was carried in so-

holies, and was not seen by the multitude as- .

hall, when the lofty double doors were thrown C2s
