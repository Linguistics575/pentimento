vi PREFACE.

HEIGHTS above the sea-level and other measurements are
given in English feet 01' miles.

Though nearly every page of the Handbook has been
compiled from personal observation and experience, and
although the conservative East is not nearly so liable to
changes as the more progre.ssive West, the Editor makes no
claim to absolute accmacy in every detail; and he will feel
indebted to any traveller Who, from pe1sona1 experience,
may be able to indicate' ermrs or omissions in the Handbook.
The same remark applies equally- to the PRICES 11nd various
items of expenditure mentioned 1n the volume. The expense
of a tom is much more directly affected ,by, the circumstances
of the moment {11111 the. individuality of the traveller in the
East than in E1116pethâ€™011gh it may here be added that the
arrangements of 'tiiv'iiiiiir.H,t1'iiiCG)'i' (h)ze (pp.srv, sv), of
which most visitors to Upper EO' gypt will avail themselves,
offer a comparative immunity against estortion.A eartf11lly
drawn up contract will similarly p1otect those who prefer to
hire a dhahabiyeh for themselves.
