291h Day. Arrival in Cairo.

Holders of' Cooks' tickets may break their journey at Luxor or
Assuin either on the way up or the way down (after previous ar-
rangement with Cooks' manager in Cairo), and proceed by a sub-
sequent steamer, if there are vacant berths. The mail-steamers,
usually less crowded than the others, may be used in descending
the stream. In all these deviations from the usual tours, very strict
adherence to the terms of the specialarrangement is exacted. Trav-
ellers are strongly recommended to time their voyage so as to ar-
rive at Luxor 3-4 days before full moon; for moonlight adds a pe-
culiar charm to a visit to the ruins here and at Assuin.

Passengers by steamer should beware of the risk of catching
cold by leaving the windows of their cabin open. They should also
avoid placing themselves too near the edge of the deck; and it is
well to remember (3.9. when shaving) that the steamers.frequently
run aground, especially above Luxor. Liability to delay through
this last fact, makes it impossible to be sure of reaching Cairo in
time to make connection with the ocean-steamers.

Philae to Wadi Halfah), see p. 299.
