including some of the Ptolemies, placed inscriptions With their
names on the ancient buildings. The PRINCIPAL PYLON is easily
recognized by the obelisks and colossi at its portal. The visitor who
places himself in front of this perceives at once that rubbish and
earth conceal one-half" the sloping faeade which is richly adorned
with carvings and inscriptions now sadly damaged. Like all pylons,
the one before us consists of two truncated pyramids with an Bll-.
trance-door between them. The latter was 65 ft. in height. The side-
towers, Which rose about '?.0 ft. higher, were crowned with an ele-.
gant concave cornice, which has now almost completely disappeared,
and were framed with the astragal. The entranee-door is com-
pletely ruined. Under the cornice is a conspicuous Inscription in
large letters, Which may be traced also on the architrave of tho
peristyle court, wherever it has remained visible and entire. This
inscription contains a dedication, intimating that Ramses 11. built
this imposing edifice for his father Ammon-Ra, the king of the
Gods. On each side of the entrance were two monolithic Colossi,
40 ft. in height; the most easterly has disappeared, the three
others are half-huried in rubbish. In front of the central figures,
though not quite symmetrically placed, rose two Obelisks of pink
granite, one of Which (the W.) now adorns the Place de la Con-
corde at Paris. It is to be hoped that a crack, which has been
noticed in the monument from the days of antiquity, Will not lead
to its destruction under the influence of a northern climate. This
W. obelisk was smaller than its E. neighbour which is still stand-
ing; and the ancient architects endeavoured to counteract this in-
equality by giving the smaller obelisk a higher base than the other,
and placing it a little farther forward. The inscriptions on the
obelisk still standing at Luxor are clearly and finely cut in the stone
and are perfectly legible. They name Ramses the Pharaoh, with
many pretentious titles, as the founder of this gorgeous building
erected in honour of Ammon in southern Thebes (Apt res). The
faces of these obelisks, like those of most others, are slightly con-
vex, as the priestly architects observed that a Mt surface was apt to
appear concave in a strong light. Details supplied by the French
engineers give a vivid. idea of the enormous weight that had to be
handled in the erection of an obelisk, although the Paris obelisk is
comparatively small; considerably larger ohelisks are to be seen at
Karnak. The W. obelisk ot' Luxor is 75 ft. high, its base is 71/2 ft.
square, and its weight is ttpwards of 212 tons.

The exterior walls of the pylons of nearly every Egyptian temple
are adorned with representations referring to victories granted by
the gods of the sanctuaries to the royal builders. At Lnxor these
representations refer to victories granted by Ammon to Ramses II.
The rich sculpture with which the broad walls of the pylons Mere
revered has suffered severely from the hand of time. At several
places the Italiefs en crcut, deeply ent in the stone, are practically
