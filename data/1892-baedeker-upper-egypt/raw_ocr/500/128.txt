the Roman town and colony of Hytlremrm or Fons Trajrultts, which lies
in the latitude of liiit!, about 3 days' journey from Keneh. Outside the
walls lie a temple and other buildings, and some large columns and Greek
inscriptions have been found in the quarries, which were Worked ehiefly
in the time of Hadrian and Trajan. About two Jays' journey farther to
the N. is Gettel Dukhdn ('smoke mouutaiu'). the ancient pnrphyry quarries
of which were worked by the Romans. Here are the ruins of an 1onie
temple of the time of Trajan (never completed), some remains of an irre-
gularly built town, and two large water-reservnirs. The old route led
hence to Myos Hormos, the harbour of Which has been silted up and is
now practically useless. Travellers making for the Sinai Peninsula jour-
ney to the N. from the pot-phyry quarries for two or three Jays more,
and cross by boat to Ttir (see Eaedelau"s Lownr Egypt, p. 515). Those
who undertake one of these journeys should study the 'm.tisebriefe' of
Lepsius and wilyinsnn's well-known work.

A much more interesting journey than that to Gebel trukhiin is the
trip to I.osfr, or at least to it'ttdi Hamamatt. where there are numerous
Egyptian inscriptions. For the journey (there and hack) 10-11 days should
be allowed, and Egypiologists will probably want 2-3 days more. It is
generally undertaken from Eeneh, but We may also choose the ohl route
from {Ittft (Keptos, p. f)8), or we may start from Luxor. The first two
routes unite at eJ-Ifarn and are joined at Lairétnh by that from Luxor.
The necessary camels may be obtained in lgeneh with the aid of one of the
consular agents (comp. p. 72). The route from 1§eneh (telegraph-wires from
{His to linger) leads tirst through the villages of 'ShrTh Jlekdh, Demeh, and
Kim; Hnivih, which follow each other in quick succession. the first on the
left, the other two on the right side of the road. The tirst night is
generally spent at the caravanserai of Bir 'Ambar, about 3I'.e hrs. front

must inviting halting-plaee. The large earavanserai was erected at the
expense of an llxi-ahim Pasha fur the use of the Foy2r caravans and the
Mecca pilgrims. The structure comprises several separate buildings,
covered with dome-shaped roofs and surrounded by courts and colon-
nades. It has no owner and is free to everyone to use as he likes. As
nothing is done to keep it in repair, it is rapidly falling into decay, like
most of the Oriental buildings of the kind, and threatens soon to be a
complete ruin. In the deserts of Upper Egypt the temperature at night
is so mild, even in winter, that strong, and healthy persons may safely
sleep in the open air if warmly wrapped up; and for various reasuns this
is preferable to a night in the earnvanserai Those, however, who prefer
to take their chances in the interior should not fail t) make the most
minute examination of the room in which they intend to sleep, in order
to clear out the vermin with Which it is almost certain to be infested;
scorpions and venomous snakes are by no means uncommon visitants.

It is the duty ofthe Khalftr, or guide in charge of the caravan, to see
that everyone and everything, are ready hetimes in the morning, so that
a sufrieiently early start may be made to cover the ground allotted to
each day's march. He is held responsible for the safe conduct of the
entire party, and expects implicit obedience to his marching orders. We
Soon turn our hacks on the verdant green district hordering the Nile
and enter the barren desert, almost entirely destitute of vegetation, which
lies between the great river and the coast of the Red Sea, The first part
of the route is vcryiunedifying. We advance steadily, ascending almost
imperceptibly, through a monotonous plain, intersected in all directions
by small undulating heights. All around us extends the interminable
yellowish gray, sud-bleached rocks of the desert; not a trace of organic
life is visible, not a single green tree 0r shrub. At the bill of el-Karn

onwards we therefore follow one of the most ancient trading routes
