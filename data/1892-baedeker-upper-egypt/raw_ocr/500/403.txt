flowers, followed by the Nile-god Hapu and by Sekhet , Q ll , goddess

of the fields, who carries sacrificial cakes and fowls of various kinds
and is accompanied by a small bull. On the partition-wall, now

the front of the two columns are not only the names of the founders
of the pronaos, but also those of their ancestors, the divine Adelphi,
Huergetze, Philopatores, Epiphanes, and the divine Philometor;
while one of them is dedicated to the memory of Thoth ofPe-
