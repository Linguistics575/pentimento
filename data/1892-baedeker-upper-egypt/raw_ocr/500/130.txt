ning with the black mountains and stretching among them for a long way
is the Wirdi Eamémat, where the green hreeeia was quarried in the most
ancient times. In 1 hr. more we reach the Bfr Hamduuit, a well 16 ft. in
diameter, with a stone coping. Near the well are the remains ofa Roman
wall, and between the two are tive uri0nisheil sarcophagi, some completely
shattered. Near the well begins a series of short graffiti, including an
inscription of Phra em heb, a superintendent of labourers, and represent-
ing Ammon with a ram's head bearing the Atef crown. The cartouehe
ot' Seti II. is also met with. About 1 hr. farther on are longer inserip-
tions. In the first a miner named Art en benipe is mentioned and the

symbol of the erow-bar is given. The numerous inscriptions of the

old empire found here, belonging to the 5th, 6th, 11th, 12th, and 131h
Dynasties, have been published by Lepsius (Part 11. of his 'Denkmiilev')
and have recently been completed by W. Goleniseheir. They begin with
kings Tetkara-Assa and Unas of the 5th, and trserkara and Pepi of the Gth
Dynasty. The most interesting of all is the inscription of the 8th year of
Bankh karat, in which a military expedition from Koptos to linger is re-
corded; it gives the names of the stations, mentions the digging of two
cisterns, and relates the passage from Tue (the early name of 1.0ttev) to
the 'Holy Land' (ale. Arabia). The name of Rohannu also occurs. Among
the later inscription? of the 20th Dynasty may be mentioned one (if the
3rd year of Ramses ('Denkmiiher' of Lepsius, III, 219; transl. in Brugseh's
'History of Egypt', Eng. transl., Vol. 2, pp. 175 et seq.). We learn from
this inscription that in the part of this desert named Rohmmu

Misf, so called from the Bekhen found there, a dark-green, almost black,
and exceedingly hard diorite, which was highly prized hy the Egyptian
sculptors. This region is fsguved in the fragments of a map of the time
of Ramses 11. now preserved in the museum of Turin) and from it it
would seem that gold also was procured in the Bekhen Nts. In the treasury
of the temple of Medinet Habu we find mention made of gold from Kush

=
(Ethiopia), Tel) (Edfu), Nubit (Ombos) and It . By this Past we

should undoubtedly understand gold brought hy the K0pt0s trading route,
but not gold obtained there. The Turin Museum possesses the plan of
another map of a. gold-mining region (of the time of Seti 1.), the gold
from which seems to have been carried over the caravan-route ending
opposite Edfu. The inseriptions in the so-ealled Temple of Redésiyeh
(more properly 1iGdi 'Abbiis; see p. 253) treat of the water-supply on this
route to the gold mines.

In the great inscription of Ramses IV. a complete list is given of all
the higher and lower off1eials, as well as of all the workmen, including
800 Aperiu (from the desert to the E. of the Delta), who had been sent
to the quarries by command of the king. The total number amounts to
8368 souls, fOr whose support eommissariat columns were constantly
on the move between Koptos and Bekhen. At line 18 we read: 'Total 8368.
Provisions for these were brought upon ten waggons, and six yoke of
oxen were attached to each waggon in going from Egypt to the Bekhen
Nts.' - Among the later inscriptions is one of the time of Darius, giving
the genealogy of 25 architects. Xerxes and Artaxerxes are also mentioned
in the inscriptions of Persian offleiahs.

Just beyond the quarries the route turns from the N.E. to the S. and
passes the ruins of et-Patetikhir, an old mining site. Those who wish to
continue their journey to the Red Sea have still two short days' marches
ahead of them, the route leading through the Wddi Rdgtfah to Bc'dahwir
