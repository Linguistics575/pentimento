68 Route d. ABYDOS. Temple of Ramses IL

here is all the more striking from the obvious pains of the founder
to make a costly and enduring monument. Where Seti contented
himself with limestone, Ramses made lavish use of granite, Oriental
alabaster, and black graywacke. The remaining fragments show
that Ramses erected obelisks of granite in front of his cenotaph, and
that caryatide-like figures of Osiris, now long since shattered, stood
at the sides of the first peristyle court. Plastic ornamentation was
freely used and s0 richly painted that the colours have to this day
clung to some of the fragments. Ramses followed the example of
his father in eonseerati1og a chamber to the manes of his ancestors.
In 1818 Mr. Bankes discovered in the chamber to the left LE.) of
the first octostyle room a royal list of eighteen names, two of which
were partly destroyed, and the relies of these tablets are still in situ.
M. Mimaut, the French Consul General, tore down the walls on
which the important earto1:ehes were represented and sent the stones
to Paris, whence they passed by purchase to the British Museum.
Almost 110 inscription has been left intact here. We learn, however,
that Ramses was much more anxious than his father to record his
own achievements. Not a few names of peoples and towns which he
subdued or captured may still be discerned among the ruins.

The visitor will gladly arrest his steps by the representation of
a grand procession, which is to he found inside the great court, to
the right and left of the entrance. The procession, beginning at
the N.W. corner of the hall, which was formerly surrounded with
Osiris-pillars, extends over the whole of the N. wall. Four temple
offieials are represented, one described as a secretary, two with
leopard-skins as priests of Osiris and of the house of Ramses Me-
rianion Khnumt Abdu (connected with Ahydos), and the fourth as
Kerhnh. Animals, some living and some dead, are brought to them
for saerifiee. Among these are antelopes, geese, and oxen of extra-
ordinary size and fatness. 0n the right side of the fore-eourt are
similar scenes, in which the procession is still more grandly equipped.
Here appear the royal war-chariot, numerous officials, and negroes,
while incense is burned before the statue of the monarch. The co-
louring of these figures is surprisingly well preserved.

On the outside of the temple, N, side, is an inscription relating to
the Kheta war, discovered by Eisenlohr in 1570; unfortunately only the
lower parts of lines are preserved. Adjacent, to the W. and N., are
representations of events in the Kheta war, similar to those of the
Bamessenm at Thebes. The exterior of the S. wall is eovtsrei!.t'iil) a
long inseription, reeounting, the building of the temple, of which the
