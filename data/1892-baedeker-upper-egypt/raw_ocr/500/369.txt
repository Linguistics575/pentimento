12th Payni of the 3ist year of Gaesarâ€™. --. This Caesar is Caesar
Augustus, in whose reign therefore the wall, though furnished with
inscriptions by later empcrors, must have existed at least in a rough
state. The other inscriptions are of similar purport.

At the s. end of the E. Colonnade LPI. D) was a large Hall
(Pl. 0), of which only fragments of the N. and E, walls remain.
It bears the name of Tiberius. The colonnade, which adjoins its
N. wall, was never entirely completed. Only three of the capitals
of the columns (including a very tine palm-capital) are finished;
the rest are merely roughly blocked out, but they are of interest as
showing us that the more elaborate carving was not taken in hand
until after the capitals had been placed in position upon the shafts.
The E. colonnade does not extend as far as the first pylons, but is
separated from them by a small Temple of zEsculapius, the Egyp-
tian Imhotep, son of Ptah (Pl. E), consisting of two chambers, and

the decoration of the facade was added by PtolemySHI. Neos Dio-

with his mother and wife, presenting to [sis the symbol of a field.
The entire imposing erection is 150 ft. broad and (30 ft. high. The
S. facade, fronting the processions advancing from the Nile, is
covered with Beliefs en creux.

At each side of the Central Doorway (PI. b) is a ilgure of Isis. On
the upper part of the left tower is the Pharaoh sacrificing to Osiris and
