310 Route 30. BET EL-WALLI. From Phila:

that the temple was dedicated not only to the worship of the gods
Ammon-Ra, lord of Nubia, Horus, Isis, and the gods of the cataracts
Khnum, Anuke, and Sati, but also to the memory of the victories
gained by Ramses the Great over the tribes of the N. (Teheunu) and
of the S. tKushites). The victories over the N. tribes are depicted
on the N. wall; those over the S. tribes on the S. wall.

We turn first to the right (N. wall). The Tehenmt, a tribe of the Li-
byan stock, had settled to the W. of Egypt. They wore pointed beards,
and were distinguished by having the hair cut smooth across the brews,
with long, pendant side-locks. We begin our inspection of the reliefs
at the end to the left. Here appears the Pharaoh, seated in a unus,
holding in one hand a 1ong,istaiT bent at the top, and in the other the

symbol of rule hak, while On his head he wears a crown of bull’s

horns gl, , to which eight serpent-diadems are attached. At his feet

is a lion. In the upper row, Amonhianemif t'Ammon at his right hand'),
nne of his sons, armed with a. how, leads three bound prisoners to him.
In the lower row is a fan-hearer followed by a band of soldiers. Adjacent
is the inscription: 'The prince speaks, who is before His Majesty, llail
to thee, Oh good and beloved prince, son of Ammon, having proceeded
from his limbs. Thou goest out into the country. Thou art like Ra above,
who travels on the horizon. Then taxest the inhabitants of Egypt. Thou
art in the body of thy contemporaries. Thou wearest the different helmets.
Thou art an annihilator of the iII-doers in the body ofthy mother Isis. Thou
causest hoth halves of Horus to become green. Years like Tum, prince
of both lands, like Ptah ta tenen, red Egypt under thy feet, Khara (Sy-
ria), Kushi (Ethiopia) in thy hand. The land of Mara (Egypt) rejoices, U
prince, because thou hast widened its boundaries'. - The following scene
shows us the king on the point of cutting " the hair, Or perhaps even
the head, of one of the Tehennn, with a sickle-shaped knife. His dog
(antha em nekh) springs upon the kneeling foe. The king is here called
a 'strong lion, the lord of the sword, who binds the rebellious lands of
the Tehennu, and ents the nine alien peoples in pieces with his sword
and casts them under his feet. - In the third relief, the king in his
chariot aims a blow at two foes whom he holds by their hair, and presses
hard upon his enemies who are armed with spears. He is compared to
the war-god Mentu, lord of Thebes. He next appears on foot before a
fortress, and on the battlements above is the prince (abkher), whom
Ramses seizes hy the hair to kill him. On the lower battlements stand
men and women suing to the Pharaoh, of whom an inscription says,
'there is no other like Baal, O prince, his true son to all eternity'. A
woman is letting a child down from the castle to save it from death, a
man throws himself headlong down, while one of Ramses' followers is
heating in the doors with an axe. - In the Past scene on this side the
king appears with fettered enemies, some led to him by cords.

The reliefs on the S. Side, no less interesting, relate to the subjuga-
tion of the Kushites, although the inscription beside the king reads 'the
ruler of Egypt, who has subdued the nations, and made the borders as
he chose among the Retennu (Syrians and Assyrians)". Here again we
see the king’s sons in two rows bringing the captured booty to the Pha-
raoh. In the upper row, Amonhianemi.f, the king''s eldest son, points to a
stand adorned with flowers and leaves on which men kneel in supplice-
tion, while rings (of gold?) and skins hang from it; next is Amenemapt,
the king/s son of Rush, and behind him rings. bags, weapons, panther-
skins, shields, chairs, fans, and many other articles. The lower row is

introduced by three ofl'seials, carrying the and , and among ,.them
