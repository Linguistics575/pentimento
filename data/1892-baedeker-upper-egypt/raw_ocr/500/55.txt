thus, a species of Mormyrus (Arab. Mizdeh), Was held in such high honour
here, that the inhabitants refused to eat any fish caught by a hook, lest
the hook might previously have injured an Oxyrrhynchus. In the neigh-
bouring town of Cynopo1is (see below) the dog was held in equal honour,
and Plutarch relates how a 'very pretty quarrel', the settlement of which
required the intervention of the Romans, arose between the two towns,
owing to the facts that the citizens of each had killed and dined on the
sacred animals of the other. Juvenal gives an account of a similar strife
between Omhos and Tentyra (p.207). On the introduction of Christianity
Oxyrrhynchus became so "full of eonvents that monkish songs were heard
in every quarter". Convent jostles convent all round, forming as it were a
second town of monks. In the 5th cent. the diocese of Oxyrrhynchus is
said to have contained 10,000 monks and 12,000 nuns. In the town itself
were 12 churches. Under the Arabs it is known only as Behnesah. In the
Mameluke period it was still of some importance, but it has since steadily
declined. From Behnesah the desert-route leads to the 'small oasis' of
Barp"iyeh, also known as the Oasis of Behnesak (comp. p. 313).

About (I M. above Ahu Girgeh, close to the E. bank of the Nile,
are the imsignifieant remains of Shékh el-Fadhl, near which is
Hamathah. Father Sicard's discovery of a large number of dog-
mummies here proves that we are standing on the site of the neer0-
polis of Cynopolis (ktoNay 13311;), the 'city of the dogs', which, as the
above story indicates, must have adjoined Oxyrrhynchus. Strabo's
words are: 'Next come the Cynopolitan nome and Cynopolis, where
Anubis is worshipped and dogs are held sacred and fed with con-
secrated meat'. Several trough-like hollows and clefts have been
found here, some of which, in the rocks, are of considerable size;
but 110 inscriptions have been discovered. cynopo1is itself, accord-
ing to Ptolemy, lay on an island in the Nile, but no traces of it are
now visible. Opposite, 154 M. from the W. bank, lies the village
of et-Tis.

Eolosaneh (rail. stat., p. 1), on the W. bank, has a large palm-
grove. Opposite (E. hank)1ies Surartyeh. To the N. and S. quar-
ries are worked in the limestone rock. - Among the rocks here is
a small temple (just very easily found), bearing the names of Seti II.
and of Merenptah Hotepher-ma, supposed to be the Pharaoh of
the Exodus [19th Dye). The kings are offering saerifiees to the
triad of Sehek, Hathor, and Horus, and representations of Sebek
(with the head of a crocodile), Hathor, and Ramses III. may be
made out on the external wall of the grotto, facing the spectator.
The inscriptions are very indistinct but are couched in the usual
form of thanksgiving to the gods for the blessing of a long reign.

0n the W. bank lies Samal1itt, with a handsome railway-station
(p. ij, sugar-factories, palms, and fields pf clover. A little farther
to the s., on the E. bank, rise the steep rocky sides of the Gebel
et-Tir C'hiril-mountain0, with an extensive flat t0p bearing the
Coptic convent of el-Bulgt‘u'nL Those who wish to visit the moun-
tain should disembark just before reaching it and ascend on the N.

. 'r Now generally called Dir el-Bukrah, from a Windlass (hukrah) used
in drawing water. But the name is probably derived from the old legend
of the Buktr bird.
