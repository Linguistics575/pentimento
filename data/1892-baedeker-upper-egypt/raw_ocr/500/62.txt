10 Route f. K631 EL-AHMAR. From Cairo

Opposite Minyeh, 011 the E. bank, lies Kém el-h"a/lrrah, where
some ancient tombs, Terhaps belonging to the 10.th or 13th Dy-
nasty, have lately been discovered.

Zéwiyet el-Métin and E6m e1-A1.1marOthe red rubbish-mound'),
situated on the E. bank, 5-6 M. above Minyeh, may be visited to-
gether. We first reach the village of ZCtwiyeh, near which are the
estate and beautiful garden of the venerable Abu Sultan Pasha.
Between the village and K6111 e1-Alunar, about 1/2 M. from the
latter, lies the fine cemetery of the citizens of Minyeh (p. 9), with
its numerous domed tombs and chapels. Thrice yearly, in the
months of ltegeh, Shawwttl, and Dhilhiggeht, at the time of full
moon, funereal festivals, lasting several days, are celebrated here.
Among the ceremonies observed are the offering of dates to the
dead, which recalls the funereal offerings of the ancient Egyptians,
and the presentation of palm-hranches, recalling the Oriental sym-
bolism of early Christianity, still familiar in our churches. A few
minutes' walk towards the S. brings us to the red mound of pottery
and rubbish known as K611: el-Alynar, which runs parallel with the
Nile. Climbing over this we reach the burial-vaults of the primeval
monarchy, which are situated among the Arabian hills, with their

gates towards the river.

The tombs are unfortunately in bad preservation, and some of them
have been destroyed by violence, the stones being removed for use in build-
ing. n is uncertain of what town this was the neeropolis, but it undoubt-
edly belonged to the 16th nonle of Upper Egypt, named Mal: or' Mutual
(gazelle), in which the gazelle was held sacred. In this nome also lay the
towns of Heben and Nefrus, the chief deity of which was represented as
a sparrow-hawk standing on a gazelle, accompanied by Hathor, Horus,
and Khnum. Some of the tombs are still open to visitors. The lower
ones are small and dilapidated, including one that was richly adorned
with statues. Similar figures, hewn in the living rock, are still distinguish-
able on the fagade and in the rear of the chapel. Farther up is the tomb
of Xefersekhrw, royal secretary and superintendent of the storehouses of
Upper and Lower Egypt, which Mill contains some good sculptures. This
tomb, in the rear of which are three niches, appears to have been con-
structed under the 18th Dynasty. Among its contents are tsacrificial lists
and scenes like those in the vaults of'Ahd el-Kurmh: Osiris under a ca-
nopy; corpse crossing the Nile, accompanied by female mourners; the
deceased in the midst of his family. The tomb of Khzmes, a relative of
the Pharaohs, situated farther to the S. and lower down, is of earlier origin
and in all probability belongs to the ancient kingdom. The Scenes of
agriculture and navigation in this tomb, reproduced by Lepsius, are now
scarcely 'visible. From the upper tombs we obtain a splendidly varied
view of the Nile, its fertile valley and the town of Minyeh, with the red
mounds of debris in the foreground, while to the N. stretches the study
desert, from which the domed tombs of Tiwiyet el-Métin rise like a group
of tents. 0n the mound of Kain el-Ahmar lies a eo1ossa1 figure, 70 ft.
long, without an inscription.

Benihasan and Specs Artemidos, 15 M. from Minyeh audit}? M.

from Cairo, an important steamboat-station.

f These months cannot be reproduced by the names of our months,
as they pass through all the seasons of the solar year. Thus a festival
which is celebrated this year in summer will take place 15 years hence
in winter.
