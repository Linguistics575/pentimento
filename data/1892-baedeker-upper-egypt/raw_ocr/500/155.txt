corresponding temple room. Six of the twelve crypts are beneath
the ground-level, and of these two are in the first hypostyle hall E
(Nos. It and 12 in Pl. Ii). The entrance to crypt No. 10 is in
Room XXIII, adjoining Hall D. Of the remaining three subterranean
crypts (Nos. 1, 4, 7), the first is only accessible by a flight of steps
deswending from crypt No. 2, which lies above it and is entered by
an opening in the wall of Room VII. The discomforts of the climb
are compensated in this case by the sight of two crypts, the lower
one, the largest of all, consisting of 7 chambers, and the upper one
adorned with representations and inscriptions in unusually good
preservation. No. 4, entered from Room vor, and No. 7, from
Room XIV, are closed with doors, which the temple-keeper will open
on request. “wood stone stairs lead to both, and no visitor should
fail to visit at least these two crypts. Magnesium wire or a lamp
will be found useful in examining the painted walls. On the stair-
case leading to No. 4 occurs a mention of a festival celebrated on the
4th Epagomene day, and within the crypt is a painting of king
Pepi, kneeling and offering a golden statue of AM. All these
statues, whose dimensions are given, were probably kept in the
crypts. Still more important are the inscriptions in crypt No. 9
(mentioned on p. 81). which is entered by a very narrow hole high
up in lloon1 x. The calendar-dates of festivals instituted by T11t-.
mes III. (1700 B13.) are here found. Mention is also made of the
fact that the ancient plan of the temple under Gheops was re-dis-
covered in the reign of King Pepi [6th Dyno.

We now eseend one of the staircases mentioned on p. 91 to
the Temple Roof. Caution must be observed on account of the holes
made in the roof to admit light and air to the rooms below. At the
SW. angle of the roof stands a small open pavilion, supported by
I'.?, columns, which played an important part during the solemn
procession at the festival of the new year (p. 91). We pass through
this pavilion in passing from the G. staircase to the W. chambers.
The W. staircase, which ascends in successive flights, leads past a
room in the middle story, probably used as a workshop for restoring
and repairing the statues and utensils of the temple. Six chambers
on the roof, three 011 the W. and three on the E., the first in each
ease being unroofed, were used in the worship of the slain and risen
Osiris, as curious representations indicate. Tho second room 011
the E. side formerly contained the famous Zodiac of Denderah, now
in the Biblietheqne Nationale at Paris.

Finally a walk round the outside of the temple will be found
interesting. The Inscriptions, so frequently referred to above, which
contain the numes and dimensions of the various apartments of tho
temple, were laid bare by Prof.lrrimichen inl875, and afterheing
copied were again covered up. The projecting lions' heads on tho
sides of the building, probably intende i to carry off the rain-water,
should be noticed. At the left corner of the rear-wall is a Portrait
