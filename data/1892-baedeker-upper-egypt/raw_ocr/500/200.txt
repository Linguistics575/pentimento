well as hom the w., and even for those advancing through the
series of pylons 0n the S. --n is improbable that Cambyses caused
the destruction of this â€˜heart' of the worship of Ammon, if we may
use that expression, and Neetanebus, who was a mighty builder
would certainly have restored it, had it been injured. On the other
hand, nothing is more likely than that one of the later Persian
kings selected this temple for destruction after some abortive in-.
surrection on the part of the Egyptians, in order to punish the 1'0-.
bellious province in its most sensitive part. Ptolemy Soter, who
held the reins for Philip Aridmus, could have found no easier way
to win the hearts of his new subjects than to restore the holy places
destroyed by the Persians; while to do so was to imitate Alex-
ander the Great. In this particular case the work was not difficult,
for though new sculptures had to be provided for the adytum, its
walls were for the most part still standing. In the dedication-
inscription in the interior of the sanctuary, Philip records merely
that he had restored with granite the sanctuary which was falling
to ruin, 'which was built in the time of Tntmes IIL, king of
Upper and Lower Egypt'; and a fragment of the older structure,
bearing on its upper side a representation of Tutmes offering gifts
to Ammon Generator, was 11sed as a ceiling-slab in the restoration.

The inscriptions and carvings on the Inner Watts" of the first
chamber are neither imposing nor specially interesting. They still
exhibit traces of colour, especially of the blue pigment, which was
lavishly used to make the fig11res stand out more distinctly from
the reddish stone. Ammon in both his main characters (Ammon
Generator and Ammon king of the gods) receives the homage of
Philip, or rather of the representative of the royal house of Macedon,
for it is certain that Philip never entered the valley of the Nile, Math
of course also appears with Ammon, and once is depicted as
embracing him, an absolutely unique representation. The traveller
will see with surprise in this sacred spot a representation of the
king, under the auspices of Ehnum, catching birds with a net, and
promising to bestow his booty upon Ammon.

The Exterior Walls of the holy ofholies are covered with n11mer-
ons low reliefs and inscriptions, not easily seen on account of the
smoothness and polish of the granite. On the, right side LS.) the
Pharaoh is in one place sprinkled with the water of life by Her Hut
(Vol. L, p. 133) and Thoth, and in another receives from them the
royal crown. Elsewhere we see the boat of Ammon being brought
in solemn procession to the sanctuary, and the king offering four
calves of different colours (perhaps symbolizing the nations of the
four quarters of the globe, over which he watched as shepherd of
the people). The inscription records that Ammon-lla, the bull (hus-
band) of his mother, is highly pleased with the beautiful monument
which Philip has erected to him, and that he promises all kinds of
gifts to the king; in return. The foundation-cereniony is also men-
