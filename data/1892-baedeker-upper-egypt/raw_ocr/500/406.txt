97 GI. - Above Dakkeh the Nile expands. At (3 M.) Korti,

in hierog. LI , on the W. bank, are the ruins of a small

temple of the Roman period, dedicated to Isis and Horus. The
name of Tutmes III. appears here on some blocks built into the
walls. Straight in front of us rises an isolated mountain. The is-
land of Derdr (3 M. from Korti), which we pass on our right, is the

described by 1Ier0d0tus (II. '20). Here ended the territory of 12
schoinoi above Elephantine belonging to Isis of Philae, of which
mention is made on the stele of Philometor in the temple-court of
Phila: (comp. p. 300).

On the W. bank, opposite a dark mountain-peak, lies the Temple
of Ofedinah, also called Temple of Jfalurral.cah, after the village of
Nal1aralrah, which lies a little higher up on the E. bank, Dating
from the Roman period, its Greek and demotie inscriptions show it
to have been dedicated to Serapis and Isis. It consisted of an en-
trance-hall (now destroyed) approached by a broad flight of 14 steps,
and of a main colonnaded building, 40 ft. long and 50 ft. broad.
Part of the walls has fallen; but 3 columns to the right and 2 to the
left of the entrance still stand, besides 8 columns in the interior.
In the innermost corner, to the right, are traces of a staircase
leading to the roof. A wall connects this temple with a smaller
square structure to the E., 011 which is a curious representation:
beneath a f1g-tree (lspao"ozrs'y.tyoc, whence the Greek name of the
place, which was perhaps named Penubs in early Egyptian anti-
quity) sits a goddess with cow's horns (Isis-lotus) before whom is
a boy with a jug in his hands; above are three other gods. To the
left of this scene is Thoth with the ell; beneath is Isis.

The route now lies between monotonous hills. At Seydleh we
reach the boundary between Widi Keniis and the Wadi el-'Arotb,
which extends to 1hrim. At Mchendi, on the W. bank, are the ruins
of a Roman settlement. The mountains, especially on the E., be-
come higher. At Medtlc is a picturesque group of hills with groves
of palms. The river makes a wide bend to the W., and we soon
come in sight of the temple of Sebts'ah, 27 M. from Dakkeh.

The Temple of Sehtrah. - Es- Sebttah or SetWah (the lions) or
Mrddi SelWah is the site of a temple dedicated to Ammon and Ptah by
Ramses H., and constructed like the temple at Gerf Hus√©n, partly by
excavation in the rock, partly by building. The name is apparently
derived from the avenue of Lions or Sphinxes in front 0fthe temple.
Eight ofthese lions with human faces are supposed to have been ranged
011 each side, though only the two first have retained their heads. A
