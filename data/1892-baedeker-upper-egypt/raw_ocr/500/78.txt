20 Route I. TELL EL-AMAIINAH. From Cairo

earth and all lands sing songs of praise. The praise of the king is
interwoven with the hymn to the sun: 'Thou givest me honour
before the king all my days. A worthy burial after a long life in
this land of the light-region of; the sun's disc was accorded to me.
I fulfill the span of my life. I fulfill my life in the eo‘mpleteness
of a servant of the good god, who is free to ascend every throne he
likes. I am a vassal of the king'. Then follows a list of the titles
of Aahmes.

Tomb tl contains representations of columns, the shafts of which
are encircled at regular intervals by rings resembling the tissue
enveloping the joints of reeds. The capital consists of several erect
bell-flowers, with dependent buds held together by a ring.

The Tomb of Huiu (No. 7), the keeper of the treasury, also
contains much that is interesting. The Temple of the Sun, on the
right wall of the first chamber, has already been mentioned. The
king is shown seated upon a lion-guarded throne, illuminated by
the solar rays, and borne by several courtiers. Before and behind
are noble youths with large and small fans. The same chamber
contains another striking and well-preserved scene, representing
the studio of the sculptor Autu, director of the portrait-sculptors
(lit. 'givers of life') of the king’s mother Tii. A well-executed
statue of this powerful but unlovely princess is being coloured
by the master himself, while two younger sculptors (s-ankh) give
the finishing touches to the head and legs. The sacrificial scenes
are of the usual type. - The name ofRhu-en-aten has been almost
everywhere obliterated from the eartouehes. The solar disc with
the arms appears frequently as a kind of talisman, sometimes above
the single hieroglyphics. While demanding devoted loyalty from
his subjects, the king seems to have enjoyed the most aifeetionate
and happy relations with his wife and daughters, in whose names
we recognise an echo of his own(Ateni). The wife is named 'Beauty
of the Solar Dise, the beauteous Dame hit'; the daughters are Merit
Aten, the darling of the sun; Aten makt, the ward of the sun;
Ankh-s en pa Aten, she who lives through the sun; Aten nefra' ta
shera, beauty of the sun; the little Aten bekt, servant of the sun,
and so 011. Tii, the mother of the king, is already known to us
(see above).

The S. Tombs, 11/4-11/e, hr. from the N. group, are not so well
preserved. The graves formerly stood open, and only those parts
under cover have escaped serious injury. In 1883 Maspero dug
deeper into the already opened graves, and opened some for the
first time, such as that of Mahu (p. 27). The eartouehes of Khu-
en-aten are not scratched out in the newly uncovered tombs. Of
special interest are the recently discovered vaulted passages with
steps, leading downwards, which are unlike any other Egyptian
construction. It is evident that these were the actual burial-plaees.
Skulls of bodies which had not been embalmed have been found
