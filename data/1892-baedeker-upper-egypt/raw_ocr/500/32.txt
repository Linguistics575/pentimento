1 bottle of brandy lbottle ofeognae the reception of guests.

A hanging-lamp, bought in the Muski for 120 fr., suspended over the
saloon-table, and a pack of playing-cards were found very convenient.

The above stores, purchased for 281., not only were amply suf-.
fwie11t, but 70s. worth was returned to the dealers at the end of the
voyage. For no one should omit to make an arrangement entitling
him to return unused stores (at a reduction of about 100/0 on the
original price) and to have the agreement entered on the invoice.

Other stores, such as eggs, fresh beef, buffalo-meat, mutton,
poultry, oranges, lemons, etc., are taken only in small supplies, it
being easy to replenish the larder en route, either from the steamers
or still better from the markets on the banks, where prices are mo-
derate. The cook makes the purchases and submits his accounts.

Average prices. Fowl, 2-0 piastres according to quality; fat turkey,
45-62; 11en-turkey 22-36; pair of pigeons 31-8; sheep 128-350: 16 eggs, 5-8; rotl

Various kinds of provisions, including some delicacies, are to he ob-
tained from the bakkals or small dealers of Manyeh, Assidg, Keneh, Luxor,
Esneh, and Assudn.

Tobacco for chibouques may be obtained in the bazaars, also
at Assitot, lieneh, and Esneh; the best mixture is 1/2 Gebeli and
1â€˜5 Riirtni. The best Turkish tobacco (StamUlf) and cigarettes
may be bought in Cairo from Nestor Gimlachis and E. Zalichi tJa-
conomu in the Muski, Volterra Frbres at the post-office, and Cortessi,
Ezkebiyeh, next the Cafe" de la Bourse. Good cigars are also kept
by Cortessi; those to be obtained en route are bad. .

Medicine. Comp. Tol., I. pp. 15, 473. Some Antipyrine, 50 gr.
of quinine, some laudamim, a supply of zinc or other eye-wash,
rhubarb, etc. should not be forgotten.

Clothing and Equipment. Clothes such as are worn in autumn
at home are the best for the Nile. Boots must be stout and water-
tight. Slippers, bathing-shoes for the clayey Nile baths, both thick
and thin stkaings, flannel shirts, a broad-brimmed hat, a warm
overcoat, and a substantial rug should not be forgotten. A sun-
umbrella and kufiyeh, a silk handkerchief 01' muffler, blue or grey
spectacles, and a leathern cushion stuffed with horse-hair will also
be found useful. Saddles, which may be hired in Cairo, should be
taken, espeeially if ladies are of the party, for the donkeys hired at
the various points do not always have saddles. - Explorers should
provide themselves with a long and strong ladder; as well as a
magnesium lamp or magnesium-wire (to be obtained in Cairo). -
Photographic apparatus should be brought from home, for chemicals
are either not obtainable or very dear in Egypt, and good dry plates
are scarcely to be obtained. The plate should not be more than 8 to
10 inches at the largest. The traveller should superintend the ou-
stom-house examination in person.
