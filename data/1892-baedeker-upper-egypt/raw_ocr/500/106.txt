54 Route d. .ABYDOS. Memnonium

Mandel), they could have found no more suitable spot for a settlement
than the neighbourhood of Abydos, where the fertile W. bank of the Nile
expands and offers easy cultivation and excellent dwelling-sites, removed
from all danger of inundation. This is the most ancient town in Egypt,
and its neighbour Abydos cannot have been much younger, for even in
the time of the early empire it is frequently spoken of as a holy
city. It possessed the most famous grave of Osiris, of which it was
believed that burial in its vicinity or consecration in its sanctuary went
far in ensuring a favourable judgment in the world to come. From an
early period the grandees of the land caused their mummies to be brought
hither-often, however, for a limited time only, directing that, as soon
as the wished-for blessings had been received from Osiris, the bodies
should be carried back to their ancestral burial-grounds. Mariette has
proved that the town itself (Egypt. Abtu) was never of any great ex-
tent. The extant ruins extend from el-Kherbeh on the NN'. to 'Ariibat
el-3ladfiineh on the S.E. If, however, Ahydos was small in the number
of its citizens, it was great through the importance of the gods wor-
shipped in its temples. Each of the 42 nomes of Egypt possessed its
temple of Osiris; but none of them, except that of Sokar in Memphis,
rivalled in sanctity that of Abydos. The testimony of the monuments is
confirmed by the classical writers. Herodotus left Upper Egypt unde-
scribed, because Hecataeus had already treated of it, but we quote the
celebrated passage in which the trustworthy Strabo speaks of Abydos:
'Above it (Ptolemaiâ€˜s) lies Abydos, the site of the Memnonium, a wonderful
palace of stone, built in the manner of the Labyrinth, only somewhat
less elaborate in its complexity. Below the Nemnonium is a spring,
reached by passages with low vaults consisting of a single stone and
prominent by their extent and mode of construction. This spring is
connected with the Nile by a canal, which flows through a grove of
Egyptian thorn-acacias, sacred to Apollo. Abydes seems once to have been
a large city, second only to Thebes, bat now it is a small place, etc.'
Abydos is also mentioned by Plntarch, Athenians, Stephanus of Byzantium,
Ptolemy, Pliny, and others. Ammianus Nareellinus speaks of the oracle
of the god Besa, which flourished here.

The ordinary traveller, especially when he has at his disposal
only the 8 hrs. allowed by the steamer, will coutine himself to the
Memnonium of Seti I. (Pl. I) at 'Aribat e1-Mailft1neh and the sadly
dilapidated Temple of Ramses 11. (P1. 11). The remains of the
so-called Temple of Osiris at el-Kherbeh (Pl. III) and the adjacent
site of Mariette's excavations in the ancient necropolis among the
Libyan hills are rapidly becoming less and less interesting through

the steady encroachment of the desert sand.

The Memnoninm of Seti I.

This noble structure, which, from the time of Strabo onwards, has
been visited and described by so many travellers, did not become fully
known to the modern world till Mariette Bey, with characteristic judg-
ment and perseverance and supported by the generosity of the Khedive,
began in 1853 the task of freeing it from the sand. His plan of isolating
the building by digging a trench round and preventing new accumu-
lations of sand was not carried wholly into effect, hut still,with the ex-
ception of portion of the ontside of the N. wall of the second court,
there is now no part of the temple where inscriptions are likely to
be found that does not stand open to the explorer. The diftieulty of the
excavations was much increased by the fact that the back part of the
temple was buried in the slope of the hill, in such a way that it looked
like a gigantic sepnlchral chapel forming the vestibule to a mighty rock-
tomb in the bowels of the mountain. Mariette believes, and probably
with justice, that this peculiarity of the Memnnninm explains the name
