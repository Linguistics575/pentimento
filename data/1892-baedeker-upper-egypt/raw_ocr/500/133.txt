Both the 'Three Weeks' and the 'Four Weeks' Tourist Steamers stop
at Dendurah in ascending; the river, the ilrst halting 3 hrs., the second a
whole day. The mail-steamer also halts here for a few hours in descend-
ing the river. _

For a visit to the temple the Meambuats and dhahahiyehs moor at the
hank opposite Fepeh. The distance to the temple (about 2 M.) is easily
accomplished in 1/2 hr. by the well-equipped donkeys standing in readiness.
Those who wish to make a prolonged stay may procure the necessary
conveniences for a night in the temple from the keeper rAli 2U'endi, who
lives in Keneh. The Arahs, however, are afraid of the "afrtt' 0r ghosts.
The visitor should not fail to be provided with candles Or (better still) a
magnesium lamp for exploring the crypts and ether parts of the temple.

The capital of the 6th nome of Upper Egypt (ia-ti, 'the district

We follow the hank of the Nile towards the N., through palm-
trees, and then proceed to the W. through well-tiF fields, pass-
ing (right) a farnr-enelosure, guarded by yelping dogs; or we may
ride at once towards the W. in the direction of the Gate ofAngustus
tp. ti8) and proceed thence to the, N., passing a door 1sith unfilled
eartmmhes, to the N. entrance, where the cards of admission (see
lntrml., p. siv) are shown. The wall enclosing the temple is formed
of Nile brieks, and there is another entrance on the W. side. The
total enclosure is 317 yds. long and 306 yds. wide, and besides the
large temple of IJalhor contains a small sanctuary dedicated to Isis
and a so-ea) 'birth-house' ()see below). The N. door, which is in
a straight line with the temple, is only lip to the E. of N.; but in
the temple-inseriptions it is always spoken of as the E. entrance,
while the long sides of the temple are called the N. and S. sides.
In the following description We follow the true geographical post-
tion. The N. gate was hnilt under the Emp. Domitian, who is here
named Crermaniens. 0n the side next the temple appears the name
of Nerve Trajanus, also with the epithets of Germaniens and
Daeieus.

From the N. gate a modern brick passage leads to the temple.
To the left of this passage lies a building deep-sunken in the de-
hris and wanting its front. Hound it ran a eolonnade, the capitals
of which, “ith the dwarf-Iike 1,rure of the god Besa, project from
the sand. The remains inelude a rather large vestibule (33 ft. by
