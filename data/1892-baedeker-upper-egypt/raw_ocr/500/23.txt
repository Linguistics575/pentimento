steamer if there is a berth free. After that, however, the ticket be-.
comes invalid, without any recourse against Messrs. Cook.

In 1889-90Messrs. Cook also organized a MAIL STEAMER SERVICE
between Assitot, the railway terminus, and Assuén (d days up,
3 days down), starting from Assitt. on Wed. and Sat. mornings in
connection with the day-trains leaving Btltt ed-Dakrtr on Tues.
and Frid. mornings; and returning from Assmin on Mon. and Thurs.
afternoons in connection with the train leaving Assiht for Btdttl.r
ed-Dalcrtor on Frid. and Mon. evenings. The names of the mail-
steamers are Cleopatra, Nefertari, Amenartas, and Hatasoo. In
1891 a mail-steamer also sailed every Sat. direct from Cairo vii
Assitot to Ass1rin, in some respeets to be preferred to the others.
This steamer touches at Benihasan (visit to the tombs), reaches
Assitrt. on Tues. evening, and proceeds thence On Wed. morning (as
above). The fare from Cairo is 23t. to Asswtn and back (14 days,
or 18 days if the direct steamer from Cairo be taken) and 20t. to
Luxor and back (11 days), including lst cl. fare from Cairo to
Assitt, transfer of baggage at Assitot, provisions on board the
steamers, and 3-4 days' hotel accommodation at Luxor. Incidental
expenses for sight-seeing, donkeys, guides, etc. are not included in
these fares. About 11/2 day is spent at Assuin, and on the return-
voyage 3 hrs. are spent at Edfu and 2314 hrs. at J.t"eneh-Denderah.
Ktnn Ombo, Esneh, audLuxor are night-stations, and travellers who
desire to visit the temples at these places must do so by torch-light.
Passengers may also spend additional time at any of the stations en
route continuing their journey by later steamers, and paying the
fare from stage to stage (to Luxor 2.94Z.E., to Assuén 5LE.) together
with los. per day for food on hoard the steamers. These mail-
steamers enable travellers to visit the chief points in Upper Egypt
at a less expenditure of time and money than the tourist steamers.
No one should omit the voyage to Assuén, while Salrlpirah may be
visited from Cairo. The life on board these vessels is often lively;
and the scenes at the numerous landing-places are frequently
highly entertaining. The mail-steamers touch at the following
stations: Abuttg, Nekheleh, Sedfeh, Temeh, Meshteh, Tahtah, Mara-
ghah, Shendaunn, Sohiig, Akhmim, Mensh'tyeh, Girgeh, Beliéneh,
Abu 8htlsheh, Shiikh Amrdn, Farshm, Kay e.s-faiytrd, Deshneh,
Keneh, K113, Nalcddch, Ramtdeh, Luxor, Erment, Esneh, Bagaliyeh,
