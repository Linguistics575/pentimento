27. The Island of Elephantine.

This island is reached by small boat in a few minutes from the landing-
place. Cook's tourists are first transported in comfortable boats to Ele-
phantine and then to the bazaar at Assuhn (small gratuity). A row round
the island is recommended (1/2 hr.). The entire visit takes barely an hour.

Elephantine was a place of great sanctity from a very early pe-
riod among the ancient Egyptians. It formed ia Home by itself

with a capital, named like the entire island , j (i,' Ab and also

LCM C Ab was the Egyptian for elephant, so that Elephantine

is merely the Greek translation of a native name. The Arabs call
it simply Geiireh, Le. island, or Geftret Assftan; and it is also said
to be named tyr,-2dhir or 'the blooming'. Though the vegetation is
luxuriant in many spots, the writer never heard the last-given name
applied to it.

The Egyptian priests described the Source of' the Nile as a mystery,
that would only be revealed to the soul at the twelfth gate of the under-

world; yet at the same time, they pointed out the 'symholical sources of
the Nile', so to speak, in the eddies among the rocks of the cataracts

i.e. the Kerti or sources of Elephantine. Herodotus heard of these from
a scribe in the treasury of the temple of Athena at Sais. The Haliear-
nassian thought that the priest was but jesting when he told him that
between Syene and Elephantine lay two lofty peaked mountains, Krnphi
and Mophi, from the midst of which gushed the bottomless sources of the
Nile, one half of which flowed to the N. to Egypt, the other half to the S.
to Ethiopia. - However foolish this opinion, which Seneca also reports,
may appear, it was not pure invention, for the monuments inform us that
the people were really taught to believe that the Egyptian Nile had his
abode among the rapids to the S. of Elephantine. Some located it to the
S. of the island of Bigeh-Senem (p. 297). Khnum, the god of cataracts,
was revered before all other gods On this island; and next to him ranked
Sati (a form of Isis-Suthis), because the beginning ofthe inundation coin-
cided with the early rising of this constellation, and the cataract may be
regarded as the threshold of the swollen Nile entering Egypt.

In the year 1822 Mohammed 'Ali, in order to build a palace for
himself at Assu2n, caused the destruction of the Temple of Kltnum,
built under Amenhotep III. of the 18. Dyn. near the S. end of the
island, and also of a smallor Temple of Tutmes 111., lying more to
the N.W., and known as the N. temple. Travellers pass the latter
on their way to the city. in whose N, outskirts it lay. The savants
of tho French Expedition saw this temple before its destruction and
published views of it. Now all that is to be seen on the island are
some huge heaps of ruins, a granite doorway of the time of Alexan-
tier l., and a granite Statue of Merenpmh f. lilm-ks of stone and
sculptured fragments lie around.

The inhabitants of the two villages on the island, many of whom
understand nothing but Nubian, off'er coins, small antirguities (many imi-

tations), and fragments of pottery with inscriptions ostraca) for sale.
The last-named are sometimes valuable; the inscriptions are written with
