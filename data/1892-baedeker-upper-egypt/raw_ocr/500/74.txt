22 Route 1. TELL EL-AMARNAH. From Cairo

of hewn stone went forth out of the mountain, more. unutterably grand
to witness than all things else. Transport-ships equipped with all magni-
iieence, the choicest of my young men and soldiers. My children followed
me arrayed in festal ornaments, and the inhabitants of my nnme, sing-
ing songs of praise, celebrated my arrival in the fortress of this town'.

The other representations in this temh offer nothing unusual. Much
has been destroyed and defaced, principally by the monks, who tried to
sanctity the pagan work and drive the devil from it by marking it with
the sign of the cross.

Below this tomb is another of the 12th Dynasty, belonging according
to the inscriptions to the royal chamberlain Aha.

On the W. bank, 1 M. from the Nile, is MelaWi el-â€˜Arish (rail.
stat., p. 1), a small town with10,000inhals., where fowls, eggs,
etc., may be procured cheaply (large market on Suu.). In the vi-
cinity are many large palms and also sugar-plantatious. Farther
on, on the E. bank, at the foot of the hill of the same name (p. '27),
lies Shiikh-Sa'td, with tombs of the old empire, including those of
priests of Khufu, Userkaf, and Pepi.

We next reach the ruins of ot-Tell and the grottoes of Tell el-
Amarnah, two very interesting points on the E. bank, at which the
'four weeks' steamer stops for a few hours on its return-journey.
The best plan is to disembark at et-Toll, visit the remains of the
old tosvn,return to the dhahabiyeh, and sail to Hayy et-Kandil, where
donkeys for the visit to the grottoes are more easily obtained than
at et-Tell. We pass to the right of the village of ei-Tell, 1/4 M.
from the river, and at the point where the cultivated land ends we
turn due S. (to the right). After passing the ruins of alarge build-
ing (probably atemplel, 110w consisting of the foundations only and
nearly indistinguishable, we turn to the right from the path to vi-
sit the numerous relies of public and private buildings of all kinds.
There are larger and finer mined temples in other parts of Egypt,
but nowhere else do we obtain so excellent anidea of the actual
dwelling- laces. of the citizens. It looks as if the hand of deit had

- p Y
bodily removed this large town (more than 1 M. long from N. to S.)
from the surface of the earth, leaving nothing but the foundations
to tell the after-world that many thousands of human beings once
lived and worked, suffered and rejoiced 011 this waste spot. The
lines of the streets may be followed and ground-plans traced; but
the demands of cultivation are steadily effacing the remains.

Tell el-Amarnah. Whether we proceed by land from et-Tell
01' disembark at Hagg el-oiandil, we have to ride towards the hills
to the E., in which, even from a distance, we discover the gates of
the celebrated tombs ofTell el-Amarnah. In either case it is advisable
to have a guide. 011 the way we should not omit to visit the recently
discovered grave of the sun-worshipper Jfhu-en-aten (Amenho-
tep 1V., see below). Of the two groups of tombs that to the N. is
the more interesting and the more easily accessible.

An interesting and not yet fully explained epoch of Egyptian history
is illustrated here by a large number of paintings [and inscriptions. In
the Historiea] Introduction to our iirst vol. an account is given of both
Amenhotep lil, and his sun and successor Ameuhotep IV. The lirst, a
