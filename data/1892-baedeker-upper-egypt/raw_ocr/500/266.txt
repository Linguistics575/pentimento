194 Route 18. THEBES. West Bank:

of the anteehamber has fallen in, and the sun lights up its walls,
which are covered with a variety of interesting representations.

On the fragment of wall to the left prince Anna is seen with his
wife Tuau sitting under a light pavilion, supported by a pillar, which
shows that the Calyx-capital belonged originally to wooden buildings,
and was only adopted later in stone architecture. The pavilion has a
natural connexiOn with the picture of Anna's garden, as he was a zealous
planter of trees. A number of the plants cultivated by him are named,
and to this we owe our knowledge of the names and characters of several
of the plants of ancient Egypt. On the long outer wall, on the left, we
see the noble Anna again, this time standing upright, in full enjoyment
of his rank, while receiving the different kinds of tributes for the store-
houses of Ammon. There are seribes to take down the amount of each
contribution, and even the number of strokes which are inflieted upon a
debtor. From Ethiopia there is a variety of contributions to he received,
including negress slaves carrying their children in baskets on their backs,
ivory, ebony, apes, panther-skins, etc. The Asiatics bring lapis-lazuli, etc.

On the same outer wall but to the right of the spectator Anna is
seen again, but this time in company with his united family. His hound
is standing below his seat, while ostriches, wild asses, a kind of wild
goat, and other goats and cattle of various kinds and colours are being
brought to him. One man brings rows of pomegranates etc. on strings.
The interior of the tomb is small, but is not without interest, especially
from the abundant list of offerings on the right wall from which alone we
learn the names of tive kinds of wine and two kinds of beer. On the
left wall is the country-house and garden of the deceased; two women
are standing at' the door, probably his wife and his mother. In the back-
ground Anna is sitting with his wife before a richly furnished table of
offerings. Opposite to him is seen his c,oftin being drawn along, and the
weeping women throwing dust on their heads, just as may be seen in
Egypt at the present day. The innermost room of No. 26 together with
the shaft has been filled up with stones, and all that can be recognized
of its paintings is the back of an enormous Apep serpent, the enemy of
the Sun-ship of Ra.

We notice the two long galleries to the left with numerous en-
trances but without any remarkable tombs, and ascend again to the
right to No. 16, a tomb well worth seeing, belonging to Horemheb,
who 'seems to have held a series of offiees, especially that of overseer
of the cattle, in the successive reigns of Tutmes II. and m., Amen-
hotep II. and III., and Tutmes IV., of the 18th Dynasty. Close to
it is the tornb (No. 17) of Tenuna, a fan-bearer on the king's right
hand, and adjoining this, but turned towards the N., the tomb of
Amenophis (No. 102), second Prophet to Ammon, and of his wife
Roi. The paintings in this contain a scale in which gold rings are
being weighed, various workmen, one of whom is making a Sphinx,
clerks with tables writing out the crops, and a statue with a rarn's
head; on the right music and dancing.

A little higher to the right is the tomb of Zanuni (No. 101). Cave
should he taken at the entrance, to avoid falling into the deep shaft.
The paintings represent Reteunu bringing presents in gold, silver, lapis-
lazuli, and emeralds.

We have now almost reached the summit of the hill, and can
enjoy the magnificent *View including the Ramesseum, the Memnon
statues, and on the other side of the Nile Luxor and Karnak; to the
right below the hills is seen the temple of Der el-bal1ri, and the

path leading to the Tombs of the Kings. We now descend past
