latter founded this N. part of the temple and left merely the de-
poration of it to his son. - The facade of the temple is of very
unusual form. A row of 12 limestone columns stand a short di-
stance in advanee of the temple wall, forming with it a kind of
pronaos. In the time of Seti seven doors, corresponding to the seven
chambers of the sanctuary (see below), pierced the rear-wall, which
was adorned with a cornice ofits own. On ceremonial om-asions
the processions in honour of the king seem to have entered by the
door to the extreme left; the next servud for processions to Ptah,
the third for Harmarhis, the fourth for Ammon, the fifth for Osiris,
the sixth for Isis, and the seventh for llorns. tamses, however,
walled tip six of these doors, leaving the central one alone. the
decoration of which had been begun by Seti, as the main entrance
to the temple. l small door in the llorns gateway, to the extreme
right, is still Open. The pillars hear huge figured representations
and a few inscriptions, whieh refer to Seti I. as deceased and intro-
clnPe Ramses ll. in the company of Ammon-Ra, Osiris, Horns. and
other gods. The ltitsrostlyphics; inform us that Ramses erected this
part of the temple in honour of his father, one phrase, for instance,
reading: 'The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, the Lord of the
llarbarians [Nine Nations), to make great the name of his father',
The entram-e-wall behind the pillars confirms this pious filial wish
beyond the shadow of a Joubt. In the wall, to the left of the main
entranrâ€˜e, is a large and conspir'uons inscription in 0irvertieal lines;
which. after the lists of kiupts, must be called the most important

how, on coming: to Ahydos, he found his father's work unfinished
and resolved to carry it to a conclusion. The grandees rejoiced at
this resolution, and workmen and artists of every kind were sum-
moued to aid in the task. In the semnd part Pharaoh recalls to his

god, the victorious Opponent of the might of Death, who will soon

one of the pillars, indeed, yieti is already desevibed as the 'royal
Osiris'. The inscription dates from the first year of the single
rule of Ramses and from the time of his first journey to Thebes,
when he created statues of his father in the eity of Ammon
