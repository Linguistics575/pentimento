the crescent moon and enclose the disc adorned with the double
feather of the goddess 0ft1-nth. Above the bull and the following
procession are two hieroglyphic inscriptions, between which are the
portraits of the first favourite and queen (whose name, however, is
not given in the eartouehe in front of her), and of the kherheb,
with an open volume, who is called the president of the singers
and the chief ofthe festival orators, etc. The hieroglyphies above
the bull contain a hymn, in which the kherheb extels the god
Kliem. And in the inscription turned towards the singer, the
praise of the god and of the bull symbolizing, him is also sung in
words placed in the mouth of the god Thoth. - A long train of
standard-bearers precedes the bull. Between these and the bull a
priest facing the latter, with the ceuser (tho llomrs-hanrr), and the
festival-orator in the act of reciting. The series on the N. wall ends
at the tenth standard-hearer, but it is continued without interrup-
tion on the E. Wull. Besides the usual emblems, sacrificial vessels,
and ancestral statues, images of sacred animals on standards are
borne along. The bearers of the hawk, vulture, dog-headed ape,
and bull are clad in curious sleeveless garments,covering them from
neck to foot. The procession advances towards the Pharaoh, who
awaits it, wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt,
and holding in his hands a staff, arrow, and sceptre. On a table in
front of him stands a staff with the double feather, and the sacred
wreaths; and before his eyes takes place the ceremony of letting
four geese tly, usual at the coronation of the kings of Egypt. The
geese, which here, as in the Ramesseum, have the names of Amset,
Hapi, ete., the children ofIIerus, attached to them, are to announce
in all quarters of the globe the accession of the new Pharaoh. The
hherheh here appears, declaring that the geese must hasten to the
N., S'., E., and w., and announce to the gods of those regions that
Horus, the son of Isis and Osiris, that the king ete. Ramses IH.,
has assumed the great crowns of Upper aud Lower Egypt. Behind
the orator four, and below him three priests varry the images of
the predecessors ofllamses 111., each with its name. Above the first
of the men bearing standards with the Jackal stands a tigure clap-
ping its hands, which is named the Nehes en Punt, Le. the Negro of
Arabia, and which is regarded as the pe1smifleation of the moon-
less nig,ht preceding; the new moon. This curious tigntre greets the
god Khem, ford of Senu, etc., at whose approach every heart ex-
pands with joy. Farther to the right we see the Pharaoh, who (as
in the Ilamesseum, p. 104) cuts with a sickle the sheaf held out to
him by a priest. Behind stands the kherheb and his hymn, relating
to Khem. Almost above the sheaf is the queen, then before the
Pharaoh the white bull again, and beneath it a row of images of
ancestors. Finally the king offers incense to the god Khem, who
stands beneath a canopy, and presents to the ithyphallie Khem the
image of justice, the goddess Mai.
