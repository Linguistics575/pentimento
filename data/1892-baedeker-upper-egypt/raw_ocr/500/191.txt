have also recorded their names, sometimes tilling in vacant spaces
and sometimes su'ratehing out older names. On the eapitals the
cartouehes of Ramses ll. or of his more immediate successors are
found; on the border of the extreme top of the shaft, this same
Pharoah is usually named king of Upper and Lower Egypt, lord of
both worlds, son of the sun, lord of the diadems, etc. The broader
field beneath exhibits almost universally vertical cartouches, sur-

mounted with the feathers , and standing upon the symbol

of gold (W. On the largest field, still lower, the king appears
twice; once sacrificing to the god, and once with the celestials
offering him emblems, generally symbolizing in some familiar way
one of the higher blessings, of life. The simple inscriptions repeat
each other over and over again. They begin: 'I give thee', or, 'I
grant. thee', or else mention a visit of the king to the temple. The
carvings and hieroglyphies placed by Ramses II. are much inferior
to those, dating: from the reign of hisip'ather Seti I., a fact we have
already noticed at Abydos.

By far the most important place among the gods here is filled
by Ammon, Muth, and Khtulsu, the Thehall triad (V01. I., p. 138).
At Karnak Ammon was conceived of in two capacities, which must
he distinguished from each other; he was in the first place Ammon
Generator, in the second place Ammon-lla, the king of the gods.
Ammon may be identified by his feather-crown, Khunsu by the
crescent on his head and the 10th on his temples, and Mnth by the
vulture-cap. The other gods that appear with them may be easily
identified with the help of the introduction on the Religion of
Ancient Egypt (Vol. L, p. 124). Un the arrhitrave are some clearly
cui inscriptions, of which a few deviate from the usual formulae.
One of these, dating from Seti l., on the architrave above the bud-
rolumns in the first cress-Inw tn the 1']. (right), is as follows: â€œHe
is a king, mounting his horse like the son oflsis (Horus). He is
all archer of a mighty arm and like the (god of war) Mentn a great
wall of brass. He is the protector of his soldiers, when they thirst
in the hollow way, 011 the day of battle. No opposition is offered
to him from the hundred thousand brave hearts that are united in
one place'. In the inscriptions the king usually boasts ofhaving,
erected an eternal and magnificent building in the house of his
father Ammon, of founding festivals, or of offering, great treasures.

We turn to the left (NO from the entrance to the Hypostyle Hall,
and in the b. wall, between the 4th and 5th rows of columns from
the pylon, reach a door (l'l. d), through which we pass. The out-
side of the temple-wall is revered with inscriptions and martial
representations. These begin en the N. part of the E. wall of the
