they were probably preserved in this room or its recesses. The
room is also named the Chief Apartment and the Dwelling of Hathor.
- Room II is called the Vase Room. The wall-seulptures shew
the king offering vases to the goddess. - Room 111 is the Sistrum
Room, with corresponding representations. - Room Iv (imme-
diately to the left of the entrance to the corridor i) is the Room
of the Restoration of the Body. - Room y is named the Birth-

Room VI was the Sokar Room, in which 0siris-Sokar renewed his
limbs. The adjoining Room VII also belonged to the worship of
Osiris. It is named Sam taut, 'union of the two lands', because,

141E we reckon separately the parts of those that are divided),
constructed in the thickness of the temple-walls, and lying both
above and below the level of the temple-tloor, someisolated, others
in two or three stories. The walls of these are no less richly adorned
with sculpture than the rooms we have already insPected. They were
doubtless used for storing the precious articles and images required

Ptolemy XIII. Auletes (81-52 11.0.), and are therefore older than
