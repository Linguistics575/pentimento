idea was indicated merely by lightly carved root-leaves on the lower

part of the shafts. Beyond this colonnade is a ''Wyposty1e Bail

(Pl. C), which can hardly, however, be isleutified with the odeunr-

shaped hall mentioned by Diorlorns in his description of the tomb

of Usymandyas (p. 159). The inscriptions call it the â€œHall of the

Appearance' Lcomp. p. 65). Diodorus describes his hall as square,

whereas the one before us is 98 ft. Jeep and 196 ft. broad. The

three Entrances mentioned by Diodorus still exist, and are framed

with sculptured blocks of granite. The artistic forms displayed in

this hall are so extraordinarily t-ongrneus with eaeh other, the di-.

mensions so skilfully calculated, and the proportions so harmonious,

that we do not hesitate to describe it as the most beautiful hall ex-

tant in any Egyptian temple. In its arrangement it resembled the

great colonnaded hall at Karnak. In the centre a passage was

marked out by six couples of higher columns with calyx-eapitals,

on each side of which were three rows of lower papyrus-bud co-

lumns. Upon the latter a wall rose as high as the calys-colurnns,

with which it shared the weight of the roof, while a subdued but

suftieient light was admitted to the beautiful hall through openings

in this wall. On the outside of the still standing S.E. wall of this

i hypostyle hall appears the kneeling king doing Homage to Ammon,

1luth, and lihunsu, farther to the left Thoth writing the car-

touche of the king, and to the extreme left the king between Mentu

and Tum. Beneath is a procession of the sons of Ramses IL, only

some of whom, with their names, have been preserved. They are

i found in better preservation to the right and left of the door in the

AV. wall of the hall. Diodorus mentions that the odeum contained

numerous wooden statues, representing persons before a tribunal

and gazing upon the judges. Reliefs ofjudg,es, 30 in number, are

said to have been seen on one of the walls (hut this has possibly

arisen from a confusion with the sons of Ramses). In the midst

of the judges appeared a presiding judge, from whose neck hung

the image of truth with closed eyes, and by whose side lay numerous

books. These statues were said to intimate by their attitudes (Furl

:05 cx-flgmtog) that the judges might accept no gifts and that the

president could look only to the truth. - That statues actually

did stand in this hall is indicated by pedestals found between the

tirst and second columns in the central row. It is also by no means

impossible that a trial-scene (like the Judgment of the Dead at Dh.

el-Meruteh, p.189)mayhave occupied the wall of one of the adjoin-

ing chambers; and it is easily conceivable that the hypostyle of the

llamesseum, with which a library and a famous school of scribes

were connected, may have been used as a court by the supreme
college ofjustice.

The representations which have remained are concerned with

other suhjerts, while the tine inscription on the S.h'. Wall returns

to the war with the klwta. The relief accompanying the latter is
