tains. On the West Bank lay the Necropolis or City of the Dead,
connected with which were a large number of'temples. These latter
are halted Memnoniu, because they were dedicated to the memory
of the lives and deeds of the great Pharaohs, and because they were
regarded as the abodes of the dead monarchs, and sacrifices were
offered within them to the royal manes and to the gods, to whom
the kings owed their might. Built on the verge of the necropolis,
they stood in close relation to the worship of the dead. Just as
scientiiie institutions etc. were maintained in connection with the
Serapea adjoining the cemeteries of Memphis and Alexandria, so
the temples here were adjoined by various other establishments.
These included libraries, schools, dwellings for the priests, medical
colleges, embalming-houses, stables and pastures for the sacred
animals, and lodgings for pil,zrims.whileuear the sacred ponds and
groves were entire streets, containing not, only barracks for the
temple-guards and dwellings for the ecclesiastical and lay ofiieials,
but also shops and houses of private citizens who carried on trade
in the various articles used at burials er brought as offerings to the
deceased. The guild of Kolchytes or embalruers is frequently men-
tioned (â€˜CSPL't'iaHY at a late date) as a numerous and by no means
harmonious society. Public works of various kinds are mentioned
in the demotiv and Greek commercial contrar'ts which have been
found here and are dated from this place. Among these a canal, a
sacred lake, a large street, etc. are named. There were many other
temples besides those whose ruins arc now traceable, and round
each were grouped houses of variouskinds, so that Strabo and other
Greek writers were justified in describing Thebes as sporadically
inhabited. The last-named reliable geographer writes: 'Thehes is
now sporadically inhabited. Part of it lies in Arabia (E. bank of
the Nile), including the city proper, and part on the opposite bank,
where the Meninonium is situated'. Strabo, like all his country-
men. was especially attracted by the so-called Colossi ofiilemnon,
which he vonsidered as repaying in themselves the trouble of the
journey to Thebes.

12. The Colossi of Memnon.

The *Colossi of Memnon, which are visible from a great 1li-
stanee, are reached on donkey-baek in 20-25 min. after crowing
the W. arm of the Nile. The route, which leads through well-
cultivated lands, cannot be mistaken, for the goal is in view all the
way. These two eoloscal statues have suffered severely from the
haml of time aml have lost their artistic value, but they still
exert all their old attraction in virtue of the innumerable associa-
tions that cling to them. They are surpassed in size and in beauty
of material only by the shattered colossus in the Itamesseuiu. The
two immense figures and the 1utbieal thrones on which they are, I
