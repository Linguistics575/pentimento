(scarcely fit for drinking), and abounds in fish, some of which
are very palatable. The right of lisl1ing is let by government, and
the whole of the fishermen dwelling on the banks of the lake are
in the service of the lessee, who receives one-half of the catch.
The boats (merkeb) are very simply constructed, being without
deck or mast; the traveller must take up his quarters 011 the floor-
ing in the stern; none of the boats have sails, for, as the fish al-.
ways go in the same direction as the wind, the fishermen have to
row against the wind in order to catch them. Numerous pelicans,
wild duck, and other water-fowl, frequent the 1ake. The banks
are extremely sterile; on the N. side are barren hills of considerable
height. In the middle of the lake rises a mass of roelr, resembling
a table, and serving as a landmark. Near the S. bank, from E. to
W., lie the villages of Kafr Tamiyeh, Tirseh, Senhiâ€™tr, Abuksah, Be-
shuai, and Alht Gonsheh; the ruins of Dimeh are situated on the N.
bank, but there are no other villages of importance. A the S.W.
end of the lake is the promontory of Khashm Khalil, overgrown
with tamarisks and reeds, the creeks of which afford good landing-
places. Ascending thence across the desert, we reach the temple in
about 11/4 hours. The fishermen object to pass the night on the
bank in the neighbourhood of Kasr liurtin, being afraid of the Ile-
duius and the 'Afrtt' (evil spirits).

Kasr Ip1riin is a tolerahly well preserved temple, probably of
the Roman, or, at the earliest, of the Ptolemaie period. Before
reaching it we observe numerous traces of an ancient town,
which has now disappeared. The ground is strewn with blocks
of hewn stone, burnt bricks, broken pottery, and fragments of
glass. A circular foundation wall indicates the site of an ancient
cistern, while other walls seem to have belonged to vineyards. The
walls of the temple consist of carefully hewn blocks of hard lime-
stone. This temple, like almost all the shrines in the cases, was
dedicated to the ram-headed Ammon-Khnnm, as is proved by the
only two figures of this deity which still exist. They stand opposite
to each other at the highest part of the posterior wall of the upper
story of the open roof.

The temple is 20 yds. in width across the fagade, and 29 yds. in length.
The entrance, facing the E., is approached by a, lofty and carefully con-
Strueted platform, lk yds. in length, forming a. fore-court, on the 6. side
of which rises a massive structure resembling a. tower. Adjoining the
facade of the temple, to the IV. of the entrance door, rises a messive,
semicircular projection, resembling the half of a huge column. On the
lower floor are the apartments of the temple which were dedicated to
worship, divided into a triple prosekos, and leading to the Sekos or same-
tuary. In the first three rooms the ground slopes down towards the sane-
tuary, Which, built in the form of a cells, adjoins the third room of the
prosekos, and (as in the ease of other temples) was divided into three
small rooms at the back. The sanctuary is flanked by two narrow pas-
sages, each of which is adjoined by three rooms. The rooms of the pro-
Sekos also have adjacent chambers from which we may enter the cellars,

or ascend by two tlights of steps to the upper floor with its di0'erent apart-
ments, and thence to the roof, whence we ohtain an extensive view ol' the
