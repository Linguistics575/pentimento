292 Route 29. PHILPE. Temple

the first pylon. An inner staircase ascends to the W. pylon, whence
we proceed across the ruined roof to the E. pylon. To reach the
top of the W. pylon, we ascend the staircase to the Osiris-rooms
o. 295), and then proceed leaving these on the right. The ascent
of the first pylon (p. 288) is, however, preferable in every respect.
On the front of the E. wing facing the peristyle court is a semi-
circular Stale of reddish brown granite, erected to commemorate a
lavish grant of lands, by which Ptolemy VII. Philometor (94 B.G.)
enriched the temple. It was inscribed on the polished rear-wall of
a monolithic chapel built into the pylon. The king, however, seems
merely to have granted to -the priests a new lease of the ancient
property of the goddess. On the pylon are some Colossal Figures.
To the right is King Neos Dionysus holding his enemies by the hair,
before Horsiisi and Hathor; beneath, smaller representations. To
the left the king appears before Osiris and Isis. The grooves for
the flag-staffs should also be noted. The Portal (Pl. p) to the temple
proper, approached by a shallow flight of steps, was built by Euer-
getes II. in imitation of the portal of Nectanebus in the first pylon.
Within it the predecessors of the builder are recounted.

The Temple of Isis proper, entered by this portal, was built
according to an independent plan, embracing a hypostyle, a pro-
naos with various divisions, and a sanctuary, with two sWy-roorns.

Ptolemy II. Philadelphus was the founder of this temple, to whose
decoration the hostile brothers Philometor and Euergetes II. (Physkon)
contributed most largely. It was only natural that hath the weak hut
amiable Philometor and the vicious hut energetic Physkon should interest
themselves in the sanctuary of Isis, for both were much interested in
retaining Nubia. 1Ve are aware that the former maintained a military
station to the S. of PhiltP, which afterwards grew into the town of
Parembole (p.305). Later Ptolemies are also named here. We refrain
from_a closer examination of the, reliefs and inscriptions in this temple,
though they are not uninteresting from a mythological point of view, eon-
tenting ourselves with a reference to the detailed descriptions of the
Ptolemaic temples at Denderah (p. 80) and Edfu (p. 241).

h. The Hypostyle (Pl. N) contains ten columns arranged in
three rows. The second and third rows contain each two columns
to the right and two to the left; while the first row has only the two
eorner-columns, the space between them being left uncovered for
the sake of light. The hall thus consists properly speaking of two
portions: an uncovered fore-eo11rt with two doors, on the right and
left, leading to the outside of the temple, and a covered part behind.
The columns are 241â€™2 ft.-high and 133/4 ft. in circumference. The
uncovered portion could be shaded from the sun by means of a
velarium; the holes for the cords are still visible in the upper part
bf the concave cornice turned towards the second pylon. The eolour-
ing of this hall, which has been preserved on the ceiling and the
columns, must have been very brilliant. The Capitals are the most
instructive of all the specimens that have come down to us of the
manner in which the Egyptians coloured their columns.
