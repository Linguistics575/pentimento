Horus, and one each of Ahi, Osiris, and Isis.
The Second Side-Room (P1. xvi) on the left side of Hall c, is

named in the inscriptions QgiU E â€˜the ante-
a

chamber belonging to the Hall firii, the A1tar;while in the exterior
marginal inscriptions it is called tk Sch tua, interpreted by

Diimiehen as Room of Puri/leation. It was probably used in the
preparations for the festival ceremonies that took place in the ad-
joining Hall of the Altar; and among its inscriptions in honour
of llathor is one that seems to indicate that the temple at Denderah
is to be regarded as a replica of' a celebrated temple of the sun-god
ot' Heliopolis, of which however no trace 110w remains. Here a
reference is made to the gilding and painting of the sculptured or-
namentation, which are so often mentioned in the inscriptions.
A careful examination of the walls in some of the rooms will still
detect traces here and there of this painting,

The whole of the sculptures and inscriptions in this room refer to
llathor in her capacity as goddess of light, who has her seat in the
sun's disc rising from the horizon, and who was as such represented
under the figure of an hawk with a woman's head in the middle of
the disc rising on the sun-mountain. (With this we may compare
the representation of the goddess above the central portal in the
rear-wall, Le. above the entrance to the Adytum A.)

The adjoining room to the left (Pl. xii) is named in the in-

 

J
scriptions 1251 i.e. the Cloth Room or Wardrobe. It was the

 

 

 

repository for the sacred wreaths and garments, with which the
images of Hathor and her fellow-gods were adorned at the festivals
celebrated in the temple and sometimes at the great new year's
festival. According to the sculptures and inscriptions the prepared
perfumes were also placed. here. One half of the room was devoted
to the garments, the other to the sacred perfumes. Over the latter
presided the divine Mazet, previously mentioned among the man-
agers of the manufacture of' the incense and anointing oil as one of
the lords of the laboratory (p. 88); over the former IIathotep, god
of woven fabrics, with his companion the goddess Tai, held sway.
The sculptured ornamentation on tho walls is also arranged in har-
mony with this division of the room.
