This tomb was named by the French Expedition La Tombs de la
Métempsychose, and by British scholars, following the groundless
traditions of the Romans, the Tomb ofMemnon. This large tomb
is characterized by an abundance of mystic representations and in-
seriptions, of which, however, none are executed in a good style.
Coptic and Greek inscriptions are most numerous in this tomb;
among them one to the effect that 'Hermogenes of Amasa has seen
and admired the Syringes; but this tomb of Memnon, after he had
examined it, he more than admired'(or admired more than the others,
'ii-ii-c":';";";'",']):-;)'". - It is a remarkable fact that the cartouches of
Ramses TI. are superimposed 1111011 others, which either represent the
earlier name ofll amses YI., or probably of his predecessor Ramses V.

Before the doors are representations like those before No. 8. -
