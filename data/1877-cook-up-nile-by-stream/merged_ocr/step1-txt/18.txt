UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 17

DAILY ITINERARY.

SECTION I.

FIRST DAY.

The starting-place is now from above the new iron bridge
"Kaer-el-Nil," which leads to the Pyramids of Ghizeh. The
Steamer generally leaves at 3 p.m., and arrives same evening at
Badrachin (railway station, and starting-point to visit the site

having visited the site where Memphis stood, to witness an important fair, held every Wednesday, at a, village'on our way. We get
back at about noon to the Steamer, which starts immediately.

THIRD DAY.
We start early in the morning, in order to pass, before nightfall, the mountain "Gebel-el-Dayr," on the top of which stands a
Coptic convent, whose inmates used formerly to plunge into
