despatch letters except at two or three places where Post <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieeie<br/>
</span>were established last season, the service being still performed by<br/>

general information and advice to travellers, suggested by personal<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
OUTFIT AND CHOICE OF ROUTES.<br/>
<br/>
In direct opposition to all existing guide-books and their<br/>
stereotyped instructions, cautioning travellers to encumber themselves with a hundred useless articles they never want, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">say </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l<br/>
</span>Come out to Egypt and on the Nile just as you would travel and<br/>
are accustomed to travel anywhere else in spring or autumn. The<br/>
climate from November to the end of March is delicious, dry, and<br/>
warm, with few exceptions. No special <span style="color: #0000FF;">precautions </span>whatever are<br/>
required, and it is quite sufficient to observe the regimen one is<br/>
accustomed to. With respect to all the tremendous dangers and<br/>
frequency of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ophthalmic</span>, it is very rarely heard of amongst the<br/>
travelling colony; good physicians and chemists are established<br/>
at Alexandria and Cairo, and on board every Steamer there is a<br/>
doctor, supplied with everything that may be wanted.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing of real use is a white or green muslin veil,<br/>
twined round the hat and covering the neck against the sun<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">parasol </span>to be used as a stick, and a pair of gloves. N or need any<br/>
one be afraid of great heat during the Nile Excursion on board a<br/>
Steamer; <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the contrary, be careful to take a warm shawl or a<br/>
good overcoat along with you, as the evenings are very cool, and<br/>
even <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the day, when steaming against the wind, it is sometimes piercingly cold. The only places where the heat is <span style="color: #0000FF;">really<br/>
