The cabins contain one or two beds, never more; in some<br/>
boats there are all single cabins, with the exception of the stern<br/>
and fore cabins, which are very roomy and always contain two<br/>
or three beds. Any party applying in good time, and not minding the expense of a third berth, if the stern cabin contains three<br/>
beds, can engage it beforehand, and thus secure greater comfort<br/>
and privacy. Arrangements can also be made to have <span style="color: #0000FF;">meals<br/>
</span>served separately in this cabin.<br/>
