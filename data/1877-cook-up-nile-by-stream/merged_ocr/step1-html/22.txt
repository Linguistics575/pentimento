meal, the Temple being only about <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mile </span>and a half distant.<br/>
All around Thebes visitors are continually pursued by dealers in<br/>
antiquities, mostly poor imitations<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>and the Consuls themselves,<br/>
who all deal in these articles, are not much better than the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rest</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>Be careful not to offer more than a shilling for an object for<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>which SI is asked, for you may be sure to get it<span style="color: #ff0000;">!</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>TWELFTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Starting early from Luxor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>is reached at about 11 a.m.,<br/>
and after visiting its Temple we continue our journey up stream,<br/>
arriving the same evening at Edfou.<br/>
<br/>
THIRTEENTH DAY<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The splendid Temple of Edfou, the most complete and <span style="color: #0000FF;">best<br/>
</span>preserved monument in Egypt, and giving the best idea of the<br/>
early Egyptian architecture, is kept in custody by a government<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Til</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>officer, and is the only place where beggars are not allowed<br/>
to bother you for backsheesh; but they are the more <span style="color: #0000FF;">ravenous<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">= </span>when you emerge again from the stronghold. Half a day <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
</span>devoted to this place, and it can be visited either now or on<br/>
returning; this must depend entirely on the time of arrival. If<br/>
the visit is postponed and the Steamer leaves in the morning<br/>
early, the quarries of Gebel-el-Silsileh come in view after about<br/>
five hours' sail. It is hardly worth while to go ashore, since the<br/>
few grottos and chapels can just as well be seen from aboard;<br/>
two hours more bring us to the ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kom-Ombo</span>, where the<br/>
Steamer stops for the night.<br/>
<br/>
FOURTEENTH DAY<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Assouan, the limit of Upper Egypt and an important town, is<br/>
reached in the forenoon. As soon as the Steamer stops, a swarm<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ubians </span>come to offer ostrich feathers, eggs, and other articles<br/>
for sale.<br/>
<br/>
Opposite to Assouan is the Island Elephantine and its <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nilometer</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>we visit at once. The remainder <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>that day is<br/>
devoted to Assouan and its bazaars.<br/>
