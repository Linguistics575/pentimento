<br/>
correct in every respect except in the statements concerning<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tradie </span>on the Nile-it would be desirable, and greatly to the<br/>
interest of all travellers, that there should be one soon. In his<br/>
statements concerning the Nile Steamers there is a slight error,<br/>
as the real fare is exactly one half of that <span style="color: #ff0000;">mentioned-hat </span>then<br/>
it must be considered that the author was one of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tieeroy's<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">inoiie</span>'s in 1869, and had a "free passage," and that no one can<br/>
or will give any positive and reliable information in this country.<br/>
<br/>
"The Land of the Nile; or, Egypt Past and Present," by W.<br/>
B. Davenport Adams, price <span style="color: #ff0000;">28</span>. 6d., is one of the latest additions<br/>
to literature of this description. The country is well described,<br/>
and the author has successfully attempted to combine a large<br/>
amount of useful information with an agreeable style. The<br/>
engravings are well executed, but we observe that in the maps on<br/>
pages 11 and 322 the railway is shown direct between Suez and<br/>
Cairo, whereas that line has been abandoned for some years.<br/>
The "sacred "ibis is stated, on page 29, to be as common now<br/>
as of old, whereas this description of ibis is a veritable <span style="color: #0000FF;">ram </span>avis<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">terki</span>.<br/>
<br/>
"The Attractions of the Nile," by the Rev. A. C. Smith, is<br/>
written in a readable and interesting style.<br/>

DEPARTURE FROM CAIRO, AND DAILY<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ITINERARY..<br/>
<br/>
</span>Having secured a passage and paid for the Ticket, the preparations are soon completed; passengers have but to <span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>go on<br/>
board at the appointed time with their luggage. Small change<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">copper-about </span>ten francs a head-ought to be procured in<br/>
Cairo, and linen enough packed up to last for three weeks, no<br/>
washing being done on board or by the way. For a small<br/>
gratuity the sailors will wash small things, such as socks and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">handkerchiefs</span>, but no ironing is done.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">During </span>the month of December Steamers leave Cairo<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Boulak</span>) regularly every fortnight, and from J <span style="color: #0000FF;">annary </span>to March<br/>
every week. (See "Movements of the Nile Steamers "<span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
