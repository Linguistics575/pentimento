felt is daring the three days' stay at Luxor, the excursion to the<br/>
Kings' Tombs, and, when at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assouan</span>, to Philae; still, as a rule,<br/>
any person accustomed to open-air exercise can easily support it,<br/>
and the week spent on board the Steamer, before arriving at these<br/>
places, is a capital preparation. Mosquitoes need not be feared,<br/>
as they disappear from the cabins as soon as the Steamer moves.<br/>
<br/>
All excess in eating and drinking must of course be carefully<br/>
avoided; the regular meals served in Hotels and on board the<br/>
Steamers are all that is required. Coffee prepared in the Turkish<br/>
fashion is served after all meals, and this delicious beverage can<br/>
be had everywhere and at any time. Four meals a day are given<br/>
on board the Steamers, viz., breakfast, lunch, dinner, and tea.<br/>
<br/>
Great caution must be taken not to sleep with open windows,<br/>
and not to lie exposed to the chilly night air. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Very </span>often severe<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">diarrhea </span>results from carelessness in this respect. Instead of<br/>
imitating the Arabs in wearing the "fez "-a most unhealthy<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">praetiee</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>would be much better to imitate them in wearing<br/>
warm cloth round the stomach. The best time to visit Egypt<br/>
and the Nile is from November to the end of March. From all<br/>
parts of Europe Railways lead to Venice, Trieste, Genoa, Naples,<br/>
Brindisi, and Marseilles. The Peninsular and Oriental Steamers<br/>
leave Venice every Friday, and Brindisi on Monday morning.<br/>
The passage from Brindisi to Alexandria takes three days and a<br/>
half. The Austrian Lloyd's Steamers leave Trieste on Friday<br/>
at midnight, stopping at Corfu for a few hours, and accomplishing<br/>
the passage in five days. Both these lines are universally known<br/>
for their splendid boats and the excellent <span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class </span>accommodation they afford. The price of passage is the same--<span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>sterling<br/>
