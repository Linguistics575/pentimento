<span>18 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
the river as soon as a boat came in sight, and swimming towards<br/>
it, with the greatest dexterity would catch hold of the small<br/>
boat in tow, and climb on deck to ask for <span style="color: #0000FF;">backsheesh</span>. In the<br/>
afternoon we pass in succession the splendid sugar factories of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bib√©-Feshne</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maghhgha</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ben-in-Zaar</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Samaloot</span>, & c.<br/>
<br/>
Towards evening Minieh is reached; it contains a fine palace'<br/>
belonging to the Viceroy, who generally spends a few weeks here<br/>
in the winter; and a most extensive sugar <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufactory</span>, employing<br/>
about 2000 people. A visit to this establishment will well repay<br/>
the trouble, and every attention is shown to <span style="color: #ff0000;">visitors</span>. The works<br/>
generally commence in the beginning of January, and when in<br/>
activity the evening is the usual time to admit <span style="color: #0000FF;">visitors</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>If the Steamer is coaled quickly, after the visit to the Sugar<br/>
Factory it will continue to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beni-Hassan</span>, two hours further<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>FOURTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beni-Hassan</span>, another halting-place for sight-seeing,<br/>
swarms of beggars and miserable donkeys without saddles or<br/>
bridles--<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>worst all along the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-await </span>the arrival of the<br/>
Steamer. The Rock Tombs of Beni-Hassan are reached in<br/>
half an hour. The northern grottos are high up on a hill to<br/>
the left, and the Specs <span style="color: #ff0000;">Artemedos </span>straight on in a valley eastward-both ought to be visited. Towards noon, the excursion<br/>
is ended, and the Steamer starts again. A few hours' course<br/>
brings us in sight of the mountain "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel-aboo-faydah</span>," and<br/>
towards evening <span style="color: #ff0000;">Manfaloot</span>, a little town of some importance, is<br/>
<br/>
reached.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">FIFTH </span>DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Some time before mid-day, we arrive <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sioot</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assioot</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>residence of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Pasha, the Inspector General to Upper Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
</span>which <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assioot </span>is the capital. The remainder of the day is devoted<br/>
to a visit to the large bazaar, and the hills behind the town,<br/>
which afford <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>splendid view of the Nile Valley. A very important market is held at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assioot</span>. Before the abolition of<br/>
slavery, it was the principal slave market; but, minus this peculiarity, it offers still, at the present time, interesting features <span style="color: #0000FF;">for<br/>
</span>the observer<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
