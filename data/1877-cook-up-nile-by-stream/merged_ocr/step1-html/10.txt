<span>UP THE NILE BY STEAM. <span style="color: #0000FF;">11<br/>
<br/>
</span>beginning at the tombs of Beni-Hassan, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finishing </span>the trip <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>the First Cataract, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>. By thus visiting the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dendarah</span>, and other minor monuments, before Thebes, they lose<br/>
nothing of their grandeur, and produce their full impression.<br/>
The time allowed and fixed for sight-seeing is quite adequate<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">suffieient</span>, whatever may be stated to the contrary; out of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>the passengers who made the Tour on board the Steamers,<br/>
there was not one who was not thoroughly <span style="color: #0000FF;">satisfied </span>in this<br/>
respect.<br/>
<br/>
A passenger by Dahabeah is conveyed up stream as fast as possible, whenever there is a favourable wind, by day or night, and<br/>
begins sight-seeing at the wrong <span style="color: #0000FF;">end-on </span>his way down; a<br/>
Steamer never travels by night, and therefore has the double<br/>
advantage that no scenery is lost and sleep is undisturbed.<br/>
<br/>
Even the objection raised by travellers intending to remain<br/>
several months on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>for the benefit of their health (a stay<br/>
that could not hitherto be effected by going up on a steamer)<br/>
has now been removed by the arrangements we have made for<br/>
the issue of tickets allowing the journey to be broken either on<br/>
the way up or down at Thebes, where a new hotel (Luxor Hotel)<br/>
has just been opened, where invalids may make their home for<br/>
a part of the winter, and where the antiquarian will be able to<br/>
devote one or several weeks to the numberless and interesting<br/>
ruins and monuments which abound in that most attractive part<br/>
of the Nile, and also enjoy the benefit of this mild and genial<br/>
climate.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly every week in the season a Steamer is regularly <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched</span>, and letters are forwarded to passengers up the N ile on<br/>
board the other Steamers l the returning boats receive letters to<br/>
be posted from the up boats, and they always stop together for<br/>
half-an-hour on meeting each other. The sailings and stoppings<br/>
of a Steamer are always fixed and can be relied upon, so that<br/>
telegraphic messages can be received and forwarded nearly every<br/>
day through our <span style="color: #0000FF;">Office </span>in Cairo. The calculation of time employed<br/>
is easy and certain, and the date of return can be fixed beforehand, so that ulterior travelling arrangements can be made <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
