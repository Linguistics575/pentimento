<span>22 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
FIFTEENTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
After an early breakfast, donkeys and camels, at choice, are<br/>
waiting to carry us through the town and bazaar of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assouun<br/>
</span>and the cemetery, to the desert road leading towards <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philae</span>.<br/>
About <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>mile from the town, on the hills to the left, are<br/>
the celebrated granite quarries where the obelisks were <span style="color: #0000FF;">procured</span>, and where one may be seen partly cut out of the rock.<br/>
This visit is better made now. Continuing our road afterwards, in about one hour we arrive at the river, where a boat<br/>
is waiting to convey us to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philae</span>. After exploring this<br/>
enchanting place in every part and lunching in the small temple<br/>
amid the pillars overlooking the Nile, passengers bound to <span style="color: #ff0000;">WadiHalfa </span>cross the river here, and go on board the Second Cataract<br/>
Steamer, which is anchored in front of the temple on the opposite<br/>
side. If we do not intend to go further up the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, we get into<br/>
the boat or Dahabeah, and, instead of crossing the river back to<br/>
the place where we embarked coming from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assouan</span>, float down<br/>
the river and stop a little above the Cataract. Landing here, we<br/>
reach in a few minutes an eminence whence the finest view of the<br/>
Cataract is obtained, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ubian </span>boys are seen dexterously<br/>
shooting the Cataract on logs of wood. We embark again and<br/>
our boat proceeds across the river through small rapids to the<br/>
village Mahattah. We then mount our donkeys and camels and<br/>
return to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assouan </span>by another road, striking to the left of the<br/>
village, and coasting the N ile, all the way down enjoying the more<br/>
magnificent and varied views of the wild scenery. As a rule,<br/>
guides and donkey boys do not like to take this way back, but<br/>
the interest it offers is so great that on no account ought it to<br/>
be abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
[ Passengers wishing to shoot the Cataract can do <span style="color: #ff0000;">so-at </span>their<br/>
own expense and <span style="color: #0000FF;">risk-by </span>making arrangements the day before.<br/>
The charge for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dahabeah </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>party to shoot the Cataract is<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Â£8 </span>to S12 <span style="color: #0000FF;">sterling </span>]<br/>
<br/>
SIXTEENTH DAY<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Early in the morning the Steamer starts on its return journey,<br/>
calling at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>, if necessary, and arriving the same day at Luxor,<br/>
where it stops for the night<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
