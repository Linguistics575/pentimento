<span>UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 27<br/>
<br/>
for a walk through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">straggling </span>streets of the town, which, like<br/>
all other towns and villages in Nubia, consists of mud huts<br/>
thatched with reed and palm leaves. It contains also a temple<br/>
which may be visited, although it is not in a good state of<br/>
preservation.<br/>
<br/>
The same day brings us to Ibrim, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ibreem</span>, 15 miles from<br/>
Derr. In addition to two little temples or tombs, cut out in the<br/>
rock, there is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>castle <span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span>by the Romans, whence a fine<br/>
view is to be had of the Nile and the surrounding hills.<br/>
<br/>
SIXTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Arrive at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ipsambool</span>, or Aboo-Simbel (32 miles). This monument is the greatest attraction <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubia </span>has to offer to the<br/>
antiquarian student. It is hewn in the solid rock, and is rendered<br/>
specially imposing by four gigantic figures of Rameses IL, each<br/>
66 feet high. The temple is partly choked with sand, and somewhat difficult of access, bat the <span style="color: #0000FF;">interior </span>well repays the exertion.<br/>
It is divided into four compartments, and is 185 feet deep.<br/>
The paintings and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sculptures </span>exceed in beauty and grandeur any<br/>
which the tourist has hitherto seen on the Nile. The smaller<br/>
temple, 84 feet in depth, is dedicated to Athor; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fapade </span>is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">orhamented </span>with six colossal statues of Rameses, his wife, and<br/>
children. A whole day is devoted to the examination of these<br/>
temples.<br/>
<br/>
SEVENTH DAY<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Arrive at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wztdy-Halfah </span>(40 miles from Aboo-Simbel, and about<br/>
210 miles from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>), the terminal point of the voyage. The<br/>
Second Cataract is 7 or 8 miles <span style="color: #0000FF;">further </span>south, and consists of<br/>
rapids, which, extending for about 5 miles, thoroughly impede<br/>
the navigation of the river; indeed, for nearly 100 miles the<br/>
bed of the river is a succession of sunken rocks. A good view of<br/>
the Second Cataract and the surrounding country is obtained by<br/>
ascending the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliff </span>called Aboo-Seer, and to afford the opportunity<br/>
of doing so the Steamer remains at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widy-Halfah </span>a whole day<br/>
before returning<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
