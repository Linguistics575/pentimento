</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>same uniform scenery, nothing can be more delicious;<br/>
besides, it is "the fashion."<br/>

</span>medical aid being obtainable-even deaths on board, occurring<br/>
every season, are never even mentioned. <span style="color: #0000FF;">During </span>every season<br/>
such incidents occur, and frequently the Steamers are hailed for<br/>
medical assistance from the ship's doctor, or to take in<br/>
tow Dahabeahs wanting to return as fast as possible to Cairo.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Towing </span>of any craft is strictly prohibited, and these applications have all to be declined, except under exceptional <span style="color: #ff0000;">cir~cumstances</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Dahabeah passengers cannot even reckon on the medical<br/>
services of the doctors on board the Steamers; although<br/>
willing to render. assistance whenever possible, it is not<br/>
always practicable for Steamers to stop when hailed at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>intermediate point <span style="color: #0000FF;">without </span>disadvantage to the prescribed<br/>
Itinerary.<br/>
<br/>
Accidents on Dahabeahs are constantly occurring, and adverse<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">winds </span>in going up or down tend greatly to retard their progress<br/>
and promote the discomfort of their passengers.<br/>

impression upon the English public. If the truth were told of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>disasters, delays, and deaths in connection with Dahabeahs<br/>
that went up the river last season, Egyptian visitors would be<br/>
