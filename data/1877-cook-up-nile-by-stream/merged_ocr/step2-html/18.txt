</span>DAILY ITINERARY<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>SECTION I.<br/>
<br/>
FIRST DAY.<br/>
<br/>
The starting-place is now from above the new iron bridge<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr-el-Nil</span>," which leads to the Pyramids of Ghizeh. The<br/>
Steamer generally leaves at 3 p.m., and arrives same evening at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Badrachin </span>(railway station, and starting-point to visit the site<br/>
of Memphis, the Serapeum, and the Pyramids of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dashoor</span>). Under the new arrangements, as worked out last<br/>
season, donkeys sent from Cairo the same day will be waiting at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Badrachin </span>to take the passengers to Memphis, the Serapeum,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">& </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">c.</span>, before the departure of the Steamer the following morning.<br/>
These places, being so near to Cairo, and easily accessible by rail,<br/>
are generally visited from Cairo, donkeys being sent on during<br/>
the night, or taken along in the trains; but Steamers on their<br/>
way up the Nile now allow time for sight-seeing at this place.<br/>
<br/>
SECOND DAY.<br/>
<br/>
The excursion to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>and the Serapeum is made, starting<br/>
in the morning. We have an opportunity on returning, and after<br/>
having visited the site where Memphis stood, to witness an important fair, held every Wednesday, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">village </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>our way. We get<br/>
back at about noon to the Steamer, which starts immediately.<br/>
In the afternoon we pass on our right the curtailed Pyramid,<br/>
called "El <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kedab</span>," or False Pyramid. Towards evening we.<br/>
come to Waste, a village of no importance, where the Steamer<br/>
generally stops for the night, unless the night be clear and moonlit, in which case the Steamer continues its course for some time.<br/>
<br/>
THIRD DAY.<br/>
We start early in the morning, in order to pass, before nightfall, the mountain "Gebel-el-Dayr," on the top of which stands a<br/>
Coptic convent, whose inmates used formerly to plunge <span style="color: #0000FF;">into<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
