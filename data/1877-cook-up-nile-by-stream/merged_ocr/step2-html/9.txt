<span>10 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
Steamers regularly without loss, and<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>as before stated, it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">only<br/>
<br/>
</span>managed by Government assistance. Taking into consideration<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>all these circumstances, any shortcomings ought to be endured<br/>
and disposed of with an easy temper; the Tour once accomplished,<br/>
every little hardship is naturally soon forgotten, and nothing will<br/>
remain but to remember, with unalloyed pleasure, the interesting<br/>
journey and the wonderful scenes visited.<br/>
<br/>
Another great service has been indirectly rendered to the<br/>
travelling public by the revival of Steamboat <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>on the Nile.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">During </span>the last few years the prices for Dahabeahs have risen to<br/>
an extraordinary height. In the season of 1871 and 1872, before<br/>
the Steamers began to ply, the price asked for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class </span>boat<br/>
was from £90 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">£120 </span>sterling a month, for three or four months<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>a short time afterwards they came down to £60, or even lower,<br/>
and remained stationary at that rate all the season through. It<br/>
is quite natural that Dragomans, owners of Dahabeahs, and the<br/>
numerous class of tradesmen whose interests are threatened, are<br/>
not much in favour of Steamers, which will surely diminish, or<br/>
partly destroy, their business<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and any one applying to such<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>for information may certainly expect to be misled, and to<br/>
hear the most awful reports about the Steamers. Many instances<br/>
occurred last season, where Dragomans absolutely declined to obey<br/>
the written orders of their <span style="color: #ff0000;">employers</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>they have been accustomed<br/>
so long to have it all their own way, that they do not like to<br/>
sacrifice any of their privileges. In going by Steamer, the<br/>
traveller is saved an enormous amount of trouble and <span style="color: #0000FF;">expense-my<br/>
</span>bargaining, no contract, and no quarrelling when the journey is<br/>
completed. All he has to do is to take his Ticket and come on<br/>
board at the appointed hour.<br/>
<br/>
Time and patience will work the change from sail to steam,<br/>
even on the Nile<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>there is no reason whatever why <span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>ought<br/>
not to travel by steam on this enormous stream, as well as on<br/>
other rivers whose shores offer more variety and more attractions<br/>
to the ordinary visitor and sight-seer. The order of sight-seeing<br/>
by steamboat is perfectly in harmony with the importance of the<br/>
monuments. The stoppages take place <span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>sailing up stream<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
