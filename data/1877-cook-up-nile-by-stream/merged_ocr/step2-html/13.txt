<span>14 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
The principal thing one must not forget is money, travelling<br/>
in the East and Hotel accommodation being very expensive.<br/>
English <span style="color: #0000FF;">circular </span>and bank notes generally lose 1 to 2 per cent.<br/>
in exchange for gold; other notes are not current, nor can any<br/>
payment be made except in specie.<br/>
<br/>
GUIDE-BOOKS.<br/>
<br/>
These notes are not designed to supersede any of the existing<br/>
guide-books, their only object being to give such special<br/>
information as is generally wanted and wished for by intending<br/>
Steamboat passengers. A few words may be added here con<br/>
cerning this <span style="color: #ff0000;">subject</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cook</span>'s HANDBOOK FOR EGYPT AND THE NILE "is one of the<br/>
most recent, most complete, and most readable Handbooks<br/>
published. Price <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gs</span>. With Five Maps.<br/>
<br/>
"The Land of the Pharaohs: Egypt and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sinai</span>"; is a handsome work, by Dr. Manning, and published by the Religious<br/>
Tract Society<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is profusely illustrated with Pen and Pencil<br/>
sketches, and will serve as a souvenir for visitors to these ancient<br/>
regions. It is handsomely bound, gilt edges, price 88.<br/>
<br/>
"Itineraire de la Haute Egypte," by Mariette Bey, is a<br/>
practical description of the Nile monuments between Cairo <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>Assouan, and, emanating from official sources, is a valuable companion on a Tour to the First Cataract.<br/>
<br/>
"The Nile without a Dragoman," by Frederic Eden, records<br/>
the author's experience of a Dahabeah trip to the Second <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cataract</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>It is written in a readable style, but is scarcely practical enough<br/>
for a guide-book. The price is 10s. 6d.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">So </span>many <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>and sensational works have been published<br/>
about this wonderful country that a choice is very <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult</span>. To<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>any one desirous of getting really valuable and sound information<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>thing nearly impossible to obtain in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt-we </span>can recommend no better book than Heinrich Stephan's "Das <span style="color: #ff0000;">HeutigeEgypten</span>." (F. A. Brockhaus, Leipzig 1872.) If there is no<br/>
English translation published yet of this remarkable <span style="color: #0000FF;">work<br/>
