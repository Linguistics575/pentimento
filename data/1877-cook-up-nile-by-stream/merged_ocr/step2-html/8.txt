<span>UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 9<br/>
<br/>
means of conveyance, where every passenger can keep aloof from<br/>
or mix with whom he <span style="color: #0000FF;">likes-than </span>on board a Dahabeah, where<br/>
they all must form one family <span style="color: #0000FF;">party</span>, living day and night<br/>
in close proximity, and where continual frictions are unavoidable.<br/>
We repeat, it is very bad when misunderstanding arises between<br/>
the passengers on board a Steamer, but it is ten times worse in a<br/>
Dahabeah; and why, if a confidential party is not formed from the<br/>
very beginning, run the risk of spending three miserable months<br/>
with disagreeable travelling companions instead of so many<br/>
weeks?<br/>
<br/>
Mutual forbearance, a little <span style="color: #0000FF;">unselfishness</span>, and easy temper can<br/>
give great charms to this highly interesting <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tour</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and any one<br/>
travelling in the East, and especially on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, ought to<br/>
remember the country and place he is <span style="color: #0000FF;">in-that </span>it is utterly<br/>
impossible to get everything as easily as in a civilised country;<br/>
in short, he must make up his mind to rough it a little every now<br/>
and then, and not grumble on the least occasion, or he had <span style="color: #0000FF;">much</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>better stay at home.<br/>
<br/>
The expenses of the Steamboat Administration, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">~<br/>
</span>of supplying coal and various kinds of provisions, are very <span style="color: #0000FF;">serious</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A<br/>
</span>The matériel actually disposable for the passenger <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>on the<br/>
Nile is certainly not what it could and ought to be; but then <span style="color: #0000FF;">we<br/>
</span>ought to be thankful even for this, and consider that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Egyptian Government keep up these passenger Steamers at a.<br/>
<br/>
great pecuniary loss, and only for the sake and benefit of European<br/>
Tourists.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive </span>is improving this service gradually by<br/>
adding to the number and the comfort of the Steamers. The<br/>
excellent <span style="color: #ff0000;">cooking'ranges </span>introduced on the Steamers in 1873 have<br/>
rendered the commissariat department all that can be desired.<br/>
Passengers may consider the rate of £47 sterling excessive, but<br/>
they should consider that it includes <span style="color: #0000FF;">everything-living</span>, sight<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>seeing, guides, donkeys, and saddles (English saddles for ladies)<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-that </span>coal is very expensive upon the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, and that the servants<br/>
and crew in these small Steamers often outnumber the <span style="color: #0000FF;">paying<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">passengers</span>. No private enterprise could possibly work <span style="color: #0000FF;">these<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
