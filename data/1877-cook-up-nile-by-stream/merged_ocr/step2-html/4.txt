INTRODUCTION.<br/>
<br/>
IN the autumn of 1872 a pamphlet was published with the above<br/>
title. The edition then printed, together with other <span style="color: #ff0000;">editions<br/>
</span>published every year, being exhausted, it is deemed advisable to<br/>
present the information to the public in a similar and equally<br/>
concise form. The 1872 edition contained, in addition to a<br/>
description of the journey "Up the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>and the numerous<br/>
places and objects of interest upon the banks, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>full <span style="color: #ff0000;">programme<br/>
</span>of the Eastern arrangements of the firm under whose auspices this<br/>
book is prepared, together with expensive maps of the Levant<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>Palestine, & c., and one shilling was the published price. In<br/>
<br/>
arranging this New Edition of the same work it has <span style="color: #0000FF;">been<br/>
</span>considered advisable to exclude all extraneous matter, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>make the contents thoroughly practical and general. By adopt<br/>
ing this plan, and by retaining but two <span style="color: #0000FF;">maps-an </span>excellent one<br/>
of the Nile, and another of the routes to the East, engraved by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">E </span>W. and A. K. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Johnston</span>, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edinburgh-the </span>publishers are enabled<br/>
to offer the book in a pamphlet form at half its former price. The<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>arrangements of THOMAS COOK & SON for travel in Egypt,<br/>
<br/>
Palestine, <span style="color: #ff0000;">& </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">c.</span>, are most comprehensive, and full information<br/>
thereon will be gladly supplied on application at any of the<br/>
Tourist <span style="color: #0000FF;">Offices </span>enumerated upon the title-page.<br/>
