<span>28 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
EIGHTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
The excursion to Aboo-Seer is better made very <span style="color: #0000FF;">early </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the<br/>
morning, as it is quite two hours' ride on the opposite bank of<br/>
the river, where donkeys have already been passed by ferry-boat<br/>
in readiness for us.<br/>
<br/>
The Soudan Railway, now in construction, will next season<br/>
have completed 103 kilometres of track, and by special favour<br/>
the Administration will place at our disposal an engine and<br/>
carriage every time that our passengers may be willing to make<br/>
the journey over the upper part of the Second Cataract, visiting<br/>
also the waterfalls of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ambigole</span>, a point more interesting still<br/>
than both the First and Second Cataracts. Of course the<br/>
cost of such a ride must be defrayed by the passengers.<br/>
<br/>
NINTH, TENTH, AND ELEVENTH DAYS.<br/>
Begin the return journey, which is continued without stoppages<br/>
of importance.<br/>
Arrive at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>in the evening of the 11th day, or in the<br/>
morning of the 12th.<br/>
<br/>
TWELFTH DAY.<br/>
Visit to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Cataract in a boat, and the remaining two days<br/>
to be spent at leisure, until we effect our change on the down<br/>
river steamer at Assouan, and continue to Cairo as per First<br/>
Cataract itinerary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
RETURN VOYAGE.<br/>
<br/>
When, on the down journey, the boat stops in any place which<br/>
is not marked in the itinerary as a regular stopping-place, or<br/>
touches twice at the same station, passengers who want donkeys<br/>
to visit these places a second time must pay for the donkeys<br/>
themselves; the same applies to night excursions, visiting<br/>
Karnak, or any other place, by moonlight, or going to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fantasias</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
