the arrangements of the Steamers for the present season. In the<br/>

despatch letters except at two or three places where Post <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices<br/>
</span>were established last season, the service being still performed by<br/>

respective advantages and defects, we now proceed to give some<br/>
general information and advice to travellers, suggested by personal<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
OUTFIT AND CHOICE OF ROUTES.<br/>
<br/>
In direct opposition to all existing guide-books and their<br/>
stereotyped instructions, cautioning travellers to encumber themselves with a hundred useless articles they never want, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">say </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l<br/>
</span>Come out to Egypt and on the Nile just as you would travel and<br/>
are accustomed to travel anywhere else in spring or autumn. The<br/>
climate from November to the end of March is delicious, dry, and<br/>
warm, with few exceptions. No special precautions whatever are<br/>
required, and it is quite sufficient to observe the regimen one is<br/>
accustomed to. With respect to all the tremendous dangers and<br/>
frequency of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ophthalmic</span>, it is very rarely heard of amongst the<br/>
travelling colony; good physicians and chemists are established<br/>
at Alexandria and Cairo, and on board every Steamer there is a<br/>
doctor, supplied with everything that may be wanted.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing of real use is a white or green muslin veil,<br/>
twined round the hat and covering the neck against the sun; a<br/>
parasol to be used as a stick, and a pair of gloves. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nor </span>need any<br/>
one be afraid of great heat during the Nile Excursion on board a<br/>
Steamer; on the contrary, be careful to take a warm shawl or a<br/>
good overcoat along with you, as the evenings are very cool, and<br/>
even during the day, when steaming against the wind, it is sometimes piercingly cold. The only places where the heat is <span style="color: #0000FF;">really<br/>
