<span>18 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
the river as soon as a boat came in sight, and swimming towards<br/>
it, with the greatest dexterity would catch hold of the small<br/>
boat in tow, and climb on deck to ask for backsheesh. In the<br/>
afternoon we pass in succession the splendid sugar factories of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bib√©-Feshne</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maghagha</span>, Ben-in-Zaar, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Samaloot</span>, & c.<br/>
<br/>
Towards evening Minieh is reached; it contains a fine <span style="color: #0000FF;">palace<br/>
</span>belonging to the Viceroy, who generally spends a few weeks here<br/>
in the winter; and a most extensive sugar manufactory, employing<br/>
about 2000 people. A visit to this establishment will well repay<br/>
the trouble, and every attention is shown to visitors. The works<br/>
generally commence in the beginning of January, and when in<br/>
activity the evening is the usual time to admit visitors.<br/>
<br/>
If the Steamer is coaled quickly, after the visit to the Sugar<br/>
Factory it will continue to Beni-Hassan, two hours further.<br/>
FOURTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
At Beni-Hassan, another halting-place for sight-seeing,<br/>
swarms of beggars and miserable donkeys without saddles or<br/>
bridles--the worst all along the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-await </span>the arrival of the<br/>
Steamer. The Rock Tombs of Beni-Hassan are reached in<br/>
half an hour. The northern grottos are high up on a hill to<br/>
the left, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Speos </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Artemedos </span>straight on in a valley <span style="color: #0000FF;">eastward-both </span>ought to be visited. Towards noon, the excursion<br/>
is ended, and the Steamer starts again. A few hours' course<br/>
brings us in sight of the mountain "Gebel-aboo-faydah," and<br/>
towards evening <span style="color: #ff0000;">Manfaloot</span>, a little town of some importance, is<br/>
<br/>
reached.<br/>
FIFTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Some time before mid-day, we arrive at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sioot</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assioot</span>, the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>residence of a Pasha, the Inspector General to Upper Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
</span>which <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assioot </span>is the capital. The remainder of the day is devoted<br/>
to a visit to the large bazaar, and the hills behind the town,<br/>
which afford a splendid view of the Nile Valley. A very important market is held at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assioot</span>. Before the abolition of<br/>
slavery, it was the principal slave market; but, minus this peculiarity, it offers still, at the present time, interesting features <span style="color: #0000FF;">for<br/>
</span>the observer<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
