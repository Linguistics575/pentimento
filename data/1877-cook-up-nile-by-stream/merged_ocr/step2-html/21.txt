to oblige, and at once sends his servant on board to welcome<br/>
new arrivals and invite them to his house, where coffee is always<br/>
ready, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fantasia</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>may be organised.<br/>
<br/>
NINTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
At Luxor. The first day is generally devoted to a visit to the<br/>
Kings' Tombs. Starting early in the morning across the stream<br/>
by boat, the donkeys having already been conveyed across by the<br/>
same means, in about an hour we arrive at the Temple-palace of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Koorneh</span>, and after having examined it continue our journey<br/>
through the desolate valley, "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Molook</span>," to the Kings'<br/>
Tombs. Only two or three of the most interesting need<br/>
be <span style="color: #0000FF;">entered-Belzoni</span>'s Tomb, No. 17, and Bruce's, No. 11. After<br/>
lunch, which has been brought along and is taken in the entrance<br/>
of Tomb No. 6, those who like to walk can go over the mountain<br/>
chain, and come down near the Memnonium or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramesium</span>. The<br/>
others return by the same way they came, and a halt is made at the<br/>
Memnonium. On the way back to Luxor the ruins of the Temple<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">i </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amunoph </span>III. and the sitting Colossi are visited.<br/>
<br/>
TENTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
At Luxor. Once more across the river, and partly over the<br/>
same ground as the day before, to visit leisurely the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Templepalace </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet </span>Haboo, and after lunch make an excursion to<br/>
one of the most interesting private tombs, No. 35, called "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dayrel-Medeenet</span>," situated on a hill behind the Memnonium. Close by<br/>
are the Priests' Tombs, the largest of which may be visited<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>by those who are not easily frightened by bats and rather<br/>
rough and dangerous passages.<br/>
<br/>
After making a second stay at the Memnonium, the return to<br/>
Luxor is effected. If still early, a walk through Luxor and an<br/>
exploration of the Temple, mostly hidden by Arab dwellings<br/>
and stables, will finish the day.<br/>
<br/>
ELEVENTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
At Luxor. The day will be entirely devoted to Karnak. Lunch<br/>
may be taken out, or passengers may return on board to <span style="color: #0000FF;">that<br/>
