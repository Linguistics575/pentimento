<br/>
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.<br/>
<br/>
The fare of Â£47 sterling, before mentioned, covers everything<br/>
--living, guides, donkeys, also saddles (English saddles for<br/>
ladies), and boats to cross the river when necessary, as well<br/>
as the boat for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>and back; also candles to light the<br/>
caves, gratuities to servants and crew, and the regular fees<br/>
to donkey boys. But who could satisfy and silence the neverending craving for backsheesh? Every passenger, therefore,<br/>
ought to have some coppers to give away occasionally. It is<br/>
wonderful to see how ingenious these beggars are; those at<br/>
Thebes, especially, have acquired the greatest perfection; they all<br/>
speak a little English, and try to move your heart by the most<br/>
lamentable stories. They have either lost their father or mother,<br/>
and have no place to sleep <span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>or they show you a broken vessel,<br/>
crying bitterly that they dare not return home for fear of being<br/>
beaten<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
