<span>UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 29<br/>
<br/>
This three weeks' excursion on the Nile, and life on board<br/>
a ship, is generally quite long enough for any one, and it is<br/>
with great delight that the view of the citadel and minarets<br/>
of Cairo is hailed. A gentleman passenger last season<br/>
expressed his feelings very properly in saying that to do all<br/>
the work and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sight-seeing </span>up the Nile, and then to float idly<br/>
down, was just like reading a highly interesting book, and, when<br/>
finished, turning its leaves once more leisurely over and lingering with delight on the most beautiful passages, have a last<br/>
glimpse at them, and be very glad to have done with it.<br/>
<br/>
The captains and crews are of course all natives, and belong<br/>
to the regular navy; discipline, however, is not very strict on<br/>
board, nor have the captains, who only speak Arabic, any<br/>
authority over their passengers, which is sometimes greatly to be<br/>
regretted. They are, however, all very modest and obliging<br/>
men, and very much afraid of complaints being made against<br/>
them on return; for this reason, towards the end of the Tour,<br/>
they manage to get a certificate signed by all the passengers,<br/>
expressing their satisfaction. If such a testimonial cannot be<br/>
produced, or complaints are made against them, they are fined,<br/>
and part of their pay, which is already poor enough, is withheld.<br/>
<br/>
Formerly the doctors on board the Steamers were all natives,<br/>
but since last season, according to a decision of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive</span>,<br/>
European physicians belonging to the Sanitary Staff accompany<br/>
all passenger ships.<br/>
<br/>
Should any passenger desire to return to Cairo a day or two<br/>
sooner, he can be put down at any of the railway stations between<br/>
Roda and Ghizeh<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>but as there is only one train a day, he must<br/>
be careful not to miss it, or he might go without bed and food.<br/>
<br/>
We here add a copy of the general bill of regulations and list<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">stOpping-places</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the best course is not to interfere nor propose<br/>
any change whatever in this itinerary based on experience. Some<br/>
people will do so, and thus cause disorder and sometimes displeasure<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
