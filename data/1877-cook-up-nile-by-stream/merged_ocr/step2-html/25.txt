FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND CATARACT.<br/>
<br/>
The Khedivie Administration having placed a Steamer on the<br/>
Upper Nile, to ply between Philae and Wadi-Halfa, we inaugurated this new service <span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span>season. The experiment having<br/>
proved a. success, the Administration agreed to supply a<br/>
larger and more comfortable steamer than the one with which we<br/>
worked that service last year. The voyage to Wadi-Halfa and<br/>
back may be accomplished in 12 days, of which four and a half<br/>
are employed in sight-seeing ashore, and, after the return journey,<br/>
passengers will have to make the Upper <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>Steamer their hotel<br/>
for two or three extra days, waiting the arrival of the Lower<br/>
Nile Steamer at Assouan to take them back to Cairo. These<br/>
few days will be found anything but unpleasant by those who<br/>
delight in a soft climate and admire the beauties of nature.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Varied </span>scenes may be enjoyed every day, either by going<br/>
in a boat around the Island, or down the river <span style="color: #0000FF;">through<br/>
</span>the numberless rapids which precede the Cataracts, or by riding<br/>
to the neighbouring villages and the granite hills which border<br/>
the different camel paths towards Assouan. Were it only as a<br/>
resting-place, Philae would still be found delightful. Although<br/>
navigation on the Upper Nile is quite as easy and secure, if not<br/>
easier than that on the Lower <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, it is desirable to <span style="color: #0000FF;">allow </span>three<br/>
days' margin in case of any unforeseen delay above the <span style="color: #ff0000;">First<br/>
<br/>
</span>Cataract.<br/>
<br/>
FIRST DAY.<br/>
<br/>
We are at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>, 5 miles from Assouan. Now we have left the<br/>
confines of Egypt proper, and have entered Nubia. The Steamer<br/>
by which we continue our voyage'is waiting our arrival; our<br/>
baggage has been transferred from the other steamer. The<br/>
starting takes places soon after we have got on board<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
