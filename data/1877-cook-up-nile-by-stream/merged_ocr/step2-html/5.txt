<br/>
late years, and is getting more and more fashionable every season,<br/>
that very soon no American out on a "European Tour "will dare<br/>
to return home and face his friends if he has not done the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Orient </span>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and the "continental lions "are becoming so tame<br/>
and easy of access to every one, that no English Tourist who can<br/>
command the time and money will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">satisfied </span>unless he has gone<br/>
"the whole round."<br/>
<br/>
Guide-books and diaries of Tourists (who all feel bound, after<br/>
a single short visit, to benefit intending travellers by publishing<br/>
their personal views and <span style="color: #0000FF;">experiences-generally </span>very uninteresting) are certainly not wanting, but when they are all examined<br/>
a wonderfully small amount of valuable practical information can<br/>
be <span style="color: #0000FF;">gathered-with </span>rare exceptions it is the old story <span style="color: #0000FF;">repeated-interminable </span>chapters about travelling requisites, Dragomans,<br/>
Dahabeahs, & c.; it is indispensable to give at least one copy of<br/>
an agreement with a "Reis "drawn up in the grand presence of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Consul-it </span>looks so imposing; a long list of things to be<br/>
provided either from Europe or bought on the spot; and so many<br/>
sinister hints are thrown out about sanitary precautions, that it<br/>
is not at all surprising if a great many are frightened and deterred<br/>
from venturing on such an awful expedition.<br/>
<br/>
Of course all these publications are only destined for those few<br/>
who can afford the time and money to hire a Dahabeah and idle<br/>
away three months<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>nobody (except THOS. COOK & SON) ever<br/>
thought it worth while to bestow a thought on the great majority<br/>
of travellers who cannot afford both, and prefer steaming up the<br/>
Nile. It is for this great majority, representing at least <span style="color: #ff0000;">ninetenths </span>of the actual travelling public, that these pages, the result<br/>
of personal observation during eight seasons, have been written,<br/>
and it is sincerely hoped that their perusal will disperse many<br/>
false and exaggerated notions, and smooth the way for intending<br/>
Tourists.<br/>
<br/>
DAHABEAHS AND STEAMERS.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing has probably been so fully described and praised to<br/>
exhaustion as the famous "Dahabeah"<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and the idyllic charms <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
