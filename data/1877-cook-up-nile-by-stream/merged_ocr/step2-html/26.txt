<span>UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 25<br/>
<br/>
An hour and a half's course brings us to Debod or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dabod</span>, a<br/>
small village on the west side of the river. Here is a ruin, in a<br/>
good state of preservation, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a temple commenced by the<br/>
Ethiopian King Ashar-Amun. The Steamer <span style="color: #ff0000;">stOps </span>here for the<br/>
night, and, according to the time of arrival, the excursion is made<br/>
the same day or the following morning.<br/>
<br/>
SECOND DAY.<br/>
<br/>
The distances between the places of interest on the Upper <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile<br/>
</span>are very short, and with a few exceptions they all lie within a few<br/>
minutes from the Steamer, so that although ample time is allowed<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fall</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>for sight-seeing, several may be visited in the same day.<br/>
<br/>
In two hours we reach Kardash or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gertassee</span>, 15 miles from<br/>
Debod, which possesses the remnant of a temple and a quarry.<br/>
<br/>
In a few hours more we pass the narrow part of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>called<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">l </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Kalabsheh</span>," or Strait of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalabsheh</span>. For a distance<br/>
of four or five miles the granite mountains inclose the river on<br/>
either side, <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>at every curve varied views of most grand<br/>
and wild scenery. We get into the broad stream again, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalabsheh </span>(14 miles from Kardash) is soon reached. The Steamer<br/>
stops here four hours, and passengers visit the ruins, which are of<br/>
some size and beauty, and consist of the remains of two temples;<br/>
one, the largest temple in Nubia, must have been, when perfect, a<br/>
magnificent pile. In some chambers, to which access can be<br/>
gained, are paintings of the highest finish, in colours as vivid<br/>
as on the day on which they were executed. The smaller temple,<br/>
called "Bayt-el-Welly," or "House of the Saint," lies against <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>rocky hill to the right, and is partly <span style="color: #ff0000;">cutout </span>of the rock. Although<br/>
difficult of access, it is worth while to attempt the ascent, as the<br/>
temple contains excellent paintings, and the sculptures, recording<br/>
the battles of Rameses, are perfect.<br/>
<br/>
THIRD DAY.<br/>
<br/>
We pass and visit successively Dendoor, 12 miles from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalabsheh</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kirscheh</span>, ten miles further, which have cavern temples of<br/>
some magnitude<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
