<span>UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 19<br/>
<br/>
SIXTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
If necessary, the ship is coaled at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Soohag</span>, and Girgeh is<br/>
generally reached in the evening; there is nothing of interest in<br/>
this <span style="color: #0000FF;">place</span>--one of the dirtiest on the Nile. Girgeh, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bellianah</span>,<br/>
a small town about ten miles higher up, is the starting-point for<br/>
visiting Abydos. This visit, however, is better postponed and<br/>
made on the return journey, starting <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bellianah</span>. These<br/>
ruins are so grand and magnificent that they cannot lose any of<br/>
their charm and novelty even after Karnak has been seen.<br/>
<br/>
SEVENTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the visit to Abydos for the return journey, we reach<br/>
Keneh towards evening, and if still early enough this important<br/>
place may be visited before the night. The best porous jugs and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">gargoulets </span>for filtering the Nile water are made here; Keneh is<br/>
also celebrated for its dates, and was once noted for its dancing<br/>
girls. The latter, it appears, have now removed to Luxor, a<br/>
place of greater attraction to visitors. (See special notice on<br/>
page <span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>of New Hotel at Luxor.)<br/>
<br/>
EIGHTH DAY<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>In the morning passengers are conveyed in boats'across the<br/>
river, where donkeys are waiting to take us to the Temple of<br/>
Denderah, about an hour's ride. This is the first monument<br/>
of the kind met with, and the impression it produces is never to<br/>
be forgotten. It is rather puzzling at first to find one's way through<br/>
the halls and through the heaps of ruins surrounding the walls,<br/>
to discover any given site. However, a little practice will soon<br/>
facilitate <span style="color: #0000FF;">research </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}<br/>
<br/>
</span>If the visit to Denderah is finished by noon, the boat may<br/>
reach Luxor the same evening, and anchor <span style="color: #0000FF;">opposite </span>the Temple<br/>
of Luxor. The portico of the temple is occupied by the office of<br/>
Mustapha Aga, the well-known and frequently mentioned English<br/>
Consul. He speaks English fluently, is always willing and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ready<br/>
<br/>
