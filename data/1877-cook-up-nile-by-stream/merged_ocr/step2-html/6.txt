<span>UP THE NILE BY STEAM. <span style="color: #0000FF;">T<br/>
<br/>
</span>life in one of these boats, floating up and down the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
<br/>
</span>been sung in every imaginable strain. N o doubt, for invalids<br/>
or families wishing to spend the winter on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, for friends<br/>
on a shooting excursion, or for a young couple in their honeymoon<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-in </span>fact, for any one who can easily shut himself out <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
<br/>
</span>all communication with the civilised world and has got the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">temper </span>to lie idle for weeks and months, looking every day <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
<br/>
</span>the same uniform scenery, nothing can be more delicious;<br/>
besides, it is "the fashion."<br/>
<br/>
Such small drawbacks as sudden severe illness, accidents <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dire-arms</span>, and consequent helplessness of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">travellers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">no<br/>
</span>medical aid being <span style="color: #0000FF;">obtainable-even </span>deaths on board, occurring<br/>
every season, are never even mentioned. During every season<br/>
such incidents occur, and frequently the Steamers are hailed for<br/>
medical assistance from the ship's doctor, or to take in<br/>
tow Dahabeahs wanting to return as fast as possible to Cairo.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Towing </span>of any craft is strictly prohibited, and these applications have all to be declined, except under exceptional <span style="color: #ff0000;">cir~cumstances</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Dahabeah passengers cannot even reckon on the medical<br/>
services of the doctors on board the Steamers; although<br/>
willing to render. assistance whenever possible, it is not<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">always </span>practicable for Steamers to stop when hailed at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>intermediate point without disadvantage to the prescribed<br/>
Itinerary.<br/>
<br/>
Accidents on Dahabeahs are constantly occurring, and adverse<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">winds </span>in going up or down tend greatly to retard their progress<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>promote the discomfort of their passengers.<br/>
<br/>
The sad circumstance which occurred in the spring of <span style="color: #ff0000;">187 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">6</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>the overturning of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Dahabeah and the drowning of some<br/>
members of the family of Mr. Russell <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gurney</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span>a painful<br/>
impression upon the English public. If the truth were told of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>disasters, delays, and deaths in connection with Dahabeahs<br/>
that went up the river last season, Egyptian visitors would <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'very </span>cautious how they committed themselves to the dangerous<br/>
.and dilatory service<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
