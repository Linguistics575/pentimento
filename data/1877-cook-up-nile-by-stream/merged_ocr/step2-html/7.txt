<span>8 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
Even the most enthusiastic admirer of this majestic river must<br/>
confess that the scenery on its banks is very tame and soon<br/>
becomes monotonous. On board a steamer there is continual<br/>
change, and every turn brings new features, new sights<br/>
in view. A Dahabeah, when becalmed, may be detained in the<br/>
same spot for a whole week; or, if the passengers insist, as they<br/>
must do if they want to move on, and there is no head wind, the<br/>
crew will work away and haul the boat up <span style="color: #0000FF;">stream-a </span>very painful<br/>
sight, and really galley-work. Look at those poor fellows yoked<br/>
together with a rope round their breasts, toiling along with outstretched and swollen necks, and listen to their painful song as<br/>
they work, slowly advancing, by short steps, at the rate of from<br/>
five to six miles per <span style="color: #0000FF;">day </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Floating </span>down river, if contrary winds<br/>
prevail, Dahabeahs are no better off. Arabs can do nothing<br/>
without singing most <span style="color: #ff0000;">piteously</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>their songs, which are described<br/>
fully in every guide-book, may amuse you for a whole day, but<br/>
become, from constant repetition, quite unbearable.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile Steamers formerly carried from twelve to twenty<br/>
passengers. During the last three seasons larger Steamers have<br/>
been added to the service, replete with every convenience, acquired<br/>
from the experience of previous years: the smaller Steamer now<br/>
accommodating twenty passengers and the larger forty-five. If<br/>
the passengers are all well-educated <span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span>, behaving to each other<br/>
with due regard, there can be nothing more <span style="color: #ff0000;">pleasant</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>many become fast friends, and each individual contributes, by his acquired<br/>
knowledge and reading, to the general amusement and instruction, as very often men of great learning take advantage of the<br/>
steamers.<br/>
<br/>
The best means to enjoy this Tour thoroughly and <span style="color: #0000FF;">amid </span>all<br/>
unpleasantness is undoubtedly for a party of friends who know<br/>
each <span style="color: #0000FF;">other-or</span>, if not friends, at least parties of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">same<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nationality</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>hire a small special Steamer to themselves, as, by<br/>
paying thirteen or fourteen <span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class </span>fares, they can always be<br/>
accommodated.<br/>
<br/>
Dissensions and incompatibility of temper are less strongly felt,<br/>
and of less consequence, on board a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Steamboat-being </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">public<br/>
