10 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

Steamers regularly without loss, and, as before stated, it is only

managed by Government assistance. Taking into consideration
. all these circumstances, any shortcomings ought to be endured
and disposed of with an easy temper; the Tour once accomplished,
every little hardship is naturally soon forgotten, and nothing will
remain but to remember, with unalloyed pleasure, the interesting
journey and the wonderful scenes visited.

Another great service has been indirectly rendered to the
travelling public by the revival of Steamboat traffic on the Nile.
During the last few years the prices for Dahabeahs have risen to
an extraordinary height. In the season of 1871 and 1872, before
the Steamers began to ply, the price asked for a first-class boat
was from £90 to £120 sterling a month, for three or four months,
a short time afterwards they came down to £60, or even lower,
and remained stationary at that rate all the season through. It
is quite natural that Dragomans, owners of Dahabeahs, and the
numerous class of tradesmen whose interests are threatened, are
not much in favour of Steamers, which will surely diminish, or
partly destroy, their business, and any one applying to such
people for information may certainly expect to be misled, and to
hear the most awful reports about the Steamers. Many instances
occurred last season, where Dragomans absolutely declined to obey
the written orders of their employers; they have been accustomed
so long to have it all their own way, that they do not like to
sacrifice any of their privileges. In going by Steamer, the
traveller is saved an enormous amount of trouble and expense-my
bargaining, no contract, and no quarrelling when the journey is
completed. All he has to do is to take his Ticket and come on
board at the appointed hour.

Time and patience will work the change from sail to steam,
even on the Nile; there is no reason whatever why people ought
not to travel by steam on this enormous stream, as well as on
other rivers whose shores offer more variety and more attractions
to the ordinary visitor and sight-seer. The order of sight-seeing
by steamboat is perfectly in harmony with the importance of the
monuments. The stoppages take place in' sailing up stream,
