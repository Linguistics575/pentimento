UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 2:)

SEVENTEENTH DAY.

Descend from Luxor to Bellianeh, where donkeys have been
telegraphed for from Luxor.

EIGHTEENTH DAY.
The excursion to Abydos is now made-a good two hours' ride,
through rich fields; at about 12 o'clock we are again on board
and the journey is resumed.

NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH DAYS.

Continue the voyage without stopping, except at such places
as were not visited according to Programme during the up
journey; the Steamers only stop to coal, or for provisions,
according to requirements.



GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.

The fare of Â£47 sterling, before mentioned, covers everything
--living, guides, donkeys, also saddles (English saddles for
ladies), and boats to cross the river when necessary, as well
as the boat for Philae and back; also candles to light the
caves, gratuities to servants and crew, and the regular fees
to donkey boys. But who could satisfy and silence the neverending craving for backsheesh? Every passenger, therefore,
ought to have some coppers to give away occasionally. It is
wonderful to see how ingenious these beggars are; those at
Thebes, especially, have acquired the greatest perfection; they all
speak a little English, and try to move your heart by the most
lamentable stories. They have either lost their father or mother,
and have no place to sleep in; or they show you a broken vessel,
crying bitterly that they dare not return home for fear of being
beaten.
