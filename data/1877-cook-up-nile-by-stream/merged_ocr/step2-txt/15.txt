together, can order a special Steamer if they are willing to pay
for at least 14 full passages, or more, according to the size of the
Steamer disposable; in this case the time allowed (20 days) may
be prolonged, and stoppages ordered at pleasure, on condition
that overtime be paid in proportion to the total cost, and at the
rate of one-twentieth from the amount paid per day, payable on
return, for every day over and above the 20 days allowed.

The cabins contain one or two beds, never more; in some
boats there are all single cabins, with the exception of the stern
and fore cabins, which are very roomy and always contain two
or three beds. Any party applying in good time, and not minding the expense of a third berth, if the stern cabin contains three
beds, can engage it beforehand, and thus secure greater comfort
and privacy. Arrangements can also be made to have meals
served separately in this cabin.

It must, however, be borne in mind that any delay or faster sailing will necessarily change the time of arrival at the different
if stations all through, and it is only possible to give an approximate
