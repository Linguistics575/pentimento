UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 21

meal, the Temple being only about a mile and a half distant.
All around Thebes visitors are continually pursued by dealers in
antiquities, mostly poor imitations ; and the Consuls themselves,
who all deal in these articles, are not much better than the rest.
Be careful not to offer more than a shilling for an object for
which £1 is asked, for you may be sure to get it! p - .

TWELFTH DAY.

Starting early from Luxor, Esneh is reached at about 11 a.m.,
and after visiting its Temple we continue our journey up stream,
arriving the same evening at Edfou.

THIRTEENTH DAY.

The splendid Temple of Edfou, the most complete and best
preserved monument in Egypt, and giving the best idea of the
early Egyptian architecture, is kept in custody by a government
ofﬁcer, and is the only place where beggars are not allowed
to bother you for backsheeslz ; but they are the more ravenous
when you emerge again from the stronghold. Half a day is
devoted to this place, and it can be visited either now or on
returning ; this must depend entirely on the time of arrival. If
the visit is postponed and the Steamer leaves in the morning
early, the quarries of Gebel-el-Silsileh come in view after about
ﬁve hours’ sail. It is hardly worth while to go ashore, since the
few grottos and chapels can just as well be seen from aboard ;
two hours more bring us to the ruins of Kom-Ombo, where the
Steamer stops for the night.

FOURTEENTH DAY.

Assouan, the limit of Upper Egypt and an important town, is
reached in the forenoon. As soon as the Steamer stops, a swarm
of N ubians come to offer ostrich feathers, eggs, and other articles
for sale.

Opposite to Assouan is the Island Elephantine and its Nilo-
meter, which we visit at once. The remainder of that day is
devoted to Assouan and its bazaars.
