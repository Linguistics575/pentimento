18 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

the river as soon as a boat came in sight, and swimming towards
it, with the greatest dexterity would catch hold of the small
boat in tow, and climb on deck to ask for backsheesh. In the
afternoon we pass in succession the splendid sugar factories of
Bibé-Feshne, Maghagha, Ben-in-Zaar, Samaloot, &c.

Towards evening Minieh is reached; it contains a ﬁne palace
belonging to the Viceroy, who generally spends a few weeks here
in the winter ; and a most extensive sugar manufactory, employing
about 2000 people. A visit to this establishment will well repay
the trouble, and every attention is shown to visitors. The works
generally commence in the beginning of January, and when in
activity the evening is the usual time to admit visitors.

. If the Steamer is coaled quickly, after the visit to the Sugar
Factory it will continue to Beni-Hassan, two hours further.
FOURTH DAY.

At Beni-Hassan, another halting-place for sight-seeing,
swarms of beggars and miserable donkeys without saddles or
bridles—the worst all along the Nile—await the arrival of the
Steamer. The Rock Tombs of Beni-Hassan are reached in
half an hour. The northern grottos are high up on a hill to
the left, and the Speos Artemedos straight on in a valley east-
ward—both ought to be visited. Towards noon, the excursion
is ended, and the Steamer starts again. A few hours’ course
brings us in sight of the mountain “ Gebel-aboo-faydah,” and
towards evening Manfaloot, a little town of some importance, is

reached.
FIFTH DAY.

Some time before mid-day, we arrive at Sioot, or Assioot, the
- residence of a Pasha, the Inspector General to Upper Egypt, of
which Assioot is the capital. The remainder of the day is devoted
to a visit to the large bazaar, and the hills behind the town,
which afford a splendid view of the Nile Valley. A very im-
portant market is held at Assioot. Before the abolition of
slavery, it was the principal slave market ; but, minus this pecu-
liarity, it offers still, at the present time, interesting features for

the observer.
