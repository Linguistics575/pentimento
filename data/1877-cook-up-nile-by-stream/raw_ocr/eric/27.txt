26 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

The same day brings us to Dakkeh (10 miles), where there is a
temple supposed to have been built by the Ethiopian King Ergamun ;
a part of it is in a very good state of preservation. The sculptures
and hieroglyphics are extremely good, and in admirable condition.

The steamer proceeds for some time yet and possibly reaches
Maharraka, seven miles from Dakkeh ; here is a small temple, of
which but two rows of columns remain entire.

FO U RTH DAY.

(14 miles.) Arrive at Saboa or Wady-Saboah, “ The Valley
of the Lions.” It has little to indicate its former splendour.
The temple of Rameses II. is nearly buried in the sand. Two
statues, however, remain in sight, which may induce a short
visit.

Arrive at Korosko, 16 miles further, and about 100 miles from
Philae. It is from here that the great high road stretches across
the Desert to Shendy and Sennaar. Most of the caravans for
Khartoom start. from Korosko. Behind the village is a peak
called “Awes-el-Guarany,” the top of which is held sacred by
the natives, and is a point of pilgrimage, as being the tomb of the
saint from whom the mountain derives its name. The Steamer
remains at Korosko ﬁve hours, to enable the passengers to
accomplish the ascent of this peak—a rather difficult task, over a
steep path full of volcanic remains. The journey will repay the
fatigue, the view from that spot being splendid, commanding
on one side the Nile Valley, and on the other the desert road
winding its course amid rocky hills, and close to the village and
the road itself numberless caravans lying at rest.

FIFTH DAY.

Stop at A’mada, about 8 miles from Korosko, and there visit
a very interesting little temple.

We then come to Derr, only 5 miles further, a large town,
the capital of Lower Nubia. It is famous for its dates. Here
the Steamer remains three hours, thus aﬁbrding ample opportunity
