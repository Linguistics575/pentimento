UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 1?

DAILY ITINERARY.

 

SECTION I.

FIRST DAY.

The starting-place is now from above the new iron bridge
“Kasr-el-Nil,” which leads to the Pyramids of Ghizeh. The
Steamer generally leaves at 3 p.m., and arrives same evening at
Badrachin (railway station, and starting-point to visit the site
of Memphis, the Serapeum, and the Pyramids of Sakkarah and
Dashoor). Under the new arrangements, as worked out last
season, donkeys sent from Cairo the same day will be waiting at
Badrachin to take the passengers to Memphis, the Serapeum,
&c., before the departure of the Steamer the following morning.
These places, being so near to Cairo, and easily accessible by rail,
are generally visited from Cairo, donkeys being sent on during
the night, or taken along in the trains; but Steamers on their
way up the Nile now allow time for sight-seeing at this place.

SECOND DAY.

The excursion to Sakkarah and the Serapeum is made, starting
in the morning. We have an opportunity on returning, and after
having visited the site where Memphis stood, to witness an import-
ant fair, held every Wednesday, at a village on our way. We get
back at about noon to the Steamer, which starts immediately.
In the afternoon we pass on our right the curtailed Pyramid,
called “ El Kedab,” or False Pyramid. Towards evening we .
come to Waste, a village of no importance, where the Steamer
generally stops for the night, unless the night be clear and moon-
lit, in which case the Steamer continues its course for some time.

THIRD DAY.
We start early in the morning, in order to pass, before night-
fall, the mountain “ Gebel-el-Dayr,” on the top of which stands a
Coptic convent, whose inmates used formerly to plunge into
