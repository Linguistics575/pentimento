22 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

FIFTEENTH DAY.

After an early breakfast, donkeys and camels, at choice, are
waiting to carry us through the town and bazaar of Assouan
and the cemetery, to the desert road leading towards Philm.
About a mile from the town, on the hills to the left, are
the celebrated granite quarries where the obelisks were pro-
cured, and where one may be seen partly out out of the rock.
This visit is better made now. Continuing our road after-
wards, in about one hour we arrive at the river, where a boat
is waiting to convey us to Philae. After exploring this
enchanting place in every part and lunching in the small temple
amid the pillars overlooking the Nile, passengers bound to Wadi-
Halfa cross the river here, and go on board the Second Cataract
Steamer, which is anchored in front of the temple on the opposite
side. If we do not intend to go further up the Nile, we get into
the boat or Dahabeah, and, instead of crossing the river back to
the place where we embarked coming from Assouan, ﬂoat down
the river and stop a little above the Cataract. Landing here, we
reach in a few minutes an eminence whence the finest view of the
Cataract is obtained, and the Nubian boys are seen dexterously
shooting the Cataract on logs of wood. We embark again and
our boat proceeds across the river through small rapids to the
village Mahattah. We then mount our donkeys and camels and
return to Assouan by another road, striking to the left of the
village, and coasting the Nile, all the way down enjoying the more
magniﬁcent and varied views of the wild scenery. As a rule,
guides and donkey boys do not like to take this way back, but
the interest it offers is so great that on no account ought it to
be abandoned.

[Passengers wishing to shoot the Cataract can do so—at their
own expense and risk—by making arrangements the day before.
The charge for a Dahabeah for a party to shoot the Cataract is
from £8 to £12 sterling]

SIXTEENTH DAY.

Early in the morning the Steamer starts on its return journey,
calling at Esneh, if necessary, and arriving the same day at Luxor,
where it stops for the night.
