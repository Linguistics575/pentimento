6 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

late years, and is getting more and more fashionable every season,
that very soon no American out on a “ European Tour ” will dare
to return home and face his friends if he has not done the
“ Orient” ; and the “ continental lions " are becoming so tame
and easy of access to every one, that no English Tourist who can
command the time and money will be satisﬁed unless he has gone
“the whole round.”

Guide-books and diaries of Tourists (who all feel bound, after
a single short visit, to beneﬁt intending travellers by publishing
their personal views and experiences—generally very uninterest-
ing) are certainly not wanting, but when they are all examined
a wonderfully small amount of valuable practical information can
be gathered—with rare exceptions it is the old story repeated—-
interminable chapters about travelling requisites, Dragomans,
Dahabeahs, &c. ; it is indispensable to give at least one copy of
an agreement with a “ Reis ” drawn up in the grand presence of
the Consul—it looks so imposing; a long list of things to be
provided either from Europe or bought on the spot ; and so many
sinister hints are thrown out about sanitary precautions, that it
is not at all surprising if a great many are frightened and deterred
from venturing on such an awful expedition.

Of course all these publications are only destined for those few
who can afford the time and money to hire a Dahabeah and idle
away three months; nobody (except THOS. COOK & SON) ever
thought it worth while to bestow a thought on the great majority
of travellers who cannot afford both, and prefer steaming up the
Nile. It is for this great majority, representing at least nine-
tenths of the actual travelling public, that these pages, the result
of personal observation during eight seasons, have been written,
and it is sincerely hoped that their perusal will disperse many
false and exaggerated notions, and smooth the way for intending
Tourists.

DAHABEAHS AND STEAMERS.

Nothing has probably been so fully described and praised to
exhaustion as the famous “ Dahabeah”; and the idyllic charms of
