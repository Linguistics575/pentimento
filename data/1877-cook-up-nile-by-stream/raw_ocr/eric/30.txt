UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 29

This three weeks’ excursion on the Nile, and life on board
a ship, is generally quite long enough for any one, and it is
with great delight that the view of the citadel and minarets
of Cairo is hailed. A gentleman passenger last season
expressed his feelings very properly in saying that to do all
the work and sight-seeing up the Nile, and then to ﬂoat idly
down, was just like reading a highly interesting book, and, when
ﬁnished, turning its leaves once more leisurely over and linger-
ing with delight on the most beautiful passages, have a last
glimpse at them, and be very glad to have done with it.

The captains and crews are of course all natives, and belong
to the regular navy; discipline, however, is not very strict on
board, nor have the captains, who only speak Arabic, any
authority over their passengers, which is sometimes greatly to be
regretted. They are, however, all very modest and obliging
men, and very much afraid of complaints being made against
them on return; for this reason, towards the end of the Tour,
they manage to get a certiﬁcate signed by all the passengers,
expressing their satisfaction. If such a testimonial cannot be
produced, or complaints are made against them, they are ﬁned,
and part of their pay, which is already poor enough, is withheld.

Formerly the doctors on board the Steamers were all natives,
but since last season, according to a decision of the Khédive,
European physicians belonging to the Sanitary Staff accompany
all passenger ships.

Should any passenger desire to return to Cairo a day or two
sooner, he can be put down at any of the railway stations between
Roda and Ghizeh ; but as there is only one train a day, he must
be careful not to miss it, or he might go without bed and food.

We here add a copy of the general bill of regulations and list
of stOpping-places ; the best course is not to interfere nor propose
any change whatever in this itinerary based on experience. Some
people will do so, and thus cause disorder and sometimes dis-
pleasure.
