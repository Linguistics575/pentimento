UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 27

for a walk through the straggling streets of the town, which, like
all other towns and villages in Nubia, consists of mud huts
thatched with reed and palm leaves. It contains also a temple
which may be visited, although it is not in a good state of
preservation.

The same day brings us to Ibrim, or Ibreem, 15 miles from
Derr. In addition to two little temples or tombs, cut out in the
rock, there is a castle built by the Romans, whence a ﬁne
view is to be had of the Nile and the surrounding hills.

SIXTH DAY.

Arrive at Ipsambool, or Aboo-Simbel (32 miles). This monu-
ment is the greatest attraction Nubia has to offer to the
antiquarian student. It is hewn in the solid rock, and is rendered
specially imposing by four gigantic ﬁgures of Rameses 11., each
66 feet high. The temple is partly choked with sand, and some-
what difﬁcult of access, but the interior well repays the exertion.
It is divided into four compartments, and is 185 feet deep.
The paintings and sculptures exceed in beauty and grandeur any
which the tourist has hitherto seen on the Nile. The smaller
temple, 84 feet in depth, is dedicated to Athor; the facade is
ornamented with six colossal statues of Rameses, his wife, and
children. A whole day is devoted to the examination of these
temples.

SEVENTH DAY.

Arrive at Wzidy-Halfah (40 miles from Aboo-Simbel, and about
210 miles from Philae), the terminal point of the voyage. The
Second Cataract is 7 or 8 miles further south, and consists of
rapids, which, extending for about 5 miles, thoroughly impede
the navigation of the river ; indeed, for nearly 100 miles the
bed of the river is a succession of sunken rocks. A good view of
the Second Cataract and the surrounding country is obtained by
ascending the cliff called Aboo-Seer, and to aﬁ'ord the opportunity
of doing so the Steamer remains at wady-Halfah a whole day
before returning.
