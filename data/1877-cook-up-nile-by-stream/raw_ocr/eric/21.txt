to oblige, and at once sends his servant on board to welcome
new arrivals and invite them to his house, where coffee is always
ready, and Fantasias may be organised.

NINTH DAY.

At Luxor. The ﬁrst day is generally devoted to a visit to the
Kings’ Tombs. Starting early in the morning across the stream
by boat, the donkeys having already been conveyed across by the
same means, in about an hour we arrive at the Temple-palace of
Koorneh, and after having examined it continue our journey
through the desolate valley, “ Bab-el-Molook,” to the Kings’
Tombs. Only two or three of the most interesting need
be entered—Belzoni’s Tomb, No. 17, and Bruce’s, No. 11. After
lunch, which has been brought along and is taken in the entrance
of Tomb No. 6, those who like to walk can go over the mountain
chain, and come down near the Memnonium or Ramesium. The
others return by the same way they came, and a halt is made at the
Memnonium. On the way back to Luxor the ruins of the Temple
of Amunoph III. and the sitting Colossi are visited.

TENTH DAY.

At Luxor. Once more across the river, and partly over the
same ground as the day before, to visit leisurely the Temple-
palace of Medeenet Haboo, and after lunch make an excursion to
one of the most interesting private tombs, No. 35, called “ Dayr-
el-Medeenet,” situated on a hill behind the Memnonium. Close by
are the Priests’ Tombs, the largest of which may be visited
‘ by those who are not easily frightened by bats and rather
rough and dangerous passages.

After making a second stay at the Memnonium, the return to
Luxor is effected. If still early, a walk through Luxor and an
exploration of the Temple, mostly hidden by Arab dwellings
and stables, will ﬁnish the day.

ELEVENTH DAY.

At Luxor. The day will be entirely devoted to Karnak. Lunch
may be taken out, or passengers may return on board to that
