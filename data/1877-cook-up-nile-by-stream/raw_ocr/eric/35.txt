LUXOR HOTEL,

LUXOR. UPPER EGYPT.

 

 

THE improvements that have been effected in the service of the Nile steamers
during the last few ears, since the time that we were ﬁrst honoured with the
exclusive agency of t e same by the Khedive Administration (eight years ago),
have made our “ Nile Trips” a real success.

The latest improvement, and by no means the least important, is the erection
at Luxor of an hotel which will work in connection with the steamers, the want
of which, owing to the increasing trafﬁc on the Nile, has been generally felt by
the travelling public.

Previous to this new arrangement, no accommodation of any sort was to be
had anywhere on the Nile, and travellers intending to sta a month or more in
Upper Egy t had to incur the cost and inconvenience of hiring a Dahabeah, a
slow and te ious mode of conveyance.

The Luxor Hotel will be opened at the commencement of this season, and our
tickets will allow passengers to break their journey at Luxor on their way up
or down the Nile, thus affording opportunities for the antiquarian to visit
Karnac and Thebes, and to devote the time necessary for thoroughly examining
these most interesting places.

Invalids intending to make the Nile their stay for the winter, will now be
able to do so with more comfort than heretofore, and will have the services of
an English doctor, whom we have engaged to remain at Luxor for the season.

Arrangements for a stay at Luxor Hotel can be made at our ofﬁce in Cairo
(The Pavilion, Shepheard’s Hotel) previous to starting.
