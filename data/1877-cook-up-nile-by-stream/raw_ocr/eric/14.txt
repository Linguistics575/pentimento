UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 15

correct in every respect except in the statements concerning
trafﬁc on the N ile—it would be desirable, and greatly to the
interest of all travellers, that there should be one soon. In his
statements concerning the Nile Steamers there is a slight error,
as the real fare is exactly one half of that mentioned—but then
it must be considered that the author was one of the Viceroy’s
invités in 1869, and had a “ free passage,” and that no one can
or will give any positive and reliable information in this country.

“The Land of the Nile ; or, Egypt Past and Present,” by W.
H. Davenport Adams, price 2s. 6d., is one of the latest additions
to literature of this description. The country is well described,
and the author has successfully attempted to combine a large
amount of useful information with an agreeable style. The
engravings are well executed, but we observe that in the maps on
pages 11 and 322 the railway is shown direct between Suez and
Cairo, whereas that line has been abandoned for some years.
The “ sacred ” ibis is stated, on page 29, to be as common now
as of old, whereas this description of ibis is a veritable mm av-z's
in terﬂ'z‘.

“The Attractions of the Nile,” by the Rev. A. C. Smith, is
written in a readable and interesting style.

DEPARTURE FROM CAIRO, AND DAILY
ITINERARY. '

Having secured a passage and paid for the Ticket, the pre-
parations are soon completed; passengers have but to go on
board at the appointed time with their luggage. Small change
in 00pper—about ten francs a head—ought to be procured in
Cairo, and linen enough packed up to last for three weeks, no
washing being done on board or by the way. For a small
gratuity the sailors will wash small things, such as socks and
handkerchiefs, but no ironing is done.

During the month of December Steamers leave Cairo
(Boulak) regularly every fortnight, and from January to March-
every week. (See “ Movements of the Nile Steamers ” at
