UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 19

SIXTH DAY.

If necessary, the ship is coaled at Soohag, and Girgeh is
generally reached in the evening ; there is nothing of interest in
' this place—one of the dirtiest on the Nile. Girgeh, or Bellianah,
a small town about ten miles higher up, is the starting-point for
visiting Abydos. This visit, however, is better postponed and
made on the return journey, starting from Bellianah. These
ruins are so grand and magniﬁcent that they cannot lose any of
their charm and novelty even after Karnak has been seen.

SEVENTH DAY.

Leaving the visit to Abydos for the return journey, we reach
Keneh towards evening, and if still early enough this important
place may be visited before the night. The best porous jugs and
gargoulets for ﬁltering the Nile water are made here; Keneh is
also celebrated for its dates, and was once noted for its dancing
girls. The latter, it appears, have now removed to Luxor, a
place of greater attraction to visitors. (See special notice on
page 34 of New Hotel at Luxor.)

EIGHTH DAY.
In the morning passengers are conveyed in boats 'across the
‘ river, where donkeys are waiting to take us to the Temple of
Denderah, about an hour’s ride. This is the ﬁrst monument
of the kind met with, and the impression it produces is never to
be forgotten. It is rather puzzling at ﬁrst to ﬁnd one’s way through
the halls and through the heaps of ruins surrounding the walls,
to discover any given site. However, a little practice will soon
facilitate researchi'“ ,

If the visit to Denderah is ﬁnished by noon, the boat may
reach Luxor the same evening, and anchor Opposite the Temple
of Luxor. The portico of the temple is occupied by the ofﬁce of
Mustapha Aga, the well-known and frequently mentioned English
Consul. He speaks English ﬂuently, is always willing and ready

* M. Mariette-Bey’s “ Itinerary to Upper Egypt,” which has just been
translated into English, gives a very correct plan of Denderah, and
gmﬁs illlqul and accurate informatlon concerning the various monuments
