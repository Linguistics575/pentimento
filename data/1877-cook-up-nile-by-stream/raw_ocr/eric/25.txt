:21 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

DAILY ITINERARY.

 

S E C T I O N I I .
FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND CATARACT.

The Khedivie Administration having placed a Steamer on the
Upper Nile, to ply between Philae and Wadi-Halfa, we inaugu-
rated this new service Iast season. The experiment having
proved a . success, the Administration agreed to supply a
larger and more comfortable steamer than the one with which we
worked that service last year. The voyage to Wadi-Halfa and
back may be accomplished in 12 days, of which four and a half
are employed in sight-seeing ashore, and, after the return journey,
passengers will have to make the Upper Nile Steamer their hotel
for two or three extra days, waiting the arrival of the Lower
Nile Steamer at Assouan to take them back to Cairo. These
few days will be found anything but unpleasant by those who
delight in a soft climate and admire the beauties of nature.
Varied. scenes may be enjoyed every day, either by going
in a boat around the Island, or down the river through
the numberless rapids which precede the Cataracts, or by riding
to the neighbouring villages and the granite hills which border
the different camel paths towards Assouan. Were it only as a
resting-place, Philae would still be found delightful. Although
navigation on the Upper Nile is quite as easy and secure, if not
easier than that on the Lower Nile, it is desirable to allow—three
days’ margin in case of any unforeseen delay above the First

Cataract.

FIRST DAY.

We are at Philze, 5 miles from Assouan. Now we have left the
conﬁnes of Egypt proper, and have entered Nubia. The Steamer
by which we continue our voyage'is waiting our arrival; our
baggage has been transferred from the other steamer. The
starting takes places soon after we have got on board.
