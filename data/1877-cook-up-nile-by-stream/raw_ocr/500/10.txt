beginning at the tombs of Beni-Hassan, and futithing the trip to
the First Cataract, at Philaa. By thus visiting the temple of
Dendarah, and other minor monuments, before Thebes, they lose
nothing of their grandeur, and produce their full impression.
The time allowed and fixed for sight-seeing is quite adequate
and suffieient, whatever may be stated to the contrary; out of
all the passengers who made the Tour on board the Steamers,
there was not one who was not thoroughly satisfied in this
respect.

A passenger by Dahabeah is conveyed up stream as fast as pos-
sible, whenever there is a favourable wind, by day or night, and
begins sight-seeing at the wrong end-on his way down; a
Steamer never travels by night, and therefore has the double
advantage that no scenery is lost and sleep is undisturbed.

Even the objection raised by travellers intending to remain
several months on the N ile for the benefit of their health (a stay
that could not hitherto be effected by going up on a steamer)
has now been removed by the arrangements we have made for
the issue of tickets allowing the journey to be broken either on
the way up or down at Thebes, where a new hotel (Luxor Hotel)
has just been opened, where invalids may make their home for
a part of the winter, and where the antiquarian will be able to
devote one or several weeks to the numberless and interesting
ruins and monuments which abound in that most attractive part
of the Nile, and also enjoy the benefit of this mild and genial
climate.

Nearly every week in the season a Steamer is regularly des-
patched, and letters are forwarded to passengers up the N ile on
board the other Steamers l the returning boats receive letters to
be posted from the up boats, and they always stop together for
half-an-hour on meeting each other. The sailings and stoppings
of a Steamer are always fixed and can be relied upon, so that
telegraphic messages can be received and forwarded nearly every
day through our Office in Cairo. The calculation of time employed
is easy and certain, and the date of return can be fixed before-
hand, so that ulterior travelling arrangements can be made with
