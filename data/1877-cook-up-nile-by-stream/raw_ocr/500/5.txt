late years, and is getting more and more fashionable every season,
that very soon no American out on a " European Tour " will dare
to return home and face his friends if he has not done the
at Orient " ' and the " continental lions " are becoming so tame
and easy of access to every one, that no English Tourist who can
command the time and money will be tsatisfied unless he has gone

Guide-books and diaries of Tourists (who all feel bound, after
a single short visit, to benefit intending travellers by publishing

of personal observation during eight seasons, have been written,
and it is sincerely hoped that their perusal will disperse many
false and exaggerated notions, and smooth the way for intending
Tourists.

DAHABEAHS AND STEAMERS.

Nothing has probably been so fully described and praised to
exhaustion as the famous " Dahabeah",o and the idyllic charms of
