14 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

The principal thing one must not forget is money, travelling
in the East and Hotel accommodation being very expensive.
English circnlar and bank notes generally lose 1 to 2 per cent.
in exchange for gold; other notes are not current, nor can any
payment be made except in specie.

GUIDE-BOOKS.

These notes are not designed to supersede any of the existing
guide-books, their only object being to give such special
information as is generally wanted and Wished for by intending
Steamboat passengers. A few words may be added here con
cerning this subject. .

" Cooes HANDBOOK FOR EGYPT AND THE NILE " is one of the
most recent, most complete, and most readable Handbooks
published. Price 6s. With Five Maps.

" The Land of the Pharaohs: Egypt and Sinai " ; is a hand-.
some work, by Dr. Manning, and published by the Religious
Tract Society. Ji, is profusely illustrated with Pen and Pencil
sketches, and will serve as a souvenir for visitors to these ancient
regions. It is handsomely bound, gilt edges, price 88.

" Itineraire de la Haute Egypte," by Mariette Bey, is a
practical description of the Nile monuments between Cairo and
Assouan, and, emanating from official sources, is a valuable com-
panion on a Tour to the First Cataract.

" The Nile without a Dragoman," by Frederic Eden, records,
the authorâ€™s experience of a Dahabeah trip to the Second Cataract..
It is written in a readable style, but is scarcely practical enough
for a guide-book. The price is 10s. 6d.

Bo many iscientifie and sensational works have been published
about this wonderful country that a choice is very diffitmlt. To,
any one desirous of getting really valuable and sound information
o-HI thing nearly impossible to obtain in Egypt-we can recom-
mend no better book than Heinrich Stephan's " Das Heutige
Egypten." (F. A. Broekhams, Leipzig 1872.) If there is no
English translation published yet of this remarkable work--
