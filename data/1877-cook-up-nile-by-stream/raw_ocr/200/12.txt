UP TUE NILE BY STEAM. 13

felt is daring the three days’ stay at Luxor, the excursion to the
Kings' Tombs, and, when at Assouau, to Philae ; still, as a rule,
any person accustomed to open-air exercise can easily support it,
and the week spent on board the Steamer, before arriving at these
places, is a capital preparation. Mosquitoes need not be feared,
as they disappear from the cabins as soon as the Steamer moves.

All excess in eating and drinking must of course be carefully
avoided; the regular meals served in Hotels and on board the
Steamers are all that is required. Coffee prepared in the Turkish
fashion is served after all meals, and this delicious beverage can
be had everywhere and at any time. Four meals a day are given
on board the Steamers, viz., breakfast, lunch, dinner, and tea.

Great caution must be taken not to sleep with open windows,
and not to lie exposed to the chilly night air. Very often severe
diarrhcea results from carelessness in this respect. Instead of
imitating the Arabs in wearing the " fez "-a most unhealthy
praetiee--it would be much better to imitate them in wearing
warm cloth round the stomach. The best time to visit Egypt
and the Nile is from November to the end of March. From all
parts of Europe Railways lead to Venice, Trieste, Genoa, Naples,
Brindisi, and Marseilles. The Peninsular and Oriental Steamers
leave Venice every Friday, and Brindisi on Monday morning.
The passage from Brindisi to Alexandria takes three days and a
half. The Austrian Lloyd's Steamers leave Trieste on Friday
at midnight, stopping at Corfu for a few hours, and accomplishing
the passage in five days. Both these lines are universally known
for their splendid boats and the excellent firsb.eiass accommoda-
tion they afford. The price of passage is the same--212 sterling
First Class, and so sterling Second Class-from Trieste, Venice,
OI? Brindisi.

Full information respecting routes, fares, &c., can be obtained
at the Tourist Offiees of THOMAS COOK & SON.

From Alexandria there is a Railway to Cairo; three trains run
each day, in four hours by Express and six hours by Ordinary
Trains. Tickets to be obtained in London, Alexandria, and
Cairo.
