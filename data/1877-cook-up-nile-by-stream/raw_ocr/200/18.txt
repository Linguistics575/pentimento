UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 17

DAILY ITINERARY.

 

SECTION I.

FIRST DAY.

The surting-plaee is now from above the new iron bridge
''Kaer-el-Nil," which leads to the Pyramids of Ghizeh. The
Steamer generally leaves at 3 p.m., and arrives same evening at
Badraehin (railway station, and etarting-point to visit the site

back at about noon to the Steamer, which starts immediately.
In the afternoon we pass on our right the curtailed Pyramid,

generally stops for the night, unless the night be clear and moon-
lit, in Which case the Steamer continues its course for some time.

THIRD DAY.
We start early in the morning, in order to pass, before night-
fall, the mountain " Gebel-el-Dayr,” on the top of which stands a
Coptic convent, whose inmates used formerly to plunge into
