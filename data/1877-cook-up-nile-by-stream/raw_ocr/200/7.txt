8 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

Even the most enthusiastic admirer of this majestic river must
confess that the scenery on its banks is very tame and soon
becomes monotonous. On board a steamer there is continual
change, and every turn brings new features, new sights
in view. A Dahabeah, when beealmed, may be detained in the
same spot for a whole week ; or, if the passengers insist, as they
must do if they want to move on, and there is no head wind, the
crew will work away and haul the boat up stream-a very painful
sight, and really galley-work. Look at those poor fellows yoked
together with a rope round their breasts, toiling along with out-
stretched and swollen necks, and listen to their painful song as
they work, slowly advancing, by short steps, at the rate of from
five to six miles per day l. Floating down river, if contrary winds
prevail, Dahabeahs are no better off. Arabs can do nothing
without singing most piteously ; their songs, which are described
fully in every guide-book, may amuse you for a whole day, but
become, from constant repetition, quite unbearable.

The Nile Steamers formerly carried from twelve to twenty
passengers. During the last three seasons larger Steamers have
been added to the service, replete with every convenience, acquired
from the experience of previous years: the smaller Steamer now
accommodating twenty passengers and the larger forty-five. If
the passengers are all well-educated people, behaving to each other
with due regard, there can be nothing more pleasant ; many be..
come fast friends, and each individual contributes, by his acquired
knowledge and reading, to the general amusement and instruc-
tion, as very often men of great learning take advantage of the
steamers.

The best means to enjoy this Tour thoroughly and amid all
unpleasantness is undoubtedly for a party of friends who know
each other-or, if not friends, at least parties of the same-
nationality-to hire a small special Steamer to themselves, as, by
paying thirteen or fourteen firiWelass fares, they can always be
accommodated.

Dissensions and incompatibility of temper are less strongly felt,
and of less consequence, on board a Steamboat-being a public
