28 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

EIGHTH DAY.

The excursion to Aboo-Seer is better made very early-in the
morning, as it is quite two hours' ride on the opposite bank of
the river, where donkeys have already been passed by ferry-boat
in readiness for us.

The Soudan Railway, now in construction, will next season
have completed 103 kilometres of track, and by special favour
the Administration will place at our disposal an engine and
carriage every time that our passengers may be willing to make
the journey over the upper part of the Second Cataract, visiting
also the waterfalls of Ambigole, a point more interesting still
than both the First and Second Cataracts. Of course the
cost of such a ride must be defrayed by the passengers.

NINTH, TENTH, AND ELEVENTH DAYS.
Begin the return j ourney, Which is continued without stoppages
of importance.
Arrive at Phila: in the evening of the 11th day, or in the
morning of the 12th.

TWELFTH DAY.
Visit to the, Cataract in a boat, and the remaining two days

to be spent at leisure, until we effect our change on the down

river steamer at Assouan, and continue to Cairo as per First
Cataract itinerary.



RETURN VOYAGE.

When, on the down journey, the boat stops in any place which
is not marked in the itinerary as a regular stopping-place, or
touches twice at the same station, passengers who want donkeys
to visit these places a second time must pay for the donkeys
themselves; the same applies to night excursions, visiting
Karnak, or any other place, by moonlight, or going to Fantasies.
