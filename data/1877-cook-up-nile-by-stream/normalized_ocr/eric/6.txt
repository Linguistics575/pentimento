UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 7

life in one of these boats, floating up and down the Nile, have
been sung in every imaginable strain. N o doubt, for invalids
or families wishing to spend the winter on the Nile, for friends
on a shooting excursion, or for a young couple in their honeymoon
---in fact, for any one who can easily shut himself out from
: all communication with the civilised world and has got the
temper to lie idle for weeks and months, looking every day on
: the same uniform scenery, nothing can be more delicious;
besides, it is "the fashion."

Such small drawbacks as sudden severe illness, accidents from
rfire-arms, and consequent helplessness of the travellers--no
medical aid being obtainable--even deaths on board, occurring
every season, are never even mentioned. During every season
such incidents occur, and frequently the Steamers are hailed for
medical assistance from the ship's doctor, or to take in
tow Dahabeahs wanting to return as fast as possible to Cairo.
'Towing of any craft is strictly prohibited, and these applica-
tions have all to be declined, except under exceptional cir-
~cumstances.

Dahabeah passengers cannot even reckon on the medical
services of the doctors on board the Steamers; although
willing to render. assistance whenever possible, it is not
.always practicable for Steamers to stop when hailed at
.any intermediate point without disadvantage to the prescribed
Itinerary.

Accidents on Dahabeahs are constantly occurring, and adverse
\winds in going up or down tend greatly to retard their progress
.and promote the discomfort of their passengers.

The sad circumstance which occurred in the spring of 187 6--
-the overturning of a Dahabeah and the drowning of some
members of the family of Mr. Russell Gurney--made a painful
: impression upon the English public. If the truth were told of
.the disasters, delays, and deaths in connection with Dahabeahs
that went up the river last season, Egyptian visitors would be

'very cautious how they committed themselves to the dangerous
.and dilatory service.
