UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 9

means of conveyance, where every passenger can keep aloof from
or mix with Whom he likes-than on board a Dahabeah, where
they all must form one family paiity, living day and night
in close proximity, and where continual frictions are unavoidable.
We repeat, it is very bad when misunderstanding arises between
the passengers on board a Steamer, but it is ten times worse in a
Dahabeah; and why, if a eonfidential party is not formed from the
very beginning, run the risk of spending three miserable months
with disagreeable travelling companions instead of so many
- weeks?

Mutual forbearance, a little m1selfiishnesis, and easy temper can
give great charms to this highly interesting Tour; and any one
travelling in the East, and especially on the Nile, ought to
remember the country and place he is in-that it is utterly
impossible to get everything as easily as in a civilised country'

The expenses of the Steamboat Administration, and the diffiealty
of supplying coal and various kinds of provisions, are very serious.
The matériel actually disposable for the passenger tradie on the
Nile is certainly not what it could and ought to be; bat then we
ought to be thankful even for this, and consider that the,
Egyptian Government keep up these passenger Steamers at a.
great pecuniary loss, and only for the sake and benefit of European
Tourists.

Besides, the Khédive is improving this service gradually by
adding to the number and the comfort of the Steamers. The
excellent cooking-ranges introduced on the Steamers in 1873 have
rendered the eornmiissariat department all that can be desired.
Passengers may consider the rate of £47 sterling excessive, but
they should consider that it includes everything-living, sight,
seeing, guides, donkeys, and saddles (English saddles for ladies)
-that coal is very expensive upon the N ile, and that the servants
and crew in these small Steamers often outnumber the paying
passengers. No private enterprise could possibly work these
