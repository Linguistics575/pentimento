UP TRE NILE BY STEAM. 25

An hour and a half's course brings us to Debod or Dabtod, a
small village on the west side of the river. Here is a ruin, in a
good state of preservation, of. a temple commenced by the
Ethiopian King Ashar-Amun. The Steamer stops here for the
night, and, according to the time of arrival, the excursion is made
the same day or the following morning.

SECOND DAY.

The distances between the places of interest on the Upper Nile
are very short, and with a few exceptions they all lie within afew

_g____ minutes from the Steamer, so that although ample time is allowed
Fall, for sight-seeing, several may be visited in the same day.

"iiil - In two hours we reach Kardash or (1ertissee, 15 miles from
lt-lil, t Debod, which possesses the remnant of a temple and a. quarry.

In a few hours more we pass the narrow part of the N ile called
l _ "Bab-el-Kalabsheh," or Strait of Kalabsheh. For a distance
of four or five miles the granite mountains inclose the river on
either side, offering at every curve varied views of most grand
and wild scenery. We get into the broad stream again, and
Kalabsheh (14 miles from Kardash) is soon reached. The Steamer
stops here four hours, and passengers visit the ruins, which are of
some size and beauty, and consist of the remains of two temples;
one, the largest temple in Nubia, must have been, when perfect, a
magnificent pile. In some chambers, to which access can be
gained, are paintings of the highest finish, in colours as vivid
as on the day on which they were executed. The smaller temple,
called "Bayt-el-Welly," or "House of the Saint," lies against a
rocky hill to the right, and is partly cut out of the rock. Although
difficult of access, it is worth while to attempt the ascent, as the
temple contains excellent paintings, and the sculptures, recording
the battles of Rameses, are perfect.

THIRD DAY.

We pass and visit iu1ecessively Dendoor, 12 miles from Kalah-
eheh, and Kirsel1el1, ten miles farther, which have cavern temples of
some magnitude.
