UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 27

for a walk through the struggling streets of the town, which, like
all other towns and villages in Nubia, consists of mud huts
thatched with reed and palm leaves. It contains also a temple
which may be visited, although it is not in a good state of
preservation.

The same day brings us to Ibrim, or Ibreem, 15 miles from
Derr. In addition to two little temples or tombs, cut out in the
rock, there is a castle Milt by the Romans, whence a fine
view is to be had of the Nile and the surrounding hills.

SIXTH DAY.

Arrive at Ipsambool, or Aboo-Simbel (32 miles). This monu-
ment is the greatest attraction Nubia has to offer to the
antiquarian student. It is hewn in the solid rock, and is rendered
specially imposing by four gigantic figures of Rameses IL, each
66 feet high. The temple is partly choked with sand, and some-
what difficult of access, bat the interior: well repays the exertion.
It is divided into four compartments, and is 185 feet deep.
The paintings and seulpt11res exceed in beauty and grandeur any
which the tourist has hitherto seen on the Nile. The smaller
temple, 84 feet in depth, is dedicated to Athor; the fapade is
orhamented with six colossal statues of Rameses, his wife, and
children. A whole day is devoted to the examination of these
temples.

SEVENTH DAY,

Arrive at Widy-Halrah (40 miles from Aboo-Simbel, and about
210 miles from Philze), the terminal point of the voyage. The
Second Cataract is 7 or 8 miles farther south, and consists of
rapids, which, extending for about 5 miles, thoroughly impede
the navigation of the river; indeed, for nearly 100 miles the
bed of the river is a succession of sunken rocks. A good view of
the Second Cataract and the surrounding country is obtained by
ascending the cliif called Aboo-Seer, and to afford the opportunity
of doing so the Steamer remains at Wztdy-Halfah a whole day
before returning.
