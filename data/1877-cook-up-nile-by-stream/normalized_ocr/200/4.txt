INTRODUCTION.

IN the autumn of 1872 a pamphlet was published with the above
title. The edition then printed, together with other editions
published every year, being exhausted, it is deemed advisable to
present the information to the public in a similar and equally
concise form. The 1872 edition contained, in addition to a
description of the journey "Op the Nile" and the numerous
places and objects of interest upon the banks, a full programme
of the Eastern arrangements of the firm under whose auspices this
book is prepared, together with expensive maps of the Levant,
Palestine, & c., and one shilling was the published price. In
arranging this New Edition of the same work it has been
considered advisable to exclude all extraneous matter, and to
make the contents thoroughly practical and general. By adopt-
ing this plan, and by retaining but two 1m1p8--ar1 excellent one
of the Nile, and another of the routes to the East, engraved by
E W. and A. K. J ohnston, of Edinburgh-the publishers are enabled
to offer the book in a pamphlet form at half its former price. The
. arrangements of THOMAS COOK & SON for travel in Egypt,
Palestine, & c., are most comprehensive, and full information
thereon will be gladly supplied on application at any of the
Tourist Offiees enumerated upon the title-page.
