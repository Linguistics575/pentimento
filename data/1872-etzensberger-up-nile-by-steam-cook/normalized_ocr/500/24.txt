UP TIIE NILE BY STEAM. 21

English Gently, is always willing and ready to oblige, and
at once sends his servant on board to welcome new arrivals
and invite them to his house, where coffee is always ready,
and Fantasies may be organised.

(l/h day-Ai; Luxor. The first; day is generally devoted
to a visit to the Kings' Tombs. Starting early in the
morning across the stream by boat, where donkeys have
already been conveyed by the same means, in about an
hour we arrive at the Temple-palace of Kournah, and after

or three of the most interesting, are entered, which is quite
offieient-Belzoni'g Tomb, No, 17, and Bruce's, No. ll.
After lunch, which has been brought along and is taken
in the entrance of Tomb No. 6, those who like to walk can
go over the mountain chain, and come down near the
Memmonium or Rameenm; the others return by the same

On the way back to Luxor the ruins of the Temple of
Amunoph II. and the sitting Colessi are visited.

partly over the same ground as the day before; we visit
the Temple-palaee of Medinet Haboo leisurely, and after
lunch make an excursion to one of the most interesting
private Tombs, No. 35, called "Dayr-el-hfedinet;," situated
on a. hill behind the Memmonium. Close by are the Priesia'
Tombs, the largest of which may be visited (although it is
scarcely worth the trouble) by those who are not easily
frightened by bats and rather rough and dangerous par-
sages.

A second stay is made afterwards at the Memmonium,
