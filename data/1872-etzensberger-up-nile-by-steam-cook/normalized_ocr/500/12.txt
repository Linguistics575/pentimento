UP TIIE NILE BY STEAM. 11

dispatched, and letters are forwarded to passengers up the
Nile on board the other Steamers; the returning boats
receive letters to be posted from the up boats, and they
always stop together for half an hour on meeting each
other. The sailings and stoppingp of a Steamer are always
fixed and can be relied upon, so that telegraphic messages
can be received and forwarded nearly every day through
our Offiee in Cairo. The calculation of time employed is
easy and certain, and the date of return can be fixed before-
hand, so that ulterior travelling, arrangements can be made
with safety. In a Dahabeah, one may return in six weeks
or three months, according to wind and other circum-
stances; the defective postal arrangements make it very
difficult, or rather impossible, to receive or dispatch letters.
The only place where letters can be addressed to up the
Nile is at; the English Comml's, MUSTAPHA AGAR, at
Luxor; there the letters and papers lie about on a table
or in an open box, so that every one can help himself at
pleasure.

Having thus compared the two systems, and shown their
respective advantages and defects, we now proceed to give
some general information and advice to travellers, suggested
by personal experience.

OUTFIT AND CHOICE OF ROUTES.

In direct opposition to all existing guide books and their
stereotyped instructions, cautioning travellers to encumber

would travel and are accustomed to travel anywhere else in
