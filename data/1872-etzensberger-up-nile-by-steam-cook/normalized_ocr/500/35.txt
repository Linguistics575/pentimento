98, FLEET STREET, LONDON,

Having again been appointed exclusive Agents for the
Passenger Steamers 011 the Nile belonging to the Kh√©dive
Administration, have the honour to inform the public that
their representative for Italy and Egypt,

MR. R. ETZENSBERGER, OF VENICE,

Who is at the same time in charge of the berth and yietual-
ling department on board these Steamers, will again act on
their behalf during this season, and may be consulted at
fhepheard's Hotel, Cairo, any day from Nov. 10th, 1872, to
end of March, 1873. Regular fortnightly departures from
Cairo (Boulak) to Phila, and back by Steamboat will take
place, as per Programme, from Tuesday, December 10th,
and every alternate Tuesday at 3 p.m., until the firtst week
in March, 1873. They also are'enabled and authorised to
book passengers through from London and Paris or other
central places in Europe, to Egypt, by any of the Railway
and Steam boat Lines. Tickets available by all the Egyptian
Railways and Steamers on the Suez Canal are also sold
at their C) ffiee in Cairo (Shepheard's Hotel), and will
be found to save a great deal of trouble and loss to
passengers in Egypt. During next season a proposal
to create a Circular Ticket at reduced Fares, will be
made to the General Administration of Egyptian Rail-
ways; and it is hoped that a considerable reduction
will be obtained for a Circular Tour from Cairo to Suez,
