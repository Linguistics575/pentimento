In Palestine we have hitherto braved every storm and
completed our Programme, while others have lost im-
portant portions of the Tours, or had to return to the coast
and work round to some other point by Ma. Were we to be
overcome by diffieulties of weather, or any other t1ncontrol-
able circumstance, the Travellers must feel their obligation

between the Dragoman and any of his party on any point
affecting the contract, a clause in our Agreement provides
that the matter shall be referred to the nearest British
Consul, whose decision shall be accepted by both parties.
We have stated in detail the provision we make for our
Travellers in return for their money, and beyond that we
cannot hold ourselves responsible.
