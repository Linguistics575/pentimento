FOR THE EAST. 43

this port of doubtful repute, in never having lost a landing
"emberkation. Nine times have I passed through the
narrow opening of the old grim rocks which encircle the
pert, with011t the slightest diifieulty.

In four seasons I 23have introduced large double parties,
in eight distinct or united eneamprnenti, with the super-
addition of several select camps of from three to six per-
sons, presenting an aggregate of about 250 Tourists, nearly
all of whom have traversed the beaten tracks of the country
under my arrangements, and most of them under personal
supervision. It is singular how nearly the numbers of
each year have accorded, never varying five in their totals.
These "educational courses" present some very hard and
difficult lessons, and all students are not alike docile and
pe1eeptive; but it has been my constant study to adapt my
plans to the constitutional characteristics of the country,
and to the oyir, encies of its peculiar difficulties of Income-

Hebron, in the south, to Dan, at the northern extremity of
Palestine proper, and Baalbec, at the other point of the
Lebanon,

On several occasions of storm and obstruction we have
left select parties in the mountain fastnesses, whilst our
indomitable Dragem 11113 and unyielding camp servants have
pushed forward and gained every end contemplated.

Some have thought our numbers were too large to be
comfortable, but this has been a mistaken opinion. There
would be no more difficulty in managing fifty than five,
providing there is a proportionate provision of animals,
tents, and servants.

But there is no compulsion to go in large numbers
under 0111' arrangements: we can provide for the most
select as well as the most numerous, and our small parties
of three, four, and six, in the last season, gave honourable
