UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 27

birthday-one of our passenger ships was passing in front
of a governor's palace; a salute was fired from shore in
honour of the day, and the concussion produced by the
discharge, which was directed on the ship, broke about a
dozen windows. The passengers insisted on having the
windows replaced, on account of the draught; the captain
refused to have it done, and at last the Dragoman in charge
had to do it at our expense. When the ship returned the
case was laid before the Bey; but he merely shrugged his
shoulders and said he could not pay the damages (20 frs.),
as he had not fired. Such instances happen very frequently,
and the only remedy is patience. The doctors who accom-
pany pastenger ships are young Arabs or Copts, educated
partly at the Tieeroy's expense, and frequently have pursued
their studies in Paris; being, With rare exceptions, very
pleasant, well-educated people, speaking French, or a little
English, it is well to be on good terms with them; their
occupation on board being nil, they are always ready for a
"lurk" in the evening, and it is well to be in their com-
puny.

Should any passenger desire to return to Cairo a. day or
two sooner, he can be put down at any of the railway
stations between Roda and Ghizeh; but as there is only
one train a day, he must be very careful not to miss it, or
he might go without bed and food.

We here add a copy of the general bill of regulations
and list of stopping places; the best course is not to
interfere nor propose any change whatever in this itinerary
based on experience. Some people will do so, and thus
cause disorder and sometimes displeasure.
