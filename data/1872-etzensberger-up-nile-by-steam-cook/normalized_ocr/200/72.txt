UNDER THE MANAGEMENT AND PERSONAL DIRECTION OF

THOMAS COOK AND SON,

AND ASSISTANTS.

THE PRINCIPAL ROUTES, CONDITIONS, and CHARGES of
COOK'S Am ERICAN, EASTERN, and CONTINENTAL TOURS, are
set forth in detailed Programmes, already published, and
which will be attached to these Supplementary Programmes
of dates and additional particulars of Personal Supervision
of the arrangements of the approaching season. It will have

accompanied by a party of English and American Tourists,
who expect, in the month of February, to meet other parties
from Enghnd and the Continent, in Egypt, and to
