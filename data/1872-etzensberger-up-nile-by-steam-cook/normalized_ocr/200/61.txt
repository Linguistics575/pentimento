56 TOURIST PROGRAMMES

accomplished from London, Liverpool, New York, Chicago,
or San Francisco, and back to the same starting point,
including Hotel Provision for sixty days on land, exclusive
of the month in Palestine, and ten days at Constantinople
and Athens, for

FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS; or 2000 DOLLARS,
GOLD.

These Fares will be shown in more minute detail when
the American arrangements are quite settled; at present they
are only quoted approximately, except so far as relates to
the Round the World Tour, which is accepted by several in
America as an absolute contract, on the basis of Which they
have engaged to accompany Mr. Cook from New York or
Chicago to San Francisco, J apan, China, India, Egypt;,
Palestine, Turkey, Greece, Italy, France, London, Liverpool,
and back to their starting point, Mr. J enkins providing for
them on arrival at New York.

ITINERARY OF EGYPT AND PALESTINE
TOURS.

Taking the first Nile and Palestine Tour as an example
of the Routes to be traversed, and the time required, it will
be easy to ascertain when and where a Tour Without the N ile
may commence and terminate. But it is not necessary to
follow the beaten tracks here described, in every instance.
Private and independent parties can settle with the
Dragoman the course they wish to take. It is, however, _
necessary for larger parties, travelling under united arrange-
ments, to have their course distinctly defined, and to adhere
to it as strictly as possible. Absolute fixtures are apositive
necessity for the comfort of large parties.

THE FIRST PERsONALLg-CfONDTrCTED PARTY
for 1873 will leave LONDON January 22nd,
PARIS January 24th;

The Second Tour commencing three weeks later. For each of
these departures, a Personal Conductor will be engaged to
accompany the parties as far as necessary, Mr. COOK meeting
them at Alexandria or Cairo.
