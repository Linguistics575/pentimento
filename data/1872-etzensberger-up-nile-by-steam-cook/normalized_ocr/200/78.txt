It is not necessary to repeat all details of arrangements
for this Tour as they correspond exactly with those of the
First Tour, after leaving Cairo, and the same special
provisions can be made for either going or returning. The
name of the Conductor of the Party cannot yet be given;
but in all probability more than one may be fengaged for
different parts of the Tour. It is not improbable that Mr.

First Party to J erusalem. ALEXANDER HOWARD, the
responsible Dragoman for Palestine, engages to discharge all
obligations, under a legal and binding contract made with
Messrs. COOK & SON.
