THOMAS COOK AND SON,

IN THE WINTER. OF 1872 AND SPRING OF 1873.

OUR FIRST AUTUMNAL PARTY of 1872 having left for
GREECE, TURKEY, PALESTINE and EGYPT, and a SECOND
PARTY been duly provided for, the present Series of Pro-
grammes have special reference to the arrangements for the
Nile in Winter, and the Spring Tours to Egypt, Palestine,
Asia Minor, Constantinople, Athens, Italy, tee.

These Programmes will indicate a wider scope of arrange-
ment than any previously issued, embracing not only the
ordinary Routes from England and the Continent, in an
Easterly direction, but also including arrangements which
encircle the globe, and offering facilities to citizens of the
United States and the people of Canada to visit the lands
of the Bible by taking a Western or Eastern course.
