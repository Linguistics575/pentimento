'lllll UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

DAEABEAHS AND BTEAMERS.

NOTHING has probably been so fully described and praised we"
to exhaustion as the famous "Dahabeah "," and the idyllic
charms of life in one of these boats, floating, up and down
the Nile, have been sung in every imaginable strain. No
doubt, for a party of very dear friends on a shooting ex-
cursion, a young couple in their honeymoon, iuvalids in
search of health, young swells who have nothing at all to
do on earth but kill time and throw away their money-in
fact, for any one who can easily shut himself oat from all
communication with the civilized world, and has got the
temper to lie idle for weeks and months, looking every day
on the same uniformly desolate scenery, nothing can be
more delicious: besides, it is "the Fashion." Who would
dare to confess, in good society, to having been up the Nile,
except by Duhabeah?

Such small drawbacks es sudden severe illness, accidents
from fire-arms, and consequent helplessness of the tra-
vellerts-no medical aid being obtainable-even deaths on
board, occurring every season, are never even mentioned;
