RETURNING TO CAIRO, the route from thence to ISMAILIA

and the Trip by Railway is usually made on Friday, to be in
_w readiness on Saturday morning for the Steamer on the Suez

'il Canal to PORT SAID, where the Mail Steamer arrives at
glllllM about 3 p.m. We usually dine at the Hotel (10 France,
Eww Port Said, and then go on board the Austrian Lloyd's
'alll Steamer for JAFFA, where we are due early on Sunday
lrallltt morning. We hope to be there on the first Sunday in
"lllllll March, and to find tents pitched in readiness for departure
rcaNll' on the following day.

Sunday is our FIRST DAY in Palestine, and is spent in
searching out historical places, generally beginning with the
"house of one Simon, "tanner," beautifully situated hy the
sea-side. There are other sites less marked and more
questionable than that of Simon's house. The orange groves
attract all visitors, and it is also pleasant on some part
of the Lord's Day, to have a religious service, which is
usually held 111 the Ili/di room of the devoted teacher, Miss
Arnott, who for more than ten years has been actively
engagedin her laudable work.
