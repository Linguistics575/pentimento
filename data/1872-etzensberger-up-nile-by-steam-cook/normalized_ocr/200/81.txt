JlET,1'-B () () K FOR, TRAVELLERS
TO T3 l EAST,

INCLI'DINO

EGYPT, PALESTINE, TURKEY, GREECE, AND ITALY.
By the REV. JABEZ BURNS, D.D., la.D.













With Tourist Arrangements by THOMAS Cook, and specially designed Maps
by KEITH JOHNSTON.

TO BE BAD THROUGH ALL BOOKSELLEBS, AND OP THOMAS COOK & BON,
98, FLEET STREET, LONDON.



The general principles, routes, and modes of travel, with other details of Pales-
tine arrangements, are set forth with considerable distinctness and accuracy in
the "Help-Book for Eastern Travellers," compiled conjointly by Dr. J Ann: BURNS
and Mr. Coos, after their Erst journey together to the East, and as that work is
much cheaper than most books relating to Eastern Travel, we rccnmmend iuquirers
to obtain and peruse it.
