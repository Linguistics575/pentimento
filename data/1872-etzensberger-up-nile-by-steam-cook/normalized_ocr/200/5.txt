4 PREFACE.

"frightened and deterred from venturing on such an awful
expedition.

Of course all these publications are only destined for those
"ttill few who can afford the time and money to hire a Dahabeah'

- and idle away three months; nobody ever thought it worth

while to bestow a thought on the great majority of tra-
vellers who cannot afford both, and prefer steaming up the
Nile. It is for this great majority, representing at least
- nine-tenths of the actually travelling public, that these
pages, the result of personal observation during two seasons,
have been written, and it is sincerely hoped that their
perusal will disperse many false and exaggerated notions,
and smooth the way for intending Tourists.
