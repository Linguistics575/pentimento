'6 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

unfortunate parties return, and heard their tale of woe,
know better. During last season, 1871-2, several sad in..

for medical assistance from the ship's doctor, or to take in

It very frequently happens that a party for a Dahabeah
is only made up in Cairo, between people who never knew
