FOR THE EAST. 41

sorry to be in any way identified with such defalcations as
were voluntarily reported to me on my last visit to Jaffa.
A Vienna contractor once wrote me proposals for partner-
_. ship Tours to the East. I replied that I always preferred
=T==i==T7T= to do my own work, in my own way, and to bear my own
responsibilities. The next I heard of the poor fellow was
____... that he had sent a Courier with a. party to Palestine. On
---- - - the way his funds were exhausted. He wrote to his
7 lt employer for money to enable him to proceed, but instead
- of sending "the needful tr to rescue his representative, the

- unfortunate speeulator terminated by poison the lives of
______: himself, wife, and two or three children. Only the other
--------- - day a Travelling Agent from Vienna came to 98, Fleet
' Street, to beg for employment, stating that he had been
engaged, by somebody of Vienna, to conduct a party of

four gentlemen round the world, but his funds were ex-

hausted on arrival in London, and he could not get means

to go forward. The case was represented to the Austrian

Consul, but nothing could be done with it, and the gentle-

men had to stop short in their proposed Tour. A proposal

-= which we now have from Vienna, representing 10 to 20



.na

fr" candidates for a Round-the-World Tour, looks very sus-
Ei T piciously, and we shall most certainly persevere in our own

work and bear our own burdens. We neither wish to copy,

v-v nor be copied. I have been led into this digression by

.1-.. circumstances connected with Eastern Tours; but enough
.7raiiiii" of it--I return to my story.

TOURS OF FOUR SEASONS TO THE NILE,
PALESTINE, tue,

It is not necessary to particularize the details of the
whole of these Tours. Their totals present an aggregate
of nearly 400 voyagers up and down the N ile, from the
Arsenal of Boulak (Cairo) to the head of the First
Cataract, including the Island of Phike, and the granite
quarries of Syene, from whence were obtained all the
monoliths and other immense granite blocks, shaped into
forms, raised to positions, and demolished in ways and by
agencies of skill and power which puzzle modern artists and
mechanicians.
