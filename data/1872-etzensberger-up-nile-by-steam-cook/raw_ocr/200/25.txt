and then back to Luxor. If still early, a walk through
Luxor and an exploration of the Temple, mostly hidden
by Arab dwellings and stables, will firiisl1 the day nicely.

Lunch may be taken out, OI' passengers may return on
board, the Temple being only about a mile and a half dis-
tant. All around Thebes visitors are continually pursued
by dealers in antiquities, mostly poor imitations; and the
Consuls themselves, who all deal in these articles, are not
much better than the rest. Be careful not to offer a shilling
for an object for which £5 is asked, for you may be sure to
get it ! .

at about 11 a.m., and after visiting its Temple we continue
our journey up stream, arriving the same evening at Edfou.

13th day.--Thrs splendid Temple, the most complete and
best preserved monument in Egypt, which gives the best

custody by a government officer, and is the on] y place where
beggars are not allowed to bother you for backsheesh j but
they are the more ravenous when you emerge again from
the stronghold. Half a day is devoted to this place, and it
can be visited either now or returning; this will depend _
entirely on the time of arrival. If the visit is postponed
and the Steamer leaves in the morning early, the quarries
of Gebel-el-Selselah come in view after about five hours' sail.
It is hardly worth while to go ashore, since the few grottoes
and chapels can just as well be seen from aboard; two
hours more bring us to the ruins of Koam-Erpbou, where
the Steamer stops. .
