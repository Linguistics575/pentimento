UP TUE NILE BY STEAM. IO

extensive sugar manufactory, employing about 2000 people.
== A visit to this establishment will well repay the trouble, and
_ visitors are very civilly shown round.
41h 'lay.-A few hours bring the boat to Beni-Hasaan,
------ the first place for sight-seeing. Swarms of beggars, and
__, ----- - miserable donkeys without saddles and bridle-the worst
- I all along the Nile-await the arrival of the Steamer, and
:2: in half an hour the Rock Tombs of Ber1r.Ilassan are
___, reached. The northern grottoes are high up on a hill to

IEaiiiilq the left, and the Specs Artimedos straight on in a valley
talll eastward-both ought to be visited. The same evening,
.9 _ or early the following day, we arrive at Siout, or Assiut,
Eg == the metropolis of Upper Egypt and residence of n
lalllll Pacha.

Il-alll 51k tlay.-Balr a day is devoted to a. Visit to the large
$2: bazaar and the hills behind the town, offering a splendid

view of the Nile valley.

b'th tlay.-Aeeording to circumstances, the ship is cooled
at Lioux, and Girgeh is generally reached in the evening;
there is nothing of interest in this place-one of the
dirtiest on the Nile. Girgeh, or Bellianah, a small town
about ten miles higher up, is the starting point for visit-
ing Abydoe. This visit, however, is better postponed and
made on the return journey, starting from Bellianah and
coming out at Abydos. These ruins are so grand and
maguificear that they cannot lose any of their charm and
novelty even after Karnak has been seen.

Tl/L tla.y.---%eaving the visit to Abydos for the return
journey, we reach Keneh towards evening, and if still early
enough, this important place may be visited before night.
