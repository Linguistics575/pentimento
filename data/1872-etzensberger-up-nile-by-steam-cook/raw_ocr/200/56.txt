The foregoing charges have especial reference to Autumnal
Arrangements, and to small Parties at any time who prefer
to go out independent of personal supervision.

For Parties starting in January or February, when the
numbers may be expected to be larger, special provision can
be made ; and for Parties of Twenty er upwards the charges
will be about S10 less than the lowest of the above scale.
To terminate all trouble or uncertainty to the Travellers
about incidentals, Messrs. Cook and Son will in future
include all, except Drinks and English Saddles, the use of
latter costing about SI for the month ; and instead of
quoting, as heretofore, the Fares at 110 Guineas; (S115 los.),
they will engage to provide for all, with the above exceptions,
for

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS.

That sum to include Omnibuses, Porterage, Luggage,
Registration, Landings and Embarkation, where necessary;
Backshee.sh to Camp Sermnts, Gratuities to Steamboat
Stewards and other Servants ' in a word, all that is neces-
sary to be paid everywhere, except, as before stated, for
Drinks and English Saddles, Which are matters of choice
and taste. Syrian Saddles are provided by the Muleteers
free of cost, but they are sometimes so inconvenient that
many prefer to pay a pound extra for an English Saddle,
and others take Saddles with them. The limit of the
weight of luggage to be paid for by the Contractors cannot
exceed 60 lbs. If more is taken, all above that weight
must be paid for as an extra. The class of incidentals can
only be covered so long as the Tourists travel with the
Conductor, and he has command of the expenses. Bis
