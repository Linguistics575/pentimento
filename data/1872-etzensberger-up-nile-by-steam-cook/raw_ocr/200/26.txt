" UP THE NILE BY STEAU. 23

here in about fire hours: as soon as the Steamer stops, a
swarm of Nabiarurcome to offer ostrich feathers, eggs, and
==; other articles, for sale.

______ - 14fh dar-At Assuan. Early after breakfast donkeys or
camels, at choice, are waiting to carry us through the town
and bazaar of Aswan, and the cemetery, to the desert road
leading towards Philos About a mile from the town, on

....... the hills to the left, are the celebrated granite quarries
where the obelisks were extracted from, and which are
best visited now. Continuing our road afterwards, in about

t4 , one hour we arrive on the river, where a boat is w.aiting to
t-.Illll, convey us over to Philze. Until about 3 o'clock in the after-
'-Illllt noon there is sufficient time to visit this enchanting place
talll in every part,1unch, and rest; then we once more go 011
Pdlllill board the boat, either to take us back to the place where we

"rwi+ embarked, or, if the wind permits and the company have
'__, made arrangements, to shoot the Cataracts in a Dehabeah
(which is at their own expense and risk); the same boat
brings us to our Steamer at Assuan in about two hours.
The charge for a Duhabeah for a party to shoot the Gate-
racts is from £5 to £5 sterling. If the wind is contrary,
or no arrangement has been made for shooting the Cute-
racts, then we again mount our donkeys or eamels-the
latter operation being rather dangerous-and return to
Assuan by another road, striking to the left towards the
village of Mohattan, and coasting the river all the way
down, enjoying the most magnifieent and varied views of
the wild scenery. As a rule, guides and donkey boys do
not like to take this way back, but the interest it otfers is
so very great that on no account ought it to be abandoned.

15th day.-Balf a day is more than sufficient to visit
