- FOR THE EAST. 39

_.,___L the plans I had formed and the arrangements made. All

seemed to wear a promising aspect until American Ocean
_______ Steamboat and Railroad Ticket Agents fired up in oppo-
- sition and strewed our path with difficulties, to *which we
_ had eventually to succumb, after a second visit of my Son
to consolidate arrangements.

At the close of 1866 I foresaw a busy season in Paris in
connection with the Universal Exhibition, and I suspended
all ideas of Eastern Travel until that season of great things
had closed. But no sooner had we got through our work
of taking visitors to, and providing them homes in, Paris,
than I again took up the idea of Tours to the East, and
wrote a page in my EcTntrsionis/, foreshadowing my plans
for the next year, the first feature of which was examination
of Routes, travelling and other accommodation. To make

Parties. At Beyrout I made the pleasant acquaintance of
the late Mrs. Thompson, the founder of the Beyrout and
Lebanon Schools, and her valuable eoadjt1tors, Mr. and
Miss Motte. I also made Hotel and Dragoman arrange-

for Nile Tours, as well as for Palestine.

I have been the more exact in detailing the particulars
of this preliminary journey, in consequence of public
insinuations and private accusations of having copied the
models of others, and especially of one claiming to be the
" Originator" of Eastern Tours. So far from this being a.
truthful representation, I refused to read a line of any
other programme or report of previous contracting arrange-
ments, aud I refused to go to any Hotel where this
"Originator" had managed to enter before me. I did,
