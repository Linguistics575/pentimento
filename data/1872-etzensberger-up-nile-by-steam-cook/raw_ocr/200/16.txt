" UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 15

__________ time to study hieroglyphics and history while moving on
:1... in a Steamer, the changing scenery taking up the whole
----------- - time and interest ; therefore, the greatest part of the work
=T=e, ' is useless for the moment.
' One of the most practicable and best-adapted guide books
- for a short visit up the Nile, if not the best in existence, is
-=T=TCr=T- the so-called "Austrian Lloyd’s Guide Book to Egypt,"
I --------- by Dr. Maurice Busch, translated into English by W. C.
" Wrankmore, Trieste, Austrian Lloyd'ss, 1864. This book

contains in a concise, clear style, a description of every-

li' thing really worth seeing, is very easy of reference, not
'ti'. too bulky, and written from beginning to end by a keen
S-il observer, who saw and described everything from nature,
, . and nothing else-a great advantage that Murray's cannot
Eff: boast of. Amongst a party of thirty who went up the
1:: Nile together two years ago, several had Marray's and

___, other guide books; there was but one copy of this
“Austrian Lloyd's Book." Very soon they all had to
flock round it for information, and it was unanimously
pronounced the only one really good for anything. In one
point only it falls short; when first published (1858) the
beautiful Temple of Edfon, the best preserved of all
Egyptian monuments, was Mill covered up with rubbish,
and the author could only describe a small portion of it
accessible at that time.

So many scientifie and sensational works have been pub-
lished about this wonderful country that a choice is very
dilfiealt. To any one desirous of getting really valuable
and sound information-a thing nearly impossible to obtain
in Egypt-we can recommend no better book than Heinrich
b'tephirshs "Das, Heutige Egypten." (P. A. Brockhaug,
