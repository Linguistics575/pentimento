Steamboat-being a public means of conveyance, where
every passenger can keep aloof from or mix with whom he

one family party, living day and night in close proximity,
and where continual frictions are unavoidable. We repeat,
it is very bad when misunderstanding arises between the

Besides, the Kh√©dive intends to improve this service
gradually, and one new comfortable Steamer has already
