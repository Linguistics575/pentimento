FOR THE EAST.

IMPORTANT NOTICE.

For the convenience of Ladies who may fail in horse-riding
through Palestine, or of any who may be disabled by
accident or illness, a very convenient AMBULANCE
has been constructed for the back of a horse, and it was
used with much success for the chief part of the Palestine
Tour of the month of March, 1872, in the case of a very
delicate lady. It was constructed under the direction of
Mr. ETZENSBERGER, on behalf of Messrs. COOK & SON, and
is now the property of their chief Dragoman, ALEXANDER
HOWARD, who will arrange for its use when required, at an
extra cost of about 20s. per day. Mr. Howard has also
purchased a machine for manufacturing ICE in the camp,
and has provided a large number of WATERPROOF SHEETS
for the protection of baggage in its transit. through
Palestine.
