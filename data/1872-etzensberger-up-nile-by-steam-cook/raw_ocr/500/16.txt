UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 15

time to study hieroglyphiea and history while moving on
in a Steamer, the changing scenery taking up the whole
time and interest; therefore, the greatest part of the work
is useless for the moment.

One of the most practicable and best-adapted guide books
for a short visit up the Nile, if not the beat in existence, is
the tso-called " Austrian Lloyd's Guide Book to Egypt,"
by Dr. Maurice Busch, translated into English by W. C.
Wrankmore, Trieste, Austrian Lloyd's, 1864. This book
contains in a concise, clear style, a description of every-
thing really worth seeing, is very easy of reference, not
too bulky, and written from beginning to end by a keen
observer, who saw and described everything; from nature,
and nothing else-a great advantage that Murray's cannot
boast oil Amongst a party of thirty who went up the
Nile together two years ago, several had Murray's and
other guide books ; there was but one copy of this
“Austrian Lloyd's Book." Very soon they all had to
flock round it for information, and it was unanimously
pronounced the only one really good for anything. In one
point only it falls short; when first; published (1858) the
beautiful Temple of Edfon, the best preserved of all
Egyptian monuments, was still covered up with rubbish,
and the author could only describe a small portion of it
accessible at; that time.

So many tscientifie and sensational works have been pub-
lished about this wonderful country that a choice is very
diffiealt. To any one desirous of getting really valuable
and sound information-a thing nearly impossible to obtain
in Egypt-we can recommend no better book than Heinrich
Stephen's “Des Hentige Egyptem" (F. A. Brookhaus,
