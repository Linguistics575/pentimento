UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 10

extensive sugar manufactory, employing about 2000 people.
A visit to this establishment will well repay the trouble, and
visitors are very civilly shown round.

4% d'ay-A few hours bring the boat to Beni-Hassan,
the first; place for 'sight-seeing. Swarms of beggars, and
miserable donkeys without saddles and bridleis-the worst
all along the Nile-await the arrival of the Steamer, and
in half an hour the Rock Tombs of Benr.Hassan are
reached. The northern grottoes are high up on a hill to
the left, and the Specs Artimedos straight on in a valley
eastward-both ought to be visited. The same evening,
or early the following day, we arrive at Siout, or Aesiut,
the metropolis of Upper Egypt and residence of a
Pacha.

5ik day.-Balf a day is devoted to a visit to the large
bazaar and the hills behind the town, offering a splendid
view of the Nile valley.

em. /hy.-Aceording, to circumstances, the ship is coaled
at Lious, and Girgeh is generally reached in the evening;
there is nothing of interest in this place-one of the
dirtiest 0n the Nile, Girgeh, or Bellianah, a small town
about ten miles higher up, is the starting point for visit-
ing Abydos. This visit, however, is better postponed and
made on the return journey, starting from Bellianah and
coming out at Abydos. These ruins are so grand and
magnificent that they cannot lose any of their charm and
novelty even after Karnak has been seen.

7/h tlay-Leaving the visit to Abydos for the return
j eurney, we reach Keneh towards evening, and if still early
enough, this important place may be visited before night.
