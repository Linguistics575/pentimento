Ismail as Khedive and Exile

Ismail's love for doing things that would attract
notice and make talk. It was a document relating
how one of my predecessors, twenty or twentyfive years before, having business at Ras-el-Teen
Palace in Alexandria, was invited to defer his return to the capital, and dine that night with the
khedive. The American representative stated that
he was unprepared, having brought no evening
dress. "That will be all right," exclaimed his
Highness. "At seven o'cloek you will find your
clothes at your hotel." A telegram was despatched
from the palace to Cairo, and a special messenger,
traveling by special train, brought the desired raiment. It cost somebody-probably the Egyptian
taxpayer--a considerable sum for running the train
a hundred and thirty miles, and was wholly unnecessary, for the resources of Alexandria could have
produced a dozen suits of evening garments in no
time. But that was Ismail's way of doing things.

In Ismaiys character there was little that could
be commended, yet one could not wholly withhold
admiration for his grandeur of thought and intrepidity of action. He was a ruler of magnificent
but inchoate ideas, in which he often got bewildered; and he invariably embarked in enterprises
without thinking of the cost. To deal adequately
with a character so regal, egotistic, masterful, and
subtle, to extenuate nothing, and at the same time
set nothing down in malice, is a task not easily
. performed. He certainly left his impress on history, and had he not lived it is doubtful if Cairo
would to-day be half as acceptable to its winter
