having services to sell should be as willing to labor

Egypt might, and might not, prosper under these
changed conditions. But there is little likelihood
of her being permitted to try the experiment, whatever her right, and "Egypt for the Egyptians "must
remain, in all probability, a sentimental illusion.
The khedive has the undoubted right to govern his
