Preface

the Egyptologist, antiquarian, nor historian: these
are favored already with a bibliography stra1ning
the shelves of every library. Aiming at being a discursive budget of information and comment ,-social, political, economic, and administrative, the volume presents a series of faithful pictures
of the Egypt that is interesting to the winter
visitor, health-seeker, and general reader, desirous
of learning something, and not too much, of contemporary conditions in the oldest country in the
world. "is written in no partial or partizan spirit, and advances no theory of
the purpose of the Pyramids, nor attempts to explain the riddle of the Sphinx.
