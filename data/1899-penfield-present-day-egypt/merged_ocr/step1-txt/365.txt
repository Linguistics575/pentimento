In Egypt for Health' s Sake

more interesting than a visit to an "ineubatory"
in any one of the native villages in the neighborhood of the Pyramids. It will be found that the
incubatory is constructed of sun-dried bricks, and
so arranged internally that the eggs, placed in
mud-constructed ovens on trays cushioned with cut
straw, are constantly under the attendant's view.
No scientific apparatus is employed by this man,
not even a thermometer. He knows from experience and his own feeling how much heat is
needed, and he systematically turns the eggs several times each day until they are developed into
peeping chicks. These hatching establishments
exist throughout Middle and Upper Egypt, and in
a season bring fully twenty million chickens into
the world, that grow up to be scrawny, un'attractive fowls. The industry is thousands of years old,
and seems conclusively to settle the question of a
chieken's maternity by allocating that parentage
to the hen laying the egg. The incubator is a
foster-mother only, and is responsible for stifling,
the "setting" instinct with Egyptian hens. The
keepers of the incubatories have a system of traffie
with peasant farmers by which eggs are purchased
outright, or six live chicks given in exchange for
a dozen fresh eggs.

V illa life, with quietude and health-giving air, is
offered at 1hiiiiilir, six or eight miles to the eastward of Cairo. Uninteresting itself, the village is
surrounded by points of historical association in
sufficient number to keep the attention of sojourners occupied for a few weeks at least.. The plain
