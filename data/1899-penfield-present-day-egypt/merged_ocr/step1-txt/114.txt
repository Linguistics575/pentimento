Present-Day Egypt

vable soil, sacrificing many lives, and ruining forty
villages-and the climate of Alexandria. It was a
wicked act, hardly justified by the needs of warfare. It is a curious example of the irony of fate
that monster English pumps and a staff of English
ongineers-paid for by the Egyptian government
---are given constant employment to-day in keeping the salt water of Lake Mareotis within bounds,
for no engineering resource can now prevent the
percolation of the sea to the lower level of Mareotis.
Engineering skill can only keep the water from
overflowing still more valuable territory. A million and a half tons of water are pumped back into
the Mediterranean every twenty-four hours.
Ramleh is the only residential suburb of Alexandria. It is easier to make the assertion than to
describe the limits of the place. It has many titular
subdivisions, but generically Ramleh may be said
to stretch along the entire sea-front from Alexandria to Abukir Bay, a dozen miles away.
"Ramleh" is the native word for sand, and in
this instance is applied with signal appropriateness. In summer all that portion of Cairo's officialdom unable to manage European leave of absence
betakes itself en masse to the hotels and villas of the
Alexandrian suburb, there to keep cool and incidentally assail the humid atmosphere by invidious
comparison. Hundreds of Alexandria's business
men reside throughout the year at Ramleh. J udges
of the international courts, consuls, functionaries
of every degree, bourse operators, and J ewish and
Greek money magnates, find there peaceful repose.
