Present-Day Egypt

centuries later, indicates that it had fallen into disuse and was most likely unnavigable. The Roman
emperors Trajan and Hadrian aspired each in his
time to make it possible for ships to go from one
sea to another, but the desert sands finally obliterated their efforts to pierce the Suez Isthmus.

In the interval of centuries thus spanned, the
Nile had almost deserted its Pelusiac branch, and
Roman engineers, coming later, tapped the great
river above its bifurcation, near the capital of the
present day, and ran a new canal from that point
to the old Bubastie canal, which they cleared and
restored to use. But this system was only temporarily successful, and Amrou, the Arabian conqueror, found inter-sea navigation impossible, and
himself essayed, with partial success, to solve the
great problem. Then, after the sands of the Arabian
desert had for centuries asserted their dominion,
came the great Napoleon, to whom all things were
possible. Shortly after he had conquered the ancient land of the Pharaohs, in 1798, his engineers
were given the task of bringing the Mediterranean
into communication with the Gulf of Suez. They
studied the project assiduously, and estimating
from their surveys, as others before them had done,
that the Mediterranean was thirty feet below the
level of the Red Sea, recommended a complicated
scheme calling for sluices and locks. Napoleon's
evacuation of Egypt in 1801 caused the work to be
dropped while yet in embryo.
