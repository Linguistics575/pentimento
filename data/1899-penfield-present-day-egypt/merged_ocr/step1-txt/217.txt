Story of the Suez Canal

be done, and the man who had spent twenty-four
years in meditation over the canal scheme saw that
he alone must do it. To create the Suez Canal
was to be a feat of finaneiering, not of engineering.

There was the easy-going Said, down in Egypt.
Why not have a try at him? Said loved Frenchmen, and believed the Suez Canal was to make his
name immortal. So the intrepid diplomat hurried
to Cairo and saw the Viceroy. "Certainly," was
his reply to De Lesseps's appeal, and he actually
loaned the money required for making the surveys and for exploiting the company throughout
Europe-2,394,914 francs in all. Had the Egyptian Viceroy said "Non as vigorously as had the
London bankers, how different would the modern
history of Egypt read, and how different would be
the material condition of the people of Egypt!

Encouraged by his success with Said Pasha, De
Lesseps thought the time propitious for getting
from him another concession, cognate but subordinate to the great scheme. This was to connect
the canal bringing fresh water from the Nile with
another small canal running from Ismailia to the
termini of the great ship-canal. The concession
permitted De Lesseps and his associates to sell irrigation privileges from this special waterway; and
wherever the magical water of Father Nile can be
turned upon the desert, the sands thereof blossom
like the rose.

In 1860 the Paris company of the long name was
again without a copper in its cash-box, and in debt
to an extent making the prospect almost hopeless.
