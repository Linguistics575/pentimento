Present-Day Egypt

Constantinople for absolute independence. So certain was Ismail Pasha of positive rulership, perhaps
deceived by the wily Nubar, who was concerned in
the negotiations, that it is related that a banquet
was given to a group of favorite functionaries in
celebration of the news that he believed was forthcoming from the Sublime Porto-that the Sultan
had at last consented to give him full sovereignty
of the N ile country. The dinner was Lucullian in
character, each dish a gastronomic triumph, and
the program called for a surpris at the end of
the feast. What it was to be, only the khedive and
his chef knew. Clothed in immaculate white satin,
the chef, wielding an enormous wooden knife, lifted
the crust of a huge pie placed in the middle of the
festal board, and out stepped a sprite in pink fleshings, dainty of face and form. With simulated bewilderment, she scanned for a moment the faces of
those at table, and, her choice decided upon, she
stepped over dishes and decorations to the head of
the table, and placed a kingly crown upon the brow
of Ismail.

But an edict of another sort issued from Constantinople, and a few weeks after the historical
feast Ismail was sent away from Egypt, never again
to see his beloved capital. When dying, he pleaded
to be taken back to Egypt; but not until he was
dead was the consent of the Sultan and the powers
granted.

A specially chartered steamship brought the
body of Ismail, accompanied by Princes Hussein
and Fouad, his sons, from Constantinople to Alexan
