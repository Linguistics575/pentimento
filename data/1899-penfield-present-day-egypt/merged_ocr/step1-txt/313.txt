The Present Khedival Family

Mohammedan custom, however, and was most popular with the Egyptians.

For the Koubbeh estate the khedive has imported
American farm machinery, to illustrate the advantages of tilling with modern appliances. There are
extensive stables filled with choice horses from various parts of the world. The position of honor
is given to a magnificent Arabian steed with flowing tail, sent to Abbas Pasha by the Sultan. Close
by is the English thoroughbred Cedar, presented
by the late Colonel North, and in a neighboring
stall stands an American trotter, the gift of an admiring Philadelphian.

The dairy, kennels, and poultry-yard at Koubbeh
are supplied with selected animals and fowls from
every clime, and in them the khedive takes the
keenest interest. For the work-people there is a
model village, with mosque, school, and meetingplace where discussion is encouraged after the
lyceum idea-all supported by the khedive, to
demonstrate the benefits of order, cleanliness, and
community of interests. The native fire-brigade,
with English apparatus, would be creditable anywhere.

So devoted is Egypt's young ruler to horses that
from his private purse he maintains a commission
to improve horse-breeding. He offers valuable

for the races during the Cairo season, when it not
infrequently happens that his colors are carried to
victory by his native jockey. The khedive enjoys
driving, and may often be met in the outskirts of
