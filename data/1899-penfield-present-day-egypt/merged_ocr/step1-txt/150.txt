Present-Day Egypt

restoration of Egypt to admitted prosperity, consequently, at a period when shrinkage in prices of

receipts from all sources are not far from nine million dollars annually. By reason of the important
reduction of fares, previously spoken of, the number of passengers has been doubled in a few years.
All-rail travel from the Mediterranean to the first
cataract of the Nile has been possible for nearly a
