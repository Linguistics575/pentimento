canal to the British government for twenty million
dollars, and on these the Egyptian treasury faithfully paid England five per cent. interest for twenty
years. This purchase illustrated Lord Beaconsfield's shrewdness, for by prompt action he prevented these shares from going to France. To-day
they are worth more than four times what was
paid for them, and secure to England the voting
control in canal affairs. The stipulation in the

borrow a few millions when the French company
could raise no more money. Thus, having no
maritime interests, and possessing not a share in
the enterprise, no pecuniary benefit can accrue to
the Egyptian people from the Suez Canal. And,
further, it can be conjectured that, had Ismail not
burdened his subjects with overwhelming indebtedness, thereby breeding discontent, there would
have been no European interference with Egyptian
finances, involving his dethronement; no Arabi
