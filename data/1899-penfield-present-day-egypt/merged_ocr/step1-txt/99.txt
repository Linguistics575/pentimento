In Fascinating Cairo

the cause of the superiority of the Cairo cigarette
over that of Alexandria or Port Said is the superdry climate of the capital, which is better adapted
to the fabrication of cigarettes than is the humid
atmosphere of the sea-coast. The constant flow of
tourists has been the chief means of spreading the
taste for the Egyptian cigarette, acquired in the
land of the Nile, and its delicate aroma is familiar,
in consequence, not only in America and England,
but in far corners of the earth. All tobacco entering Egypt pays a duty equal to one dollar per kilogram, and a drawback equal to fifty cents a kilogram is allowed on cigarettes sent out of the
country.
