Since the year 1886 the finances of Egypt have
improved to an extent emphasizing the nation's
emergence from practical bankruptcy to an enviable condition of credit to be found in the history
of but few countries. So marked was the improvement that in 1890 the government was in a position to carry into effect a conversion of the whole
of its external debt, thereby scaling the rate of in-.

Egypt's burden of interest has thus been greatly decreased, yet the country has still to find nearly nineteen million dollars for the yearly interest charges.
The presentbonded debt, approximately stated, with
the current premium quoted on European bourses
on the several classes of obligations, is as follows:

Guaranteed loan, 3 y. (quoted 5 premium)' 42,442,000
Privileged debt, 3W, (quoted "premium) 142,854,000
Unified debt, l% (quoted 7 premium) 272,037,000
Domains loan, HX (quoted 5 premium) 19,418,000
Daira Sanieh loan, 4 Af (quoted "premium) 32,191,000

Total bonded debt, $ 508,942,000

tically every acre of the soil not belonging to the desert is under cultivation, producing one, oftentimes two, and occasionally three crops

almost every foot of the soil utilized, it would not be possible for
923 persons to the square mile to be supported. And, further, it
should be borne in mind that the official census fixing Egypt's population at 9,750,000 included many Bedouin tribes and other desertdwellers, and was further swollen by the inclusion of many Nubians
who had left their southern provinces and crossed the frontier into
Egypt.
