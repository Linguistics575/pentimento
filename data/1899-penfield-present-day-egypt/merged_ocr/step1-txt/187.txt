Expansion by Irrigation

terranean. Thus Middle Egypt and the Delta will
secure more or less perennial irrigation.

The Nile, the only river of Egypt, has a length
of 4062 miles, and is thus exceeded only by the
Mississippi, having a length of 4112 miles. At
Cairo the river is eleven hundred yards in breadth.
After the eoMuenee of the Blue and White Niles
at Khartum, it receives but one tributary, the
Atbara. In Egypt proper the great river has no
affluent and is contributed to in no way. The
most important of the outlets of the Nile is J oseph's
Canal (the Bahr Youssef), that leaves the river
near Girgeh, and for two hundred and twenty miles
follows along the foot of the Libyan chain of hills,
finally entering the Fayum and fertilizing this
fruitful oasis, its own creation, in numerous ramifications. In the Delta the most important canal is
the Mahmudiyeh, built by Mehemet Ali in 1823. It
connects the Rosetta arm with the harbor of Alexandria.

At Assuan the Nile is three hundred and thirty
feet above the level of the Mediterranean. From
Assuan to Cairo the fall is a trifle under five inches
in the mile, and from Cairo to the sea the fall averages nearly an inch to the mile.

To equalize the distribution of the Nile water
among cultivators, the whole country devoted to
agriculture is divided by low earthwork dams into
large fields, to which the water is conducted by
canals. Lands that cannot be reached by the overflow of the canals have to be mechanically irrigated.
To do this the small proprietor lifts the water from
