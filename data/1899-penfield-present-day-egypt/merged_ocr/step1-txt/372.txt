Present-Day Egypt

brings Luxor and Assuan into intimate touch with
the world. Luxor has good hotels, a small hospital, and competent medical men.. The Luxor Hotel
is good enough to satisfy any reasonable person; its
gardens include hundreds of varieties of trOpical
plants and trees. If time presses, the journey to
Cairo, four hundred and fifty miles, may be made
by train in a day, but not with the comfort to be
found on the steamers. In archaeological attractions Luxor is without a peer. Karnak is admittedly unapproachable in grandeur and antiquarian
interest, and the plain of Thebes rich with storied
ruins. An excursion to the Tombs of the Kings,
where the royal mummies rested for thousands of
years previous to their transfer to Der el-Bahari,
repays one for taxing strength and energy. From
the moment of mounting your donkey on the Nile
strand to the final dismount on the return, diminutive Egyptians, not overelad, keep pace with the
animal throughout the day, demanding bakshish.
with smiling faces at every step-am1 it is a long
and tortuous journey to the Tombs of the Kings.
However resolute one may be not to give, and although your command to "imshi / "has been sternly
repeated a thousand times, you generally relent at
the last moment, as the youngsters know you will,
and shower your milliemes and half-piasters among
the descendants of Mizraim. There is something
consoling and stimulating to robust Sightseer as
well as to semi-invalid in this exercise of benevolence.

From Luxor to Assuan is a short one hundred
