Story of the Suez Canal

fully explained. Some thought that, as he had no
personal fortune, this stood in the way of his receiving a French dukedom: provision for himself
and his heirs would have been necessary. Others

know, the pathetic chapters of its history. It has
revolutionized shipping methods, driven the stately
sailing-ship from the ocean, and some years ago had
developed as much traifie as can be expected to

the Cape of Good Hope. By the latter the distance between England and Bombay is 10,860 miles,
by the canal 4620 miles; from St. Petersburg to
Bombay by the Cape is 11,610 miles, by the canal
6770 miles; and from New York to Bombay by
