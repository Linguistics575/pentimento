Present-Day Egypt

N aples or Genoa, changing at one of these ports to
a steamer of the same line, that will land passengers at Port Said or Ismailia, whichever canal
station offers a favorable train to Cairo. If there
be no German Lloyd boat sailing from Genoa or
Naples at a convenient time, there are several other
first-class lines starting from or touching at these
ports, and one should find an available steamer
without much trouble or delay. In this way the
voyage from New York to Egypt is made with the
maximum of comfort in from sixteen to twenty
days. Every winter offers occasional excursions
by the North German Lloyd, Hamburg-American,
and French lines from New York to Alexandria direct; and as travel to Egypt grows, which it does
by leaps and bounds, the facilities for getting there
are'sure to increase. A regular direct service between New York and Alexandria, during the winter months at least, is almost certain to be soon
established.

The robust traveler bound for the land of the
Pyramids can disembark from his Atlantic liner in
England or France, as the case may be, catch a quick
train, to Marseilles, Brindisi, Genoa, Naples, Venice, or Triest, and be in Alexandria or Port Said in
a few.days' less time than if he went by the all-sea
route. If.he is willing to travel post-haste, he may
be in .Gai-ro .in fourteen days after leaving New
York, or possibly in thirteen.
