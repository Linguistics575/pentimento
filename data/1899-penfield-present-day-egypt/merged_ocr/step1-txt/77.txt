In Fascinating Cairo

he is not a perfect soldier; but Spartan virtues
must not be looked for from a nation of Helots.

General Lord Kitchener, sirdar of the Egyptian
army and governor-general of the Sudan, is yet
several years on the right side of fifty, is every inch
a soldier, and only a soldier, and has the proverbial dash and courage of the Irishman. He went
to Egypt resolved to win his spurs in a field where
.others had failed, and never for an instant allowed
his courage to falter or his energies to be diverted
to other channels. He has, indeed, added his name
to the list of great military leaders of the nineteenth
century.

The British army of occupation, which is independent of the Egyptian army, is in Egypt on
financial terms liberal to the Egyptians, for the
khedival government pays only the difference between the cost of home and foreign service, being
less than half a million dollars yearly for the fortyfive hundred men composing this contingent. Usually about three thousand Britishers are kept in
Cairo; but, on occasions when there has been friction between the khedive and the British administrators, these have been countermarched so ingeniously as to give the impression that ten times as
many redcoats were there. The English officers
lend much to a winter's gaiety. Courageous fellows,
trained to conquer, no season is complete that does
not add to their conquests those of the ball-room.
"Scarlet fever" is in the atmosphere of Cairo
breathed by the girl visitor, but is seldom serious
or lasting.
