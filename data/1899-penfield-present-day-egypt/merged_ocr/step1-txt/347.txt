Britain's Position in Egypt

of their Egyptian chiefs. The native minister is
the visible and signatory power, the creative and
actual force being the English assistant. Everything financial is dictated by an "adviser," as is
nearly everything judicial, and these functionaries
are British. Similarly, the ministry of the interior,
presided over by the educated and capable Egyptian premier, is also largely directed by an "adviser."

Lord (homer is proud of the British assistants
who have coiiperated with him in the work of rehabilitating Egypt, and especially pleased to inform inquirers that the work has been accomplished
by a body of officials not exceeding one hundred
in number-a record that we in America, new to
colonial administration, will do well to consider.
An interesting example of the way in which
English officials seek to carry the Egyptians with
them is afforded by some recently announced statistics. In the finance ministry, under the strictest
British tutelage, 13 English and 513 natives are
employed; in the department of the interior, dictated by British rule, 62 English and 784 Egyptians find employment. In the offices under international control the percentage of Britishers is very
small. For example, the staff of the mixed courts
consists of 242 Europeans (of whom 17 are British)
and 101 Egyptians. The Caisse de la Dette employs 50 Europeans (2 being British) and 10
Egyptians, and the quarantine board has 48 European and 19 native employees.
