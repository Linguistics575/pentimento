The Present Khedival F amily

of the khedivah-rntee, who, by reason of having
been born a princess, takes rank over the khedivah
as the first lady of the court. The khedivahmere is little more than forty years of age, and is
said to be charming and accomplished. She was
at one time the most beautiful of the princesses of
the East. Her lovely, clear complexion, magnificent eyes, with the shape of her face and the carriage of the head, made her a very queen of beauty,
it is claimed by ladies having the entree at the
viceroyal court. Living in strict Mohammedan
seclusion, and never appearing in public except with
veiled faces, the ladies of the khedival family are
not subjected to masculine gaze. Their attendance
at the opera is concealed from the audience by
screened boxes; but flashing jewels and shadowy
outlines behind the gossamer curtains tell of their
presence.

Up to February 20, 1899, Prince Mehemet Ali
was heir to the khedivate; but on that date the
consort of Abbas Pasha gave birth to a son at the
villa of Montazah, and while the happy event was
being celebrated throughout the country, it was
formally announced that Prince Mohammed Abdoul-Mounaim, the newborn, was heir apparent to
the khedival dignity and estate. This' was in
accord with the Sultan's firman of June 9, 1873,
which provided that the succession to the khedivate of Egypt is exclusively by order of primogeniture in the male line. Should Abbas Pasha die, the
firman provides for a regency until the heir attains
his legal majority at the age of eighteen years.
