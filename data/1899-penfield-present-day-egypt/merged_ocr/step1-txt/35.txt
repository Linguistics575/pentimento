In Fascinating Cairo

tom is unalterable; and, presumably, cows are not
looked upon as possessing sufficient intellect to
know a live from a dead calf, or to recognize
their own.

Cairo presents the best exemplifieation of the
confusion of tongues descending from the building
of the tower of Babel that I know. Every language and patois of Europe, every shade of vernacular of Asia and Africa, may there be heard.
It is humiliating to us of the Western world, who
may have struggled the best part of a lifetime with
a single foreign language, to find the Cairene able
to speak fluently a dozen. The dragoman or the
donkey-boy can exploit his vocation in a wonderful variety of tongues, although possibly unable to
read his name in any. Ask your way in the street,
and you must not be surprised if the information
be given in a sentence made up of words from
English, French, and Italian, perhaps with a
Creek word thrown in. Polyglot as Cairo is, the
medley of coinages is none the less confusing. Send
your dragoman to the bazaars in quest of some
article, and he may return with the astonishing information that it costs "one napoleon, half a sovereign, and eighteen piasters tariff." It calls for
pencil, paper, and patience to compute the price of
the article you are endeavoring to buy through
your polynumismatic servant. And the piaster,
the basis of computation, has a confusing value.
The piaster "current" of small transactions is but
half as much as the piaster "tariff" of high life; and
this latter is only five cents in American money.
