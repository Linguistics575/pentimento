Britain's Position in Egypt

Rhodes's materializing project for building with
British money a Cape-to-Cairo railway, taken together, cannot give the foes of British domination
in Egypt much hope for expecting any radical
change of program for many years to come. I
am told that to this day there is periodical speculation in Spain as to when England may be expected to restore to the Spanish government the
rock of Gibraltar. Having this event always in
contemplation, the Madrid council has for a century regularly appointed a grandee to the governorship of the rocky promontory that gives Great
Britain control of the Mediterranean. The departure of the English from Egypt is as unlikely to
happen as their restoration of Gibraltar to the
Spaniards.

The statesmen guiding France in 1882 claimed to
recognize no necessity for bombarding Alexandria,
and when it was decided that England's ships were
to fire upon the city, the French admiral was
ordered to remove his fleet from the scene of confr1et, Frenchmen still insist that the Arabi rebellion
could have been successfully dealt with on shore,
and that the razing of Alexandria was wanton destruction. When the war-ships of France steamed
away from Alexandria they decided the fate of
their country as a participator in the affairs of
Egypt, and the record of that J uly day is an eventful page in French history, and marks the beginning
of the claim on the part of England to govern
single-handed a country forming no part of the
British empire.
