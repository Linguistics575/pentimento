Expansion by Irrigation

way back to their steamers or hotel at Assuan.
The making of the dam will force the nude population of the region to prosecute their amphibious
pursuits elsewhere-most likely in eddying rapids
farther down-stream. But the daring soul who has
"shot "what will remain of the cataract will, as of
old, be landed on the bank at Assuan to the resounding "Heep, heep, hooray! Zank you, zank
you! "of his crew of black rowers, whom he will
liberally bakshish while yet believing himself a
hero.

The American sun-seeker or English milord,
making the voyage to Wady-Halfa by his own
dahabiyeh, will no longer have his craft hauled up
the Assuan cataract by a hundred shrieking Arabs
and Berberins, for most likely it will be taken up
the rapids and through the locks by electricity
generated by the rushing Nile itself. Indeed, a
practical Britisher is in the field for utilizing the
eataraet's force for electrically lighting Assuan and
propelling irrigating machinery for a hundred miles
or more down-stream, to the possible relief of the
familiar shadoof and creaking sakieh.

The Assuan structure will differ in several respects from any great dam hitherto built. In
the first place, none for impounding water has
ever been made on any river approaching the size
of the Nile; and, in the second place, it is to be
both dam and waterway, a conjunction exceedingly
difficult to effect. To confine Father Nile in floodtime would be hopeless, and therefore the river
must be allowed to run unimpeded through the dam
