In Egypt for Health's Sake

things about Assuan, and in the matter of the
half-finished obelisk one will speculate why the
work was stopped, whether there was a change in
the dynasty, or if an appropriation gave out; and
it will do no harm, when studying the cartouches
chiseled on the boulders along the river-bank, for
the mind to endeavor to determine whether they
are autographs or were cut by command of kings
desirous of leaving an indelible impress of their
reigns.

Loiterers about Assuan must not be disappointed
when told that the crocodile is no longer to be
found within the tourist limits of the N ile. It will
be but another illusion shattered, like the popular
belief that the tailless Manx eats may be seen in
the Isle of Man, or gray Maltese eats in Malta.
Outside of a few princely gardens at Cairo not a
stalk of the papyrus plant can be found nearer
Egypt in these days than at Syracuse in Sicily;
and more and better examples of the Egyptian lotus
may be seen in August in the public fountain of
Union Square in New York than a winter's search
in Egypt will reveal.

The evening songs of the Assuan boatmen are
soothing to jaded nerves, and the invalid who cannot find peace and benefit at this delightful upriver station can hardly expect to regain health in
Egypt.

The health-seeker who desires to linger beyond
the usual time for quitting Egypt in the spring or
early summer may find comfort and stimulating
sea-breezes at Ramleh, the Mediterranean suburb
