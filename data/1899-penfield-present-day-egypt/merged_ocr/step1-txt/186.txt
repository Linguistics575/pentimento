Present-Day Egypt

during several months of the year. As soon as
the flood subsides, but while the discharge is still
greater than can be at once used for irrigation, the
water will be retained for use during the parching
summer months. For this purpose the structure
will be divided into a large number of piers, with
openings that can be closed at will by gates.

Each pier must be capable of supporting its own
weight and the pressure of water against the adjoining sluice-gates, and the piers must be able to
pass the torrent without damage. At times the
velocity of the escaping flood-water will be very
great; consequently the piers are to be enormously
massive. The locks for steamers and other craft
navigating the Nile will be on the west side.

It being the particles of soil contributed to the
river by the wash of the mountains and hills in
Abyssinia that enrich the fields, the dam will be so
designed that the water released daily, during low
Nile, will be drawn from near the bottom of the
reservoir. Egyptian farmers prize the "red water,"
which is vastly richer in fertilizing value than clear
water can be. In the autumn, after the silt-laden
water has passed off, the sluice-gates will be closed
gradually until the reservoir is full, which, with
normal conditions, will be in J anuary and February. From April to the end of August, when the
Nile runs low, and the demand for water for the
crops is at its highest, the gates will be systematically opened, and the summer supply of the river
supplemented by the water, which, had it not been
stored, would have flowed uselessly into the Medi
