Story of the Suez Canal

struct a ship-canal across his territory. This soldier who had founded a dynasty by successive deeds
of bravery, and had butchered three or four hundred Mamelukes whom he had asked to a feast,
could not have been suspected of lacking in daring; but he never fully yielded to the blandishments of foreigners striving to get him interested
in isthmian canalization. His sagaeio11s intellect
kept him from embarking therein, save in a tentative way. The discovery in 1830, by Lieutenant
Waghorn, that the level of the two seas was nearly
identical, failed even to impress the hard-headed
Viceroy. He commissioned Linant Pasha, however,
to prepare a plan for a canal across the narrowest
part of the isthmus, from Tilreh to Suez; but
as this Frenchman accepted the survey of Bonaparte's engineers, and discredited the statement of
Waghorn as to the level of the waters, the viceroy still withheld his confidence from the scheme.
In 1846 he asked a board of engineers, comprising
representatives of England, France, and Austria, to
solve once for all the question of the sea-levels.
These experts confirmed the judgment of the Englishman, Waghorn; but the British member of the
board, the renowned Robert Stephenson, with his
instinct for railway-making, persuaded Mehemet
Ali to construct instead a railway from Cairo to
Suez, in connection with the line from Alexandria.
This was done, and it formed the connecting-link
between Europe and the East, and brought great
profit, and no political dangers, to Egypt.
