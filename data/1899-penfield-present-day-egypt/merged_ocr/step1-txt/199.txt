which leaves the Nile at Assiut and conveys the
water of life to the Fayum. But the Englishmen

as an irrigationist, nor with Mr. Whitehouse, the
latter was formally thanked for his scholarly suggestion, decorated by the khedive as a Grand Commander of the Medjidieh-and the Englishmen

Assuan dam.

To comprehend the importance of present-day
irrigation in Egypt, it must be borne in mind that
the country owes its fertility solely to the Nile. Its
agriculture, even the country's existence, depends
on irrigation, for Egypt is practically rainless.
Wherever the Nile water can be regularly supplied
to the soil, the most bountiful crops follow, which,
like cotton and sugar, command high prices because
of their excellence. Indeed, with a reliable supply
of water, farming in the Nile country can be pur
