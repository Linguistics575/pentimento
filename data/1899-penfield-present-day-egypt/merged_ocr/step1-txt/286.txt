Present-Day Egypt

by the efforts of those supporting him, and by the
blunders of his opponents. After Tel-el-Kebir he
never uttered one word of regret, never made a
single inquiry as to the fate of those poor wretches
who were the victims rather of his dunderhead
stupidity than of his intentional wickedness."

Many times, before and after the revolt, Tewfik
Pasha was deplorably wanting in firmness, and, on
the other hand, was more than once as heroic as
any man could be when in imminent danger. If
compelled to decide quickly, the decision was too
often on the side of error; but with time for deliberation, his conclusion was nearly always to do
the right thing, unmindful of the peril or the consequences. A man of the greatest genius, however,
might have found it difficult to thread his course
through such a labyrinth of doubts and misfortunes as that in which the khedive was placed.

If any benefits immediately resulted from England's voluntary aid to Egypt, the breaking of the
dual control was the first in importance. French
susceptibilities were so irritated by the non-departure of the British troops, sent to the country to
restore the authority of the khedive, that the government of France declined to remain a party to
the management of Egyptian finances. I do not
express an opinion as to the wisdom of this action
as a matter of policy, but the withdrawal of France
certainly helped the position of the poor Egyptians,
for they had then one master less. A single control is preferable to any other form of oligarchy,
when the welfare of a suffering people is considered.
