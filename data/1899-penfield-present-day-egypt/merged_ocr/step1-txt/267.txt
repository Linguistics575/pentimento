CHAPTER VIII
TEWFIK PASHA AND THE ARABI REBELLION

EW events in modern history are more pathetically dramatic than the substitution of
Tewfik for Ismail. The Turkish grand vizir despatched two telegrams to Cairo on June 26, 1879.
One was to "Ismail Pasha, ex-Khedive of Egypt ";
the other to Mohammed Tewfik, his son. In the
former it was stated that his Imperial Majesty the
Sultan, as the result of a decision of his council of
ministers, had formally decided to request Ismail's
retirement from the khedivate, in favor of the next
in succession, his Highness Tewfik Pasha, and that
the irade to this effect had been issued. While
Ismail was reading this decree at Abdin Palace,
the son was reading the other message at his country-seat a few miles out of Cairo, to the effect that
"his Imperial Majesty the Sultan has named you
by imperial irade Khedive of Egypt, and the firman will be delivered to you with the customary
ceremonial. Convoke the ulema and functionaries, the chief men of the country, and the government employees, and communicate to them
the stipulations of the decree relative to your succession, and at once relieve his Highness Ismail
