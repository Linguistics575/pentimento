Paradoxical Administration

he can. Nevertheless, the strictly home indebtedness secured by farm mortgages is greater than it
should be. Some critics insist that this is certain
proof that the boasted prosperity of the country is

done this only to be able to buy more land, being

people whose welfare first deserves consideration.

The recent expansion of the cultivable area being
chiefly in Upper Egypt and portions of the Nile
valley where the fertility cannot be compared to
that of Lower Egypt, there has been a corresponding decrease in the average value of the acre.
When I investigated the subject five years ago, I
arrived at the conclusion that $ 115 was a fair estimate of the value of productive Egypt, acre for
acre. Now, when the character of the newly acquired extensions is considered, it is my judgment
that the average value of the 6,720,000 acres has

estimated at too low a sum), find that but little
