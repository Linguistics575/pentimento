these days employs cattle or steam-power.

It was determined by the explorations of Speke,
Grant, and Baker that the rainfall of the equatorial
region of Africa supplies the Victoria and Albert
lakes, and that the overflow of these gives sufficient
volume to support the Nile throughout its northward course of thirty degrees of latitude, crossing
arid sands and burning deserts, until it reaches the
Mediterranean.

It might at first sight appear that the discovery
of the Niles sources had completely solved the
mystery of ages, and proved the fertility of Egypt
to be dependent upon the rainfall of the equator
concentrated in the Victoria Nyanza and Albert
Nyanza; but the exploration of the Nile tributaries
of Abyssinia divides the Nile system into two
parts, and unravels the entire mystery of the river
by assigning to each its share in ministering to the
prosperity of Egypt.

The lake sources maintain the life of Egypt by
supplying a stream throughout all seasons that has
sufficient volume to support the exhaustion of
evaporation and absorption; but'this stream unaided could never overflow its banks, and Egypt,
deprived of the annual inundation, would be forced
to exist with the cultivation of the circumscribed
area immediately bordering the great river.

The two great aff1uents of Abyssinia are the Blue
Nile and the Atbara (called by the natives Bahral-Aswad, or the Black Nile), which, although
