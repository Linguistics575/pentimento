The Present Khedival Family

seasons since, it was arranged that a field-review
be given of the Egyptian troops quartered in the
capital, in honor of the famous commander-in-chief
of Queen Vietoria's army. The proposition came
from Britishers in the Egyptian service, those who
believe that Egypt would go to the eternal bowwows were it not for the fostering hand of England.
Bis Highness the Khedive was to be present, as
nominal commander of the army.

All Cairo was at Abbassieh, on horseback or in
carriages, to see the manoeuvers. The khedive galloped 011 to the parade-ground with his aides, and
immediately took command of the forces. The
spectators were treated to something manifestly
not on the bills, for the young Egyptian put the
soldiers through their paces in a manner causing
consternation to the offieidls who had intended the
khedive to play an ornamental part only in the show.

Infantry and cavalry were hurried here and there,
the camel corps was sent across the desert to repel
an imaginary foe, and platoons of artillery were
ordered into position, and their guns belched forth
volley after volley. This mimic warfare, extending
over miles of the desert, was kept up for two hours,
and waxed so fast and furious that nearly all the
spectators had fallen by the wayside, from inability
to keep up, long before it was over. His Royal
Highness of England had not experienced such a
shaking up for years, and when the campaign ended
did not hesitate to say that the Egyptian soldiers
were a fine lot of men, knowing every detail of a
soldier's calling.
