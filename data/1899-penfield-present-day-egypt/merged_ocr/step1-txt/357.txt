Britain's Position in Egypt

thing may "turn up "helpful to the legal aspect of
England's position in Egypt.

To get rid of the present anomalous position, a
great many people in the British Isles and elsewhere would be glad if diplomatic fietions could be
brushed away, and the whole of the territory tributary to the Nile openly declared to be a portion of
Queen Irictoria's empire. But at present the British
government thinks it wiser to make'sure of the substance than to pay attention to shadowy phrases.
British withdrawal would be an act of justice to
sultan and khedive, but would serve no other
legitimate interest. To annex Egypt, as France
did Madagascar, would probably stir up animosities
resulting in war.

The masterly victory of Turkish troops in the
Greek war was a blow to Englishmen and others
who believed the disintegration of the Ottoman empire to be near at hand. They had already experienced a set-back when the Armenian disorders
failed to shake the Sultan's throne, and the result
of the Greco-Turkish war caused a painful awakening as to the true state of the health of the "Sick
Man of Europe." A break-up of the Sultan's empire
may come in time, and Egypt fall to England, and
Syria to France, in the general parceling out of
Turkish possessions. But the tt Sick Man" keeps
such watchful attention on the Bosporus that the
scramble for Ottoman territory may be postponed
for many a long year.
