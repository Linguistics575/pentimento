the government employs every means for keeping

are systematically patrolled by coast-guardsmen,
and every foot of the Suez Canal is similarly under
surveillance; while port authorities at Alexandria,
Rosetta, Damietta, and Port Said expend more
energy in endeavoring to prevent the secret landing of hashish than all other articles declared by
Egyptian law to be contraband.

Notwithstanding these precautions, the cunning
of the smugglers enables them to run the forbidden
article across from islands of the Grecian Archipelago, and land it in Egypt with a certainty permitting the demand for the compound to be
regularly supplied. It is manufactured in many
out-of-the-way places in the eastern Mediterranean,
and its excessive value, once within reach of its
devotees in Egypt, is enough to compensate those
concerned in the trade for the occasional eontiseation of a shipment. Many of the devices practised
for getting it into the country are ingenious in the
