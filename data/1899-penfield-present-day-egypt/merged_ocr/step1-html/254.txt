prisoner in a gilded cage he surrendered himself to<br/>
the situation and made the best of it.<br/>
<br/>
A few years after his deposition, Ismail presented to the Egyptian government a claim for<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">twenty-fiviy </span>million dollars, alleged to be the value<br/>
of personal property he had been deprived of by<br/>
his expulsion from the country, and more than half<br/>
this amount <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>secured for him through the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">efforts </span>of his counsel, Sir William Marriott.<br/>
<br/>
Like most imaginative persons, Ismail possessed<br/>
a keen sense of humor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>disappointments and<br/>
troubles did not altogether smother. It is related<br/>
that when in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">post </span>of the depression following<br/>

had witnessed the incident. "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Beeause</span>," answered<br/>
the khedive, "if that sharper could allege that he<br/>
had sat in a draft and caught cold in my palace, it<br/>
would take at least a quarter of a million francs<br/>
to meet the demand that he would make for satisfaction. I am beginning to understand these European business gentlemen," he added sadly.<br/>

In examining the correspondence files in the<br/>
