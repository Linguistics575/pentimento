<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Cairenes are ever out of doors. Their religious<br/>
calendar teems with ceremonious anniversaries,<br/>
added to Which are the numerous fantasias and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ftste-days </span>required by their devotion to the khedive,<br/>
and if things of their own are quiet, there being no<br/>
wedding to be celebrated, or friend setting out on<br/>
the pilgrimage to Mecca, or returning from the<br/>
visit to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prophet</span>'s tomb, the native classes go to<br/>
see the Greeks honor the name-day of their king,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the French colony commemorate the fall of the<br/>
Bastille. With calendars ranging from the Hejira<br/>
to the Gregorian, it is indeed an off day when nothing is <span style="color: #ff0000;">beinreelebrated</span>. Cairo has three fixed<br/>
Sabbaths. Friday is that of the Mohammedan,<br/>
Saturday of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ew</span>, and the succeeding day the<br/>
Sunday of the Christian church. Being lunar, the<br/>
Mohammedan year is eleven days shorter than our<br/>
own. This makes it <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>for strangers to know<br/>
just when a celebration is to occur, for the interesting function that one's friend witnessed in <span style="color: #0000FF;">midwinter </span>fifteen years ago, and told you that you must<br/>
not fail to see, now falls in midsummer.<br/>
<br/>
Every Moslem knows by his almanac when the<br/>
fasting month of Ramadan should begin; but the<br/>
crescent moon must first be seen by the imperial<br/>
astronomer in Constantinople, and the fact be telegraphed to Cairo, before the citadel guns can announce to the Egyptian nation that the celebration<br/>
of: the ninth month of their year may <span style="color: #0000FF;">officially<br/>
</span>begin. The streets then become thronged, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">story-tellers </span>at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cafes </span>draw large audiences, and<br/>
thousands of the faithful spend the night in the<br/>
<br/>
14<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
