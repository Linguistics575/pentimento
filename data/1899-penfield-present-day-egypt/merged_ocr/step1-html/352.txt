<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
ter of compensation has ever been a nominal consideration.<br/>
<br/>
English has never been made an <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>language<br/>
of the international courts of Egypt, yet advocates<br/>
therein can plead in Italian, French, and Arabic the<br/>
principles of the Code Napoleon. Steps are now<br/>
being taken, however, to have English placed on<br/>
the list of <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>languages for <span style="color: #0000FF;">pleadings</span>, with<br/>
every prospect of securing the assent of a majority<br/>
of the governments interested in the courts. The<br/>
United States will, obviously, assist the movement.<br/>
A beginning has been made within a few months<br/>
by the admission of legal documents in English,<br/>
and by the appointment of several registrars who<br/>
understand English. Still England cannot hope to<br/>
rival France in legal matters in Egypt for many<br/>
years to come, for every young Egyptian aspiring<br/>
to the profession of law qualifies therefor at the<br/>
Cairo School of Law, maintained by the French<br/>
government, and takes his degree in France.<br/>
<br/>
All these conditions, by Which France has been<br/>
hourly in evidence, to the almost total effacement<br/>
of England, have contributed to the bewilderment<br/>
of the minds of the natives. British trade follows<br/>
the British flag, but British opinion never follows<br/>
the French language, surely.<br/>
<br/>
The administrative blunder of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>English in not<br/>
bringing in their language with the beginning of<br/>
their intelligent reforms is half responsible for the<br/>
unpopularity of the occupation, whose benefits<br/>
would surely be obliterated and forgotten six<br/>
months after the departure of the last British<br/>
