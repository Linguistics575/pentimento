<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
American farmers and British agriculturists to<br/>
know that some of their brethren of the Nile<br/>
pay a land-tax of eight dollars per acre annually,<br/>
and that the average tax of the country approximates four dollars to the acre. The heaviest tax is<br/>
on the choice lands of the Delta, possessing such<br/>
exceptional richness that five <span style="color: #0000FF;">hundredweight </span>or<br/>
more of cotton per acre is produced each year with<br/>
comparative certainty.<br/>
<br/>
To-day<span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>prosperity of the fellah of Egypt, permitting him to have a few dollars after the adjustment of accounts following the sale of his crops,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>to augment his vegetable diet by<br/>
a dish of meat, and to seek recreation at his beloved religious fairs, is of recent origin and slow<br/>
growth: it began with the introduction of tax receipts, and has been nurtured at intervals by trifling reductions in taxation, as the area has been<br/>
added to by irrigation at a rate in excess of the<br/>
government's pecuniary needs. Being humanely<br/>
treated, the present-day Egyptian realizes that he<br/>
is a human being; and it is the opinion of those<br/>
capable of <span style="color: #0000FF;">judging </span>that more has been done in the<br/>
last fifteen years for his well-being than in all the<br/>
rest of the century. The humane work was <span style="color: #0000FF;">inaugurated </span>under <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">NWN</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>Pasha, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">administration </span>headed by Khedive Abbas is carrying it <span style="color: #0000FF;">forward </span>with intelligent perseverance.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">eountry</span>'s obligations to European creditors<br/>
are sufficiently menacing and burdensome to compel the small farmer to keep out of the clutches of<br/>
the Greek or Syrian money-lender at his gates, if<br/>
