<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
dening to one who loves the Cairo of Ismail and<br/>
Tewfik.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Habitu√©s </span>have their favorite mosques, as they<br/>
have their favorite singers at the opera or horses<br/>
on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghizereh </span>race-course. With a city covering<br/>
twelve or more square miles and having a sky-line<br/>
effect of a forest of domes and minarets, there is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>variety of places of worship to suit any<br/>
taste. Diminutive Kait Bey, in the midst of the<br/>
Tombs of the Mamelukes, is deservedly sketched<br/>
and photographed scores of times every day. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished </span>mosque of Rafai, under the citadel, contains the body of spendthrift Ismail, who ordered<br/>
its construction, but is otherwise unimportant.<br/>
The gem of the Mohammedan artistic world, admitted by good judges, is the venerable and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bair</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">haunted </span>mosque of Sultan Hassan, close to the<br/>
Rafai structure, always spoken of by the faithful<br/>
as "the superb." For architectural beauty this<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Saracenic </span>pile surpasses the Byzantine St. Sophia<br/>
at Constantinople. Its vast circular dome, springing from a square tower, with corner pendentives<br/>
of marvelous design, is a liberal education in architecture, although fashioned more than five hundred years ago. The Sultan Hassan mosque is one<br/>
of the several artistic structures known to travelers<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the tale is told that the designer was put<br/>
to death or had his hands out off by his <span style="color: #0000FF;">appreciative </span>master to prevent a repetition of his artistic<br/>
triumph.<br/>
<br/>
The pencil-like minarets of the Mehemet Ali<br/>
mosque, visible long before one reaches Cairo, are<br/>
