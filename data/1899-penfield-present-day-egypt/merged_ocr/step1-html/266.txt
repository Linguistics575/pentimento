footed the remains of their former lord and master;<br/>
but orders from Abdin Palace ultimately forbade<br/>
so public a manifestation of their grief. For fully<br/>
a week before the funeral there had been a nightly<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">wake </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">n </span>at Kasr el-Ali Palace by these women.<br/>
When abreast of the heroic statue of Ibrahim<br/>
Pasha, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismail</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>father, in the opera square, Khedive<br/>
Abbas left the cortege, and was taken to Abdin by<br/>
carriage. The diplomatic body and many of the<br/>
Europeans left the procession at the same time,<br/>
while the thousands wended their way slowly to the<br/>
mosque of Sultan Hassan, where the usual prayers<br/>
were recited, and then to the mosque of Rafai,<br/>
opposite. There, beside the tombs of his mother and<br/>
two of his daughters, Ismail was finally laid to rest<br/>
in the mausoleum which he had designed for <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself</span>, but which will probably never be completed.<br/>
The foundations of the huge pile are already showing signs of subsidence-a monument perhaps not<br/>
altogether inappropriate to the man whose life,<br/>
after a brief period of artificial splendor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ebbed<br/>
</span>drearily away amid the ruins of his shattered ambitions. Ismail had planned to have the new Rafai<br/>
mosque eclipse in beauty and vastness the Sultan<br/>
Hassan mosque, long regarded as the most perfect<br/>
example of architecture in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mussulman </span>world;<br/>
but his <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>disaster interrupted the work when<br/>
only the outer walls and roof had been completed.<br/>
