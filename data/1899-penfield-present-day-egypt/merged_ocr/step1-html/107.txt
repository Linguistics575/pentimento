<span>Alexandria, Seat of Commerce<br/>
<br/>
soldiers of the shattered Turkish supremacy in<br/>
Egypt, who had retired with sulky scorn from<br/>
Alexandria to a quarter of their own, on what once<br/>
was the island of Pharos, Mehemet Ali united them<br/>
with his Albanian troops, and found he had then<br/>
the unbreakable backbone of an army of fighters,<br/>
few in number, it is true, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>powerful<br/>
with his cunning to overthrow the Mamelukes <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruling </span>at Cairo. The fearless Rumelian then organized<br/>
the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>,--and by<br/>
sheer genius welded into something, approaching a<br/>
nationality these discordant elements. The renaissance of Egypt and the revival of Alexandria's<br/>
fortunes date, consequently, from the coming of<br/>
Mehemet Ali. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>loved the city and made it his<br/>
capital.<br/>
<br/>
Bis master mind recognizing the need of connecting the seaport with the Nile, this autocrat<br/>
traced a line fifty miles long <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>a map, and two<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>hundred and fifty thousand fellaheen, working<br/>
without pay or food from their dictator, in a year<br/>
scooped out of the sand with their hands the trench<br/>
known as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahmudiyeh </span>Canal. Thirty thousand of the peasants died before the canal was<br/>
completed, but it brought fresh water and a nation's<br/>
commerce to Alexandria.<br/>
<br/>
As <span style="color: #0000FF;">vicer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oyai </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mehemet </span>Ali sought to make <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">g1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eat </span>in trade. To this end, before providing palaces, he improved the harbor and erected<br/>
warehouses, docks, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dry-dock</span>, and an arsenal. To<br/>
accomplish these things, and to develop irrigation<br/>
in the Delta, he had the assistance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Linant </span>Pasha<br/>
