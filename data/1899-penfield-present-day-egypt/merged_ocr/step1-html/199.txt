equable flow. It was Joseph who conceived the<br/>
idea of turning the surplus waters of high Nile into<br/>
that vast depression in the desert to the southwest<br/>
of the Fayum, creating thereby the Lake Moeris<br/>
of ancient history.<br/>
<br/>
A delving American, Mr. Cope Whitehouse, capable of intelligently <span style="color: #0000FF;">exploring </span>both the desert and<br/>
moldy manuscripts and maps in Italian libraries,<br/>
showed the khedive's engineers a few years ago how<br/>
again to store the flood of the Nile in the same<br/>
desert depression-or that part of it known as<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wady-Rayan-by </span>utilizing J oseph's Canal,<br/>
which leaves the Nile at Assiut and conveys the<br/>
water of life to the Fayum. But the Englishmen<br/>
guiding the Egyptian chariot of state having no<br/>
wish to divide honors with J oseph, however worthy<br/>
as an irrigationist, nor with Mr. Whitehouse, the<br/>
latter was formally thanked <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>his scholarly suggestion, decorated by the khedive as a Grand Commander of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medjidieh-and </span>the Englishmen<br/>
proceeded with their studies preliminary to the<br/>
Assuan dam.<br/>
<br/>
To comprehend the importance of present-day<br/>
irrigation in Egypt, it must be borne in mind that<br/>
the country owes its fertility solely to the Nile. Its<br/>
agriculture, even the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span>'s existence, depends<br/>
on irrigation, for Egypt is practically rainless.<br/>
Wherever the Nile water can be regularly supplied<br/>
to the soil, the most bountiful crops follow, which,<br/>
like cotton and sugar, command high prices because<br/>
of their excellence. Indeed, with a reliable supply<br/>
of water, farming in the Nile country can be pur<br/>
