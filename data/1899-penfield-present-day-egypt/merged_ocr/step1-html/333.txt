<span>Britain's Position in Egypt<br/>

management it should eventually become a contributor to the Cairo exchequer.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting to observe, by recorded <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>utterances and the sequence of events, how the retention of Egypt by Great Britain could not have been<br/>
seriously considered until years after the occupation had been entered upon. Oftentimes it is entertaining to follow the development of an idea,<br/>
especially one having for its consummation a result<br/>
or condition the very opposite of the purpose <span style="color: #0000FF;">declared </span>at the outset. To begin the evolution of the<br/>
idea of permanently retaining Egypt, it is instructive to state that the Gladstone government, which<br/>
sent the troops and ships to Egypt in 1882, asserted<br/>
that British intervention was made solely in the<br/>
interests of humanity, and for the purpose of suppressing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabi </span>rebellion and restoring the authority of the khedive. These pledges, although<br/>
addressed to no <span style="color: #ff0000;">speeifle </span>government, were accepted<br/>
in Europe in good faith.<br/>
<br/>
A few hours before opening the bombardment of<br/>
Alexandria, the commander of the British fleet said,<br/>
in a formal communication to Khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik</span>:<br/>
"I deem it opportune to reaffirm to your Highness<br/>
that the government of Great Britain has no intention to effect the conquest of Egypt, nor to interfere in any way with the liberties or religion of<br/>
the Egyptians; its sole object is to protect your<br/>
Highness and the Egyptian people from the rebels."<br/>
