<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
to this time it is dry, and, full or empty, it is little<br/>
more than a sanitary abomination in these days;<br/>
but in former times, when the Nile was high enough<br/>
to flow down its bed, it was taken by the people as<br/>
proof that the yearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood </span>was coming, and that<br/>
the kindly fruits of the earth would quickly follow.<br/>
<br/>
The head of the Khalig, on the road to Old Cairo,<br/>
is closed by an earthwork embankment weeks <span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>the function. As the festival draws near,<br/>
elaborate preparations are made for its celebration;<br/>
tents with innumerable lamps are erected on one<br/>
side of the canal, while the opposite bank is lined<br/>
with frames for fireworks. All the notables of the<br/>
capital, civic, religious, and military, in gorgeous<br/>
uniforms and <span style="color: #0000FF;">canonicals</span>, attend the festivity. The<br/>
khedive, or a minister representing him, is there,<br/>
as are the Sheik <span style="color: #0000FF;">11 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>Islam (the highest dignitary<br/>
of the Mohammedan faith), the Sheik e1 Bekri, and<br/>
the acknowledged descendant of the prophet, the<br/>
Sheik es Sadat. El-Azhar is represented by its<br/>
learned priests and scribes, the Egyptian government by cabinet <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>and secretaries, and foreign powers by their diplomatic and consular <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mieials</span>. The sirdar and his staff, judges from the<br/>
international and native courts, and a sprinkling<br/>
of functionaries from governmental departments<br/>
and bureaus, complete the picturesque and heterogeneous gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Egyptian regiments are turned out, salutes are<br/>
fired, and by eight <span style="color: #0000FF;">o'clock </span>in the evening, when<br/>
the ceremony <span style="color: #0000FF;">officially </span>commences, there may be<br/>
twenty or thirty thousand spectators massed on<br/>
<br/>
70<br/>
