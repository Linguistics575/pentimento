<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
varies from five eighths of a mile to fourteen<br/>
miles. The name "Egypt" is of Greek origin.<br/>
According to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brugsch</span>, it is corrupted from the<br/>
hieroglyphic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ba-ka-pta</span>, that is, "House of the Worship of Ptah," the Creator of the world. The name<br/>
in vogue among the ancient Egyptians was Chemi,<br/>
meaning "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Black </span>Country," derived from the color<br/>
of the Nile mud. Among the Hebrews Egypt was<br/>
called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Masar</span>, the Mizraim of the Bible; and the<br/>
Arabs of to-day call it <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mast</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>name applies<br/>
especially to Cairo, the capital. The Turks call the<br/>
country <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gript</span>, which is evidently an abbreviation of<br/>
the Greek Aigyptos.<br/>
<br/>
Ten or twelve years ago Egypt was insolvent.<br/>
To-day she is easy with prosperity. The position<br/>
of the fellaheen is constantly improving. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">corv√©e </span>is abolished, and the people have no more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">compulsory </span>labor, except to keep the Nile within<br/>
bounds at high flood, for <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they are paid.<br/>
Slavery is forbidden by khedival <span style="color: #0000FF;">decree</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">land-taxes<br/>
</span>are gradually being reduced, and extortion and corruption seem to have been stamped out. Egypt<br/>
sells cereals enough to pay for the imported articles<br/>
necessary to maintain her simple standard of life.<br/>
<br/>
The population of Egypt is a theme that has interested more than one generation of observers and<br/>
writers. Under the Ptolemies we are asked to believe that the country <span style="color: #ff0000;">hid </span>20,000,000 people; but<br/>
it is fairly authentic that Napoleon found only<br/>
2,500,000 when he went there in 1798. At that<br/>
time they had long been ground down into hopeless<br/>
degradation and poverty to pander to the luxury<br/>
