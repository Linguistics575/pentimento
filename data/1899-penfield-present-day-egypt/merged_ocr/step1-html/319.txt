<span>The Present Khedival Family<br/>
<br/>
the governor-general's at Algiers, so often painted<br/>
by great artists, and is claimed to be a pageant<br/>
equal to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroyal </span>ball at Calcutta. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">khedive</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>annual ball occurs usually in J <span style="color: #ff0000;">anuary </span>or<br/>
February, and brings together representative types<br/>
of nearly every race of Europe, Africa, and Asia,<br/>
with a very liberal sprinkling of Americans.<br/>
Conspicuous in the medley of brilliant uniforms<br/>
are those of diplomatic celebrities and the leaders<br/>
of the Egyptian army and the army of occupation,<br/>
glittering with orders. There are present <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials<br/>
</span>of every hue of countenance, including mudirs and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">omdehs </span>from distant Egyptian provinces, Bedouin<br/>
sheiks from the Red Sea coast, and perhaps Indian<br/>
princes breaking their journey to or from England<br/>
for a few weeks' participation in the gaieties of the<br/>
khedival city. Abbas <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pasha</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>hostship elicits general admiration. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>receives those hidden to the<br/>
festivity with a graceful cordiality, and makes a<br/>
point of displaying his gallantry to the ladies of the<br/>
diplomatic corps, whose pleasant duty it is to stand<br/>
by his side and receive with him. The dancing<br/>
begun, he appears to find much satisfaction in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">watching </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">moving </span>figures in one of the most<br/>
beautiful ball-rooms in the world. A box of generous proportions, duly screened, is <span style="color: #ff0000;">filled'With </span>the<br/>
ladies of the khedival family, who watch the brilliant scene, <span style="color: #0000FF;">unperceived </span>by those participating in<br/>
it. The supper is a liberal education in gastronomy.<br/>
