the actual sovereign of the country, to surrender<br/>
his throne and go into exile. Foreseeing the<br/>
crash, Ismail had sold his personal shares in the<br/>
canal to the British government for twenty million<br/>
dollars, and on these the Egyptian treasury faithfully paid England five per cent. interest for twenty<br/>
years. This purchase illustrated Lord Beaconsfield's shrewdness, for by prompt action he prevented these shares from going to France. To-day<br/>
they are worth more than four times what was<br/>
paid for them, and secure to England the voting<br/>
control in canal affairs. The stipulation in the<br/>
concession that Egypt should receive fifteen per<br/>
cent. of the tolls had also been marketed, Ismail<br/>
pledging this consideration as <span style="color: #0000FF;">security </span>on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>to<br/>
borrow a few millions when the French company<br/>
could raise no more money. Thus, having no<br/>
maritime interests, and possessing not a share in<br/>
the enterprise, no pecuniary benefit can accrue to<br/>
the Egyptian people from the Suez Canal. And,<br/>
further, it can be conjectured that, had Ismail not<br/>
burdened his subjects with overwhelming indebtedness, thereby breeding discontent, there would<br/>
have been no European interference with Egyptian<br/>

rebellion, and no British army of occupation.<br/>

The idea of a water communication between the<br/>
Mediterranean and the Red Sea is as old as history, and nearly every ruler of Egypt, from Seti,<br/>
father of Rameses the Great, to Napoleon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bonaparte</span>, gave attention to the problem, with varying degrees of success. Strabo asserted that Seti,<br/>
