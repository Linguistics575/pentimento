<span>Story of the Suez Canal<br/>
<br/>
struct a ship-canal across his territory. This soldier who had founded a dynasty by successive deeds<br/>
of bravery, and had butchered three or four hundred Mamelukes whom he had asked to a feast,<br/>
could not have been suspected of lacking in daring; but he never fully yielded to the blandishments of foreigners striving to get him interested<br/>
in isthmian canalization. His <span style="color: #ff0000;">sagaeio11s </span>intellect<br/>
kept him from embarking therein, save in a tentative way. The discovery in 1830, by Lieutenant<br/>
Waghorn, that the level of the two seas was nearly<br/>
identical, failed even to impress the hard-headed<br/>
Viceroy. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>commissioned Linant Pasha, however,<br/>
to prepare a plan for a canal across the narrowest<br/>
part of the isthmus, from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tilreh </span>to Suez; but<br/>
as this Frenchman accepted the survey of Bonaparte's engineers, and discredited the statement of<br/>
Waghorn as to the level of the waters, the viceroy still withheld his <span style="color: #0000FF;">confidence </span>from the scheme.<br/>
In 1846 he asked a board of engineers, comprising<br/>
representatives of England, France, and Austria, to<br/>
solve once for all the question of the sea-levels.<br/>
These experts confirmed the judgment of the Englishman, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Waghorn</span>; but the British member of the<br/>
board, the renowned Robert Stephenson, with his<br/>
instinct for railway-making, persuaded Mehemet<br/>
Ali to construct instead a railway from Cairo to<br/>
Suez, in connection with the line from Alexandria.<br/>
This was done, and it formed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">connecting-link<br/>
</span>between Europe and the East, and brought great<br/>
profit, and no political dangers, to Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime another mind <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>occupied<br/>
