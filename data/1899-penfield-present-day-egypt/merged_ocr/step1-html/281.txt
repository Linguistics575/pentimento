<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>lips have uttered these words in a manner<br/>
carrying authority, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">craven </span>would have laid his<br/>
weapon at the feet of his <span style="color: #ff0000;">effendina </span>and kissed the<br/>
skirt of his garment-and the Arabi rebellion would<br/>
have been stifled while yet in innocent embryo,<br/>
and a dark chapter in Egyptian history would have<br/>
been avoided. But the khedive's tongue was as if<br/>
paralyzed. A word to the troops, later, would have<br/>
caused a <span style="color: #0000FF;">reaffirmation </span>of their loyalty; and, had<br/>

<br/>
To Mehemet Ali the incident would have been<br/>
but a playful moment, and he would have pistoled<br/>
the leader instantly. Ismail Pasha, even, would<br/>
have dealt with it no less <span style="color: #0000FF;">conclusively</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, but in a<br/>
different way. But the father and great-grandfather of Khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik </span>were men of impulse and<br/>
quick action.<br/>
<br/>
After his easy triumph at Abdin, the dreamy<br/>
Arabi became a bustling bully, full of his own importance, and displaying more than usual igno<br/>
