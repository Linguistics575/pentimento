</span>and feels <span style="color: #0000FF;">justified </span>in giving it the character of a<br/>
public spectacle. This is the conservative Egyptian, who sees nothing good in the movement <span style="color: #ff0000;">Europeanizing </span>his beloved Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
Men of the wealthy classes are becoming daily<br/>
less and less Oriental in appearance and habits.<br/>
They wear clothes of Parisian make, pose before<br/>
the photographer's camera, speak fluent French,<br/>
dance with foreign ladies, <span style="color: #0000FF;">flirt </span>a little, and profess<br/>
to think "<span style="color: #ff0000;">five-o'eloek </span>tea" an institution <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflecting<br/>
</span>the highest civilization. Each has his stall at the<br/>
opera, and applauds at the right time. Between<br/>
acts he calls on friends of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mut </span>ton in their<br/>
boxes, and perhaps recruits a coaching or river<br/>
party for the following day. If the visitors are<br/>
from abroad, the courteous native most likely <span style="color: #0000FF;">will<br/>
</span>explain that as a lad he witnessed the premier production of "Aida" in that very theater, Verdi's<br/>
opera being an item in the program arranged by<br/>
Ismail for the edifieation of the Empress Eugenie<br/>
and other distinguished guests attending the opening of the Suez Canal. If the visitors are from<br/>
Alexandria only, the Cairo gentleman probably<br/>
rings the changes on the contrasting temperature<br/>
of the two cities, wondering how Alexandrians<br/>
can stand the excessive humidity of the coast.<br/>
The visitors retaliate by claiming that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">superdryness </span>of the capital affects their health, <span style="color: #0000FF;">whereas<br/>
</span>in Alexandria they are always well. Thus the<br/>
weather, in its humid aspect, is sadly overworked<br/>
as a topic of small talk in the country having the<br/>
best and driest climate in the world. If this <span style="color: #0000FF;">ac<br/>
