<br/>
to flow into the national purse; and at the end of<br/>
only ninety-nine years the <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>enterprise<br/>
would belong to Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">!<br/>
<br/>
</span>The concession gave M. de Lesseps, and "La<br/>
Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de<br/>
Suez," to be created by him, the monopoly of<br/>
operating a waterway to be constructed in a direct<br/>
line across the isthmus, utilizing the chain of Bitter Lakes on the south, and intersecting on the<br/>
north the vast marsh called Lake Menzaleh. In no<br/>
sense was the arrangement a contract involving any<br/>
obligation on Egypt, and it was stipulated that at<br/>
the end of the period for which the concession was<br/>
given everything was to revert to the Egyptian<br/>
government, on payment of the actual value of improvements on the banks of the canal, as determined<br/>
by arbitration. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">concessionaries </span>were also to<br/>
build at their own cost a smaller canal from the Nile<br/>
to the line of the ship-canal, primarily to supply the<br/>
work-people with fresh water, and ultimately for<br/>
commercial purposes. To prevent bringing to his<br/>
country thousands of laborers, representing the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flotsam </span>and jetsam of southern Europe, and mercenaries of all shades, the Viceroy exacted the right<br/>
of furnishing native laborers if he chose, at a<br/>
nominal expense to the company; and it was agreed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the latter that the fellaheen diggers would be<br/>
fed and have all necessary medical and hospital<br/>
facilities.<br/>
<br/>
It was stipulated and reiterated that all these<br/>
conditions, as well as the concession itself, should<br/>
be valid only when the Sultan of Turkey, the suze<br/>
