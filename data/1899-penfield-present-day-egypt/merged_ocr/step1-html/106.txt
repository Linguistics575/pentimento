<br/>
works of importance were made at public expense,<br/>
and it is stated that every book that came into the<br/>
city was seized and kept, a copy only being handed<br/>
to the owner. Scholars from many lands made<br/>
Alexandria their abiding-place, to enjoy the <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefits </span>of the priceless books and parchments. Strabo<br/>
and Euclid studied there. When the fanatical <span style="color: #ff0000;">calif<br/>
</span>Omar <span style="color: #0000FF;">overrun </span>Egypt, in the seventh century, he<br/>
proclaimed that, as the Koran contained everything<br/>
that man should know, other books had no right to<br/>
exist. Consequently he decreed that the second<br/>
great library to bring renown to Alexandria should<br/>
forthwith be destroyed. It is recorded that seven<br/>
hundred thousand manuscripts and volumes in all<br/>
languages were apportioned to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eity</span>'s four thousand public bathing establishments, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the<br/>
fires of these were fed for six months. This was,<br/>
indeed, the most crushing blow ever inflicted on<br/>
literature.<br/>
<br/>
Ruled now by Persian, now by Roman, now by<br/>
Greek, and enervated by vice and luxury, and with<br/>
the loss of population and prestige that preceded<br/>
the stagnation and decay spreading over the centuries from Cleopatra to Mehemet Ali, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria's<br/>
</span>varying welfare could not be detailed within the<br/>
limits of a sketchy chapter. The death-blow to its<br/>
fortunes was the discovery, in 1497, of the passage<br/>
round the Cape of Good Hope, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>changed the<br/>
direction of the commerce of the East.<br/>
<br/>
The Alexandria that visitors see dates only from<br/>
the beginning of the nineteenth century, with the<br/>
advent of Mehemet Ali. Taking the leaderless<br/>
