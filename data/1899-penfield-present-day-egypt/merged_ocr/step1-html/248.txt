fore <span style="color: #ff0000;">eamre11ltivation </span>had practically begun; new<br/>
sections of Cairo were laid out and the land donated<br/>
to those promising to erect houses; the harbor of<br/>
Alexandria was deepened and enlarged; elaborate<br/>
schemes for irrigation were organized; and, in fact,<br/>
everything appropriate and inappropriate was done<br/>
to transform Egypt into a part of <span style="color: #ff0000;">EurOpe</span>, as far<br/>
as enlightenment and prosperity <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>concerned.<br/>
Money was borrowed and spent blindly. Much<br/>
of it stuck to greedy and dishonest hands, and<br/>
Ismail's reign may be said to have been the golden<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">age </span>for the most clever and unscrupulous adventurers from every part of the world.1<br/>
