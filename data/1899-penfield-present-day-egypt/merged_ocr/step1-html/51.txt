<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
his religious fervor finds expression only during<br/>
the tourist season-to the little mosque on the<br/>
Nile bank midway between Kasr el-Ain and Old<br/>
Cairo, and witness the weekly aik'r of these fiends.<br/>
Sitting in a circle on the stone floor of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">highvaulted </span>room are the dervishes, twenty or thirty<br/>
in number. Their bearded leader, <span style="color: #0000FF;">spectacled</span>, and<br/>
grave under his green turban, squats on a mat<br/>
in the center. Standing outside the circle is a<br/>
smooth and oily-faced old man, with a simple reed<br/>
flute, flanked by others with large tom-toms. Clustered along two sides of the room are tourists, costumed in a way that would delight an arranger of<br/>
up-to-date melodrama of the spectacular variety.<br/>
Ladies, having misgivings as to what the entertainment is to be, seem to wish to sit behind the men,<br/>
until the hotel dragomans having the visit in charge<br/>
assure them that it is to be "very <span style="color: #0000FF;">nice-very </span>nice,<br/>
yes! Mrs. Vanderbilt of Chicago she come last<br/>
week, yes!"<br/>
<br/>
A hush of silence falls over dervishes and tourists,<br/>
and the leader mumbles a prayer. The circle of<br/>
performers break into response; first in quiet, measured tones, then faster, faster, faster. Their bodies<br/>
sway in perfect unison as, now growing vociferous,<br/>
they affirm the creed of Islam. Faster, faster go<br/>
the bodies, and the wild chant of "Allah la <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ilaha</span>,"<br/>
in perfect cadence, is becoming a volume like that<br/>
of Niagara. The leader raises a <span style="color: #0000FF;">warning </span>hand, and<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hush </span>that <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows </span>instantly is broken only by<br/>
the cooing of doves resting on the ledges of the<br/>
windows in the dome. Then, low and mysterious,<br/>
