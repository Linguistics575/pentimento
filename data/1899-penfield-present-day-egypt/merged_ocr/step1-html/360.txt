<br/>
ity is combined with a run of abnormally warm<br/>
weather. The period of comparatively cold weather,<br/>
six weeks at most, commences early in <span style="color: #0000FF;">January</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i<br/>
</span>From April until the end of <span style="color: #0000FF;">June </span>the increase <span style="color: #ff0000;">of</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>heat is gradual, the maximum being reached <span style="color: #ff0000;">usu-'<br/>
</span>ally by <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">uly </span>1; but in some years the highest<br/>
temperature is not recorded until August or September. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>khamsin period sets in by<br/>
the middle of February, with its parching desert<br/>
winds, freighted with impalpable particles of sand<br/>
that cannot be excluded by door or window. Wherever air has access, there the khamsin leaves its<br/>
layer of dust. The word <span style="color: #0000FF;">tt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">khamsin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>is Arabic for<br/>
"fifty," and the belief is that this is the number of<br/>
days prior to the summer solstice when the scorching winds are liable to occur. A khamsin generally<br/>
lasts two days, but a season seldom sees more than<br/>
eight or ten days of these sand-storms. It is nothing to be dreaded, beyond making it desirable to<br/>
remain indoors during its prevalence. Sufferers<br/>
from certain forms of asthma even profess to enjoy<br/>
a khamsin day.<br/>
<br/>
It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to believe that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">increased </span>canalization and the added area of vegetation are contributing to a diminution of the<br/>
frequency and force of the khamsin, when one <span style="color: #0000FF;">real..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">izes </span>the overwhelming expanse of desert in which<br/>
these winds have uninterrupted play. Like the<br/>
severity of New England winters, the force of the<br/>
khamsin in the Nile valley has manifestly been modified in recent years. Those who wrote of Egypt a<br/>
hundred or even fifty years ago emphasized their<br/>
