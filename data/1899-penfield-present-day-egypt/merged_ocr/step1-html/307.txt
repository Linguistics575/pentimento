<span>The Present Khedival Family<br/>
<br/>
seasons since, it was arranged that a <span style="color: #0000FF;">field-review<br/>
</span>be given of the Egyptian troops quartered in the<br/>
capital, in honor of the famous <span style="color: #0000FF;">commander-in-chief<br/>
</span>of Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vietoria</span>'s army. The proposition came<br/>
from Britishers in the Egyptian service, those who<br/>
believe that Egypt would go to the eternal bowwows were it not for the fostering hand of England<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Bis Highness the Khedive was to be present, as<br/>
nominal commander of the army.<br/>
<br/>
All Cairo was at Abbassieh, on horseback or in<br/>
carriages, to see the manoeuvers. The khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">galloped </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">011 </span>to the parade-ground with his aides, and<br/>
immediately took command of the forces. The<br/>
spectators were treated to something manifestly<br/>
not on the bills, for the young Egyptian put the<br/>
soldiers through their paces in a manner <span style="color: #0000FF;">causing<br/>
</span>consternation to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieidls </span>who had intended the<br/>
khedive to play an ornamental part only in the show.<br/>
<br/>
Infantry and cavalry were hurried here and there,<br/>
the camel corps was sent across the desert to repel<br/>
an imaginary foe, and platoons of artillery were<br/>
ordered into position, and their guns belched forth<br/>
volley after volley. This mimic warfare, extending<br/>
over miles of the desert, was kept up for two hours,<br/>
and waxed so fast and furious that nearly all the<br/>
spectators had fallen by the wayside, <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>inability<br/>
to keep up, <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>before it was over. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>Royal<br/>
Highness of England had not experienced such a<br/>
shaking up for years, and when the campaign ended<br/>
did not hesitate to say that the Egyptian soldiers<br/>
were a fine lot of men, knowing every detail of a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">soldier</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>calling.<br/>
