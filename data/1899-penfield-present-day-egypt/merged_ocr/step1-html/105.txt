<span>Alexandria, Seat of Commerce<br/>
<br/>
beacon-fires were burned by night as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>guide and<br/>
warning to mariners. This pile of masonry, of<br/>
greater proportions than the Washington Monument, reared when the world was young, naturally<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>included in the list of wonderful structures;<br/>
it was termed the seventh wonder of the earth.<br/>
Ptolemy Soter likewise connected Pharos with the<br/>
city by the Heptastadium <span style="color: #0000FF;">causeway</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>bringing the<br/>
island within easier reach, and dividing the intervening space into two harbors. The action of <span style="color: #ff0000;">seacurrents </span>for centuries has supplemented building<br/>
operations from time to time, and the causeway has<br/>
so long been a feature of the city that few dwellers in<br/>
modern Alexandria are aware of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>origin.<br/>
<br/>
Ptolemy Soter was also responsible for making<br/>
Alexandria a seat of learning, and for the creation<br/>
of the world-famous library and museum. He<br/>
brought there many of the wise men of Europe,<br/>
and through his efforts Alexandria for years<br/>
occupied the leading place in literature, philosophy,<br/>
and science. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>son and successor, Ptolemy Philadelphus, continued the wise policy, and Ptolemy<br/>
Euergetes made his reign famous for the encouragement given to learning. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span>brought to<br/>
Alexandria, among other great personages, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aristophanes </span>of Byzantium, who became keeper of the<br/>
library. When the Romans laid siege to the city<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cassar</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>time, both library and museum were<br/>
ruthlessly burned. As a foundation for a<span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>second<br/>
library, Antony presented Cleopatra with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pergamenian </span>manuscripts, two hundred thousand in<br/>
number. The collection grew rapidly. Copies of<br/>
