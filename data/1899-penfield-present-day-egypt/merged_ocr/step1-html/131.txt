<span>Paradoxical Administration<br/>
<br/>
America was accepted by Congress and the President in 1832; but this sort of international treaty<br/>
antedates <span style="color: #0000FF;">America</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>discovery.<br/>
<br/>
The intercourse of the Christian world with the<br/>
Mohammedan is not founded upon the law of<br/>
nations. International law, as professed by the<br/>
nations of Christendom, is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">offspring </span>of the communion of ideas subsisting between them, and is<br/>
based upon a common origin and an almost identical religious faith. Between the peoples of Islam<br/>
and those of Europe and America there exists no<br/>
such communion of ideas and principles from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>a true international law could spring. Inasmuch<br/>
as the propagation of Islam is the chief aim of all<br/>
Moslems, perpetual warfare against Christians and<br/>
other unbelievers, to convert them or subject them<br/>
to the payment of tribute, was regarded as the most<br/>
sacred duty of the Mohammedan. From his point<br/>
of view the whole world is divided into two parts<br/>
-the house of Islam, and the conglomerate mass<br/>
of unbelievers. Yet the Moslem felt that perpetual<br/>
war with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">infidel </span>was not possible, and that conventions should be made for the advantage of both.<br/>

Commerce, the source of wealth and the means<br/>
of satisfying some of the most imperative needs of<br/>
mankind, could not be carried on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Witheut </span>deviating from the severity of the maxims that were pro. fessed. Either the destruction of one of the two<br/>
peoples must have ensued, or else these maxims<br/>
must be departed from, the Moslems saw. But a<br/>
subterfuge was resorted to to escape the severe<br/>
conditions, whereby a <span style="color: #0000FF;">conflict </span>with the doctrine of<br/>
