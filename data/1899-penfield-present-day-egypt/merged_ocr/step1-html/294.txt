<span>CHAPTER IX<br/>
THE PRESENT <span style="color: #0000FF;">KHEDIVE </span>AND KHEDIVAL FAMILY<br/>
<br/>
IS Highness Abbas Hilmi II <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>born in<br/>
Cairo on J uly <span style="color: #ff0000;">14,1874</span>, and succeeded to the<br/>
khedivate at the age of eighteen. Estimates of his<br/>
character are never indefinite, for he is liked or disliked intensely-it depends upon the point of view<br/>
from Which the judgment is'formed. The public<br/>
relying upon English newspapers for knowledge<br/>
of persons and events has no doubt regarding the<br/>
intractable nature of the khedive. The human mind<br/>
in time accepts as facts, concrete and unyielding,<br/>
what is heard and read for years. The unattractive<br/>
side of Abbas Pasha from the day he came to the<br/>
khedivate has frequently been paraded in English<br/>
prints. Hence the majority of English people do<br/>
not like him. They believe they know him, but<br/>
manifestly do not. Yet no people on earth so persistently demand fair play as our British cousins.<br/>
The opinion of Abbas held in the British Isles is<br/>
the outcome of political exigencies. Whenever an<br/>
Egyptian "<span style="color: #0000FF;">incident</span>" calls for <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieial </span>attention in<br/>
London, Fleet Street is moved to applaud England's<br/>
foreign policy, and decry the khedive whose rebellious spirit has led him to show by manner 01' word<br/>
