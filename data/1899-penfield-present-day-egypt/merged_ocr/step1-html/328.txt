Austria, by reason of being the Sultan's nearest<br/>
neighbor, chooses to keep her hands free from the<br/>
Egyptian imbroglio from politic motives. Hence<br/>
it is no longer necessary for Englishmen to pretend<br/>
that the occupation will end when Egypt "becomes<br/>
capable of self-government," or when "normal conditions in the country have been restored." Nothing but England's voluntary action can bring<br/>
