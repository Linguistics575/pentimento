<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
time to close the gates of Saladin's stronghold, and<br/>
you are awakened to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fact </span>that your table <span style="color: #ff0000;">d'lufte<br/>
</span>dinner begins in thirty minutes, and you must array<br/>
yourself in conventional evening garb before you<br/>
can partake thereof.<br/>
<br/>
The suburbs have a double charm to students of<br/>
the Bible. A visit to the Shubra road, the Corso of<br/>
Cairo until fashion decreed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghizereh </span>drive, at<br/>
sunset, will illustrate the scriptural <span style="color: #0000FF;">allusions </span>to the<br/>
sheep and the goats; and a pleasing picture may<br/>
there be seen of the shepherd bearing in his arms<br/>
a lamb or kid too feeble to keep pace with the<br/>
herd. The scene might have been taken from an<br/>
engraving in an old Bible. One will not proceed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">far </span>without seeing devout Moslems engaged in<br/>
eventide prayer on the housetops. The wine-skin<br/>
of old was the same as that used now by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">watercarrier</span>, seen a hundred times a day in Cairo, enabling one to comprehend the simile of new wine in<br/>
old bottles. Aged men about the mosques and<br/>
bazaars are appareled to-day as they were in Abraham's time, carrying the same staves; and the scribe,<br/>
with inkhorn and pens of reed in girdle, joins the<br/>
throng in the Khan Halil to-day, and frowns upon<br/>
the outcast <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ew</span>, as did the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharisee </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">publican</span>. A few minutes' walk from the hotels<br/>
brings one face to face with the living Bible; a few<br/>
minutes' drive in another direction may bring one<br/>
face to face with the grotesque characters of a<br/>
hotel costume ball, with petits chevaux for a diversion between dances. Cairo is paradoxical as well<br/>
as fascinating.<br/>
