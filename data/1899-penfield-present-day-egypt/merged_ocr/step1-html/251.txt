<span>Ismail as Khedive and Exile<br/>
<br/>
Egypt was solvent, whereupon Ismail invited them<br/>
to appoint a commission to investigate the <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial<br/>
</span>condition of his country. This commission proved<br/>
his ruin; for, while it acknowledged that the country was unable to pay the rate of interest until then<br/>
demanded, and reduced it from seven to four per<br/>
cent., it likewise declared that the economic crisis<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>due wholly to the extravagance of Ismail.<br/>
<br/>
To prove his good will and patriotism, the khedive surrendered private estates and plantations to<br/>
the value of <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>million dollars; but this<br/>
was not all that the foreign governments and bondholders demanded, They insisted on further <span style="color: #ff0000;">sacrifiees</span>, not only of a financial but also of a political<br/>
character, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the khedive could not agree;<br/>
whereupon they invited the aid of the Sultan, who<br/>
had always resented the spirit of independence<br/>
displayed by his powerful <span style="color: #0000FF;">vessel</span>, and obtained a<br/>
firman deposing Ismail, and placing on the throne<br/>
his eldest son, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pri11ce </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik</span>. This was in the closing days of June, in 1879; and within a week of<br/>
his degradation Ismail left Egypt for Naples.<br/>
<br/>
To the last, Ismail seemed unconscious of having<br/>
<br/>
something out of him, they continued to push him to take their gold,<br/>
and to mortgage Egypt, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">pawn </span>his state and <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>private properties<br/>
up to their utmost value, renewing greedily his bonds until they<br/>
found it more advantageous to liquidate his estate. Had his been<br/>
the case of an ordinary mortal, a court of law would have reduced<br/>
the outrageous claims to fair and just proportions. But he was a<br/>
sovereign, and his creditors were the kings of Jews, or rather the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ews </span>of kings, and powerful enough to bring to bear the authority of<br/>
their respective governments to enforce their claims by every means<br/>
