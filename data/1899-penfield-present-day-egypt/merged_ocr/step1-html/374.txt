the cataract that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philaps </span>charm must necessarily<br/>

African in character, and a mine of entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
If not an out-and-out invalid, one is certain to<br/>
go several times to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philas</span>. I should urge the visitor<br/>
to make at least one trip by <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-baek</span>. In this<br/>
way one can take in the quarries from which the<br/>
ancient kings drew the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>obelisks and stones<br/>
for their stupendous structures. Great humps of<br/>
rich red granite crop up through the tawny sand,<br/>
and here and there are plain traces of the methods<br/>
employed by these marvelous builders in working and moving their blocks of material. A huge,<br/>
nearly completed obelisk, as large as the one in<br/>
New York or that in London, lies in situ as it<br/>
was hewn from the solid rock, from which it has<br/>
never been quite separated; it still bears the incisions for fastening the ropes and pulleys by <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>it would have been dragged to the river, half a<br/>
mile away. Its contour is perfectly outlined by<br/>
rows of oblong holes for the insertion of blocks of<br/>
soft wood, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>would have been expanded by the<br/>
application of water, breaking the monolith from<br/>
the ledge with as much certainty as it could be<br/>
accomplished to-day by explosives. The ancient<br/>
stone-workers understood the simple secrets of<br/>
natural forces, certainly. On the way back from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>, if coming by boat, a dozen other places may<br/>
be seen where vast pieces of granite have been<br/>
broken out of ledge or boulder by the primitive trick<br/>
of wetting <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfined </span>blocks of porous wood. It is<br/>
good for the moderate invalid to study the curious<br/>
