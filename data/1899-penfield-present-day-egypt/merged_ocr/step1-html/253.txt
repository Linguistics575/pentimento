<span>Ismail as Khedive and Exile<br/>
<br/>
with two of his sons, a small suite of attendants,<br/>
and the chosen ladies of the harem. As soon as the<br/>
passengers were on board, the yacht started for<br/>
Italy.<br/>
<br/>
At N <span style="color: #ff0000;">apIes </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eX-khedive </span>occupied a royal palace<br/>
and maintained a pretentious court. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>made frequent excursions to Paris, where his fat, dumpy<br/>
figure and intelligent face, surmounted by an <span style="color: #0000FF;">unusually </span>large tarboosh, were familiar to <span style="color: #ff0000;">habitués </span>of<br/>
the boulevards; for Ismail was very fond of sitting<br/>
for hours at a time at one of the little tables in<br/>
front of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Café </span>de la Paix, sipping coffee and<br/>

its fall, had crushed his friend Napoleon <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO</span>, driving him likewise to an exile from which he could<br/>
never return.<br/>

The wanderer grew in time to dislike Naples;<br/>
the neighborhood of Vesuvius affected the nerves<br/>
of the ladies of his household, and all wanted to go<br/>
elsewhere. His pleading with the Sultan for permission to visit Constantinople was finally favored,<br/>
and he was later "<span style="color: #0000FF;">induced </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>to establish himself in<br/>
a pretty palace on the European side of the Bosporus, where he might the better be watched by<br/>
the Sultan and, possibly, the British government.<br/>
As he was a vain man, he suffered greatly from<br/>
being deposed, and for years was hopeful that he<br/>
might be permitted to return to the khedivate. But<br/>
when he realized at Constantinople that he was a<br/>
