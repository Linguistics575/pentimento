<span style="color: #ff0000;">pugree</span>. "I didn't know that. Well, anyway, they<br/>
have to get an Englishman to take care of it! <span style="color: #0000FF;">j</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span>' "I<br/>
beg your pardon again," was the polite response of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Liuener </span>Bey, D. P. W.; "I have the honor of being<br/>
a native-born American <span style="color: #ff0000;">eitizeny </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">contretemps<br/>
</span>was of short duration, and as the touring Albion<br/>
took his leave he remarked, with a twinkle in his<br/>
eye: "I'm going back to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shepheard</span>'s before some<br/>

It was the countrymen <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>gentleman of the<br/>
sun-helmet, however, that made the barrage safe<br/>
and effective. Its failure could not properly be laid<br/>
at the door of Mougel, nevertheless, for Mehemet<br/>
Ali furnished him little or no support in the way<br/>
of intelligent labor. It is probable that the foundations intended by so talented a man as Mougel<br/>
would have been properly laid had skilled <span style="color: #0000FF;">work</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span>been employed; but he was allowed only <span style="color: #ff0000;">halfstarved </span>fellaheen, receiving no pay. When the<br/>
work was delayed, extra thousands of natives would<br/>
be pressed into service, only to spoil what had<br/>
already been done, it is told. Millions of tons of<br/>
stone and gravel were thrown into the river, and<br/>
on this unreliable basis was piled the vast dike<br/>
of masonry, pierced by one hundred and twenty<br/>
arches. Mehemet Ali died before it was finished,<br/>
and his successors carried the work forward in the<br/>
most desultory manner, until, in 1861, it was declared completed. Two years later the structure<br/>
