<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
The proposal to remove <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>stone by stone<br/>
was too fantastic even for the pen of a J ules Verne.<br/>
An American writer suggested that if <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philays </span>wondrous structures were to be disturbed at all, they<br/>
should be floated six hundred miles down the Nile<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">reiireeted </span>in Cairo. This, the writer urged,<br/>
would bring to the doors of the tourists' hotels one<br/>
of Egypt's greatest attractions, and carry business<br/>
enterprise to its utmost extent. This bit of sarcasm<br/>
had its effect.<br/>
<br/>
The publicity given to these absurd proposals<br/>
caused scholarly Europe and America again to protest against the threatened vandalism, and a torrent of newspaper <span style="color: #0000FF;">invective </span>was hurled at Britain's<br/>
rule of Egyptian affairs, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whioh </span>threatened to destroy<br/>
one of the world's most precious gems in order<br/>
that European holders of Egyptian bonds might be<br/>
more certain of their interest and security. The<br/>
reservoir project was now in danger of drifting into<br/>
European politics, and it was wisely concluded in<br/>
Cairo and London to let the matter drop from publie notice for a few years.<br/>
