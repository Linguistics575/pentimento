<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
This burden, applying to a community purely<br/>
agricultural, where manual labor is worth from<br/>
fifteen to twenty cents a day, and to a tillable area<br/>
estimated at ten thousand <span style="color: #ff0000;">fiviy </span>hundred square<br/>
miles, is almost overpowering. It means a per<br/>
capita debt of $ 52.20, accepting the late official <span style="color: #0000FF;">census </span>to be correct. The count of 1882 showed the<br/>
indebtedness to be $ 72.70, but the last census aids<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">England</span>'s desire to make a statistical showing of<br/>
progress. The too liberal inclusion of <span style="color: #ff0000;">desertdwellers </span>and Sudanese in the statement of population has little real bearing upon the condition<br/>
of the agricultural native. But, accepting the pro<br/>
rata debt as $ 52.20, that obligation of the Nilot is<br/>
more than the present or half a dozen generations<br/>
can discharge. Even the Turk or the Greek<br/>
does not owe as much. Frenchmen and Englishmen owe considerably more than the Egyptians,<br/>
but their resources and earning capacity are incomparably greater, and their creditors are their own<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">countrypeople</span>. The public debt of the United<br/>
States, recently emerged from a costly foreign war,<br/>
shows a per capita obligation of only about $ 19.<br/>

Egyptian securities ruled very low in the year of<br/>
the Arabi rebellion, and the year following, in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>occurred the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fiaseo </span>in the Sudan. "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Unifieds</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>for a time were quoted at <span style="color: #0000FF;">461</span>, and an average price for months for nearly every class of<br/>
Egyptian securities was 50, meaning that prudent<br/>
investors would give only half its face value for the<br/>
bonded debt of Egypt. It has never been possible<br/>
to determine the nationality of holders of Egyptian<br/>
