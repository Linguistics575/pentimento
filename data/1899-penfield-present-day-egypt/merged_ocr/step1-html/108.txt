Although some of Mehemet Ali's successors have<br/>
been woefully inert, all, with the exception of the<br/>
first Abbas, have done something toward upbuilding Alexandria. The population has developed<br/>
until, in the present year, it is computed to be<br/>
three hundred and <span style="color: #ff0000;">twenty-frve </span>thousand. Ismail<br/>
had a superstitious fear that he <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>destined to die<br/>
in Alexandria, and consequently passed little time<br/>
there. The most <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuous </span>modern Egyptian<br/>
buried in this commercial capital, where Archimedes conceived his most useful inventions, and<br/>
where St. Mark preached the gospel, is Viceroy<br/>

To-day Alexandria has broad avenues, theaters,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">olubs</span>, and many other features, good and bad, of<br/>
a flourishing city in Europe, and better-paved<br/>
streets than most European towns. Ten or fifteen<br/>
years since, the condition of the streets left so much<br/>
to be desired that the leading export merchants<br/>
took the matter in hand, and agreed to pay to the<br/>
municipality a small fee on each bale of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton </span>and<br/>
sack of grain or sugar shipped by them. The<br/>
aggregate in a few years <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>sufficient to give<br/>
every important thoroughfare a paving of stone<br/>
blocks, and from the handsome residue a <span style="color: #ff0000;">fire-boat<br/>
</span>and other needed adjuncts <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>donated to the<br/>
city. All this was accomplished without taxing<br/>
the people.<br/>

In these times the harbor exhibits almost as<br/>
great a variety of foreign flags as the crowd on<br/>
the quays represents nationalities, More than<br/>
