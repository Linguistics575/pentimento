<span>Alexandria, Seat of Commerce<br/>
<br/>
twenty regular lines of steamers ply to and from<br/>
Alexandria; visiting men-of-war and yachts lie for<br/>
weeks at a time in the harbor, and the life and<br/>
movement are those of a great international seaport.<br/>
<br/>
The harbor is protected by a sea-wall nearly<br/>
two miles in length, constructed of more than<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-six </span>thousand square blocks of concrete,<br/>
each weighing twenty-two tons, and is perfectly<br/>
lighted. The well-protected haven, of a depth of<br/>
twenty to sixty feet, and an area of eighteen hundred acres, thus formed, is supplemented by an<br/>
inner port of perhaps one fourth the size. The<br/>
harbor dues are considerable, but these, combined<br/>
with the income of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span>'s railways and<br/>
telegraphs, were pledged to European creditors<br/>
demanding security when the national treasury<br/>
had been depleted by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismailrs </span>wild extravagance.<br/>
<br/>
Could the bronze statue of the founder of the<br/>
dynasty, appareled in the Turkish costume of his<br/>
time, and astride a horse of superb proportions,<br/>
in the Place Mehemet Ali, be endowed with life,<br/>
the Great Initiator might see endless processions<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton-laden </span>vehicles moving toward the docks.<br/>
If such a return to life were possible, his mind<br/>
might revert to the time when a friendly botanist<br/>
found growing wild in a Cairene garden a few<br/>
plants whose blossoms developed into fiber-filled<br/>
bolls, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, the savant advised the Viceroy, might<br/>
be cultivated in Egypt on a large scale with great<br/>
profit. This was the origin of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton-culture </span>there,<br/>
representing in shipments from Alexandria now<br/>
