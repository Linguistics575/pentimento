<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
cavalry came <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maj </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or-Greneral </span>Sir Herbert Kitchener,<br/>
the sirdar of the Egyptian army, with his staff-unmistakably English in spite of their Egyptian<br/>
uniforms. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Immediately </span>behind them walked readers of the Koran, reciting the sacred verses in a<br/>
high nasal chant; deputations from the native<br/>
guilds and corporations, bearing flags and banners<br/>
with embroidered religious devices; descendants of<br/>
the prophet, in green turbans and flowing robes;<br/>
mollas and ulema, in long <span style="color: #0000FF;">caftans</span>; dervishes, in tall<br/>
felt hats; students from El-Azhar-in fact, the militant and uncompromising Islam in all its old-world<br/>
picturesqueness. Then, in sharp contrast to the<br/>
medieval <span style="color: #0000FF;">scholasticism </span>of the great Mussulman<br/>
university, came hundreds of <span style="color: #0000FF;">black-coated </span>boys<br/>
and youths from the modern schools and colleges,<br/>
with their European teachers. Behind them again,<br/>
in curious <span style="color: #0000FF;">alternation</span>, walked native and European<br/>
notables: judges from the native and international<br/>
courts; gold-laced pashas and beys; British <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>,<br/>
in the Stambouline coat, indicating their Egyptian<br/>
employment; <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sixEuropean </span>commissioners of the<br/>
public debt; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Iong-robed </span>clergy of the different denominations, and rabbis of the J <span style="color: #ff0000;">ewish </span>community;<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">red-coated </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>of the British army of <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupation</span>, led by General Sir <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frederick </span>Forestier<br/>
Walker.<br/>
<br/>
Behind this medley of humanity walked the diplomatie corps, headed by the doyen of the body, Lord<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">homer</span>. Save the United States diplomatic agent<br/>
and his secretary, all were in the spectacular uniforms prescribed by their governments, gold lace,<br/>
