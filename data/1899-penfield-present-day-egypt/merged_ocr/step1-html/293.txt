<span>Tewfik and the Arabi Rebellion<br/>
<br/>
longer a political issue himself, the administration<br/>
of Egypt, owing its creation to him, becomes an international issue, as well as an anomaly having no<br/>
parallel in history. This control of affairs, upheld<br/>
by four or five thousand British bayonets, on soil<br/>
not belonging to the British empire, is an institution over <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>European statesmen have long<br/>
wrangled. "Advisers" to the khedive, undersecretaries of state, irrigation experts, military<br/>
and civil servants of high degree and <span style="color: #0000FF;">corresponding </span>pay, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">small-fry </span>officials by the hundred,<br/>
owe their employment in the land of the Nile to<br/>
the muddle-headed Arabi, now dreaming away his<br/>
days in the hills of Ceylon. The common people<br/>
of his beloved Egypt, for whom he was so solicitous<br/>
in 1881 and <span style="color: #0000FF;">1882</span>, are now enjoying a measure of<br/>
prosperity greater than they had ever known,<br/>
oddly enough, as a sequence of his efforts to free<br/>
them from the grasp of the infidel.<br/>
<br/>
Some philosophers, maybe, see in Arabi one who<br/>
has done his share toward making Britain's foreign<br/>
policy so successful as to excite the jealousy of half<br/>
the nations of the Old World. Unlike Clive,<br/>
Hastings, and Cecil Rhodes, Arabi accomplished<br/>
what he did for England as the result of bigoted<br/>
ignorance and blundering, not of clear-sighted<br/>
intention.<br/>
