dozen eager hands clawed in the earth, and brought<br/>
to light a Remington rifle, so bright and free from<br/>
rust as to justify the suspicion that the crafty<br/>
Arabi had deposited it there but a few hours before.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik </span>Pasha was a strange combination of cour<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">age </span>and weakness. The latter was proved when<br/>
the spirit of rebellion among his troops <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>took<br/>
concrete shape. Arabi had led four thousand soldiers to Abdin Square to demand from the khedive<br/>
the dismissal of the Riaz ministry, against which<br/>
great dissatisfaction had been fomented by Arabi<br/>
and his brother <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspirator</span>, Mahmoud Sami.<br/>
Three sides of the great square in front of Abdin<br/>
Palace were <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>with soldiery and the accompanying rabble, when the khedive, attended by Sir<br/>
Auckland Colvin, an English <span style="color: #0000FF;">official</span>, went forth to<br/>
meet the insolent Arabi.<br/>
<br/>
The leader rode across the square, sword in<br/>
hand, to the point where the khedive stood, with<br/>
his group of palace <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieials</span>. Arabi was nervous,<br/>
and the experienced eye could tell at a glance that<br/>

commanded Tewfik. Without a word, and almost<br/>
with <span style="color: #ff0000;">11ndignified </span>haste, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">comic-opera </span>hero was<br/>
on the ground, but his sword was still drawn. The<br/>
khedive pointed to it, and Arabi sheathed it<br/>
promptly. <span style="color: #0000FF;">But </span>his hands trembled as he ran the<br/>
blade into the <span style="color: #ff0000;">seabbard</span>, betraying the cowardly<br/>
heart beating within his jacket.<br/>

It was the moment for action. "Demand his<br/>
