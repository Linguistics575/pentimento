tricks resorted to by shippers of the illicit article.<br/>
Many others more <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to detect are to be seen<br/>
in the curious collection.<br/>
<br/>
By means of <span style="color: #0000FF;">confederates </span>on the lookout, many<br/>
a rubber <span style="color: #0000FF;">bag </span>and water-tight box of hashish finds<br/>
its way ashore, on the Mediterranean beach <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>in<br/>
the Suez Canal, nearly every night. The authorities<br/>
cannot cope with the cunning of the aliens waxing<br/>
fat from the Egyptian slaves to hashish. I have<br/>
been assured that in both Alexandria and Cairo the<br/>
cafes and other establishments where a smoke of<br/>
hashish may be had number hundreds. The Koran<br/>
strictly forbidding the use of liquors and wines, the<br/>
mind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">lower-class </span>Mohammedans has seized the<br/>
intoxicating hemp compound as an alternative. It<br/>
is more debasing and injurious than strong drink,<br/>
physicians claim, and often leads to insanity or<br/>
idiocy. Alexandria, with its native population<br/>
living in intimate relations with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">offseourings<br/>
</span>of every Mediterranean land, has for generations<br/>
been the headquarters of the use of hashish.<br/>
