Eight or ten years ago three quarters of the vessels passing the Suez Canal flew the British flag;<br/>
but in recent years there has been a slight falling<br/>
off in the number of English ships, the result chiefly<br/>
of the determined effort Germany is making to<br/>
secure new markets in the East. But the British<br/>
flag represents still two thirds of the total <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic</span>.<br/>
Next to England, Germany is the principal user of<br/>
the canal; the Dutch flag comes third, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the<br/>
tricolor of France is fourth in the list. Not for<br/>
many years, I am sorry to say, have the Stars and<br/>
Stripes of our country been seen in the canal over<br/>
a commercial vessel. A couple of warships and<br/>
two or three yachts usually comprise the annual<br/>
volume of American representation. This is a sad<br/>
commentary on the decline of our mercantile fleet,<br/>
and demonstrates in no equivocal manner how completely our flag has disappeared from the seas. The<br/>
records of the United States consular agency at Port<br/>
Said disclose the fact that about eighty American<br/>
