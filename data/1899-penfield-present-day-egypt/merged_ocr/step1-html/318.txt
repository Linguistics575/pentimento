<br/>
that the Austrian emperor place a steamer at the<br/>
youth's disposal, with an escort of dignitaries from<br/>
the Vienna court. The vessel was old, "perhaps<br/>
fifty years old, and very small," said the khedive.<br/>
Violent storms had made the Adriatic and Medi- <span style="color: #0000FF;">5<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">terranean </span>turbulent, and the journey from Triest<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>disagreeable and trying. High seas retarded<br/>
progress, and even the ship's officers wished themselves ashore. At Brindisi Prince Abbas begged<br/>
to have the ship wait for better weather.<br/>
<br/>
"I must not stop, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Highness</span>," was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">admiral's<br/>
</span>reply, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>for it is the emperor's command to lose no<br/>
time, and the etiquette must be observed."<br/>
<br/>
When the peaceful harbors of Greece came in<br/>
sight, the khedive again pleaded for delay. But<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">punctilious </span>commander insisted that "the etiquette must be observed, for it was his Majesty's<br/>
order."<br/>
<br/>
This <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>too much for the poor sufferer, and he<br/>
remarked to the ceremonious <span style="color: #0000FF;">officer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>"Etiquette is<br/>
well enough in its place; but his Majesty Francis<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oseph </span>is comfortable in Vienna, and not seasick<br/>
on this awful ship. "<br/>
<br/>
The voyage was successfully completed, nevertheless, and the day after landing on Egyptian soil<br/>
the illustrious passenger formally took upon himself the rulership of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The state ball given' each winter at Abdin Palace<br/>
by his Highness, besides being <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>most important<br/>
social occurrence of the year, has a spectacular<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>not to be excelled anywhere by any similar<br/>
function. In its variety and contrasts it eclipses<br/>
