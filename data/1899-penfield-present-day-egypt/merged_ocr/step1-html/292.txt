They hoped against hope for permission to return<br/>
to Egypt, and for years <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>friends did their<br/>
utmost to second his efforts to secure a pardon.<br/>
<br/>
From the first the exiles were treated as <span style="color: #0000FF;">persons </span>of importance, and they have been the guests<br/>
of the various governors who have <span style="color: #0000FF;">held </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sway </span>in<br/>
Ceylon since 1883. Arabi's home has been visited<br/>
by many thousands of Mohammedans on their road<br/>
to Mecca, as well as by an immense number of<br/>
European and American travelers. m is now<br/>
located in a picturesque bungalow in the ancient<br/>
capital of the island, Kandy, in the interior, where<br/>
the temperature is more like that of his native<br/>
country than that of the coast. Arabi has ceased<br/>
to find his life in Ceylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">either </span>irksome or otherwise unpleasant. His <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>visiting-book "is in its way<br/>
a notable curiosity, and he can now talk of the<br/>

the <span style="color: #0000FF;">much-loved </span>land from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>he sprang, and<br/>
the freedom for which he fought. He is still in the<br/>
prime of life, for the rebel leader was only just<br/>
forty when <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>he surrendered his sword and his<br/>
