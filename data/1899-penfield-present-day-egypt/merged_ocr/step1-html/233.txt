<span>Story of the Suez Canal<br/>
<br/>
of the Legion of Honor. The omission was never<br/>
fully explained. Some thought that, as he had no<br/>
personal fortune, this stood in the way of his receiving a French dukedom: provision for himself<br/>
and his heirs would have been necessary. Others<br/>
thought that the success of the canal was too<br/>
doubtful for a high honor to be based on it. However, in view of the disgrace that De Lesseps fell<br/>
into over the Panama scheme, it is fortunate for<br/>
the French nation that the dukedom was never<br/>
given to him. If it can be said of any man that he<br/>
lived too long, that surely can be said of Ferdinand<br/>
de Lesseps.<br/>
<br/>
The canal destroyed Egypt's important railway<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">traffie </span>between Alexandria and Suez, besides<br/>
bringing to the land that foreign domination foreshadowed by the oracle consulted by the ancient<br/>
Necho. Of the never-ending throng of humanity<br/>
that passes through it, few, probably, think of, or<br/>
know, the pathetic chapters of its history. It has<br/>
revolutionized shipping methods, driven the stately<br/>
sailing-ship from the ocean, and some years ago had<br/>
developed as much <span style="color: #ff0000;">traifie </span>as can be expected to<br/>
come to it under normal conditions.<br/>
<br/>
The canal's value to the commerce of the world<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>proved by the saving-of distance<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">effected </span>by it, as compared with the route around<br/>
the Cape of Good Hope. By the latter the distance between England and Bombay is 10,860 miles,<br/>
by the canal 4620 miles; from St. Petersburg to<br/>
Bombay by the Cape is 11,610 miles, by the canal<br/>
6770 miles; and from New York to Bombay by<br/>
