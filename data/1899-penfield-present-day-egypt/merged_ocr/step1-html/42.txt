the fact by portraying in indigo blue an impossible<br/>
locomotive, drawing a train of impossible pink<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cars</span>. A steamboat of marvelous design, with paddle-Wheels revolving in a mass of fish, tells in purple how the trip from Suez to Djeddah was made.<br/>
A train of green camels informs the uninitiated how<br/>
the pious man journeyed from the Red Sea coast<br/>
across the desert to Mecca. Huge lions, with round<br/>
and almost human faces, in bright orange, tell of<br/>
dangers in the desert march. But all ends happily,<br/>

the corpse to the cemetery, bewailing at the top of<br/>
their voices and rending their scanty clothing. The<br/>
