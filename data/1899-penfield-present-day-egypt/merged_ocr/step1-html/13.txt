STOOD once before a window in Venice<br/>
<br/>
wherein an artisan was at work. Arranged<br/>
before him were smalts and innumerable bits of<br/>
glass of every hue, some brilliant, many dull, and<br/>
none suggestive of value or purpose. Apparently<br/>
following no definite design, the workman seemed<br/>
to draw mechanically upon the materials at his<br/>
command, choosing alike from the dull and bright<br/>
pieces, until it could be seen that the object on<br/>
which he had been employed, now completed, was a<br/>
mosaic of attractive pattern - not a masterpiece in<br/>
any sense, but perfect enough to find a purchaser<br/>
from among the group of onlookers.<br/>
<br/>
In fashioning this mosaic volume of information<br/>
concerning the reawakened Nile country, I may<br/>
have drawn too generously upon the supply of<br/>
lusterless material, and dulled naturally brilliant<br/>
atoms by <span style="color: #ff0000;">misplaeing </span>them in the pattern. The<br/>
finished article, I am conscious, is far from a <span style="color: #0000FF;">masterpiece</span>, and is journalistic rather than literary;<br/>
but it may still be attractive enough to satisfy the<br/>
inquiring reader interested to learn about the<br/>
atoms making up the Egypt of to-day.<br/>
<br/>
"Present-Day Egypt" is prepared neither for<br/>
