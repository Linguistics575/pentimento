day life. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>reads his Koran faithfully, for it lays<br/>
down his standard of ethics, and is the foundation<br/>
of his code of laws. See him at prayer, in the<br/>
mosque, field, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>busy street, addressing his supplications to Allah, through his prophet, face turned<br/>
to Mecca: his faith is complete and his sincerity<br/>
unquestionable. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Be </span>cares not how the onlooker<br/>
may regard him. The fellah on the canal-bank<br/>
utters the same fervent, <span style="color: #0000FF;">heartfelt </span>prayer as the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pasha </span>prostrate upon his silken rug within the<br/>
Mehemet Ali mosque. The cardinal requirement<br/>
of the Koran, that food and riches must be shared<br/>
with the unfortunate, is literally obeyed. The<br/>
Mohammedan has no cant 01' hypocrisy in his nature. He is tolerant of all religions, but looks with<br/>
horror upon the unbeliever. It is the good Mohammedan of whom I write-and there are many such;<br/>
not the fanatic, liable by excitement to become a<br/>
frenzied demon.<br/>

The provision of the Koran permitting four<br/>
wives has become more honored in the breach by<br/>
Cairenes than in the observance. Few Egyptians<br/>
in public life have now more than one wife. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik </span>gave his influence to the monogamie<br/>
idea; and the present khedive, although not <span style="color: #0000FF;">taking </span>a wife from the elevated class from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>his<br/>
mother came, is following his father's example.<br/>
The middle class is gradually following the matrimonial precept of its superiors. Possibly its men<br/>
found polygamy not particularly conducive to <span style="color: #ff0000;">domestie </span>tranquillity, in the absence of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient<br/>
</span>means to maintain several establishments. The<br/>
