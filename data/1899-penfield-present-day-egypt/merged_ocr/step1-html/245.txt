<span>Ismail as Khedive and Exile<br/>
<br/>
figuring as prince royal and taking precedence of<br/>
his uncles, was an <span style="color: #0000FF;">object-lesson </span>over <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>young<br/>
Ismail pondered, for he was full of the idea of substituting the European order of succession for the<br/>
Mohammedan. Yet he was not the eldest son of<br/>
Ibrahim Pasha, for Achmet was the first-born.<br/>
Ismail had not been at home long before he <span style="color: #0000FF;">conceived </span>a fondness for Nubar, a crafty and accomplished Armenian, who had lived on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroyal<br/>
</span>family from the hour that he was appointed reader<br/>
to Mehemet Ali. At this time Nubar was director<br/>
of the railways, and it will ever be suspected that<br/>
he had much to do with the tragedy that placed<br/>
Prince Ismail in line to succeed Viceroy Said. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A<br/>
</span>special train was ordered to convey the princes<br/>
and their suites from Cairo to Alexandria, where<br/>
the Viceroy was to give a great garden-party.<br/>
Strangely enough, Ismail excused himself at the<br/>
last moment from going, on a plea of sudden illness, the story is told, while, by odd coincidence,<br/>
Nubar, whose duty it was, as head of the railway<br/>
administration, to accompany the princely party,<br/>
pretended, just as the train was about to steam out<br/>
of the station, a similar indisposition, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>forced<br/>
him to remain in Cairo. The train, in addition to<br/>
carrying the heir apparent, also conveyed-his uncle,<br/>
Prince Halim. It proceeded safely on its way until<br/>

</span>the two cities, where the road passes over a drawbridge spanning one of the arms of the Nile. As<br/>
