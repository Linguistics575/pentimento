overlook his capital. During his travels he observed closely such institutions as he considered<br/>
suitable for application to his own country, and<br/>
the knowledge thus obtained has no doubt contributed in a measure to the progress of present-day<br/>
Egypt. Plans had been arranged for a protracted<br/>
visit of the princes to the United States in the year<br/>
of the Columbian Exposition. The itinerary would<br/>
have taken them not only to Chicago and Washington, but also to the principal industrial centers.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik </span>Pasha had planned for instructors to <span style="color: #0000FF;">accompany </span>the young men, who would have given<br/>
them an insight into the sources of <span style="color: #0000FF;">America</span>'s greatness. Abbas Pasha has more than once expressed<br/>
his keen regret that fate should have deprived him<br/>
of the advantage of seeing the country with <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>his grandfather had established valued relations.<br/>
<br/>
Elevation to exalted position has not obliterated<br/>
the memory of comradeships at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Geneva </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">andVienna</span>;<br/>
for when the khedive is <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>acquainted<br/>
with his caller to lay aside formalities, and the<br/>
visitor is American, he will recall many pleasant<br/>
companionships with American youths, mentioning<br/>
them by name <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>speaking of their attractive<br/>
qualities.<br/>
<br/>
The lingual capacity of the khedive is striking,<br/>
especially to those who regard a prinee's training as<br/>
purely ornamental. During the course of an "<span style="color: #0000FF;">audience-day</span>" it frequently happens that he discusses<br/>
questions of state with the British and United<br/>
States diplomatic agents in excellent English, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
</span>the representative of France in faultless French,<br/>
