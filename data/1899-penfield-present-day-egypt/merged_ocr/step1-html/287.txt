<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik </span>and the Arabi Rebellion<br/>
<br/>
By the old system, with each side issuing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">proclamation </span>almost daily to the other, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">patient-was<br/>
</span>in danger of succumbing while the rival physicians<br/>
were deciding <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>should take the responsibility<br/>
of going to his relief.<br/>
<br/>
During the bombardment <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik </span>was in his palace three miles out of Alexandria, with his wife.<br/>
When urged before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">shelling </span>of the city to seek<br/>
shelter on his yacht or on a war-ship, his answer<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was</span>: "No. I will remain with my people in their<br/>
hour of danger. I am still their khedive." Within<br/>
range of shots from the ships in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>harbor, and<br/>
with a bloodthirsty, looting mob near by, Tewfik<br/>
remained in his Ramleh palace throughout the<br/>
two days of <span style="color: #0000FF;">carnage</span>. Shortly after the crushing<br/>
of Arabi, cholera broke out in Cairo in its most fatal<br/>
form. Then this man who had failed to nip a rebellion in the bud by a commanding word to Arabi<br/>
went deliberately with his <span style="color: #ff0000;">khedivah </span>to the capital,<br/>
against the advice of his suite, and to the dismay<br/>
of the physicians. He went from hospital to <span style="color: #0000FF;">hospital</span>, inspiring courage throughout <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>stricken<br/>
city by his example, and helping the bereaved with<br/>
money from a purse not overflowing.<br/>
<br/>
Called to a heritage of bankruptcy, discontent,<br/>
and rebellion, Tewfik Pasha was a virtuous and<br/>
amiable prince, whose failings inspired sympathy.<br/>
He regretted the ravages of cholera in Cairo and<br/>
the Delta more than the losing to the Mahdi of<br/>
millions of miles of valuable territory in the Sudan,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>because he had witnessed the horrors of the<br/>
home calamity, possibly.<br/>
