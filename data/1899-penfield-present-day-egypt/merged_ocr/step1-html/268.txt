<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Pasha from the direction of the affairs of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">government.</span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>It was a matter of great importance to be arranged by telegraph, this change of rulership in<br/>
almost independent Egypt; but thus it was done.<br/>
The Sultan's aversion to the mysterious electric<br/>
current is known to exclude the telephone, the<br/>
electric light, and even the <span style="color: #0000FF;">trolley-car </span>from Constantinople; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>in matters of state, when urgent,<br/>
his Majesty is a liberal enough user of telegraph<br/>
and cable.<br/>
<br/>
In Eastern countries it is a coveted privilege to<br/>
convey good news to any one. I have the story of<br/>
the telegrams from a distinguished journalist who<br/>
was behind the scenes in the abdication affair<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Be<br/>
</span>describes, with some license, perhaps, the consternation at Abdin when the message was delivered<br/>
with the words <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ex-khedive</span>" so boldly penned on<br/>
the envelop that there could be no mistaking the<br/>
purport of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">inelosure</span>. The grand master of<br/>
ceremonies would as soon have fondled a viper;<br/>
and one and all of his assistants thought of pressing matters demanding their presence in other<br/>
parts of the palace. The keeper of the seals said<br/>
emphatically that the delivering of telegrams was<br/>
no part of his duty; and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">officer </span>of the khedival<br/>
guard could not be cajoled into doing this errand.<br/>
Everybody agreed that a message to his Highness<br/>
at this particular time must be a matter of state,<br/>
and no one of less rank than a minister could appropriately have anything to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
At this moment bluff old Cherif Pasha, peren<br/>
