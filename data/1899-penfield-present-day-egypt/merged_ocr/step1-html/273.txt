<span>Tewfik and the Arabi Rebellion<br/>
<br/>
viding for the khedival succession from father to<br/>
eldest son, he believed, doubtless, that he was paying his money for the lesser of two evils; and,<br/>
besides, fate might remove Prince Tewfik, the intruder, permitting the son of his favorite wife to<br/>
become heir apparent.<br/>
<br/>
While the other sons were sent to schools and<br/>
colleges in England and France, Tewfik was kept<br/>
at home, and little effort was made to give him<br/>
more than the educational advantages that would<br/>
fall to the son of any well-to-do Egyptian gentleman. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>once ventured abroad, traveling as far<br/>
as Vienna; but the breaking out of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Franco-German </span>War caused him to return to Cairo, and shortly<br/>
thereafter he found himself installed at Koubbeh,<br/>
with a spouse so devoted and good that he was<br/>
happy to lead the life of a country squire, and<br/>
leave court intrigue and politics to those caring for<br/>
them. Bis princess was the daughter of a man of<br/>
position, descended from Mehemet Ali, and she<br/>
possessed a mind and character of an order unusual<br/>
in the East.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik </span>never availed himself of the Moslem right<br/>
to give rivals to the Princess Emine in the way<br/>
of other wives. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Be </span>was an affectionate husband<br/>
and a model landlord. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>took <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>great interest in<br/>
the cause of education, and established schools at<br/>
his own expense, to which not only his own two sons<br/>
were sent, but the sons of the gentry and <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials<br/>
</span>as well. The educating of children was his greatest hobby.<br/>
