<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
by engineering skill; and as a building achievement<br/>
the scheme is on a scale worthy of a Rameses or a<br/>
Pharaoh. To create in the midst of the African<br/>
desert a lake having possibly three times the <span style="color: #ff0000;">supnfcia1 </span>area of Lake Geneva in Switzerland, and<br/>
control it with <span style="color: #ff0000;">seientifie </span>precision, so that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">impounded </span>flood may be turned into distant channels<br/>
at will, is a comprehensive undertaking. But the<br/>
engineers claim that their plans can be carried out<br/>
to the letter; they have estimated the exact cost of<br/>
the dam, computed almost to the gallon the volume<br/>
of water that will be imprisoned, and figured the<br/>
necessary resistance to be provided at every point<br/>
of the masonry. In Cairo, the experts of the ministries of public works and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance</span>, likewise, have<br/>
calculated to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">nicety </span>the sum from taxation that<br/>
will come into the public treasury through the<br/>
country's augmented <span style="color: #0000FF;">productiveness</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Subordinate to the great dam, a smaller one, not<br/>
unlike the barrage at the apex of the Delta, ten<br/>
miles to the north of Cairo, is to be made at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assiut</span>. Its function will be to give sufficient head to<br/>
the river to force the water into the system of irrigation canals that veins hundreds of thousands of<br/>
acres between Assiut and Cairo. The completion<br/>
of the Cairo barrage so developed <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton-culture </span>as<br/>
to add to the public revenue of the country at least<br/>
ten million dollars annually. It may safely be <span style="color: #ff0000;">coneluded </span>that the Assuan reservoir is but one of a<br/>
series Which will in time be constructed southward to Berber, Khartum, and perhaps the Victoria<br/>
Nyanza. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">re√©stablishment </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">khedival </span>author<br/>
