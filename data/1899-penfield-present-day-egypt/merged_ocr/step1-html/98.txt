notion.<br/>
<br/>
The tobacco used is not adulterated in any way,<br/>
it is claimed, but is <span style="color: #ff0000;">skilfully </span>blended to acquire the<br/>
desired strength and flavor. The best leaves are<br/>
used for export orders, the common grades being<br/>
consumed in Egypt, where nearly every man, <span style="color: #0000FF;">weman</span>, and child is a constant smoker of cigarettes.<br/>
Custom-house returns show that of the tobacco entering the country only about one third is exported<br/>
in manufactured form, thus indicating the enormous home consumption, and giving a suggestion<br/>
of the quantity leaving Egypt in the baggage of<br/>
travelers. Machinery is not employed in any, way,<br/>
except for cutting the tobacco, and it is said that<br/>
the workmen wield <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>power to render the<br/>
adoption of machinery for making cigarettes a step<br/>
too dangerous to be contemplated. The trade is<br/>
centered in Cairo, where there are nearly a hundred<br/>
export establishments.<br/>

The Egyptian cigarette has such an enviable<br/>
position among the luxuries of the world that it is<br/>
difficult to believe that this flourishing trade is of<br/>
very recent growth; but it is, in fact, one of the<br/>
many indirect advantages accruing to the country<br/>
from the impetus imparted by the invasion of <span style="color: #0000FF;">foreign </span>enterprise.<br/>
<br/>
The Cairo-made cigarette is valued above all<br/>
others manufactured in Egypt. The same tobacco<br/>
may be used and as skilful workmen employed in<br/>
other places, but nowhere else is the same delicacy<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">rflavor </span>achieved. It is claimed by experts that<br/>
