<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>

monds and other precious stones of a size suggesting that the kilo had supplanted the karat as a<br/>
standard of weight. Places where ready-made<br/>
clothing is sold, with unmistakable Hebraic names<br/>
over the doors, have a remarkable similarity to<br/>
Bowery stores.<br/>
<br/>
Sandwiched between great magazines where<br/>
"Prix Fixe" cards are <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuously </span>displayed<br/>
may yet be found the dokkan of old. This is but<br/>
a recess in the wall, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">mastabah</span>, or seat, of its<br/>
proprietor on a level with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">floor </span>of the diminutive shop. On this the Arab trader, in flowing robe<br/>
and turban, spends the day, bargaining at times in<br/>
a leisurely way, now and then dozing, with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">rosary </span>of sandalwood beads ever between his <span style="color: #0000FF;">fingers</span>.<br/>
When he goes out he hangs a network curtain before the shelves where his silken stuffs, spices, or<br/>
embroideries are stored. Egyptians respect the<br/>
netted veil, and, returned from his errand, or prayer<br/>
in the mosque, the merchant resumes his seat on<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mastabah</span>, knowing that his stock has not been<br/>
rifled during his absence. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">water-seller</span>'s cry<br/>
of "Oh, may God compensate thee," may attract<br/>
this merchant, descended from the times of Abraham and <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oseph</span>. If so, he exchanges a <span style="color: #0000FF;">millieme<br/>
</span>for a draught from the earthen jar, returns to his<br/>
meditations, and dreams of vanishing Cairo, of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Haussmannized </span>avenues, and great emporiums with<br/>
plate-glass windows filled with ridiculous <span style="color: #ff0000;">papiermach√© </span>figures, in a few years destined to metamorphose the city of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">califs</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mouski</span>, unlike<br/>
the bazaars, is being <span style="color: #ff0000;">Europeanized </span>at a rate sad<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">46<br/>
