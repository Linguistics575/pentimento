land and river. An inclosure is reserved for harem<br/>
carriages, packed with closely veiled women, who<br/>
can see but little of the entertainment. Out on the<br/>
Nile, opposite the canal's mouth, is moored the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hulk<br/>
</span>of a vessel, ablaze with lamps and fireworks, which<br/>
is claimed to be emblematic of the time when the<br/>
republic of Venice sent an envoy to witness the<br/>
ceremony. The excitement increases with every<br/>
discharge of fireworks or arrival of a grandee, and<br/>
the populace shouts and dances itself into a frenzy<br/>
of delight. Meanwhile scores of copper-skinned<br/>
Egyptians are shoulder-deep in the Nile, cutting<br/>
away the embankment with their <span style="color: #0000FF;">mattocks</span>, while<br/>
bands play and the sky is zigzagged with rockets.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>go home by midnight, but the common<br/>

and at a signal the bank is cut, the waters rush in,<br/>
and hundreds of men and boys plunge into the<br/>
torrent to scramble for the bright piasters thrown<br/>
by the khedive's representative and the religious<br/>
luminaries. It is claimed that the daily records of<br/>
the Nilometer for a thousand years <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>preserved<br/>
in the archives of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

</span>The Shubra Palace and grounds, <span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">deserted </span>and<br/>
decaying, but once the home of viceregal splendor<br/>
and voluptuousness, are worth all the trouble required to secure permission to visit them. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shubra<br/>
