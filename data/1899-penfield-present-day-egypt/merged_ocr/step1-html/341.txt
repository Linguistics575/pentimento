<span>Britain's Position in Egypt<br/>
<br/>
ing-ground for younger sons and a horde of civil<br/>
and military functionaries, furnishing the minimum<br/>
of usefulness for the maximum of compensation, is<br/>
petty, and forms no part of a scheme of such <span style="color: #ff0000;">magintude </span>as the practical absorption of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The land of the Pyramids has become a short cut<br/>
to English honors, as the Suez Canal is to the British possessions in the East<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and no act of courage,<br/>
benefit, or policy on the part of a British military<br/>
or civil official there passes unrecognized by the<br/>
home government. At least four peerages have<br/>
fallen to British servants in Egypt since the bombardment of Alexandria, and knighthood and lesser<br/>
degrees of chivalry have been apportioned to the<br/>
Briton serving in the Nile land with lavish generosity. In most cases the dignities have been<br/>
merited, doubtless, under England's system of <span style="color: #0000FF;">bestowing </span>rewards. As a recognition for dealing the<br/>
death-blow to Mahdiism, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kitchener</span>'s peerage and<br/>
the Parliamentary grant of thirty thousand pounds<br/>
sterling were not excessive.<br/>
<br/>
Are the people of Egypt materially benefited by<br/>
English rule?<br/>
<br/>
Unquestionably they are. Unpopular as it is<br/>
with a majority of the people of Egypt, humiliating to the Sultan and the khedive, and at times<br/>
bitterly criticized in Europe, the occupation has<br/>
done vast good. No fair-minded investigator can<br/>
witness the present condition of the Egyptian fellaheen, or peasantry, knowing what it was before<br/>
the advent of the English, without conceding this.<br/>
For six or eight years Egypt has fairly teemed with<br/>
