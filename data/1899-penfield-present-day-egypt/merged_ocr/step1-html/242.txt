Pasha, from whom he inherited that reckless <span style="color: #0000FF;">courage </span>so discernible in every important action of his<br/>
life. Caution and prudence were altogether overshadowed by the daredevil quality descending<br/>
from men knowing only the law of the sword.<br/>
He came to the viceroyship on <span style="color: #0000FF;">January </span>18, 1863,<br/>
inheriting from Said, his uncle, the damnosa hereditas of the Suez Canal. Ismail found himself<br/>
pledged to the undertaking of his predecessor, and<br/>
the excuse for the vast debt which accumulated<br/>
during his reign may partially be found in these<br/>
obligations.<br/>
<br/>
Prince Ismail was sent to Paris in 1843 to receive<br/>
a French education, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>authorized to attend<br/>
the classes at the Polytechnique. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>spent every<br/>
Thursday evening at the Tuileries, and generally<br/>
dined with the royal family on Sundays. He had<br/>
been nearly seven years in the French capital when,<br/>
in 1849, his education was thought to be completed,<br/>
and he was recalled to Egypt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>sojourn in<br/>
Paris was coincident with the ferment into <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>the railway movement, by exciting greed to the<br/>
utmost, had thrown all France. This was one of<br/>
the underlying causes of the revolution of 1848,<br/>
which Ismail witnessed, and the young Egyptian<br/>
went home with his head filled <span style="color: #0000FF;">with.ideas </span>derived<br/>
from Louis Philippe and his courtiers.<br/>
<br/>
Being learned in mathematics and all the <span style="color: #ff0000;">seienees </span>that could be acquired in a few years, Ismail<br/>
thought he was better qualified to reign in Egypt<br/>
than his uncles, Said <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abbas-both </span>younger sons<br/>
of Mehemet Ali. The youthful Comte de Paris,<br/>
