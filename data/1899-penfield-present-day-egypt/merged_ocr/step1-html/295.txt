<br/>
that he would like to guide unaided the government<br/>
of which he is the titular head. This is an expedient of the moment, defensible, possibly, because<br/>
patriotic. But when the young Egyptian is forced<br/>
to repress his desire to rule over his people, subject<br/>
only to his <span style="color: #0000FF;">suzerain</span>, the newspapers forget to neutralize the harsh things said of him in their zeal to<br/>
promote Britain's foreign interests. It seldom <span style="color: #0000FF;">occurs </span>to English journalists that Abbas, too, knows<br/>
the meaning of the words "fair play."<br/>
<br/>
This young man, the seventh of the Mehemet Ali<br/>
line to be at the head of the Egyptian people,<br/>
makes no pretension to unusual wisdom; yet his<br/>
capabilities are of an order making of him a not<br/>
unworthy successor to the Pharaohs and Ptolemies,<br/>
Alexander and Cleopatra. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Be </span>lacks some of the<br/>
amiable characteristics of his father, Khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik</span>, it is true; but he is <span style="color: #ff0000;">incomparablybetter </span>qualified<br/>
for successful administrative work. English people<br/>
approved of Tewfik Pasha, but that khedive never<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">aroused </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">angerby </span>expressing wishes <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">opinions</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">He </span>was pliable as clay in the strong British grasp.<br/>
<br/>
Abbas's faults are neither numerous nor serious.<br/>
Bis good qualities exceed in number those possessed<br/>
by the average prince of his years and experience.<br/>
The sentiment of patriotism is one that justly<br/>
claims respect, and that he should desire to be free<br/>
from foreign tutelage is natural enough. To learn<br/>
his true character and arrive at a just conclusion of<br/>
his worth, he must be measured at home, since the<br/>
opinions spread before readers of English newspapers and books are scarcely <span style="color: #0000FF;">ingenuous</span>.<br/>
