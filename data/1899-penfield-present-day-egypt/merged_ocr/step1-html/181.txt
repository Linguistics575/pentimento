<span>Expansion by Irrigation<br/>
<br/>
With these <span style="color: #0000FF;">conflicting </span>claims to reconcile, the<br/>
engineers were compelled to weigh the pros and<br/>
cons of their project in every aspect before again<br/>
testing public opinion. That they succeeded in<br/>
their task is shown by the general approval of<br/>
their modified scheme, by which the dam is to be<br/>
but two thirds as high as at first proposed. A head<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">forty-six </span>feet of water satisfies the engineers,<br/>
and does not alarm the archaeologists<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>for, although<br/>
submerging portions of the island, it leaves the<br/>
temple, pylons, and prized sculptures fairly above<br/>
water-level.<br/>
<br/>
When the builders have finished their labors, visitors to Upper Egypt can never realize the present<br/>
beauty of Philae. The Isis temple, the chapel of<br/>
Hathor, the Diocletian portal, one of the legendary<br/>
graves of Osiris, the well-preserved pavilion called<br/>
"Pharaoh's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-tho </span>designer of which was no<br/>
stranger to Greek art, and within whose walls thousands of tourists have <span style="color: #ff0000;">partaken </span>of their midday<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">111neheon</span>, -will all be there, like jewels <span style="color: #ff0000;">wrenehed<br/>
</span>from glorious settings. The structures will rise<br/>
from a placid lake, deprived of the graceful elevation and artistic symmetry that add much to their<br/>
fame.<br/>
<br/>
Confessedly <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philie </span>will be impaired artistically,<br/>
for it is safe to assume that the zealous engineers<br/>
understate the extent of the submergence. A<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">seientifie </span>English observer, who studied the subject<br/>
at close <span style="color: #0000FF;">quarters</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-from </span>the island itself ,--says:<br/>
"The four great pylons will, of course, stand up<br/>
out of the new lake, but its waters will rise to their<br/>
<br/>
