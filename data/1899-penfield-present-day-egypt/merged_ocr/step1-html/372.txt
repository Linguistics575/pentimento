<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
brings Luxor and Assuan into intimate touch with<br/>
the world. Luxor has good hotels, a small hospital, and competent medical <span style="color: #ff0000;">men.. </span>The Luxor Hotel<br/>
is good enough to satisfy any reasonable person; its<br/>
gardens include hundreds of varieties of <span style="color: #0000FF;">trOpical<br/>
</span>plants and trees. If time presses, the journey to<br/>
Cairo, four hundred and fifty miles, may be made<br/>
by train in a day, but not with the comfort to be<br/>
found on the steamers. In archaeological <span style="color: #0000FF;">attractions </span>Luxor is without a peer. Karnak is admittedly <span style="color: #0000FF;">unapproachable </span>in grandeur and antiquarian<br/>
interest, and the plain of Thebes rich with storied<br/>
ruins. <span style="color: #0000FF;">An </span>excursion to the Tombs of the Kings,<br/>
where the royal mummies rested for thousands of<br/>
years previous to their transfer to Der el-Bahari,<br/>
repays one for taxing strength and energy. From<br/>
the moment of mounting your donkey on the Nile<br/>
strand to the final dismount on the return, <span style="color: #0000FF;">diminutive </span>Egyptians, not <span style="color: #ff0000;">overelad</span>, keep pace with the<br/>
animal throughout the day, demanding bakshish.<br/>
with smiling faces at every <span style="color: #0000FF;">step-am1 </span>it is a long<br/>
and tortuous journey to the Tombs of the Kings.<br/>
However resolute one may be not to give, and although your command to "<span style="color: #0000FF;">imshi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">/ </span>"has been sternly<br/>
repeated a thousand times, you generally relent at<br/>
the last moment, as the youngsters know you will,<br/>
and shower your <span style="color: #0000FF;">milliemes </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-piasters </span>among<br/>
the descendants of Mizraim. There is something<br/>
consoling and stimulating to robust Sightseer as<br/>
well as to semi-invalid in this exercise of benevolence.<br/>
<br/>
From Luxor to Assuan is a short one hundred<br/>
<br/>
