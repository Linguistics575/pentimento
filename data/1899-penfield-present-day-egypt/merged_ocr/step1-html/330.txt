ation could be accomplished only with great confusion to a policy under <span style="color: #ff0000;">whielfEgyptian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">finances<br/>
</span>have not only been repaired, but placed on a footing of enviable solvency.<br/>
<br/>
The Dongola expedition, a few years since,<br/>
afforded opportunity for England to show <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>military critics and strategists the possibilities<br/>
of her imperial resources in a defensive way, by<br/>
bringing from India several native regiments <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>garrisoned Suakim and other Red Sea ports during the months when the entire Egyptian army was<br/>
concentrated on the Upper Nile. It would not be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult</span>, at any time, for Great Britain to place a<br/>
good-sized army of Indians in the Nile valley, independent of her naval position in the Mediterranean, if she dared weaken her strength in India for<br/>
a time. Rail connection between the Red Sea and<br/>
the Upper Nile would render this easy.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">reconquest </span>of the Sudan cannot, for a year<br/>
or two at least, <span style="color: #0000FF;">mean </span>that the provinces south of<br/>
Dongola are open to trade. The whole region<br/>
about Khartum, and for hundreds of miles up and<br/>
down the Nile valley, is practically depopulated<br/>
as a consequence of the years of tyranny and misrule of the khalifa. To bring the natives back to<br/>
the peaceful pursuits of agriculture and its concomitant interests can be accomplished only gradually by Lord Kitchener and his assistants. Not<br/>
until this is done, and the Anglo-Egyptian authority organized in all its civil <span style="color: #0000FF;">ramifications</span>, can the<br/>
Sudan be regarded as "open" to the world. It<br/>
will be a long time, at all events, before the Su<br/>
