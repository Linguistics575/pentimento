<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
is a busy mart, where values are high and the<br/>
sellers understand human nature. Turn to the<br/>
right, turn to the left, go where you will, the shops<br/>
appeal to some taste or fancy you possess. The<br/>
jewelry bazaar, with its anklets and nose-rings of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">leaden-looking </span>silver or brassy gold, has no temptation for the American, however.<br/>
<br/>
The dingy passage where scents are dealt in is a<br/>
nest of cheats who can sell a phial of common perfumed oil for genuine <span style="color: #0000FF;">attar </span>or essence without compunction. The tent bazaar, in Which truly artistic<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">applique </span>awnings and hangings are wrought <span style="color: #0000FF;">without </span>visible pattern by men and boys, is always<br/>
inviting. Two or three of these needlemen, perhaps, were sent to Chicago during the World's Fair;<br/>
but a hundred will tell you they have been in Chicago, each producing dog-eared business cards or a<br/>
stray coin of Uncle <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">minting </span>in substantiation of the statement. They are <span style="color: #0000FF;">agreed </span>that the<br/>
exposition was a grand "fantasia," but most of<br/>
them witnessed it vicariously. "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Anteekas</span>" are<br/>
offered for sale in nearly every shop of every <span style="color: #0000FF;">department </span>of the vast labyrinth. The scarab, especially, is pushed into your face on every hand,<br/>
and whether you give a piaster or a dozen coins of<br/>
gold, you will have the same uncertainty as to the<br/>
genuineness of the sacred beetle. The Red Sea<br/>
turquoise, gummed to a bit of reed, is likewise<br/>
omnipresent; it is beautiful to look at, but may<br/>
change color in a week.<br/>
<br/>
The throng of people in the bazaars is a study in<br/>
humanity, as entertaining, perhaps, as the contents<br/>
