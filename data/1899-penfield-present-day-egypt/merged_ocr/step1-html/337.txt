<span>Britain's Position in Egypt<br/>

would in all probability be as silent on the subject<br/>
of evacuation as the Sphinx itself.<br/>
<br/>
Does England profit sufficiently from her retention of Egypt to warrant the jealous hatred of<br/>
France, her nearest neighbor<span style="color: #ff0000;">?<br/>
<br/>
</span>Great Britain has well-nigh made an English<br/>
lake of the Mediterranean; the outlet of this lake,<br/>
the Suez Canal, is the key to the whole scheme of<br/>
British rule in India and the East. To control the<br/>
canal, by force of arms if necessary, is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">predominant </span>reason why England remains in Egypt.<br/>
It serves her purpose perfectly to have five thousand <span style="color: #ff0000;">redeoats </span>within a few hours' journey of the<br/>
great international waterway, and a guardship at<br/>
each terminus of it. Without the absolute control of this connecting-link between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Occident </span>and<br/>
Orient, thirty-six million people in Great Britain<br/>
could not expect long to hold in subjection four<br/>
hundred millions in India, and to govern a quarter<br/>
of the globe.<br/>
<br/>
Monetary considerations have as much weight<br/>
with Englishmen as with other people. As perhaps<br/>
half of Egypt's bonded debt was held in England<br/>
when the occupation began, the gradual <span style="color: #0000FF;">appreciation </span>of the value of Egyptian securities has seemed<br/>
to Britishers another <span style="color: #0000FF;">justification</span>, perhaps of <span style="color: #0000FF;">secondary </span>importance, for continuing their sojourn in<br/>
Egypt. When they went there, it must be admitted, Egyptian credit was as low as it well<br/>
could be.<br/>

In 1882, it is estimated, English people owned<br/>
