<span>In Egypt for Health's Sake<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">quently </span>sought while in that heaven-favored land.<br/>
A well-known British physician, Dr. J ames Clarke,<br/>
writing on the subject of climates in their <span style="color: #ff0000;">healthgiving </span>aspect, wisely says: "The air, or climate, is<br/>
often regarded by patients as possessing some <span style="color: #ff0000;">speeife </span>quality by virtue of which it directly cures the<br/>
disease. This erroneous view of the matter not unfrequently proves the bane of the invalid, by leading<br/>
him, in the fullness of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">confidence </span>in climate,<br/>
to neglect other circumstances, <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>attention to<br/>
which may be more essential to his recovery than<br/>
that in which all his hopes are centered." And<br/>
again: "If a patient would reap the full measure of<br/>
good <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>his new position places within his reach,<br/>
he must trust more to his own conduct than to the<br/>
simple influence of any climate, however genial;<br/>
he must avail himself of all the advantages <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>the climate possesses, and eschew those disadvantages from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>no climate or situation is exempt;<br/>
moreover, he must exercise both resolution and<br/>
patience in prosecuting all this to a successful<br/>
issue."<br/>
<br/>
As a rule, <span style="color: #0000FF;">robust </span>as well as delicate visitors leave<br/>
Egypt too early in the spring, thereby undoing in<br/>
many instances the benefits of their sojourn by<br/>
encountering the cold weather of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Europa </span>The lst<br/>
of March sees a stampede to get away, and every<br/>
steamer goes crowded to its limit; the up-Nile<br/>
contingent is seized with a common impulse to get<br/>
to Rome or Venice or Paris for Easter Sunday, and<br/>
rushes pell-mell through Cairo to Alexandria or<br/>
the canal to take ship for the Continent, perhaps<br/>
