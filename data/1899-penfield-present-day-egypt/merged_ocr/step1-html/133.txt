happiness," and much more in the same vein. In<br/>
response to a memorial from the Queen of England,<br/>
many years ago, that sovereign was described by<br/>
the Sultan of Turkey as one praying for certain<br/>
privileges for her merchants. In bestowing the<br/>
prayed-for concession, the document from the Sultan described him thus modestly: <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>King of<br/>
kings, the Prince of emperors of every age, the<br/>
dispenser of crowns to monarchs, who, by divine<br/>
grace, assistance, will, benevolence," etc.<br/>
<br/>
But these dispensations, notwithstanding their<br/>
grandiloquence, have the force and character of<br/>
treaties, and guarantee to the stranger within the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultan</span>'s gates, whether in Turkey proper or in<br/>
Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">full </span>and complete immunity from laws governing native dwellers in those lands. Inviolability<br/>
of domicile, freedom from taxation of every sort, and<br/>
immunity from arrest for crime and misdemeanors,<br/>
are but items in the general promise not to molest<br/>
the alien. These treaties, it will readily be seen,<br/>
give to the nations possessing them almost every<br/>
privilege of extraterritoriality, and are guarded<br/>
with jealous watchfulness.<br/>
<br/>
The capitulations occasioned so much confusion<br/>
of jurisdiction in Egypt, where many Christian<br/>
nationalities were represented, that Nubar Pasha<br/>
called the attention of Ismail to the necessity for<br/>
reform, and himself drew up a project <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was<br/>
communicated to all the governments maintaining<br/>
representatives in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
As a result, an international commission assembled in 1869, under the presidency of Nubar, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who<br/>
