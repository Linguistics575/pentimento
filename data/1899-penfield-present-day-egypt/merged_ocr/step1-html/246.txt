to his horror that the draw was open, leaving a<br/>
yawning space over the muddy and eddying waters<br/>
forty feet below. It was too late to avoid the catastrophe, and the whole train was hurled into the<br/>
river. Halim Pasha, a splendid swimmer, managed<br/>
to extricate himself from the wreck and get ashore;<br/>
but Achmet was drowned in his compartment, thus<br/>
leaving the succession to the throne of Egypt clear<br/>
for his younger brother. Nubar found himself<br/>
disgraced temporarily, and with circumstantial<br/>
evidence pointing to him as a murderer, he found<br/>
it prudent, the tale runs, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">betake </span>himself to<br/>
Europe. As soon as Ismail ascended the throne,<br/>
he summoned Nubar Pasha to his side, and named<br/>
him prime minister, besides bestowing magnificent<br/>
presents of land and money upon the friend who,<br/>
so Cairo gossips say, had served him well.<br/>
Another instance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismail</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>disregard even for<br/>
human life, when seeking to attain an important<br/>

quondam favorite known as the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Moufettish</span>."<br/>
This <span style="color: #0000FF;">functionary</span>, holding the purse-strings of<br/>
Ismail's government, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>living in a splendor at<br/>
times eclipsing that of the khedive himself, and to<br/>
do this was plundering the people and the official<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cash-hox </span>with a recklessness that promised to hasten the impending national bankruptcy. Whether<br/>
this man was more the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dme </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">damn√©e </span>or the pernicious<br/>
counselor of his master is a point never fully settled.<br/>
In all probability he acted in both capacities, for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>his duplicity and cunning qualified him.<br/>
Ismail, having made certain that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moufettish<br/>
