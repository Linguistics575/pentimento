<br/>
more interesting than a visit to an "<span style="color: #ff0000;">ineubatory</span>"<br/>
in any one of the native villages in the neighborhood of the Pyramids. It will be found that the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">incubatory </span>is constructed of sun-dried bricks, and<br/>
so arranged internally that the eggs, placed in<br/>
mud-constructed ovens on trays cushioned with cut<br/>
straw, are constantly under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">attendant</span>'s view.<br/>
No scientific apparatus is employed by this man,<br/>
not even a thermometer. He knows from experience and his own feeling how much heat is<br/>
needed, and he systematically turns the eggs several times each day until they are developed into<br/>
peeping chicks. These hatching establishments<br/>
exist throughout Middle and Upper Egypt, and in<br/>
a season bring fully twenty million chickens into<br/>
the world, that grow up to be scrawny, un'attractive fowls. The industry is thousands of years old,<br/>
and seems conclusively to settle the question of a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">chieken</span>'s maternity by allocating that parentage<br/>
to the hen laying the egg. The incubator is a<br/>
foster-mother only, and is responsible for <span style="color: #0000FF;">stifling</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>the "setting" instinct with Egyptian hens. The<br/>
keepers of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">incubatories </span>have a system of <span style="color: #ff0000;">traffie<br/>
</span>with peasant farmers by which <span style="color: #0000FF;">eggs </span>are purchased<br/>
outright, or six live chicks <span style="color: #0000FF;">given </span>in exchange for<br/>
a dozen fresh eggs.<br/>
<br/>
V illa <span style="color: #0000FF;">life</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>quietude and health-giving air, is<br/>
offered at <span style="color: #ff0000;">1hiiiiilir</span>, six or eight miles to the eastward of Cairo. Uninteresting itself, the village is<br/>
surrounded by points of historical association in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>number to keep the <span style="color: #0000FF;">attention </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sojourners </span>occupied for a few weeks at least.. The plain<br/>
