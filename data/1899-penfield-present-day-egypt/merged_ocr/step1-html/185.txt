The making of the dam will force the nude population of the region to prosecute their amphibious<br/>
pursuits elsewhere-most likely in eddying rapids<br/>
farther down-stream. But the daring soul who has<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">shot </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>what will remain of the cataract will, as of<br/>
old, be landed on the bank at Assuan to the resounding "Heep, heep, hooray! Zank you, zank<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">you</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>of his crew of black rowers, whom he will<br/>
liberally bakshish while yet believing himself a<br/>
hero.<br/>
<br/>
The American sun-seeker or English milord,<br/>
making the voyage to Wady-Halfa by his own<br/>
dahabiyeh, will no longer have his craft hauled up<br/>
the Assuan cataract by a hundred shrieking Arabs<br/>
and Berberins, for most likely it will be taken up<br/>
the rapids and through the locks by electricity<br/>
generated by the rushing Nile itself. Indeed, a<br/>
practical Britisher is in the field for utilizing the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eataraet</span>'s force for electrically lighting <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan </span>and<br/>
propelling irrigating machinery for a hundred miles<br/>
or more down-stream, to the possible relief of the<br/>
familiar shadoof and creaking sakieh.<br/>
<br/>
The Assuan structure will differ in several respects from any great dam hitherto built. In<br/>
the first place, none for impounding water has<br/>
ever been made on any river <span style="color: #0000FF;">approaching </span>the size<br/>
of the Nile; and, in the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">place</span>, it is to be<br/>
both dam and waterway, a conjunction exceedingly<br/>
difficult to effect. To <span style="color: #0000FF;">confine </span>Father Nile in floodtime would be hopeless, and therefore the river<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>be allowed to run unimpeded through the dam<br/>
