<span>Britain's Position in Egypt<br/>

thing may "turn up <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>helpful to the legal aspect of<br/>
England's position in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
To get rid of the present anomalous position, a<br/>
great many people in the British Isles and elsewhere would be glad if diplomatic <span style="color: #ff0000;">fietions </span>could be<br/>
brushed away, and the whole of the territory tributary to the Nile openly declared to be a portion of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Queen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Irictoria</span>'s empire. But at present the British<br/>
government thinks it wiser to make'sure of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">substance </span>than to pay attention to shadowy phrases.<br/>
British withdrawal would be an act of justice to<br/>
sultan and khedive, but would serve no other<br/>
legitimate interest. To annex Egypt, as France<br/>
did Madagascar, would probably stir up animosities<br/>
resulting in war.<br/>
<br/>
The masterly victory of Turkish troops in the<br/>
Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">war </span>was a blow to Englishmen and others<br/>
who believed the disintegration of the Ottoman empire to be near at hand. They had already experienced a set-back when the Armenian disorders<br/>
failed to shake the Sultan's throne, and the result<br/>
of the Greco-Turkish war caused a painful awakening as to the true state of the health of the "Sick<br/>
Man of Europe." A break-up of the Sultan's empire<br/>
may come in time, and Egypt fall to England, and<br/>
Syria to France, in the general parceling out of<br/>
Turkish possessions. But the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sick </span>Man" keeps<br/>
such watchful attention on the Bosporus that the<br/>
scramble for Ottoman territory may be postponed<br/>
for many a long year.<br/>
