<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
It is known that England invited France to share<br/>
the responsibilities of the bombardment; but it is<br/>
not known that France was urged to <span style="color: #ff0000;">eo6perate </span>in<br/>
the enterprise, or that anything <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>said on the<br/>
point of a division of the spoils that would naturally<br/>
fall to the power or powers undertaking the quelling of the Arabi insurrection. At all events, the<br/>
French fleet took its leave of the country where<br/>
French sympathies and <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>had prevailed<br/>
from the going there of Napoleon in 1798. As detailed in another chapter, Britain's fleet remained<br/>
and reduced the best part of Alexandria to dust,<br/>
making a prisoner of the rebel leader, and in a<br/>
brief period stamped out what had been an indifferently planned uprising of that portion of<br/>
Egypt's population easily swayed to fanaticism.<br/>
<br/>
If Englishmen have any really vital interest in<br/>
Africa, it is to <span style="color: #0000FF;">monopolize </span>the Nile, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>means<br/>
more to their nation than the control of the Niger,<br/>
the Kongo, and the Zambesi combined; for the N ile<br/>
is as potential commercially as it is politically, and<br/>
the country lying at its mouth is the strategical<br/>
keystone to Britain's Indian and Eastern superstructure. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Statesmen </span>and publicists throughout<br/>
Europe are perpetually discussing what they term<br/>
the Egyptian question or the Sudan question, and<br/>
dilating upon the rights of England in Egypt; but<br/>
these are minor themes and subordinate to the<br/>
great Nile question.<br/>
<br/>
Great Britain already controls every foot of the<br/>
Nile valley not in barbaric hands, means to have it<br/>
all, and has no intention of sharing the river with<br/>
