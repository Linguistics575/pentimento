mosques. Ramadan is observed by the masses<br/>
with fasting by day, for nothing passes their lips;<br/>
even the cigarette is eschewed. But the instant the<br/>
sun disappears-below the horizon, feasting begins,<br/>
and, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">smoking </span>and merrymaking, lasts well<br/>
through the night. The mortality is very great<br/>
when Ramadan comes in summer.<br/>

The occasion of a wedding is a favorite revel.<br/>
Noisy processions, feasting of friends, and feeding<br/>
of poor, last nearly a week<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The wealthy pasha or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bey </span>gives a public character to his <span style="color: #ff0000;">nuptiais </span>by<br/>
having a military band and perhaps an escort of<br/>
soldiers head the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cortege </span>bearing the bride to her<br/>
new home. A bride elect of the middle class is<br/>
dragged indefinitely about the streets, hidden<br/>
within a closed carriage by Persian shawls drawn<br/>
over the windows, and preceded usually by a clattering band producing the most penetrating of.<br/>
music from discordant instruments. A string of<br/>
camels brings the furniture and gaudily painted<br/>
boxes to her future husband's house, and for several nights the home of the happy pair is bright<br/>
with lamps, and gay with thousands of <span style="color: #ff0000;">red-andgreen </span>flags stretched across the street. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">spectacular </span>procession is that in which the happy woman<br/>
is carried in a palanquin, borne by two camels, and<br/>
surrounded by wild-looking fiends of the desert<br/>
on other camels, who extract an unconscionable<br/>
amount of noise from kettledrums. This is a survival of the Cairo of old, and if the procession be<br/>
headed by half-naked mountebanks and swordsmen<br/>
who frequently engage in mimic combat, and a<br/>
