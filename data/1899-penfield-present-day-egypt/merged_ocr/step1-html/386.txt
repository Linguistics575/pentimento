<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
the Egyptian sanitary <span style="color: #0000FF;">service-a </span>thoroughly organized department of the national administration-the Nile country would probably not have<br/>
escaped the recent scourge of bubonic plague<br/>
originating in Bombay. The presence of a few<br/>
isolated cases in Alexandria, disquieting as the<br/>
despatches were, in no way imperiled the country. The time has passed when an ordinary outbreak of cholera or plague can menace winter<br/>
visitors to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt-Gough </span>the proprietors of Continental winter-resorts are never angry when<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Continental </span>newspapers announce the appearance<br/>
of an infectious disease in Egypt.<br/>

A good dragoman contributes much to one's<br/>
comfort and enjoyment. Persons spending the<br/>
season in or near Cairo, or making the usual tour<br/>
of the Nile, have no need of a special dragoman.<br/>
N early every steamer provides well-informed<br/>
guides. For sight-seeing in towns, or brief excursions, one may be taken for the day-and hotels<br/>
swarm with them. A good dragoman is a blessing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">undisguised</span>; but one in whom you lack <span style="color: #0000FF;">confidence<br/>
</span>is an unmitigated misfortune. Interpreter-guides<br/>
proffer their services at steamship landing, railwaystation, and even in the street. Most of them are<br/>
plausible and insinuating, but a display of firmness<br/>
will protect the visitor from imposition. They are<br/>
cunning students of human nature, but easily kept<br/>
in place. It is wise to engage a dragoman recommended by <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>acquaintance who has tested him, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>one guaranteed by a reputable agency<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Most of<br/>
the professional guides are capable, painstaking,<br/>
