<span>Story of the Suez Canal<br/>
<br/>
simultaneous action, the outcome being a spirited<br/>
appeal to the Sublime Porte to have the <span style="color: #0000FF;">barbarities<br/>
</span>stopped. The Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>entreated, it is also<br/>
claimed, to give orders to have the work on the<br/>
canal cease altogether. This he could do, for his<br/>
Imperial Majesty had never <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmed </span>the concession under which the canal was being built. For<br/>
a reason not <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffie11lt </span>to discern, M. de Lesseps had<br/>
omitted to consult him, and the gentlemen forming<br/>
his divan, on the momentous subject.<br/>
<br/>
French diplomacy was called upon to nullify the<br/>
effect of Great Britain's interference, the canal ring<br/>
swarmed on the Bosporus-and the Sultan announced a happy compromise of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty</span>, by<br/>
formally approving the concession of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">vessel</span>, on<br/>
condition that the peasant should no longer be<br/>
forced to do the digging; this was <span style="color: #ff0000;">speeifieally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">forbidden</span>. The Sultan even hinted at the propriety<br/>
of employing machinery.<br/>
<br/>
Here was a grievance of real magnitude, the De<br/>
Lesseps cohort claimed; and they promptly <span style="color: #0000FF;">announced </span>their determination to hold the khedive<br/>
responsible for the Sultan's <span style="color: #0000FF;">action</span>, although the<br/>
imperial indorsement was an essential clause in<br/>
the Said concession, and any legal tribunal would<br/>
have said there was no breach of <span style="color: #ff0000;">eontraet</span>--for no<br/>
contract existed, and the concession imposed no<br/>
obligation or liability upon Egypt. French journals in the pay of the canal raised a furious outcry, and De Lesseps and his lieutenants beat their<br/>
tom-toms with unceasing <span style="color: #0000FF;">clamor</span>, insisting that<br/>
without fellah labor the canal could never be<br/>
