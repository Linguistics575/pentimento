the law in its full vigor might be avoided, and the<br/>
doctrine itself left intact. Treaty measures were<br/>
thought of. But it would never do to call them<br/>
treaties. The representative on earth of the prophet could never treat a Christian ruler as an equal.<br/>
The sultans considered themselves the only sovereigns of the earth; all others deserved nothing but<br/>
pity and toleration. Treaties could be entered into<br/>
only with their equals, they argued. To their inferiors only grants and favors were possible.<br/>
<br/>
So the word "<span style="color: #0000FF;">capitulation</span>," meaning letter of<br/>
privilege, was brought into use. No reciprocal<br/>
obligation was constituted by a capitulation, as it<br/>
was meant to be a purely gratuitous concession and<br/>
favor granted to Christians, by virtue of which they<br/>
were to be tolerated upon the soil of Islam.<br/>
<br/>
The need for this concession on the part of the<br/>

not the ships of the western world come to their<br/>
eastern shores to exchange with them the products<br/>
of the Levant, these products would have had no<br/>
outlet, and the producing country a limited source<br/>
of wealth; and had not the merchant of Europe<br/>
been able to establish his domicile in the land of the<br/>
Moslem, his ships would never have approached<br/>
Turkish shores. Some of the capitulations with<br/>
the Italian republics were dated as early as 1150.<br/>
In an early capitulation with France the Sultan<br/>
called himself "the Sultan of glorious sultans, Emperor of powerful emperors, distributor of crowns<br/>
to those seated upon thrones, the Shadow of God<br/>
upon earth, the asylum of justice, the fount of<br/>

I I o<br/>
