ther realize considerable sums from the sale'of<br/>
reclaimed public lands, and indirect revenues traceable to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span>'s augmented producing capacity. The customs and railways are certain to show<br/>
large increases, and the reservoir will thus add<br/>
considerably to the security behind Egyptian bonds<br/>
of all classes.<br/>
<br/>
The British diplomatic agent in Egypt, Lord<br/>
Cromer, has recently had something to say on the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">finaneial </span>aspects of the reservoir measure, as at<br/>
first sight it might appear a somewhat hazardous undertaking to increase the liabilities of the<br/>
Egyptian treasury while development of the Sudan is only entered upon. It is Lord <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cromer's<br/>
</span>belief that the expenditure of capital to improve<br/>
the water-supply, thereby increasing the revenue,<br/>
affords the best and most certain <span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>out of the<br/>
pecuniary <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties </span>attending the <span style="color: #ff0000;">reoeeupation </span>of<br/>
the Sudan. As regards the views of the native<br/>
population concerning the Assuan reservoir, he informed his government that he had never before<br/>
known a measure to be received with such unanimous approbation; and Lord Cromer knows, for<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span>Egypt is largely his creation.<br/>
<br/>
There is a legend that the yearly flooding of the<br/>
Nile is caused by the tears shed by Isis over the<br/>
tomb of Osiris, and the question has for uncounted<br/>
centuries been asked as a type of impossibility,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gen </span>man arrest the tears of Isis as they <span style="color: #ff0000;">flowt</span>"<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oseph </span>of Israel did it, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharaoh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>command, by<br/>
constructing a reservoir and canals, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>fertilized<br/>
