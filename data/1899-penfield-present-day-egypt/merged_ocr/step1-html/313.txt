<span>The Present Khedival Family<br/>
<br/>
Mohammedan custom, however, and was most popular with the Egyptians.<br/>
<br/>
For the Koubbeh estate the khedive has imported<br/>
American farm machinery, to illustrate the advantages of tilling with modern appliances. There are<br/>
extensive stables filled with choice horses from various parts of the world. The position of honor<br/>
is given to a magnificent Arabian steed with <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowing </span>tail, sent to Abbas Pasha by the Sultan. Close<br/>
by is the English thoroughbred Cedar, presented<br/>
by the late Colonel North, and in a neighboring<br/>
stall stands an American trotter, the gift of an admiring <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philadelphian</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The dairy, kennels, and poultry-yard at Koubbeh<br/>
are supplied with selected animals and fowls from<br/>
every clime, and in them the khedive takes the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">keenest </span>interest. For the work-people there is a<br/>
model village, with mosque, school, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">meetingplace </span>where discussion is encouraged after the<br/>
lyceum idea-all supported by the khedive, to<br/>
demonstrate the benefits of order, cleanliness, and<br/>
community of interests. The native <span style="color: #ff0000;">fire-brigade</span>,<br/>
with English apparatus, would be creditable anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
So devoted is Egypt's young ruler to horses that<br/>
from his private purse he maintains a commission<br/>
to improve horse-breeding. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>offers valuable<br/>
prizes at horse-shows, and himself makes entries<br/>
for the races during the Cairo season, when it not<br/>
infrequently happens that his colors are carried to<br/>
victory by his native jockey. The khedive enjoys<br/>
driving, and may often be met in the outskirts of<br/>
