the Assuan site, with its bed of syenite granite<br/>
beneath the river, the conformation of the surrounding country, and the inexhaustible supply of<br/>
stone near by, offered advantages approached by<br/>
no other location.<br/>
<br/>
A situation thirty miles south, at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalabsheh</span>, was<br/>
favored by some; but the structure proposed, necessarily resting on a foundation of crumbly sandstone, could not be regarded as permanent or as<br/>
safe as if it rested on a foundation of granite. The<br/>
Silsila Gate, fifty miles north of Assuan, having<br/>
the same underlying sandstone, was rejected as a<br/>
site on the ground of insecurity. A dam there,<br/>
besides, would submerge the temple at <span style="color: #ff0000;">KomOmbos</span>, as well as a good part of the town of Assuan. Hence all the engineers in the end favored<br/>
damming the Nile at the first cataract, at a point<br/>
about four miles south of Assuan, and not far<br/>
from the island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philas</span>. There nature has been<br/>
lavish in providing hills of solid rock on each side<br/>
of the river that will stand the ravages of the elements as long as the world lasts.<br/>
<br/>
Little time was wasted in the preparation of the<br/>
original plans for the dam. But the <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieials </span>having the matter in charge, intent only on the utilitarian aspect of the problem, brought about their<br/>
heads, four or five years ago, a wide-spread outburst<br/>
of indignation, when it was announced that the<br/>
treasured ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>would be submerged for<br/>
months at a time, were their recommendations carried into effect. Meetings were held by learned<br/>
societies everywhere to protest against any <span style="color: #ff0000;">desecra<br/>
