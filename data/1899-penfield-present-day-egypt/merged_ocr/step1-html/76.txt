desert fighter. In command of the mounted troops<br/>
at the battle of Toski, in 1889, young Kitchener<br/>
headed off the great dervish general, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Njumi</span>, who<br/>
had annihilated <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hicks</span>'s army, and who despised'<br/>
Egyptian soldiers, compelling him to stand, fight,<br/>
and be crushed. Rapidly ascending the grades<br/>
thereafter, Kitchener in a few years found himself<br/>
the sirdar of the khedival army.<br/>
<br/>
To Kitchener belongs the credit of organizing<br/>
and training the new army, recruited from the fellaheen of the country. To build up an effective<br/>
force from the same peasants who had fled before<br/>

attain success. To accomplish the end crowning<br/>

Egyptian nature. Had Kitchener and his aides not<br/>
triumphed in this, the Egyptian army could never<br/>
have driven back its old-time foes from Firket,<br/>
from Dongola, from Berber, and finally from<br/>
Omdurman itself. Yet the heroes of Omdurman<br/>
were the brothers of the cravens who made the<br/>
name Tel-el-Kebir a synonym for all that is cowardly. And only sixteen years had intervened between the two battles! After the routing of the<br/>
Khalifa's army no fair-minded person can criticize<br/>
the fighting capacity of the son of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, when<br/>
well led. It used to be the fashion to sneer at him<br/>
as a warrior, and not without reason. Even, now<br/>
