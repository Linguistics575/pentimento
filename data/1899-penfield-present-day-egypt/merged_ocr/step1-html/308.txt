<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
This approving formula had become habitual<br/>
with him in commending British yeomanry and<br/>
volunteers, but in this case was uttered with unmistakable sincerity. The old duke had seen more<br/>
practical soldiering on the plains of Abbassieh than<br/>
he had anticipated, and from that time he has been<br/>
an admirer of the young khedive.<br/>
<br/>
Abbas Pasha never disobeys the command of the<br/>
Koran by tasting wines or spirits, and the example<br/>
to the youth of his country is carried further, for<br/>
he is a total abstainer <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tobacco</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, in a<br/>
land where nearly everybody smokes cigarettes<br/>
from morning until night, means much.<br/>
<br/>
A striking phase of character for one occupying<br/>

Palace is finished, a cavalry guard escorts him to<br/>
the palace of Koubbeh, five miles out of Cairo, on<br/>
the border of the desert. There is little suggesting<br/>
princely estate about Koubbeh, save the few soldiers of the khedival guard and the musicians<br/>
and drummer-boys lounging in front of their quarters. The palace looks like the seat of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-conditioned </span>European family of country tastes. The<br/>
presence of its master is indicated by the scarlet<br/>
flag bearing the threefold star and crescent floating over the palace.<br/>
<br/>
The khedive's consort, described by those who<br/>
know her as an attractive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Circassian</span>, and the<br/>
four little children, are installed at Koubbeh <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the winter season. It is likewise the home<br/>
