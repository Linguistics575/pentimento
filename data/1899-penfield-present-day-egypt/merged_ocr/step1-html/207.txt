<span>Story of the Suez Canal<br/>
<br/>
is responsible for the mortgaging of the Egyptian<br/>
people, body and soul, inasmuch as it inspired and<br/>
developed to an inordinate degree the borrowing<br/>
habit of two of their rulers. Prior to the giving<br/>
of the canal concession in 1856, by Viceroy Said,<br/>
Egypt had no debt whatever. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Her </span>credit was first<br/>
pledged in Europe by Said Pasha, who, to add luster to his name, subscribed seventeen million dollars to the stock of the canal enterprise, although<br/>
the undertaking was to cost Egypt nothing, and<br/>
for ninety-nine years the country was to receive<br/>
from it fifteen per cent. of the gross revenue.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Said</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>vainglorious act laid the corner-stone of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>new house of bondage.<br/>
<br/>
Ismail, succeeding to the throne, lent himself<br/>
readily to the seductive project. Learning how<br/>
easy it was to get money simply by <span style="color: #0000FF;">affixing </span>his<br/>
signature to an innocent-looking paper, thoughtfully prepared in Europe, thenceforth there was<br/>
frequent exchange between the khedive and the<br/>
money-capitals of Europe of these innocent-looking papers for gold. There were many investors<br/>
in the canal scheme, of course; but it seemed as if<br/>
Egypt was ever feeding the insatiable monster with<br/>
money, and human life as well; for <span style="color: #0000FF;">fear </span>fifths of<br/>
the laborers who dug the vast ditch were drafted<br/>
from the Egyptian peasantry, and so poorly cared<br/>
for that thousands died. A day of reckoning came,<br/>
however, when <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>engagements could not be<br/>
met; for Egypt was hypothecated to its utmost<br/>
value, and the usurers of Europe made such bitter<br/>
outcry that Ismail Pasha was forced by the Sultan,<br/>
