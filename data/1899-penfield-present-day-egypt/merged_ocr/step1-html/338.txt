bonds to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">face-value </span>of two hundred and seven <span style="color: #ff0000;">tyfive </span>million dollars, and these could not have <span style="color: #0000FF;">been</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>sold then for more than half that sum. "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>are now quoted at a premium of from three<br/>
to six per <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>, and the difference between the<br/>
market value in 1882 and the value <span style="color: #ff0000;">to-day </span>of<br/>
England's supposed <span style="color: #ff0000;">finaneial </span>stake <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>the<br/>
comfortable sum of one <span style="color: #0000FF;">hundred.and </span>forty million<br/>
dollars-sufficient to pay for the army of occupation for more than a century! This restoration of<br/>
Egyptian credit has benefited all bondholders <span style="color: #0000FF;">proportionately-French</span>, German, Italian, Austrian,<br/>
and Russian, as well as English.<br/>
<br/>
An incidental reason why Great Britain retains<br/>
her hold upon Egypt is that the cotton crop of<br/>
the Nile valley reduces more and more each year<br/>
the dependence of British spindles upon the cottonfields of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
There are also several considerations of minor<br/>
importance Which have <span style="color: #0000FF;">influenced </span>the Egyptian<br/>
policy of England. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">reconquest </span>of the Sudan<br/>
could be prosecuted only from the north, and<br/>
geographers are agreed that whoever controls<br/>
equatorial Africa and the sources of the Nile becomes the natural holder of Egypt. Therefore, <span style="color: #0000FF;">without </span>Egypt firmly in hand, the ambition of British<br/>
map-makers for a zone of territory stretching continuously from Cape Town to Cairo, and bringing<br/>
more than half the African continent under British<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influence</span>, must of necessity be abandoned.<br/>

The statement so often seen in French journals<br/>
that Egypt possesses a value to England as a dump<br/>
