<span>Britain's Position <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Rhodes's materializing project for building with<br/>
British money a Cape-to-Cairo railway, taken <span style="color: #0000FF;">together</span>, cannot give the foes of British domination<br/>
in Egypt much hope for expecting any radical<br/>
change of program for many years to come. I<br/>
am told that to this day there is periodical speculation in Spain as to when England may be expected to restore to the Spanish government the<br/>
rock of Gibraltar. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Having </span>this event always in<br/>
contemplation, the Madrid council has for a century regularly appointed a grandee to the governorship of the rocky promontory that gives Great<br/>
Britain control of the Mediterranean. The departure of the English from Egypt is as unlikely to<br/>
happen as their restoration of Gibraltar to the<br/>
Spaniards.<br/>
<br/>
The statesmen guiding France in 1882 claimed to<br/>
recognize no necessity for bombarding Alexandria,<br/>
and when it was decided that <span style="color: #0000FF;">England</span>'s ships were<br/>
to fire upon the city, the French admiral was<br/>
ordered to remove his fleet from the scene of <span style="color: #ff0000;">confr1et</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Frenchmen still insist that the Arabi rebellion<br/>
could have been successfully dealt with on shore,<br/>
and that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">razing </span>of Alexandria was wanton destruction. When the war-ships of France steamed<br/>
away from Alexandria they decided the fate of<br/>
their country as a participator in the affairs of<br/>
Egypt, and the record of that J uly day is an eventful page in French history, and marks the beginning<br/>
of the claim on the part of England to govern<br/>
single-handed a country forming no part of the<br/>
British empire.<br/>
