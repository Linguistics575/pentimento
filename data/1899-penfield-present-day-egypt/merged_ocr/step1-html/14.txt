<span>Preface<br/>
<br/>
the Egyptologist, antiquarian, nor historian: these<br/>
are favored already with a bibliography <span style="color: #ff0000;">stra1ning<br/>
</span>the shelves of every library. Aiming at being a discursive budget of information and <span style="color: #0000FF;">comment </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-social</span>, political, economic, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">administrative</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the volume presents a series of faithful pictures<br/>
of the Egypt that is interesting to the winter<br/>
visitor, health-seeker, and general reader, desirous<br/>
of learning something, and not too much, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">contemporary </span>conditions in the oldest country in the<br/>
world. "is written in no partial or partizan spirit, and advances no theory of<br/>
the purpose of the Pyramids, nor attempts to explain the riddle of the Sphinx.<br/>
