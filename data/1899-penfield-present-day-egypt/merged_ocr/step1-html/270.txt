household, in his volume of reminiscences of court<br/>
life in Egypt. "When I came to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">throne</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>Tewfik is <span style="color: #ff0000;">reported</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>have said, "I received the news<br/>
without joy. Sympathy with my father's fall, and<br/>
the great sense of responsibility, left me no room<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">rejoicing</span>. After my father's courtly salutation,<br/>
acknowledging me as his <span style="color: #ff0000;">effendina</span>, he heaped <span style="color: #0000FF;">reproaches </span>upon me and accused me of having at last<br/>
intrigued successfully. I then produced two letters<br/>
from one of his former ministers, received when I<br/>
was acting as regent, in his absence from the country. These offered me the support of the army; and<br/>
if I consented to the minister's plot, it was proposed<br/>
to destroy the khedival yacht when it returned to<br/>
Alexandria, sending Ismail to the bottom of the<br/>

Ismail became Viceroy. He was born in 1852, and<br/>
his mother was an attendant slave in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismail</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>harem.<br/>
Her princely master acknowledged the child and<br/>
added its mother to his list of lawful wives, completing the quota of four allowed by his religion.<br/>
Other sons were born to Ismail shortly after, but<br/>
no amount of intriguing on the part of their<br/>
mothers could alter the fact that the child brought<br/>
into the world by the harem slave was their liege<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lord</span>'s first-born and heir. Ismail from the first<br/>
could not conceal his dislike of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>he disliked even more his uncle, Halim. In applying<br/>
