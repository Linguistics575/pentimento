<br/>
of the shops. Rotund women, enveloped in the<br/>
unbecoming black-silk habbeh, displaying feet and<br/>
ankles clad in magenta stockings and white slippers, seem to go out of their way to <span style="color: #0000FF;">jostle </span>Europeans,<br/>
until driven off by one's dragoman. Donkeys, even<br/>
camels, laden with merchandise, force their way<br/>
through passages scarcely wide enough for two<br/>
persons walking abreast. These, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>persistent<br/>
beggars and offensively dirty children, are the<br/>
drawbacks to <span style="color: #0000FF;">one</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>enjoyment here. But the<br/>
bazaars are interesting, withal.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the way back through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mouski </span>a half-hour<br/>
may <span style="color: #0000FF;">profitably </span>be passed in viewing the fabrication<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">1Tatoun</span>'s or Parvis's of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mushrabeah </span>work, to<br/>
be utilized in artistic screens and tables. Primitive<br/>
indeed is the method of turning the myriad bits of<br/>
wood for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mushrabeah</span>, on tiny lathes revolved<br/>
by hand, while the chisel is held by the bare feet of<br/>
the operator, generally a lad, who guides the tool<br/>
with the other hand.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mouski </span>used to be all that an Oriental street<br/>
of shops should be, but the past dozen years have<br/>
seen a great change in its character. There no<br/>
longer is matting overhead, affording protection<br/>
from the parching sun in summer. In its place<br/>
swinging signs indicate the presence of modern establishments, including a "British Bar," where all<br/>
and sundry are cordially invited to try the American drinks compounded by La Belle <span style="color: #0000FF;">Violette</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>"just<br/>
arrived from Chicago." There are jewelers' shops<br/>
that would attract notice in the Avenue de <span style="color: #0000FF;">l'Op√©ra<br/>
</span>in Paris, the windows of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are filled with dia<br/>
