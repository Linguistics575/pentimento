Time went on, and work on the canal proceeded<br/>
with halting pace. Although the khedive ordered<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>thousand peasants every three <span style="color: #0000FF;">months<br/>
</span>to the isthmus, canal-making by a process so primitive as the scooping of the sand with bare hands<br/>
into palm-leaf baskets, to be carried up the steep<br/>
bank and emptied, without mechanical assistance<br/>
of any sort, was slow work. The taskmasters used<br/>
the lash liberally, but forgot about the agreement<br/>
to provide for the medical and sanitary welfare of<br/>
the poor slaves. The food was wretched and <span style="color: #0000FF;">insufficient</span>; and the matter of the nominal <span style="color: #0000FF;">compensation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span>, that was something that did not concern the fellaheen, forced to labor in the corvée.<br/>

Long viewing with distrust and disapproval the<br/>
work that in time was to give the world an open<br/>
sesame to their treasure-house in the East, English<br/>
peeple were particularly loud in their outcry against<br/>
the treatment of the poor Egyptians. J ohn <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bull's<br/>
</span>philanthropy and political interest were aroused to<br/>
<br/>
dence of administration and judiciaries, right of concluding treaties<br/>
of commerce with foreign governments, right of coining money, right<br/>
of borrowing money, and permission to increase his army and navy.<br/>
These were the provisions of autonomy, in consideration of which<br/>
he was to pay an annual tribute to the Sultan of £681,538.<br/>
