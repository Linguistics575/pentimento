<span>Britain's Position in Egypt<br/>
<br/>
seemingly takes upon itself the task of policing half<br/>
the world, sent Arabi and his principal supporters<br/>
into exile in British territory, for a crime in no sense<br/>
committed against England. Thus, for usurping<br/>
the khedival <span style="color: #0000FF;">prerogative </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, plainly stated,<br/>
can have no other meaning than the right to direct<br/>
the administration of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt-Arabs </span>was guilty of<br/>
an offense punishable by death or deportation.<br/>
<br/>
The British <span style="color: #ff0000;">goirernment </span>announced, shortly after<br/>
the crushing of Arabi, that its "<span style="color: #ff0000;">drmy </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">occupation</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>would be withdrawn as soon as law and order<br/>
could be restored, and a date six months thence<br/>
was actually fixed for the departure of the troops.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Her </span>philanthropic task not being completed, in her<br/>
opinion, at the end of the six months, an extension<br/>
of time for another six months was made. At all<br/>
events, the occupation was to last only for the brief<br/>
period that would be necessary to teach the Egyptians the easy art of self-government. But the<br/>
soldiers have never left Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Thus the word <span style="color: #0000FF;">tt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">occupation</span>" promises for many<br/>
years to be applied to a novel operation in territorial expansion, entered upon in the name' of humanity; and the right of ruling Egypt, taken from<br/>
the khedive by Arabi the rebel, and technically<br/>
wrested from him by Great Britain, will probably<br/>
never again fully reside in the family of Mehemet<br/>
Ali. Military occupation indefinitely extended, as<br/>
illustrated in Egypt, amounts to annexation. The<br/>
present system is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">euphemistically </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>some a<br/>
"veiled protectorate."<br/>
