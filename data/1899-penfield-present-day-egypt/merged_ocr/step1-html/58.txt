Electric <span style="color: #0000FF;">tram-ears </span>now rush boisterously through<br/>
the streets of Cairo, filled with people who never<br/>
understood the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>go <span style="color: #ff0000;">fevermur1til </span>the advent of the<br/>
street-railway, two or three years ago; and the<br/>
Egyptians' best friend, the donkey, has been east<br/>
out from the capital by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">trolley-car</span>. The<br/>
Egyptians take so kindly to <span style="color: #ff0000;">tram-car </span>riding that<br/>
one wonders if their ancestors, who developed astronomy and mathematics as sciences and <span style="color: #0000FF;">beget<br/>
</span>culture, knew the secret of the electric current. The<br/>
patrons of the tram-ears are soldiers, Levantines,<br/>
small merchants and clerks, turbaned sheiks, Bedouins, and simple <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellaheen </span>in town on business<br/>

run, their occupants looking pityingly upon wayfarers employing nature's locomotion or the humble<br/>
donkey or stalking camel. The people have learned<br/>
the intricacies of "transfers "and "round trips," and<br/>
their satisfaction over the street traction enterprise,<br/>
doing more than all other agencies to obliterate the<br/>
Cairo of old, seems sublime.<br/>
<br/>
There is something painfully incongruous in the<br/>
idea of being carried by trolley to the Sphinx and<br/>
Pyramids. But the line enables the visitor who has<br/>
first driven in state to Gizeh to go again and again<br/>
at a cost of a few piasters. The authorities con<br/>
