more was due for the current year. Simple as<br/>
was the giving of such a receipt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">nothing </span>more<br/>
potent for alleviating the position of the fellaheen<br/>
was ever inaugurated. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a reform benefiting<br/>
every tiller of the soil, and was in operation before<br/>
"the coming of the English."<br/>
<br/>
The scheme of taxation in force for some years<br/>
has been arbitrary and inequitable. A definite tax<br/>
has been prescribed for certain districts, which only<br/>
a portion of the land was capable of paying. The<br/>
reform in hand has been to create a schedule based<br/>
upon rental values, that each acre may be assessed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">commensurately </span>with its producing capacity. The<br/>
total taxation of the country is not to be increased<br/>
under the new system, the movement being intended to relieve the small proprietor, who will pay<br/>
less per acre, while the pasha landlord, once powerful enough to have his thousands of acres assessed<br/>
at whatever he chose to pay, will be called upon to<br/>
contribute to the public expenses by a proportionately higher estimate of land values. These glaring inequalities were brought into prominence by<br/>
the decreasing prices of crops, and relief was imperatively necessary.<br/>
<br/>
The land-tax has ever been the millstone about<br/>
the neck of the Egyptian, sapping his energies and<br/>
stunting his intellectual growth. The ancestors of<br/>
the peasant now toiling from <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>before sunrise<br/>
until after sunset, nearly every day in the year,<br/>
have been tillers of the soil and drawers of water<br/>
since the world began; and their incessant toil has<br/>
produced but little-for them. It will surprise<br/>
