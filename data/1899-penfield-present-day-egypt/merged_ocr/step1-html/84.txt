even for a lifetime; but from three to six years is<br/>
the usual course. One may see old and grizzled<br/>
men there, as well as children of four years. The<br/>
institution is so richly endowed and owns such<br/>
valuable <span style="color: #ff0000;">property-Mor </span>few true Mohammedans of<br/>

the expenses.<br/>

The masters get no pay, but receive liberal <span style="color: #ff0000;">a11owanees </span>of food. Those of certain degree once<br/>
