more. In this department reside the wife or wives<br/>
and children of the master, with the addition, perhaps, of his mother. In this case her rule is probably absolute. It is she who chooses instructresses<br/>
for the children, orders the affairs of the household,<br/>
and even prescribes the fabrics, fashions, and adornments of the women, who are simply the wives of<br/>
his Excellency the Pasha. It is mother-in-law rule,<br/>
literally. The windows of the harem usually overlook a courtyard or rear street, and are screened<br/>
with <span style="color: #ff0000;">mushrabeah </span>lattices, penetrable only by the<br/>
gaze of a person within. To minister to the wants<br/>
of the women's division, a small army of servants-shiny black "from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubia </span>and Berber, and<br/>
possibly a fair Circassian or two, imported from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Constantinople-is </span>essential. "Slavery" of this<br/>
sort is scarcely bondage. It is the law of Egypt<br/>
that manumission can be had for the asking, with<br/>
little <span style="color: #0000FF;">circumlocution </span>or delay. These servitors are<br/>
kindly treated, value their home, and shrink from<br/>
any movement toward legal freedom. Except to<br/>
the master and sons of the house, the harem is<br/>
closed to all men, but women friends come and go<br/>
freely. The tall, high-cheek-boned black men<br/>
guarding the entrance to the harem, in these progressive days in Egypt possessing no suggestion<br/>
of the houri scene of the stage, are trained from<br/>
childhood to keep unauthorized persons from intruding, and have a highly developed aversion to<br/>
sight-seers.<br/>

The howling dervish of Cairo is more or less a<br/>
