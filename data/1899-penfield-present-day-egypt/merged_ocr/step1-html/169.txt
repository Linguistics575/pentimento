<span>Expansion by Irrigation<br/>
<br/>
ity at Khartum practically determined this, as it<br/>
means that in time the Sudan provinces will be<br/>
important grain-exporters.<br/>
<br/>
The agricultural industry that will be chiefly<br/>
benefited by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan </span>reservoir and the tributary weir at Assiut is cane-culture. With Cuba's<br/>
productiveness greatly impaired as a result of the<br/>
prolonged strife <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the island, the opening years<br/>
of the twentieth century are considered propitious<br/>
for doubling or trebling Egypt's output of raw<br/>
sugar. The Nile cane is of such exceptional quality that much European capital has been invested<br/>
in its cultivation, while crushing-factories have<br/>
gone up on the river's banks as if by magic.<br/>
<br/>
No subject is receiving wider attention at this<br/>
time than that of territorial expansion. Great<br/>
Britain, as well as France, Germany, and Russia, is<br/>
yearly pressing forward its domain in Africa or<br/>
Asia, preceded by the soldier or explorer; and the<br/>
fortunes of war have <span style="color: #0000FF;">carried </span>the Stars and Stripes<br/>
oversea, and brought numerous islands as well as<br/>
an Asiatic archipelago under administrative guidance from Washington.<br/>
<br/>
But the triumph of practical science, such as irrigation, bearing no relation to the sword or diplomacy, which turns a single acre of desert sand into<br/>
a productive field, must be a thousandfold more<br/>
valuable to the world than the victory of arms that<br/>
merely changes a frontier or deprives a defeated<br/>
nation of a single foot of soil: it is the victory of<br/>
peace; it is creation. As a method of making territory, it is one over which statesmen can never differ.<br/>
