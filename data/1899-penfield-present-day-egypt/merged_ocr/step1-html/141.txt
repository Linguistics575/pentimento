<span>Paradoxical Administration<br/>

have formed an aversion for journalists amounting<br/>
almost to detestation. On the occasion of his being<br/>
made prime minister by Khedive Abbas, I went<br/>
to his ministry to extend the congratulations and<br/>
good wishes usual to the event. As I was coming<br/>
away, a group of correspondents of Continental and<br/>
English papers called to present their <span style="color: #0000FF;">congratulations</span>, and incidentally to discover if he had any<br/>
news to be communicated to the European world.<br/>
Nubar shook the hand of each almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">effusively<br/>
</span>before saying: "Gentlemen, I am glad to see you,<br/>
and appreciate your kindness<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but while I am<br/>
premier there will be no <span style="color: #0000FF;">news-none </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">whatever</span>."<br/>

The Egypt of the map shows upward of four<br/>
hundred thousand square miles, an area seven<br/>
times as great as New England, twice that of<br/>
France, and more than three times that of the British Isles. But the practical Egypt-that which<br/>
sustains life by vegetation, and the government by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tasation-is </span>not nearly as large as the States of<br/>
Massachusetts and Connecticut together, or of Belgium alone. The ribbon-like strip of cultivable<br/>
land bordering the Nile and forming the Delta <span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>Cairo and the Mediterranean comprises ten<br/>
thousand five hundred square miles of fertile soil,<br/>
and makes, strictly speaking, an elongated oasis<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">-in </span>the North African desert.<br/>
<br/>
The Egypt thus sketched stretches from <span style="color: #ff0000;">WadyHalfa </span>(second cataract), <span style="color: #0000FF;">210 </span>53" north latitude,<br/>
to the Mediterranean Sea, 31Â° M" north latitude.<br/>
The breadth is limited by the Libyan and Arabian<br/>
chains of hills on either bank of the Nile, and<br/>
