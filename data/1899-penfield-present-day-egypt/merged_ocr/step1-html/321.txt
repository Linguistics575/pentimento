<span>Britain's Position in Egypt<br/>
<br/>
tralia, or any crown colony; yet between England<br/>
and Egypt there is no tie that is officially recognized<br/>
by any European power. While Britain is probably permanently established in Egypt, she has<br/>
yet to legalize her position. Meanwhile, the welfare<br/>
of the people of Egypt improves each year, England has become <span style="color: #0000FF;">indifferent </span>to the expressions of<br/>
dissatisfaction by her only outspoken critic, France,<br/>
and the cause of humanity and progress is steadily<br/>
benefited by the British occupation, anomalous<br/>
though it be. The Sultan is the only person possessing an absolute right to demand a halt or a<br/>
declaration of intentions on the part of the British<br/>
government; and the khedive can make his complaint of abridgment of authority only to his imperial master at Constantinople.<br/>
<br/>
To discuss now the moral right of Great Britain<br/>
to a foothold in Egypt is as superfluous as for a<br/>
lawyer to argue in court that the state cannot<br/>
arrest his client, when he is already a prisoner<br/>
behind the bars.<br/>
<br/>
Not one Englishman in a thousand has two<br/>
opinions on the subject of national expansion; if<br/>
he has views against territorial acquisition, he never<br/>
parades them in public prints to be read in other<br/>
countries. This is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">basic </span>principle of the Briton's<br/>
idea of patriotism. Frenchmen twit the British<br/>
with being <span style="color: #0000FF;">afflicted </span>with the square-mile mania,<br/>
and insist that the excuse for ministering to this is<br/>
never analyzed so <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>as an additional foot of<br/>
soil may be incorporated within that charmed zone<br/>
of red encircling the earth, 011 <span style="color: #ff0000;">which</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the sun<br/>
