<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
comes again the mumble of the leader. The dervishes spring to their feet. Off go robes and turbans, their stringy locks falling nearly to their<br/>
hips. One of the bowlers, placing his hand to the<br/>
side of his mouth, strikes up a falsetto note that<br/>
rises above the barbaric roar of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>tom-toms and<br/>
flute, plaintive, penetrating. Faster and faster<br/>
swing heads and bodies; the air is filled with swishing hair; heads come perilously near striking the<br/>
floor, or leaving their shoulders in the backward<br/>
swing. Every dervish is frantic, beside himself<br/>
with the ebullition of fervor, as he repeats in hisses<br/>
the sacred exclamation, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bed</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">het1</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hots</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hed</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hed</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hed</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hell</span>." <span style="color: #ff0000;">0n</span>, on they go, until <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>mental <span style="color: #0000FF;">intoxication </span>is complete, and with staring eyes and<br/>
frothing mouths two or three sink exhausted to the<br/>
floor. Admirers break into the circle and lovingly<br/>
carry into the air the dervishes who have "gone<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">melhils</span>." The performance of the howling dervishes is over, and the coins .given gladly by the<br/>
spectators to get away from the mosque amount to<br/>
enough to keep the howlers until the succeeding<br/>
Friday. It is something to see <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">once</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">motives </span>of the whirling dervishes, like those of their<br/>
howling brethren, are open to suspicion.<br/>
Another widely described institution, satisfying<br/>
most spectators with a single view, is the dancing<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ghawazi </span>girls, to be witnessed at a dozen<br/>
Cairo theaters and cafes. The Chicago Midway,<br/>
and certain places of amusement in Paris, by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">means </span>of elaborations, have given this exhibition<br/>
undeserved prominence. A performance wherein<br/>
