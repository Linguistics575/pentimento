<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
The diurnal procession of young women to the<br/>
Nile bank just before the going down of the sun,<br/>
to obtain the water required for the evening and<br/>
early morning in their homes, presents a beautiful<br/>
picture of womanly grace. These <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rebeceas </span>hold<br/>
themselves erect and walk with superlative grace<br/>
and majesty. If a promenading Fifth Avenue girl<br/>
could exhibit half the <span style="color: #0000FF;">naturalness </span>she would be<br/>
the envy of every spectator. Egyptian girls begin<br/>
early to perform their share of the work of the<br/>
home, and at seven or eight years commence to<br/>
carry <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-filled </span>water-jars, and at twelve think<br/>
nothing of balancing a full half-hundredweight on<br/>
their heads, walking leisurely homeward, chatting<br/>
with neighbors bent on the same mission, and discussing the gossip of the neighborhood with <span style="color: #ff0000;">1111concealed </span>relish. For thousands of years their<br/>
ancestors did the same; but they carried the <span style="color: #ff0000;">waterjars </span>represented in biblical pictures. The present<br/>
generation, discarding these, prefers the square<br/>
two-gallon tins in which Standard Oil has come to<br/>
Egypt. They are lighter than the pottery jars, and<br/>
if the modern <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rebecea </span>becomes excited in discussion, the petroleum tin never breaks in its fall.<br/>
<br/>
Every petroleum tin coming to Egypt finds a use<br/>
in the daily life of the people. The "<span style="color: #0000FF;">slates</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>of<br/>
school-boys are but sides of oil tins, on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they<br/>
write their sums and quotations from the Koran<br/>
with reed pens. The petroleum tins from America<br/>
supply tinsmiths of the bazaars with material from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they fashion lantern-frames, household utensils, ornaments, and even bird-cages and traveling<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">56<br/>
