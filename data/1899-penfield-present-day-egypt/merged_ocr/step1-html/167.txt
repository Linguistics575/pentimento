<br/>
BE most interesting page in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>history of Egypt is that which records the development of <span style="color: #ff0000;">seientifie </span>irrigation.<br/>
<br/>
Coincident with the preparation of this volume<br/>
for publication, one of the most stupendous engineering feats ever undertaken by man is being<br/>
executed on the Egyptian frontier, having for its<br/>
purpose the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pending </span>back into Nubia of a body<br/>
of water perhaps a hundred and fifty miles long,<br/>
crossing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tropic </span>of Cancer, and extending southward nearly to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Korosko</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-a </span>goodly step on the journey to Abu-Simbel and <span style="color: #ff0000;">WadyWalfa </span>,--by means<br/>
of a great dam across the Nile at Assuan. The<br/>
Pyramids and the Sphinx have borne testimony<br/>
through the centuries to the grandeur and power of<br/>
execution which dwelt within the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">valley</span>; and<br/>
what more fitting now than that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span>valley<br/>
should be the theater of a gigantic engineering exploit, <span style="color: #0000FF;">audacious </span>perhaps, but certain of success, and<br/>
ministering to man's necessities, rather than to his<br/>
vanity<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>As a wholesale rearrangement of nature's surface<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">project </span>outranks anything hitherto attempted<br/>
