boxes for the peasantry. Not a scrap is wasted.<br/>
To discover that dates purchased at up-Nile landings are packed in boxes on the bottoms of which<br/>
are impressed such legends as "Best American,"<br/>
"Standard," and "95 Degrees Pure," may be startling to fastidious tourists.<br/>
<br/>
The great school of the Mohammedan world is<br/>
one of Cairo's important sights; but few travelers<br/>
are aware of its interest, and not one in a hundred<br/>
visits it. The Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the Nile<br/>
are too absorbing for tourists to remember that in<br/>
the same wondrous city exists the largest and <span style="color: #0000FF;">oldest </span>university in the world-El-Azhar, meaning<br/>
"the splendid." Constantinople may be regarded<br/>
as the official head of the great religion of Islam,<br/>
but Cairo for nine hundred years has been the educational center, and if one wishes to attain the<br/>
summit of Mussulman learning he must attend the<br/>
classes of this collegiate establishment. Unless one<br/>
be familiar with Arabic and knows where to look<br/>
among musty books and manuscripts in the Egyptian Library, it is very <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieult </span>to get reliable information regarding this wonderful mosque-college.<br/>
<br/>
The claim of possessing the oldest university has<br/>
often been made for Oxford, Paris, or Bologna, but<br/>
the founding of their ancient seats of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jearning </span>is<br/>
legendary as to dates, while the records of El-Azhar<br/>
are clear from the year 975. Whether it is really<br/>
a "university" in our meaning can be more appropriately questioned. It is widely different from<br/>
Harvard and Yale, but wise men of the East have<br/>
ever termed it a university.<br/>
