<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
This kiosk was a favorite plaything of Mehemet<br/>
Ali, and its walls have screened from the knowledge of the world many orgies of the Eastern sort,<br/>
in which fair women played important parts. A<br/>
special pastime of the great despot, affording him<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">keenest </span>enjoyment, was to collect together the<br/>
ladies of the harem, perhaps a hundred at once,<br/>
divide them into boating parties, and have them<br/>
paddled into the middle of the lakelet within the<br/>
kiosk. Then, at his signal, the eunuchs would<br/>
overturn the boats, precipitating the lovely freight,<br/>
screaming and scrambling, into the water, while<br/>
their lord and master was convulsed with delight<br/>
and laughter. It amused the Viceroy more than<br/>
any pas of his odalisks.<br/>
<br/>
The name "Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">eigarette</span>," applied to the<br/>
article established as an adjunct to fashionable and<br/>
club life, is, strictly speaking, a misnomer, for no<br/>
tobacco is grown in the country; in fact, cultivation of the plant has been since 1890 forbidden<br/>
by khedival decree. "Cigarettes made in Egypt"<br/>
would be the truthful description. Practically all<br/>
the tobacco comes from Turkey, where it is shipped<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>from Kavala, Latakia, and Yenidje. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">paper </span>comes from Austria and Italy, and the major<br/>
part of the labor employed is Greek, except for<br/>
common cigarettes, which are made by native workmen. The manufacture is very largely in the<br/>
hands of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creeks</span>, and so deeply founded is the belief<br/>
that Europe and <span style="color: #0000FF;">America </span>will buy only Egyptian<br/>
cigarettes made by a Greek firm that several Cairo<br/>
manufactories are carried on under trade-names<br/>
