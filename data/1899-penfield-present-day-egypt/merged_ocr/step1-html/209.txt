<span>Story of the Suez Canal<br/>
<br/>
fourteen centuries before the Christian era, cut a<br/>
canal fifty-seven miles long, from Bubastis, near<br/>
the present town of Zagazig, on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pelusiae </span>branch<br/>
of the Nile, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Her00polis</span>, at the head of the Bitter<br/>
Lakes, then forming the northern extremity of the<br/>
Gulf of Suez. Eight hundred <span style="color: #0000FF;">years </span>later, says<br/>
Herodotus, the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necho </span>gave his attention to<br/>
canal-building, persevering in the task until one<br/>
hundred and twenty thousand lives had been <span style="color: #ff0000;">sacrifieed</span>, but abandoning the undertaking because the<br/>
oracle he consulted told him that dire results would<br/>
follow the completion of his labors, and Egypt be<br/>
surrendered to barbarians-or, in other words, the<br/>
making of a canal would so entangle the Egyptians<br/>
with foreign interests that their safety would be<br/>
imperiled. A century later came the Persian<br/>
Darius, son of Hystaspes, who took up the work<br/>
abandoned by Necho; but being assured by certain wise men that the land would be deluged, he<br/>
gave up the task when near its completion.<br/>
Traces of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neeho</span>'s canal, so <span style="color: #0000FF;">archaeologists </span>claim, are<br/>
still distinguishable near the southern end of the<br/>
Bitter Lakes. The project of Necho, as well as<br/>
that of Darius, involved the transhipment of cargo<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heroopolis</span>, and each was unsatisfactory for<br/>
other reasons. To remedy these defects, Ptolemy<br/>
Philadelphus, in B. c. 285, joined the Nile canal with<br/>
the Heroopolite Gulf by means of locks, opening<br/>
when a vessel wished to pass. The southern terminus of this waterway <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoii</span>, near the<br/>
Suez of to-day. The failure of Cleopatra's ships to<br/>
escape through this canal into the Red Sea, <span style="color: #ff0000;">two<br/>
