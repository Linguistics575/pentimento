<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">nially </span>minister of this or that, strode into the palace. With some reluctance he consented to take<br/>
the fateful telegram up-stairs to the khedive.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismail</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>face changed a little as he read it. "Send<br/>
at once for his Highness Tewfik Pasha," was all he<br/>
said. Then <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>folded the message and laid it on<br/>
the table by his side. A moment later he handed<br/>
the bit of paper to Cherif to read, saying as he did<br/>
so: "I can't go to the investiture; I do not think<br/>
that can be expected of me. But I shall be the<br/>
first to salute the new khedive of Egypt, and wish<br/>
for him a more successful reign than his father has<br/>
had." Then, drawing the table nearer, he said to<br/>
Cherif Pasha: "Now <span style="color: #ff0000;">me </span>will have a game of <span style="color: #0000FF;">backgammon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>"<br/>
<br/>
Tewfik's message was hurried full tilt from the<br/>
telegraph office, the messenger making a record for<br/>
speed, wondering as he <span style="color: #ff0000;">ran </span>if he would be made a<br/>
pasha <span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>a bey.<br/>
<br/>
True to the habit of punctilious politeness <span style="color: #ff0000;">aequired </span>in France, Ismail determined to maintain<br/>
his savoir-faire in the hour of adversity. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Be<br/>
</span>quickly cabled to Constantinople that he submitted<br/>
to the will of his sovereign Sultan; and, Tewfik<br/>
Pasha arriving at the palace shortly after, Ismail<br/>
is said to have greeted him with the words, "I<br/>
salute my <span style="color: #ff0000;">effendina</span>," bowing low to his successor<br/>
and covering his hands with the kisses of submission.<br/>
<br/>
Tewfik's account of what passed immediately following the greeting in their altered stations is told<br/>
by Alfred J. Butler, an English tutor in the Tewfik<br/>
