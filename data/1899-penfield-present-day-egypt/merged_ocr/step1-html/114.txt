<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">vable </span>soil, sacrificing many lives, and ruining forty<br/>
villages-and the climate of Alexandria. It was a<br/>
wicked act, hardly justified by the needs of warfare. It is a curious example of the irony of fate<br/>
that monster English pumps and a staff of English<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ongineers-paid </span>for by the Egyptian government<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-are </span>given constant employment to-day in keeping the salt water of Lake Mareotis within bounds,<br/>
for no engineering resource can now prevent the<br/>
percolation of the sea to the lower level of Mareotis.<br/>
Engineering skill can only keep the water from<br/>
overflowing still more valuable territory. A million and a half tons of water are pumped back into<br/>
the Mediterranean every twenty-four hours.<br/>
Ramleh is the only residential suburb of Alexandria. It is easier to make the assertion than to<br/>
describe the limits of the place. It has many titular<br/>
subdivisions, but generically Ramleh may be said<br/>
to stretch along the entire sea-front from Alexandria to Abukir Bay, a dozen miles away.<br/>
"Ramleh" is the native word for sand, and in<br/>
this instance is applied with signal appropriateness. In summer all that portion of Cairo's <span style="color: #0000FF;">officialdom </span>unable to manage European <span style="color: #0000FF;">leave </span>of absence<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">betakes </span>itself en masse to the hotels and villas of the<br/>
Alexandrian suburb, there to keep cool and incidentally assail the humid atmosphere by invidious<br/>
comparison. Hundreds of Alexandria's business<br/>
men reside throughout the year at Ramleh. J <span style="color: #ff0000;">udges<br/>
</span>of the international courts, consuls, <span style="color: #0000FF;">functionaries<br/>
</span>of every degree, bourse operators, and J <span style="color: #ff0000;">ewish </span>and<br/>
Greek money magnates, <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>there peaceful repose.<br/>
