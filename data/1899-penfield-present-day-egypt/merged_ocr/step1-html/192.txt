<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
banks of the melancholy river rolling toward the<br/>
sea in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cloudless </span>glare of a tropical sun, to-day<br/>
as thousands of years ago, snatch every sand-bank<br/>
from the receding stream, and plant melons, beans,<br/>
and other articles of their simple diet. N <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>an inch<br/>
of available soil is lost; and day by day, as the<br/>
stream decreases in spring and summer, fresh rows<br/>
. of vegetables are sown upon the newly acquired<br/>
land.<br/>
<br/>
In Middle and Lower Egypt, the soil, created by<br/>
the deposits of the great river and ever fertilized<br/>
by it, is perhaps the richest in the world, and is<br/>
tilled with such ease and certain results as cannot<br/>
fail to excite the envy of the traveling American.<br/>
The Egyptian peasant is by instinct at once farmer<br/>
and irrigation expert. With the rudest of wooden<br/>
plows, a mattock, and a well-sweep water-hoisting<br/>
shadoof, his labors are blessed with a success impossible to tillers of the soil elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
From ages before the beginnings of history down<br/>
to the reign of Mehemet Ali, all Egypt followed but<br/>
one rule of cultivation. The land was saturated in<br/>
the flood season with the fertilizing waters of the<br/>
great river, and when the flood abated the seed<br/>
was sown in the ooze, and the result was a single<br/>
harvest of great abundance. Mehemet Ali <span style="color: #0000FF;">revolutionized </span>this system in the Delta. He introduced<br/>
the cultivation of cotton and sugar, and the system<br/>
of perennial irrigation <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>these highly profitable<br/>
crops require.<br/>
<br/>
Nature made the Delta; all that man did was<br/>
to construct the canals that distribute the water.<br/>
