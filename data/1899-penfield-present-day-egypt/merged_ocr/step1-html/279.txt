<span>Tewfik and the Arabi Rebellion<br/>
<br/>
in Egypt in the early eighties. Arabi Pasha was<br/>
the exponent of the wrong process. The logic of<br/>
argument, reaching the proper ear, should be more<br/>
potent in these days than <span style="color: #0000FF;">ill-considered </span>revolt.<br/>
Rebellion is usually destructive in its results, and<br/>
does not always appeal to the seat of true wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
Ahmed Arabi was constructed on lines too narrow to make it possible for him ever to become a<br/>
liberator. He lacked every mental attribute <span style="color: #0000FF;">requisite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">successful </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">leadership</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">pe1hapsesplainedbythe<br/>
</span>fact that he was but a peasant, whose forefathers<br/>
had never <span style="color: #0000FF;">known </span>an hour when they were free from<br/>
the heel of the oppressor. Arabi talked <span style="color: #0000FF;">superficial<br/>
</span>platitudes that pleased his kind, and their <span style="color: #0000FF;">flattery<br/>
</span>convinced him that he was born for a great part in<br/>
the world. He had risen from a common soldier<br/>
to be a colonel, and had a fondness for intrigue.<br/>
His flowery talk and employment of claptrap<br/>
dramaticism had lifted him within a year from<br/>
obscurity to notoriety, and wherever he went he<br/>
excited the admiration of the common people.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>propaganda of "Egypt for the Egyptians"<br/>
was hourly exploited. People followed him in the<br/>
streets singing his praises, and he was undeniably<br/>
the man of the hour. It is related that, as he<br/>
once walked along an important thoroughfare, in<br/>
a manner indicating profound <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflection</span>, knowing<br/>
he was followed by a hundred worshipers, he<br/>
struck a dramatic attitude, and said, as if speaking<br/>
to himself, "mre,<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-plaeing </span>his foot over a certain<br/>
spot, -" buried here is the heaven-sent weapon that<br/>
will free Egypt from the grasp of the infidels." A<br/>
