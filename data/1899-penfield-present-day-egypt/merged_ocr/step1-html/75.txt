however reluctant. The obverse of this display is<br/>
the recompense of the soldier-five cents a day for<br/>
five years. Egyptian soldiers are well disciplined<br/>
and make a fine appearance on parade. Their<br/>
comrades recruited from the region south of Assuan, forming the so-called Sudanese regiments,<br/>

the Mahdi, when the hope of Gordon's release from<br/>
beleaguered Khartum was enlisting the sympathies<br/>
of the world. Disastrous as the expedition was,<br/>
Kitchener emerged from the campaign with an<br/>
established reputation as a soldier of infinite resource, vigor, and brilliant strategy, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, combined with his knowledge of the customs and dialects of the Sudan, stamped him as England's best<br/>
