<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
if satisfied with the money given them by the relatives of the deceased, trot off homeward. Other<br/>
forms of bereavement give them employment also.<br/>
A score of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">bags </span>follow to the railway-station<br/>
the squad of policemen taking a convict to prison.<br/>
The women howl and curse, throw handfuls of dust<br/>
over their heads, scream voluble and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wide-embracing </span>Arabic oaths at the authorities, and make the<br/>
street almost unbearable with shrieks and lamentations. The train started for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tourah</span>, the shrieking<br/>
subsides, and they are ready for further <span style="color: #0000FF;">professional </span>engagements. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">conscripting </span>of young<br/>
men for the army being profoundly dreaded, hired<br/>
wailers accompany their <span style="color: #0000FF;">weeping </span>relatives when<br/>
the unhappy lads are marched to the barracks.<br/>
The Cairene, never cultivating physical exertion,<br/>
emerges from boyhood to sedate manhood before he<br/>
is twenty, with tranquillity his chief characteristic.<br/>
The middle-class man enjoys <span style="color: #0000FF;">looking </span>at dances, but<br/>
never dances himself; he is fond of music, but never<br/>
sings or plays. Everything athletic is foreign to his<br/>
nature. He takes to sedentary amusements, and<br/>
in shop or home will ponder <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>over a game of<br/>
draughts or chess. If belonging to the class that<br/>
goes to the café for diversion, he will watch for<br/>
hours the antics of street hoodlums, <span style="color: #ff0000;">01f </span>join in a<br/>
game of interminable <span style="color: #0000FF;">backgammon-which </span>all<br/>
Egyptians love-to decide who is to pay a few<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">milliemes </span>for the coffee or the smoke from the hubble-bubble. When he can sit for hours in front of<br/>
the café, smoking the hubble-bubble, he realizes<br/>
that he <span style="color: #0000FF;">IS </span>doing the superlative of all that is grand,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">21<br/>
