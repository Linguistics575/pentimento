<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
tom is unalterable; and, presumably, cows are not<br/>
looked upon as possessing sufficient intellect to<br/>
know a live from a dead calf, or to recognize<br/>
their own.<br/>
<br/>
Cairo presents the best <span style="color: #0000FF;">exemplifieation </span>of the<br/>
confusion of tongues descending from the building<br/>
of the tower of Babel that I know. Every language and patois of Europe, every shade of vernacular of Asia and Africa, may there be heard.<br/>
It is humiliating to us of the Western world, who<br/>
may have struggled the best part of a lifetime with<br/>
a single foreign language, to find the Cairene able<br/>
to speak fluently a dozen. The dragoman or the<br/>
donkey-boy can exploit his vocation in a wonderful variety of tongues, although possibly unable to<br/>
read his name in any. Ask your way in the street,<br/>
and you must not be surprised if the information<br/>
be given in a sentence made up of words from<br/>
English, French, and Italian, perhaps with a<br/>
Creek word thrown in. Polyglot as Cairo is, the<br/>
medley of coinages is none the less confusing. Send<br/>
your dragoman to the bazaars in quest of some<br/>
article, and he may return with the astonishing information that it costs <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>one napoleon, half a sovereign, and eighteen piasters <span style="color: #0000FF;">tariff</span>." It calls for<br/>
pencil, paper, and patience to compute the price of<br/>
the article you are endeavoring to buy through<br/>
your <span style="color: #ff0000;">polynumismatic </span>servant. And the piaster,<br/>
the basis of computation, has <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>confusing value.<br/>
The piaster <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>current" of small transactions is but<br/>
half as much as the piaster "tariff" of high life; and<br/>
this latter is only <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>cents in American money.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">13<br/>
<br/>
