<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
as the pilgrimage of good Mohammedans to Mecca.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moharmi1edaa1s</span>' religion takes them but once to<br/>
the sacred city of the prophet, but pleasure draws<br/>
those favored by fortune to the Nile capital time<br/>
after time. Cairo is more than interesting: it is<br/>
fascinating. The antiquarian, the student, and the<br/>
savant have always been at home there; and the<br/>
invalid-real or <span style="color: #ff0000;">imiginary-seeking </span>a climate, finds<br/>
in and about the khedival city the superlative of<br/>
air and temperature.<br/>
<br/>
Artists never weary of reproducing Cairo's <span style="color: #ff0000;">pieturesque </span>scenes and vivid colorings. The other<br/>
of the skies, the splendor of the setting sun, the<br/>
Turneresque afterglow, and the delicate browns of<br/>
the desert, can be best suggested in water-colors,<br/>
for, like Venice, Egypt demands a master hand in<br/>
oils.<br/>
<br/>
The traveler of impressionable nature yields to<br/>
the fascination of Cairo's quaint Eastern life, as<br/>
perfect as if met far beyond the Orient's threshold,<br/>
and doubly satisfying, because found within a half-.<br/>
hour of the creature comforts of hotels <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuously </span>modern. To walk the streets of an Oriental<br/>
capital wherein history has been made, between<br/>
meals, as it were, and delve by day in museums<br/>
and mosques perpetuating a mysterious past, and<br/>
dine de rigueur in the evening, with the best music<br/>
of Europe at hand, explains a charm that Cairo has<br/>
for mortals liking to witness Eastern life provided<br/>
they are not compelled to <span style="color: #0000FF;">become </span>a part of it. If<br/>
Egypt disappoints, the indecisive idler can in four<br/>
or five days be back in Paris or on the Riviera.<br/>
