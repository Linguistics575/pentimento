<span>CHAPTER X<br/>
GREAT BRITAIN'S POSITION IN EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
HE Egyptian question is perennial, but<br/>
American readers know only that version<br/>
of it which British writers prepare, and this, naturally, is apt to <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflect </span>their partizan bias. Most<br/>
published opinion is so treated that the casual<br/>
reader is led to believe that by some feat of diplomacy, long forgotten by him, the ancient land of the<br/>
Pharaohs has been segregated from the Ottoman<br/>
empire and incorporated as an integral part of<br/>
Queen Victoria: realm. This is in <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>what has<br/>
been done, but accomplished more through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooperation </span>of circumstances than by any preconceived intention to secure control of the country.<br/>
Briefly stated, Great Britain's visible right to<br/>
wield a dominating <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>in Egypt is that she<br/>
is in "<span style="color: #ff0000;">oeeupationn </span>with an armed force, and this<br/>
only. In theory, at least, "<span style="color: #ff0000;">oeeupation</span>" means<br/>
much less than "<span style="color: #ff0000;">proteetorate</span>," and diplomacy has<br/>
heretofore regarded it as a word fitting a temporary expedient. But England does not bother<br/>
about definitions. In point of fact, the Nile country has for seventeen years been more absolutely<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">governed </span>from London than has India, Canada, Aus<br/>
