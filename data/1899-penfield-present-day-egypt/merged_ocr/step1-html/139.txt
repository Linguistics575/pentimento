for the simple reason that his domicile is a legal<br/>
atom of Italy set down on Egyptian territory. Bis<br/>
consul alone possesses the right to cause his arrest<br/>
and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">inflict </span>imprisonment <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>fine. The son of<br/>
Malta, should he take the life of an Egyptian, as he<br/>
sometimes does, can be tried and punished only<br/>

Greek skipper can sail fearlessly into Alexandria<br/>
with a cargo of hashish, and the local police can<br/>
say nothing to him. If he is unwise enough to attempt to land the contraband article while the<br/>
eyes of the Egyptian government are upon him,<br/>
the police can seize and destroy the hashish, but<br/>
the smuggler can be reached only through the<br/>
Greek diplomatic agent and <span style="color: #0000FF;">consul-general</span>. This<br/>

or amended when Ismail induced the Sublime<br/>
Porte to confer upon his family the privileges of<br/>
entailed rulership. As a consequence, there is at<br/>
times much vexatious friction and <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonf1iet </span>of<br/>
authority between the Egyptian administration<br/>
and the governments enjoying these <span style="color: #0000FF;">capitulations</span>.<br/>
Cairo can have no system of modern drainage because some of the European governments refuse to<br/>
give their consent to sanitary <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>to enter the<br/>
houses of their subjects.<br/>
