<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
eign governments, including the United States,<br/>
have almost sovereign rights in Egypt, independent<br/>
of local authority, will surely do so. The concessions of the Sublime Porte give to these nations<br/>
as full control of their subjects or citizens as <span style="color: #ff0000;">if<br/>
</span>in their own lands. The Egyptian government<br/>
itself has no stronger control over its subjects.<br/>
Thus an American, an Englishman, or a Frenchman, who can be proceeded against in property<br/>
matters only in the international courts, can be<br/>
apprehended and tried for a criminal offense solely<br/>
by the consular authority of his government resident in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
It would tax the capacity of the proverbial Philadelphia lawyer to understand the capitulations <span style="color: #ff0000;">s11fficiently </span>to be able to impart their exact <span style="color: #0000FF;">significance</span>.<br/>
I have known many <span style="color: #ff0000;">wiseaeres </span>who could explain<br/>
the legal status of the Debt Commission, give a<br/>
comprehensible epitome of the jurisdiction of the<br/>
mixed courts, or define the diplomatic <span style="color: #ff0000;">nioeties </span>of<br/>
difference between "<span style="color: #ff0000;">oeeupationv </span>and "protectorate"; but not one in a thousand can describe the<br/>
Ottoman capitulations, beyond telling you that<br/>
they date from this <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>that century, and more <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>less vaguely deal with the rights and privileges of<br/>
Christians living within the Turkish realm.<br/>
<br/>
I am not claiming a knowledge superior to that<br/>
of other seekers for light who take the time to explore <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieial </span>works on treaties and wade through<br/>
dozens of massive volumes on Oriental law. It is<br/>
not <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to learn that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">capitulation </span>given<br/>
by the Turkish empire to the United States of<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">106<br/>
