The Suez <span style="color: #ff0000;">isompany</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">capital-bonds </span>and shares<br/>
of every <span style="color: #ff0000;">eharacter-is </span>practically one hundred million dollars; and the length of the canal is just<br/>
under a hundred miles. In average years the gross<br/>
revenue is about 16 per cent. on the capitalization,<br/>
and the net earnings about 7.6 per cent. These<br/>
figures indicate a remarkable prosperity, and explain the popularity in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the securities are<br/>
held by Frenchmen and other investors. I recall<br/>
an interesting conversation with a clever American<br/>
engineer, two or three years ago, who assured me<br/>
that by employing the hydraulic excavating machinery of the present day he could make a canal<br/>
from the Mediterranean to Suez, as wide and deep<br/>
as the existing canal, for twenty million dollars;<br/>
and he regretted that international agreements and<br/>
vested rights rendered it impossible to "parallel"<br/>
the Suez waterway. The machinery with <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>his<br/>
name was associated had done Wonders in making<br/>
the Chicago drainage-canal, and his estimate of<br/>
the cost of dealing with the sands of the Egyptian<br/>
isthmus seemed reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
It is too early for speculation as to the reversionary value of the Suez Canal. Many persons,<br/>
knowing how Egypt is <span style="color: #ff0000;">mulcted </span>in most matters,<br/>
claim that it will never be turned over to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyp-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>tian government, predicting that in time it will be<br/>
thrown <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>to the world, and supported by a<br/>
nominal tax on vessels using it, after the manner<br/>
