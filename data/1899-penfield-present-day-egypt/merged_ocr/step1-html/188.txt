It was determined by the explorations of Speke,<br/>
Grant, and Baker that the rainfall of the equatorial<br/>
region of Africa supplies the Victoria and Albert<br/>
lakes, and that the overflow of these gives sufficient<br/>
volume to support the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">throughout </span>its northward course of thirty degrees of latitude, crossing<br/>
arid sands and burning deserts, until it reaches the<br/>
Mediterranean.<br/>
<br/>
It might at first sight appear that the discovery<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Niles </span>sources had completely solved the<br/>
mystery of ages, and proved the fertility of Egypt<br/>
to be dependent upon the rainfall of the equator<br/>
concentrated in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Victoria </span>Nyanza and Albert<br/>
Nyanza; but the exploration of the Nile tributaries<br/>
of Abyssinia divides the Nile system into two<br/>
parts, and unravels the entire mystery of the river<br/>
by assigning to each its share in ministering to the<br/>
prosperity of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The lake sources maintain the life of Egypt by<br/>
supplying a stream throughout all seasons that has<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>volume to support the exhaustion of<br/>
evaporation and absorption; but'this stream unaided could never overflow its banks, and Egypt,<br/>
deprived of the annual inundation, would be forced<br/>
to exist with the cultivation of the circumscribed<br/>
area immediately bordering the great river.<br/>
<br/>
The two great <span style="color: #ff0000;">aff1uents </span>of Abyssinia are the Blue<br/>
Nile and the Atbara (called by the natives <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahral-Aswad</span>, or the Black Nile), <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, although<br/>
