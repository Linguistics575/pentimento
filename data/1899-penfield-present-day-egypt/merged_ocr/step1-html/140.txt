the duties of their positions, sometimes forget the<br/>
existence of the capitulations. A few years ago a<br/>
French newspaper published in Cairo was so severe<br/>
in its criticisms of the local government that a<br/>
khedival minister felt that the journal could be<br/>
suppressed under a law found in the statute-book<br/>
regulating what newspapers could and could not<br/>
print. The press censor <span style="color: #0000FF;">explained </span>to him that his<br/>
duty was clear, and with a posse of policemen he<br/>
forcibly closed the office of the offending <span style="color: #0000FF;">publication</span>. This was the only bit of good luck the editor<br/>

promptly set to work to repair the damage.<br/>
Dressed in the full uniform of his high <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>, he<br/>
proceeded to the French diplomatic agency <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>formally apologized to the young diplomatist; the<br/>
flag of France was saluted by twenty-one guns from<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">citadel</span>, and the editor was given one hundred<br/>
thousand dollars of the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">taxpayers</span>' money<br/>
for the injury he had suffered through the too<br/>
summary method by which he had been apprehended for a flagrant offense against an administration at that time a good friend of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Trance</span>.<br/>

The minister was Nubar Pasha, who died in 1899,<br/>
and from the incident I have detailed he is said to<br/>
