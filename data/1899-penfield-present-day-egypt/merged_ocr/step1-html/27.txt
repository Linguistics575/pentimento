<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
Every turning in the old quarters of the Mohammedan city has its story. The remnant of a fortified<br/>
gateway, a dilapidated mosque, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cutie </span>text, each<br/>
has its history, perhaps carrying one back to the<br/>
days when Saladin went forth from El-Kahira to<br/>
meet Richard and his crusaders on the plain of<br/>
Acre; or the mind's eye sees the good <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barun-alRashid</span>, freshly arrived from Bagdad, stealthily<br/>
pursuing his midnight rambles. A hundred associations such as these are wrapped about the<br/>
crumbling ruins of medieval Cairo, to this day<br/>
rich with exquisite achievements of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saracenie </span>art.<br/>
Huge monuments of the earliest history of the world<br/>
fringe the horizon as one looks from the ramparts<br/>
of the citadel, teaching us <span style="color: #0000FF;">how</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>the years of Cairo<br/>
are but as days in the sight of the Sphinx ind the<br/>
Pyramids. To the left is desolate Memphis, earliest city of the world; face about, and you behold<br/>
the edge of tho land of Goshen; two or three miles<br/>
down the Nile, near the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Embabeh </span>end of the railway-bridge, Napoleon and his army, just a century<br/>
ago, won the battle of the Pyramids over the<br/>
Mameluke horde; and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>modern structure in<br/>
the near foreground, the Egyptian Museum, rest the<br/>
bodies of Seti and the great Rameses, while within<br/>
a few paces of the spot from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>you are viewing this <span style="color: #0000FF;">matchless </span>panorama sleeps the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Roumelian<br/>
</span>warrior who by daring and bloodshed founded the<br/>
dynasty now ruling Egypt. All this, and more,<br/>
may be seen in an hour, if the blare of bugles,<br/>
reverberated by the Mokattam Hills, does not inform you that the British soldier has decided it is<br/>
