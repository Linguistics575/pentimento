<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
-in such persons a winter spent in Egypt may lead<br/>
to the return of mental energy and bodily health<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">vigor</span>," remarks the same authority.<br/>
<br/>
It is the duty of any writer on the subject of<br/>
Egypt as a resort for health-seekers to caution<br/>
those reading from an interested standpoint, that<br/>
one may contract a cold there perhaps as easily<br/>
as elsewhere. The winds of the Nile valley, the<br/>
marked difference between sun and shade temperature, and the excessive chill coming with sunset,<br/>
are certain to seize the unwary person feeling that<br/>
his presence in North Africa gives exemption<br/>
from such mishaps. A Nile cold has potentialities<br/>
of seriousness, and cannot be annulled by power of<br/>
will. On the contrary, an Egyptian cold is stubbornly <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieult </span>to be got rid of.<br/>
<br/>
No climate is without its disadvantages as well<br/>
as advantages, and it is important that a seeker for<br/>
mental rest and physical benefit should be as cognizant of the former as of the latter. Change of<br/>
climate, intelligently planned, frequently helps an<br/>
ailment when other forms of treatment have failed;<br/>
and in cases where it may have caused amelioration<br/>
merely, it may by repeated trials eventually effect<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lasting </span>cure. Immediate recovery is no more certain to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">effected </span>by a change of air and scene<br/>
than by other remedial agents. Maladies of a constitutional character, such as Egypt is believed to<br/>
cure, may not even be relieved in a single season,<br/>
while a second visit may eradicate them for all time.<br/>
Expert medical opinion is worth securing before<br/>
setting out for the N ile country, and should be <span style="color: #ff0000;">freo<br/>
