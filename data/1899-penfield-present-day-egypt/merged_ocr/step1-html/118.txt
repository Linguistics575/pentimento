<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
at hand, viewing the scene of the battle of the Nile,<br/>
and picturing in the mind's eye Lord <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nelson</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">brilliant </span>maneuvers, by <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>thirteen doughty French<br/>
ships of the line were destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
There is a distinct admixture of Greek blood in<br/>
the people of Alexandria, observable in many <span style="color: #0000FF;">countenances</span>, and the Greek colony is the largest of<br/>
foreign origin dwelling in the great seaport. A<br/>
considerable share of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>and commercial<br/>
business is conducted by Greeks, and innumerable<br/>
names seen over shop doors recall the nomenclature of the classics familiar to every student. Some<br/>
of the palatial homes of the city and its suburbs are<br/>
those of Greek bankers and merchants, and there<br/>
is an intimate intercourse between Alexandria and<br/>
Athens. Love of the home country is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">characteristie </span>of these transplanted people, whose patriotism<br/>
finds frequent <span style="color: #0000FF;">expression </span>in gifts to Athenian <span style="color: #0000FF;">institutions </span>and causes. It is a boast of many Greeks<br/>
in Alexandria that their ancestors have dwelt in<br/>
Egypt since the days of Cleopatra; that their <span style="color: #0000FF;">countrymen </span>were there before the advent of the Arabs,<br/>
and have been there uninterruptedly <span style="color: #ff0000;">longer</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>than<br/>
the people of any other nation.<br/>
<br/>
One can scarcely walk the historic streets of<br/>
Alexandria without his thoughts dwelling at times<br/>
upon the splendid woman who once ruled Egypt<br/>
from that place, whose beauty enslaved all that beheld it, and caused the bravest generals to forsake<br/>
the conquering missions that brought them from<br/>
Rome, and let themselves be conquered by the<br/>
irresistible charm of Cleopatra. Mere presence in<br/>
