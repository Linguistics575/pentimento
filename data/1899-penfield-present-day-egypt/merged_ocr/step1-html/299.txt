as well as the calling of the engineer and the skilled<br/>
artisan. In the midst of these pursuits, at a time<br/>
when he believed he had many years for study and<br/>
travel, the news was cabled from Cairo, on January 7, 1892, that Tewfik Pasha had died suddenly,<br/>
and that Prince Abbas had been proclaimed khedive.<br/>
<br/>
Thus ended abruptly the happy student days,<br/>
and the prince had to exchange the outspoken <span style="color: #0000FF;">language </span>of youth for the carefully considered phrases<br/>
