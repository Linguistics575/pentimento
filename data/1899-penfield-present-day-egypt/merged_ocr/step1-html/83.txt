<br/>
One, for example, is for those who come from<br/>
Algeria, another for those from Morocco, one for<br/>
Indians, one for <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ubians</span>, one for Turks, and so on.<br/>
There is a compartment even <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>students from the<br/>
holy city of Mecca, where the prophet Mohammed<br/>
is buried, and there are divisions for scholars representing different sections of Egypt..<br/>
<br/>
There is a department for blind pupils, as well,<br/>
for whom special instructors and funds are provided. It is a strange fact that these unfortunates<br/>
are peculiarly turbulent and fanatical. If they believe their rights invaded, or their food not good,<br/>
they give way to fury and attack any one within<br/>
reach. If aware that an "unbelieving Christian"<br/>
is looking at them, their resentment becomes<br/>
offensively apparent.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Followers </span>of the prophet hold different views in<br/>
regard to their theology, as do different denominations of Christians. There are four great orthodox sects of Mohammedans ,--<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shafeites</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Malekites</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Banefites</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1Tambalites </span>,--and all are represented<br/>
in El-Azhar. <span style="color: #0000FF;">An </span>American would think it a queer<br/>
place of learning, for nowhere is there a desk or a<br/>
chair, and masters and pupils appear to go about<br/>
everything backward. Before they cross the<br/>
threshold in entering the place they remove their<br/>
shoes, but always keep their heads covered; and<br/>
all books read from right to left, the first leaf<br/>
being, according to our way of thinking, the last.<br/>
<br/>
There are more than ten thousand scholars and<br/>
two hundred and <span style="color: #ff0000;">twenty-fivo </span>masters, and the period of instruction may be indefinitely extended,<br/>
