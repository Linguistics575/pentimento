<br/>
as beautiful as the Hassan dome is wonderful. This<br/>
mosque, with its alabaster walls and rich carpets,<br/>
is attractive in its way, but comparatively new, and<br/>
consequently clean. Connoisseurs shake their<br/>
heads, however, when debating any pretension to<br/>
its being "good art." The mosque of Amr, in Old<br/>
Cairo, is the oldest in Egypt, its foundation having<br/>
been laid'in the year 643 of our calendar; and<br/>
Ahmed Ibn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulf1n </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>oldest in Cairo proper,<br/>
having been built-in an outskirt of <span style="color: #ff0000;">li'ostat-in </span>879.<br/>
This latter is said to be a copy of the Kaaba at<br/>
Mecca. Only in Coptic churches does the visitor<br/>
discover pictorial representations of sacred scenes<br/>
and personages. The Mohammedan on occasion<br/>
takes the spoils of war to his house of worship, but<br/>
never the presentment of human form.<br/>

Strange to state, Cairo has no obelisk, nor has<br/>
Alexandria. New York possesses the last of these<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">relics</span>, probably; London and Paris have each a<br/>
fine one, while Rome and Constantinople have<br/>
many. One cannot behold these reminders of the<br/>
greatness of ancient Egypt, in the cities mentioned,<br/>
without a feeling of pity for Cairo, where rest the<br/>
Rameses, but whose nearest obelisk is on the plain<br/>
of Heliopolis, six miles away. Most tourists drive<br/>
out to see it, planning their excursion to include <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>visit to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ostrich-farm </span>close by, and also to catch<br/>
a glimpse of the Virgin's tree en route.<br/>
<br/>
Early in my residence in the Nile metropolis I<br/>
evolved a project for removing to Cairo the superb<br/>
obelisk standing near the river's bank at Luxor, and<br/>
if possible having the expense defrayed by a few<br/>
