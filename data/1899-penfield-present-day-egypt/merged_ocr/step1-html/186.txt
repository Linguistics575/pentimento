<br/>
during several months of the year. As soon as<br/>
the flood subsides, but while the discharge is still<br/>
greater than can be at once used for irrigation, the<br/>
water will be retained for use during the parching<br/>
summer months. For this purpose the structure<br/>
will be divided into a large number of piers, with<br/>
openings that can be closed at will by gates.<br/>
<br/>
Each pier must be capable of supporting its own<br/>
weight and the pressure of water against the adjoining sluice-gates, and the piers <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>be able to<br/>
pass the torrent without damage. At times the<br/>
velocity of the escaping <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood-water </span>will be very<br/>
great; consequently the piers are to be enormously<br/>
massive. The locks for steamers and other craft<br/>
navigating the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>be on the west side.<br/>
<br/>
It being the particles of soil contributed to the<br/>
river by the wash of the mountains and hills in<br/>
Abyssinia that enrich the fields, the dam will be so<br/>
designed that the water released daily, during low<br/>
Nile, will be drawn from near the bottom of the<br/>
reservoir. Egyptian farmers prize the "red water,"<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is vastly richer in fertilizing value than clear<br/>
water can be. In the autumn, after the silt-laden<br/>
water has passed off, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sluice-gates </span>will be closed<br/>
gradually until the reservoir is full, which, with<br/>
normal conditions, will be in J <span style="color: #ff0000;">anuary </span>and February. From April to the end of August, <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>the<br/>
Nile runs low, and the demand for water for the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">crops </span>is at its highest, the gates will be systematically opened, and the summer supply of the river<br/>
supplemented by the water, which, had it not been<br/>
stored, would have flowed uselessly into the Medi<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">164<br/>
