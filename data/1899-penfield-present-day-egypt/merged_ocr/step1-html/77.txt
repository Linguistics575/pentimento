he is not a perfect soldier; but Spartan virtues<br/>
must not be looked for from a nation of Helots.<br/>

General Lord Kitchener, sirdar of the Egyptian<br/>
army and governor-general of the Sudan, is yet<br/>
several years on the right side of fifty, is every inch<br/>
a soldier, and only a soldier, and has the proverbial dash and courage of the Irishman. He went<br/>
to Egypt resolved to win his spurs in a field where<br/>
.others had failed, and never for an instant allowed<br/>
his courage to falter or his energies to be diverted<br/>
to other channels. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>has, indeed, added his name<br/>
to the list of great <span style="color: #0000FF;">military </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">leaders </span>of the nineteenth<br/>
century.<br/>
<br/>
The British army of occupation, which is independent of the Egyptian army, is in Egypt on<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>terms liberal to the Egyptians, for the<br/>
khedival government pays only the difference between the cost of home and foreign service, being<br/>
less than half a million dollars yearly for the fortyfive hundred men composing this contingent. Usually about three thousand Britishers are kept in<br/>
Cairo; but, on occasions when there has been friction between the khedive and the British <span style="color: #0000FF;">administrators</span>, these have been countermarched so <span style="color: #0000FF;">ingeniously </span>as to give the impression that ten times as<br/>
many <span style="color: #0000FF;">redcoats </span>were there. The English <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers<br/>
</span>lend much to a winter's gaiety. Courageous fellows,<br/>
trained to conquer, no season is complete that does<br/>
not add to their conquests those of the ball-room.<br/>
"Scarlet fever" is in the atmosphere of Cairo<br/>
breathed by the girl visitor, but is seldom serious<br/>
or lasting.<br/>
