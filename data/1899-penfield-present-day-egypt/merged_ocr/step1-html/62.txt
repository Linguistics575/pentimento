<span>CHAPTER II<br/>
IN <span style="color: #0000FF;">FASCINATING </span>CAIRO (Continued)<br/>
<br/>
PROOF of the claim that Cairo is being <span style="color: #ff0000;">Europeanized </span>at an <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncalled-for </span>pace is suggested<br/>
by innumerable shop-signs of cigarette-makers,<br/>
announcing that they are "Purveyors to <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>Highness the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive</span>," <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>that potentate is known to<br/>
use tobacco in no form; another is the ostentatious<br/>
advertisement of a barbering establishment that its<br/>
keeper is "Hair-dresser to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Right </span>Honorable<br/>
Diplomatic Agent of Great Britain, by Appointment," when it is seen that the gentleman referred<br/>
to has little need for tonsorial attentions. If these<br/>
petty <span style="color: #ff0000;">dishonesties </span>fail to convince one that the<br/>
Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">capital </span>is adopting European ways and<br/>
customs, the "Want to go shootin' <span style="color: #0000FF;">t'-dayt</span>" or the<br/>
"Want <span style="color: #0000FF;">anyt'ing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>-the latter <span style="color: #0000FF;">covering </span>a multitude<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sins</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-that </span>will be whispered in the stranger's ear<br/>
by native vagabonds a dozen times in the course<br/>
of a stroll in the Sharia <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kamel </span>or the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekieh<br/>
</span>Gardens, surely will; and the side-spring "Congress "boots, made of <span style="color: #0000FF;">questionable </span>leather, and the<br/>
ulsters and other English clothes of impossible check<br/>
or plaid, disfiguring the windows and fronts of shops<br/>
in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mouski</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>painfully accentuate the fact.<br/>
<br/>
