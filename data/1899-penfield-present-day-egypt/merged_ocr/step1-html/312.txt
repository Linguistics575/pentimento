<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Having no <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieial </span>position in the Egyptian administration, Prince Mehemet Ali passes a good<br/>
portion of each year in Paris. Every winter sees<br/>
him in Cairo, where, although a bachelor, he resides<br/>
in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">bijou </span>palace in the European quarter.<br/>
<br/>
The khedive has two sisters. The elder, the Princess Khadija, born in 1880, is married to a Turkish<br/>
notable, and spends much time at Constantinople;<br/>
the younger, the Princess Nimet, born in 1882, is<br/>
wedded to her cousin, Djemil Pasha, an accomplished and wealthy prince, who resides at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mounerah </span>Palace in Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
While a devout believer in the religion of the<br/>
Koran, the khedive has never taken advantage of its<br/>
provision that one may have four wives. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He </span>is a<br/>
monogamist, as was his father. The khedive has<br/>
no harem in the European sense. Each of his palaces, however, has its "harem division," which<br/>
means simply that portion set apart for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">khedivah </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">khedivah-m√©re </span>and their <span style="color: #0000FF;">enormous<br/>
</span>entourage. The attendants are young Turkish<br/>
women, coming <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>from the provinces of<br/>
Georgia and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Circassia</span>, and are attired in exquisite<br/>
garb of semi-European character.<br/>
<br/>
Although spoken of in the Orient as "slaves,"<br/>
many of these young women have the simplest<br/>
duties, and in Europe might almost be regarded as<br/>
ladies in waiting at court. It was a woman of this<br/>
class that was taken by the khedive for his wife,<br/>
and the published accounts of the marriage may<br/>
have shocked western-world readers, knowing little<br/>
of actual life in the East. It was in keeping with<br/>
