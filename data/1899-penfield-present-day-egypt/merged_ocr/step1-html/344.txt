<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Has England educated the Egyptians to govern<br/>
themselves?<br/>
<br/>
Not as yet, certainly.<br/>
<br/>
England's desire to remain in Egypt could not<br/>
better be served than by making her functionaries<br/>
appear essential to the well-being of the country;<br/>
in fact, by making progress dependent upon her<br/>
administrators, accountants, and irrigation experts<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>This they have surely done, and the "understudies <span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>of these clever servants, those who could best take<br/>
their places, are Englishmen, not Egyptians. There<br/>
are many hundred native subordinates doing the<br/>
simplest routine work, who perceive the splendid<br/>
results, but contribute thereto <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>by their <span style="color: #0000FF;">submissiveness</span>. They are not being instructed <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>to keep Egypt from retrogressing should<br/>
they find themselves in charge of affairs.<br/>
<br/>
The khedive is compelled to yield to England in<br/>
all matters connected with the choice of a ministry,<br/>
and this necessarily results in a partizan cabinet<br/>
acceptable to London. On occasions when the <span style="color: #0000FF;">khedive </span>has appointed a cabinet <span style="color: #0000FF;">officer </span>without first<br/>
securing the consent of England, he has been<br/>
promptly called to account, and the menacing display in the streets of his capital of thousands of<br/>
British guns and bayonets has not abated until the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>has been filled by an Egyptian practically<br/>
named by the British government.<br/>
<br/>
The real business of important executive departments in Cairo is directed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">under-secretaries<br/>
</span>(assistant ministers), who are English, and their<br/>
utterances and plans formally receive the sanction<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">322<br/>
