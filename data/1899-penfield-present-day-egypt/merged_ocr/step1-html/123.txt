<span>Alexandria, Seat of Commerce<br/>
<br/>
Cabanel, Sichel, Grolleau, and other artists have<br/>
exercised as much license in portraying the <span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful </span>woman as Shakspere and less renowned poets<br/>
have in describing her.<br/>
<br/>
The means employed by the baffled queen-too<br/>
proud to return to Rome after Antony's selfdestruction, to be exhibited in the festival celebrating the triumph of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Octavianus</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>produce<br/>
death unfortunately cannot be as directly dealt with<br/>
as the question of her descent. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrian<br/>
</span>suburbs to-day are groves of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fig-trees</span>, whose fruit,<br/>
arranged in flat baskets and covered with fig-leaves,<br/>
is sold by the roadside by native lads, as it might<br/>
have been in the time of Cleopatra. An occasional<br/>
lizard, basking in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">warm </span>sunshine on the sand,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>scurries away when footsteps approach, may<br/>
have suggested <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>asp story to a writer of long<br/>
ago, constructing a romantic epic or play. The<br/>
theory of the poisonous reptile conveyed to the<br/>
unhappy queen in a basket of figs is improbable.<br/>
Cleopatra was too experienced in Eastern <span style="color: #0000FF;">ways </span>not<br/>
to have understood the secret of poisons and have<br/>
them at hand. The brother-husband, sharing with<br/>
her the throne, had died from poison years before,<br/>
under circumstances that indicated his murderess;<br/>
and, besides, a woman of her vanity would choose<br/>
death from one of the destroying drugs known to<br/>
her, rather than from the poison of the asp, disfiguring in its agency of destruction.<br/>
<br/>
Many thousands of Mohammedans of the lower<br/>
social grades in Alexandria, and for that matter<br/>
throughout Lower Egypt, are slaves to the hashish<br/>
