centuries later, indicates that it had fallen into disuse and was most likely unnavigable. The Roman<br/>
emperors Trajan and Hadrian aspired each in his<br/>
time to make it possible for ships to go from one<br/>
sea to another, but the desert sands finally obliterated their efforts to pierce the Suez Isthmus.<br/>
<br/>
In the interval of centuries thus spanned, the<br/>
Nile had almost deserted its <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusiac </span>branch, and<br/>
Roman engineers, coming later, tapped the great<br/>
river above its bifurcation, near the capital of the<br/>
present day, and ran a new canal from that point<br/>
to the old <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bubastie </span>canal, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they cleared and<br/>
restored to use. But this system was only temporarily successful, and Amrou, the Arabian conqueror, found inter-sea navigation impossible, and<br/>
himself <span style="color: #ff0000;">essayed</span>, with partial success, to solve the<br/>
great problem. Then, after the sands of the Arabian<br/>
desert had for centuries asserted their dominion,<br/>
came the great Napoleon, to whom all things were<br/>
possible. Shortly after he had conquered the ancient land of the Pharaohs, in 1798, his engineers<br/>
were given the task of bringing the Mediterranean<br/>
into communication with the Gulf of Suez. They<br/>
studied the project assiduously, and estimating<br/>
from their surveys, as others before them had done,<br/>
that the Mediterranean was thirty feet below the<br/>
level of the Red Sea, recommended a complicated<br/>
scheme calling for sluices and locks. Napoleon's<br/>
evacuation of Egypt in 1801 caused the work to be<br/>
dropped while yet in embryo.<br/>
