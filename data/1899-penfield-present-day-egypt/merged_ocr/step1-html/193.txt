<span>Expansion by Irrigation<br/>
<br/>
It has been computed that more than half of the<br/>
Nile, with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">priceless </span>sediment, pours into the<br/>
Mediterranean. In other words, water and soil<br/>
enough to create many Egypts run to waste. Much<br/>
of this loss will always be inevitable, naturally.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Napoleon </span>had no sooner seen the Nile at Cairo than<br/>
he suggested a dam to hold back the surplus waters<br/>
and irrigate a larger area. Lord Nelson and General Abercrombie cut short Napoleon's plans for<br/>
administering Egypt; but his scheme for irrigating the Delta had been published, and forty years<br/>
later, in 1837, the construction of the great barrage<br/>
near Cairo, at the point where the Rosetta and<br/>
Damietta branches of the Nile bifurcate and their<br/>
arms <span style="color: #0000FF;">inclose </span>the Delta, was begun from plans by<br/>
Mougel Bey, a Frenchman. It took twenty-four<br/>
years to construct it, and then it was not a success,<br/>
for the first time it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>tried the force of the<br/>
dammed-up water was too great for the masonry,<br/>
which really rested on a foundation of mud.<br/>
<br/>
I overheard an amusing conversation one day at<br/>
the barrage. The engineer in charge <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>explaining the importance of the structure to a British<br/>
tourist, who apparently never permitted his <span style="color: #ff0000;">patriotie </span>ardor to slumber when away from home.<br/>
"Yes, it's a great work," said he, "and these <span style="color: #0000FF;">foreigners </span>ought to better appreciate what we are<br/>
doing for their good. This thing has put them<br/>
on their feet <span style="color: #0000FF;">financially</span>, sure enough; but I don't<br/>
believe they feel any gratitude for our having<br/>
built <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>"I beg your pardon," replied the gentle<br/>
representative of the khedival government, "but<br/>
