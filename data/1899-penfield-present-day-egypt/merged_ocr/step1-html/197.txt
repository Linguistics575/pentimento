would have been swept away had not the sluices<br/>
been quickly raised. From 1863 until it was taken<br/>
in hand by Sir Colin <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moncrieff </span>and Mr. Willcocks<br/>
in 1884, it was called upon to perform but a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fraction </span>of the duty <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>which it was planned. By<br/>
reason of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Monerieips </span>genius, the dam was in a few<br/>
years rendered safe, and much of the prosperity of<br/>
the Delta in these times is due to his triumph<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>If tradition be correct, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mougel </span>Bey's quick wit<br/>
saved the Gizeh Pyramids from destruction.<br/>
When he went to Mehemet Ali to be told where<br/>
the stones for the barrage were to come from, the<br/>
Viceroy said: "You have those great useless heaps<br/>
of stone; use them up, every block if need be, for<br/>
the purpose." The engineer, knowing what odium<br/>
would attach to his name if he agreed to this proposition, asked for a few days to make calculations.<br/>
Bis autocratic master would give but one day.<br/>
When the engineer again appeared he said the<br/>
cost of transporting the stone from the Pyramids<br/>
would be greater than to quarry it anew in the<br/>
hills. "Then let the Pyramids stay, and quarry<br/>
new stone," said the tyrant, and the monuments<br/>
were saved.<br/>

A direct annual return to the revenue of two million dollars-more than twice the sum to be paid<br/>

of water and taxation on lands that will be rendered<br/>
fruitful is promised. The government will fur<br/>
