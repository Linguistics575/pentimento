<span>Alexandria, Seat of Commerce<br/>
<br/>
with Pompey, is bf the familiar red granite of<br/>
Assuan. Some investigators believe that this<br/>
Corinthian column was once an obelisk, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tind </span>that<br/>
it was rounded to its present form by the Romans,<br/>
and, further, that its situation marks the site of<br/>
the famous Serapeum. It is known to have been<br/>
erected in the third century after Christ, to commemorate the capture of the city by the Emperor<br/>
Diocletian, after the rebellion of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Achilleus</span>. The<br/>
statue which must have adorned its summit long<br/>
since <span style="color: #0000FF;">disappeared</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">leaving </span>no trace to tell us whom<br/>
it represented. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">column</span>'s shadow falls to-day<br/>
upon a dreary Arab <span style="color: #0000FF;">cemetery-pathetic </span>symbol of<br/>
the buried glories of the metropolis it once graced.<br/>
<br/>
The two obelisks which Cleopatra or Cesar<br/>
removed from the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis to adorn the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Czesarium </span>were lost to Alexandria in Ismail's time. One, after lying prone for<br/>
centuries where it fell, is in London; the other in<br/>
New York.<br/>
<br/>
To the south of Alexandria lies the extensive<br/>
but shallow sheet of water known as Lake Mareotis. It covers what was once a fertile plain, possessing a lake upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>Alexandria depended<br/>
for fresh water. In 1801, when a British force <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>conducting an operation before the city, <span style="color: #ff0000;">then </span>in the<br/>
hands of Bonaparte's troops, it was deemed a good<br/>
strategic expedient to cut off <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>supply<br/>
of fresh water. To accomplish this the English<br/>
severed at Mex <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>neck of land separating the lake<br/>
from the Mediterranean, thereby admitting the sea<br/>
and flooding a hundred thousand acres of culti<br/>
