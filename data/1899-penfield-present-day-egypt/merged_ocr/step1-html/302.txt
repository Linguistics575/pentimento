invested in productive farms and cotton-plantations<br/>
in the Nile Delta. Bis habits tend to thrift, perhaps as the natural result of the downfall of Khedive Ismail, <span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span>extravagance has no parallel in<br/>
history. In addition to the khedive's grant from<br/>
the national <span style="color: #ff0000;">exohequer</span>, he receives another five<br/>
hundred thousand dollars for the support of his<br/>
mother, brother, sisters, and the various relatives<br/>
of the khedival family, nearly a hundred in<br/>
number.<br/>
<br/>
He is a strict <span style="color: #ff0000;">diseipr1narian</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">-ref1eeting </span>doubtless<br/>
his Austrian <span style="color: #0000FF;">training-but </span>is just, considerate, and<br/>
kind. State and show he dislikes, but insists on<br/>
receiving the <span style="color: #ff0000;">full </span>deference due his rank. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">childhood </span>the two brothers, in addressing each other,<br/>
invariably employed the full title, as Prince Abbas<br/>
Bey and Prince Mehemet Ali Bey. On one <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasion</span>, it is related, however, the latter was inclined<br/>
to be indolent and Shirk his lesson.<br/>
<br/>
"Come, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Prince</span>," urged the instructor, "it must<br/>
be done."<br/>
<br/>
Abbas <span style="color: #0000FF;">Boy </span>at once exclaimed: "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Prince</span>, indeed!<br/>
My brother is no prince when idle-he is only a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>One privileged to meet the khedive is led to the<br/>
audience-chamber through files of saluting guardsmen-in smart blue uniforms if it is winter and at<br/>
Abdin Palace in Cairo, or in white uniforms if it<br/>
is summer at Ras-el-Teen in Alexandria. He is<br/>
greeted at the door in a manner proving the <span style="color: #0000FF;">khedive</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>geniality. After shaking hands the visitor<br/>
is motioned to a seat on the divan with his High<br/>
280<br/>
