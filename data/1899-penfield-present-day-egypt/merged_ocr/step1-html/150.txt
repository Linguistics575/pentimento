<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
restoration of Egypt to admitted prosperity, consequently, at a period when shrinkage in prices of<br/>
cotton, sugar, and grain has been very great, must<br/>
be regarded as a conspicuous triumph. Khedive<br/>
Abbas and his eo-workers have much to accomplish<br/>
still; but system and economy being <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>established <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>a secure basis, the attainment to permanent success cannot be <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieult</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A striking feature of the governmental management of railways in Egypt is that only forty-three<br/>
per cent. of the gross receipts are applied to operating expenses. Native <span style="color: #ff0000;">1abor</span>, moderate speed of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ordinary </span>trains, and a rainless and frostless climate<br/>
make this possible. The state lines carry now upward of ten million passengers in a year, and the<br/>
receipts from all sources are not far from nine <span style="color: #0000FF;">million </span>dollars annually. By reason of the important<br/>
reduction of fares, previously spoken of, the number of passengers has been doubled in a few years.<br/>
All-rail travel from the Mediterranean to the first<br/>
cataract of the Nile has been possible for nearly a<br/>
year. From Luxor southward the railway is narrow-gage, harmonizing with the lines building in<br/>
the Sudan for military purposes.<br/>
<br/>
The rapid augmentation of winter travel to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>is helping the lot of the Egyptian materially.<br/>
In an average year the pleasure- and health-seekers,<br/>
approaching <span style="color: #0000FF;">eight </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thousand.in </span>number, distribute<br/>
fully five million dollars in the country, and it is<br/>
estimated that in a good season half this sum is<br/>
left behind by Americans.<br/>
