<span>Story of the Suez Canal<br/>
<br/>
the occasion a veritable "<span style="color: #ff0000;">triumph</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>to the great<br/>
Frenchman. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Forty-eight </span>ships conveyed the illustrious guests of the khedive--for Ismail was footing<br/>
the bill--through the canal; and, as if illustrating<br/>
the irony of fate and presaging the future, the first<br/>
vessel that paid dues after the formal opening flew<br/>
the British <span style="color: #0000FF;">dag</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">fttes </span>in Cairo, transforming<br/>
the capital into fairy-land for a month, at Ismail's<br/>
bidding, cost that forgiving prince or his government twenty-one million dollars.<br/>
<br/>
There was a movement in France at about the<br/>
time of De <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lesseps</span>'s death to have his name formally given to the canal, but the negotiations to<br/>
that end were never realized. Surprise had <span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>been felt that this had not been done, and<br/>
but for the lamentable Panama affair, impoverishing thousands of French homes and smirching <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>reputations of many statesmen, M. de Lesseps<br/>
would probably have had the satisfaction, while<br/>
still in the full enjoyment of his faculties, of seeing<br/>
his name indissolubly linked with his work. It is<br/>
not strange, however, that while Said Pasha gave<br/>
his name to an important town and <span style="color: #0000FF;">harbor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>Ismail<br/>

1 The Port Said entrance of the canal is protected <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>two massive<br/>
piers, the eastern running out into the sea. toward the north for a<br/>
mile, and the western running toward the northeast for nearly<br/>
two miles. Where they start from the land these piers are fourteen<br/>
hundred and forty yards apart, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>their extremities approach within<br/>
seven hundred and seventy yards of each other. The most serious<br/>
risk to which the harbor is exposed is that of being choked with<br/>
Nile mud, deposited on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusiac </span>coast by a current in the Mediterranean constantly flowing from the west. The western pier is <span style="color: #0000FF;">intended </span>to ward <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>these accumulations of sand and mud, and also<br/>
to shelter the harbor from the northwest winds which prevail during<br/>
