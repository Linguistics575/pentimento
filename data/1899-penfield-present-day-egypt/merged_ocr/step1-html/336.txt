<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
utterance of the Congress of the United States,<br/>
when, in declaring war against Spain to free the<br/>
people of Cuba, it was stated in language so clear<br/>
that ambiguity was out of the question: <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>That the<br/>
United States hereby disclaims any disposition or<br/>
intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or<br/>
control over said island, except for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">paeification<br/>
</span>thereof, and asserts its determination when that is<br/>
accomplished to leave the government and control<br/>
of the island to its people." The Englishman, alert<br/>
in seeking instances that tend to justify Britain's<br/>
position in Egypt, believes and hopes that he is<br/>
to have a helpful parallel in the outcome of our<br/>
relations with Cuba.<br/>
<br/>
Englishmen make a point of recalling that the<br/>
Sultan declined to send Turkish troops to quell the<br/>
Alexandrian disorders in 1882, and they likewise<br/>
point to Tunis, when justifying their attitude <span style="color: #0000FF;">toward </span>Egypt, and assert that France is doing with<br/>
that country exactly what the British are doing<br/>
with Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
There is now and then a spasmodic demand in<br/>
the British Isles, raised by "Little Englanders,"<br/>
that England's hand be lifted from Egypt, that the<br/>
Tory policy of grab be reversed. Mr. Gladstone<br/>
stated on all possible occasions that Britain had no<br/>
right to remain in Egypt, and politicians of the<br/>
Dilke, Harcourt, Courtney, Labouchere, and Marriott type frequently raise their voices in <span style="color: #0000FF;">condemnation </span>of a continuance of British rule in Egypt.<br/>
These men talk only when their party in Parliament is in the minority, however; should one of<br/>
