<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Cairo or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria</span>, holding the reins over a dashing pair, and accompanied by an <span style="color: #0000FF;">aide-de-camp </span>or<br/>
one of his many relatives.<br/>
<br/>
Before the heat of summer comes, the khedival<br/>
establishment, with its army of <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieials </span>and attendants, moves to Alexandria. Six railway-trains are<br/>
required to transfer the court. The khedive and<br/>
his ministers and other high <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieers </span>go in state in<br/>
an observation <span style="color: #ff0000;">saloon-car </span>of American make.<br/>
<br/>
The historic structure, Ras-el-Teen, overlooking<br/>
Alexandria harbor, is treated by the khedive simply<br/>
as an <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieial </span>palace, as Abdin is in Cairo. The<br/>
home-loving instinct has caused the khedive to<br/>
create a summer retreat at Montazah, snugly nestled<br/>
on the picturesque Mediterranean coast, a few miles<br/>
to the east of Alexandria. There the family life,<br/>
with artistic and musical surroundings, is carried<br/>
on in charming simplicity. Perplexities arising<br/>
from conferences at Ras-el-Teen are left in the<br/>
precincts of the old palace.<br/>
<br/>
A mile to the eastward of Montazah is Abukir<br/>
Bay, made famous by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nelson</span>'s victory over the<br/>
French fleet little more than a century ago. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Although </span>Montazah was reclaimed from the desert<br/>
only six <span style="color: #0000FF;">years </span>since, forests of quick-growing trees<br/>
have sprung into existence; many <span style="color: #0000FF;">varieties </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>gamebirds and animals have been domiciled there, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eluding </span>native antelope and European red deer, for<br/>
the khedive is an ardent sportsman. In a remote<br/>
part of the estate is the camp of the khedive's<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eamel-eorps</span>, whose Bedouin riders are trained<br/>
marksmen, and with whom he makes long journeys<br/>
