and with the German in the choicest language of the<br/>
Austrian court. Later he conducts affairs with the<br/>
Sultan's representative in Turkish, and may conclude the day by presiding over a council of his<br/>
ministry, when all sorts of intricate details of policy<br/>
are arranged in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabic</span>, the native tongue of Egypt,<br/>
and one of the most difficult of languages. The<br/>
evening may see his Highness at the theater, listening with pleasure and understanding to opera<br/>
rendered in Italian.<br/>
<br/>
The accomplishment yielding the khedive his<br/>
greatest pleasure, next to his horsemanship, is his<br/>
musical <span style="color: #0000FF;">proficiency</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>is a skilful pianist, and<br/>
has a correct ear for melody. Included in his entourage are forty or fifty picked musicians, constituting his private band, whose position is anything<br/>
but a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sinecure</span>. At Koubbeh the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bandsmen </span>are<br/>
quartered close to the palace, and an abbreviated<br/>
rehearsal or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flagrantly </span>false note receives immediate attention from his Highness, it is said.<br/>
<br/>
Abbas Pasha does not claim infallibility, but<br/>
realizes, like his seniors, that administrative mistakes can be made. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>is a very different man<br/>
from the ordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">type </span>of Oriental sovereign, having no religious bigotry, narrowness of thought, or<br/>
ignorance of the outside world. A desire to promote <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>welfare of his people is his controlling<br/>
thought, and under his guidance their future would<br/>
be full of encouragement and hope.<br/>
<br/>
The khedive receives a yearly grant from the<br/>
Egyptian government of <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>hundred thousand<br/>
dollars. His private wealth is great, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
