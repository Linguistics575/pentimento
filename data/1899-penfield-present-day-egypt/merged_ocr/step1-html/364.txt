great Rameses, or Menes himself, nerve-resting in<br/>
its inscrutability.<br/>
<br/>
The excursion to Sakkarah and Memphis is more<br/>
easily made from Mena than from Cairo, and the<br/>
choice of conveyances ranges from camels to <span style="color: #ff0000;">broadwheeled </span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">sand-carts</span>." To the west of Mena is<br/>
desert, stretching far and wide for thousands of<br/>
miles, to Tripoli, Algeria, and Morocco, terminating<br/>
only when the Atlantic Ocean is reached. To the<br/>
east is the Nile valley, and Cairo ten miles away.<br/>
Polo and shooting are every-day diversions. More<br/>
interesting still is the ever-present opportunity to<br/>
study the human species, from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lordly </span>Bedouin<br/>
sheik to the highly developed product of latter-day<br/>
civilization in Europe, who, maybe, has successfully "tooled" a four-in-hand coach all the way<br/>
from Shepheard's, over a faultless road, to the Mena<br/>
piazza. Of the two, judged physically, the brown<br/>
son of the desert is the finer and better-visaged.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Happily possessed of a golfing-ground and a marble swimming-bath, as well as a resident chaplain<br/>
for the piously inclined, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">a'dark </span>room' for the<br/>
ubiquitous photographer, what more," asks cynical<br/>
Marie Corelli in her Egyptian novel "Ziska," quoting from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menu </span>House advertisement, "can the<br/>
aspiring soul of the modern tourist <span style="color: #0000FF;">desire</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>It surely is a far cry from invalidism to chicken<br/>
incubators; but persons who have lolled away a<br/>
winter at Mena can hardly expect to be invalids<br/>
when February <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>March comes. By that time<br/>
daily jaunts have taken the place of <span style="color: #0000FF;">physicians'<br/>
</span>prescriptions. To these I can recommend nothing<br/>
