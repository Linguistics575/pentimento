<span>Ismail as Khedive and Exile<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismail</span>'s love for doing things that would attract<br/>
notice and make talk. It was a document relating<br/>
how one of my predecessors, twenty or twentyfive years before, having business at Ras-el-Teen<br/>
Palace in Alexandria, was invited to defer his return to the capital, and dine that night with the<br/>
khedive. The American representative stated that<br/>
he was unprepared, having brought no evening<br/>
dress. <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>That will be all right," exclaimed his<br/>
Highness. "At seven <span style="color: #0000FF;">o'cloek </span>you will find your<br/>
clothes at your hotel." A telegram was <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched<br/>
</span>from the palace to Cairo, and a special messenger,<br/>
traveling by special train, brought the desired raiment. It cost somebody-probably the Egyptian<br/>
taxpayer--a considerable sum for running the train<br/>
a hundred and thirty miles, and was wholly unnecessary, for the resources of Alexandria could have<br/>
produced a dozen suits of evening garments in no<br/>
time. But that was <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismail</span>'s way of doing things.<br/>
<br/>
In <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismaiys </span>character there was little that could<br/>
be commended, yet one could not wholly withhold<br/>
admiration for his grandeur of thought and intrepidity of action. He was a ruler of magnificent<br/>
but inchoate ideas, in which he often got bewildered; and he invariably embarked in enterprises<br/>
without thinking of the cost. To deal adequately<br/>
with a character so regal, <span style="color: #0000FF;">egotistic</span>, masterful, and<br/>
subtle, to extenuate nothing, and at the same time<br/>
set <span style="color: #0000FF;">nothing </span>down in malice, is a task not easily<br/>
. performed. He certainly left his impress on history, and had he not lived it is doubtful if Cairo<br/>
would to-day be half as acceptable to its winter<br/>
