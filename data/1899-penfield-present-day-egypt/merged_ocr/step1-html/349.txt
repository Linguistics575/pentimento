<span>Britain's Position in Egypt<br/>

the men and women teachers of the American<br/>
Mission. The college of the Mission at Assiut, long<br/>
presided over by the Rev. Dr. Alexander, is a model<br/>
institution whose standard of education has few<br/>
rivals in the Turkish dominions.<br/>
<br/>
Since England has done but little to develop a<br/>
class that may in time take the positions now filled<br/>
by her own countrymen, Anglophobe critics point<br/>
to this as confirmatory evidence of the insincerity<br/>
of the statement that England ever intends the<br/>
Egyptians to take the helm of state.<br/>
<br/>
A <span style="color: #0000FF;">flagrant </span>error of British administration, until<br/>
two years ago, was the omission to introduce the<br/>
English language. Egypt is a polyglot country,<br/>
and the incorporation of English as an official<br/>
language might with propriety have followed<br/>
the introduction of the present system of affairs.<br/>
French, consequently, remains the only European<br/>
language known to any extent by the educated natives; and where there is one Egyptian who knows<br/>
English, forty who read and write French can be<br/>
found. Only one of the khedive's ministers knows a<br/>
word of English, yet all six are proficient in French.<br/>

The <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>language of the government has been<br/>
French for many years. Official publications and<br/>
correspondence are in French. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>European<br/>
language of the railways and postal department.<br/>
Postage-stamps, railway-tickets, and telegraph<br/>
forms, actually printed in England, express their<br/>
values and conditions in French and Arabic. English employees in governmental bureaus write <span style="color: #0000FF;">officially </span>to one another in French, frequently to the<br/>
