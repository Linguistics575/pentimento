<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
is only in Alexandria that this endless variety may<br/>
be found. Cairo, like Washington, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>and<br/>
administrative in all its attributes-everything,<br/>
perhaps, but commercial; Alexandria, on the other<br/>
hand, is as exclusively commercial as Liverpool.<br/>
<br/>
In the selection of the site to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the great<br/>
Macedonian was to give his name, Alexander<br/>
proved himself to possess the unerring instinct of<br/>
engineering genius. A less able man might have<br/>
chosen the natural harbor of one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Niles<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mouths.. </span>But Alexander evidently was aware of<br/>
the current sweeping the whole northern shore of<br/>
Africa from west to east, and his foresight told him<br/>
that a harbor to serve as a port for his projected<br/>
Eastern <span style="color: #0000FF;">dominions </span>must be west of the several<br/>
mouths of the great river, to be safe from the<br/>
accumulation of the alluvial soil ever sweeping into<br/>
the Mediterranean. It was this soil-laden wash<br/>
that choked the old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusiac </span>harbor beyond Port<br/>
Said, and that to-day, in spite of bars and breakwaters, makes the task of keeping the entrance to<br/>
the Suez <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canal </span>open for ships of deep draft a <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieult </span>one. Hence the wisdom of Alexander the<br/>
Great, and the foundation of Alexandria in the<br/>
year 332 B. <span style="color: #0000FF;">c.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The diminutive island of Pharos must have been<br/>
employed as a shelter for shipping in Alexander's<br/>
reign, and the first of his lieutenants to wear the<br/>
crown of Egypt, Ptolemy Soter, constructed thereon<br/>
the Pharos tower, famed in history as the father of<br/>
lighthouses. It is recorded that this tower <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>nearly six hundred feet high, and that on its top<br/>
<br/>
80<br/>
