or four rainy days during a winter. At Mena<br/>
House and Helouan the rainfall is generally less<br/>
than in the capital, while at Luxor and Assuan a<br/>
shower is regarded by the natives as a wonder of<br/>
nature. Alexandria and other places on the Mediterranean do not share the general immunity of<br/>
the rest of the country from storms. Cairo's mean<br/>
temperature for November, December, J <span style="color: #ff0000;">anuary</span>,<br/>
and February is about 62° F., as compared with 63°<br/>
at Orotava, 61° at Madeira, and 49° at Nice and<br/>
Mentone. Egypt is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Winterland </span>par excellence.<br/>
<br/>
On the coldest days in Cairo the thermometer<br/>
never falls below 34°, and this degree of <span style="color: #0000FF;">frigidity<br/>
</span>occurs only at long intervals. Some Cairenes recall a slight snowfall a half-century ago, and a thin<br/>
film of ice on pools in the suburbs may be seen several times in the average winter. This is caused<br/>
by the desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>on the early morning air,<br/>
and is of short duration after sunrise. The cool<br/>
nights of winter give the air much of its stimulating property; and in summer, however hot the<br/>
days, the nights are nearly always made comfortable by cooling breezes from the desert.<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptian year has but two seasons, summer<br/>
and winter. The period of <span style="color: #0000FF;">warm </span>weather lasts eight<br/>
or nine months, while winter is confined practically<br/>
to the months of December, <span style="color: #0000FF;">January</span>, and February. It is only in J uly, August, and September that<br/>
the heat is intense; the rest of the year is <span style="color: #0000FF;">climatically </span>agreeable. When the Nile is high, in the<br/>
autumn, there is at times sufficient humidity to<br/>
cause some discomfort, especially when the humid<br/>
