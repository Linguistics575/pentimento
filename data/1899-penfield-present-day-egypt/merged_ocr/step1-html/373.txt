<span>In Egypt for Health's <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sake<br/>
<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty-five </span>miles, yet the journey seemingly<br/>
takes one into the heart of Africa. Assuan is the<br/>
frontier of Egypt proper, the first cataract of the<br/>
Nile being nature's indicated boundary, south of<br/>
which is the limitless domain of Nubia and the.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sudan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>territorial extension, so to speak.<br/>
Assuan has many of the characteristics of frontier<br/>
towns in other countries. One sees there the <span style="color: #0000FF;">military </span>side of the governmental administration, and<br/>
discovers that martial rather than civil <span style="color: #0000FF;">law </span>is in<br/>
force. The temperature is a few degrees higher<br/>
than at Luxor, abbreviating the season of sojourn<br/>
by a week or two, many travelers there meeting<br/>
the tropical sun and moving northward with it.<br/>
The roomy Assuan Hotel has culinary possibilities<br/>
and material comforts in <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>number to make<br/>
one forget that its location almost borders on the<br/>
tropic of Cancer. Lacking the unique antiquarian<br/>
value of Luxor, perhaps, Assuan in these days provides many compensating attractions. It is a center where strange-looking desert people congregate,<br/>
whose dress and customs admit of no suspicion of<br/>
being assumed for spectacular <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>. Among<br/>
members of the tribe of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bischarins </span>may be seen boys<br/>
and girls who would make the sculptor long to reproduce their classical features and graceful poses.<br/>
If the trip to the island of Elephantine be disappointing, the excursion to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philee </span>is wholly <span style="color: #0000FF;">satisfying</span>, for there exists nothing more beautiful in the<br/>
domain of ancient art. But the army of dam-builders, engaged in a work meaning much for the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eo11nt1T</span>'s progress, is destined so to alter nature at<br/>
