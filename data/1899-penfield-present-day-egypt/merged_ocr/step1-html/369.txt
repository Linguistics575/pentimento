<span>In Egypt for Health's Sake<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">houses-many </span>of them of bungalow design-in<br/>
their little gardens, the whole enveloped in the<br/>
driest, most exhilarating air you can dream of.<br/>
The Romans, clever fellows as they were, knew the<br/>
importance of Helouan, and built there grand<br/>
houses and bathing-places, remains of which the<br/>
visitor to-day may gaze upon. Did they have <span style="color: #0000FF;">neuralgia </span>or rheumatism<span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span>Not for long, surely. The<br/>
hills around Helouan contain many caverns to be<br/>
explored, many sepulchers to be discovered; there<br/>
are glorious walks-even the rheumatic can walk<br/>

</span>go." For those who prefer rest, a good story-book,<br/>
or a color-box and sketching-materials, are in<br/>
order. And all this is little more than a <span style="color: #ff0000;">halfhour</span>'s journey from the Egyptian metropolis!<br/>
The medicinal advantages of Helouan, perhaps as<br/>
potent as those of Aix-les-Bains, are known far<br/>
afield, in England, France, Germany, and even in<br/>
Russia.<br/>
<br/>
A district that should <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>better known to the<br/>
seeker for health whose invalidism is not too pronounced is the Fayum, accessible from Cairo in<br/>
two or three hours by slow railway-train. It has<br/>
more natural beauty than any other place in Egypt,<br/>
and is not inappropriately called the "rose-garden." If one would combine the pleasure of the<br/>
artist with the quest of health, and be not too<br/>
exacting in the matter of hotel comforts, I know of<br/>
no place so fascinating and fruitful of subjects for<br/>
