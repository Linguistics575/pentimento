prosperity. The story of that <span style="color: #ff0000;">eo11ntry</span>'s emergence<br/>
from practical bankruptcy, with its securities<br/>
quoted nearly as high as English consols, reads like<br/>
a romance; and there is no better example of<br/>
economical progress through administrative reform than is presented by Egypt under British<br/>
rule.<br/>
<br/>
Security is assured to person and property, slavery has been legally abolished, <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>corruption<br/>
is almost a thing of the past, forced labor for publie works is no longer permitted, and native courts<br/>
have now more than a semblance of justice. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hygienic </span>matters have been so carefully looked after that<br/>
the population has increased from seven to nearly<br/>
ten millions in a decade or more. Land-taxes have<br/>
been lowered and equalized and are systematically<br/>
collected, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">seientifie </span>irrigation is so generally<br/>
employed that the cultivable area has been considerably extended. Egypt was probably never so<br/>
prosperous as at the present time. The debt is<br/>
being slightly reduced, and will be made less burdensome, as time goes on, by the increased productiveness of the soil. It is indeed a mighty stride<br/>
from the Egypt of Ismail Pasha to the Egypt of<br/>
Lord Cromer.<br/>
<br/>
The present external debt of Egypt is approximately five hundred and eight million dollars, and<br/>
it is a popular error that it has been reduced since<br/>
the advent of the English. As a fact, it has been<br/>
increased by forty million dollars. This went to<br/>
indemnify Alexandrians whose property was <span style="color: #0000FF;">destroyed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the time of the rebellion and bombard<br/>
