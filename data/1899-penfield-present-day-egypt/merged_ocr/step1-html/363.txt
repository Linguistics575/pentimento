<span>In Egypt for Health's Sake<br/>
<br/>
descriptions of the horrors of this hot wind. If the<br/>
contemporary development of Egypt is in any way<br/>
affecting the blowing of the khamsin, as many<br/>
claim, then the British are responsible for a benefit<br/>
heretofore overlooked by their championing press.<br/>
Alexandrian boatmen, a few years ago, in enumerating their reasons for not favoring the English<br/>
occupation of their country, would claim that fishing had become impossible in certain parts of the<br/>
harbor. "The fish no longer bite since the British<br/>
came," they would say. This serious charge, if<br/>
challenged, would lead to the explanation that the<br/>
debris gathered after the bombardment of 1882, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ineluding </span>hundreds of tons of mortar and plaster,<br/>
was dumped into the sea at points where navigation would not be impeded, and that the lime<br/>
drove the fish away, never to return. This is a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fact</span>.<br/>

If it is believed that Cairo presents too many seductive dissipations for the health-seeker, Mena<br/>
House, at the foot of the Pyramids, has much to<br/>
offer to those needing rest with nerve-toning surroundings, and especially those having weak lungs.<br/>
The neighborhood itself possesses enough to keep<br/>
the mind profitably employed for weeks; for towering over Mena House are the Pyramids of Gizeh<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>fact, the hotel is built with material removed<br/>
from titanic Cheops, though it is scarcely missed<br/>
from the king of pyramids. Close by is the Sphinx,<br/>
as mysterious to the present-day person pursuing<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">rest-cure </span>as it was to Napoleon on the occasion<br/>
of his midnight invocation, or to Herodotus, or the<br/>
