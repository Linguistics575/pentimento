<span>Paradoxical Administration<br/>
<br/>
tor; and the honors bestowed upon him-knighthood first, then a barony and peerage, and finally<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">viseountship-but </span>inadequately discharge the<br/>
debt that his government owes him. So determined is he to carry his administration of Egypt<br/>
to a triumphant termination that an offer of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroyship </span>of India, or a cabinet position in <span style="color: #ff0000;">London</span>, has awakened no desire to leave Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
Lord <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cromer </span>is defacto ruler of Egypt, the visible but <span style="color: #0000FF;">unclassified </span>representative of the majesty<br/>
of Great Britain, with almost unlimited power and<br/>
authority. <span style="color: #0000FF;">De </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">jure </span>he is Britain's diplomatic representative ,--<span style="color: #0000FF;">nothing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">more</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-aud </span>his exequatur issues from the Sublime Porte in exactly the same<br/>
form as that of the representative of any other<br/>
government at the court of the khedive. This is<br/>
but one of the paradoxes incident to present-day<br/>
Egypt. Possessing little aptitude for accepted<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">formulae </span>of diplomacy, perhaps, Lord Cromer<br/>
makes a thoroughly reliable doyen of the diplomatic corps, which he is because his appointment antedates that of any of his colleagues. He<br/>
cares nothing for display, detests shams, is a keen<br/>
judge of men, and selects his assistants <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>such<br/>
discernment that his judgment seldom errs. Devoid of a sense of humor, and unimaginative, Lord<br/>
Cromer analyzes with great care a question in<br/>
which the interests of others are concerned; and, an<br/>
opinion formed, his conclusion is bound to prevail.<br/>
Viscount Cromer is a man of marvelous industry.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>reads Homer, learns a <span style="color: #0000FF;">language</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-even </span>Turkish ,--and plays tennis or whist with the same<br/>
