<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
For two years the subscription books had been<br/>
open without attracting serious investors. Again<br/>
did the resourceful De Lesseps think of the amiable<br/>
pasha down in Egypt, and again was he appealed<br/>
to for succor. Said was this time induced to subscribe for 177,662 shares out of the 400,000 representing the Suez <span style="color: #ff0000;">eompany</span>'s total capitalization;<br/>
and he further pledged himself to contribute in<br/>
other ways to the construction of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eanal-and </span>this <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the affair that originally was to cost<br/>
Egypt not a piaster! The <span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroy</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent<br/>
</span>subscription dazzled impressionable France, and<br/>
for a time a torrent of gold flowed into the Paris<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offices </span>of the Suez company. When it came<br/>
time for Said to pay for the bonds he had so<br/>
dramatically bespoken, however, he was forced to<br/>
confess that he was suffering from <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>cramp<br/>
himself, and could supply no more cash. "N <span style="color: #0000FF;">0 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mat..<br/>
</span>ter," said the members of the canal ring; <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>we can<br/>
get the <span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroy</span>'s promises to pay discounted in<br/>
Europe." This they did, the obligations taking the<br/>
form of treasury warrants, bearing ten per cent.<br/>
interest, and payable in four yearly instalments.<br/>
These obligations, with their interest, the whole a<br/>
charge upon the Egyptian treasury, totaled 24, 705,734 francs! Was it to be wondered at that<br/>
Egypt became a happy hunting-ground for <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>sportsmen?<br/>
<br/>
In 1863 the magnificent Ismail inherited the<br/>
viceroyship from his deceased uncle. This placed<br/>
a prince of immense fortune in control of Egypt,<br/>
and the impecunious canal ring blessed the good<br/>
