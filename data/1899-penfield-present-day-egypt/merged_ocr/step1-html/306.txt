A remarkable memory enables the khedive to<br/>
converse effectively on almost any topic. When<br/>
on' military subjects he will speak of the excellent<br/>
services rendered the Egyptian army by the Americans who placed it on a footing of <span style="color: #ff0000;">effieieney </span>in his<br/>
grandfather's time. It is the firmly set mouth that<br/>
indicates his determination, inherited from Ismail,<br/>
and Which his own father did not possess. The<br/>
khedive is by some called stubborn and obstinate;<br/>

His Highness rises usually at half-past five <span style="color: #ff0000;">o'eloek</span>,<br/>

until sunset. It is his custom to appear on the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghizereh </span>oval, in Cairo, every Friday afternoon in<br/>
