<span>Alexandria, Seat of Commerce<br/>
<br/>
A primitive line of railway, owned by Englishmen<br/>
and very profitable, sets down passengers at several<br/>
stations. Mustapha Pasha station accommodates<br/>
the British soldiers housed in the old khedival<br/>
palace, and St. Stephano station is the objective<br/>
point of the haut ton going to spend an evening at<br/>
the casino, or have a cooling swim in the Mediterranean. When Alexandrians desire to celebrate,<br/>
singly or collectively, they go to the Ramleh casino,<br/>
and do it well. Pashas and others having no need<br/>
for observing regularity of hours in town drive<br/>
back and forth on the splendid road patronized by<br/>
his Highness the Khedive when he passes to and<br/>
fro between Montazah and Ras-el-Teen Palace.<br/>
<br/>
Besides being very convenient, this Egyptian<br/>
Long Branch is exceedingly pleasant at all times.<br/>
The blue sea, stretching to the horizon, is ever<br/>
soothing to exhausted nerves, and in summer bears<br/>
a refreshing inshore breeze with commendable regularity. In the mad race to get away from Egypt in<br/>
the early summer, hundreds of people go farther<br/>
and fare worse than if contenting themselves with<br/>
the easily attainable comforts of Ramleh.<br/>
<br/>
Abukir possesses resources of interest amply<br/>
rewarding a visit to this place where history has<br/>
been made, not to inspect the insignificant village,<br/>
but to view the bay where one of the greatest<br/>
of naval engagements was contested. The semicircular bay is surrounded by obsolete forts and earthworks, many of whose guns are dismantled, and all<br/>
of a type long ago discarded. A pleasant half-day<br/>
may be passed about these forts, <span style="color: #ff0000;">WithJunch-basket<br/>
