<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Tewfik preferred the early morning for work, and<br/>
documents dealing with public affairs were then<br/>
read and arranged before his secretaries were astir.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>always varied his labors with outdoor exercise,<br/>
and many were the anecdotes related by him of the<br/>
experiences with soldiers and policemen who did<br/>
not recognize as the khedive the sleek, rotund<br/>
little man taking a morning constitutional. He<br/>
frequently slipped over to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghizereh </span>gardens<br/>
at sunrise to view the horticultural beauties when<br/>
only the fellah was astir. Returning to the palace<br/>
from one of these rambles, he was stopped by a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">good-natured </span>British soldier doing sentry duty at<br/>
the main entrance, with these words: "Hi, there!<br/>
Yer can't go in'ere, yer know."<br/>
<br/>
"But I belong to the palace," said the khedive,<br/>
enjoying the situation.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, do <span style="color: #0000FF;">yer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>Well, what sort of a place'ave yer<br/>
got, anyway<span style="color: #ff0000;">?</span>" added Tommy Atkins, convinced<br/>
of his right to have a bit of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehaif </span>with any "<span style="color: #ff0000;">furriner</span>."<br/>
<br/>
"Very good."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Ah, fine times, I s'pose; nothin' to do and<br/>
plenty to eat, from the look o' yer. Wouldn't mind<br/>
servin' this chap meself, if'e'd find me five bob a<br/>
day."<br/>
<br/>
A sergeant on his rounds cut short the <span style="color: #0000FF;">soldier's<br/>
</span>lingo, and his Highness went into the palace to his<br/>
books and papers, enjoying the joke more than the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">diseomfited </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">redcoat </span>did.<br/>
