</span>THE STORY OF THE SUEZ CANAL<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">OOABULARIES </span>of praise and censure have<br/>
<br/>
been well-nigh exhausted on Ismail Pasha<br/>
and Ferdinand de Lesseps, whose deaths were<br/>
chronicled, during my residence in Cairo, simply as<br/>
items of news rather than events; but the nineteenth century is indebted to them for one of its<br/>
greatest achievements, a work of <span style="color: #0000FF;">incalculable </span>value<br/>
to the whole world, Egypt alone excepted. Their<br/>
lives had run in channels strangely similar. Each<br/>
had been a mighty personage, the cynosure of the<br/>
world's gaze; and, in the case of each, death delayed until the man's importance had been forgotten in a slough of degradation, the one in exile,<br/>
the other in the oblivion of mental decay.<br/>
<br/>
That Egypt reaps no benefit from the international waterway crossing its domain, there uniting<br/>
the Orient with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Occident</span>, is an amazing statement, manifestly. And it is a sad fact that the<br/>
Suez <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canal</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Which </span>has played a mighty political part<br/>
with European nations, has made and unmade khedives, and by a strange fatality has passed from the<br/>
control of the nation that built it to that of the<br/>
country that fought its construction strenuously,<br/>
