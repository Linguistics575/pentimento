<span>Tewfik and the Arabi Rebellion<br/>
<br/>
But I find myself drifting into a needless description of the rebellion, and the bombardment<br/>
of the forts of Alexandria on J uly 11 and 12, 1882,<br/>
with the wanton massacre of thousands of innocent<br/>
people by the natives, maddened to frenzy by Arabi<br/>
and his followers. It is a page of history too well<br/>
known to be repeated, and has no place in these<br/>
slight sketches.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Moberly Bell, a fair-minded English writer on<br/>
the subject of contemporary Egypt, in recording<br/>
his opinions of the campaign as he saw it, says<br/>
this of Arabi: <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>It may be admitted that the whole<br/>
country sided with Arabi up to the day of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tel-elKebir</span>, but the <span style="color: #0000FF;">significance </span>of this fact is apparent<br/>
when we remember that the whole country was<br/>
against him the day afterward. Again, the general promise held out to millions of fellaheen that<br/>
all debts due to Europeans should be canceled<br/>
would have enabled the devil himself to have made<br/>
converts. In Egypt, the man who succeeds is always popular; the man who has power leads the<br/>
nation. Arabi got power, not by his ability, but<br/>
<br/>
Arabi, the Egyptian.' Nine tenths at least of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called'rebel'<br/>
</span>army were only too delighted at the opportunity of throwing away<br/>
their arms and their uniforms, of donning once more with all haste<br/>
their <span style="color: #ff0000;">galabiahs </span>of blue cotton, and returning to the unconstrained<br/>
life and patient labor in their beloved fields, which were so much<br/>
more congenial to them than the duties and the dangers of military<br/>
service. The next day two squadrons of British cavalry reached<br/>
Cairo. They had ridden straight across the desert, some <span style="color: #0000FF;">forty </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">miles</span>,<br/>
and both men and horses were nearly dead from fatigue; yet the<br/>
citadel and city, though occupied by a strong body of Arabi's troops,<br/>
surrendered without a show of resistance. The'rebellion' was at<br/>
