marked by all possible pomp and circumstance.<br/>
Funeral pageants and the stately etiquette of European court mourning are entirely foreign to the<br/>
spirit of Islam; but the Egyptian capital has long<br/>
been accustomed to compromises, which are <span style="color: #0000FF;">lamented </span>only by the strictest Mohammedans.<br/>
