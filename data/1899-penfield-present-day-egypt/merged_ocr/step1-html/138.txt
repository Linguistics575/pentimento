expenses. Not since the courts were created has<br/>
the United States been represented by abler judges<br/>
than at present. J <span style="color: #ff0000;">udges </span>Keiley, Tuck, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Batcheller </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">refleet </span>credit alike on their profession and the<br/>
government that selected them.<br/>
<br/>
Inasmuch as the jurisdiction of the international courts has extended since the <span style="color: #0000FF;">reconquest </span>of<br/>
the Sudan, the Egyptian government is agitating<br/>
the matter of sending judges on circuit to Assuan,<br/>
Suakim, and other places, if they can be <span style="color: #ff0000;">pr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">evailed<br/>
</span>upon to travel such distances.<br/>
<br/>
The exclusion of the English language from<br/>
these courts has for years been an obvious anomaly,<br/>
particularly so when it is learned that more than<br/>
one half of the trade of the country is with Great<br/>
Britain and her colonies, and that nearly one half<br/>
the tonnage entering Alexandria harbor is British.<br/>
International jealousy has made it difficult to<br/>
change in any measure the organic scheme of the<br/>
courts, and until now <span style="color: #0000FF;">Great </span>Britain has feared to<br/>
press the question of admitting the English language. A change is inevitable.<br/>
<br/>
To take the census in Egypt it is necessary for<br/>
the Egyptian government first to assure the representatives of the powers that its agents will only<br/>
knock at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">foreigner</span>'s door and request the desired<br/>
information. Under no provocation will the inquisitor enter the domicile, except upon the invitation of its occupant. Giovanni, the Italian <span style="color: #0000FF;">subject</span>,<br/>
who opens an innocent roulette game in his back<br/>
room for revenue, has no more to fear from the<br/>
police of Egypt than from the police of Patagonia,<br/>
