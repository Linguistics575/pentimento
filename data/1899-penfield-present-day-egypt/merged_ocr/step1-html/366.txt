<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
of Heliopolis, the Virgin's tree, and the locale of<br/>
Kl√©ber's <span style="color: #0000FF;">victory </span>over the Turkish legion, present<br/>
possibilities of great <span style="color: #0000FF;">scope </span>to the reader of history.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">ostrich-farm </span>close by, and the neighboring<br/>
khedival estate of Koubbeh, are objects of interest, as well. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh </span>has much to commend it to<br/>
sufferers from incipient consumption and bronchial<br/>
disorders.<br/>
<br/>
Singly or in combination, the springs and unadulterated air of Helouan are believed by hosts of<br/>
people to offer a complete cure for rheumatism and<br/>
neuralgia. To the imagination of some folks, the<br/>
odor of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">.place </span>is of a suggestive character, for,<br/>
set in the middle of the desert, where <span style="color: #ff0000;">sulphursprings </span>abound, the air smells strongly of <span style="color: #0000FF;">brimstone </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">whichever </span>way the wind blows. But this<br/>
effect soon passes off, and to the neuralgia patient in<br/>
particular, after a little time, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>appears a<br/>
heaven. Helouan is<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>a gem of a town set in a<br/>
golden circle of sand, with a grand view of the river,<br/>
and palm forests bounded by more desert and a<br/>
number of pyramids in front of you; and behind,<br/>
the everlasting Mokattam Bills, that run from Cairo<br/>
hundreds of miles southward, with a branch range<br/>
extending to the Red Sea. To the left is the<br/>
desert again, with a view of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pencil-proportioned<br/>
</span>minarets of the Mehemet Ali mosque in Cairo,<br/>
fields of intensely verdant green, and beyond, the<br/>
great silent form of the Cheops pyramid keeping watch over all. <span style="color: #0000FF;">At </span>Helouan are comfortable<br/>
hotels, first-rate bath establishments with capable<br/>
physicians in attendance, plenty of little <span style="color: #0000FF;">white<br/>
