<span>CHAPTER VIII<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">TEWFIK </span>PASHA AND THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">ARABI </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">REBELLION<br/>
<br/>
</span>EW events in modern history are more pathetically dramatic than the substitution of<br/>
Tewfik for Ismail. The Turkish grand <span style="color: #0000FF;">vizir </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched </span>two telegrams to Cairo on June 26, 1879.<br/>
One was to "Ismail Pasha, ex-Khedive of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt </span>";<br/>
the other to Mohammed Tewfik, his son. In the<br/>
former it was stated that his Imperial Majesty the<br/>
Sultan, as the result of a decision of his council of<br/>
ministers, had formally decided to request Ismail's<br/>
retirement from the khedivate, in favor of the next<br/>
in succession, his Highness Tewfik Pasha, and that<br/>
the irade to this effect had been issued. While<br/>
Ismail was reading this decree at Abdin Palace,<br/>
the son was reading the other message at his country-seat a few miles out of Cairo, to the effect that<br/>
"his Imperial Majesty the Sultan has named you<br/>
by imperial irade Khedive of Egypt, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">firman </span>will be delivered to you with the customary<br/>
ceremonial. Convoke the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ulema </span>and functionaries, the chief men of the country, and the government employees, and communicate to them<br/>
the stipulations of the decree relative to your succession, and at once relieve his Highness Ismail<br/>
