<br/>
whom it descended to Halim Pasha, his son, but for<br/>
many years has been the subject of acrimonious<br/>
litigation among members of the khedival family,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>place remaining unoccupied since<br/>
Prince Hassan's demise. The umbrageous Shubra<br/>
avenue, two miles in length, connecting Cairo and<br/>
the palace, was beloved by generations of gay<br/>
people, until the oval <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghizereh </span>drive became<br/>
the Rotten Row of the Egyptian capital. From<br/>
that moment the decline of the Shubra drive was<br/>
rapid, until in these days it attracts very few Cairenes. The palace has that look of absenteeism so<br/>
suggestive of lawsuits, and the fine villas lining the<br/>
roadway from Cairo are in great part tenantless as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Standing close to the Nile, with the Pyramids in<br/>
plain view, the palace seems worthy of occupancy.<br/>
Its situation is not rivaled by any other princely<br/>
home in the country, surely; but it is probably<br/>
permanently dismantled. The gardens are still<br/>
magnificent, rich with tropical plants and trees,<br/>
and very extensive. The gem of the place is the<br/>
wonderful kiosk, hidden from sight by groves of<br/>
orange-, sycamore-, and lebbek-trees. It is a curious structure, covering an acre or more, and was<br/>
once resplendent with decorations of the Italian<br/>
Renaissance school. These are now peeling off, the<br/>
silken hangings of the corner rooms almost fall into<br/>
shreds from their own weight, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tortoise-shellinlaid </span>billiard-cues are succumbing to the warping<br/>
hand of time, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fresco-portraits </span>of Mehemet<br/>
Ali and Ibrahim are almost unrecognizable.<br/>
