<br/>
tenets of the Koran as with other things, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">delighted </span>to jeer at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">strictness </span>with which Tewfik<br/>
discharged his religious duties, telling him he should<br/>
adopt European modes of thinking and living.<br/>
"When you come to the throne, pretend to be a<br/>
good Mussulman, like me; it is good policy, and<br/>
the people will like you for it," was the father's<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flippant </span>advice. When <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik</span>, on the day he took<br/>
upon himself the <span style="color: #0000FF;">responsibilities </span>of the khedivate,<br/>
went in state to the mosque and prayed with the<br/>
faithful, Ismail is reported to have remarked: <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">You</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>are acting the Moslem very well." The son replied:<br/>
"Yes, sire; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>I am truly <span style="color: #0000FF;">sincere</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>Tewfik came to the khedivate when it had been<br/>
shorn of three fourths of its power; and anxious as<br/>
he was to use his prerogative for the best interests<br/>
of his people, the new khedive found himself nearly<br/>
as helpless as Gulliver bound hand, foot, and body<br/>
by the Lilliputians. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>forceful enough<br/>
to remove Ismail had likewise been <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>potent to establish the dual control, by <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>England<br/>
and France had taken <span style="color: #0000FF;">possession </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finances</span>.<br/>
In no country in the world is everything more<br/>
vitally dependent on the Finance <span style="color: #0000FF;">Office </span>than in<br/>
Egypt. The ministry of finance is the mainspring<br/>
of the executive machinery, the fountainhead of<br/>
everything, without Which nothing can be done.<br/>
The ministry of public works devises schemes of<br/>
irrigation certain to make the soil profitable to<br/>
agriculture; but the Finance <span style="color: #ff0000;">Offiee </span>provides the<br/>
money with which they may be carried into effect.<br/>
Tewfik might complain, but he could not drive<br/>
