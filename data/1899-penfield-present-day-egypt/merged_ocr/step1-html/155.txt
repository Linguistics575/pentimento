<span>Paradoxical Administration<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the spirit of internationalism dominates<br/>
the Daira Sanieh, the State Domains, and other<br/>
divisions of the government, aggregating a mighty<br/>
draft on the exchequer. But the customs and <span style="color: #ff0000;">postoffiee </span>departments, <span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a single head, are<br/>
models of perfection. The postal service, managed<br/>
by Saba Pasha, seems to be faultless.<br/>
<br/>
The purchasing power, held to be indicative of a<br/>
nation's pecuniary condition, has advanced with<br/>
other statistics dealing with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span>'s welfare.<br/>
In 1882 the imports were valued at $ 32,127,650; in<br/>
1890, $ 40,409,635, and in 1896, $ <span style="color: #0000FF;">45,750,000</span>. Exports<br/>
for the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">years-cotton</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton-seed</span>, sugar, and<br/>
grain-were valued at $ 54,977,850, $ 59,373,490, and<br/>
$ 66,000,000, respectively. More than half of the<br/>
foreign commerce is with Great Britain. The cotton crop, wholly exported, produces in the neighborhood of $ 50,000,000 a year. Of this the United<br/>
States buys about $ 4,000,000 worth. The tonnage<br/>
arrivals at the port of Alexandria have nearly<br/>
doubled since 1882, and in a normal year are<br/>
slightly in excess of two million tons. The port<br/>
receipts are as high as $ 7,000,000 in a year.<br/>
<br/>
To carry on the government requires about $ 53, 000,000 a year. It used to be more in the free-andeasy times when <span style="color: #0000FF;">budget-making </span>was the <span style="color: #ff0000;">merest<br/>
</span>guesswork, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">deficiencies </span>could be explained in<br/>
the convenient phrase, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">insufficiency </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">receipts</span>."<br/>
The heaviest outlay is for interest on the bonded<br/>
indebtedness, $ 18,850,000; while the annual tribute<br/>
to the Sultan (signed away by that monarch to<br/>
European bankers) consumes $ 3,365,200 more.<br/>
