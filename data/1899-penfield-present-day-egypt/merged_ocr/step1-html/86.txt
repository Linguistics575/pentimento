ever the spirit moves them, although at fixed hours<br/>
all pray in unison, with heads invariably turned<br/>
toward <span style="color: #0000FF;">tho </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Kibla," the niche in the largest <span style="color: #0000FF;">assembly-room</span>, indicating the direction of Mecca.<br/>

A thousand or two youths actually live within<br/>
the walls of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Azhar</span>. They partake of their<br/>
simple meals when the spirit moves them. Their<br/>
food is exceedingly plain and inexpensive. A<br/>
bowl of lentil soup, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>loaf or cake of bread,<br/>
and a handful of garlic or perhaps dates, are enough<br/>
to attract a group of <span style="color: #0000FF;">school-fellows</span>, over <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>they discuss affairs and joke as youths do elsewhere.<br/>
To needy students nine hundred loaves of bread<br/>
are distributed each day.<br/>
<br/>
The great quadrangle presents a picture to be<br/>
rivaled nowhere in the world. Singly and in<br/>
groups, students sit on their skin rugs, earnestly<br/>
toiling over lessons. No matter how scorching the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>rays, if the impulse seizes them they stretch at<br/>
full length on the pavement, enveloped in their<br/>
long outer garments, and tranquilly sleep. Pupils<br/>
and professors step over and around them, always<br/>
respecting their slumber. Cats without number,<br/>
that seem to belong to the place, hobnob with the<br/>
boys upon terms of perfect harmony; but dogs,<br/>
being "<span style="color: #0000FF;">unclean</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koranie </span>teaching, are never<br/>
permitted by the doorkeepers to enter the sacred<br/>
precinct. Sellers of bread and water pass freely<br/>
among the studying thousands, always careful not<br/>
to disturb sleepers, and here and there students<br/>
may be seen mending their garments, perhaps<br/>
washing and drying them in the sun.<br/>
