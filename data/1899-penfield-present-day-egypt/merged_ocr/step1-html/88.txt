<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
of the several religious feasts there are holidays,<br/>
amounting in the aggregate to the long summer<br/>
vacation so dear to the western-world boy. <span style="color: #ff0000;">E1Azhar </span>students are up with the sun for the first<br/>
prayer of the day<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>By midday their work in the<br/>
university is finished. Apparently Azhar youths<br/>
have few amusements or recreations. Base-ball,<br/>
foot-ball, cane-rushes, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">boat-racing </span>have yet<br/>
to be brought to their consideration. They have,<br/>
of course, their diversions, but what they may be<br/>
is a mystery to the onlooker. A singular tradition<br/>
associated with this renowned seat of learning is<br/>
that, although practically without roof, no bird,<br/>
not even the inquisitive sparrow, ever ventures<br/>
within.<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptian Museum, still in its youth as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>national institution, contains a unique collection<br/>
of antiquities, ranking with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">world</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>important<br/>
treasures. It was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mavietto</span>'s marvelous energy and<br/>
persistence that awakened Egyptians to the propriety of preserving the souvenirs of their great<br/>
ancestors. His efforts first bore fruit in the museum at Bulak, and the promulgation of a decree<br/>
establishing governmental control of antiquities.<br/>
Up to that time Egypt had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">prolific </span>ground<br/>
for European museums, and for half a century<br/>
scarcely a vessel sailed from Alexandria that carried<br/>
nothing for the British Museum <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Louvre.<br/>
The Rosetta Stone, even, revealing the secret of<br/>
the hieroglyphs of the ancient Egyptians, that had<br/>
been forgotten for fourteen centuries, was allowed<br/>
to be removed from the country where it <span style="color: #ff0000;">unques<br/>
