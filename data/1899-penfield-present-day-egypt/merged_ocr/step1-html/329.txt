of that phase of its national character. Russia has<br/>
within a few months, in further development of its<br/>
expansion proclivities, secured a port on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Persian </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">h1lf </span>,--<span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>is, one that borders on the Indian<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Oeean </span>,--and, what is vitally important, has come to<br/>
an agreement with England regarding their <span style="color: #0000FF;">respective </span>aspirations in China. The aim of this agreement is to put an end to the battle for concessions,<br/>
railway and other, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>raged acrimoniously for<br/>
two years. The Russian object is to avoid a <span style="color: #0000FF;">conflict </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>would interfere with the successful exploitation of the transcontinental railway, on which<br/>
she has spent an enormous sum, and also to get<br/>
funds from Great Britain when needed for the development of industries at home.<br/>
<br/>
Russia's desire to avoid British opposition may<br/>
be taken to mean that the Northern Bear will be<br/>
slow to direct its gaze toward Egypt in a menacing<br/>
manner. Two centuries ago Russia had but a single sea-outlet, the Gulf of Finland. Later she secured control of the eastern Baltic and obtained a<br/>
free course to the North Atlantic. Once more she<br/>
reached out and gained an outlet into the Mediterranean through the Black Sea. Again she reached<br/>
out for the eastern Asiatic trade and attained that<br/>
object, and a few months ago she acquired a port<br/>
on the Indian Ocean and came to an understanding<br/>
with John Bull respecting Chinese matters; and<br/>
this can have no other meaning than "hands off"<br/>
in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
England has certainly so interwoven the destinies<br/>
of the country of the Nile with her own that evacu<br/>
