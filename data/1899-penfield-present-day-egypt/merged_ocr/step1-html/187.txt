terranean. Thus Middle Egypt and the Delta will<br/>
secure more or less perennial irrigation.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile, the only river of Egypt, has a length<br/>
of 4062 miles, and is thus exceeded only by the<br/>
Mississippi, having a length of 4112 miles. At<br/>
Cairo the river is eleven hundred yards in breadth.<br/>
After the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoMuenee </span>of the Blue and White Niles<br/>
at Khartum, it receives but one tributary, the<br/>
Atbara. In Egypt proper the great river has no<br/>
affluent and is contributed to in no way. The<br/>
most important of the outlets of the Nile is J oseph's<br/>
Canal (the Bahr Youssef), that leaves the river<br/>
near Girgeh, and for two hundred and twenty miles<br/>
follows along the foot of the Libyan chain of hills,<br/>
finally entering the Fayum and fertilizing this<br/>
fruitful oasis, its own creation, in numerous ramifications. In the Delta the most important canal is<br/>
the Mahmudiyeh, built by Mehemet Ali in 1823. It<br/>
connects the Rosetta arm with the harbor of Alexandria.<br/>
<br/>
At Assuan the Nile is three hundred and thirty<br/>
feet above the level of the Mediterranean. From<br/>
Assuan to Cairo the fall is a trifle under five inches<br/>
in the mile, and from Cairo to the sea the fall averages nearly an inch to the mile.<br/>
<br/>
To equalize the distribution of the Nile water<br/>
among cultivators, the whole country devoted to<br/>
agriculture is divided by low earthwork dams into<br/>
large fields, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the water is conducted by<br/>
canals. Lands that cannot be reached by the overflow of the canals have to be mechanically irrigated.<br/>
To do this the small proprietor lifts the water from<br/>
