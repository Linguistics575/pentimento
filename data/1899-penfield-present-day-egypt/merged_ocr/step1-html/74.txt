<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
transplanted granite of Assuan is yielding to the<br/>
ravages of climate, would return to the country of<br/>
the Pharaohs one of the priceless monuments of<br/>
which it has been deprived!<br/>
<br/>
No picture of Cairo that does not include the<br/>
soldier can be considered complete, for the military<br/>
aspect of the city is in almost aggressive evidence.<br/>
When there is no campaign calling the troops to<br/>
the Sudan, from six to nine thousand men are<br/>
quartered in the capital. Nile palaces, khedival<br/>
apartments in the citadel, and straggling pink barracks at Abbassieh, shelter English regiments;<br/>
while tucked in everywhere, even extending miles<br/>
out of Cairo to the canvas city on the desert road<br/>
to Suez, are Egyptian soldiers of all degrees of<br/>
color and of every class. And what a variety of<br/>
costumes! There are Arab lancers in uniforms<br/>
of light blue, almost esthetic in shade; members of<br/>
the camel corps and Sudanese infantry regiments<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">blackest </span>of black men, <span style="color: #0000FF;">wearing </span>kaki costumes<br/>
of the color of the desert; and men of other arms of<br/>
the military establishment, in the smartest of white<br/>
clothes.<br/>
<br/>
By company or regiment, soldiers are so frequently marched through the streets that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">visitor </span>might believe Cairo to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>vast military camp.<br/>
Martial music is the adjunct of every function and<br/>
every anniversary, religious and festive. Drum<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fife </span>corps, <span style="color: #0000FF;">full </span>military bands, some of them<br/>
mounted, parade daily, playing frequently the<br/>
beautiful khedival hymn. It is a part of the<br/>
scheme of administration to keep the soldier in evi<br/>
