<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Juvenile </span>pupils are taught little but the Koran.<br/>
Day after day their masters beat it into them, not<br/>
infrequently aided by a palm-branch, the Oriental<br/>
equivalent of the birch. The youngsters sway back<br/>
and forth and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sidewise </span>in concert when reciting.<br/>
The sheik, perhaps, knows less about the printed<br/>
page than the boys, but to him the Koran is so<br/>
familiar that he is able to detect the slightest error<br/>
of his class. On his part "reading<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>is a feat of<br/>
memory, and should a professor of higher grade<br/>
refer him to the book, he would most likely claim<br/>
to be suffering from weak eyes, and request a student-teacher to read for him. The urchins are as<br/>
industrious as beavers. When far enough advanced<br/>
to write, favorite quotations from the Koran, such<br/>
as, "There is no God but God, and Mohammed is<br/>
his prophet," and "<span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>testify that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>is<br/>
God's apostle," are given them for exercises.<br/>
<br/>
An Azhar student is always under the supervision of the school authority. In roaming about<br/>
the streets of Cairo, should he misbehave, the police<br/>
could only detain him until an official be <span style="color: #0000FF;">summoned </span>from <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Azhar </span>to take him into custody.<br/>
This system of proctorship is in fact the same as<br/>
at the English universities of Oxford and Cambridge. Because an Azhar scholar has immunity<br/>
from military service, it is suspected that many<br/>
young men are enrolled as students for no other<br/>
purpose than to escape the life of a soldier-to<br/>
most Mohammedans an undesirable calling.<br/>

In the school year there is no definite recess; but<br/>
during the month of Ramadan and on the occasion<br/>
