<span>In Egypt for Health's Sake<br/>

moved from the river-banks, as offered by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tourist-boats</span>, the post-steamers are quicker and<br/>
much less expensive. In either case, the traveler<br/>
is seldom <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>of telegraphic touch with the world<br/>
for more than a few hours at a time.<br/>
<br/>
Sanitary skill has liberated Egypt from the list<br/>
of eastern countries where epidemics may rage uncontrolled, and there is no more important item<br/>
of benefit through British intervention than the<br/>
introduction of measures which quickly suppress<br/>
or limit outbreaks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cholera </span>and fevers. A visitation of cholera a generation ago ran riot for many<br/>
months and decimated the population of Egyptian<br/>
cities and towns. Dreadful as it must ever be,<br/>
cholera nowadays is so promptly and intelligently<br/>
dealt with that well-conditioned people run little<br/>
risk of contracting the malady. The last serious<br/>
appearance of this disease in 1896, although requiring months to exterminate, was so <span style="color: #ff0000;">skilfully<br/>
</span>handled that the mortality was kept at an unheard-of low figure; and had it not been for the<br/>
sensational chroniclings of the press of Europe but<br/>
few persons dwelling in the European quarters of<br/>
Cairo and Alexandria would have suffered anxiety.<br/>
Travelers on the Nile were no more in danger than<br/>
if making a tour of the fiords of Norway. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">international </span>quarantine board in Egypt keeps a<br/>
vigilant watch of Asiatic epidemics, and apprehends<br/>
the spread of avirulent disease usually long before<br/>
it has reached Suez in its western progress. Were<br/>
it not for the timely work of the international<br/>
board, whose labors were augmented by those of<br/>
