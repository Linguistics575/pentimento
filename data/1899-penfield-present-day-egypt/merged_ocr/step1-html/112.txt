nearly a million bales in a season, and from this <span style="color: #0000FF;">incident </span>sprang the nation's principal industry. When<br/>
civil war raged in the United States, and English<br/>
mills were compelled to find fiber elsewhere for their<br/>
looms, Egyptian cotton sold at a dollar a pound.<br/>
In two years Alexandria waxed rich in consequence, and its wealth found expression in streets<br/>
of Italianate business buildings and residences.<br/>
Those that were smashed to atoms by the British<br/>
bombardment in 1882 were <span style="color: #ff0000;">replaced</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">by2arger </span>and<br/>

the fanatical, degraded <span style="color: #ff0000;">m1ffians </span>at the outset of<br/>
their orgy of blood.<br/>

Apart from the splendid monolith <span style="color: #0000FF;">miscalled<br/>
</span>Pompey's Pillar, and the catacombs, dating from<br/>
the time of Constantine, of which there are remains<br/>
of rare architectural symmetry, nothing exists in<br/>
Alexandria to reward the search of the traveler<br/>
with a fondness for antiquities. The pillar, erected<br/>
in honor of Diocletian, and having nothing to do<br/>
