artistic beauty of the island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to be slightly<br/>
impaired, if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
It is appropriate here to quote from a book written more than thirty-five years ago by Sir Samuel<br/>
Baker. After descending the great river from<br/>
source to mouth, he wrote: <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>The Nile might be so<br/>
controlled that the enormous volume of water that<br/>
now rushes uselessly into the Mediterranean might<br/>
be led through the deserts to transform them into<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eotton-fields </span>that would render England independent of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen'ca</span>."<br/>
<br/>
The Delta of the Nile is now a great cotton-field,<br/>
and cultivation of the fiber has doubled since England took Egypt in hand. As rapidly as science<br/>
adds area to the Delta, the soil thus rescued from<br/>
the desert is usually planted with cotton. An <span style="color: #0000FF;">average </span>year's crop is now equal to one million one<br/>
hundred thousand bales of five hundred pounds<br/>
each, and all this is sold in foreign markets at a<br/>
price two cents per pound in excess of quotations<br/>
for good American upland cotton. It is its fiber,<br/>
nearly an inch and a half long, that gives <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian<br/>
</span>cotton its peculiar value. Great as the price is, this<br/>
is not the only advantage possessed by the fellah<br/>
cotton-grower over the planter of our Southern<br/>
States; for the magical fecundity of the Nile soil<br/>
permits the harvesting of a crop averaging five<br/>
hundredweight to the acre. This is twice what<br/>
American planters get from an acre, and the Nilot<br/>
is exempt from certain disastrous elements ever<br/>
menacing his American rival. The Egyptian has<br/>
no dread of frost, and no labor question to deal with.<br/>
