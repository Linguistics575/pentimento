<span>Story of the Suez Canal<br/>

luck that had given them another Oriental, who<br/>
likewise loved Frenchmen, to fatten on. At their<br/>
first interview with Ismail Pasha they made a point<br/>
of their own generosity, assuring him that as one<br/>
of the fresh-water canals appeared to them to be<br/>
needless, they would surrender the special concession under <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>it was to have been constructed,<br/>
on condition that the new Viceroy would agree to<br/>
complete the other minor canal at his own <span style="color: #0000FF;">cost-but </span>for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eompany</span>'s benefit. These suave tricksters certainly had formed a strange estimate of the<br/>
character of the new ruler; and Ismail must have<br/>
recognized the colossal impudence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">company's<br/>
</span>request, surely. Bad he investigated, he, too, would<br/>
have learned that the small canal in question could<br/>
not possibly be constructed because of legal complications and rights of jurisdiction. But, not<br/>

enterprise recognized in Ismail a valued "friend,"<br/>
and to their minds an essential problem in connection with their work had been solved. Ismail<br/>
now called himself <span style="color: #0000FF;">khedive</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>and was negotiating<br/>

based on the law of <span style="color: #0000FF;">primogeniture</span>; and in 1867 he was raised to the<br/>
rank of khedive. In 1873 Khedive Ismail obtained a new <span style="color: #0000FF;">firman</span>,<br/>
