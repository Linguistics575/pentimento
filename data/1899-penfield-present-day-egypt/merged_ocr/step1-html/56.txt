extent, and men and women of high degree <span style="color: #0000FF;">wear<br/>
</span>rings of silver wire to protect them from the evil<br/>
eye. Cairo would be a rich field for the exercise<br/>
of a little practical philanthropy based on the<br/>
employment of soap, water, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">scrubbing-brush</span>;<br/>
but it would come into <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonf1iet </span>with the religion,<br/>
which makes of the blind man a person to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>revered, and affords him an almost priestly occupation.<br/>
<br/>
Strange to relate, Cairo is being adorned with<br/>
statues, like cities in the Christian world. In his<br/>
determination to make his capital a triumph of<br/>
artistic beauty, Ismail courageously ordered a<br/>
French sculptor, thirty years or more ago, to model<br/>
a few figures of Egyptian military worthies. The<br/>
faithful in Alexandria had permitted a <span style="color: #ff0000;">eolossal<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">offigy </span>in bronze of Mehemet Ali to be raised in the<br/>
public square, although a tenet of the Koran was<br/>
violated thereby. Another statue, perpetuating the<br/>
military <span style="color: #0000FF;">exploits </span>of the second Viceroy of Egypt,<br/>
Ibrahim Pasha, had been erected in the Place of<br/>
the Opera in Cairo, without provoking an outbreak<br/>
among strict followers of the Koran. The bronze<br/>
lions guarding the Nile bridge were likewise <span style="color: #0000FF;">accepted </span>without protest. Ismail believed it would<br/>
awaken the martial spirit of his subjects if every<br/>
public square in Cairo could have its bronze presentment of a departed hero or notable; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span>it<br/>
amused him to turn the old city of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">califs </span>into<br/>
a statuary gallery, who was to say <span style="color: #0000FF;">nay</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>I suspect<br/>
that Ismail must have seen the artistic side of the<br/>
sculptured sentiment of the Campo Santo in Genoa.<br/>
