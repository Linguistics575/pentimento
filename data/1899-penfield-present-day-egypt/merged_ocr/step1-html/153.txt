<span>Paradoxical Administration<br/>
<br/>
masses and the upper class is wide, the desire for<br/>
petty <span style="color: #0000FF;">office-holding </span>is one of the crying evils of<br/>
Egypt. It is estimated that two per cent. of the<br/>
able-bodied men serve the government in some<br/>
capacity, and to secure public employ is the dream<br/>
of nearly every youth not satisfied to become a<br/>
farmer. Nepotism formerly had full play, and it is<br/>
now <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to make the people understand that<br/>
merit and capacity should place one in the public<br/>
service, rather than favor. Ministries and public<br/>
offices appear to be overcrowded with subordinates<br/>
of every conceivable nationality. The responsible<br/>
heads of departments are generally English, but the<br/>
clerks are French, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Italian</span>, Syrian, and Egyptian,<br/>
with a liberal <span style="color: #0000FF;">sprinkling </span>of British subjects. Functionaries of the Egyptian government are surprisingly overpaid or underpaid, their salaries being<br/>
strangely out of proportion. Cabinet <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>are<br/>
paid fifteen thousand dollars a year, and undersecretaries seventy-five hundred <span style="color: #ff0000;">dollars-twiee<br/>
</span>what Washington <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>of the same grade receive.<br/>
But many of the hardest-worked accountants and<br/>
translators are rewarded with salaries barely sufficient to provide the necessaries of life. The departments and bureaus of the government are open<br/>
only in the forenoon, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>day's work<br/>
never exceeds five hours, and nearly every week<br/>
has a religious or other anniversary that is treated<br/>
as a holiday. In that halcyon period known as<br/>
"the good old days <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>there were more civil servants<br/>
in Egypt than in Great Britain, with five times the<br/>
population. Many abuses have been abolished, but<br/>
