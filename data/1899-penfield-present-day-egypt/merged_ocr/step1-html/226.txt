that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">retrocession </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">company</span>'s rights in<br/>
the small fresh-water canal deprived them of<br/>
large prospective profits through the renting of<br/>
lands and providing irrigation therefor. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eompany</span>'s bookkeeper ingeniously figured expenditures of seven and a half million francs up to<br/>
the time the concession was resigned, which, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
</span>interest, made a round ten million francs. Napoleon further gave his countrymen six million francs<br/>
for the supposititious loss of water-tolls, and thirty<br/>
million more for the assumed value of the lands that<br/>
would have been rendered productive by the sweetwater canal, had it been made. This canal, it will<br/>
be remembered, was not proceeded with because<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">coneessionaries </span>requested Ismail to take back<br/>
the authorization for its construction; yet Emperor<br/>
Napoleon compelled the khedive to pay forty-six<br/>
million francs for allowing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">concession </span>to be<br/>
canceled.<br/>
<br/>
The entire award footed up eighty-four million<br/>
francs, and so successful was the canal ring in this<br/>
essay at <span style="color: #0000FF;">financiering </span>that some of its members<br/>
grumbled because more items had not been ineluded in the schedule of claims laid before the<br/>
emperor for adjudication. They had actually forgotten to make a demand for the "value of the<br/>
fish" in the canal that was never built. A supplementary bill was sent to Ismail, consequently; and<br/>
when he demurred, arbitration was again suggested. Be had taken his medicine without <span style="color: #ff0000;">fr1nelr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
