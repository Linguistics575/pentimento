It is not the native population that deplores the<br/>
disappearance of the antique and the picturesque,<br/>
for the modern Egyptian has no appreciation for<br/>
the ancient or his works. To his feelings the magnitude of the Pyramids and the mystery of the<br/>
Sphinx make no appeal. The only value of the<br/>
priceless antiquities of the Nile valley to the fellah<br/>
or Bedouin is to bring in piasters. The ruthless<br/>
hands that stripped the pyramid of Cheops of its<br/>
outer <span style="color: #0000FF;">easing </span>to deck a mosque in Cairo would not<br/>
spare Karnak or Philae. After all, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philas</span>'s remains,<br/>
noble as they are, appear comparatively young beside many of the monuments of this hoary land.<br/>

Standing without meaning upon a wide stretch<br/>

character, and can no longer be the stately sentinel<br/>
guarding the natural boundary between Nubia and<br/>
Egypt. The artist's dahabiyeh, drawn well up on<br/>
the strand beneath Pharaoh's Bed, can never again<br/>
give a touch of color to the scene. Nor can the<br/>
patriarchal sheik of the cataract load his clumsy<br/>
boats at the point of the island with tourists sufficiently courageous to "shoot the rapids" on the<br/>
