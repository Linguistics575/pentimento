streams of unusual grandeur during the period of<br/>
Abyssinian rains, from the middle of June until<br/>
September, are reduced to <span style="color: #ff0000;">insia1ifieanee </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">during<br/>
</span>the dry months. Then, the water-supply from<br/>
Abyssinia having ceased, Egypt is forced to depend<br/>
solely upon the equatorial lakes and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">affluents<br/>
</span>of the White Nile until the rainy season shall have<br/>
again flooded the two great Abyssinian arteries.<br/>
That flood occurs about the 20th of <span style="color: #0000FF;">June</span>, and the<br/>
rush of water pouring down the Blue Nile and the<br/>
Atbara into the main channel inundates Egypt, and<br/>
is the cause of its magical fertility. Not only is<br/>
the inundation the effect of the Abyssinian rains,<br/>
but the deposit of mud that has formed the Delta,<br/>
and which is annually precipitated by the rising<br/>
waters, is also due to the Abyssinian streams,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>to the Atbara, which carries a larger proportion of soil than any other tributary of the<br/>
Nile. Therefore to the Atbara, -spanned by an<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">American-built </span>railroad-bridge, by the way ,--above<br/>
all other rivers, must the wealth and fertility of<br/>
Egypt be attributed. In writing of his Nile explorations, Baker employed this happy description:<br/>
"The equatorial lakes <span style="color: #0000FF;">feed </span>Egypt, but the Abyssinian rivers cause the inundation."<br/>
<br/>
There is a fascination in the unchangeable features of the Nile region. There are the Pyramids<br/>
and Sphinx that have defied time; the sandy deserts through which Moses led his people, and the<br/>
watering-places where their flocks were led to<br/>
drink. There is no change in these; and the poor<br/>
people who dwell in Nubia and Upper Egypt on the<br/>
