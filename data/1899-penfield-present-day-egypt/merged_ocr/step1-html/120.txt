and that her complexion <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>as fair as that of any<br/>
Athenian belle to-day. The erudite Greek gets out<br/>
his <span style="color: #ff0000;">Plutareh</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>best-known historian coeval with<br/>
Cleopatra, and who must have seen her or talked<br/>
with those knowing <span style="color: #0000FF;">her-and </span>points to chapters<br/>
leaving as little doubt of the purity of her Greek<br/>
blood as of her charm of person and conversation.<br/>
<br/>
The Denderah sculptures when analyzed, the<br/>
erudite champion maintains with every show of<br/>
reason, portray a face whose outline and characteristics are unmistakably Greek. Were the temple<br/>
of Denderah not situated near the Nubian frontier,<br/>
no logical examiner could ever have found a suggestion in the portraits that the queen was negroid.<br/>
The shape of the nose proves to the contrary, and<br/>
the bust of Cleopatra in the Capitol at Rome supports the assertion. Furthermore, the Egyptian<br/>
sculptors did not attempt to idealize. They sculptured with honest fidelity the faces they saw. In<br/>
these up-Nile portraits the consummate mistress<br/>
of the art of fascination wears a winning smile, but<br/>
the figure of the queen is distorted.<br/>
<br/>
Painters, poets, novelists, writers of dramas,<br/>
and actresses seem ever to have had in mind the<br/>
idea that Cleopatra was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-caste</span>, in whom the<br/>
charms of Europe and Africa were combined, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">woman </span>who ruled the world with the intellect of a<br/>
thinker directing the arts of an odalisk. It requires<br/>
little investigation, on the contrary, to learn that<br/>
the great queen was, as her name suggests, a Greek<br/>
of the Greeks, of pure and illustrious descent, and<br/>
not an African. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Géréme</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Picou</span>, Alma-Tadema,<br/>
