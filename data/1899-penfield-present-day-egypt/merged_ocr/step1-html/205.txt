and the same hypothesis regarding agricultural<br/>
development in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dongola </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">neighboring </span>provinces, by <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they are to feed the entire country,<br/>
likewise gives over to <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar-growing </span>the Nile valley from Beni Suef to Assuan. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cane-culture </span>has<br/>
been developed there with amazing rapidity. As<br/>
with cotton, Egyptian sugar is of superior quality.<br/>
It now brings nearly ten million dollars per year to<br/>
Egypt, and it may surprise American readers to be<br/>
told that the United States has for some time been<br/>
a liberal buyer of Nile-grown sugar.<br/>
<br/>
At many points between Assiut and Assuan<br/>
important <span style="color: #0000FF;">crushing-works </span>have recently been<br/>
erected by native or foreign capital, supplied with<br/>
the most perfect machinery obtainable in Europe.<br/>
The peasant farmer in Upper Egypt has, by means<br/>
of enhanced irrigation, become a capitalist in a<br/>
small way through the sugar crop, and the cane<br/>
area will be doubled, if not trebled, in a very few<br/>
years, and statisticians must hereafter take the<br/>
Egyptian crop into account when dealing with the<br/>
world's production.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, Lower Egypt is destined to be devoted to<br/>
cotton, Middle and Upper Egypt to sugar, while the<br/>
provinces south of the first cataract will produce<br/>
more than enough cereals to feed Egypt's population. All this is feasible and quickly accomplished,<br/>
and no doubt has a place in England's elaborate<br/>
scheme <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>exploiting the valley of the Nile.<br/>
