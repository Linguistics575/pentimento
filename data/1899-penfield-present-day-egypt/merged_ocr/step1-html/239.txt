<span>Story of the Suez Canal<br/>
<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>lighthouses <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>maintained. Of course<br/>
this is conjecture, pure and simple. Many things<br/>
can happen in the space of seventy years, and<br/>
before 1968 conditions may prevail that no one<br/>
now foresees. The Suez Canal will doubtless be as<br/>
useful then as now, but the term "Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">government </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>may have a meaning foreign to that expressed by the words of the concession under which<br/>
the canal was made. There is little prospect that<br/>
this most important artery of marine travel will<br/>
ever bring substantial benefit to the Egyptian<br/>
people. Yielding an income in these times of sixteen million dollars a year, the Egyptians would be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">receiving </span>two million four hundred thousand dollars annually from the stipulation of the concession<br/>
giving them fifteen per cent. of the gross revenue,<br/>
had not Ismail thrown away their rights in his<br/>
mad <span style="color: #0000FF;">craving </span>for money.<br/>
<br/>
When United States capital and skill join the<br/>
Atlantic with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Paeifie</span>, let the canal be our<br/>
own, under whatever guaranties of its neutrality<br/>
in time of war<span style="color: #ff0000;">!<br/>
