committed wasteful extravagance, and only a few<br/>
hours before his final departure from Cairo pleaded<br/>
guilty to but one piece of lavish expenditure-that<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>sum devoted to the Suez Canal <span style="color: #ff0000;">f√©tes</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Ismail did not leave his country empty-handed.<br/>
Though he had hoped to remain in power, yet he<br/>
was prepared for an adverse decision at Constantinople before the receipt of the fateful telegram.<br/>
He caused portable articles of value in his many<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">pa1aees</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>they were veritable <span style="color: #ff0000;">treasurohousesto </span>be prepared for shipment, and it was estimated<br/>
that these belongings <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>worth millions of dollars. The women of the harem were compelled to<br/>
hand over their jewelry, and thus he obtained a<br/>
quantity of property easily convertible into cash.<br/>
Seventy of the harem women were selected to<br/>
accompany the exile. Those to be left behind did<br/>
not relish the situation, and they are said to have<br/>
shown their displeasure by smashing mirrors and<br/>
articles of a fragile nature, as only a thousand angry women could. Ismail's reign had been an orgy<br/>
of despotic plunder, so to speak, and when he had<br/>
no throne to sit upon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>palaces to occupy as master, he appropriated and carried off as much of the<br/>
khedival property as the time and facilities at his<br/>
command permitted. A long baggage-train was<br/>
packed with pictures and cabinets, dinner-services<br/>
and rare carpets, bronzes and silver candelabra,<br/>
and plate of solid gold, much of it inlaid with<br/>
jewels. At Alexandria everything was hurried on<br/>
board the yacht Mahroussa, a steamer as big as an<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Atlantic </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iliner</span>. Ismail followed in a special train,<br/>
