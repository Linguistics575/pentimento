<br/>
The bazaars, however, show no sign of European<br/>
intrusion, and are to-day as Oriental as when Lane<br/>
wrote his "Modern Egyptians." The bazaars of<br/>
Damascus, possibly, are more correctly Eastern,<br/>
but not so those of Constantinople and Smyrna.<br/>
John Bull invades the bazaars of Cairo only as a<br/>
sight-seer and purchaser, wearing sun-helmet and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">pugree</span>, however chilling the wintry weather. He<br/>
usually thinks the prices dear, and parts with his<br/>
coins only after hours of dickering, and does not<br/>
forget his bakshish. The bazaars are the only<br/>
places in Egypt where the tourist receives <span style="color: #0000FF;">bakshish</span>. Elsewhere he gives it, or could give it,<br/>
every minute of the day. Americans, on the other<br/>
hand, regard the prices as cheap, and buy, buy,<br/>

This hospitality <span style="color: #ff0000;">partaken </span>of, they buy more embroidered jackets, gauze scarfs, and inlaid weapons. Both British and American pay more than<br/>
the things are worth, of course; but the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Transatlantic </span>purchaser has a balance of time to his<br/>
credit.<br/>
<br/>
It is novel to buy silk fabrics by weight rather<br/>
than by measurement. The slipper bazaar, with the<br/>
sun shut out by projecting lattices and awnings, is<br/>
a subdued blend of red and yellow. Black leather<br/>
is seldom seen there. The crude art of the brassworkers' lane, where serious-faced youths embellish<br/>
finger-basins and coffee-trays with designs conceived by their forefathers when perspective was<br/>
not valued, is popular. The carpet and rug bazaar<br/>
