<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
the feet are seldom lifted from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">floor </span>can be<br/>
termed "dancing" only by courtesy; but as an<br/>
illustration of what the muscles of the body may<br/>
be trained to do, the danse du <span style="color: #ff0000;">ventre </span>is in a way remarkable. The (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Thanstzi</span>, bred from childhood to<br/>
their calling, are deemed essential at every form<br/>
of Egyptian merrymaking, prince and fellah alike<br/>
employing them. These women form a <span style="color: #0000FF;">class</span>, with<br/>
headquarters at Keneh in Upper Egypt, and by<br/>
thirty have generally managed to wiggle themselves into a competency. They are not necessarily immoral, but are not respected, the habitual<br/>
exposure of the face, if nothing more, placing them<br/>
beyond the pale.<br/>

Ophthalmia is the curse of the native in Cairo.<br/>
Of six people of the poorer class perhaps only two<br/>
will have fair sight; and of the rest, one will be<br/>
blind, one can see from but one eye, and two will<br/>
have otherwise defective vision. Few Egyptians<br/>
have perfect eyesight, and the superstitious dread<br/>
of falling under the baneful <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the "evil<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eye</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>is responsible for this condition. Poor children go for years practically unwashed, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">parent-s</span>' theory being that if their children are made<br/>
attractive they are almost certain to be stricken by<br/>
the evil eye. Their unclean faces attract hordes<br/>
of insects, never brushed away by their idolizing<br/>
mothers, for that would be unlucky. <span style="color: #0000FF;">During </span>the<br/>
summer months <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">children</span>'s eyes are<br/>
almost hidden by <span style="color: #0000FF;">pestiferous </span>flies, and a race of<br/>
people with imperfect vision is the result. Even<br/>
educated Egyptians have the superstition to some<br/>
