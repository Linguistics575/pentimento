<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
For four years I endeavored to be a fair-minded<br/>
student of the character of Abbas Pasha. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">letter </span>of credence that I bore from the President of<br/>
the United States commended me to him as the head<br/>
of the Egyptian government; and throughout my<br/>
residence in the Egyptian capital I <span style="color: #0000FF;">punctiliously<br/>
</span>treated him as my instructions demanded. Study<br/>
my credentials as I would, I could discover no intimation that the khedive was but a nominal <span style="color: #0000FF;">executive</span>, and my documents from Washington made<br/>
no reference to Great Britain as the dominating<br/>
power in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
British functionaries of a rank entitling them to<br/>
come into personal relations with Abbas Pasha<br/>
form a sincere liking for him. But the petty subordinate, seeing him at a distance, or more likely<br/>
not at all, is obstinately wedded to the belief that<br/>
it is his duty as a loyal Briton to utter partizan<br/>
opinion against the nominal head of the government from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>he may be earning his daily<br/>
bread. Americans, on the other hand, invariably<br/>
like Khedive Abbas, and as a people they <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>not<br/>
incapable of forming sound judgments. They see<br/>
him with eyes not blurred with political vapors.<br/>
<br/>
Less than eight years ago Prince Abbas was a<br/>
light-hearted student in Vienna, pursuing a course<br/>
of study at the famous Theresianum fitting him<br/>
for the exalted position some day to be his. The<br/>
Austrian emperor took a kindly interest in the lad<br/>
being educated to rule the oldest nation in the<br/>
world, and means were provided for giving him a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">practicalinsight </span>into the profession of the soldier,<br/>
