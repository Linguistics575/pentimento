<span>Paradoxical Administration<br/>
<br/>
of Appeal as defendants, when failing to meet<br/>
obligations to foreign creditors.<br/>
<br/>
The practice is common for a native having an<br/>
important suit to assign his interest to a foreign<br/>
friend, in order to give the international courts<br/>
jurisdiction of his cause, thus securing intelligent<br/>
and fair consideration. A few years since, when<br/>
some of the powers were dilatory in giving their<br/>
adhesion to the extension of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eourts</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">-for </span>every<br/>
five years there is a formal renewal ,--something<br/>
like a panic occurred among the commercial community.<br/>
<br/>
Courts of first instance are located at Cairo,<br/>
Alexandria, and Mansurah, and the Court of Appeal is at Alexandria. The minimum pecuniary<br/>
limit of appeal is four hundred dollars. Three<br/>
languages are recognized in pleadings and documents, <span style="color: #ff0000;">-Freneh</span>, Italian, and Arabie, <span style="color: #0000FF;">-and </span>it is<br/>
probable that English will shortly be added to the<br/>
list. The foreign counselors of the appellate court,<br/>
nine in number, receive a yearly salary of nine thousand two hundred and fifty dollars each, and their<br/>
four native colleagues half as much. For the three<br/>
lower courts twenty-seven foreign judges are employed, each receiving a salary of seven thousand<br/>
dollars, their fourteen native <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoadjutorsi </span>receiving<br/>
half as much. Five <span style="color: #ff0000;">i11dges-three </span>foreign and two<br/>
native-sit at a time. The United States, like other<br/>
great powers, has one representative in the upper<br/>
and two in the lower courts. While the tribunals<br/>
were not intended to be profit-earners, their receipts<br/>
for years have been considerably in excess of<br/>
