The contractors present what looks like a moderate bill. They are to receive eight hundred thousand dollars a year for thirty years, aggregating<br/>
about twenty-four million dollars. As an incentive<br/>
for them to live up to their agreement, the first<br/>
payment by the Egyptian government is not to be<br/>
made until the work is completed and accepted.<br/>
The credit is a long one, certainly, and its present<br/>
actuarial value cannot be much in excess of ten<br/>
million dollars. The ability of Egypt to make such<br/>
a favorable contract, by <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>she apparently takes<br/>
little risk, and is to pay away each <span style="color: #0000FF;">year </span>only a<br/>
portion of the sum the reservoir brings to her<br/>
exchequer, reflects the enviable position of her<br/>
national credit. The transaction may further be<br/>
taken as an earnest of Great Britain's intention to<br/>
retain indefinitely her grasp <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>the land of the<br/>
Pharaohs. English engineers and surveyors and a<br/>
horde of native laborers have for months been at<br/>
work at Assuan. A single order for three million<br/>
barrels of cement is being filled from Europe.<br/>

For years Sir William Garstin, Mr. Willcocks,<br/>
and other English engineers in the khedival service have strenuously advocated the creation of one<br/>
or more reservoirs that would give perennial irrigation to Egypt. Experts of other nations have<br/>
been called into consultation, and all admitted<br/>
the feasibility of the project, but they <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>not at<br/>
first in accord as to the location of the principal dam.<br/>
