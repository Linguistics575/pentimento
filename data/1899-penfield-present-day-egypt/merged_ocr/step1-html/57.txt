<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>was resolved, at all events, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">erect </span>images of<br/>
distinguished Egyptians all over Cairo, and Frenchmen were employed to make them. Two were delivered before the national exchequer was seized<br/>
with financial cramp and further supplies countermanded. For lack of money, perhaps, or the<br/>
discovery that it was forbidden by the religion of<br/>
Islam to fashion the image of man, the statues were<br/>
given a resting-place in a shed. Two or three years<br/>
ago they were excavated from the dust of a quarter<br/>
of a century, and, under the guidance of British<br/>
engineers, were placed upright on granite pedestals<br/>
in the new quarter of the city; and natives, squatting on their <span style="color: #0000FF;">haunches </span>in the squares thus embellished, find in them a subject for never-ending<br/>
chatter. They have forgotten that Ismail had the<br/>
figures made, and place the responsibility of the<br/>
bronzes at the door of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ingl√©sy</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Had Ismail not lost his throne, and the moneylenders of Europe been content to let him have as<br/>
much cash as he wanted, Cairo would to-day be<br/>
more beautiful. It was his <span style="color: #ff0000;">dreani </span>to make an Eastern Paris of his desert capital. The French metropolis, he argued, could be reproduced, if the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">flnaneial </span>agents of Paris and London did not object.<br/>
A considerable part of the money borrowed was<br/>
spent by Ismail at Gizeh, nearly opposite the spot<br/>
where tradition claims that Moses was found in<br/>
the bulrushes. Gardens like the Tuileries extended<br/>
from the Nile nearly to the edge of the Libyan<br/>
Desert; dozens of lath-and-plaster structures, with<br/>
walls painted in a style suggesting solidity, went<br/>
