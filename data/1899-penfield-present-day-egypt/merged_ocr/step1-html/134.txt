was minister of foreign affairs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>united in a<br/>
report recommending the scheme. This was signed<br/>
by the representatives of the United States, Austria, Germany, England, France, Russia, and Italy.<br/>
At subsequent conventions Belgium, Spain, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Holland</span>, Greece, Portugal, Denmark, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">SwedenNorway </span>approved the plan. On June 28, 1875,<br/>
Khedive Ismail inaugurated the court at Alexandria, although it was not until February <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, 1876,<br/>
that the new system of jurisprudence was actually<br/>
launched.<br/>
<br/>
The procedure is practically that of France, the<br/>
Code <span style="color: #0000FF;">Napoleon</span>, modified to suit the circumstances<br/>
of a country where local customs and religious <span style="color: #0000FF;">obligations </span>must be respected. The jurisdiction is<br/>
stated in this extract from the code itself:<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>The new tribunals shall have cognizance of all<br/>
controversies in matters civil or commercial between natives and foreigners, or between foreigners<br/>
of different nationalities. Apart from questions<br/>
touching the statut personnel [ questions of wills,<br/>
successions, heirship, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">like</span>, which are regulated by the laws of the country of the individual ],<br/>
they shall have cognizance of all questions touching real estate between all persons, even though<br/>
they belong to the same [ foreign ] nationality."<br/>
<br/>
It is of good augury for the national progress that<br/>
the tribunals years ago won the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfidence </span>of both<br/>
natives and foreigners, and that the government<br/>
bows to their authority. Europe needed no better<br/>
proof of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficacy </span>than when Ismail and the<br/>
government itself were brought before the Court<br/>
