never sets. On the other hand, Englishmen say<br/>
with truth that were this instinct non-existent in<br/>
their race, there would to-day be no British empire, and maintain that the world is enriched<br/>
through their achievements as empire-builders. It<br/>
seems to be an impulse <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>of suppression in<br/>
the Anglo-Saxon, wherever his abode.<br/>
<br/>
Since France <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew </span>in 1883 from the dual<br/>
control with England of. the finances of the<br/>
khedival government, Egypt has been in everything but name a dependency of Great Britain,<br/>
the French in the meantime trying to resume their<br/>
share in its administration. More than once they<br/>
have urged the Sultan to interfere and order the<br/>
English from his domain, and for many years<br/>
they have doggedly obstructed Britain's conduct<br/>
of Egyptian affairs, but with little success.<br/>
<br/>
Englishmen deny that there has ever been any<br/>
serious thought of annexing Egypt; that would<br/>
be grossly unjust to the Sultan and his vassal, the<br/>
khedive, they confess, and lead to endless <span style="color: #0000FF;">diplomatic </span>controversy. The occupation was entered<br/>
upon with an <span style="color: #ff0000;">T1t1selfish </span>motive, and was dictated<br/>
by necessity, they say; but temporary expedients<br/>
have the awkward knack of developing into permanent conditions the world over. The routing of<br/>
the khalifa and his dervish mob at Omdurman by<br/>
the Anglo-Egyptian expedition led by Kitchener,<br/>
the hoisting of the flags of Turkey and Great Britain jointly over Khartum, the entering upon a<br/>
scheme for <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile </span>reservoirs that cannot<br/>
be completed <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>years at least, and Cecil<br/>
