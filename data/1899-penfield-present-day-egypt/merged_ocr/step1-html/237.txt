<span>Story of the Suez Canal<br/>
<br/>
bound cargoes-sugar from Singapore and the<br/>
Dutch colonies, and tea from <span style="color: #0000FF;">China </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">India-pass </span>the canal each year; but these, in nearly every<br/>
instance, are borne in British bottoms.<br/>
<br/>
Our military operations in the Philippines gave<br/>
an impulse to the canal receipts hitherto never enjoyed from this source by the company, and the<br/>
United States government, in the closing months<br/>
of 1898 and the first half of 1899, paid more in<br/>
tolls for warships, transports, and men, going or<br/>
coming from Manila, than it had hitherto paid the<br/>
canal in twenty years. It is truly an ill wind<br/>
that brings nothing to the Suez company. Every<br/>
year or two its tribute upon commerce is substantially augmented by the presence of armed strife<br/>
somewhere in Asia or Africa, in which Europe is<br/>
taking a hand. The years when Italy was hopelessly fighting the Abyssinians were among the<br/>
most remunerative in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eompany</span>'s history.<br/>
<br/>
The economy in using the canal is in the saving<br/>
of time only. The present toll is $ 1.90 on vessel<br/>
tonnage, and $ 2 for every passenger, not counting<br/>
the ship's crew. The toll on tonnage is equivalent<br/>
to the cost of about three thousand miles of ocean<br/>
transportation, it is estimated. Since <span style="color: #0000FF;">electric </span>lights<br/>
for night steaming came into use, it requires from<br/>
seventeen to twenty hours to make the passage<br/>
of the canal. The cost for a large steamer, like<br/>
a liner of the P. & <span style="color: #0000FF;">o.</span>, the Orient or British India<br/>
companies, or a troop-ship filled with soldiers, is<br/>
not infrequently ten thousand dollars. I first made<br/>
the trip from Port Said to the Red Sea in the yacht<br/>
