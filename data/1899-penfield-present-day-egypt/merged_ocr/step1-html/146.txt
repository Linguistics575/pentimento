nearly 9,000,000 Mohammedans, 730,000 Christians, and 25,000 Israelites. The Christians <span style="color: #0000FF;">ineluded </span>the Coptic race, numbering about 608,000,<br/>
of whom only a small proportion professed the<br/>
Roman Catholic or Protestant faith. Cairo was<br/>
found to contain 570,000 inhabitants; Alexandria,<br/>
320,000; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tania </span>(the largest town in the interior of<br/>
the Delta), 57,000; Zagazig and Mansurah, 35,000<br/>
each; Port Said, 42,000; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suez</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">17,000</span>; and Ismailia,<br/>
nearly 7000. From the figures dealing with the<br/>
last three towns it may be inferred that over<br/>
50,000 persons derive their living from the Suez<br/>
Canal. The largest town in Upper Egypt, Assiut,<br/>
had 42,000, Keneh ranking next with 24,000. The<br/>
total number of centers of population, comprising<br/>
towns, villages, farms, settlements, and Bedouin encampments, was found to be 18,129.<br/>

of discontented people from the Mahdi's territory<br/>
south of Wady-Halfa. A decided lessening of mortality, resulting from the introduction of rigorous<br/>
hygienic measures, has likewise had its <span style="color: #ff0000;">effeet</span>.<br/>
There has been a marked decrease in child mortality of late years.<br/>
<br/>
With the cultivated area estimated to be ten<br/>
thousand five hundred square miles, Egypt's population has increased in density to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">enormous<br/>
</span>figure of 928 to the square <span style="color: #ff0000;">mile,1 </span>being thus greater<br/>
