<span>Alexandria, Seat of Commerce<br/>
<br/>
the city once her capital marshals in memory all<br/>
that one has read or seen depicted on stage or canvas of the fascinating queen, and more than one<br/>
visitor aimlessly strolls the streets pondering the<br/>
problem of her nationality, and asking himself<br/>
whether the tale of her death from the bite of an<br/>
asp had its origin, like the William Tell narrative,<br/>
in a popular work of an early romancist. The<br/>
name haunts one everywhere. Even <span style="color: #ff0000;">pleasureboats </span>in the harbor and <span style="color: #ff0000;">cafes </span>in important thoroughfares record the name of Egypt's last queen,<br/>
and cigarettes served with <span style="color: #ff0000;">aftcr-dinner </span>coffee are<br/>
called in her honor as well.<br/>
<br/>
Tarrying travelers discuss Cleopatra with each<br/>
other, and with those whom they meet, as if she had<br/>
been of a recent century. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Guide-books </span>assure them<br/>
that she was but thirty-nine when she died by her<br/>
own hand, that the tragedy preceded the Christian<br/>
era by only thirty years, and that Alexandria was<br/>
alike the city of her nativity and her entombment.<br/>
<br/>
There are Alexandrians sufficiently cultured to<br/>
entitle their opinions to credence on most subjects,<br/>
who insist that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cleopatra </span>was a beauty of dusky<br/>
face; some go so far as to insist that she was<br/>
undeniably a Nubian, and point to the bas-reliefs<br/>
of the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span>, at Denderah, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">substantiation </span>of their opinion. But no cultured Greek<br/>
will enter the lists in a debate jeopardizing for an<br/>
instant the nationality of the great goddess of<br/>
beauty, for he knows with as much certainty as he<br/>
does the name of the present King of Greece that<br/>
Cleopatra was the purest of pure Greek, a Ptolemy,<br/>
