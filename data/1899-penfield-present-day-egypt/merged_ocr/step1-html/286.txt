<br/>
by the efforts of those supporting him, and by the<br/>
blunders of his opponents. After <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tel-el-Kebir </span>he<br/>
never uttered one word of regret, never made a<br/>
single inquiry as to the fate of those poor wretches<br/>
who were the victims rather of his dunderhead<br/>
stupidity than of his intentional wickedness."<br/>
<br/>
Many times, before and after the revolt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik<br/>
</span>Pasha was deplorably wanting in firmness, and, on<br/>
the other hand, was more than once as heroic as<br/>
any man could be when in imminent danger. If<br/>
compelled to decide quickly, the decision was too<br/>
often on the side of error; but with time for deliberation, his conclusion was nearly always to do<br/>
the right thing, unmindful of the peril or the consequences. A man of the greatest genius, however,<br/>
might have found it <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to thread his course<br/>
through such a labyrinth of doubts and misfortunes as that in which the khedive was placed.<br/>
<br/>
If any benefits immediately resulted from England's voluntary aid to Egypt, the breaking of the<br/>
dual control was the first in importance. French<br/>
susceptibilities were so irritated by the non-departure of the British troops, sent to the country to<br/>
restore the authority of the khedive, that the government of France declined to remain a party to<br/>
the management of Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">finances</span>. I do not<br/>
express an opinion as to the wisdom of this action<br/>
as a matter of policy, but the withdrawal of France<br/>
certainly helped the position of the poor Egyptians,<br/>
for they had then one master less. A single control is preferable to any other form of oligarchy,<br/>
when the welfare of a suffering people is considered.<br/>
