<span>Britain's Position in Egypt<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">functionary</span>. This is one of the best reasons given<br/>
by Englishmen why the occupation should not be<br/>
terminated, and any member of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">antiEnglish </span>party in Egypt, if asked for his opinion,<br/>
would assert that the omission to introduce the<br/>
English language into his country <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a triumph<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">statecraft</span>, and not <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">blunder </span>thereof. <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Having<br/>
no intention of going, the Britishers want an excuse, even a lame one, for remaining; and the influence of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Apglophobe </span>press, which they<br/>
purposely refrain from counteracting, creates one,"<br/>
this critic would say. Travelers have long known<br/>
that it was a part of Britain's policy in India to<br/>
allow native discontent to vent itself through the<br/>
local press. It relieves the Indian grumbler, and<br/>
does not hurt the English official.<br/>
<br/>
Is Egypt capable of <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-government</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?<br/>
<br/>
</span>The candor prompting one, after long and disinterested study of Egyptian matters in the country<br/>
itself, to say that England has performed her <span style="color: #ff0000;">selfappointed </span>task better than any other nation could<br/>
have performed it, likewise compels one to state<br/>
frankly that Egypt is not capable of complete selfgovernment at the present time, for she has no class<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>trained in the higher ranges of administrative work. No other nation should ever be permitted to supplant England as administrator or<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">occupier</span>," certainly.<br/>
<br/>
The khedive, in my opinion, is sufficiently earnest<br/>
and competent to guide an enlightened policy for<br/>
carrying on the affairs of his country without<br/>
any European intervention. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>would have at his<br/>
