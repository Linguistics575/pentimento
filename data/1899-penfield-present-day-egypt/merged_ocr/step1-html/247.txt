<span>Ismail as Khedive and Exile<br/>
<br/>
was robbing him, invited him to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghizereh </span>Palace to<br/>
discuss affairs of state. The man went, as he had<br/>
done scores of times before, but was never seen<br/>
again. A small government steamer started that<br/>
night for Upper Egypt, a brief notice was published<br/>
to the effect that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moufettish </span>had been sent on an<br/>
important mission to the southern provinces, and<br/>
that was all. The opinion was that the minions of<br/>
the khedive strangled him as soon as he passed the<br/>
portals of the palace, and that his corpse was carried to the bottom of the Nile so carefully weighted<br/>
that the evidence of the crime would be concealed<br/>
for all time. The palaces of the dishonest minister<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">finanee </span>were confiscated, and his harem of four<br/>
hundred women was broken up, most of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">beauties </span>being sent back to Europe. The tale of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Moufettish </span>ceased years ago to interest Cairenes,<br/>
and is now resurrected only when some one wishes<br/>
to show the summary method Ismail Pasha chose<br/>
to employ in dealing with an <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieial </span>who had <span style="color: #0000FF;">betrayed </span>his trust, as had Saddik Pasha.<br/>
<br/>
When Ismail came into power, he found his people living in the middle ages of orientalism, but<br/>
practically free from debt. Every pound of cotton<br/>
that his country could send to England brought a<br/>
dollar; and this condition spurred Ismail at once to<br/>
set to work to develop every resource of the Delta<br/>
and valley of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>bring Egypt abreast of<br/>
the Western countries that he had visited, -with a<br/>
lordly disregard of cost. Railroads were built, and<br/>
bridges and docks constructed; <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar-factories<br/>
</span>sprang up along the Nile like mushrooms, and be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">11<br/>
