was the Egyptian ruler with the work of the composer that Verdi was handed a purse of thirty<br/>
thousand dollars after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">opera</span>'s first presentation. Mariette Bey, the savant in Egyptology,<br/>
occupied himself with the reconstitution of the era<br/>
of the Pharaohs, and it is to his skill and learning<br/>
