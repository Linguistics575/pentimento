<br/>
things about Assuan, and in the matter of the<br/>
half-finished obelisk one will speculate why the<br/>
work was stopped, whether there was a change in<br/>
the dynasty, or if an appropriation gave out; and<br/>
it will do no harm, when studying the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches<br/>
</span>chiseled on the boulders along the river-bank, for<br/>
the mind to endeavor to determine whether they<br/>
are autographs or were cut by command of kings<br/>
desirous of leaving an indelible impress of their<br/>
reigns.<br/>
<br/>
Loiterers about Assuan must not be disappointed<br/>
when told that the crocodile is no longer to be<br/>
found within the tourist limits of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>. It will<br/>
be but another illusion shattered, like the popular<br/>
belief that the tailless Manx <span style="color: #0000FF;">eats </span>may be seen in<br/>
the Isle of Man, or gray Maltese <span style="color: #0000FF;">eats </span>in Malta.<br/>
Outside of a few princely gardens at Cairo not a<br/>
stalk of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus </span>plant can <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>found nearer<br/>
Egypt in these days than at Syracuse in Sicily;<br/>
and more and better examples of the Egyptian lotus<br/>
may be seen in August in the public fountain of<br/>
Union Square in New York than a winter's search<br/>
in Egypt will reveal.<br/>
<br/>
The evening songs of the Assuan boatmen are<br/>
soothing to jaded nerves, and the invalid who cannot find peace and benefit at this delightful <span style="color: #0000FF;">upriver </span>station can hardly expect to regain health in<br/>
Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The health-seeker who desires to linger beyond<br/>
the usual time for quitting Egypt in the spring <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">early </span>summer may find comfort and stimulating<br/>
sea-breezes at Ramleh, the Mediterranean suburb<br/>
