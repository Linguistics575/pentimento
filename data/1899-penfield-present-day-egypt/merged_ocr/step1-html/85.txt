<span>In <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fascinating </span>Cairo<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ligious </span>science, with the Koran as text-book. Then<br/>
follows jurisprudence, religious and secular. Literature, syntax, philosophy, prosody, logic, and<br/>
intricacies of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koranie </span>teaching as directed to<br/>
an upright life, round out the course.<br/>
<br/>
In lieu of a professor occupying a "<span style="color: #0000FF;">chair</span>" of<br/>
any high-sounding tt <span style="color: #0000FF;">ology</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>he may be said to hold<br/>
such and such a pillar, for when lecturing he sits on<br/>
a sheepskin rug at the base of a stone column, with<br/>
his students squatted in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-circle </span>before him.<br/>
Nearly three hundred marble pillars support the<br/>
roof of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">porticos </span>and such portions of El-Azhar<br/>
as are not open to the sky, and each is a "<span style="color: #0000FF;">classroom</span>" for some particular subject. Pupils listen<br/>
with rapt attention, taking part in the discussion<br/>
of a theme so intently as to be oblivious of the<br/>
presence of Christian spectators. A lecture finished, they respectfully kiss the hand of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">instructor </span>and hasten to another class to become<br/>
absorbed in further study.<br/>
<br/>
Equality seems to be characteristic of the university. Outward evidences of superiority and position are unimportant, for the son of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pasha </span>or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bey</span>, in robes of silk, sits side by side with peasant<br/>
youths clothed scantily in coarse cotton. Occasionally a green turban is seen, indicating that its<br/>
wearer has made a pilgrimage to the holy city, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>. that his family is believed to be descended from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>prophet. Rich and poor alike perform at stated<br/>
intervals the purifying <span style="color: #0000FF;">ablutions </span>at the fountains<br/>
within the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inclosure</span>, and all prostrate themselves<br/>
in prayer many times a day. This they do when<br/>
