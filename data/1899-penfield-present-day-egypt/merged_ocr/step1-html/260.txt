<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Constantinople for absolute independence. So certain was Ismail Pasha of positive <span style="color: #0000FF;">rulership</span>, perhaps<br/>
deceived by the wily Nubar, who was concerned in<br/>
the negotiations, that it is related that a banquet<br/>
was given to a group of favorite functionaries in<br/>
celebration of the news that he believed was forthcoming from the Sublime <span style="color: #0000FF;">Porto-that </span>the Sultan<br/>
had at last consented to give him full sovereignty<br/>
of the N ile country. The dinner was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lucullian </span>in<br/>
character, each dish a gastronomic triumph, and<br/>
the program called for a <span style="color: #ff0000;">surpris </span>at the end of<br/>
the feast. What it was to be, only the khedive and<br/>
his chef knew. Clothed in immaculate white satin,<br/>
the chef, <span style="color: #ff0000;">wielding </span>an enormous wooden knife, lifted<br/>
the crust of a huge pie placed in the middle of the<br/>
festal board, and out stepped a sprite in pink <span style="color: #0000FF;">fleshings</span>, dainty of face and form. With simulated bewilderment, she scanned for a moment the <span style="color: #0000FF;">faces </span>of<br/>
those at table, and, her choice decided upon, she<br/>
stepped over dishes and decorations to the head of<br/>
the table, and placed a kingly crown upon the brow<br/>
of Ismail.<br/>
<br/>
But an edict of another sort issued from Constantinople, and a few weeks after the historical<br/>
feast Ismail was sent away from Egypt, never again<br/>
to see his beloved capital. When dying, he pleaded<br/>
to be taken back to Egypt; but not until he was<br/>
dead was the consent of the Sultan and the powers<br/>
granted.<br/>
<br/>
A specially chartered steamship brought the<br/>
body of Ismail, accompanied by Princes Hussein<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fouad</span>, his sons, from Constantinople to Alexan<br/>
