<span>In <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>for Health's Sake<br/>
<br/>
The rose of to-day is a shoot,<br/>
<br/>
Like the song of a glorious root.<br/>
<br/>
Side by side, till the ages shall close,<br/>
Go the love of the lute and the rose;<br/>
And my song I enlink with the bloom<br/>
Of the redolent rose of Fayum.<br/>
<br/>
As health-stations, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luxor </span>and Assuan, in Upper<br/>
Egypt, have every recommendation, and are more<br/>
and more appreciated each season by rheumatic<br/>
and consumptive persons, and by healthy people in<br/>
want of mental rest and physical recreation. To<br/>
these an entire winter passed in either Luxor or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>, or divided between the two places, may<br/>
lead to the return of mental energy and bodily<br/>
health and vigor. These up-river places have the<br/>
purest and driest air to be found in Egypt, being<br/>
many degrees warmer than Cairo; and fast steamers and all-rail connection with the capital being<br/>
provided, they have sprung into a popularity not<br/>
to be wondered at. Their visitors keep better<br/>
hours, dance less frequently in overcrowded rooms,<br/>
and take more rational exercise, than do fashionable sojourners in Cairo. And besides, the daily<br/>
ride on donkey-back, necessary in making <span style="color: #0000FF;">excursions </span>to view objects of interest, has a-more <span style="color: #0000FF;">beneficial </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>upon inactive livers than any amount<br/>
of driving in a Cairo victoria.<br/>
<br/>
Rain is rare in Upper Egypt, and the oldest inhabitant has no recollection of frost. There are no<br/>
newspapers to disturb one's equanimity, no quotations of the stock exchange; yet the telegraph<br/>
