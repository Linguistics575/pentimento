rain of Egypt, should give his sanction thereto.<br/>
De Lesseps and his associates were to arrange the<br/>
matter at Constantinople, providing whatever incentive in the way of bakshish they might find<br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
De Lesseps's initial endeavors to secure funds<br/>
for his company were disappointing in the extreme. French capital in those days was averse<br/>
to investment away from home<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and, besides, the<br/>
Suez scheme was a startling novelty, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">traditionsnwere </span>against it. France had but recently<br/>

London journals raised a howl against the French<br/>
project that was to provide a short cut to India<br/>
for any Tom, Dick, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Harry. As a consequence,<br/>
Lombard Street said <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>No," emphatically, and made<br/>
the fact known to all the world; and thereafter all<br/>
possible difficulties were thrown in the way of the<br/>
scheme by Lord Palmerston's ministry.<br/>
<br/>
The sum that De Lesseps could raise among his<br/>
friends was but a drop in the bucket. What he<br/>
wanted was two hundred million francs. A sanguine engineer had assured him that this amount<br/>
would be sufficient for ditch, buildings, machinery,<br/>
and everything. Nothing had yet been done to<br/>
secure the Constantinople approval, probably because there was no money. There was an <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpromising </span>drag to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>whole matter. Something had to<br/>
