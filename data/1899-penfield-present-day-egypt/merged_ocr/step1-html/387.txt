and honest; but <span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">well-defined </span>written contract<br/>
aids greatly in keeping them exact in disbursements<br/>
and duties, and the average man of this calling<br/>
greatly values money given him as "<span style="color: #0000FF;">bakshish</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>For a dahabiyeh voyage a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman-contractor<br/>
</span>is almost indispensable. With the wane of the<br/>
Egyptian season, dragomans endeavor to secure<br/>
parties going to Palestine or Mount Sinai, and<br/>
have this object in mind while serving winter<br/>
patrons.<br/>
<br/>
It has become almost a truism that "T. Cook &<br/>
Son own the Nile." They were the pioneers of<br/>
systematic navigation on the great river, and for<br/>
twenty years have conducted their affairs in such<br/>
a businesslike manner that competition, if existing at all, has been weak and ineffective. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Practically </span>every steamer and modern dahabiyeh on the<br/>
Nile is owned by the firm of Cook, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>has a<br/>
seemingly perennial contract with the government<br/>
for carrying the mails. This chapter would be incomplete, in dealing with the vitally important subject of the Nile as a resort for health-seekers, if<br/>
mention of the facilities offered by the fleet of Cook<br/>
steamers and <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyehs </span>were omitted. In Egypt,<br/>
Cook is unique.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing in the desire to make this chapter<br/>
valuable to the inquirer for information, I must<br/>
explain how easily the voyage from New York to<br/>
Egypt may in these times be made. The route<br/>
best suited to those willing to <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>a few days'<br/>
time for the sake of comfort in traveling is by the<br/>
direct service of North German Lloyd steamers to<br/>
