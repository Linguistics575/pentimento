The fame of the Bulak collection became worldwide with the transfer from Dér el-Bahari of the<br/>
mummies of Rameses the Great and many of his<br/>
royal predecessors and successors. The storing of<br/>
these priceless objects in the trumpery Bulak buildings, small and inflammable, awakened the government to the need for better quarters. Then the<br/>
collection was moved across the Nile to the palace<br/>
of Gizeh. There, in a few years, it grew with such<br/>
rapidity, through the frequent finds of valuable<br/>
sarcophagi, statues, papyri, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">stelas</span>, that a popular demand for a fire-proof structure arose, and in<br/>
1897 the khedive laid with much ceremony the<br/>
corner-stone of a great building near Kasr el-Nil, in<br/>
Cairo, where the bodies of the kings, the antiquities,<br/>
the wonderful jewelry unearthed a few years since<br/>
at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dashur</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-equal </span>in design and finish to anything<br/>
a Tiffany of to-day can fashion, -and all the marvelous articles, will be deposited, there to remain,<br/>
it is hoped, forever. The building will be a fitting<br/>
monument to the labors of Mariette, Maspéro, Grébaut, the two <span style="color: #ff0000;">Brugsches</span>, and De Morgan.<br/>
<br/>
There is no more interesting ceremony in Cairo<br/>
than the annual cutting of the Khalig, in the early<br/>
days of August. When the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">begins </span>to rise, its<br/>
height is daily chanted through the streets, until it<br/>
reaches sixteen cubits on the ancient Nilometer at<br/>
the southern end of the island of Roda. This mark<br/>
reached, the Khalig el-Masri, the old canal that<br/>
flows through the heart of Cairo, is opened. Up<br/>
