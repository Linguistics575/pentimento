<span>Expansion by Irrigation<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">plishment </span>will be a <span style="color: #0000FF;">verifieation </span>of the ancient saying that <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Egypt is the Nile, and the Nile is Egypt."<br/>
<br/>
As an object-lesson, this Egyptian enterprise<br/>
should have no more interested observers than in<br/>
America, especially in Colorado, Nevada, California, and other States of the West, where the irrigation expert is succeeding the railway-builder as a<br/>
developer.<br/>
<br/>
British contractors have agreed that the dam<br/>
that is to "hold up" the historic river on which<br/>
Cleopatra floated in her gilded barge, and on which<br/>
Moses was cradled, will be completed by July 1,<br/>
1903. It will be built of granite <span style="color: #0000FF;">ashlar</span>, much of<br/>
which will be quarried from the Assuan side of<br/>
the river, coming from the ledges that furnished<br/>
the obelisks that now stand in Central Park in New<br/>
York, and on London's Thames Embankment, and<br/>
in the Place de la Concorde in Paris. It will be seventy-six feet high in places, and with its approaches<br/>
nearly a mile and a quarter long. The difference<br/>
in water-level above and below the dam will be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">forty-six </span>feet; and the top of the structure, thirty<br/>
or forty feet in width, will give bridge facilities to<br/>
pedestrians, camel-trains, and other <span style="color: #ff0000;">traffle </span>of the<br/>
region. It may interest arithmeticians to know<br/>
that it is estimated that a thousand million tons<br/>
of water can be stored in the reservoir.<br/>
<br/>
The laying of the foundation-block, of syenite<br/>
granite and weighing several tons, was an <span style="color: #ff0000;">impresssive </span>function. Queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Victoria</span>'s third son, his<br/>
Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught, performed<br/>
the office with rule, level, mallet, and silver trowel,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">151<br/>
