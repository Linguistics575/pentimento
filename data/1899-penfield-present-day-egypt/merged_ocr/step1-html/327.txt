<span>Britain's Position in Egypt<br/>

any other European power. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khartum </span>now reached,<br/>
England will stop at nothing to bring the valley<br/>
intervening between Khartum <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the equatorial<br/>
lakes safely within her dominion. Under no <span style="color: #ff0000;">eireamstanees </span>would Britain share her control of any<br/>
important part of the Nile with France, and she is<br/>
ready to resist by force of arms any movement<br/>
directed at a curtailment of her aspirations. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Her<br/>
</span>attitude at the time of the Fashoda incident proved<br/>
this, and did much to bring France to an understanding as to the relative spheres of <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence<br/>
</span>of the two governments in Africa.<br/>
<br/>
The southern provinces being now <span style="color: #0000FF;">reconquered</span>,<br/>
and railways from Assuan to Khartum, and from<br/>
the Red Sea to Khartum, either planned or building,<br/>
in effect making the Sudan a British colony, England at some time may believe it to her advantage<br/>
to relax her grip on Egypt and withdraw her troops<br/>
from Cairo and Alexandria. But diplomatic bickering or pressure will never bring about this result,<br/>
and no nation is alone sufficiently strong to enter<br/>
upon actual warfare to oust the British from their<br/>
position. The strength of the Muscovite may<br/>
scarcely be expected to be ever directed against<br/>
England in a contest for Egypt-the stakes would<br/>
be too small; and Russia, however pronounced her<br/>
sentimental attachment to France, is not going<br/>
to embark in <span style="color: #0000FF;">war </span>to further the ambitions of her<br/>
volatile friend. Germany, while perhaps regarding<br/>
England's methods in Egypt as forming a startling<br/>
precedent in statecraft, has not sufficient interest to initiate any active campaign in <span style="color: #ff0000;">connec<br/>
