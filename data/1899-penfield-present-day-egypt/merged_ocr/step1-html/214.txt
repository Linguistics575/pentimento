with the project. When Waghorn was carrying on<br/>
his controversy, young Ferdinand de Lesseps was<br/>
an <span style="color: #0000FF;">attache </span>at the French consulate-general in<br/>
Cairo, and there conceived the idea of accomplishing what had baffled Pharaohs, Ptolemies, and a<br/>
Bonaparte. Rapid promotion in the diplomatic<br/>
service in no way lessened his ambition some day<br/>
to wed the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. For<br/>
more than twenty years this was his constant<br/>
dream, until, in 1854, once more in Egypt, facile,<br/>
accomplished, impulsive, and convincing, he developed his plan to the Viceroy, Said Pasha. On<br/>
J <span style="color: #0000FF;">annually </span>5, 1856, De Lesseps was given a concession<br/>
to build the canal. With the coveted document<br/>
in his pocket, he realized that his aspirations to be<br/>
famous, some day to be "Le grand <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ihanpais</span>," were<br/>
to be fulfilled; and incidentally he saw an <span style="color: #0000FF;">effective </span>way of crushing the Waghorn "overland<br/>
route" from Alexandria to Suez, detested by<br/>
Frenchmen because the creation of a Britisher.<br/>
Said lacked the superstitious caution of his<br/>
grandfather, Mehemet Ali, and cared nothing for<br/>
the opinion of an antiquated oracle, if he had ever<br/>
heard of it. Paris was his Mecca; and, loving<br/>
Frenchmen as he did, he saw a most agreeable way<br/>
of making his own name immortal, and his country so prosperous that it would attain to a dazzling<br/>
position in the family of nations-all by means of<br/>
the canal, through the facile and convincing De<br/>
Lesseps. The canal was not to cost Said or his<br/>
people a single franc; on the contrary, fifteen per<br/>
cent. of the revenue coming from its operation <span style="color: #ff0000;">was<br/>
