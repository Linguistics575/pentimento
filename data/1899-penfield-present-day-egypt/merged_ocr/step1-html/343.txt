<span>Britain's Position in Egypt<br/>

ment, to defray the cost of the military campaign<br/>
resulting in the loss of the Sudan, for the recent<br/>
reconquest of the Sudan provinces, and for certain<br/>
public works deemed imperatively necessary.<br/>
<br/>
By her management of affairs England has,<br/>
nevertheless, so improved the conditions in Egypt<br/>
that European bondholders have been satisfied to<br/>
have the interest on their bonds reduced from seven<br/>
to three and a half <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>four per cent.<br/>
<br/>
England possesses a capacity for conducting<br/>
colonies and rehabilitating run-down countries<br/>
which amounts almost to genius. Overbearing and<br/>
arrogant as the British functionary out of England<br/>
often appears to be, he must be scrupulously honest and generally capable to find a place in the<br/>
perfectly organized machinery guided from London. Frenchmen say that Egypt's restoration to<br/>
prosperity could have been better accomplished<br/>
by them, and some allege that this prosperity is<br/>
more apparent than real, charging that much is<br/>
neglected in the desire to make a favorable showing in the yearly balance-sheet. But a frank<br/>
investigation of what France does with her own<br/>
dependencies, nearly every one of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is run at<br/>
a loss, gives support to the belief that Egypt is<br/>
better off under British guidance than she could be<br/>
under that of France. No alien power could have<br/>
done better in Egypt than Great Britain has. But<br/>
her critics claim to recognize scant justification for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Britain</span>'s absorption of the country of the khedive<br/>
merely because of her ability to do good work<br/>
there, and point to the glaring flaw in her title.<br/>
