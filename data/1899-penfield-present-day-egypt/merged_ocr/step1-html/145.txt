In 1846, under Mehemet Ali, the population was<br/>
estimated at only 4,500,000. The census of 1882,<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a most imperfect one, showed over<br/>
6,750,000; and that of 1897, to be considered as<br/>
fairly accurate, as it was made under British supervision, indicated a total population between<br/>
Wady-Halfa and the Mediterranean of 9,750,000.<br/>
Of this total, 50.8 per cent. were males, and 49.2 per<br/>
cent. females. After deductions for women, children under seven years, and desert Bedouins, it<br/>
was calculated that 12 per cent. of the males could<br/>
read and write, the remainder being entirely illiterate. The native Egyptians numbered 9,008,000, to<br/>
which were to be added 40,000 originally from<br/>
other parts of the Ottoman empire, and 574,000<br/>
Bedouins. Of these last only 89,000 were really<br/>
nomads, the remainder being described as semisedentary. Of foreign residents there were 112,500,<br/>
of whom the Greeks were the most numerous, with<br/>
38,000; then came the Italians, 24,500; British<br/>
(including 6500 Maltese and 5000 of the army of<br/>
occupation), 19,500<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>French (including 4000 Algerians and Tunisians), 14,000; Austrians, 7000;<br/>
Russians, 1400; Germans, 1300; and the remainder<br/>
divided among ten different nationalities, the<br/>
United States being represented by less than 200<br/>
missionaries and naturalized citizens.<br/>
