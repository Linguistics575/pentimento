<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
The contrasts presented by the people thronging<br/>
the streets are amusing and bewildering. The<br/>
European <span style="color: #0000FF;">element-Greek</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Freneh</span>--is<br/>
everywhere blended with the Oriental. Egyptian<br/>
women swing along in blue gowns and black veils<br/>
hanging loose, allowing the neck and line of cheek<br/>
to be easily seen, while concealing the only part of<br/>
the face scrupulously hidden by an Oriental woman<br/>
--the mouth. Bedouins stalk about with lordly<br/>
mien, wearing around their turbans the striped<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">kujieh </span>of their desert tribe. Coptic effendis, uncomfortable in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">clerical-cut </span>coat signifying governmental employment, <span style="color: #ff0000;">seamper </span>along on <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkeyback </span>conscious of their own importance, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>as<br/>
obsequious as slaves on encountering a person of<br/>
higher official station. A clatter of hoofs of a<br/>
cavalry guard draws every one to window or balcony to see his Highness the Khedive dash past,<br/>
in open carriage, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">aide-de-camp </span>by his side,<br/>
hurrying in from Koubbeh to conduct the day's<br/>
affairs of state at Abdin Palace. Running footmen, with bare brown legs and embroidered jackets with flowing sleeves, carrying wands of authority, soon follow, commanding the populace to make<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>for the carriage of their master, perhaps a<br/>
pasha making a call of ceremony, or the <span style="color: #0000FF;">diplomatic </span>representative of one of the great powers.<br/>
<br/>
In the midst of this moving throng a <span style="color: #0000FF;">camel-train<br/>
</span>comes noiselessly into the foreground, <span style="color: #0000FF;">laden </span>with<br/>
rough <span style="color: #0000FF;">building-stones </span>slung in network sacks, contending with English <span style="color: #0000FF;">dog-carts </span>and bicycles for<br/>
right of way. The camels never relax their super<br/>
