tion of Philae, and their memorials besieged the<br/>
Egyptian government for months. From every<br/>
country in Europe, from the United States, and<br/>
from the centers of learning in the East, antiquarians, Egyptologists, archaeologists, and literary<br/>
people generally, joined in vigorous protest. The<br/>
late Sir Frederick Leighton, president of <span style="color: #0000FF;">England's<br/>
</span>Royal Academy, did not hesitate to say that <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>any<br/>
tampering with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>would be a lasting blot on<br/>
the British occupation of Egypt." This stinging<br/>
remark brought the subject into the realm of British politics, and did as much as all the protests to<br/>
cause the too practical plans of the English engineers to be held in <span style="color: #0000FF;">abeyance </span>until a modified<br/>
project, <span style="color: #0000FF;">conciliating </span>archaeological interests with<br/>
engineering necessities, could be devised.<br/>
<br/>
To silence their critics, if possible, the engineers<br/>
proposed many makeshift plans, some of which<br/>
displayed surprising ingenuity. Sir Benjamin<br/>
Baker, of Manchester Canal fame, favored the raising of the island, as a whole, some twelve feet, and<br/>
offered to do it for a million dollars, guaranteeing<br/>
its safe accomplishment. Another gravely proposed that the temple of Isis, pylons and <span style="color: #0000FF;">all</span>, be<br/>
moved to a neighboring and higher island and <span style="color: #ff0000;">reerected</span>, and submitted a proposal for the contract.<br/>
Still another recommended building a <span style="color: #ff0000;">eaisson </span>of<br/>
masonry around the island, that would protect it<br/>
from flood, but make it necessary to descend a<br/>
flight of stairs to view the buildings, themselves so<br/>
artistic that people travel great distances to admire<br/>
them.<br/>
