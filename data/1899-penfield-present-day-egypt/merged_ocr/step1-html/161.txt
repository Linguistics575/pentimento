he can. Nevertheless, the strictly home indebtedness secured by farm mortgages is greater than it<br/>
should be. Some critics insist that this is certain<br/>
proof that the boasted prosperity of the country is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fictitious</span>, and exhibit statistics to support their<br/>
argument. Critics friendly to English rule array<br/>
figures calculated to show that the aggregate <span style="color: #0000FF;">domestic </span>mortgage indebtedness is very <span style="color: #0000FF;">small</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">less<br/>
</span>than forty million dollars, and that it is the proprietors of fifty acres and upward who have<br/>
pledged their farms; and, further, that they have<br/>
done this only to be able to buy more land, being<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">confident </span>of an appreciation of values. It is a fact,<br/>
I believe, that the proportion of petty holders borrowing by mortgage is small, and they are the<br/>
people whose welfare first deserves consideration.<br/>

The recent expansion of the cultivable area being<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>in Upper Egypt and portions of the Nile<br/>
valley where the fertility cannot be compared to<br/>
that of Lower Egypt, there has been a corresponding decrease in the average value of the acre.<br/>
When I investigated the subject five years ago, I<br/>
arrived at the conclusion that $ 115 was a fair estimate of the value of productive Egypt, acre for<br/>
acre. Now, when the character of the newly acquired extensions is considered, it is my judgment<br/>
that the average value of the 6,720,000 acres has<br/>
fallen to $ 105. Readers of mathematical mind, discovering that the foreign bonded indebtedness on<br/>
every acre of productive soil averages $ 75.74, and<br/>
adding $ 8 for home mortgage burden (to my mind<br/>
estimated <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>too low a sum), find that but little<br/>
