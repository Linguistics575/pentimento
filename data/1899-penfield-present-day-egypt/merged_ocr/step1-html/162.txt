<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
equity remains to the Egyptian, who for more than<br/>
six thousand years has been the most industrious<br/>
and light-hearted of husbandmen. Plainly stated,<br/>
it means a margin of only $ 21.26 an acre. And his<br/>
energy must not flag for generations to come, lest<br/>
his <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellow-ereature </span>in enlightened Europe be in<br/>
arrears over his interest on "Egyptians." Blessed<br/>
be Allah!<br/>
<br/>
In Viscount Cromer the British government has<br/>
one of its ablest administrators, and as forceful and<br/>
far-seeing a man as England's group of aggressive<br/>
empire-builders can show. A Baring, of the banking family, he graduated from the British army<br/>
into the foreign civil service, where his administrative genius was manifested years ago by his<br/>
good work in India, and the fact accepted by all<br/>
political parties in Parliament that he <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a man<br/>
to be trusted. As England's representative in the<br/>
dual <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>control of Egypt, in the years immediately precedent to the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">occupation</span>" of the<br/>
country by Great Britain, his tact and honesty<br/>
contributed greatly to preserving the apparent<br/>
entente cordiale with France, really <span style="color: #0000FF;">chafing </span>under<br/>
the gradual impairment of prestige in the land of<br/>
the Nile. The dual control ended, Major Baring<br/>
was elevated to the position of diplomatic agent<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">eons11l-general </span>in Egypt, and given almost<br/>
plenary power, not only in carrying into <span style="color: #ff0000;">effeet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">instructions </span>and suggestions from London, but in<br/>
shaping Britain's policy in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>valley and Delta.<br/>
The effective manner in Which he has handled<br/>
Egyptian affairs has made him his nation's credi<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">4.0<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
