<span>Tewfik and the Arabi Rebellion<br/>
<br/>
for treason, Tewfik was the first to speak for a commutation of sentence to <span style="color: #0000FF;">life-banishment</span>. Arabi<br/>
and his surviving fellow-traitors in Ceylon could<br/>
not have been forgetful of what they owed to the<br/>
tender heart of the khedive they had conspired to<br/>
destroy, when they heard that his Highness had<br/>
died suddenly, while still a comparatively young<br/>
man, at Helouan, on J <span style="color: #ff0000;">anuary </span>7, 1892.<br/>
<br/>
A brief account of Arabi in his exile may not be<br/>
out of place in concluding my chapter. It is<br/>
more than sixteen years since he and the seven<br/>
other rebels said farewell to their native land,<br/>
bound for Ceylon, under military escort. Since<br/>
then Abd-el-Aal Pasha, the most stalwart of them<br/>
all, and Mahmoud Fehmy, the astute engineer who<br/>
nearly succeeded in <span style="color: #0000FF;">blocking </span>the Suez Canal, have<br/>
gone over to the great majority. But Arabi himself, as well as Mahmoud Sami, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Toulba </span>Osmat, Ali<br/>
Fehmy, and Yacoub <span style="color: #0000FF;">Semi</span>, are still not only in the<br/>
land of the living, but in very good health and<br/>
spirits.<br/>
<br/>
There has been a good deal of marrying and<br/>
giving in marriage since the steamer <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mareotis<br/>
</span>took her contingent of prisoners to Colombo. The<br/>
sons born prior to their fathers' political troubles<br/>
are, for the most part, serving the present khedive in more or less responsible positions; but<br/>
many children of both sexes have been born to the<br/>
pashas since they set foot on British soil, and they<br/>
consequently are both <span style="color: #0000FF;">de </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">jure </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">de </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">facto </span>British<br/>
subjects. For some time there was much grumbling among the exiles, who suffered from the<br/>
