<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>

sued with more certainty of success than in any<br/>
other country that I have knowledge of.<br/>
<br/>
The present census gives to the practical Egypt<br/>
a population averaging nine hundred and twentyeight to the square mile of tillable <span style="color: #0000FF;">soil-a </span>density<br/>
far in excess of any European state, and not to be<br/>
equaled outside of Asiatic countries. The provision of sustenance for so many mouths depends on<br/>
the marvelous fertility of the soil, and that again<br/>
wholly on the mud and water of the Nile. In going<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">rail </span>southward from Cairo, or from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismailia </span>to<br/>
Cairo, one sees hundreds of striking illustrations of<br/>
this truth. Side by side one passes rich fields that<br/>
are under perennial cultivation, and close by sandy<br/>
wastes that never grow a blade of grass. The sterile expanse may be only a foot or two above the<br/>
luxuriant soil, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>water never reaches it, and that<br/>
is enough.<br/>
<br/>
It will no doubt surprise most readers of this<br/>
volume to learn that a fair estimate of the value of<br/>
Egypt's ten thousand five hundred square miles of<br/>
cultivable territory is $ 105 an acre. It is a fact, as<br/>
well, that the foreign bonded <span style="color: #0000FF;">indebtedness-nab</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>urally based upon the intrinsic value of the country-averages $ 75.74 per acre, while the per <span style="color: #0000FF;">capita<br/>
</span>proportion of the external debt burden is no less<br/>
than $ 52.20. The average <span style="color: #0000FF;">land-tax </span>of Egypt is<br/>
something in excess of $ 4 per acre. These vital<br/>
statistics are repeated here to <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflect </span>in its fullest<br/>
importance what the building of the great dam at<br/>
Assuan means to the people of Egypt. In the circumstances, the world can well afford to permit the<br/>
