<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
the cause of the superiority of the Cairo cigarette<br/>
over that of Alexandria or Port Said is the superdry climate of the capital, which is better adapted<br/>
to the fabrication of cigarettes than is the humid<br/>
atmosphere of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-coast</span>. The constant flow of<br/>
tourists has been the chief means of spreading the<br/>
taste for the Egyptian cigarette, acquired in the<br/>
land of the Nile, and its delicate aroma is familiar,<br/>
in consequence, not only in America and England,<br/>
but in far corners of the earth. <span style="color: #0000FF;">All </span>tobacco entering Egypt pays a duty equal to one dollar per kilogram, and a drawback equal to fifty cents a kilogram is allowed on cigarettes sent out of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
