<br/>
be done, and the man who had spent twenty-four<br/>
years in meditation over the canal scheme saw that<br/>
he alone must do it. To create the Suez Canal<br/>
was to be a feat of <span style="color: #ff0000;">finaneiering</span>, not of engineering.<br/>
<br/>
There was the easy-going Said, down in Egypt.<br/>
Why not have a try at him? Said loved Frenchmen, and believed the Suez Canal was to make his<br/>
name immortal. So the intrepid diplomat hurried<br/>
to Cairo and saw the Viceroy. "Certainly," was<br/>
his reply to De Lesseps's appeal, and he actually<br/>
loaned the money required for <span style="color: #0000FF;">making </span>the surveys and for exploiting the company throughout<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Europe-2,394,914 </span>francs in all. Had the Egyptian Viceroy said "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Non </span>as vigorously as had the<br/>
London bankers, how different would the modern<br/>
history of Egypt read, and how different would be<br/>
the material condition of the people of Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">!<br/>
<br/>
</span>Encouraged by his success with Said Pasha, De<br/>
Lesseps thought the time propitious for getting<br/>
from him another concession, cognate but subordinate to the great scheme. This was to connect<br/>
the canal bringing fresh water from the Nile with<br/>
another small canal running from Ismailia to the<br/>
termini of the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">ship-canal</span>. The concession<br/>
permitted De Lesseps and his associates to sell irrigation privileges from this special waterway; and<br/>
wherever the magical water of Father Nile can be<br/>
turned upon the desert, the sands thereof blossom<br/>
like the rose.<br/>
<br/>
In 1860 the Paris company of the long name was<br/>
again without a copper in its cash-box, and in debt<br/>
to an extent making the prospect almost hopeless.<br/>
