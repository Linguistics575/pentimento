<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cilious </span>expression, even when nibbling at beflowered<br/>
Parisian bonnets on the heads of ladies seated in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">victories </span>in front of them. This, or a <span style="color: #ff0000;">comic-operalike </span>medley fully as novel, may be seen any day<br/>
from the veranda of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shepheard</span>'s or the new Savoy.<br/>
<br/>
Equally heterogeneous is the jumble of humanity ori tourist-hotel terraces. Princes of ruling<br/>
European houses rub shoulders in friendly manner<br/>
with sovereign visitors from the States. The Englishman, who never tires of informing the stranger<br/>
of the benefits conferred on Egypt by the wholly<br/>
disinterested British "<span style="color: #0000FF;">occupation</span>," is everywhere.<br/>
Grand <span style="color: #0000FF;">duchesses </span>and society queens share tables<br/>
with dressmakers from Paris and elsewhere, each<br/>
sipping afternoon <span style="color: #0000FF;">tea</span>, not knowing, perhaps not<br/>
caring, who or <span style="color: #0000FF;">what </span>her <span style="color: #ff0000;">vis-h-vis </span>may be. An<br/>
Omdurman hero, modest and good-looking in civilian dress, is the cynosure for a few minutes of every<br/>
feminine eye, and the recipient of courtly consideration from "Baehler," "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Luigi</span>," or "George,"<br/>
-the managerial triumvirate of Cairo's hotels ,--<span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>the case may <span style="color: #ff0000;">he</span>. The Egyptologist, with long<br/>
hair, excavating at Thebes or Sakkarah, with half<br/>
the alphabet appended to his name, or the irrigation expert, rescuing from the desert a province<br/>
of tillable soil, is eclipsed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahdi'.s </span>escaped<br/>
prisoner. However, the inclination of this <span style="color: #ff0000;">teadrinking</span>, gossiping-perhaps flirting-crowd is to<br/>
forget cares and responsibilities, breathe the <span style="color: #0000FF;">heavenly </span>air, and watch <span style="color: #0000FF;">indifferently </span>the kaleidoscopic<br/>
panorama of Egypt passing endlessly in the street.<br/>
In a land of perpetual sunshine it is wonderful how<br/>
