<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
passes through the narrow streets, many women let<br/>
down from latticed windows shawls or face-veils, to<br/>
touch with them the sacred object. The pilgrimage<br/>
takes place annually, and the carpet is placed on<br/>
or near the sacred sanctuary in the temple at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mecca </span>where rests the body of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammad</span>. The<br/>
caravan returns to Cairo with the carpet of the<br/>
previous year. With the pomp attending its <span style="color: #0000FF;">des</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">patch</span>, and its journey to and from Mecca, the carpet costs the Egyptian government fully fifty<br/>
thousand dollars. An item of expense is the newly<br/>
minted coins thrown to the multitude by the khedive when bidding the chief of the caravan to<br/>
guard jealously his priceless charge.<br/>
<br/>
The man who has been to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mecca </span>is supremely<br/>
happy, knowing that paradise will be his reward<br/>
for a life devoted to the teachings of the Koran.<br/>
Neighbors who have not made the pilgrimage look<br/>
upon him as an exalted person, admitting that his<br/>
religion is of a quality superior to their own. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Be<br/>
</span>may wear interwoven in his turban a strip of green<br/>
cloth, the Prophet's own color, proclaiming to all<br/>
whom it may concern that its owner has prayed<br/>
within the holy of holies, and is evermore to be<br/>
given the title of hadji. These dignities and privileges are as nothing, in his opinion, compared with<br/>
the right to announce <span style="color: #0000FF;">pictorially </span>from his housefront the salient features of the trip to the sacred<br/>
city. This he does in his own <span style="color: #0000FF;">way</span>, with his own<br/>
hands, and with perspective wholly wanting. If<br/>
he went from Cairo to Suez by railway-which he<br/>
did on a third-class ticket, <span style="color: #ff0000;">probably-he </span>describes<br/>
<br/>
