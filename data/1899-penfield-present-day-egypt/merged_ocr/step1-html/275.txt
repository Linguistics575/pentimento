<span>Tewfik and the Arabi Rebellion<br/>
<br/>
M. de <span style="color: #ff0000;">Blignitres </span>and Major Baring from the ministry of <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance</span>; nor could he procure from these<br/>
controllers a single piaster for any purpose unless<br/>
they agreed with him as to the expediency of the<br/>
appropriation. Foreign intervention had not only<br/>
removed the cash-box from the custody of the khedive, but commissions of liquidation and restrictive<br/>
measures had completely changed the character of<br/>
the khedival office in its transition from father to<br/>
son.<br/>
<br/>
Hampered thus in the exercise of power, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik<br/>
</span>made enemies without gaining friends. The ruler<br/>
who distributes places and pensions has many eulogists. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik </span>Pasha was ready to <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoiiperate </span>in<br/>
doing away with extravagances and abuses; but<br/>
the alien <span style="color: #0000FF;">controllers-in </span>effect the "receivers" of<br/>
an establishment from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they wanted to extract every penny possible for their principals,<br/>
without destroying its future earning power-effected such sweeping economies that thousands<br/>
of natives went hungry as a consequence of a stoppage of their supplies. A people unfamiliar with<br/>
diplomatic methods of collecting overdue accounts<br/>
knew little of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">significance </span>of the dual control,<br/>
and cared less. Believing their khedive governed<br/>
Egypt, they addressed to him their petitions for<br/>
relief; but he could give no relief, and discontent<br/>
followed as a natural consequence. A glimmer of<br/>
understanding in time coming to the people, the cry,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Down with the foreigners!<span style="color: #0000FF;">'7 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rang </span>from the Mediterranean to the Sudan, and was echoed back with<br/>
the added cry of "Egypt for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptians</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span>"<br/>
