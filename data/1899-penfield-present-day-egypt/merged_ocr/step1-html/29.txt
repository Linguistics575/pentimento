<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
Walk eastward from your hotel, and in five <span style="color: #0000FF;">minutes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">you </span>are in the medley of East and West. At<br/>
the post-office observe the mingling of nationalities.<br/>
A German nurse-maid, leading the little son of a<br/>
prosperous Frankish merchant, is inquiring for letters at the paste restante window, and a patriarchal<br/>
sheik in silken <span style="color: #0000FF;">caftan </span>and turban is negotiating a<br/>
money-order to send to some <span style="color: #ff0000;">11p-Nile </span>village. With<br/>
a swagger indicating a sense of importance, Tommy<br/>
Atkins enters, pouch over shoulder, to get the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">daintybi1lets-doux </span>for the smart <span style="color: #0000FF;">regiment </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">quartered<br/>
</span>at Abbassieh, and home letters for officers and men.<br/>
Another window is surrounded by students from<br/>
El-Azhar. One is expecting his monthly remittance<br/>
from the family in Tunis, and his ten or twenty<br/>
comrades take a keen interest in the operation of<br/>
attaching the Arabic hieroglyphics to the several<br/>
receipts demanded in case of a money-order or<br/>
registered letter.<br/>
<br/>
Over the way, ranged along the iron palings of<br/>
the buildings of the Mixed Court, are the public<br/>
letter-writers, gravely imperturbable, sitting at umbrella-shaded tables, prepared to write anything<br/>
for illiterate applicants, in any language, for a piaster or two. One is preparing the soul-impassioned<br/>
letter of Bianca to her Giovanni, <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>in Naples<br/>
or Brindisi, assuring him that she has not ceased<br/>
to love him, although separated by the turbulent<br/>
Mediterranean for more than a month. At another<br/>
table one of the professional scribes is inditing for<br/>
Youssef Mohammed a bid for clearing a canal at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assiut</span>, for <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the government has invited tenders.<br/>
