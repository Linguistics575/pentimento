<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
If the assistance of the women and children of his<br/>
family proves <span style="color: #0000FF;">insufficient</span>, the needed additional<br/>
labor may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">seemed </span>at the rate of fifteen or eighteen cents a day for each man. In the unlikely<br/>
event of having to sell his cotton at the same price<br/>
as the American, even then he could make a <span style="color: #0000FF;">profit</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>prosperity is assured so long as the Southern<br/>
planter accepts the opinion that long-fiber cotton<br/>
can be grown only on the Nile, and that European<br/>
manufacturers will always be content to use the<br/>
American common staple.<br/>
<br/>
Egyptian cotton has become a necessity, not only<br/>
in Europe but in the United States as well, and it<br/>
brings to Egypt, for staple and seed, nearly fiftyfive million dollars per year, which sum is sufficient<br/>
to pay the interest on her enormous foreign debt,<br/>
carry on the government, and, when there are no<br/>
military operations up the Nile, leave something in<br/>
the treasury. The United States is buying a hundred thousand bales of Egyptian cotton annually,<br/>
and its consumption by New England spindles increases by leaps and bounds.<br/>
<br/>
In the provinces of Dongola and Berber huge<br/>
tracts are now open to the growing of <span style="color: #0000FF;">breadstuffs</span>;<br/>
and the Nile basin promises, as in the days of the<br/>
Pharaohs, to be in the near future one <span style="color: #0000FF;">of.the </span>granaries of the world. This will permit Lower Egypt<br/>
to be devoted to cotton-culture, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crop</span>'s area<br/>
may be made to include the Fayum, and extended<br/>
south of Cairo fifty miles or more.<br/>
<br/>
It is a conservative estimate that by 1905 Egypt<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>produce a million and a third bales of cotton;<br/>
