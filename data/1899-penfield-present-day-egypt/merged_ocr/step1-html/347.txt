<span>Britain's Position in Egypt<br/>

of their Egyptian chiefs. The native minister is<br/>
the visible and signatory power, the creative and<br/>
actual force being the English assistant. Everything financial is dictated by an "adviser," as is<br/>
nearly everything judicial, and these functionaries<br/>
are British. Similarly, the ministry of the interior,<br/>
presided over by the educated and capable Egyptian premier, is also largely directed by an "adviser."<br/>
<br/>
Lord <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">homer </span>is proud of the British assistants<br/>
who have <span style="color: #ff0000;">coiiperated </span>with him in the work of rehabilitating Egypt, and especially pleased to inform inquirers that the work has been accomplished<br/>
by a body of officials not exceeding one hundred<br/>
in number-a record that we in America, new to<br/>
colonial administration, will do well to consider.<br/>
An interesting example of the way in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>English <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>seek to carry the Egyptians with<br/>
them is afforded by some recently announced statistics. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance </span>ministry, under the strictest<br/>
British tutelage, 13 English and 513 natives are<br/>
employed; in the department of the interior, <span style="color: #0000FF;">dictated </span>by British rule, 62 English and 784 Egyptians find employment. In the offices under international control the percentage of Britishers is very<br/>
small. For example, the staff of the mixed courts<br/>
consists of 242 Europeans (of whom 17 are British)<br/>
and 101 Egyptians. The Caisse de la Dette employs 50 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Europeans </span>(2 being British) and 10<br/>
Egyptians, and the quarantine board has 48 European and 19 native employees.<br/>
