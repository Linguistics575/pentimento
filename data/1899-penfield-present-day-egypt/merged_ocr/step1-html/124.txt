habit. There is a law rigidly forbidding the importation of this noxious product of Indian hemp, and<br/>
the government employs every means for keeping<br/>
it out of Egypt. Hundreds of miles of littoral to<br/>
the west and east of Alexandria, that, <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>it not<br/>
for hashish smuggling, would seldom be watched,<br/>
are systematically patrolled by <span style="color: #0000FF;">coast-guardsmen</span>,<br/>
and every foot of the Suez Canal is similarly under<br/>
surveillance; while port authorities at Alexandria,<br/>
Rosetta, Damietta, and Port Said expend more<br/>
energy in endeavoring to prevent the secret landing of hashish than all other articles declared by<br/>
Egyptian law to be contraband.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Notwithstanding </span>these precautions, the cunning<br/>
of the smugglers enables them to run the forbidden<br/>
article across from islands of the Grecian Archipelago, and land it in Egypt with a certainty permitting the demand for the compound to be<br/>
regularly supplied. It is manufactured in many<br/>
out-of-the-way places in the eastern Mediterranean,<br/>
and its excessive value, once within reach of its<br/>
devotees in Egypt, is enough to compensate those<br/>
concerned in the trade for the occasional <span style="color: #ff0000;">eontiseation </span>of a shipment. Many of the devices practised<br/>
for getting it into the country are ingenious in the<br/>
extreme. A visit to the little museum connected<br/>
with the Alexandrian custom-house proves this.<br/>
One may there see innocent-looking trunks and<br/>
bulging piano-legs, the one with false bottoms and<br/>
the other with <span style="color: #0000FF;">capacious </span>cavities, that were filled<br/>
with hashish when investigated by the customhouse examiners. These are perhaps the simplest<br/>
