<span>The Present Khedival F <span style="color: #ff0000;">amily<br/>
<br/>
</span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">khedivah-rntee</span>, who, by reason of having<br/>
been born a princess, takes rank over the <span style="color: #ff0000;">khedivah<br/>
</span>as the first lady of the court. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">khedivahmere </span>is little more than forty years of age, and is<br/>
said to be charming and accomplished. She was<br/>
at one time the most beautiful of the princesses of<br/>
the East. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Her </span>lovely, clear complexion, <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>eyes, with the shape of her face and the carriage of the head, made her a very queen of beauty,<br/>
it is claimed by ladies having the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entree </span>at the<br/>
viceroyal court. Living in strict Mohammedan<br/>
seclusion, and never appearing in public except with<br/>
veiled faces, the ladies of the khedival family are<br/>
not subjected to masculine gaze. Their attendance<br/>
at the opera is concealed from the audience by<br/>
screened boxes; but flashing jewels and shadowy<br/>
outlines behind the gossamer curtains tell of their<br/>
presence.<br/>
<br/>
Up to February 20, 1899, Prince Mehemet Ali<br/>
was heir to the khedivate; but on that date the<br/>
consort of Abbas Pasha gave birth to a son at the<br/>
villa of Montazah, and while the happy event was<br/>
being celebrated throughout the country, it was<br/>
formally announced that Prince Mohammed Abdoul-Mounaim, the newborn, was heir apparent to<br/>
the khedival dignity and estate. This' was in<br/>
accord with the Sultan's firman of June 9, 1873,<br/>
which provided that the succession to the khedivate of Egypt is exclusively by order of primogeniture in the male line. Should Abbas Pasha die, the<br/>
firman provides for a regency until the heir attains<br/>
his legal majority at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">age </span>of eighteen years.<br/>
