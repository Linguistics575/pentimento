men on the Egyptian pay-roll, but always in responsible positions. It is true that one Englishman<br/>
can perform the work of two native clerks, but he<br/>
gets usually the pay that would go to three. There<br/>
are more Frenchmen, Syrians, and Italians <span style="color: #0000FF;">employed </span>by the Egyptian government than English,<br/>
probably. Most foreigners in the Egyptian service<br/>
are lavishly paid, wholly from the Egyptian exchequer. The salary of an "adviser" is about ten<br/>

country, and are yearly elevating thousands of<br/>
youths to a better condition, teaching them in particular the value of order and system. At Cairo,<br/>
Alexandria, Mansurah, Luxor, and many other<br/>
places, these schools for years have done a noble<br/>
