a steamer of the same line, that will land passengers at Port Said or Ismailia, whichever canal<br/>
station offers a favorable train to Cairo. If there<br/>
be no German Lloyd boat sailing from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Genoa </span>or<br/>
Naples at a convenient time, there are several other<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class </span>lines starting from or touching at these<br/>
ports, and one should find an available steamer<br/>
without much trouble or delay. In this way the<br/>
voyage from New York to Egypt is made with the<br/>
maximum of comfort in from sixteen to twenty<br/>
days. Every winter offers occasional excursions<br/>
by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">North </span>German Lloyd, Hamburg-American,<br/>
and French lines from New York to Alexandria direct; and as travel to Egypt grows, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>it does<br/>
by leaps and bounds, the facilities for getting there<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">are'sure </span>to increase. A regular direct service between New York and Alexandria, during the winter months at least, is almost certain to be soon<br/>
established.<br/>
<br/>
The robust traveler bound for the land of the<br/>
Pyramids can disembark from his Atlantic liner in<br/>
England or France, as the case may be, catch a quick<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">train</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>Marseilles, Brindisi, Genoa, Naples, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Venice</span>, or Triest, and be in Alexandria or Port Said in<br/>
a few.days' less time than if he went by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">all-sea<br/>
</span>route. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If.he </span>is willing to travel post-haste, he may<br/>
be in <span style="color: #0000FF;">.Gai-ro </span>.in fourteen days after leaving New<br/>
York, or possibly in thirteen.<br/>
