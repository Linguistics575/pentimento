<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
The khedive, khedival family, and palace expenses,<br/>
coming under the head of "<span style="color: #0000FF;">civil </span>list," call for<br/>
$ 1,159,000. In ordinary times the army and military police cost $ 2,390,000, and civil and military<br/>
pensions $ 2,150,000 more.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly half of the sum required to carry on the<br/>
Egyptian government is produced by direct <span style="color: #0000FF;">taxation </span>on land. The other half is made up by indirect taxation, from the following sources: customs receipts (eight per cent. on imports and one<br/>
per cent. on exports), tax on date-trees, tobacco tax,<br/>
municipal octroi on food and merchandise, stamp<br/>
duties, receipts from railways, <span style="color: #ff0000;">post-offices</span>, telegraphs, lighthouses, and courts of justice. The<br/>
sale of salt and <span style="color: #0000FF;">matron </span>gives a yearly revenue of<br/>
nearly $ 8,000,000.<br/>
<br/>
A reform of the greatest importance, to become<br/>
effective in the immediate future, is the adjustment<br/>
of inequalities in the land-tax. By the old scheme<br/>
of estimating values many anomalies were <span style="color: #0000FF;">countenanced</span>, as well as many injustices. It was not<br/>
unusual to find land renting at thirty or <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty-five<br/>
</span>dollars an acre paying the government only two<br/>
and a half dollars in taxes. In Ismail's time there<br/>
was no rule for the collection of taxes, and the<br/>
minions of the government went prepared to take<br/>
from the farmer every penny his crops had produced, and then <span style="color: #0000FF;">dog </span>him into borrowing at heavy<br/>
usury any additional sum the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rapacious </span>collector<br/>
chose to demand. Not until Khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik's<br/>
</span>reign was a receipt of any kind given the peasant<br/>
to show that he had paid his taxes and that no<br/>
