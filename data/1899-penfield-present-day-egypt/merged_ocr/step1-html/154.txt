<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
thorough reform has yet to be accomplished in the<br/>
public service of Egypt to plac'e it on a footing by<br/>
which it might be compared with public employment in either the United States or Great Britain.<br/>
<br/>
The "international "aspect of Egypt is an expensive luxury, and contributes in no small measure<br/>
to the demands upon the public treasury. The<br/>
International Debt Commission, for illustration,<br/>
brings to Cairo delegates of the powers which are<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eountry</span>'s creditors. Each is paid a salary of<br/>
ten thousand dollars by the khedival government<br/>
for looking after the interests of his countrymen<br/>
fortunate enough to own Egyptian bonds, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>can<br/>
be sold anywhere at a substantial premium, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, very likely, <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>purchased at a price far<br/>
below their par value. Having no voice whatever<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixing </span>the rate of interest, or the proportion<br/>
going to the different countries, it might occur to<br/>
the strict reformer that a competent, trustworthy<br/>
accountant could perform the service of these six<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>, with a great saving to the toiling masses<br/>
of Egypt. But the countries interested would no<br/>
more be able to agree on the nationality of such an<br/>
accountant than were the same powers in deciding<br/>
the question of nationality of the governor of Crete<br/>
after the Greco-Turkish war.<br/>
<br/>
The railway system of less than fifteen hundred<br/>
miles is managed by three princely paid men, <span style="color: #0000FF;">acting </span>for England, France, and Egypt. In Europe<br/>
or America a single competent man would do it all,<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fraction of the pay, and most likely find time<br/>
hanging heavily on his hands and want more to do.<br/>
