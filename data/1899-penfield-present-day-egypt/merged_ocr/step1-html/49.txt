<br/>
common people, however, adhere to a plurality of<br/>
wives, resenting what they look upon as a movement to abridge the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koranie </span>custom and privilege.<br/>
<br/>
The formality of divorce is much simpler than<br/>
that of marriage. Among those not burdened with<br/>
estates and personal belongings it is as easy and<br/>
direct as the dismissal of a servant. The words<br/>
"Woman, I divorce thee," uttered three times in the<br/>
presence of witnesses, if attended by the return of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">trifling </span>sum that formed her dower, are as<br/>
binding as the final decree of any court in the<br/>
world. The restitution of dower sometimes leads<br/>
to complications, but it is necessary to render the<br/>
husband's words effectual.<br/>

Woman's position in the Egyptian capital is<br/>
materially benefiting by the movement looking toward the education of native girls. Twenty years<br/>
ago native ladies regarded education as the learning of sufficient French or Italian to read novels or<br/>
follow the plot of the opera. The past few years<br/>
have developed a desire among upper-class women<br/>
to have their daughters educated with as much<br/>
care as boys are, and an important adjunct to the<br/>
household, consequently, is the European governess, most often English. A sister of the khedive,<br/>
the Princess Khadija, is an active agent in improving the educational status of poor girls..<br/>

Most women visitors to Cairo are curious to see<br/>
the interior of a harem. But this, as Europeans<br/>
understand it, no longer exists in Egypt. Every<br/>
native house, however, has its harem division, set<br/>
apart for women, <span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">salamlikis </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">men-nothing<br/>
