<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
01d Egypt is now so fairly in step with the march<br/>
of progress as to be attracting the attention of the<br/>
civilized world. Irrigation is the lever of this <span style="color: #ff0000;">progTess-the </span>irrigation of definite science, rather than<br/>
of chance or guesswork; and the move to harness<br/>
the Nile and compel it to surrender its magical<br/>
richness to the soil is a project that will be watched<br/>
by millions of students of utilitarianism. Stated<br/>
simply, it means the increase of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span>'s productive capacity by <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>per <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>, bringing,<br/>
as it will, considerable stretches of desert soil within<br/>
the limits of cultivation, while vast sections of<br/>
land already arable will be rendered capable of producing two, if not three, crops in the year, by having "summer water" supplied to the thirsting<br/>
ground.<br/>
<br/>
As shown in another chapter, the Egypt of the<br/>
map contains more than four hundred thousand<br/>
square miles, an expanse seven times as great as<br/>
New England; but the practical <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt-that </span>which<br/>
produces crops and sustains <span style="color: #0000FF;">life-is </span>considerably<br/>
less than the States of Massachusetts and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Connecticut </span>united. This is the ribbon-like strip of alluvial<br/>
land bordering the Nile, a few miles wide on each<br/>
side, and measuring not more than ten thousand<br/>
five hundred square miles. The extension planned,<br/>
and to be completed in the next six or eight years,<br/>
wholly by irrigation, is no less magnificent in <span style="color: #0000FF;">conception </span>than the rescuing from the Libyan and<br/>
Arabian deserts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>hundred square<br/>
miles, or twice the area of Rhode Island. This will<br/>
be exploitation in its truest sense, and its accom<br/>
