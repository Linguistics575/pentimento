<span>Ismail as Khedive and Exile<br/>
<br/>
generosities were as <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnifieent </span>as his vices, and<br/>
he consulted neither law <span style="color: #0000FF;">nor </span>reason in discharging<br/>
his khedival prerogative, for he was a law unto<br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
When General Sherman informed him that<br/>
American military men could give Egypt a capable<br/>
army, he brought thirty or forty of these specialists<br/>
to the country and paid them lavishly, instead of<br/>
fifteen or twenty as advised by the great general.<br/>
When Ismail sent a wedding-gift of a handful of<br/>
diamonds to General Sherman's daughter, later on,<br/>
the value of the dazzling jewels was found to be so<br/>
great that the limited Sherman fortune was menaced by the New York customs collector. Asked<br/>
to present an obelisk to New York's Central Park,<br/>
Ismail promptly authorized the removal from<br/>
Egypt of the monolith of red syenite granite that<br/>
J ulius <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesar </span>had brought from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis </span>to<br/>
adorn the approach to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cesarean </span>temple in<br/>
Alexandria, forgetful of the fact that it was covered<br/>
with hieroglyphs of the reigns of Thothmes III,<br/>
Rameses the Great, and Seti II, that it antedated<br/>
the Christian era fully twelve centuries, and was<br/>
for other reasons an object of priceless value to<br/>
students of Egyptology. But there was nothing<br/>
petty about Ismail, and when he admired a nation<br/>
as he did the American, he would have given away<br/>
a pyramid with as little concern as he would a<br/>
blooded horse from his stable.<br/>
<br/>
Ismail was born in Cairo on the last day of the<br/>
year 1830, and died on March 2, 1895. Bis father<br/>
was the warrior son of Mehemet Ali, Ibrahim<br/>
