<span>In Fascinating Cairo<br/>
<br/>
wealthy compatriots finding health and recreation<br/>
under Egyptian skies. First I sought the opinion<br/>
of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">New-Yorker</span>, proprietor of a great newspaper,<br/>
on the subject. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Accustomed </span>to seeing the pros and<br/>
cons of a question at a glance, with natural shrewdness tempered by much diplomatic experience, he<br/>
foresaw in a minute more obstacles to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>project<br/>
than I had discovered in a month's consideration<br/>
of the scheme. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">engineering </span>problems of bringing a monolith seventy-five feet long and weighing<br/>
two hundred and twelve tons several hundred miles<br/>
down the Nile, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">reiireeting </span>it in Abdin Square,<br/>
had <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>interested me. My New York friend<br/>
predicted an avalanche of reproach from the whole<br/>
civilized world, that would surely be started directly<br/>
the matter was made public<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">It </span>will not do at<br/>
all," he said, in summing up. A Chicago friend,<br/>
on the other hand, pronounced the scheme a good<br/>
one. "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Put </span>me down for five hundred dollars toward the expense; and I can get a dozen more<br/>
Chicagoans to give the same," he added.<br/>
<br/>
In time I was forced to admit that the archaeologists of France, Italy, England, and perhaps the<br/>
United States, having provided their own countries<br/>
with obelisks, would assail the suggestion to give<br/>
dear old Cairo just one of the massive shafts that<br/>
were indigenous to Egypt; and I saw enough in the<br/>
opinion of the astute New-Yorker to cool my ardor<br/>
and cause me to abandon the plan that sentiment<br/>
had suggested. But I cannot help <span style="color: #0000FF;">thinking- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>the<br/>
capital of Egypt is entitled to an obelisk. <span style="color: #0000FF;">How<br/>
</span>graceful the act if some great city,. in<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">which </span>the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">SI<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
