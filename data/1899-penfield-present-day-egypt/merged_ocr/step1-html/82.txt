<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Years ago it was <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>and disagreeable to view<br/>
the interior of this great school that draws scholars<br/>
from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">remotest </span>lands where the Koran is read.<br/>
Now the formalities are simple and easily complied<br/>
with, and the presence of strangers is scarcely<br/>
noticed. From the hotel quarter it is but a <span style="color: #ff0000;">fifteenminute </span>drive to El-Azhar. One passes through<br/>
that marvelous street of shops, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mouski</span>, and<br/>
turning off, forces his way through <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>narrow<br/>
lane known as the "Street of the Booksellers,"<br/>
where Arab workmen are binding <span style="color: #ff0000;">e11rious-loolring<br/>
</span>volumes, seated <span style="color: #0000FF;">cross-legged </span>on the floor of tiny<br/>
box-like shops, and with a surging <span style="color: #0000FF;">conglomeration<br/>
</span>of humanity, camels, and braying donkeys passing<br/>
not two feet away. This brings one to the "Barbers' Grate," about Which are always to be seen students having their heads so closely shaved as to<br/>
leave no suggestion of hair.<br/>
<br/>
The structure, too often restored to leave any in-.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dication </span>of the original building, surrounds a large<br/>
open court with arcades <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>every side. The lofty<br/>
minarets are fine examples of Eastern art. The<br/>
pavement is of marble, much worn in places, and<br/>
everywhere polished by constant use. There are<br/>
seven entrances, each with a name as singular as<br/>
that where the barbers congregate. El-Azhar is so<br/>
surrounded by houses that very little can be seen<br/>
of it externally, and the building is almost destitute<br/>
of architectural embellishment.<br/>
<br/>
The enormous square court is bordered with porticos, each divided into various compartments for<br/>
the separate use of students of different nations.<br/>
