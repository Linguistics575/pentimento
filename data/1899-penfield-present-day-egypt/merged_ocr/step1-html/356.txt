<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
command a group of progressive men like Tigrane, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Boutros</span>, Mustapha Fehmy, Fakhry, Mazloum, Cherif, and Yakoub Artin, each qualified to<br/>
render excellent service as an independent minister.<br/>
As in times prior to the coming of the English, the<br/>
khedival government could employ expert or technical assistants of any nationality it chose. American military <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers</span>, before England's assumption<br/>
of power, gave Egypt as good an army as it ever<br/>
had. British and other irrigationists and engineers<br/>
having services to sell should be as willing to labor<br/>
for Egypt as a self-governing administration as<br/>
they are under a regime upheld by British soldiers.<br/>
In this way perhaps the prerogatives of the khedive<br/>
might be restored, and the "running shriek of <span style="color: #ff0000;">denunciation </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>of the army of occupation be silenced.<br/>
<br/>
Egypt might, and might not, prosper under these<br/>
changed conditions. But there is little likelihood<br/>
of her being permitted to try the experiment, whatever her right, and "Egypt for the Egyptians "must<br/>
remain, in all probability, a sentimental illusion.<br/>
The khedive has the undoubted right to govern his<br/>
country, subject only to his imperial sovereign at<br/>
Constantinople, at least until it is demonstrated<br/>
that he is incapable. It is no reckless hazard,<br/>
however, to predict that a dozen years hence all<br/>
that portion of the Nile valley from the Mediterranean to Khartum and farther south will be represented in <span style="color: #ff0000;">sehool-books </span>as a pendant from <span style="color: #ff0000;">B1itain's<br/>
</span>red girdle of the globe. <span style="color: #0000FF;">How </span>it is to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">accomplished</span>, legally and morally, is a matter regarding<br/>
which I can record no conjecture. In time some<br/>
