<br/>
confusion of the ideas intended to be expressed.<br/>
An entire department, having charge of museums<br/>
and the conservation of antiquities, employing<br/>
thousands of natives, is exclusively French in administration, although supported in great measure<br/>
by English-speaking visitors. So long as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>language of the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>remains<br/>
French, his mode of thought and action will be<br/>
French <span style="color: #0000FF;">also</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>In Cairo and Alexandria as many as ten <span style="color: #0000FF;">newspapers </span>are printed in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>French language, purveying<br/>
opinion bitterly hostile to the occupation. One of<br/>
these, published at the capital, printed daily for<br/>
years in <span style="color: #0000FF;">display-type </span>a list of Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Britain</span>'s broken pledges in <span style="color: #0000FF;">connection </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>occupation, quoting from Blue Books and like documents such<br/>
extracts as appeared to prove its <span style="color: #0000FF;">case</span>. Only one<br/>
English journal is published, and that is forced to<br/>
print its news and editorials in French as well as<br/>
English to secure remunerative circulation.<br/>
<br/>
All the journals printed in French are <span style="color: #ff0000;">antagonistie </span>to British rule, and being regarded by thousands as oracles, their <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>is far-reaching.<br/>
From their columns European opinion favorable to<br/>
the anti-English cause is translated into Arabic by<br/>
native journalists, who read French and know not<br/>
a word of English, and finds currency in the native<br/>
papers penetrating every village. Public measures<br/>
are <span style="color: #0000FF;">acrimoniously </span>reviewed and made to appear to<br/>
the native reader as added evils, and any reform<br/>
introduced by England can have its merits so distorted as to be always regarded by the common<br/>
