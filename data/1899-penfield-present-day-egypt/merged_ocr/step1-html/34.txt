<br/>
the willingness to do nothing grows on human<br/>
beings who in other places must be employed to<br/>
be happy.<br/>
<br/>
An amusing feature of street life is the manner<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">huekstering </span>of fowls is conducted.<br/>
The fellah woman, paying duty at one of the octroi<br/>
bureaus, comes into Cairo with a donkey loaded<br/>
with baskets of hens, ducks, and geese, their heads<br/>
standing out in every direction as if enjoying their<br/>
outing. To sell a dozen fowls keeps the woman<br/>
dickering all day. Her lord and master, maybe, is<br/>
driving a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flock </span>of young turkeys through the<br/>
crowded streets of the European quarter, singing<br/>
the praises of his peeping, docile birds in a manner conveying a meaning only to the servant class.<br/>
With a <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-branch </span>he guides the <span style="color: #ff0000;">floek </span>wherever<br/>
he wishes, keeping the birds clear of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">traffie</span>.<br/>
The man loves to <span style="color: #0000FF;">dicker</span>, also, and has no <span style="color: #0000FF;">appreciable </span>regard for time. To effect the sale of a turkey<br/>
requires a vast amount of palaver and much estimating of weight, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>numerous disinterested<br/>
natives are invited to take part. Milk is sold in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>manner too direct to admit of adulteration, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the<br/>
cow is milked in front of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eustomePs </span>door; but<br/>
skeptical Egyptians hint that the cows are systematically plied with lukewarm water before setting<br/>
out. A ridiculous custom is to have a small boy <span style="color: #ff0000;">aecompany </span>the cows, carrying under his arm a stuffed<br/>
calf, to make them submit willingly to the milking<br/>
process. Badly moth-eaten, with stuffing of straw<br/>
protruding from a dozen places, this calf is always<br/>
in evidence. It is a custom, and in Egypt cus<br/>
