<span>Present-Day Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Evidences of insubordination in the native army<br/>
were brought to public notice daily, furnishing a<br/>
theme of conversation in bazaar <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>palace. The<br/>
soldiers had many grievances, the arrears of pay<br/>
being the most important. Before Ismail had been<br/>
driven away, the minister of finance had even been<br/>
mobbed in the street by four hundred desperate<br/>
officers, demanding the means to supply their<br/>
families with food. On another occasion an army<br/>
officer carried a dead child in his arms to the ministry of <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance</span>, praying for enough of the money<br/>
due him to provide decent burial for his little one.<br/>
When the strain to find funds to pay European<br/>
bondholders was greatest, the crops failed in Upper<br/>
Egypt, and there was much <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffering </span>among the<br/>
populace.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile the cry, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Egypt for the Egyptians <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>"<br/>
was coming to have more than a sentimental meaning. It was maturing into a menace, and one of<br/>
such force that every intelligent person in Egypt<br/>
must have recognized its possibilities. I confess<br/>
that the position of the common people, if truthfully described by impartial witnesses, <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflected<br/>
</span>a cruel disregard of the principles of justice and<br/>
humanity. I am certain my sympathies would<br/>
have gone to the poor Egyptians, ground to starvation that distant bondholders might continue to<br/>
receive an exorbitant and usurious interest.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o </span>universal rule for redressing grievances can<br/>
be laid down, but there was a right as well as a<br/>
wrong way of attempting a rational solution of<br/>
even so complicated a situation as that prevailing<br/>
