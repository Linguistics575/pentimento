<br/>
</span>Pasha to Ismailia, and Tewfik Pasha to Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik</span>, nothing in Egypt beyond a public square in<br/>
Port Said bears the name of De Lesseps. The<br/>
Suez company is erecting a bronze statue at Port<br/>
Said of the author of the canal, modeled by M.<br/>
Fr√©miet; but as the appropriation for this was<br/>
paltry, its importance cannot be deemed commensurate with the achievement it is planned to commemorate. At the opening of the canal everybody<br/>
expected that some distinction would be conferred<br/>
on De Lesseps, the general opinion being that he<br/>
would be created Due de Suez; and astonishment<br/>
was felt at his being merely given the grand cordon<br/>
<br/>
two thirds of the year. Both piers were constructed of blocks of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">artifieia1 </span>stone, manufactured of seven parts of sand from the desert<br/>
and one part of hydraulic lime imported from France. The concrete<br/>
was mixed by machinery and poured into large wooden molds, in<br/>
which it remained for several weeks. The molds were then <span style="color: #0000FF;">removed</span>, and the blocks exposed to the air to harden more thoroughly. Each block weighed twenty tons, and thirty of them were<br/>
manufactured daily. In all <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>thousand were required.<br/>
Above the wooden molds, which covered an extensive piece of<br/>
ground, was constructed a railway, bearing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">steam-crane</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>could be moved to any required spot, for the purpose of hoisting the<br/>
blocks and conveying them to their destination. After having been<br/>
hoisted by the crane, the blocks were transported to a boat, where<br/>
they were placed on an inclined plane in twos and threes, and secured by means of wedges. They were then conveyed to the place<br/>
where they were to be sunk, the wedges were removed, and the<br/>
huge masses slid down the incline, splitting the wood and emitting sparks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span>on their way, and plunged into the water with a<br/>
tremendous splash, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the boat staggered from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">effects </span>of the<br/>
shock and was lashed by the waves thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificially </span>caused. These<br/>
huge pierres perdues, as they were technically <span style="color: #0000FF;">celled</span>, were thus<br/>
gradually heaped up until they reached the surface, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>last<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">layers</span>, -rising a little above the level of the water, were finally <span style="color: #ff0000;">depositedyby </span>means of a crane erected on a steamboat.<br/>
