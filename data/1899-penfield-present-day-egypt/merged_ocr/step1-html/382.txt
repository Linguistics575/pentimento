to find gales and cold storms that effectually undo<br/>
the physical improvement resulting from the season<br/>
passed in Egypt. Instead of hurrying away as<br/>
the first khamsin blows, it is better to remain in<br/>
Cairo or Alexandria until the end of April. These<br/>
cities are replete with out-of-season comfort, and<br/>
no danger lurks in the honest warm weather.<br/>
March is delightful, and if the midday sun of April<br/>
is avoided, there is no discomfort worthy of consideration. Strangely enough, the ever-present<br/>
mosquito is less annoying in spring and early summer than in <span style="color: #ff0000;">winter.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

The trip is in no case inexpensive, unless made by<br/>
rail; and in a country possessing so many unrivaled interests, no one wishes to travel by railway<br/>
except in case of necessity. Up to comparatively<br/>
recent years the voyager to Upper Egypt made<br/>
the journey only at great expense of time and<br/>
money. It meant months on a dahabiyeh, generally<br/>
chartered for an entire season. Nothing more<br/>
agreeable can ever be devised; but there are stages<br/>
and conditions of invalidism where it is undesirable<br/>
to take the risk of being several days between towns,<br/>
unless the invalid be accompanied by a physician.<br/>
Steam, under these circumstances, with its definite<br/>
schedule, is safer. The large tourist-steamers carry<br/>
medical officers, experienced and <span style="color: #ff0000;">effieient</span>, and combine every convenience and comfort of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">floating<br/>
</span>home. Stopping at fewer places, and having no<br/>
program of <span style="color: #0000FF;">excursions </span>to points of interest far re<br/>
