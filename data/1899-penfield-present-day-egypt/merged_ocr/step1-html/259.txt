<span>Ismail as Khedive and Exile<br/>
<br/>
that <span style="color: #ff0000;">opera-goers </span>owe their enj <span style="color: #ff0000;">oyment </span>of the marvelous picture of the temple of Ptah in the second act.<br/>
Perhaps no opera was ever put on the stage in such<br/>
elaborate fashion or with such scrupulous regard<br/>
for archaeological accuracy. Planned to stand but<br/>
a few months, the theater has since been the home<br/>
of opera in Cairo, and Verdi's masterpiece is given<br/>
therein several times every winter. The composer's original manuscript of "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Aida </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tt </span>is among the<br/>
treasured archives of the opera-house.<br/>
<br/>
It was Ismail's dream to make an Oriental Paris<br/>
of Cairo. The French metropolis, he argued, could<br/>
be reproduced: it was simply a question of finance.<br/>
A goodly portion of the money borrowed by the<br/>
khedive was, spent at Gizeh, nearly opposite the<br/>
spot where tradition says Moses was found in the<br/>
bulrushes. Half a dozen lath-and-plaster structures, with walls painted in a style suggesting<br/>
solidity, went up there, with accompanying gardens<br/>
like the Tuileries ranging from the Nile nearly to<br/>
the Libyan desert. One of Ismail's ruling passions<br/>
was for building palaces, and another found expression in the way he surrounded himself with everything deemed fitting to the court of a mighty <span style="color: #0000FF;">perSonage-a </span>king among kings.<br/>
<br/>
To this day, hidden away in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cellars</span>, are<br/>
miles of iron fencing made to his order in Europe,<br/>
a conspicuous feature of whose ornamentation is<br/>
the royal cipher "I. R.," surmounted by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">arch's<br/>
</span>crown. This was to inclose palace domains, and<br/>
the design had been agreed upon in anticipation of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">successful </span>outcome of negotiations pending at<br/>
