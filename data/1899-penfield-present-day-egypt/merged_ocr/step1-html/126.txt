<span>CHAPTER IV<br/>
PARADOXICAL BUT EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">MONG </span>the nations of the earth Egypt stands<br/>
unique in history, and in unusual and <span style="color: #0000FF;">paradoxical </span>conditions. Mysterious and fascinating as<br/>
it was to Strabo and Herodotus, so it is to the<br/>
observer to-day, and especially to the winter visitor<br/>
who endeavors in a brief season to fathom its<br/>
wealth of archaeological wonders and its scheme<br/>
of political administration. This last is nearly as<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">dfffieult </span>to understand as are the hieroglyphs of the<br/>
monuments, for it has no equivalent in ancient or<br/>
modern times.<br/>
<br/>
Nominally a province of the Ottoman empire,<br/>
Egypt is autonomous, subject only to a yearly<br/>
tribute to the Sultan of about three million five<br/>
hundred thousand dollars. The title of its ruler<br/>
means sovereign, <span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span>' king, without <span style="color: #0000FF;">qualification </span>or<br/>
limitation; yet the country is in large measure<br/>
administered by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Great </span>Britain, standing in the<br/>
capacity of trustee for creditors of her own and of<br/>
several other nationalities as well. This trusteeship is voluntary on England's part, and is forced<br/>
upon the khedival government.<br/>
<br/>
The situation might not inaptly be compared<br/>
