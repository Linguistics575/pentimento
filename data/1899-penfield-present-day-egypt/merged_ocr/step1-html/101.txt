vessel rounds the great breakwater, and the traveler is actually in Egypt-the new Egypt. The<br/>
motley scene meeting the eye on getting ashore<br/>
vividly indicates the transition that is in progress<br/>
from the half-barbarism of the East to the civilization of the West, and in its <span style="color: #ff0000;">eontrasts-its </span>wealth<br/>
and its squalor, its busy new life rising like a tide<br/>
over its old <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonservatism-the </span>newcomer has a fair<br/>
symbol of the actual Egypt. Modern methods of<br/>
procedure enable you to pass the <span style="color: #0000FF;">custom-house </span>with<br/>
little loss of time, system having taken the place<br/>
of bakshish as an accelerating agent. The drive<br/>
to the hotel, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedival </span>or Abbat's, takes one<br/>

drive in the city of Alexander and Cleopatra is at<br/>
an end. The sapphire sky, <span style="color: #0000FF;">balmy </span>atmosphere, and<br/>
palm-trees overtopping the houses, tell you that<br/>
you are in Egypt; but the buildings, the shops and<br/>
their wares, suggest a city in Italy or southern<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ihanee-perhaps </span>Naples, possibly Marseilles.<br/>
<br/>
The people in the streets and their chatter affirm<br/>
that you are over the threshold of the Orient, however. There are Arabs, Turks, Syrians, Copts,<br/>
Nubians, Greeks, J ews, Armenians, Albanians,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Levantines</span>, Italians, Maltese, French, many English, some Austrians-in fact, a variety of humanity, from which a perfect congress of nations might<br/>
be drafted. The appearance of the people removes<br/>
any doubt of the whereabouts of the traveler, for it<br/>
