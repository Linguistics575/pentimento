<span>Ismail as Khedive and Exile<br/>

feathers, and orders of <span style="color: #ff0000;">chivalrymaking </span>them doubly<br/>
conspicuous. It seemed to me that the black <span style="color: #0000FF;">civilian </span>garb of a diplomatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>of the great republic harmonized with the ceremonial better than<br/>
the gorgeous costumes of the representatives of<br/>
divine-right rulers. Had a United States congressman seen the procession from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shepheard</span>'s terrace,<br/>
I am certain he would have returned to the halls<br/>
of legislation a lifelong opponent of the movement<br/>
to dress our foreign representatives in tinseled<br/>
coats and cocked hats.<br/>
<br/>
Next to the diplomatic and consular body came<br/>
the khedival ministers, and the English advisers<br/>
for finance, justice, and the interior; and then<br/>
came Khedive Abbas, walking with Ghazi Moukhtar Pasha, the Ottoman high commissioner (the<br/>
hero of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ears</span>), at his side. Following his Highness<br/>
were fully thirty princes of the khedival family.<br/>
Behind these mourners and the household of the<br/>
deceased ex-khedive, a double row of youths sprinkled perfumes and burned incense in front of the<br/>
coffin. Covered with an embroidered pall, on<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>displayed the uniform and decorations<br/>
of the deceased, the mortal remains of Ismail were<br/>
borne on the shoulders of twenty troopers from the<br/>
khedival body-guard, hard pressed by a weird<br/>
crowd of female mourners, rending the air with<br/>
their shrieks of woe. Another body of troops, with<br/>
arms reversed, closed the strange pageant.<br/>
<br/>
The ladies and women attendants of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ex-khir<br/>

had expressed their intention of following bare<br/>
