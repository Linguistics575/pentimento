rance. But to a man the army was with him, and<br/>
fifty thousand peasant farmers along the Nile were<br/>
ready to fight under his banner whenever he called<br/>
for them. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik </span>did many things to placate Arabi, which did much to turn his head. At last the<br/>
rebel leader forced the khedive to hide himself for<br/>
safety in one of his palaces near Alexandria, while<br/>
he became the dictator of the country, basing his<br/>
authority upon his military prestige. He sent lying<br/>
proclamations into the interior, and pretended to<br/>
have divine revelations pointing to a crushing <span style="color: #ff0000;">vietory </span>over the Christian oppressors of the land. It<br/>
was his boast that his guns could sink any fleet,<br/>
whatever its strength; and he assured his followers<br/>
that a hundred thousand foreign soldiers, if they<br/>
landed in Alexandria, would be hacked to pieces.<br/>
<br/>
The baselessness of Arabi's opinions was quickly<br/>
proved, for the forts of Alexandria were able to<br/>
make only feeble resistance to the modern ordnance of Admiral <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seymour</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>fleet, and were reduced<br/>
to ruins in short order, with the principal quarter<br/>
of the city as well. Arabi and his army retreated<br/>
to the interior in the wildest disorder, and only<br/>
once made anything like a determined stand against<br/>
the pursuing British regiments. That was at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Telty1-Kebir</span>, and was of brief duration. The poltroon<br/>
Arabi a few hours later was glad of the personal<br/>
safety attending his surrender to the English as a<br/>
prisoner of war.1<br/>
