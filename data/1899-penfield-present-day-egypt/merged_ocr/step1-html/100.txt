<span>CHAPTER III<br/>
ALEXANDRIA, SEAT <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>EGYPTIAN COMMERCE<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">LEXANDRIA </span>is a city with a past, truly; but<br/>
renowned as it was in the world's early history for intellectual development and political position, I regard its present-day aspect, as the one<br/>
great mart of the southern coast of the Mediterranean and <span style="color: #ff0000;">entrep√©t </span>of a nation's commerce, to be<br/>
more important still. Cairo looks old, but comparatively is not; Alexandria has the appearance<br/>
of newness, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>twelve hundred years old<br/>
before the first stone of Cairo was laid. This is<br/>
paradoxical by suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
The approach to Alexandria from the sea is not<br/>
prepossessing, and the steamer is within ten miles<br/>
or so of the harbor before any portion of the lowlying coast can be discerned. The object first seen<br/>
on the horizon, looking like a distant sail, proves to<br/>
be the Phare, the direct descendant of the earliest<br/>
lighthouse in the world. Pompey's Pillar next<br/>
comes into view on the left, followed by the dome<br/>
of Ras-el-Teen Palace, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Napoleon</span>'s windmills at Mex,<br/>
and the rising ground beyond Ramleh. By this time<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coast-line </span>is uplifted, and Alexandria is in sight.<br/>
<br/>
In half an hour the Arab pilot is on board, the<br/>
<br/>
