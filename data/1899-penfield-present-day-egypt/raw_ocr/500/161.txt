Paradoxical Administration

he can. Nevertheless, the strictly home indebted-
ness secured by farm mortgages is greater than it
should be. Some critics insist that this is certain
proof that the boasted prosperity of the country is
fictitious, and exhibit statistics to support their
argument. Critics friendly to English rule array
figures calculated to show that the aggregate do-
mestic mortgage indebtedness is very small,1ess
than forty million dollars, and that it is the pro-
prietors of fifty acres and upward who have
pledged their farms; and, further, that they have
done this only to be able to buy more land, being
confident of an appreciation of values. It is a fact,
I believe, that the proportion of petty holders bor-
rowing by mortgage is small, and they are the
people whose welfare first deserves consideration.

The recent expansion of the cultivable area being
chiefly in Upper Egypt and portions of the Nile
valley where the fertility cannot be compared to
that of Lower Egypt, there has been a correspond-
ing decrease in the average value of the acre.
When I investigated the subject five years ago, I
arrived at the conclusion that $115 was a fair esti-
mate of the value of productive Egypt, acre for
acre. Now, when the character of the newly ac-
quired extensions is considered, it is my judgment
that the average value of the 6,720,000 acres has
fallen to $105. Readers of mathematical mind, dis-
covering that the foreign bonded indebtedness on
every acre of productive soil averages $75.74, and
adding $8 for home mortgage burden (to my mind
estimated at; too low a sum), find that but little
