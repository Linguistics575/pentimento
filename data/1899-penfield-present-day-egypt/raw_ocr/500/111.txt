Alexandria, Seat of Commerce

twenty regular lines of steamers ply to and from
Alexandria; visiting men-of-war and yachts lie for
weeks at a time in the harbor, and the life and
movement are those of a great international sea-

each weighing twenty-two tons, and is perfectly
lighted. The well-protected haven, of a depth of
twenty to sixty feet, and an area of eighteen hun-

inner port of perhaps one fourth the size. The
harbor dues are considerable, but these, combined

dynasty, appareled in the Turkish costume of his
time, and astride a horse of superb proportions,
in the Place Mehemet Ali, be endowed with life,
the Great Initiator might see endless processions
of cotton-laden vehicles moving toward the docks.
If such a return to life were possible, his mind
might revert to the time when a friendly botanist

bolls, which, the savant advised the Viceroy, might
be cultivated in Egypt on a large scale with great
profit. This was the origin of cotton-culture there,
