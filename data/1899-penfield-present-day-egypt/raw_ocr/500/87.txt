In Fascinating Cairo

J uvenile pupils are taught little but the Koran.
Day after day their masters beat it into them, not
infrequently aided by a palm-branch, the Oriental
equivalent of the birch. The youngsters sway back
and forth and sidewise in concert when reciting.
The sheik, perhaps, knows less about the printed
page than the boys, but to him the Koran is so
familiar that he is able to detect the slightest error
of his class. On his part "reading,"' is a feat of
memory, and should a professor of higher grade
refer him to the book, he would most likely claim
to be suffering from weak eyes, and request a stu-
dent-teacher to read for him. The urchins are as
industrious as beavers. When far enough advanced
to write, favorite quotations from the Koran, such
as, "There is no God but God, and Mohammed is
his prophet,'' and "I testify that Mohammed is
Godâ€™s apostle,'' are given them for exercises.

An Azhar student is always under the super-
vision of the school authority. In roaming about
the streets of Cairo, should he misbehave, the police
could only detain him until an official be surn-
moned from El-Azhar to take him into custody.
This system of proctorship is in fact the same as
at the English universities of Oxford and Cam-
bridge. Because an Azhar scholar has immunity
from military service, it is suspected that many
young men are enrolled as students for no other
purpose than to escape the life of a soldier-to
most Mohammedans an undesirable calling.

In the school year there is no definite recess; but
