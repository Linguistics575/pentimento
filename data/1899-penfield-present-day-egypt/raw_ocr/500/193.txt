Expansion by Irrigation

It has been computed that more than half of the
Nile, with its priceless sediment, pours into the
Mediterranean. In other words, water and soil
enough to create many Egypts run to waste. Much
of this loss will always be inevitable, naturally.
N apoleon had no sooner seen the Nile at Cairo than

near Cairo, at the point where the Rosetta and
Damietta branches of the Nile bifurcate and their
arms inelose the Delta, was begun from plans by
Mougel Bey, a Frenchman. It took twenty-four
years to construct it, and then it was not a success,
for the first time it was tried the force of the
dammed-up water was too great for the masonry,
which really rested on a foundation of mud.

I overheard an amusing conversation one day at

ing the importance of the structure to a British

"Yes, it 's a great work,'' said he, "and these for-
