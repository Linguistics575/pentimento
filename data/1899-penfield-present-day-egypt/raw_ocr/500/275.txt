Tewfik and the Arabi Rebellion

M. de Blignitres and Major Baring from the min-
istry of finance; nor could he procure from these
controllers a single piaster for any purpose unless
they agreed with him as to the expediency of the
appropriation. Foreign intervention had not only
removed the cash-box from the custody of the khe-
dive, but commissions of liquidation and restrictive
measures had completely changed the character of
the khedival office in its transition from father to
son.

Hampered thus in the exercise of power, Tewfik
made enemies without gaining friends. The ruler
who distributes places and pensions has many eu-
logists. Tewfik Pasha was ready to eoiiperate in
doing away with extravagances and abuses; but
the alien controllers-in effect the "receivers" of
an establishment from which they wanted to ex-
tract every penny possible for their principals,
without destroying its future earning power--
effected such sweeping economies that thousands
of natives went hungry as a consequence of a stop-
page of their supplies. A people unfamiliar with
diplomatic methods of collecting overdue accounts
knew little of the significance of the dual control,
and cared less. Believing their khedive governed
Egypt, they addressed to him their petitions for
relief ; but he could give no relief, and discontent
followed as a natural consequence. A glimmer of
understanding in time coming to the people, the cry,
tt Down with the foreigners ! '' rang,' from the Medi-
terranean to the Sudan, and was echoed back with
the added cry of " Egypt for the Egyptians ! "
