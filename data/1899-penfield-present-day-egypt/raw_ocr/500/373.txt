In Egypt for Health's Sake

and thirty-five miles, yet the journey seemingly
takes one into the heart of Africa. Assuan is the
frontier of Egypt proper, the first cataract of the

discovers that martial rather than civil Jaw is in

by a week or two, many travelers there meeting

tropic of Cancer. Lacking the unique antiquarian
value of Luxor, perhaps, Assuan in these days pro-
vides many compensating attractions. It is a cen-

whose dress and customs admit of no suspicion of
being assumed for spectacular effect. Among
members of the tribe of Bischarins may be seen boys
