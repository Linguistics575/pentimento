Expansion by Irrigation

tion of Philae, and their memorials besieged the
Egyptian government for months. From every
country in Europe, from the United States, and
from the centers of learning in the East, antiqua-
rians, Egyptologists, archaeologists, and literary
people generally, joined in vigorous protest. The
late Sir Frederick Leighton, president of Er1gland's
Royal Academy, did not hesitate to say that tt any
tampering with Philae would be a lasting blot on
the British occupation of Egypt." This stinging
remark brought the subject into the realm of Brit-
ish politics, and did as much as all the protests to
cause the too practical plans of the English en-
gineers to be held in abeyance until a modified
project, coneiliating archaeological interests with
engineering necessities, could be devised.

To silence their critics, if possible, the engineers
proposed many makeshift plans, some of which
displayed surprising ingenuity. Sir Benjamin
Baker, of Manchester Canal fame, favored the rais-
ing of the island, as a whole, some twelve feet, and
offered to do it for a million dollars, guaranteeing
its safe accomplishment. Another gravely pro-
posed that the temple of Isis, pylons and a11,be
moved to a neighboring and higher island and re-
erected, and submitted a proposal for the contract.
Still another recommended building a eaisson of
masonry around the island, that would protect it
from flood, but make it necessary to descend a
flight of stairs to view the buildings, themselves so
artistic that people travel great distances to admire
them.
