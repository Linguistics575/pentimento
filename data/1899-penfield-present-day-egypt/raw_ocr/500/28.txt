Present-Day Egypt

time to close the gates of Saladin's stronghold, and
you are awakened to the fact that your table d'lufte
dinner begins in thirty minutes, and you must array
yourself in conventional evening garb before you
can partake thereof.

The suburbs have a double charm to students of
the Bible. A visit to the Shubra road, the Corso of
Cairo until fashion decreed the Ghizereh drive, at
sunset, will illustrate the scriptural allusions to the
sheep and the goats; and a pleasing picture may
there be seen of the shepherd bearing in his arms
a lamb or kid too feeble to keep pace with the
herd. The scene might have been taken from an
engraving in an old Bible. One will not proceed
far without seeing devout Moslems engaged in
eventide prayer on the housetops. The wine-skin
of old was the same as that used now by the water-
carrier, seen a hundred times a day in Cairo, ena-
bling one to comprehend the simile of new wine in
old bottles. Aged men about the mosques and
bazaars are appareled to-day as they were in Abra-
ham's time,carrying the same staves ; and the scribe,
with inkhorn and pens of reed in girdle, joins the
throng in the Khan Halil to-day, and frowns upon
the outcast J ew, as did the Pharisee upon the
publican. A few minutes' walk from the hotels
brings one face to face with the living Bible; a few
minutes' drive in another direction may bring one
face to face with the grotesque characters of a
hotel costume ball, with petits chevaux for a diver-
sion between dances. Cairo is paradoxical as well
as fascinating.
