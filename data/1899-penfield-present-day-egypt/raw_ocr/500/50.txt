Present-Day Egypt

more. In this department reside the wife or wives
and children of the master, with the addition, per-
haps, of his mother. In this case her rule is prob-
ably absolute. It is she who chooses instructresses
for the children, orders the affairs of the household,
and even prescribes the fabrics, fashions, and adorn-
ments of the women, who are simply the wives of
his Excellency the Pasha. It is mother-in-law rule,
literally. The windows of the harem usually over-
look a courtyard or rear street, and are screened
with mushrabeah lattices, penetrable only by the
gaze of a person within. To minister to the wants
of the women's division, a small army of servants--
shiny black tt slaves " from N ubia and Berber, and
possibly a fair Circassian or two, imported from
Constantinople-is essential. " Slavery" of this
sort is scarcely bondage. It is the law of Egypt
that manumission can be had for the asking, with
little circumlocution or delay. These servitors are
kindly treated, value their home, and shrink from
any movement toward legal freedom. Except to
the master and sons of the house, the harem is
closed to all men, but women friends come and go
freely. The tall, high-cheek-boned black men
guarding the entrance to the harem, in these pro-
gressive days in Egypt possessing no suggestion
of the houri scene of the stage, are trained from
childhood to keep unauthorized persons from in-
truding, and have a highly developed aversion to
sight-seers.

The howling dervish of Cairo is more or less a
fraud. Go any Friday afternopn in the Season--
