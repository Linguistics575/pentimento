Present-Day Egypt

thorough reform has yet to be accomplished in the
public service of Egypt to plac'e it on a footing by
which it might be compared with public employ-
ment in either the United States or Great Britain.

The " international " aspect of Egypt is an expen-
sive luxury, and contributes in no small measure
to the demands upon the public treasury. The
International Debt Commission, for illustration,
brings to Cairo delegates of the powers which are
the eountry's creditors. Each is paid a salary of
ten thousand dollars by the khedival government
for looking after the interests of his countrymen
fortunate enough to own Egyptian bonds, which can
be sold anywhere at a substantial premium, and
which, very likely, were purchased at a price far
below their par value. Having no voice whatever
in fixing the rate of interest, or the proportion
going to the different countries, it might occur to
the strict reformer that a competent, trustworthy
accountant could perform the service of these six
officials, with a great saving to the toiling masses
of Egypt. But the countries interested would no
more be able to agree on the nationality of such an
accountant than were the same powers in deciding
the question of nationality of the governor of Crete
after the Greco-Turkish war.

The railway system of less than fifteen hundred
miles is managed by three princely paid men, act-
ing for England, France, and Egypt. In Europe
or America a single competent man would do it all,
for a fraction of the pay, and most likely find time
hanging heavily on his hands and want more to do.
