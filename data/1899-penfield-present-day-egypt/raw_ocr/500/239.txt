Story of the Suez Canal

in which lighthouses are' maintained. Of course
this is conjecture, pure and simple. Many things
can happen in the space of seventy years, and
before 1968 conditions may prevail that no one
now foresees. The Suez Canal will doubtless be as
useful then as now, but the term "Egyptian gov-
ernment " may have a meaning foreign to that ex-
pressed by the words of the concession under which
the canal was made. There is little prospect that
this most important artery of marine travel will
ever bring substantial benefit to the Egyptian
people. Yielding an income in these times of six-
teen million dollars a year, the Egyptians would be
receiving, two million four hundred thousand dol-
lars annually from the stipulation of the concession
giving them fifteen per cent. of the gross revenue,
had not Ismail thrown away their rights in his
mad craving for money.

When United States capital and skill join the
Atlantic with the Paeifie, let the canal be our
own, under whatever guaranties of its neutrality
in time of war!
