In F ascinating Cairo

boxes for the peasantry. Not a scrap is wasted.
To discover that dates purchased at up-Nile land-
ings are packed in boxes on the bottoms of which
are impressed such legends as "Best American,''
" Standard," and " 95 Degrees Pure," may be star-
tling to fastidious tourists.

The great school of the Mohammedan world is
one of Cairo’s important sights ; but few travelers
are aware of its interest, and not one in a hundred
visits it. The Pyramids, the Sphinx, and the Nile
are too absorbing for tourists to remember that in
the same wondrous city exists the largest and old...
est university in the world-El-Azhar, meaning
“the splendid." Constantinople may be regarded
as the official head of the great religion of Islam,
but Cairo for nine hundred years has been the edu-
cational center, and if one wishes to attain the
summit of Mussulman learning he must attend the
classes of this collegiate establishment. Unless one
be familiar with Arabic and knows where to look
among musty books and manuscripts in the Egyp-
tian Library, it is very diffieult to get reliable in-
formation regarding this wonderful mosque-college.

The claim of possessing the oldest university has
often been made for Oxford, Paris, or Bologna, but
the founding of their ancient seats of Jearning is
legendary as to dates, while the records of El-Azhar
are clear from the year 975. Whether it is really
a "university'' in our meaning can be more ap-
propriately questioned. It is widely different from
Harvard and Yale, but wise men of the East have
ever termed it a university.
