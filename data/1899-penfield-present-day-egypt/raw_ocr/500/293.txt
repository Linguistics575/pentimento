Tewfik and the Arabi Rebellion

longer a political issue himself, the administration
of Egypt, owing its creation to him, becomes an in-
ternational issue, as well as an anomaly having no
parallel in history. This control of affairs, upheld
by four or five thousand British bayonets, on soil
not belonging to the British empire, is an institu-
tion over which European statesmen have long
wrangled. "Advisers'' to the khedive, under-
secretaries of state, irrigation experts, military
and civil servants of high degree and correspond-
ing, pay, and small-fry officials by the hundred,
owe their employment in the land of the Nile to
the muddle-headed Arabi, now dreaming away his
days in the hills of Ceylon. The common people
of his beloved Egypt, for whom he was so solicitous
in 1881 and 1882, are now enjoying a measure of
prosperity greater than they had ever known,
oddly enough, as a sequence of his efforts to free
them from the grasp of the infidel.

Some philosophers, maybe, see in Arabi one who
has done his share toward making Britainâ€™s foreign
policy so successful as to excite the jealousy of half
the nations of the Old World. Unlike Clive,
Hastings, and Cecil Rhodes, Arabi accomplished
what he did for England as the result of bigoted
ignorance and blundering, not of clear-sighted
intention.
