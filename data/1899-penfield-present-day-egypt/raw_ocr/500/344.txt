Present-Day Egypt

Has England educated the Egyptians to govern
themselves?

Not as yet, certainly.

England's desire to remain in Egypt could not
better be served than by making her functionaries
appear essential to the well-being of the country;
in fact, by making progress dependent upon her
administrators, accountants, and irrigation experts,
This they have surely done, and the " understudies "
of these clever servants, those who could best take
their places, are Englishmen, not Egyptians. There
are many hundred native subordinates doing the
simplest routine work, who perceive the splendid
results, but contribute thereto chiefly by their sub..
missiveness. They are not being instructed suffi-
ciently to keep Egypt from retrogressing should
they find themselves in charge of affairs.

The khedive is compelled to yield to England in
all matters connected with the choice of a ministry,
and this necessarily results in a partizan cabinet
acceptable to London. On occasions when the khe.
dive has appointed a cabinet officer without first
securing the consent of England, he has been
promptly called to account, and the menacing dis-
play in the streets of his capital of thousands of
British guns and bayonets has not abated until the
office has been filled by an Egyptian practically
named by the British government.

The real business of important executive depart-
ments in Cairo is directed by the under-secretaries
(assistant ministers), who are English, and their
utterances and plans formally receive the sanction
