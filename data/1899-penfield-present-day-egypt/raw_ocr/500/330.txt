Present-Day Egypt

The Dongola expedition, a few years since,
afforded opportunity for England to show Euro-

bringing from India several native regiments which
garrisoned Suakim and other Red Sea ports dur-

concentrated on the Upper Nile. It would not be
difficult, at any time, for Great Britain to place a
good-sized army of Indians in the Nile valley, in-
dependent of her naval position in the Mediterra-

a time. Rail connection between the Red Sea and
the Upper Nile would render this easy.

The reeonquest of the Sudan cannot, for a year
or two at least, mean that the provinces south of
Dongola are open to trade. The whole region
about Khartum, and for hundreds of miles up and
down the Nile valley, is practically depopulated
as a consequence of the years of tyranny and mis-

the peaceful pursuits of agriculture and its con-

Sudan be regarded as "open'' to the world. It
will be a long time, at all events, before the Su-
