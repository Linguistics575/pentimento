Alexandria, Seat of Commerce

Cabanel, Sichel, Grolleau, and other artists have
exercised as much license in portraying the beam
tiful woman as Shakspere and less renowned poets
have in describing her.

The means employed by the baffled queen-too
proud to return to Rome after Antony's self-
destruction, to be exhibited in the festival cele-
brating the triumph of Octavianus---to produce
death unfortunately cannot be as directly dealt with
as the question of her descent. In Alexandria:
suburbs to-day are groves of fig-trees, whose fruit,
arranged in flat baskets and covered with fig-leaves,
is sold by the roadside by native lads, as it might
have been in the time of Cleopatra. An occasional
lizard, basking in the warm sunshine on the sand,
Which scurries away when footsteps approach, may
have suggested tho asp story to a writer of long
ago, constructing a romantic epic or play. The
theory of the poisonous reptile conveyed to the
unhappy queen in a basket of figs is improbable.
Cleopatra was too experienced in Eastern ways not
to have understood the secret of poisons and have
them at hand. The brother-husband, sharing with
her the throne, had died from poison years before,
under circumstances that indicated his murderess;
and, besides, a woman of her vanity would choose
death from one of the destroying drugs known to
her, rather than from the poison of the asp, dis-
figuring in its agency of destruction.

Many thousands of Mohammedans of the lower
social grades in Alexandria, and for that matter
throughout Lower Egypt, are slaves to the hashish
