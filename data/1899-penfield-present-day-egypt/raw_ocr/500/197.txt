Expansion by Irrigation

would have been swept away had not the sluices
been quickly raised. From 1863 until it was taken
in hand by Sir Colin Moncrieff and Mr. Willcocks
in 1884, it was called upon to perform but a frac-
tion of the duty for which it was planned. By
reason of Monerieff's genius, the dam was in a few
years rendered safe, and much of the prosperity of
the Delta in these times is due to his triumph.
. If tradition be correct, Mougel Bey's quick wit
saved the Gizeh Pyramids from destruction.
When he went to Mehemet Ali to be told where
the stones for the barrage were to come from, the
Viceroy said: "You have those great useless heaps
of stone; use them up, every block if need be, for
the purpose.‚Äù The engineer, knowing what odium
would attach to his name if he agreed to this prop-
osition, asked for a few days to make calculations.
Bis autocratic master would give but one day.
When the engineer again appeared he said the
cost of transporting the stone from the Pyramids
would be greater than to quarry it anew in the
hills. "Then let the Pyramids stay, and quarry
new stone," said the tyrant, and the monuments
were saved.

The added irrigation resulting from. the Assuan
reservoir, it has been computed, will permanently
benefit Egypt fully one hundred million dollars.
A direct annual return to the revenue of two mil-
lion dollars-more than twice the sum to be paid
each year to the firm building the dam-from sale
of water and taxation on lands that will be rendered
fruitful is promised. The government will fur-
