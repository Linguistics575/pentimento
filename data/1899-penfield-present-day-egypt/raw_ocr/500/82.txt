Present-Day Egypt

Years ago it was difficult and disagreeable to view
the interior of this great school that draws scholars
from the remotest lands where the Koran is read.
Now the formalities are simple and easily complied
with, and the presence of strangers is scarcely
noticed. From the hotel quarter it is but a fifteen-
minute drive to El-Azhar. One passes through
that marvelous street of shops, the Mouski, and
turning off, forces his way through the narrow
lane known as the " Street of the Booksellers,''
where Arab workmen are binding e11rious-loolring
volumes, seated cross-legged on the floor of tiny
box-like shops, and with a surging eonglomeration
of humanity, camels, and braying donkeys passing
not two feet away. This brings one to the " Bar-
bers' Grate,‚Äù about Which are always to be seen stu-
dents having their heads so closely shaved as to
leave no suggestion of hair.

The structure, too often restored to leave any in- .
dication of the original building, surrounds a large
open court with arcades on. every side. The lofty
minarets are fine examples of Eastern art. The
pavement is of marble, much worn in places, and
everywhere polished by constant use. There are
seven entrances, each with a name as singular as
that where the barbers congregate. El-Azhar is so
surrounded by houses that very little can be seen
of it externally, and the building is almost destitute
of architectural embellishment.

The enormous square court is bordered with por-
ticos, each divided into various compartments for
the separate use of students of different nations.
