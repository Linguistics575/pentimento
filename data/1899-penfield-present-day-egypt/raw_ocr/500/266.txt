When abreast of the heroic statue of Ibrahim
Pasha, Ismail's father, in the opera square, Khedive
Abbas left the cortege, and was taken to Abdin by
carriage. The diplomatic body and many of the
Europeans left the procession at the same time,
while the thousands wended their way slowly to the
mosque of Sultan Hassan,where the usual prayers
were recited, and then to the mosque of Rafai,
opposite. There, beside the tombs of his mother and
two of his daughters, Ismail was finally laid to rest
in the mausoleum which he had designed for him..
self, but which will probably never be completed.
The foundations of the huge pile are already show-
ing signs of subsidence-a monument perhaps not
altogether inappropriate to the man whose life,
after a brief period of artificial splendor, ebbed
drearily away amid the ruins of his shattered am-
bitions. Ismail had planned to have the new Rafai
mosque eclipse in beauty and vastness the Sultan
Hassan mosque, long regarded as the most perfect
example of architecture in the Mussulman world ;
but his financial disaster interrupted the work when
only the outer walls and roof had been completed.
