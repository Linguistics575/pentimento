In Fascinating Cairo

Walk eastward from your hotel, and in five min-
utes you are in the medley of East and West. At
the post-office observe the mingling of nationalities.
A German nurse-maid, leading the little son of a
prosperous Frankish merchant, is inquiring for let-
ters at the paste restante window, and a patriarchal
sheik in silken eaftan and turban is negotiating a
money-order to send to some 11p-Nile village. With
a swagger indicating a sense of importance, Tommy
Atkins enters, pouch over shoulder, to get the
daintybi1lets-doux for the smart regiment quartered
at Abbassieh, and home letters for officers and men.
Another window is surrounded by students from
El-Azhar. One is expecting his monthly remittance
from the family in Tunis, and his ten or twenty
comrades take a keen interest in the operation of
attaching the Arabic hieroglyphics to the several
receipts demanded in case of a money-order or
registered letter.

Over the way, ranged along the iron palings of
the buildings of the Mixed Court, are the public
letter-writers, gravely imperturbable, sitting at um-
brella-shaded tables, prepared to write anything
for illiterate applicants, in any language, for a pias-
ter or two. One is preparing the soul-impassioned
letter of Bianca to her Giovanni, bac_k in Naples
or Brindisi, assuring him that she has not ceased
to love him, although separated by the turbulent
Mediterranean for more than a month. At another
table one of the professional scribes is inditing for
Youssef Mohammed a bid for clearing a canal at As-
siut, for which the government has invited tenders.
