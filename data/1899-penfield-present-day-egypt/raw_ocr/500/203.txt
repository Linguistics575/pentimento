Expansion by Irrigation

artistic beauty of the island of Phila, to be slightly
impaired, if necessary.

It is appropriate here to quote from a book writ-
ten more than thirty-five years ago by Sir Samuel
Baker. After descending the great river from
source to mouth, he wrote: tt The Nile might be so
controlled that the enormous volume of water that
now rushes uselessly into the Mediterranean might
be led through the deserts to transform them into
eotton-fields that would render England indepen-
dent of America."

The Delta of the Nile is now a great cotton-field,
and cultivation of the fiber has doubled since Eng-
land took Egypt in hand. As rapidly as science
adds area to the Delta, the soil thus rescued from
the desert is usually planted with cotton. An aver-
age year's crop is now equal to one million one
hundred thousand bales of five hundred pounds
each, and all this is sold in foreign markets at a
price two cents per pound in excess of quotations
for good American upland cotton. It is its fiber,
nearly an inch and a half long, that gives Eg:yptian
cotton its peculiar value. Great as the price is, this
is not the only advantage possessed by the fellah
cotton-grower over the planter of our Southern
States; for the magical fecundity of the Nile soil
permits the harvesting of a crop averaging five
hundredweight to the acre. This is twice what
American planters get from an acre, and the Nilot
is exempt from certain disastrous elements ever
menacing his American rival. The Egyptian has
no dread of frost, and no labor question to deal with.
