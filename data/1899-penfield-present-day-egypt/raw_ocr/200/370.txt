Present-Day Egypt

the sketeh-book or camera as El Medineh, the
capital town of the Fayum oasis. The journey
from Cairo takes the traveler through the heart of
the pyramid region, on the 'West bank of the Nile,
affording opportunity for observing at close range
nearly every pyramid of renown in the ancient
neeropolis. I am here tempted to incorporate a
gem of a poem by Professor Clinton Seollard, that
sings the praises of the Fayum in graceful but
unexaggerated language.

THE ROSE OF FAYUM

Could I pluck from the gardens of old
The fairest of flowers to behold,

And fashion a wreath for the shrine
Of the M11ses,-the deathless divine,-.
A garland I 'd weave from the bloom
Of the redolent rose of Fayum.

Still the hills with their sun-smitten crest
Tower barren and bold to the west,

Still slumbers the Lake of the Horns
'Neath the glory of luminous moms;
Still is attared the glow and the gloom
By the redolent rose of Fayum.

Arsinoii's temples are prone,

And scarce is there stone above stone
Of the palace whose grandeur and girth
Was one of the wonders of earth ,

But in triumph o'er time and the tomb
Springs the redolent rose of Fayum.
