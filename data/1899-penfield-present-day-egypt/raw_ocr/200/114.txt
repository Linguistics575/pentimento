Present-Day Egypt

vable soil, sacrificing many lives, and ruining forty
villages-and the climate of Alexandria. It was a
wicked act, hardly justified by the needs of war-
fare. It is a curious example of the irony of fate
that monster English pumps and a staff of English
ongineers-paid for by the Egyptian government
-aro given constant employment to-day in keep-
ing the salt water of Lake Mareotis within bounds,
for no engineering resource can now prevent the
percolation of the sea to the lower level of Mareotis.
Engineering skill can only keep the water from
overflowing still more valuable territory. A mil-
lion and a half tons of water are pumped back into
the Mediterranean every twenty-four hours.
Ramleh is the only residential suburb of Alex-
andria. It is easier to make the assertion than to
describe the limits of the place. It has many titular
subdivisions, but generically Ramleh may be said
to stretch along the entire sea-front from Alex-
andria to Abukir Bay, a dozen miles away.
"Ramleh" is the native word for sand, and in
this instance is applied with signal appropriate-
ness. In summer all that portion of Cairo's offieial-
dom unable to manage European leave of absence
betakes itself en masse to the hotels and villas of the
Alexandrian suburb, there to keep cool and inci-
dentally assail the humid atmosphere by invidious
comparison. Hundreds of Alexandriaâ€™s business
men reside throughout the year at Ramleh. J udges
of the international courts, consuls, fdnetionaries
of every degree, bourse operators, and J ewish and
Greek money magnates, fi11d there peaceful repose.
