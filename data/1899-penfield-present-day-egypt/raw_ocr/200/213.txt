Story of the Suez Canal

struct a ship-canal across his territory. This sol-
dier who had founded a dynasty by successive deeds
of bravery, and had butchered three or four hun-
dred Mamelukes whom he had asked to a feast,
could not have been suspected of lacking in dar-
ing; but he never fully yielded to the blandish-
ments of foreigners striving to get him interested
in isthmian canalization. His sagaeious intellect
kept him from embarking therein, save in a tenta-
tive way. The discovery in 1830, by Lieutenant
Waghorn, that the level of the two seas was nearly
identical, failed even to impress the hard-headed
Viceroy. He commissioned Linant Pasha, however,
to prepare a plan for a canal across the narrowest
part of the isthmus, from Tilreh to Suez; but
as this Frenchman accepted the survey of Bona-
parte's engineers, and discredited the statement of
Waghorn as to the level of the waters, the vice-
roy still withheld his eonfidenee from the scheme.
In 1846 he asked a board of engineers, comprising
representatives of England, France, and Austria, to
solve once for all the question of the sea-levels.
These experts confirmed the judgment of the Eng-
lishman,Waghor11; but the British member of the
board, the renowned Robert Stephenson, with his
instinct for railway-making, persuaded Mehemet
Ali to construct instead a railway from Cairo to
Suez, in connection with the line from Alexandria.
This was done, and it formed the eor1neeting-link
between Europe and the East, and brought great
profit, and no political dangers, to Egypt.
