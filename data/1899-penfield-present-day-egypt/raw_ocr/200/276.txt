Present-Day Egypt

Evidences of insubordination in the native army
were brought to public notice daily, furnishing a
theme of conversation in bazaar and palace. The
soldiers had many grievances, the arrears of pay
being the most important. Before Ismail had been
driven away, the minister of finance had even been
mobbed in the street by four hundred desperate
officers, demanding the means to supply their
families with food. On another occasion an army
officer carried a dead child in his arms to the min-
istry of finauee, praying for enough of the money
due him to provide decent burial for his little one.
When the strain to find funds to pay European
bondholders was greatest, the crops failed in Upper
Egypt, and there was much suffering, among the
populace.

Meanwhile the cry, " Egypt for the Egyptians l. "
was coming to have more than a sentimental mean-
ing. It was maturing into a menace, and one of
such force that every intelligent person in Egypt
must have recognized its possibilities. I confess
that the position of the common people, if truth-
fully described by impartial witnesses, 1sefleeted
a cruel disregard of the principles of justice and
humanity. I am certain my sympathies would
have gone to the poor Egyptians, ground to star-
vation that distant bondholders might continue to
receive an exorbitant and usurious interest.

No universal rule for redressing grievances can
be laid down, but there was a right as well as a
wrong way of attempting a rational solution of
even so complicated a situation as that prevailing
