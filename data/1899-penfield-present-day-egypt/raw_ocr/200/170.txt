Present-Day Egypt

01d Egypt is now so fairly in step with the march
of progress as to be attracting the attention of the
civilized world. Irrigation is the lever of this prog-
Tess-the irrigation of definite science, rather than
of chance or guesswork; and the move to harness
the Nile and compel it to surrender its magical
richness to the soil is a project that will be watched
by millions of students of utilitarianism. Stated
simply, it means the increase of the eo11ntry's pro-
ductive capacity by twenty-five per cent, bringing,
as it will, considerable stretches of desert soil within
the limits of cultivation, while vast sections of
land already arable will be rendered capable of pro-
ducing two, if not three, crops in the year, by hav-
ing â€œsummer water" supplied to the thirsting
ground.

As shown in another chapter, the Egypt of the
map contains more than four hundred thousand
square miles, an expanse seven times as great as
New England ; but the practical Egypt-that which
produces crops and sustains lihy--is considerably
less than the States of Massachusetts and Conmye-
ticut united. This is the ribbon-like strip of alluvial
land bordering the Nile, a few miles wide on each
side, and measuring not more than ten thousand
five hundred square miles. The extension planned,
and to be completed in the next six or eight years,
wholly by irrigation, is no less magnificent in con-
ception than the rescuing from the Libyan and
Arabian deserts of tweuty-fivis hundred square
miles, or twice the area of Rhode Island. This will
be exploitation in its truest sense, and its accom-
