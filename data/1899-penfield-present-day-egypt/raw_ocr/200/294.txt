khedivate at the age of eighteen. Estimates of his
character are never indefinite, for he is liked or dis-

of persons and events has no doubt regarding the
intractable nature of the khedive. The human mind
in time accepts as facts, concrete and unyielding,
what is heard and read for years. The unattractive
