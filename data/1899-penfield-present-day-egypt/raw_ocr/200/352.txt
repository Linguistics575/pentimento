English has never been made an official language

principles of the Code Napoleon. Steps are now
being taken, however, to have English placed on
the list of offieial languages for p1eadings,with
every prospect of securing the assent of a majority
of the governments interested in the courts. The
United States will, obviously, assist the movement.
A beginning has been made within a few months
by the admission of legal documents in English,
and by the appointment of several registrars who
understand English. Still England cannot hope to
rival France in legal matters in Egypt for many
years to come, for every young Egyptian aspiring
to the profession of law qualifies therefor at the
Cairo School of Law, maintained by the French

unpopularity of the occupation, whose benefits
would surely be obliterated and forgotten six
months after the departure of the last British
