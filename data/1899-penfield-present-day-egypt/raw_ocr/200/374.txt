African in character, and a mine of entertainment.

If not an out-and-out invalid, one is certain to

ancient kings drew the eolossal obelisks and stones
for their stupendous structures. Great humps of
rich red granite crop up through the tawny sand,
and here and there are plain traces of the methods

nearly completed obelisk, as large as the one in
New York or that in London, lies in situ as it
was hewn from the solid rock, from which it has
never been quite separated; it still bears the inci-
sions for fastening the ropes and pulleys by Which
it would have been dragged to the river, half a
mile away. Its contour is perfectly outlined by
rows of oblong holes for the insertion of blocks of
soft wood, Which would have been expanded by the
application of water, breaking the monolith from
the ledge with as much certainty as it could be
accomplished to-day by explosives. The ancient
stone-workers understood the simple secrets of
