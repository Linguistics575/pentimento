Present-Day Egypt

banks of the melancholy river rolling toward the
sea in the elot1d1ess glare of a tropical sun, to-day
as thousands of years ago, snatch every sand-bank
from the receding stream, and plant melons, beans,
and other articles of their simple diet. N at an inch
of available soil is lost; and day by day, as the
stream decreases in spring and summer, fresh rows
. of vegetables are sown upon the newly acquired
land.

In Middle and Lower Egypt, the soil, created by
the deposits of the great river and ever fertilized
by it, is perhaps the richest in the world, and is
tilled with such ease and certain results as cannot
fail to excite the envy of the traveling American.
The Egyptian peasant is by instinct at once farmer
and irrigation expert. With the rudest of wooden
plows, a mattock, and a well-sweep water-hoisting
shadoof, his labors are blessed with a success im-
possible to tillers of the soil elsewhere.

From ages before the beginnings of history down
to the reign of Mehemet Ali, all Egypt followed but
one rule of cultivation. The land was saturated in
the flood season with the fertilizing waters of the
great river, and when the flood abated the seed
was sown in the ooze, and the result was a single
harvest of great abundance. Mehemet Ali revolu-
tionized this system in the Delta. He introduced
the cultivation of cotton and sugar, and the system
of perennial irrigation Which these highly profitable
crops require.

Nature made the Delta; all that man did was
to construct the canals that distribute the water.
