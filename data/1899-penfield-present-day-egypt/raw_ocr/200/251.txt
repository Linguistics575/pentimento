Ismail as Khedive and Exile

Egypt was solvent, whereupon Ismail invited them
to appoint a commission to investigate the finaneial
condition of his country. This commission proved
his ruin; for, while it acknowledged that the coun-
try was unable to pay the rate of interest until then
demanded, and reduced it from seven to four per
cent., it likewise declared that the economic crisis
mas due wholly to the extravagance of Ismail.

To prove his good will and patriotism, the khe-
dive surrendered private estates and plantations to
the value of twenty-iive million dollars; but this
was not all that the foreign governments and bond-
holders demanded, They insisted on further MMV
rifiees, not only of a financial but also of a political
character, to Which the khedive could not agree;
whereupon they invited the aid of the Sultan, who
had always resented the spirit of independence
displayed by his powerful vessel, and obtained a
firman deposing Ismail, and placing on the throne
his eldest son,Pri11ce Tewfik. This was in the clos-
ing days of June, in 1879; and within a week of
his degradation Ismail left Egypt for Naples.

To the last, Ismail seemed unconscious of having

something out of him, they continued to push him to take their gold,
and to mortgage Egypt, to pan his state and ids private properties
up to their utmost value, renewing greedily his bonds until they
found it more advantageous to liquidate his estate. Had his been
the case of an ordinary mortal, a court of law would have reduced
the outrageous claims to fair and just proportions. But he was a
sovereign, and his creditors were the kings of Jews, or rather the
Jews of kings, and powerful enough to bring to bear the authority of
their respective governments to enforce their claims by every means
twtsilable.''-Baron de Melanie, in "Native Rulers and Foreign In-
tertereaeed'
