Present-Day Egypt

Naples or Genoa, changing at one of these ports to
a steamer of the same line, that will land passen-
gers at Port Said or Ismailia, whichever canal
station offers a favorable train to Cairo. If there
be no German Lloyd boat sailing from Genoa. or
Naples at a convenient time, there are several other
first-elass lines starting from or touching at these
ports, and one should find an available steamer
without much trouble or delay. In this way the
voyage from New York to Egypt is made with the
maximum of comfort in from sixteen to twenty
days. Every winter offers occasional excursions
by the North German Lloyd, Hamburg-American,
and French lines from New York to Alexandria di-
rect; and as travel to Egypt grows, Which it does
by leaps and bounds, the facilities for getting there
aresure to increase. A regular direct service be-
tween New York and Alexandria, during the win-
ter months at least, is almost certain to be soon
established.

The robust traveler bound for the land of the
Pyramids can disembark from his Atlantic liner in
England or France, as the case may be, catch a quick
train .to Marseilles, Brindisi, Genoa, Naples, Ven..
ice, or Triest, and be in Alexandria or Port Said in
a few.days' less time than if he went by the all..sea
route. Ibhe is willing to travel post-haste, he may
be in Oairo .in fourteen days after leaving New
York, or possibly in thirteen.
