Paradoxical Administration

tor; and the honors bestowed upon him-knight-
hood first, then a barony and peerage, and finally
the viseountship-but inadequately discharge the
debt that his government owes him. So deter-
mined is he to carry his administration of Egypt
to a triumphant termination that an offer of the
viceroyship of India, or a cabinet position in Lou-
don, has awakened no desire to leave Cairo.

Lord Oromer is defacto ruler of Egypt, the visi-
ble but tmel-sifted representative of the majesty
of Great Britain, with almost unlimited power and
authority. Dejure he is Britain's diplomatic rep-
resentative,--nothing more,-aud his exequatur is-
sues from the Sublime Porte in exactly the same
form as that of the representative of any other
government at the court of the khedive. This is
but one of the paradoxes incident to present-day
Egypt. Possessing little aptitude for accepted
formulas of diplomacy, perhaps, Lord Cromer
makes a thoroughly reliable doyen of the diplo-
matic corps, which he is because his appoint-
ment antedates that of any of his colleagues. He
cares nothing for display, detests shams, is a keen
judge of men, and selects his assistants With such
discernment that his judgment seldom errs. De-
void of a sense of humor, and unimaginative, Lord
Cromer analyzes with great care a question in
which the interests of others are concerned; and, an
opinion formed, his conclusion is bound to prevail.
Viscount Cromer is a man of marvelous industry.
