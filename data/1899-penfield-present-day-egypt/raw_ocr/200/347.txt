Britain's Position in Egypt

of their Egyptian chiefs. The native minister is
the visible and signatory power, the creative and
actual force being the English assistant. Every-
thing financial is dictated by an "adviser," as is
nearly everything judicial, and these functionaries
are British. Similarly, the ministry of the interior,
presided over by the educated and capable Egyp-
tian premier, is also largely directed by an "ad-

Lord Cromer is proud of the British assistants
who have coiiperated with him in the work of re-
habilitating Egypt, and especially pleased to in-
form inquirers that the work has been accomplished
by a body of officials not exceeding one hundred
in number-a record that we in America, new to
colonial administration, will do well to consider.
An interesting example of the way in Which
English offieials seek to carry the Egyptians with
them is afforded by some recently announced sta-
tistics. In the finamys ministry, under the strictest
British tutelage, 13 English and 513 natives are
employed; in the department of the interior, die-
tated by British rule, 62 English and 784 Egyp-
tians find employment. In the offices under inter-
national control the percentage of Britishers is very
small. For example, the staff of the mixed courts
consists of 242 Europeans (of whom 17 are British)
and 101 Egyptians. The Caisse de la Dette em-
ploys 50 Europeans (2 being British) and 10
Egyptians, and the quarantine board has 48 Euro-
pean and 19 native employees.
