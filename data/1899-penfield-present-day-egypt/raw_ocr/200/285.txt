Tewfik and the Arabi Rebellion

But I find myself drifting into a needless de-
scription of the rebellion, and the bombardment
of the forts of Alexandria on J uly 11 and 12, 1882,

service. The next day two squadrons of British cavalry reached
Cairo. They had ridden straight across the desert, some fortymiles,
and both men and horses were nearly dead from fatigue; yet the
citadel and city, though occupied by a strong body of Arabi's troops,
surrendered without a show of resistance. The 'rebellion' was at
