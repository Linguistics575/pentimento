THE EXPANSION OF Pnonucm'}: EGYPT BY IRRIGATION

BE most interesting page in the modem his-
tory of Egypt is that which records the de-
velopment of seientifie irrigation.

Coincident with the preparation of this volume
for publication, one of the most stupendous en-
gineering feats ever undertaken by man is being
executed on the Egyptian frontier, having for its
purpose the pending back into Nubia of a body

ney to Abu-Simbel and WadyWalfa,--by means
of a great dam across the Nile at Assuan. The
Pyramids and the Sphinx have borne testimony
through the centuries to the grandeur and power of
execution which dwelt within the Nile valley; and
what more fitting now than that the séme valley
should be the theater of a gigantic engineering ex-
ploit, audacious perhaps, but certain of success, and
ministering to man’s necessities, rather than to his
vanity'.

As a wholesale rearrangement of nature's surface
