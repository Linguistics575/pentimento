Present-Day Egypt

and that her complexion Was as fair as that of any
Athenian belle to-day. The erudite Greek gets out
his Plutareh--tho best-known historian coeval with
Cleopatra, and who must have seen her or talked
with those knowing her-and points to chapters
leaving as little doubt of the purity of her Greek
blood as of her charm of person and conversation.

The Denderah sculptures when analyzed, the
erudite champion maintains with every show of
reason, portray a face whose outline and charac-
teristics are unmistakably Greek. Were the temple
of Denderah not situated near the Nubian frontier,
no logical examiner could ever have found a sug-
gestion in the portraits that the queen was negroid.
The shape of the nose proves to the contrary, and
the bust of Cleopatra in the Capitol at Rome sup-
ports the assertion. Furthermore, the Egyptian
sculptors did not attempt to idealize. They sculp-
tured with honest fidelity the faces they saw. In
these up-Nile portraits the consummate mistress
of the art of fascination wears a winning smile, but
the figure of the queen is distorted.

Painters, poets, novelists, writers of dramas,
and actresses seem ever to have had in mind the
idea that Cleopatra was a half-easte, in whom the
charms of Europe and Africa were combined, a W0-
man who ruled the world with the intellect of a
thinker directing the arts of an odalisk. It requires
little investigation, on the contrary, to learn that
the great queen was, as her name suggests, a Greek
of the Greeks, of pure and illustrious descent, and
not an African. Géréme, Picou, Alma-Tadema,
