In Egypt for Health's Stake

and thire-five miles, yet the journey seemingly
takes one into the heart of Africa. Assuan is the
frontier of Egypt proper, the first cataract of the

tropic of Cancer. Lacking the unique antiquarian
value of Luxor, perhaps, Assuan in these days pro-
vides many compensating attractions. It is a cen-
