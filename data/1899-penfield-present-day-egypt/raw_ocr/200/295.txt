The Present Khedival Family

that he would like to guide unaided the government
of which he is the titular head. This is an expe-
dient of the moment, defensible, possibly, because
patriotic. But when the young Egyptian is forced
to repress his desire to rule over his people, subject
only to his suzerain, the newspapers forget to neu-
tralize the harsh things said of him in their zeal to
promote Britain's foreign interests. It seldom oe-
curs to English journalists that Abbas, too, knows
the meaning of the words "fair play."

This young man, the seventh of the Mehemet Ali
line to be at the head of the Egyptian people,
makes no pretension to unusual wisdom; yet his
capabilities are of an order making of him a not
unworthy successor to the Pharaohs and Ptolemies,
Alexander and Cleopatra. He lacks some of the
amiable characteristics of his father, Khedive Tew-
tik, it is true ; but he is incomparablybetter qualified
for successful administrative work. English people
approved of Tewfik Pasha, but that khedive never
aroused their angerby expressing wishes oropinions.
Be was pliable as clay in the strong British grasp.

Abbas's faults are neither numerous nor serious.
Bis good qualities exceed in number those possessed
by the average prince of his years and experience.
The sentiment of patriotism is one that justly
claims respect, and that he should desire to be free
from foreign tutelage is natural enough. To learn
his true character and arrive at a just conclusion of
his worth, he must be measured at home, since the
opinions spread before readers of English news-
papers and books are scarcely ingeuuous.
