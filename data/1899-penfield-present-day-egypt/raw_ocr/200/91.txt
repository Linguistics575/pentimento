The fame of the Bulak collection became world-
wide with the transfer from Dér el-Bahari of the
mummies of Rameses the Great and many of his
royal predecessors and successors. The storing of
these priceless objects in the trumpery Bulak build-
ings, small and inflammable, awakened the govern-

collection was moved across the Nile to the palace
of Gizeh. There, in a few years, it grew with such
rapidity, through the frequent finds of valuable
sarcophagi, statues, papyri, and stelte, that a popu-
lar demand for a fire-proof structure arose, and in
1897 the khedive laid with much ceremony the
corner-stone of a great building near Kasr el-Nil, in
Cairo, where the bodies of the kings, the antiquities,
the wonderful jewelry unearthed a few years since
at Dashur,-equal in design and finish to anything
a Tiffany of to-day can fashion,-and all the mar-
velous articles, will be deposited, there to remain,
it is hoped, forever. The building will be a fitting
monument to the labors of Mariette, Maspéro, Gré-
baut, the two Brugsches, and De Morgan.

height is daily chanted through the streets, until it
reaches sixteen cubits on the ancient Nilometer at
the southern end of the island of Roda. This mark
reached, the Khalig el-Masri, the old canal that
flows through the heart of Cairo, is opened. Up
