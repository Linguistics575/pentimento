Present-Day Egypt

restoration of Egypt to admitted prosperity, conse-
quently, at a period when shrinkage in prices of
cotton, sugar, and grain has been very great, must
be regarded as a conspicuous triumph. Khedive
Abbas and his eo-workers have much to accomplish

per cent. of the gross receipts are applied to operat-
ing expenses. Native 1abor,moderate speed of or-
dinary trains, and a rainless and frostless climate
make this possible. The state lines carry now up-
ward of ten million passengers in a year, and the
receipts from all sources are not far from nine mil,
lion dollars annually. By reason of the important
reduction of fares, previously spoken of, the num-
ber of passengers has been doubled in a few years.
All-rail travel from the Mediterranean to the first
cataract of the Nile has been possible for nearly a
year. From Luxor southward the railway is nar-
row-gage, harmonizing with the lines building in
the Sudan for military purposes.

In an average year the pleasure- and health-seekers,

estimated that in a good season half this sum is
left behind by Americans.
