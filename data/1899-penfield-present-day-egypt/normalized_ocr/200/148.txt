Present-Day Egypt

This burden, applying to a community purely
agricultural, where manual labor is worth from
fifteen to twenty cents a day, and to a tillable area
estimated at ten thousand fivis hundred square
miles, is almost overpowering. It means a per
capita debt of $ 52.20, accepting the late official een-
sus to be correct. The count of 1882 showed the
indebtedness to be $ 72.70, but the last census aids
England's desire to make a statistical showing of
progress. The too liberal inclusion of desert-
dwellers and Sudanese in the statement of popu-
lation has little real bearing upon the condition
of the agricultural native. But, accepting the pro
rata debt as $ 52.20, that obligation of the Nilot is
more than the present or half a dozen generations
can discharge. Even the Turk or the Greek
does not owe as much. Frenchmen and English-
men owe considerably more than the Egyptians,
but their resources and earning capacity are incom-
parably greater, and their creditors are their own
countrypeople. The public debt of the United
States, recently emerged from a costly foreign war,
shows a per capita obligation of only about $ 19.

Egyptian securities ruled very low in the year of
the Arabi rebellion, and the year following, in
Which occurred the fiaseo in the Sudan. "Uni-
fledsn for a time were quoted at 461, and an aver-
age price for months for nearly every class of
Egyptian securities was 50, meaning that prudent
investors would give only half its face value for the
bonded debt of Egypt. It has never been possible
to determine the nationality of holders of Egyptian
