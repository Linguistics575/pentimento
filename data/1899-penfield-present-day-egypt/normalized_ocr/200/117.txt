Alexandria, Seat of Commerce

A primitive line of railway, owned by Englishmen
and very profitable, sets down passengers at several
stations. Mustapha Pasha station accommodates
the British soldiers housed in the old khedival
palace, and St. Stephano station is the objective
point of the haut ton going to spend an evening at
the casino, or have a cooling swim in the Mediter-
ranean. When Alexandrians desire to celebrate,
singly or collectively, they go to the Ramleh casino,
and do it well. Pashas and others having no need
for observing regularity of hours in town drive
back and forth on the splendid road patronized by
his Highness the Khedive when he passes to and
fro between Montazah and Ras-el-Teen Palace.

Besides being very convenient, this Egyptian
Long Branch is exceedingly pleasant at all times.
The blue sea, stretching to the horizon, is ever
soothing to exhausted nerves, and in summer bears
a refreshing inshore breeze with commendable regu-
larity. In the mad race to get away from Egypt in
the early summer, hundreds of people go farther
and fare worse than if contenting themselves with
the easily attainable comforts of Ramleh.

Abukir possesses resources of interest amply
rewarding a visit to this place where history has
been made, not to inspect the insignificant village,
but to view the bay where one of the greatest
of naval engagements was contested. The semicir-
cular bay is surrounded by obsolete forts and earth-
works, many of whose guns are dismantled, and all
of a type long ago discarded. A pleasant half-day
may be passed about these forts, withdunch-basket
