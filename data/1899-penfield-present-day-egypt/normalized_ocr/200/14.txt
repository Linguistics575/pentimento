Preface

the Egyptologist, antiquarian, nor historian: these
are favored already with a bibliography straming
the shelves of every library. Aiming at being a dis-
cursive budget of information and eomment, -
social, political, economic, and administrative, -
the volume presents a series of faithful pictures
of the Egypt that is interesting to the winter
visitor, health-seeker, and general reader, desirous
of learning something, and not too much, of COO-
temporary conditions in the oldest country in the
world. "Present-Day Egypt" is written in no par-
tial or partizan spirit, and advances no theory of
the purpose of the Pyramids, nor attempts to ex-
plain the riddle of the Sphinx.
