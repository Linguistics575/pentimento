Present-Day Egypt

other country that I have knowledge of.

The present census gives to the practical Egypt
a population averaging nine hundred and twenty-

It will no doubt surprise most readers of this
volume to learn that a fair estimate of the value of
Egypt's ten thousand five hundred square miles of
cultivable territory is $ 105 an acre. It is a fact, as

something in excess of $ 4 per acre. These vital
statistics are repeated here to 1refleet in its fullest
importance what the building of the great dam at
Assuan means to the people of Egypt. In the cir-
