Tewfik and the Arabi Rebellion

By the old system, with each side issuing a proela-
mation almost daily to the other, the patient-was
in danger of succumbing while the rival physicians
were deciding Which should take the responsibility
of going to his relief.

During the bombardment Iewflk was in his pal-
ace three miles out of Alexandria, with his wife.
When urged before the shelling of the city to seek
shelter on his yacht or on a war-ship, his answer
was: "No. I will remain with my people in their
hour of danger. I am still their khedive." Within
range of shots from the ships in tho harbor, and
with a bloodthirsty, looting mob near by, Tewfik
remained in his Ramleh palace throughout the
two days of carnage. Shortly after the crushing
of Arabi, cholera broke out in Cairo in its most fatal
form. Then this man who had failed to nip a re-
bellion in the bud by a commanding word to Arabi
went deliberately with his khedivah to the capital,
against the advice of his suite, and to the dismay
of the physicians. He went from hospital to hos.
pital, inspiring courage throughout tho stricken
city by his example, and helping the bereaved with
money from a purse not overflowing.

Called to a heritage of bankruptcy, discontent,
and rebellion, Tewfik Pasha was a virtuous and
amiable prince, whose failings inspired sympathy.
He regretted the ravages of cholera in Cairo and
the Delta more than the losing to the Mahdi of
millions of miles of valuable territory in the Sudan,
ehieily because he had witnessed the horrors of the
home calamity, possibly.
