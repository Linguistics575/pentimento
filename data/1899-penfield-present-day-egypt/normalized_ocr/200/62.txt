CHAPTER II
IN FASCDIATING CAIRO (Continued)

PROOF of the claim that Cairo is being Euro..
peanized at an 11nealled-for pace is suggested
by innumerable shop-signs of cigarette-makers,
announcing that they are "Purveyors to Bis High-
ness the JChedive," When that potentate is known to
use tobacco in no form; another is the ostentatious
advertisement of a barbering establishment that its
keeper is "Hair-dresser to the Bight Honorable
Diplomatic Agent of Great Britain, by Appoint-
ment," when it is seen that the gentleman referred
to has little need for tonsorial attentions. If these
petty dishonesties fail to convince one that the
Egyptian capital is adopting European ways and
customs, the "Want to go shootin' tudayt" or the
"Want anytlingt" -the latter coverin g a multitude
of sins, -that will be whispered in the stranger's ear
by native vagabonds a dozen times in the course
of a stroll in the Sharia Kaine ] or the Esbekieh
Gardens, surely will; and the side-spring "Con-
gress "boots, made of q11esiionablo leather, and the
ulsters and other English clothes of impossible check
or plaid, disfiguring the windows and fronts of shops
in the Mouski, will painfully accentuate the fact.
