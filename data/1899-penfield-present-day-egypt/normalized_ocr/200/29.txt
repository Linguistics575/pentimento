In Fascinating Cairo

Walk eastward from your hotel, and in five min..
utes pm are in the medley of East and West. At
the post-office observe the mingling of nationalities.
A German nurse-maid, leading the little son of a
prosperous Frankish merchant, is inquiring for let-
ters at the paste restante window, and a patriarchal
sheik in silken caftan and turban is negotiating a
money-order to send to some up-Nile village. With
a swagger indicating a sense of importance, Tommy
Atkins enters, pouch over shoulder, to get the
daintybillets-doux for the smart regimentquartered
at Abbassieh, and home letters for officers and men.
Another window is surrounded by students from
El-Azhar. One is expecting his monthly remittance
from the family in Tunis, and his ten or twenty
comrades take a keen interest in the operation of
attaching the Arabic hieroglyphics to the several
receipts demanded in case of a money-order or
registered letter.

Over the way, ranged along the iron palings of
the buildings of the Mixed Court, are the public
letter-writers, gravely imperturbable, sitting at um-
brella-shaded tables, prepared to write anything
for illiterate applicants, in any language, for a pias-
ter or two. One is preparing the soul-impassioned
letter of Bianca to her Giovanni, back in Naples
or Brindisi, assuring him that she has not ceased
to love him, although separated by the turbulent
Mediterranean for more than a month. At another
table one of the professional scribes is inditing for
Youssef Mohammed a bid for clearing a canal at As.
siut, for Which the government has invited tenders.
