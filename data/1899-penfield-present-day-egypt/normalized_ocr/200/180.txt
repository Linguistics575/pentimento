Present-Day Egypt

The proposal to remove Philse stone by stone
was too fantastic even for the pen of a J ules Verne.
An American writer suggested that if Philays won-
drous structures were to be disturbed at all, they
should be floated six hundred miles down the Nile
and reiireeted in Cairo. This, the writer urged,
would bring to the doors of the tourists' hotels one
of Egypt's greatest attractions, and carry business
enterprise to its utmost extent. This bit of sarcasm
had its effect.

The publicity given to these absurd proposals
caused scholarly Europe and America again to pro-
test against the threatened vandalism, and a tor-
rent of newspaper invective was hurled at Britain's
rule of Egyptian affairs, whieh threatened to destroy
one of the world's most precious gems in order
that European holders of Egyptian bonds might be
more certain of their interest and security. The
reservoir project was now in danger of drifting into
European politics, and it was wisely concluded in
Cairo and London to let the matter drop from pub-
lie notice for a few years.

tt What is a useless templs, n asked engineers, "in
comparison with a work involving the' welfare of
millions of human beings t ""Are sordid commer-
cial motives," replied archaeologists, "to override
everything artistic in the world, and is a priceless
monument of antiquity to be lost to civilization
that a few more fellaheen, already prosperous, may
grow more cotton and sugar and graint" "Why
must the Philistine come to Philae atal1t" inquired
sentimentalists everywhere.
