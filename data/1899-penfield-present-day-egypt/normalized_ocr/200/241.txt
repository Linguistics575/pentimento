Ismail as Khedive and Exile

generosities were as magnifieer1t as his vices, and
he consulted neither law 1101' reason in discharging
his khedival prerogative, for he was a law unto
himself.

When General Sherman informed him that
American military men could give Egypt a capable
army, he brought thirty or forty of these specialists
to the country and paid them lavishly, instead of
fifteen or twenty as advised by the great general.
When Ismail sent a wedding-gift of a handful of
diamonds to General Sherman's daughter, later on,
the value of the dazzling jewels was found to be so
great that the limited Sherman fortune was men-
aced by the New York customs collector. Asked
to present an obelisk to New York's Central Park,
Ismail promptly authorized the removal from
Egypt of the monolith of red syenite granite that
J ulius Caasar had brought from Heliopolis to
adorn the approach to the Caesarean temple in
Alexandria, forgetful of the fact that it was covered
with hieroglyphs of the reigns of Thothmes III,
Rameses the Great, and Seti II, that it antedated
the Christian era fully twelve centuries, and was
for other reasons an object of priceless value to
students of Egyptology. But there was nothing
petty about Ismail, and when he admired a nation
as he did the American, he would have given away
a pyramid with as little concern as he would a
blooded horse from his stable.

Ismail was born in Cairo on the last day of the
year 1830, and died on March 2, 1895. Bis father
was the warrior son of Mehemet Ali, Ibrahim
