Present-Day E gypt

Pasha to Ismailia, and Tewfik Pasha to Port Tew-
fik, nothing in Egypt beyond a public square in
Port Said bears the name of De Lesseps. The
Suez company is erecting a bronze statue at Port
Said of the author of the canal, modeled by M.
Fr√©miet; but as the appropriation for this was
paltry, its importance cannot be deemed commen-
surate with the achievement it is planned to com-
memorate. At the opening of the canal everybody
expected that some distinction would be conferred
on De Lesseps, the general opinion being that he
would be created Due de Suez; and astonishment
was felt at his being merely given the grand cordon

two thirds of the year. Both piers were constructed of blocks of
artiiieial stone, manufactured of seven parts of sand from the desert
and one part of hydraulic lime imported from France. The concrete
was mixed by machinery and poured into large wooden molds, in
which it remained for several weeks. The molds were then WV
moved, and the blocks exposed to the air to harden more thor-
oughly. Each block weighed twenty tons, and thirty of them were
manufactured daily. In all twenty-tive thousand were required.
Above the wooden molds, which covered an extensive piece of
ground, was constructed a railway, bearing a stoam-emuus, which
could be moved to any required spot, for the purpose of hoisting the
blocks and conveying them to their destination. After having been
hoisted by the crane, the blocks were transported to a boat, where
they were placed on an inclined plane in twos and threes, and se-
cured by means of wedges. They were then conveyed to the place
where they were to be sunk, the wedges were removed, and the
huge masses slid down the incline, splitting the wood and emit-
ting sparks of tire on their way, and plunged into the water with a
tremendous splash, whi1e the boat staggered from the effoets of the
shock and was lashed by the waves thus artifieiMly caused. These
huge pierres perdues, as they were technically celled, were thus
gradually heaped up until they reached the surface, and the last
layere, -rising a little above the level of the water, were finally de-
positedlby means of a crane erected on a steamboat.
