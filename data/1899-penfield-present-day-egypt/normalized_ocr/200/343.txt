Britain's Position in Egypt

ment, to defray the cost of the military campaign
resulting in the loss of the Sudan, for the recent
reconquest of the Sudan provinces, and for certain
public works deemed imperatively necessary.

By her management of affairs England has,
nevertheless, so improved the conditions in Egypt
that European bondholders have been satisfied to
have the interest on their bonds reduced from seven
to three and a half or four per cent.

England possesses a capacity for conducting
colonies and rehabilitating run-down countries
which amounts almost to genius. Overbearing and
arrogant as the British functionary out of England
often appears to be, he must be scrupulously hon-
est and generally capable to find a place in the
perfectly organized machinery guided from Lon-
don. Frenchmen say that Egypt's restoration to
prosperity could have been better accomplished
by them, and some allege that this prosperity is
more apparent than real, charging that much is
neglected in the desire to make a favorable show-
ing in the yearly balance-sheet. But a frank
investigation of what France does with her own
dependencies, nearly every one of Which is run at
a loss, gives support to the belief that Egypt is
better off under British guidance than she could be
under that of France. No alien power could have
done better in Egypt than Great Britain has. But
her critics claim to recognize scant justification for
Britaia's absorption of the country of the khedive
merely because of her ability to do good work
there, and point to the glaring flaw in her title.
