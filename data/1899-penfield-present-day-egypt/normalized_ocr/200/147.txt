Since the year 1886 the finanees of Egypt have
improved to an extent emphasizing the nation's
emergence from practical bankruptcy to an envi-
able condition of credit to be found in the history
of bat few countries. So marked was the improve-

of its external debt, thereby scaling the rate of in..
terest in some instances nearly half. Although
Egypt's burden of interest has thus been greatly de-
creased, yet the country has still to find nearly nine-

almost every foot of the soil utilized, it would not be possible for
928 persons to the square mile to be supported. And, further, it
should be borne in mind that the offieial census fixing Egypt's popu-
lntinn at 9,700,000 included many Bedouin tribes and other desert-
dwellers, and was further swollen by the inclusion of many Nubians
who had left their southern provinces and crossed the frontier into
Egypt.
