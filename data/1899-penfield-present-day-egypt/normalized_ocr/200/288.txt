Present-Day Egypt

Tewfik preferred the early morning for work, and
documents dealing with public affairs were then
read and arranged before his secretaries were astir.
He always varied his labors with outdoor exercise,
and many were the anecdotes related by him of the
experiences with soldiers and policemen who did
not recognize as the khedive the sleek, rotund
little man taking a morning constitutional. He
frequently slipped over to the Ghizereh gardens
at sunrise to view the horticultural beauties when
only the fellah was astir. Returning to the palace
from one of these rambles, he was stopped by a
goodmatared British soldier doing sentry duty at
the main entrance, with these words: "Hi, there!
Yer can't go in'ere, yer know."

"But I belong to the palace," said the khedive,
enjoying the situation.

"Oh, do yert Well, what sort of a place'ave yer
got, anyway'." added Tommy Atkins, convinced
of his right to have a bit of ehaff with any "furri-
ner."

"Very good."

"Ah, fine times, I s'pose; nothin' to do and
plenty to eat, from the look o' yer. Wouldn't mind
servin' this chap meself, if'e'd find me five bob a
day."

A sergeant on his rounds cut short the soldier's
lingo, and his Highness went into the palace to his
books and papers, enjoying the joke more than the
diseomtited redeoat did.
