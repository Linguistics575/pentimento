Present-Day Egypt

the government employs every means for keeping
it out of Egypt. Hundreds of miles of littoral to
the west and east of Alexandria, that, Were it not

are systematically patrolled by eoast-guardsmen,
and every foot of the Suez Canal is similarly under
surveillance; while port authorities at Alexandria,
Rosetta, Damietta, and Port Said expend more

regularly supplied. It is manufactured in many
out-of-the-way places in the eastern Mediterranean,
and its excessive value, once within reach of its
devotees in Egypt, is enough to compensate those
concerned in the trade for the occasional eontisea-
