The Present Khedival Family

the governor-general's at Algiers, so often painted
by great artists, and is claimed to be a pageant
equal to the viceroyal ball at Calcutta. The khe-
divers annual ball occurs usually in J anuary or
February, and brings together representative types
of nearly every race of Europe, Africa, and Asia,
with a very liberal sprinkling of Americans.
Conspicuous in the medley of brilliant uniforms
are those of diplomatic celebrities and the leaders
of the Egyptian army and the army of occupation,
glittering with orders. There are present offieials
of every hue of countenance, including mudirs and
omdehs from distant Egyptian provinces, Bedouin
sheiks from the Red Sea coast, and perhaps Indian
princes breaking their journey to or from England
for a few weeks' participation in the gaieties of the
khedival city. Abbas Pashats hostship elicits gen-
eral admiration. He receives those hidden to the
festivity with a graceful cordiality, and makes a
point of displaying his gallantry to the ladies of the
diplomatic corps, whose pleasant duty it is to stand
by his side and receive with him. The dancing
begun, he appears to find much satisfaction in
Watching the moving, figures in one of the most
beautiful ball-rooms in the world. A box of gener-
ous proportions, duly screened, is filled'with the
ladies of the khedival family, who watch the bril-
liant scene, 11npereeived by those participating in
it. The supper is a liberal education in gastronomy.
