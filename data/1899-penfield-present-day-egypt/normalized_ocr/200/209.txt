Story of the Suez Canal

fourteen centuries before the Christian era, cut a
canal fifty-seven miles long, from Bubastis, near
the present town of Zagazig, on the Pelusiae branch
of the Nile, to Heroopolis, at the head of the Bitter
Lakes, then forming the northern extremity of the
Gulf of Suez. Eight hundred years later, says
Herodotus, the second Neeho gave his attention to
canal-building, persevering in the task until one
hundred and twenty thousand lives had been sac-

oracle he consulted told him that dire results would
follow the completion of his labors, and Egypt be
surrendered to barbarians-or, in other words, the
making of a canal would so entangle the Egyptians
with foreign interests that their safety would be
imperiled. A century later came the Persian
Darius, son of Hystaspes, who took up the work
abandoned by Necho; but being assured by cer-
tain wise men that the land would be deluged, he
gave up the task when near its completion.
Traces of Neeho's canal, so archaeologists claim, are
still distinguishable near the southern end of the
Bitter Lakes. The project of Necho, as well as
that of Darius, involved the transhipment of cargo
at Heroopolis, and each was unsatisfactory for
other reasons. To remedy these defects, Ptolemy
Philadelphus, in B. c. 285, joined the Nile canal with
the Heroopolite Gulf by means of locks, opening
when a vessel wished to pass. The southern ter-
minus of this waterway Was at Arsinoii, near the
Suez of to-day. The failure of Cleopatra's ships to
escape through this canal into the Red Sea, two
