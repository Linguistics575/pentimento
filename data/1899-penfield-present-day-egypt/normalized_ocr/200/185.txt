Expansion by Irrigation

Way back to their steamers or hotel at Assuan.
The making of the dam will force the nude popula-
tion of the region to prosecute their amphibious
pursuits elsewhere-most likely in eddying rapids
farther down-stream. But the daring soul who has
"shot" what will remain of the cataract will, as of
old, be landed on the bank at Assuan to the re-
sounding "Heep, heep, hooray! Zank you, zank
you I n of his crew of black rowers, whom he will
liberally bakshish while yet believing himself a
hero.

The American sun-seeker or English milord,
making the voyage to Wady-Halfa by his own
dahabiyeh, will no longer have his craft hauled up
the Assuan cataract by a hundred shrieking Arabs
and Berberins, for most likely it will be taken up
the rapids and through the locks by electricity
generated by the rushing Nile itself. Indeed, a
practical Britisher is in the field for utilizing the
eataraet's force for electrically lighting Assnan and
propelling irrigating machinery for a hundred miles
or more down-stream, to the possible relief of the
familiar shadoof and creaking sakieh.

The Assuan structure will differ in several re-
spects from any great dam hitherto built. In
the first place, none for impounding water has
ever been made on any river approaching the size
of the Nile; and, in the second plaee, it is to be
both dam and waterway, a conjunction exceedingly
difficult to effect. To eordine Father Nile in flood-
time would be hopeless, and therefore the river
mast be allowed to run unimpeded through the dam
