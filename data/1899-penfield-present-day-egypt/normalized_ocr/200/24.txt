Present-Day Egypt

as the pilgrimage of good Mohammedans to Mecca.
The Moharnnyedans' religion takes them but once to
the sacred city of the prophet, but pleasure draws
those favored by fortune to the Nile capital time
after time. Cairo is more than interesting: it is
fascinating. The antiquarian, the student, and the
savant have always been at home there; and the
invalid-real or imiginary-seeking a climate, finds
in and about the khedival city the superlative of
air and temperature.

Artists never weary of reproducing Cairo's pie-
turesque scenes and vivid colorings. The other
of the skies, the splendor of the setting sun, the
Turneresque afterglow, and the delicate browns of
the desert, can be best suggested in water-colors,
for, like Venice, Egypt demands a master hand in
oils.

The traveler of impressionable nature yields to
the fascination of Cairo's quaint Eastern life, as
perfect as if met far beyond the Orient's threshold,
and doubly satisfying, because found within a half-.
hour of the creature comforts of hotels eonspieu-
ously modern. To walk the streets of an Oriental
capital wherein history has been made, between
meals, as it were, and delve by day in museums
and mosques perpetuating a mysterious past, and
dine de rigueur in the evening, with the best music
of Europe at hand, explains a charm that Cairo has
for mortals liking to witness Eastern life provided
they are not compelled to become a part of it. If
Egypt disappoints, the indecisive idler can in four
or five days be back in Paris or on the Riviera.
