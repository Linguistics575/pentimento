CHAPTER IV
PARADOXICAL BUT EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION

Ae,',.? , the nations of the earth Egypt stands
unique in history, and in unusual and para-
doxieal conditions. Mysterious and fascinating as
it was to Strabo and Herodotus, so it is to the
observer to-day, and especially to the winter visitor
who endeavors in a brief season to fathom its
wealth of archaeological wonders and its scheme
of political administration. This last is nearly as
diffieult to understand as are the hieroglyphs of the
monuments, for it has no equivalent in ancient or
modern times.

Nominally a province of the Ottoman empire,
Egypt is autonomous, subject only to a yearly
tribute to the Sultan of about three million five
hundred thousand dollars. The title of its ruler
means sovereign, 01' king, without qualifieation or
limitation; yet the country is in large measure
administered by Great Britain, standing in the
capacity of trustee for creditors of her own and of
several other nationalities as well. This trustee-
ship is voluntary on England's part, and is forced
upon the khedival government.

The situation might not inaptly be compared
