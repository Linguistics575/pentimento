Present-Day Egypt

by engineering skill; and as a building achievement
the scheme is on a scale worthy of a Rameses or a
Pharaoh. To create in the midst of the African
desert a lake having possibly three times the su-
perfieial area of Lake Geneva in Switzerland, and
control it with seientifie precision, so that the im-
pounded flood may be turned into distant channels
at will, is a comprehensive undertaking. But the
engineers claim that their plans can be carried out
to the letter; they have estimated the exact cost of
the dam, computed almost to the gallon the volume
of water that will be imprisoned, and figured the
necessary resistance to be provided at every point
of the masonry. In Cairo, the experts of the min-
istries of public works and finauee, likewise, have
calculated to a nieety the sum from taxation that
will come into the public treasury through the
country's augmented produetiveness.

Subordinate to the great dam, a smaller one, not
unlike the barrage at the apex of the Delta, ten
miles to the north of Cairo, is to be made at As-
siut. Its function will be to give sufficient head to
the river to force the water into the system of irri-
gation canals that veins hundreds of thousands of
acres between Assiut and Cairo. The completion
of the Cairo barrage so developed eottor1-eult11ro as
to add to the public revenue of the country at least
ten million dollars annually. It may safely be con-
eluded that the Assuan reservoir is but one of a
series Which will in time be constructed south-
ward to Berber, Khartum, and perhaps the Victoria
Nyanza. The re√©stablishment of khedival author-
