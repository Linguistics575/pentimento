Alexandria, Seat of Commerce

soldiers of the shattered Turkish supremacy in
Egypt, who had retired with sulky scorn from
Alexandria to a quarter of their own, on what once
was the island of Pharos, Mehemet Ali united them
with his Albanian troops, and found he had then
the unbreakable backbone of an army of fighters,
few in number, it is true, but suffieiently powerful

ing at Cairo. The fearless Rumelian then organized
the Egyptian people ,--Arabs and Nilots, -arld by
sheer genius welded into something, approaching a
nationality these discordant elements. The renais-
sance of Egypt and the revival of Alexandria's
fortunes date, consequently, from the coming of
Mehemet Ali. He loved the city and made it his
capital.

known as the Mahmudiyeh Canal. Thirty thou-
sand of the peasants died before the canal was
completed, but it brought fresh water and a nation's
commerce to Alexandria.

ing palaces, he improved the harbor and erected
warehouses, docks, a dry-doek, and an arsenal. To
accomplish these things, and to develop irrigation
in the Delta, he had the assistance of Linaut Pasha
