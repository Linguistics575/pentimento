was minister of foreign affairs, and. united in a
report recommending the scheme. This was signed
by the representatives of the United States, Aus-
tria, Germany, England, France, Russia, and Italy.
At subsequent conventions Belgium, Spain, Hol-
land, Greece, Portugal, Denmark, and Sweden-
Norway approved the plan. On June 28, 1875,
Khedive Ismail inaugurated the court at Alexan-
dria, although it was not until February I, 1876,
that the new system of jurisprudence was actually
launched.

The procedure is practically that of France, the
Code N apol√©on, modified to suit the circumstances
of a country where local customs and religious ob-
ligations must be respected. The jurisdiction is
stated in this extract from the code itself:

"The new tribunals shall have cognizance of all
controversies in matters civil or commercial be-
tween natives and foreigners, or between foreigners
of different nationalities. Apart from questions
touching the statut personnel [ questions of wills,
successions, heirship, and the like, which are regu-
lated by the laws of the country of the individual ],
they shall have cognizance of all questions touch-
ing real estate between all persons, even though
they belong to the same [ foreign ] nationality."

It is of good augury for the national progress that
the tribunals years ago won the eonfidence of both
natives and foreigners, and that the government
bows to their authority. Europe needed no better
proof of their efficacy than when Ismail and the
government itself were brought before the Court
