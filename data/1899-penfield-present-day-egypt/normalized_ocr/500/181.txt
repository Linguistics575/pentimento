Expansion by Irrigation

With these conflicting claims to reconcile, the
engineers were compelled to weigh the pros and
cons of their project in every aspect before again
testing public opinion. That they succeeded in
their task is shown by the general approval of
their modified scheme, by which the dam is to be
but two thirds as high as at first proposed. A head
of forty-six feet of water satisfies the engineers,
and does not alarm the archaeologists; for, although
submerging portions of the island, it leaves the
temple, pylons, and prized sculptures fairly above
water-level.

When the builders have finished their labors, vis-
itors to Upper Egypt can never realize the present
beauty of Philae. The Isis temple, the chapel of
Hathor, the Diocletian portal, one of the legendary
graves of Osiris, the well-preserved pavilion called
"Pharaoh's Bed/h-Aho designer of which was no

fame.

Confessedly Philie will be impaired artistically,
for it is safe to assume that the zealous engineers
understate the extent of the submergence. A

at close quarters ,--hom the island itself ,--says:
"The four great pylons will, of course, stand up
out of the new lake, but its waters will rise to their
