Present-Day Egypt

The khedive, khedival family, and palace expenses,
coming under the head of "civil list," call for
$ 1,159,000. In ordinary times the army and mili-
tary police cost $ 2,390,000, and civil and military
pensions $ 2,150,000 more.

Nearly half of the sum required to carry on the

per cent. on exports), tax on date-trees, tobacco tax,
municipal octroi on food and merchandise, stamp
duties, receipts from railways, post-offices, tele-
graphs, lighthouses, and courts of justice. The
sale of salt and natron gives a yearly revenue of
nearly $ 8,000,000.

effective in the immediate future, is the adjustment
of inequalities in the land-tax. By the old scheme

usury any additional sum the rapacious collector
chose to demand. Not until Khedive Tewfik's
reign was a receipt of any kind given the peasant
to show that he had paid his taxes and that no
