crash, Ismail had sold his personal shares in the
canal to the British government for twenty million

field's shrewdness, for by prompt action he pre-
vented these shares from going to France. To-day
they are worth more than four times what was
paid for them, and secure to England the voting
control in canal affairs. The stipulation in the
concession that Egypt should receive fifteen per

maritime interests, and possessing not a share in
the enterprise, no pecuniary benefit can accrue to
the Egyptian people from the Suez Canal. And,
further, it can be conjectured that, had Ismail not
burdened his subjects with overwhelming indebt-
edness, thereby breeding discontent, there would
have been no European interference with Egyptian
finances, involving his dethronement; no Arabi
rebellion, and no British army of occupation.
