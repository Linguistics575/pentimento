Preface

the Egyptologist, antiquarian, nor historian: these
are favored already with a bibliography stra1ning
the shelves of every library. Aiming at being a dis-
cursive budget of information and comment ,--
social, political, economic, and administ1'ative ,---
the volume presents a series of faithful pictures
of the Egypt that is interesting to the winter
visitor, health-seeker, and general reader, desirous
of learning something, and not too much, of con-
temporary conditions in the oldest country in the
world. tt Present-Day Egypt "is written in no par-
tial or partizan spirit, and advances no theory of
the purpose of the Pyramids, nor attempts to ex-
plain the riddle of the Sphinx.
