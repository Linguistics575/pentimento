In Fascinating Cairo

he is not a perfect soldier; but Spartan virtues
must not be looked for from a nation of Helots.

General Lord Kitchener, sirdar of the Egyptian
army and governor-general of the Sudan, is yet
several years on the right side of fifty, is every inch
a soldier, and only a soldier, and has the prover-
bial dash and courage of the Irishman. He went
to Egypt resolved to win his spurs in a field where
.others had failed, and never for an instant allowed
his courage to falter or his energies to be diverted
to other channels. m has, indeed, added his name
to the list of great military leaders of the nineteenth
century.

The British army of occupation, which is inde-
pendent of the Egyptian army, is in Egypt on
financial terms liberal to the Egyptians, for the
khedival government pays only the difference be-
tween the cost of home and foreign service, being
less than half a million dollars yearly for the forty-
five hundred men composing this contingent. Usu-
ally about three thousand Britishers are kept in
Cairo; but, on occasions when there has been fric-
tion between the khedive and the British adminis-
trators, these have been countermarched so inge-
niously as to give the impression that ten times as
many redcoats were there. The English officers
lend much to a winter's gaiety. Courageous fellows,
trained to conquer, no season is complete that does
not add to their conquests those of the ball-room.
"Scarlet fever" is in the atmosphere of Cairo
breathed by the girl visitor, but is seldom serious
or lasting.
