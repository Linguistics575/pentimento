by many thousands of Mohammedans on their road
to Mecca, as well as by an immense number of
European and American travelers. m is now
located in a picturesque bungalow in the ancient
capital of the island, Kandy, in the interior, where
the temperature is more like that of his native
country than that of the coast. Arabi has ceased
to find his life in Ceylon either irksome or other-
wise unpleasant. His "visiting-book "is in its way
a notable curiosity, and he can now talk of the
events of 1882 without the smallest bitterness. m

and takes a deep interest in the political events of
the day, Sometimes his mind wanders back to

the freedom for which he fought. He is still in the
prime of life, for the rebel leader was only just

row of Tel-el-Kebir.

when hatching rebellion in Egypt, Arabi's reflec-
tions would be interesting, could we know them. N o
