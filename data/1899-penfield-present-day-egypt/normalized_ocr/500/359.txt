or four rainy days during a winter. At Mena
House and Helouan the rainfall is generally less
than in the capital, while at Luxor and Assuan a
shower is regarded by the natives as a wonder of
nature. Alexandria and other places on the Medi-
terranean do not share the general immunity of
the rest of the country from storms. Cairo's mean
temperature for November, December, J anuary,
and February is about 62° F., as compared with 63°
at Orotava, 61° at Madeira, and 49° at Nice and
Mentone. Egypt is the Winterland par excellence.

On the coldest days in Cairo the thermometer
never falls below 34°, and this degree of frigidity
occurs only at long intervals. Some Cairenes re-
call a slight snowfall a half-century ago, and a thin
film of ice on pools in the suburbs may be seen sev-
eral times in the average winter. This is caused
by the desert influence on the early morning air,
and is of short duration after sunrise. The cool
nights of winter give the air much of its stimulat-
ing property; and in summer, however hot the
days, the nights are nearly always made comfor-

The Egyptian year has but two seasons, summer
and winter. The period of warm weather lasts eight
or nine months, while winter is confined practically
to the months of December, J anuary, and Febru-
ary. It is only in J uly, August, and September that
the heat is intense; the rest of the year is climati-
cally agreeable. When the Nile is high, in the
autumn, there is at times sufficient humidity to
cause some discomfort, especially when the humid-
