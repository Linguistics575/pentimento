In Fascinating Cairo

This kiosk was a favorite plaything of Mehemet
Ali, and its walls have screened from the know-
ledge of the world many orgies of the Eastern sort,
in which fair women played important parts. A
special pastime of the great despot, affording him
the keenest enjoyment, was to collect together the
ladies of the harem, perhaps a hundred at once,
divide them into boating parties, and have them
paddled into the middle of the lakelet within the
kiosk. Then, at his signal, the eunuchs would
overturn the boats, precipitating the lovely freight,
screaming and scrambling, into the water, while
their lord and master was convulsed with delight
and laughter. It amused the Viceroy more than
any pas of his odalisks.

The name "Egyptian eigarette," applied to the
article established as an adjunct to fashionable and
club life, is, strictly speaking, a misnomer, for no
tobacco is grown in the country; in fact, culti-
vation of the plant has been since 1890 forbidden
by khedival decree. "Cigarettes made in Egypt"
would be the truthful description. Practically all
the tobacco comes from Turkey, where it is shipped
chiefly from Kavala, Latakia, and Yenidje. The
paper comes from Austria and Italy, and the major
part of the labor employed is Greek, except for
common cigarettes, which are made by native work-
men. The manufacture is very largely in the
hands of Greeks, and so deeply founded is the belief
that Europe and America will buy only Egyptian
cigarettes made by a Greek firm that several Cairo
manufactories are carried on under trade-names
