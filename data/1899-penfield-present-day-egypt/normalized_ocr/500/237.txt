Story of the Suez Canal

bound cargoes-sugar from Singapore and the
Dutch colonies, and tea from China, and India--
pass the canal each year; but these, in nearly every
instance, are borne in British bottoms.

Our military operations in the Philippines gave
an impulse to the canal receipts hitherto never en-
joyed from this source by the company, and the
United States government, in the closing months
of 1898 and the first half of 1899, paid more in
tolls for warships, transports, and men, going or
coming from Manila, than it had hitherto paid the
canal in twenty years. It is truly an ill wind
that brings nothing to the Suez company. Every
year or two its tribute upon commerce is substan-
tially augmented by the presence of armed strife
somewhere in Asia or Africa, in which Europe is
taking a hand. The years when Italy was hope-
lessly fighting the Abyssinians were among the
most remunerative in the eompany's history.

The economy in using the canal is in the saving
of time only. The present toll is $ 1.90 on vessel
tonnage, and $ 2 for every passenger, not counting
the ship's crew. The toll on tonnage is equivalent
to the cost of about three thousand miles of ocean
transportation, it is estimated. Since electric lights
for night steaming came into use, it requires from
seventeen to twenty hours to make the passage
of the canal. The cost for a large steamer, like
a liner of the P. & 0., the Orient or British India
companies, or a troop-ship filled with soldiers, is
not infrequently ten thousand dollars. I first made
the trip from Port Said to the Red Sea in the yacht
