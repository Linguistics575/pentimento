Present-Day Egypt

varies from five eighths of a mile to fourteen
miles. The name "Egypt" is of Greek origin.
According to Brugsch, it is corrupted from the
hieroglyphic Ba-ka-pta, that is, "House of the Wor-
ship of Ptah," the Creator of the world. The name
in vogue among the ancient Egyptians was Chemi,
meaning "Black Country," derived from the color
of the Nile mud. Among the Hebrews Egypt was
called Masar, the Mizraim of the Bible; and the
Arabs of to-day call it Masr, which name applies
especially to Cairo, the capital. The Turks call the
country Gript, which is evidently an abbreviation of
the Greek Aigyptos.

Ten or twelve years ago Egypt was insolvent.
To-day she is easy with prosperity. The position
of the fellaheen is constantly improving. The cor-
v√©e is abolished, and the people have no more
compulsory labor, except to keep the Nile within
bounds at high flood, for which they are paid.
Slavery is forbidden by khedival decree,1and-taxes
are gradually being reduced, and extortion and cor-
ruption seem to have been stamped out. Egypt
sells cereals enough to pay for the imported articles
necessary to maintain her simple standard of life.

The population of Egypt is a theme that has in-
terested more than one generation of observers and
writers. Under the Ptolemies we are asked to be-
lieve that the country hid 20,000,000 people; but
it is fairly authentic that Napoleon found only
2,500,000 when he went there in 1798. At that
time they had long been ground down into hopeless
degradation and poverty to pander to the luxury
