and vice of a few haughty masters. Oriental vo-
luptuousness had reigned in the palaces, while
beggary and wretchedness dwelt in the mud
hovels of the defrauded and degraded people.

In 1846, under Mehemet Ali, the population was
estimated at only 4,500,000. The census of 1882,
which was a most imperfect one, showed over
6,750,000; and that of 1897, to be considered as
fairly accurate, as it was made under British su-
pervision, indicated a total population between
Wady-Halfa and the Mediterranean of 9,750,000.
Of this total, 50.8 per cent. were males, and 49.2 per
cent. females. After deductions for women, chil-
dren under seven years, and desert Bedouins, it
was calculated that 12 per cent. of the males could
read and write, the remainder being entirely illiter-
ate. The native Egyptians numbered 9,008,000, to
which were to be added 40,000 originally from
other parts of the Ottoman empire, and 574,000
Bedouins. Of these last only 89,000 were really
nomads, the remainder being described as semi-
sedentary. Of foreign residents there were 112,500,
of whom the Greeks were the most numerous, with
38,000; then came the Italians, 24,500; British
(including 6500 Maltese and 5000 of the army of
occupation), 19,500; French (including 4000 Alge-
rians and Tunisians), 14,000; Austrians, 7000;
Russians, 1400; Germans, 1300; and the remainder
divided among ten different nationalities, the
United States being represented by less than 200
missionaries and naturalized citizens.
