Expansion by Irrigation

and the same hypothesis regarding agricultural
development in Dongola. and neighboring prov-
inces, by which they are to feed the entire country,
likewise gives over to sugar-growing the Nile val-
ley from Beni Suef to Assuan. Cane-culture has
been developed there with amazing rapidity. As
with cotton, Egyptian sugar is of superior quality.
It now brings nearly ten million dollars per year to
Egypt, and it may surprise American readers to be
told that the United States has for some time been
a liberal buyer of Nile-grown sugar.

At many points between Assiut and Assuan
important crushing-works have recently been
erected by native or foreign capital, supplied with
the most perfect machinery obtainable in Europe.
The peasant farmer in Upper Egypt has, by means
of enhanced irrigation, become a capitalist in a
small way through the sugar crop, and the cane
area will be doubled, if not trebled, in a very few
years, and statisticians must hereafter take the
Egyptian crop into account when dealing with the
world's production.

Thus, Lower Egypt is destined to be devoted to
cotton, Middle and Upper Egypt to sugar, while the
provinces south of the first cataract will produce
more than enough cereals to feed Egypt's popula-
tion. All this is feasible and quickly accomplished,
and no doubt has a place in England's elaborate
scheme for exploiting the valley of the Nile.
