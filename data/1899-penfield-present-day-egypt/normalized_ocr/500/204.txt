Present-Day Egypt

If the assistance of the women and children of his
family proves insufficient, the needed additional
labor may be secured at the rate of fifteen or eigh-
teen cents a day for each man. In the unlikely
event of having to sell his cotton at the same price
as the American, even then he could make a pvofit.
Bis prosperity is assured so long as the Southern
planter accepts the opinion that long-fiber cotton
can be grown only on the Nile, and that European
manufacturers will always be content to use the
American common staple.

Egyptian cotton has become a necessity, not only
in Europe but in the United States as well, and it
brings to Egypt, for staple and seed, nearly fifty-
five million dollars per year, which sum is sufficient
to pay the interest on her enormous foreign debt,
carry on the government, and, when there are no
military operations up the Nile, leave something in
the treasury. The United States is buying a hun-
dred thousand bales of Egyptian cotton annually,
and its consumption by New England spindles in-
creases by leaps and bounds.

In the provinces of Dongola and Berber huge
tracts are now open to the growing of breadstuffs;
and the Nile basin promises, as in the days of the
Pharaohs, to be in the near future one 0f.the gran-
aries of the world. This will permit Lower Egypt
to be devoted to cotton-culture, and the crop's area
may be made to include the Fayum, and extended
south of Cairo fifty miles or more.

It is a conservative estimate that by 1905 Egypt
will produce a million and a third bales of cotton;
