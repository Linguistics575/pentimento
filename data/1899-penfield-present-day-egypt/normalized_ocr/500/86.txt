Present-Day Egypt

ever the spirit moves them, although at fixed hours
all pray in unison, with heads invariably turned
toward the tt Kibla," the niche in the largest assem-
bly-1ooom, indicating the direction of Mecca.

A thousand or two youths actually live within
the walls of El-Azhar. They partake of their
simple meals when the spirit moves them. Their
food is exceedingly plain and inexpensive. A
bowl of lentil soup, a flat loaf or cake of bread,
and a handful of garlic or perhaps dates, are enough
to attract a group of school-fellows, over Which
they discuss affairs and joke as youths do elsewhere.
To needy students nine hundred loaves of bread
are distributed each day.

The great quadrangle presents a picture to be
rivaled nowhere in the world. Singly and in
groups, students sit on their skin rugs, earnestly
toiling over lessons. No matter how scorching the
sun's rays, if the impulse seizes them they stretch at
full length on the pavement, enveloped in their
long outer garments, and tranquilly sleep. Pupils
and professors step over and around them, always
respecting their slumber. Cats without number,
that seem to belong to the place, hobnob with the
boys upon terms of perfect harmony; but dogs,
being "unclean" by Koranie teaching, are never
permitted by the doorkeepers to enter the sacred
precinct. Sellers of bread and water pass freely
among the studying thousands, always careful not
to disturb sleepers, and here and there students
may be seen mending their garments, perhaps
washing and drying them in the sun.
