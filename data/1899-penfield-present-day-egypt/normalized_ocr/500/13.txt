STOOD once before a window in Venice

wherein an artisan was at work. Arranged
before him were smalts and innumerable bits of
glass of every hue, some brilliant, many dull, and
none suggestive of value or purpose. Apparently
following no definite design, the workman seemed
to draw mechanically upon the materials at his
command, choosing alike from the dull and bright
pieces, until it could be seen that the object on
which he had been employed, now completed, was a
mosaic of attractive pattern - not a masterpiece in
any sense, but perfect enough to find a purchaser
from among the group of onlookers.

In fashioning this mosaic volume of information
concerning the reawakened Nile country, I may
have drawn too generously upon the supply of
lusterless material, and dulled naturally brilliant
atoms by misp1aeing, them in the pattern. The
finished article, I am conscious, is far from a mas-
terpiece, and is journalistic rather than literary;
but it may still be attractive enough to satisfy the
inquiring reader interested to learn about the
atoms making up the Egypt of to-day.

"Present-Day Egypt" is prepared neither for
