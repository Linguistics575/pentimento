In Egypt for Health' s Sake

more interesting than a visit to an "ineubatory"
in any one of the native villages in the neighbor-
hood of the Pyramids. It will be found that the
incubatory is constructed of sun-dried bricks, and
so arranged internally that the eggs, placed in
mud-constructed ovens on trays cushioned with cut
straw, are constantly under the attendant's view.
No scientific apparatus is employed by this man,
not even a thermometer. He knows from expe-
rience and his own feeling how much heat is
needed, and he systematically turns the eggs sev-
eral times each day until they are developed into
peeping chicks. These hatching establishments
exist throughout Middle and Upper Egypt, and in
a season bring fully twenty million chickens into
the world, that grow up to be scrawny, un'attrac-
tive fowls. The industry is thousands of years old,
and seems conclusively to settle the question of a
chieken's maternity by allocating that parentage
to the hen laying the egg. The incubator is a
foster-mother only, and is responsible for stifling,
the "setting" instinct with Egyptian hens. The
keepers of the incubatories have a system of traffie
with peasant farmers by which eggs are purchased
outright, or six live chicks given in exchange for
a dozen fresh eggs.

V illa 1ife, with quietude and health-giving air, is
offered at 1hiiiiilir, six or eight miles to the east-
ward of Cairo. Uninteresting itself, the village is
surrounded by points of historical association in
sufficient number to keep the att ention of sojourn-
eis occupied for a few weeks at least.. The plain
