each of about 2700 square yards, and after ﬁltra-
tion it is received into two closed reservoirs.
The ﬁlters are 2 ft. 4 in. deep, and consist of
sand, different sizes of gravel and stones, which
come from the Red Hill at Abbassiyeh, before men-
tioned. The sand is pure white, from a pit be-
tween a pretty stratum of conglomerate travertine
and a lower layer of conglomerate pebble, and is
far removed from all danger arising from the
neighbourhood of old cemeteries. The place for
getting the sand had to be changed two years ago,
because the workmen discovered they were near
the dry osseous remains of an unknown medizeval
burying-place. The sand is all washed before
being used, and the superﬁcial layers of the beds
are removed every four days in the summer, and
every eight days in the winter, when the wate1 is
less thick. The deep layers of the beds are only
changed two or three times a year, which is pro-
bably not often enough. The beds and plant are
under the constant inspection of the Sanitary‘De-
partment, who have also made some interesting
analyses of the ﬁltered Nile water. Table IV.
shows the results of twenty-three analyses made
during twelve months, by Mr. F. E. Pollard, F.I.C.,
F.C.S., who has made a speciality of the subject.
The samples were taken in mid-stream, one yard
belowthe surface, and about one hundred yards north
of Kasr-el-‘Iil bridge, near the Company’s intake.
