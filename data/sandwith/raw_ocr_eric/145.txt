Luxor—Assouan. 1‘29

an amusement committee, if the visitors have re-
course to them.

Sight-sceing.——Close to the village of Luxor and
its hotels are the two Luxor Temples, and a
pleasant walk along the Avenue of Sphinxes takes
us to the well-known wonders of Karnak. On the
opposite side of the Nile are the Temples of Ra-
meses I. and 11., the Rameseum, the Colossi of the
Eighteenth Dynasty, the Temples of Rameses UL,
Thothmes III., beautifully preserved sculptures,
the Tombs of the Kings and other humbler folk, of
the Queens, and lastly of hundreds of early Chris-
tians. All these remains, and many more of
Thebes and its necropolis, contrive to make sunny
Luxor a very delightful and interesting winter
retreat.

A society, with its head-quarters in London, has
just been started for the preservation of ancient
monuments in Egypt. An estimate of the cost of
the most necessary work, such as clearing away
rubbish, strengthening pillars, draining off water,
etc., shows that £2055 is wanted for Luxor, £3140
for Karnak, and £3400 for Thebes, Esneh, and Edfu.
It is to be hoped that money will soon be forth-
coming to preserve all temples from the depreda-
tion of time, thieves, and tourists.
