Voyage up the Nile. 111

In [94mNovember[0m[94m,[0m[94m' [0mbetween Cairo and [94mAssiout [0mthe
deck temperature varies from 53Â° at 7 a.m. to 63Â°
at noon and to [94m580 [0mafter sunset, which is also the
mean of the month. The wind is north to [94mnortheast [0m; there is a little dew at night, and a warmer
coat is necessary on deck after sunset. The
saloon temperature of November varies from 55Â°
to 72Â°, with an average of [94m66Â°[0m.

In December, Patterson gives as the result of
two years[91m' [0mobservations ([91m1800-1-2[0m) [94ma [0mminimum on
deck of [91m47[0m[91m"[0m, [94ma [0mmaximum of 685Â°, and a mean of
57Â°. The range is greater, so that once [94mon
[0mDecember 29, the morning observation was 52Â°,
and at midday 72Â°. The saloon temperatures of
another observer give a minimum of 17Â°[91m; [0mmaximum,
[91m79Â°[0m; and mean, 63Â°; and his results of [94mninety-three
[0m[94mpsychrometrical [0mreadings give as average humidity
in 1888, in the dahabiyeh saloon, [91m50 [0mper [94mcent[0m,
with [94ma [0mrange from 43 to 78. The thermometer is
highest at 3 [91mp.111[0m[91m. [0mand lowest between midnight
and 7 [94mam[0m[94m. [0mThe air is driest in the afternoon,
and [91mdampest [0min the early morning. Dr. F. S.
Worthington has also given me some careful daily
readings for December, 1888, between Cairo and a
few miles to its south. The barometer average
(corrected for sea-level) was 3019; in the [91mdnhnbiyeh [0msaloon the average maximum temperature
