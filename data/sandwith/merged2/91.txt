Excursions from Cairo. 75

[94mAbu-el-Stroud [0mis another water named after an
Egyptian doctor of the [94mfifteenth [0mcentury. It is
without colour and odour, and keeps well in a hot
country. It is in great request among some
Europeans and natives for disorders of digestion,
and it has a distinct aperient effect. Its source
is said to be from the Mokattam hills, and it is
drunk at an establishment in Old Cairo, or bottled
there for home use. There is also a swimming
bath there of temperature 86Â° Fahr. No accurate
analysis has yet been made. Reaction neutral;
no gas; temperature, 86Â° Fahr. The principal
ingredients are sulphates of soda and magnesia,
and chlorides of sodium, magnesium, and calcium.
There are no nitrates or ammonia.

The Barrage should certainly be [91mvisited[0m, if it
is only to see how the pluck and skill of English
engineers have made it possible for some nine feet
of water to be held up at the times when every
drop of the Nile is wanted for land-irrigation.
It is a long ride, but a very pleasant trip by
steamer [94mor [0mby train, and the neighbourhood is very
pretty.

excursion is by steamer to and from Cairo; but
even then there is a two hours[91m' [0m[91mdonkey-ride [0mfrom
the landing-place to the Necropolis. If a steamer
cannot be obtained, it is quite possible to go [94mby
