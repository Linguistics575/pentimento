Cairo. 27

was [94m1118[0m[94m" [0mon July 13, while on the night of
January 20, the absolute minimum of [91m364[0m" was
recorded. In 1887, the highest maximum was
110Â° on June 9, and the lowest minimum
was 35"[94mY [0min January. Freezing-point seems
never to be reached in Cairo; but a shallow dish
of water placed in the wind on the ground in the
desert, may be found occasionally with a thin
coating of ice. I may say here, for the information of those who believe that Cairo is a furnace
in the summer, that the indoor temperature of
rooms on the north side of the house, kept properly shut during the hot hours, need never during
the year exceed 83Â° Fahr.; and, on the other
hand, that the same rooms, during the depths of
winter, if properly opened to receive the warm
outer air during the day, need never have [94ma [0mtemperature below 52Â° Fahr., without employing a
[94mfire[0m[94m, [0mBy living in sunny south rooms, or by employing [94martificial [0mheat, the invalid can be certain
all night in the winter of a temperature of [91mGW'
[0m[91mFalw.[0m, or more.

My observations, therefore, correspond with the
results obtained by the Rev[91m, [0mDr. Barnett in Cairo,
[94mwhich [0mI give in Table II. For nearly two years
he took observations six times daily, from 6 [94ma.m.
[0mto 9 p.m., to ascertain the indoor temperature of
an ordinary house[91m.
