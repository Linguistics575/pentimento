34 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

[91mvenienced [0mby not being able to pursue their ordinary outdoor life, and those whose work does not
permit of their resting feel fagged and tired before
the close of the day. The effect on natives would
seem to be something similar, the street-occupants
lying about in all positions on the paths, instead
of sitting and chattering as on other days. Fever
patients in bed do not seem to be conscious of the
change to khamseen weather. Bronchitic and
phthisical individuals are rather [94mbenefited [0mthan
otherwise by the dry, warm [94mair [0m; but it is doubtful
whether the air would not be too stimulating for
those with a tendency to [94mhaemoptysis[0m.

My only experience [94mon [0mthis point is derived from
one young Englishwoman, whose expectoration in
March became a little bloody. She liked the
khamseen days; but I thought it prudent to send
her to Ramleh, [91mehieily [0mbecause she had a very bad
family history of haemoptysis. A bad khamseen,
besides its effects on the human race, shrivels up
roses and other [94mflowers[0m, and will even warp and
crack unseasoned wood. It is [94mcurious [0mthat the
same southerly wind, so hot in March and April,
is occasionally in winter the coldest that blows,
the difference being that then the sun[91m's [0mrays
fall more obliquely on the desert, and the wind
is chilled by its passage over the mountains of
Abyssinia[91m.




[0mCairo. 35

After April the Cairo temperature is always
above 70Â° Fahr., and invalids are glad to hurry
away through the gates of Europe, which are no
longer closed against them. Rheumatism and lung
cases which are in need of [91m"[0msun-bathing[91m" [0mcan
and do stay till May and June, and the few
phthisical patients who have remained in Egypt
all the year round have not regretted it so far
as we know. It is only natural that Europeans
should wish to leave Egypt for their own homes
directly the heat becomes markedly felt; but every
spring we have the same experience of patients
writing back to us of the cheerlessness and cold
in some spot less favoured than sunny, rainless
[94mCairo[0m.

Has the climate of Cairo changed during recent
years or [94mnot [0m? Modern visitors are always told by
travellers of an earlier generation that the climate
has woefully depreciated, and has lost its charm of
dryness because of the improvements in irrigation,
and of the trees and gardens which have sprung
into being since 1850.

Let us examine the few broken records of the
climate that we possess and compare them with
Table I. But before we make this modern comparison, let us remember that we have no grounds
for supposing that during historic times has there
been any appreciable change in the rainfall, [94mthe

Cairo after the middle of the month, because the
summer is then rather suddenly at an end, and
winter clothing is issued to the troops. But the
proportion of heat to dampness is still great,
mosquitoes are rampant, and invalids are not
advised to arrive till the last days[91m, [0mof the month
at the very earliest. Quail are already in Upper
Egypt, and snipe, ducks, and geese are arriving.
Fresh dates are at their best, grapes, and [91meustardapples[0m. Bananas have begun, and continue all the
winter. Among [94mflowers [0mthere are dahlia, Zinnia,

[91mNovemben-A [0mbeautiful month for invalids to
arrive, and before the crush of pleasure-seekers,
so that good rooms can be easily secured. The
Nile inundation is still out between the town and
the Pyramids, and the sunsets are perhaps more
beautiful [94mthan [0m[94mat [0many other time of year. Weather
no longer too hot for outdoor exercise. Mosquitoes

night throughout the year, and [94mfir-skinned

the evenings require a [94mfire [0mindoors and an overcoat abroad. Lung invalids ought not to be out
after sunset. Temperature like the last week of
September in England. Quail return to Upper
Egypt from the Soudan. Roses bloom all the
year round in Cairo, but they are now at their

that, during a south wind, the shade temperature
at noon is about 80Â°; indoors it is [91m64[0m[91m"[0m; the barometer falls from 30 to [94m207[0m, and there are [91mIO[0m[91m"

Acacia trees in the boulevards shed their leaves

[94mApril-The [0mdays are warm like the hottest days
in an English summer, but are not felt so oppressive because of the dryness of the air. The houses
and habits of the country are also specially adapted
for the hot weather. Rooms are now occupied

wind, and on hot days it is wisest not to go out
immediately after luncheon. [91mEuropeap[0m[91m,[0m[91mhouses
