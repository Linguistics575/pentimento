There is, as might be expected, great improvement in the
cases of lung-disease which apparently begin as pleurisy,

Cairo. The cases which do not improve much are often
those who will not stay indoors after twilight, and expose
themselves to cold and damp during December and January.

I have seen considerable improvement in some cases of
laryngeal phthisis, but more in the general state than locally.
Most of the cases of advanced phthisis which have grown
worse in Egypt have been complicated with chronic diarrhoea.
There are several apparently healthy residents now in Cairo
