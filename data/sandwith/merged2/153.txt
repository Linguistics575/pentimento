RAMLEH.

Ramleh has a station of its own (Sidi Gabir)
upon the line from Cairo to Alexandria, but if
carriages are required to meet the traveller there
they must be previously ordered from Alexandria.
With the exception of [94ma [0mfew private carriages, life
at [94mRamleh [0mis carried on on donkey-back. During
the daytime trains run every hour or half-hour
from Alexandria to the seven stations, which are
only about [94mhalf [0m[94ma [0mmile apart. Each house stands
proudly in its own grounds, and varies in character
from [94ma [0mlimestone shanty to a pretentious [91mtwostoried [0m[94mchalet[0m. The prevailing wind blows refreshingly from the sea; there are miles of desert to
explore on the land side, pretty gardens to the
straggling houses, and, besides representatives of
Greece and many other nations, a colony of English [94mofficials [0mand merchants who are famous for
their hospitality and their lawn-tennis parties.
[91mRumleh [0mnow [94mhas [0m[94ma [0mscattered population of about
four thousand, but has only been inhabited for [94mthe
