130 Egypt as a [94mWinter [0mResort.

ASSOUAN.

There is no hotel as yet at the First Cataract,
but we ought soon to see one built, for winter
residents at Luxor would [94mfind [0mit an agreeable
change to go now and then to Assouan; and
Shellal, opposite the island of Philae, has been recommended as a perfect [94msanatorium [0mby Dr. Abbate
Pasha.

Assouan is 133 miles higher up the river than
[94mLuxor-that [0mis, 583 miles south of Cairo. The
temple of [91mEsueh [0mis only 35 miles from Luxor, and
Edfu temple is half-way to Assouan; then, 26 miles
further on, we come to the sights of Silsileh, and
then the temple of Kom Ombo, a few miles north
of Assouan.

[94mAssouan [0mhas a varied native population of about
9000, and is well guarded by forts, and by 2000
Egyptian troops under English [91moffieers[0m.

Visitors will be interested in the granite quarries,
rocks of schist, granite, and basalt, Sir F. Grenfell[91m's [0mtombs, Elephantine Island, the shooting of
the cataract, and the lovely temple on the Island
of [91mPhilm[0m.

[94mTemperature-No [0mregular meteorological records
have been taken at Assouan, but the Army Medical
Staff took a few notes during the Nile [94mexpedition
