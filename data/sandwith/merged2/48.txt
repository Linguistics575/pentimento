[0mThe khamseen wind is the only bad one in
Egypt. It is so called, not because it lasts for
[94mfifty [0mdays, but because it is liable to occur during
the [94mfifty [0mdays which follow Easter Monday, and
possibly has some connection with the equinoctial
gales elsewhere. It blows from the south or [91msouthsouth-east[0m, the more easterly variety being the
most disagreeable. It usually continues three days,
but may in rare cases last as many as seven days.

would seem to vary from four to twenty. We wake
