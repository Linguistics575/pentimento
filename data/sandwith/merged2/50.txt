34 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

[91mvenienced [0mby not being able to pursue their ordinary outdoor life, and those whose work does not
permit of their resting feel fagged and tired before
the close of the day. The effect on natives would
seem to be something similar, the street-occupants
lying about in all positions on the paths, instead
of sitting and chattering as on other days. Fever
patients in bed do not seem to be conscious of the
change to khamseen weather. Bronchitic and
phthisical individuals are rather [94mbenefited [0mthan
otherwise by the dry, warm [94mair [0m; but it is doubtful
whether the air would not be too stimulating for
those with a tendency to [94mhaemoptysis[0m.

My only experience [94mon [0mthis point is derived from
one young Englishwoman, whose expectoration in
March became a little bloody. She liked the
khamseen days; but I thought it prudent to send
her to Ramleh, [91mehieily [0mbecause she had a very bad
family history of haemoptysis. A bad khamseen,
besides its effects on the human race, shrivels up
roses and other [94mflowers[0m, and will even warp and
crack unseasoned wood. It is [94mcurious [0mthat the
same southerly wind, so hot in March and April,
is occasionally in winter the coldest that blows,
the difference being that then the sun[91m's [0mrays
fall more obliquely on the desert, and the wind
is chilled by its passage over the mountains of
Abyssinia[91m.
