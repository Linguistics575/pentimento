is said to be only one evidence on the monuments
of rain having been known in Lower Egypt, and
we see around us to-day the mud-brick tombs
covered with stucco, dating from the Third or Fourth
Dynasty ([91m3.0[0m. [91m3800[0m), when they were built without
any apparent fear of their dissolution.

[0mannual rainfall for [91m1835-39 [0m([91mDestrouches[0m) is said
to have averaged less than half an inch, and if so,
we now have almost three times more rain than
formerly.

The following table shows a comparison of
mean temperatures at Cairo, taken at intervals
during the last hundred and [94mtwenty-eight [0myears,
but not always at similar hours, which probably
accounts for the variation shown in column 4.
The net result shows no decided change in the
regularity of Cairo temperature[91m.
