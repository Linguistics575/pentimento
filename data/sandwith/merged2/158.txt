[91mOoma-ka-bebi[0m. Antiquarians may be interested,
too, in a [94mfortified [0mGreek church, to which the English
residents used to be escorted by a Janissary for
Protestant services so late as 1840, before the
English church was built. Fort Pharos, on the
site of one of the seven wonders of the world, and
other forts still show traces of their bombardment
in 1882. Visitors are taken to see the [91mKhedive's
[0myacht [94mMahroussa[0m, his palace at Ras-el-Teen, the
[94mview [0mfrom the lighthouse, and from the [91msignalstation [0mon Fort Napoleon, and to the drive and
gardens on the Mahmoudieh Canal, where an
Egyptian band plays twice a week. In Ramleh
itself there are the [94mâ€œ [0mspouting rocks,[91m" [0mwhere the [94msea
[0mrushes through some openings which have been
[94martificially [0menlarged, and near by are palm groves
and curious sand-heaps ([91m) [0mtumuli). In 1889, a
Roman tomb with coloured stucco interior was discovered, close to some catacombs on the sea-shore.
These tombs are of pagan [94mofficers[0m, probably from
Caesarâ€™s camp, which was standing twenty years
ago, and demolished to build a palace, now in
its turn abandoned. Here was Nicopolis, where
Augustus defeated Antony, and where Sir Ralph
Abercromby died while beating the French under
General Menou in 1801.
