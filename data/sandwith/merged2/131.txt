from the north twenty-two days, and from the
south [94mfive [0mdays, and was entered as light every
day excepting on nine occasions, when it was
strong breeze or moderate gale. No rain was
noted. During the [94mfirst [0mhalf of March, 1888, Dr.
Savill accompanied a Cookâ€™s steamer from Luxor
to Assouan and back again to Cairo by river, to
bring back the last of the visitors from Luxor.
The average maximum temperature under the
awnings was 84Â°, and the highest point 100Â° was
reached at Assouan. The average minimum was
[94m517[0m[94m"[0m, and the lowest recorded was [91m44[0m[91m"[0m, there being
four readings at night below 50Â°. The average
mean was [94m678Â°[0m. The temperature before and
after sunset showed a fall of 4Â° Fahr. The wind
was northerly and strong. There was no rain,
one day was cloudy, the others sunny, and the
humidity of the air very much less than in
February.

April is not a month which many people spend
on the river, on account of the increasing heat and
the liability to dust-storms.

Dr. Worthingtonâ€™s observations were made
during the former half of the month between
Minieh and Cairo, and during the latter half on
the same dahabiyeh at Cairo. The barometer
remained at [94m3015[0m; the saloon maximum temperature averaged [94m817Â°[0m, and the average [94mminimum
