could run a few steps, walk downstairs quickly and without
ungainly gait, and she had very little pain, and much less
cracking in the knee-joints. The improvement was [94mchiefly
[0mdue to sunshine and the dry [94mclimate[0m[94m, [0mand when the air of
Cairo became hot and dry in April she improved all the
more. The following August she could play golf in Scotland
for two hours at a time, and had had no return of stiffness
in the joints, though the previous summer she had been
unable to walk on the links even with the aid of a stick.

Egypt is worth a trial to [94msufferers [0mfrom rheumatoid arthritis.

I have seen great improvement and eventual cure in [94msome
[0msevere cases of G. rheumatism, the hot dry climate being
the only relieving agent. One patient arrived wholly unable
to walk, [94mwith [0mone lower extremity completely stiff, after
severe arthritis keeping him fourteen weeks in bed. In
two months and a half he could walk up and downstairs,
but could not yet kneel; later on he almost recovered in
England.

Gout, again, is an unknown disease among the people of
Egypt, and all chronic cases are liable to be improved [94mthem[0m,
and the chances of an acute attack are lessened.

Heart disease and kidney disease patients are often sent
to Egypt, the former, because it is a country where active
exercise is not required, and the individual can keep himself
warm without any trouble ; the latter, because the skin will
relieve the kidneys of much otherwise necessary work.

[94mAnemia[0m, [94mwith [0mthe train of symptoms with which all
doctors are so familiar in young girls, is the prominent
sign of a disorder which is [94mtolerably [0mcertain to improve
in Cairo. There is a healthy outdoor life, with plenty of
light and warmth, and a [94msufficiency [0mof daily interest. The
patient soon becomes able to eat and digest, and to take
preparations of iron which had hitherto seemed impossible.
This has been a result quickly arrived at in most cases[91m,
