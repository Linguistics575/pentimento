Suburbs of Cairo. 85

table-land of [94mHelouan [0mremarkable is that it is in
some places saturated with water like a sponge.
Water is found at a depth varying from ten inches
to ten feet, and, when coming out of the springs,
has a temperature of 77Â° or 85Â° Fahr., and the yield
from these springs is considerable. The water of
the sulphur springs is quite clear and colourless,
but, on being exposed for a short time to the air,
the surface becomes covered with a slight [94mfilm [0mof
sulphur and lime-salts. The water smells a little
of sulphuretted hydrogen, and is slightly saltish
without being unpleasant to drink. Up to the
present twelve springs have been discovered, and
may be divided into three [94mclasses-Sulphur[0m, Iron,
and Saline.

1. Two of the Sulphur springs supply the Baths
which are attached to the chief hotel, and a third
has been led into a fountain, [94mwhere [0mthe poor of
the neighbourhood come to drink gratis. Temperature, [94m80Â° [0m[94mFalun[0m; [94mspecific [0mgravity, 1'0025.
