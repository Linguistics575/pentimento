Greenwich, which is 87, or with [91m70'7[0m, which is the
record for Algiers in the year 1884.

But although Cairo is exceptionally dry, it has
its damp moods at times, and several times a year
for a few hours reaches saturation on the humidity
scale. During the khamseen wind the percentage
falls phenomenally [94mlow-to [0man absolute minimum
of [94m4 [0mon March 24, 1888, and once even to 3 per
cent. in April, 1887.

[94mEvaporation-The [0mquantity of water evaporated
has been measured since 1887, and is obtained by
means of [94ma [0mvessel containing water protected by
coarse wire-gauze, and placed in the shade, but so
that air can pass freely over it. The difference
between the level of the water at any two observations gives the depth of water [94mwhich [0mhas evaporated. The following are the numbers in inches
for 1888, which was an average dry year ;[94m-Janw[0m[94m.
