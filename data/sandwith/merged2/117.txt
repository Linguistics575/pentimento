Suburbs of Cairo. 101

temperature of all three resorts[94m, [0m[94mHelouan[0m, Pyramids,
and [91mMatariyeh[0m, may [91mhe [0mtaken as the same as that
given for Cairo, with the [94mdifference [0mof a little less
humidity in their favour. As in Cairo, there is a
great fall in temperature soon after the sun has
set, and invalids must either be indoors or provided
with wraps, but fortunately there is no danger of
malaria.

[91mSight-sccz'ug.~Ahout [0mforty years ago, when
Lepsius visited the Pyramids, and had his encampment partly washed away by a [94mfierce [0mrain-storm,
there were no less than [94msixty-five [0mPyramids on the
plateau of Ghizeh; but now there are only nine
recognized, and of these visitors pay homage to
the three largest. I have so often been summoned
to attend patients with weak hearts who have
suffered after rapidly ascending the Great Pyramid,
that [94mi [0mam constrained to warn all those who are
elderly and delicate from [94mattempting [0m[94mit[0m. The climb
is [94ma[0m[94m, [0m[94mdifficult [0mone of at least twenty or thirty minutes,
and the only satisfaction to be gained is [94ma [0m[94mbeautiful
[0m[94mView [0mfrom the summit. The staff on the top of
this Pyramid dates from the transit of Venus
expedition of 1874[91m,

[0mThere are always Bedouins who will be delighted
for a small sum to ascend one or both Pyramids
in an incredibly short time, and a patient of mine
with a weak heart was induced last winter [94mafter
