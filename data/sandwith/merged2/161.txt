APPENDIX.

IN the introductory chapter I have already mentioned in a
general way the diseases which are likely to be [94mbenefited [0mby
wintering in Egypt, and now I propose to consider the
question [94ma [0mlittle more in detail, referring only to the most
common diseases which I have met with amongst [91mhealthseekers [0min Cairo.

[94mJ'uh[0m[94m,[0m[94misii.-Commencing[0m[94m, [0mwith pulmonary consumption, it
may be stated that cases of acute tuberculosis or acute
phthisis are not sent to Egypt as a rule, because of their
rapid fatality and because the state of the patient is so serious
as to prevent the desirability of transport. The few patients
I have seen with [94mscrofulous [0mphthisis associated with caries of
vertebrae, psoas abscess, or [94mfistula [0min [91marm[0m, have generally done
very well in Cairo, but some of them have died within a
few months after leaving for Europe.

Perhaps I may be allowed here to quote the statistics of
the [94minfluence [0mof foreign climates in consumption published
by Dr. C. T. [94mWilliams [0m: 251 cases were [94msent [0mto various places
in the Riviera, south of Europe, north of Africa, and Atlantic islands. Twenty patients spent twenty-six winters
in Egypt, and furnished [91m"[0mby far the [94mfinest [0mland result‚Äù
of the experiment; 65 per cent. improved, 25 per cent.
remained stationary, and only 10 per cent. became worse.
It is [94ma [0mmatter for congratulation that the expense of the
trip to Cairo and the ascent of the Nile is now so much
reduced that the country is thrown open to large numbers
