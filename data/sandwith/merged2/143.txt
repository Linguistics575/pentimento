[0mmoisture only reached 60, while the minimum fell
to 21 per cent.

[91mRuin [0mis indeed rare at Luxor, for there was none
in November and December, 1881, and this is by
no means unusual. In January, 1882, there was
none; but in 1878 there was one shower, and
another in January 1888. In the month of
February, 1878, there was a shower, another in
[94m1882[0m, again in 1887, and three minutes[91m' [0mrain was
recorded by Dr. Boase in 1888.

In 1878, 1882, and 1888, no rain was noted in
March. There would thus seem to be only two or
three days in the year when rain falls at Luxor.
Thunder and lightning are rarer still.

The amount of cloud is very little in the year,
but the sky was noted as being completely overcast four times in January, once in February, and
three times in March.

The amount 0 ozone was estimated by noting
the depth of the staining produced in a piece of
paper prepared with iodide of potassium and
starch, after it had been exposed to the air in a
double metallic gauze cage. Dr. Maclean pointed
out that when the barometer stood high, and the
temperature not great, the largest amounts of ozone
were present, while little ozone was indicated with
a low barometer on a hot day.
