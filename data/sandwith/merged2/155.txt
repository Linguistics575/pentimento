A [91mJexandria-Ramlelt[0m. 139

Ramleh has been a wonderfully healthy spot;
but the day will come when the subsoil [94mwill [0mbe
saturated with all the water used for the gardens,
baths, and kitchens, and some scheme of drainage
will be necessary.

The water-supply is pumped straight from the
canal of the Alexandria Company, [94munfiltered[0m, to
a reservoir, and thence to Ramleh at the rate
of 12,000 cubic metres a day. For use in the
house, it is then [94mfiltered [0mthrough native porous
jars. The greater part of the water is of course
used for the private gardens, where, besides many
English [94mflowers [0mand fruits, one sees [91moleanders[0m,
[91mpoint-settias[0m, hibiscus, [94mbougainvillia[0m, begonia trees,
indiarubber trees towering almost as high as the
palms, and grapes, bananas, oranges, [94mfigs[0m, and
melons. The desert abounds in a great variety of
small [94mflowers[0m; and one of the features of this
neighbourhood is the ice-plant ([91mJIcscmbryanthemum
[0m[91mcristallinun0[0m. Altogether the botanist [94mWill [0m[94mfind
[0mmore than two hundred specimens of interest in
and near Ramleh, while the sea-coast is covered
with beautiful shells.

[94mAmusements.â€”The [0mEnglish residents boast of as
many as [94mfifteen [0mlawn-tennis courts, a book-club,
and even a race meeting during two days in June.
There are paper chases on ponies and donkeys, and
an occasional gymkhana, or [94mcricket-match[0m, [94mwhen
