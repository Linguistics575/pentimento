CHAPTER V.
[94mEXCURSIONS [0mFROM CAIRO.

I HAVE already said that the favourite ride or drive
is in the direction of [91mGhezireh[0m, where on Fridays
and Sundays there is always a crush of carriages;
but those who love peace will be happier on the
roads leading to the Pyramids, or Heliopolis, or
[91mShoohra[0m, all soft, good roads, well shaded by the
[91msycamoredig [0m[91m" [0mother trees.

[94mDesert.[0m[94m--[0m[94m-[0m[94m) [0mvisitors who can ride a great treat
is in store. The desert can be reached on all sides
most easily, and supplies a capital galloping
ground and invigorating air which seems to put
fresh life into both horse and rider. The popular
idea in England is that [94ma [0mdesert is always one
vast plain of dazzling sand without undulations
and without signs of life, and that at every step
the [94mluckless [0mtraveller must sink ankle-deep in
tiring sand. The reality is a series of hills and
valleys with innumerable changes of colour, and
of lights and shades, and a crisp, [94mfirm [0mground [94mupon
