Aboukir, where the lake is now being drained, and
there are forts connected by torpedoes with the
bay in which Nelson fought the Battle of the Nile,
and his opponent[91m's [0m[91m" [0mboy stood on the burning
deck, whence all but he had [94mfled[0m[94m.[0m[94m" [0mNear [94mAboukir
[0mare the remains of Canopus, with granite columns
lying about, and whence, in 1888, the statue of
[94mRameses [0mII. was transferred to the Boulak
Museum.

Table VII. has been compiled from statistics kindly
furnished me by M. A. [91mPirona[0m, of Alexandria, and
is based upon his meteorological observations of
the nineteen years, [91m1870-88[0m, for the Central Meteorological Institute of Vienna. His instruments
were made in Vienna, and [91m1veetif1ed [0mat the Royal
Observatory there. The readings of the barometer
are at [94mfreezing-point[0m, sixty-two feet above sea-level,
and were taken at 9 a.m., 3 [94mp.m.[0m, and 9 [91mp.111[0m. The
mean temperatures are based on records at [94m0 [0m[94mann.[0m,
[94mo [0mp.m., maxima and minima, and coincide with some
observations made in [94m1817-40[0m. It will be noticed
that the prevailing wind is always straight from
the Mediterranean. The number of rainy days in
March is 4'5; in the month of April, only [94m1'5 [0m; and
in May the average further falls to [91m0[0m[91m"[0m[91mi[0m.

These are the three months when [94mRamleh [0mis at
its best, and can be safely recommended to those
on their way from Cairo to Europe[91m.
