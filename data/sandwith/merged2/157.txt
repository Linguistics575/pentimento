[0mfrom Heliopolis did indeed mark the site of the
Temple where honours were paid to dead and
living [94mCaesars[0m, and where [94mto-day [0mthe British consul
has his modern house; but, as every one knows,
they were carried away to lose their hieroglyphics
in the ungenial climates of London and New York.
The very tomb of the great Alexander is lost to us,
and has almost inspired Dr. Schliemann to a
search-expedition for the mausoleum of the Ptolemies. Pompey[91m's [0mPillar, as it is erroneously called,
is only interesting to us because it is the sole relic
of the city where Antony wooed Cleopatra, and of
the time when Alexandria was the commercial
centre of the world, and Egypt was the principal
granary of [94mHome[0m.

There are now only about [94mfifteen [0mcisterns in the
town, though in [91m1800 [0mthere were ten times that
number to be seen. This is only an illustration of
the destruction which has visited the city under
Arab, Turkish, and Egyptian rulers. These cisterns
are large, built under the houses, arched, and
coated with plaster.

Next in interest are the Catacombs, [94mor [0mremains
of the ancient Necropolis, once upon a time surrounded by vineyards and gardens. They are cut
in the calcareous rock facing the sea, between
[94mGabarri [0mand [94mMes[0m, and an early Christian church,
best visited by boat, is hewn out of the rock [94mat
