Suburbs of Cairo. [94m91

[0mA druggist is provided by the Government, but
many European visitors prefer to be dependent
upon Cairo for their doctors and drugs.

There are two hotels, the larger of which is in
connection with the baths, and has forty-six bedrooms, some of which are very large, also a [91mlawntennis [0mcourt. There is easy telephone and telegraph communication with Cairo.

Furnished and unfurnished villas can be hired
near the Bath Establishment.

[94mCourse [0mof [94mbaths.[0m[94m--[0m[94m-[0m[94m) [0mwater for the baths has
a temperature of about 86Â° Fahr. upon coming out
of the spring, and this can be [91mariifieially [0mheated to
102Â°, or more, in pipes which prevent any evaporation of gas. But it is doubtful whether it is ever
necessary to take the bath above 100Â°, for hotter
baths are generally apt to exhaust the patient.
The baths are open from 6 [94mam[0m. to [94mS [0mp.111., and
may be taken as it suits the convenience of the
[94mpatient-say [0mone hour before meals, or three or
four hours after meals. There can be no object
in taking more than one bath in the day, though
robust men [94mwho [0mare in [94ma [0mhurry to get through their
course can easily stand an occasional second bath
in the twenty-four hours. The beginner should
not stay in the water longer than [94mfifteen [0mminutes,
but he may gradually increase this to thirty
minutes. If he is not under medical [94msupervision
