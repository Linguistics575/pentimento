A characteristic view of the town and the
Pyramids plateau can be obtained from the citadel,
especially at sunset, and leave should be sought
to visit the English military hospital there, which
is one of the [94mfinesse [0min the world. The Turkish
baths are not particularly clean 01' well cared for.

[91mJlosyter-There [0mare in Cairo some three

No visitor should miss seeing the Khedivial
Library, which contains an unrivalled collection
of Korans, Commentaries on the Koran, and
Traditions, many of [94mwhich [0mhave been taken for

Then, too, there is the Museum of Arab art, where
are lamps of brass and of glass, chandeliers,
tables, old mosque doors inlaid with ivory, and
many other beautiful treasures, snatched a few
years ago from the interior of uncared-for mosques.

because the old buildings are in good preservation,
and in their construction and [94mfittings [0mgive us [94mas
