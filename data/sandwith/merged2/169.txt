Appendix. 153

not very unlike that of England during a dry summer, I
see no reason [94mwhy [0mpatients [94mwith [0mliver disease should not be
sent there or up the Nile, though perhaps it would be unwise
to let them remain after February at Luxor. The ordinary
individual [94mwith [0mcirrhosis or other result of alcoholic tendency,
improves temporarily [94mwhile [0min Egypt, because he [94mfinds [0mit
easier to do [94mwithout [0mstimulants. The peaceful life [94mon [0ma
dahabiyeh with agreeable company is sometimes very useful
in such cases.

Lastly, that great and increasing multitude of interesting
patients[91m, [0mthe neurotic, men and women, are [94mwithout [0mexception so content in Egypt that they have but little time or
inclination to consider their complaints.

THE END.
