dren, one died shortly after marriage, and the
remaining seven are as yet childless.

It will be interesting to note what diseases
visitors to Egypt are likely to suffer from during
their stay.

First and most frequent comes [94mDiarrhea[0m, which
seems to be invariably produced by a chill, such
as cold after a sunny day, and possibly by neglecting to wear a [94mflannel [0mbelt round the waist by day
or night, which seems to be a good preventive.
The individual seems to be attacked, as he might
be in Europe, by a [94mâ€œ [0mcold in the head [94m"[0m[94m-is [0mprobably
fatigued by exertion at the time, and eats an
ordinary meal afterwards. In the early morning
he is awakened by mild diarrhoea, which continues
two or three days, and readily yields to rest, milk
diet, gentle aperients, and bismuth. [91mLoss [0mmild
cases occur in delicate women, which seem to be
due to congestion of the [91mintestineâ€”are [0massociated
with mild fever for three days, and are cured in
about a week. I have never been able to trace
any case to the drinking-water, and it occurs
among those who [94mfilter[0m, boil, and [94mfilter [0magain their
water. Some strong robust men laugh at [94mflannel
[0mbelts and never wear them, but to weaker vessels
they are a great comfort and useful preventive of
catarrh.

Dysentery I have only seen three times in [94msix
