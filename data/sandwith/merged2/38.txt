years the resident population has allowed its [94mfilth

it pleased till it joined the level of subsoil water,

any [94mbeneficial [0mproperties as a sponge. This cleansing process, which takes place in September and
October, has, of course, the disadvantageous effect
of altering the level, not only of the [94minfiltrated [0msoil
water, but of the contents of all the uncemented
cesspools of former and more insanitary days.

It must be borne in mind that the subsoil water
has a slope of its own equal to that of the Delta,
