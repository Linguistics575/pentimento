each of about 2700 square yards, and after [94mfiltration [0mit is received into two closed reservoirs.
The [94mfilters [0mare 2 ft. 4 in. deep, and consist of
sand, different sizes of gravel and stones, which
come from the Red Hill at [91mAbbassiyeh[0m, before mentioned. The sand is pure white, from a pit between a pretty stratum of conglomerate travertine
and a lower layer of conglomerate pebble, and is
far removed from all danger arising from the
neighbourhood of old cemeteries. The place for
getting the sand had to be changed two years ago,
because the workmen discovered they were near
the dry osseous remains of an unknown [91mmediieval
[0mburying-place. The sand is all washed before
being used, and the [94msuperficial [0mlayers of the beds
are removed every four days in the summer, and
every eight days in the winter, when the [94mwatel [0mis
less thick. The deep layers of the beds are only
changed two or three times a year, which is probably not often enough. The beds and plant are
under the constant inspection of the [94mSanitary[0m[94mâ€˜[0m[94mDepartment[0m, who have also made some interesting
analyses of the [94mfiltered [0mNile water. Table [94mw.
[0mshows the results of twenty-three analyses made
during twelve months, by Mr. F. E. Pollard, F.I.C.,
[91mF.G.S.[0m, who has made a speciality of the subject.
The samples were taken in mid-stream, one yard
