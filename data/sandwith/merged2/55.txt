Cairo. 39

Starlings arrive. Oranges and lemons again, as in
all the winter months. Balsam and heliotrope.
[91mJanuaryâ€”There [0mis often a cold [94msouth [0mwind from
the desert, and though the days are not really cold,
the evenings require a [94mfire [0mindoors and an overcoat abroad. Lung invalids ought not to be out
after sunset. Temperature like the last week of
September in England. Quail return to Upper
Egypt from the Soudan. Roses bloom all the
year round in Cairo, but they are now at their

September, chilly at the[91m' [0mbeginning of the month,
but warm and pleasant at the end, so that [94mfires

Oranges, lemons, and loquats. Violets, petunias,
phlox, bougainvillia, and roses.

welcomed as a pleasant change after the cold
weather, but soon becomes disagreeable. The [94mlast
