us to the well-known wonders of Karnak. On the

the Tombs of the Kings and other humbler folk, of
the Queens, and lastly of hundreds of early Christians. All these remains, and many more of
Thebes and its necropolis, contrive to make sunny
Luxor a very delightful and interesting winter
retreat.

A society, with its head-quarters in London, has
just been started for the preservation of ancient
monuments in Egypt. An estimate of the cost of
the most necessary work, such as clearing away
rubbish, strengthening pillars, draining off water,
etc., shows that Â£2055 is wanted for Luxor, Â£3140
for Karnak, and Â£3400 for Thebes, [91mEsneh[0m, and Edfu.
It is to be hoped that money will soon be forthcoming to preserve all temples from the depredation of time, thieves, and tourists.
