66 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

The resources of the Nile have not yet been
developed, and there is but little rowing, sailing,
[94mfishing[0m, or swimming.

[94mShooting.[0m[94m--[0m[94m-[0m[94m) [0m[94mvisitor [0mwho wants big game will
be disappointed in Egypt; but, on the other hand,
he can get plenty of quail, duck, and snipe. He
must bring an ordinary breech-loading gun with
him, but all cartridges must be bought in Cairo,
one maker having the exclusive monopoly. In
1889 an English visitor rode down and shot three
wolves ([94mCanis [0m[91mmrirgmus[0m) beyond the Pyramids,
but this is a unique experience. Ibex can be
shot in the mountains near Suez; gazelle are very
shy everywhere; [94mwild [0mpig can be got in the
Fayoum and at [91mBroullos[0m, and lynx near [91mTel-elKebir[0m; and in the desert there are jackal[91m,[0m[91mhyema[0m,
fox, bare, and the [94mlong-cared [0m[94mFennec [0mfox. From
October to March there is good snipe, duck, and
[94mgoose [0mshooting, and from February to May there
is an abundance of quail. In February, 1889,
two English visitors made a bag of forty duck and
four hundred snipe in [94mfive [0mdays at Kafr-el-Sheikh,
and this is only an instance of [94mwhat [0mmany others
have done. One hundred and twenty quail have
been shot by two guns on the road to the Pyramids
in March, between luncheon and dinner. [91mPigeonshooting [0min the villages can be obtained all the
year round, because pigeons are kept for the [94msake
