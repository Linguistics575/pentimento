108 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

English doctor, whose services are seldom [91mrequired[0m;
a huge [94mmedicine-chest[0m; a European [94mmanager[0m; and
[94ma [0mdragoman, who arranges the details of the sightseeing.

The whole trip from Cairo to Assouan and back
to Cairo in these steamers takes three weeks; or it
may be arranged that the traveller shall break his
journey for a long [94mor [0mshort time at Luxor [94mor'elsewhere[0m. For those who desire to visit all the
temples and to devote a longer time to their study,
a special steamer makes the trip in four weeks
instead of three, and is provided with perfect
accommodation for [91mtweniy-five [0mpassengers. The
length of the smallest of these steamers is 160 [91mft. [0m;
the breadth, 20 ft. ; the horse-power, [91m275[0m; and the
usual speed, eleven miles an hour.

But it has been found that there are many who
cannot afford the time [94mor [0mthe expense for the three
weeks[91m' [0mtrip, and therefore some cheap express
steamers have been constructed to ply twice a

can go from Cairo [94mto [0mthe First Cataract and back
in fourteen days for Â£25, including a stay of four
days at [91mLuxor[0m; [94m,4 [0mthey may go to Luxor and
back for Â£20 in eleven days, four of which can be
devoted to seeing Thebes and Karnak. These
cheaper steamers carry thirty [94mfirst-class [0mpassengers,
and are very useful for those invalids who wish [94mto
