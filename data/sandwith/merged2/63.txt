Cairo. 47

Dengue fever was present in 1880 and 1887, but
only from August to November: it is a painful
malady, without danger to life. Typhus and
relapsing fevers occur in the spring among overcrowded natives, but no case has been known
among Europeans. The plague left Egypt, we
hope for ever, in [91m1814[0m. [94mSmall-pox[0m, as in other
parts of the world, is liable to occur among
those [94minsufficiently [0mprotected by vaccination, but
I remember only one case of a visitor and one
of a resident. The deaths from [94msmall-pox [0min Cairo
for [91m1886-7-8[0m, have averaged forty. Measles occasionally occurs as an epidemic among the natives,
and causes many deaths ; but I know of no visitors
who have caught the disease, and only a dozen
residents. [91mRotheln [0mI have not yet heard of in
Egypt. Scarlatina is so rare that it is only heard
of at very rare intervals among the British troops.
Diphtheria is not uncommon among native children,
and every now and then attacks Europeans who
live in insanitary houses. Whooping-cough is
almost unknown, mumps very rare, and the ordinary [94minfluenza [0mcatarrh of England is uncommon.
Congestion of the liver is more likely to attack
alcoholic residents than visitors, and both classes
are liable to pleurisy or pneumonia, if they persist
in imprudent exposure at night. Phthisis does not
occur among white residents, though, on the [94mother
