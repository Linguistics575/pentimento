Cairo. 69

accurate a picture of early Christian worship as
can anywhere be found. Some of them still have
[94mconvents [0madjoining, and are surrounded by thick
walls like a fortress, telling tales of old persecution
about the days of the [94mfifth [0mcentury, when the Bible
was translated into the Coptic tongue.

Besides some of the usually visited churches in
old Cairo, a [91mCopt [0mshould be engaged to take the
visitor to the Church of the Virgin, near the
[91mMuuski[0m, where may be seen the original type of
the Coptic basilica, with a [91mbaldaorhino [0msupported by
four columns and semicircular stone seats arranged
round the apse, and indeed much else of interest.

The modern Coptic cathedral is only worth
[94mVisiting [0mto see the service, such as on Easter Eve
[94mor [0mEaster Day; but it must be remembered that
their festivals sometimes take place according to
[94mour [0mcalendar, and sometimes by the Old Style,
twelve days later.

A riding or driving excursion will of course be
made to the necropolis of [94mKnit [0mBey, and to the
[94mso-called [0mtombs of the [91mMemlooks[0m[91m,

[0mThe palaces of [91mShoobra[0m, [91mGhezirch[0m, and Ghizeh
are all worth visiting if a permit can be obtained,
because they [94mhave [0mlovely gardens, and remind one
of the former glories of late Khedives. It is to the
last of these three that the Boulak Museum is now
being transferred[91m.
