Cairo. 63

picturesque garden of twenty and a half acres by
the landscape gardener to whom Paris owes the
Bois de Boulogne. The gardens are [91mskilfully [0mlaid
out, and, being close to the hotels, are a useful
resort by day for those who cannot take active
exercise; but after sunset they are liable to be
damp, in consequence of the perpetual watering of
the ground and the presence of a small lake.
Grass grows with [91mdiffie11liy [0min Cairo, and the
Lippia [91mnoditlorro [0mis made to take its place. There
is a good restaurant, which is in great request
during the summer, when military bands play in
the gardens after dinner. There are very few
trees or shrubs with which we are familiar in
English gardens, but ivy may be seen with the
cactus clinging to stately palms. Australia has
furnished the she-oak and the [94mbeef-wood [0mtree;
there are sparmannia from the Cape of Good
Hope; and from South America, clumps of [94mCocos
[0mtrees, silk cotton trees, and [94mhabrothamnus[0m. Among
the most noticeable trees are the blue [94mflowering
[0mJacaranda mimosifolia, the Erythrina [91mcristogalli[0m,
and the pepper-tree from Brazil; the lovely [94morangered [0m[94mflowering[0m[94m, [0m[94mflamboyant [0m([91mPoieteiana [0m[91mveyia[0m) from
Madagascar, which is now planted in some of the
Cairo streets; the mossy-cupped oak from Constantinople; the Malabar nut, [91mfrangipanni[0m, red
