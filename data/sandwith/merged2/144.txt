[94m128 [0mEgypt as a Winter Resort.

3 in February, and only 2 in March. The [91mduststorms [0mare often troublesome, though not numerous.
A moderate breeze some four or [94mfive [0mtimes a month
carries with it a great quantity of dust, and this
becomes more frequent after February.

It should be hardly necessary to say that no
patients with advanced phthisis ought to be sent
to winter at [91mLuxor [0m; neither should any of those
who require to be surrounded [94mwith [0mall modern
luxuries and the treasures of culinary art. Patients
with weak hearts and enlarged congested livers
would be better in Cairo. Some few people who
cannot, or will not, ride the ass of the country,
have had themselves carried in litters to see the
sights of the neighbourhood.

[91mAmusements.- [0mUnlimited donkey-riding and
sketching are always to be had. The curio-lover
may collect many authentic and a few manufactured antiquities; the sportsman can get good
quail and duck-shooting [94mwith [0mthe help of a guide,
and he may, if he chooses, shoot birds for a collection, jackals, and [94moccasionally [0m[91mhyasnas[0m. There
is not much [94mfishing [0mor boating, but excellent bathing, though the swimmer must be warned that
the current is often [91mssvift-three [0mmiles an [94mhour-[0m[94m.
[0mand the banks are dangerously precipitate cliffs.

There are good postal and telegraph arrangements. There are enough local [94mofficials [0mto [94mprovide
