Messrs. Cook are always able to provide families

The voyage up the Nile was formerly reserved
for the richest English and Americans, but I have

pleasure. There are many who are not [94msufficiently
[0mgregarious to wish to make a pleasure-trip with a
number of strangers, and to see the sights at
a [94mfixed [0mtime and within a [94mfixed [0mperiod, and, moreover, have not to consider the economy of time or
money. To them the peaceful life of [94ma [0mdahabiyeh

poultry, and eggs. They will be dependent on
their cook for bread, and on various tins for butter,
jam, bacon, biscuits, etc. [94mThey [0m[94mhad [0mbetter provide
their own wine, curtains for [91mdmughty [0mwindows,
