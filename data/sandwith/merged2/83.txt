accounts of most of the sights may be found in
the guide-books. Besides the bazaars already
mentioned, where the products not only of Egypt,
but of Syria, Turkey, Persia, Tunis, and Asia

the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the old
parts of the town, which are completely Oriental
and highly picturesque, contain houses [94mwhich [0mhave
been built at all times during the last six hundred
years. Many streets still exist where beautiful
[91mmushribyeh [0mwindows are numerous, and where
minarets and mosques produce a [94mview [0mwhich is
not seen in any other city. [94mNo [0mgreater change
can be experienced in leaving these Coptic and
Arab quarters than to [94mfind [0mone[91m's [0mself in the
