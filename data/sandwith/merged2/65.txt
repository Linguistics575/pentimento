[94mWater-supply.[0m[94m--[0m[94m-[0m[94m) [0mEgyptian towns get their
drinking-water direct from the Nile, or indirectly
from the canals fed by the Nile. The Cairo Water
Company, which has a complete monopoly for
many years, has lately, under pressure from the
Sanitary Department, made some important improvements in the supply. The intake is [91mnow'
[0mfrom the Nile itself, but used to be from a canal,
which during the summer months was liable to
become [94mstagnant [0m; it has been proposed to remove
the intake some four miles higher up the river,
above all source of contamination. The water is
pumped to the [94mfilter-beds [0mat [91mAbbassiyeh[0m, whence,
after [94mfiltration[0m, it returns to the town for [94mconsumption [0m; all the European quarters are now supplied with [94mfiltered [0mwater, the daily average being
about 20,000 cubic metres. The velocity of the river
at high [94mfile [0mis about [94mfive [0mfeet a second, or nearly
three and [94ma [0mhalf miles an hour; but at low Nile,
the velocity is reduced to at least [94mone-fifth [0mof this.
The [94mfilter-beds [0mare on raised ground in the
desert, and consist, in the [94mfirst [0mplace, of two huge
tanks, into which the water is always [94mflowing[0m;
from these it is admitted into eight [94mfilter-beds[0m,
