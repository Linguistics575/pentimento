most common certified cause of death. Those
nnacquainted with the lowest class of Egyptians
can form no idea of the filth in which they volun-
tarily live, of the habits of the nursing mothers,
and of their indifference to medical aid until the
child is actually dead. The apathy of the people
on this subject is perhaps partly due to the extra-
ordinarily high birth-rate among the natives. The
average birth-rate in Cairo during the last six

vital statistics were--Dusseldorf, 30'1; Buenos
Ayres, 39'7; Chernnitz, 44'8: While the figures for
Egyptian towns were--Suez and Ismailia, 54'2;
Cairo, 554; Alexandria, 57'9; and Port Said,
73'7. It is melancholy to reflect that one-third
of the native children die before they have lived
twelve months, and more than one-half of them
die before they have reached the age of five years.
It is doubtful whether this extraordinary fecundity

Whose habits and larvs of divorce are, of course,

Cairo, I have known thirty--five English brides
(set. 20--35) who have been imported into Egypt; of
these twenty-seven have borne one or more chil-
