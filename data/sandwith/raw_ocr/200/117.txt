temperature of all three resorts, Helouan, Pyramids,
and Matariyeh, may he taken as the same as that

Sight-sccz'ug.~Ahout forty years ago, when
Lepsius visited the Pyramids, and had his encamp-

there were no less than sixty-five Pyramids on the
plateau of Ghizeh; but now there are only nine
recognized, mid of these visitors pay homage to
the three largest. I have so often been summoned
to attend patients with weak hearts who have
suffered after rapidly ascending the Great Pyramid,
that i am constrained to warn all those who are
elderly and delicate from attemptingit. The climb
is a dilllcult one of at least twenty or thirty minutes,
and the only satisfaction to be gained is ubeauiiful
view from the summit. The staff on the top of
this Pyramid dates from the transit of Venus

in an incredibly short time, and a patient of mine
with a weak heart was induced last winter after
