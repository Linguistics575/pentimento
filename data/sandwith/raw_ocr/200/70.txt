The water, before being drunk in Cairo, is
passed through large earthenware jars, which are
found in every house, and constitute an excellent

water is further poured into porous vessels, where
it is kept deliciously cool, and gains an agreeable
taste. Charcoal filters and boiling are not neces-
sary, but there is no difficulty about carrying this
out, if desired.
