practical good from this annual washing of the
subsoil which must not be overlooked. For many
years the resident population has allowed its ﬁlth
to percolate into the porous soil and drain away as
it pleased till it joined the level of subsoil water,
and it is easy to conceive that if this earth were
not periodically cleansed and oxygenated by the
Nile inﬁltration, it would have long ceased to have
any beneﬁcial properties as a sponge. This cleans-
ing process, which takes place in September and
October, has, of course, the disadvantageous effect
of altering the level, not only of the inﬁltrated soil
water, but of the contents of all the uncemented
cesspools of former and more insanitary days.

It must be borne in mind that the subsoil water
has a slope of its own equal to that of the Delta,
viz. 1 in 10,000, and, instead of remaining local, is
constantly ﬂowing northwards towards the sea.
This is easily proved by experiments in this Delta
or in India.
