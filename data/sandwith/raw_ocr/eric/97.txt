el-Fayonm, and fourteen miles from Beni-souef
station. Mr. Petrie has now opened this Pyramid
also, and has cleared its temple, which is half a
mile to the east. Fragments of this temple are
now in England, dating from Usertasen II. of the
Twelfth Dynasty. One of the most interesting
discoveries is that the town of the builders of this
Pyramid joins the temple on the north, and here
may be seen rows of houses for workmen and for
stores, and numerous ﬂint instruments lying
about. Many papyri and tools were found, and
pottery with Cypriote letters on it, thus proving
the early date of the Cypriote alphabet. There
is plenty of pottery of the Twelfth Dynasty lying
about; and to the west and south of the Pyramid
is a cemetery which was originally used by the
Twelfth Dynasty, and later used again from the
Twenty-ﬁrst to the Twenty-sixth. Near the temple
are Coptic graves of the fourth century of the
Christian era.

13. Medineh Grob (Le. raven) is at the south
end of the Illahun dyke, which originally dated
from the Twelfth Dynasty, but has since shifted
its position. Here there is a town of the Nineteenth
Dynasty, built over the ruins of a temple of
Thothmes TIL, and from here much Greek pottery
of the Mycena type, with Cypriots and Phcenician
letters on it, has been sent to the British Museum.
