most common certiﬁed cause of death. Those
nnacquainted with the lowest class of Egyptians
can form no idea of the ﬁlth in which they volun-
tarily live, of the habits of the nursing mothers,
and of their indifference to medical aid until the
child is actually dead. The apathy of the people
on this subject is perhaps partly due to the extra-
ordinarily high birth-rate among the natives. The
average birth-rate in Cairo during the last six
years is 51'8, and that of Alexandria is 485 per

vital statistics were—Dusseldorf, 30'1; Buenos

Egyptian towns were—Suez and Ismailia, 54'2;
Cairo, 554; Alexandria, 57'9; and Port Said,
73’7. It is melancholy to reﬂect that one-third
of the native children die before they have lived
twelve months, and more than one-half of them
die before they have reached the age of ﬁve years.
It is doubtful whether this extraordinary fecundity
extends itself to European residents in Egypt,
Whose habits and larvs of divorce are, of course,
entirely different. During my own residence in
Cairo, I have known thirty—ﬁve English brides

these twenty-seven have borne one or more chil-
