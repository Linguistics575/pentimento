blood-stained expectoration in the morninox In September,
1889, her doctor reported that her improvement continued,
both lungs were sound, and there had been no more hemor—
rhage.

There is, as might be expected, great improvement in the
cases of lung-disease which apparently begin as pleurisy,
pleuro-pnenmonia, or pneumonia, and anaemic, delicate~
looking people go home sunburnt, and able to walk, ride,
and play lawn-tennis, after two or three months’ stay in
Cairo. The cases which do not improve much are often
those who will not stay indoors after twilight, and expose
themselves to cold and damp during December and January.

I have seen considerable improvement in some cases of
laryngeal phthisis, but more in the general state than locally.
Most of the cases of advanced phthisis which have grown
worse in Egypt have been complicated with chronic diarrhoea.
There are several apparently healthy residents now in Cairo
who originally came there from Europe for their health,
some of them having had hzemoptysis and other lung
symptoms.

twenty years, comes every year to Cairo and the Nile because
she is quite well there. Her brother and other relations
suffer from asthma, and she herself can live happily in
London, but in no other part of England that she has yet
