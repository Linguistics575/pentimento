Cairo. 29

Greenwich, Which is 87, 01' with 70"7, which is the
record for Algiers in the year 1881.

But although Cairo is exceptionally dry, it has
its damp moods at times, and several times a year
for a few hours reaches saturation on the humidity
scale. During the khamseen wind the percentage
falls phenomenally lot-iso an absolute minimum
of 4 on March 21, 1888, and once even to 3 per
cent. in April, 1887.

Evaporation-The quantity of water evaporated
has been measured since 1887, and is obtained by
means of a, vessel containing water protected by
coarse wire-gauze, and placed in the shade, but so
that air can pass freely over it. The difference
between the level of the water at any two observa-
tions gives the depth of water Which has evapo-
rated. The following are the numbers in inches
for 1888, Which was an average dry year ;--Jan11-
ary, 2-8; February, 2N?; March, Tf); April, 7;
May, &1; June, 11; July, ICr5; August, liY3;
September, 9'5; October, 7 ; November, 5; De-
cember, 4u----toiral, 93'7 inches. For practical
irrigation the evaporation in the basins is reckoned
at 7 inches a month all through the year.

J?ainjhll.---Yisitors sometimes come to Cairo
believing that it never rains there, which is, how-
ever, almost true of Luxor. Table I. shows clearly
that showers of rain are liable to fall during eight
