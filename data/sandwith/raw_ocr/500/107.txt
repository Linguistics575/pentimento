Suburbs of Cairo. Ol

A druggist is provided by the Government, but
many European visitors prefer to be dependent

There are two hotels, the larger of Which is in
connection with the baths, and has forty-six bed-
rooms, some of Which are very large, also a lawn-
tennis court. There is easy telephone and tele-
graph communication with Cairo.

Furnished and unfurnished villas can be hired
near the Bath Establishment.

a temperature of about 86° Fahr. upon coming out
of the spring, and this can be a1stifieially heated to
102°, or more, in pipes Which prevent any evapora-
tion of gas. But it is doubtful whether it is ever
necessary to take the bath above 100°, for hotter
baths are generally apt to exhaust the patient.
The baths are open from 6 a.n1. to 8 pmr, and
may be taken as it suits the convenience of the
patient-say one hour before meals, or three or
four hours after meals. There can be no object
in taking more than one bath in the day, though
robust men who are in a, hurry to get through their
course can easily stand an occasional second bath
in the twenty-four hours. The beginner should

but he may gradually increase this to thirty
minutes. If he is not under medical supervision
