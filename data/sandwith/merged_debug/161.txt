APPENDIX.

IN the introductory chapter I have [93m̶a̶i̶r̶e̶a̶d̶y̶ [0m[94malready [0mmentioned in a
general way the diseases which are likely to be benefited by
wintering in Egypt, and now I propose to consider the
question a little more in detail, referring only to the most
common diseases which I have met with amongst [91mhealthseekers [0min Cairo.

[93m̶P̶l̶i̶i̶i̶-̶C̶o̶m̶m̶e̶n̶c̶i̶n̶g̶r̶ [0m[94mJ'uh[0m[94m,[0m[94misii.-Commencing[0m[94m, [0mwith pulmonary consumption, [93m̶i̶t[0m[93m̶;̶
[0m[94mit
[0mmay be stated that cases of acute tuberculosis or acute
phthisis are not [93m̶s̶e̶n̶t[0m[93m̶;̶ [0m[94msent [0mto Egypt as a rule, because of their
rapid fatality and because the state of the patient is so serious
as to prevent the desirability of transport. The few patients
I have seen with [93m̶s̶e̶r̶o̶f̶u̶l̶o̶u̶s̶ [0m[94mscrofulous [0mphthisis associated with caries of
vertebrae, [93m̶[[0m[93m̶1̶5̶0̶s̶t̶ [0m[94mpsoas [0mabscess, or fistula in [93m̶a̶m[0m[93m̶)[0m[94marm[0m, have generally done
very well in Cairo, but some of them have died within a
few months after leaving for Europe.

Perhaps I may be allowed here to quote the statistics of
the [93m̶i̶n̶i̶l̶u̶e̶n̶e̶e̶ [0m[94minfluence [0mof foreign climates in consumption published
by Dr. C. T. Williams [91m̶:̶ [0m[91m'[0m[91m, [0m251 cases were sent; to various places
in the Riviera, south of Europe, north of Africa, and Atlantic islands. Twenty patients spent twenty-six winters
in Egypt, and furnished "by far the [93m̶f̶i̶u̶e̶s̶s̶t̶ [0m[94mfinest [0mland result[91m̶"̶

remained stationary, and only 10 per cent. became worse.
It is [93m̶a̶.̶ [0m[94ma [0mmatter for congratulation that the expense of the
trip to Cairo and the [93m̶a̶s̶c̶e̶n̶t[0m[93m̶;̶ [0m[94mascent [0mof the Nile is now so much
reduced that the country is thrown open to large numbers
