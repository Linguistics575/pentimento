It is usually said that the [93mÌ¶mÌ¶uÌ¶mÌ¶mÌ¶iÌ¶oÌ¶dÌ¶ [0m[94mmummied [0mbulls from
the Apis Mausoleum are all lost, but the writer
accidentally found three of them in 1887 in the
Historical [91mSoeiety[0m's Museum in New York. They
were probably stolen and bought when the [93mÌ¶SÌ¶eÌ¶rÌ¶aÌ¶pÌ¶eÌ¶uÌ¶nÌ¶lÌ¶ [0m[94mSerapeum [0mwas discovered in 1861. The tomb of [93mÌ¶TÌ¶iÌ¶h[0m[94mTill[0m, of
the Fifth Dynasty, contains wall sculptures in such
excellent preservation that it should be visited by
all; and there is another tomb kept closed which
is by no means inferior. From these life-like
sculptures and others much has been learnt about
the manners and customs of those who lived more
than five thousand years ago.
