Cairo. 57

[91meorafide11tly [0m[91mhoped [0mthat money may at once be
found for carrying out these reforms.

Until then individuals must continue to protect
themselves by cutting off all communication with
the ground, and by carefully trapping and ventilating all pipes.

In the mean time, all [94mstreet-sewers [0mhave been
blocked and destroyed, because they are unnecessary for storm water, and because it was found
that house proprietors used them as overflows for
their cesspools, and thus vitiated the fresh air of
the streets. At the same time some [91mgnspipes[0m, [94mwhich
[0mwere too small, made of [94mzinc[0m, and allowed leakage
in the surrounding earth, and consequent odour,
have been removed, and replaced by [94msix-inch [0miron
pipes, which are a great improvement. All cesspools [94mare [0mnow prevented from draining into the
Nile [94mor [0mcanals, and are obliged to be emptied at
least every six months, those of the cemented type
of course requiring to be emptied much oftener.
The sewage is taken in patent shut carts to
[91mAbbassiyeh [0mdesert by night, at the rate of over 30,000
tons a year. There it is [94mdeodorized [0mand sifted, and
sold to the fellaheen as [94m" [0mpoudrette " [94mat [0mÂ£2 [94ma [0mton
for use on their lands. These changes, though not
nearly radical enough, have already contributed
greatly to the comfort and health of the European
inhabitants.
