Aboukir, where the lake is now being drained, and
there are forts connected by torpedoes with the
bay in which Nelson fought the Battle of the Nile,
and his [94mopponent[0m[94m's [0m[94m" [0mboy stood on the burning
deck, whence all but he had fled." Near Aboukir
are the remains of Canopus, with granite columns
lying about, and whence, in 1888, the statue of
[94mRameses [0mII. was transferred to the Boulak
Museum.

Table VII. has been compiled from statistics kindly
furnished me by [94mM. [0mA. [91mPirona[0m, of Alexandria, and
is based [94mupon [0mhis meteorological observations of
the nineteen years, [94m1870-88[0m, for the Central Meteorological Institute of Vienna. His instruments
were made in Vienna, and [91m1veetif1ed [0mat the Royal
Observatory there. The readings [94mof [0m[94mthe [0mbarometer
are at freezing-point, sixty-two feet above sea-level,
and were taken at 9 [94ma.m.[0m, 3 [94mpmr[0m, and [94m9 [0m[94mp.111[0m. The
mean temperatures are based on records at [94m0 [0m[94mann.[0m,
[94mo [0m[94mp.m.[0m, [94mmaxima [0mand minima, and coincide with some
observations made in [94m1817-40[0m. It will be noticed
that the prevailing wind is always straight from
the Mediterranean. The number of rainy days in
March is [91m4'5[0m; in the [91mmouth [0mof April, only [91mP5[0m; and
in May the average further falls to [94m0[0m[94m"[0m[94mi[0m.

These are the three months when [94mRamleh [0mis at
its best, [94mand [0m[94mcan [0mbe safely recommended to those
on their way from Cairo to Europe.
