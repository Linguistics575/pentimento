suspicion.

Advanced cases [94mof [0mphthisis will often be much happier
leading an indoor life in [94mtheir [0mown unsuitable climate than
an occasional outdoor life in [94ma [0mmore favourable [94mone[0m. This is
especially the case if the patient has very limited means.
He gains sunlight and [91msunhoat [0mduring the day, and runs [94ma
[0mchance of his disease being arrested; but against this he
must balance draughts and irksome travelling, a paucity of
fireplaces, food and habits to [94mwhich [0mhe is unsuited, and exile
from his home-comforts and best friends.

I have previously referred to the question as to whether it
is advisable or not to send cases of [94mhaemorrhagic [0mphthisis to
Cairo. I have not yet seen any ill result from doing so, and
though I do not wish here to quote medical cases, I will give
the results of the only two patients I have met, with alarming history of recent haemoptysis. The first case, a friend,
but not a patient of mine, aged 27, had copious [94mhaemoptysis[0m,
recurring several times, followed by cough, purulent sputa,
dyspnea, and loss of weight ([94m171[0m, lbs.). [91mBe [0m[91mWas [0msent to Pau,
Nice, Mont Dore, and eventually to Egypt. He was so
weak that he had to be carried ashore at Suez, and he could
not walk for more than ten minutes at a time. After six
weeks in Cairo, he [94mwent [0mto Luxor [94mfor [0mtwo months in [94mJanuary[0m,
1888. In March his cough and expectoration had quite
ceased, and he could be out shooting [94mfor [0mthree hours at a
time. He gained [94m191 [0mlbs. weight while in Egypt, and spent
the following winter at Cairo and Luxor, without [94mcough[0m[94m,
[0m[94mexpectoration[0m, [94mOT [0m[94mhaemoptysis[0m, but still with old physical
signs at the right apex.

The second case was that of a lady, aged 19, whose father,
brother, and sister, had [94mall [0mdied of rapid phthisis with
haemoptysis. She herself had had haemoptysis for a year,
with loss of flesh, night sweats, slight cough, and signs of
incipient disease u one apex. After fifteen weeks at Cairo,
she had gained [94m151135. [0mweight, and there was general improve
