Appendix. [91m153

[0mnot very unlike that of England during a dry summer, I
see no reason why patients with liver disease should not be
sent there or up the Nile, though perhaps it would be unwise
to let them remain after February at Luxor. The ordinary
individual with cirrhosis or other result of alcoholic tendency,
improves temporarily while in Egypt, because he finds it
easier to do without stimulants. The peaceful life on a
[94mdahabiyeh [0mwith agreeable company is sometimes very useful
in such cases.

Lastly, that great and increasing multitude of interesting
patients, the neurotic, men and women, are without [94mexception [0mso content in Egypt that they have but little time or
inclination to consider their complaints.

THE END[94m.
