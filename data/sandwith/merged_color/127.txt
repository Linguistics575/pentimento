In November,' between Cairo and Assiout the
deck temperature varies from [94m53Â° [0mat 7 [94ma.m. [0mto 63Â°
at noon and to [94m580 [0mafter sunset, [94mwhich [0mis also the
mean of the month. The wind is north to [94mnortheast [0m; there is [94ma [0mlittle dew at night, and a warmer
coat is necessary on deck after sunset. The
saloon temperature of November varies from 55Â°
to [94m72Â°[0m, [94mwith [0man average of [94mGf[0m.

In December, Patterson gives as the result of
two years' observations ([91m1800-1-2[0m) a, minimum on
deck of [91m47[0m[91m"[0m, a, maximum of [91m685Â°[0m, and a mean of
57Â°. The range is greater, so that once [94mon
[0mDecember 29, the morning observation was [94m52Â°[0m,
and at midday 72Â°. The saloon temperatures of
another observer give a minimum of [94m17Â°[0m; maximum,
[91m79Â°[0m; and mean, 63Â°; and his results of [91mni11ety-bl1ree

Worthington has also given me some careful daily
readings for December, 1888, between Cairo and [94ma
[0mfew miles to its south. The barometer average
(corrected for sea-level) was [94m3019[0m; in the [91mdnhnbiyeh [0msaloon the average maximum temperature
