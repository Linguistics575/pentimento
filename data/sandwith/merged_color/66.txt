each of about 2700 square yards, and after [94mfiltration [0mit is received into two closed reservoirs.
The filters are 2 ft. 4 in. deep, and consist of
sand, different sizes of gravel and stones, which
come from the Red Hill at [91mAbbassiyeh[0m, before mentioned. The sand is pure white, from [94ma [0mpit [94mbetween [0ma pretty stratum of conglomerate travertine
and [94ma [0mlower layer of conglomerate pebble, and is
far removed from all danger arising from the
neighbourhood of old cemeteries. The place for
getting the sand had to be changed two years ago,
because the workmen discovered they were near
the dry osseous remains of an unknown [91mmediieval
[0m[91mburying-place[0m. The sand is all washed before
being used, and the superficial layers of the beds
are removed every four days in the summer, and
every eight [94mdays [0min the winter, when the watel is
less thick. The deep layers of the beds are only
changed two [94mor [0mthree times a year, [94mwhich [0mis probably not often enough. The beds and plant are
under the constant inspection of the [91mSanitarypr
[0m[91mpartment[0m, who have also made some interesting
analyses of the [94mfiltered [0mNile water. Table [94mw.
[0mshows the results of twenty-three analyses made
during twelve months, by [91mMr. [0m[91mF. [0mE. Pollard, F.I.C.,
[91mF.G.S.[0m, who has made [94ma [0mspeciality of the subject.
The samples were taken in [94mmid-stream[0m, one yard
