Ramleh has been a wonderfully healthy spot;
but the day will come when the subsoil Will be
saturated with all the water used for the gardens,
baths, and kitchens, and some scheme of drainage

The water-supply is pumped straight from the
canal of the Alexandria Company, unfiltered, to
a reservoir, and thence to Ramleh at the rate
of 12,000 cubic metres a day. For use in the
house, it is then filtered through native porous
jars. The greater part of the water is of course
used for the private gardens, where, besides many
English flowers and fruits, one sees oleanders,
