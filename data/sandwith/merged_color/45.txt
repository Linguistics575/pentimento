But although Cairo is exceptionally dry, it has
its damp moods at times, and several times a year
for a few hours reaches saturation on the humidity
scale. During the khamseen wind the percentage
falls phenomenally [91mlow-to [0man absolute minimum
of 4 on March [91m24[0m, 1888, and once even to 3 per
cent. in April, 1887.

[94mEvaporation-The [0mquantity of water evaporated
has been measured since 1887, and is obtained by

that air can pass freely over it. The difference
