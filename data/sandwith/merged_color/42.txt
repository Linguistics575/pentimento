26 Egypt [94mas [0ma [94mWinter [0mResort.

Table I. is a resum√© [91msvhich [0mI have made from the
records of the five years [94m1884-88[0m, the monthly
bulletins being printed by the [94mKhedivial [0mObservatory in the [91mAbhassiyeh [0msuburb of Cairo.

The observations are taken throughout the day
and night-at 6 a.m., [94m9 [0m[94mam[0m, noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m.,
[91mo [0m[91m1[0m[91m)[0m[91m.m.[0m, and midnight. The barometer used is a
Fortin, verified and compared [94mat [0mMontsouris [94mObservatory [0min Paris. The readings are reduced to
freezing-point, and are taken [94mat [0ma level of [94m1082
[0mfeet above the sea. My table shows that the
variations are not very great, and its practical
value is very little, though, as it falls when the
wind changes to the south, and rises again when
the prevailing north wind blows, it is useful to
[91mcheek [0mthe probable duration of a khamseen. The
greatest variation during 1888 was [94m30'2 [0minches on
one day in March, and [91m2T4 [0min. once in February.
The temperatures are taken by a Centigrade thermometer, verified every year, and placed on a
balcony [94mthirty-two [0mfeet from the ground, facing
north, and sheltered from the sun. [94mThe [0mextremes
of temperature are read daily from self-registering
maximum and minimum instruments. The [94mminimum [0mresult is generally found about 6 [94mam[0m[94m. [0mor a
little earlier, and the daily maximum is invariably
about 2 [94m13.111. [0m[94mor [0m3 [91mp.m.
