14 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

during the winter season, crowded to overflowing
with hungry tourists. There are no places of
interest to visit, and little to do besides sea-bathing
in Lake Timsah, and donkey-riding along famous
broad roads lined with [94msweet-smelling [0mtrees.

A fresh-water canal runs from Cairo to supply
the waterworks, and the consequent mixture of
fresh and salt water since 1869 is thought by the
inhabitants to be responsible for the malarial fever
for [94mwhich [0mIsmailia has of late years become
unpleasantly noted in a country where malarial
diseases are very rare.

There is [94ma [0mFrench hospital beautifully situated
outside the town, and a French and [94ma [0mGreek
doctor. The monuments now in the square at
Ismailia, [94mout [0min Syene granite and diorite from
Assouan, were brought from the ruins of Pithom,
about twelve miles west of Ismailia. Pithom was
apparently one of the garrison towns built by the
Israelites for Rameses II. in the land of Goshen,
and near it they [91mencamped [0m[91mupoll [0mthe second night
of the Exodus, just as Lord Wolseley did in 1882
in the same district, now called [94mKassassin[0m. The
third night the fleeing Israelites halted close to
[94mIsmailia[0m, and on the [94mfifth [0mday of their flight they
are believed to have crossed the see about halfway between Ismailia and Suez.

Ismailia is one of the cleanest and dullest towns
