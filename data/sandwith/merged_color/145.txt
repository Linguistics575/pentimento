its hotels are the two Luxor Temples, and a
pleasant walk along the Avenue of Sphinxes takes
us to the well-known wonders of Karnak. [94mOn [0mthe

[94mThothmes [0mHL, beautifully preserved sculptures,
the Tombs of the Kings and other [94mhumbler [0mfolk, of
the Queens, and lastly of hundreds of early Christians. All these remains, and many more of
Thebes and its necropolis, contrive to make sunny
Luxor a [94mvery [0mdelightful and interesting winter
retreat.

A society, with its [94mhead-quarters [0min London, has
just been started for the preservation of ancient
monuments in Egypt. An estimate of the cost of
the most necessary work, such as [94mclearing [0maway
rubbish, strengthening pillars, [94mdraining [0moff water,
etc., shows that Â£2055 is wanted for Luxor, Â£3140
for Karnak, and Â£3400 for Thebes, [91mEsneh[0m, and Edfu.
It is to be hoped that money will soon be forthcoming to preserve all temples from the depredation of time, thieves, and tourists.
