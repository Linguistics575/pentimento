Sanitary Department, made some important [94mimprovements [0min the supply. The intake is [91mnow'

at high Nile is about five feet [94ma [0msecond, or nearly

The filter-beds are on raised ground in the
desert, and consist, in the first place, of two huge
tanks, into which the water is always [94mflowing[0m;
from these it is admitted into eight filter-beds,
