some places saturated with water like a sponge.
Water is found at a depth varying from ten inches
to ten feet, and, when coming out of the springs,
has [94ma [0mtemperature of 77Â° or 85Â° [94mFahr.[0m, and the yield
from these springs is considerable. The water of
the sulphur springs is quite clear and colourless,
but, on being exposed for a short time to the air,
the surface becomes covered with a slight film of
sulphur and lime-salts. The water smells a little
of sulphuretted hydrogen, and is slightly saltish
without being unpleasant to drink. Up to the
present twelve springs have been discovered, and
may be divided into three classes-Sulphur, Iron,
and Saline.
