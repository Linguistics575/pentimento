record for Algiers in the year 1884.

But although Cairo is exceptionally dry, it has
its damp moods at times, and several times a year

scale. During the khamseen wind the percentage
falls phenomenally low-to an absolute minimum

cent. in April, 1887.

Evaporation-The quantity of water evaporated
has been measured since 1887, and is obtained by
means of a. vessel containing water protected by
coarse wire-gauze, and placed in the shade, but so

between the level of the water at any two observations gives the depth of water Which has evaporated. The following are the numbers in inches

irrigation the evaporation in the basins is reckoned
