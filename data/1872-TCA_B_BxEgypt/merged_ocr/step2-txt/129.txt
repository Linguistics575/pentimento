object to be aimed at, we, therefore, on

Wednesday, the ELI-wew'ril 1) AY, leave Jerusalem for the
division of Samaria. At neon we lunch at BI-rrntzt, where
Jacob had his wonderful vision of the ladder reaehing te
heaven, as he rested his weary head en a pillow of stone.
We afterwards pass through n richly etlltiretetl region of
fig trees and elite trees; the menntain sides being terraeed

Meant Hhal and Meant t'lerisim. All are interested te
learn if there is water still in the ancient well, and if a
cord can he ehtained, a hnehet er jar can be let down to
try the test. We have seen a. cord nt' TH feet let down into
the well without any water being brought up, and we have
seen a jar brought up full of beautiful water than a depth
of tie feet, We halt for the night tit NeeLeee, the eiteiettt

The mountain renge of Carmel is full in view, and the ex.
