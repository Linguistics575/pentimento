object to be aimed at, we, therefore, on

Wednesday, the Emwex'm DAY, leave Jerusalem for the
division of Samaria. At neon we lunch at BJ-rrmzh, where
Jacob had his wonderful vision of the lathkT reaching to
heaven, tis he rested his weary head on a pillow of stone.
We afterwards pass through n richly eultivnted region of
fig trees and olive trees; the mountain sidcs being.r Ciwraced
and plunted, as they doubtless ware in the days'wheu the,
land yielded its ehnmhmee. We 11.195 through :1 deep
ravine, unpleasant" designated the, Jtvlsbcrs' Glen, and DUI?
1hagpmms fire their revolvers and guns ('rcnuenrly, either
to try the echoes, or to warn merauders oi' their approach.
The valley has "bad reputation, and we are glad to be able-
te get. through it end rest for the night at Sinjel, on "
high [ mirth commending fine views of Shiloh and the lim'-

the well without any weler being brought up, and we hare
seen tt jar brought up full of beautiful water from a depth
of 33 feet. We halt for the night at NarsLocs, the ancient
Sheehem, er, Syehar. Nahleua contains a large population,
and Dean Stanley says there is in it the oldest and the
