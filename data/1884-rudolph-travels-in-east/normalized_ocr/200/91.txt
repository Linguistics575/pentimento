THE RISE OF CAIRO. 43



and when, under Caliph Othmén, Arabians settled in the
valley of the Nile, Fostit became the centre of government.
A school of learning was already in existence there when
Caliph Mtm (1n (8rs-833), the son of Hariin al-Raschid,
visited Egypt. Fostit became still more prosperous under
the Governor Ahmed ibn Tultsn, who made himself Sultan
of Egypt, and his building-loving successors. Scarcely a

Djéhar, general of Sultan Muizz, who had become ruler of

Caliphshad done. Several ofthe Mameluke Sultans, notably
Kalaon, El-Aschref-Chaltl, Hassan, Barkiylr, Kait-Bey and
El-Ghihi, adorned the town with handsome buildings, while
the inhabitants, it is true, suffered from the unbridled

further growth of Cairo. After the battle of Heliopolis, he
took Cairo by storm. The last of the Mameluke Sultans,
Tiimsin-Bey, was hung at Btb-es-Zuwtle, April 15th, 1517,
