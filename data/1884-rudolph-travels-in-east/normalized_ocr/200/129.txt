JOURNEY TO AuusKAR--SPowr IN THE PROVINCE OF FAYUM-RETURN
TO ArsiAR--Jormsw TO SIUT.

EARLY on the morning of the 23rd February the whole
travelling party gathered in the station of that southern
line of railway which leads, not only to Siut, but also has a
branch into the province of Fayum. Besides ourselves, the
two brothers Saurma also put in an appearance.

Herr Zimmerman had again the goodness to conduct
our train, and to accompany us to the last station, Abuskar.
Prince Taxis had started the day before, with a dragoman,
for the lake of Birket-el-karun, to pitch our tents and
arrange the hunting days.
