<span>BEDOUINS IN THE DESERT. 95<br/>
<br/>
and also that, being in immediate contact with the desert,<br/>
and absolutely free and inaccessible, they are not always<br/>
quite pleasant to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
The hunting party now divided into two. Baron<br/>
Saurma, the Grand Duke, and I proposed to get into one of<br/>
the boats which was at hand, and to endeavour to approach<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span>pelicans, which were swimming about not far from<br/>
land, while the other gentlemen were to busy themselves<br/>
with the multitude of black coot which frequent the reeds<br/>
on the shore.<br/>
<br/>
All our endeavours after the crafty pelicans were fruitless, nor would the great silver herons standing on the<br/>
shore allow of our approach. The further we went the<br/>
broader and thicker were the reeds; they cover the water<br/>
to the distance of a hundred paces from the bank. The<br/>
beautiful white-eyed duck appeared to be migrating, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flocks </span>of this one description only rose from among the<br/>
rushes in front of our boat. The river, blue, silver, and<br/>
other kinds of herons also rose from the forest of reeds.<br/>
<br/>
We shot a considerable number of ducks as provision<br/>
for our larder. Our boatmen sat stripped in the boat, and<br/>
at each shot one jumped into the water to pick up the spoil.<br/>
We were swinging about a few yards from the shore, when<br/>
suddenly the reeds parted, and a big Bedouin of fine<br/>
martial air appeared, his long gun in hand. He came to<br/>
offer us for sale some birds, which he had shot in the<br/>
morning.<br/>
<br/>
He vanished as swiftly and as noiselessly as he had<br/>
come, content with a few pieces of silver. Midday drew<br/>
on, and we rowed back to our <span style="color: #0000FF;">rocky </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tape</span>. The sun <span style="color: #0000FF;">burnt<br/>
