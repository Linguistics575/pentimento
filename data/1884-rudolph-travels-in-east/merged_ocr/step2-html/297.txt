<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The deepest stillness prevailed in the monotonous<br/>
country round. The mountains rose in dim <span style="color: #0000FF;">-outline</span>, .and<br/>
the yellow desert seemed interminable. I heard the<br/>
stealthy prowl of the jackal several times, and saw shadows<br/>
Hit by, and once even distinguished the form of a wolf;<br/>
but the much-wished-for hyaena did not <span style="color: #0000FF;">come</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>The right hour for this timid beast is the first after<br/>
midnight; but on this occasion also sleep so overcame me<br/>
that by eleven o'clock I was unable longer to resist it. I<br/>
left the ambush.' The Arab let me go with a reproachful<br/>
look, and resolved to wait, armed with his gun, for the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaena</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A long but lovely ride lay before me. The moonlit<br/>
nights of Egypt belong to the most <span style="color: #ff0000;">bewitching.memories<br/>
</span>which I have brought with me from the glorious land of<br/>
the Pharaohs. The Colossi of Memnon stood <span style="color: #0000FF;">ghost-like<br/>
</span>and grand by night in the dark green of the landscape.<br/>
Near the Nile a wolf ran across a few steps in front of me;<br/>
unluckily my gun was not loaded. It was very late <span style="color: #0000FF;">when</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>I reached the steamer and my much-desired rest.<br/>
<br/>
Early on the 12th, we all rode the same way to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet-Habu</span>. Long rows of storks stood on the sandbanks and in the water-pools; and I shot snipe and sandpipers while mounted on my donkey.<br/>
<br/>
After an hour's ride we reached the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">MÃ©dinetHabu</span>, where the Arab hunter was already waiting to tell<br/>
us that he had happily missed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaena </span>about one <span style="color: #0000FF;">o'clock<br/>
</span>at night. I did not believe him, and resolved to look at<br/>
the spot myself, and also to bestow my attention on the<br/>
vultures, which, according to the report of the Arab, were<br/>
assembled there in numbers<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
