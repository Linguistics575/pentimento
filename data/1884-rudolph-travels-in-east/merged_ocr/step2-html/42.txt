<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Greek places of worship, arranged in the orthodox fashion,<br/>
only, strange to say, with bell towers of the type of St.<br/>
Mark's. Here, too, the priests were noticeable for the<br/>
poverty of their dress. The day was the festival of some<br/>
Greek saint, and in the great church the faithful were kissing<br/>
the coarsely plated reliquaries.<br/>
<br/>
A stroll through the town gave matter for interesting<br/>
reflection. One special fact noted was the striking resemblance of the interior of the towns in the three southern<br/>
kingdoms of Europe.<br/>
<br/>
In Zante you might easily have supposed yourself in<br/>
a decayed Italian or Spanish town. Life in all of them is<br/>
carried on in the street. In front of the numerous caf√©s<br/>
the men sit with broad-brimmed hats, a plaid thrown round<br/>
their shoulders, and shabby clothes, swinging lazily on old<br/>
three-legged straw chairs. The coffee-cup stands on another<br/>
chair before them, and in their hands is a cigarette. They<br/>
gossip, they laugh, they gesticulate. Here coffee, Turkish<br/>
cigarettes, Greek placards, priests with round high hats;<br/>
there chocolate, Havannah cigarettes, Place of the Constitution, Catholic clergy with <span style="color: #0000FF;">three-cornered </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hats-but<br/>
</span>in the life and habits of the people the greatest resemblance. Among the young women you meet charming<br/>
figures and faces, and among the old, dragons such as only<br/>
the South can show.<br/>
<br/>
We drove to the Castle Hill, through varied streets and<br/>
even poorer houses, in droskies which would have done<br/>
honour to a Residence town in Germany. The road winds<br/>
in zigzags up a steep slope. Right and left are hedges<br/>
of cactus, and fruit trees, with here and there a palm<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
