<br/>
I HAD now to quit Jerusalem. Taking a last look at the<br/>
grey walls of venerable Zion, I drove away with Count<br/>
Caboga by the excellent road to Bethlehem, passing close<br/>
under the wall of the western side of the city from the<br/>
Gate of Damascus, by which our camp lay.<br/>
<br/>
At the entrance to the Valley of Kedron the road winds<br/>
among stony flats with a few bushes and scanty grass,<br/>
alternating with broken-down garden walls, stunted olive<br/>
plantations, and ruinous houses. To the right lie the<br/>
barrack-like buildings of the German colony; to the left<br/>
all is desolate and barren. The finest view is that of the<br/>
high battlements, walls, and towers of the Holy City which<br/>
we are leaving behind.<br/>
<br/>
The road gradually ascends the opposite slope of the<br/>
valley. A bare hill hard by is shown as the place where<br/>
the house of Caiaphas stood. We also pass the spot where<br/>
the Philistines encamped when David slew them, and<br/>
further on the ruins of the house of the aged Simeon, and<br/>
the Well of the Magi, where the star in the East <span style="color: #0000FF;">again<br/>
