<span>PELICANS. 213<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The central part of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lake </span>is entirely filled with absolutely<br/>
flat islands, great and small, most of them set in a circlet<br/>
of sand-banks. On these are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rocks </span>of pelicans in incredible<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">numbers-great </span>red and white patches larger than the<br/>
islands themselves, and sparkling gloriously in the sunbeams; living islands visible for miles off: thus are the<br/>
great swarms of birds to be seen in Africa.<br/>
<br/>
Slowly and cautiously we approached one of these<br/>
many thousand-headed companies. We searched carefully<br/>
with the telescope; only pelicans, not a single flamingo was<br/>
to be seen, and these we had especially hoped to meet<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
When we were at a distance of at least five hundred<br/>
paces, the birds began to grow uneasy, to stretch their<br/>
long necks, and move their wings. At the word of command four rifles gave the astonished birds their morning<br/>
greeting.<br/>
<br/>
Much disquiet, lively flapping of wings, and a general<br/>
flutter up was the reply. The white island transformed<br/>
itself into a gigantic cloud which cast a perfect and<br/>
compact shadow on the water. Now began a smart single<br/>
fire, which, strange to say, took no effect. The distance<br/>
in this kind of shooting is always an enormous one, and<br/>
the mass of birds, which looks so close and serried, has<br/>
nevertheless <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>intervals and gaps in it in which balls<br/>
may easily go astray. One solitary pelican shot in the<br/>
first volley <span style="color: #0000FF;">floated </span>dead on the water; one of our sailors<br/>
waded across to fetch it.<br/>
<br/>
The further we got inside the islands the more lively<br/>
the scene became. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sea-mess </span>and sea-swallows, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
