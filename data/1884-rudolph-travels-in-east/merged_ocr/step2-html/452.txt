<br/>
moreover, a most handy fellow, a capital horseman, and<br/>
quick-witted and <span style="color: #0000FF;">admit </span>in dealing with the people of the<br/>
country. He accompanied us all through our journey in<br/>
Palestine, so that we learnt his value.<br/>
<br/>
The moment we entered the courtyard, splendid Arabian<br/>
dogs sprang out on all <span style="color: #0000FF;">sides-beautiful </span>creatures, not unlike<br/>
our<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Hungarian wolf-dogs. They greeted their master,<br/>
whimpering joyfully. Count Caboga is a lover of animals,<br/>
and tames the most diverse kinds. For a long time he<br/>
had a perfectly tame hyaena: now a beautiful Asiatic sheep<br/>
followed him up to his room, and a cockatoo, living wild<br/>
among the pigeons in the tower, flew lightly down and<br/>
settled on his shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
After I had looked all over the castle I accompanied<br/>
Ferdinand and my huntsman to the place where hyaenas<br/>
were to be looked for at night. For a short distance we<br/>
returned to the road by which we had come from Jerusalem. Some hundred paces below the convent of <span style="color: #ff0000;">MarEly√©s </span>there are old walls loosely built of large stones. In<br/>
one of these, close to the road, an invisible ambush had<br/>
been very cleverly made. An old donkey in a most<br/>
putrid condition, as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaena </span>likes it, had been laid in<br/>
front.<br/>
<br/>
There was, unfortunately, no moon at this time, and<br/>
I feared that any attempt to see wild beasts, and still more<br/>
to shoot them in the pitch darkness, would be quite vain.<br/>
I had therefore brought plenty of strychnine with me, in<br/>
order to obtain possession of a hyeena. We drew on big<br/>
leather gloves and <span style="color: #ff0000;">skilfully </span>prepared the leg of the jackass<br/>
with a fatal dose. According to hunters' use, some <span style="color: #0000FF;">small<br/>
