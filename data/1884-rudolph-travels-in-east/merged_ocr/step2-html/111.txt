<span>RECEPTION BY THE KHEDIVE. 55<br/>

as in the little garden. Some Christian mummies from the<br/>
early days of Christendom interested me very much, as,<br/>
until I saw them, I had no idea that mummies of this kind<br/>
existed. They recall, with their bright, richly decorated<br/>
apparel and black faces, Byzantine Madonnas. After a<br/>
lengthened visit we left the museum, and drove home.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>had barely time to get ourselves into our Court<br/>
dresses, when a Pasha who holds the office of Court<br/>
Marshal under the Khedive appeared, to escort us on our<br/>
ceremonial visit to his sovereign.<br/>
<br/>
We set forth in a great heavily gilt carriage, drawn by<br/>
six handsome English horses at a foot's pace, with outriders<br/>
and surrounded by cavalry, in a kind of procession on the<br/>
long journey to the Viceroy's Palace.<br/>
<br/>
The style in which the equipages were set up was<br/>
peculiar. One handsome European carriage had as a coat<br/>
of arms the crescent and star; the coachman and outriders<br/>
were in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Western </span>liveries, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>the fez, and the pro-.<br/>
cession was opened by a sais in full Eastern costume.<br/>
<br/>
Many people stood in the streets and stared at us<br/>
inquisitively. In the square in front of the palace, a<br/>
regiment of Foot Guards, in light blue uniform, presented<br/>
arms to the strains of the National Hymn, followed by an<br/>
Arab cheer, which one company after the other roared forth<br/>
as they presented arms. The Viceroy, in the full uniform<br/>
of a Turkish Pasha, awaited us, surrounded by his Court.<br/>
In the great hall every one took a seat, in a circle, on little<br/>
stools placed along the walls; hereupon appeared the<br/>
customary richly ornamented chibouks and the coffee.<br/>
This is not only a grateful, pleasant practice, but also <span style="color: #0000FF;">one<br/>
