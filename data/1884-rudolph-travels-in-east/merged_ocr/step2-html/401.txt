<span>FAREWELL <span style="color: #0000FF;">TO </span>EGYPT. 261<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
canal buildings, the ships' docks, building yards and workshops, the vessels, and especially the Indiamen, lend the<br/>
whole scene a purely <span style="color: #0000FF;">Western </span>aspect.<br/>
<br/>
Late in the day we gave a dinner on board the Miramar,<br/>
to which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abd-el-Kader </span>Pasha and the French gentlemen<br/>
were invited; when it grew dark our countrymen who<br/>
reside here improvised a beautiful illumination of the<br/>
harbour and a procession of boats. Several brightly<br/>
illuminated boats with bands of music flitted round our<br/>
vessel, and brilliant fireworks were let off on land.<br/>
<br/>
The hour of separation soon came. Our guests left<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar</span>, and Abd-el-Kader Pasha also. We had all<br/>
learnt to value and respect him. He had been a faithful<br/>
companion to us and a true friend.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>had passed glorious never-to-be-forgotten days in<br/>
Africa, and bore away with us impressions of ancient<br/>
grandeur from the Dark Continent and from radiant Egypt,<br/>
from the graves of thousands of years of an ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span>now vanished civilization<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
