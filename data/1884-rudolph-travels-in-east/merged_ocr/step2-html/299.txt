<span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">RAMESSEUM </span>AT THEBES. <span style="color: #0000FF;">181<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">esseum</span>, are instructive examples of the plan and decoration<br/>
of such <span style="color: #0000FF;">structures-structures </span>whose most glorious example<br/>
is shown in the already-described sepulchral temple of<br/>
Setis I. (the father of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>.) at Abydus.<br/>
<br/>
"The Ramesseum at Thebes served both as a memorial of victory, and for the perpetuation and transmission<br/>
of the heroic deeds which the king had performed in his<br/>
wars with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hothites</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The gigantic fragments of a red<br/>
granite statue of the king are strewed on the floor of the<br/>
old temple, by the southern wing of the Pylon.<br/>
<br/>
"Further south stand the solitary guardians of'the city<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dead-the </span>two famous Colossi of Memnon, soaring<br/>
into the blue ether of the Theban skies, silent witnesses of<br/>
long-past glorious days in the history of the Egyptians.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">They </span>once adorned the space in front of the great gate of<br/>
a sepulchral temple of King Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, which has<br/>
now disappeared, almost without leaving a trace, from the<br/>
face of the earth. They were the work of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">renowned<br/>
</span>officer of the royal household, Hi, the son of Hapu.<br/>
<br/>
"Still further south, the funeral temples of the Pharaohs,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Thotmes </span>III. and Ramses III., rise to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>considerable<br/>
height from amidst hill-like piles of rubbish. Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.<br/>
</span>is the rich King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rampsinitus </span>of Greek tradition; his temple<br/>
is noticeable for the numberless delineations and inscriptions<br/>
designed to celebrate the victorious campaigns of this king<br/>
against the Libyan-Ionic confederation. If we further mention the terrace and the rocky chapel of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thutmessides<br/>
</span>in the north-western corner of this great Theban necropolis,<br/>
we shall have exhausted the list of these funereal <span style="color: #ff0000;">temples<br/>
</span>of the kings, whose purpose it was to preserve in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
