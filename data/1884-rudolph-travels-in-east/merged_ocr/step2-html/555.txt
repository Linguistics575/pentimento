forgotten. The Arabs strove to beat the reeds in all<br/>
directions, but their efforts were vain. We heard the wild<br/>
boar breaking through the thicket, but not one left the protecting cover; only some purple herons floated languidly<br/>
over our heads. I <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to get out of this horrible<br/>
place as quickly as possible, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>felt that I had already<br/>
inhaled too much of the marsh miasma and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours </span>of<br/>
decaying matter. By evening I had to experience its further<br/>
ill consequences. The Grand Duke, too, soon came back<br/>
from the other side of the morass, driven away by the<br/>
foul air; so we mounted the horses which the excellent<br/>
Ferdinand had <span style="color: #0000FF;">brought </span>after us and rode homewards.<br/>

steppe, I wished to try how quickly a conflagration could<br/>
be started, and accordingly dropped some lighted matches<br/>
as I rode along. In a few seconds there was a great fire,<br/>
which spread so rapidly that we were obliged to gallop<br/>
from it as hard as possible. The next day we could see<br/>
from a distance that part of the steppe still wrapped in<br/>
clouds of smoke. We quickly got back to Baisan, whither<br/>
the other gentlemen had also returned with some game.<br/>
<br/>
After luncheon some Egyptian rope-dancers, who were<br/>
travelling that way, performed before us. Amongst many<br/>
other more or less unsuccessful conjuring tricks, we had the<br/>
bee-dance, so familiar to us in Egypt, executed by a woman<br/>
on a rope. In the afternoon we all again left the camp,<br/>
and dispersed among the high sword-grass by the village,<br/>
among which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">frankolin </span>had been making its voice<br/>
heard the whole day. This beautiful large bird is easy to<br/>
