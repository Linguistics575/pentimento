<br/>
the luxuriant garden lands towards Jericho. Near this<br/>
place a stream descends from the hills and crosses the<br/>
plain to the Jordan. Again we had steep clay banks, big<br/>
blocks of stone, plashing water, and an even thicker undergrowth than that by the brook we had visited before. The<br/>
Grand Duke remained on the left bank, while I climbed to<br/>
the right. The Bedouins pushed into the thicket, and a<br/>
merry chase began. In a few minutes we had shot several<br/>
birds, but we soon abandoned the smaller game, as the<br/>
Bedouins came upon numerous recent tracks of the wild<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">boat<br/>
<br/>
</span>Immediately the dogs challenged, and a huge boar<br/>
burst through the bushes, but was only visible for a<br/>
moment, and no shot could be fired. A second soon <span style="color: #0000FF;">followed</span>, bounding like a hare through the long grass before<br/>
the heaters. The Grand Duke brought it down with a<br/>
ball. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">middle-sized </span>two-year-old female was hauled out<br/>
of the brook, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched </span>on a donkey to the camp.<br/>
Several wild boar escaped us in the thick undergrowth,<br/>
either turning back between the drivers or pushing too far<br/>
ahead. The Grand Duke missed one in the middle of the<br/>
brook.<br/>
<br/>
The dogs soon gave cry again. With noisy tumbling<br/>
and scrambling a very fine boar, decked with long <span style="color: #0000FF;">dazzlingly </span>white tusks, climbed the slope between me and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">heaters</span>, and strove to escape to the steppe. A ball under<br/>
the shoulder-blade laid him low, and, highly delighted, I<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched </span>my splendid spoil to the camp. We now<br/>
turned our attention to the numerously represented smaller<br/>
birds. Red and rock partridges, purple and night herons<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
