</span>With melancholy songs and plashing oars we glided<br/>
over the blue lake. This interesting lake has cultivated<br/>
land on one side, but is surrounded by desert on all the<br/>
others. Along the shores there runs a now narrower,<br/>
now broader strip of thick low shrub, which gives the lake<br/>
a peculiar character. No human habitation is to be seen,<br/>
and it is a grand, but unquestionably depressing picture,<br/>
intensified, too, by the deep leaden blue of the salt water.<br/>
It appears singular to the traveller to find, so far from the<br/>
ocean (the reader will kindly refer to a map), an inland<br/>
sea, in whose waters real sea fish and animals abound.<br/>
<br/>
The whole desert is quite salt, and the lakes on its margin are so likewise. After about half an hour's rowing, we<br/>
saw some pelicans swimming about; we went in pursuit, but<br/>
could not overtake these birds, as they paddle at great speed.<br/>
We sent a few fruitless shots at them from our unsteady<br/>
boat. At last, after many attempts, the great fat creatures<br/>
rose, and took their heavy flight to seek tranquillity on <span style="color: #ff0000;">some'<br/>
</span>other part of the lake. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>saw, besides, only wild ducks,<br/>
divers, gulls, and an extraordinary number of river eagles.<br/>
<br/>
The evening drew on, the sun went down, disappearing<br/>
into the desert with the most glorious effects of light and<br/>
colour, and a grand stillness reigned over the vast landscape.<br/>
<br/>
We approached the island <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bezir√© </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Karim</span>, whose rocky<br/>
cone stood out picturesquely against the dark blue sky.<br/>
<br/>
We put in to the flat eastern shore of the island. Our<br/>
camp of tents stood about a hundred paces from the water's<br/>
side. Fires had been lighted, and the Arabs cowered<br/>
among the bushes on the strand. Prince Taxis greeted us<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>He had arrived early in the morning with the large caravan<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
