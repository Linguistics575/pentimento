<br/>
</span>one a Moor who had been stolen in his earliest youth in<br/>
Africa, and now wanders with a tribe of Asiatic Arabs;<br/>
the other a genuine Jordan Bedouin of almost European<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">complexion-in </span>order that they might keep our larder<br/>
supplied with partridges. Both wore the brown and<br/>
white striped burnous of thick camel hair which is usual<br/>
with the Asiatic tribes.<br/>
<br/>
My uncle and I went out in the evening with these<br/>
Bedouins to look out for jackals. We went past the<br/>
village, over hedges and walls, to a water tank. Unluckily<br/>
there was no moon, and nothing came in sight before<br/>
it was quite dark, though we heard jackals howl in the<br/>
distance. We stumbled back slowly by the same wretched<br/>
road to the camp. Outside Latrun several figures stood,<br/>
looking like ghosts in their long cloaks, and viewed us<br/>
attentively.<br/>
<br/>
This village is said to have got its name from the<br/>
Latin "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Zaire</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>and to have been the birthplace of the<br/>
penitent thief Dismas. Recollections attach to almost<br/>
every village here, some of them grand and beautiful,<br/>
and with evidence of truth, but many also to the last<br/>
degree incredible.<br/>
<br/>
On our return to the camp a complete dinner was<br/>
served in the large dining tent, and the beneficent<br/>
repose of well-earned sleep followed quickly on the Turkish<br/>
coffee.<br/>
<br/>
Next morning all was early astir. The tents were<br/>
struck and placed on the mules, and with the usual<br/>
tinkling of the collar bells, cries of the drivers, and<br/>
neighing of horses, the caravan got into motion. <span style="color: #ff0000;">At<br/>
