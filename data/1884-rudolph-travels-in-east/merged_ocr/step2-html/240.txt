<br/>
pursued our voyage towards Assuan. The beautiful<br/>
scenery kept us on deck. Low but well-shaped hills<br/>
approached close to the shore on either side, in many<br/>
places leaving little or no room for tillage. Here and<br/>
there luxuriant palm groves and thick underwood<br/>
rejoiced our eyes, and behind rose mountain masses<br/>
of rocks, heaps of stone, and stratification of the most<br/>
peculiar kind.<br/>
<br/>
The nearer you approach Assuan, the more the country<br/>
differs from the previous Nile landscape and the rarer<br/>
do towns and villages become. Some negro settlements<br/>
of a tribe that has pushed northward were observed.<br/>
Some miserable straw huts of tent-like construction stood<br/>
under lofty date and Dom Theban palms. The blacks<br/>
had settled themselves in the midst of plenty; it was a<br/>
picture of African life drawn from the interior as we<br/>
watched them through our telescopes, coal black and<br/>
going about in a state of complete nudity among the green<br/>
trees.<br/>
<br/>
It was towards eleven when the landscape assumed<br/>
a wilder character. The Nile in front of us appeared to<br/>
be hemmed in by mountain masses. Blocks of stone,<br/>
slabs of rock, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">davis </span>bordered the river, which<br/>
grew ever narrower. The mountains on the right<br/>
bank gave place to a lonely, desolate plain, scattered<br/>
over with blocks of stone, out of which here and there<br/>
jagged cones <span style="color: #ff0000;">projected</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>On the left bank a tolerably high<br/>
hill dips its foot in the waves of the Nile. Its summit is<br/>
crowned by an old building, doubtless of Moslem origin.<br/>
Soon palms appear, then green gardens, and from <span style="color: #0000FF;">their<br/>
