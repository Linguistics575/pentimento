<br/>
THE Egyptian coast presents to view <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat</span>, yellow dunes,<br/>
rising here and there into undulating sandhills.<br/>
<br/>
Some high minarets come first into <span style="color: #0000FF;">sight-then </span>the<br/>
<br/>
lighthouse and sundry windmills outside the town. Soon<br/>
after, the vice-regal palace of Mustapha Pasha, built in<br/>
fantastic Eastern style, rises as it were from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">waves.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>Now our arrival is really at hand. A boat skims across<br/>
the water towards our ship. The pilot's flag tells its<br/>
purpose. Orientals, not true Arabs, seafaring folk of mixed<br/>
races, such as only the East can show, row the boat with<br/>
vigorous strokes.<br/>
<br/>
Tawny fellows, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the garb of Asia Minor, with<br/>
turbans on their heads, shout and gesticulate as they approach. Among them sits a swarthy man in fine-spun<br/>
Oriental dress; a coloured scarf is twisted round his portly<br/>
person; a curly black beard makes a frame to his expressive<br/>
and fairly genuine Arab countenance. His yellow-brown<br/>
hands are adorned with silver rings.<br/>
<br/>
We slacken speed, and slowly and with dignity the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pilot<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
