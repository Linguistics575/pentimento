<span>372 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the flora is that of the Mediterranean coast. The far<br/>
more interesting Asiatic flora already lay behind us. The<br/>
ride to the summit of Mount Tabor in the afternoon and<br/>
after a long journey can afford little pleasure. Slipping<br/>
and stumbling, our weary horses at length reached the<br/>
outer boundary wall of the little convent. I could hardly<br/>
keep my eyes open from weariness, and was still suffering<br/>
severely from the effects of the fever. The Grand Duke<br/>
had sickened in the course of the long ride, and by night an<br/>
attack of fever, similar to that from which I had suffered<br/>
the day before, only in a severer form, set in with him.<br/>
<br/>
One tent had been sent on in front to Mount Tabor;<br/>
the rest of the caravan remained in Nazareth, as they<br/>
could not have got the greater part of the weary mules<br/>
up the mountain alive. We lay down in this tent to sleep<br/>
until we could get food. We had quitted the heavy<br/>
oppressive air of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jordan-the </span>atmoSphere of a region<br/>
lying below the level of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-for </span>brisk mountain air,<br/>
and a sensibly cool evening, with a sharp breeze, followed<br/>
the heat of the day.<br/>
<br/>
There is a splendid distant view from the top of Mount<br/>
Tabor. To the south-east the broad plain of the Jordan<br/>
extends, veiled in the vapours of the heated air, with border<br/>
mountains on either side, the western range grey-green,<br/>
with innumerable tops and cones, the eastern, lofty, bare<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">stern-the </span>home of the noble free Bedouin tribes. To<br/>
the north-east sparkles the mirror of the great Lake of<br/>
Gennesareth, framed in gentle hills. To the north are the<br/>
snow-clad tops of Lebanon and Hermon. Below us, at the<br/>
foot of Tabor, is a hilly country, traversed by valleys <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
