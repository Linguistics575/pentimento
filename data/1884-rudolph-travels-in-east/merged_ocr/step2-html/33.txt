which experience has since confirmed: green isles, washed<br/>
by the light blue waves, under a heaven of deepest blue,<br/>
and gilded by laughing <span style="color: #0000FF;">sunbeams</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The individual <span style="color: #0000FF;">details-the </span>trees, entwined with ivy,<br/>
stretching above the rocks, the flowering shrubs, the<br/>
rippling springs, all have (forgive me the profane comparison) something decorative which reminds one of a<br/>
magic <span style="color: #0000FF;">ballet-scene</span>. One almost expects to see a lightly<br/>
girt Diana, waving her golden lance, step from the thicket.<br/>
But, to return to reality, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar </span>ran in close to the<br/>
town, where we<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>were to stop for some hours, to coal.<br/>
Corfu, usually so tranquil, now had a warlike aspect. On<br/>
the island Vido, opposite to the town, a camp had been<br/>
pitched, and the little island swarmed with blue-clad<br/>
soldiers. Some parties were shooting at the targets.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Numerous </span>boats were taking soldiers to a steamer. As we<br/>
afterwards learnt, one of the battalions mobilized on the<br/>
island was that evening to go to Greece. The Hellenes<br/>
were dreaming a heroic dream, and the good <span style="color: #ff0000;">Corfiotes</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">not<br/>
</span>a little excited, thought that the days of Leonidas would<br/>
dawn once more.<br/>
<br/>
As we lay at anchor the doctor, representing the consul,<br/>
who was ill, appeared, and a valet de place whom I had<br/>
known <span style="color: #0000FF;">before-a </span>Iank little man of hideous appearance, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">luckless </span>descendant of the god-like Greek.<br/>
<br/>
The tidings that confluent <span style="color: #ff0000;">small-pox </span>prevailed in the<br/>
town was a blow to most of my companions, who had never<br/>
visited the island before. Landing was of course strictly<br/>
forbidden, and we spent the afternoon in an excursion in<br/>
the ship's launch. We passed near to the town. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">old<br/>
