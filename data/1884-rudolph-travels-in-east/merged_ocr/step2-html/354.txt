<span>224 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
we stopped several times, and made fruitless attempts in<br/>
different gardens and one sugar-cane field; but Diana was<br/>
not friendly to us this day, and we returned to Cairo with<br/>
empty bags.<br/>
<br/>
When we got home <span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>indulged in an extraordinarily<br/>
refreshing genuine Turkish bath, called Hammam. One<br/>
must have gone through this performance in the East<br/>
itself, where, with all its phases and manipulations, it<br/>
lasts an hour, to understand the passion of the Oriental for<br/>
his bath and all that belongs to it, and on which he will<br/>
spare no expense. The Eastern bath-servants, a special<br/>
class, are indispensable to its perfection, and the baths,<br/>
appointed as you find them in the houses of wealthy<br/>
Orientals, give a quite indescribable sense of enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">21st </span>of March we drove in the morning through<br/>
the old town up to the famous citadel. Several gates on<br/>
the steep hill-side had to be passed. The sentries on<br/>
guard received us with the gay strains of the Egyptian<br/>
General March.<br/>
<br/>
The citadel of El-Kala is a mass of buildings, strongly<br/>
fortified towards the town by the native rock. Since the<br/>
explosion of 1823, modern buildings, erected on the same<br/>
spot, have almost entirely supplanted the old fortress of<br/>
Saladin of the year 1166, which <span style="color: #ff0000;">was'built </span>out of ancient<br/>
Egyptian ruins. After passing through the first gate, Babel-Gedid, and the vestibule of the second, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Wustani</span>,<br/>
you catch sight of a second square surrounded by military<br/>
and government buildings, and the small palace of the<br/>
Viceroy.<br/>
