<br/>
The dance begins with circling, bending, and many not<br/>
ungraceful movements, but propriety forbids my describing<br/>
its further course. It is an orgy which, according to my<br/>
impression, has been handed down from times abounding in<br/>
degenerate and sickly forms of the imagination.<br/>
<br/>
After a short stay, we returned through the town to our<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>ship to seek our well-earned rest.<br/>
<br/>
The vessel got under way at daybreak, and in the early<br/>
forenoon we lay to beside the beautiful palm forest of the<br/>
unimportant clay-built village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Belianeh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>landed without delay, and, beset with gazers,<br/>
mounted our small badly equipped donkeys and rode<br/>
through the palm groves and gardens, past the village,<br/>
out into the plain.<br/>
<br/>
A tolerably broad margin of tilled land extends at this<br/>
place on both sides of the Nile. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>parallel to<br/>
the stream is closed, here as everywhere in Upper Egypt,<br/>
by the lofty chains of the two mountain ranges. The road<br/>
led among sugar-canes, bean and corn fields, copses of<br/>
small palms and sycamores, towards the Libyan mountains.<br/>
<br/>
On the green meadows there was much stir. The<br/>
industrious population were busy labouring, ploughing, or<br/>
tending large flocks. With every day of advance on a<br/>
Nile journey one notices that the skin of the people grows<br/>
darker and their dress more primitive.<br/>
<br/>
We saw for the first time the handsome bushy palm, a<br/>
tree belonging to the interior of Africa.<br/>
<br/>
At the sharply defined end of the tilled land and the<br/>
beginning of the desolate barren desert lies the dingy,<br/>
dirty village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabat-el-Madffme</span>, within a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm<br/>
