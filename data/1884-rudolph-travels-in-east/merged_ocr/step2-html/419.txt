<br/>
vegetation vanish more and more completely, and a dreary<br/>
stony desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">begins-the </span>accursed land. One cannot<br/>
divest one's self of this feeling. A peculiar, sad, but at<br/>
the same time majestic, character seems to belong to the<br/>
whole country, and strange and mystic emotions take<br/>
possession of each traveller.<br/>
<br/>
Pilgrims of all countries and ranks are seen on donkeys<br/>
or in <span style="color: #0000FF;">waggons</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>of them are men of ruined fortunes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Jews </span>too from the most distant parts of the world.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>had not yet reached the height when two Franciscans<br/>
came trotting towards us. The first, the custode of the<br/>
Terra Santa, a fat monk with a black beard, a big, powerful<br/>
man born in Tuscany, reminded me of those valiant heroes<br/>
of the faith who preceded the Crusaders in battle, bearing<br/>
the crucifix on high and inciting the knight to heroic<br/>
deeds; the second, a fellow-countryman, a Bohemian who<br/>
hardly knew how to repress his delight while he talked<br/>
with me, for the first time, perchance, for years, in his<br/>
mother tongue. Both monks greeted us most heartily<br/>
and fell into our procession. The Franciscans in the<br/>
Holy Land are literally the representatives of the Latin<br/>
Church. Brave combatants for their faith, they defend<br/>
in constant strife the privileges of the rite as against<br/>
other forms and creeds.<br/>
<br/>
We have climbed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hill-the </span>bare desolate plateau<br/>
of Jerusalem stretches before us, and in the distance rise<br/>
the blue-grey mountains of the Valley of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">jordan</span>.<br/>
Yellow grey is the pervading tone of the landscape,<br/>
barrenness its note. The first signs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jerusalem </span>were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">visible-the </span>great mass of the Russian church with <span style="color: #0000FF;">its<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
