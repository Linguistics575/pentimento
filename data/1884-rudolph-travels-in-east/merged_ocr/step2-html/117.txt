</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>The Arab origin of the town is shown with unmistakable distinctness, especially by the worship of a bird which<br/>
was dedicated to the sun, and to which a special sanctuary<br/>
was consecrated in the temple of the Light-god. This<br/>
wonderful bird was called Phoenix by the Greeks, and<br/>
the records of antiquity are full of its journeyings from<br/>
the Arabian incense-bearing lands to Heliopolis at the<br/>
completion of a great astronomical cycle.<br/>
<br/>
"The Egyptian monuments are familiar with this bird;<br/>
but their holy records strip him completely of the mysterious<br/>
character under which the Greek and Latin authors were<br/>
never weary of describing him. According to the declarations which the hieroglyphical inscriptions make about him,<br/>
the so-called Phoenix (in old Egyptian, Bemm) belonged<br/>
to a species of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'m</span>, remarkable for its shining plumage,<br/>
which glittered like gold. This bird was wont to migrate<br/>
to Egypt from the East at the time of the overflow of<br/>
the Nile. The lore of the old Egyptian priests placed <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>bird in relation not only to the sun, but also to that morning<br/>
star which daily heralds the sunrise. We may assume, without exposing ourselves to delusion, that the plantations<br/>
of incense-trees (of Arab origin), accredited by inscriptions,<br/>
convey a very definite reference to the burning of the<br/>
old Phoenix in the ashes of its incense-built nest. In the<br/>
Middle Ages the traces of the plantations of these aromatic<br/>
trees still existed.<br/>
<br/>
"Heliopolis, and the whole district of which this city<br/>
was the metropolis, counted as one of the most ancient and<br/>
most renowned places even in the days of Egyptian<br/>
antiquity. Together with Memphis and Thebes, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heliopolis<br/>
