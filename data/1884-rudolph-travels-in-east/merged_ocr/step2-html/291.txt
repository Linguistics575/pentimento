</span>their children (to the astonishment of their princes), whose<br/>
virtues are such that they have acted according to their<br/>
love to the whole world, and according to the wise thoughts<br/>
which dwelt within them.'<br/>

"And the majesty of this god said,<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Call </span>me the god<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">T </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hot</span>' (of understanding), and he was called. And the<br/>
majesty of this god said to Thot,'Behold! great is the<br/>
distance from heaven, where I have set up my throne, and<br/>
where I must dwell to dispense the light of the sun. Thou<br/>
glorious god, in the deep, and in the world of tombs,<br/>
where thou art scribe, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">punishest </span>those who dwell there,<br/>
and whose acts and deeds have been of sin, thereby that<br/>
thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">keepest </span>far from me those who followed <span style="color: #0000FF;">evil-which<br/>
</span>fills my heart with <span style="color: #0000FF;">shame-be </span>thou in my place, my<br/>
representative, or wherefore art thou called Thot<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>the<br/>
representative of the sun? I will bid thee send the<br/>
princes (in thy name)." This is the origin of Ibis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. the<br/>
messenger bird of Thot.'I will let thee stretch thine hand<br/>
to the face of the ancient gods, who are greater than <span style="color: #ff0000;">thou</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
</span>It will be well if thou stillest my thirst.' This is the origin<br/>
of the water-bird of Thot.' I will let thee embrace heaven<br/>
and earth with thy glory, as a beam of light;' hence the<br/>
name of the'enfolder' for the moon.' I will let thee drive<br/>
back all the barbarians;<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>hence the name of'the expeller,'<br/>
for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dog-headed </span>ape; and this the origin of his office as<br/>
leader of armies<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>Be thou, therefore, my representative<br/>
for all visible things that through thee may be manifested,<br/>
and all men shall praise thee as God.'<br/>

"If any one says this decree to himself, let him rub<br/>
himself first with oils and ointments, and let him <span style="color: #0000FF;">raise<br/>
