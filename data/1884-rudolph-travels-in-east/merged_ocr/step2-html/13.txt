<span>PREFACE.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LEGENDARY lore and the pious faith of men have<br/>
alike placed the cradle of humanity in the distant East.<br/>
The migrations of the great families of mankind have<br/>
all, as a matter of fact, had their origin in the East; and<br/>
the mightiest religions, similar at least in their being and<br/>
their birth, have all sprung from the land of the rising<br/>
sun, where the glory of nature <span style="color: #0000FF;">inches </span>to thought of the<br/>
supernatural.<br/>
<br/>
The earliest history of the human <span style="color: #0000FF;">race-the </span>ruins of<br/>
primaeval <span style="color: #0000FF;">culture-the </span>home-of philosophy, of fable, and<br/>
of myth--<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>our speech and of our <span style="color: #0000FF;">faith-all </span>meet us<br/>
<br/>
face to face in the resplendent sun-illumined East<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
