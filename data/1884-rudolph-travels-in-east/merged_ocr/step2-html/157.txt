fired along the whole line. The numerous companies of<br/>
pelicans, in particular, were greeted with a well-maintained<br/>
fire, but unfortunately the distances were too great. Only<br/>
two of those birds strayed to the lower heights, and were<br/>
shot by two of the gentlemen. The stars had already<br/>
vanished, a beautiful African sunrise followed the night,<br/>
and the heat of a cloudless day began to be felt. When we<br/>
left our places, the flight of birds was over. Every one<br/>
took up his spoil, and we returned to our improvised<br/>
landing-place by the rock. Thither the sportsmen all<br/>
gathered, and there were our boats and the Arabs and<br/>
Osman mounting guard.<br/>
<br/>
Two pelicans and various other fowl had fallen, besides<br/>
one poor carrion vulture, who had inquisitively crossed the<br/>
line of fire, and had to part with his life.<br/>

After a short rest we broke up again, to drive the<br/>

to north and south a thick undergrowth of tamarisk, reeds,'<br/>
and grass spreads along the bank<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In many parts this<br/>
narrow band of luxuriant vegetation, quite impenetrable<br/>
for man, is scarcely more than ten or twenty paces broad.<br/>
The great desert comes right up to this tangle of plants,<br/>
with its hills, vales, flat stretches, and gentle rises, in part<br/>
covered with the finest sand, and elsewhere with coarse<br/>
many-coloured stones.<br/>

Baron Saurma remained behind with the dachshunds<br/>
where the bushes began by the neck of land. The other<br/>
guns were, according to his plan, to be placed at' certain<br/>
distances from each other. I took the furthest post, at<br/>
a spot where the bushes left a narrow passage open, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
