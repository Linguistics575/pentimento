<br/>
</span>reflections, touched by the glowing sunbeams, dazzling<br/>
white, only broken here and there by orange rocks or by<br/>
black granite. Above, the eternal blue heavens, cloudless<br/>
and clear as crystal. We soon got back to Assuan.<br/>
<br/>
I shall once more do well to let Brugsch Pasha speak<br/>
in my stead about the island of Elephantine.<br/>
<br/>
"Elephantine, with its Nile gauge of Roman times and<br/>
its remains of buildings of the earlier periods of Egyptian<br/>
history, is now only visited by travellers because of its<br/>
picturesque position at the entrance of the gate of the<br/>
cataracts. Its former glory has <span style="color: #0000FF;">departed'since </span>the capital<br/>
of the Nubian country which once stood upon it, and the<br/>
temples and statues which belonged to it, have been swept<br/>
from the face of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
"At this spot there was, down to Roman times, astrong<br/>
garrison, which had the duty of protecting the country<br/>
against incursions from a southern direction. The old wall<br/>
on the road from Assuan to the island of Philae had <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>like purpose, that of a bulwark against predatory attacks<br/>
from the south. Its remains, half covered with sand, can<br/>
still be distinctly traced."<br/>
<br/>
As the sun went down, and the richest colouring flooded<br/>
the beautiful landscape, Hoyos and I once more left<br/>
the ship.<br/>
<br/>
A Nubian in his white robe, and with a long gun, and<br/>
known in Assuan as a sportsman, led us through the town<br/>
to the furthest houses. He advised us to pause there for<br/>
a few minutes<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>as the wild beasts seeking their prey visit the<br/>
outer parts of Assuan nightly at the beginning of twilight.<br/>
<br/>
Dogs barked, <span style="color: #ff0000;">children'cried</span>, a party of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ababdehs</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
