railway-station. The train soon steamed away from Siut<br/>
to the north, and sweet sleep quickly settled on the<br/>
travellers. When I woke, early on the morning of the<br/>
15th, the sun was shining into the carriages, and we were<br/>
already in the neglected little station of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrash√©n</span>. We<br/>
breakfasted in the dirty waiting-room, and then started on<br/>
the ride to Memphis. The road ran between marshy pools,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">well-kept </span>fields, and great palm-forests, to the little village<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mitrahenne</span>, which lies hidden in the plenteous verdure<br/>
of African vegetation.<br/>
<br/>
I will now let Brugsch take my place. "The tales and<br/>
traditions of the glory and the greatness of the old town<br/>
of Memphis, or, as it is called in Egyptian inscriptions,' <span style="color: #ff0000;">good </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">pasture</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span>have for ever passed away.<br/>
The temples and the houses of the old kings of Memphis<br/>
who had taken up their residence there have vanished from<br/>
the face of the earth, and not one single stone of the<br/>
ruins which remain awakes the recollection of the first<br/>
and earliest founders of the town. The space enclosed<br/>
by tumbling earth-walls, which extends by the palm-girt<br/>
village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mitrahenne </span>(old Minet-ra-hannu) to the north and<br/>
south, marks the centre of the vast abode of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memphites</span>,<br/>
the former site of the national sanctuary. Here stood the<br/>
temples of the god Ptah, the great artist and maker of all<br/>
created things. The sanctuary of this god, protected by<br/>
strongly fortified lines, which bore the name <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>white <span style="color: #0000FF;">wait'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or'white </span>fortress,' formed the citadel of the town, in which<br/>
the palladium of the empire was vigorously defended<br/>
against all external and internal foes, throughout the whole<br/>
period of Egyptian history<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
