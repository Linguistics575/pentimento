<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">So </span>TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a quick ambling trot, alternating with a gallop, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unwearied </span>donkey driver running after, we rode down the<br/>
length of the Muski and through the European quarter,<br/>
across the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Canal-el-Ismailiye</span>, to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Schubra </span>Avenue, and<br/>
back to the Palace Kasr-en-Nusha.<br/>
<br/>
After a short stay we drove to the Viceroy to pay our<br/>
first but not yet our <span style="color: #0000FF;">0172</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">th </span>visit. The palace in which<br/>
the Viceroy passes the working hours of the day lies on<br/>
the western side of the modern town, and is a large,<br/>
completely <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>building, wholly devoid of character<br/>
or style.<br/>
<br/>
The Viceroy received us in a most friendly <span style="color: #0000FF;">manner-according </span>to the Eastern custom, excellent coffee was<br/>
served in bewitching little Turkish cups, and chibouks were<br/>
smoked.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">The-visit </span>was soon over, and we took our further way<br/>
through the European, and then again through native Arab<br/>
quarters, to the Mosque Sultan Hassam, which stands near<br/>
the citadel. It is a large, ancient, but alas! very neglected<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">building-by </span>far the most beautiful mosque, and built in<br/>
the'purest Arab style, of all which I saw in Cairo. The<br/>
tomb of the Sultan, the bathing cisterns, the praying-places,<br/>
and the pillared halls are all, sad to say, gone to ruin.<br/>
On the flags the blood-stains from the days of the first<br/>
massacre of janissaries in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1351 </span>are still shown.<br/>
<br/>
We drove hence by the shortest way home, to take<br/>
a hasty breakfast and start once more, this time with four<br/>
horses and postilions, on an expedition to the Pyramids.<br/>
<br/>
The way led us once more through the whole European<br/>
town. The buildings, constructed like country houses <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
