</span>the mandrake in the pitchers shaken in and mixed with the<br/>
blood of men, and seven thousand pitchers of beer were<br/>
prepared from it.<br/>
<br/>
"And then came the king's majesty of Upper and<br/>
Lower Egypt, the Light-god Ra, in company of the other<br/>
divinities, to look at the beer. And behold the earth was<br/>
bright, and none of the men had been destroyed by the<br/>
goddess, who had gone up the stream at the appointed<br/>
time. And the majesty of the Light-god Ra said,' These<br/>
are the good. I will therefore be the protector of these<br/>
men.' And the majesty of the Light-god Ra said,'Bear<br/>
with the hand those pitchers to the place where the goddess<br/>
has made a massacre among the men.'<br/>
<br/>
"And the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower<br/>
Egypt, the Light-god Ra, gave light during a whole night,<br/>
to let those beer pitchers be poured out. And the fields<br/>
in all the four quarters of heaven were flooded with the<br/>
moisture, according to the will of the majesty of this<br/>
god<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A<br/>

</span>"And the goddess went out in the early morning.<br/>
And when she found the fields overflowed her countenance<br/>
was glad. She drank, and her <span style="color: #0000FF;">soul </span>rejoiced; but she did<br/>
not know that the drink was the blood of men.<br/>
<br/>
"And the majesty of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Light-god </span>Ra said to this<br/>
goddess,'Welcome thou Palm' (hence the origin of the<br/>
merry maidens in the Palm city, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. Marea at the lake<br/>
of the name near Alexandria).<br/>
<br/>
"And the majesty of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Light-god </span>Ra said to this<br/>
goddess,' There should be consecrated to her, at the new<br/>
year, pitchers to the number of the maidens' (who <span style="color: #0000FF;">had<br/>
