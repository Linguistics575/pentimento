<br/>
forsaken, and for a promised backsheesh the mixed multitude followed us. From afar we espied a not very large<br/>
field of sugar-cane, which was still standing though the<br/>
harvest had already begun. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>made for it with all speed,<br/>
stimulated by hope.<br/>
<br/>
Discussing the hunt we were about to begin. we marched<br/>
along the dyke of a broad but dry canal.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span>we had reached the spot, the guns were first<br/>
placed. The Grand Duke remained at the corner beside<br/>
the canal; Hoyos and I stood at the side where the field<br/>
came down to the foot of the canal dyke; the other<br/>
gentlemen surrounded all the sides of the cane plantation.<br/>
Unluckily, the guns were too few, and the spaces between<br/>
the individual sportsmen too considerable. Close to our<br/>
posts, buffaloes and camels were grazing, and unquestionably<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eusem√©lg </span>had not the look of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">wolf-hunt </span>according to<br/>
European ideas.<br/>
<br/>
The black drivers had hardly entered the canes, with<br/>
infernal yells, when my neighbour fired right into the field;<br/>
thereupon an enormous wolf leaped out between him and<br/>
me, and away with long springs over the canal. Though<br/>
the distance was a considerable one, I <span style="color: #0000FF;">ran </span>up on the dyke<br/>
and discharged my two barrels after the flying beast, whereupon it took its way crosswise through the fields with its<br/>
right hind quarter <span style="color: #ff0000;">wounded</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">heaters </span>soon appeared. Among the yellow cane<br/>
the brown fellaheen looked most extraordinary, and even<br/>
more so did the Moors, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom'there </span>were a considerable<br/>
number; each one came along gnawing the stalk of a<br/>
sugar-cane. We had the field beaten a second time<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
