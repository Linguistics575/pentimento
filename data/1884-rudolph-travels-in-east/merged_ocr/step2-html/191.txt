</span>wood. Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">dove-cotes </span>are the sole possession of the<br/>
poor inhabitants, and thousands of half-wild wood-pigeons<br/>
hover round in the vicinity of their dwellings.<br/>
<br/>
In Egypt, wherever the land rises above the level of<br/>
the Valley of the Nile, so that the waters of the stream<br/>
do not overflow it, there begins at once the full, complete<br/>
barrenness of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
This observation could be verified here at the last<br/>
houses of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arab√©t-el-Madffine</span>. From the richest green<br/>
of African verdure you step abruptly, without any transition, on to the dazzling white sand of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
The very interesting field of the ruins of Abydus,<br/>
whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-preserved </span>remains and walls rich in paintings<br/>
amaze and delight the traveller, lies among stones and<br/>
rubbish a few hundred yards from the village.<br/>
<br/>
With a touch, as it were, you find yourself in the<br/>
midst of a long bygone age, whose fairest memorials<br/>
have been preserved uninjured for us by the beautiful<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>sunny, and ever-dry climate of Upper Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
From the time of the sixth dynasty (about 3300<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0</span>) a spot close on the edge of the desert, whose<br/>
ancient name was Abidu, came to be regarded as the<br/>
consecrated burying-place of Osiris of Upper Egypt.<br/>
Hence the natural desire of the old Egyptians to find<br/>
on this spot, in the sand of the desert, their last abode.<br/>
Numerous chapels of private persons and magnificent<br/>
temples to individual kings of the country rose around on<br/>
the desert soil, and attracted visitors to pay pious honours<br/>
to the good Osiris, king of the dead, and to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">memory<br/>
</span>of the departed. The temples of King Seti I. (1360<br/>
