<span>THE RIDE <span style="color: #0000FF;">TO </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">BIRKET-ELKARUN</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'rp'<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>I fired at him instantly; the sound of his fall <span style="color: #0000FF;">forthwith<br/>
</span>gladdened my ears, and I hastened to the spot. His back<br/>
was broken, and he slid along, half sitting, half lying, and<br/>
showing his teeth. Some of the dogs, hearing the shot,<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>came up, and now began a battle for life or death, to which<br/>
I, at a favourable moment, put an end by a final shot.<br/>
<br/>
One wolf was the spoil of a whole hunt, which might<br/>
easily have been a brilliant one, for at least four wolves had<br/>
been fired at. We could not attempt a prolongation of our<br/>
sport, for the dogs came out one after another, dead beat,'<br/>
to the border of the field. The brave beasts had worked<br/>
famously in the scorching heat.<br/>
<br/>
We now all returned, more or less content, to our<br/>
horses. We discussed with wonder the wealth of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span>in wild beasts, and the comic effect of hunting<br/>
them, as we do <span style="color: #0000FF;">partridge</span>, in well-cultivated fields.<br/>
<br/>
The caravan was soon in motion again, and wound<br/>
along a bad and, in many places, marshy road, <span style="color: #0000FF;">between</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>fields of richest green. The sun did its best by us, and<br/>
burnt us up in true African fashion. The intense heat <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the atmosphere was shown by a Fata Morgana. Even a<br/>
Berber who <span style="color: #0000FF;">walled </span>beside my horse swore at the heat, and<br/>
perspired profusely. He was a singular creature. Negro<br/>
blood flowed in his veins, for his black face, covered with<br/>
scars, and his pointed, curly beard bespoke it; but his<br/>
finely formed features showed that Arab blood had also<br/>
had its part. I had allowed him to carry my gun, and,<br/>
grinning with delight and showing his white teeth, he<br/>
looked at the foreign weapon with the air of a connoisseur.<br/>
<br/>
We had a fine view in the distance from our road,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
