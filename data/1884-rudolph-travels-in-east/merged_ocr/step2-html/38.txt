disgust, that everything was in motion around me. Tables,<br/>
chairs, bed, everything was dancing. The ship rolled and<br/>
shook perceptibly and creaked <span style="color: #ff0000;">wofully </span>under the pressure of<br/>
the waves.<br/>
<br/>
Hastening on deck <span style="color: #ff0000;">-I </span>had a fine sight of the heavy<br/>
storm; the waves rose <span style="color: #ff0000;">mountaihs </span>high, broke over each<br/>
other and scattered in crystal foam. A storm at sea is<br/>
perhaps the grandest sight that nature affords, especially<br/>
when fine effects of light, shade, and cloud contribute their<br/>
share to the general impression. The heavens were on<br/>
this occasion covered with heavy clouds, and only here and<br/>
there a ray of sunlight broke through.<br/>
<br/>
We were off Cephalonia. The grand mountains of this<br/>
island overtopped the mist. In their centre was the <span style="color: #ff0000;">loftiest<br/>
</span>and most beautiful of them, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">snow-capped </span>Monte <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ero</span>,<br/>
the ancient Ainos. Stern and gloomy were the cliffs, grey<br/>
and unfriendly the shadows, and we feared that the<br/>
weather would grow still worse.<br/>
<br/>
Our brave ship fought her way but slowly against the<br/>
waves, and it was midday ere, passing along the west<br/>
side of the hilly, picturesque island of Zante, we reached its<br/>
southern point.<br/>
<br/>
The storm increased, and instead of getting more sea<br/>
room, we fell off from our course, and the captain resolved<br/>
to run into the sheltered canal of Zante. We came slowly<br/>
round the south point and turned into the channel which<br/>
lies between the island and the opposite mainland. As<br/>
soon as Zante sheltered us from the westerly gale, sea<br/>
and air grew still, and after her hard fight the <span style="color: #ff0000;">flfinwmr<br/>
<br/>
</span>glided towards the town<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
