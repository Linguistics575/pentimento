<br/>
</span>takes its present designation from the old name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siaut</span>.<br/>
Anubis, the jackal-headed divinity, formerly had her temples<br/>
and altars here. All animals of canine race were sacred to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">her-the </span>wolf <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially-hence </span>the Greek name of the town<br/>
Lykopolis, "the city of the wolf." In the caves of the<br/>
mountains which lie behind <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ossiut</span>, and which are a spur<br/>
of the Libyan chain, the embalmed bodies of animals of<br/>
the above family are still found in good preservation, and<br/>
in close proximity to famous mausoleums which date from<br/>
the times of the thirteenth dynasty (<span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span>. 2200), and which<br/>
belonged to high officers of state of that period. We<br/>
entered one of these chambers hewn in the rock. It<br/>
was large, but beyond its peculiar shape we found nothing<br/>
worth looking at inside it.<br/>
<br/>
Our party now divided; some of the gentlemen strolled<br/>
with their guns towards the town, while I <span style="color: #0000FF;">clambered<br/>
</span>through a narrow gorge to the ridge, and obtained a<br/>
beautiful view over the town, the Valley of the Nile, the<br/>
Arabian mountains opposite, and the orange plateau of the<br/>
Libyan mountains behind me.<br/>
<br/>
I descended by another path into the valley, down steep<br/>
rocks and among blocks and heaps of stone, passing many<br/>
funeral caves and some skeletons, and finally reached the<br/>
Mohammedan burying-ground. This very large Moslem<br/>
city of the dead, with its many fine monuments, deserves<br/>
to be visited. It extends westward from Siut, and reaches<br/>
at one end to the blooming gardens of the cultivated land,<br/>
and at the other to the desert waste.<br/>
<br/>
I walked back into the town, and lingered in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">streets<br/>
</span>of the remoter suburbs, watching the ways of the people, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
