<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">COURSIIVG </span>A HARE IN ZANTE. 17<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some friendly priests invited us in to take luncheon<br/>
in the convent. When we inquired about sport in their<br/>
parts, the godly men at once proposed that we should course<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>hare. When luncheon was over we started under the<br/>
guidance of the youngest priest, who wore a short frock,<br/>
broad blue trousers, and slippers. His head was adorned<br/>
with the priestly biretta, and he carried a long gun. Two<br/>
dogs, far removed from sporting breed, and a peasant<br/>
followed him.<br/>
<br/>
We mounted for more than an hour through a gloomy<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ravine-right </span>and left high hill slopes excluding any view;<br/>
nothing but smooth, dazzling white stones, the rocks<br/>
fringed with a narrow strip of dark evergreen shrubs. The<br/>
whole had the sunburnt character of so many mountain<br/>
districts of the South, such as those of Dalmatia <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Spain<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The dogs snuffed about among the stones, and the<br/>
priest with much energy sprang from rock to rock, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
</span>loaded gun at full cock, but nothing stirred. High aloft<br/>
some imperial eagles soared in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">air</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>I<br/>
<br/>
At last we reached the ridge of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mountain.. </span>A fine<br/>
view of the sea opened on us, and we could see far along<br/>
the mountain plateau<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>with its confusion of stones, rocks,<br/>
peaks, and points.<br/>
<br/>
We rested for about a quarter of an hour. We heard<br/>
several shots almost at hand, and soon some <span style="color: #0000FF;">peasants<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">appeared </span>with their guns. They had missed <span style="color: #0000FF;">one</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>of the<br/>
few hares of the island. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>On our way back I kept along the height, taking the<br/>
shortest way to the convent. Suddenly a small hare (probably <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lamas </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Medite1watteui1 </span>ran <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>in front of me. The<br/>
<br/>
