</span>recent track of a panther, and immediately after that of<br/>
the wounded boar, marked by plenteous trickling from the<br/>
wound. We soon attained the top of the ridge, and a<br/>
splendid view opened into a valley, not broad but rich<br/>
in all kinds of <span style="color: #0000FF;">vegetation-bushes</span>, meadow, and high<br/>
trees. On the opposite side steep cliffs rose and closed in<br/>
the view.<br/>

Following the same track, I hastened down the steep<br/>
decline to the bottom of the valley. Arrived there the<br/>
tracks led me across a meadow, between bushes, over a<br/>
stony brook and marshy places, to the edge of a thicket.<br/>
There I awaited the arrival of my two companions and<br/>
the Bedouins. The dogs were at once set on the track,<br/>
and in a few moments I heard the joyful sound of baying<br/>
and of a hot fight. Hastening through the thicket, I<br/>
reached a small meadow closed in by wood and shrubs;<br/>
within it a fierce fight was proceeding. The dogs bore.<br/>
themselves bravely, and tugged and bit their enemy, which<br/>
could still defend itself with vigour and courage. Seizing<br/>
a favourable moment, I sent a fatal shot at the powerful<br/>
boar, which had handsome tusks.<br/>
<br/>
I now had time to look at my surroundings. Between<br/>
the high trees and bushes I could see, at no great distance<br/>
in front of me, the sparkling surface of a sheet of water,<br/>
and could hear the rush of a river. I hastily summoned<br/>
my companions to share the joyful discovery. Thanks to<br/>
the pursuit of the wounded boar, our wish had been fulfilled,<br/>
and we had reached the river held sacred from <span style="color: #0000FF;">afar-the<br/>
</span>renowned Jordan. We hastened down the broken ground,<br/>
through luxuriant shrubs, to a sand-bank whence we could<br/>
