<span>38 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

was a picture so rich and grand in colour<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and so full of<br/>
points of natural and architectural interest, that it would<br/>
be difficult for imagination to conceive anything finer.<br/>
<br/>
The disused and ruined mosque of Kasr-el-Ain stands<br/>
amidst heaps of wreck and decay. Its old walls are<br/>
inhabited by quantities of stone-plovers, that curious marsh<br/>
bird of nocturnal habits. At nightfall they leave their<br/>
hiding-places with the shrill unceasing cry whose tones are<br/>
heard all night long in Egypt, and make for the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
We posted ourselves all along the mosque, and watched<br/>
for the appearance of this strange bird. As it grew dark,<br/>
several of them left their holes; but they were so swift,<br/>
that Hoyos was the only one among us who succeeded in<br/>
bringing one down. We scrambled over the ruins, pursued by the yelping of the dogs we had roused, and stared<br/>
at inquisitively by Arabs, who crept out of their holes, till<br/>
we regained our carriages.<br/>
<br/>
The drive home had to proceed slowly at first. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We<br/>
</span>could only <span style="color: #ff0000;">grope </span>our way in the darkness through the<br/>
complicated ruins of Old Cairo. We then came to gardens,<br/>
and at last reached the modern town, with its well-lighted<br/>
busy streets.<br/>
<br/>
On reaching home, we dined; and after dinner came<br/>
a brilliant torch-light procession, got up by our countrymen<br/>
in the gardens of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kasr-en-Nusha</span>. "God save the<br/>
Emperor<span style="color: #ff0000;">!</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>and their shouts and cheers, sounded strangely<br/>
through the still splendour of an African night. When<br/>
this ovation came to an end, we all retired to rest.<br/>
<br/>
Early on the 20th we drove through the older part of the<br/>
Arab quarters, to be present at Mass in the Coptic church<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
