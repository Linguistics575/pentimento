<br/>
"As the unknown is wont to charm more than the<br/>
known, and the past stimulates curiosity more than the<br/>
present, and as tradition yields more matter for enjoyment than well-ascertained historical facts, so the pilgrim<br/>
on the shores of the Red Sea lingers gladly in thought,<br/>
lost in reflection on the times of which history appears<br/>
to have kept no trace. Where was the spot of the sea at<br/>
which Pharaoh and his host were overwhelmed by its<br/>
waves? Where is the road by which Moses led his people<br/>
through the desert to Mount Sinai? These are questions<br/>
which force themselves on the Christian traveller in this<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">land</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>Inquirers into past and present have only been able<br/>
to answer them with more or less of probability.<br/>
<br/>
"The one fixed point which has aided their inquiries<br/>
is the site of the Wells of Moses, which lie on the Asiatic<br/>
side of the Bay of Suez, not far from the coast. These<br/>
springs are in a fertile oasis. Warm, salt, and bitter waters<br/>
bubble forth from funnel-like openings built up of Cypris<br/>
shells. The largest of these springs is built round like a<br/>
cistern, and is held to be the true Well of Moses which the<br/>
Jewish <span style="color: #0000FF;">law-giver </span>called forth from the rock, and whose<br/>
bitter waters he made sweet by a branch thrown into<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
"When the sun falls low at evening and sheds a purple<br/>
glow over the mighty masses of Mount Ataka, and the sea<br/>
between the coasts of Asia and Africa sends its transparent<br/>
emerald waves with gentle beats on the shore, and when<br/>
the colour slowly fades and loses itself, first in violet, then<br/>
blue, and at last dissolves in grey mist, then is this<br/>
simple and yet grand picture of nature first realized in <span style="color: #0000FF;">its<br/>
<br/>
