a carrion vulture and some kites. No great vultures had<br/>
come their way.<br/>
<br/>
We rode back through the tombs of the caliphs to the<br/>
nearest houses of the town, where our carriages waited.<br/>
The drive through the long line of the Muski took much<br/>
time, for, in the early evening hours, a vast throng of<br/>
human beings moves up and down these purely Arab<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">streets.. </span>h<br/>
<br/>
At the furthest end of the eastern quarter, at the<br/>
beginning of the Muski, close to the European town, is<br/>
the workshop of the famous Parvis, a native of Trieste.<br/>
This extraordinarily skilful workman produces Oriental<br/>
things of all descriptions, and notably fittings for rooms.<br/>
The Austro-Hungarian colony here have given me <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>complete set of everything belonging to a smoking-room, in<br/>
perfectly correct Eastern style. So we stopped on our <span style="color: #ff0000;">way</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
</span>home at Parvis' to inspect this just completed and <span style="color: #0000FF;">most<br/>
</span>charming suite. After a short stay, we returned to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasren-Nusha</span>, where we dined and went early to rest.<br/>
<br/>
We were to leave Cairo next day, on a hunting party <span style="color: #ff0000;">in'<br/>
</span>the province of Fayum, to be followed by the voyage up<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
