<br/>
on the 17th the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar </span>ran into the harbour of Corfu<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Peals of bells greeted us. It was the Palm Sunday of the<br/>
Greeks, and a procession with banners and richly dressed<br/>
priests, followed by country people in picturesque costumes,<br/>
moved along the strand. Our coal supply had to be made<br/>
good, so we employed the time in an expedition to the Bay<br/>
of Ipsa. Our boat put in beside a small country house, and<br/>
we climbed through blooming gardens, and an oak copse<br/>
coming into luxuriant leaf, to a height whence we obtained<br/>
a view over the beautiful island and the Albanian mountains of the opposite coast. When we returned to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mimmar </span>and continued our voyage, <span style="color: #0000FF;">.the </span>afternoon was calm,<br/>
the air warm, and we glided past a beautiful coast view.<br/>
<br/>
On the 18th we <span style="color: #0000FF;">awoke </span>at Punta d'Ostro. As most of<br/>
my companions were unacquainted with the Bocchi di<br/>
Cattaro, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar </span>steamed between the high grey cliffs<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>melancholy but magnificently situated Cattaro. We<br/>
made a short expedition into the little town, and admired.<br/>
the varied and picturesque dresses of the peasantry. A<br/>
special charm seems to rest on this wild rocky highland<br/>
district, inhabited by chivalrous valiant mountaineers.<br/>
<br/>
In the afternoon we reached Lacroma, and landed at<br/>
once on my small but <span style="color: #0000FF;">enchanting </span>island. Everything was<br/>
green and flowery, and for the last time we breathed a truly<br/>
southern air and enjoyed the sunbeams of a real spring day.<br/>
We were rowed over in a boat to Ragusa, the ancient<br/>
Dubrownik of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sclaves</span>, and took a walk round the<br/>
town, rich in palaces and handsome buildings.<br/>
<br/>
We passed the night on board the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ariramar </span>in the<br/>
harbour of Gravosa. The 19th brought us a rough <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea<br/>
<br/>
