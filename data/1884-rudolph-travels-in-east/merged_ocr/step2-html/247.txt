</span>hand, the burying-place at Assuan has far greater natural<br/>
charms to show than that below the citadel of Cairo. The<br/>
bare hills which close the valley, the white stone desert<br/>
with its wild rocks, the splendid colouring, enriched by the<br/>
beams of the sun of <span style="color: #0000FF;">mid-Africa</span>, have a distinguishing stamp<br/>
of their own.<br/>
<br/>
We rode in burning heat along the northern side of the<br/>
broad valley, through the disordered maze of the city of<br/>
the dead. After a time the graves became more and more<br/>
sparse, and gradually the last trace of human hands disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
N 0 blade of grass is here to gladden the eye; nothing<br/>
but bare stone, sand, and dust. At the same time the desert<br/>
is not level, and one hill follows another.<br/>
<br/>
Some singularly shaped blocks of granite indicated the<br/>
nearness of the quarry. Soon we saw a cliff, and below it,<br/>
partly covered with rubbish, the obelisk is lying. Respecting it, as well as about Assuan in general, I will here <span style="color: #0000FF;">quote </span>some words of my friend Brugsch<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Assuan (old Egyptian Suan, Greek Syene) is the<br/>
southernmost frontier town of Egypt. It is now inhabited<br/>
by Arabs and Egyptians, and much visited by the neighbouring tribes of the desert from as far as the Red Sea.<br/>
The rocks of the granite region, which begins here, are<br/>
covered with rich inscriptions of all epochs, which distinctly<br/>
announce the presence of Egyptian officials passing through.<br/>
By command of the Pharaohs, the rich stone quarries to<br/>
the south-east of the town, at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">so-called'red </span>mountain,'<br/>
were worked by thousands of labourers, who here quarried<br/>
from the hard rock the stone employed for obelisks, statues<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
