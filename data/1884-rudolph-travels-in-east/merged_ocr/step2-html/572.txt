<span>380 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
under cloudy sky, scuds of rain, and a very cold wind. The<br/>
voyage among the Dalmatian islands, generally so <span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful</span>, yielded us therefore little enjoyment. We remained<br/>
for the evening and night at Zara. <span style="color: #0000FF;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>On the 20th we started early from the capital of Dalmatia, and reached Trieste in the afternoon amidst rain and<br/>
under cloudy skies. We spent a very enjoyable day there,<br/>
and left in the afternoon of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">21st</span>, taking an affecting<br/>
farewell of the commander and officers of the faithful<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar</span>. At Karst we sent our last adieus to the beautiful<br/>
sea, for we were now to belong for a long period to term<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fimm</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The night passed quickly. We dreamt of Bedouins on<br/>
Arab horses, of slender minarets, of<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>lofty mountains, of<br/>
boundless deserts, of the sacred Nile, of waving palm-trees<br/>
and sycamore forests, and of the mysteries of the temples<br/>
of Isis. Soon our pleasant visions were dispelled by reality.<br/>
Waking at the Semmering we were greeted by a rough<br/>
north wind, ice, and a mantle of snow. In Vienna, heavy<br/>
clouds covered the sky, and the travellers, accustomed to<br/>
the sun of the South, shivered in the damp cold atmosphere<br/>
of Northern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Europe</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t<br/>
<br/>
</span>The journey was over and the travellers separated, but<br/>
their thoughts still turned back irresistibly to the distant<br/>
East.<br/>
<br/>
Hail to thee, thou golden, glorious, sunlit East!<br/>
