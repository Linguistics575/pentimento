<span>MASS IN THE CHAPEL OF THE NATIVITY. 313<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ravines of Palestine, especially in the evening. One can<br/>
imagine how well adapted such spots are to wild beasts;<br/>
hyaenas, wolves, and jackals assemble and howl by the old<br/>
tombs. I left the damp chill place before it grew quite<br/>
dark, and hastened past the village to the camp. A<br/>
shadow flitted by me, and on a chance shot a poor<br/>
stork fell mortally wounded<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Next morning we started early and rode to Bethlehem.<br/>
There was again a great crowd, and it was with difficulty<br/>
that we pushed through to the church door on our neighing,<br/>
capering horses. The Franciscans accompanied our party<br/>
to the Chapel of the Nativity, where the chaplain said<br/>
Mass. The public had pressed after us into the holy places<br/>
underground, and some wonderfully beautiful women of<br/>
Bethlehem knelt on the bare rock, strangely lighted by<br/>
the dull glow of the lamps..<br/>
<br/>
After the service we hastened to the square where our<br/>
horses stood. A great surprise awaited me there. On the<br/>
terrace of a house lay a colossal hyaena with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">wondrous<br/>
</span>skin and long mane, and beside it two jackals smaller and<br/>
different in colour from that of the previous day, but larger<br/>
than, and differing altogether in appearance from, the<br/>
Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">aureus</span>. The poison had taken effect.<br/>
The day before, the head of the ass which was left had been<br/>
saturated with a strong dose of strychnine and left on the<br/>
spot. Naturally the <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-starved </span>beasts of the lonely spot<br/>
fell greedily on the dainty morsel and found in it speedy<br/>
death. I sent the prize on the back of a donkey to the tent<br/>
of our skin-dresser.<br/>
<br/>
We rode back the same way as the day before to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantur<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
