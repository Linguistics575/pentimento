<span>BEATING A SUGAR-CANE PLANTATION. <span style="color: #ff0000;">101<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>This time, my neighbour on the left shot first, and killed<br/>
with one shot a fair-sized wolf. Immediately we heard the<br/>
crack of a rifle from one of the gentlemen on the left flank.<br/>
He rolled a wolf over, which, however, picked itself up,<br/>
and then, bleeding freely after a second shot, left the canes,<br/>
and, fired at a third time, took to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">open</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>A few minutes later, my neighbour to the right killed a<br/>
middle-sized wolf with one shot. The moment after, a wolf<br/>
leaped out between him and me and across the canal and<br/>
away. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>each of us fired after him as he went off, and<br/>
saw him dragging himself, badly shot, among the browsing<br/>
buffaloes towards the fields of standing grain.<br/>
<br/>
When the heaters appeared, we let them go through the<br/>
field a third time. I soon perceived that something was<br/>
coming my way, and saw a pretty large wolf moving quickly<br/>
through the cane. A lucky shot laid him low. A few<br/>
minutes later, my neighbour on the left shot another wolf,<br/>
wounding him so <span style="color: #0000FF;">severely</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>he crawled with difficulty<br/>
into the adjacent <span style="color: #0000FF;">bean-fields</span>. Two wolves escaped<br/>
unharmed at points where the guns were too far apart.<br/>
<br/>
In the last drive, one of the gentlemen shot an ichneumon, wounding it severely, but it dragged itself into the<br/>
thick <span style="color: #ff0000;">canes</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>made a short search for the wounded<br/>
wolves, but with fields reaching as far as the eye could see,<br/>
it was naturally fruitless.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>now went to the opposite end of the cane plantation, where our accomplished dragoman had ordered some<br/>
riding-horses and donkeys to meet us. The wolves were<br/>
carefully packed on the back <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>donkey, and the caravan <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>soon in motion again. The beaters dispersed in <span style="color: #0000FF;">different<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
