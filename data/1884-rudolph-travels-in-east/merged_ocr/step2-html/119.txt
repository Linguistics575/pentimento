"They name the king <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertasen </span>I. (who ruled in the<br/>
middle of the third century B.C.) as its founder, and state<br/>
that the erection of this massive monolith <span style="color: #ff0000;">of.syenite </span>coincides with the commencement or recurrence of an astronomic period of thirty years. Its point was formerly coated<br/>
with shining sheets of copper, which, in the time of the<br/>
Middle Ages, were sold by the Arabs. The spot on which<br/>
the obelisk stands marks also the position of the principal<br/>
entrance into the most ancient sanctuary of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sun-god</span>.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">rampart-like </span>boundary walls, which still remain, indicate at the same time the total extent of the formerly<br/>
existing groups of temples. We may further remark<br/>
that, according to the evidence of papyri of the thirteenth<br/>
century before our era, Heliopolis was a strongly fortified<br/>
place, which formed the southernmost point of the long<br/>
line of fortifications which stretched past Bubastis (<span style="color: #0000FF;">now'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tell </span>Bast) and Tanis (the <span style="color: #0000FF;">loan </span>of the Bible, and now<br/>
called San), as far as Diospolis (now Damietta) on the<br/>
Mediterranean, and were designed to protect the territory<br/>
of the Delta against the attacks of hostile tribes from the<br/>
East<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>The road from Cairo to these old ruins is now marked<br/>
by a causeway, which runs for a length of nearly five<br/>
English miles along the edge of the desert, broken at several<br/>
points by building ground or plantations. When you leave<br/>
the iron gate (Bab-el-Hadid) of the City of the Caliphs<br/>
behind, the long road opens in front, bordered on each <span style="color: #0000FF;">side<br/>
</span>by trees, and affording an extensive view over the desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
