<span>BAZAAR AT DENDERA. <span style="color: #0000FF;">183<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>The narrow streets of clay houses, whose architectural<br/>
ornamentation and high minarets bespoke the importance<br/>
of the place, were full of life. A lucky chance led us<br/>
through the crowded streets to the brilliant bazaar,<br/>
covered with matting and well lighted, and whose busy<br/>
traders pressed eagerly and noisily round us. Following<br/>
the long line of stalls we escaped from the dust, steam,<br/>
and stench which, especially in the evening, pervade<br/>
Eastern towns, and hastened back to our steamer. The<br/>
other gentlemen had also returned with some game, so that,<br/>
with our liberal contribution, the short hunting expedition<br/>
at Keneh made a very good show.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>continued our voyage on the 13th, in splendid<br/>
weather. From sunrise to midday we made no halt, and<br/>
arrived where the mountains of Gebel Tuk come close to<br/>
the eastern bank of the stream. The look of the country<br/>
pleased us, and we resolved to get some exercise by<br/>
landing on the broken banks. No village, no house <span style="color: #ff0000;">was'<br/>
</span>near, only the wildly cleft mountain rocks, separated from<br/>
the river by a meadow of a hundred paces' width at the<br/>
utmost.<br/>
<br/>
Scrambling among the heaps of stones and bare rifts,<br/>
I found many tracks of jackals and some burrows, and<br/>
therefore turned my dachshunds in and let them search the<br/>
deep gullies, but unhappily with no result.<br/>
<br/>
I also failed in my efforts to creep up to the birds<br/>
of prey sitting on the hill-tops and rocks. In those <span style="color: #ff0000;">illstarred </span>attempts at sport I found some old hollow tombs,<br/>
and in them, together with bones, the remains of a mummy<br/>
--perhaps merely the flesh and muscles, parched by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hot<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
