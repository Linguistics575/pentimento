<br/>
evening on the steamer, passed the night there. At<br/>
daybreak on the 2nd of March we continued our voyage,<br/>
and spent the forenoon on deck, watching the beautiful<br/>
but not very varied landscape. Green fields, groves of<br/>
dom and date palms, some small towns, and the mountains<br/>
which hem in the valley glided past us in unbroken uniformity. On the long sand-banks there was, however, this<br/>
morning unusual animation. Great flights of pelicans,<br/>
herons, and geese were seen; and my huntsman maintained confidently that he had seen a crocodile.<br/>
<br/>
At noon we reached Keneh, a tolerably sized town of<br/>
houses built of clay, and adorned with a high minaret.<br/>
We landed on the broken ground of the opposite western<br/>
bank of the Libyan coast. Here we mounted on donkeys,<br/>
and riding past a graceful palm grove beside a very poor<br/>
looking village, in whose gardens the disgusting carrion<br/>
vultures were sitting on the dung-heaps, as though they<br/>
were domestic fowls, soon reached the well-tilled plain.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile here makes a bend and approaches very near<br/>
the Libyan mountains. The border of cultivation is consequently very narrow, and after half an hour's ride we<br/>
reached the great and famous temple of Dendera. Like<br/>
the ruins of Abydus, it lies close to the margin of the tilled<br/>
land, but is itself on desert sand.<br/>
<br/>
I. cannot do better on this occasion than avail myself<br/>
of the words of my friend Brugsch.<br/>
<br/>
"Dendera is the modern name of a much-visited temple<br/>
on the western bank of the Nile, opposite to the town of<br/>
Keneh, <span style="color: #0000FF;">z'.e</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cmnepolis </span>= new town, of the Greek geographers, which finds its full equivalent in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">name<br/>
