<span>SPORT AT CORFU. 9<br/>

by a richly gilt partition into two. Various blackened<br/>
pictures of saints, glittering ornaments, and some Greek<br/>
inscriptions are on the walls. On the terrace in front of<br/>
the church, flowering fruit-trees gladden the eyes of the<br/>
winter-weary northerner. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>from the island towards<br/>
Corfu and the sea is enchanting; a fitting home for<br/>
visionary hermits.<br/>
<br/>
The poor monks, however, had no <span style="color: #0000FF;">look </span>of thought or<br/>
devotion, but rather one of complete stupefaction from the<br/>
monotony of their life. The younger is a lover of cats, and<br/>
several half-starved specimens, mewing pitifully, followed<br/>
his steps. The opposite island has on it a building with a<br/>
tower, inhabited by a solitary recluse. After a brief visit<br/>
we resolved on a shooting party in our boats over the<br/>
marshy bay of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kardakio</span>.<br/>

Some herons, cormorants large and small, numerous<br/>
divers and ducks, as well as a host of sea-mews, took flight<br/>
at our first attempt to approach.<br/>
<br/>
The Greeks are like the Italians, they kill and <span style="color: #0000FF;">devour<br/>
</span>everything, so that sport in these countries is a very<br/>
uncertain pleasure. After long endeavour I succeeded in<br/>
bringing down a small cormorant, and content with this we<br/>
set our faces homeward.<br/>
<br/>
A beautiful view of the verdant coast of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Benizza</span>,<br/>
and the lofty Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hagioi </span>Decca, consoled us for our<br/>
unsuccessful sport. We soon rejoined the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar</span>.<br/>
It began to grow dark, the coaling was completed, and,<br/>
dinner over, we started once more. A bad night was to<br/>
follow on our tranquil day.<br/>
<br/>
Early on the 13th I woke to realize, to my no <span style="color: #0000FF;">small<br/>
