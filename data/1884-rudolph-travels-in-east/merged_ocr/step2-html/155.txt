<span>FIREWORKS ON THE ISLAND. <span style="color: #0000FF;">9</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>The storm abated, the sky cleared, and some pleasant<br/>
sunshine and beautiful effects of light cheered us. I did<br/>
not feel quite satisfied or at ease as to our prospect for the<br/>
next day until I saw a fishing-boat come quietly round the<br/>
western point of our island. They came from the west, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">-_were </span>going to the cultivated land, passing close to my<br/>
hiding-place in their course.<br/>
<br/>
Wild-looking brown fellows, in miserable rags, rowed<br/>
the boat, singing as they toiled ditties which sounded<br/>
gloomy and uncanny. A wonderful sight! Far or near no<br/>
trace of human activity<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">There</span>, beyond the lake, the<br/>
eternal desert, and here on its waters the native African<br/>
boat with its black tenants. The good people were not<br/>
a little surprised when <span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">taw </span>me, a European "paleface," on the barren island, heretofore only inhabited by<br/>
pensive. pelicans. My companion began a long <span style="color: #0000FF;">conversation </span>with the travellers, of which I could only make <span style="color: #ff0000;">out<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">that </span>it related to the weather and the crossing.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>got proportionately very little game this day. The<br/>
island had been exhausted. After dinner our Arabs let<br/>
off some fireworks, the delight of all Orientals, and made<br/>
a most fearful din. We did not <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jet </span>them go on very long,<br/>
for to pass the night quietly and not to scare the game with<br/>
sudden glare was of more importance to us than the finest<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">firewOrks</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>of our worthy dragoman.<br/>
<br/>
Very early on the 26th, long before the break of day,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">.we </span>left our tents. We started after a hurried breakfast.<br/>
The water was quite calm, so<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>that we were able to cross<br/>
the lake to the desert side. In the evening we were <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>find our camp transferred to the opposite coast, on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
