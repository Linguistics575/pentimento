<br/>
</span>WE started before nightfall. The shades of evening covered<br/>
the misty outlines of the lofty hills of the Asiatic coast.<br/>
The waves beat high and some unquiet hours began. The<br/>
whole of the 13th was spent on the open sea in chilly<br/>
weather. Heavy clouds hung over the sky, and there was<br/>
stillness on the deck of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar</span>. Those of the travelling party who were well enough to appear on deck watched<br/>
the play of the waters, lost in thoughts of the glorious East.<br/>
In the quiet season sure to follow a time of such deep and<br/>
varied interest one dwells long on the memories of happy<br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
The 15th of April brought us less sea and the sight of<br/>
the Island of Candia, so rich in natural charms. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We<br/>
</span>passed close along the coast, admiring the <span style="color: #0000FF;">snow-clad </span>Mount<br/>
Ida. On the 16th we saw Cape Matapan, the Greek<br/>
mountains, and in the afternoon, Zante. We passed from<br/>
between the island, decked in all its spring glories, and the<br/>
Grecian mainland to the sombre summits of Cephalonia.<br/>
In a splendid moonlight we passed the famous channel of<br/>
Ithaca, the home of Ulysses, and saw the rock of Sappho<br/>
and the islands consecrated by Greek mythology. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Early<br/>
