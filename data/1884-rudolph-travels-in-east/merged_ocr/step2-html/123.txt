<span>OUT IN THE DESERT. 65<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
in a moment a jackal came full gallop past under the<br/>
wall. A successful shot brought him down. I rescued<br/>
my booty with difficulty from the assaults of the excited<br/>
dogs which had followed the track closely.<br/>
<br/>
It was a specimen of the true African jackal--a <span style="color: #ff0000;">reddishyellow</span>, thin, long-legged beast with pointed ears. Amongst<br/>
my comrades, Hoyos had been so fortunate as to secure<br/>
a pretty large she-wolf of the African species, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cam's<br/>
</span>Lupaster.<br/>
<br/>
When we had had the garden beaten a second time<br/>
with the help of some natives, a second wolf appeared. I<br/>
heard it rustling in the bushes, and my huntsman even saw<br/>
it, but unluckily the crafty beast escaped unharmed over the<br/>
wall. Two wood-snipe were also seen, but not within shot.<br/>
Cranes soared aloft, and birds of various kinds abounded in<br/>
the leafy orange-trees.<br/>
<br/>
After short but very successful sport, we left the garden<br/>
and set out for home. The sun had set, the shadows grew<br/>
deeper, and twilight came on.<br/>
<br/>
The road, dangerous enough by day on the top of the<br/>
high narrow dyke, was little suited for the night, and so we<br/>
resolved to leave the canal which crosses the cultivated<br/>
land, and to drive straight across the desert. At first all<br/>
went well, but the strength of the horses soon gave way,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">shower </span>and slower they dragged the heavy carriages<br/>
through the deep sand. It would have taken us several<br/>
hours to reach Cairo in this fashion, and so, with the help of<br/>
some torch-bearers, we made our way back to the arable<br/>
land.<br/>
<br/>
We passed the garden of the Kub castle. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bats </span>flitted<br/>
