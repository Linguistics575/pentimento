rr8 TRA VELS IN THE EAST.

evening on the steamer, passed the night there. At
daybreak on the 2nd of March we continued our voyage,
and spent the forenoon on deck, watching the beautiful
but not very varied landscape. Green fields, groves of
dom and date palms, some small towns, and the mountains
which hem in the valley glided past us in unbroken 1oni-
formity. On the long sand-banks there was, however, this
morning unusual animation, Great flights of pelicans,
herons, and geese were seen; and my huntsman main,
tained confidently that he had seen a crocodile.

At noon we reached Keneh, a tolerably sized town of
houses built of clay, and adorned with a high minaret.
We landed on the broken ground of the opposite western
bank of the Libyan coast. Here we mounted on donkeys,
and riding past a graceful palm grove beside a very poor
looking village, in whose gardens the disgusting carrion
vultures were sitting on the dung-heaps, as though they
were domestic fowls, soon reached the well-tilled plain.

The Nile here makes a bend and approaches very near
the Libyan mountains. The border of cultivation is com
sequently very narrow, and after half an hour's ride we
reached the great and famous temple of Dendera. Like
the ruins of Abydus, it lies close to the margin ofthe tilled
land, but is itself on desert sand.

I. cannot do better on this occasion than avail myself
of the words of my friend Brugsch.

" Dendera is the modern name ofa much-visited temple
on the western bank of the Nile, opposite to the town of
Keneh, i,e. Caenepolis = new town, of the Greek geo-
graphers, which finds its full equivalent in the ancient name
