46 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.

 

After a short stay we left the hot rooms, from which
the horrible smell and the multitude of flies soon bid the
Western stranger to retreat.

Our course next lay past three mosques, remarkable for
their bright colours and slender lofty minarets. The first is

points of the brilliantly coloured picture,
