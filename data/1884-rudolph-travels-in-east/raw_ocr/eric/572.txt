380 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.

 

under cloudy sky, scuds of rain, and a very cold wind. The
voyage among the Dalmatian islands, generally so beau-
tiful, yielded us therefore little enjoyment. We remained
for the evening and night at Zara. I

On the 20th we started early from the capital of Dal-
matia, and reached Trieste in the afternoon amidst rain and
under cloudy skies. We spent a very enjoyable day there,
and left in the afternoon of the 21st, taking an affecting
farewell of the commander and ofﬁcers of the faithful
Miramar. At Karst we sent our last adieus to the beautiful
sea, for we were now to belong for a long period to term
ﬁmm.

The night passed quickly. We dreamt of Bedouins on
Arab horses, of slender minarets, of’ lofty mountains, of
boundless deserts, of the sacred Nile, of waving palm-trees
and sycamore forests, and of the mysteries of the temples
of Isis. Soon our pleasant visions were dispelled by reality.
Waking at the Semmering we were greeted by a rough
north wind, ice, and a mantle of snow. In Vienna, heavy
clouds covered the sky, and the travellers, accustomed to
the sun of the South, shivered in the damp cold atmosphere
of Northern Europe. .

The journey was over and the travellers separated, but
their thoughts still turned back irresistibly to the distant
East.

Hail to thee, thou golden, glorious, sunlit East!

THE END.
