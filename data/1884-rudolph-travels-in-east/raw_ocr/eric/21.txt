 

TRAVELS IN THE EAST.

CHAPTER I.

PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY—DEPARTURE FROM VIENNA—THE
SHIP “MIRAMAR”—CORFU—ZANTE—THE VOYAGE 'I‘O ALEXANDRIA.

MY Eastern tour had been quickly decided upon, and
the preparations for it were made with speed. Various
books of Eastern travel were rapidly looked through, and a
few days before our start the luggage, a skin-dresser with
all his apparatus, the servants, guns, plenty of ammunition,
and several dogs, were sent off to Trieste, where the yacht
Mz'mmar, which had graciously been placed at our disposal,
awaited us.
