seas. The waves of the Mediterranean ﬂowing from the
north washed the mouth of a sellimade natural canal, while
from the south the waters of the Red Sea broke through
the low-lying portions of the Arabian desert, and united
with the advancing current from the northern sea. The
united waters divided Asia from Africa for a space of
nearly seventy miles.

“In the course of time the surging of both seas neces-
sarily brought about the deposit of the sand they bore
along with them, and a bar was gradually formed which
grew into a dune and then into a mighty dyke. This it is
which, lying in the middle of the isthmus, or somewhat
north of it, now rises to a height of sixteen metres, and is
known as El-Gisr, zie. the dyke, ‘ the threshold.’

“This threshold, the highest point in the track we are
describing, was thus the only bridge by which the isthmus
could be crossed by land. We must assume that the
formation of the Delta went on at the same time. The
mud deposited at the periodically recurring ﬂoods of the
Nile resulted in the ﬁrst instance in the formation of the
cultivated land of Upper Egypt. In like manner deposits
were formed in the broad basin between the Libyan and
Arabian deserts, and extended to the present northern
boundary, and thus in the strictest sense of the words the
Delta came into existence as a gift from the Nile, whose
beneﬁcent waters pass through it in three principal and ﬁve
minor branches on their way to the Mediterranean. The
opposing current of the Mediterranean, deﬂected and
beaten back from the Syrian coast, has prevented the
formation of land on the eastern coast of the Delta. The
