THE ESKEBIYE’ GARDEN. 203

 

This garden is an extraordinary boon to the Cairenes,
especially in the hot part of the year. It is beautifully
laid out and well kept, and luxuriant and blooming by
favour of the climate. Its moment of greatest perfection
is at the full moon; and yet we were not satisﬁed. The
moonlight of Cairo seemed to us pale and dim compared
with that of glorious Assuan.

From the Esbekiyé Garden we made a round through
the old Arab quarter. \Ve had unwittingly chosen a very
favourable evening. The.Moslems were celebrating the
feast of the great El-Hossein, and thus we enjoyed, in
the streets near the mosque dedicated to him, the very
striking sight of an Oriental popular festival at night.

Great crowds moved up and down in the narrow streets.
The shops and Arab coffee-houses were open, and lighted
lamps and candelabra were fastened to the houses, and
bright carpets stretched across the streets. Glass lustres,
lighted, hung from coloured cords over the middle of the
streets, and all the houses were more or less brilliantly.
decorated according to the wealth of their owners. Every-
thing was gay with light, colour, and the most incredible
variety of triﬂes.

Moslems of every class and trade elbowed each other;
country folk in their blue shirts, screaming water-carriers,
wailing cripples and beggars, Bedouins in white burnous,
portly merchants, ﬁne gentlemen in gay and ﬂowing apparel
with green turbans on their heads, in token of descent from
the Prophet, soldiers and dealers of all kinds—all moving
together towards the mosque, which was bright with all its
lights streaming from the widely opened door.
