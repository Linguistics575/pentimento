Discussing the hunt we were about to begin. we marched
along the dyke of a broad but dry canal.

V_Vhen we had reached the spot, the guns were ﬁrst
placed. The Grand Duke remained at the corner beside
the canal; Hoyos and I stood at the side where the ﬁeld
came down to the foot of the canal dyke; the other
gentlemen surrounded all the sides of the cane plantation.
Unluckily, the guns were too few, and the spaces between
the individual sportsmen too considerable. Close to our
posts, buffaloes and camels were grazing, and unquestionably
the eusemélg had not the look of a wolf—hunt according to
European ideas.

The black drivers had hardly entered the canes, with
infernal yells, when my neighbour ﬁred right into the ﬁeld ;

me, and away with long springs over the canal. Though
the distance was a considerable one, I ran up on the dyke
and discharged my two barrels after the ﬂying beast, where-

right hind quarter wounded. '

more so did the Moors, of \vhom‘there were a considerable
number; each one came along gnawing the stalk of a
sugar-cane. We had the ﬁeld beaten a second time.
