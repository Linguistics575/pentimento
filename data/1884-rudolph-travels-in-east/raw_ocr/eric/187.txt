ARAB AlUSIC—THE BEE-D'AA’CE. HI

 

wild, confusion of sounds, passing back after a few joyful
chords into gloomy tones again.

In the south of Spain, where Moors abound, I heard,
especially amongst the gipsies, the same concerts; and the
music with which the southern Sclaves accompany their
gloomy songs of heroes, as they squat in winter evenings
round the ﬁre, and dream of the long-past days of
Kraljewic Marko, is in its essential form the same as the
wild strains which in Girgeh summoned to the merry dance.

The ﬁrst notes resounded, and the dancers appeared
in their long, tight-ﬁtting, bright garments, with slender
ﬁgures, their coin necklaces round their necks, and their
faces, as a matter of course, unveiled. A pretty Mooress
and a pale Circassian contrasted with the others, who
represented the pure fellaheen type. The features—the
wide nostrils, the low forehead, the sharply deﬁned nose,
and the small mouth—are the same that we see in the
characteristic likenesses of the ancient Egyptians. .

These dancers are a hereditary caste, despised by the
devout Moslems. They were banished from Lower Egypt
because of their dangerously seductive and irregular lives.
Now they frequent all the towns of Upper Egypt, to which
part of the country they originally belonged.

They generally live all together in remote quarters of
the town, and exhibit themselves for money among the
poorer classes of the population, and before curious
strangers. They are also a good deal employed in the
houses of the wealthy, where, after feasts and banquets,
while the pleasant chibouk and nargili are smoked, the
bee-dance is considered a great attraction.
