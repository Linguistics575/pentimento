A xlIOSLEM SAINT. log

 

The steamer stopped, and a boat approached. I asked
what it meant, and learnt to my no small surprise that
among these bare desert mountains, in a keep high above
the Nile, dwells a Moslem saint, a so-called Sheik, who
claims a toll. The vessel which should pass by regardless
of this due, is sure, according to popular belief, to be ship-
wrecked on its way. The honest skipper who pays is
attended on his voyage by the pious prayers of the saintly
beggar.

\Ve now passed in quick succession the towns of
Tachta, Faubas, and Shidawin, and the beautifully situated
large town of Sohag, with its picturesque houses and
minarets.

One lovely picture follows another; magniﬁcent moun-
tains with steep cliffs pass, to give place to palm forests and
motley towns. Smoking comfortably, talking, or reading,
one sits upon deck enjoying the pure air cooled by the river,
the balmy odours of African vegetation, and the beneﬁcent.
sunbeams. From time to time a shot is ﬁred at water-
birds in the distance, but almost always without ’effect. It
is an indolent life, but interesting and instructive.

In the afternoon we passed the considerable town of
El-Achmim, standing amongst palm-trees, and in the
evening the beautiful and wealthy town of Girgeh opened
on our view, well placed as it is on a high bank above the
Nile, at a sharp turn of the river.

A ﬁne sunset gilded the landscape. Everything, moun-
tain, stream, wood, town, and ﬁelds, was bathed in a wealth

of colour, the effect and power of which it is impossible to
describe.
