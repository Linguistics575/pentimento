dragged themselves painfully along, urged by blows from
their conductors. The effect of the great heat, the forced
marches from L'atrun before we reached Jerusalem, and
the recent want of water were very perceptible; almost
all the mules had sore backs from the weight of the
luggage, and broken knees.

After a ride of several hours I reached the entrance
of the valley of Abd—el-Kader, which runs in a north-
westerly direction between high mountains. As usual
a brook purled down its centre, and the banks were
covered with a more than usually abundant vegetation,
which followed the course of the stream across the plain
down to the Jordan. As the brook could only be ridden
across at one point, we were obliged to ride far into
the interior of the valley on its southern bank, and then
to retrace our steps for the same distance on the northern
side, to where the valley opened into the great plain, and
where, beneath a peculiar cone of rock at the border of ‘
vegetation, our camp was to be pitched.

The gentlemen had already arrived, but the caravans
were still a long way off, and so we had the pleasure of
waiting the arrival of the pack-horses in a little hollow
which afforded shade. Some of us employed this time
in searching for a bathing-place. The whole brook was
so ﬁlled with succulent plants of more than man’s height,
and oleander trees thickly covered with large red ﬂowers
of aromatic perfume, that one could scarcely reach the
water. Moreover, the whole air of the place had so
completely the look of a southern lair of serpents, and I
have such a respectful regard for the poisonous reptiles
