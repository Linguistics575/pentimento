1'62 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.

 

vivid manner, for the future generations of the world, the
memory of the past.”

When we had completed the survey of this famous city
of the dead, we rode across the plain back to our steamer.
We had now to take leave of beautiful Luxor, the glorious
remains of hundred-gated Thebes. The Theban plain lay
wrapped in the mists of the hot noontide, and framed by
its setting of lofty blue mountains. It was a wonderful
picture for our farewell greeting.

\Ve spent the afternoon on our voyage, passing pleasant
hours on the deck; a cooling breeze came over the river,
and one lovely landscape after another met our gaze. At
six pm. we put in at Keneh, and this time landed not on
the western bank of Dendera, but on the eastern, by the
modern city. .

We employed the evening in hunting in the neighbour-
hood. Hoyos and I rode across the rich and, at this place,
broad plain, and then followed the course of a canal much
frequented by game, where we shot a variety of birds.
We rode through the water-channel at a shallow place,
and returned towards the town, in whose neighbourhood,
and beside' smiling gardens, a palm-forest rears its proud
tops. V ‘

Kites, hawks, black-winged falcons, the large raven,
crows, screech-owls, and all kinds of small birds, sought the
shelter of this forest to roost. Knowing this, we hid
ourselves behind the thick stems of the date-palms, and
had easy and plentiful sport.

When twilight followed a ﬁne sunset, we rode back
along a dyke into the tolerably large town.
