THE RISE OF CAIRO. 43

 

and when, under Caliph Othman, Arabians settled in the
valley of the Nile, Fostat became the centre of government.
A school of learning was already in existence there when
Caliph Mamﬁn (813—833), the son of Harﬁn al-Raschid,
visited Egypt. Fostat became still more prosperous under
the Governor Ahmed ibn Tulﬁn, who made himself Sultan
of Egypt, and his building—loving successors. Scarcely a
hundred years later, Fostat lost its position as capital, when
Djéhar, general of Sultan Muizz, who had become ruler of
Maghreb (Tunis), conquered Fostat in the name of his

town. In this new town Muizz took up his abode, and
called it Masr-el-Kahira.

Cairo thus became the capital of the empire of the
Fatimee Caliphs, and advanced rapidly.

Muizz, son and successor of Aziz Billah, founded the
university, el-Azhar. Under his successor, Hakim, the town

walls, bestowed no less care on the city than the Fétimee
Caliphs had done. Several ofthe Mameluke Sultans, notably
KalaOn, El-Aschref-Chalil, Hassan, Barkﬁk, Kait-Bey and
El-Ghﬁri, adorned the town with handsome buildings, while
the inhabitants, it is true, suffered from the unbridled
tyranny of the greedy, plundering Mamelukes. In 1517,
the Osman Sultan, Selim I., put an abrupt end to the
further growth of Cairo. After the battle of Heliopolis, he
took Cairo by storm. The last of the Mameluke Sultans,
Tiiman-Bey, was hung at Béb-es-Zuwéle, April 15th, 1517,
