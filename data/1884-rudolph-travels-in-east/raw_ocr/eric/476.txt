320 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.

 

and the footpath led along the ridge of a high mountain
top, from which a splendid view opened. Immediately
below us was a steep declivity—at its base a circular valley
surrounded by high hills; right and left rose countless
summits, ridges, and far-stretching hills, all alike grey-green
-—a true landscape of the steppes. A narrow ravine—like
gorge leads out from the bottom_ in a south-easterly direc-
tion, and through it one catches a closely bounded view
of the deep-blue waters of the Dead Sea and the bare white
cliffs of the ﬁne range of mountains on the opposite coast.

The path descended in zigzags along the steep slope
below where we stood. The greater part of the pack-
horses of our caravan were still engaged in this difﬁcult
descent, to the ceaseless tinkle of their bells, while the
quickest had already arrived in the valley, and our un—
wearied servants were putting up the ﬁrst tents in a
stony ﬁeld.

The gentlemen went straight on, but the Grand Duke
and I preferred to wait on the ridge until the entire camp
was pitched, and meanwhile we had a kid slaughtered and
placed behind one of the summits which admitted of a
covered approach. Hundreds of vultures and eagles came
from the mountains of the Dead Sea and passed one after
another all in the same direction. They were taking their
daily promenade towards Jerusalem with punctual precision.
They did not condescend to bestow a single glance at our
kid. Only two ravens and one carrion vulture hovered
over the place, but without settling.

The sun was burning intensely, no air was stirring,
and not the smallest cloud dimmed the dark-blue sky.
