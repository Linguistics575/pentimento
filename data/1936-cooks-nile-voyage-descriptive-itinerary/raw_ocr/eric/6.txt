 

THE CHAFF CUTTER—ONE Ol" MANY UNUSUAL SIGHTS ALONG THE .\'ll.l“..

Fifth Day (Sunday).—The steamer leaves Asyut early in the
morning. Early risers will enjoy the delightful views over the
Nile Valley after sunrise. For a couple of hours the delicate
tints on the lofty sandstone cliffs, the broad ﬁelds of clover or
corn at their feet, the clusters of mud huts and palm trees that
form the native villages, and the broad bosom of the river itself,
make an irresistible appeal to the lover of colour, while the
ﬁrst low rays of the sun strike the white sails of the native
“ gyassas ” or the whitewashed wall of some villa on the river

bank.

This will be a pleasant day’s cruising past scenes typical of
the entire life of Egypt. Picturesque sailing boats, laden with
the produce of the land, are met at every bend, and villages and
towns of considerable size add to the animation of the river
banks. The steamer passes Abu Tig, a Coptic town with a
picturesque harbour, Tahta, with a number of ﬁne mosques,
Akhim, a centre of the weaving trade, Girga, with an ancient
convent, and Baliana, the starting point for Abydos. The visit
to this beautiful temple is postponed until the return journey,
as the ruins are so grand that they lose none of their charm
and novelty even after Karnak has been seen. The steamer
anchors for the night at Nag Hamadi.

Fl RST CATARACT VOYAGE

 

 

Sixth Day (Monday).—Some three miles beyond Nag Hamadi,
the steamer passes Hou, a large village at one of the sharpest
bends in the river. A white Arab tomb marks the burial place
of Sheikh Selim, who sat naked on the river bank for 53 years
and was believed to possess great powers in assisting navigation.
Every craft passing upstream gave him alms in return for his
goodwill, and though he died in 1891, the custom still persists,
to the beneﬁt of his descendants. A bag containing the offerings
of the crew is dropped into a small boat which comes alongside
the steamer for the purpose.

Continuing past more native villages and towns, including
Kena, noted for its dates and its porous drinking vessels, which
are transported in thousands to Cairo and Alexandria, the
steamer arrives at Dendera, for a visit to its beautiful temple.
This is one of the best preserved temples in the country. Built
in the ﬁrst century B.(‘., it'is dedicated to
l‘lathor, the Egyptian Venus, and is closely
associated with the beautiful Cleopatra. The
famous portraits of Cleopatra and her son
Cmsarion are on the end wall of the exterior.
The famous Zodiac of Dendera, now in the
Bibliothequc Nationale in Paris, was taken from
the shrine of Osiris on the temple roof.
