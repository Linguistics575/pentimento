THE VOYAGE TO
The Second Cataract

ASWAN TO WADI HALFA AND BACK
By 5.5. “Thebes”

This seven~day voyage beyond --\swan to \Vadi llalfa and
back takes the traveller into one of the most fascinatim:r
parts of Egypt~the strange land of Nubia,where the Nile
flows deep and wide between rocky banks broken at inter-
vals by stretches of desert, with purple hills ever lending
an air of enchantment to the distant view. In its ancient
monuments, Nubia affords glimpses of the perpetual
border warfare between Egypt and Ethiopia—a warfare
which dates back to the earliest dynasties of Egypt itself
and continued even when it was a far-Hung‘province of the
Roman Empire.

First Day (Saturday).—I’assengers leave the “ Egypt,” “ Sudan ”
or “ Arabia " at Aswan after breakfast, and after visiting the
great Aswan Dam, embark on the “ Thebes " in time for lunch.
The manager will arrange for baggage to be transferred to the
“ Thebes.”

Leaving Shellal (Aswan) at l p.m., the "l‘hebes ” at once
enters Lower Nubia, passing through the rocky and mountainous
region forming the head of the First Cataract. Several picturesque
villages are seen along the banks, including Dabod, where there
is a temple of an Ethiopian King, and Kartassi, where the stone
for the 'l‘emple of I’hila' was quarried.

The. ﬁrst call is at Kalabsha, which has two temples of con-
siderable size and beauty. 'l‘he larger temple is one of the ﬁnest
in Nubia, comparatively well preserved. In some of its chambers
are paintings of the highest technique and brilliance. The
second temple is hewn in the rock of a hill-side and is adorned
with delightful reliefs illustrating events in the career of its
founder, Rameses the Creat.

Leaving Kalabsha, the steamer proceeds to Gerf Hussein
and anchors for the night.
