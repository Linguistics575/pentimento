 

 

FIRST CATARACT VOYAGE

Second Day (Thursday).—-I_.eaving Ayat at daylight, the steamer
continues past ever-changing scenes of native life. Several
islands are passed and presently the mountains begin to recede
from the western bank while those on the eastern hank extend
to the edge of the river in the form of cliffs. On the eastern
bank is seen the Coptic convent of Deir Mar Antonios, which
is also the starting point for a caravan route to the Red Sea.
The ﬁrst town of importance is Beni Suef, the capital of a
province. Then come numerous villages scattered among palm
groves, and, on the eastern bank, the rocky slopes of Gebel-el-
Teyr, or the “ Bird Mountain,” rising sheer from the water.

Tradition relates that all the birds of Egypt assemble on the
Bird Mountain once a year, and, when departing, leave one
solitary bird on guard until the following year. Upon the
summit stands a Coptic Convent. A restful and fascinating
day’s cruise ends when the steamer anchors for the night near
Minia, a provincial capital and centre for the cotton trade of

Upper Egypt.

A MARKET ON THE NILE BANK.

Third Day (Friday).——The steamer arrives in the morning at
Beni Hassan, where an excursion is made to the; grotto of Speos
Artemedos and to the rock tombs—a ride of about forty minutes,
ﬁrst through pleasant ﬁelds, then along the edge of the desert,
which stretches away in tawny solitude into the far distance.

Dedicated to the cat-goddess Pakhet, the Speos Artemedos
is a rock cavern bearing a number of inscriptions, including one
in praise of the reign of Queen Hatshepsut. The 'rock tombs,
of which there are thirty-nine, are among the most interesting
in Egypt, adorned by numerous inscriptions and coloured
representations of early Egyptian domestic scenes.

Two of the principal tombs will be visited—those of Ameni
and Khnemhotep. 0n the walls of these tombs are paintings
depicting carpenters. boat-builders, shoemakers, potters, gold-
smiths and others at work as well as agricultural, hunting and
ﬁshing scenes. Also, on the tomb of Khnemhotep, is a picture
of a company of merchants from the East bringing wares for
sale in Egypt.

After leaving Ileni Hassan. the steamer continues up river
to Manfalut, a town of considerable size with a population of
several thousands.
