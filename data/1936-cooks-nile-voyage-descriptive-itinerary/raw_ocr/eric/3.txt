TH E VOYAG E TO

The First Cataract

CAIRO TO ASWAN AND BACK
By Steamers “ Arabia,” “ Egypt ” and “ Sudan ”

First Day (Wednesday).—Punctuall_v at H) a.m. the steamer
leaves Cook’s landing stage above the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge. The
view of Cairo from the steamer is delightful. Stately palaces on
either bank, countless minarets of mosques, the noble Mokkattam
Hills and the Citadel at the foot form a ﬁtting introduction to
the beauties of the Nile, whilst the three, great pyramids of
Giza rise in stately dignity over the western plain.

Gardens and waterside palaces slip by; belts of palm trees
quiver in the sun; on either hand the horizon stretches in a
serried line of orange-tinted mountains. The Tura Quarries,
where the stone for the Pyramids was hewn, and Helwan,
famous for its sulphur baths, are passed, and soon after lunch
the steamer arrives at Bedrechen.

Here cars will be in readiness for the drive to the site of
ancient Memphis, one of the most famous capitals of antiquity.
Striking evidence of its former glories is seen in its beautiful
alabaster Sphinx, ‘26 feet long and H feet high, and two colossal
statues of Rameses ll (“ Rameses the Great ”).

A visit is also made to the vast Necropolis, comprising relics
of almost everv era of Egyptian history. The Step Pyramid of
Sakkara rises in lonely magniﬁcence, 200 feet high. It was the
tomb of King Zozer, who ﬂourished nearly SJHND years ago.
You see also the Serapeum, with its subterranean tombs of the
Sacred Bulls, and the tombs of Ti and Ptah-Hetep (wealthy
citizens of ancient Memphis). revealing in their mural decorations
realistic representations of life in Egypt over 5,000 years ago.
Of great interest also are some proto-Doric columns discovered
a few vears ago.

The steamer anchors for the night near Ayat.
