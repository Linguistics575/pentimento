Private Steamers

ELIGHTFUL as is the life on the large Nile steamers, we

recognize that many travellers prefer complete privacy and
absolute independence of action; and to meet this desire we
maintain a ﬂeet of smaller steamers which are reserved exclusively
for private charter. We possess seven such private steamers,
specially constructed for the use of families or parties of friends
and designed to a very high standard.

The steamers vary in size and cabin arrangements, with
accommodation for six to thirteen passengers. Speaking
generally, the cabins are large and airy and many have private
bath adjoining. The water for all purposes is ﬁltered and the
rooms are heated by electricity in cool weather. The normal
period for a voyage by steamer from Cairo to Aswan and back
is one month, though many clients prefer longer.

Every facility of our service is placed at the disposal of those
who charter a private steamer. From the moment they land in
Egypt they may leave all travel details to the care of the dragoman.
In Cairo they enjoy the personal attention of our Manager there,
while our Catering Superintendent will wait on them at their
hotel to discuss all matters pertaining to the table. No doubts
need be entertained as to the standard of catering. The kitchen,
cabin and dining-room staff are specially selected men, well
trained in this work. For sightseeing on shore the best means
of conveyance available is reserved—be it automobile, carriage,
or the humbler (but nevertheless enjoyable) donkey.

Full particulars and plans of our private steamers are contained
121 a separate booklet, “ The Nile Voyage by Fri-rate Steamer.”

Baksheesh

HE ATTENTION of the Egyptian authorities has been

frequently drawn, both by visitors and by residents in the
country, to the evils resulting from the indiscriminate bestowal of
baksheesh to the inhabitants of the Nile villages, and other places
Visited by tourists during the winter season. Many of the
poorer inhabitants of those towns on the Nile which are most
visited by tourists, live almost entirely on what they can obtain
by baksheesh during the winter months; the easy means thus
offered of obtaining a small livelihood prevents their adopting
any form of labour; and children are brought up to regard the
tourist season as the period during which they may, by clamorous
begging, enable their parents and themselves to lead a life of
idleness for the remainder of the year. The unhealthy tendency
of such a system is obvious. -

On the other hand, from the point of view of the Nile travellers
themselves, the inconveniences of this universal mendicity are
equally obvious, and, as time goes on, cannot fail to increase
unless some means are adopted for checking the practice.

It would be extremely difﬁcult for the Government to devise
an effective remedy for this state of things. The real remedy
rests with the travellers themselves. If money were, in future,
only bestowed in return for some actual service rendered, or in
cases of evident and established distress, the present pernicious
habit of begging would soon die out, to the advantage both of
the people and of the visitors.

It is with this conviction that we venture to express a hope
that tourists, when travelling in Egypt, will lend their aid to
this important reform by abstaining from the distribution of
money in response to mere demand for baksheesh, bestowing
it only when the circumstances appear to them to warrant their
generosity.

Tourists should especially abstain from throwing money from
the decks of steamers on to the landing stages or on the banks
of the Nile for the purpose of witnessing the scramble for the
coins—such exhibitions are mischievous as well as degrading.
