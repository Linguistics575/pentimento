Khartoum

Khartoum, the seat of the Sudan Government, stands on the
tongue of land that divides the Blue from the White Nile, at an
altitude of about 1,200 feet above sea-level, and is a delightful
and healthy winter residence. In December and January the
whole of the Northern Sudan is at its best; the Nile is still
high, and the river shows to the greatest advantage. January is
the coolest month. The Grand Hotel, in which Thos. Cook 8:
Son, Ltd., have a Branch Oﬂice, is under the management of
the Sudan Government Railway.
