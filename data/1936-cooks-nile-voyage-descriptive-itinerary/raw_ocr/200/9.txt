Fl RST CATARACT VOYAGE

 

Tenth Day Iriiiay).-Passing through the gorge of Silsila, with
its vast quarries, hearing the cartouches (or seals) of Egyptian
Kings for several thousand years back, the steamer arrives at
Knmombo for a visit to the temple.

This temple is duplex, and in that respect unique. It was
dedicated to two deities and it combined two temples side by
side within the same building. Many of the paintings are
particularly brilliant. One item of interest which should not
be missed amongst the mural dtxurratiru1s, is a representation of
surgical instruments in use at the time. It is a surprising revela-
tion that many of them can he recognized as almost identical
with the instruments used at the present day.

As the steamer approaches Aswan the scenery undergoes a
complete change. Vegetation ceases in places and the desert
often evends clown to the river ban The sarulstone cli8's have
disappeared and huge granite rue t abound. Situated at the
Mm of the First Cataract, surrounded on all sides hy the desert,
Aswan is equipped with excellent hotels and otfe 3 all that “an
be desired 1 the traveller 11 search of health-giving pleasure.
Its climate w, particularly equable and in and around the town
is all abundance of verdure, made possible by the waters of the
Aswan Dam.

  

 

 

   

 

As a rule the steamer arrives at Aswan after lunch, and a
visit IS made to the island of Eleplrantine, including the famous
Nilometer and the Museum.

Eleventh Day (Saturday). - After breakfast, a visit is made to
the granite quarries, where lies an unfinished obelisk of czrlossal
dimensions, still undetached from the living rock; and from
there passengers proceed downstream to view the great Aswan
Dam, the largest of its kind and one of the most impressive sights
in Egypt. It has 180 sluices, arranged at four different levels,
and in places it is over 100 feet high. The afternoon is free,
giving opportunity to visit the town, where the bazaars are of
great interest. The view from the Cataract Hotel should not
he missed.
