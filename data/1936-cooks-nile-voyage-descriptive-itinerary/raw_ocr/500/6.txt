 

Fifth Day (Sunday).--' steamer leaves Asyut early in the
morning. Early risers will enjoy the delightful views over the
Nile Valley after sunrise. For a couple of hours the delicate
tints on the lofty sandstone cliffs, the broad fields of clover or
corn at their feet, the clusters of mud huts and palm trees that
form the native villages, and the broad bosom of the river itself,
make an irresistible appeal to the lover of colour, while the
first low rays of the sun strike the white sails of the native
' gyassas '' or the whitewashed wall of some villa on the river

bank.

This will be a pleasant day's cruising past scenes typical of
the entire life of Egypt. Picturesque sailing boats, laden with
the produce of the land, are met at every bend, and villages and
towns of considerable size add to the animation of the river
banks. The steamer passes Abu Tig, a Coptic town with a
picturesque harbour, Tahta, with a number of fine mosques,
Akhim, a centre of the weaving trade, Girga, with an ancient
convent, and Baliana, the starting point for Aby dos. The visit
to this beautiful temple is postponed until the" return journey,
as the ruins are so grand that they lose none of their charm
and novelty even after Karnak has been seen. The steamer
anchors for" the night at Nag Hamadi.
