Fourth Day (Tuesday) .-

Leaving Abu Simbel early, the
"Thebes' continues south11ards through scenery which
changes constantly. The beautiful foliage of the palm tree is no
longer seen, the verdure of the ri1 er banks has shrunk to a narrow
strip and the river flows through the desert, with sands glistening
like gold. Presently the palms of VVadi lialfa are seen in the
blue distance, standing out like a refreshing oasis.

Wadi Halfa, the first British post in the Sudan, is a well
organized community, 11'hose courteous British residents extend
to the "Thebes' visitors the facilities of their Sports Club,
with billiards, 21 librarv, newspapers, tennis courts, and a nine-
hole golf course. There is, moreover, an historic town, with
se1eral inte1esting relics of the campaign against the Mahdi,
including the house in which Osman Digna was for some time
a prisoner.

SECON D CATARACT VOYAGE

Fifth Day (Wednesday) .--By special launch 21 visit is made to
view the Second Cataract from the rock of Abu Seer. The height
of this rock is not extraordinary. lt commands, however, a
di7.'/1' 1'ie11'. The summit is a steep, overhanging ridge, carved
with the autographs of tra1elle1s, among 11 inch are some famous
names. From it the view is superb 21nd of a colour transcendent,
soft and harmonious.

As far as the eye can see the river whirls among its rocks,
and for nearly [ 00 miles is one long condensed cataract. It
hurls itself by a thousand miniature islands, some of which are
like polished ebony, while others are fringed with tufts of papyrus
reed and clumps of mimosa. Northwards are the mountains of
Egypt, pink shapes dissolving into pearl flushed with
pink. Eastwards lies a narrow stretch of wilderness, amber-
coloured now, purple at the end of day, and streaked with thin,
sandy ribbons. Southw, ards the Libyan desert wastes itself in
a vast, tawny hued plain.

Sixth Day (Thursday) .--The steamer leaves VV'adi Haifa for the
return voyage soon after the arrival of the train from Khartoum.
A call is made at Abu Simbel to give a further opportunity of
visiting the Temple.

Seventh Day (Friday) .--The "Thebes "arrives at Shellal in the
evening, and passengers transfer to the First Cataract Service
the next morning.
