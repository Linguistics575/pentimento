Seventh Day (Tuesday) .--It
is well worth an early rise to
enjov the approach to Luxor.
First the great obelisk and
the massive pvlons (gateways)
of Karnak come in view,
rising above palm trees. Then,
as the steamer rounds a bend
in the river, the colonnades
of the Temple of Luxor and
the white dwellings of Luxor
itself are revealed. The
steamer'remains at Luxor
for two davs.

The morning is devoted
to a visit to the great temples
of Karnak, notably the
Temple of C'honsu and the
stupendous Temple of Amen,
justlv considered to be one of
the wonders of the world.
The Temple of Chonsu,
which was dedicated to the Theban moon-god, was built
by Rameses Ill, and succeeding rulers added to its adornment
with numerous reliefs. Its entrance is formed by a pylon
105 feet wide, 33 feet thick and 5'.) feet high; but this is easily
eclipsed bv the gigantic portal to the Temple Of Amen, which is
370 feet wide, 49 feet thick and 1:11). feet high. This huge temple
was the work of many successive Iigvptian rulers and comprises
a Great Court, 333 feet wide by 276 feet deep, temples dedicated
to Sethos II and Rameses lIl, as well as the enormous pillared
vaostvle Hall, which covers an area equal to that of Notre-
Dame. Paris.

ln the afternoon the Temple of Luxor is visited. Though
not so overwhelming as that of Amen at Karnak. this noble ruin
is more beautiful in design ano is so well preserved as to show
adequatelv how imposing it must have been when it was built
by Amenophis Ill, one iof the most powerful Pharaohs of the
eighteenth dvnastv (INN-HI?) 15.0).
