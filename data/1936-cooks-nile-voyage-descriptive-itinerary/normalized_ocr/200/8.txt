THE BIG HAM, TN THE e

Ninth Day (Thursday) .-The steamer leaves Luxor at dawn.
The fertility of the western hank continues unbroken and the
neighbourhood of both banks is splendidly picturesque, with
tields, groves, and villages backed by the tawny sands and the
impressive hills. Approaching Isna the steamer passes the
Barrage of Isna by means ofa lock. This Barrage was constructed
in HHN' l to regulate the irrigation of the province of Qena. At
lsna a visit is paid tn the temple, which is only a short walk from
the river side. This temple is of the Ptolemaic period, but so
far unh' the vestibule has been excavated, the remainder being
completely buried under the town.



The steamer then proceeds to Edfu, where the Temple of
Horus stands in almost perfect preservation. This temple is, in
fact, practically complete, and, by comparison, enables one to
realize the true character of the wonderful monuments at Karnak
and Thebes. An ascent to the summit of the pylon is recom-
mended, the view being exceptionally attractive, not only over
the temple itself but also over the whole countryside.
