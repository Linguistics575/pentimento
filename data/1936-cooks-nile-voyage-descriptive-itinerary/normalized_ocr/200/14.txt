A PARTY



AT

SECOND CATARACT VOYAGE

Fifth Day (Wetinesday) .-By special launch a visit is made to
view the Second Cataract from the rock of Ahu Seer. The height
of this rock is not extraordinary. It commands, however, a
dizzy view. The summit is a steep, overhanging ridge, carved
with the autographs of travellers, among sshich are some famous
names. From it the view is superb and of a colour transcendent,
soft and harmonious.

As far as the eye can see the river whirls among its rocks,
and for nearly IOU miles is (me long condensed cataract. It
hurls itself by a thousand miniature islands, some of which are
like polished ebony, while others are fringed with tufts of papyrus
reed and clumps of mimosa. Northwards are the mountains of
Egypt, pink shapes dissolving into pearl flushed with
pink. Eastwards lies a narrow stretch of wilderness, amber-
coloured now, purple at the end of day, and streaked 11 h thin,
sandy ribbons. Houthwards, the Libyan des.ert wastes itself 111
a vast, tawny- hued plain.

Sixth Day (Thursday) .--The steamer leaves Wadi Halfa for the.
return voyage soon after the arrival of the train from Khartoum.
A call is made at Abu Simhel to give a further opportunity of
visiting the Temple.

Seventh Day (Friday) .-The bb Thehes "arrives at Shellal in the
evening, and passengers transfer to the First Cataract Service
the next morning.
