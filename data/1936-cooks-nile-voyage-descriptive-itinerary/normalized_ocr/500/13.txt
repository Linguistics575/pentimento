SECON D CATARACT VOYAGE

Second Day (sunday) .-At Gerf Hussein an early visit is made
to the rock-hewn temple, which was built by Rameses the Great
in honour of the gods, Ptah, Sekhmet, Hathor and Anuket. It
reflects the impressive solemnity and grandeur characteristic of
the works of Rameses, and it contains some huge statues repre-
senting him in the guise of Osiris, as well as many other statues
and reliefs.

In the afternoon the steamer arrives at Wadi Sahoa," the
Valley of the Lions" with an avenue of statues of Rameses II
and sphinxes leading up to the Temple which is visited. This
is a well-preserved structure, partly built of sandstone and
partly excavated in the rock, and was dedicated to Amun and
the sun-god Ra-Harakhte. It includes a large Hypostyle Hall,
constructed from the rock, the roof being supported by twelve
pillars, and various representations of Rameses are found in
several chambers leading from the main hall.

Continuing up-river, the steamer passes Korosko, with its
palms and its glittering escarpments sinking to the water's edge.
Korosko was the time-honoured starting point for caravans
across the desert to Khartoum, and it was by this route that
General Gordon passed southward on his fatal journey of 1884.

The steamer anchors for the night at Amada.

Third Day (Monday) .--? visit is made to the Temple at Amada--
a small but exquisitely sculptured structure with an inscription
recording how Amenophis 11, one of its founders, slew seven
kings with his own hand. The steamer then'continues south-
wards, passing Derr, the capital of Nubia, and Kasr Ibrim, a
sort of ruined Ehrenbreitstein perched on top of an abrupt
precipice and dating from Roman times.

As the steamer approaches Abu Simbel, the massive Temple
comes into view. Here the ideals of Egyptian sculptors are
carried out to perfection. The aim is grandeur and solemnity;
and Egypt has no grander or more solemn figures than the
four colossal statues of Rameses the Great, which are carved
out of the hill-side, looking over the river to the vast desert
beyond. Each 65 feet in height, the statues are a triumph of
artistic skill in the moulding of the human form out of monstrous
piles of rock. Grave and dignified they sit, feet apart, hands
on their knees, a smile on their gigantic lips, which curve with
a delicacy which is amazing in figures so enormous.

The great Temple, like the statues, is hewn from the solid
rock and is divided into four compartments. The paintings
and sculptures are nowhere surpassed for beauty and some of
the friezes are almost panathenaic in their effect of multitudinous
movement.

A smaller temple, close by, is also visited. This is dedicated
to Hathor and the facade is ornamented with six statues of
Rameses, his wife, and children.
