Kings are revisited. The afternoon is <span style="color: #0000FF;">left </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">free </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>passengers<br/>
will find plenty to interest and entertain them in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luxor </span>itself.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fifty </span>years ago Luxor was a mere cluster of poorly built <span style="color: #0000FF;">mud<br/>
</span>houses, and it was due largely to the enterprise and energy of<br/>
Mr. John Cook, son of Mr. Thomas Cook, that it has grown into<br/>
the present clean and attractive town.<br/>
<br/>

dawn and Dendera is reached during the morning. The Temple<br/>
of Hathor is revisited. Continuing northwards<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the steamer<br/>
anchors for the night at Baliana, in readiness for a visit to the<br/>
magnificent ruins at Abydos on the following day.<br/>
<br/>
Sixteenth Day (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thursday</span>) .--<span style="color: #0000FF;">Passengers </span>are conveyed by donkeys<br/>
to Abydos, which was <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>of the most renowned cities <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ancient<br/>
</span>Egypt. Here is the wonderful Temple of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">lithe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">apntheosis<br/>
</span>of ancient Egyptian art. It differs from all other temples <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>having seven sanctuaries instead of one, whilst the workmanship<br/>
of the inscriptions and reliefs is incomparable. Its famous<br/>
"Tablet of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-a </span>list of seventy-six kings of Egypt,<br/>
beginning with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mena</span>, the first King of Egypt-is the most<br/>
wonderful genealogical record in the world.<br/>
<br/>
A visit will also be made to the cenotaph of Seti I, considered<br/>
by some authorities to be the tomb of Osiris. Its simple majesty<br/>
forms a fitting complement to the temple of the great King.<br/>
<br/>
Passengers return for luncheon <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the steamer, which then<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tel-el-Amarna </span>mark the time when it was a royal city. Founded<br/>
by Amenhophis IV when he became a convert to the exclusive<br/>
worship of the sun and <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew </span>from Thebes, it was richly<br/>
endowed with temples and palaces. But it was the royal abode<br/>
for only thirty years and was never again occupied. The ancient<br/>
streets and ground plans may easily be traced, and recent work<br/>
by the Egyptian Exploration Society enhances their interest.<br/>
