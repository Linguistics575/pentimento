</span>Second Day (Sunday) <span style="color: #0000FF;">.-At </span>Gerf <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hussein </span>an early visit is made<br/>
to the rock-hewn temple, which was built by Rameses the Great<br/>
in honour of the gods, Ptah, Sekhmet, Hathor and Anuket. It<br/>
reflects the impressive solemnity and grandeur characteristic of<br/>
the works of Rameses, and it contains some huge statues representing him in the guise of Osiris, as well as <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>other statues<br/>
and reliefs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i<br/>
<br/>
</span>In the afternoon the steamer arrives at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Salma</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the<br/>
Valley of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lions </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>with an avenue of statues of Rameses II<br/>
and sphinxes leading up to the Temple which is visited. This<br/>
is a well-preserved structure, partly built of sandstone and<br/>
partly excavated in the rock, and was dedicated to Amun and<br/>
the sun-god <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ra-Harakhte</span>. It includes a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hypostyle </span>Hall,<br/>
constructed from the rock, the roof being supported by twelve<br/>
pillars, and various representations of Rameses are found in<br/>
several chambers leading from the main hall.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing up-river, the steamer <span style="color: #0000FF;">pa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>Korosko, with its<br/>
palms and its glittering escarpments sinking to the water's edge.<br/>
Korosko was the time-honoured starting point for caravans<br/>
across the desert to Khartoum, and it was by this route that<br/>
General Gordon passed southward on his fatal journey of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1384</span>.<br/>

</span>Third Day (Monday) .--<span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>visit is made to the Temple at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amada-a </span>small but exquisitely sculptured structure with an inscription<br/>
recording how Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">H</span>, one of its founders, slew seven<br/>
kings with his own hand. The steamer then'continues southwards, passing Derr, the capital of Nubia, and Kasr Ibrim, a<br/>
sort of ruined Ehrenbreitstein perched on top of an abrupt<br/>
precipice and dating from Roman times.<br/>
<br/>
As the steamer approaches Abu Simbel, the massive Temple<br/>
comes into view. Here the ideals of Egyptian sculptors are<br/>
carried out to perfection. The aim is grandeur and solemnity;<br/>
and Egypt has no grander or more solemn figures than the<br/>
four colossal statues of Rameses the Great, which are carved<br/>
out of the hill-side, looking over the river to the vast desert<br/>
beyond. Each 65 feet in height, the statues are a triumph of<br/>
artistic skill in the moulding of the human form out of monstrous<br/>
piles of rock. Grave and dignified they sit, feet apart, hands<br/>
on their knees, a smile on their gigantic lips, which curve with<br/>
a delicacy which is amazing in figures so enormous.<br/>
<br/>
The great Temple, like the statues, is hewn from the solid<br/>
rock and is divided into four compartments. The paintings<br/>
and sculptures are nowhere surpassed for beauty and some of<br/>
the friezes are almost panathenaic in their effect of multitudinous<br/>
movement.<br/>
<br/>
A smaller temple, close by, is also visited. This is dedicated<br/>
to Hathor and the facade is ornamented with six statues of<br/>
Rameses, his wife, and children.<br/>
