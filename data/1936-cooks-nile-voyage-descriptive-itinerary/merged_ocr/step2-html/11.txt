revisited.<br/>
<br/>
Fourteenth Day (Tuesday) <span style="color: #0000FF;">.-In </span>the morning the Tombs of the<br/>
Kings are revisited. The afternoon is <span style="color: #0000FF;">left </span>free and passengers<br/>
will find plenty to interest and entertain them in Luxor itself.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fifty </span>years ago Luxor was a mere cluster of poorly built <span style="color: #0000FF;">mud<br/>
</span>houses, and it was due largely to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">enterprise </span>and energy of<br/>
Mr. John Cook, son of Mr. Thomas Cook, that <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>has grown into<br/>
the present clean and attractive town.<br/>
<br/>
Fifteenth Day (Wednesday) .--The steamer leaves Luxor at<br/>
dawn and Dendera is reached during the morning. The Temple<br/>
of Hathor is revisited. Continuing northwards, the steamer<br/>
anchors for the night at Baliana, in readiness for a visit to the<br/>
magnificent ruins at Abydos on the following day.<br/>
<br/>
Sixteenth Day (Thursday) .--Passengers are conveyed by donkeys<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos</span>, which was one of the most renowned cities of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ancient<br/>
</span>Egypt. Here is the wonderful Temple of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">apotheosis<br/>
</span>of ancient Egyptian art. It differs from all other temples in<br/>
having seven sanctuaries instead of one, whilst the workmanship<br/>
of the inscriptions and reliefs is incomparable. Its famous<br/>
"Tablet of Abydos<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-a </span>list of seventy-six kings of Egypt,<br/>
beginning with Mena, the first King of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt-is </span>the most<br/>
wonderful genealogical record in the world.<br/>
<br/>
A visit will also be made to the cenotaph of Seti I, considered<br/>
by some authorities to be the tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris</span>. Its <span style="color: #0000FF;">simple </span>majesty<br/>
forms a fitting complement to the temple of the great King.<br/>
<br/>
Passengers return for luncheon to the steamer, which then<br/>
proceeds to Abu Tig.<br/>

ashore on the following day.<br/>
<br/>
Eighteenth Day (Saturday) .--<span style="color: #ff0000;">Extensive </span>ruins and rock tombs at<br/>
Tel-el-Amarna mark the time when it was a royal city. Founded<br/>
by Amenhophis IV when he became a convert to the exclusive<br/>
worship of the sun and <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew </span>from Thebes, it was richly<br/>
endowed with temples and palaces. But it was the royal abode<br/>
for only thirty years and was never again occupied. The ancient<br/>
streets and ground plans may easily be traced, and recent work<br/>
by the Egyptian Exploration Society enhances their interest.<br/>
<br/>
The steamer leaves during the morning and Beni <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ha'an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
