<span>Private Steamers<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ELIGH'I'FUL </span>as is the life on the large Nile steamers, we<br/>
<br/>
recognize that many travellers prefer complete privacy and<br/>
absolute independence of action; and to meet this desire we<br/>
maintain a fleet of smaller steamers which are reserved exclusively<br/>
for private charter. We possess seven such private steamers,<br/>
specially constructed for the use of families or parties of friends<br/>
and designed to a very high standard.<br/>
<br/>
The steamers vary in size and cabin arrangements, with<br/>
accommodation for six to thirteen passengers. Speaking<br/>
generally, the cabins are large and airy and many have private<br/>
bath adjoining. The water for all purposes is filtered and the<br/>
rooms are heated by electricity in cool weather. The normal<br/>
period for a voyage by steamer from Cairo to Aswan and back<br/>
is one month, though many clients prefer longer.<br/>
<br/>
Every facility of our service is placed at the disposal of those<br/>
who charter a private steamer. From the moment they land in<br/>
Egypt they may leave all travel details to the care of the dragoman.<br/>
In Cairo they enjoy the personal attention of our Manager there,<br/>
while our Catering Superintendent will wait on them at their<br/>
hotel to discuss all matters pertaining to the table. No doubts<br/>
need be entertained as to the standard of catering. The kitchen,<br/>
cabin and dining-room staff are specially selected men, well<br/>
trained in this work. For sightseeing on shore the best means<br/>
of conveyance available is <span style="color: #0000FF;">reserved </span>be it automobile, carriage,<br/>
or the humbler (but nevertheless enjoyable) donkey.<br/>

</span>Baksheesh<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>ATTENTION of the Egyptian authorities has been<br/>
<br/>
frequently drawn, both by visitors and by residents in the<br/>
country, to the evils resulting from the indiscriminate bestowal of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">baksheesh </span>to the inhabitants of the Nile villages, and other places<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Visited </span>by tourists during the winter season. Many of the<br/>
poorer inhabitants of those towns on the Nile which are most<br/>
visited by tourists, live almost entirely on what they can obtain<br/>
by baksheesh during the winter months; the easy means thus<br/>
offered of obtaining a small livelihood prevents their adopting<br/>
any form of labour; and children are brought up to regard the<br/>
tourist season as the period during which they may, by clamorous<br/>
begging, enable their parents and themselves to lead a life of<br/>
idleness for the remainder of the year. The unhealthy tendency<br/>
of such a system is <span style="color: #0000FF;">obvious</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>On the other hand, from the point of view of the Nile travellers<br/>
themselves, the inconveniences of this universal mendicity are<br/>
equally obvious, and, as time goes on, cannot fail to increase<br/>
unless some means are adopted for checking the practice.<br/>
<br/>
It would be extremely difficult for the Government to devise<br/>
an effective remedy for this state of things. The real remedy<br/>
rests with the travellers themselves. If money were, in future,<br/>
only bestowed in return for some actual service rendered, or in<br/>
cases of evident and established distress, the present pernicious<br/>
habit of begging would soon die out, to the advantage both of<br/>
the people and of the visitors.<br/>
<br/>
It is with this conviction that we venture to express a hope<br/>
that tourists, when travelling in Egypt, will lend their aid to<br/>
this important reform by abstaining from the distribution of<br/>
money in response to mere demand for baksheesh, bestowing<br/>
it only when the circumstances appear to them to warrant their<br/>
generosity.<br/>
<br/>
Tourists should especially abstain from throwing money from<br/>
the decks of steamers on to the landing stages or on the banks<br/>
of the Nile for the purpose of witnessing the scramble for the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">coins-such </span>exhibitions are mischievous as well as degrading.<br/>
