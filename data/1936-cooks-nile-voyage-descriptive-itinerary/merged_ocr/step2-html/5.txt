after passing through the Barrage lock. This Barrage is designed<br/>
to hold up the river level during the spring and summer months<br/>
and ensure delivery of water into the great Ibrahimia Canal during<br/>
low Nile. The Canal is nearly 200 miles long and supplies<br/>
middle Egypt and the Fayum with water.<br/>
<br/>
The arrival of the steamer at Asyut produces great animation<br/>
on the river banks, and the group of merchants, displaying their<br/>
goods with an excited salesmanship <span style="color: #0000FF;">unwanted </span>in the Arab, form<br/>
one of the most vivid of Nile cameos. Asyut, capital of the<br/>
province of the same name, is one of the most important commercial and educational centres in Egypt. It is beautifully<br/>
situated, and a fine shady promenade, flanked by gardens and<br/>
villas, runs for some distance along the river bank. Its main<br/>
thoroughfares are wide and by way of being handsome, but Old<br/>
Asyut is thoroughly Egyptian, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">extensive</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">bazaars </span>and an<br/>
air of romantic mystery. At one time Asyut was much frequented<br/>
by caravans from the south, bringing slaves and various commodities for sale.<br/>
<br/>
Donkeys will be in readiness for half an hour's ride through<br/>
the town to the foot of a neighbouring mountain to visit the<br/>
tombs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hapzefai </span>and Kheti, two of the most interesting of the<br/>
tombs of ancient Asyut, dating back over four thousand years.<br/>
The tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hapzefai </span>is an extensive grotto, containing various<br/>
hieroglyphics and sculptures. An open entrance chamber leads<br/>
in to a main chamber, the ceiling of which is vaulted and<br/>
decorated with elegant devices. The view from the tomb, overlooking Asyut and the broad Nile Valley, enclosed by the<br/>
limestone hills of Libya, is one of great beauty. In the tomb of<br/>
Kheti are some striking representations of warriors armed with<br/>
spears and large shields, which are remarkable as being much<br/>
the same as those described by Xenophon in his account of the<br/>
Egyptian troops serving with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Croesus</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Asyut is noted for its high standard of education, and the<br/>
Principal of the American College extends a cordial invitation<br/>
to passengers to visit the boys' college (a few minutes' walk or<br/>
ride from the steamer) and the girls' school in the town.<br/>
