<br/>
Tenth Day (Friday) <span style="color: #0000FF;">.-Passing </span>through the gorge of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Silsila</span>, with<br/>
its vast quarries, <span style="color: #0000FF;">bearing </span>the cartouches (or seals) of Egyptian<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kings </span>for several thousand years back, the steamer arrives at<br/>
Komombo for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">visit </span>to the temple.<br/>
<br/>
This temple is duplex, and in that respect unique. It was<br/>
dedicated to two deities and it combined two temples side by<br/>
side within the same building. Many of the paintings are<br/>
particularly brilliant. One item of interest which should not<br/>
be missed amongst the mural decorations, is a representation of<br/>
surgical instruments in use at the time. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>a surprising <span style="color: #ff0000;">reV </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elation </span>that <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>of them can be recognized as almost identical<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the instruments used at the present day.<br/>
<br/>
As the steamer approaches Aswan the scenery undergoes a<br/>
complete change. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vegetation </span>ceases in places and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">desert<br/>
</span>often extends <span style="color: #0000FF;">down </span>to the river <span style="color: #0000FF;">ban </span>The sandstone cliffs <span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span>disappeared and huge granite <span style="color: #0000FF;">rue </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>abound. Situated at the<br/>
foot of the First Cataract, surrounded on all sides by the desert,<br/>
Aswan is equipped with excellent hotels and offers all that can<br/>
be desired by the traveller in search of health-giving pleasure.<br/>
Its climate is particularly equable and in and around the town<br/>
is an abundance of verdure, made possible by the waters of the<br/>
Aswan Dam.<br/>
<br/>
As a rule the steamer arrives at Aswan after lunch, and a<br/>
visit is made to the island of Elephantine, including the famous<br/>
Nilometer and the Museum.<br/>
<br/>
Eleventh Day (Saturday) .--<span style="color: #ff0000;">-- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">After </span>breakfast, a visit is made to<br/>
the granite quarries, where lies an unfinished obelisk of colossal<br/>
dimensions, still undetached from the living rock; and from<br/>
there passengers proceed downstream to view the great Aswan<br/>
Dam, the largest of its kind and one of the most impressive sights<br/>
in Egypt. It has 180 sluices, arranged at four different <span style="color: #0000FF;">leV </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">els</span>,<br/>
and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">places </span>it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>100 feet high. The afternoon is free,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">giving </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">opportunity </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">visit </span>the town, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>the bazaars are of<br/>
great interest. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the Cataract Hotel should not<br/>
be missed.<br/>
