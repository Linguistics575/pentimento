<span>Fifth Day (Sunday) .--The steamer leaves Asyut early in the<br/>
morning. Early risers will enjoy the delightful views over the<br/>
Nile Valley after sunrise. For a couple of hours the delicate<br/>
tints on the lofty sandstone cliffs, the broad fields of clover or<br/>
corn at their feet, the clusters of mud huts and palm trees that<br/>
form the native villages, and the broad bosom of the river itself,<br/>
make an irresistible appeal to the lover of colour, while the<br/>
first low rays of the sun strike the white sails of the native<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">gyassas </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>or the whitewashed wall of some villa on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river<br/>
</span>bank.<br/>
<br/>
This will be a pleasant day's cruising past scenes typical of<br/>
the entire life of Egypt. Picturesque sailing boats, laden with<br/>
the produce of the land, are met at every bend, and villages and<br/>
towns of considerable size add to the animation of the river<br/>
banks. The steamer passes Abu Tig, a Coptic town with a<br/>
picturesque harbour, Tahta, with a number of fine mosques,<br/>
Akhim, a centre of the weaving trade, Girga, with an ancient<br/>
convent, and Baliana, the starting point for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aby </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dos</span>. The visit<br/>
to this beautiful temple is postponed until the return journey,<br/>
as the ruins are so grand that they lose none of their charm<br/>
and novelty even after Karnak has been seen. The steamer<br/>
anchors for the night at Nag Hamadi.<br/>

</span>Sixth Day (Monday<span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>the steamer passes Hou, a large village at one of the sharpest<br/>
bends in the river. A white <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arab </span>tomb marks the burial place<br/>
of Sheikh Selim, who sat naked on the river bank for 53 years<br/>
and was believed to possess great <span style="color: #0000FF;">pow </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ers </span>in assisting navigation.<br/>
Every craft passing upstream gave him alms in return for his<br/>
goodwill, and though he died in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1891</span>, the custom still persists,<br/>
to the benefit of his descendants. A bag containing the offerings<br/>
of the crew is dropped into a small boat which comes alongside<br/>
the steamer for the purpose<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Continuing past more native villages and towns, including<br/>
Kena, noted for its dates and its porous drinking vessels, which<br/>
are transported in thousands to Cairo and Alexandria, the<br/>
steamer arrives at Dendera, for a visit to its beautiful temple.<br/>
This is one of the best preserved temples in the country. Built<br/>
in the first century <span style="color: #ff0000;">B</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'.</span>, it'is dedicated <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nathan </span>the Egyptian Venus, and is closely<br/>
associated with the beautiful Cleopatra. The<br/>
famous portraits of Cleopatra and her son<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cmsarion </span>are on the end wall of the exterior.<br/>
The famous Zodiac of Dendera, now in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bibliothequc </span>Nationale in Paris, was taken from<br/>
the shrine of Osiris on the temple roof<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
