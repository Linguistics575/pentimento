continues past ever-changing scenes of native life. Several<br/>
islands are passed and presently the mountains begin to recede<br/>
from the western bank while those on the eastern <span style="color: #0000FF;">bank </span>extend<br/>
to the edge of the river in the form of cliffs. On the eastern<br/>
bank is seen the Coptic convent of Deir Mar <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antonios</span>, which<br/>
is also the starting point for a caravan route to the Red Sea.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">province </span>Then come numerous villages scattered among palm<br/>
groves, and, on the eastern bank, the rocky slopes of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gebel-elTeyr</span>, or the "Bird Mountain," rising sheer from the water<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>

Bird Mountain once a year, and, when departing, leave one<br/>
solitary bird on guard until the following year. Upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Third Day (Friday) <span style="color: #0000FF;">.-The </span>steamer arrives in the morning at<br/>

first through pleasant fields, then along the edge of the desert,<br/>
which stretches away in tawny solitude into the far distance.<br/>
