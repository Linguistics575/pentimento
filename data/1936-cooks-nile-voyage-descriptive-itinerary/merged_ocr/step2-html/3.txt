leaves Cook's landing stage above the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge. The<br/>
view of Cairo from the steamer is delightful. Stately palaces on<br/>
either bank, countless minarets of mosques, the noble <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mokkattam<br/>
</span>Hills and the Citadel at the foot form a fitting introduction to<br/>
the beauties of the Nile, whilst the <span style="color: #0000FF;">three </span>great pyramids of<br/>
Giza rise in stately dignity over the western plain.<br/>
<br/>
Gardens and waterside palaces slip <span style="color: #0000FF;">by</span>; belts of palm trees<br/>
quiver in the sun; on either hand the horizon stretches in a<br/>
serried line of orange-tinted mountains. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turn </span>Quarries,<br/>
where the stone for the Pyramids was hewn, and Helwan,<br/>
famous for its sulphur baths, are passed, and soon after lunch<br/>
the steamer arrives at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrechen</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Here cars will be in readiness for the drive to the site of<br/>
ancient Memphis, one of the most famous capitals of antiquity.<br/>
Striking evidence of its former glories is seen in its beautiful<br/>
alabaster Sphinx,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'26 </span>feet long and <span style="color: #0000FF;">H </span>feet high, and two colossal<br/>
statues of Rameses <span style="color: #ff0000;">ll </span>("Rameses the Great ").<br/>
<br/>
A visit is also made to the vast Necropolis, comprising relics<br/>
of almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">every </span>era of Egyptian history. The Step Pyramid of<br/>
Sakkara rises in lonely magnificence, 200 feet high. It was the<br/>
tomb of King Zozer, who flourished nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">5,000 </span>years ago.<br/>
You see also the Serapeum, with its subterranean tombs of the<br/>
Sacred Bulls, and the tombs of Ti and Ptah-Hetep (wealthy<br/>
citizens of ancient Memphis). revealing in their mural decorations<br/>
realistic representations of life in Egypt over 5,000 years ago.<br/>
Of great interest also are some proto-Doric columns discovered<br/>
a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">years </span>ago.<br/>
