Fl RST CATARACT VOYAGE

Twelfth Day (Sunday) .-The steamer leaves Aswan at dawn for
the return voyage, during which passen, gers will enjoy opportunities for revisiting the chief places of interest seen on the
upward voyage. On this day stops are made for visits to the
temples at Komombo and Edfu. The steamer anchors for the
night at Isna.

Thirteenth Day (Monday) .-After a visit to the Temple of Isna,
the voyage is continued m the early
afternoon, and the great Temples of Karnak and Luxor arc
revisited.

Fourteenth Day (Tuesday) .-In the morning the Tombs of the
Kings are revisited. The afternoon is left free and passengers
will find plenty to interest and entertain them in Luxor itself.
Fifty years ago Luxor was a mere cluster of poorly built mud
houses, and it was due largely to the enterprise and energy of
Mr. John Cook, son of Mr. Thomas Cook, that it has grown into
the present clean and attractive town.

Fifteenth Day (Wednesday) .--The steamer leaves Luxor at
dawn and Dendera is reached during the morning. The Temple
of Hathor is revisited. Continuing northwards, the steamer
anchors for the night at Baliana, in readiness for a visit to the
magnificent ruins at Abydos on the following day.

Sixteenth Day (Thursday) .--Passengers are conveyed by donkeys
to Abydos, which was one of the most renowned cities of Ancient
Egypt. Here is the wonderful Temple of Seti I--the apotheosis
of ancient Egyptian art. It differs from all other temples in
having seven sanctuaries instead of one, whilst the workmanship
of the inscriptions and reliefs is incomparable. Its famous
"Tablet of Abydos" -a list of seventy-six kings of Egypt,
beginning with Mena, the first King of Egypt-is the most
wonderful genealogical record in the world.

A visit will also be made to the cenotaph of Seti I, considered
by some authorities to be the tomb of Osiris. Its simple majesty
forms a fitting complement to the temple of the great King.

Passengers return for luncheon to the steamer, which then
proceeds to Abu Tig.

Seventeenth Day (Friday) .-Asyut is reached during the morning
and after a short stay, the steamer will pass through the lock and
continue northwards, anchoring at Tel-el-Amare for a visit
ashore on the following day.

Eighteenth Day (Saturday) .--Extensive ruins and rock tombs at
Tel-el-Amarna mark the time when it was a royal city. Founded
by Amenhophis IV when he became a convert to the exclusive
worship of the sun and withdrew from Thebes, it was richly
endowed with temples and palaces. But it was the royal abode
for only thirty years and was never again occupied. The ancient
streets and ground plans may easily be traced, and recent work
by the Egyptian Exploration Society enhances their interest.

The steamer leaves during the morning and Beni Ha'an is

reached after luncheon, giving an opportunity to re-visit the
Rock Tombs.

Nineteenth Day (Sunday) .--The voyage is continued past Minia,
Gebel-el-Teyr (the "Bird Mountain ") and Beni Suef.

Twentieth Day (Monday) .-Passing Wasta in the early morning,
the steamer normally reaches Cairo in the afternoon. Passengers
may remain on board the steamer until after breakfast on Tuesday
morning, if they wish to do so.
