Fourth Day (Tuesday) .
Leaving Abu Simbel early, the
"Thebes' continues southwards through scenery which
changes constantly. The beautiful foliage of the palm tree is no
longer seen, the verdure of the ri1 er banks has shrunk to a narrow
strip and the river flows through the desert, with sands glistening
like gold. Presently the palms of Wadi Haifa are seen in the
blue distance, standing out like a refreshing oasis.

Wadi Halfa, the first British post in the Sudan, is a well
organized community, whose courteous British residents extend
to the Ir Thebes tt tors the facilities of their Sports Club,
with billiards, 21 library, newspapers, tennis courts, and a ninehole golf course. There is, moreover, an historic town, with
several interesting relics of the campaign against the Mahdi,
including the house in which Osman Digna was for some time
a prisoner.

Wadi llalta IS the northern terminus of the desert railway to
Khartoum, m er which splendid! y equipped trains de hue are
operated and connect with the" Thebes." The Governor of
Halfa has done much to add to the pleasure of visitors, notably
by arranging a camp in a delightful spot amidst the desert hills
The charges are moderate and a night spent under such novel
conditions is a memorable experience.

During the afternoon a visit is paid to the various places of
interest in w adi Haifa 25
