A COOK'S DRAGOMAN SHOWING VISITORS ROUND ONE OF THE
NILE TEMPLES.



- FIRST CATARACT VOYAGE

Fourth Day (Saturday) .---. )" is reached during the morning,
after passing through the Barrage lock. This Barrage is designed
to hold up the river level during the spring and summer months
and ensure delivery of water into the great Ibrahimia Canal during
low Nile. The Canal is nearly 200 miles long and supplies
middle Egypt and the Fayum with water.

The arrival of the steamer at Asyut produces great animation
on the river banks, and the group of merchants, displaying their
goods with an excited salesmanship unwanted in the Arab, form
one of the most vivid of Nile cameos. Asyut, capital of the
province of the same name, is one of the most important commercial and educational centres in Egypt. It is beautifully
situated, and a fine shady promenade, flanked by gardens and
villas, runs for some distance along the river bank. Its main
thoroughfares are wide and by way of being handsome, but Old
Asyut is thoroughly Egyptian, with extensive.bazaars and an
air of romantic mystery. At one time Asyut was much frequented
by caravans from the south, bringing slaves and various commodities for sale.

Donkeys will be in readiness for half an hour's ride through
the town to the foot of a neighbouring mountain to visit the
tombs of Hapzefai and Kheti, two of the most interesting of the
tombs of ancient Asyut, dating back over four thousand years.
The tomb of Hapzefai is an extensive grotto, containing various
hieroglyphics and sculptures. An open entrance chamber leads
in to a main chamber, the ceiling of which is vaulted and
decorated with elegant devices. The view from the tomb, overlooking Asyut and the broad Nile Valley, enclosed by the
limestone hills of Libya, is one of great beauty. In the tomb of
Kheti are some striking representations of warriors armed with
spears and large shields, which are remarkable as being much
the same as those described by Xenophon in his account of the
Egyptian troops serving with Crasus.

Asyut is noted for its high standard of education, and the
Principal of the American College extends a cordial invitation
to passengers to visit the boys' college (a few minutes' walk or
ride from the steamer) and the girls' school in the town.
