in the surrounding earth, and consequent odour,
have been removed, and replaced by sis-incl, iron
pipes, which are a great improvement. All cess-
pools are now prevented from draining into the
Nile 0r canals, and are obliged to be emptied at

Abbassiyeh desert by night, at the rate of over 30,000
tons a (year. There it is deodo1ized and sifted, and
sold to the fellaheen as "poudrette" at Â£2 a ton
for use on their lands. These changes, though not
nearly radical enough, have already contributed
