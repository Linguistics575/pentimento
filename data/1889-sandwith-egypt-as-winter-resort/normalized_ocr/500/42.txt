26 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Table I. is a resum√© svhich I have made from the
records of the five years 1884--88, the monthly
bulletins being printed by the Khedivial Observa-
tory in the Abbassiyeh suburb of Cairo.

The observations are taken throughout the day
and night-at 6 a.m., o a.m, noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m.,
9 11131., and midnight. The barometer used is a
Fortin, verified and compared at Montsouris Ob-
servatory in Paris. The readings are reduced to
freezing-point, and are taken at a level of 1082
feet above the sea. My table shows that the
variations are not very great, and its practical
value is very little, though, as it falls when the
wind changes to the south, and rises again when
the prevailing north wind blows, it is useful to
check the probable duration of a khamseen. The
greatest variation during 1888 was 30'2 inches on
one day in March, and 29U in. once in February.
The temperatures are taken by a Centigrade ther-
mometer, verified every year, and placed on a
balcony thirty-two feet from the ground, facing
north, and sheltered from the sun. Th/e extremes
of temperature are read daily from self-registering
maximum and minimum instruments. The mini-
mum result is generally found about 6 am. or a
little earlier, and the daily maximum is invariably
about 2 13.111. or 3 13.111.

During 1888, the absolute maximum reached
