undergone concentration by evaporation, besides
having washed the lower strata, from which it
extracts chlorine.

As a eonfirnrcdion of this, we see that the
chlorine is at its maximum just before the annual
flood.

The defieieney of nitrates is interesting, but does
not necessarily show an absence of defilement. The
softness of the water makes it very agreeable for
all domestic purposes; the slight variation in hard-
ness is due to carbonate of lime, through which
the river has cut its way. The analyses of 1888-0
showed a trace of iron, but of no poisonous metals,
and no nitrites, and Heiseh's sewage test never
gave the slightest evidence of sewage contamina-
tion.

The 11nfilizwed water should never be drunk by
visitors or residents, though the natives prefer it
infinitely. Some imprudent tourists drink it from
the dirty porous jars of the villagers, and must not
wonder at suffering occasionally in consequence.

The suspended matter, which is the chief ferti-
lizing ingredient of the Nile, varies in quantity in
the most wonderful way. Mr. Pollard's figures
vary from'9 in July, to 16P8 in September,
while Dr. Letheby found 3" 3 in May, 1875, and
10.P4 grains in August, 1874. The fertility of the
flood, besides the clay, is due to the organic matter,
