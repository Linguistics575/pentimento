Festivals ...---- )" are several old Egyptian and
Coptic holidays which have the advantage of being
on fised dates, and can therefore be easily seen by
reference to guide-books. But the purely Mussul-
man functions take place according to the Moham-
medan calendar, the year of which is 1131; days
less than our own. The following dates are an
approximate guess at the principal feasts; but it
must be remembered that the actual date is often
changed either as a matter of convenience, or
to cause the chief holiday to fall upon the eve of
Friday--
