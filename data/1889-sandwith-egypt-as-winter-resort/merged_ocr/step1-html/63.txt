<span>Cairo. 47<br/>
<br/>
Dengue fever was present in 1880 and 1887, but<br/>
only from August to November: it is a painful<br/>
malady, without danger to life. Typhus and<br/>
relapsing fevers occur in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">spring </span>among overcrowded natives, but no case has been known<br/>
among Europeans. The plague left Egypt, we<br/>
hope for ever, in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1844</span>. Small-pos, as in other<br/>
parts of the world, is liable to occur among<br/>
those <span style="color: #0000FF;">insufficiently </span>protected by vaccination, but<br/>
I remember only one case of a visitor and one<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>resident. The deaths from small-pos in Cairo<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">1886-7-8</span>, have averaged forty. Measles <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>occurs as an epidemic among the natives,<br/>
and causes many deaths; but I know of no visitors<br/>
who have caught the disease, and only a dozen<br/>
residents. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rotheln </span>I have not yet heard of in<br/>
Egypt. Scarlatina is so rare that it is only heard<br/>
of at very rare intervals among the British troops.<br/>
Diphtheria is not uncommon among native children,<br/>
and every now and then attacks Europeans <span style="color: #0000FF;">who<br/>
</span>live in insanitary houses. Whooping-cough is<br/>
almost unknown, mumps very rare, and the ordinary influenza <span style="color: #0000FF;">catarrh </span>of England is uncommon.<br/>
Congestion of the liver is more likely to attack<br/>
alcoholic residents than visitors, and both classes<br/>
are liable to pleurisy or pneumonia, if they persist<br/>
in imprudent exposure at night. Phthisis does not<br/>
occur among white residents, though, on the other<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
