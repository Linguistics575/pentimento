of patients who have hitherto been prevented from coming.<br/>
Out of 45 cases that I have seen with unmistakable phthisis,<br/>
69 per cent. improved, 20 per cent. remained stationary, and<br/>
only 11 per cent. grew worse (including three deaths in<br/>
Egypt).<br/>
<br/>
My figures are, therefore, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfirmatory </span>of the results<br/>
previously obtained by Dr. Williams. The three deaths<br/>
which occurred in Egypt were cases in the last stage of<br/>
phthisis, which died soon after arrival, and of course ought<br/>
not to have been sent abroad. I can only <span style="color: #0000FF;">repeat-what<br/>
</span>every one knows already-that threatened cases of phthisis,<br/>
with or without a bad family history, can apparently be<br/>
prevented from developing in a pure, dry, <span style="color: #0000FF;">warm </span>climate;<br/>
that incipient cases can be improved and perhaps cured; that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chronic </span>cases can remain stationary, so that their lives are<br/>
definitely prolonged; but that advanced cases with disease<br/>
in both lungs and a temperature every night above the<br/>
normal cannot be cured by a change of climate, though<br/>
their disease may, under fortunate circumstances, be arrested,<br/>
and their days <span style="color: #0000FF;">consequently </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">may </span>be enlivened and prolonged.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the most satisfactory case to send abroad is the<br/>
overgrown boy or girl with winter cough, <span style="color: #0000FF;">insufficient </span>expansion of chest, and general <span style="color: #ff0000;">lassitnde</span>. Such patients require<br/>
little or no medical treatment, gain weight and breadth of<br/>
body and mind, and return to their work at home with<br/>
healthy vigour. Next, if any cases of phthisis are to be<br/>
sent abroad, they must be either those which, though<br/>
anatomically advanced, are chronic or quiescent, or those in<br/>
the earliest possible stage.<br/>
<br/>
Now, in the case of these latter, the patients and their<br/>
friends are least likely to think of the scheme, or even to<br/>
suspect the disease. It therefore rests <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the medical<br/>
attendant, where he thinks fit, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">order </span>for his patient a<br/>
continuance <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>some months of an equable warm climate,<br/>
such as is provided by a summer in England, a winter <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>Egypt, and a second summer in England. When a patient<br/>
