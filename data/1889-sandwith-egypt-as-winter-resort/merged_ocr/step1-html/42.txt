<span>26 Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Winter </span>Resort.<br/>
<br/>
Table I. is a resum√© <span style="color: #ff0000;">svhich </span>I have made from the<br/>
records of the five years <span style="color: #0000FF;">1884-88</span>, the monthly<br/>
bulletins being printed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedivial </span>Observatory in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh </span>suburb of Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The observations are taken throughout the day<br/>
and night-at 6 a.m., <span style="color: #0000FF;">9 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span>, noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m.,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">9 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">11131.</span>, and midnight. The barometer used is a<br/>
Fortin, verified and compared <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Montsouris <span style="color: #0000FF;">Observatory </span>in Paris. The readings are reduced to<br/>
freezing-point, and are taken <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>a level of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1082<br/>
</span>feet above the sea. My table shows that the<br/>
variations are not very great, and its practical<br/>
value is very little, though, as it falls when the<br/>
wind changes to the south, and rises again when<br/>
the prevailing north wind blows, it is useful to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">check </span>the probable duration of a khamseen. The<br/>
greatest variation during 1888 was <span style="color: #0000FF;">30'2 </span>inches on<br/>
one day in March, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">29U </span>in. once in February.<br/>
The temperatures are taken by a Centigrade thermometer, verified every year, and placed on a<br/>
balcony <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty-two </span>feet from the ground, facing<br/>
north, and sheltered from the sun. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>extremes<br/>
of temperature are read daily from self-registering<br/>
maximum and minimum instruments. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">minimum </span>result is generally found about 6 <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>or a<br/>
little earlier, and the daily maximum is invariably<br/>
about 2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">13.111. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>3 <span style="color: #ff0000;">13.111</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>During 1888, the absolute maximum reached<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
