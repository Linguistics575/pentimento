<span>70 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
Visitors interested in Oriental education <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>like<br/>
to see the Polytechnic School, that of the Arts and<br/>
Sciences, a charity for the deaf, dumb, and blind, and<br/>
the useful work started by the late Miss <span style="color: #0000FF;">Whately</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The ordinary visitor demands at once to be<br/>
taken to see the howling and dancing dervishes,<br/>
and there are many other more interesting sects<br/>
whose monasteries he may visit if he will. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Perhaps<br/>
</span>one may be forgiven for reminding him that their<br/>
fantastic worship plays to the Mussulman religion<br/>
a part something analogous to the Salvation Army<br/>
section of the Protestant Church.<br/>
<br/>
But whether the traveller comes for days, weeks,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span>' months, let us impress upon him the absolute<br/>
duty of visiting <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boulak </span>Museum, and of not neglecting his chance of seeing monuments as old as<br/>
the Pyramids, wooden statues of much the same<br/>
date, a unique assembly of royal mummies and<br/>
portraits painted years before the Old Masters.<br/>
The great objection to the museum is that most of<br/>
the objects are not labelled, and that the catalogue<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">atrociously </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bad</span>. We may see there the jewellery<br/>
worn by an Egyptian queen three thousand six<br/>
hundred years ago, a trilingual inscription not<br/>
unlike the "Rosetta stone," and tables of kings<br/>
like the famous slab from Abydos. The museum<br/>
is better than any in Europe, and is rich especially<br/>
in monuments of the earliest Dynasties.<br/>
