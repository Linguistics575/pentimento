of the river. The annual regularity of the rise<br/>
and fall of temperature, of the barometer and of<br/>
humidity, of the wind, of sunshine, and of the Nile<br/>
flood are elements <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>materially combine to<br/>
ensure the comfort of the invalid visitor. It is<br/>
easy for any intelligent resident to be "weather<br/>
wise," and to prophesy for his friends the condition<br/>
of the immediate future.<br/>
<br/>
During 1887 there were showers of rain on fifteen<br/>
days. Thunder and lightning occur about once <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>year, and hail is rather less common, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>snow<br/>
is unknown. The May rainfall in my table is<br/>
exceptionally high in consequence of an abnormal<br/>
storm in 1887.<br/>
<br/>
The state of the sky is judged by figures running<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">O </span>to 10, and shows an excellent average. The<br/>
clouds are brought up from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea </span>by the north<br/>
wind, or the sky becomes overcast <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>a south<br/>
wind from the infinitesimal particles of sand which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">seem </span>to be held in suspension in the air.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Wird-The </span>prevailing wind both in Cairo and<br/>
Alexandria is always from the north, though it<br/>
may be noticed that a cool dry wind blows from<br/>
the desert during J <span style="color: #ff0000;">anuary</span>. Also one sees <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>the<br/>
force of the wind, which is calculated by means of<br/>
an anemometer, and shows the number of miles<br/>
per hour, is abated during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">winter </span>months, and<br/>
only becomes freshened when the summer has set<br/>
