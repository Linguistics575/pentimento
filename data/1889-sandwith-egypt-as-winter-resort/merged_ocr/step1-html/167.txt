aches are seldom met with except when Cairo is less dry<br/>
than usual<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The sulphur baths at Helouan are, of course, a<br/>
useful help to the dry climate.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rheumatoid </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">arthritis </span>I have only once seen in an Egyptian;<br/>
but every winter there are numbers of Europeans who come<br/>
to Cairo to get rid of their pain, <span style="color: #ff0000;">stiffness</span>, and swelling,<br/>
and to try and postpone their next acute attack. All<br/>
those that I have met with have greatly improved, and<br/>
among them is the case of a lady who for this disease had<br/>
had a previous <span style="color: #0000FF;">experience </span>of Buxton, Bath, San Remo,<br/>
Cannes, Algiers, Pau, Biarritz, Wiesbaden, and Spain. She<br/>
has now been for three years running to Cairo, and believes<br/>
that the climate is the best she has yet tried<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>She has had<br/>
rheumatic attacks for fifteen years, and for nearly all that<br/>
time has had her joints <span style="color: #0000FF;">anchylosed </span>and swollen, so that the<br/>
only ones which remained free were the hips, toes, and<br/>
vertebrae.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the second winter in Cairo, she could stand<br/>
and walk alone and almost upright, and was delighted with<br/>
her <span style="color: #0000FF;">own </span>activity. She took no drugs, had no sulphur baths,<br/>
and no massage during that winter, and only consulted her<br/>
doctor upon one day.<br/>
<br/>
She has a distinct family predisposition towards <span style="color: #0000FF;">rheumatism</span>; her father was <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>gouty, mother rheumatic<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>mother's father very gouty, and all maternal relatives are<br/>
rheumatic. She has lost a sister of rheumatic fever, and<br/>
has living a brother who has heart-disease and has had<br/>
rheumatic fever three times, and a sister who has chronic<br/>
rheumatism <span style="color: #0000FF;">after </span>an acute attack<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>Another case <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>lady with a strong <span style="color: #0000FF;">family<br/>
</span>history of rheumatism, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">personal </span>history of <span style="color: #0000FF;">four </span>years<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>She had <span style="color: #0000FF;">previously </span>tried Buxton, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strathpeffer</span>, Wildbad,<br/>
sulphur baths, and massage, with a little temporary improvement after each. When she reached Cairo she could walk<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">stiflly</span>, but for three years had <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>unable to run, dance,<br/>
play <span style="color: #ff0000;">lawn-tcnnis</span>, or walk downstairs. Two months later she<br/>
