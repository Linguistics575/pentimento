<span style="color: #ff0000;">Siyltt-seeiny.-0lose </span>to the village of Luxor and<br/>
its hotels are the two Luxor Temples, and a<br/>
pleasant walk along the Avenue of Sphinxes takes<br/>
us to the well-known wonders of Karnak. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
opposite side of the Nile are the Temples of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span>I. and IL, the Rameseum, the Colossi of the<br/>
Eighteenth Dynasty, the Temples of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thothmes </span>HL, beautifully preserved sculptures,<br/>
the Tombs of the Kings and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">humbler </span>folk, of<br/>
the Queens, and lastly of hundreds of early Christians. All these remains, and many more of<br/>
Thebes and its necropolis, contrive to make sunny<br/>
Luxor a <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>delightful and interesting winter<br/>
retreat.<br/>
<br/>
A society, with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">head-quarters </span>in London, has<br/>
just been started for the preservation of ancient<br/>
monuments in Egypt. An estimate of the cost of<br/>
the most necessary work, such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">clearing </span>away<br/>
rubbish, strengthening pillars, <span style="color: #0000FF;">draining </span>off water,<br/>
etc., shows that £2055 is wanted for Luxor, £3140<br/>
for Karnak, and £3400 for Thebes, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>, and Edfu.<br/>
It is to be hoped that money will soon be forthcoming to preserve all temples from the depredation of time, thieves, and tourists.<br/>
