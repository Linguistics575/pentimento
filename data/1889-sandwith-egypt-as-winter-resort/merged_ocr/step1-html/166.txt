discovered. She gets slight asthma in Alexandria, and is<br/>
relieved directly she reaches Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
Of the two cases in which there was no improvement, one<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>an English <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofr1eer </span>who suffered at all times and in all<br/>
places except when he was on the sea. At Suakin and<br/>
Alexandria he was comfortable, but in Cairo <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>was liable to<br/>
be laid up once a fortnight, and then had to go a short<br/>
yachting cruise to get quite rid of his asthma. The second<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">case </span>was a very inveterate one, for the lady had been troubled<br/>
with asthma and occasional bronchitis for more than twenty<br/>
years. At Cairo and Luxor she still had asthma every<br/>
morning, but in a modified degree. She believed that she<br/>
obtained no good from a dry climate, and like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">officer</span>,<br/>
she pined for the sea air, and stated that in England,<br/>
Brighton was the place where she had least asthma.<br/>
<br/>
It is not <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to understand that <span style="color: #0000FF;">asthmatic </span>patients<br/>
who have immunity from their attacks in damp sea air, may<br/>
obtain no relief from dry desert air, and the converse is also<br/>
apparently true.<br/>
<br/>
To secure the maximum benefit from the climate of Egypt<br/>
it seems to be necessary for asthmatic people to keep in the<br/>
same temperature as much as possible, and therefore to avoid<br/>
night air. One patient, who had had chronic bronchitis and<br/>
asthma for two years, obtained great good from six months<br/>
spent in Egypt, and though in the succeeding year and a<br/>
half she has had pleurisy, she has had no more bronchitis or<br/>
asthma.<br/>
<br/>
Rheumatism in an acute form is practically unknown<br/>
among the natives and Europeans in Egypt, but I have seen<br/>
two cases among young English patients. One caught cold <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
</span>Suez, and had in Cairo her second attack of rheumatic fever;<br/>
the other patient had also had a previous attack, and consequent heart-disease, and caught a chill in Cairo during<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">winter</span>. The climate is excellent for all forms of chronic<br/>
rheumatism, and for patients convalescing from acute<br/>
rheumatism contracted elsewhere. Rheumatic pains and<br/>
