which is kept by one of Messrs. Cook's agents. It<br/>
was opened at the end of 1877, and, though it has<br/>
been constantly enlarged, it is always full <span style="color: #0000FF;">during<br/>
</span>the season, and rooms must therefore be engaged<br/>
in advance. There is accommodation for about<br/>
a hundred visitors, and at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kama </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>Hotel for<br/>
about half that number. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Unti11888 </span>most of the<br/>
Luxor Hotel rooms were built in a single line from<br/>
north to south, so as to receive full benefit of<br/>
morning and afternoon sun, and the rooms were<br/>
on two floors, the ground <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>being raised four<br/>
steps above the ground. The walls are purposely<br/>
built of rough bricks of great thickness, so that<br/>
they can be kept cool on hot days, and will retain<br/>
their heat during winter nights. But I found that<br/>
invalids had to go into the open air to get from<br/>
their bedroom or sitting-room to the table <span style="color: #0000FF;">rl'luhe</span>,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ever-willing </span>proprietor only required to<br/>
have this disadvantage pointed out to him, to construct <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large dining-room, two <span style="color: #0000FF;">drawing-rooms</span>, and<br/>
over these bedrooms <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>central passage, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>allow delicate <span style="color: #ff0000;">visitors </span>to ascend without meeting<br/>
the night air. Healthy visitors find <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>inconvenience from occupying the older rooms. Electric<br/>
bells have been set up, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">earth-closets </span>with good<br/>
