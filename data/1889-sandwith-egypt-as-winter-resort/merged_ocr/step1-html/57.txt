<span style="color: #0000FF;">Jfay.</span>--We are still liable to occasional <span style="color: #0000FF;">khamseen </span>winds, and each week the weather is becoming<br/>
warmer; but Cairo is now <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lovely</span>; the trees in<br/>
the streets have their new foliage, and the gardens<br/>
are bright with many subtropical <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowering </span>trees<br/>
and shrubs. On May <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>I once saw the exceptional<br/>
event of a thunder and lightning storm, with hailstones as big as dried peas, and a shade temperature of 85° Fahr. Quail leave Egypt for Europe.<br/>

the rising Nile. Rich natives spend these months<br/>
in Alexandria, Syria, 01' Constantinople. Europeans in Cairo take a siesta after luncheon.<br/>
Government <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofliees </span>are closed at <span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p.111.</span>, but after<br/>

golf, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">lawn-dennis</span>, and the British soldier plays<br/>
cricket <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>football. The nights are always cool,<br/>
