dependent again on donkeys for a long <span style="color: #0000FF;">de'tour </span>by<br/>
the banks of winding canals, till at last they<br/>
reached the desert, hastily visited the Pyramids,<br/>
and then had to return at once to reach Cairo<br/>
before sunset. Those who desired to devote a<br/>
longer time to the sights took out with them<br/>
tents, a cook, food, and a guard of Bedouins.<br/>
<br/>
Now matters are all changed; the tourist drives<br/>
from his hotel to the Great Pyramid in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little<br/>

including a house, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>he and his wife lived<br/>
very comfortably. He believed that the air was<br/>
more beneficial to him than that of the other <span style="color: #ff0000;">healthresorts </span>he had tried, and though he had had a<br/>
