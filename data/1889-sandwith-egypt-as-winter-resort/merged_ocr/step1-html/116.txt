fifty feet deep, and is conducted through <span style="color: #ff0000;">filieringtanks </span>to the hotel. An English medical man is<br/>
resident during the season, and his colleagues in<br/>
Cairo can also be summoned by telephone or<br/>
donkey-messenger. Among other things provided<br/>
for the comfort of English visitors are a <span style="color: #ff0000;">steamlaundry</span>, smoking-rooms, magazines and <span style="color: #0000FF;">newspapers</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">stabling </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty-two </span>horses. For<br/>
amusements there are an archery ground and<br/>
lawn-tennis court, golf-links, and the makings of<br/>
a polo and cricket ground. There are ponies,<br/>
camels, and donkeys to ride, traps to hire, and<br/>
good quail and <span style="color: #ff0000;">duek-shoolingr</span>. A four-in-hand<br/>
coach is to drive daily from Cairo during the<br/>
season, November to April. Price <span style="color: #0000FF;">123. </span>to 14s. a<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">During </span>the last two winters I have sent many<br/>
patients to stay at this hotel, and have been much<br/>
pleased with their progress. It is also very useful<br/>
for those in Cairo who wish to drive out for luncheon<br/>
or afternoon tea in the winter, or for dinner upon<br/>
moonlit nights in the warmer weather. The air<br/>
is so pure and dry that it cannot be praised too<br/>
highly, but it must be remembered that of the<br/>
three desert spots recommended near Cairo, none<br/>
are so warm as Luxor; but, on the other hand,<br/>
they are invaluable to those who do not want the<br/>
fatigue and expense of a voyage up the Nile. <span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>The<br/>
