CHAPTER <span style="color: #ff0000;">T.<br/>
</span>EXCURSIONS FROM CAIRO.<br/>
<br/>
I HAVE already said that the favourite ride <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>drive<br/>
is in the direction of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh</span>, where on Fridays<br/>
and Sundays there is always a crush of carriages;<br/>
but those who love peace will be happier on the<br/>
roads leading to the Pyramids, or Heliopolis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoohra</span>, all soft, good roads, well shaded by the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">syeamore-fig </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span>other trees.<br/>
<br/>
Desert.--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>visitors who can ride <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>great <span style="color: #0000FF;">treat<br/>
</span>is in store. The desert can be reached on all sides<br/>
most easily, and supplies a capital galloping<br/>
ground and invigorating air <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>seems to put<br/>
fresh life into both horse and rider. The popular<br/>
idea in England is <span style="color: #ff0000;">that </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>desert is always one<br/>
vast plain of dazzling sand <span style="color: #0000FF;">without </span>undulations<br/>
and without signs of life, and that at every step<br/>
the luckless traveller must sink ankle-deep in<br/>
tiring sand. The reality is a series of hills and<br/>
valleys with innumerable changes of colour, and<br/>
of lights and shades, and a crisp, firm ground upon<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
