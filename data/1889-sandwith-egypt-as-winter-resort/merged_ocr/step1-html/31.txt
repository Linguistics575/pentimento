boon of fresh <span style="color: #0000FF;">water </span>in great quantities after 1876<br/>
proved <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>curse by causing small swamps of water,<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">percolated </span>through the desert sand from the<br/>
new canals. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-tanks </span>in the gardens<br/>

SUEZ.<br/>
<br/>
Suez is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>town of 11,000 people, rather<br/>
more English than either Port Said 01' Ismailia,<br/>
and is of <span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span>the port of entry from India,<br/>
Australia, and the far East. There is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>comfortable hotel, an English doctor, and a railway line<br/>
to Ismailia and Cairo, and a fresh-water canal<br/>
supplying it from the Nile. Excursions may be<br/>
made to the oasis called Moses' Well, to Ataka<br/>
mountain, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-coast </span>to collect shells, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>Suakin.<br/>
<br/>
Suez is in the same latitude as Cairo, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ataka </span>range stretches across the desert to join<br/>
Mokattam there.<br/>
