sphere where they are not perpetually reminded<br/>
of their sensitiveness to cold and <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">taking </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eold</span>."<br/>
This last group includes those <span style="color: #0000FF;">invalided </span>home from<br/>
India for malaria and other causes.<br/>
<br/>
Cases of all these ailments have passed satisfactorily under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">wriier</span>'s observation during the<br/>
last six winters.<br/>
<br/>
But the most important question to try and<br/>
solve is what kind of patients ought not to be sent<br/>

will undoubtedly take his disease with him.<br/>
<br/>
Again, patients with dropsy and all the troublesome sequelae of heart-disease are surely unwise<br/>

going to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>certain spot, and it seems cruel to prevent their carrying out the wish of their heart;<br/>
but even then it is almost necessary that they<br/>
should be accompanied by a trained nurse. A<br/>
hot climate is perhaps too exciting for men with<br/>
