<span>34 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">venieneed </span>by not being able to pursue their ordinary outdoor life, and those whose work does not<br/>
permit of their resting feel fagged and tired before<br/>
the close of the day. The effect on natives would<br/>
seem to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">something </span>similar, the street-occupants<br/>
lying about in all positions on the paths, instead<br/>
of sitting and chattering as on other days. Fever<br/>
patients in bed do not seem to be conscious of the<br/>
change to khamseen weather. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bronchitic </span>and<br/>
phthisical individuals are rather benefited than<br/>
otherwise by the dry, warm air; but it is doubtful<br/>
whether the air would not be too stimulating for<br/>
those with a tendency to <span style="color: #ff0000;">hsemoptysis</span>.<br/>
<br/>
My only experience 011 this point is derived from<br/>
one young Englishwoman, whose expectoration in<br/>
March became a little bloody. She liked the<br/>
khamseen days; but I thought it prudent to send<br/>
her to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramleh</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>because she had a very bad<br/>
family history of haemoptysis. A bad khamseen,<br/>
besides its effects on the human race, shrivels up<br/>
roses and other flowers, and will even warp and<br/>
crack <span style="color: #0000FF;">unseasoned </span>wood. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">curious </span>that the<br/>
same southerly wind, so hot in March and April,<br/>
is occasionally in winter the coldest that blows,<br/>
the difference being that then the sun's rays<br/>
fall more <span style="color: #0000FF;">obliquely </span>on the desert, and the wind<br/>
is chilled by its passage over the mountains of<br/>
Abyssinia.<br/>
