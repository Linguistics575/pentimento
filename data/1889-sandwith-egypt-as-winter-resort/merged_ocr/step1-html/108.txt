<br/>
the whole time, he should invariably report progress<br/>
to his doctor <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the third week of the cure, as<br/>
a tonic is then often necessary, and he may be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unconsciously </span>overdoing the treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Delicate people should begin with a temperature<br/>
not above <span style="color: #ff0000;">98Â°</span>, should take a bath on alternate days,<br/>
and not for more than ten minutes at a time.<br/>
<br/>
It is hardly necessary to remind patients whose<br/>
hearts are affected that they should have medical<br/>
advice upon the desirability of hot bathing. The<br/>
Helouan waters, as I have already said, are<br/>
stronger than those of Aix-les-Bains, but they have<br/>
not yet the advantage of being accompanied by all<br/>
the excellent system of <span style="color: #0000FF;">douches </span>and local massage<br/>
for which the Savoy resort is so famous.<br/>

Invalids are often chary of transporting themselves and their relatives from the gaieties of Cairo<br/>
to the solitude of Helouan, and to them it can<br/>
only be said that, if their physical strength permits, they are easily able to live in Cairo, and to<br/>
go four or five days a week to Helouan to <span style="color: #0000FF;">take<br/>
</span>their baths. But though some men and a few<br/>
women prefer to do this, there can be no doubt that<br/>
the purer air, earlier hours, and complete repose<br/>
of the desert life are most useful adjuncts to the<br/>
sulphur baths-and such invalids occasionally need<br/>
reminding <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>they have come abroad for their<br/>
health, and not for the distractions of their friends.<br/>
