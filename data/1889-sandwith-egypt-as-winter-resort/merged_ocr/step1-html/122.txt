<span>106 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>

CHAPTER <span style="color: #0000FF;">WI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>VOYAGE UP THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
THE traveller who wishes to visit Luxor, Thebes,<br/>
Philae, or Abu Simbel, is dependent upon the great<br/>
water-way of Egypt. He may go up all the way<br/>
by steamer or by <span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabiyeh</span>, or he may, if he<br/>
chooses, save himself <span style="color: #ff0000;">230 </span>miles by <span style="color: #0000FF;">taking </span>the train<br/>
from Cairo to Assiout. In 1891, the Upper Egypt<br/>
railway <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>have a station in Cairo itself, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">will<br/>
</span>be pushed on to Girgeh, ninety-two miles south,<br/>
so that patients <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>be able to leave Cairo one<br/>
morning and sleep in Luxor the second night. But<br/>
at present we are dependent on a railway station<br/>
three miles outside Cairo, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>tiresome dusty<br/>
journey of eleven hours is necessary to reach<br/>
Assiout. Moreover, the invalid has the double<br/>
disadvantage of starting from Cairo before the day<br/>
is warmed by the sun, and of reaching Assiout<br/>
after sunset. On the other hand, he has the<br/>
advantage of getting without delay into the warmer<br/>
latitude, and of escaping all risk of cold and<br/>
