<br/>
</span>came the large statues of the Hyksos period, and<br/>
columns were removed to Boulak, British Museum,<br/>
and the United States. The rest of the temple is<br/>
still standing.<br/>
<br/>
6. Onias (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tel-elalaoudi</span>), near the station of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shibeen-el-Kanater</span>. There was a Twentieth<br/>
Dynasty palace, now destroyed, and there are<br/>
tombs of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greco-Jewish </span>colony, a large Roman<br/>
camp, and walls of plastered guard-houses three<br/>
feet high.<br/>
<br/>
7. Daphne (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Defneh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Tahpanhes of Old Testament), twelve miles from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salahieh </span>station, <span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span>' from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kantara </span>on the Suez Canal. Here there are<br/>
remains of the fort mentioned by Jeremiah, and<br/>
a Greek camp around it; Twenty-sixth Dynasty,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">6604560 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B.0</span>. Large quantities of painted<br/>
archaic Greek pottery now in the British Museum<br/>
came from here.<br/>
<br/>
8. Naucratis (Tel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gaief</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;">five </span>miles from Tehel-Baroud station. Here we may still see the site<br/>
of the Greek town and temples to Apollo, Aphrodite, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dioscuri</span>, etc., and by searching, many small<br/>
objects and painted pottery can be found, date<br/>
660 <span style="color: #ff0000;">13.0. </span>to 200 A.D. A great deal of archaic Greek<br/>
pottery was taken from here to the British Museum.<br/>
It will be remembered that the site of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Naucratis<br/>
</span>was quite lost, until one day Mr. Petrie was shown<br/>
by a Bedouin a piece <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Greek statue near Cairo,<br/>
