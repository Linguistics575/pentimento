hand, there are plenty of doctors and others in<br/>
Cairo who came to the country as <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmed </span>consumptives, and are now <span style="color: #0000FF;">hard-working </span>and apparently healthy members of the community. The<br/>
disease attacks blacks, who are, of course, living<br/>
as foreigners in a cold northern latitude; and those<br/>
of the Egyptians who are saturated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">scrofula<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Oh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">syphilis </span>may fall a prey to it.<br/>

During September and October those living on the<br/>
river-banks are liable to contract mild intermittent<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>simple continued fever, but at other times of<br/>

elsewhere are free of <span style="color: #0000FF;">malarious </span>attacks.<br/>

Ophthalmia in its granular form I have never<br/>
seen among any visitors <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>among <span style="color: #0000FF;">English </span>residents who are ordinarily careful of their eyes; the<br/>
catarrhal <span style="color: #0000FF;">ophthalmia </span>occurs among many who<br/>
live in the country, and is troublesome <span style="color: #ff0000;">whetuthe<br/>
</span>winds laden with imperceptibly fine dust are<br/>
blowing. The best protection is to wear gauze<br/>
goggles to keep out the glare and dust, to use <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>saturated solution of <span style="color: #0000FF;">boracic </span>acid to wash the<br/>
eyes as a toilet requisite, and to employ, when<br/>
necessary, weak <span style="color: #ff0000;">collyria </span>of sulphate of <span style="color: #0000FF;">zinc</span>.<br/>
