Dr. Worthington found that in January, 1889,<br/>

Dr. T. D. Savill spent January, 1888, in one of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cook</span>'s steamers, travelling from Cairo to Wady<br/>
Halfa and back, and kindly took some notes for<br/>
me. His thermometers <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>hung <span style="color: #0000FF;">below </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>awning where the passengers sit by day. He<br/>
found the average maximum <span style="color: #0000FF;">703</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, and the absolute<br/>
maximum 77° (above Assouan); the average<br/>
minimum <span style="color: #0000FF;">472°</span>, and the absolute minimum <span style="color: #ff0000;">40°<br/>
