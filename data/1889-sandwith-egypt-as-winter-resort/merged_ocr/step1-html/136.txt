<span>120 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
Luxor is a large village of 4000 natives, is 450<br/>
miles south of Cairo, and must be reached from<br/>
Cairo or Assiout by steamer or dahabiyeh.<br/>
<br/>
Season.--<span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">?</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>who wish to make the voyage up<br/>
the Nile in a dahabiyeh, and then live in it at or<br/>
near Luxor, should start from Cairo at the end of<br/>
November, because they will then have a <span style="color: #0000FF;">delightful<br/>
</span>summer trip without cold win'ds. After the middle<br/>
of December the north wind, which is so pleasant on<br/>
land, is apt to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">piercingly </span>cold for invalids on the<br/>
river, and requires the use of thick clothes and rugs.<br/>
Invalids going up in a steamer from Cairo should<br/>
leave not later than the third week of December,<br/>
because they will thus avoid the rain and cloudiness to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>Cairo is then liable. Lastly, those<br/>
patients who leave Cairo later than Christmas Day<br/>
should shorten the Nile trip by taking train to<br/>
Assiout, or must be content to be kept well out of<br/>
harm's way on the river north of that town. At<br/>
Assiout they will find <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fair hotel and some English<br/>
officials.<br/>
<br/>
Patients begin to leave Luxor at any time after<br/>
the middle of February, and very few are up the<br/>
river as late as the middle of April.<br/>
<br/>
The English doctor is in residence at Luxor<br/>
Hotel from the middle of December to the end of<br/>
March, and there is now also an English chaplain.<br/>
During the whole season there are, of course, con<br/>
