Alexandria than at Ismailia, because they may be<br/>
obliged to traverse the Suez Canal by night, and<br/>
then be put ashore uncomfortably in a boat in the<br/>
early morning. Moreover, two trains run from<br/>
Alexandria to Cairo in three and <span style="color: #0000FF;">three-quarter<br/>
</span>hours, while from Ismailia to Cairo there is only<br/>
one passenger train in the day, occupying four and<br/>
three-quarter hours. At neither port is there any<br/>
custom-house <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>for personal baggage, and<br/>
no passport is necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Proposed <span style="color: #0000FF;">itinerary-Delicate </span>patients should<br/>
leave Europe at the middle or end of October, so<br/>
as to arrive in Cairo early in November. Some<br/>
remain in Cairo all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">winter</span>; others go up the<br/>
Nile to Luxor in December or <span style="color: #0000FF;">January</span>, and return<br/>
to Cairo at the end of February. In April they<br/>
should go to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bamleh</span>, and thence perhaps to Italy<br/>
and the south of France, <span style="color: #0000FF;">arranging </span>not to reach<br/>
England or other cold climates till the very end of<br/>
May.<br/>
