<br/>
could run a few steps, walk downstairs quickly and without<br/>
ungainly gait, and she had <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>little pain, and much less<br/>
cracking in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">knee-joints</span>. The improvement was <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span>due to sunshine and the dry climate, and when the air of<br/>
Cairo became hot and dry in April she improved all the<br/>
more. The following August she could play golf in Scotland<br/>
for two hours at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>time, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>had had no return of stiffness<br/>
in the joints, though the previous summer she had been<br/>
unable to walk on the links even with the aid of a stick.<br/>
These brief notes of two cases are <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>to show that<br/>
Egypt is worth a trial to sufferers from <span style="color: #0000FF;">rheumatoid </span>arthritis.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen great improvement and eventual cure in <span style="color: #0000FF;">so.me<br/>
</span>severe cases of G. rheumatism, the hot dry climate being<br/>
the only relieving agent. One patient arrived wholly unable<br/>
to walk, with one lower extremity completely stiff, after<br/>
severe arthritis keeping him fourteen weeks in bed. In<br/>
two months and a half he could walk up and downstairs,<br/>
but could not yet kneel; later on he almost recovered in<br/>
England.<br/>
<br/>
Gout, again, is an unknown disease among the people of<br/>
Egypt, and all chronic cases are liable to be improved <span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span>,<br/>
and the chances of an acute attack <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>lessened.<br/>
<br/>
Heart disease and kidney disease patients are often sent<br/>
to Egypt, the former, because it is a country where active<br/>
exercise is not required, and the individual can keep himself<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">warm </span>without any trouble<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the latter, because the skin will<br/>
relieve the kidneys of much otherwise necessary work.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Amemia</span>, with the train of symptoms with which all<br/>
doctors <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>so familiar in young girls, is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prominent<br/>
</span>sign of a disorder which is <span style="color: #ff0000;">to1erably </span>certain to improve<br/>
in Cairo. There is a healthy outdoor life, with plenty of<br/>
light and warmth, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiency </span>of daily interest. The<br/>
patient soon becomes able to eat and digest, and to take<br/>
preparations of iron which had hitherto seemed impossible.<br/>
This has been a result quickly arrived at in most cases<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
