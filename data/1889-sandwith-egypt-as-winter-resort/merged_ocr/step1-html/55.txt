<span>Cairo. <span style="color: #ff0000;">30<br/>
<br/>
</span>Starlings arrive. Oranges and lemons again, as in<br/>
all the winter months. Balsam and <span style="color: #0000FF;">heliotrope</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jouary.</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">There </span>is often a cold south <span style="color: #0000FF;">wind </span>from<br/>
the desert, and though the days are not really cold,<br/>
the evenings require a fire indoors and <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>overcoat abroad. Lung invalids ought <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>to be out<br/>
after sunset. Temperature like the last week of<br/>
September in England. Quail return to Upper<br/>
Egypt from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Soudan</span>. Roses bloom all the<br/>
year round in Cairo, but they are now at their<br/>
best. Hyacinth, camellia, mignonette, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ranunculus</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eyelamen</span>, verbena, gypsophila, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">orange-flowers</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fehrvtavy.-Tempevai1we </span>like a dry English<br/>
September, chilly at the' beginning of the month,<br/>
but warm and pleasant at the end, so that fires<br/>
and overcoats are <span style="color: #0000FF;">hardly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wanted </span>at night. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Invalids<br/>
</span>return from Luxor to Cairo at the end of February<br/>
to escape the south winds, which begin earlier<br/>
there. Quail breed in Upper Egypt, and appear<br/>
again in Lower Egypt; starlings take their flight.<br/>
Oranges, lemons, and loquats. Violets, petunias,<br/>
phlox, bougainvillia, and roses.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jlarrlt.-TernperMure </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little like London in<br/>
July, but the great feature of this month is the<br/>
south wind, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is almost certain to blow at least<br/>
twice for two or three days at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>time. It is at first<br/>
welcomed as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>pleasant change after the cold<br/>
weather, but soon becomes disagreeable. The last<br/>
<br/>
