CHAPTER VIII.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Lrrsow</span>--<span style="color: #ff0000;">Assovss</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">LUXOR </span>is becoming more and more popular every<br/>
winter, and as the season is <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>short one patients<br/>
have hardly time to get tired of its monotony. A<br/>
bright sunny sky, combined with healthy outdoor<br/>
exercise and <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span>sights to visit, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>great<br/>
help towards cheerfulness, and to this we may<br/>
add <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>dry bracing climate, and freedom from rain<br/>
and all atmospheric impurities.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Patterson long ago described the Egyptian<br/>
climate as possessing the warmth of Madeira,<br/>
without its terrible damp and relaxing <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence</span>.<br/>
The days for sending consumptive patients to hot,<br/>
damp climates are almost at an end. In writing<br/>
of Luxor I cannot do better than supplement Dr.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Maclean</span>'s' pamphlet, Which appeared after his<br/>
death, and contained his own experiences as an<br/>
invalid during the winters <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>1877-8-0.<br/>
<br/>
* "Hints <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>Invalids and Travellers, with Observations on the<br/>
Climate of Luxor <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Egypt." 1881.<br/>
