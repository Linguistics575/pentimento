Aboukir, where the lake is now being drained, and<br/>
there are forts connected by torpedoes with the<br/>
bay in which Nelson fought the Battle of the Nile,<br/>
and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">opponent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>"boy stood on the burning<br/>
deck, whence all but he had fled." Near Aboukir<br/>
are the remains of Canopus, with granite columns<br/>
lying about, and whence, in 1888, the statue of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span>II. was transferred to the Boulak<br/>
Museum.<br/>
<br/>
Table VII. has been compiled from statistics kindly<br/>
furnished me by <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>A. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pirona</span>, of Alexandria, and<br/>
is based <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>his meteorological observations of<br/>
the nineteen years, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1870-88</span>, for the Central Meteorological Institute of Vienna. His instruments<br/>
were made in Vienna, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1veetif1ed </span>at the Royal<br/>
Observatory there. The readings <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>barometer<br/>
are at freezing-point, sixty-two feet above sea-level,<br/>
and were taken at 9 <span style="color: #0000FF;">a.m.</span>, 3 <span style="color: #0000FF;">pmr</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">9 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p.111</span>. The<br/>
mean temperatures are based on records at <span style="color: #0000FF;">0 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ann.</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p.m.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">maxima </span>and minima, and coincide with some<br/>
observations made in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1817-40</span>. It will be noticed<br/>
that the prevailing wind is always straight from<br/>
the Mediterranean. The number of rainy days in<br/>
March is 4'5; in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">month </span>of April, only <span style="color: #ff0000;">L5</span>; and<br/>
in May the average further falls to <span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>.<br/>
<br/>
These are the three months when <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramleh </span>is at<br/>
its best, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span>be safely recommended to those<br/>
on their way from Cairo to Europe.<br/>
