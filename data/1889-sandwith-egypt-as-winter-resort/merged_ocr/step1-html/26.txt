<span>10 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
Robust people who are not dependent upon the<br/>
presence of a doctor and stewardess can economize<br/>
by travelling from Liverpool to Alexandria by the<br/>
Moss or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Papayanni </span>lines. For those who are not<br/>
martyrs to sea-sickness, and to the general discomfort of life on board ship, there is no doubt<br/>
that the sea-voyage is very healthy, very restful,<br/>
and useful in gradually <span style="color: #ff0000;">aeeusiiomingr </span>patients to<br/>
change of climate.<br/>
<br/>
Visitors who desire as little of the sea as possible<br/>
must make their way to Brindisi, and then on to<br/>
Alexandria by P. and O. or Austrian Lloyd; <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>from Trieste to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>by Austrian Lloyd; or<br/>
from Genoa or Naples by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rubattino </span>to Alexandria;<br/>
or from Marseilles to Alexandria by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Messageries<br/>
</span>steamers.<br/>
<br/>
The passage from Brindisi to Alexandria takes<br/>
three days and a half, and the whole journey from<br/>
London to Cairo can be done any week in less<br/>
than six days, at about the same expense as the<br/>
long sea routes. Generally, <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">may </span>be said, an<br/>
English-speaking invalid is more comfortable on<br/>
an English steamer, and it <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>be remembered<br/>
that the large vessels <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>go on to India, China,<br/>
and Australia, are often more luxurious than the<br/>
smaller steamers <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>run only between Europe<br/>
and Egypt. On the other hand, invalids must be<br/>
warned that it is easier for them to land at<br/>
<br/>
