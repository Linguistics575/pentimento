sunset, the invalid can easily avoid all cold air,<br/>
and the risks of a sudden drop of the thermometer.<br/>
In March it will often be necessary to pursue the<br/>
opposite tactics, and shut windows during the<br/>
greatest heat of the day, to keep the bedroom from<br/>
getting too hot. This was not done in March,<br/>
1878, and consequently the bedroom average<br/>
jumped up to over <span style="color: #ff0000;">77°</span>. Dr. Maclean made some<br/>
further experiments, to show that the lowest <span style="color: #0000FF;">temperature </span>in the bedroom was usually 20° higher<br/>
than the lowest temperature in the shade, and<br/>
that a low bedroom heat depends chiefly <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the<br/>
presence of a low shade minimum.<br/>
<br/>
The daily <span style="color: #0000FF;">range </span>of the thermometer is always<br/>
very great, as one would expect in an inland dry<br/>
country of the latitude of Luxor. The temperature falls at night, in consequence of the rapid<br/>
radiation of heat which obtains under a cloudless<br/>
sky. But the range of maximum heat from one<br/>
day to another, for the first three months of the<br/>
year, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">3C</span>'<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'W</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">4-7</span>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">38°</span>, showing that during the<br/>
portion of the twenty-four hours available for<br/>
the invalid the climate is remarkably equal.<br/>
<br/>
The humidity is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>good deal lower than that of<br/>
Cairo, being <span style="color: #0000FF;">16'5 </span>per cent. less in January, 15 less<br/>
in February, and 11 less in March. The extremes<br/>
in January, 1878, at Luxor, were 74 and 33; in<br/>
February, 67 and 27; and in March the maximum<br/>
