<br/>
</span>accurate a picture of early Christian worship as<br/>
can anywhere be found. Some of them still have<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eonvents </span>adjoining, and are surrounded by thick<br/>
walls like a fortress, telling tales of old persecution<br/>
about the days of the fifth century, when the Bible<br/>
was translated into the Coptic tongue.<br/>
<br/>
Besides some of the usually visited churches in<br/>
old Cairo, a Copt should be engaged to take the<br/>
visitor to the Church of the Virgin, near the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Meuski</span>, where may be seen the original type of<br/>
the Coptic basilica, with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">baldaorhino </span>supported by<br/>
four columns and semicircular stone seats arranged<br/>
round the apse, and indeed much else of interest.<br/>
<br/>
The modern Coptic cathedral is only worth<br/>
visiting, to see the service, such as on Easter Eve<br/>
01' Easter Day; but it must be remembered that<br/>
their festivals sometimes <span style="color: #0000FF;">take </span>place according to<br/>
0111' calendar, and sometimes by the Old Style,<br/>
twelve days later.<br/>
<br/>
A riding or driving excursion <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>of course be<br/>
made to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Knit </span>Bey, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the<br/>
so-called tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The palaces of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoobm</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh</span>, and Ghizeh<br/>
are all worth visiting if a permit can be obtained,<br/>
because they have lovely gardens, and remind one<br/>
of the former glories of late Khedives. It is to the<br/>
last of these three that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beulah </span>Museum is now<br/>
being transferred.<br/>
