each of about 2700 square yards, and after <span style="color: #0000FF;">filtration </span>it is received into two closed reservoirs.<br/>
The filters are 2 ft. 4 in. deep, and consist of<br/>
sand, different sizes of gravel and stones, which<br/>
come from the Red Hill at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh</span>, before mentioned. The sand is pure white, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>pit <span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>a pretty stratum of conglomerate travertine<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>lower layer of conglomerate pebble, and is<br/>
far removed from all danger arising from the<br/>
neighbourhood of old cemeteries. The place for<br/>
getting the sand had to be changed two years ago,<br/>
because the workmen discovered they were near<br/>
the dry osseous remains of an unknown <span style="color: #ff0000;">mediteval<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">burying-plaee</span>. The sand is all washed before<br/>
being used, and the superficial layers of the beds<br/>
are removed every four days in the summer, and<br/>
every eight <span style="color: #0000FF;">days </span>in the winter, when the watel is<br/>
less thick. The deep layers of the beds are only<br/>
changed two <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>three times a year, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is probably not often enough. The beds and plant are<br/>
under the constant inspection of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sanitarypr<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">partment</span>, who have also made some interesting<br/>
analyses of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">filtered </span>Nile water. Table <span style="color: #0000FF;">w.<br/>
</span>shows the results of twenty-three analyses made<br/>
during twelve months, by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr.F</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>E. Pollard, F.I.C.,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">F.C.S.</span>, who has made <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>speciality of the subject.<br/>
The samples were taken in <span style="color: #0000FF;">mid-stream</span>, one yard<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">below </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>surface, and about one hundred yards north<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kasr-el-Nil </span>bridge, near the Company's intake.<br/>
