but various fires have destroyed all trace of former<br/>
dwellings. There remain, however, for those who<br/>

After the records of Arab historians we come<br/>
down to 1830, when <span style="color: #ff0000;">Linaut </span>Pasha, a French<br/>
engineer, discovered that the region of sulphur<br/>
springs extended southward from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helouan </span>to<br/>
opposite <span style="color: #ff0000;">Benisuef</span>, where <span style="color: #0000FF;">borings </span>used to be made<br/>
by the natives, who bathed in the springs and built<br/>
tents near them. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1840 </span>the Egyptian Government took possession of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helouan</span>, built wooden<br/>
huts, and even sent sick soldiers to be experimented<br/>
on by the waters. The results were so satisfactory<br/>
that the spot began to be a little popular, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">it<br/>
</span>was not until 1871 <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>the Government could<br/>
make up its mind either to work the springs itself<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>to let them to an intelligent European. In<br/>
that year a Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Reil </span>was appointed Director<br/>
of the Baths, a small town began gradually to<br/>
spring up, and in 1873 the Grand Hotel was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span>and was <span style="color: #ff0000;">eo1ofided </span>to its present manager.<br/>
Trees were planted, the swamps were drained,<br/>
and in 1876 a railway from Cairo was opened.<br/>
Great improvements have been made to the baths,<br/>
and the place is every <span style="color: #0000FF;">year </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">becoming </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>popular,<br/>
the number of baths <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>1885 having been only<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">7 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">031</span>, and being new doubled every year.<br/>
