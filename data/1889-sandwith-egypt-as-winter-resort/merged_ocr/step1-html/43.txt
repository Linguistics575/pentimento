<span>Cairo. 27<br/>
<br/>
was 111'8° on July 13, while on the night of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">January </span>20, the absolute minimum of <span style="color: #ff0000;">364° </span>was<br/>
recorded. In 1887, the highest maximum was<br/>
110° on June 9, and the lowest minimum<br/>
was 35" <span style="color: #0000FF;">Y </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">January</span>. Freezing-point seems<br/>
never to be reached in Cairo; but a shallow dish<br/>
of water placed in the wind on the ground in the<br/>
desert, may be found occasionally <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a thin<br/>
coating of ice. I may say here, for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">information </span>of those who believe that Cairo is a furnace<br/>
in the summer, that the indoor temperature of<br/>
rooms on the north side of the house, kept properly shut during the hot hours, need never during<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">year </span>exceed <span style="color: #0000FF;">83° </span>Fahr.; and, on the other<br/>
hand, that the same rooms, <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the depths of<br/>
winter, if properly opened to receive the warm<br/>
outer air during the day, need never have <span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>temperature below 52° Fahr., without employing a<br/>
fire<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>By living in sunny south rooms, or by employing <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>heat, the invalid can be certain<br/>
all night in the winter of a temperature of <span style="color: #ff0000;">65°<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fahr.</span>, or more.<br/>
<br/>
My observations, therefore, correspond with the<br/>
results obtained by the Rev<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Dr. Barnett in Cairo,<br/>
Which I give in Table II. For nearly two years<br/>
he took observations six times daily, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mm</span>.<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">9 </span>p.m., to ascertain the indoor temperature of<br/>
an ordinary house.<br/>
