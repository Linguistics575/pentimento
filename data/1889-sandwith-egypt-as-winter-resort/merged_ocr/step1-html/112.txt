ataxy, but he found no benefit from them, and<br/>
believed that the hot water was distinctly injurious<br/>
to him.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Excursions-On </span>all sides there is the desert for<br/>
walking or donkey-riding, and there are two roads<br/>
for carriage-exercise. Near the hills <span style="color: #0000FF;">flint </span>implements can be found. There are some old alabaster<br/>
quarries to visit, and in the same neighbourhood<br/>
is an old dam discovered by Professor Schweinfurth.<br/>

Shooting-parties sometimes go out for gazelles,<br/>
hyenas, wolves, foxes, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">jaekals</span>.<br/>

I have already said that the trip to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkfwah<br/>
</span>can very conveniently be made from Helouan, and<br/>
one can also go to the quarries of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tours </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Maaserah</span>, which are of great extent and <span style="color: #0000FF;">wonderfully </span>interesting. From them came the stone<br/>
blocks and easing of the Ghizeh Pyramids, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
</span>the quarries are still used to supply <span style="color: #0000FF;">flagstones</span>, we<br/>
can compare the rough work of the present masons<br/>
with the dexterous <span style="color: #0000FF;">neatness </span>of past ages. No<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eartouehes </span>have been discovered in the quarries<br/>
older than the Twelfth Dynasty, and perhaps the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">commonest </span>seen to-day is that of Hakor of the<br/>
Twenty-ninth.<br/>

An intelligent donkey-boy will help us to explore<br/>
one of the many waterless valleys of the neighbourhood, where the dry water-courses still have green<br/>
