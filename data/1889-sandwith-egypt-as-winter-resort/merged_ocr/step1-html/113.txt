<span>Suburbs of Cairo. <span style="color: #ff0000;">97<br/>
<br/>
</span>tufts on the banks, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>find <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycophyllum</span>, belladonna, and heather growing, while, if it chances to<br/>
be February or May, we are in luck, and see many<br/>
desert flowers, We can trace the former ravages<br/>
of the Mediterranean Sea; we find stray pieces of<br/>
petrified wood, coprolites, and fossilized oyster-beds.<br/>
The only live things we see are vultures, rabbits,<br/>
martens, chameleons, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lizards</span>, locusts, and innumerable snails, till we come upon a gipsy Bedouin,<br/>
with one cotton rag tied over his head and crossed<br/>
round <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>neck, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>second tied round his waist<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>He has a lean donkey or two feeding on the stray<br/>
tufts, a, long pipe<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>powder-horn, some shot, and<br/>
a drink of water, which he willingly gives us<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In<br/>
the mountains, we stumble on a dry waterfall with<br/>
a sheer precipice of several hundred feet, and<br/>
boulders rounded by torrential waters; and though<br/>
we walk and explore nearly the whole day, we<br/>
suffer very little fatigue, because the cool breeze<br/>
of the desert is as invigorating as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>sparkling<br/>
wine.<br/>

THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">PYRAMIDS</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Twenty-two years ago, visitors to the Pyramids<br/>
at Ghizeh were obliged to rise very early in the<br/>
morning, mount donkeys to the river's edge,<br/>
whence they were ferried across, and had to be<br/>
