<span>140 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
the English regiment quartered in Alexandria vies<br/>
with the naval and civilian population. Needless<br/>
to say, there are many hospitable evening parties,<br/>
and, as the weather gets <span style="color: #ff0000;">warmer,1noonlight </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">donkeyexcursions </span>for the adventurous. Bathing and<br/>
fishing are always within reach; and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>harbour provides excellent sailing. From<br/>
November to March, plenty of duck and snipe<br/>
shooting can be had at Damietta, and within an<br/>
hour of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramleh</span>; and for about a <span style="color: #0000FF;">month </span>from the<br/>
middle of March, there is good <span style="color: #0000FF;">quail-shooting </span>at<br/>
Abu Homes, Damanhour, etc. From July to<br/>
October, foreign sportsmen shoot doves, hoopoes,<br/>
and other birds in the neighbourhood; and in<br/>
September the quail come again in such numbers<br/>
that one day (in 1887) two hundred and forty were<br/>
shot by a Greek resident.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Siot-seeirtp</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mas</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>it is only with the eye of<br/>
faith that we can see relics of the famous city<br/>
founded 2200 years ago, and once <span style="color: #0000FF;">boasting </span>a<br/>
muster-roll of 500,000 souls. An English sentry<br/>
paces above the ruins of the Museum where Euclid,<br/>
Aristophanes, and Hypatia were once professors.<br/>
Where the Grand Square now stands was a long<br/>
row of obelisks and sphinxes leading to the famous<br/>
Library; but of old buildings nothing now remains<br/>
but a granite pillar or two in the native quarter of<br/>
the town. The two obelisks brought by a Caesar<br/>
