smaller ones, three or four "pensions," and a<br/>
dozen <span style="color: #0000FF;">lodging-houses</span>, two clubs, three theatres,<br/>
and streets of European shops. Very little trace<br/>
of the bombardment and fire of 1882 remains, and<br/>
since Â£4,000,000 of indemnity were paid by the<br/>
Egyptian Government, building has been stimulated to such an extent that there are many <span style="color: #ff0000;">new<br/>
</span>houses and shops which cannot find a tenant.<br/>
<br/>
Among medical men there is a well-known<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Scotchman</span>, who with his assistants has for three<br/>
decades administered to the wants of the British<br/>
colony, and he <span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">us </span>colleagues a dozen Europeans<br/>
of the first rank, besides an American dentist and<br/>
two oculists. There are three druggists <span style="color: #0000FF;">commanding </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eoufidenee</span>, three trained English nurses for<br/>
private cases at their own homes, and three excellent European hospitals where private patients<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>received.<br/>

The <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-supply </span>of the town is excellent, and is<br/>
in the hands of an English company, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>has <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>monopoly for ever, and is represented on the spot<br/>
by an energetic and highly intelligent English<br/>
civil engineer. The water is obtained from the<br/>
Mahmoudieh canal, which branches off the Nile at<br/>
Atfeh; but if, during low Nile, there is any danger<br/>
of the river at Atfeh becoming brackish, the supply<br/>
is taken from higher up the Nile near Cairo. The<br/>
banks of the canal are inspected by watchmen, to<br/>
