prevent natives from throwing carcasses or emptying drains into it, and they also flush the canal<br/>
every ten days with 500,000 tons of Nile water.<br/>
<br/>
At high Nile the water is so muddy that it is<br/>
necessary to mix with it alum and iron before it<br/>
is pumped into the filter-beds. Also if chemical<br/>
analysis shows an abnormal percentage of organic<br/>
matter, permanganate of soda is mixed with the<br/>
water before it reaches the filter-beds. There are<br/>
three filter-beds, each 2400 yards square, and<br/>
covered with wood. The beds are 2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gin</span>. deep,<br/>
and consist of sand, Which is brought from the<br/>
sea-shore near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damietta</span>, and of four different sizes<br/>
of gravel, laid on bricks, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>placed as to<br/>
make <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>ready communication between the lower<br/>
layers and the pumps for cleansing purposes. The<br/>
sand is well washed in water, and the beds cleaned<br/>
every nine days. From the filter-beds the water<br/>
is pumped into a reservoir, and thence into Alexandria, at the rate of 26,000 cubic metres a day.<br/>
<br/>
Though the water-supply is so well cared for,<br/>
the drainage of Alexandria cannot be commended.<br/>
Since 1871 the streets of the town have been<br/>
paved, like Naples, with slabs of lava from Catania,<br/>
and the drains, originally laid down by the Paving<br/>
Commission for storm-water, have been used as<br/>
overflows for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eesspools </span>under the houses. The<br/>
culverts run out to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>sea-shore, but some are<br/>
