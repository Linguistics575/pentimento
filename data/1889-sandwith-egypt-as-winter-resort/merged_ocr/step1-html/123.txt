individual case must be settled upon its own<br/>
merits, and care taken to secure the minimum<br/>
cold and fatigue.<br/>
<br/>
There are many people who make the Nile trip<br/>
without leaving their steamer or <span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabiyeh</span>, and<br/>
some even make two steamer trips up the Nile in<br/>
one winter. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cook</span>'s steamers are made as comfortable as possible, and he does everything he can<br/>
to minimize the draught and cold for delicate<br/>
passengers. His firm has <span style="color: #0000FF;">what </span>is almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>complete monopoly of the river <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>south of Cairo,<br/>
and, as some 1500 visitors proceeded up the Nile<br/>
in the winter of 1888-0, those intending to do so<br/>
would be wise to secure accommodation in advance.<br/>
<br/>
Four large steamers, luxuriously fitted up, ply<br/>
between Cairo and Assouan between November and<br/>
March, and on each of them there are two rooms<br/>
nine <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>ten feet high specially reserved for invalids<br/>
who are obliged to keep their cabins until they<br/>
reach the universal sunshine of Luxor. The<br/>
ordinary cabins have one or two berths, and convey<br/>
fifty <span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Passengers</span>, and are provided with<br/>
electric bells, and windows protected by glass,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Venetians</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">wire </span>gauze. There are also ladies'<br/>
saloons, piano, and library, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>plentiful supply<br/>
of fresh food of all kinds.<br/>
<br/>
Every steamer, large and small, carries an<br/>
