<span>130 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
ASSOUAN.<br/>
<br/>
There is no hotel as yet at the First Cataract,<br/>
but we ought soon to see one built, for winter<br/>
residents at Luxor would find it an agreeable<br/>
change to go now and then to Assouan; and<br/>
Shellal, opposite the island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>, has been recommended as a perfect <span style="color: #ff0000;">aanaborium </span>by Dr. Abbate<br/>
Pasha.<br/>
<br/>
Assouan is 133 miles higher up the river than<br/>
Luxor-that is, 583 miles south of Cairo. The<br/>
temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>is only 35 miles from Luxor, and<br/>
Edfu temple is half-way to Assouan; then, 26 miles<br/>
further on, we come to the sights of Silsileh, and<br/>
then the temple of Kom Ombo, a few miles north<br/>
of Assouan.<br/>
<br/>
Assouan has <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>varied native population of about<br/>
9000, and is well guarded by forts, and by 2000<br/>
Egyptian troops under English <span style="color: #ff0000;">offiee1z</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Visitors will be interested in the granite quarries,<br/>
rocks of schist, granite, and basalt, Sir F. Grenfell's tombs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine </span>Island, the shooting of<br/>
the cataract, and the lovely temple on the Island<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philw</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Temperature-No </span>regular meteorological records<br/>
have been taken at Assouan, but the Army Medical<br/>
Staff took a few notes during the Nile expedition<br/>
