which we can walk for miles without getting tired.<br/>
Moreover, our desert is by no means a perfect<br/>
desert like the Sahara, devoid of vegetation.<br/>
<br/>
In February, after the winter rain, green herbs<br/>
and bushes sprout in the hollows, ravines, and<br/>
valleys, and the flora are at their finest in March<br/>
and April. After this the sun becomes too hot<br/>
for them, and in the summer only the <span style="color: #ff0000;">deepervooted </span>trees and shrubs remain. The desert thorn<br/>
is beloved by camels; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">zygophyllums </span>are very<br/>
common and always succulent, but they are too<br/>
salt except for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hungriest </span>camels. The bitter<br/>
colocynth and <span style="color: #0000FF;">senna </span>are used by the Bedouins.<br/>
The desert flora are by no means rich, but a<br/>
hundred species can be collected by diligent<br/>
amateurs, and the number of possible species<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Six </span>hundred. Desert plants cannot be cultivated in gardens; but, on the other hand, those<br/>
species that have found their way from civilized<br/>
spots into the wilds, seem to thrive <span style="color: #0000FF;">untended </span>in<br/>
the desert. Rabbits, hares, foxes, jerboas, and<br/>
lizards, all <span style="color: #0000FF;">desert-coloured </span>like the camel, are the<br/>
animals one meets with most often. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">neigh-</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">bourhood </span>of any old <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis</span>, we find bits of<br/>
granite and other monuments <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>have now<br/>
disappeared; relics of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tlint </span>age may be found<br/>
by careful searching, and many geological remains,<br/>
including numerous fragments of <span style="color: #0000FF;">petrified </span>wood.<br/>
