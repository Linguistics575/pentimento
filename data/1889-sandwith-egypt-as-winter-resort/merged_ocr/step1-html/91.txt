<span>Excursions from Cairo. 75<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu-el-Stroud </span>is another water named after an<br/>
Egyptian doctor of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteenth </span>century. It is<br/>
without colour and odour, and keeps well in a hot<br/>
country. It is in great request among some<br/>
Europeans and natives for disorders of digestion,<br/>
and it has a distinct aperient effect. Its <span style="color: #0000FF;">source<br/>
</span>is said to be from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam </span>hills, and it is<br/>
drunk at an establishment in Old Cairo, or bottled<br/>
there for home use. There is also <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>swimming<br/>
bath there of temperature 86° Fahr. No accurate<br/>
analysis has yet been made. Reaction neutral;<br/>
no gas; temperature, 86° Fahr. The principal<br/>
ingredients are sulphates of soda and magnesia,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">chlorides </span>of sodium, magnesium, and calcium.<br/>
There are no nitrates or ammonia.<br/>
<br/>
The Barrage should certainly be visited, if it<br/>
is only to see how the pluck and skill of English<br/>
engineers have made it possible for some nine feet<br/>
of water to be held up at the times when every<br/>
drop of the Nile is wanted for <span style="color: #0000FF;">land-irrigation</span>.<br/>
It is a long ride, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>very pleasant trip by<br/>
steamer 01' by train, and the neighbourhood is very<br/>
pretty.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Scrhbirah.-Tlse </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">pleasantest </span>way of making this<br/>
excursion is by steamer to and from Cairo; but<br/>
even then there is a two hours' donkey-ride from<br/>
the landing-place to the Necropolis. If a steamer<br/>
cannot be obtained, it is quite possible to go by<br/>
<br/>
