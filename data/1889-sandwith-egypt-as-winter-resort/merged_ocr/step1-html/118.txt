wager, and also a week's fright and rest in bed.<br/>
The descent from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Pyramid is more unpleasant.<br/>
to most people than the being hauled up.<br/>
<br/>
The visit to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">interior </span>is quite worth the fatigue<br/>
to those who are fairly strong, because the traveller<br/>
then gets an accurate idea of what these gigantic<br/>
tombs were intended for.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to avoid all altercation with the<br/>
Bedouins, who are pleasant, amiable, and gentlemanly, with an eye <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>on the main chance, is<br/>
to let them choose one of their number to take<br/>
charge of the party, and to receive all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">backsheesh</span>. It will then be to his interest to protect<br/>
the party from all his brethren; and it may be<br/>
said generally that if any <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>arises it is<br/>
the fault of the traveller.<br/>

The road up the Pyramid hill was repaired in<br/>
1881 from chips of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">easing </span>of the Great Pyramid;<br/>
and, in addition to many other thefts during several<br/>
ages, the Sultan Hassam mosque is said to have<br/>
been built in <span style="color: #0000FF;">AD</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1056</span>, from the stones of the<br/>
Great Pyramid. It seems to have been less trouble<br/>
for Cairo architects to take their stone from<br/>
Memphis and the Pyramids than to have it hewn<br/>
afresh from the quarries which originally supplied<br/>
it, and were actually nearer to Cairo.<br/>
