ment in every respect, except that she occasionally had<br/>
blood-stained <span style="color: #0000FF;">expectoration </span>in the morning. In September,<br/>
1889, her doctor reported that <span style="color: #0000FF;">her </span>improvement continued,<br/>
both lungs were sound, and there had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>more <span style="color: #ff0000;">hzemorrhage</span>.<br/>
<br/>
There is, as might be expected, great improvement in the<br/>
cases of lung-disease which apparently begin as pleurisy,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pleuro-pneumonia</span>, or pneumonia, and anaemic, <span style="color: #0000FF;">delicate</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">looking </span>people go home <span style="color: #0000FF;">sunburnt</span>, and able to walk, ride,<br/>
and play <span style="color: #0000FF;">lawn-tennis</span>, after two <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>three months' stay in<br/>
Cairo. The cases which do not improve much are often<br/>
those who will not stay indoors after twilight, and expose<br/>
themselves to cold and damp during December and <span style="color: #0000FF;">January</span>.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen <span style="color: #0000FF;">considerable </span>improvement in some cases of<br/>
laryngeal phthisis, but more in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">general </span>state than locally.<br/>
Most of the cases of advanced phthisis which have grown<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">worse </span>in Egypt have been complicated with chronic <span style="color: #0000FF;">diarrhoea</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>There are several apparently healthy residents now in Cairo<br/>
who originally came there from Europe for their health,<br/>
some of them having had <span style="color: #0000FF;">haemoptysis </span>and other lung<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">symptoms<br/>
<br/>
</span>Chronic <span style="color: #ff0000;">hvonehitis.</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>good many <span style="color: #ff0000;">emphysematons </span>patients<br/>
come to Cairo every winter, because they find they can get<br/>
through the cold months with less cough, less discomfort,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">far </span>less <span style="color: #ff0000;">confmement</span>. Those whose bronchial tubes are<br/>
irritated by the fine dust in the air on sand-storm days must<br/>
then remain shut up in their houses, just as they would to<br/>
avoid fog, rain, and east wind elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Asthrnu.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">All </span>the cases that I have seen in Egypt have<br/>
improved and done well, excepting two. Several former<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">asthmatic </span>patients have settled down as residents in the<br/>
country, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>English lady, who has had dry asthma for<br/>
twenty <span style="color: #0000FF;">yours</span>, comes every year to Cairo and the Nile because<br/>
she is quite well <span style="color: #0000FF;">there</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Her </span>brother and other relations<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">suffer </span>from asthma, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">she </span>herself can <span style="color: #0000FF;">live </span>happily in<br/>
London, but in no other part of England that she has yet<br/>
