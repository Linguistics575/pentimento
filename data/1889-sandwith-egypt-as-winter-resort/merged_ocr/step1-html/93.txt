<span>Excursions from Cairo. 77<br/>
<br/>
monumental wonders are <span style="color: #ff0000;">stoffieientiy </span>set forth in<br/>
the guide-books; but some of them are kept purposely buried in the sand to prevent destruction.<br/>
It is usually said that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mummied </span>bulls from<br/>
the Apis Mausoleum are all lost, but the writer<br/>
accidentally found three of them in 1887 in the<br/>
Historical <span style="color: #ff0000;">Soeiety</span>'s Museum in New York. They<br/>
were probably stolen and bought when the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>was discovered in 1861. The tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Till</span>, of<br/>
the Fifth Dynasty, contains wall sculptures in such<br/>
excellent preservation that it should be visited by<br/>
all; and there is another tomb kept closed which<br/>
is by no means inferior. From these life-like<br/>
sculptures and others much has been learnt about<br/>
the manners and customs of those who lived more<br/>
than five thousand years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Recent discoveries in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eyyptt</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">Full </span>accounts of<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>been published in their special transactions,<br/>
but not yet in the guide-books, so the remainder of<br/>
this chapter will be devoted to recapitulating them<br/>
for the benefit of travellers who desire to visit the<br/>
spots which have been worked during the English<br/>
occupation.<br/>
