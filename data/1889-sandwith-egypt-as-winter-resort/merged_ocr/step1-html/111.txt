the cure is of use, because the skin and kidneys<br/>
are made to <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>better, and the interval between<br/>
acute attacks may be prolonged.<br/>
<br/>
Again, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">sub-acute </span>rheumatism, or in cases <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
</span>recent cardiac mischief, the baths are not indicated; but in all cases of chronic rheumatism,<br/>
whether of joints, muscles, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>nerve-sheaths, great<br/>
benefit is always derived. Some troublesome cases<br/>
of sciatica, too, have got great good from Helouan,<br/>
and all local affections dependent on rheumatism<br/>
and gout, or connected with either of them, have<br/>
a good chance of being either cured or relieved.<br/>
<br/>
As might be expected, some diseases of the skin,<br/>
such as eczema, acne, prurigo, ecthyma, scabies,<br/>
etc., get great benefit here, and it is believed that<br/>
the waters would prove of value in leprosy if <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>separate establishment could be specially built for<br/>
the few natives afflicted with it. The baths have<br/>
been strongly recommended for inveterate cases<br/>
of syphilis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">dysmenorrhoea</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">amenorrhoea</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">endocervicitis</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">1eucovrhava</span>, some cases of sterility, cystitis,<br/>
and even diabetes. The inhalation and gargles are<br/>
said to be of use for bronchitis, asthma, and laryngeal, pharyngeal, and nasal <span style="color: #0000FF;">catarrh</span>. Good has<br/>
often resulted from the employment of baths in<br/>
cases of old gunshot wounds, or in the stiffness<br/>
resulting from fractures <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>sprains<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>I advised <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
