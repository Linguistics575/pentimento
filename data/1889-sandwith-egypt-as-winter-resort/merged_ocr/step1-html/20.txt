whom he would do well to imitate. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Judged </span>by the<br/>
thermometer, we find that the mean annual temperature of London is 50° <span style="color: #0000FF;">Palm</span>, and the same<br/>
isothermal line passes through New York, though<br/>
the climates of the two cities are from other<br/>
reasons widely different. The Royal Observatory<br/>
at Greenwich supplies us with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>daily average temperature for the last fifty years, and by consulting<br/>
this we find that on October 19 the average temperature falls below 50°, descending in January<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">36°</span>, and never regaining 50° again till May.<br/>
Roughly speaking, those fleeing from cold must<br/>
leave England not later than the middle of October,<br/>
and should not return there till at least the end<br/>
of May.<br/>

Let us consider as fairly as possible the advantages and disadvantages of Cairo and the Nile for<br/>
those in search of health.<br/>
<br/>
The advantages are: (1) A dry and exhilarating<br/>
air <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>acts in itself as a tonic, and enables<br/>
visitors to be out-of-doors <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>sunshine the whole<br/>
day. (2) An almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">complete </span>absence of rain,<br/>
and of fog, and of clouded leaden skies. (3) The<br/>
absence of extreme cold, so that the invalid by<br/>
closing his windows at sunset need never breathe<br/>
air colder than 55° Fahr., even without any<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>heat. (4) The absence of strong winds<br/>
at Cairo and Luxor, though invalids <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally<br/>
