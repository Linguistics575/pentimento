<span>68 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
A characteristic view of the town and the<br/>
Pyramids plateau can be obtained from the citadel,<br/>
especially at sunset, and leave should be sought<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">visit </span>the English military hospital there, which<br/>
is one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finesse </span>in the world. The Turkish<br/>
baths are not particularly clean 01' well cared for.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jlosyter-There </span>are in Cairo some three<br/>
hundred mosques, many of which are worth visiting. The following is a list of those which show<br/>
best the wonderful art of the Saracens. They are<br/>
placed in chronological order, and date from A.D.<br/>
640 to A.D. 1503. Amr, Ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tulun</span>, Azhar, El<br/>
Hakim, El <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shafy </span>(mausoleum), Kalaun, El <span style="color: #ff0000;">M </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aridany</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aksunkur </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">blue-tiled</span>), Sultan Hassan, Barkuk, El Muayyad, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kait </span>Bey, El Ghory (two).<br/>
No visitor should miss seeing the Khedivial<br/>
Library, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>contains an unrivalled collection<br/>
of Korans, Commentaries on the Koran, and<br/>
Traditions, many of Which have been taken for<br/>
safe keeping out of the mosques above mentioned.<br/>
Then, too, there is the Museum of Arab art, where<br/>
are lamps of brass and of glass, chandeliers,<br/>
tables, old mosque doors inlaid with ivory, and<br/>
many other beautiful treasures, snatched a few<br/>
years ago from the interior of uncared-for mosques.<br/>
<br/>
Coptic <span style="color: #ff0000;">elrttreloes.-These </span>are deeply interesting,<br/>
because the old buildings are in good preservation,<br/>
and in their construction and fittings give us as<br/>
