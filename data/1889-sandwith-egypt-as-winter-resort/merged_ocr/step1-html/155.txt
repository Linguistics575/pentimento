Ramleh has been a wonderfully healthy spot;<br/>
but the day will come when the subsoil Will be<br/>
saturated with all the water used for the gardens,<br/>
baths, and kitchens, and some scheme of drainage<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
The water-supply is pumped straight from the<br/>
canal of the Alexandria Company, unfiltered, to<br/>
a reservoir, and thence to Ramleh at the rate<br/>
of 12,000 cubic metres a day. For use in the<br/>
house, it is then filtered through native porous<br/>
jars. The greater part of the water is of course<br/>
used for the private gardens, where, besides many<br/>
English flowers and fruits, one sees oleanders,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">point-settias</span>, hibiscus, bougainvillia, <span style="color: #0000FF;">begonia </span>trees,<br/>
indiarubber trees towering almost as high as the<br/>
palms, and grapes, bananas, oranges, figs, and<br/>
melons. The desert abounds in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>great variety of<br/>
small flowers; and one of the features of this<br/>
neighbourhood is the ice-plant (<span style="color: #ff0000;">JIcscmbryanthemum<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cristallinun0</span>. Altogether the botanist Will find<br/>
more than two hundred specimens of interest in<br/>
and near Ramleh, while the sea-coast is covered<br/>
with beautiful shells.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Amuserueuts.-The </span>English residents boast of as<br/>
many as fifteen lawn-tennis courts, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">book-club</span>,<br/>
and even a race meeting during two <span style="color: #0000FF;">days </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">June</span>.<br/>
There are paper chases on ponies and donkeys, and<br/>
an occasional gymkhana, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">erieket-matclo</span>, when<br/>
