There are landaus for those who wish them, and<br/>
also broughams for going out at night. The roads<br/>
are wide and good, and shaded better than almost<br/>
any other city with avenues of acacia (Albizzia<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lebbek</span>), so that <span style="color: #0000FF;">carriage-exercise </span>is rendered very<br/>
