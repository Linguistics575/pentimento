<span style="color: #0000FF;">Library.-Besides </span>booksellers in the town, there<br/>
is a very good circulating library with more than<br/>
two thousand popular works, including many<br/>
relating to Egypt. This is a recent improvement,<br/>
and greatly appreciated by travellers.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hospital-Paying</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>patients are received at a<br/>
German and at an Austrian hospital, but the<br/>
former is generally patronized by the English who<br/>
desire hospital treatment and the kind nursing of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kaiserwerth </span>deaconesses. The female wards of<br/>
the native hospital for free patients are now under<br/>

wrote "Aida" in the days of the late <span style="color: #ff0000;">1fhedive's<br/>

whom have been Sarah Bernhardt and M. Coquelin.<br/>
At a second theatre there is often Italian comedy<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>to be seen, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>wandering circus visits us every<br/>
year.<br/>

built by the Emir <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezbeky</span>, a general of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kait </span>Bey<br/>
