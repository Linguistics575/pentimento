<br/>
north of it. Hermit crabs and very many others<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crab </span>family, bivalves and univalves, starshaped egg-urchins (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Echinometra </span>lucunter), crustaceans, sponges, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ooral-hsh</span>, with many scores<br/>
of others, can be found by exploring the coast and<br/>
rocky pools.<br/>
<br/>
By means of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>boat on a clear day, a visit to the<br/>
coral reefs may be made, though the best coral is<br/>
at some distance from Suez. Dark brown and<br/>
yellowish green coral in loose and brittle bits is<br/>
based here on massive rocks of black mesh coral<br/>
(Porites), and more rarely there may be found the<br/>
cherry-red cup-star variety (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pocillopora</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">-not </span>to<br/>
be confounded with the ordinary red coral, which<br/>
is not found here.<br/>
<br/>
The strange and wonderful fishes can be best<br/>
seen by going to the market, <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>less than five<br/>
hundred and twenty kinds which haunt the coral<br/>
slopes being known. One often offered for sale is<br/>
the ball-fish (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tetredon</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>has the power of<br/>
blowing itself up like <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>balloon and floating on<br/>
the water on its back; this, like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">urchin-fish<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodon</span>), is protected like a hedgehog on land by<br/>
spiny <span style="color: #0000FF;">prickles</span>, beside a beak something like <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>parrot's. They can bite well with their beaks, but<br/>
are not poisonous. Small sharks are occasionally<br/>
heard <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">leaping </span>and flying-fish, and the gay parrot<br/>
and rainbow fishes are also known.<br/>
