<span>Cairo. 59<br/>
<br/>
Du <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nil-12s</span>.; 50 beds; clients mostly German;<br/>
is in a bad neighbourhood, but much frequented by<br/>
artists and others who want to be near the native<br/>
quarters.<br/>
<br/>
All the above hotels have taken some pains about<br/>
sanitary improvements during the last <span style="color: #0000FF;">six </span>years,<br/>
and those which specially desire the English<br/>
custom are now in fairly good order, but some of<br/>
the others retain as yet their old system. In none<br/>
of the above hotels has there been any case of<br/>
enteric fever arising in Cairo itself during the<br/>
season of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1888-0</span>. There are, of course, several<br/>
smaller hotels <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>I have not here mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
Pensions.--<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>these again there are several, two<br/>
of which may be mentioned: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jsinailielt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">13s</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>; 40<br/>
beds; three private sitting-rooms; two general<br/>
sitting-rooms; piano, etc.; baths; <span style="color: #0000FF;">douches</span>; gymnastic apparatus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc</span>.; much frequented by the<br/>
English. Couteret--<span style="color: #0000FF;">10s</span>.; 30 beds.<br/>
<br/>
Lodgings, furnished and unfurnished, can be<br/>
obtained during the season, but they are either<br/>
very expensive or not very good, as all rents are<br/>
very high in Cairo. Moreover, visitors outside a<br/>
hotel may find it <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to have servants who do<br/>
not talk their language easily.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Clnbs.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-There </span>are two excellent clubs, at one of<br/>
which there are some residential chambers for<br/>
temporary members.<br/>
