INTRODUCTION.<br/>
<br/>
THIS handbook is a humble endeavour to answer<br/>
the queries of some of my esteemed medical friends<br/>
in England and in the United States, who tell me<br/>
they are sometimes at a loss to know <span style="color: #0000FF;">what </span>manner<br/>
of patients they ought and ought not to send to<br/>
Egypt. But, apart from the actual needs of<br/>
invalids and their professional advisers, there is<br/>
a large class of visitors who either accompany<br/>
delicate friends abroad, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">flee </span>from their own<br/>
homes merely to escape cold weather and bask in<br/>
the sunshine. It is obvious that <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>health-resort<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>provides a suitable climate for invalids and<br/>
a sufficiency of interest and occupation for healthy<br/>
individuals will become more and more popular.<br/>
The national interest which England has taken in<br/>
Egypt since 1882, the growing prosperity <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
