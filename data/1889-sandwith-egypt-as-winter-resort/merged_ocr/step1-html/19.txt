but to give reasonable information about its climate<br/>
to those who have practically decided against the<br/>
respective merits of sea and mountain air, and<br/>
are in search of pure dry <span style="color: #0000FF;">desert </span>air where min is<br/>
almost unknown, and where fog, strong winds, and<br/>
cold are never felt.<br/>
<br/>
At the outset it must be remembered that where<br/>
the air is extremely dry, there the difference is the<br/>
greatest between the maximum and minimum<br/>
temperatures, for the sun's heat reaches the earth<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">without </span>difficulty by day, and again by night it<br/>
disappears into space. Patients, therefore, can bask<br/>
in Egypt in the temperature of an English summer<br/>
by daylight, but must be prepared for autumnal<br/>
cold after sunset. The summer months in England<br/>
under favourable circumstances are well suited to<br/>
those of feeble constitution, who can surround<br/>
themselves in their own homes with modern<br/>
luxuries, with the comforts which none but the<br/>
English thoroughly study, and with all the pleasures of friends and family. But when the autumn<br/>
cold requires such <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>one to take active outdoor<br/>
exercise, for which he is not <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>robust,<br/>
and when the absence of sunshine induces a depression of spirits in addition to his physical<br/>
delicacy, he begins, if he is wise, to think of<br/>
deserting <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>home comforts and of seeking <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>more cheerful climate like many migratory birds<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
