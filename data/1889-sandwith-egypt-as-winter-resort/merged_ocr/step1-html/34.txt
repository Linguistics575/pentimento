little marl and clay and fragments of Terebratula,<br/>
Ostrea, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pectcn</span>, and Balanus, all considerably later<br/>
than the Eocene period, and tending to show that<br/>
there was once another sea margin 220 feet above<br/>
the Mediterranean and Red Sea. Near the<br/>
Pyramids again are raised beaches, limestone<br/>
pierced by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pholades </span>and Ostrea <span style="color: #ff0000;">mztlulata</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and two<br/>
miles south of the Sphinx are fossil <span style="color: #ff0000;">sea-urchins<br/>
</span>(Clypeaster Egyptiacus), oyster-shells and pectens<br/>
(? Post-Pliocene). The geological map shows<br/>
alluvial deposit everywhere in the Delta and along<br/>
the banks of the Nile, while to both east and west<br/>
of this near Cairo is nummulite limestone, and to<br/>
the north-east of Cairo are sandhills in the desert<br/>
stretching down to the Suez Canal. The incomparably dry pure air of Cairo and Upper Egypt<br/>
is <span style="color: #ff0000;">due </span>to this same nummulite limestone desert,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>for miles and miles acts as a great lung of<br/>
nature and purifies all the air <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>blows across<br/>
it, while the extraordinary fertility of Lower Egypt<br/>
is caused by the alluvial deposit. The absence<br/>
of vegetation and of <span style="color: #ff0000;">moistdirfin </span>the desert has<br/>
left its characters almost unaltered for ages, though<br/>
there is abundant evidence of mountain torrents<br/>
in prehistoric times and in the present day.<br/>
<br/>
Lower Egypt consists geologically, therefore, of(1) Nummulite limestone of the Eocene period,<br/>
stretching southwards in the desert from Cairo<br/>
