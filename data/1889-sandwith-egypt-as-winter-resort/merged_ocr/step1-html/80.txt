China; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chesalpinia </span>Gilliesii of Peru; and the<br/>
sacred tree of Nubia (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ifigiela </span>pinnata). Many of<br/>
the trees have now been labelled, and among them<br/>
may be found the Norfolk Island pine, Indian<br/>
beech, Yucca <span style="color: #0000FF;">gloriosa</span>, twenty different kinds of<br/>
figs, the India <span style="color: #0000FF;">horse-chestnut</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Acacia </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">farnesiana</span>,<br/>
and towering indiarubber trees. Then one sees<br/>
also tropical sedge, oleanders which are bright<br/>
with all colours in April and May, and many<br/>
commoner varieties too numerous to mention.<br/>
Here and there in the garden are solitary giants<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Albizzia </span>lebbek, which was introduced into<br/>
Egypt one hundred and fifty years ago, and, besides<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">making </span>beautiful avenues in Cairo, has now spread<br/>
all over the country. It grows with great rapidity<br/>
and with extraordinary ease, and requires no watering after the first few years. Unfortunately it has<br/>
lately been attacked by the larva of a beetle, and<br/>
some of the oldest trees have died in consequence.<br/>

trees in Egypt are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tamarisk</span>, the sunt (Acacia<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>in the desert at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh </span>and Helouan.<br/>
