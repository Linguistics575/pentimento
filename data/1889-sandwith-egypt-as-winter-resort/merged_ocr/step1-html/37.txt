<span>Cairo. 21<br/>
<br/>
The subsoil of Cairo is washed every year by the<br/>
Nile, which brings to it in the summer the rain<br/>
from the mountains of Abyssinia. In June the<br/>
river at Cairo is at its lowest; then slowly begins<br/>
to rise throughout J uly, and reaches its maximum<br/>
flood in the first ten days of September, remaining<br/>
high during September; and in October attains an<br/>
artificial height, in consequence of the irrigation<br/>
basins in Upper Egypt then allowing the water<br/>
to escape and swirl on to complete the flood <span style="color: #0000FF;">irrigation</span>. During October the water gradually recedes<br/>
from the basins, and is carried all over Lower<br/>
Egypt by an elaborate system of canals, so that<br/>
the early months of the year become gradually<br/>
drier and drier, until the period of low Nile is<br/>
again reached in May.<br/>
<br/>
In the ordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood-tune</span>, there is considerable<br/>
infiltration beneath the river-banks, besides the<br/>
desired inundation for the future crops, so that<br/>
the subsoil water rises in Cairo to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>height of only<br/>
5 ft. from the ground surface, and at low Nile it<br/>
sinks again to about 19 <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>below the surface. We<br/>
may take it that during the Winter season the<br/>
subsoil water is more than 10 ft. from the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Now, although subsoil drainage in England<br/>
would seem to have resulted in an increase in the<br/>
health of the population, and an especial <span style="color: #0000FF;">diminution </span>of phthisis and enteric fever, there is one<br/>
