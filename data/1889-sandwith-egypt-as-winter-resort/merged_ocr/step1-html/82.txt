<span>66 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
The resources of the Nile have not yet been<br/>
developed, and there is but little rowing, sailing,<br/>
fishing, or swimming.<br/>
<br/>
Shooting.---) visitor who wants big game will<br/>
be disappointed in Egypt; but, on the other hand,<br/>
he can get plenty of quail, duck, and snipe. He<br/>
must bring an ordinary breech-loading gun with<br/>
him, but all cartridges must be bought in Cairo,<br/>
one maker having the exclusive monopoly. In<br/>
1889 an English visitor rode down and shot three<br/>
wolves (Canis <span style="color: #ff0000;">mricgatus</span>) beyond the Pyramids,<br/>
but this is a unique experience. Ibex can be<br/>
shot in the mountains near Suez; gazelle are very<br/>
shy everywhere; wild pig can be got in the<br/>
Fayoum and at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Broullos</span>, and lynx near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tel-elEebir</span>; and in the desert there are jackal, <span style="color: #ff0000;">l1yena</span>,<br/>
fox, <span style="color: #0000FF;">bare</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">long-cared </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fennec </span>fox. From<br/>
October to March there is good snipe, duck, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">goose </span>shooting, and from February to May there<br/>
is an abundance of quail. In February, 1889,<br/>
two English visitors made <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>bag of forty duck and<br/>
four hundred snipe in five days at Kafr-el-Sheikh,<br/>
and this is only an instance of what many others<br/>
have done. One hundred and twenty quail have<br/>
been shot by two guns on the road to the Pyramids<br/>
in March, between luncheon and dinner. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pigeonshooting </span>in the villages can be obtained all the<br/>
year round, because pigeons are kept for the sake<br/>
