</span>lowest temperatures are not those of chief interest to the delicate visitor. He should rather<br/>
consult the Table to see the average heat during<br/>
the day out of <span style="color: #0000FF;">doers</span>, and the average cold<br/>
of his bedroom by night. During the three<br/>
months <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>patients are advised to be at<br/>
Luxor rather than at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo-December</span>, January,<br/>
February both the daylight and bedroom temperatures are always above 60°, and generally<br/>
above <span style="color: #ff0000;">63° </span>Fahr. This is the great feature of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Lusor-a </span>dry warmth during the very months<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>it is generally so damp and warm, or damp<br/>
and cold, elsewhere. The increase in the mean<br/>
daylight temperature of February over that of<br/>
January is <span style="color: #ff0000;">el1iefly </span>due to the increase of the daily<br/>
maximum, but slightly also to the increased height<br/>
of the daily minimum temperature. The remarkable uniformity of the bedroom temperature is<br/>
worth noticing, and can be explained as follows.<br/>
The walls, it may be remembered, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>very thick,<br/>
and built of crude bricks, and these, while <span style="color: #0000FF;">absorbing </span>a great deal of heat during the day, keep the<br/>
extreme heat out of the room; but at night, when<br/>
radiation commences, they part with their acquired surplus heat before the bedroom air can<br/>
approach the temperature of the external air. By<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little judicious management, opening windows<br/>
to catch the sun, and shutting them again at<br/>
