HELOUAN is an artificial oasis in the desert, three<br/>
miles from the right bank of the Nile, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen<br/>
</span>miles south of Cairo. The railway connecting it<br/>
with the capital has in 1889 been brought into the<br/>
centre of the town, and various other improvements<br/>
have been made by the company to whom the<br/>
railway now belongs. The trains run to and fro<br/>
in forty minutes, and six times a day. The village<br/>
consists of a palace built by the present Khedive,<br/>
two hotels, about a hundred and fifty detached<br/>
private houses, and two engines for pumping up<br/>
Nile water. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is about 112 feet above the Nile<br/>
level, on a firm plateau of sand, and is famous for<br/>
a remarkably pure, dry, and dustless atmosphere.<br/>
It is surrounded on all sides by the desert, and on<br/>
the east by the continuation of the Mokattam<br/>
range of hills. But the property <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>makes the<br/>
