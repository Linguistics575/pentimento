In November,' between Cairo and Assiout the<br/>
deck temperature varies from <span style="color: #0000FF;">53° </span>at 7 <span style="color: #0000FF;">a.m. </span>to 63°<br/>
at noon and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">580 </span>after sunset, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is also the<br/>
mean of the month. The wind is north to <span style="color: #0000FF;">northeast</span>; there is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little dew at night, and a warmer<br/>
coat is necessary on deck after sunset. The<br/>
saloon temperature of November varies from 55°<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">72°</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>an average of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gf</span>.<br/>

In December, Patterson gives as the result of<br/>
two years' observations (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1860-1-2</span>) a, minimum on<br/>
deck of <span style="color: #ff0000;">47°</span>, a, maximum of <span style="color: #ff0000;">686°</span>, and a mean of<br/>
57°. The range is greater, so that once <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>December 29, the morning observation was <span style="color: #0000FF;">52°</span>,<br/>
and at midday 72°. The saloon temperatures of<br/>
another observer give a minimum of <span style="color: #0000FF;">17°</span>; maximum,<br/>
79°; and mean, 63°; and his results of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ninety-three<br/>

and <span style="color: #ff0000;">dampest </span>in the early morning. Dr. F. S.<br/>
Worthington has also given me some careful daily<br/>
readings for December, 1888, between Cairo and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>few miles to its south. The barometer average<br/>
(corrected for sea-level) was <span style="color: #0000FF;">3019</span>; in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dithebiyeh </span>saloon the average maximum temperature<br/>
