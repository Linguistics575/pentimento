It will be interesting to note what diseases<br/>
visitors to Egypt are <span style="color: #0000FF;">likely </span>to suffer from during<br/>
their stay.<br/>
<br/>
First and most frequent comes Diarrhea, which<br/>
seems to be invariably produced by a chill, such<br/>
as cold after a sunny day, and possibly by neglecting to wear a flannel belt round the waist by day<br/>
or night, which seems to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>good preventive.<br/>
The individual seems to be attacked, as he might<br/>
be in Europe, <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tt </span>cold in the head "-is probably<br/>
fatigued by exertion at the time, and eats an<br/>
ordinary meal afterwards. In the early morning<br/>
he is awakened by mild diarrhoea, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>continues<br/>
two or three days, and readily yields to rest, milk<br/>
diet, gentle aperients, and bismuth. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Less </span>mild<br/>
cases occur in delicate women, which seem to be<br/>
due to congestion of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">iniesiine</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-are </span>associated<br/>
with mild fever for three days, and are cured in<br/>
about <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>week. I have never been able to trace<br/>
any <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>to the drinking-water, and it occurs<br/>
among those who filter, boil, and filter again their<br/>
water. Some strong robust men laugh at flannel<br/>
belts and never wear them, but to weaker vessels<br/>
they are a great comfort and useful preventive of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">catarrh</span>.<br/>
