Savill was travelling from Cairo to Wady Halfa,<br/>
back again almost as far as Cairo, and then once<br/>
more up the river to Luxor. His average maximum<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">808°</span>, and he reached his highest, <span style="color: #ff0000;">95°</span>, one<br/>
day above Luxor. His average minimum was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">55W</span>, and the lowest attained was 45°, there being<br/>
five night-readings below 50°. The average mean<br/>
of the month was <span style="color: #0000FF;">675°</span>. The temperature as<br/>
tested one hour before and one hour after sunset<br/>
showed an average fall of <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Fahr. The wind<br/>
was northerly and light. On two days showers<br/>
fell at Luxor, three other days were partially<br/>
cloudy, but the remainder were sunny all day.<br/>
The humidity ranged from 24 to 80, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">month</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>average was 495 per cent.<br/>
<br/>
For March, Patterson's average is <span style="color: #0000FF;">GG'8°</span>, and<br/>
his maximum only <span style="color: #0000FF;">71'5°</span>, with the record of a<br/>
thunderstorm two days in succession in one year.<br/>
On two days of warm south winds he found the<br/>
temperature differing 21° and <span style="color: #ff0000;">29° </span>between 7 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ann</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>and midday, and the average range of the month<br/>
a little higher than in February. The warmth of<br/>
the Nile water taken at various times and places<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">64°</span>. Dr. Worthington drifted down the Nile<br/>
from Assouan to Assiout in March, 1889, and<br/>
recorded as barometer average, <span style="color: #0000FF;">3021</span>; as maximum<br/>
saloon temperature, 82°; and as minimum average<br/>
of saloon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">614°</span>, and of deck, <span style="color: #0000FF;">555°</span>. The wind was<br/>
