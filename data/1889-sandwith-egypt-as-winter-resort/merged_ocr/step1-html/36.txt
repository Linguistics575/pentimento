<span>20 Egypt as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Winter </span>Resort.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">pendicular </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sepia-eolouved </span>mud-banks, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>vary<br/>
slightly in colour, and have occasional thin layers<br/>
of drifted sand intervening. Wherever there is no<br/>
alluvium, which is of course the only soil in<br/>
Egypt, there is sterile desert, and this is the charm<br/>
of Luxor, and of the suburbs of Cairo. The Nile<br/>
soil is stated to be unlike any other in the world<br/>
in composition.<br/>
<br/>
The Royal Society, with the aid of the Royal<br/>
Engineer Corps stationed at Cairo, has made several<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">borings </span>through this soil to the old <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>of the Delta.<br/>
The mixtures of blown sand and Nile alluvium<br/>
were found to continue down to the depth of<br/>
121 ft. from the surface, and 95 ft. below the level<br/>
of the Mediterranean. At that depth <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>remarkable change in the deposits took place, and beds<br/>
of gravel containing both pebbles and <span style="color: #0000FF;">subangular<br/>
</span>fragments of quartzite, chert, compact limestone,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>some metamorphic and igneous rocks, were<br/>
found, and similar beds occurred at intervals down<br/>
to the greatest depth reached. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Up </span>to the present<br/>
time <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>contemporaneous organic remains have<br/>
been found in these deposits. The borings near<br/>
the Nile at Cairo in 1883 may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">briefly </span>summarized thus: For 6 ft. beneath the surface, dry<br/>
mould; from 7 ft. to 16 ft., dry sandy mould; from<br/>
17 ft. to 38 ft., wet sand; and from 39 ft. to 45 ft.,<br/>
wet coarse sand.<br/>
