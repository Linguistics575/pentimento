<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Luaor-Awouart</span>. 127<br/>
<br/>
moisture only reached 60, while the minimum fell<br/>
to 21 per cent.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rain </span>is indeed rare at Luxor, for there was none<br/>
in November and December, 1881, and this is by<br/>
no means unusual. In January, 1882, there was<br/>
none; but in 1878 there was one shower, and<br/>
another in <span style="color: #0000FF;">January </span>1888. In the month of<br/>
February, 1878, there was a shower, another in<br/>
1882, again in 1887, and three minutes' rain was<br/>
recorded by Dr. Boase in 1888.<br/>
<br/>
In 1878, 1882, and 1888, no rain was noted in<br/>
March. There would thus seem to be only two or<br/>
three days in the year when rain falls at Luxor<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>Thunder and lightning are rarer still.<br/>
<br/>
The amount of cloud is very little in the year,<br/>
but the sky was noted as being completely <span style="color: #0000FF;">overcast </span>four times in <span style="color: #0000FF;">January</span>, once in February, and<br/>
three times in March.<br/>
<br/>
The amount <span style="color: #0000FF;">0 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ozone </span>was estimated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">noting<br/>
</span>the depth of the staining produced in a piece of<br/>
paper prepared with iodide of potassium and<br/>
starch, after it had been exposed to the air in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>double metallic gauze cage. Dr. Maclean pointed<br/>
out that when the barometer stood high, and the<br/>
temperature not great, the largest amounts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ozone<br/>
</span>were present, while little ozone was indicated with<br/>
a low barometer on a hot day.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">wind</span>'s maximum force was 4 in January,<br/>
