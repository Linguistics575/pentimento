English doctor, whose services are seldom required;<br/>
a huge <span style="color: #ff0000;">medicine-chcst</span>; a European manager; and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman</span>, who arranges the details of the sightseeing.<br/>
<br/>
The whole trip from Cairo to Assouan and back<br/>
to Cairo in these steamers takes three weeks; or it<br/>
may be arranged that the traveller shall break his<br/>
journey for a long 01' short time at Luxor <span style="color: #0000FF;">OI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">elsewhere</span>. For those who desire to visit all the<br/>
temples and to devote a longer time to their study,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>special steamer makes the trip in four weeks<br/>
instead of three, and is provided with perfect<br/>
accommodation for <span style="color: #ff0000;">tiventy-five </span>passengers. The<br/>
length of the smallest of these steamers is 160 ft.;<br/>
the breadth, 20 ft.; the horse-power, <span style="color: #ff0000;">27 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>; and the<br/>
usual speed, eleven miles an hour.<br/>
<br/>
But it has been found that there are many who<br/>
cannot afford the time <span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span>' the expense for the three<br/>
weeks' trip, and therefore some cheap express<br/>
steamers have been constructed to ply twice <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>week between Assiout and Assouan, so that tourists<br/>
can go from Cairo <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the First Cataract and back<br/>
in fourteen days for £25, including a stay of four<br/>
days at Luxor; <span style="color: #0000FF;">,4 </span>they may go to Luxor and<br/>
back for £20 in eleven days, four of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>can be<br/>
devoted to seeing Thebes and Karnak. These<br/>
cheaper steamers carry thirty <span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class </span>passengers,<br/>
and are very useful for those invalids who wish to<br/>
<br/>
