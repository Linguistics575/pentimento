subsoil <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>must not be overlooked. For many<br/>
years the resident population has allowed its filth<br/>
to percolate into the porous soil and drain away as<br/>
it pleased till it joined the level of subsoil water,<br/>
and it is easy to conceive that if this earth were<br/>
not periodically cleansed and oxygenated by the<br/>
Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">infiltration</span>, it would have long ceased to have<br/>
any <span style="color: #0000FF;">beneficial </span>properties as a sponge. This cleansing process, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>takes place in September and<br/>
October, has, of course, the disadvantageous effect<br/>
of altering the level, not only of the infiltrated soil<br/>
water, but of the contents of all the uncemented<br/>
cesspools of former and more insanitary days.<br/>
<br/>
It must be borne in mind that the subsoil water<br/>
has a slope of its own equal to that of the Delta,<br/>
viz. 1 in 10,000, and, instead of remaining local, is<br/>
constantly <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowing </span>northwards towards the sea.<br/>
This is easily proved by experiments in this Delia<br/>
or in India.<br/>

years taken from the Greenwich <span style="color: #ff0000;">reESfds </span>tells us<br/>
that there are in England only 1211 hours of bright<br/>
sunshine during the twelve months, or less than<br/>
two hours a <span style="color: #0000FF;">day </span>in the winter. It is unnecessary<br/>
to take a similar observation at Cairo, but Table I.<br/>
shows that we do have clouds during the cold<br/>
months, in spite of an apparently perpetual sun<br/>
