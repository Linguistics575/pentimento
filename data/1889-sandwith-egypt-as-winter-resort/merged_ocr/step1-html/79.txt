<span>Cairo. <span style="color: #0000FF;">63<br/>
<br/>
</span>picturesque garden of twenty and a half <span style="color: #0000FF;">acres </span>by<br/>
the landscape gardener to whom Paris owes the<br/>
Bois de Boulogne. The gardens are <span style="color: #ff0000;">skilfully </span>laid<br/>
out, and, being close to the hotels, are a useful<br/>
resort by day for those who cannot take active<br/>
exercise; but after sunset they are liable to be<br/>
damp, in consequence of the perpetual watering of<br/>
the ground and the presence <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>small lake.<br/>
Grass grows with <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffie11liy </span>in Cairo, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Lippia </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">noditlorro </span>is made to take its place. There<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>good restaurant, which is in great request<br/>
during the summer, when military bands play in<br/>
the gardens after dinner. There are very few<br/>
trees <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>shrubs with which we are familiar in<br/>
English gardens, but ivy may be seen with the<br/>
cactus clinging to stately palms. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Australia </span>has<br/>
furnished the she-oak and the beef-wood tree;<br/>
there are sparmannia from the Cape of Good<br/>
Hope; and from South America, clumps of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cocos<br/>
</span>trees, <span style="color: #0000FF;">silk </span>cotton trees, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1valwothamnus</span>. Among<br/>
the most noticeable trees are the blue flowering<br/>
Jacaranda <span style="color: #0000FF;">mimosifolia</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Erythrina </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cristogalli</span>,<br/>
and the pepper-tree from Brazil; the lovely orangered <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowering</span>, flamboyant (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pointciana </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">veyia</span>) from<br/>
Madagascar, which is now planted in some of the<br/>
Cairo streets; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mossy-cupped </span>oak from Constantinople; the Malabar nut, <span style="color: #ff0000;">frangipanni</span>, red<br/>
bean tree, and pudding-pipe tree from India; the<br/>
