lighted. When there is 110 moon, the star-spangled<br/>
sky is a real treat, for the cloudy nights are few<br/>
and far between, and the flat roofs of the houses<br/>
easily lend themselves to the studies of amateur<br/>
astronomers. Among the stars which can be seen<br/>
in Cairo, but not in the latitudes of London,<br/>
Boston, or Philadelphia, are Canopus and Horologium at the beginning of the year; while the<br/>
Southern Cross shows about two-thirds of its<br/>
height in May and June, though the foot of the<br/>
cross cannot be seen till one goes south of Assouan. Ara and the Centaur are well seen in<br/>
July, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>of the Scorpion shows to perfection; also at the close of the year we have the<br/>
Crane and the Phoenix. The Milky Way is always<br/>
beautiful, and the study of the stars has <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>special<br/>
attraction in a country where one can become<br/>
familiar with the original Arabic names still used<br/>
by all those who have acquired the knowledge of<br/>
the named stars.<br/>
