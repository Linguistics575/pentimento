require special protection on the Nile. (5) The<br/>
interest and relaxation of mind inspired in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>country <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>the remains may be studied of the<br/>
ancient Egyptians, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Persians</span>, Greeks, Romans,<br/>
Arabs, and Turks. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">G</span>) The presence in a perfectly<br/>
oriental city of most available European luxuries,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large and hospitable English society. (7)<br/>
The absence of moribund <span style="color: #0000FF;">phthisical </span>patients, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who<br/>
</span>find Egypt too far from home. (8) The facilities<br/>

The natives have <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>proverb, "He who drinks<br/>
the waters of the Nile invariably returns to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>; "<br/>
and in many instances this has seemed to be true,<br/>
for nearly all strangers develop in a few months<br/>
a great fondness for Cairo, and are grieved to<br/>
leave it; while it can be honestly stated that most<br/>
invalids either improve in health while in Egypt,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>manfully hold their ground during their sojourn<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
The objections to Egypt as a health-resort are:<br/>
(1) Its distance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">six </span>days <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>more from England,<br/>
and of at least three days from the south of Europe,<br/>
so that a sea-voyage is unavoidable. (2) The <span style="color: #0000FF;">expense </span>which naturally attends such a <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey</span>, the<br/>
cost of hotels and pensions in Cairo, and the extra<br/>
cost of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>journey up the Nile. (3) The mosquitoes,<br/>
which welcome young women and children very<br/>
