<span>128 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
3 in February, and only 2 in March. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">duststorms </span>are often troublesome, though not numerous.<br/>
A moderate breeze some four or five times a month<br/>
carries <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>it a great quantity of dust, and this<br/>
becomes more frequent after February.<br/>
<br/>
It should be hardly necessary to say that no<br/>
patients with advanced phthisis ought to be sent<br/>
to winter at Luxor; neither should any of those<br/>
who require to be surrounded With all <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern<br/>
</span>luxuries and the treasures of culinary art. Patients<br/>
with weak hearts and enlarged congested livers<br/>
would be better in Cairo. Some few people who<br/>
cannot, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>not, ride the ass of the country,<br/>
have had themselves carried in litters to see the<br/>
sights of the neighbourhood.<br/>
<br/>
Amusements.- Unlimited donkey-riding and<br/>
sketching are always to be had. The curio-lover<br/>
may collect many authentic and a few manufactured antiquities; the sportsman can get good<br/>
quail and <span style="color: #0000FF;">duck-shooting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>the help of a guide,<br/>
and he may, if he chooses, shoot birds for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>collection, <span style="color: #0000FF;">jackals</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">occasionally </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hywnas</span>. There<br/>
is not much fishing or <span style="color: #0000FF;">beating</span>, but excellent bathing, though the swimmer must be warned that<br/>
the current is often <span style="color: #ff0000;">ssvift-three </span>miles an <span style="color: #0000FF;">hour-</span>.<br/>
and the banks are dangerously precipitate cliffs.<br/>
<br/>
There are good postal and telegraph <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrangements</span>. There are enough local officials to provide<br/>
