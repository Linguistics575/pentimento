<span>40 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
week of the month is often hot, but previous to<br/>
that, during a south wind, the shade temperature<br/>
at <span style="color: #0000FF;">noon </span>is about 80°; indoors it is <span style="color: #ff0000;">64°</span>; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">barometer </span>falls from 30 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">207</span>, and there are <span style="color: #ff0000;">10°<br/>
</span>difference between the wet and dry bulbs. Tourists<br/>
tire of Egypt at the first hot wind, and make for<br/>
Palestine, Constantinople, etc. Snipe, ducks, and<br/>
geese leave for Europe; excellent quail, spur-winged<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">plover</span>, and dove shooting. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dianthus</span>, pansy,<br/>
China aster, marguerites, delphinium, fuchsia,<br/>
gladiolus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lobelia</span>, sweet pea, and wall-flowers.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Acacia </span>trees in the boulevards shed their leaves<br/>
and remain bare for about a month.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">April-The </span>days are warm like the hottest days<br/>
in an English summer, but are not felt so oppressive because of the dryness of the air. The houses<br/>
and habits of the country are also specially adapted<br/>
for the hot weather. Rooms are now occupied<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>face towards the north and catch the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cool<br/>
</span>wind, and on hot days it is wisest not to go out<br/>
immediately after luncheon. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Europeap</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">houses<br/>
</span>and hotels are built so that the rooms are sixteen<br/>
feet high, thus providing for plenty of cubic space<br/>
when the windows are obliged to be closed to keep<br/>
out the heat and the flies and mosquitoes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>now begin to be troublesome. The khamseen wind<br/>
occurs at intervals of about ten days, and great<br/>
care ought to be taken not to <span style="color: #0000FF;">relinquish </span>all winter<br/>
<br/>
