<br/>
</span>not very unlike that of England during a dry summer, I<br/>
see no reason why patients with liver disease should not be<br/>
sent there or up the Nile, though perhaps it would be unwise<br/>
to let them remain after February at Luxor. The ordinary<br/>
individual with cirrhosis or other result of alcoholic tendency,<br/>
improves temporarily while in Egypt, because he finds it<br/>
easier to do without stimulants. The peaceful life on a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabiyeh </span>with agreeable company is sometimes very useful<br/>
in such cases.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, that great and increasing multitude of interesting<br/>
patients, the neurotic, men and women, are without <span style="color: #0000FF;">exception </span>so content in Egypt that they have but little time or<br/>
inclination to consider their complaints.<br/>
