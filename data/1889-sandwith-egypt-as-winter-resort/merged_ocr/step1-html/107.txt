<span>Suburbs of Cairo. Ol<br/>
<br/>
A druggist is provided by the Government, but<br/>
many European visitors prefer to be dependent<br/>
upon Cairo for their doctors and drugs.<br/>
<br/>
There are two hotels, the larger of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is in<br/>
connection with the baths, and has forty-six bedrooms, some of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are very large, also a <span style="color: #ff0000;">lawntennis </span>court. There is easy telephone and telegraph communication with Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
Furnished and unfurnished villas can be hired<br/>
near the Bath Establishment.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Course </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">baths.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>water for the baths has<br/>
a temperature of about 86° Fahr. upon coming out<br/>
of the spring, and this can be <span style="color: #ff0000;">a1stifieially </span>heated to<br/>
102°, or more, in pipes <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>prevent any evaporation of gas. But it is doubtful whether it is ever<br/>
necessary to take the bath above 100°, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>hotter<br/>
baths are generally apt to exhaust the patient.<br/>
The baths are open from 6 <span style="color: #0000FF;">mm</span>. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p.111.</span>, and<br/>
may be taken as it suits the convenience of the<br/>
patient-say one hour before meals, or three or<br/>
four hours after meals. There can be no object<br/>
in taking more than one bath in the day, though<br/>
robust men who are in <span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>hurry to get through their<br/>
course can easily stand an occasional second bath<br/>
in the twenty-four hours. The beginner should<br/>
not stay in the water longer than fifteen minutes,<br/>
but he may gradually increase this to thirty<br/>
minutes. If he is not under medical supervision<br/>
