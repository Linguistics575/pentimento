For hotels, there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty-two </span>bedrooms at San<br/>
Stefano, a highly commended Beau Sejour, and two<br/>

excellent <span style="color: #0000FF;">swimming-baths </span>for both sexes, <span style="color: #ff0000;">electriclighting</span>, a European string-band, weekly afternoon<br/>
dances for children, evening parties for adults,<br/>
etc. The height of the season is from June 15<br/>

Church of Scotland, German and French <span style="color: #0000FF;">Protestant</span>, Roman Catholic, and many other places of<br/>
worship.<br/>

The conservancy arrangements are of too primitive a character. Many English houses are provided with earth-closets; the rest have <span style="color: #0000FF;">cesspools<br/>
</span>draining away into the porous sand. Up till now<br/>
