in whom <span style="color: #0000FF;">phthisis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>suspected goes or is taken by his relatives<br/>
to a doctor to have his chest examined, it may generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span>prophesied either that there is no ground for uneasiness, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>that the disease has already made distinct progress. Incipient<br/>
cases which gain weight and improve in <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>respects<br/>
during a winter abroad, often need to be reminded that the<br/>
measure should be repeated <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>second time.<br/>
<br/>
Popular young patients must often be banished from Cairo<br/>
during December and January, to desert life at the Pyramids,<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lusor</span>, to protect them from themselves and their<br/>
acquaintance, and the snares of evening engagements.<br/>
<br/>
Chronic cases of undoubted phthisis do <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>well in Egypt,<br/>
for they improve in general health, digestion, and appetite,<br/>
and can often take <span style="color: #0000FF;">cod-liver </span>oil, which was previously <span style="color: #0000FF;">impossible</span>. They are encouraged by finding that they gain a<br/>
little weight, and become rid of troublesome cough and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">expeetoration</span>. This last symptom is an important one in<br/>
Egypt, and one of the first signs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">patient</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>improvement.<br/>
<br/>
An ordinary <span style="color: #ff0000;">phthisieal </span>individual complains, when he <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>reaches Cairo, of cough and <span style="color: #0000FF;">expectoration</span>, and the stethoscope<br/>
reveals a multitude of large and small moist sounds. When<br/>
he is seen again a fortnight later, these sounds have partly<br/>
disappeared, he still coughs, but is surprised and sometimes<br/>
alarmed to notice that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">expeetoration </span>has suddenly<br/>
diminished. After another week or two, he reports that he<br/>
only <span style="color: #0000FF;">expectorates </span>the first thing in the morning; he seldom<br/>
coughs during the day, and the stethoscope again <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirms<br/>
</span>the drying-up process which is going on in the lung, which<br/>
seems to be the direct result of dry air inhaled. This is not<br/>
so wonderful <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>we remember that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>average winter<br/>
humidity of the Cairo <span style="color: #0000FF;">air </span>is under sixty-six per cent. (Table<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>), while that of London is above ninety per cent. It would<br/>
be <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span>to know whether the very dry air is inimical<br/>
to the life and development of the tubercle bacillus. Two<br/>
cases in which bacilli were <span style="color: #ff0000;">soon </span>in London and on arrival<br/>
in Cairo, and could not be found before leaving Cairo and<br/>
<br/>
