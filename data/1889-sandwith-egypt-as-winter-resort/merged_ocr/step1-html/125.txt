The voyage up the Nile was formerly reserved<br/>
for the richest English and Americans, but I have<br/>
shown that it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>made easy for any one who<br/>
wishes to spend Â£100 in pursuit of health or<br/>
pleasure. There are many who are not <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently<br/>
</span>gregarious to <span style="color: #0000FF;">wish </span>to make a <span style="color: #ff0000;">pleasure-hip </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">With </span>a<br/>
number of strangers, and to see the sights at<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>time and within a fixed period, and, moreover, have not to consider the economy of time or<br/>
money. To them the peaceful life of <span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>dahabiyeh<br/>
has many attractions: their party is complete in<br/>
itself<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>they have a supply of books, <span style="color: #ff0000;">sketchingmaterials</span>, shooting necessaries and patience; and<br/>
a dragoman who will procure for them every day <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>fresh <span style="color: #0000FF;">supply </span>of milk, meat, vegetables, fruit,<br/>
poultry, and eggs. They will be dependent on<br/>
their cook for bread, and on various tins for butter,<br/>
jam, bacon, biscuits, etc. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Theyhad </span>better provide<br/>
their own wine, curtains for <span style="color: #ff0000;">draughty </span>windows,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">& </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ck-c11ai1s </span>They may either start in their<br/>
