dahabiyeh from Cairo, or send it up to Rodah or<br/>
Assiout and there join it by train, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or</span>, best of all,<br/>
engage <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>steamer to tow them at least as far as<br/>
Assiout. This is a very delightful way of travelling,<br/>
but the number of tow steamers is limited, and the<br/>
price often prohibitive. The ordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabiyeh</span>,<br/>
in going up stream against a current of three miles<br/>
an hour, is quite dependent on wind. Fortunately<br/>
the prevailing wind is from the north, the sails<br/>
are large, and the crew are clever to take all<br/>
advantage of it. It will take about two months to<br/>
get to the First Cataract and back, and three<br/>
months to go from Cairo to the Second Cataract<br/>
and back, and the cost for a party of four is about<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">invents-five </span>shillings <span style="color: #0000FF;">per </span>head per day.<br/>
<br/>
There ought to be no mosquitoes <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the Nile, or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>biting insects, but flies are often a great<br/>
trouble, and require Whisks, papers, and traps. It<br/>
is very cold at night, and ulsters, rugs, and other<br/>
warm wraps are necessary.<br/>

Temperature and climate on the Nile in <span style="color: #0000FF;">winter.-Dr. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Patterson</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>gives an analysis for October, of<br/>
six daily observations during a voyage from Cairo<br/>
to Luxor and back. The thermometer varied from<br/>
68° at 7 <span style="color: #0000FF;">a.m. </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">826° </span>at 3 p.m., the total mean<br/>
of the month being 76° <span style="color: #0000FF;">Falun</span>, and no rain fell<br/>
during the time.<br/>
