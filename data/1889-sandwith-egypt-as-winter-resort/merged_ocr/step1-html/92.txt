<span>76 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
train; or delicate people who wish to minimize the<br/>
fatigue may sleep at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helouan </span>overnight, and cross<br/>
the river next morning. Those who love riding<br/>
can mount their ponies at Mena Hotel, and ride<br/>
along the desert to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkfrah</span>, passing the Pyramids of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abooseer </span>and the remains of several miles<br/>
of cemeteries. The day's excursion is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>very<br/>
delightful one, but it is very tiring to those unaccustomed to donkey-riding. Early in the winter the<br/>
scenery is quite lovely-the inundation covering<br/>
the fields, and the peasants swarming up the lofty<br/>
date palms to gather the fruit which grows so well<br/>
on the site of Memphis. In the spring the waters<br/>
have subsided again, and the mounds and pottery<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>represent the old city, can be better seen.<br/>

A huge fallen statue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span>II. was raised<br/>
out of a pond by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few English subscribers <span style="color: #ff0000;">in<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1887</span>, and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">working </span>at it another colossus was<br/>
<br/>
discovered close by. It is not generally known that<br/>
. the Egyptian antiquities on Shepheard's balcony<br/>
came from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakk√©rah</span>, and bear evidence of having<br/>
been visited in <span style="color: #0000FF;">situ </span>by Greek tourists, who scribbled<br/>
their names in the days long ago before the stones<br/>
were buried in sand, and then once more discovered by Mariette. Boulak and many European<br/>
museums have been largely enriched by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">treasures </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkeimh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>represents about four<br/>
square miles of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis </span>of Memphis. The<br/>
