<br/>
hottest months of the year,<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>diarrhoea being the<br/>
most common <span style="color: #ff0000;">eertified </span>cause of death. Those<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">unaoquainted </span>with the lowest <span style="color: #0000FF;">class </span>of Egyptians<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span>form no idea of the filth in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they voluntarily live, of the habits of the nursing mothers,<br/>
and of their indifference to medical aid until the<br/>
child is actually dead. The apathy of the people<br/>
on this subject is perhaps partly due to the extraordinarily high birth-rate among the natives. The<br/>
average <span style="color: #0000FF;">birth-vate </span>in Cairo during the last six<br/>
years is <span style="color: #0000FF;">518</span>, and that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">485 </span>per<br/>
1000. During 1887 the highest <span style="color: #0000FF;">birth-rate </span>recorded<br/>
per 1000 among ninety-five other towns publishing<br/>
vital statistics were-Dusseldorf, 39'1; Buenos<br/>
Ayres, 39'7; Chemnitz, <span style="color: #ff0000;">44'8</span>'. while the figures for<br/>
Egyptian towns <span style="color: #0000FF;">were-Sues </span>and Ismailia, <span style="color: #0000FF;">54'2</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>Cairo, 55'4; Alexandria, 57'9; and Port Said,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">73</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">7</span>. It is melancholy to <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflect </span>that one-third<br/>
of the native children die before they have lived<br/>
twelve months, and more than one-half of them<br/>
die before they have reached the age of five <span style="color: #0000FF;">years<br/>
</span>It is doubtful whether this extraordinary fecundity<br/>
extends itself to European residents in Egypt,<br/>
whose habits and laws of divorce are, of course,<br/>
entirely different. During my own residence in<br/>
Cairo, I have known <span style="color: #ff0000;">thiriiy-five </span>English brides<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>20-35) who have been imported into Egypt; of<br/>
these <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-seven </span>have borne one or more chil<br/>
