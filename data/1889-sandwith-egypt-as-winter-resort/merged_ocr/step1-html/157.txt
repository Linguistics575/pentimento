</span>from Heliopolis did indeed mark the site of the<br/>
Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>honours were paid to dead and<br/>
living Caesars, and where to-day the British consul<br/>
has his modern house; but, as every one knows,<br/>
they were carried away to lose their hieroglyphics<br/>
in the ungenial climates of London and New York.<br/>
The very tomb of the great Alexander is lost to us,<br/>
and has almost inspired Dr. Schliemann to a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">search-expedition </span>for the mausoleum of the Ptolemies. Pompey's Pillar, as it is erroneously called,<br/>
is only interesting to us because it is the sole relic<br/>
of the city where Antony wooed Cleopatra, and of<br/>
the time when <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>was the commercial<br/>
centre of the world, and Egypt was the principal<br/>
granary of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home</span>.<br/>
<br/>
There are now only about fifteen cisterns in the<br/>
town, though in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1860 </span>there were ten times that<br/>
number to be seen. This is only an illustration of<br/>
the destruction which has visited the city under<br/>
Arab, Turkish, and Egyptian rulers. These cisterns<br/>
are large, built under the houses, arched, and<br/>
coated <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>plaster.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Next </span>in interest are the Catacombs, <span style="color: #ff0000;">01</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>remains<br/>
of the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis</span>, once upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>time surrounded by vineyards and gardens. They are cut<br/>
in the calcareous rock facing the sea, between<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gaharri </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mes</span>, and an early Christian church,<br/>
best visited by boat, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>out of the rock at<br/>
<br/>
