<br/>
</span>ALEXANDRIA once possessed a great reputation for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">salubrity</span>, and was much recommended by the<br/>
ancient physicians for diseases of the chest. But<br/>
the modern city is no favourite with invalids, and<br/>
tourists, obliged to use it as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>port of entry, hurry<br/>
on to Cairo because they can find nothing of sightseeing to detain them. During the early months<br/>
of the year Alexandria is subject to rain, gales,<br/>
and cold, but in April the weather is often <span style="color: #0000FF;">pleasant</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>than in Cairo, and it is at this time that <span style="color: #0000FF;">invalids<br/>
</span>for whom Europe is not yet warm enough are<br/>
recommended to stay, not in Alexandria itself, but<br/>
in the suburb of Ramleh near by. They will find<br/>
refreshing sea-breezes, instead of the liability to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">khamseen </span>wind in Cairo, a temperature <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is<br/>
not too high, and a degree of humidity <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is<br/>
not excessive. The days are bright and sunny,<br/>
and the nights not too cold. In the town of<br/>
Alexandria there are two <span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class </span>hotels, several<br/>
