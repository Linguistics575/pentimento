breeze blows again for a week <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>ten days, and<br/>
then the khamseen may again appear.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Russegger </span>is quoted as having proved that <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>quantity of free electricity is found in the air<br/>
during a <span style="color: #0000FF;">khamseen</span>, at first negative, afterwards<br/>
positive, and then rapidly changing from one to the<br/>
other. This question is worthy of study, for no<br/>
intelligent man can undergo the odd experience of<br/>
this wind without being certain that some unusual<br/>
electrical disturbance is taking place.<br/>
<br/>
The consideration of the effect of this disturbance<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>invalids is very important, and it may at<br/>
once <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>said that they do not seem to suffer more<br/>
than the rest of the Europeans, and even in many<br/>
cases suffer less, because, unlike their more robust<br/>
associates, they are not suddenly <span style="color: #0000FF;">debari'ed </span>by the<br/>
rapid rise of thermometer from taking active <span style="color: #0000FF;">exercise</span>. The fall of temperature at the end of three<br/>
days' dry heat is apt to be more dangerous to<br/>
imprudent people than the heat itself, for in March<br/>
there may be upon these days <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fall of 30° <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fahr</span>.<br/>
at sunset. The general effects of the khamseen<br/>
are a little excitement and stimulation of the<br/>
system, a more rapid succession of ideas and<br/>
increased action of some of the functions, followed<br/>
by listlessness, headache, and languor. Some<br/>
warmth-loving Europeans actually luxuriate in a<br/>
mild <span style="color: #0000FF;">khamseen</span>; but all others are seriously incon<br/>
