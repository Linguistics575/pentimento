<span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfide1Uly </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">looped </span>that money may at once be<br/>
found for carrying out these reforms.<br/>
<br/>
Until then individuals must continue to protect<br/>
themselves by cutting off all communication with<br/>
the ground, and by carefully trapping and ventilating all pipes.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, all <span style="color: #0000FF;">street-sewers </span>have been<br/>
blocked and destroyed, because they are unnecessary for storm water, and because it was found<br/>
that house proprietors used them as overflows for<br/>
their cesspools, and thus vitiated the fresh air of<br/>
the streets. At the same time some <span style="color: #ff0000;">gaspipes</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>were too small, made of <span style="color: #0000FF;">zinc</span>, and allowed leakage<br/>
in the surrounding earth, and consequent odour,<br/>
have been removed, and replaced by <span style="color: #0000FF;">six-inch </span>iron<br/>
pipes, which are a great improvement. All <span style="color: #0000FF;">cesspools </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>now prevented from draining into the<br/>
Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>canals, and are obliged to be emptied at<br/>
least every six months, those of the cemented type<br/>
of course requiring to be emptied much oftener.<br/>
The sewage is taken in patent shut carts to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh </span>desert by night, at the rate of over 30,000<br/>
tons a year. There it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">deodorized </span>and sifted, and<br/>
sold to the fellaheen as "<span style="color: #ff0000;">poudrette</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">£2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>ton<br/>
for use on their lands. These changes, though not<br/>
nearly radical enough, have already contributed<br/>
greatly to the comfort and health of the European<br/>
inhabitants.<br/>
