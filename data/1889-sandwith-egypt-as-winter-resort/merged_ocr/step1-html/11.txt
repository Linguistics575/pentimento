<span>PREFACE.<br/>

</span>THOUGH much has been written about Egypt of<br/>
late years, nothing especially for the guidance of<br/>
invalids has appeared in the form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>handbook<br/>
since 1867. The climate remains as it was then,<br/>
but many of the surroundings are changed and<br/>
improved, so that patients need no longer fear<br/>
absence of civilization <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>undue <span style="color: #0000FF;">expense </span>I have<br/>
tried to avoid writing a guide-book, and to supply<br/>
only that information <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>cannot be found in<br/>
them. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baedelrer</span>'s Guide-book is the best for Cairo<br/>
and the Delta, but unfortunately has not been<br/>
extended to Upper Egypt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Murray</span>'s Handbook was<br/>
last published in 1888, but does not contain too<br/>
much recent information, and Messrs. Cook have<br/>
<br/>
provided for their clients a very useful elementary<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
