<span style="color: #0000FF;">Water-supply.</span>--<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>) Egyptian towns get their<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">drinking-water </span>direct from the Nile, or indirectly<br/>
from the canals fed by the Nile. The Cairo Water<br/>
Company, which has a complete monopoly for<br/>
many years, has lately, under pressure from the<br/>
Sanitary Department, made some important <span style="color: #0000FF;">improvements </span>in the supply. The intake is <span style="color: #ff0000;">now</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>from the Nile itself, but used to be from a canal,<br/>
which during the summer months was liable to<br/>
become stagnant; it has been proposed to remove<br/>
the intake some four miles higher up the river,<br/>
above all source of contamination. The water is<br/>
pumped to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">filter-beds </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh</span>, whence,<br/>
after <span style="color: #0000FF;">filtration</span>, it returns to the town for <span style="color: #0000FF;">consumption</span>; all the European quarters are now supplied with filtered water, the daily average being<br/>
about <span style="color: #ff0000;">26,000 </span>cubic metres. The velocity of the river<br/>
at high Nile is about five feet <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>second, or nearly<br/>
three and <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>half miles an hour; but at low Nile,<br/>
the velocity is reduced to at least one-fifth of this.<br/>
The filter-beds are on raised ground in the<br/>
desert, and consist, in the first place, of two huge<br/>
tanks, into which the water is always <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowing</span>;<br/>
from these it is admitted into eight filter-beds,<br/>
