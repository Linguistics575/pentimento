<span>142 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ooma-ka-bebi</span>. Antiquarians may be interested,<br/>
too, in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortified </span>Greek church, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the English<br/>
residents used to be escorted by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Janissary for<br/>
Protestant services so late as 1840, before the<br/>
English church was built. Fort Pharos, on the<br/>
site of one of the seven wonders of the world, and<br/>
other forts still show traces of their bombardment<br/>
in 1882. Visitors are taken to see the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive's<br/>
</span>yacht Mahroussa, his palace at Ras-el-Teen, the<br/>
view from the lighthouse, and from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">signalstation </span>on Fort Napoleon, and to the drive and<br/>
gardens on the Mahmoudieh Canal, where an<br/>
Egyptian band plays twice a week. In Ramleh<br/>
itself there are the tt spouting rocks," where the sea<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rushes </span>through some openings which have been<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">artificially </span>enlarged, and near by are palm groves<br/>
and curious sand-heaps (<span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tumuli</span>). In 1889, a<br/>
Roman tomb with coloured stucco interior was discovered, close to some catacombs on the sea-shore.<br/>
These tombs are of pagan <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers</span>, probably from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Casar</span>'s camp, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was standing twenty years<br/>
ago, and demolished to build a palace, now in<br/>
its turn abandoned. Here was Nicopolis, where<br/>
Augustus defeated Antony, and where Sir Ralph<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Abercromby </span>died while beating the French under<br/>
General Menou in 1801.<br/>
<br/>
The only expeditions in the neighbourhood are<br/>
to Rosetta, which is now almost deserted, and to<br/>
<br/>
