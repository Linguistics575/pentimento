</span>rather rare, and the papyrus is no longer a native<br/>
of Egypt. Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Schweinfurth </span>believes that the<br/>
Egyptian oases were colonized by Berbers with<br/>
the cereals of the Mediterranean basin, but that<br/>
the valley of the Nile was colonized by Indian<br/>
races who brought their own cereals.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Amusernentsc-Caho </span>with its bright clear weather,<br/>
lends itself so easily to an outdoor life that no<br/>
one will be surprised to hear that the English<br/>
colony has introduced some British sports<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>we<br/>
cross the Nile by its iron bridge, we at once come<br/>
to a large park between the river and one of its<br/>
branches. Here there are about fifty acres of<br/>
grass belonging to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>Sporting Club,<br/>
and devoted to polo, cricket, football, golf, <span style="color: #ff0000;">lawntennis</span>, pigeon-shooting, etc. There is a course for<br/>
riding and for leaping, and every winter there are<br/>
two race meetings of two days each, three Skye<br/>
meetings, and sis or seven <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gymkhanas</span>. Visitors<br/>
may become temporary members of the club on<br/>
paying <span style="color: #ff0000;">Â£2</span>. A regimental band plays most <span style="color: #0000FF;">afternoons</span>, and it is naturally the most favourite resort<br/>
in Cairo. Our foreign friends sometimes play<br/>
lawn-tennis, but usually <span style="color: #0000FF;">confine </span>themselves to<br/>
looking on at the English. There are half a dozen<br/>
lawn-tennis courts in the town, facilities for <span style="color: #0000FF;">boxing<br/>
</span>and fencing, and excellent hacks for riding <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>driving all over the country.<br/>
