The water, before being drunk in Cairo, is
passed through large earthenware jars, which are
found in every house, and constitute an excellent
filter, removing every trace of colour and cloudiness and all deposit, after the water has been

it is kept deliciously cool, and gains an agreeable
taste. Charcoal filters and boiling are not necessary, but there is no difficulty about carrying this
out, if desired.
