undergone concentration by evaporation, besides
having washed the lower strata, from which it
extracts chlorine.

As a conﬁrmation of this, we see that the
chlorine is at its maximum just before the annual
ﬂood.

The deﬁciency of nitrates is interesting, but does
not necessarily show an absence of deﬁlement. The
softness of the water makes it very agreeable for
all domestic purposes ; the slight variation in hard-
ness is due to carbonate of lime, through which
the river has cut its way. The analyses of 1888—9
showed a trace of iron, but of no poisonous metals,
and no nitrites, and IIeisch’s sewage test never
gave the slightest evidence of sewage contamina-
tion.

The unﬁltered water should never be drunk by
visitors 01' residents, though the natives prefer it
inﬁnitely. Some imprudent tourists drink it from
the dirty porous jars of the villagers, and must not
wonder at suﬁ‘ering occasionally in consequence.

The suspended matter, which is the chief ferti-
lizing ingredient of the Nile, varies in quantity in
the most wonderful way. Mr. Pollard’s ﬁgures
vary from '9 in July, to 161'8 in September,
while Dr. Letheby found 8'3 in May, 1875, and
1044 grains in August, 1874. The fertility of the
ﬂood, besides the clay, is due to the organic matter,
