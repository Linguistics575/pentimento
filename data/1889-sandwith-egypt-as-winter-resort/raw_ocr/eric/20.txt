whom he would do well to imitate. Judged by the

reasons widely different. The Royal Observatory
at Greenwich supplies us with a daily average tem-

Roughly speaking, those ﬂeeing from cold must
leave England not later than the middle of October,
and should not return there till at least the end

at Cairo and Luxor, though invalids occasionally
