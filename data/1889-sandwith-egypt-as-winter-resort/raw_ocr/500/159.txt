Aboukir, where the lake is now being drained, and
there are forts connected by torpedoes with the
bay in which Nelson fought the Battle of the Nile,
and his opponent/s "boy stood on the burning
deck, whence all but he had fled." Near Aboukir
are the remains of Canopus, with granite columns
lying about, and whence, in 1888, the statue of
Bameses II. was transferred to the Boulak
Museum.

Table VII. has been compiled from statistics kindly
furnished me by M. A. Pirona, of Alexandria, and
is based upon his meteorological observations of
the nineteen years, 1870-8S, for the Central Me-
teorological Institute of Vienna. His instruments
were made in Vienna, and 1-ectified at the Royal
Observatory there. The readings of the barometer
are at freezing-point, sixty-two feet above sea-level,
and were taken at 9 a.m., 3 pmr, and f) pnn. The
mean temperatures are based on records at 0 ann.,
o p.m., maxima and minima, and coincide with some
observations made in 1817-40. It will be noticed
that the prevailing wind is always straight from
the Mediterranean. The number of rainy days in
March is 4'5 ; in the month of April, only L5 ; and
in May the average further falls to OO'.

These are the three months when Bamleh is at
its best, and can be safely recommended to those
on their way from Cairo to Europe.
