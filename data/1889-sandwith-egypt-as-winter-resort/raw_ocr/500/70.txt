solved and suspended in it. I should add that a
very laudatory report on the Cairo Company’s

the National Agricultural Institute of Paris.

The following is an analysis of the solids in

The water, before being drunk in Cairo, is
passed through large earthenware jars, Which are
found in every house, and constitute an excellent

allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. Drinking-
water is further poured into porous vessels, where
it is kept deliciously cool, and gains an agreeable
taste. Charcoal filters and boiling are not neces-
sary, but there is no difficulty about carrying this
out, if desired.
