There are two other sulphur springs, less warm
and containing, much more salt, but they are not
being used at present. The sulphur waters
resemble those of Aix-les/Bains and Enghien
(Paris).

2. There are two Iron springs, the water of
which is pleasant to drink and is taken gratis by
large numbers of people. The bicarbonate of iron
in the water comes from the protoxide of iron in
the sand. The sand, which in the spring is black,
takes a, yellowish-grey colour when dried in the
air, the protoxide being turned into sesquioxide
of iron. The water- is clear, colourless, odourless,
and tastes a little salt and bitter. Temperature,
77Â° Fahr.; speeifie gravity, L0445. It does not
leave a deposit of carbonate of iron when exposed
to the air.
