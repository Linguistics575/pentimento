KHEDIVIAL LIBRARY

The Khedivial Library is situated in the Sharia Mohammed
Ali, on the left-hand side going towards the Citadel, about
ﬁfteen minutes’ walk from the Post Ofﬁce. Tramways also
pass the door. It was founded by the late Khedive Ismail
Pacha, and removed in 1904 from somewhat unsuitable
quarters in the Darb-el-Gamamiz to the ﬁne building which
it now occupies. It is open in winter every day except
Fridays and Mohammedan holidays from 8 A.M. till one
hour before sunset.

Admission is free, but to enter the reading-room and news-
paper-room a card is required, which is obtained free on
application to one of the attendants.

There are over sixty-six thousand volumes in the library.
Half of these are in Eur0pean languages and deal with various
subjects—history, geography, and the different sciences ;
the other half consists of books in Oriental languages. There
are more than thirteen thousand Arabic manuscripts.

In a wing of the building especially set apart for them is
a very ﬁne exhibition of illuminated Korans, dating for the
most part from the ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries. This
collection numbers seven hundred in all, and is the ﬁnest in
existence.

Among the other treasures may be mentioned: Papyri
from the ﬁrst century of the Hegira, i.e., 622—719 A.D. ; a
copy of the Koran from the Mosque El-Amr. written about
725 A.D. ; two very large coPies, one of which belonged to
the Sultan Khish Kadam (1461-1467 A.D.) and the other to
the Emir Kait Bey (1468-1495 A.D.), the latter measuring
43% in. by 35 in. ; some Persian MSS. of the ﬁfteenth century,
with old Persian bindings ; and an Indian album containing
thirty-four miniatures of great beauty. To these may be
