EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

Water is a forest of masts—“ ferry-boats,” as the Anglo-
Egvptian styles all passenger ships to and from Europe——
trading steamers of many lines, colliers near the great active
coal-hoists, and little sailing-boats cruising up and down the
harbour.

Certain steamship lines have made arrangements with the
Railway Administration whereby in winter special trains
meet their boats on the quay, and carry passengers direct to
Cairo. Passengers by other lines have to fend for them-
selves. Information on this point can best be obtained from
the steamship companies themselves. The Custom House
is on the quavs, and there are always plenty of cabs. The
drive to the station takes about half an hour, ﬁrst through
narrow native streets, then into the wide Place Mohammed Alv
and up Rue Cherif Pacha—a ﬁne modern street—thence past
the big police station into the railway terminus. The cab
fare is 5 pt. For those who wish to pass a few hours, or even
a night, in Alexandria there are the Khedivial, Windsor, and
Savoy Hotels. all three of which are good. One can go to
see Pompey’s Pillar, or else drive out to Ramleh in the after-
noon. A fuller description of Alexandria is given in Chapter
VII. .

The journey to Cairo, 130 miles, by express, takes from
three to three and a half hours, according to the class of train.

The journey from Alexandria to Cairo does not possess
anv great features of interest; the country, once one has
left the rather desolate Lake Mariout, is characteristic of
the Delta—canals, crops, and camels. Damanhour. stand-

Kafr Zayat, a cotton centre, Tantah, the third largest town
in Egypt. but not otherwise of much interest, and Benha,
are the only four places worth mentioning on the route.

Tantah, where all the trains stop, has one merit on a warm
day, in that boys rush up and down the platform and oﬁer
