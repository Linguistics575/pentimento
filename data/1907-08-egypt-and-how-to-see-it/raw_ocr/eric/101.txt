catalogued on the walls. The other was called the room of
puriﬁcation. This rite was similar to Christian baptism,
and consisted in aspersions of holy water. There is a picture
of the king being puriﬁed by Horus and Thoth.

The ﬁnest and most delicately conceived relief is that on
the north wall of the hall above the door ; it depicts a solar
disc and a winged scarabeus in a boat, with two hawk-headed
ﬁgures of Horus. The hypostyle is supported by twelve
pillars with ﬂoral capitals and rich decoration.

The walls of the temple are beautifully painted; every-
where are ﬁgures of Horus and Hathor. The most important
is the west wall, on which is the textual and pictorial descrip-
tion of the battles of Horus. His foes have crocodile and
hippopotamus heads. With Horus are associated the king
and Isis. In the ﬁrst relief the king and Horus are each
slaying a hippopotamus with javelins.
