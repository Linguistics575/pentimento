CAIRO

the King of Egypt, Khoufou, Giver of Life, hath found the
temple of Isis. Queen of the Pyramid. Near to the temple
of the Sphinx to the north-west of the temple of Osiris, Lord
of the Tomb. He hath built his Pyramid hard by the temple
of the Goddess, and he hath built the Pyramid of his royal
daughter Honitsen near unto this temple. This he hath
done to the glory of his mother Isis, Divine Mother, to the
glory of Hathor, Lady of the waters which come from the
ﬁrmament. He hath renewed her glory, and hath rebuilded
her sanctuary in stone. He dwelleth with them in his temple.”

We see the Sphinx now defaced and mutilated, though
Arab writers speak of its once strangely beautiful features.
A suggestion this that perhaps it is the sole survivor of a
more ancient civilisation still, far beyond our ken; for the
Egyptian craftsmen whom we know, did not aim at beauty
in itself : tied by convention, the keynote of their work was
grandeur—immensity that disdained proportion. And yet,
there, close to their most ancient monuments, is that ﬁgure
perfect in proportion, form, and line, and once in beauty a
deeper, more mystical symbol than their most cunning
gravings, more real in life than their most immense statues.

The granite temple a short distance south-east of the
Sphinx is known as the“ Temple of the Sphinx,” and is said
to have been the sanctuary of Sokaris Osiris: it is of con-
siderable interest. Ancient as they are, the huge slabs of
granite of which it is built are so beautifully surfaced and
ﬁtted that many of the joints even to-day are hardly pcr-
ceptible.

But to return to the Pyramids themselves, and such facts
as concern them: there are three—the Great Pyramid of
CheOps, the second Pyramid of Khephren, and the third,
far smaller, of Mycerinus or- Menkauru. They are all attri-
buted to the fourth dynasty.

The height of the Great Pyramid is 451 ft. (formerly 482),
its sides are 750 ft. long at the base (formerly 768). and it
covers an area of about thirteen acres. The second Pyramid
is 447 ft. high, and the third only 203 ft.

The Pyramids seem to have been commenced with a
nucleus of rock around which were built huge stone steps
which were ﬁnally ﬁlled in with smooth polished stones.
The outer casing has been wholly removed at various periods,
and only a fragment of it remains on the second Pyramid.
