AMUSEMENTS

One need never be dull in the evening. Every night
there is sure to be some kind of entertainment at one or the
other of _the hotels—dances, fancy-dress balls, cotillions, and
concerts.

There are regular weekly dances —on Saturday at the
Savoy, Thursday at Ghezireh Palace, and Monday at Shep-
heard’s. Mena House and the Helouan hotels give dances
from time to time, and also, once or twice in the season,

a gymkhana.
MUSIC

As far as music is concerned, a musical society for
quartette and chamber music in general is being founded
by a large and inﬂuential section of the more musical members
of the community. Hitherto the Cercle Artistique (Sharia-
el-Madabergh) gave almost the only concerts in Cairo, but every
one now realises that it is high time to devote more attention
to these things.

The Khedivial Opera House is a ﬁne theatre situated in
the centre of the town. It is under a committee of manage-
ment, who engage a company for the whole winter. Many
well-known operas are given. It is somewhat difﬁcult, how-
ever, to secure seats, as nearly all the boxes and stalls are
held for the season by abonnés.

The new Abbas Theatre is most enterprising, and has met
with well-deserved success since it started a short time ago.
