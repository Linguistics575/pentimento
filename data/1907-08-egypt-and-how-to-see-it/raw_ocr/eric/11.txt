In the desert, ’l‘el-cl-Kebir

CHAPTER I
GENERAL INFORMATION

THE best months for Egypt are from October to May. The
weather is delightful all through, save for a very few days.
In the worst years, indeed, one may possibly count ten days
that are not quite perfect, but a few showers, one or two
days of rain, and perhaps one day of rather hot wind and
dust in April are all one need expect. The rest is sunshine
and warmth such as even the Riviera cannot afford.

Of routes there is a very wide choice: one can go by long
sea, which takes from twelve to ﬁfteen days and is certainly
cheapest, or one may go from Marseilles, Genoa, Naples,
Venice, Trieste, Brindisi, or Constantinople. The shortest
route is, of course, via, Brindisi, and takes four and a half
days. Full particulars are given on page 202.

It is as well to secure a passage early, as, especially in the
late autumn, the boats may be crowded. One may note here
that it is almost always possible to secure a-.place in the
P. 85 O. Brindisi Mail Express, even at the last moment.

As to clothes and general equipment, no very special
measures need be taken. Ordinary English summer clothing
