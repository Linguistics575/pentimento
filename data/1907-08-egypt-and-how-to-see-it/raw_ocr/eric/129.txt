ALEXANDRIA

but, for those who prefer a quieter life, very pleasant. In
front is the sea, and behind there is a pretty garden with
shady trees and a tennis court.

Other hotels that can be recommended are the New
Victoria and the Carlton.
They are both close to the
tramway and rather nearer
the town. Full particulars
of the hotels, &c., at Alex-
andria and Ramleh are
given on pages 159-161.

Villas at Ramleh, sur-
rounded by pretty gardens
and near the sea, can be
rented for longer or shorter
periods. The neighbour-
hood is charming, and the
air fresh and cool. It is
a great resort in summer,
and a godsend to the jaded
ofﬁcials who cannot escape
to England during the
heat.

It is necessary to give a
note of warning to bathers.
Although the bathing is
perfectly safe all along the
coast, it is not advisable
to swim far from the shore
without a boat, as there
are sometimes powerful cur-
rents. There have been several fatalities, and it is not safe
for even strong swimmers to venture out too far alone.

For particulars about the churches, see page 164.
