EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

There are many astronomical symbols, and, above all. there
is the painted zodiac on the ceiling, and the strange recum-
bent ﬁgure encircling three sides of it.

Sonnini. that same traveller who expatiated on Rosetta.
was so struck by Dendera as to give no less than ﬁve draw-
ings of diﬁerent ﬁgures. He speaks of undoubted Greek
inﬂuence—the bundles of plants in the hands of the members
of the Hathor procession, unusual in Egyptology, rather
suggesting Etruscan vases ; and he is struck by the ﬂeur—de-
lis and sceptre or truncheon. The temple is certainly unusual.
and happily it is in excellent preservation, though we are
told that the fellaheen actually built a village on the t0p of
it, and, further, that some of the Mameluke’s troops were
in the habit of using the temple at large as a target.

For all the attraction and even beauty of the frescoes and
sculpture, one can hardly form a fair impression from inside.
Those huge pillars, crowded together, the narrow way between
them, the darkness, all give an air of constraint, and not
of positive size. It is the roof that reveals the size and
height of the temple; and there, too, is the glorious view
over ﬁelds and river, and the high sequence of hills behind
in whose shadow the House of Hathor dominated the plain.

Tentyris, or Tentyra, an ancient town from which the
temple takes its name, was the centre of the crocodile feud.
The inhabitants of Tentyra seem to have had a great aversion
to crocodiles, and were expert at hunting and killing them;
hence the constant ﬁghts with the crocodile worshippers of
Ombos, or Kom Ombo.

The cost of the Journey is slight enough, ﬁve or six piastres
a head usually covers the hire of donkeys and the ferrV.
Perhaps another piastre or two may be given as bakshzsh if
the donkey- -boys have been decently helpful and quiet. To do
them justice, they are generally well- conducted 1n these parts.

Near Kous (kilo. 643) there are some ﬁne views of the
river on the right-hand side.

In half an hour the train reaches Luxor—673 kilometres
(420 miles) from Cairo.
