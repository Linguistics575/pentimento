EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

condition. The ﬁnger-marks of the Egyptian who had inserted
the last stone in the wall built to conceal the doorway were
still recognisable on the lime. There were also the marks of
naked feet imprinted on the sand which lay in one corner of
the tomb chamber. Everything was in its original condition
in this tomb, where the embalmed remains of the bull had
lain undisturbed for thirty-seven centuries.”

 

Besides the Pyramids, of which there are remains of some
twenty or thirty—many still of a considerable height——there
are countless tombs and mastabas of the great ones of Mem-
- phis. The most interesting of the latter are, perhaps, the
Mastabas of Ptahhotep and Ti and the tomb of Mereruka.

The Mastaba of Ptahhotep is between the Step Pyramid
and Mariette’s house. Ptahhotep was a high ofﬁcial in the
time of the ﬁfth dynasty.

The Mastaba of Ti is to the north-east of Mariette’s
house; it is also of the ﬁfth dynasty. The reliefs on the
walls of this and the last-mentioned tomb are of extraordinary
excellence, and although they date from about four thousand
years before Christ, many of the pictures are wonderfully
clear and lifelike ; in fact, the work is far better than any- _
thing that was produced during the later dynasties.

The Tomb of Mereruka is of considerable size, and
contains over thirty rooms. These are divided into three
parts : the tomb of Mereruka himself ; his wife, Hert-Watet-
Khet; and their son, Meri-Teti. They date from the sixth
dynasty. and are covered with reliefs, many of which are
worth examining.
