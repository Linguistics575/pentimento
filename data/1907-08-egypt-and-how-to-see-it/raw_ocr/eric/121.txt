THE DELTA

sufﬁcient wealth to occupy his army for three days in
pillage.

The town is as uninteresting as most Arab towns, but-
the surrounding country is pretty—by the Ismailia Canal,
for instance, which is the barrier between the cultivated
land and the desert. Near the lock is the irrigation rest-
house, by itself——a most attractive spot in the evening
light. Behind it is a broad track of sand, then a few strag-
gling palms, then the desert, changing rapidly to violet as
the shadows lengthen. In the far distance is a line of low
hills, of the deepest purple. The canal, luminous in the
failing light with soft reﬂections, stretches straight in either
direction. High-masted boats move slowly down the stream.

There are many such attractive places in the Delta—the
road from Bilbeis to Abou Hammad, for example. It is
about sixteen miles, parallel with the canal bank. The
scenery consists of palm-trees, crops of all sorts, and here
and there a village. There is many a quaint sakkieh, on
which a small boy or girl stands, like a charioteer, above the
horizontal wheel, yelling now and again and brandishing a
stick to prevent the buffalo from going fast asleep.

The whole road is delightful, sunlit and sleepy. Now
and again a fat village notable passes on an equally fat
donkey, or a splendid dark- faced Bedouin on a ﬁne mare,
a true horseman—one would say a centaur but for the
ﬂow of robes and the glistening girdle rOund the head- dress.

Salhieh, again, and Korain, where the French fought, are
good places—big palm—groves at the end of all things, on the
border of the desert. At Salhieh one walks straight away
from civilisation and the railway station on to the sand.
Only the line of telegraph posts to Kantarah breaks the
monotony. The yellow sand gleams, and the distant mounds
here and there fade and seem to take strange shapes in the
mirage of the strong sunlight. Now and again one comes
on a gipsy-faced woman tending a few goats that nibble
the scarce, stunted shrubs. In the distance, perhaps, appears
a Bedouin caravan—a long string of camels, laden with a
miscellaneous assortment of wares—returning from Syria;
for Salhieh is on the old overland route to Asia used since
the time of the Pharaohs by just such caravans as one may
see to- day.
