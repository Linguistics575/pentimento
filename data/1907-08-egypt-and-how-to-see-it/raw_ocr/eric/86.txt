EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

It is best to engage a guide for the temples and tombs.
There are quite a number of reliable men, and the selection
can be made through the hotel. The charge is from 20 pt.
to 30 pt. per day; arrangements can be made for longer
periods.

There are excellent donkeys for hire. The best course is
to select one and keep it throughout one’s stay. The charge
per day is 10 pt., but the donkey-boy will expect a piastre or
two bakshz'sh.

Thebes—East Bank—On the near or east side of the river
there are two places of special interest—the temple of Luxor,
in the village, two minutes’ walk from the hotels, and Karnak.
about a mile and a half to the north.

THE TEMPLE OF LUXOR

The temple of Luxor was built by several successive kings
at different periods, and dedicated to Amen and his wife
and son—Mut and Khons. The principal builders were
Amenhotep III. of the eighteenth, and Rameses II. of the
nineteenth dynasties. The former built the temple proper,
and the latter added the court and pylon on the north. The
great colonnade was built under Harmhabi. The original
entrance to the temple was through the centre of the north
pylon. On either side is a colossal seated statue of Rameses.
In front of these were two obelisks of red granite; one of
them is still in its place, but the other has been removed
and erected in the Place de la Concorde in Paris. 0n the
walls of the pylon are reliefs representing Rameses defeating
the Khita (Hittites) at Kadesh.

Beyond the pylon is the great court of Rameses II. ;
this was surrounded by a double row of columns. In the
north-west corner, near the pylon, is a small temple built by
Thothmes III., earlier than the great temple inside which
it stands. On the south-west wall of this court is a repre-
sentation of the temple of Luxor as it appeared in its day
—-a most interesting memorial. To the south is a lofty
colonnade of fourteen columns with calyx capitals in two
rows. These columns are over forty feet high, and give a
most impressive aspect to the whole structure, seen from
the river.

Beyond is the hypostyle hall, containing thirty-two papyrus
