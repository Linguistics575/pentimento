CAIRO

 

tions were undertaken by Sir Colin Scott Moncrieﬂ, which were
completed in 1890 at a further cost of £460,000, and have
been entirely successful.

The various works are built of a reddish yellow sandstone
of pleasing colour, and are in Norman style with castellated
towers at intervals. These, though unusual enough in such
surroundings, have in the distance a most attractive appear-
ance against the trees. The triangle of ground formed by
the two branches of the Nile was once fortiﬁed, but has since
been laid out in gardens.

The trees and the gardens are the great feature of the
Barrage: perfect lawns, trees, shrubs, ﬂowers of all kinds,
a delightful narrow pond passing beneath a wooden bridge
and covered with water-lilies—all is a most attractive contrast
to the usual Egyptian scenery. One may well wander all
day and never tire of it ; and the ordinary Egyptian scenes
are all the more appreciated for the very contrast. An
afternoon, a whole day, or a long evening can be spent there,
as one pleases. Only provisions should be taken; a lun-
cheon- plus tea-basket is here, as everywhere in Egypt, the
real solution of the question. One may choose some charm-
ing spot in the gardens, under trees, on the Open lawn; or
in one of the Norman towers, where a room exists for such
purposes, chairs and tables and an attendant who supplies
water for the tea, washes up the things, and generally makes
himself useful—all these things are provided.

One thing should be remembered—the gardens are far
cooler than Cairo (perhaps their chief attraction is the ab-
sence of heat, dust, and glare), and it is apt to be distinctly
chilly at night. Wraps and coats should be taken, the
more so as the Barrage is almost at its best after sunset.
