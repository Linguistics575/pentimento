UPPER EGYPT

wonderfully perfect, and the colours as fresh as when ﬁrst
put on 3500 years ago. The limestone, too, is of such uniform
excellence that in many cases the reliefs are cut in the living
rock itself, and their surface is almost like marble.

There are about forty rock tombs in all ; many have been
damaged and are not worth seeing, but four or ﬁve are of
great interest. Nos. 35, 17, and 11 are perhaps the best, and
if one can spend more time Nos. 6 and 9 are worth seeing.

The Tomb of Amenhotep II. (No. 35) is of particular
interest, as some of the mummies found have been left in situ.
Besides the mummy of Amenhotep II., which may be seen
lying in his sarcophagus, several other kings were also found.
Apparently at the time of Thebes’ decline the royal tombs
were no longer safe from robbers, so that many of the mummies
were removed to safer places. This tomb is specially designed
to bafﬂe the marauder. The main passage appears to end
in a large pit-like chamber, and it was only after considerable
trouble that the continuation of it was discovered, as the
opening had been bricked up and carefully concealed.

Now that it is opened, a wooden bridge spans the pit,
and just beyond is the tomb chamber, with beautifully
coloured reliefs. Amongst others the mummies of Seti II.,
Thothmes IV., and Amenhotep III. were found here, and
have been removed to the Cairo Museum.

The Tomb of Seti I. (No. 17) was discovered by Belzoni
as early as 1817. The reliefs are considered to be the ﬁnest
of any in the tombs. They show the king before various
gods, also the different stages of the sun-god’s passage through
the under-“world. In the mummy chamber was found only
the alabaster sarcophagus ; the mummy was found at Deir-
el-Bahari, and is in Cairo.

The Tomb of Rameses III. (No. 11) varies from the
others, as on either side of the main passage is a series of
small chambers. The most diverse and interesting scenes
are depicted on their walls. The mummy of the king was
found at Deir-el-Bahari, and is now in the Cairo Museum.

The tombs of Rameses IX. and VI. (Nos. 6 and 9) are also
interesting, and should not be missed, unless the visitor is
pressed for time.

 

From the Tombs of the Kings a mountain-path leads over
the hill. It is about half an hour across to Deir-el-Bahari—
a short cut, and not difﬁcult. Near the point where the
