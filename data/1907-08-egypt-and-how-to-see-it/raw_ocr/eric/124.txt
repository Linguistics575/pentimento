Tantah and Mansourah are both large and important
towns. Tantah has a ﬁne mosque, but its chief fame is that
it possesses the tomb of Said Ahmed El-Bedawy, a celebrated
Moslem saint, in whose honour are festivals in January,
April, and August, the last two being the most important.
These “ Moulids,” as they are called, last a week—from
Friday to Friday—and are well worth seeing. There is a
huge crowd of some 200,000 people, who come in from all the
country round. Strange symbolical parades are held of fan-
tastic emblems and curious dances; the uncanny, ceaseless,
Arab music and singing is their setting.

After Tantah the train passes Mehallet-Kebir, a charming
old town with many fair minarets and spires. One might be
tempted to spend a night there (though this can hardly be
recommended unless the traveller does not mind “ roughing
it,” as what inns the town possesses are very primitive). One
ought to walk through the town at sunset, up the narrow,
covered streets, past the many mosques. Then is heard,
startlingly sudden, the magniﬁcent call to prayer breaking
out overhead—sonorous, echoing and rolling through the
fading night. and dying away in a long wailing note.

Mansourah is a great town for cotton and trade, and has
quite a considerable EuroPean colony. The chief attraction
is the river view, and as a town it is notable as the place
where St. Louis was imprisoned in 1250 A.D.

From Mansourah to Damietta the line parallels the river,
and passes at ﬁrst through rich cotton country. None of
the small towns are of special interest or importance, though
they are characteristic enough of the country.

Damietta itself, like Rosetta, declined as Alexandria rose,
but it is still a centre of a small commerce from Greek and
Levantine ports, besides the interior of Egypt.

The general impression of Damietta is unique. The river
