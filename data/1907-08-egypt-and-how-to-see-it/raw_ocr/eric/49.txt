CAIRO

under which the Virgin is said to have rested, and the well
from which she drew water wherewith to wash the Child’s
garment. Where she threw it down balsam-plants sprang
up, so it is said. The balsam-trees which originated from
these were said to grow nowhere else in Egypt, and no
Christian was considered to be properly baptized unless a
drop of their oil was thrown into the font. The Apocryphal
GOSpels also state that the idols of On fell down when the
Virgin and Child reached the city.

On the desert side of Matarieh is the Ostrich Farm, which
is open to visitors. It is an interesting object for an after-
noon excursion. The view from the top of the building,
round which are the pens of the ostriches, embraces desert
and cultivation, Cairo and the Mokattams.

Marg is a thoroughly native mud village in a large grove
of palm-trees; it contrasts strikingly with the European
settlements at the other stations.

One can motor out as far as Matarieh, and it is possible
that a motor-road may be, made shortly as far as Khanka.
The trains run every half-hour from Pont Limoun to Marg
up to 1.30 at night. The time-table is on page 187.

 

THE HELIOPOLIS OASIS

The phenomenal extension of Cairo in all directions induced
a group of ﬁnanciers to start the scheme known as the “ Helio-
polis Oasis ” in 1905. Some ﬁve thousand acres of high-
lying desert land near H.H. the Khedive’s Palace at Koubbeh
were procured, with the object of building a species of desert
pleasure city. The work is at this moment progressing
vigorously. A ﬁne road connects Abbassieh with the “ Oasis,”
and a motor service has been organised. An electric railwav
is also in process of construction, to connect the “ Oasis "
with Pont Limoun station, and a network of roads has been
laid out in the “ city ” itself. Some ﬁfty villas and shops,
a station for the electric railway, a family hotel, a casino in
Moorish style, and the Heliopolis Palace Hotel are in course
of erection, and a large amount of work has already been
achieved.

The Palace Hotel has been conceived on a large scale.
It is in the Oriental style of architecture, and will have a
ﬁne restaurant on each of its two stories, from whence is
obtained a wide view of the desert, the cultivation. and Cairo ;
