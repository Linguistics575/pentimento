ALEXANDRIA

 

The sea-shore at Aboukir is of sand, smooth and ﬁne, and
it makes a good place for a picnic.

The journey itself is interesting. At ﬁrst are the gardens
of Ramleh, then the summer palace of H.H. the Khedive at
Montaza is passed. Then the line threads the narrow strip
of land between the sea on the left and Lake Edkou on the
right. Maadieh and Edkou are resorts of ﬁshers, and their
bright-coloured, ﬁat-bottomed boats with high curling prows
are seen on the edge of the lake. In Winter vast ﬂocks of
water-fowl can be seen on the water. Between Boussili
and Rosetta is mostly desert, relieved at intervals by tiny
villages amid their palms and fruit trees.

Rosetta is a town of considerable size, but its pOpulation
has dwindled, so that most of the houses appear to be empty.
It stands on the western branch of the Nile, near its mouth.
For this reason it used to be a port of considerable importance.
until, when the Mahmoudieh Canal was cut, the trade of the
Delta was diverted to Alexandria. There is still a con-
siderable industry in rice.

The streets are lined with curious, old-world houses,
standing aloof, as if Rosetta had long retired from the active
race for prosperity.

The town is memorable for one great discovery, the “ Ro-
setta Stone,” now in the British Museum. On this stone is
engraved a decree which is written in three forms—ancient-
Egyptian hieroglyphics, Demotic characters, and Greek. It
was discovered in 1799, and formed the ﬁrst key with which
the inscriptions of ancient Egypt were deciphered.

Sonnini, who visited Egypt in 1777, is enthusiastic over
the “ rich. fertile. and beautiful country, the gardens, the
