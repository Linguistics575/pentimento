A Tomb in the Desert

CHAPTER V
THE SUDAN

To a certain proportion of our annual visitors “ wintering in
Egypt ” includes a trip to Khartoum and Omdurman, but
these regular travellers to the south can as yet scarcely be
called numerous, though their numbers increase annually.
Doubtless to many people the word “ Sudan ” calls up visions
of burning deserts, arduous travel, and general conditions
remote from civilisation.

Modern enterprise, however, has within a decade brought
the ancient capital of the dervishes within a few days’
journey of Cairo, and up-to-date means of travel, both by
river and rail, combine to render the journey at once com-
fortable and expeditious.

The following notice has been issued for visitors to the
Sudan:

“ Travellers, while in the Sudan, are particularly requested
to refrain from gaining an easy reputation for generosity by
giving money to children. beggars. or other persons who

have not earned it. ,
