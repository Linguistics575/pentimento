CAIRO

Ptah was incarnate in the Apis bulls, who were ﬁrst wor-
shipped, then drowned in the sacred lake, embalmed, and
ﬁnally buried in the magniﬁcent granite sarcophagi of the
Apis Tombs.

The ﬁrst objects of interest after leaving the station are
the Colossi of Rameses II.: these formerly marked the
entrance to a temple. The ﬁrst, made of granite, lies pros-
trate; its length with the crown, which has fallen off, is
over 30 ft. The second colossus is of limestone, 42 ft. high ;
it stands in an enclosure (4 pt. is charged to enter, unless
one has a general pass). The foundations of the temple of
Ptah can be seen a little to the north.

From this point it is about an hour’s ride to the Step
Pyramid. This is the tomb of King Zoser (third dynasty),
older than the Gizeh Pyramids; unlike them, it is built
in six stages or steps. It is about 200 ft. high. A little to
the south-west is the Pyramid of Unas, a king of the ﬁfth
dynasty. The walls of the tomb chamber are covered with
coloured hieroglyphics which are among the oldest that
have been found.

After this, lunch may be taken at Mariette’s House,
Mariette was the famous French Egyptologist who discovered
the Apis Tombs in 1851, and afterwards became Director of
Antiquities to the Egyptian Government (1857—1881).

A few minutes distant are the tombs of the Apis bulls or
Serapcum ; there are nearly four hundred yards of vaulted
subterranean passages with niches at intervals in which are
the granite sarcoPhagi of the bulls. Twenty-four of these
are still in position; they are cut from a single block of
granite, and weigh sixty or seventy tons. The following
extract from Mariette’s report on his discovery may be
interesting :

 

“ I confess that when I penetrated for the ﬁrst time, on
November 12, 1851, into the Apis vaults, I was so profoundly
struck with astonishment that the feeling is still fresh in my
mind, although ﬁve years have elapsed since then. Owing
to some chance which it is difﬁcult to account for, a chamber
which had been walled up in the thirtieth year of the reign
of Rameses II. had escaped the notice of the plunderers of
the vaults, and I was so fortunate as to ﬁnd it untouched.
Although 3700 years had elapsed since it was closed. every-
thing in the chamber seemed to be precisely in its original
