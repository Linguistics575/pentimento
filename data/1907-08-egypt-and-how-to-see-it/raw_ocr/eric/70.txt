EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

The train is a fast and luxurious substitute. Every night
through the season the trains de luxe run between Cairo
and Luxor; they are made up of dining- and sleeping-cars.
and only carry ﬁrst-class passengers. These trains are really
as excellent as any in the world; they do not tear along and
shake the life out of the luckless passengers as do the vaunted
Riviera “ﬂyers.” The cars cannot be surpassed. They
have a double roof to preserve an even temperature, double
windows that keep out dust and cinders; and, of course,
electric fans, ice, and any and everything one can wish for is
carried. Their great length and width ensures steady and
smooth running, so that one can sleep well all through the
journey.

The trains from Cairo and Luxor respectively leave at
6.30 P.M., and dinner (price 25 pt.) is served at 7.30 P.M.
At the beginning and end of the season the “ Trains de Luxe ”
do not run, and a sleeping- and dining-car are put on to the
8 RM. from Cairo and the 5.30 P.M. from Luxor, three times
a week, in each direction.

It 1s as well to secure berths through the Wagons- Lits
Company’s ofﬁces in Cairo and the principal stations, or
through the tourist agencies.

Those who wish to get some impression of the country,
and who do not mind a long journey by day, can leave Cairo
at 8.30 A.M., or Luxor at 7.0 A.M., and they will reach their
destination the same evening. They should, however, take
a luncheon-basket with them.

The best months are from November to March, before and
after which periods the heat is rather too much for many
people. But if one cares to brave it, and owing to the purity
and dryness of the air it is not really so very trying, one
should go south in October ; then Egypt presents her greatest
wonder, for the “ Nile overﬂoweth all his banks,” and the
world is one vast sheet of water from the railway to the hills.
The sunset ﬁres it to a marvel of ﬂame that fades to deep
red, then rose, at last steely black under the starlight.
Here and there a causeway cleaves the ﬂood, a village
stands out, a group of palm-trees rise. The desert hills take
wonderful colours under the changing light.

People who know no Arabic will probably need a dragoman
or guide. It is, perhaps, best to engage one on the Spot, and
not to take men from Cairo. The local guides know their
work and their monuments much better ; besides, a strange
