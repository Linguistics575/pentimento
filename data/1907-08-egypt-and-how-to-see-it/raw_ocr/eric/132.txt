EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

with their buildings still standing. The Arabs use it as a
place for lying in wait for travellers. There may be seen
lofty and well-built palaces with enclosure walls around
them. They are for the most part built over vaulted colon-
nades, and some few serve as dwellings for monks. There
are some springs of fresh water, but they are somewhat
scanty. Next one comes to the church of St. Menas, a huge
building decorated with statues and paintings of the greatest
beauty. There tapers burn day and night without ceasing.
At one end of the church is a vast tomb with two camels in
marble, and upon them the statue of a 'man carved in marble,
who is standing with one foot upon each camel. One of his
hands is open and the other closed. This statue is said to
represent St. Menas. On the right as you enter the church
is a great marble column, in which a shrine is carved con-
taining ﬁgures of Jesus, John, and Zacharias. There is also
to be seen a statue of the Virgin Mary, hidden by two cur-
tains, and statues of all the prophets. Outside the church
are ﬁgures representing all kinds of animals and men of all
occupations. Among others is a slave merchant holding
in his hand a purse upside down. Over the midst of the church
is a dome, beneath which are eight ﬁgures said to represent
angels. Close to the church is a mosque, where the Moslems
come to pray. All the surrounding land is planted with
fruit trees. The fruit is very good, and used for making
syrup. There are also a great many vines from which wine
is made.’

“This description proves that for long after the Arab con-
quest, although the city was uninhabited, yet it was still
intact, but the unknown Arab traveller wrote these lines
in the tenth century, before the conquest of England by the
Normans, and from that time until June 1905 the marble city
of the patron saint of Egypt remained lost amidst the wilds
of Mariout. The vines and fruit trees have all gone, the
springs are dried up, and not a single visitor save the wan—
dering Bedouin has ever passed by the ruined basilicas and
monasteries of the Lourdes of Christian Egypt. Although
the feast of St. Menas has always been kept up by the Or-
thodox, Jacobite, and Abyssinian Churches, and the ﬂasks
of the holy oil of the saint have been collected in all the
museums of Europe, the mystery surrounding the site of
the city appeared to be as insoluble as that of the equally
recondite Wady-el-Malook in Upper Egypt, until the learned
