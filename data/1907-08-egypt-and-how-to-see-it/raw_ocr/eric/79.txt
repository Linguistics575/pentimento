UPPER EGYPT

can claim some attention owing to the proximity of the two
great Coptic monasteries, the White and the Red. These
once magniﬁcent buildings suffered repeatedly at the hands
of the Mamelukes. They are now being slowly and carefully
repaired. They are situated on the desert edge.

Sohag itself has only one feature——the river-front. A long
line of dwelling-houses faces the Nile, and the road is shaded
by lebbek-trees. The soft, peaceful, changing lights on the
water, the boats passing lazily up and down, the distant
fertile shore, and the hills that bound the view, form a most
characteristic picture. In the immediate foreground are the
women scrambling up and down the bank, washing clothes,
fetching water, and chattering all the time.

Guergueh (kilo. 504) is a large town. There is a very old
Roman Catholic convent here, and across the river are the
remains of a temple of Rameses the Great.

El-Birbeh, a little to the north of Guergueh, is supposed to
be the site of This, or Thinis, the seat of the earliest of all
the dynasties—the ﬁrst and second. In the hills on the
left can be seen the rock tombs of the Thinite notables.

Baliana (kilo. 521) is the station for the temples of Abydos.
For this expedition donkeys can be engaged at the station;
the charge is 10 pt. per day.

 

ABYDOS

Abydos is some six or seven miles from Baliana station.
The route is uninterrupted, over the rich plain, along the
high causeway—the one path from river to desert edge
when the ﬂoods are out. Abydos has one of the most impor-
tant and interesting of all the temples in Egypt. It was
built by Seti I., the father of Rameses the Great, and the
has-reliefs and paintings are as wonderful as any in Egypt.
carried out with the greatest skill and exactitude. They
are, as in the art of that period, conventional and devoted
to elaborate and minute detail, but the thoroughness of the
work distinguishes it from almost all that of other epochs.

The important feature of this temple is the Tablet of the
Kings. It shows Seti, the king, and Rameses, the prince,
offering the sacred ﬁre and reading the hymn; and then
follow the cartouches of seventy-six of the most noted kings
of Egypt, from Menes to Seti—a great and valuable record
for Egyptologists.
