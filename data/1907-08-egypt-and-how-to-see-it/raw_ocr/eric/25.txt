CAIRO

where polo, golf, tennis, and croquet are played, and where
the races take place every fortnight during the season.

Mena House Hotel, at the Pyramids, must not be for-
gotten ; it is about eight miles from Cairo, and is connected
with it by a good service of electric trams. The hotel is built
on the edge of the desert, close to the Great Pyramid—an
ideally healthy spot. The management is excellent, and the
arrangements as comfortable as at any hotel in Egypt.

For full particulars of the hotels see pages 155—158.

 

Cairo is the successor of Amru’s city El-Fostat, founded in
641 A.D. Its foundations were marked out by Gawhar, the
commander-in-chief of the Caliph Muizz, in 969 A.D., and it
was named El-Kahira “ The Victorious,” as the moment when
the digging was commenced was signiﬁed by Mars being in
the ascendant. It was a walled city with gates—Bab-el-
Nasr, Bab-el-Foutouh, and Bab-el-Zouileh. The Citadel was
built by Saladin. We need not dilate here on its history,
but we may cite the quaint and delightful description of it
by one Richard Johnson, an Elizabethan, who wrote the
lives and exploits of “The Seven Champions of Christendom.”
Really his impression of Cairo is too good to lose. Appa-
rently the chronology is about 500 A.D., though we ﬁnd a
Ptolemy reigning in Egypt contemporary with Coventry’s
best mediaeval period. Another charming anomaly is that
the Great Pyramids are in Greece. and not at Gizeh ; but
of course in those days there were Paladins, fair distressed
ladies, dragons, magicians, and fairies galore, and all this
may well compensate for a mere chronological or topographical
inaccuracy!

“ Grand Cairo,” says Richard Johnson, ‘ was then under
the subjection of the Egyptian monarchy, and the greatest
city of the world ; for it was in breadth full three score miles,
and had by just account within its walls twelve thousand
churches, besides abbeys, priories, and houses of religion.
When St. George with his stately attendants entered the
gates, they were presently entertained with such a joyful
sound of bells, trumpets and drums that it seemed like the
inspiring music of heavenly angels, and to exceed the royalty
of Caesar in Rome when he returned from the world’s
conquest: the streets were beautiﬁed with stately
pageants contrived by scholars of ingenious capacity, the
pavement strewed with all manner of odoriferous ﬂowers,
