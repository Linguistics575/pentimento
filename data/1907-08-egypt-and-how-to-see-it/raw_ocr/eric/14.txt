EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

once, a collection of houses, and a low-lying line of sand.
and the ship is in the channel steaming between buoys
Dc Lesseps’ statue dominates the harbour ; one outstretched
ﬁnger points to his work, the great waterway that joins
East to West.

Boats crowd round, full of shouting Arabs, and the moment
the ship stops there ensues a rush of frenzied hawkers and
minstrels. They sell cigarettes—beware of these—lace. post-
cards of more or less dubious interest, Renter’s telegrams,
newspapers, anything that may extort piastres. Cook’s is a fair
remedy if one has much baggage, though a single man of parts
and experience may well ﬁght for his own hand. take one of
the native boats, and arrive even before Cook’s men. The
Customs are not exacting as to personal effects; guns,
bicycles, and a few other accessories—one may call them
impersonal or commercial—are liable to a duty of 8 per cent.
on their value.

Port Said is hardly a place at which to stay. The town is
not interesting, and it has few amusements.

One unique phenomenon there is at Port Said, the coaling
by night—a hurricane of ﬂying natives, lit up by braziers
that ﬂare through the uncanny mist of coal-dust. They ﬂing
their boards against the ship, rush up with full baskets,
hurl the coal into the bunkers, and rush down again. It is a
verv inferno of haste and efﬁciency.

The hotels here are fair as to accommodation. Thc
Savoy. on the sea-front, and the Eastern Exchange, in
the centre of the town, are the two best.

If possible, it will be well to take the train at once. There
are three trains a day, at 8.10 A.M., 12.30 P.M., and 6.45 P.M.
The two latter have dining-cars, and the journey takes from
four and a half to ﬁve hours. Port Said is 237 kilometres
(about 150 miles) from Cairo. The fares are: First class,
95 pt. ; second class, 47.} pt. In the restaurant-car 25 pt.
is charged for dinner and 20 pt. for lunch. The full time-
table is given on page 175.

Leaving Port Said, the line runs parallel to the Suez Canal
and the “ Sweetwater ” Canal, Port Said’s only source of
fresh water. On the right is at ﬁrst the shallow Lake
Menzaleh, where one sees, in the winter time, quantities
of water-fowl, and now and again pelicans and ﬂamingoes
of vivid plumage—rose, scarlet, and ﬂamacoloured. Kantarah.
about twenty-ﬁve miles from Port Said. is one of the points
