Evening on the Nile

CHAPTER IV

UPPER EGYPT

THE name “ Upper Egypt ” is applied to the country south
of Cairo as far as the Soudan frontier—near Wadi-Halfa.
Sometimes the name Middle Egypt is used for the stretch
between Cairo and Assiout, south of which is Upper Egypt
pr0per. '

Above all things, those who visit this country, even if
only for a short time, should see Luxor and Assouan—
ideally dry, warm and healthy, set in ﬁne rugged hill scenery,
the home of monuments as wonderful as any the world
possesses , they should be the principal goal of all travellers
in the “ Land of Khem. ”

The time- honoured highway is, of course, the Nile. Tourist
steamers (for which, see page 203) pass up and down fre-
quently , wealthy visitors may hire a private sailing, or,
better still, a steam dahabeah (01 house- boat) but the rail-
way has been so greatly improved lately as to be acknow-
ledged the most comfortable and convenient route. The river
journey has, of course, its pleasures and even luxuries, but it
can become tedious, and steamers are sometimes over-
crowded.
