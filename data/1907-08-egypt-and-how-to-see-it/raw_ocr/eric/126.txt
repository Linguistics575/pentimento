EGYPT. AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

all sorts that frequent it—geese. swans, pelicans, ﬂamingoes,
ducks, and every sort of water-loving fowl.

Sais, a collection of ﬁshermen’s huts on the south of the
lake, was once an important city, Tanis. It was the capital
in the twenty-ﬁrst dynasty. The numerous obelisks are attri-
buted to Rameses the Great, and a gateway bears his name.

The ruins of the city were uncovered by Mariette, who
found huge fallen and broken obelisks and great statues of
porphyry and granite. Pillars and stones lie here and there
where they fell one by one in the silent ages. Pottery and
papyri of great interest have also been found. Amongst
them were a table of hieroglyphics and a geographical pam-
phlet showing the names or provinces of ancient Egypt.

Tanis is the city written of by Messrs. Rider Haggard and
Andrew Lang in “ The World’s Desire,” a really ﬁne book.
They present that mighty city in all its glory, the reigning
Pharaoh Meneptah, the Hebrews and their exodus, and over
all is the glamour of the legend of Helen of Troy and Odysseus,
who, in the story, came after many wanderings, and solitary.
bereft of wife, child, and home, to ﬁnd his love and death in
the “ Land of Khem.”

The “ Field of Zoan ”—mentioned in the Bible—which
was one of the most fertile parts of the country, was in the
. neighbourhood of Tanis. It is now covered by Lake Menzaleh.
