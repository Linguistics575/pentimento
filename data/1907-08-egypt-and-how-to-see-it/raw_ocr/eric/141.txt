THE‘ SINAI PENINSULA

THE SINAI PENINSULA

A visit to the Sinai Peninsula is an undertaking that
requires special preparations, and it is best to apply at once
to Messrs. Cook and Son, who are thorough experts in all
such matters. They will not only provide all possible and
necessary means of transport, but will arrange to charge a
ﬁxed price per day. This saves all bargaining and trouble.
and is by far the most comfortable and economical process.

The expedition should take about three weeks, which
will give plenty of time for seeing the chief objects of interest.

The peninsula itself is a mountainous desert, arid and
desolate, but with its own grandeur, and even fascination.
It is inhabited by a number of Bedouins, who do a certain
amount of rather primitive trading in gum-arabic, charcoal,
and manna from the tamarisk trees.

The real interest of the desert is its Biblical and Christian
history. One mav see Horeb, Sinai, and many another spot
associated with the wanderings of the Chosen PeOple. A
visit should be made to the great monastery of St. Catherine,
founded by Justinian in 530 A.D. It is the home of many
famous manuscripts—above all, the Sinaitic Codex of the
Septuagint, which Tischendbrf retrieved after three visits.
The monastery is rich in relics and memorials of early saints
—St. Helena, Joachim, Simon Stylites of the Pillar, and
many another. It is one of the few remaining monuments
of the dawn of Christianity.

It is hardly within the scOpe of this book to enter into a
full disquisition on all that others have so admirably described
from intimate knowledge and experience. We will but hint
at the ancient Church of the Transﬁguration, its strange
mosaics and medallions, and its great library, in which is
the Codex Aureus—twelve hundred years old, written in gold
on vellum—the Psalter, and many another treasure of pious
craftsmanship. A four days’ visit is none too long for the
monastery and all that it can show.

Another feature of the Sinai Peninsula is its importance as
a ﬁeld for mining enterprise. There are records of its having
been worked as far back as the third dynasty, and the mines
bear inscriptions by many of the kings from the thirteenth
to the twentieth dynasties. Little further is heard of the
peninsula as a whole from 3.0. 1200 to the second or third
centuries of the Christian era. Turquoises, malachite, and
copper were the chief treasures found.

Scarcely any attempts of importance have been made as
