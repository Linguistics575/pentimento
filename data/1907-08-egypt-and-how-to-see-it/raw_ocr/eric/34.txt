'EGYPT, AND HOW' TO SEE IT

Middle Ages. All modern learning and knowledge is ignored.
The education is entirely free. Four of the nine rows of
pillars in the liwan, or sanctuary, were contributed by one
Abd-el-Rahman, whose tomb is in the building. This liwan
is the principal hall of instruction (about 3600 sq. yds. in
area). The students sit on their heels round their respective
professors, and pay a varying degree of attention to his
lecture.

The Sharia Sanadikiah leads from El-Azhar to El-Ghouri
Mosque, the interior of which is interesting. Close to it is
the Mosque El-Moulaiyad (1415 A.D.). Its ﬁne bronze gate
was taken from the Sultan Hassan Mosque. The roof is
supported by marble columns, and the lower part of the back
wall, inlaid here and there with coloured marble, has seven
niches. The upper half is illuminated with texts in gold
lettering from the Koran. The roof is of dark material, on
which are worked gold arabesque patterns. The pulpit is
ﬁne. The whole building was recently restored, and appears,
in consequence, cleaner and better preserved than other
'mosques.

The Mosque of El-Hassanein—close to the Sikket-el-
Badistan—dedicated to the two grandsons of the prophet
Hassan and Hussein, is the scene of the annual festival of the
Shi’ite sect of Mussulmans (chieﬂy Persians). There is a.
procession through the principal streets at night, led by
dervishes, who cut at one another with swords and cover
themselves with blood.

The Muristan, or Hospital of Kalaoun, and the Barkuk
Mosque (1410 A.D.) are close together in the Sharia El-Nahas-
seen, or street of the coppersmiths, who occupy the lower
parts of the Muristan.

The Mosque of El-Hakim, further on, has two good minarets.
It has also the interest of being nearly as old as the Ibn El-
zTouloun Mosque (990 A.D.). The two gates of Bab-el-
Foutouh and Bab-el-Nasr are close at hand. They and this
mosque were fortiﬁed by the French. From the Bab-el-
Nasr one can get a carriage—there are always plenty standing
there—and drive back to one’s hotel.
