later kings.

Most people will consider Karnak well worth a second
visit at least ; and, if possible, they should arrange to see it
by moonlight—the effect is impressive.

Thebes—West Bank.—Onthe west side of the Nile there
are a great many points of interest which should on no
account be missed.

It is best to start at about 10 A.M., to have lunch on the
far side. and return to Luxor about 3 or 4 RM.

This was the site chosen by the kings for their sepulture.

Cut in the face of the almost perpendicular limestone are a
number of small, stone-lined doorways. All the tombs, though

same plan. A steep, s10ping passage, cut downwards, right
