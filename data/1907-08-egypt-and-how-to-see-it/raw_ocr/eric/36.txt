EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

Room F contains a beautiful lotus-bud pillar of the ﬁfth
dynasty. In a glass case are statues of Prince Rahetep and
his wife, Princess Nefert; the colouring is remarkably fresh,
and they are amongst the most charming things in the
museum. The eyes are made of coloured quartz, and the
ﬁgures have an exceedingly lifelike appearance. There are
also two ﬁne limestone statues of Ranafer, priest of Ptah, and
a remarkable statue in bronze of Pepi I., found at Kom-el-
Ahmar: the face, hands, and feet are cast (sire perdue), the
body is hammered out.
