EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

covered in and populous with sellers of Assiout shawls, red
slippers, and red and black pottery—vases and cups of rather
formal design, animals, monkeys, camels, lizards, quaintly
moulded and whimsical of expression.
The barrage is about a mile away—a long, plain, solid
succession of arches—and the Nile stretches blue-grey above
and below it. Here, too,
are gardens, made and in
preparation, with delightful
weeping - willows. King-
ﬁshers, hoopoes, and water-
wagtails hop about and ﬂit
to and fro under the brilliant
sunlight.

Assiout is still rather
primitive, perhaps, but it
has one small hotel—the
New Hotel—close to the
station, which is certainly
much cleaner than most of
its kind. One may well
spend two or three days
there. There is a certain
cleanliness and quiet, too,
about the town, an absence
of noise or crowd, a dis-
tinct picturesque placidity
that makes the best of the
clear air and the sun.

The country to the south

On the Canal, Beni-Korra of Assiout is wholly subject

to “ basin irrigation” ; the

land is divided up by banks of earth into basins several

miles across. In the autumn, when the Nile is in ﬂood, the

basins are ﬁlled, the water is allowed to stand for a month

or six weeks, and then it ﬂows back to the river or into

another basin at a lower level.

For this reason it will be noticed that the villages are built

on mounds and stand up a few feet above the ﬁelds.

Sohag (kilo. 470) is the next place of importance. This is
the Mudirieh town, or capital, of Guergueh province. It
