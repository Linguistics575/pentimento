EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

Amen, the “ Throne of the World,” as it was called—by far
the most magniﬁcent of any of the remains of Egypt’s former
grandeur.

No one builder is responsible for the temple, but almost
every king of any note from the twelfth dynasty to the
Ptolemies had a hand in its construction.

In front, forming the entrance to the temple, is the great
pylon, a gigantic structure nearly 150 ft. high and 350
broad. A magniﬁcent view of all the ruins can be seen
from the top, which is easily reached from the left-hand
side. In front stretches the great court of the temple,
covering an area of over two acres, and once surrounded by
columns. In the centre stood a colonnade, now in ruins,
but one single perfect column remains, with graceful calyx
capital, 70 ft. in height. Beyond the court one gets a glimpse,
through the ruined second pylon, of the huge columns of the
hypostyle hall. The more distant ruins appear confused;
above them towers, a hundred feet into the air, the red-
granite obelisk of Queen Hatasu.

There appears to have been a temple at Karnak dating
from the Middle Empire, but it remained comparatively in-
signiﬁcant until the eighteenth dynasty. Thothmes I. built
two pylons—the fourth and ﬁfth, counting from the west.
Queen Hatasu erected two obelisks, one of which has been
mentioned; the other lies on the ground, broken. Her
brother, Thothmes III.. built a separate temple to the east,
and surrounded the whole with a wall. The third pylon is
attributed to Amenhotep III.

During the nineteenth dynasty Rameses I. built the
second pylon, and between this and the third his successors
Seti I. and Rameses III. built the great hypostyle hall.

Seti II. and Rameses III. built separate temples to the
west of the main building. Nothing more was achieved
until the Bubastide kings of the twenty-second dynasty built
the great court which joined the temples of Seti II. and
Rameses III. to the earlier ediﬁce. Finally the great pylon
was added by the Ptolemies. Thus the whole temple must
have been over ﬁfteen hundred years in the building. All
the kings who had a hand in it left a record of their con-
quests and other deeds on its walls. Many of these are well
preserved and exceedingly interesting.

On the outside of the south wall of the hall of columns is
a very interesting relief recording the victories of Shishak,
