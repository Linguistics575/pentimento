EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

mendicity are equally obvious, and, as time goes on, cannot
fail to increase, unless some means are adopted for checking
the practice. .

“ It would be extremely difﬁcult for the Government to
devise an effective remedy for this state of things. The real
remedy rests with the travellers themselves. If money
were, in future, only bestowed in return for some actual .
service rendered, or in case of evident and established dis-
tress, the present pernicious habit of begging would soon die
out, to the advantage both of the perle and of the visitors.

“ It is with this conviction that we venture to express a
hope that our fellow countrymen, when travelling in Egypt,
will lend their aid to this important reform by abstaining
from the distribution of money in response to mere demands
for bakshish, bestowing it only when the circumstances
appear to them to warrant their generosity.

“ Tourists should especially abstain from throwing money
from the decks of the steamers to the landing-stages or on
to the banks of the Nile for the purpose of witnessing the
scramble for the coins; such exhibitions are mischievous
as well as degrading.

The shops in Upper Egypt are, as a rule, primitive, and it
is as well to take what one requires from Cairo. There are a
few shops—chemists, photograph shops, and suchlike, but
very little else in the way of European necessities is to be
found. As to clothes, one should take thick things as well
as thin ; there are occasional cold days, and almost always
cold nights. It rains very seldom, but once in a way it does
rain, and a waterproof or umbrella may be found most useful,
even at Assouan, between November and March. A sun-
helmet is really seldom necessary ; a straw hat, or at most a
terai or felt hat, is quite sufﬁcient. The glare in the desert is
occasionally trying, and some visitors may ﬁnd smoked glasses
comforting.
