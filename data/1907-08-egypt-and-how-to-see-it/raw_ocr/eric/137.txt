In the Oasis of Siwa

CHAPTER VIII

ISMAILIA—SUEZ-—THE CANAL—THE
PENINSULA OF SINAI AND THE
OASES

CAIRO T0 ISMAILIA

FOR two hours one traverses the Delta, swiftly and smoothly,
through rich cotton and corn land, bridging canals that ﬂow
peacefully between long rows of mimosa-trees. To the right
is the pale rose border of low hills that stretch from Marg
past Belbeis, along the desert line to Abou-Hammad. There
the cultivation ceases. From Abou-Hammad to Tel-el-Kebir
is sand— uncompromising sand, and only sand.

The brief halt at Tel-el-Kebir shows the cemetery on the
right hand—a green patch, quiet with memories. Again
there is sand and waste until Ismailia is reached. There is
complete change—a leafy hamlet in the midst of desert.
Everywhere is thick foliage of lebbek-trees above carpets of
ﬂowers and vegetation, intersected by straight white roads.
