EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

terrace, on which a band usually plays in the afternoon during
tea. There is a pretty garden at the back, with shady trees
and ﬂowers, and also a tennis-court. The interior is deco- .
rated in Arab and Egyptian style; the restaurant and lounge
in particular are remarkable.

The Continental is a large new hotel facing the Opera
Square and the Esbekieh Gardens, and offers many attrac-
tions to its patrons. The terrace has a most animated
appearance. This hotel has the most central position of
any, and is conveniently near the best sh0ps and the bazaars ;
in fact, it is a good starting-point for all the sights of
Cairo.

A smaller and quieter hotel, the Angleterre. in Sharia-
el-Magraby—is greatly appreciated by those who desire a
quieter life than is possible in the larger establishments ;
it is, however, ﬁrst class, and quite as well managed as any
of the big hotels.

The new Hotel Semiramis, only opened last season, is one
of the best situated in the town, being alongside the Nile,
close to the Kasr-el-Nil bridge, and in the fashionable Kasr-
el-Doubara quarter. From its terrace visitors may enjoy
one of the most extensive and picturesque views of Cairo.
The interior arrangements of the hotel are, needless to say,
quite up to date and most comfortable from every point of
View.

The Ghezireh Palace Hotel is on the island of Ghezireh
——a fashionable suburb. The building was once a palace of
the Khedive Ismail, and the decorations are in the 'most
gorgeous and lavish style. As a hotel it ranks with the best ;
it is about two miles out of Cairo, and the dust and noise of
the town are avoided. The distance is no drawback, as
there is an electric omnibus as well as plenty of carriages
ready to convey visitors all over Cairo ; there is also a steam
ferry across the Nile. The gardens in which the hotel stands
are as beautiful as any in or near Cairo ; on the east side is
the broad smooth stream of the Nile.

These gardens are gay all the winter through with ﬂowers,
and have many shady walks Where one may escape for a
time from the bustle of the town. During the season a band
plays every afternoon on the terrace. In the grounds is the
Casino, where the fancy-dress dances and many other fes-
tivities are held. A small dance is also held every Thursday
in the hotel. Close by are the grounds. of the Sporting Club.
