EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

canals ﬂow under endless avenues of scented mimosa, and
here and there below the broad branches of the lebbek-tree
the sakkieh (the primitive water-wheel so characteristic of
Egypt), turned by a slow, plodding “ gamoose,” drones out
its monotonous note.

The villages, their mosque domes and slender white minarets
rising from a mass of rich verdure, even the waste and
desolate parts, undrained of the salt that has impregnated
the land in years of careless watering—in all this there is a
certain atmosphere, a quiet clearness, especially in the
early morning, and even a variety which Upper Egypt does
not afford.

Some of the towns and villageswnear Mansourah espe-
cially—stand high above the surrounding country. Prob-
ably the mounds on which they are built were themselves
small towns, Roman, Greek, and Egyptian, the one above
the other. At Mehallet-Kebir. a most attractive town, and
at Samanoud, near it, quite a number of such things as
coins, lamps, small ﬁgures, scarabs, &c., are found from
time to time.

We cannot suppose that the traveller is likely to devote
much time to the Delta, but we can at least show him in
the pages following this what are its features and interests,
and give him a general 1mpression of them. If he wishes to
know Egypt as it really is, he should not forget that Lower
Egypt presents it in its most characteristic, and perhaps
most charming, aspect. Upper Egypt may be the land of
the mighty dead ; Lower Egypt is the land of their humbler
successors.

A visit can be made to most places in the Delta in a day
from Cairo or from Alexandria. Besides the State railways,
which serve all the larger places, a network of light railways
(worked by the Delta Light Railway Company and the
Basse- Egypte Company) traverse the ﬁelds and connect
village to village. If one has a day to spare, a trip by the
light railway 1s certainly well worth doing.

BILBEIS

Bilbeis is rather out of the beaten track, and, as it now
stands, offers no particularly absorbing sight. It has a
slight historical interest as having resisted Ammrath, King
of Jerusalem, with great vigour in 1126 A.D. It contained
