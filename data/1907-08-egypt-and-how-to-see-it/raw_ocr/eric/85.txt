UPPER EGYPT

 

the upper and lower country under one monarchy and
founded the twelfth dynasty. The thirteenth, fourteenth.

Ruins at Thebes

During the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth dynasties
Thebes was again of the ﬁrst importance. and its kings
devoted much of their energies to building temples and
other great works. It was apparently the capital of all
Egypt at this time, except during the reign of Amcnhotep I V.,
who started the sun-worship heresy and changed his capi-
tal to Tel-el-Amarna. After the twentieth dynasty Thebes
gradually declined, although many kings, right down to the
time of the Ptolemies, made spasmodic efforts at building.

Monuments and Antiquities of Luxor.——Three days at
least are required to see the most interesting of the temples
and tombs, but a week or more can be very pleasantly spent
here, and many people stay the Whole winter, so as to make
the most of the warm, dry climate.
