At Atbara Junction, where the boat express passes on to
the main line about 10.30 A.M. on Saturday, passengers
may enjoy the luxury of a bath for the moderate sum of
10 pt.

The down boat express from Khartoum leaves at 9.15
P.M. on Tuesdays, reaching Port Sudan on Wednesdays
shortly after 8 PM. The steamer leaves at 11 o’clock next
morning, so that there is time for travellers to inspect the
