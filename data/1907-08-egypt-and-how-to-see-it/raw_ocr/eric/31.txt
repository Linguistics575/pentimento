CAIRO

The shepkeepers are very civil and zealous to engage
the attention of all possible buyers. One has to bargain in
most cases, but it is a genial process, sweetened by man
cups of coﬁee, Persian tea, sherbet of sundry kinds, Turkis
delight, cigarettes, and suchlike delicacies, and if the pur-
chaser knows the value of the objects he is buying he can
be certain of procuring them at their pr0per price.

On the other (right-hand) side of the Mousky there is a
street leading off to the right (exactly opposite the one to
the left mentioned above); it widens, and eventually, after
various turnings, reaches the Bab-el-Zouileh, whence one can
reach the town by Mohammed Aly Street. In this street and the
turnings off it are the scent bazaars, and various small shops
where one can buy the native blue cloth and other attractive
stuﬁs. But the sellers are all natives here, and very few of
them understand English. Instead of turning to the right
at the Bab-el-Zouileh, one can go almost straight on into a
covered street, where are shoes, native saddlery, and various
kinds of leather work. An archway on the right-hand side
is the entrance to a courtyard oﬁ which is a tent-maker’s
shopu—the street, indeed, is called the Market of the Tent-
makers (Souk-el-Kheyamieh). In the shop in question is
sold the Akmim cloth, a species of tapestry depicting ancient
Egyptian ﬁgures of all sorts—animals, men, boats—~and every
sort of design, in gay colouring. There is a sword bazaar up
the Mohammed Aly Street, where are all kinds of weapons.

The chief shops in the Mousky bazaar are: Khauchand
(Turkish bazaar), Elias Habib (brass bazaar), Joseph Cohen
(a very excellent shop for carpet, embroidery, &c., and perhaps
the best place for precious stones). Malluk and Hatoun are
the names of two big merchants in the Mousky Street. Malluk
has a large collection of mushrabiyeh (or lattice) woodwork,
inlaid work, 850.

Cabs from the Opera Square to the bazaars, 5 pt. ; or return,
after waiting, 15 pt.

 

MOSQUES

The mosques of Cairo represent some of the ﬁnest
examples of Oriental architecture, though many of the
older buildings have been allowed to fall into a sad state of
disrepair. Acommittee has, however, been formed to under-
take their preservation, and under its auspices considerable
