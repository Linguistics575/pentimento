EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

these are, however, frequently crowded with excursionists.
A very pleasant private picnic can be arranged by chartering
for the day a motor- launch from Messrs. E. P. Blattner and
Co. Telephone No. 443 Cairo. The charge is LE4 per
day, and the boat holds twelve pe0ple comfortably. The
river trip takes about two hours. .

From the Barrage station there is a trolley line which goes
through all the gardens and to all the weirs. This is a novel
and pleasing method of progression: the trolleys hold four
peOple (more comfortably two), and are pushed by two
Arab boys. The fares are:

The Nile, which formerly entered the sea through seven
mouths, has now but two—the Damietta and Rosetta
branches, these diverge north- east and north- west respec-
tively, from a point a short distance north of Cairo. Just
below the point of divergence the barrage is built across
both branches ; its object is to hold up the level of the water
in the Nile so as to allow it to enter three great canals—the
Rayah (canal) Tewﬁkieh, Rayah Menuﬁeh, and Rayah
Behira, Which commence at this point. They provide water
for, and allow of navigation to, almost all parts of the Delta.

The Barrage Was one of the great experiments of. Moha mmed
Aly. The plans were drawn up by Mougel Bey 1n 1835 , it
took twenty years to build and cost £800,.000 On com-
