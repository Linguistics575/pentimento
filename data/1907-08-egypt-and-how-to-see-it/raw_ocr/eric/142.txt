EGYPT. AND How'ro “SEE IT

 

yet to reopen these mines, but no one can say what future
eﬁorts may not discover in so rich a ﬁeld.

Sarbut-el-Khédem is the centre of that long-dead industry.
close to Wady-Nasb, where the mines were situated. and
here are ruins of columns, and stelse with inscriptions. There
was also a small temple dedicated to Hathor, Lady of Mafkat
(or the Turquoise Land), and on its walls were records and
reliefs.

The traveller who wishes to study the Sinaitic Peninsula
fully will find valuable information in various works. We
may quote the Palestine Exploration Fund survey as one
of the best. also Professor Hull’s “ Mount Seir, Sinai ”
(London, 1885), Dean Stanley’s “ Sinai and Palestine ” and
“ Ancient History from the Monuments of Sinai,” and last,
but by no means least in value and interest. Professor Wallis
Budge’s edition of “ Cook’s Guide-Book ” (1904).

THE CASES

The oases are small patches of fertile land surrounded by
desert. Some of them are of considerable extent and have
a resident population; others consist of a few palm-trees
only, clustered round a single spring. A chain of these
oases runs parallel to the valley of the Nile, and from a hun-
dred to two hundred miles from it. It is supposed that they
indicate the former course of the river.

In ancient history many of the oases were of considerable
importance. Herodotus mentions them as the “ Islands of
the Blest," and the ancient Egyptian name, “ Nabet,” signified
a place of mummies, in that the legend claimed that the
jackal-headed Anubis conducted the spirits of the dead
from their tombs in the valley across the mountains and
desert to their paradise.

The principal oases, from north to south. are: (l) Siwa, or
Jupiter Ammon, which is about twenty davs’ journey west
of Cairo; (2) Bahrieh, opposite Minieh; (3) Farafra, oppo-
site Assiut; (4) Dakhel and (5) Kharga. due west of Esneh.
but approached from Farshout; (6) Kurkur, north-west of
Kom Ombo ; and (7) Selima, south-west of Wadi-Halfa.

It is hardly the province of this book to describe these
expeditions and their objects at length. They entail special
journeys of several days by camel. They are, of course,
highly interesting, but hardly feasible for the majority of
Visitors.
