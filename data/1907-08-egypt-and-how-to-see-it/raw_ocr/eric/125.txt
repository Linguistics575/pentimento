THE DELTA

 

ﬂows past the curious old houses ; steps descend to the water.
Every house has its boat, it is the Venice or Amsterdam of
Egypt, and has the charm of all such river-side cities. Behind
and above the row of houses at the waterside are minarets,
roofs, mosques, a wide extent of buildings; for Damietta is
a town of some size, and has notable bazaars.
Damietta has a history of its own. It was the gate of
mediaeval Egypt long be-
fore it had eclipsed Pe- ..

lost it, and the Sultan El-
Metounkel fortiﬁed it six

the intrusion of Christian
warriors: Roger of Sicily
in 1165, others in 1217.
St. Louis in 1248. All
these attacks were fol-

Arabs destroyed the
ancient city and rebuilt

Matarieh. Matarieh, a fair-sized village which has just
suffered severely from a ﬁre (April 1907), is the termin-
ation of the “ Basse Egypte ” Light Railway, which starts
from Mansourah.

The lake is shallow, and is largely fed by the Nile. In
ﬂood time the whole of what was the Pelusian Plain is under
water. The lake is remarkable for the myriads of birds of
