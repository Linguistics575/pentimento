ALEXANDRIA

 

world of Europe was lately apprised of the fact that the city
had at last been found by two German savants, the Rev.
C. M. Kaufmann and Mr. Edward Falls. After arduous
search they arrived, thanks to the chance indications of a
Bedouin boy who had discovered a singularly perfect ampulla,
at the site of the city.

" On excavating they discovered four basilicas, the crypt
of St. Menas, the great baptistery, and many other sacred
buildings and baths. The basilica of the emperor must
have been a most impressive structure. It was covered
with marble and supported by ﬁfty columns. A quantity
of beautifully sculptured capitals still remains. There is
also a series of sepulchral chambers underground. The
tomb and the crypt are also interesting, and must have been
beautifully decorated with mosaics. In the holy well, a
great cistern eighty-six metres long, have been discovered
thousands of ampullae.

“The Monastery or Koinobion of St. Menas—the most
interesting of all the remains—was the ﬁnest in the whole of
Northern Africa.

“When the city was ﬁrst discovered the site was covered
with a series of low mounds. There was not a wall or trace
of a building to be seen. But since this part began to be
excavated great progress has been made, in spite of the
difﬁcult nature of the work. The pavements of ﬁfty rooms,
corridors, and halls have been unearthed at from four to
ﬁve metres underground. Entering by a portico, which was
formerly vaulted, the visitor can inspect a series of rooms.
Two courts with large cisterns have been opened up, and a
great deal of marble and blocks of ﬁne granite-—the latter
probably from Taposiris Magma—are to be seen. In this
part of the convent some curious little statues of monkeys
were found. In the baths of the Koinobion numbers of
amphorae and ampullae for holy water were discovered, many
of them with inscriptions. The Rev. C. M. Kaufmann
considers,-from the various pottery ovens found here, that
all the ampullae of St. Menas which have been found else-
where, such as at Kom - e1 - Shougafa, were made in the
factory here, for over eighty different kinds of ampullae have
been found lately in the ruins, and many thousands more
are still buried in the earth. Among other noteworthy
buildings are the baths connected with the baptistery. They
were ﬁtted with waiting-rooms and supplied from large
