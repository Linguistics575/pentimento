EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

The service is very primitive, consisting chieﬂy in long
extracts from the Scriptures, according to the ritual for the
day, read by the priest in either Coptic or Arabic. The
priest is attired in a long black robe, and wears a fez, round
which is wound a turban of black cloth. This is a relic of the
Old days when, according to the laws imposed upon them
by their Arab conquerors, the Copts were obliged to wear
this dress to distinguish them from the Moslems. They are
generally assisted in the service by boys, who form the choir,
carry the censer, and help to read the prayers.

The majority of the ancient Coptic churches are to be
found in Old Cairo. The best way to reach them is by the
tram which goes down the Sharia-el-Ainv, starting originally
from the Ataba El-Kadra, near the Post Ofﬁce (the “ Clapham
Junction ” of all the trams). The road is lined with private
houses as far as Kasr-el-Ainy Government HOSpital, near
which is the Kasr-el-Ainy Mosque, where are the Howling
Dervishes. Just before reaching the Aqueduct (built in 1518
A.D.) a road turns off to the left, passes the old English
cemetery, and leads to the Convent of St. Menas (Deir Mari
Mena), marked off from the other buildings by a small cross
on a little belfry. It is surrounded by a wall, in which is a
gateway leading to a courtyard. Another doorway Opposite
opens on to a little court, and thence into the precincts of
the church.

Outside the entrance are the boots of the few worshippers
attending the service. The walls of the apartment are
whitewashed, and on two sides are some Old pictures repre-
senting the Virgin Mary, the Cruciﬁxion, and other scenes
from the New Testament; Opposite is a kind of balcony
reached by a pair Of movable steps. The ﬂoor is covered by
a well-worn carpet, bordered by rush matting. In the centre
is a small well containing water, with which, on the Thursday
of Holy Week, the priest performs the ceremony of washing
the feet of his congregation; Opposite this are a pair of
burning tapers in rude candlesticks, and close to them a
lectern. From the beams in the roof, suspended by ropes.
are glass candelabra of common but no doubt ancient work-
manship. Around the walls are pictures of saints. In the
centre is a reading-desk, with a large Bible, printed in Coptic
characters down the centre, with Arabic translation at the
side. On the left hand, separated by a screen, is the sanc-
tuary containing the altar.
