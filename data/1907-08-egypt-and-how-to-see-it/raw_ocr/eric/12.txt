EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

is quite adequate. though it is best to take a few thick things
as well. Moreover, Cairo is quite as fashionable, from the
point of view of dress, as a EurOpean capital, and affords
plentv of occasions for wearing smart clot-hes.

Cairo has plenty of shops, and one can procure almost any-
thing necessary. The prices are in some cases a little higher
than in EurOpe. Special outﬁts, tropical helmets, smoked
. glasses, green veils, &c., are really never wanted in winter,
except once in a way for an excursion in the desert on a very
hot- day. Sometimes at Luxor or Assouan, or for Sakkara, one
requires a little protection against glare and sun, even in the
cold weather, but never in Cairo, Alexandria, or in most parts
of Egypt for that matter. For such requirements Cairo
affords quite as good, if not better, choice than can be found
in London.

A luncheon- and tea-basket is useful, and should certainly
be brought. .

Amateur photographers can procure ﬁlms at any of the
chief tourist resorts at reasonable prices (Cairo, of course,
has several photographers’ shops), and they can have their
photographs developed, or can do this themselves in the
dark-rooms provided in most of the hotels.

Those who wish to do any shooting had better not bring
cartridges, as most steamship companies put difﬁculties in
the way of the transport of small quantities of ammunition.
Cartridges can be obtained in Alexandria and Cairo. For
shooting licences and other particulars see page 171.

Visitors can, if they wish, hire very good private carriages
for the whole or part of their stay, and can almost always
ﬁnd a coachman who knows some English.

Motorists who bring their cars will ﬁnd good roads in and
about Cairo and Alexandria, but that will be-about their
limit. The country roads are primitive, and in most cases
quite impossible for motoring. There are several good
garages in Alexandria and Cairo. For particulars as to
licence and other information see page 170.

From January to the middle of March the hotels are apt
to be full, and one should engage rooms beforehand by letter,
or there may be trouble on arrival. Full information as to
hotels, &c., is given on page 155 et seq., and references will be
found in the various articles on Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor,
Assouan, &c. &c.
