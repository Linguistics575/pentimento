THE SUDAN

“ At preSent the population of the Sudan has not been
demoralised by indiscriminate almsgiving, but it will not
require much of this to make the demand “ Bakshz'sh .’ ” as im-
portunate and annoying to travellers as in Egypt itself, and“
to cause a considerable number of natives to forsake the'
paths of honest industry for the unwholesome existence of
preying upon others.

“ His Excellency the Governor-General trusts that all
travellers will consider this as a personal request from him-
self, and at the same time would inform them that if they
desire to give any money for the beneﬁt of the inhabitants,
contributions for hospitals or relief of poverty, assistance
to the sick, and relief of deserving cases amongst the poorer
classes will be carefully administered by the Governors, and
he himself will gratefully receive contributions for what is the
Sudan’s greatest need, viz., education.

“ By Order of the Governor-General.
“ (Signed) F. J. NASON, Lewa.”

 

There are two routes: to the Sudan—the Nile route and the
Red Sea route.

between the great Assouan dam and the second cataract at
Wadi-Halfa, is performed by three lines of river steamers——
Blessrs. Cook and Sons’, The Hamburg and Anglo-American
Company’s, and the Sudan Government steamers.

ment steamers will leave Shellal on Fridays and Tuesdays,
arriving at Halfa on Sundays and Thursdays. The landing-
stage at Halfa is opposite the railway station, and- there is
an hotel adjacent. 7
