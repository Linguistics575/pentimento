UPPER EGYPT

 

interesting; it is remarkable for the extreme freshness of
the colouring.

THE COLOSSI 0F MEMNON

These stand in cultivated land about a mile to the north-
west of the landing-stage. The two enormous statues repre-
sent Amenhotep III. in a sitting position, and are 52 ft. high.

Although much damaged by time and the Nile ﬂood, the
Colossi are amongst the most remarkable monuments of
ancient Egypt. Their size is all the more apparent on the
level plain. Originally they adorned the front of a temple
founded by Amenhotep, but of this little or nothing remains.

The northernmost of the two ﬁgures excited considerable
interest and discussion in Roman times, as at sunrise the
statue is said to have emitted a musical note, of which many
explanations have been given. Strabo, Pausanias, and
J uvenal mention the fact ; Strabo, however, was sceptical as
to its supernatural origin.

DISTRIBUTION OF TIME

The question of what to see ﬁrst will depend largely on the
amount of time at the disposal of the visitor. In three days
one can devote a little time to each point of interest, while
some of the most important monuments can be seen in one
long day’s expedition. In this case both guides and donkey-
boys will probably want extra money. The following arrange
ments are suggested for those with one, two, or three days at
their disposal.

One Day

Start from Luxor at 8.30 A.M., and cross the river. Ride
to the temple of Seti I. at Kurna, from there to the Tombs of
the Kings at Biban-el-Muluk. After exploring two or three
of the tombs—say those of Seti I., Rameses III., and Amen-
hotep III. (Nos. 17, 11, and 35)—ride over the hill to the
temple of Queen Hatasu at Deir-el-Bahari and return to the
landing-stage, stopping on the way to see the Ramesseum
and the Colossi of Memnon. Lunch is taken at Luxor, and
the afternoon can be devoted to the temples of Luxor and
Karnak.
