THE ()ASES

 

The Oasis of Siwa, or Jupiter Ammon, is about six miles
in length and four or ﬁve broad. Herodotus tells us that
Cambysis sent a force of 50,000 men to enslave its in-
habitants and burn their temple, but a great sandstorm
engulfed and destroyed them. Alexander the Great visited
this oasis, and was, the legend says, well received by Ammon,
the god thereof. It is certain that it was occupied and forti-
ﬁed, probably as far back as the nineteenth dynasty, and
many memorials and reliefs are found there to support this.
The present pOpulation is about 7000. The two principal
towns are Siwa and Akermi, which are usually at feud with
one another.

It is perhaps as well for those wishing to visit this oasis
to apply to the authorities in Cairo, though nowadays there
is little likelihood of any difﬁculty arising to prevent expe-
ditions.

The Oasis of Bahrieh, or Northern Oasis, is four or ﬁve
days’ easy journey from the Fayoum. The population in
1897 was 6000.

The Farafra Oasis is midway between Bahrieh and
Dakhel; its population is about 540. It is of very small
area, and can never have been very ﬂourishing. There are a
certain number of rock tombs to the north, possibly Roman.
It can be reached from Minieh in eight days on a good camel.

The Oasis of Dakhel is seven days from Assiut, or four
days from the Farafra Oasis. It has over 17,000 inhabitants.
3000 of these living in its chief village, El-Kasr (the fort).
There are the ruins of a temple of the Roman period.
dedicated to Ameri-Ra or Horus of Behutet by Titus and
other emperors (nowadays called Deir-el-Hargar, or the
Convent of Stone). The Romans kept a small garrison here,
and probably it was frequented by recluses in the third.
fourth, and ﬁfth centuries A.D. Its date trade is fairly con-
siderable.

The Oasis of Kharga—the Great Oasis—is about four
days’ camel-ride from Farsliout. Recently the Western
()ases Company have started boring operations for artesian
wells, with a View to putting a larger area under cultivation.
A narrow-gauge railway is also being constructed from the
Nile valley (Kharga Junction on the State railways) to
Kharga, the capital of the oasis, a distance of about 100
miles. It is hoped that communication will be complete
by the winter of 1907—8.

The oasis has a population of about 7000, and there are
