be recommended to procure either Baedeker’s “ Egypt ”
(price 158.) or Cook’s “ Egypt .and the Soudan ” (Professor

every possible detail.

Egyptian Money.—The Egyptian pound consists of 100
piastres. A piastre (pt.) is worth about 2%., 25 centimes,
or 5 cents.

English and French gold, particularly the former, are in -
circulation everywhere. An English sovereign is worth
97% pt. ; a French napoleon is worth 77 pt.

 

RAILWAY ARRANGEMENTS

Many pe0ple are surprised when they come to Egypt to
ﬁnd a railway system which can compare in most particulars
with those of Europe and America. There are some 1500
miles of railway, with about 270 stations, under State manage-
ment, besides a large number of light railways.

The most important trains are composed of large double-
bogie corridor carriages of the latest design, lighted by elec-
tricity or gas. On all the principal expresses dining- or
luncheon-cars are provided, and for the longer journeys
sleeping-cars; these are of the well-known type used all
over Europe, and are run under an arrangement with the
Wagon-Lits Company.

There are three classes of carriages ,; the thirds, however,
are somewhat diﬁerent from those in England, and it is very
unusual to see a European travelling third class. Fares are,
on the whole, considerably cheaper than those of English
railways. A short journey costs more in proportion than a.
long one. The second-class fare is half the ﬁrst-class, and
the third half the second.

Return tickets are not issued at present, except on one or
two of the suburban lines. No luggage is carried free, except
that which is taken by the passenger into the carriage.
Special trains, saloons, and the conveyance of carriages or
motor-cars can be arranged for at short notice ; particulars
on these points are given on page 197.
