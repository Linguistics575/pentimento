UPPER EGYPT

of the twent -second dynasty, in Palestine. He it was who
defeated Re oboam and spoiled Jerusalem and Solomon’s
temple. The following is the passage in Scripture (1 Kings
xiv. 25—26) :

The Archway of Euerg'etes, Kamak

“ And it came to pass in the ﬁfth year of King Rehoboam
that Shishak, King of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem.
And he took away the treasures of the House of the Lord.
and the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away

all : and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon
had made.”

Deciphered from a stele found at Karnak is the following
address by the god Amen to King Thothmes III. :

“ I come, I grant unto thee to overwhelm the princes of'
Zahi: I throw them beneath thy feet through all their
borders. I show unto them thy majesty, as of the Lord of
Light, when thou shinest above their heads even as mine
image.
