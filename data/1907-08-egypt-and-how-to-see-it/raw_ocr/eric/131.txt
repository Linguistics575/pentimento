ALEXANDRIA

 

THE MUSEUM

The Museum is situated in a turning off the Rue Rosette.
It is under the care of Dr. Botti, and contains many anti-
quities, principally of the Graeco-Roman period.

MARIOUT RAILWAY

To the west of Alexandria is the terminus of H.H. the
Khedive’s railway. The line runs south-westwards parallel
to the coast for a distance of about 110 miles.

There are many Bedouin settlements on the way, and the
country, which a few years ago was waste land and desert,
is becoming p0pulated, and now thrives under the inﬂuence
of the railway.

RUINS OF ST. MENAS

The ruins of the city of St. Menas, the patron saint of Chris-
tian Egypt, were, strange to say, only discovered two years
ago by the researches of German archaeologists. The city is
a few hours’ ride to the north of Behig, a station on H.H. the
Khedive’s railway. We owe the information given here to
the courtesy of Rowland Snelling, Esq., of Alexandria, who
wrote two admirable articles on the discoveries at Mariout
in the Egyptian Gazette for April 17 and 20, 1907.

“ Mariout was a species of Egyptian Lourdes, a city of
pilgrimage. The pilgrims used to bear away terra-cotta
ampullae or ﬂasks of the holy water of St. Menas. Some of
these ﬂasks are to be found in every museum in Europe.
St. Menas was martyred in Phrygia in 296 A.D. His body
was brought to Alexandria and placed on a camel, and the
beast allowed to wander as he chose. He stopped near Lake
Mareotis. A tomb was built there which possessed miracu-
lous powers. Followed a church and then a town. A great
basilica was erected in'the reign of Arcadius (395-408 A.D.).

“ The earliest extant account of it is from an unknown
Arab traveller, who visited it probably in the tenth century.
The description is contained in a manuscript in the Paris
Library, and is as follows: ‘ Leaving Tarraneh and follow-
ing the road towards Barca, one comes to Mena, which con-
sists of three abandoned towns in the midst of a sandy desert,
