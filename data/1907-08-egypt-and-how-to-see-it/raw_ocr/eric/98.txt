LUXOR T0 ASSOUAN

At Luxor the line changes to narrow gauge, but the same
tradition of comfort is, as far as possible, maintained in the
trains; the windows are ﬁtted with smoked glass to counter-
act the glare, and a luncheon-car is attached to the train.

The journey takes six and a half hours.

At Luxor station there is not only a buffet, but even baths
for the dusty.

The best trains leave Luxor at 10.30 A.M. and Assouan at
10.15 A.M. in connection with the trains de luxe and night
mail from and to Cairo.

The time-tables are given on pages 182, 183.

The fares are:

Luxor-Assouan—lst class, 87% pt.
2nd ,, 44 ,,

For other fares see page 195.

Armant, the ﬁrst station after Luxor, is unenviably
notorious for a breed of dogs whose ferocity renders them
useful for watching but rather embarrassing as pets.

Near Maalla are the dazzling white limestone quarries
from which comes the stone for the Esneh barrage.

Matana, the next station, has a big sugar factory.
