OLD COPTIC CHURCHES

The old Coptic churches of Cairo are difﬁcult to ﬁnd, hidden
away in out-of—the-way corners, unsuspected by the unin-
itiated. No tapering spires or Gothic towers indicate their
presence. They are unpretentious buildings, very old, some-
what neglected-looking. They keep modestly out of sight,
as if the persecutions to which the CoPts were exposed in
bygone days have made them fearful of exposing themselves
to the broad light of day. A simple cross over the doorway
or on the t0p of some little belfry alone distinguishes them
from the other buildings which crowd upon and almost
overwhelm them.

Their interior has little architectural adornment. They
are very small, and can only contain a hundred or so of
worshippers at most. To make up for this, perhaps, three
churches are in some cases found together or only a few yards
apart. They are generally divided into three sections by
screens, running transversely across the church, and where
there is no gallery another screen forms a lateral division
which shuts off the women from the men: the sexes are
always kept apart.

At the very back, separated from the main body of the
church by a screen, is the nekal, or sanctuary, where is the
altar ; access to this is reserved for the priest and his assis-
tants and those about to take Communion. Another curious
feature is the fact that there are no chairs or seats of any
kind. The few worshippers squat on the ﬂoor, or, at certain
parts of the service, stand, and as this wearies them in the
course of the almost interminable service they provide them-
selves with crutches upon which to lean.
