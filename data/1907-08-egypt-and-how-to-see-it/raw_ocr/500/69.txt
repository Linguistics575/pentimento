UPPER EGYPT

THE name " Upper Egypt " is applied to the country south
of Cairo as far as the Soudan frontier-near Wadi-Halfa.
Sometimes the name Middle Egvpt is used for the stretch
between Cairo and Assiout, south of which is Upper Egypt
proper. .

Above all things, those who visit this country, even if
only for a short time, should see Luxor and Assouan--.
ideally dry, warm and healthy, set in fine rugged hill scenery,
the home of monuments as wonderful as any the world
possesses ; they should be the principal goal of all travellers
in the " Land of Khem."

The time-honoured highway is, of course, the Nile. Tourist
steamers (for which, see page 203) pass up and down fre-
quently; wealthy visitors may hire a private sailing, or,
better still, a steam dahabeah (or house-boat), but the rail-
way has been so greatly improved lately as to be acknow-
ledged the most comfortable and convenient route. The river
journey has, of course, its pleasures and even luxuries, but it
can become tedious, and steamers are sometimes over-
crowded.
