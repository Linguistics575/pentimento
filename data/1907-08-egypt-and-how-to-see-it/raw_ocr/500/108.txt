EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

Assouan has, besides its ancient monuments, one great
modern ''iuiii'iliiiii'Cihi,' Dam. This should certainly be
visited. It is at the upper end of the cataract, at Shellal.
about six miles by rail south of Assouan. This work, com-
pleted in 1902, was four years in the building, and has had
a tremendous effect on the prosperity of Egypt. The river

above the dam slopes upwards, but very gently, so that an
immense reservoir is formed, stretching south for 120 miles. 1
In winter, when the river is high, some of the water is held
back and the reservoir gradually filled. At low Nile, in the
spring and summer, when Egypt has hardly enough water
to save herself from absolute drought, the sluices are opened ',
and the supply augmented, until, as the river begins to rise
for the next flood, the reservoir is empty. I
The Dam is 2180 yds. long, 131 ft. high, and at present holds l
up the water 65 ft. It is built of the red Assouan granite 1
used by the ancients for their most lasting memorials. i
The ancient history of Assouan is graven on its rocks.
