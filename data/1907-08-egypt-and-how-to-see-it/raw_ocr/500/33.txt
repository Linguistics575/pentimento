the tomb of the Khedive Ismail. It was built during his
reign. '

The Mohammed Aly Mosque is actually inside the precincts
of the Citadel. Its domed cupola and two slender, graceful
minarets are more conspicuous than anything else in Cairo.
From any and every point of view the mosque stands out,
boldly Oriental, against the dull, dead grey-brown of the
hills behind it, dominating Cairo. The mosque was built
by Mohammed Aly, the founder of the present Khedivial
dynasty; the architect was a Greek from Constantinople.
In the court is a fountain, and in the tower to the west is a
clock presented to Mohammed Aly by Louis Philippe of
France. The interior of the mosque is not very imposing,
and the large number of hanging lamps has a rather tawdry
effect. The columns and walls are of alabaster up to a
certain height. To the right is the tomb of Mohammed Aly,
enclosed by a railing.

To the east of the Mohammed Aly Mosque is the so-called
" Josephâ€™s Well." It is 290 ft. deep, and on it, in former
days, the Citadel depended for its water-supply. Round the
well-shaft winds a passage, cut through the rock ; half-way
down is a platform where was formerly the water-wheel, or
saklcieh, driven by oxen, which raised the water to the surface.

It is said that when the Citadel was built in the twelfth
century Saladin Yusuf discovered the well full of sand and
caused it to be cleared. It is called after him, andnot after
the J oseph of Scripture.

The Ibn Touloun Mosque, built in 879 A.D., is the oldest
in Cairo. The walls are of brick, coated with stucco.

The Kait Bey Mosque (fifteenth century), near the Ibn
Touloun, is small, but has a most graceful minaret. On the
pulpit is some fine carving, and the mosaics on the walls
and floor are worth notice.

These mosques will probably take up all the morning.

 

The Mousky Mosques-all-Azhar Mosque is in the Sharia
El-Halwagi, a turning off the Sharia Mousky. It dates from
972 A.D., in which year Gawhar completed it. In 988 A.D.
it was converted into a university, the largest to-day in the
Mohammedan world. It has students (about eight thousand
in all) from every country, and over two hundred professors.
The subjects are, first and foremost, the Koran and its com-
mentaries, and then the " profane " subjects studied in the
