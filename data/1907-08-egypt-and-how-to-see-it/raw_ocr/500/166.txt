MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION

EGYPTIAN MONEY

THE monetary system of Egypt rests, since 1885, on a single gold standard,
with subsidiary silver, nickel, and copper coins. The unit is the Egyptian
pound, worth approximately £1 os. 6d.‘in English money. The Egyptian pound
is divided into 100 piastres and the piastre into 10 milliemes.

Practically the only gold coin in circulation is the English sovereign, which
is worth 971 piastres and passes everywhere. There are a few Egyptian and
. Turkish 100-piastre and 50-piastre pieces and French napoleons in circulation,

but these are seldom met with.

The National Bank of Egypt issues notes of the value of LEIOO, LE50
LEIO, LE5, LE1 and 50 piastres. The following Egyptian coins are in
circulation :
