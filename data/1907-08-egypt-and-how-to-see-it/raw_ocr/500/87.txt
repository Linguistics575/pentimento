UPPER EGYPT

 

columns in rows of eight. Many of these are exceedingly
well preserved, and on the under sides of the capitals a good
deal of the original colouring remains, still brilliant, testi-
fying to the wonderful lasting power of the colours used by
the Egyptians, and giving some idea of the gorgeous appear-
ance these old temples must have presented when every
inch of column, wall, and ceiling was covered with highly
coloured sculptures of gods and kings.

To the south of the hall of columns are several smaller
chambers; and in the centre of these was the sanctuary of
the god.

Several of the other rooms are interesting, espeeialy one
called the " Birth Chamber." Its walls bear reliefs depicting
the birth of Amenhotep III. Another chamber, adapted
apparently by Alexander. son of Alexander the Great, has
reliefs of its builder worshipping Amen; another shows signs

THE TEMPLES OF KARNAK

There is a good road from Luxor, and carriages can be
taken. The excursion may also be made on donkeys (price
5 pt.).

Besides the great temple of Amen, there are at Karnak
several smaller temples, of which those of Mut and Khons
are the most; important. First the immense archway of
Euergetes is seen in the distance, and the road passes between
rows of sphinxes, and then appears the temple of Khons.

III. and his successors to the honour of the Theban moon-
god Khons, son of Amen and Mut.

It consists of the usual colonnade court, hypostyle hall,
and sanctuary. Parts are well preserved, and the inscrip-

the goddess Apet and of Osiris, which is worth examining.

Two hundred yards to the north is the great temple of
