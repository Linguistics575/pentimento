colours. The hills-the Mokattam range-appear as a grim
blue-black wall, with intense black depths and profound
shadows.

Those who stay at Helouan, if not invalids, will find a
fair amount of occupation. There are two or three race
meetings and sometimes a gymkhana during the season. Of
an evening dances and concerts are held from time to time
at the hotels or Casino. The Survey -Department Obser-
vatory, which is the Greenwich of Egypt, is high up on the
hill at the back, and deserves a visit. There are wadies or
valleys to be explored; purely torrential gullies, full of
stones, great and small, carried down by the rush of water
from the hills. A few tracks of hare or gazelle appear. A
little sparse vegetation-starved, stunted shrubs-shows
that moisture now and again exists in these clefts. They
give a curious effect of winding desolation.

There is some tennis to be had, and there is also the golf
course, with noble hazards. True, the heavy sand here and
there and the unduly fast " greens " are occasionally exas-
perating, but the joy of the three or four difficult " carries,"
the delight at a fine iron-shot taken clean and full off the
difficult surface-tUse are compensations. It is a real test,
of good golf.

To give a few practical details: Helouan is about fifteen
miles south of Cairo, on the eastern bank of the Nile. The
town stands in the desert two hundred feet above the river.
Bab-el-Louk is the station for Helouan; it is about five
minutes' drive from the Savoy Hotel and eight minutes
from the Opera Square. The journey takes about half an
hour by the fast trains. The time-table will be found on
page 189. Helouan's sunshine average is high-about eight
hours per day from November to April-and the average
temperature about 60° Fahrenheit. It seldom falls below
60'' or rises above 72°. There is scarcely ever any rain.

Helouan is a great place for throat, lung, and digestion
troubles; the fine, pure, dry air is about the best remedy
possible for these. It has also an excellent bath establish-
ment; the water comes from various thermal springs that
rise in the desert. It is stronger than any sulphur-water in
Europe, and is known in the medical world for its. wonderful
curative powers in cases of stiff joints, rheumatoid arthritis.
sciatica. chronic gout, and skin affections.

Hotels-There are several first-class hotels at Helouan,
