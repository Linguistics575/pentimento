EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

to have been the only attempt to escape from the influence
of the all-powerful Theban priesthood of Amen-Ra. He
preferred the worship of a single deity (the sun) to the
isolytheism of his predecessors, changed his name to Khu-

of Amen-Rii from the walls of his sanctuaries. The priests

son of Men, was employed to build a magnificent royal city,
adorned with splendid temples, and containing a palace for
the king. This city was called Elrhut-Aterr-" The Horizon
of the Sun."

Besides being a religious reformer, the king appears to
have encouraged the advance of art. Under his patronage
the enlightened Bek produced some exceedingly fine work,
of which an example is preserved in the beautiful stucco
pavements which formed part of the king's palace, and which

of Mesopotamia and other Asiatic countries. These show
that the king's other interests had so monopolised him
that he was neglecting the affairs of the empire.

Amenhotep passed the remainder of his life quietly at the
new capital with his mother and wife and his seven daughters.
Soon after his death his successors returned to Thebes and
the thraldom of Amen ; the " City of the Sun '' was allowed
to fall into ruins, and art into its former convention.

many palm-trees, right under a big bluff of scarred, sandy
hill, it stands clear and clean against the plain, fortified from
