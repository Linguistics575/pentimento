CAIRO

There are also two other churches here, close together,
but they do not call for any special remark.

One has now to return towards the Aqueduct, and to keep
to the east side of the Helouan railway for about a mile.
Just past the new Protestant cemetery is a high wall en-
closing a garden of palm-trees. and terminating in a small
dwelling-house, on the side of which is a plate bearing the
name of Chareh Gamehamr. In the corner formed by this
building and an old brick wall is a doorway which leads,
through winding lanes between the houses to the Der Abu
Sefen. This comprises three churches, one of which is being
restored, and contains a fine old ebony screen inlaid with
ivory, an altar casket which dates from the year 1280 A.D.,
and an altar in marble. It is in a better condition than the
church of Deir Mari Mena.

From Abu Sefen the way lies along the Helouan railway
line towards the village of Kasr-esh-Shamas, the inhabitants
of which are nearly all Copts. At the second level crossing
one must turn to the left. Nearly opposite is a short incline
leading towards a door in the wall, whence a narrow winding
path leads between the dwelling-houses to the church of Abu
Sergeh. It is larger than the others, though its size cannot
be properly appreciated as it is divided up by screens. On
the screen separating the sanctuary from the rest of the
church are some very fine old carvings. Underneath the
church is a crypt, older than the church itself, reached by a
dark flight of steps, where is oointed out an alcove where,
according to tradition, the Virgin Mary rested after the
flight into Egypt. It also contains an old baptismal font.

A little way further on is a new Greek church, circular in
shape. Passing round the side of this a narrow, winding
path leads to the beautiful little ch arch of St. Barbara.

J ust opposite St. George's railway station a large archway,
bearing inscriptions in Arabic, leads into a courtyard; from
the other side a broad flight of steps leads towards the church
El-Moallaka, much finer than any of the others. Above is
a, gallery for the women. with mushrabieh windows,through
which they can look but remain themselves unseen. The
screen dividing off the altar is a beautiful piece of work-
manship, being composed of carved ebony and cedar inlaid
with ivory. There are some very old pictures of saints and
one of the Virgin Mary, which is said to be nine hundred years
old. The most interesting object is, however, the pulpit,
