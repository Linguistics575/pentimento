EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

meetings are almost always crowded. The totaliBator is in
use (pari mutual), and tickets on the homes can be taken
for LE1, or by less wealthy backers for 20 pt. As the principle
of payment is the division of receipts, less the percentage due
to the totarvsatxe (which goes to the funds of the racing club),
one's winnings vary. A favourite whom every one supports
may not even pay back his full dollar, and outsiders backed
by a few only have been known to pay 60 to 1. Visitors can
become temporary members if introduced by a member of the
club; they should apply to the secretary. For subscription
and entrance to the grand stand on mee days see page 164.

Cab fares to the Sporting Club from Cairo: Single, 5pt.;
return, 15 pt. (waiting one hour). To the grand stand on
race days, return, 30 pt. (waiting three hours).

For particulars of other clubs see page 164.
