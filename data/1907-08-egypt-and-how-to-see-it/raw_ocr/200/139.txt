ISMAIIJA TO SUEZ

down the avenue that crosses the canal. There one may
well pause at the bridge. The bank is a mass of eolraur--
red. orange. white, and blue flowers. Below, the boats
lounge past under the trees.

Everything is lazy and peaceful, bathed in warm sunlight.
Here and there. down the road. appear neat small houses--
bungalows, rather; their verandahs, that tell of easy-going,
outdoor life, are gay with many-eoloured creepers. Here
are no Arab huts, no strenuous shops, nothing but acclima-

Then comes the lake-vivid, deep blue. The far-off Asian
bank is vivid golden sand, against which stands out the
least mark, shrubs or stumps of black wood. Even the
steamers, passing up and down, appear black in the keen
sunlight. It is all restful, full of calm light and colour.

ISMAILIA TO SUEZ

The journey takes about two hours, through desert land
all the way. Bordering the line are stretches of marsh. To
