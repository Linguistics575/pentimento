THE DELTA

 

sufficient wealth to occupy his army for three days in
pillage.

The town is as uninteresting as most Arab towns, but
the surrounding country is pretty-by the Ismailie Canal,
for instance, which is the barrier between the cultivated
land and the desert. Near the lock is the irrigation rest-
house, by itself-a most attractive spot in the evening
light. Behind it is a broad track of sand, then a few strag-
gling palms, then the desert, changing rapidly to violet its
the shadows lengthen. In the far distance is a line of low
hills, of the deepest purple. The canal, luminous in the
failing light with soft reflections, stretches straight in either
direction. High-masted boats move slowly down the stream.

There are many such attractive places in the Delta-the
road from Bilbeis to Abou Hammad, for example. It is
about sixteen miles, parallel with the canal bank. The
scenery consists of palm-trees, crops of all sorta, and here
and there a village. There is many a quaint Jakkieh, on
which a small boy or girl stands, like a charioteer, above the
horizontal wheel, yelling now and again and brandishing a,
stick to prevent the buffalo from going fast asleep.

The whole road is delightful, sunlit and sleepy. Now
and again a fat village notable passes on an equally fat
donkey, or a splendid derk-feced Bedouin on a fine mare,
a true hormumur--one would say a centaur but for the
flow of robes and the glistening girdle round the head-dress.

S&lhieh, again, and Komin, where the French fought, are
good plaees--big palm-groves at the end of all things, on the
border of the desert. At Salhieh one Walks straight away
from civilisation and the railway station on to the sand.
Only the line of telegraph posts to Kantareh breaks the
monotony. The yellow sand gleams, and the distant mounds
here and there fade and seem to take strange shapes in the
mirage of the strong sunlight. Now and again one comes
on a gipsy-faced woman tending a, few goats that nibble
the scarce, stunted shrubs. In the distance, perhaps, appears
a Bedouin C6wrbvan-s long string of camels, laden with a
miscellaneous assortment of wares-returning from Syria;
for Salhieh is on the old overland route to Asia used since
the time of the Pharaohs by just such caravans as one may
see to-day.
