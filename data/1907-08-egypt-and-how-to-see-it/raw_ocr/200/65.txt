THE FAYOUM

 

THE LABYRINTH AND LAHOUN

The "Labyrinth" and the Pyramid of Hawara are the
next objects of attraction, some six or seven miles away.
One should procure good donkeys, take a lunchebn- and tea-
basket-this the hotel can amu1ge-Hu1d start early. The
$g Labyrinth " is dilapidated enough now, but it must have
been a mighty monument in its time, if we may believe
Herodotus (and it is singular how often we can), and it mast
have eclipsed all other Egyptian buildings in size and mag-
nifitrenee. It seems to have been intended as a vast place of
assembly for the parliament of ancient Egypt, and, according
to Herodotus, it had twelve courts and three thousand
chambers, besides many halls, passages, and porticoes.
Huge single slabs formed the roofs of the chambers ; it had
great red granite or white limestone-as white as Pariah
marble-monolith; and many wonderful sculptures describing
the history, religion, and interests of the province to Which
each court was assigned.

The Pyramid of Hawara is half a mile away to the east ;
it is the tomb of Amenemhet In., and is attributed to that
king and his daughter Ptah-Nefert Many strange and
splendid relics were discovered therein, especially in the
vault of Horuta a great noble of the twenty-sixth dynasty.
These are now in the Cairo Museum.

Another great monument is the Lahoun Brick Pyramid,
an hour and a half distant and close to Lahoun village, with
its temple half a mile away ; this was built by Usertsen II.,
also of the twelfth dynasty. And more interesting still are
the traces of an ancient town of the same period, designed
and built espee1ully for the men at work on the pyramid and
temple, with rows of huts and storehouses. Last of all are
the remains of the old dykes and sluices that regulated the
exit and entry of the waters of Lake Moeris. One returns by
the 4.10 POI. train from Lahoun, to reach Medinet-eLFuyoum
at 5.20 Par.
