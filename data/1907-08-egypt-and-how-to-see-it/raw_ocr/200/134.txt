EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

cisterns twenty-two metres deep. A reservoir, forty by
seventy metres, has been found close by. In another part
of the Koinobion a dining-hall has been diaeoverred. It was
probably reserved for distinguished guests. Here was
found a magnifieent relief in white marble. The roof of
this hall was supported by columns, and the walls were
covered with marble and porphyry. The Rev. C. M. ILud.
mann informs us that, judging from the numerous fine
capitals which have of late been found on the west side of
the monastery, he hopes to come upon the church of St.
Thokla, which is mentioned in the life of the saint. This
church was within the Koinobion, and probably some highly
important discoveries will be made there."

A very pleasant excursion may be made to Aboukir, a
small village about ten miles east of Alexandria, along the
coast. It has much historical interest, both ancient and
modern. Near it stood the great city of Canopus in PtoleÂ»
maie times, and here the Canopic branch of the Nile entered
the sea. According to Seneca, Canopus was ehiefiy remark,
able for the luxury and depravity of its inhabitants.

In later times Aboukir is famous as giving its name to
Nelson's great battle and victory over the French Met in
1798. Napoleon defeated the Turkish army in 1799 at
Aboukir, and his army was defeated there by Sir Ralph
Abercrombie in 1801.
