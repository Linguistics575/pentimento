The Khediviel Library is situated in the Sharia Mohammad
Ali, on the left-hend side going towards the Citadel, about
fifteen minutes' walk from the Post Office. Tramways alsn
pass the door. It was founded by the late Khedive Ismail
Path, and removed in 1904 from somewhat unsuitable
quarters in the Darb-el-Gamemiz to the fine building which
it now occupies. It is open in winter every day except
Fridays and Mohammedan holidays from 8 A.M. till one
hour before sunset.

Admission is free, but to enter the reading-room and news-
paper-room a card is required, which is obtained free on
application to one of the attendants.

There are over sixty-six thousand volumes in the library.
Half of these are in European languages and deal with various
sabysi-history, geography, and the different sciences ;
the other half consists of books in Oriental languages. There
are more than thirteen thousand Arabic manuscripts.

In a. wing of the building especially set apart for them is
a very fine exhibition of illuminated Karena, dating for the
most part from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. This
collection numbers seven hundred in all, and is the finest in
existence.
