from which she drew water wherewith to wash the Child's
garment. Where she threw it, down balsam-plants sprang
up, so it is said. The balsaerees which originated from
these were said to grow nowhere else in Egypt, and no

Gospels also state that the idols of On fell down when the
Virgin and Child reached the city.

THE HELIOPOLIS OASIS

The phenomenal extension of Cairo in all directions induced
a group of financiers to start the scheme known as the " Helio-
polis Oasis‚Äù in 1905. Some five thousand acres of high-
lying desert land near R.H. the Khedive's Palace at Koubbeh
were procured, with the object of building a species of desert
pleasure city. The work is at this moment progressing
vigorously. A fine road connects Abbassieh with the kr Oasis."
and a motor service has been organised. An electric milwev
is also in process of construction, to connect the " Oasis ''
with Pent Limoun station, and a network of roads has been
laid out in the " city " iuself. Some fifty villas, and shops,
a station for the electric railway, a family hotel, a. casino in
Moorish style, and the Heliopolis Palace Hotel are in courso
of erection, and a large amount of work has already been
achieved.

The Palace Hotel has been conceived on a large scale.
It is in the Oriental style of architecture, and will have a
fine restaurant on each of its two stories, from whence is
obtained a wide view of the desert, the cultivation. and Cairo ;
