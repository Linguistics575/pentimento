EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

3.40 P.M., and passes through the most fertile and beautiful
part of the whole province. One can return by the State
Railway train, or by a. donkey.

 

LAKE KAROUN

We have already mentioned Lake Karoun ; but it requires
a special visit, even a. short stay of a. day or two. In the
winter there is a hotel open, under management delegated
from the Karoun Hotel at Medina; one should announce
one's arrival, by telegraph, the day before.

The station-Abel-y-is under an hour distant from
Medina; a train leaves the latter at 11.41 A.M. and arrives at
12.35 RM. There are vehicles of sorts in waiting. The drive
takes about an hour through a country-side pretty enough
in itself, and past picturesque villages, but all is dwarfed by
the panorama that reveals a stretch of fertile land, a gradual
slope, and then the lake-ls turquoise streak, silvery, shimmer
ing, under a pale luminous sky; beyond, the hills frame it,
pale rose and following one another, ramparts between desert
and water. The pale green, blue, rose, blend in a perfection
of vivid and intense colour.

The hotel is quaintly suited to its surroundings. There is
a row of roomy, square tents ranged on a stone platform
beside a stream that flows into the lake. The wind whispers
and rustles in the reeds that fringe the water. One would
expect that a tent on a stone fioorriag, close to the Waterside.
would prove it cold sleeping-place ; but it is quite comfort-
able, and indeed all the arrangements are good. The food
is not that of the great hotels, but it is by no means to be
despised. There are plenty of boats of various kinds, rowing
and sailing, that belong to the hotel.

The lake has still a fine extent of water, some eight miles
broad by thicty-five long, and one sees Gmingoes and pelicaus
in the distance, and quantities of duck and other waterfowl,
not always easy of approach. On the desert shore are jackals
and hyenas, though these are seldom Been, On the far side
of the lake are the ruins of Dimtt, apparently a Ptolemaic
town of some importance. One may also go to the Kasr
Karoun, where are ruins of an Egyptian and of a small
Roman temple ; it is some three hours' sail westward from
the hotel. But perhaps these ruins will interest few save
