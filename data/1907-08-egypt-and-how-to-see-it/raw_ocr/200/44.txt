EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT l

 

probably dating from the twelfth century, The church
itself was probably built in the sixth century ; it is, however,
in a remarkably well-preserved condition In the corner _
of the right aisle is a cabinet containing caskets in which are
said to be preserved the bones of St. Barbara and of other
saints.

The return journey may be made from St. George's station l
by the Helouan railway to Babel-Louk station, or by crossing
the line and continuing towards the Nile the terminus of the
tramway may be reached,

Two churches in the Mousky quarter are worth seeing.
They are situated in the Sharia Zuwila, a lane leading out
of the sharits-el-8ouren, which is the first turning to the left
after passing the tram-line which crosses the Mousky. The
churches are built one above the other; the upper one is _
divided, as in the case of the other churches, by screens,
and contains the usual pictures of saints, among which are
those of the Virgin, St. Theodore, and St. George, which.
according to an inscription, are four hundred years old. The _
gallery above is occupied by nun, who are hidden from sight
by a tall screen.

Below the level of this church, and communicating with
it by a flight of stairs, is the other, dedicated to the Virgin.
It has been recently restored, but great care has been taken
to leave it as much as possible in its original state. In an
annex is shown a greatly venerated picture of the Virgin
Mary and Child ; the hands of the Child and the tiara which
surrounds His head are of silver.

HELOUAN

Helouan has a certain distinction in that it is, so far, the
only modern "desert" town in the north of Egypt. Its
chief merits are the fine air and the sulphur baths. Obviouslv
it is more a resort for invalids than for others, yet mani,
prefer it even to Cairo. A group of houses on ellow susnd,
the range of high, sheer hills to the east, the bros plain down
to the river, and, beyond, the Pyramids. Snkhara. Dahshur.
and in the far distance Mena-such is Helouan, brilliant.
ulear-cut, and wind-swept, in keen sunlight. In the evening
all is enhanced by the glorious colouring of the sunset : the
Pyramids stand out to the last ; at first sharp and red, thev
become dim purple shapes, and then fade with the fading
