IsMAiLIA-sUEZ-THE CANAL-THE
PENINSULA OF' SINAI AND THE
OASES

CAIRO TO ISMAILIA

FOR two hours one traverses the Delta, swiftly and smoothly,
through rich cotton and com land, bridging canals that flow
peacefully between long rows of mimosa-trrees. To the right
is the pale rose border of low hills that stretch from Marg
past Belbeis, along the desert line to AbouWammad. There
the cultivation ceases. From Abou-Hammad to TelaLKebir
is sand-. uncompromising sand, and only sand.

The brief halt at Tel-el-Keb1Y shows the cemetery on the
right hand-a green patch, quiet with memories. Again
there is sand and waste until Ismailia is reached. There is
complete ohange-a leafy hamlet in the midst of desert.
Everywhere is thick foliage of lebbek-trees above carpets of
Rowers and vegetation, intersected by straight white fonds.
