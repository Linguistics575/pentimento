EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

Ibrahimieh Canal, whose boats, toiling up or drifting down
stream, are picturesque enough.

From Bibeh (kilo. 145) one may visit Deshashah-the ride
takes about two and a half hours-and see some interesting
fifrh-dynasW tornlrs. After Bibeh the aspect of the country
changes. the colours are clearer and richer, and cotton begins
to give place to cereals and sugarcane.

Minieh (kilo. 248) is a large town, but nothing more.

Abou-Kerkas (kilo. 268) is the starting-point for the rock
tombs of Beui-Haaean.

TOMBS OF BENI-HASSAN

The journey from Abou-Kerkae station to the rock tombs
takes about two hours, The station-master will procure
donkeys, but it is as well to give him notice beforehand by
telegram. The price for donkeys is from 10 pt. to 15 pt,
for the day. The charge on the Nile ferry-hoat is ' pt.
each, but a little extra must be given for the donkeys ; the
donkey-boys will also expect a piastre or two M bakshish.

The river, which is crossed in the usual Nile ferry-boat, is
about half an hour away, and after leaving the modern Beni-
Hessan village one passes along the edge of the desert,
striking sharply uphill and arriving at length at a rocky
terrace. Cut into the hillside can be seen the entrances to
the thirtymine tombs, a long line of doorways facing the
river. These are in varying degrees of preservation. Numbers
2, 3, 15, 17 are in a good enough state, and are of considerable
interest. They were probably excavated in the time of the
Usertsens of the twelfth dynasty, and they are covered with
wall paintings that give, with vivid accuracy, the life of
4500 years ago. There are men and women in all their daily
pursuits, fishing, hunting, weaving, and even at dinner-
the succession of the common daylight occupations and
interests, concessions to the needs of humanity and its
amusements. A strange race these Egyptians, who could
write their history, their theology, and even their diary on
the walls of a, catacomb. Their tombs are catalogues of
life, and their palaces instinct with the presence and threat
of death.

If the visitor has the energy to olimb the slope at the
back of the tombsiit need not take more than ten minutes
-ho will see in front the splendid range of Nile and green
valley, and behind the arid desert, rolling, limitless.
