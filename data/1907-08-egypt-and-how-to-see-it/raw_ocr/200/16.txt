EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

water is a forest of mastsr-"ferry-boUC' as the Anglo-
Egyptian styles all passenger ships to and from Etlrope--
trading steamers of manv lines, colliers near the great active
coaI-hoists, and little sailing-boats cruising up and down the
harbour.

Certain Steamship lines have made arrangements with the
Railway Administration whereby in winter special trains
meet their boats on the quay, and carry passengers direct to
Cairo. Passengers by other lines have to fend for them-
selves. Information on this point can best be obtained from
the steamship companies themselves. The Custom House
is on the quavs, and there are always plenty of cabs. The
drive to the station takes about half an hour, first through
numw native streets, then into the wide Place Mohammad Alv
and up Rue Cherif Pachavn fine modern street-the- past
the big police station into the railway terminus. The cab
fare is 5 pt. For those who wish to pass a few hours, or even
11 night, in Alexandria there are the Khedivial, Windsor, and
Savoy Hotels. all three of Which are good. One can go to
see Pompeyâ€™s Pillar, or else drive out to Ramleh in the after.

The journey from Alexandria to Cairo does not possess
unv great features of interest; the country, once one has
left the rather desolate Lake Mariout, is characteristic of
the Delts-canals, crops, and camels. Ihunar1hour, stand-

Kafr Zayat, a cotton centre, Tantah, the third largest town
in Egypt, but not otherwise of much interest, and Benha,
are the only four places worth mentioning on the route.
