EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

The train is a fast and luxurious substitute. Every night;
through the season the trains de luxe run between Cairo
and Luxor; they are made up of dining- and sleeping-ears,
and only carry finrt-elsss passengers, These trains are really
as excellent as any in the world ; they do not tear along and
shake the life out of the luckless passengers as do the vaunted
Riviera " flyers." The cars cannot be surpassed. They
have a double roof to preserve an even temperature, double
windows that keep out dust and Cinders; and, of course,
electric fans, ice, and any and everything one can wish for is
carried. Their great length and width ensures steady and
smooth running, 50 that one can sleep well all through the
journey.

The trains from Cairo and Luxor respectively leave at
6.30 P.M., and dinner (price 25 pt.) is served at 7.30 P.M.

destination the same evening. They should, however, take
a luncheon-basket with them.

The best months are from November to March, before and
after which periods the heat is rather too much for many
people. But if one cares to brave it, and owing to the purity
and dryness of the air it is not really so very trying, one
should go south in October ; then Egypt presents her greatest
wonder, for the " Nile overrfioweth all his banks," and the
world is one vast sheet of water from the railway to the hills.
The sunset fires it to a marvel of fiame that fades to deep
red, then rose, at last steely black under the starlight.
Here and there a causeway cleaves the Mod, a village
stands out, a group of pelm-trees rise. The desert hills take
wonderful colours under the changing light.

People who know no Arabic will probably need a dregomen
or guide. It is, perhaps, best to engage one on the spot, and
not to take men from Cairo. The local guides know their,
