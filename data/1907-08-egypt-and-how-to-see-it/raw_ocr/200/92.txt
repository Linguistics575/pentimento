EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

 

into the face of the hill, is broken at intervals by recesses.
and ends in one or more large chambers supported by pillars
of the original rock, In a depression in the Mor of the last
chamber was laid the massive granite sarcophagus containing
the mummy.

The walls of the passage, chambers, and pillars were
covered with finely executed and highly coloured reliefs
and hieroglyphics. In most cases there are extracts from
the two Is Books of the Dead," which give directions for
the journey of the departed spirit through the underworld.
The " Boat of the Sun ,, also appears frequently.

The following extract from the '' Book of the Dead '' was
found engraved on a sarcophagus. It is a profession of
faith and of a righteous life:

"I have committed no fraud against men. I have not
tormented the widow. I have not spoken falsely in the
tribunal, nor do I know ill-faith. I have done no forbidden
thing. I have not exacted of a taskmaster more work than
he could do daily. I have not been neglectful. I have not
been idle. I have not refused my debts, nor haveIWearied
m well-doing. I have not done that which is abominable
to the Gods. I have not slandered the slave to his master.
I have starved none. I have made none weep. I have
slain none, nor have I commanded to murder by treachery.
I have not stolen the Temple bread. I have not seized the
cakes offered to the Gods. I have not taken the food or the
fillets of the dead. I have not gained money by fraud. I
have not changed the measure of the com. I have not
defrauded the breadth of a finger on the hand. I have not
seized land. I have not changed the plates of the balance.
I have not falsified the balance. I have not taken the milk
from the mouths of the s11eklings. I have not hunted the
sacred animals in their pastures. I have not taken the
divine birds in the net. I have not fished for the sacred
fish in their ponds. I have not kept the water back in its
season. I have not cuta branch of the water in its passage.
I have not quenched the sacred fire at its hour. I have not
violated the divine cycle in its chosen offerings. I have not
driven the oxen from the sacred pastures. I have not
turned aside the God in his procession. I am pure. I am
pure. I am pure. I am pure."

In several of the tombs at Biben-el-Muluk the reliefs are
