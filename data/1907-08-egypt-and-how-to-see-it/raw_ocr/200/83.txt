excellent. A little way from the village of Luxor, the
Winter Palace overlooks the Nile, of which delightful views
are obtained from the terrace in front.

The Luxor Hotel is smaller and older, but quite comfort-
able. It stands in u. very pretty garden, with shady walks.
and has also a tennis court

Other hotels are the Karnak, Grand, and Savoy. There
is also a, pension called the Grande Pension de Pamille.
Full particulars of the hotels will be found on page 162.

The village of Luxor is much like other native villages, and
not worth wasting time over. There are several antiquity
dealers, whose wares should always be purchased with caution.
