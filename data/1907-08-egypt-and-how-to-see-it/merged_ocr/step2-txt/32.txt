EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

progress has been made towards the restoration of those of
greatest interest.

To obtain admission the visitor must be provided with
tickets, costing 2 pt. each, and obtainable at the hotels,
tourist agencies, Post Office, or at the mosques themselves.

All visitors have to put on large Arab slippers (provided at the mosques) over their boots -a compromise
with the Moslem injunction to take off shoes or boots before
entering.

For the sake of convenience, we may divide into two groups
those mosques which, from their antiquity or other associations connected with them, are most worthy of a visit:
(1) those in the neighbourhood of the Citadel, and (2) those
situated in or about the Mousky quarter. Those of the first
category can be visited in the morning, and the others in the
afternoon.

The Sultan Human, situated close to the Citadel, is a
fourteenth-century mosque of vast dimensions. The massive
gateway is 85 ft. high, with a stalactite domed roof. Inside
is the vestibule, which, as the mosque is at present undergoing restoration, is used as a place of worship. The work of
restoration will be very thorough, and is expected to take
two years to complete. The court is 115 ft. long and 105 ft.
broad, and has a large fountain in the centre. It is cruciform
in shape, the arms of the cross being formed by four large
recesses, which were reserved for the four sects of Islam.
The arches of these recesses are very fine, especially that
towards the east, the span of which is 70 ft. Under this is
the dikkeh, or reading-desk, and behind that the kibla, or
praying niche. ornamented with various inlaid marbles. To
the right of the kibla is the nimbar, or pulpit. A door to
the left leads to the mausoleum, in the centre of which is
the tomb of the founder of the mosque.

To the left, immediately on entering the courtyard, there
is a doorway leading into a madrassah, or school, containing
365 rooms, formerly occupied by students. The top stone of
this doorway is formed of eleven pieces of black and white
marble dovetailed together. The south minaret is the highest
in Cairo (280 ft.).

The building has at various times served as a fortress, and
lodged in the outer walls may be seen cannon-balls which the
French fired from the Citadel.

The unfinished mosque opposite is the Rifaiya, containing
