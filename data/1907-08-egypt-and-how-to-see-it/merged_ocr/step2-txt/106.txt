EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT



ASSOUAN

On arrival the matter of first importance is hotels. There
are three large ones. It is hard indeed to choose between
the Cataract and the Savoy. Both are first-class and in
delightful positions; both supply all that the visitor can wish.
The Cataract Hotel, built high above the Nile, of which
there is a splendid view both up and down, is perhaps the
most popular. The Savoy is on Elephantine Island, just
opposite the town, with gardens and trees. Both hotels
have tennis courts. A rather smaller hotel is the Grand,
situated in the town facing the Nile; it has recently been
rebuilt, and is very comfortable. Full particulars of the
hotels are given on page 163.

There is an English church near the Cataract Hotel, and
a resident chaplain holds regular services in winter.

Assouan is not a great centre; its importance lies principally in its qualities as a winter resort and its archaeological
interest. It is for all practical purposes the southern boundary of Egypt, and the borderland between races who, for
all their relations one with another, have never mingled.

Though a brazen furnace in summer, Assouan can hardly
be surpassed as a health resort in winter. Surrounded by
desert, the air is dry, yet the usual penalty-dust-is absent.
Rain hardly ever falls. The days are warm and brilliantly
sunny, but seldom unpleasantly hot during the winter
months. The town appears wonderfully clean. There is a
refreshing novelty about the scenery-the town lays at the
foot of the first cataract, and the river is hedged in by rocks
and great rounded boulders of pleasing outline.

Among the places of interest in and near the town, not
least are the bazaars-more picturesque than most of their
kind. Long - haired, shaggy Bishareen stalk past-often
with a lance in their hand; effendis, Greeks, fellaheen, in
every kind of dress pass up and down. Many of the shops
are worth notice. Sudanese wares, Dervish arms and
armour, and different objects of native manufacture make
up their varied stock-in-trade.

On the desert above the town is the Bishareen camp.
These nomads of the eastern desert, camel and sheep dealers
by trade, come into Assouan in winter and pitch their disreputable-looking tents near the town. Many think them
worth a visit.
