opposite the telegraph office and close to the Turf Club.

The American Mission Church (Presbyterian) is in Shariael-Miliguy, near Shepheard's Hotel.

AMUSEMENTS

One need never be dull in the evening. Every night
there is sure to be some kind of entertainment at one or the
other of .the hotels-dances, fancy-dress balls, cotillions, and
concerts.

There are regular weekly dances-on Saturday at the
Savoy, Thursday at Ghezireh Palace, and Monday at Shepheard's. Mena House and the Helouan hotels give dance:
from time to time, and also, once or twice in the season,

a gymkhana.
MUSIC

As far as music is concerned, a musical society for
quartette and chamber music in general is being founded
by a large and influential section of the more musical members
of the community. Hitherto the Cercle Artistique (Shariael-Madabergh) gave almost the only concerts in Cairo, but every
one now realises that it is high time to devote more attention
to these things.

The Khedivial Opera House is a fine theatre situated in
the centre of the town. It is under a committee of management, who engage a company for the whole winter. Many
well-known operas are given. It is somewhat difficult, however, to secure seats, as nearly all the boxes and stalls are
held for the season by abounds.

The new Abbas Theatre is most enterprising, and has met
with well-deserved success since it started a short time ago.
