THE SUDAN

"At present the population of the Sudan has not been
demoralised by indiscriminate almsgiving, but it will not
require much of this to make the demand "Bukehish /,, as importunate and annoying to travellers as in Egypt itself, and
to cause a considerable number of natives to forsake the
paths of honest industry for the unwholesome existence of
preying upon others.

"His Excellency the Governor-General trusts that all
travellers will consider this as a personal request from himself, and at the same time would inform them that if they
desire to give any money for the benefit of the inhabitants,
contributions for hospitals or relief of poverty, assistance
to the sick, and relief of deserving cases amongst the poorer
classes will be carefully administered by the Governors, and
he himself will gratefully receive contributions for what is the
Sudan's greatest need, viz., education.

"By Order of the Governor-General.
"( Signed) F. J. NASON, Lewa."
