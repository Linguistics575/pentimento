CHAPTER III
THE FAYOUM

THE province of Fayoum lies to the west of the Nile Valley
and about fifty miles south of Cairo. It is a most interesting
province, and a visit will be found well worth the trouble.

Fast and frequent trains run from Cairo to Wasta in an
hour and a half; from Waste a branch line leads to the
capital of the province, Medinet-el-Fayoum. The following
are the best trains:

A.M. Par. A M. P.M.

Fares: Cairo-Fayoum, first class, pt. 591; second class.

After leaving Waste the branch line crosses a strip of
cultivated land, then passes over desert. After a few miles,
cultivation again appears. The train traverses one or two
gorges; these are peculiar to the Fayoum country, which is
even hilly in parts-a curious contrast to the rest of Engt
Medinet--el-Fayoum is the capital, twenty-three miles from
Waste. As it is a railway centre, it makes quite the best
base from which to explore the country. Two branch lines
diverge, one to Abouxah, passing near the Lake Karoun,
and the other northwards to Sennour√©s. Medina is also the
centre of a network of light railways which find their way to
every part of the province.

The best hotel at Medina is the Karoun Hotel; it is clean
and not uncomfortable for a short stay. For particulars,
see page 162.
