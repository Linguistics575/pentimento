CAIRO TO LUXOR BY RAIL

The train passes Embabeh--from whose bridge there is a fine
view of the Nile--then Boulac - Dacrour, and Gizeh of the
Pyramids. Boulac-Dacrour is a large goods station where all
the north- and south-bound trains are sorted. Then Bedrechein,
the station for the Sakkarah Pyramids.

Ayat (kilo. 59) is a great resort of snipe and duck. The
Pyramid of Lisht is on the right-hand side.

The Pyramid of Meidoun-s monument of some interest-is near Rekkah (kilo. 83).

Waste (kilo. 92--1 hour 21 minutes from Cairo) is the
junction for the Fayoum trains.

The Fayoum may be visited specially from Cairo, or on
the way to or from Luxor (see page 62). After Wasta the
train passes over a long steel bridge that during most of the
year seems useless enough, but when the water is passing
from the basins its value appears.

Beni-Souef (kilo. 124) is a cotton centre and the capital
of the Beni-Souef Moudirieh, but has otherwise no special
interest.

For the next 260 kilometres the railway parallels the
