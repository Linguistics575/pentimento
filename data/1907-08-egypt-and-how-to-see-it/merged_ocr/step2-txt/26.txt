EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

$ 111+ day! Cairo can hardly, even now, attain the
gorgeous dimensions and aspect pictured by the writer's
genial fancy, but it is a fine city, and of great extent: to the
east and south Abbassieh, the Citadel, then Old Cairo,
then Ghezireh; then Boulac, once the port of the metropolis;
then, going northwards, Choubra-auch are its boundaries.
It has well over half a million inhabitants, and a very large
European community, and is no mean city in appearance.
Stand on the ramparts of the Citadel, and you will see the
countless houses and mosques, the quiet, broad stream of the
Nile. and, far off, the sharp grey forms of the Pyramids.
Turn round, and the old dead town is below you, silent, a
city of tombs; hard by, they seem close together, tombs
and voiceless huts; farther off, where the desert begins,
are the domed shrines, more sparse and conspicuous, of the
Caliphs and Mamelukes, under the shadow of the Red Mountain and the Mokattams. To the north are the villages on
the Matarieh line, a long string of European houses-almost
a new city-ranging from Pont de Koubbeh out to Matarieh
itself. Beyond is desert, and the low hills that seem to bound
it-post, clearest yellow and white. One far-off native
village, Kafr Gamous, stands out like a tiny fishing hamlet.
Its minaret might be the lighthouse at a harbour mouth.

Cairo at present has a slightly unfinished aspect, owing to
the immense amount of building involved by the extraordinary incursion of people of all sorts and nationalities
during recent years. Those who only knew Cairo ten or
fifteen years ago cannot recognise it now, with its crowded
streets, fine shops, high white houses, huge hotels, and
expansion on all sides. Where were almost waste places are now
streets; what was native suburb is now a European quarter.

A walk through the main streets is interest enough in itself.
You pass "Shepheard's," its balcony crowded with curious
and amused tourists. Hawkers of all sorts are yelling, or
coaxing possible purchasers, offering postcards, ornamental
By-whisk, walking-sticks, shawls, "antikas," scarabs fresh
from the factory. Snake-charmers and boys with tame
monkeys are performing their antics on the sidewalk.
Carriages and foot-passengers crowd the road and pavements.
At the open-air caf√©s are sitting crowds of Egyptians or-in the
evening-foreigners of all kinds. The street widens out at the
