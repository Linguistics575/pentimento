<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">CAIRO<br/>
<br/>
</span>The shopkeepers are <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>civil and zealous to engage<br/>
the attention of all possible buyers. One has to bargain in<br/>
most cases, but it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>genial process, sweetened by man<br/>
cups of coffee, Persian tea, sherbet of sundry kinds, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turkis<br/>
</span>delight, cigarettes, and suchlike delicacies, and if the purchaser knows the value of the objects he is buying he can<br/>
be certain of procuring them at their proper price.<br/>
<br/>
On the other (right-hand) side of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky </span>there is a<br/>
street leading off to the right (exactly opposite the one to<br/>
the left mentioned above); it widens, and eventually, after<br/>
various <span style="color: #0000FF;">turnings</span>, reaches the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Zouileh</span>, whence one can<br/>
reach the town by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>Aly Street. In this street and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">turnings </span>off it are the scent bazaars, and various small shops<br/>
where one can buy the native blue cloth and other attractive<br/>
stuffs. But the sellers are all natives here, and very few of<br/>
them understand English. Instead of turning to the right<br/>
at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beb-el-Zouileh</span>, one can go almost straight on into a<br/>
covered street, where are shoes, native saddlery, and various<br/>
kinds of leather work. An archway on the right-hand side<br/>
is the entrance to a courtyard off which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tent-maker</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shop-the </span>street, indeed, is called the Market of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tentmakers </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Soak-el-Eh-ith</span>). In the shop in question is<br/>
sold the Akmim cloth, a species of tapestry depicting ancient<br/>
Egyptian figures of all <span style="color: #0000FF;">sure-animals</span>, men, <span style="color: #0000FF;">boMa-and </span>every<br/>
sort of design, in gay colouring. <span style="color: #ff0000;">There </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>sword bazaar up<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>Aly Street, where are all kinds of weapons.<br/>
<br/>
The chief shops in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky </span>bazaar are: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khauchand<br/>
</span>(Turkish bazaar), Elias Habib (brass bazaar), Joseph Cohen<br/>
(a very excellent shop for carpet, embroidery, & c., and perhaps<br/>
the best place for precious stones). Malluk and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatoun </span>are<br/>
the names of two big merchants in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky </span>Street. Malluk<br/>
has a large collection of <span style="color: #ff0000;">mushrabiyeh </span>(or lattice) woodwork,<br/>
inlaid work, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lee</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Cabs from the Opera Square to the bazaars, 5 pt.; or return,<br/>
after waiting, 15 pt<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">MOSQUES<br/>
<br/>
</span>The mosques of Cairo represent some of the finest<br/>
examples of Oriental architecture, though many of the<br/>
older buildings have been allowed to fall into a sad <span style="color: #0000FF;">state </span>of<br/>
disrepair. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Acommittee </span>has, however, been formed to undertake their preservation, and under its auspices considerable<br/>
