<span>EGYPT, <span style="color: #0000FF;">AND </span>HOW TO SEE <span style="color: #ff0000;">IT<br/>

</span>mendicity are equally obvious, and, as time goes on, cannot<br/>
fail to increase, unless some means are adopted for checking<br/>
the practice.<br/>
<br/>
"It would be extremely <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>for the Government <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>devise an effective remedy for this state of things. The real<br/>
remedy rests with the travellers themselves. If money<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">were</span>, in future<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>only bestowed in return for some <span style="color: #0000FF;">actual<br/>
</span>service rendered, or in case of evident and established distress, the present pernicious habit of begging would soon die<br/>
out, to the advantage both of the people and of the visitors.<br/>
<br/>
"It is with this conviction that we venture to express a<br/>
hope <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>our fellow countrymen, when travelling <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>Egypt,<br/>
will lend their aid to this <span style="color: #0000FF;">important </span>reform by abstaining<br/>
from the distribution of money in response to mere demands<br/>
for <span style="color: #ff0000;">baloshish</span>, bestowing it only when the circumstances<br/>
appear to them to warrant their generosity.<br/>
<br/>
"Tourists should especially abstain from throwing money<br/>
from the decks of the steamers to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-stages </span>or on<br/>
to the banks of the Nile for the purpose of witnessing the<br/>
scramble for the coins; such exhibitions are mischievous<br/>
as well as degrading.<br/>

</span>The shops in Upper Egypt are, as a rule, primitive, and it<br/>
is as well to take what one requires from Cairo. There are a<br/>
few shops-chemists, photograph shops, and suchlike, but<br/>
very little else in the way of European necessities is to be<br/>
found. As to clothes<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>one should take thick things as well<br/>
as <span style="color: #0000FF;">thin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasional </span>cold days, and almost always<br/>
cold nights. It rains very seldom, but once in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>way it does<br/>
rain, and a waterproof <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>umbrella may be found most useful,<br/>
even at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assouan</span>, between November and March. A <span style="color: #ff0000;">sunhelmet </span>is really seldom necessary; a straw <span style="color: #ff0000;">hat</span>, or at most <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>terai or felt <span style="color: #0000FF;">but</span>, is quite sufficient. The glare in the desert is<br/>
occasionally trying, and some visitors may find smoked glasses<br/>
