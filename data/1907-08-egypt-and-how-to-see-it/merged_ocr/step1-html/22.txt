<span>CHAPTER II<br/>
CAIRO<br/>
<br/>
As the train comes to a standstill in Cairo station the visitor<br/>
is besieged by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>crowd of hotel porters, but this need cause<br/>
no annoyance. If rooms have been engaged <span style="color: #0000FF;">previously</span>, all<br/>
that is necessary is to pick out the representative of the<br/>
particular hotel chosen. He will take charge of the luggage<br/>
and lead the way to the hotel omnibus outside.<br/>
<br/>
First to be considered are the hotels. Driving from the<br/>
station<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>one <span style="color: #ff0000;">reaches </span>"Shepheard<span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>in a few minutes; then<br/>
just beyond it is the Continental. Turn to the right and<br/>
you pass the Angleterre<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>then, going towards Kasr-el-Nil<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>the National and the Savoy. On the river-bank, just to<br/>
the south of the bridge, is the new Semiramis, in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr-elDoubara</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>a great quarter for the wealthy residents. If<br/>
you go over the bridge, and to the right hand, you reach<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>Palace and its garden. Here also are the<br/>
fashionable villas.<br/>
<br/>
There are several other hotels, more economical, but quite<br/>
comfortable: the <span style="color: #0000FF;">MÃ©tropole</span>, Eden Palace, New Khedivial,<br/>
and Bristol. There are, too, plenty of <span style="color: #0000FF;">pensions</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the<br/>
Imperial, Carlton House, Villa Victoria, Rossmore House<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>Pension <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sima</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>mention <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few only. It is also possible<br/>
to hire a furnished <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>for the winter; so there is no <span style="color: #ff0000;">lack </span>of<br/>
choice where to stay.<br/>
<br/>
The Savoy is perhaps the premier hotel, situated at<br/>
the corner of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kasr-el-Nil </span>and Suliman Pasha streets, a very<br/>
pleasant part of the town. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>favourite <span style="color: #ff0000;">rendez-vous </span>of<br/>
Cairo rank and fashion. The restaurant, for which the hotel<br/>
is noted, is always crowded with smart diners-out during the<br/>
winter. The Savoy Saturday night dances are among the<br/>
most popular events of the Cairo <span style="color: #ff0000;">season</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>Shepheard's "is famous all over the world, and hardly<br/>
needs recommendation; it always maintains its well-deserved<br/>
popularity. The hotel is situated not far from the station,<br/>
in the principal street of the town. In front there is a fine<br/>
