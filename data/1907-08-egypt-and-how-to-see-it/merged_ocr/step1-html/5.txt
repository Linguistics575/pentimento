infallible book of reference to archaeologists. Its object is,<br/>
rather, to aid the visitors to this country by indicating that<br/>
which is most worth seeing, where they should go, and how<br/>
they may <span style="color: #ff0000;">economise </span>time, money, and fatigue to the greatest<br/>
advantage.<br/>
