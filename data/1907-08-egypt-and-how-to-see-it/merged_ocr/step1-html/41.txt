OLD COPTIC CHURCHES<br/>
<br/>
The old Coptic churches of Cairo are difficult to find, hidden<br/>
away in out-of-the-way corners, unsuspected by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">uninitiated</span>. No tapering spires <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Gothic towers indicate their<br/>
presence. They are unpretentious buildings, very old, somewhat neglected-looking. They keep modestly out of sight,<br/>
as if the persecutions to which the Copts were exposed in<br/>
bygone days have made them fearful of exposing themselves<br/>
to the broad light of day. A simple cross over the doorway<br/>
or on the top of some little belfry alone distinguishes them<br/>
from the other buildings <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>crowd upon and almost<br/>
overwhelm them.<br/>
<br/>
Their interior has little architectural adornment. They<br/>
are very small, and can only contain a hundred or so of<br/>
worshippers at most<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>To make up for this, perhaps, three<br/>
churches are in some cases found together or only <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few yards<br/>
apart. They <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>generally divided into three sections by<br/>
screens, running transversely across the church, and where<br/>
there is no gallery another screen forms a lateral division<br/>
which shuts off the women from the men: the sexes are<br/>
always kept apart.<br/>
<br/>
At the very back, separated from the main body of the<br/>
church by a screen, is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">nekal</span>, or sanctuary, where is the<br/>
altar; access to this is reserved for the priest and his assistants and those about to take Communion. Another curious<br/>
feature is the fact that there are no chairs or seats of any<br/>
kind. The few worshippers squat on the floor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or</span>, at certain<br/>
parts of the service, stand, and as this wearies them in the<br/>
course of the almost interminable service they provide them<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>selves with crutches upon which to lean.<br/>
