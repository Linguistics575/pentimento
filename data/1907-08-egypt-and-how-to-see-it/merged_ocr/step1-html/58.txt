<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Condition </span>The finger-marks of the Egyptian who had inserted<br/>
the last stone in the wall built to conceal the doorway were<br/>
still recognisable on the lime. There were also the marks of<br/>
naked feet imprinted on the sand which lay in one corner of<br/>
the tomb chamber. Everything was in its original condition<br/>
in this tomb, where the <span style="color: #0000FF;">embalmed </span>remains of the bull had<br/>
lain undisturbed for thirty-seven <span style="color: #0000FF;">centuries</span>."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Besides the Pyramids, of which there are remains of some<br/>
twenty or thirty-many still of a considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">height-there<br/>
</span>are countless tombs and <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastabas </span>of the great ones of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memphis</span>. The most interesting of the latter are, perhaps, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastabas </span>of Ptahhotep and Ti and the tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mereruka</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Mastaba of Ptahhotep is between the Step Pyramid<br/>
and Mariette's house. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptahhotep </span>was a high <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>in the<br/>
time of the fifth dynasty.<br/>
<br/>
The Mastaba of Ti is to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">north-east </span>of Mariette's<br/>
house; it is also of the fifth dynasty. The reliefs on the<br/>
walls of this and the last-mentioned tomb are of extraordinary<br/>
excellence, and although they date from about four thousand<br/>
years before Christ, many of the pictures are wonderfully<br/>
clear and lifelike; in fact, the work is far better than anything that was produced during the later dynasties.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Mereruka is of considerable size, and<br/>
contains over thirty rooms. These are divided into three<br/>
parts: the tomb of Mereruka himself; his wife, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hert-WatetKhet</span>; and their son, Meri-Teti. They date from the sixth<br/>
dynasty<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and are covered with reliefs, many of which are<br/>
worth examining.<br/>

THE BARRAGE<br/>
<br/>
A visit to the Delta Barrage is undoubtedly one of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">pleasantest </span>excursions from Cairo. The expedition can be<br/>
made most quickly and comfortably by <span style="color: #0000FF;">railway</span>; there are<br/>
plenty of trains from Cairo (main-line station), and the<br/>
journey takes about half an hour. The most convenient times<br/>
are:<br/>
<br/>
