<br/>
THE DELTA<br/>
<br/>
THE shape of Egypt is for all the world exactly like the<br/>
Eiffel Tower. The shaft is Upper Egypt, and the base is the<br/>
Delta, formed by the gradual silt of the Nile in its Beven-now only two-branches. All the space inside is cultivation;<br/>
without is desert. At the junction of the two is Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
Historically Upper Egypt is, of course, far more interesting<br/>
than the Delta. The ruins of Lower Egypt are few and far<br/>
between, and seldom in good preservation. It has suffered<br/>
also at times in its cultivation; for it depends almost wholly<br/>
on canals, and therefore on <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>irrigation-now provided<br/>
by the Delta barrage and supplemented by the new <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zifteh<br/>
</span>barrage.<br/>
<br/>
A wonderful degree of fertility <span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span>been attained. Much<br/>
of the land yields two, and even three, crops in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>year.<br/>
<br/>
We give a short description after this article of such towns<br/>
and places as have any special features, but on the whole<br/>
there is not very much in the Delta to interest most visitors.<br/>
<br/>
The scenery has none of the grandeur of the Upper N ile<br/>
Valley, but there is in <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">certain </span>peaceful <span style="color: #0000FF;">charm</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>
