<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO <span style="color: #0000FF;">SEE </span>IT<br/>
<br/>
Ramleh on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cairo-Alexandria </span>line is Sidi-Gaber, <span style="color: #0000FF;">about<br/>
</span>ten minutes from Alexandria terminus; all trains stop there.<br/>
<br/>
As to amusements, in Alexandria itself there is the Zizinia<br/>
Theatre, at which the various <span style="color: #ff0000;">operatic </span>and dramatic companies perform after or before <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>stay in Cairo. There<br/>
are also concerts, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>small dances at the hotels.<br/>
<br/>
There are several clubs-the Khedivial (over the Bourse)<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>the Mohammed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aly</span>, in Rue Rosette, and a recently formed<br/>
but very comfortable little English club, the Union.<br/>
<br/>
HOTELS<br/>
<br/>
There are many hotels and <span style="color: #0000FF;">pensions </span>in and around<br/>
Alexandria<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>of all classes and suitable to every taste. Of<br/>
those in the town, the Savoy Palace, Khedivial, Grand<br/>
Hotel, and Hotel Windsor are the best<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>These are all <span style="color: #0000FF;">firstclass</span>, and in any one of them the visitor will find comfortable<br/>
quarters.<br/>
<br/>
The Savoy Palace is perhaps the most up-to-date, as the<br/>
hotel was only opened at the beginning of 1907. It possesses everything that makes hotel life <span style="color: #0000FF;">pleasant-electric<br/>
</span>lifts, a French restaurant and American bar, a hair-dressing<br/>
establishment in the hotel; and there are private suites of<br/>
rooms provided for the more wealthy visitors.<br/>
<br/>
The Khedivial is situated in the fashionable quarter of<br/>
the town, and can be <span style="color: #0000FF;">recommended<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Grand Hotel is most conveniently placed in the very<br/>
centre of the town.<br/>
<br/>
The Hotel Windsor is near the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea</span>. It is rather smaller<br/>
than the hotels mentioned above, and offers very reasonable<br/>
terms to its visitors.<br/>
<br/>
At Ramleh the principal hotel is the Grand Casino San<br/>
Stefano-about ten minutes by electric tram from <span style="color: #ff0000;">SidiGaber </span>station. This hotel forms the summer quarters of the<br/>
Government, and it offers many attractions to its visitors.<br/>
It is on the sea-shore<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and has a splendid terrace facing<br/>
the sea<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>on which meals are served in summer and a band<br/>
plays every afternoon. There are also frequent concerts.<br/>
an occasional dance, and many other entertainments. Attached to the hotel is a well-equipped bathing establishment,<br/>
where one may take one's morning bathe in the sea with<br/>
safety and comfort.<br/>
<br/>
The Hotel Beau Rivage is a minute or two further on by<br/>
tram. It is smaller and more moderate than the Casino,<br/>
