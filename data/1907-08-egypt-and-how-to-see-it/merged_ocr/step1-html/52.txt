<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
whole road is level; on either side is a long plain, in early<br/>
winter a vast sheet of water as far as the eye can reach, one<br/>
rose-red expanse at sunset, on which quiver the huge <span style="color: #0000FF;">triangular </span>shadows of the Pyramids. Later, the water passes<br/>
off, and in a month or two all is one wide sea of verdure.<br/>
<br/>
The road is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismail</span>'s creation, built in an incredibly short<br/>
space of time. It is the finest road in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span>. The<br/>
long avenue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lebbek </span>trees is crowded with cabs, carriages,<br/>
motor-cars, native carts, strings of camels, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few stray<br/>
cyclists of equally strange nationality and dress. Between<br/>
the trees<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>as the tram <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ries </span>along, one is suddenly aware of<br/>
those great shapes-sharp, grey-red, rigid above the rough<br/>
desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliff</span>. Little black specks move to and fro at their<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">base-people </span>already exploring and sight-seeing.<br/>
<br/>
A crowd of <span style="color: #ff0000;">White-robed </span>donkey-boys and dragomans hover<br/>
round the tram as it arrives. The hotel is a few yards off<br/>
to the right hand. After seeing the Pyramids and the<br/>
Sphinx, one may stop and have lunch, or tea on the verandah,<br/>
before returning to Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The road curves up the hill to the Pyramids. There is no<br/>
escape from these great monuments. They stand silent<br/>
above everything. They appear, faint blue shapes of sharp<br/>
outline from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Galioub </span>as the train approaches Cairo, from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh</span>, from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>club grounds above the treetops, from any and every point of clear westward view in<br/>
Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
Their size alone and their form remains. Stripped of their<br/>
brilliant white smooth <span style="color: #0000FF;">casing</span>, once covered with strange<br/>
carvings and paintings, bereft of the huge precincts and<br/>
stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">gateway </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B</span>, they appear barbarous<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>rude, rugged, almost<br/>
meaningless, shapes of forgotten power. And the Sphinx is<br/>
more wonderful, more mysterious still, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Horemku </span>the ancient.<br/>
No one can tell when the Sphinx came into being. There is a<br/>
legend that it was in existence at the time when Chephren<br/>
built his Pyramid. Thothmes IV. cleared away the sand in<br/>
which it was buried, <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">command-given </span>in a dream-of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>, who claimed that it was his statue. Probably<br/>
a far greater antiquity belongs to <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.for </span>Princess <span style="color: #ff0000;">Honitsen</span>,<br/>
daughter of Cheops (builder of the Great Pyramid) speaks,<br/>
in an inscription on a <span style="color: #0000FF;">stele</span>, of a "Temple of the Sphinx "<br/>
as existing in her day. The following is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">translation </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t<br/>
<br/>
