<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are many astronomical symbols, and, above all. there<br/>
is the painted zodiac on the ceiling, and the strange recumbent figure encircling three sides of it.<br/>
<br/>
Sonnini<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>that same traveller who expatiated on Rosetta.<br/>
was so struck by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dendera </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>to give no less than five drawings of different figures. He speaks of undoubted Greek<br/>
influence-the bundles of plants in the hands of the members<br/>
of the Hathor procession, unusual in Egyptology, rather<br/>
suggesting Etruscan vases; and he is struck by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fleur-delis </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sceptre </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">truncheon</span>. The temple is certainly unusual<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>and happily it is in excellent preservation, though we are<br/>
told that the fellaheen actually built a village on the top of<br/>
it, and, further, that some of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke</span>'s troops were<br/>
in the habit of using the temple at large as a target.<br/>
<br/>
For all the attraction and even beauty of the frescoes and<br/>
sculpture, one can hardly form a fair impression from inside.<br/>
Those huge pillars, crowded together, the narrow way between<br/>
them, the darkness, all give an <span style="color: #0000FF;">air </span>of constraint, and not<br/>
of positive size. It is the roof that reveals the size and<br/>
height of the temple; and there, too, is the glorious view<br/>
over fields and river, and the high sequence of hills behind<br/>
in whose shadow the House of Hathor dominated the plain.<br/>
<br/>
Tentyris, or Tentyra, an ancient town from which the<br/>
temple takes its name, was the centre of the crocodile feud.<br/>
The inhabitants of Tentyra seem to have had a great aversion<br/>
to crocodiles, and were expert at hunting and killing them<span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>hence the constant fights with the crocodile worshippers of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombos</span>, or Kom Ombo.<br/>
<br/>
The cost of the Journey is slight enough; five or six <span style="color: #0000FF;">piastres<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>head usually covers the hire of donkeys and the ferry.<br/>
Perhaps another piastre or two may be given as <span style="color: #0000FF;">bakshish'if<br/>
</span>the donkey- <span style="color: #0000FF;">boys </span>have been decently helpful and quiet. To do<br/>
them justice, they are generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">well- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">conducted </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>these <span style="color: #0000FF;">parts<br/>
<br/>
</span>Near Kous (kilo. 643) there are some fine views of the<br/>
river on the right-hand side.<br/>
<br/>
In half an hour the train reaches Luxor-673 kilometres<br/>
(420 miles) from Cairo.<br/>

On arrival the trains are met by the porters of the various<br/>
hotels, and outside, omnibuses and cabs are waiting.<br/>
