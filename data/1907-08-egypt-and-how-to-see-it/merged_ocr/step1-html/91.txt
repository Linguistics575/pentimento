Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, but bearing the names of many of the<br/>
later kings.<br/>
<br/>
Most people will consider Karnak well worth a second<br/>
visit at least; and, if possible, they should arrange to see it<br/>
by moonlight-the effect is impressive.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span>--West <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bank.-0n </span>the west side of the Nile there<br/>
are a great many points of interest which should on no<br/>
account be missed.<br/>
<br/>
It is best to start at about 10 A.M., to have lunch on the<br/>
far side. and return to Luxor about 3 or <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>RM<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Notice </span>should be given to the hotel people, who will arrange<br/>
for lunch to be sent over to the Rest House erected by Messrs.<br/>
Cook on the western side.<br/>

THE TEMPLE OF SETI <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. AT KURNA<br/>
<br/>
This is about three-quarters of an hour<span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ride </span>in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">northwesterly </span>direction from the landing-stage. It is conspicuous<br/>
from a distance by the fine columns forming the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fagade</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The temple, founded in honour of Amen, and partly<br/>
decorated by Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, was completed by his son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span>the<br/>
Great, who added many of his own <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>The portion<br/>
now standing represents only about a third of the original<br/>
building, as there were at least two pylons, separated from<br/>
the sanctuary by broad colonnade courts, which have <span style="color: #0000FF;">dis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>appeared. The walls bear interesting reliefs of Seti and<br/>
Rameses before the gods.<br/>

THE TOMBS OF THE KINGS AT BIBAN-EL-MULUK<br/>
<br/>
Close to Kurna the desert begins and the spurs of the hills<br/>
meet the plain. The track enters a rocky valley<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>which<br/>
winds, and gradually narrows right into the heart of the<br/>
hills, arid, rocky, infinitely desolate; it is well named the<br/>
"Valley of Death." After half an hour's ride the valley<br/>
becomes a mere gorge, and ends in two or three rocky <span style="color: #0000FF;">clefts</span>.<br/>
This was the site chosen by the kings for their sepulture.<br/>
<br/>
Cut in the face of the almost perpendicular limestone are a<br/>
number of small, <span style="color: #ff0000;">stone-lined </span>doorways. All the tombs, though<br/>
of varying size and degree of elaboration, are made on the<br/>
same plan. A steep, sloping passage, cut downwards, right<br/>
