THE OASES<br/>
<br/>
The oases are small patches of fertile land surrounded by<br/>
desert. Some of them are of considerable extent and have<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>resident population; others consist of a few palm-trees<br/>
only, clustered round a single spring. A chain of these<br/>
oases runs parallel to the valley of the Nile, and from a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hundred </span>to two hundred miles from it. It is supposed that they<br/>
indicate the former course of the river.<br/>
<br/>
In ancient history many of the oases were of considerable<br/>
importance. Herodotus mentions them as the "Islands of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Blest</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>" and the ancient Egyptian name, "Nabet," signified<br/>
a place of mummies, in that the legend claimed that the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">jackal-headed </span>Anubis conducted the spirits of the dead<br/>
from their tombs in the valley across the mountains and<br/>
desert to their paradise.<br/>
<br/>
The principal oases, from north to south, are: (l) Siwa, or<br/>
Jupiter Ammon, which is about twenty <span style="color: #0000FF;">davis</span>' journey west<br/>
of Cairo; (2) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahrieh</span>, opposite Minieh; (3) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Farafra</span>, opposite Assiut; (4) <span style="color: #0000FF;">anhel </span>and (5) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kharga</span>. due west of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>.<br/>
but approached from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Farshout</span>; (6) Kurkur, north-west of<br/>
Kom Ombo; and (7) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Selima</span>, south-west of Wadi-Halfa.<br/>
<br/>
It is hardly the province of this book to describe these<br/>
expeditions and their objects at length. They entail <span style="color: #0000FF;">special<br/>
</span>journeys of several days bv <span style="color: #0000FF;">camel</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>They are, of course.<br/>
highly interesting, but hardly feasible for the majority of<br/>
visitors.<br/>
