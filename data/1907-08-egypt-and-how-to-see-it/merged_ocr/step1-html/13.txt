RAILWAY ARRANGEMENTS<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Manv </span>people are surprised when they come to Egypt to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>a railway system which can compare in most particulars<br/>
with those of Europe and America. There are some 1500<br/>
miles of railway, with about 270 stations<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>under State management, besides a large number of light railways.<br/>
<br/>
The most important trains are composed of large <span style="color: #ff0000;">doublebogie </span>corridor carriages of the latest design, lighted by <span style="color: #0000FF;">electricity </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">gas </span>On all the principal expresses dining- or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">luncheon-cars </span>are provided, and for the longer journeys<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">sleeping-cars</span>; these are of the well-known type used all<br/>
over Europe<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and are run under an arrangement with the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Waaon-Lits </span>Company.<br/>
<br/>
There are three classes of carriages<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the thirds, however,<br/>
are somewhat different from those in England, and it is very<br/>
unusual to see a European travelling third class. Fares are,<br/>
on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">whole</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>considerably cheaper than those of English<br/>
railways. A short journey costs more in proportion than <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>long one. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">second-class </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fare </span>is half the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class</span>, and<br/>
the third half the second.<br/>
<br/>
Return tickets are not issued at present. except on one or<br/>
two of the suburban lines. No luggage is carried free, except<br/>
that which is taken by the passenger into the carriage.<br/>
Special trains, saloons, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">conveyance </span>of carriages or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">motor-cam </span>can be arranged for at short notice; particulars<br/>
on these points are given on page 197.<br/>
