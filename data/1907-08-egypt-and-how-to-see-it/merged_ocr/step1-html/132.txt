<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO <span style="color: #0000FF;">SEE </span>IT<br/>
<br/>
with their buildings still standing. The Arabs use it as a<br/>
place for lying in wait for travellers. There may be seen<br/>
lofty and <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-built </span>palaces with enclosure walls around<br/>
them. They are for the most part built over vaulted <span style="color: #ff0000;">colonmules</span>, and some few serve as dwellings for monks. There<br/>
are some springs of fresh water, but they are somewhat<br/>
scanty. Next one comes to the church of St. Menas, a huge<br/>
building decorated with statues and paintings of the greatest<br/>
beauty. There tapers burn day and night without ceasing.<br/>
At one end of the church is a vast tomb with two camels in<br/>
marble, and upon them the statue of a man carved in marble<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>who is standing with one foot upon each camel. One of his<br/>
hands is open and the other closed. This statue is said to<br/>
represent St. Menas. On the right as you enter the church<br/>
is a great marble column, in which a shrine is carved containing figures of Jesus, John, and Zacharias. There is also<br/>
to be seen a statue of the Virgin Mary, hidden by two curtains, and statues of all the prophets. Outside the church<br/>
are figures representing all kinds of animals and men of all<br/>
occupations. Among others is a slave merchant holding<br/>
in his hand a purse upside down. Over the midst of the church<br/>
is a dome, beneath which are eight figures said to represent<br/>
angels. Close to the church is a mosque, where the Moslems<br/>
come to pray. All the surrounding land is planted with<br/>
fruit trees. The fruit is very good, and used for making<br/>
syrup. There are also a great many vines from which wine<br/>
is made.'<br/>

"This description proves that for long after the Arab conquest, although the city was uninhabited, yet it was still<br/>
intact, but the unknown Arab traveller wrote these lines<br/>
in the tenth century, before the conquest of England by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Normans, and from that time until <span style="color: #0000FF;">J </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">une </span>1905 the marble city<br/>
of the patron saint of Egypt remained lost amidst the wilds<br/>
of Mariout. The vines and fruit trees have all gone, the<br/>
springs <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>dried up, and not a single visitor save the wandering Bedouin has ever passed by the ruined basilicas and<br/>
monasteries of the Lourdes of Christian Egypt. Although<br/>
the feast of St. Menas has always been kept up by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Orthodox</span>, Jacobite, and Abyssinian Churches, and the flasks<br/>
of the holy oil of the saint have been collected in all the<br/>
museums of Europe, the mystery surrounding the site of<br/>
the city appeared to be as insoluble as that of the equally<br/>
recondite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wady-el-Malook </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Unper </span>Egypt, until the learned<br/>
