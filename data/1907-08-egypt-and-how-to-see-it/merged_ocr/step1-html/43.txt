<span>CAIRO<br/>
<br/>
There are also two other churches here, close together,<br/>
but they do not call for any <span style="color: #0000FF;">special </span>remark.<br/>
<br/>
One has now to return towards the Aqueduct, and to keep<br/>
to the east side of the Helouan railway for about a mile.<br/>
Just past the new Protestant cemetery is a high wall enclosing a garden of <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-trees</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and terminating in a small<br/>
dwelling-house, on the side of which is a plate bearing the<br/>
name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chareh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gamehamr</span>. In the corner formed by this<br/>
building and <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>old brick wall is a doorway which <span style="color: #0000FF;">leads<br/>
</span>through winding lanes between the houses to the Der Abu<br/>
Sefen. This comprises three churches, one of which is being<br/>
restored, and contains a fine old ebony screen inlaid with<br/>
ivory, an altar casket which dates from the year 1280 A.D.,<br/>
and an altar in marble. It is in a better condition than the<br/>
church of Deir Mari Mena.<br/>
<br/>
From Abu Sefen the way lies along the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helouan </span>railway<br/>
line towards the village of Kasr-esh-Shamas, the inhabitants<br/>
of which are nearly all Copts. At the second level crossing<br/>
one must turn to the left. Nearly opposite is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>short incline<br/>
leading towards a door in the wall, whence a narrow winding<br/>
path leads between the dwelling-houses to the church of Abu<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sergeh</span>. It is larger than the others, though its size cannot<br/>
be properly appreciated as it is divided up by <span style="color: #0000FF;">screens </span>On<br/>
the screen separating the sanctuary from the rest of the<br/>
church are some very fine old carvings<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Underneath the<br/>
church is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>crypt, older <span style="color: #ff0000;">than </span>the church itself, reached by a<br/>
dark flight of steps, where is <span style="color: #0000FF;">nointed </span>out an alcove where,<br/>
according to tradition, the Virgin Mary rested after the<br/>
flight into <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>. It also contains an old baptismal font.<br/>
<br/>
A little way further on is a new Greek church, circular in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">shape </span>Passing round the side of this a narrow, winding<br/>
path leads to the beautiful little ch <span style="color: #0000FF;">arch </span>of St. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Barbara</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>J ust opposite St. George's railway station <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large <span style="color: #0000FF;">archway</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>bearing inscriptions in Arabic, leads into a courtyard; from<br/>
the other side <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>broad flight of steps leads towards the church<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Moallaka</span>, much finer than any of the others. Above is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>gallery for the women. with <span style="color: #ff0000;">mushrabieh </span>windows, through<br/>
which they can look but remain themselves unseen. The<br/>
screen dividing <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the altar is a beautiful piece of workmanship<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>being composed of carved ebony and cedar inlaid<br/>
with ivory. There are <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>very old <span style="color: #0000FF;">pictures </span>of saints and<br/>
one of the Virgin Mary, which is said to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>nine hundred years<br/>
old. The most interesting object is, however, the pulpit,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">43<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
