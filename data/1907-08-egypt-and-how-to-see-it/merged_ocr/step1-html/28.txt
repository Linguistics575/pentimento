<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
meetings are almost always crowded. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">totalisator </span>is in<br/>
use (pari mutual), and tickets on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">horses </span>can be taken<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">LEI</span>, or by less wealthy backers for 20 pt. As the principle<br/>
of payment is the division of receipts<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>less the percentage due<br/>
to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">totalisator </span>(which goes to the funds of the racing club),<br/>
one's winnings vary. A favourite whom every one supports<br/>
may not even pay back his full dollar, and outsiders backed<br/>
by a few only have been known to pay 60 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. Visitors can<br/>
become temporary members if introduced <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>member of the<br/>
club; they should apply to the secretary. For subscription<br/>
and entrance to the grand stand on <span style="color: #0000FF;">race </span>days see page 164.<br/>
