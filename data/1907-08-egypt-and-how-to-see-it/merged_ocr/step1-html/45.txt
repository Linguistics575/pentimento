blue-black wall, with intense black depths and profound<br/>
shadows.<br/>
<br/>
Those who stay at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helouan</span>, if not invalids, will find a<br/>
fair amount of occupation. There are two or three race<br/>
meetings and sometimes a gymkhana during the season. Of<br/>
an evening dances and concerts are held from time to time<br/>
at the hotels <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Casino. The Survey <span style="color: #0000FF;">Department </span>Observatory<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">which </span>is the Greenwich of Egypt, is high up on the<br/>
hill at the back, and deserves a visit. There are wadies or<br/>
valleys to be explored; purely torrential gullies, full of<br/>
stones<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>great and small, carried down by the rush of water<br/>
from the hills. A few tracks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hare </span>or gazelle appear. A<br/>
little sparse vegetation-starved, stunted shrubs-shows<br/>
that moisture now and again exists in these <span style="color: #0000FF;">clefts</span>. They<br/>
give a curious effect of winding desolation.<br/>
<br/>
There is some tennis to be had, and there is also the golf<br/>
course, with noble hazards. True, the heavy sand here and<br/>
there and the unduly fast <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>greens "are occasionally exasperating, but the joy of the three or four difficult "carries<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>"<br/>
the delight at a fine iron-shot taken clean and full off the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">surface-tUse </span>are compensations. It is a real <span style="color: #0000FF;">test<br/>
</span>of good golf.<br/>
<br/>
To give a few practical details: <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helouan </span>is about fifteen<br/>
miles south of Cairo, on the eastern bank of the Nile. The<br/>
town stands in the desert two hundred feet above the river.<br/>
Bab-el-Louk is the station for Helouan; it is about five<br/>
minutes' drive from the Savoy Hotel and eight minutes<br/>
from the Opera Square. The journey takes about half an<br/>
hour by the fast trains. The time-table will be found on<br/>
page 189. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helouan</span>'s sunshine average is <span style="color: #0000FF;">high-about </span>eight<br/>
hours per day from November to April-and the average<br/>
temperature about 60Â° Fahrenheit. It seldom falls below<br/>
60" or rises above <span style="color: #0000FF;">7 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2 </span>There is scarcely ever any rain.<br/>
<br/>
Helouan is a great place for throat, lung, and digestion<br/>
troubles; the fine, pure, dry air is about the best remedy<br/>
possible for these. It has also an excellent bath establishment; the water comes from various thermal springs that<br/>
rise in the desert. It is stronger than <span style="color: #0000FF;">any </span>sulphur-water in<br/>
Europe<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and is known in the medical world for <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>wonderful<br/>
curative powers in cases of stiff joints, rheumatoid arthritis<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>sciatica. chronic gout, and skin affections<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
