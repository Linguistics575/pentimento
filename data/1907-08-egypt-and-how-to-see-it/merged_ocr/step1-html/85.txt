<br/>
During the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth dynasties<br/>
Thebes was again of the first importance. and its kings<br/>
devoted much of their energies to building temples and<br/>
other great works. It was apparently the capital of all<br/>
Egypt at this time, except during the reign of Amenhotep IV.,<br/>
who started the sun-worship heresy and changed his <span style="color: #0000FF;">capital </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tel-el-Amarna</span>. After the twentieth dynasty Thebes<br/>
gradually declined, although many kings, right down to the<br/>
time of the Ptolemies, made spasmodic <span style="color: #0000FF;">efforts </span>at building.<br/>
<br/>
Monuments and Antiquities of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luxor.-Three </span>days at<br/>
least are required to see the most interesting of the temples<br/>
and tombs, but a week or more can be very pleasantly spent<br/>
here, and many people stay the whole winter, so as to make<br/>
the most of the warm, dry <span style="color: #0000FF;">climate<br/>
