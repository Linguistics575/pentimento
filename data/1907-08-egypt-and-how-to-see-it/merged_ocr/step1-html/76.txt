<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE <span style="color: #ff0000;">IT<br/>
<br/>
</span>to have been the only attempt to escape from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence<br/>
</span>of the all-powerful Theban priesthood of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra</span>. He<br/>
preferred the worship of a single deity (the sun) to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">polytheism </span>of his predecessors, changed his name to Khuenaten, "The Splendour of the Sun," and obliterated the name<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-Ra </span>from the walls of his sanctuaries. The priests<br/>
appear, however, to have been too powerful for him, and he<br/>
found it impossible to live at Thebes.<br/>
<br/>
A site for a new capital was chosen at a point <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-way<br/>
</span>between Memphis and Thebes. The famous architect Bek<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>son of Men, was employed to build a magnificent royal city,<br/>
adorned with splendid temples, and containing a palace for<br/>
the king. This city was called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Elrhut-Aterr-</span>" The Horizon<br/>
of the Sun."<br/>
<br/>
Besides being a religious reformer, the king appears to<br/>
have encouraged the advance of art. Under his patronage<br/>
the enlightened Bek produced some exceedingly fine work,<br/>
of which an example is preserved in the beautiful stucco<br/>
pavements which formed part of the king's palace, and which<br/>
can still be <span style="color: #ff0000;">Been</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A number of very interesting cuneiform tablets were found<br/>
in 1887, being <span style="color: #0000FF;">despatches </span>to Amenhotep IV. from the rulers<br/>
of Mesopotamia and other Asiatic countries. These show<br/>
that the king's other interests had so monopolised him<br/>
that he was neglecting the affairs of the empire.<br/>
<br/>
Amenhotep passed the remainder of his life quietly at the<br/>
new capital with his mother and wife and his seven daughters.<br/>
Soon after his death his successors returned to Thebes and<br/>
the thraldom of Amen; the "City of the Sun<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>was allowed<br/>
to fall into <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins</span>, and art into its former convention<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

ASSIOUT<br/>
<br/>
A town of white minarets, white and grey houses, and<br/>
many <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-trees</span>, right under a big bluff <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>scarred, sandy<br/>
hill, it stands clear and clean against the plain, fortified from<br/>
the autumn <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood </span>by low mud bastions.<br/>
<br/>
There are fairly broad roads past fine houses and gardens,<br/>
leading then to winding, <span style="color: #0000FF;">narrow </span>streets. Many of these are<br/>
