<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Assouan </span>has, besides its ancient monuments, one great<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aehievement-the </span>Dam. This should certainly be<br/>
visited. It is at the upper end of the cataract, at Shellal.<br/>
about <span style="color: #0000FF;">six </span>miles by rail south of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assouan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>This work, <span style="color: #0000FF;">completed </span>in 1902, was four years in the building, and has had<br/>
a tremendous effect on the prosperity of Egypt. The river<br/>

Rocks at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shellal </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1<br/>
<br/>
</span>above the dam slopes upwards, but very gently, so that an<br/>
immense reservoir is formed, stretching south for 120 miles<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1<br/>
</span>In winter, when the river is high<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>some of the water is held<br/>
back and the reservoir gradually filled. At low Nile, in the<br/>
spring and summer<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>when Egypt has hardly enough water<br/>
to save herself from absolute drought, the sluices are <span style="color: #0000FF;">opened<br/>
</span>and the supply augmented, until, as the river begins to rise<br/>
for the next <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood</span>, the reservoir is empty<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I<br/>
</span>The Dam <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2180 </span>yds. long, 131 ft. high, and at present <span style="color: #ff0000;">holds </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l<br/>
</span>up the water 65 ft. It is built of the red Assouan <span style="color: #ff0000;">granite </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1<br/>
</span>used by the ancients for their most lasting memorials<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i<br/>
</span>The ancient history of Assouan is graven on its rocks.<br/>
Here are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Syene </span>quarries whence came the huge <span style="color: #ff0000;">granite </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l<br/>
