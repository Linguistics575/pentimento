<span style="color: #ff0000;">FACOUS<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Facous </span>is a fertile centre of palm-groves that branch off<br/>
to the East and South above small canals<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and villages with<br/>
quaint winding mud walls, along which the women pass<br/>
blue-gowned, their great water-jars on their heads. The big<br/>
canal, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baht </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Facous</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>divides into three or four other canals<br/>
that range through moderately fertile land and eventually<br/>

</span>lose themselves in that <span style="color: #ff0000;">semi-waste </span>end-of-the-world country<br/>
so characteristic of certain parts of the Delta. The line<br/>
past Azazi and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ekiad </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salhieh </span>is a very avenue of palms;<br/>
the permanent way is the high-road for choice. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salhieh </span>is<br/>
the end of all things, a palm-grove bounded by desert.<br/>
whence one can see almost to Kantarah and the Suez Canal.<br/>

DAMIETTA<br/>
<br/>
It is rather a far <span style="color: #0000FF;">my </span>to Damietta, but it can be seen in a<br/>
day, and one need not spend any great length of time there.<br/>
Besides, the journey itself by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>and Mansourah is<br/>
interesting to any one who really wishes to have an impression<br/>
of the Delta. <span style="color: #ff0000;">122<br/>
