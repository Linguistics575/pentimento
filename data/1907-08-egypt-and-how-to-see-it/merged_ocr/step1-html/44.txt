<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE <span style="color: #ff0000;">IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>probably dating from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">twelfth </span>century<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The church<br/>
itself was probably built in the sixth century; it is, however,<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>remarkably well-preserved <span style="color: #0000FF;">condition </span>In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corner<br/>
</span>of the right aisle is a cabinet containing caskets in which are<br/>
said to be preserved the bones of St. Barbara and of other<br/>
saints.<br/>
<br/>
The return journey may be made from St. George's <span style="color: #ff0000;">station<br/>
</span>by the Helouan railway to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Babel-Louk </span>station, or by crossing<br/>
the line and continuing towards the Nile the terminus of the<br/>
tramway may be reached<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Two churches in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky </span>quarter are worth seeing.<br/>
They are situated in the Sharia <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zuwila</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>lane leading out<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sharia-el-Souren</span>, which is the first turning to the left<br/>
after passing the tram-line which crosses the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky</span>. The<br/>
churches are built one above the other; the upper one <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
</span>divided, as in the case of the other churches, by screens<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>and contains the usual pictures of saints, among which are<br/>
those of the Virgin, St. Theodore, and St. George, which.<br/>
according to an inscription, are four hundred years old. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
</span>gallery above is occupied by <span style="color: #0000FF;">nun</span>, who are hidden from sight<br/>
by a tall screen.<br/>
<br/>
Below the level of this church, and communicating with<br/>
it by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight </span>of stairs, is the other, dedicated to the Virgin.<br/>
It has been recently restored, but great care has been taken<br/>
to leave it as much as possible in its original state. In an<br/>
annex is shown a greatly venerated picture of the Virgin<br/>
Mary and Child; the hands of the Child and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tiara </span>which<br/>
surrounds His head are of silver.<br/>
<br/>
HELOUAN<br/>
<br/>
Helouan has a certain distinction in that it is, so far, the<br/>
only modern "<span style="color: #ff0000;">desert </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>town in the north of Egypt. Its<br/>
chief merits are the fine air and the sulphur baths. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Obviously<br/>
</span>it is more a resort for invalids than for others, yet mani,<br/>
prefer it even to Cairo. A group of houses on <span style="color: #0000FF;">yellow </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sand</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>the range of high, sheer hills to the east, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">broad </span>plain down<br/>
to the river, and, beyond, the Pyramids<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakhara</span>. Dahshur.<br/>
and in the far distance Mena-such is Helouan, brilliant.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">olear-out</span>, and wind-swept, in keen sunlight. In the evening<br/>
all is enhanced by the glorious colouring of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sunset</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the<br/>
Pyramids stand out to the last; at first sharp and red, thev<br/>
become dim purple shapes, and then fade with the fading<br/>
