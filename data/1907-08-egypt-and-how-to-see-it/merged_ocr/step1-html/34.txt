<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">EGYPT</span>, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
Middle Ages. All <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>learning and knowledge is ignored.<br/>
The education is entirely free. Four of the nine rows of<br/>
pillars in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">liwan</span>, or sanctuary, were contributed by one<br/>
Abd-el-Rahman, whose tomb is in the building. This <span style="color: #ff0000;">h'wan<br/>
</span>is the principal hall of instruction (about 3600 <span style="color: #0000FF;">MI</span>. yds. in<br/>
area). The students sit on their heels round their respective<br/>
professors, and pay a varying degree of attention to his<br/>
lecture.<br/>
<br/>
The Sharia <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sanadikiah </span>leads from <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Azhar </span>to El-Ghouri<br/>
Mosque, the interior of which is interesting. Close to it is<br/>
the Mosque <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Moulaiyad </span>(1415 <span style="color: #0000FF;">A.D.</span>). Its fine bronze gate<br/>
was taken from the Sultan Hassan Mosque. The roof is<br/>
supported by marble columns, and the lower part of the back<br/>
wall, inlaid here and there with coloured marble, has seven<br/>
niches. The upper half is illuminated with texts in gold<br/>
lettering from the Koran. The roof is of dark material, on<br/>
which are worked gold arabesque patterns. The pulpit is<br/>
fine. The whole building was recently restored, and appears,<br/>
in consequence, cleaner and better preserved than other<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mosques</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Mosque of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Hassanein-close </span>to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sikket-elBadistan-dedicated </span>to the two grandsons of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prophet<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hassan </span>and Hussein, is the scene of the annual festival of the<br/>
Shi'ite <span style="color: #0000FF;">sect </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mussulmans </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>Persians). There is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>procession through the principal streets at night, led by<br/>
dervishes, who cut at one another with swords and cover<br/>
themselves with blood.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muristan</span>, or Hospital of Kalaoun, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barkuk<br/>
</span>Mosque (1410 A.D.) are close together in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sharia </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Nahasseen</span>, or street of the coppersmiths, who occupy the lower<br/>
parts of the Muristan.<br/>
<br/>
The Mosque of El-Hakim, further on, has two good <span style="color: #0000FF;">minarets</span>.<br/>
It has also the interest of being nearly as old as the Ibn <span style="color: #ff0000;">ElTouloun </span>Mosque (990 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>The two gates of <span style="color: #ff0000;">BabelFoutouh </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Nasr </span>are close at hand. They and this<br/>
mosque were fortified by the French. From the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bab-elNasr </span>one can get a <span style="color: #0000FF;">carriage-there </span>are always plenty standing<br/>
there-and drive back to one's hotel.<br/>
