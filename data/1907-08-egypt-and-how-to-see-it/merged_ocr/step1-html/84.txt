ANCIENT THEBES<br/>
<br/>
Modern Luxor occupies the site of the eastern suburb of<br/>
ancient Thebes. This city <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>perhaps the most important<br/>
of all ancient Egyptian towns. It was built on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right<br/>
</span>bank of the Nile, but the rocky hills on the western side were<br/>
used as a necropolis, and the kings and nobles bui t <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves </span>temples there, which became the centres of small<br/>
towns.<br/>
<br/>

dynasty, when its princes usurped the control of Upper<br/>
Egypt and increased in power until Amenemhet I. united<br/>
