<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ASSOUAN<br/>
<br/>
On arrival the matter of first importance is hotels. There<br/>
are three large ones. It is hard indeed to choose between<br/>
the Cataract and the Savoy. Both are <span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>in<br/>
delightful positions; both supply all that the visitor can wish.<br/>
The Cataract Hotel, built high above the Nile, of which<br/>
there is a splendid view both up and down, is perhaps the<br/>
most popular. The Savoy is on Elephantine Island, just<br/>
opposite the town, with gardens and trees. Both hotels<br/>
have tennis courts. A rather smaller hotel is the Grand<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>situated in the town facing the Nile; it has recently been<br/>
rebuilt, and is very comfortable. Full particulars of the<br/>
hotels are given on page 163.<br/>
<br/>
There is an English church near the Cataract Hotel, and<br/>
a resident chaplain holds regular services in winter.<br/>
<br/>
Assouan is not a great centre; its importance lies <span style="color: #0000FF;">principally </span>in its qualities as a winter resort and its archaeological<br/>
interest. It is for all practical purposes the southern <span style="color: #0000FF;">boundary </span>of Egypt, and the borderland between races who, for<br/>
all their relations one with another, have never mingled.<br/>
<br/>
Though a brazen furnace in summer, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assouan </span>can hardly<br/>
be surpassed as a health resort in winter. Surrounded by<br/>
desert, the air is dry, yet the usual penalty-dust-is absent.<br/>
Rain hardly ever falls. The days are warm and brilliantly<br/>
sunny, but seldom <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpleasantly </span>hot during the winter<br/>
months. The town appears <span style="color: #0000FF;">wonderfully </span>clean. There is a<br/>
refreshing novelty about the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scenery-the </span>town lays at the<br/>
foot of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>cataract, and the river is hedged in by rocks<br/>
and great rounded boulders of pleasing outline.<br/>
<br/>
Among the places of interest in and near the town, not<br/>
least are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bazaars-more </span>picturesque <span style="color: #ff0000;">than </span>most of their<br/>
kind. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Long- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">haired</span>, shaggy <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bishareen </span>stalk <span style="color: #0000FF;">past-often<br/>
</span>with a lance in their hand; <span style="color: #0000FF;">effendis</span>, Greeks, fellaheen, in<br/>
every kind of dress pass up and down. Many of the shops<br/>
are worth notice. Sudanese wares<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Dervish arms and<br/>
armour, and different objects of native manufacture make<br/>
up their varied <span style="color: #0000FF;">stock-in-trade</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>On the desert above the town is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bishareen </span>camp.<br/>
These nomads of the eastern desert, camel and sheep dealers<br/>
by trade, come into Assouan in winter and pitch their dis.<br/>
reputable-looking tents near the town. Many think them<br/>
worth <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>visit.<br/>
