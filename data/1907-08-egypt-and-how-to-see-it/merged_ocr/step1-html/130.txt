<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
papyri. Ptolemy <span style="color: #ff0000;">II</span>. (Philadelphus) built the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharcs</span>, a lighthouse of white marble. once one of the seven wonders of the<br/>
world. During the reign of the Ptolemies Alexandria must<br/>
have been a great and <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>city.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Thelibrary </span>and museum were <span style="color: #0000FF;">burnt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>ground on <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ulius<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cawar</span>'s entry into Alexandria. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>compensation Antony<br/>
is supposed to have presented Cleopatra and her city with<br/>
the library of Pergamus<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>in which <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>some 200,000 MSS.<br/>
This second library was destroyed by order of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caliph<br/>
</span>Omar about <span style="color: #0000FF;">640 </span>A.D.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>was a very wonderful building. Begun<br/>
bv Caesar and completed <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>Augustus, it held the statue<br/>
of Serapis<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>which was worshipped by both Greeks and<br/>
Egyptians.<br/>
<br/>
Alexandria was a great centre of Christianity and <span style="color: #0000FF;">persecution</span>; perhaps there was more internecine discord there<br/>
than in anv other city of Christian history. Every one who<br/>
has read Kingsley's book will remember the fate of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hypatia<br/>
</span>and the character the author gives to the fierce monks and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">priests </span>Arius, Athanasius, Cyril, Nestorius, and many a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">relentless </span>sectarian contributed their share to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrine<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">discord</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

<br/>
</span>POMPEY'S PILLAR AND THE CATACOMBS<br/>
<br/>
Few <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>of Alexandria's former greatness remain; the<br/>
most interesting are Pompey's Pillar and the Catacombs<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The former consists of a single red-granite shaft about <span style="color: #0000FF;">seventy<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">feet </span>high. It was erected by a Roman prefect of Egypt in<br/>
the reign of Diocletian. It can be easily reached by tram<br/>
from the Mohammed Aly Square in about ten minutes.<br/>
<br/>
A short distance west of Pompey's Pillar are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Catacombs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Among them are many interesting tombs of the first<br/>
four centuries <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ant</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>One fine tomb of the Roman period<br/>
was discovered in 1900, and is well worth a visit. It has<br/>
most interesting and beautiful reliefs both in Egyptian and<br/>
Roman style. Professor Wallis Budge in Messrs. Cook's<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">guidebook </span>goes into details fully and with admirable <span style="color: #ff0000;">preeis10n</span>.<br/>

The two obelisks known as "Cleopatra's <span style="color: #ff0000;">Needles </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>once<br/>
stood in Alexandria, but they have been removed and are<br/>
now, one in London and the other in New York.<br/>
