<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO <span style="color: #0000FF;">SEE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IT<br/>
<br/>
</span>The service is very primitive, consisting chiefly in long<br/>
extracts from the Scriptures, according to the ritual for the<br/>
day, read by the priest in either Coptic or Arabic<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The<br/>
priest is attired in a long black <span style="color: #ff0000;">robe</span>, and wears a fez, round<br/>
which is wound a turban of black <span style="color: #0000FF;">cloth</span>. This is a relic of the<br/>
old days when, according to the laws imposed upon them<br/>
by their Arab conquerors, the Copts were obliged to wear<br/>
this dress to distinguish them from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moslems</span>. They are<br/>
generally assisted in the service by boys, who form the choir,<br/>
carry the <span style="color: #0000FF;">censer</span>, and help to read the prayers.<br/>
<br/>
The majority of the ancient Coptic churches are to be<br/>
found in Old Cairo. The best way to reach them is by the<br/>
tram which goes down the Sharia-el-Ainv, starting originally<br/>
from the Ataba <span style="color: #ff0000;">ELKadra</span>, near the Post Office (the "Clapham<br/>
Junction "of all the trams). The road is lined with private<br/>
houses as far as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr-el-Ainy </span>Government Hospital, near<br/>
which is the Kasr-el-Ainy Mosque, where are the Howling<br/>
Dervishes. Just before reaching the Aqueduct (built in 1518<br/>
A.D.) a road turns off to the left, passes the old English<br/>
cemetery, and leads to the Convent of <span style="color: #0000FF;">St</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Menus </span>(Deir Mari<br/>
Mena), marked off from the other buildings by a small cross<br/>
on <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little belfry. It is surrounded by a wall, in which is a<br/>
gateway leading to a courtyard. Another doorway opposite<br/>
opens on to a little court, and thence into the precincts of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">church<br/>
<br/>
</span>Outside the entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>the boots of the few worshippers<br/>
attending the service. The walls of the apartment are<br/>
whitewashed<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and on two sides are some old pictures <span style="color: #0000FF;">representing </span>the Virgin Mary, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Crucifixion</span>, and other scenes<br/>
from the New Testament; opposite is a kind of balcony<br/>
reached by a pair of movable steps. The Mor is covered by<br/>
a well-worn carpet, bordered by rush matting. In the centre<br/>
is a small well containing water, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">which</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>on the Thursday<br/>
of Holy Week, the priest performs the ceremony of washing<br/>
the feet of his congregation; opposite this are a pair of<br/>
burning tapers in rude candlesticks, and close to them a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lectern</span>. From the beams in the roof, suspended by ropes<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>are glass candelabra of common but no doubt ancient workmanship. Around the walls are pictures of saints. In the<br/>
centre is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>reading-desk, with a large Bible, printed in Coptic<br/>
characters down the centre, with Arabic translation at the<br/>
side. On the left hand, separated by a screen, is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary </span>containing the altar<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
