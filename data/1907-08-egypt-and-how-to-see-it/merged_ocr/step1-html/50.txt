<span>EGYPT. AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
it will contain four hundred rooms, <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitted </span>with every comfort<br/>
as well as sitting-rooms, reading-rooms, <span style="color: #0000FF;">billiard-rooms</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>concert-rooms, bars, & c. <span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">c. </span>In a word, it is designed to<br/>
meet every wish and even caprice <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the visitor or resident<br/>
who cares to exchange the heat and dust and rush of Cairo<br/>
for the quiet and pure air of the desert. Further, the originators of the scheme have laid out a "Sporting Park," as<br/>
one may call it, for racing, golf, tennis, polo, and other games.<br/>
The purity <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the keen air, the sense of space, the beauty of<br/>
the surroundings, and the graceful design and arrangement<br/>
of the whole city lend an unusual charm and distinction<br/>
thereto.<br/>
<br/>
Another quarter is devoted to the provision of houses and<br/>
flats for residents whose slender means forbid the high rents<br/>
exacted in Cairo. There are also various fine <span style="color: #ff0000;">villas </span>and<br/>
mansions being <span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span>for the richer residents.<br/>
<br/>
There is a police station, a church<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>mosque in the<br/>
best Arabic style. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>a word, Heliopolis is to be a complete<br/>
city in the desert, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Giro </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">petto </span>with its own share <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>amusements and interests, and without many of the disadvantages that so often weary and annoy the Cairenes<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Mr<br/>
Edward Dicey<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C.B.</span>, a well-known writer on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>and<br/>
Egyptian questions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">says</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>of Cairo and of the<br/>
Pyramids and of the Delta as seen from the Suez desert<br/>
surrounding the Heliopolis Oasis City is one of the most<br/>
beautiful I have ever witnessed in any country of the world.'<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THE PYRAMIDS AND THE SPHINX<br/>
<br/>
Mena House, the Pyramids, and the Sphinx are as <span style="color: #0000FF;">accessible </span>as any one could wish nowadays. There is a really<br/>
good tramway service between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>(close to the Kasrel-Nil Bridge) and Mena.<br/>
<br/>
The fares are'. First class, 3 pt.; second class<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>ll pt.<br/>
<br/>
A special late tram leaves Mena House on <span style="color: #0000FF;">full-moon </span>nights.<br/>
<br/>
The cab fare from Cairo is <span style="color: #ff0000;">40 </span>pt. single, and 60 pt. return.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-hour</span>'s run by tram is distinctly attractive. At<br/>
first the line parallels the left bank of the Nile, and one can<br/>
watch the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mokattams </span>and Citadel, grey and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ciear-cut </span>against the sky by day, deep blue and black and<br/>
studded with yellow lights at night. At Gizeh the line<br/>
changes its direction<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>turning almost at right angles towards<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mens</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>After the bridge over the railway is passed, the<br/>
<br/>
