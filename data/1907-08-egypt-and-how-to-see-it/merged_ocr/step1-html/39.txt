fifteen minutes' walk from the Post Office. Tramways <span style="color: #0000FF;">also<br/>
</span>pass the door. It was founded by the late Khedive Ismail<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Path</span>, and removed in 1904 from somewhat unsuitable<br/>
quarters in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Darb-el-Gamamiz </span>to the fine building which<br/>

Fridays and Mohammedan holidays from 8 A.M. till one<br/>
hour before sunset.<br/>

application to one of the attendants.<br/>

Half of these are in European languages and deal with various<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tsubjects-history</span>, geography, and the different sciences;<br/>
the other half consists of books in Oriental languages. There<br/>
are more than thirteen thousand Arabic manuscripts.<br/>
<br/>
In <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>wing of the building especially set apart for them is<br/>
a very fine exhibition of illuminated <span style="color: #ff0000;">Korans</span>, dating for the<br/>

collection numbers seven hundred in all, and is the finest in<br/>
existence.<br/>
