<span>CAIRO<br/>
<br/>
where polo, golf, tennis, and croquet are played, and where<br/>
the races take place every fortnight during the season.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mane </span>House Hotel, at the Pyramids, must not be <span style="color: #0000FF;">forgotten</span>; it is about eight miles from Cairo, and is connected<br/>
with it by a good service of electric trams. The hotel is built<br/>
on the edge of the desert, close to the Great Pyramid-an<br/>
ideally healthy spot. The management is excellent, and the<br/>
arrangements as comfortable as at any hotel in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>.<br/>
<br/>

Cairo is the successor of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amru</span>'s city <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Fostat</span>, founded in<br/>
641 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Its foundations were marked out by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gawhar</span>, the<br/>
commander-in-chief of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caliph </span>Muizz, in 969 <span style="color: #0000FF;">An</span>, and it<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>named <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Kahira </span>"The Victorious," as the moment when<br/>
the digging was commenced was signified by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mars </span>being in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascendant</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>It was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>walled city with <span style="color: #0000FF;">gates-Bah-elNasr</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Foutouh</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Zouileh</span>. The Citadel was<br/>
built by Saladin. We need not dilate here on its history,<br/>
but we may cite the quaint and delightful description of it<br/>
by one Richard <span style="color: #0000FF;">Johnson</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Elizabethan</span>, who wrote the<br/>
lives and exploits <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>The Seven Champions of Christendom."<br/>
Really his impression of Cairo is too good to lose. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Apparently </span>the chronology is about 500 <span style="color: #0000FF;">An</span>, though we find a<br/>
Ptolemy reigning in Egypt contemporary with Coventry's<br/>
best <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>period. Another charming anomaly is that<br/>
the Great Pyramids <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>in Greece. and not at Gizeh; but<br/>
of course in those days there were Paladins, fair distressed<br/>
ladies, dragons, magicians, and fairies galore, and all this<br/>
may well compensate for a mere <span style="color: #0000FF;">chronological </span>or topographical<br/>
inaccuracy!<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>Grand Cairo," says Richard <span style="color: #0000FF;">Johnson</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>was then under<br/>
the subjection of the Egyptian monarchy, and the greatest<br/>
city of the world<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>for it was in breadth full three score miles,<br/>
and had by just account within its walls twelve thousand<br/>
churches, besides <span style="color: #0000FF;">abbeys</span>, priories, and houses of religion.<br/>
When St. George with his stately attendants entered the<br/>
gates, they were presently entertained with such a joyful<br/>
sound of bells, trumpets and drums that it seemed like the<br/>
inspiring music of heavenly angels, and to exceed the royalty<br/>
of Caesar in Rome when he returned from the world's<br/>
conquest: the streets were beautified with stately<br/>
pageants contrived by scholars of ingenious <span style="color: #0000FF;">capacity</span>, the<br/>
pavement strewed with all manner of odoriferous <span style="color: #ff0000;">fldwers</span>,<br/>
