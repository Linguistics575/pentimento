THE SINAI PENINSULA<br/>
<br/>
A visit to the Sinai Peninsula is an undertaking that<br/>
requires special preparations, and it is best to apply at once<br/>
to Messrs. Cook and Son, who are thorough experts in all<br/>
such matters. They will not only provide all possible and<br/>
necessary means of transport, but will arrange to charge a<br/>
fixed price per day. This saves all bargaining and trouble<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>and is by far the most comfortable and economical process.<br/>
<br/>
The expedition should take about three weeks, which<br/>
will give plenty of time for seeing the chief objects of <span style="color: #0000FF;">interest<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">peninsula </span>itself is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>mountainous desert, arid and<br/>
desolate, but with its own grandeur, and even <span style="color: #0000FF;">fascination<br/>
</span>It is inhabited by a number of Bedouins<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>who do a certain<br/>
amount of rather primitive trading in <span style="color: #0000FF;">gum-arabic</span>, charcoal,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">manna </span>from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tamarisk </span>trees.<br/>
<br/>
The real interest of the desert is its Biblical and Christian<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">historv</span>. One mav see Horeb, Sinai, and many another spot<br/>
associated with the wanderings of the Chosen People. A<br/>
visit should be made to the great monastery of St. Catherine,<br/>
founded by Justinian in 530 <span style="color: #0000FF;">An </span>It is the home of many<br/>
famous <span style="color: #0000FF;">manuscripts-above </span>all, the Sinaitic Codex of the<br/>
Septuagint, which Tischendorf retrieved after three visits.<br/>
The monastery is rich in relies and memorials of early saints<br/>
-St. Helena, Joachim, Simon Stylites of the Pillar, and<br/>
many another. It is one of the few remaining monuments<br/>
of the dawn of Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
It is hardly within the scope of this book to enter into a<br/>
full disquisition on all that others have so admirably described<br/>
from intimate knowledge and experience. We will but hint<br/>
at the ancient Church of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Transfiguration</span>, its strange<br/>
mosaics and medallions, and its great library, in which is<br/>
the Codex Aureus-twelve hundred years old, written in gold<br/>
on vellum-the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Psalter</span>, and many another treasure of pious<br/>
craftsmanship. A four days' visit is none too long for the<br/>
monastery and all that it can show.<br/>
<br/>
Another feature of the Sinai Peninsula is its importance as<br/>
a field for mining enterprise. There are records of its having<br/>
been worked as far back as the third dynasty, and the mines<br/>
bear inscriptions by many of the kings from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirteenth<br/>
</span>to the twentieth dynasties. Little further is heard of the<br/>
peninsula as a whole from <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. 1200 to the second or third<br/>
centuries of the Christian era. Turquoises, malachite, and<br/>
copper were the chief treasures found.<br/>
<br/>
Scarcely any attempts of importance have been made as<br/>
