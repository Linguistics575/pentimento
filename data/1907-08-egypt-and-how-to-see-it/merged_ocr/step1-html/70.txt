<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE <span style="color: #ff0000;">IT<br/>
<br/>
</span>The train is a fast and luxurious substitute. Every night;<br/>
through the season the trains de luxe run between Cairo<br/>
and Luxor; they are made up of dining- and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sleeping-cars</span>,<br/>
and only carry <span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class </span>passengers<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>These trains are really<br/>
as excellent as any in the world; they do not tear along and<br/>
shake the life out of the luckless passengers as do the vaunted<br/>
Riviera "flyers." The cars cannot be surpassed. They<br/>
have a double roof to preserve an even temperature, double<br/>
windows that keep out dust and Cinders; and, of course,<br/>
electric fans, ice, and any and everything one can wish for is<br/>
carried. Their great length and width ensures steady and<br/>
smooth running, <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>that one can sleep well all through the<br/>
journey.<br/>
<br/>
The trains from Cairo and Luxor respectively leave <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
</span>6.30 P.M., and dinner (price 25 pt.) is served at 7.30 P.M.<br/>
At the beginning and end of the season the "Trains de Luxe"<br/>
do not run, and a sleeping- and dining-car are put on to the<br/>
8 RM. from Cairo and the 5.30 <span style="color: #0000FF;">P.M. </span>from Luxor, three times<br/>
a week, in each direction.<br/>
<br/>
It <span style="color: #0000FF;">15 </span>as well to secure berths through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wagons- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lits<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Company</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">offices </span>in Cairo and the principal stations<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>or<br/>
through the tourist agencies.<br/>
<br/>
Those who wish to get some impression of the country,<br/>
and who do not mind a long journey by day, can leave Cairo<br/>
at 8.30 A.M., or Luxor at 7.0 A.M., and they will reach <span style="color: #0000FF;">their<br/>
</span>destination the same evening. They should, however, take<br/>
a luncheon-basket with them.<br/>
<br/>
The best months are from November to March, before and<br/>
after which periods the heat is rather too much for many<br/>
people. But if one cares to brave it, and owing to the purity<br/>
and dryness of the air it is not really so very trying, one<br/>
should go south in October; then Egypt presents her greatest<br/>
wonder, for the "Nile <span style="color: #ff0000;">overfloweth </span>all his banks," and the<br/>
world is one vast sheet of water from the railway to the hills.<br/>
The sunset fires it to a marvel of <span style="color: #0000FF;">flame </span>that fades to deep<br/>
red, then rose, at last steely black under the starlight.<br/>
Here and there a causeway cleaves the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood</span>, a village<br/>
stands out, a group of <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-trees </span>rise. The desert hills take<br/>
wonderful colours under the changing light.<br/>
<br/>
People who know no Arabic will probably need a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman<br/>
</span>or guide. It is, perhaps, best to engage one on the spot, and<br/>
not to take men from Cairo. The local guides know <span style="color: #0000FF;">their<br/>
</span>work and their monuments much better; besides, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>strange<br/>
