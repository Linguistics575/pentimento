<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE <span style="color: #ff0000;">IT<br/>
<br/>
</span>once, a collection of houses, and a low-lying line of sand.<br/>
and the ship is in the channel steaming between buoys<br/>
De Lesseps' statue dominates the harbour; one outstretched<br/>
finger points to his work, the great waterway that joins<br/>
East to West.<br/>
<br/>
Boats crowd round, full of shouting Arabs, and the moment<br/>
the ship stops there ensues a rush of frenzied hawkers and<br/>
minstrels. They sell cigarettes-beware of <span style="color: #0000FF;">those-lace</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">posts<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cards </span>of more or less dubious interest, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beater</span>'s telegrams<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>newspapers, anything that may extort piastres. Cook's is a fair<br/>
remedy if one has much baggage, though a single man of parts<br/>
and experience may well fight for his own hand. take one of<br/>
the native boats, and arrive even before Cook's men. The<br/>
Customs are not <span style="color: #0000FF;">exacting </span>as to personal effects; guns,<br/>
bicycles, and a few other <span style="color: #0000FF;">accessories-one </span>may call them<br/>
impersonal or <span style="color: #0000FF;">commercial-are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">liable </span>to a duty of 8 per cent.<br/>
on their value.<br/>
<br/>
Port Said is hardly <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>place at which to stay. The town is<br/>
not interesting, and it has few amusements.<br/>
<br/>
One unique phenomenon there is at Port Said, the coaling<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">night-a </span>hurricane of flying natives, lit up by <span style="color: #0000FF;">braziers<br/>
</span>that flare through the uncanny mist of coal-dust. They <span style="color: #0000FF;">fling<br/>
</span>their boards against the ship, rush up with full baskets,<br/>
hurl the coal into the bunkers, and rush down again. It is a<br/>
verv inferno of haste and <span style="color: #ff0000;">effieieney</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The hotels here are fair as to accommodation. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
</span>Savoy, on the sea-front, and the Eastern Exchange, in<br/>
the centre of the town, are the two best.<br/>
<br/>
If possible, it will be well to take the train at once. There<br/>
are three trains <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>day, at 8.10 A.M., 12.30 P.M., and 6.45 <span style="color: #0000FF;">P.M</span>.<br/>
The two latter have dining-cars, and the journey takes from<br/>
four and a half to five hours. Port Said is 237 kilometres<br/>
(about 150 miles) from Cairo. The fares are: First class,<br/>
95 pt.; second class, <span style="color: #0000FF;">171 </span>pt. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">restaurant-car </span>25 pt.<br/>
is charged for dinner and 20 pt. for lunch. The full timetable is given on page 175.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Port Said, the line runs parallel to the Suez Canal<br/>
and the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sweetwater</span>" Canal, Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Said</span>'s only source of<br/>
fresh water. On the right is at first the shallow Lake<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Menzaleh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>where one sees, in the winter time, quantities<br/>
of water-fowl, and now and again <span style="color: #0000FF;">pelicans </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flamingoes<br/>
</span>of vivid <span style="color: #0000FF;">plumage-rose</span>, scarlet, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flame-coloured</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kantarah</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>about <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>miles from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Port </span>Said<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>is one of the points<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">It<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
