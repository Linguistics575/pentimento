<span>CAIRO<br/>
<br/>
Opera Square; to the right hand are shops, opposite them the<br/>
Opera House, and to the left the railed-in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekieh </span>Gardens;<br/>
straight on is the wide Midan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abdin</span>, close to Abdin Palace.<br/>
Four main streets lead to the right from the square: the<br/>
Boulac road, just before the Continental Hotel, as yet<br/>
rather a dingy, tram-haunted street, though it will be fine<br/>
enough in <span style="color: #0000FF;">four </span>or five years' time, when the <span style="color: #ff0000;">BouhurGhezireh<br/>
</span>bridge is built; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sharia-el-Magraby</span>, wherein is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Angleterre </span>Hotel and also the Turf Club-a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine</span>, open street; then<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sharia-el-Manakh</span>, the Bond Street of Cairo; and the<br/>
. Sharia <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr-el-Nil</span>, which leads to the Savoy Hotel.<br/>
<br/>
One may go to the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge and look up the<br/>
river. The Semiramis, the British Agency, and other great<br/>
houses line <span style="color: #0000FF;">thebank</span>; down stream are the barracks, followed<br/>
by the quaint, native buildings of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Boulac </span>quarter, and<br/>
a mile or so away is the Embabeh railway bridge. The island<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>consists practically of the Sporting Club grounds,<br/>
and the quarter where are all the villas, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">north.</span>, All<br/>
the afternoon and evening smart carriages and <span style="color: #0000FF;">motor-cars<br/>
</span>career round it, and strings of polo ponies pass to and from<br/>
the polo ground. The road straight on from the bridge<br/>
and then to the left is one long avenue all the way to Gizeh,<br/>
and thence to Mena House and the Pyramids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr-el-Nil </span>bridge, which connects Cairo with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh</span>,<br/>
is opened every day from 1.30 RM. to 3 <span style="color: #ff0000;">RM</span>. to allow the<br/>
boats to pass up and down. At that hour it is impossible to<br/>
cross the bridge, and the only way to get to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
<br/>
</span>ferry (see page 199).<br/>
<br/>
The various interests on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>side of the river<br/>
are the Khedivial Sporting Club, the Aquarium and Grotto,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Zoological Gardens, and the Public Works Department<br/>
plantations. These last are well kept, and have many<br/>
beautiful trees and shrubs.<br/>
