CHAPTER VII<br/>
ALEXANDRIA<br/>
<br/>
ALEXANDRIA has not the same numerous attractions and<br/>
interests as Cairo, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">visitors </span>to Egypt usually neglect it.<br/>
Still, it is the second city in Egypt, a great commercial centre,<br/>
and a really fine town of considerable extent and population.<br/>
<br/>
The weather in spring is very pleasant, being warm and<br/>
sunny, with little rain. When Cairo has become too hot to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">becomfortable</span>, one may well go to Alexandria, as it is never<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unpleasantly </span>hot there.<br/>
<br/>
The suburbs of Alexandria are a special feature, especially<br/>
that known as Ramleh, to the east, where are many delightful<br/>
spring and summer resorts. Splendid bathing, boating, and<br/>
sailing can be had there. These is also the Sporting Club, which<br/>
corresponds with that in Cairo. Here one may play golf,<br/>
tennis, cricket, or football, and race meetings are held from<br/>
time to time in the spring and summer. The club is situated<br/>
at "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cassar</span>'s Camp," on the electric tram route from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>to Ramleh.<br/>
<br/>
An exceedingly good service of electric trams connects<br/>
Alexandria with the suburbs of Ramleh; they run from an<br/>
early hour in the morning till late at night. The station for<br/>
