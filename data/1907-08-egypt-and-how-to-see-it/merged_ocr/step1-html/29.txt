</span>AMUSEMENTS<br/>
<br/>
One need never be dull in the evening. Every night<br/>
there is sure to be some kind of entertainment at one or the<br/>
other of <span style="color: #0000FF;">.the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hotels-dances</span>, fancy-dress balls, cotillions, and<br/>

</span>MUSIC<br/>
<br/>
As far as music is concerned, a musical society for<br/>
quartette and chamber music in general is being founded<br/>
by a large and influential section of the more musical members<br/>
of the community. Hitherto the Cercle <span style="color: #0000FF;">Artistique </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shariael-Madabergh</span>) gave almost the only concerts in Cairo, but every<br/>
one now realises that it is high time to devote more attention<br/>
to these things.<br/>
<br/>
The Khedivial Opera House is a fine theatre situated in<br/>
the centre of the town. It is under a committee of <span style="color: #0000FF;">management</span>, who engage a company for the whole winter. Many<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">well-known </span>operas are given. It is somewhat difficult, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, to secure seats, as nearly all the boxes and stalls are<br/>
held for the season by abounds.<br/>
<br/>
The new Abbas Theatre is most enterprising, and has met<br/>
with well-deserved success since it started a short time ago.<br/>
