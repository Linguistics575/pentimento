<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE <span style="color: #0000FF;">IT<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span>II. to Amen. The entrance is, as usual, through a<br/>
pylon of <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>dimensions. On the inside are some very<br/>
realistic representations of the Syrian campaigns; on the<br/>
south side is the battle of Kadesh<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and on the north the<br/>
Egyptian army encamped.<br/>
<br/>
Very little remains of the first court, except the broken<br/>
Colossus of <span style="color: #0000FF;">R </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">meses</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>statue cut from a single <span style="color: #0000FF;">block </span>of<br/>
red granite. It must have been nearly sixty feet high<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>and even the fragments that now remain testify to the<br/>
excellence of the workmanship. The second court is in very<br/>
fair preservation; it was surrounded by colonnades, and<br/>
many of the columns (some with statues of Osiris) are still<br/>
standing. Beyond is the hypostyle hall of forty-eight<br/>
columns, reached by three flights of steps.<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>The two centre<br/>
rows have calyx capitals and are higher than the rest, forming a <span style="color: #0000FF;">clerestory </span>roof, as at Karnak; part of this roof is still<br/>
intact<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Leading from the great hall are two smaller halls<br/>
with columns, beyond which was the sanctuary and other<br/>
rooms. They are, however, in a very ruinous state<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>THE TOMBS OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">KURNET </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">MURRAI<br/>
<br/>
</span>To the west of the Ramesseum is the hill of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kurnet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Murrai</span>,<br/>
where there are several rock tombs of the eighteenth dynasty.<br/>
The most interesting is that of Huya, who was governor of<br/>
Ethiopia under King Tut-enkh-Amen. The wall sculptures<br/>
are worth examining.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the hill of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kumet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Murrai </span>is the small temple of<br/>
Deir-el-Medina, built by Ptolemy IV. and dedicated to Hathor.<br/>
If time allows, this is worth a visit.<br/>
<br/>
MEDINET HABU<br/>
<br/>
About a mile south of Deir-el-Medina are the temples of<br/>
Medinet Habu. The principal temple is that of Rameses III.;<br/>
it very much resembles the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum </span>in plan<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>but is in a<br/>
much better state of preservation. Many of the exploits of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses </span>III. are depicted on the walls. The reliefs on the<br/>
outside walls of the temple are worth notice; both naval and<br/>
military operations are there depicted.<br/>
<br/>
THE TOMBS OF THE QUEENS<br/>
<br/>
The Tombs of the Queens are about a mile to the northwest of Medinet Habu. That of Queen Titi is the most<br/>
