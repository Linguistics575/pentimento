<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>I come, I grant unto thee to overwhelm the peoples of<br/>
Asia, to lead into captivity the kings of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rotonou</span>. I<br/>
show unto them thy majesty when thou art clad in thine<br/>
armour, when thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">holdest </span>the spear in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">chariot</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>I come, I <span style="color: #0000FF;">grant </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unto </span>thee to overwhelm the land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>East; Haiti and Osi shall tremble before thee. Ishow unto<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">them </span>thy majesty, as it Were a young bull, great of heart,<br/>
horned, whom none can resist<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span>"I come<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>I grant unto thee to overwhelm the people who<br/>
dwell in their harbours: the lands of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mutanou </span>tremble<br/>
before thee. I show unto them thy majesty<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>it were the<br/>
River Horse, Lord of Fear on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">waters</span>, whom none may<br/>
approach<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>I come, I grant unto thee to overwhelm the peoples who<br/>
dwell in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">islands </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>they that dwell in the heart of the sea<br/>
shall hearken to thy shouting. I show unto them thy<br/>
majesty, as it were an avenger who <span style="color: #ff0000;">standeth </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>the back<br/>
of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">victim..<br/>
<br/>
</span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>come, I grant unto thee to overwhelm the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tahounou</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>the islands of the children of <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">avan </span>shall bow down to thy<br/>
thought. I show unto them thy majesty, as it were <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>raging<br/>
lion who <span style="color: #ff0000;">crouches </span>over the dead in their valleys.<br/>
<br/>
"I come, I grant unto thee to overwhelm the lands on<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-coast</span>: all the borders of the great circle of the<br/>
waters are bound to thy <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand </span>I show unto them <span style="color: #ff0000;">thy<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">maiesty</span>, as it <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>a hawk whose eye shall see swiftly <span style="color: #0000FF;">all<br/>
</span>that <span style="color: #ff0000;">pleaseth </span>him.<br/>
<br/>
"I come, I grant unto thee to overwhelm the peoples<br/>
that dwell in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">marshes</span>, to bind in captivity the lords<br/>
of the sands. I show unto them thy majesty, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>it were the<br/>
Jackal of the South<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Lord of Swiftness, going up and down<br/>
the two lands.<br/>
<br/>
"I come, I grant unto thee to crush the people of Nubia<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>even as far as the people of Punt: all is held in thy hand.<br/>
I show unto them thy majesty, like to the majesty of thy<br/>
two brethren Horus and Set, whose arm is with mine to<br/>
assure thy power.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>

</span>To the south of the great temple of Amen is a pool<br/>
of water, once the sacred lake; it was lined with stone.<br/>
There are also the remains of four more pylons, but they<br/>
are very much dilapidated. From the last pylon an avenue<br/>
of sphinxes leads to the temple of Mut, built by<br/>
