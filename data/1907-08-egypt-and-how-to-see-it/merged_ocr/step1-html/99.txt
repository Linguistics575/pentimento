<span style="color: #ff0000;">ESNEH<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>is a large native town on the west bank of the<br/>
Nile. Sir <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ohn </span>Aird and Co., the contractors for this as for<br/>
the Assouan dam, will give permission for those who wish<br/>
to see the barrage in <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction<br/>
<br/>
</span>The temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>is quite worth a visit. It is in the<br/>
centre of the town<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and in order to get there from the station<br/>

</span>the river must be crossed. Donkeys will be found at the<br/>
station to carry one as far as the river ferry (about ten<br/>
minutes); the charge is three or four piastres for the return<br/>
journey. One feature of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>is the baskets of particoloured straw which <span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span>be purchased in the town or at<br/>
the station.<br/>
<br/>
The temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Knoumu </span>is one of the latest of all Egyptian<br/>
monuments, erected in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>period and embellished<br/>
by various Roman emperors.<br/>
<br/>
The front is 37 m. broad and 15 m. high. At the centre<br/>
of the architrave is a solar disc<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>below which are inscriptions<br/>
in honour of Claudius and Vespasian. Rome is mentioned<br/>
as the centre of the world. These inscriptions were, of course,<br/>
far later than the construction of the temple itself.<br/>
<br/>
The capitals of the pillars are richly decorated. On one<br/>
