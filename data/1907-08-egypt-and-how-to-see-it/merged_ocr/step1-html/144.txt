<span>EGYPT. AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
about 4500 acres ot land under cultivation at present. The<br/>
principal trade is in dates; there are some 70.000 date-palms<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">F<br/>
</span>and the fruit is better <span style="color: #ff0000;">than </span>that grown anywhere in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The principal ancient Egyptian remains are the temple<br/>
of Hibis (mc. 521), in which is inscribed an interesting hymn<br/>
to the sun-god. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nadara</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>near the modern capital<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>are<br/>
three temples<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>one of the time of Ptolemy III. (u.c. 240)<br/>
and the other two of the time of Antoninus Pius (150 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Am.</span>).<br/>
There are the remains<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>also, of Roman <span style="color: #ff0000;">wateh-towers </span>and<br/>
forts. a circular <span style="color: #0000FF;">brick-kiln </span>and tombs, probably of the third<br/>
and fourth centuries of the Christian <span style="color: #0000FF;">era</span>. Near Ein Tabashir<br/>
are some curious buildings with tiny <span style="color: #0000FF;">cubical </span>recesses (eight<br/>
inches across), <span style="color: #ff0000;">which </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mav </span>have been dovecots.<br/>
<br/>
The Cases of Kurkur and Selima are quite <span style="color: #0000FF;">small</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>of no great interest. <span style="color: #0000FF;">belima</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it is true, was an important<br/>
station on the caravan route for the slave and other trades<br/>
from East and Central Africa through all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">oases </span>to Morocco.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Wady Natroun, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nation </span>Valley, is hardly an oasis<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>as <span style="color: #ff0000;">there </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IS </span>little or no cultivation. The valley-about<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">twentv </span>miles long-has several small salt <span style="color: #0000FF;">lake</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and is remarkable for its alkaline deposits, which furnish salt<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>sulphate<br/>
and carbonate of soda, and similar products. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">WadyNatroun </span>has considerable antiquarian interest, and is comparatively easy of access, being but a few hours from Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
There used to be a town in the middle of the valley-a<br/>
large settlement of Christian monks. St. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Macarius</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
Egyptian, was the pioneer of these recluses<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>to the number<br/>
of some 5000, as well as 600 desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">anchorites</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>He is<br/>
supposed to be buried in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monastery </span>which bears his<br/>
name<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Ten miles to the west of it is the Monastery of Anaba<br/>
Bishai, and further on the Syrian Monastery (Deir <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suriani</span>),<br/>
built by John the Dwarf in the time of Constantine. <span style="color: #ff0000;">it<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">possesseda </span>fine <span style="color: #0000FF;">library</span>, and even now contains three churches<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>the chief of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is dedicated to the Virgin. There is also<br/>
the Monastery of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baramus</span>, six or eight miles further west<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Natron Valley and its monasteries have been visited<br/>
by many travellers ever since Egidus <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lochiensis </span>in 1633.<br/>
and great stores of manuscripts have been recovered therefrom. They must have been veritable treasuries, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially<br/>
</span>Deir <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suriani</span>. Intending visitors should <span style="color: #ff0000;">consult </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>Visits to<br/>
Monasteries in the Levant," by the Hon. R. Curzon, who<br/>
visited the valley in 1837 (fifth edition, 1865).<br/>
