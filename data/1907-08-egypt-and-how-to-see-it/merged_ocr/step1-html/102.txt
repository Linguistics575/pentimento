<span>EGYPT. AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
A staircase of 242 steps and fourteen stages leads to the<br/>
platform of the pylon, and one can ascend by a corridor on<br/>
to the roof of the portico. In the front of the pylon there<br/>
are four recesses which formerly held the huge <span style="color: #ff0000;">flagrtaifs<br/>
</span>which were the feature of every Egyptian temple. An<br/>
inscription asserts that these were also used as lightning<br/>
conductors. It is a wonderful temple<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in'a </span>wonderful state<br/>
of preservation.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
After Edfou for some miles the railway winds round the<br/>
face of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliffs</span>, high above the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>. One of these is crowned<br/>
by the ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ELSin-ag</span>, a Roman fortress. After <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kagoug<br/>
</span>the line crosses the wide plain of Kom Ombo. Only three<br/>
years ago this was arid desert, but now, through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">enterprise </span>of Sir Ernest Cassel, as far as the eye can reach are<br/>
green crops and evidence of a thriving community.<br/>
<br/>
The next station, Daraw, is a fair-sized town; it is the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">starting-point </span>of the camel route to Berber and the Sudan.<br/>
As the train stops one is besieged by native sellers of fans<br/>
and other articles of Sudanese manufacture.<br/>
<br/>
THE TEMPLE OF KOM <span style="color: #0000FF;">OMBO<br/>
<br/>
</span>Donkeys (price 8 pt. to 10 pt.) can be obtained at Daraw<br/>
for the excursion to the temple of Sebek and Horus. Aride<br/>
of an hour and a half brings one to the site of the ancient<br/>
town-of importance in the time of the Ptolemies.<br/>
<br/>
The temple is on the edge of the Nile. Half (the right-hand<br/>
side) is dedicated to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crocodile-god </span>Sebek<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and the lefthand side to Horus. The pylon in front is partly destroyed.<br/>
Of the columns in the court beyond, <span style="color: #ff0000;">onlv </span>half their height<br/>
remains<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>but what is left is finely painted and in good preservation. After the court is the great hypostyle hall. The<br/>
roof has fallen, but its position is defined by two rows of<br/>
richly decorated pillars with palm-leaf capitals.<br/>
<br/>
. To the right of the north gateway is a finely worked <span style="color: #0000FF;">relief<br/>
</span>of the king, Neos Dionysius, receiving the benediction of a<br/>
lion-headed Isis and other gods, in the presence of Horus.<br/>
<br/>
The small <span style="color: #0000FF;">hypostyle </span>hall has also two rows of pillars; on<br/>
the shafts are pictures of Euergetes <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to the gods.<br/>
On the left wall (north-west) is a splendid relief of Horus<br/>
offering a curious. curved<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sickle-shaped </span>sword to Euergetes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>Behind the king are his sister Cleopatra and his wife.<br/>
