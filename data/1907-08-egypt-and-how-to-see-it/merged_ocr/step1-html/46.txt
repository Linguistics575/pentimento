<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
furnished with everything that can ensure the comfort and<br/>
entertainment of visitors.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Grand</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>is opposite the casino; it has a garden, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tennis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">courts</span>, and a croquet lawn. The interior arrangements leave<br/>
nothing to be desired, as the rooms are large and comfortably<br/>
fitted and the management is excellent. The Helouan Golf<br/>
Course and Club House belong to the "Grand," and are <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>great attraction to visitors.<br/>
<br/>
The Tewfik Palace was built as a palace by the Khedive<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewiik </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pacha</span>, who greatly appreciated Helouan and often<br/>
stayed there. The hotel is about ten minutes from the<br/>
station and close to the racecourse; it also possesses a<br/>
tennis court.<br/>
<br/>
The Hotel des Bains: this hotel has the advantage of being<br/>
close to the baths; it is quiet<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and the charges are moderate.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Hayat-the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sanatorium-high </span>up the hill-side. on<br/>
the desert, is a comfortable hotel, and is furnished with<br/>
modern conveniences.<br/>
<br/>
These are the principal hotels, but there are many smaller<br/>
ones as well as pensions and nursing-homes. A few of these<br/>
may be mentioned: The Hotel Heltzel<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Pension Antonio.<br/>
Pension Loir, and The Winter Hotel. These can be recommended.<br/>
<br/>
For full particulars of the hotels, see pages 158, 159.<br/>
<br/>
There is an English church in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helouan </span>and a resident<br/>
chaplain. All through the winter there is a resident doctor<br/>
who is in charge of the baths.<br/>
<br/>
The sports we have already mentioned. The race meetings<br/>
are held by the Helouan Sporting Club under the rules of the<br/>
Cairo (Khedivial) Sporting Club. There are bands at the<br/>
Casino Gardens and at the hotels, and concerts and dances<br/>
are given from time to time. To the sights which can be<br/>
visited from Helouan<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>one may add the Monastery, tombs<br/>
and caves at Massarah, four miles away and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ten </span>minutes by<br/>
train. The stones for the Pyramids came from these caves,<br/>
in which are many inscriptions and names. The places of<br/>
interest at the Cairo end of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">line-such </span>as the Aqueduct.<br/>
Coptic churches, <span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e.</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>mention elsewhere under Cairo;<br/>
but they can quite easily be reached from Helouan. Further.<br/>
the Delta Light Railway Company have erected a stand for<br/>
the ceremony of the Holy Carpet at the Citadel, and the<br/>
principal hotels sell tickets for train fares and admission<br/>
thereto.<br/>
