<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>

<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111+ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">day</span>! Cairo can hardly, even now, attain the<br/>
gorgeous dimensions and aspect pictured by the writer's<br/>
genial fancy, but it is a fine city, and of great extent' to the<br/>
east and south <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abbassieh</span>, the Citadel, then Old Cairo,<br/>
then <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh</span>; then Boulac, once the port of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">metropolis</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>then, going northwards, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Choubra-auch </span>are its boundaries.<br/>
It has well over half a million inhabitants, and a very large<br/>
European community, and is no mean city in appearance.<br/>
Stand on the ramparts of the Citadel, and you will see the<br/>
countless houses and mosques, the quiet, broad stream of the<br/>
Nile, and, far off, the sharp grey forms of the Pyramids.<br/>
Turn round, and the old dead town is below you, silent, a<br/>
city of tombs; hard by, they seem close together, tombs<br/>
and voiceless huts; farther off, where the desert begins,<br/>
are the domed shrines, more <span style="color: #0000FF;">sparse </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuous</span>, of the<br/>
Caliphs and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>, under the shadow of the Red <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mountain </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mokattams</span>. To the north are the villages on<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh </span>line, a long string of European houses-almost<br/>
a new city-ranging from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pont </span>de <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koubbeh </span>out to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh<br/>
</span>itself. Beyond is desert, and the low hills that seem to bound<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">it-post</span>, clearest yellow and white. One <span style="color: #0000FF;">far-off </span>native<br/>
village, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kafr </span>Gamous, stands out like a tiny <span style="color: #0000FF;">fishing </span>hamlet.<br/>
Its minaret might be the lighthouse at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>harbour mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Cairo at present has a slightly <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished </span>aspect, owing to<br/>
the immense amount of building involved by the extraordinary incursion of people of all sorts and nationalities<br/>
during recent years. Those who only knew Cairo <span style="color: #ff0000;">ten </span>or<br/>
fifteen years <span style="color: #ff0000;">ago </span>cannot recognise it now, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>crowded<br/>
streets, fine shops, high white houses, huge <span style="color: #0000FF;">hotels</span>, and<br/>
expansion on all sides. Where were almost waste places are now<br/>
streets; what was native suburb is now a European quarter.<br/>
<br/>
A walk through the main streets is interest enough <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>itself.<br/>
You pass "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Shepheard</span>'s,<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>its balcony crowded with curious<br/>
and amused tourists. Hawkers of all sorts are yelling, or<br/>
coaxing possible purchasers, offering postcards, ornamental<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">By-whisk</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">walking-sticks</span>, shawls, "<span style="color: #ff0000;">antilras</span>," scarabs fresh<br/>
from the factory. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Snake-charmers </span>and boys with tame<br/>
monkeys are performing their antics on the sidewalk.<br/>
Carriages and foot-passengers crowd the road and pavements.<br/>
At the <span style="color: #0000FF;">open-air </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">caf√©s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sitting </span>crowds of Egyptians <span style="color: #0000FF;">or-in </span>the<br/>
evening-foreigners of all <span style="color: #0000FF;">kinds</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The street widens out at <span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">26<br/>
