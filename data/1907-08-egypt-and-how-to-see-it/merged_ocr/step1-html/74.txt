<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE <span style="color: #ff0000;">IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>Ibrahimieh Canal, whose boats, toiling up or drifting down<br/>
stream, are picturesque enough.<br/>
<br/>
From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bibeh </span>(kilo. 145) one may visit <span style="color: #ff0000;">Deshashah-the </span>ride<br/>
takes about two and a half hours-and see some interesting<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fifth-dynasty </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs</span>. After <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bibeh </span>the aspect of the country<br/>
changes<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the colours are clearer and richer, and cotton begins<br/>
to give place to cereals and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar-cane</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Minieh (kilo. 248) is a large town, but nothing more.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Abou-Kerkag </span>(kilo. 268) is the starting-point for the rock<br/>
tombs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beni-Hassan</span>.<br/>
<br/>
TOMBS OF BENI-HASSAN<br/>
<br/>
The journey from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abou-Kerkas </span>station to the rock tombs<br/>
takes about two hours<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The station-master will procure<br/>
donkeys, but it is as well to give him notice beforehand by<br/>
telegram. The price for donkeys is from 10 pt. to 15 pt<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>for the day. The charge on the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">ferry-boat </span>is<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>pt.<br/>
each, but a little extra must be given for the donkeys; the<br/>
donkey-boys will also expect a piastre or two <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>bakshish.<br/>
<br/>
The river, which is crossed in the usual Nile ferry-boat, is<br/>
about half an hour away, and after leaving the modern <span style="color: #ff0000;">BeniHassan </span>village one passes along the edge of the desert,<br/>
striking sharply uphill and arriving at length at a rocky<br/>
terrace. Cut into the hillside can be seen the entrances to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">thirtymine </span>tombs, a long line of doorways facing the<br/>
river. These are in varying degrees of preservation. <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">umbers<br/>
</span>2, 3, <span style="color: #0000FF;">15</span>, 17 are in a good enough state, and are of considerable<br/>
interest. They were probably excavated in the time of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsens </span>of the twelfth dynasty, and they are covered with<br/>
wall paintings that give, with vivid accuracy, the life of<br/>
4500 years ago. There are men and women in all their daily<br/>
pursuits, fishing, hunting, weaving, and even at <span style="color: #0000FF;">dinner-L<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>succession of the common daylight occupations and<br/>
interests, concessions to the needs of humanity and its<br/>
amusements. A strange race these Egyptians, who could<br/>
write their history, their theology, and even their diary on<br/>
the walls of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>catacomb. Their tombs are catalogues of<br/>
life, and their palaces instinct with the presence and threat<br/>
of death.<br/>
<br/>
If the visitor has the energy to <span style="color: #0000FF;">climb </span>the slope at the<br/>
back of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs-it </span>need not take more than ten minutes<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">-he </span>will see in front the splendid range of Nile and green<br/>
valley, and behind the arid desert, rolling, <span style="color: #0000FF;">limitless</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">74<br/>
<br/>
