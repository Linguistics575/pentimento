<span>THE SUDAN<br/>
<br/>
"At <span style="color: #0000FF;">present </span>the population of the Sudan has not been<br/>
demoralised by indiscriminate almsgiving, but it will not<br/>
require much of this to make the demand "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bukehish </span>/<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>as <span style="color: #0000FF;">importunate </span>and annoying to travellers as in Egypt itself, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>to cause a considerable number of natives to forsake the<br/>
paths of honest industry for the unwholesome existence of<br/>
preying upon <span style="color: #ff0000;">others</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>His Excellency the Governor-General trusts that all<br/>
travellers will consider this as a personal request from <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself</span>, and at the same time would inform them that if they<br/>
desire to give any money for the benefit of the inhabitants<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
</span>contributions for hospitals or relief of poverty, assistance<br/>
to the sick, and relief of deserving <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases </span>amongst the poorer<br/>
classes will be carefully administered by the Governors, and<br/>
he himself will gratefully receive contributions for what is the<br/>
Sudan's greatest need, viz., education.<br/>
<br/>
"By Order of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Governor-General</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">( </span>Signed) F. J. NASON, Lewa."<br/>
