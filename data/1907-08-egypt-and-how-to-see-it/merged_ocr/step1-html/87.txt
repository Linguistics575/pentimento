columns in rows of eight. Many of these are exceedingly<br/>
well preserved, and on the under sides of the capitals a good<br/>
deal of the original colouring remains, still brilliant, <span style="color: #0000FF;">testifying </span>to the wonderful lasting power of the colours used by<br/>
the Egyptians, and giving some idea of the gorgeous appearance these old temples must have presented when every<br/>
inch of column, wall, and ceiling was covered with highly<br/>
coloured sculptures of gods and kings.<br/>
<br/>
To the south of the hall of columns are several smaller<br/>
chambers; and in the centre of these was the sanctuary of<br/>
the god.<br/>
<br/>
Several of the other rooms are interesting, <span style="color: #ff0000;">espeeialy </span>one<br/>
called <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>Birth Chamber." Its walls bear reliefs depicting<br/>
the birth of Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>Another chamber, adapted<br/>
apparently by Alexander<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>son of Alexander the Great, has<br/>
reliefs of its builder worshipping Amen; another shows signs<br/>
of having been used as an early Christian church.<br/>
<br/>
In the days of Thebes' greatness a broad road led from<br/>
the north pylon of the temple of Luxor to the great temple<br/>
of Karnak, lined throughout its length-over a mile and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>half-on either side with sphinxes. To-day but a few traces<br/>
of it remain. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">scent </span>extent uncovered near Karnak<br/>
suggests its ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificence</span>.<br/>
<br/>
THE TEMPLES OF KARNAK<br/>
<br/>
There is a good <span style="color: #0000FF;">road </span>from Luxor, and carriages can be<br/>
taken. The excursion may also be made on donkeys (price<br/>
5 <span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Besides </span>the great temple of Amen, there are at Karnak<br/>
several smaller temples, of which those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mat </span>and Khons<br/>
are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>important. First the immense archway of<br/>
Euergetes is seen in the distance, and the road passes between<br/>
rows of sphinxes, and then <span style="color: #0000FF;">appears </span>the temple of Khons<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>fronted by its pylon. This temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>erected by Rameses<br/>
III. and his successors to the honour of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>moongod Khons, son of Amen and Mut.<br/>
<br/>
It consists of the usual <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>court, hypostyle hall,<br/>
and sanctuary. Parts are well preserved, and the inscriptions are interesting. To the left is the small temple of<br/>
the goddess Apet and of Osiris, which is worth examining.<br/>
<br/>
Two hundred yards to the north is the great temple of<br/>
