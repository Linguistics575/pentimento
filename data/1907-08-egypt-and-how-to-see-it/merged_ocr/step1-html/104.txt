<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE <span style="color: #ff0000;">IT<br/>
<br/>
</span>There are three rooms to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">north-east</span>. In the third is<br/>
a relief of Ptolemy Philometor, followed by Cleopatra and<br/>
the two gods of the temple, receiving from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khons </span>the emblem<br/>
of long life. At this end of the temple are the two <span style="color: #ff0000;">sanc<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rom </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mbo<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">marks</span>, that of Sebek to the right and of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home </span>to the left.<br/>
In front of the temple, on the terrace, close to the two<br/>
sanctuaries, is a small temple devoted to the birth-goddess<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>but it is mostly in ruins. Last of all is the little unfinished<br/>
chapel dedicated by Domitian to the glory of Hathor.<br/>
<br/>
Between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Daraw </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh</span>, where the line at times<br/>
skirts the river, are wonderful views of the sweeping curves<br/>
of the Nile. Palms on the far bank stand out against the<br/>
brilliant ochre of the desert hills.<br/>
<br/>
A subtle change seems to have come over the country.<br/>
It is all of a sudden the Egypt of the picture-books known<br/>
in one's childhood. The river, sand, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-trees </span>are old<br/>
friends. One looks for a crocodile at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">waterside</span>.<br/>
<br/>
After <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>comes the junction for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shellal</span>, and then<br/>
Assouan.<br/>
