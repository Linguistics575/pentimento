</span>UPPER EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>name "Upper <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>is applied to the country south<br/>
of Cairo as far as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Soudan </span>frontier-near Wadi-Halfa.<br/>
Sometimes the name Middle <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egvpt </span>is used for the stretch<br/>
between Cairo and Assiout, south of which is Upper Egypt<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">proper..<br/>
<br/>
</span>Above all things, those who visit this country<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>even if<br/>
only for a short time, should see Luxor and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assouan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ideally </span>dry, warm and healthy, set in fine rugged hill scenery<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>the home of monuments as wonderful as any the world<br/>
possesses<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>they should be the principal goal of all travellers<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>Land of Khem."<br/>
<br/>
The time-honoured highway is, of course, the Nile. Tourist<br/>
steamers (for which, see page 203) pass up and down <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently</span>; wealthy visitors may hire a private sailing, or,<br/>
better still, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>steam <span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabeah </span>(or house-boat), but the railway has been so greatly improved lately as to be acknowledged the most comfortable and convenient route. The river<br/>
journey has, of course, its pleasures and even luxuries, but it<br/>
can become tedious, and steamers are sometimes overcrowded<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
