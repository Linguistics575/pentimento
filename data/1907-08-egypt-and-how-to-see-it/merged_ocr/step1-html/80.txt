<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The other temple, built by Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, is not in anything<br/>
like the same state of preservation<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>only a part of the outer<br/>
walls and a few statue-columns remain. There was here a<br/>
second tablet, copied from that of Seti's temple, and now<br/>
removed to the British Museum; but, unlike the original,<br/>
it is mutilated. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hard </span>by, to the north, is the tomb of Osiris,<br/>
and a mound of <span style="color: #0000FF;">debris </span>formed by the countless tombs of<br/>
ancient Egyptians who sought to be buried near Osiris. So<br/>
does Abydos represent at once the birth of Egypt and its<br/>
greatest period; and, more, it holds the historical record<br/>
of all the greatest who reigned, from Osiris and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menes </span>even<br/>
to the days of Seti and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rameses-a </span>great and ancient monument indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Nag-Hamadi (kilo. 556) is the centre of a large sugar<br/>
district, and the factory is a model of the most modern<br/>
requirements of that industry.<br/>
<br/>
Just beyond Nag-Hamadi the railway crosses the Nile,<br/>
and keeps to the east bank from this point onwards. The<br/>
hills begin to close in towards the river, and culminate near<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dabbeh </span>in the huge sheer <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliff </span>of Gabel-el-Tarif (left-hand side).<br/>
<br/>
Keneh (kilo. 611) is the home of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">potters</span>, the source of<br/>
the porous jars and bottles of fascinating shapes which one<br/>
sees all over Egypt. Water in them cools naturally and<br/>
automatically. It is rather interesting to see the native<br/>
potter turning the primitive wheel with his foot; the shapeless clay rises to his touch and takes its appointed form.<br/>
Many of the houses in the town have their walls built of the<br/>
spoiled jars, which gives them a curious <span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance<br/>
<br/>
</span>Keneh is the starting-point for the expedition to the temple<br/>
of Hathor at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dendera</span>.<br/>
<br/>
DENDERA<br/>
<br/>
Dendera is some five miles-about an hour's donkey <span style="color: #0000FF;">ride-from </span>Keneh. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ts </span>chief feature is its modernity. The Temple is<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lateJ</span>? <span style="color: #ff0000;">tolemaie </span>period. One perceives at once a tendency<br/>
to depart from the rather grim convention; the figures on<br/>
the walls are more lifelike, their faces more expressive, and<br/>
the great crowning heads of Hathor on the pillars are really<br/>
beautiful and impressive in themselves. Evidently those<br/>
who designed the temple and its decorations were thinking<br/>
of Greek philosophy as well as of Egyptian mythology.<br/>
