hall are in good preservation, but have become so black as<br/>
to be almost invisible.<br/>
<br/>
To right and to left of the entrance are two chapels, one<br/>
of which was used as a library. The MSS<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>kept there <span style="color: #ff0000;">were<br/>

</span>catalogued on the walls. The other was called the room of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">purification</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>This rite <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>similar to Christian baptism,<br/>
and consisted in aspersions of holy water. There is a picture<br/>
of the king being purified by Horus and Thoth.<br/>
<br/>
The finest and most delicately conceived relief is that on<br/>
the north wall of the hall above the door; it depicts a solar<br/>
disc and a winged <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarabeus </span>in a boat, with two hawk-headed<br/>
figures of Horus. The hypostyle is supported by twelve<br/>
pillars with <span style="color: #0000FF;">floral </span>capitals and rich decoration.<br/>
<br/>
The walls of the temple are beautifully painted; everywhere are figures of Horus and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span>. The most important<br/>
is the west wall, on which is the textual and pictorial description of the battles of Horus. His foes have crocodile and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hippopotamus </span>heads. With Horus are associated the king<br/>
and Isis. In the first relief the king and Horus are each<br/>
slaying a hippopotamus with <span style="color: #0000FF;">javelins</span>.<br/>
