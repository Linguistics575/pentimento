EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

price being 10 pt. each tor the day; it is a ride of about
an hour and a half to Sakkara.

One can visit Sakkara from Helouan; in this case the
river has to be crossed by ferry, and altogether it will take
about two hours and a half.

The third route is across the desert, about two hours
from Mena House by donkey-or better, by sand-cart, a
curious but most adequate vehicle with broad tyres for
driving on loose sand. This route leads direct to Sakkara.

which is really the shortest, easiest and most practical, must
be taken.

Lunch should be brought from Cairo; here the luncheonbasket is a useful necessity. Lunch can be taken at Mariette's
House, close to the principal points of interest, where tables,
chairs, ke., are arranged in the shade. Candles or an acetvlene bicycle lamp should also be brought, for exploring the
underground tombs. If a general Antiquity Pass (see page
171) has not been purchased, tickets for Sakkara alone can be
obtained at Mariette's House, the Museum in Cairo, or of
Messrs. Cook and Son, at 5 pt. per head.

The ruins of Bedreshein and Sakkara are the relics of that
great city Memphis, one of the most famous of all ancient
cities.

The village of Bedreshein stands on the site of the old
town, and as this was situated in the valley which is covered
each year by the inundation, little indeed remains of its
former greatness; the Colossi of Rameses. the foundations
oi a temple of Ptah, and a few scattered mounds are all that
is left. Above, on the edge of the desert, was the necropolis
of Memphis, and here there are many weli-preserved monuments of the earliest times.

Memphis. It is said, was founded by Menes, first mortal
king of Egypt. During the third, fourth, and fifth dynasties
it was the capital of all Egypt, the Royal city. Its kings
built palaces and temples of unrivalled magnificence, and
provided vast tombs to immortalise their greatness.

Throughout the history of Egypt Memphis was of the
greatest importance, though only for short periods the capital.
and even in Ptolemaic times it was a large and thriving city.
The triad, Ptah, Sekhet, and Best were the principal deities;
they resemble the Theban triad Amen, Mut, and Khons.
