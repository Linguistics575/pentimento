EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT



cisterns twenty-two metres deep. A reservoir, forty by
seventy metres, has been found close by. In another part
of the Koinpbion a dining-hall has been discovered. It was
probably reserved for distinguished guests. Here was
found a magnificent relief in white marble. The roof of
this hall was supported by columns, and the walls were
covered with marble and porphyry. The Rev. C. M. Kaufmann informs us that, judging from the numerous fine
capitals which have of late been found on the west side of
the monastery, he hopes to come upon the church of St.
Thekla, which is mentioned in the life of the saint. This
church was within the Koinobion, and probably some highly
important discoveries will be made there."

ABOUKIR

A very pleasant excursion may be made to Aboukir, a
small village about ten miles east of Alexandria, along the
coast. It has much historical interest, both ancient and
modern. Near it stood the great city of Canopus in Ptolemaic times, and here the Canopic branch of the Nile entered
the sea. According to Seneca, Canopus was ohiefly remarkable for the luxury and depravity of its inhabitants.

In later times Aboukir is famous as giving its name to
Nelson's great battle and victory over the French Met in
1798. Napoleon defeated the Turkish army in 1799 at
Aboukir, and his army was defeated there by Sir Ralph
Abercrombie in 1801.

There are frequent trains to Aboukir from Sidi-Gaber
1Alexandria-Rarnleh Railway Company's station). The
journey occupies about thirty-iive minutes. The following
are the best trains:

From Sidi Gaber: 10.50 A M, 2.0 and 4.10 P.M.
1., Aboukir: 1.10, 4.55, 7.0, and 8.35 P M.

The fares are' 1st class, single, l pt.; return, 6 pt.

A good way of making the expedition is to go to Aboukir
by railway and on the return to charter donkeys and ride
back to San Stefano along the coast. From San Stefano
the electric tram takes one to Alexandria in a few minutes.
