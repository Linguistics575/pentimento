EGYPT. AND HOW TO SEE IT



about 4500 acres ot land under cultivation at present. The
principal trade is in dates; there are some 70.000 date-palms, F
and the fruit is better than that grown anywhere in Egypt.

The principal ancient Egyptian remains are the temple
of Hibis (mc. 521), in which is inscribed an interesting hymn
to the sun-god. At Nadara, near the modern capital, are
three temples. one of the time of Ptolemy III. (u.c. 240)
and the other two of the time of Antoninus Pius (150 Am.).
There are the remains, also, of Roman wateh-towers and
forts. a circular brick-kiln and tombs, probably of the third
and fourth centuries of the Christian era. Near Ein Tabashir
are some curious buildings with tiny cubical recesses (eight
inches across), which mav have been dovecots.

The Cases of Kurkur and Selima are quite small. and
of no great interest. belima, it is true, was an important
station on the caravan route for the slave and other trades
from East and Central Africa through all the oases to Morocco.

The Wady Natroun, or Nation Valley, is hardly an oasis,
as there IS little or no cultivation. The valley-about
twentv miles long-has several small salt lake; and is remarkable for its alkaline deposits, which furnish salt, sulphate
and carbonate of soda, and similar products. The WadyNatroun has considerable antiquarian interest, and is comparatively easy of access, being but a few hours from Cairo.

There used to be a town in the middle of the valley-a
large settlement of Christian monks. St. Macarius, the
Egyptian, was the pioneer of these recluses, to the number
of some 5000, as well as 600 desert anchorites. He is
supposed to be buried in the monastery which bears his
name. Ten miles to the west of it is the Monastery of Anaba
Bishai, and further on the Syrian Monastery (Deir Suriani),
built by John the Dwarf in the time of Constantine. it
possesseda fine library, and even now contains three churches,
the chief of which is dedicated to the Virgin. There is also
the Monastery of Baramus, six or eight miles further west.

The Natron Valley and its monasteries have been visited
by many travellers ever since Egidus Lochiensis in 1633.
and great stores of manuscripts have been recovered therefrom. They must have been veritable treasuries, especially
Deir Suriani. Intending visitors should consult "Visits to
Monasteries in the Levant," by the Hon. R. Curzon, who
visited the valley in 1837 (fifth edition, 1865).
