EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

monoliths for many a mighty statue, temple, and obelisk;
indeed, wherever the red granite is seen throughout all
Egypt every stone had its origin in these quarries, cut
laboriously with primitive tools from the rocks of Assouan.
shaped and smoothed with consummate skill, then floated
down the river on vast rafts, and finally dragged, by the
labour of thousands. to their resting-place in some far
northern shrine. One huge obelisk. 90 ft. long, can be Been
at the quarries, half excavated, with one face still joined to
the mother rock.

These quarries, which are to the south of the town, should
be visited (donkeys, 5 to 8 pt.).

PHILIE

The most remarkable monuments are on the island of
Philae, a short distance from the dam. The island has been
called the "Pearl of Egypt," and certainly its setting is
most beautiful.

The temples, of which there are several, all date from the
Ptolemaic period. No doubt there were earlier shrines. but
these have disappeared.

The best way to visit Phila, is to take the train from Assouan to Shellal. The journey takes half an hour. The
trains are as follows:

From Assouan' 7.0, 9.0, 10.45 A.M., 2.10, 4.0, and 5.10 P.M'
From Shellal: 8.0, 9.40, 10.5 ALL, 12.0, 2.50, and 6.0 RM.

The fares are: First class, 6 pt.; second class, 3 pt.

At Shellal boats are in waiting.

Since the construction of the Assouan dam the island of
Philae is submerged from about the middle of January till
the middle of June. When the water is high the temples
must be approached and entered by boat.

After exploring Philae a visit to the dam can be made,
and then one can return to Assouan by boat, down the
cataract..

ELEPHANTINE ISLAND

There are the remains of several temples on the south
end of the Island of Elephantine, opposite the Cataract
Hotel, and also a very old Nilometer, which is worth seeing.
