EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT



furnished with everything that can ensure the comfort and
entertainment of visitors.

The "Grand,, is opposite the casino; it has a garden, tennis,
courts, and a croquet lawn. The interior arrangements leave
nothing to be desired, as the rooms are large and comfortably
fitted and the management is excellent. The Helouan Golf
Course and Club House belong to the "Grand," and are a
great attraction to visitors.

The Tewfik Palace was built as a palace by the Khedive
Tewiik Pacha, who greatly appreciated Helouan and often
stayed there. The hotel is about ten minutes from the
station and close to the racecourse; it also possesses a
tennis court.

The Hotel des Bains: this hotel has the advantage of being
close to the baths; it is quiet, and the charges are moderate.

El-Hayat-the Sanatorium-high up the hill-side. on
the desert, is a comfortable hotel, and is furnished with
modern conveniences.

These are the principal hotels, but there are many smaller
ones as well as pensions and nursing-homes. A few of these
may be mentioned: The Hotel Heltzel, Pension Antonio.
Pension Loir, and The Winter Hotel. These can be recommended.

For full particulars of the hotels, see pages 158, 159.

There is an English church in Helouan and a resident
chaplain. All through the winter there is a resident doctor
who is in charge of the baths.

The sports we have already mentioned. The race meetings
are held by the Helouan Sporting Club under the rules of the
Cairo (Khedivial) Sporting Club. There are bands at the
Casino Gardens and at the hotels, and concerts and dances
are given from time to time. To the sights which can be
visited from Helouan, one may add the Monastery, tombs
and caves at Massarah, four miles away and ten minutes by
train. The stones for the Pyramids came from these caves,
in which are many inscriptions and names. The places of
interest at the Cairo end of the line-such as the Aqueduct.
Coptic churches, & e.--we mention elsewhere under Cairo;
but they can quite easily be reached from Helouan. Further.
the Delta Light Railway Company have erected a stand for
the ceremony of the Holy Carpet at the Citadel, and the
principal hotels sell tickets for train fares and admission
thereto.
