EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

path emerges into the plain is the Rest House, established
by Messrs. Cook and Sons. The usual planisfor the hotel to
send lunch here; it can be taken in comfort, and afterwards
one can rest for an hour or so in the middle of the day.

This is a favourite pitch for casual antiquity sellers, professional beggars, and bakshish hunters It is best to have
nothing to do with them, otherwise life for the rest of the
day will be a burden.



TEMPLE OF QUEEN HATASU AT DEIR-EL-BAHARI

A short distance from the Rest House is the temple of
Queen Hatasu (eighteenth dynasty, B.C. 1500), rising by
broad terraces up the desert slope. The upper court is
surrounded on two sides by nearly perpendicular cliffs.
The sanctuary and other chambers are cut out of the rock.

It will be noticed at once that the plan of this temple is a
complete departure from the usual design adopted by sovereigns of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties. In the
last year or two much light has been thrown on this point
by excavations carried out just south of the temple. The
ruins of a temple of Menthuhetep (eleventh dynasty, B.C.
' 2500), having many points of resemblance to Queen Hatasu's,
have been unearthed just alongside the latter.

It seems probable that Queen Hatasu, seeing the older
edifice, copied it in some particulars.

The representations of her, though much mutilated by
her brother and husband, Thothmes III., who reigned alternately with her, are interesting; as a ruler of Egypt, she is
given male attributes, such as a beard and male clothing.
Within the upper colonnade is a relief representing her
expedition to Punt.

A short distance to the south is the village of Sheikh Abdel-Kurna, in and around which are a large number of tombs.
These belong to grandees and high court officials of the
eighteenth dynasty. A few of them are worth a visit, more
particularly Nos. 48, 125, and 18.
