EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT



ZEITOUN, MATARIEH AND MARG

Some twenty years ago, beyond Abbassieh. there was
nothing but desert, a few tiny hamlets on the cultivated
land, the palm-groves of Marg, and then more desert as far
as Khanka and Abou Zaabal quarries. Away to the right
hand is the bank of the former railway to Suez, and beyond
that the watch-towers along the old Suez road.

All this has been changed since the railway line was laid
from Pont Limoun (close to Cairo main-line station) to Mars.
The villages have become European suburbs, with quantities
of flats and villas. Every one is building right and left, and
a large proportion of the European colony live there. At
Palais de Koubbeh is H.H. the Khedive's palace and his
beautiful gardens. At Zeitoun, further on, is a good hotel
(The Grand Hotel, see page 159). Zeitoun has also a small
but flourishing tennis club with two asphalt courts.

Matarieh has its own special interest apart from the other
villages in that it occupies the site of ancient Heliopolis, or
On, as it was called, the city of the sun god. The priesthood
was most powerful here, and at times rivalled even that
of Thebes. The city seems to have been in existence in
the fourth dynasty, but its great period was the reign of
Usertsen L, B.C. 2433, who rebuilt the temple and dedicated
it to Hocus-RE-tle., the rising sun, and Teum, the setting sun,
incarnate in the Muevis Bull. He set up two obelisks before
the temple, of which one was thrown down in the thirteenth
century. The other still stands-the only visible remnant
of that great city. It has on it an inserpition. Dr. Wallis
Budge's translation reads as follows,

"The Horus, the one born of life, King of the South and
North, Kheper-Ka-Rti. Lord of the shrine Nekhebet. Lord
of the shrine Uatchet. the one form of life, the Son of the
Sun. Usertsen of the Spirits of Annu, beloved living for ever,
the Golden Horus, the one born of life, the beautiful God,
Kheper-Ka-Ra. in the first day of the Set festival truly he
made this obelisk. the giver of life for ever."

Joseph, it is said. married the daughter of Potiphar, a
priest of the city. In the Ptolemaic period it declined, and
its wise men moved to Alexandria. In B.C. 24 it was practically in ruins.

At Matarieh is also the Virgin's Tree, a huge sycamore
