<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
Amen, the "Throne of the World," as it was <span style="color: #0000FF;">called-by </span>far<br/>
the most magnificent of any of the remains of Egypt's former<br/>
grandeur.<br/>
<br/>
No one builder is responsible for the temple, but almost<br/>
every king of any note from the twelfth dynasty to the<br/>
Ptolemies had a hand in its construction.<br/>
<br/>
In front, forming the entrance to the temple, is the great<br/>
pylon, a gigantic structure nearly 150 ft. high and 350<br/>
broad. A magnificent view of all the ruins can be <span style="color: #ff0000;">seen<br/>
</span>from the top, which is easily reached from the left-hand<br/>
side. In front stretches the great court of the temple<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>covering an area of over two acres, and once surrounded by<br/>
columns. In the centre stood a colonnade<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>now in ruins,<br/>
but one single perfect column remains, with graceful calyx<br/>
capital, 70 ft. in height. Beyond the court one gets a glimpse,<br/>
through the ruined second pylon, of the huge columns of the<br/>
hypostyle hall. The more distant ruins appear confused;<br/>
above them towers, a hundred feet into the air, the redgranite obelisk of Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasu</span>.<br/>
<br/>
There appears to have been a temple at Karnak dating<br/>
from the Middle Empire, but it remained comparatively <span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant </span>until the eighteenth dynasty. Thothmes I. built<br/>
two <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylons-the </span>fourth and fifth, counting from the west.<br/>
Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasu </span>erected two obelisks, one of which has been<br/>
mentioned; the other lies on the ground, broken. Her<br/>
brother, Thothmes III.. built a separate temple to the east,<br/>
and surrounded the whole with a wall. The third pylon is<br/>
attributed to Amenhotep III.<br/>
<br/>
During the nineteenth dynasty Rameses I. built the<br/>
second pylon, and between this and the third his successors<br/>
Seti I. and Rameses III. built the great hypostyle hall.<br/>
<br/>
Seti II. and Rameses III. built separate temples to the<br/>
west of the main building. Nothing more was achieved<br/>
until the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bubastide </span>kings of the twenty-second dynasty built<br/>
the great court which joined the temples of Seti II. and<br/>
Rameses III. to the earlier edifice. Finally the great pylon<br/>
was added by the Ptolemies. Thus the whole temple must<br/>
have been over fifteen hundred years in the building. All<br/>
the kings who had a hand in it left a record of their conquests and other deeds on its walls. Many of these are well<br/>
preserved and exceedingly interesting.<br/>
<br/>
On the outside of the south wall of the hall of columns is<br/>
a very interesting relief recording the victories of Shishak,<br/>
<br/>
