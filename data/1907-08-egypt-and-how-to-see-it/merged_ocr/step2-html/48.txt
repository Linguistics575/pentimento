<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ZEITOUN, <span style="color: #ff0000;">MATARIEH </span>AND MARG<br/>
<br/>
Some twenty years ago, beyond Abbassieh<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>there was<br/>
nothing but desert, a few tiny hamlets on the cultivated<br/>
land, the palm-groves of Marg, and then more desert as far<br/>
as Khanka and Abou Zaabal quarries. Away to the right<br/>
hand is the bank of the former railway to Suez, and beyond<br/>
that the watch-towers along the old Suez road.<br/>
<br/>
All this has been changed since the railway line was laid<br/>
from Pont <span style="color: #ff0000;">Limoun </span>(close to Cairo main-line station) to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mars</span>.<br/>
The villages have become European suburbs, with quantities<br/>
of flats and villas. Every one is building right and left, and<br/>
a large proportion of the European colony live there. At<br/>
Palais de Koubbeh is H.H. the Khedive's palace and his<br/>
beautiful gardens. At Zeitoun, further on, is a good hotel<br/>
(The Grand Hotel, see page 159). Zeitoun has also a small<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>flourishing tennis club with two asphalt courts.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh </span>has its own special interest apart from the other<br/>
villages in that it occupies the site of ancient Heliopolis, or<br/>
On, as it was called, the city of the sun god. The priesthood<br/>
was most powerful here, and at times rivalled even that<br/>
of Thebes. The city seems to have been in existence in<br/>
the fourth dynasty<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>but its great period was the reign of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, B.C. 2433, who rebuilt the temple and dedicated<br/>
it to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hocus-RE-tle.</span>, the rising sun, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Teum</span>, the setting sun,<br/>
incarnate in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Muevis </span>Bull. He set up two obelisks before<br/>
the temple, of which one was thrown down in the thirteenth<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">century</span>. The other still <span style="color: #0000FF;">stands-the </span>only visible remnant<br/>
of that great <span style="color: #0000FF;">city</span>. It has on it an <span style="color: #ff0000;">inscrpition</span>. Dr. Wallis<br/>
Budge's translation reads as follows<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>"The Horus, the one born of life, King of the South and<br/>
North, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kheper-Ka-Ra</span>. Lord of the shrine Nekhebet. Lord<br/>
of the shrine Uatchet<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the one form of life, the Son of the<br/>
Sun. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span>of the Spirits of Annu, beloved living for ever,<br/>
the Golden Horus, the one born of life, the beautiful God,<br/>
Kheper-Ka-Ra. in the first day of the Set festival truly he<br/>
made this obelisk. the giver of life for ever."<br/>
<br/>
Joseph, it is said<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>married the daughter of Potiphar, a<br/>
priest of the city. In the Ptolemaic period it declined, and<br/>
its wise men moved to Alexandria. In B.C. 24 it was practically in ruins.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mat-arieh </span>is also the Virgin's Tree, a huge sycamore<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">48<br/>
