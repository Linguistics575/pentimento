<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
canals flow under endless avenues of scented mimosa, and<br/>
here and there below the broad branches of the lebbek-tree<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkieh </span>(the primitive water-wheel so characteristic of<br/>
Egypt), turned by a slow, plodding "<span style="color: #ff0000;">gamoose</span>," drones out<br/>
its monotonous note.<br/>
<br/>
The villages, their mosque domes and slender white minarets<br/>
rising from a mass of rich verdure, even the waste and<br/>
desolate parts, undrained of the salt that has impregnated<br/>
the land in years of careless <span style="color: #0000FF;">watering-in </span>all this there is a<br/>
certain atmosphere, a quiet clearness, especially in the<br/>
early morning, and even a variety which Upper Egypt does<br/>
not afford.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the towns and <span style="color: #0000FF;">villages-near </span>Mansourah <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially-stand </span>high above the surrounding country. Probably the mounds on which they are built were themselves<br/>
small towns, Roman, Greek, and Egyptian, the one above<br/>
the other. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mehallet-Kebir</span>. a most attractive town, and<br/>
at Samanoud, near it, quite a number of such things as<br/>
coins, lamps, small figures, scarabs, & c., are found from<br/>
time to time.<br/>
<br/>
We cannot suppose that the traveller is likely to devote<br/>
much time to the Delta, but we can at least show him in<br/>
the pages following this what are its features and interests,<br/>
and give him a general <span style="color: #0000FF;">impression </span>of them. If he wishes to<br/>
know Egypt as it really is, he should not forget that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lower<br/>
</span>Egypt presents it in its most characteristic, and perhaps<br/>
most charming, aspect. Upper Egypt may be the land of<br/>
the mighty dead; Lower Egypt is the land of their humbler<br/>
successors.<br/>
<br/>
A visit can be made to most places in the Delta in a day<br/>
from Cairo or from Alexandria. Besides the State railways,<br/>
which serve all the larger places, a network of light railways<br/>
(worked by the Delta Light Railway Company and the<br/>
Basse- Egypte Company) traverse the fields and connect<br/>
village to village. If one has a day to spare, a trip by the<br/>
light railway 1s certainly well worth doing.<br/>
<br/>
BILBEIS<br/>
<br/>
Bilbeis is rather out of the beaten track, and, as it now<br/>
stands, offers no particularly absorbing sight. It has a<br/>
slight historical interest as having resisted <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ammrath</span>, King<br/>
of Jerusalem, with great vigour in 1126 A.D. It contained<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">120<br/>
