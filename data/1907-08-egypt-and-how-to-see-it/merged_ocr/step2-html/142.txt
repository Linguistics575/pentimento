<span style="color: #0000FF;">efforts </span>may not discover in so rich a field<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sarbut-el-Khadem </span>is the centre of that long-dead industry.<br/>
close to Wady-Nasb, where the mines were situated. and<br/>
here are ruins of columns, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">stehe </span>with inscriptions. There<br/>
was also a small temple dedicated to Hathor, Lady of Mafkat<br/>
(or the Turquoise Land), and on its walls were records and<br/>
reliefs.<br/>

The traveller who wishes to study the Sinaitic Peninsula<br/>
fully will find valuable information in various works. We<br/>
may quote the Palestine Exploration Fund survey as one<br/>
of the best<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>also Professor Hull's "Mount <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seit</span>, Sinai "<br/>
(London, 1885), Dean Stanley's "Sinai and Palestine "and<br/>
"Ancient History from the Monuments of Sinai," and last,<br/>
but by no means least in value and interest. Professor Wallis<br/>
Budge's edition of "Cook's Guide-Book "( 1904).<br/>
<br/>
THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">OASES<br/>
<br/>
</span>The oases are small patches of fertile land surrounded by<br/>
desert. Some of them are of considerable extent and have<br/>
a resident population; others consist of a few palm-trees<br/>
only, clustered round a single spring. A chain of these<br/>
oases runs parallel to the valley of the Nile, and from a hundred to two hundred miles from it. It is supposed that they<br/>
indicate the former course of the river.<br/>
<br/>
In ancient history many of the oases were of considerable<br/>
importance. Herodotus mentions them as the "Islands of<br/>
the Blest," and the ancient Egyptian name, "Nabet," signified<br/>
a place of mummies, in that the legend claimed that the<br/>
jackal-headed Anubis conducted the spirits of the dead<br/>
from their tombs in the valley across the mountains and<br/>
desert to their paradise.<br/>
<br/>
The principal oases, from north to south<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>are: (l) Siwa, or<br/>
Jupiter Ammon, which is about twenty <span style="color: #0000FF;">davis</span>' journey west<br/>
of Cairo; (2) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahrieh</span>, opposite Minieh; (3) Farafra, opposite Assiut; (4) <span style="color: #0000FF;">anhel </span>and (5) Kharga. due west of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>.<br/>
but approached from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Farshout</span>; (6) Kurkur, north-west of<br/>
Kom Ombo; and (7) Selima, south-west of Wadi-Halfa.<br/>
<br/>
It is hardly the province of this book to describe these<br/>
expeditions and their objects at length. They entail special<br/>
journeys of several days <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>camel. They are, of course<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>highly interesting, but hardly feasible for the majority of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Visitors</span>.<br/>
