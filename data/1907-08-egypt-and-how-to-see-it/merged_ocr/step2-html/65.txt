THE LABYRINTH AND <span style="color: #ff0000;">LAHOUN<br/>
<br/>
</span>The "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Labyrinth</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>and the Pyramid of Hawara are the<br/>
next objects of attraction, some six or seven miles away.<br/>
One should procure good donkeys, take a <span style="color: #0000FF;">luncheon- </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">teabasket-this </span>the hotel can <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrange-and </span>start early. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Labyrinth "is dilapidated enough now, but it must have<br/>
been a mighty monument in its time, if we may believe<br/>
Herodotus (and it is singular how often we can), and it must<br/>
have eclipsed all other Egyptian buildings in size and <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificence</span>. It seems to have been intended as a vast place of<br/>
assembly for the parliament of ancient Egypt, and, according<br/>
to Herodotus, it had twelve courts and three thousand<br/>
chambers, besides many halls, passages, and porticoes.<br/>
Huge single slabs formed the roofs of the chambers; it had<br/>
great red granite or white <span style="color: #0000FF;">limestone-as </span>white as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pariah<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">marble-monolith</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and many wonderful sculptures describing<br/>
the history, religion, and interests of the province to which<br/>
each court was assigned.<br/>
<br/>
The Pyramid of Hawara is half a mile away to the east;<br/>
it is the tomb of Amenemhet <span style="color: #0000FF;">In.</span>, and is attributed to that<br/>
king and his daughter Ptah-Nefert Many strange and<br/>
splendid relics were discovered therein, especially in the<br/>
vault of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Horuta </span>a great noble of the twenty-sixth dynasty.<br/>
These are now in the Cairo Museum.<br/>
<br/>
Another great monument is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lahoun </span>Brick Pyramid,<br/>
an hour and a half distant and close to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lahoun </span>village, with<br/>
its temple half a mile away; this was built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertsen </span>II.,<br/>
also of the twelfth dynasty. And more interesting still are<br/>
the traces of an ancient town of the same period, designed<br/>
and built especially for the men at work on the pyramid and<br/>
temple, with rows of huts and storehouses. Last of all are<br/>
the remains of the old dykes and sluices that regulated the<br/>
exit and entry of the waters of Lake Moeris. One returns by<br/>
the 4.10 <span style="color: #0000FF;">POI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>train from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lahoun</span>, to reach <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet-el-Fayoum<br/>
