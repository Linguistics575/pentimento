the tomb of the Khedive Ismail. It was built during his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">reign</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Mohammed Aly Mosque is actually inside the precincts<br/>
of the Citadel. Its domed cupola and two slender, graceful<br/>
minarets are more conspicuous than anything else in Cairo.<br/>
From any and every point of view the mosque stands out,<br/>
boldly Oriental, against the dull, dead grey-brown of the<br/>
hills behind it, dominating Cairo. The mosque was built<br/>
by Mohammed Aly, the founder of the present Khedivial<br/>
dynasty; the architect was a Greek from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Constantinople</span>.<br/>
In the court is a fountain, and in the tower to the west is a<br/>
clock presented to Mohammed Aly by Louis Philippe of<br/>
France. The interior of the mosque is not very imposing,<br/>
and the large number of hanging lamps has a rather tawdry<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>. The columns and walls are of alabaster up to a<br/>
certain height. To the right is the tomb of Mohammed Aly,<br/>
enclosed by a railing.<br/>
<br/>
To the east of the Mohammed Aly Mosque is the so-called<br/>
"Joseph's Well." It is 290 ft. deep, and on it, in former<br/>
days, the Citadel depended for its water-supply. Round the<br/>
well-shaft winds a passage, cut through the rock; half-way<br/>
down is a platform where was formerly the water-wheel, or<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkieh</span>, driven by oxen, which raised the water to the surface.<br/>
<br/>
It is said that when the Citadel was built in the twelfth<br/>
century <span style="color: #0000FF;">Saladin </span>Yusuf discovered the well full of sand and<br/>
caused it to be cleared. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">celled </span>after him, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>after<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Joseph </span>of Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
The Ibn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Touloun </span>Mosque, built in 879 A.D., is the oldest<br/>
in Cairo. The walls are of brick, coated with stucco.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Knit </span>Bey Mosque (fifteenth century), near the Ibn<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Touloun</span>, is small, but has a most graceful minaret. On the<br/>
pulpit is some fine carving, and the mosaics on the walls<br/>
and floor are worth notice.<br/>
<br/>
These mosques will probably take up all the morning.<br/>

<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mosques-all-Azhar </span>Mosque is in the Sharia<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Halwagi</span>, a turning off the Sharia <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky</span>. It dates from<br/>
972 A.D., in which year Gawhar completed it. In 988 A.D.<br/>
it was converted into a university, the largest to-day in the<br/>
Mohammedan world. It has students (about eight thousand<br/>
in all) from every country, and over two hundred professors.<br/>
The subjects are, first and foremost, the Koran and its commentaries, and then the "profane "subjects studied in the<br/>
