coal-hoists, and little sailing-boats cruising up and down the<br/>
harbour.<br/>
<br/>
Certain steamship lines have made arrangements with the<br/>
Railway Administration whereby in winter special trains<br/>
meet their boats on the quay, and carry passengers direct to<br/>
Cairo. Passengers by other lines have to fend for themselves. Information on this point can best be obtained from<br/>
the steamship companies themselves. The Custom House<br/>
is on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">quays</span>, and there are always plenty of cabs. The<br/>
drive to the station takes about half an hour, first through<br/>
narrow native streets, then into the wide Place Mohammed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aly<br/>
</span>and up Rue Cherif <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pacha</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fine modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">street-thence </span>past<br/>

fare is 5 pt. For those who wish to pass a few hours, or even<br/>
a night, in Alexandria there are the Khedivial, Windsor, and<br/>
Savoy Hotels. all three of which are good. One can go to<br/>
see Pompey's Pillar, or else drive out to Ramleh in the afternoon. A fuller description of Alexandria is given in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chapter<br/>

</span>The journey to Cairo, 130 miles, by express, takes from<br/>
three to three and a half hours, according to the class of train.<br/>

The journey from Alexandria to Cairo does not possess<br/>
anv great features of interest; the country, once one has<br/>
left the rather desolate Lake Mariout, is characteristic of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Delta-canals</span>, crops, and camels.

are the only four places worth mentioning on the route.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah</span>, where all the trains stop, has one merit on a warm<br/>
