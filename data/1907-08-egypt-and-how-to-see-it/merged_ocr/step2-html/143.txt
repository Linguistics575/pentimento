</span>The Oasis of Siwa, or Jupiter Ammon, is about six miles<br/>
in length and four or five broad. Herodotus tells us that<br/>
Cambysis sent a force of <span style="color: #0000FF;">50000 </span>men to enslave its inhabitants and burn their temple, but a great sandstorm<br/>
engulfed and destroyed them. Alexander the Great visited<br/>
this oasis, and was, the legend says, well received by Ammon,<br/>
the god thereof. It is certain that it was occupied and fortified, probably as far back as the nineteenth dynasty, and<br/>
many memorials and reliefs are found there to support this.<br/>
The present <span style="color: #0000FF;">population </span>is about 7000. The two principal<br/>
towns are Siwa and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Akermi</span>, which are usually at feud with<br/>
one another.<br/>
<br/>
It is perhaps as well for those wishing to visit this oasis<br/>
to apply to the authorities in Cairo, though nowadays there<br/>
is little likelihood of any difficulty arising to prevent expeditions.<br/>
<br/>
The Oasis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahrieh</span>, or Northern Oasis, is four or five<br/>
days' easy journey from the Fayoum. The population in<br/>
1897 was 6000.<br/>
<br/>
The Farafra Oasis is midway between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahrieh </span>and<br/>
Dakhel; its population is about 540. It is of very small<br/>
area, and can never have been very flourishing. There are a<br/>
certain number of rock tombs to the north, possibly Roman.<br/>
It can be reached from Minieh in eight days on a good camel.<br/>
<br/>
The Oasis of Dakhel is seven days from Assiut, or four<br/>
days from the Farafra Oasis. It has over 17,000 inhabitants.<br/>
3000 of these living in its chief village, El-Kasr (the fort).<br/>
There are the ruins of a temple of the Roman period<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>dedicated to Ameri-Ra or Horus of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Behutet </span>by Titus and<br/>
other emperors (nowadays called Deir-el-Hargar, or the<br/>
Convent of Stone). The Romans kept a small garrison here,<br/>
and probably it was frequented by recluses in the third.<br/>
fourth, and fifth centuries A.D. Its date trade is fairly considerable.<br/>
<br/>
The Oasis of Kharga--the Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oasis-is </span>about four<br/>
days' camel-ride from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Farsliout</span>. Recently the Western<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Onset</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Company have started boring operations for artesian<br/>
wells, with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>to putting a larger area under cultivation.<br/>
A narrow-gauge railway is also being constructed from the<br/>
Nile valley (Kharga Junction on the State railways) to<br/>
Kharga, the capital of the oasis, a distance of about 100<br/>
miles. It is hoped that communication will be complete<br/>
by the winter of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1907-8</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The oasis has a population of about 7000, and there <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
<br/>
