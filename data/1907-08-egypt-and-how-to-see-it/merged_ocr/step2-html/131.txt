THE MUSEUM<br/>
<br/>
The Museum is situated in a turning off the Rue Rosette.<br/>
It is under the care of Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Betti</span>, and contains many <span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquities</span>, principally of the Graeco-Roman period.<br/>
<br/>
MARIOUT RAILWAY<br/>
<br/>
To the west of Alexandria is the terminus of H.H. the<br/>
Khedive's railway. The line runs south-westwards parallel<br/>
to the coast for a distance of about 110 miles.<br/>
<br/>
There are many Bedouin settlements on the way, and the<br/>
country, which a few years ago was waste land and desert,<br/>
is becoming <span style="color: #0000FF;">populated</span>, and now thrives under the influence<br/>
of the railway.<br/>
<br/>
RUINS OF ST. MENAS<br/>
<br/>
The ruins of the city of St. Menas, the patron saint of Christian Egypt, were, strange to say, only discovered two years<br/>
ago by the researches of German <span style="color: #0000FF;">archaeologists </span>The city is<br/>
a few hours' ride to the north of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Behig</span>, a station on H.H. the<br/>
Khedive's railway. We owe the information given here to<br/>
the courtesy of Rowland Snelling, Esq., of Alexandria, who<br/>
wrote two admirable articles on the discoveries at Mariout<br/>
in the Egyptian Gazette for April 17 and 20, 1907.<br/>
<br/>
"Mariout was a species of Egyptian Lourdes, a city of<br/>
pilgrimage. The pilgrims used to bear away terra-cotta<br/>
ampullae or flasks of the holy water of St. Menas. Some of<br/>
these flasks are to be found in every museum in Europe.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">St</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Menus </span>was martyred in Phrygia in 296 A.D. His body<br/>
was brought to Alexandria and placed on a camel, and the<br/>
beast allowed to wander as he chose. He stopped near Lake<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mareotis </span>A tomb was built there which possessed <span style="color: #0000FF;">miraculous </span>powers. Followed a church and then a town. A great<br/>
basilica was erected in'the reign of Arcadius (395-408 A.D.).<br/>
<br/>
"The earliest extant account of it is from an unknown<br/>
Arab traveller, who visited it probably in the tenth century.<br/>
The description is contained in a manuscript in the Paris<br/>
Library, and is as follows:' Leaving <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tarraneh </span>and following the road towards Barca, one comes to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menu</span>, which consists of three abandoned towns in the midst of a sandy desert,<br/>
