terrace, on which a band usually plays in the afternoon during<br/>
tea. There is a pretty garden at the back, with shady trees<br/>
and flowers, and also a tennis-court. The interior is <span style="color: #0000FF;">decorated </span>in Arab and Egyptian style; the restaurant and lounge<br/>
in particular are remarkable.<br/>
<br/>
The Continental is a large new hotel facing the Opera<br/>
Square and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekieh </span>Gardens, and offers many attractions to its patrons. The terrace has a most animated<br/>
appearance. This hotel has the most central position of<br/>
any, and is conveniently near the best <span style="color: #0000FF;">shops </span>and the bazaars;<br/>
in fact, it is a good starting-point for all the sights of<br/>
Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
A smaller and quieter hotel, the Angleterre. in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shariael-Magraby-is </span>greatly appreciated by those who desire a<br/>
quieter life than is possible in the larger establishments;<br/>
it is, however, first class, and quite as well managed as any<br/>
of the big hotels.<br/>
<br/>
The new Hotel Semiramis, only opened last season, is one<br/>
of the best situated in the town, being alongside the Nile,<br/>
close to the Kasr-el-Nil bridge, and in the fashionable <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasrel-Doubara </span>quarter. From its terrace visitors may enjoy<br/>
one of the most extensive and picturesque views of Cairo.<br/>
The interior arrangements of the hotel are, needless to say,<br/>
quite up to date and most comfortable from every point of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">view</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>Palace Hotel is on the island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh<br/>
</span>--a fashionable suburb. The building was once a palace of<br/>
the Khedive Ismail, and the decorations are in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'most<br/>
</span>gorgeous and lavish style. As a hotel it ranks with the best;<br/>
it is about two miles out of Cairo, and the dust and noise of<br/>
the town are avoided. The distance is no drawback, as<br/>
there is an electric omnibus as well as plenty of carriages<br/>
ready to convey visitors all over Cairo; there is also a steam<br/>
ferry across the Nile. The gardens in which the hotel stands<br/>
are as beautiful as any in or near Cairo; on the east side is<br/>
the broad smooth stream of the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
These gardens are gay all the winter through with flowers,<br/>
and have many shady walks <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>one may escape for a<br/>
time from the bustle of the town. During the season a band<br/>
plays every afternoon on the terrace. In the grounds is the<br/>
Casino, where the fancy-dress dances and many other festivities are held. A small dance is also held every Thursday<br/>
in the hotel. Close by are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">grounds </span>of the Sporting Club.<br/>
