<br/>
The sea-shore at Aboukir is of sand, smooth and fine, and<br/>
it makes a good place for a picnic.<br/>

ROSETTA<br/>
<br/>
A visit to Rosetta makes a whole day's expedition from<br/>
Alexandria.<br/>
The trains are as follows:<br/>

The journey itself is interesting. At first are the gardens<br/>
of Ramleh, then the summer palace of H.H. the Khedive at<br/>
Montaza is passed. Then the line threads the narrow strip<br/>
of land between the sea on the left and Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edkou </span>on the<br/>
right. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maadieh </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edkou </span>are resorts of fishers, and their<br/>
bright-coloured, <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat-bottomed </span>boats with high curling prows<br/>
are seen on the edge of the lake. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">winter </span>vast flocks of<br/>
water-fowl can be seen on the water. Between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boussili<br/>
</span>and Rosetta is mostly desert, relieved at intervals by tiny<br/>
villages amid their palms and fruit trees.<br/>
<br/>
Rosetta is a town of considerable size, but its <span style="color: #0000FF;">population<br/>
</span>has dwindled, so that most of the houses appear to be empty.<br/>
It stands on the western branch of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, near its mouth.<br/>
For this reason it used to be a port of considerable importance.<br/>
until, when the Mahmoudieh Canal was cut, the trade of the<br/>
Delta was diverted to Alexandria. There is still a considerable industry in rice.<br/>
<br/>
The streets are lined with curious, old-world houses,<br/>
standing aloof, as if Rosetta had long retired from the active<br/>
race for prosperity.<br/>
<br/>
The town is memorable for one great discovery, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Rosetta Stone," now in the British Museum. On this stone is<br/>
engraved a decree which is written in three forms--<span style="color: #ff0000;">ancientEgyptian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hieroglyphics</span>, Demotic characters, and Greek. It<br/>
was discovered in 1799, and formed the first key with which<br/>
the inscriptions of ancient Egypt were deciphered.<br/>
<br/>
Sonnini, who visited Egypt in 1777, is enthusiastic over<br/>
the "rich. fertile<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and beautiful country, the gardens, the<br/>
