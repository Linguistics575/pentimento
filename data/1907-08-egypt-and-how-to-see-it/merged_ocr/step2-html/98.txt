LUXOR <span style="color: #0000FF;">TO </span>ASSOUAN<br/>
<br/>
At Luxor the line changes to narrow gauge, but the same<br/>
tradition of comfort is, as far as possible, maintained in the<br/>
trains; the windows are fitted with smoked glass to counteract the glare, and a luncheon-car is attached to the train.<br/>
<br/>
The journey takes six and a half hours.<br/>
<br/>
At Luxor station there is not only a buffet, but even baths<br/>
for the dusty.<br/>
<br/>
The best trains leave Luxor at 10.30 A.M. and Assouan at<br/>
10.15 A.M. in connection with the trains de <span style="color: #0000FF;">luxe </span>and night<br/>
mail from and to Cairo.<br/>

Armant, the first station after Luxor, is unenviably<br/>
notorious for a breed of dogs whose ferocity renders them<br/>
useful for watching but rather embarrassing as pets.<br/>
<br/>
Near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maalla </span>are the dazzling white limestone quarries<br/>
from which comes the stone for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>barrage.<br/>
