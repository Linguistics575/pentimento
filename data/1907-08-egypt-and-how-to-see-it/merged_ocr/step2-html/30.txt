<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
Italian opera, grand, and light and French <span style="color: #0000FF;">opera </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">boufe </span>have<br/>
met with success worthy of the management. It can <span style="color: #0000FF;">hold<br/>
</span>nearly twelve hundred people, and is not uncomfortable. It<br/>
is, however, more or less of a temporary nature. All Cairo<br/>
is hoping for a grand new theatre, plans for which are being<br/>
studied.<br/>
<br/>
There is in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezbekieh </span>Gardens a small theatre, where<br/>
light <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>plays are from time to time given (though operas<br/>
have been attempted also). Occasionally these are really<br/>
amusing and well acted, though they are naturally of the<br/>
"Capucines "<span style="color: #0000FF;">order-vaudevilles </span>and farces.<br/>
<br/>
There is an Arab theatre in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezbekieh </span>quarter, where<br/>
Arabic (and, be it said, rather weird) versions of Shakespeare<br/>
are given, and there are sundry Arab music-halls, where the<br/>
more curious can see native dancing and hear native singing.<br/>

<br/>
THE BAZAARS<br/>
<br/>
The native bazaars are a great institution. They are<br/>
situated in or near the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky</span>, which is the original<br/>
and oldest commercial street in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo-narrow</span>, crowded,<br/>
picturesque, and quite unlike any other thoroughfare in the<br/>
city. People of all nationalities and in every sort of <span style="color: #ff0000;">clothing<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">pass </span>up and down, or in and out of the big wholesale <span style="color: #0000FF;">shops</span>.<br/>
<br/>
About half a mile up the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky </span>(beyond the tram crossing)<br/>
there is a turning on the left; in this are the booths of goldsmiths, small native jewellers, and, further down, <span style="color: #0000FF;">copper<br/>
</span>vendors. About a hundred yards along this side-street is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>turning on the right called the Khan Khalil; this is the<br/>
Turkish <span style="color: #0000FF;">bazaar-the </span>best of all the bazaars. The Khan<br/>
Khalil is very narrow, and parts of it are covered in; its<br/>
devious paths lead past shops of every <span style="color: #0000FF;">kind</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">jewellers</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">carpetsellers</span>, shawl-sellers, amber merchants, brass and copper<br/>
smiths, Indian and Persian vendors of every and any kind of<br/>
curio or ornament. Of course one can hardly hope to pick<br/>
up treasures. Far too many keen dealers have exploited<br/>
Cairo at various times to leave any really precious "finds."<br/>
But one <span style="color: #0000FF;">can-often </span>at quite a reasonable <span style="color: #0000FF;">price-buy </span>charming <span style="color: #0000FF;">turquoises</span>, peridots, and other stones. There are quantities of fine carpets and praying-mats, swords, spears,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">courbags </span>(Soudanese rhinoceros-hide whips). As all the wares<br/>
are exposed to the fullest possible view, it is worth passing<br/>
through the bazaars, if only to see so motley an exhibition.<br/>
