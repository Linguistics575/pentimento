<span>EGYPT. AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
about 4500 acres <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>land under cultivation at present. The<br/>
principal trade is in dates; there are some <span style="color: #ff0000;">70,000 </span>date-palms<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
</span>and the fruit is better than that grown anywhere in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The principal ancient Egyptian remains are the temple<br/>
of Hibis (<span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0</span>. 521), in which is inscribed an interesting hymn<br/>
to the sun-god. At Nadara, near the modern capital, are<br/>
three temples. one of the time of Ptolemy III. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">3.0</span>. 240)<br/>
and the other two of the time of Antoninus Pius (150 <span style="color: #0000FF;">A.D.</span>).<br/>
There are the remains<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>also, of Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">watch-towers </span>and<br/>
forts. a circular brick-kiln and tombs, probably of the third<br/>
and fourth centuries of the Christian era. Near Ein Tabashir<br/>
are some curious buildings with tiny cubical recesses (eight<br/>
inches across), which mav have been dovecots.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oases </span>of Kurkur and Selima are quite small<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and<br/>
of no great interest. belima, <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>true, was an important<br/>
station on the caravan route for the slave and other trades<br/>
from East and Central Africa through all the oases to Morocco.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Wady Natroun, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nation </span>Valley<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>is hardly an oasis,<br/>
as there <span style="color: #0000FF;">IS </span>little or no cultivation. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">valley-about<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">twentv </span>miles <span style="color: #0000FF;">long-has </span>several small salt <span style="color: #0000FF;">lake</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and is remarkable for its alkaline deposits, which furnish salt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>sulphate<br/>
and carbonate of soda, and similar products. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">WadyNatroun </span>has considerable antiquarian interest, and is comparatively easy of access, being but a few hours from Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
There used to be a town in the middle of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">valley-a<br/>
</span>large settlement of Christian monks. St. Macarius, the<br/>
Egyptian, was the pioneer of these recluses, to the number<br/>
of some 5000, as well as 600 desert anchorites. He is<br/>
supposed to be buried in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monastery </span>which bears his<br/>
name. Ten miles to the west of it is the Monastery of Anaba<br/>
Bishai, and further on the Syrian Monastery (Deir Suriani),<br/>
built by John the Dwarf in the time of Constantine. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">possessed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fine library, and even now contains three churches<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>the chief of which is dedicated to the Virgin. There is also<br/>
the Monastery of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baramus</span>, six or eight miles further west.<br/>
<br/>
The Natron Valley and its monasteries have been visited<br/>
by many travellers ever since Egidus <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lochiensis </span>in 1633.<br/>
and great stores of manuscripts have been recovered therefrom. They must have been veritable treasuries, especially<br/>
Deir Suriani. Intending visitors should consult "Visits to<br/>
Monasteries in the Levant," by the Hon. R. Curzon, who<br/>
visited the valley in 1837 (fifth edition, 1865).<br/>
