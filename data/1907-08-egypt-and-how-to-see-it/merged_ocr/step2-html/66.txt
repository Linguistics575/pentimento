<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>

3.40 P.M., and passes through the most fertile and beautiful<br/>
part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>province. One can return by the State<br/>
Railway train, or by a donkey.<br/>

LAKE KAROUN<br/>
<br/>
We have already mentioned Lake Karoun; but it requires<br/>
a special visit, even <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>short stay of a day or two. In the<br/>
winter there is a hotel <span style="color: #0000FF;">open</span>, under management delegated<br/>
from the Karoun Hotel at Medina; one should announce<br/>
one's arrival, by telegraph, the day before.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">station-Abel-y-is </span>under an hour distant from<br/>
Medina; a train leaves the latter at 11.41 A.M. and arrives at<br/>
12.35 RM. There are vehicles of sorts in waiting. The drive<br/>
takes about an hour through a country-side pretty enough<br/>
in itself, and past picturesque villages, but all is dwarfed by<br/>
the panorama that reveals a stretch of fertile land, a gradual<br/>
slope, and then the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lake-a </span>turquoise streak, silvery, shimmering, under a pale luminous sky; beyond, the hills frame it,<br/>
pale rose and following one another, ramparts between desert<br/>
and water. The pale green, blue, rose, blend in a perfection<br/>
of vivid and intense colour.<br/>
<br/>
The hotel is quaintly suited to its surroundings. There is<br/>
a row of roomy, square tents ranged on a stone platform<br/>
beside a stream that flows into the lake. The wind whispers<br/>
and rustles in the reeds that fringe the water. One would<br/>
expect that a tent on a stone flooring, close to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Waterside</span>.<br/>
would prove a cold sleeping-place; but it is quite comfortable, and indeed all the arrangements are good. The food<br/>
is not that of the great hotels, but it is by no means to be<br/>
despised. There are plenty of boats of various kinds, rowing<br/>
and sailing, that belong to the hotel.<br/>
<br/>
The lake has still a fine extent of water, some eight miles<br/>
broad by thirty-five long, and one sees flamingoes and pelicans<br/>
in the distance, and quantities of duck and other water-fowl,<br/>
not always easy of approach. On the desert shore are <span style="color: #0000FF;">jackals<br/>
</span>and hyenas, though these are seldom <span style="color: #ff0000;">seen</span>. On the far side<br/>
of the lake are the ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dima</span>, apparently a Ptolemaic<br/>
town of some importance. One may also go to the Kasr<br/>
Karoun, where are ruins of an Egyptian and of a small<br/>
Roman temple; it is some three hours' sail westward from<br/>
the hotel. But perhaps these ruins will interest few save<br/>
<br/>
