interesting; it is remarkable for the extreme freshness of<br/>
the colouring.<br/>
<br/>
THE COLOSSI <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>MEMNON<br/>
<br/>
These stand in cultivated land about a mile to the northwest of the landing-stage. The two enormous statues represent Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>in a sitting position, and are 52 ft. high.<br/>
<br/>
Although much damaged by time and the Nile flood, the<br/>
Colossi are amongst the most remarkable monuments of<br/>
ancient Egypt. Their size is all the more apparent on the<br/>
level plain. Originally they adorned the front of a temple<br/>
founded by Amenhotep, but of this little or nothing remains.<br/>
<br/>
The northernmost of the two figures excited considerable<br/>
interest and discussion in Roman times, as at sunrise the<br/>
statue is said to have emitted a musical note, of which many<br/>
explanations have been given. Strabo, Pausanias, and<br/>
J <span style="color: #ff0000;">uvenal </span>mention the fact; Strabo, however, was sceptical as<br/>
to its supernatural origin.<br/>
<br/>
DISTRIBUTION OF TIME<br/>
<br/>
The question of what to see first will depend largely on the<br/>
amount of time at the disposal of the visitor. In three days<br/>
one can devote a little time to each point of interest, while<br/>
some of the most important monuments can be seen in one<br/>
long day's expedition. In this case both guides and <span style="color: #ff0000;">donkeyboys </span>will probably want extra money. The following <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrangements </span>are suggested for those with one, two, or three days at<br/>
their disposal.<br/>
<br/>
One Day<br/>
<br/>
Start from Luxor at 8.30 A.M., and cross the river. Ride<br/>
to the temple of Seti I. at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kama</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>from there to the Tombs of<br/>
the Kings at Biban-el-Muluk. After exploring two or three<br/>
of the tombs--<span style="color: #0000FF;">say </span>those of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, and Amenhotep III. (Nos. 17, 11, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">35</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-ride </span>over the hill to the<br/>
temple of Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasu </span>at Deir-el-Bahari and return to the<br/>
landing-stage, stopping on the way to see the Ramesseum<br/>
and the Colossi of Memnon. Lunch is taken at Luxor, and<br/>
the afternoon can be devoted to the temples of Luxor and<br/>
Karnak.<br/>
