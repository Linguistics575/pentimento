visited. It is at the upper end of the cataract, at Shellal.<br/>
about six miles by rail south of Assouan. This work, <span style="color: #0000FF;">completed </span>in 1902, was four years in the building, and has <span style="color: #0000FF;">had<br/>
</span>a tremendous effect on the prosperity of Egypt. The river<br/>

above the dam slopes upwards, but very gently, so that <span style="color: #ff0000;">an </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i<br/>
</span>immense reservoir is formed, stretching south for 120 miles. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
</span>In winter, when the river is high, some of the water is held<br/>
back and the reservoir gradually filled. At low Nile, in the<br/>
spring and summer, when Egypt has hardly enough water<br/>
to save herself from absolute drought, the sluices are <span style="color: #ff0000;">opened </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1<br/>
</span>and the supply augmented, until, as the river begins to rise<br/>
for the next flood, the reservoir is empty. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
</span>The Dam is 2180 yds. long, 131 ft. high, and at present <span style="color: #ff0000;">holds<br/>
</span>up the water 65 ft. It is built of the red Assouan granite 1<br/>
used by the ancients for their most lasting memorials. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
</span>The ancient history of Assouan is graven on its rocks<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1<br/>
