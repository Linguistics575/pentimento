</span>into the face of the hill, is broken at intervals by recesses.<br/>
and ends in one or more large chambers supported by pillars<br/>
of the original rock. In a depression in the floor of the last<br/>
chamber was laid the massive granite sarcophagus containing<br/>
the mummy.<br/>
<br/>
The walls of the passage, chambers, and pillars were<br/>
covered with finely executed and highly coloured reliefs<br/>
and hieroglyphics. In most cases there are extracts from<br/>
the two <span style="color: #0000FF;">Is </span>Books of the Dead," which give directions for<br/>
the journey of the departed spirit through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">underworld</span>.<br/>
The "Boat of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sun </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>also appears frequently.<br/>
<br/>
The following extract from the "Book of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dead </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>was<br/>
found engraved on a sarcophagus. It is a profession of<br/>
faith and of a righteous life<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>"I have committed no fraud against men. I have not<br/>
tormented the widow. I have not <span style="color: #0000FF;">spoken </span>falsely in the<br/>
tribunal, nor do I know ill-faith. I have done no forbidden<br/>
thing. I have not exacted of a taskmaster more work than<br/>
he could do daily. I have not been neglectful. I have not<br/>
been idle. I have not refused my debts, nor <span style="color: #ff0000;">haveIwearied<br/>
</span>1n well-doing. I have not done that which is abominable<br/>
to the Gods. I have not slandered the slave to his master.<br/>
I have starved none. I have made none weep. I have<br/>
slain none, nor have I commanded to murder by treachery.<br/>
I have not stolen the Temple bread. I have not seized the<br/>
cakes offered to the Gods. I have not taken the food or the<br/>
fillets of the dead. I have not gained money by fraud. I<br/>
have not changed the measure of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corn</span>. I have not<br/>
defrauded the breadth of a finger on the hand. I have not<br/>
seized land. I have not changed the plates of the balance.<br/>
I have not falsified the balance. I have not taken the milk<br/>
from the mouths of the sucklings. I have not hunted the<br/>
sacred animals in their pastures. I have not taken the<br/>
divine birds in the net. I have not fished for the sacred<br/>
fish in their ponds. I have not kept the water back in its<br/>
season. I have not <span style="color: #0000FF;">cuts </span>branch of the water in its passage.<br/>
I have not quenched the sacred fire at its hour. I have not<br/>
violated the divine cycle in its chosen offerings. I have not<br/>
driven the oxen from the sacred pastures. I have not<br/>
turned aside the God in his procession. I am pure. I am<br/>
pure. I am pure. I am pure."<br/>
