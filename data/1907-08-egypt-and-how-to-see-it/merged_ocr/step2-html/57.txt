Ptah was incarnate in the Apis bulls, who were first worshipped, then drowned in the sacred lake, embalmed, and<br/>
finally buried in the magnificent granite sarcophagi of the<br/>
Apis Tombs.<br/>
<br/>
The first objects of interest after leaving the station are<br/>
the Colossi of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>: these formerly marked the<br/>
entrance to a temple. The first, made of granite, lies prostrate; its length with the crown, which has fallen off, is<br/>
over 30 ft. The second colossus is of limestone, 42 ft. high;<br/>
it stands in an enclosure (4 pt. is charged to enter, unless<br/>
one has a general pass). The foundations of the temple of<br/>
Ptah can be seen a little to the north.<br/>
<br/>
From this point it is about an hour's ride to the Step<br/>
Pyramid. This is the tomb of King Zoser (third dynasty),<br/>
older than the Gizeh Pyramids; unlike them, it is built<br/>
in six stages or steps. It is about 200 ft. high. A little to<br/>
the south-west is the Pyramid of Unas, a king of the fifth<br/>
dynasty. The walls of the tomb chamber are covered with<br/>
coloured hieroglyphics which are among the oldest that<br/>
have been found.<br/>
<br/>
After this, lunch may be taken at Mariette's House,<br/>
Mariette was the famous French Egyptologist who discovered<br/>
the Apis Tombs in 1851, and afterwards became Director of<br/>
Antiquities to the Egyptian Government (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1857-1881</span>).<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes distant are the tombs of the Apis bulls or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum</span>; there are nearly four hundred yards of vaulted<br/>
subterranean passages with niches at intervals in which are<br/>
the granite <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>of the bulls. Twenty-four of these<br/>
are still in position; they are <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>from a single block of<br/>
granite, and weigh sixty or seventy tons. The following<br/>
extract from Mariette's report on his discovery may be<br/>
interesting:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I confess that when I penetrated for the first time, on<br/>
November 12, 1851, into the Apis vaults, I was so profoundly<br/>
struck with astonishment that the feeling is still fresh in my<br/>
mind, although five years have elapsed since then. Owing<br/>
to some chance which it is difficult to account for, a chamber<br/>
which had been walled up in the thirtieth year of the reign<br/>
of Rameses II. had escaped the notice of the plunderers of<br/>
the vaults, and I was so fortunate as to find it untouched.<br/>
Although 3700 years had elapsed since it was closed<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>everything in the chamber seemed to be precisely in its original<br/>
