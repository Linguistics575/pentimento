<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">NOTICE<br/>
<br/>
</span>Those who wish to see the monuments and antiquities in<br/>
Upper Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">m'st </span>obtain before starting south an Antiquity Ticket, price 120 pt. They can be obtained from the<br/>
Cairo Museum, the Antiquity Inspector at Luxor, or from<br/>
Messrs. Cook and Sons.<br/>
<br/>
We would venture to add one word as to the treatment of<br/>
guides<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>donkey-boys, and such people in general. They have<br/>
often an engaging enough manner, and if this is unduly<br/>
encouraged they are inclined to take far too much liberty,<br/>
besides which it is most <span style="color: #ff0000;">demoralising </span>to themselves. One<br/>
may show all possible courtesy and consideration to them<br/>
without thereby exciting the familiarity which is at times<br/>
rather a deplorable feature of this class.<br/>
<br/>
BAKSHISH: IMPORTANT NOTICE<br/>
The following notice has been <span style="color: #ff0000;">issued</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>"The attention of the Egyptian authorities has been<br/>
frequently drawn, both by visitors and by residents in the<br/>
country, to the evils resulting from the indiscriminate bestowal<br/>
of bakshish to the inhabitants of <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile villages and other<br/>
places visited by tourists during the winter season. The<br/>
intention of the donors is no doubt kindly, but the practice<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-more </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>in view of the yearly increase of visitors<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt- </span>cannot fail to be detrimental to the moral sense<br/>
and the social well-being of the poorer classes of the community. At the present time many of the poorer inhabitants<br/>
of those towns on the Nile which are most visited by tourists<br/>
live almost entirely on what they can obtain by <span style="color: #0000FF;">bakshish<br/>
</span>during the winter months. The easy means thus offered<br/>
of obtaining a small livelihood prevents their adopting any<br/>
form of labour, and children are brought up to regard the<br/>
tourist season as the period during which they may, by<br/>
clamorous begging, enable their parents and themselves to<br/>
lead a life of idleness for the remainder of the year. The<br/>
unhealthy tendenc of such a system is obvious.<br/>
<br/>
"On the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span>, from the point of view of the Nile<br/>
travellers themselves, the inconveniences of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">universal<br/>
