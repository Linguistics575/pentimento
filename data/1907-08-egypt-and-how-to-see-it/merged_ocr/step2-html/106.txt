<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ASSOUAN<br/>
<br/>
On arrival the matter of first importance is hotels. There<br/>
are three large ones. It is hard indeed to choose between<br/>
the Cataract and the Savoy. Both are first-class and in<br/>
delightful positions; both supply all that the visitor can wish.<br/>
The Cataract Hotel, built high above the Nile, of which<br/>
there is a splendid view both up and down, is perhaps <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>most <span style="color: #0000FF;">popular</span>. The Savoy is on Elephantine Island, just<br/>
opposite the town, with gardens and trees. Both hotels<br/>
have tennis courts. A rather smaller hotel is the Grand,<br/>
situated in the town facing the Nile; it has recently been<br/>
rebuilt, and is very comfortable. Full particulars of the<br/>
hotels are given on page 163.<br/>
<br/>
There is an English church near the Cataract Hotel, and<br/>
a resident chaplain holds regular services in winter.<br/>
<br/>
Assouan is not a great centre; its importance lies principally in its qualities as a winter resort and its archaeological<br/>
interest. It is for all practical purposes the southern boundary of Egypt, and the borderland between races who, for<br/>
all their relations one with another, have never mingled.<br/>
<br/>
Though a brazen furnace in summer, Assouan can hardly<br/>
be surpassed as a health resort in winter. Surrounded by<br/>
desert, the air is dry, yet the usual <span style="color: #0000FF;">penalty-dust-is </span>absent.<br/>
Rain hardly ever falls. The days are warm and brilliantly<br/>
sunny, but seldom unpleasantly hot during the winter<br/>
months. The town appears <span style="color: #0000FF;">wonderfully </span>clean. There is a<br/>
refreshing novelty about the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scenery-the </span>town lays at the<br/>
foot of the first cataract, and the river is hedged in by rocks<br/>
and great rounded boulders of pleasing outline.<br/>
<br/>
Among the places of interest in and near the town, not<br/>
least are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bazaars-more </span>picturesque than most of their<br/>
kind. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Long </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>haired, shaggy <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bishareen </span>stalk <span style="color: #0000FF;">past-often<br/>
</span>with a lance in their hand; <span style="color: #0000FF;">effendis</span>, Greeks, fellaheen, in<br/>
every kind of dress pass up and down. Many of the shops<br/>
are worth notice. Sudanese wares, Dervish arms and<br/>
armour, and different objects of native manufacture make<br/>
up their varied stock-in-trade.<br/>
<br/>
On the desert above the town is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bishareen </span>camp.<br/>
These nomads of the eastern desert, camel and sheep dealers<br/>
by trade, come into Assouan in winter and pitch their <span style="color: #0000FF;">disreputable-looking </span>tents near the town. Many think them<br/>
worth a visit.<br/>
