<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
price being 10 pt. each <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the day; it is a ride of <span style="color: #0000FF;">about<br/>
</span>an hour and a half to Sakkara.<br/>
<br/>
One can visit Sakkara from Helouan; in this case the<br/>
river has to be crossed by ferry, and altogether it will take<br/>
about two hours and a half.<br/>
<br/>
The third route is across the desert, about two hours<br/>
from Mena House by <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-or </span>better, by sand-cart, a<br/>
curious but most adequate vehicle with broad tyres for<br/>
driving on loose sand. This route leads direct to Sakkara.<br/>
If Memphis and the colossal statues of Rameses are to be<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">seen </span>without making a long detour, the route via <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshein</span>.<br/>
which is really the shortest, easiest and most practical, must<br/>
be taken.<br/>
<br/>
Lunch should be brought from Cairo; here the <span style="color: #ff0000;">luncheonbasket </span>is a useful necessity. Lunch can be taken at Mariette's<br/>
House, close to the principal points of interest, where tables,<br/>
chairs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">c.</span>, are arranged in the shade. Candles or an <span style="color: #0000FF;">acetylene </span>bicycle lamp should also be brought, for exploring the<br/>
underground tombs. If a general Antiquity Pass (see page<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">171</span>) has not been purchased, tickets for Sakkara alone can be<br/>
obtained at Mariette's House, the Museum in Cairo, or of<br/>
Messrs. Cook and Son, at 5 pt. per head.<br/>
<br/>
The ruins of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshein </span>and Sakkara are the relics of that<br/>
great city Memphis, one of the most famous of all ancient<br/>
cities.<br/>
<br/>
The village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshein </span>stands on the site of the old<br/>
town, and as this was situated in the valley which is covered<br/>
each year by the inundation, little indeed remains of its<br/>
former greatness; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossi </span>of Rameses. the foundations<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a temple of Ptah, and a few scattered mounds are all that<br/>
is left. Above, on the edge of the desert, was the necropolis<br/>
of Memphis, and here there are many <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-preserved </span>monuments of the earliest times.<br/>
<br/>
Memphis. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is said, was founded by Menes, first mortal<br/>
king of Egypt. During the third, fourth, and fifth dynasties<br/>
it was the capital of all Egypt, the Royal city. Its kings<br/>
built palaces and temples of unrivalled magnificence, and<br/>
provided vast tombs to immortalise their greatness.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the history of Egypt Memphis was of the<br/>
greatest importance, though only for short periods the capital.<br/>
and even in Ptolemaic times it was a large and thriving city.<br/>
The triad, Ptah, Sekhet, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Best </span>were the principal deities;<br/>
they resemble the Theban triad Amen, Mut, and Khons.<br/>
