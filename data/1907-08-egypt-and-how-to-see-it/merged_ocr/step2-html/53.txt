<br/>
the King of Egypt, Khoufou, Giver of Life, hath found the<br/>
temple of Isis. Queen of the Pyramid. Near to the temple<br/>
of the Sphinx to the north-west of the temple of Osiris, Lord<br/>
of the Tomb. He hath built his Pyramid hard by the temple<br/>
of the Goddess, and he hath built the Pyramid of his royal<br/>
daughter <span style="color: #ff0000;">Honitsen </span>near unto this temple. This he hath<br/>
done to the glory of his mother Isis, Divine Mother, to the<br/>
glory of Hathor, Lady of the waters which come from the<br/>
firmament. He hath renewed her glory, and hath rebuilded<br/>
her sanctuary in stone. He <span style="color: #ff0000;">dwelleth </span>with them in his temple<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>We see the Sphinx now defaced and mutilated, though<br/>
Arab writers speak of its once strangely beautiful features.<br/>
A suggestion this that perhaps it is the sole survivor of a<br/>
more ancient civilisation still, far beyond our ken; for the<br/>
Egyptian craftsmen whom we know, did not aim at beauty<br/>
in itself<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>tied by convention, the keynote of their work was<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">grandeur</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">immensity </span>that disdained proportion. And yet,<br/>
there, close to their most ancient monuments, is that figure<br/>
perfect in proportion, form, and line, and once in beauty a<br/>
deeper, more mystical symbol than their most cunning<br/>
gravings, more real in life than their most immense statues.<br/>
<br/>
The granite temple a short distance south-east of the<br/>
Sphinx is known as the" Temple of the Sphinx," and is said<br/>
to have been the sanctuary of Sokaris Osiris: it is of considerable interest. Ancient as they are, the huge slabs of<br/>
granite of which it is built are so beautifully surfaced and<br/>
fitted that many of the joints even to-day are hardly <span style="color: #0000FF;">perceptible</span>.<br/>
<br/>
But to return to the Pyramids themselves, and such facts<br/>
as concern them: there are three--the Great Pyramid of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">CheOps</span>, the second Pyramid of Khephren, and the third,<br/>
far smaller, of Mycerinus <span style="color: #ff0000;">or- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Menkauru</span>. They are all attributed to the fourth dynasty.<br/>
<br/>
The height of the Great Pyramid is 451 ft. (formerly 482),<br/>
its sides are 750 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>long at the base (formerly 768)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and it<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cover</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>an area of about thirteen <span style="color: #0000FF;">acres </span>The second Pyramid<br/>
is 447 ft. high, and the third only 203 ft.<br/>
<br/>
The Pyramids seem to have been commenced with a<br/>
nucleus of rock around which were built huge stone steps<br/>
which were finally filled in with smooth polished stones.<br/>
The outer casing has been wholly removed at various periods,<br/>
and only <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fragment of it remains on the second Pyramid<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
