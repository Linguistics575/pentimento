<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
path emerges into the plain is the Rest House, established<br/>
by Messrs. Cook and Sons. The usual <span style="color: #ff0000;">planisfor </span>the hotel to<br/>
send lunch here; it can be taken in comfort, and afterwards<br/>
one can rest for an hour or so in the middle of the day.<br/>
<br/>
This is a favourite pitch for casual antiquity sellers, professional beggars, and bakshish <span style="color: #0000FF;">hunters </span>It is best to have<br/>
nothing to do with them, otherwise life for the rest of the<br/>
day will be a burden.<br/>

TEMPLE <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>QUEEN <span style="color: #ff0000;">HATASU </span>AT DEIR-EL-BAHARI<br/>
<br/>
A short distance from the Rest House is the temple of<br/>
Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasu </span>(eighteenth dynasty, B.C. 1500), rising by<br/>
broad terraces up the desert slope. The upper court is<br/>
surrounded on two sides by nearly perpendicular cliffs.<br/>
The sanctuary and other chambers are cut out of the rock.<br/>
<br/>
It will be noticed at once that the plan of this temple is a<br/>
complete departure from the usual design adopted by sovereigns of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties. In the<br/>
last year or two much light has been thrown on this point<br/>
by excavations carried out just south of the temple. The<br/>
ruins of a temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menthuhetep </span>(eleventh dynasty, <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>2500), having many points of resemblance to Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasu</span>'s,<br/>
have been unearthed just alongside the latter.<br/>
<br/>
It seems probable that Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasu</span>, seeing the older<br/>
edifice, copied it in some particulars.<br/>
<br/>
The representations of her, though much mutilated by<br/>
her brother and husband, Thothmes III., who reigned alternately with her, are interesting; as a ruler of Egypt, she is<br/>
given male attributes, such as a beard and male clothing.<br/>
Within the upper colonnade is a relief representing her<br/>
expedition to Punt.<br/>
<br/>
A short distance to the south is the village of Sheikh Abdel-Kurna, in and around which are a large number of tombs.<br/>
These belong to grandees and high court officials of the<br/>
eighteenth dynasty. A few of them are worth a visit, more<br/>
particularly Nos. 48, 125, and 18.<br/>

About fifteen minutes' ride south-east of Sheikh <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abd-elw<br/>
</span>Kurna is the Ramesseum, a large temple dedicated by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">94<br/>
