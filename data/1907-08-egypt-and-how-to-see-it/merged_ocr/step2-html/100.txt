<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>

<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">doom </span>opening on to the sanctuary is a curious fresco,<br/>
showing Decius sacrificing to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Knoumu</span>. Decius is the latest<br/>
Roman emperor cited in hieroglyphics on Egyptian monuments. On the north wall is a fresco of the hawk-headed<br/>
Horus netting <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-fowl </span>and fish in company with Commodus and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Knournu-a </span>curious trio.<br/>
<br/>
There is a small chapel in the east wall, where are several<br/>
inscriptions that mention the names of Roman emperors.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>has also a Roman quay wall on the river.<br/>
<br/>
At Mahamid, two stations beyond <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>, are the ruins of<br/>
El-Kab, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekkab </span>of ancient Egypt and Eileithyiaspolis of<br/>
the Greeks.<br/>
<br/>
The ruins, about two miles south of the station, are surrounded by an extremely massive wall of mud-brick 37 ft.<br/>
thick, which, although built during the Middle Empire, is<br/>
little damaged. There is a very fine view from the { north<br/>
wall.<br/>
<br/>
The small temple of Amenhotep III., to the east, is worth<br/>
seeing.<br/>
<br/>
There are many other remains. In the hills to the north are<br/>
rock tombs of the Middle and New Empires and inscriptions<br/>
by kings of the sixth dynasty; also a small rock temple,<br/>
reached by a stairway cut in the rock, and built under Euergetes II.<br/>

Edfou, the next station, once a great city, is now but a<br/>
small town. The temple is in the middle of the town on<br/>
the west bank of the river; it is the most perfect example of<br/>
an Egyptian temple existing <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The station of Edfou is on the edge of the river, which is<br/>
crossed by the ferry, and the temple is reached in twenty<br/>
minutes' walk or ten minutes' donkey-ride.<br/>
<br/>
Horus was the local deity, and to him the temple is <span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicated</span>. He was the first "Lord of the Two <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lands </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>in predynastic mythology. The temple, commenced by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemy<br/>
</span>Euergetes I. and continued by Philopator, was completed<br/>
by Neos Dionysius, who added the decorative reliefs. Other<br/>
rulers also added to it. It is a monument to the glory of<br/>
Horus and the greatness of the Ptolemaic monarchs. The<br/>
columns are admirably preserved, and richly decorated with<br/>
fine capitals. The paintings and reliefs on the ceiling of the<br/>
