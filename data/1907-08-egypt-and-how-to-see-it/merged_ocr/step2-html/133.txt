<span>ALEXANDRIA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
world of Europe was lately apprised of the fact that the city<br/>
had at last been found by two German savants, the Rev.<br/>
C. M. Kaufmann and Mr. Edward Falls. After arduous<br/>
search they arrived, thanks to the chance indications of a<br/>
Bedouin boy who had discovered a singularly perfect ampulla,<br/>
at the site of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">city<br/>
<br/>
</span>"On excavating they discovered four <span style="color: #0000FF;">basilicas</span>, the crypt<br/>
of St. Menas, the great baptistery, and many other sacred<br/>
buildings and baths. The basilica of the emperor must<br/>
have been a most impressive structure. It was covered<br/>
with marble and supported by fifty columns. A quantity<br/>
of beautifully sculptured capitals still remains. There is<br/>
also a series of sepulchral chambers underground. The<br/>
tomb and the crypt are also interesting, and must have been<br/>
beautifully decorated with mosaics. In the holy well, a<br/>
great cistern eighty-six metres long, have been discovered<br/>
thousands of ampullae.<br/>
<br/>
"The Monastery or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koinobion </span>of St. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menas-the </span>most<br/>
interesting of all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">remains-was </span>the finest in the whole of<br/>
Northern Africa.<br/>
<br/>
"When the city was first discovered the site was covered<br/>
with a series of low mounds. There was not a wall or trace<br/>
of a building to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">seen</span>. But since this part began to be<br/>
excavated great progress has been made, in spite of the<br/>
difficult nature of the work. The pavements of fifty rooms,<br/>
corridors, and halls have been unearthed at from four to<br/>
five metres underground. Entering by a portico, which was<br/>
formerly vaulted, the visitor can inspect a series of rooms.<br/>
Two courts with large cisterns have been opened up, and a<br/>
great deal of marble and blocks of fine <span style="color: #0000FF;">granite-the </span>latter<br/>
probably from Taposiris <span style="color: #0000FF;">Magma</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>to be seen. In this<br/>
part of the convent some curious little statues of monkeys<br/>
were found. In the baths of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koinobion </span>numbers of<br/>
amphorae and ampullae for holy water were discovered, many<br/>
of them with <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>The Rev. C. M. Kaufmann<br/>
considers, -from the various pottery ovens found here, that<br/>
all the ampullae of St. Menas which have been found elsewhere, such as at Kom - <span style="color: #0000FF;">el </span>- <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shougafa</span>, were made in the<br/>
factory here, for over eighty different kinds of ampullae have<br/>
been found lately in the ruins, and many thousands more<br/>
are still buried in the earth. Among other noteworthy<br/>
buildings are the baths connected with the baptistery. They<br/>
were fitted with waiting-rooms and supplied from large<br/>
<br/>
