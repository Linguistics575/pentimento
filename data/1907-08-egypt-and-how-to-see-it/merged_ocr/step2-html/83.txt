<span>UPPER EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
There are several hotels to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
The Winter Palace, a large new hotel which was only<br/>
opened at the beginning of 1907, is undoubtedly the best.<br/>
It is most comfortable, and compares very <span style="color: #ff0000;">favourably </span>with<br/>
the best Cairo hotels. It is well designed; the rooms are<br/>
large, airy, and well furnished; there is electric light, a lift,<br/>
and many private suites of rooms; the management is<br/>

</span>excellent. A little way from the village of Luxor, the<br/>
Winter Palace overlooks the Nile, of which delightful views<br/>
are obtained from the terrace in front.<br/>
<br/>
The Luxor Hotel is smaller and older, but quite comfortable. It stands in a very pretty garden, with shady walks,<br/>
and has also a tennis <span style="color: #0000FF;">court<br/>
<br/>
</span>Other hotels are the Karnak, Grand, and Savoy. There<br/>
is also a pension called the Grande Pension de Famille.<br/>
Full particulars of the hotels will be found on page 162.<br/>
<br/>
The village of Luxor is much like other native villages, and<br/>
not worth wasting time over. There are several antiquity<br/>
dealers, whose wares should always be purchased with caution,<br/>
