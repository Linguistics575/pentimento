CHAPTER IV<br/>
<br/>
UPPER EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
THE name "Upper Egypt "is applied to the country south<br/>
of Cairo as far as the Soudan <span style="color: #0000FF;">frontier-near </span>Wadi-Halfa.<br/>
Sometimes the name Middle <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>is used for the stretch<br/>
between Cairo and Assiout, south of which is Upper Egypt<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">proper..<br/>
<br/>
</span>Above all things, those who visit this country, even if<br/>
only for a short time, should see Luxor and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assouan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ideally </span>dry, warm and healthy, set in fine rugged hill scenery,<br/>
the home of monuments as wonderful as any the world<br/>
possesses<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>they should be the principal goal of all travellers<br/>
in the "Land of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khem. </span>"<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">time- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">honoured </span>highway is, of course, the Nile. Tourist<br/>
steamers (for which, see page 203) pass up and down frequently<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>wealthy visitors may hire a private sailing, or,<br/>
better still, a steam dahabeah (<span style="color: #0000FF;">01 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">house- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">boat</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>but the railway has been so greatly improved lately as to be acknowledged the most comfortable and convenient route. The river<br/>
journey has, of course, its pleasures and even luxuries, but it<br/>
can become tedious, and steamers are sometimes overcrowded.<br/>
