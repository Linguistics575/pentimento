<span>EGYPT. AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
it will contain four hundred rooms, fitted with every comfort<br/>
as well as sitting-rooms, reading-rooms, billiard-rooms.<br/>
concert-rooms, bars, & c. & c. In a word, it is designed to<br/>
meet every wish and even caprice of the visitor or resident<br/>
who cares to exchange the heat and dust and rush of Cairo<br/>
for the quiet and pure air of the desert. Further, the originators of the scheme have laid out a "Sporting Park," as<br/>
one may call it, for racing, golf, tennis, polo, and other games.<br/>
The purity of the keen air, the sense of space, the beauty of<br/>
the surroundings, and the graceful design and arrangement<br/>
of the whole city lend an unusual charm and distinction<br/>
thereto.<br/>
<br/>
Another quarter is devoted to the provision of houses and<br/>
flats for residents whose slender means forbid the high rents<br/>
exacted in Cairo. There are also various fine villas and<br/>
mansions being built for the richer residents.<br/>
<br/>
There is a police station, a church, and a mosque in the<br/>
best Arabic style. In a word, Heliopolis is to be a complete<br/>
city in the desert, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Giro </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">petto </span>with its own share of<br/>
amusements and interests, and without many of the disadvantages that so often weary and annoy the Cairenes. Mr<br/>
Edward Dicey, C.B., a well-known writer on Egypt and<br/>
Egyptian questions, says<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>The view of Cairo and of the<br/>
Pyramids and of the Delta as seen from the Suez desert<br/>
surrounding the Heliopolis Oasis City is one of the most<br/>
beautiful I have ever witnessed in any country of the world.'<br/>

<br/>
THE PYRAMIDS AND THE SPHINX<br/>
<br/>
Mena House, the Pyramids, and the Sphinx are as accessible as any one could <span style="color: #0000FF;">wish </span>nowadays. There is a really<br/>
good tramway service between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>(close to the Kasrel-Nil Bridge) and Mena.<br/>
<br/>
The fares are<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>First class, 3 pt.; second class, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>pt.<br/>
<br/>
A special late tram leaves Mena House on full-moon nights.<br/>
<br/>
The cab fare from Cairo is 40 pt. single, and 60 pt. return.<br/>
<br/>
The half-hour's run by tram is distinctly attractive. At<br/>
first the line parallels the left bank of the Nile, and one can<br/>
watch the river and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mokattams </span>and Citadel, grey and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">clear-cut </span>against the sky by day, deep blue and black and<br/>
studded with yellow lights at night. At Gizeh the line<br/>
changes its direction, turning almost at right angles towards<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mens</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>After the bridge over the railway is passed, the<br/>
