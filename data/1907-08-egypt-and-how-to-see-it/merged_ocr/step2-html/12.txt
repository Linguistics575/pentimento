<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
is quite adequate<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>though it is best to take a few thick things<br/>
as well. Moreover, Cairo is quite as fashionable, from the<br/>
point of view of dress, as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>capital, and affords<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">plentv </span>of occasions for wearing smart <span style="color: #0000FF;">Clothes<br/>
<br/>
</span>Cairo has plenty of shops, and one can procure almost anything necessary. The prices are in some cases a little higher<br/>
than in <span style="color: #ff0000;">EurOpe</span>. Special outfits, tropical helmets, smoked<br/>
. glasses, green veils, & c., are really never wanted in winter,<br/>
except once in a way for an excursion in the desert on a very<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hot </span>day. Sometimes at Luxor or Assouan, or for Sakkara, one<br/>
requires a little protection against glare and sun, even in the<br/>
cold weather, but never in Cairo, Alexandria, or in most parts<br/>
of Egypt for that matter. For such requirements Cairo<br/>
affords quite as good, if not better, choice than can <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>found<br/>
in London<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>A luncheon- and tea-basket is useful, and should certainly<br/>
be <span style="color: #0000FF;">brought</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Amateur photographers can procure films at any of the<br/>
chief tourist resorts at reasonable prices (Cairo, of course,<br/>
has several photographers' shops), and they can have their<br/>
photographs developed, or can do this themselves in the<br/>
dark-rooms provided in most of the hotels.<br/>
<br/>
Those who wish to do any shooting had better not bring<br/>
cartridges<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>as most steamship companies put difficulties in<br/>
the way of the transport of small quantities of ammunition.<br/>
Cartridges can be obtained in Alexandria and Cairo. For<br/>
shooting licences and other particulars see page 171.<br/>
<br/>
Visitors can, if they wish, hire very good private carriages<br/>
for the whole or part of their stay, and can almost always<br/>
find a coachman who knows some English.<br/>
<br/>
Motorists who bring their cars will find good roads in and<br/>
about Cairo and Alexandria, but that will <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span>their<br/>
limit. The country roads are primitive, and in most cases<br/>
quite impossible for motoring. There are several good<br/>
garages in Alexandria and Cairo. For particulars as to<br/>
licence and other information see page 170.<br/>
<br/>
From January to the middle of March the hotels are apt<br/>
to be full, and one should engage rooms beforehand by letter,<br/>
or there may be trouble on arrival. Full information as to<br/>
hotels, & c., is given on page 155 et <span style="color: #0000FF;">seq</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>and references will be<br/>
found in the various articles on Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor,<br/>
Assouan, & c. & c.<br/>
