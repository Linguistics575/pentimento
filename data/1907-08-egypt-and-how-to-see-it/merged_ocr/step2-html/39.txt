KHEDIVIAL LIBRARY<br/>
<br/>
The Khedivial Library is situated in the Sharia Mohammed<br/>
Ali, on the left-hand side going towards the Citadel, about<br/>
fifteen minutes' walk from the Post Office. Tramways also<br/>
pass the door. It was founded by the late Khedive Ismail<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Path</span>, and removed in 1904 from somewhat unsuitable<br/>
quarters in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Darb-el-Gamamiz </span>to the fine building which<br/>
it now occupies. It is open in winter every day except<br/>
Fridays and Mohammedan holidays from 8 A.M. till one<br/>
hour before sunset.<br/>
<br/>
Admission is free, but to enter the reading-room and newspaper-room a card is required, which is obtained free on<br/>
application to one of the attendants.<br/>
<br/>
There are over sixty-six thousand volumes in the library.<br/>
Half of these are in <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>languages and deal with various<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">subjects</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">history</span>, geography, and the different sciences;<br/>
the other half consists of books in Oriental languages. There<br/>
are more than thirteen thousand Arabic manuscripts.<br/>
<br/>
In a wing of the building especially set apart for them is<br/>
a very fine exhibition of illuminated Korans, dating for the<br/>
most part from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. This<br/>
collection numbers seven hundred in all, and is the finest in<br/>
existence.<br/>
<br/>
Among the other treasures may be mentioned: Papyri<br/>
from the first century of the Hegira, i.e., <span style="color: #0000FF;">622-719 </span>A.D.; a<br/>
copy of the Koran from the Mosque El-Amr. written about<br/>
725 A.D.; two very large <span style="color: #ff0000;">coPies</span>, one of which belonged to<br/>
the Sultan Khish Kadam (1461-1467 A.D.) and the other to<br/>
the Emir <span style="color: #0000FF;">Knit </span>Bey (1468-1495 A.D.), the latter measuring<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">432 </span>in. by 35 <span style="color: #ff0000;">in</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>some Persian MSS. of the fifteenth century,<br/>
