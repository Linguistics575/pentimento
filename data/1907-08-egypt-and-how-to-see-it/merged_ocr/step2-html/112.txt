CHAPTER V<br/>
THE SUDAN<br/>
<br/>
To a certain proportion of our annual visitors "wintering in<br/>
Egypt "includes a trip to Khartoum and Omdurman, but<br/>
these regular travellers to the south can as yet scarcely be<br/>
called numerous, though their numbers increase annually.<br/>
Doubtless to many people the word "Sudan "calls up visions<br/>
of burning deserts, arduous travel, and general conditions<br/>
remote from civilisation.<br/>
<br/>
Modern enterprise, however, has within a decade brought<br/>
the ancient capital of the dervishes within a few days'<br/>
journey of Cairo, and up-to-date means of travel, both by<br/>
river and rail, combine to render the journey at once comfortable and expeditious.<br/>
<br/>
The following notice has been issued for visitors to the<br/>
Sudan:<br/>
<br/>
