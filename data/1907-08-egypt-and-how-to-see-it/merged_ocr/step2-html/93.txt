<br/>
</span>wonderfully perfect, and the colours as fresh as when first<br/>
put on 3500 years ago. The limestone, too, is of such uniform<br/>
excellence that in many cases the reliefs are cut in the living<br/>
rock itself, and their surface is almost like marble.<br/>
<br/>
There are about forty rock tombs in all; many have been<br/>
damaged and are not worth seeing, but four or five are of<br/>
great interest. Nos. 35, 17, and 11 are perhaps the best, and<br/>
if one can spend more time Nos. 6 and 9 are worth seeing.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Amenhotep II. (No. 35) is of particular<br/>
interest, as some of the mummies found have been left in situ.<br/>
Besides the mummy of Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, which may be seen<br/>
lying in his sarcophagus, several other kings were also found.<br/>
Apparently at the time of Thebes' decline the royal tombs<br/>
were no longer safe from robbers, so that many of the mummies<br/>
were removed to safer places. This tomb is specially designed<br/>
to baffle the marauder. The main passage appears to end<br/>
in a large pit-like chamber, and it was only after considerable<br/>
trouble that the continuation of it was discovered, as the<br/>
opening had been bricked up and carefully concealed.<br/>
<br/>
Now that it is opened, a wooden bridge spans the pit,<br/>
and just beyond is the tomb chamber, with beautifully<br/>
coloured <span style="color: #0000FF;">reliefs </span>Amongst others the mummies of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>,<br/>
Thothmes IV., and Amenhotep III. were found here, and<br/>
have been removed to the Cairo Museum.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Seti I. (No. 17) was discovered by Belzoni<br/>
as early as 1817. The reliefs are considered to be the finest<br/>
of any in the tombs. They show the king before various<br/>
gods, also the different stages of the sun-god's passage through<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">under-world</span>. In the mummy chamber was found only<br/>
the alabaster sarcophagus; the mummy was found at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Deir</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Baheri</span>, and is in Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>(No. 11) varies from the<br/>
others, as on either side of the main passage is a series of<br/>
small chambers. The most diverse and interesting scenes<br/>
are depicted on their walls. The mummy of the king was<br/>
found at Deir-el-Bahari, and is now in the Cairo Museum.<br/>
<br/>
The tombs of Rameses IX. and VI. (Nos. 6 and 9) are also<br/>
interesting, and should not be missed, unless the visitor is<br/>
pressed for time<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>From the Tombs of the Kings a mountain-path leads over<br/>
the hill. It is about half an hour across to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Deir-el-Baharia </span>short <span style="color: #0000FF;">out</span>, and not difficult. Near the point where the<br/>
