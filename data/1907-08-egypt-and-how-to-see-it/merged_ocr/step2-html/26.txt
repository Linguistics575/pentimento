<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111+ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">day</span>! Cairo can hardly, even now, attain the<br/>
gorgeous dimensions and aspect pictured by the writer's<br/>
genial fancy, but it is a fine city, and of great extent<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>to the<br/>
east and south Abbassieh, the Citadel, then Old Cairo,<br/>
then <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh</span>; then Boulac, once the port of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">metropolis</span>;<br/>
then, going northwards, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Choubra-auch </span>are its boundaries.<br/>
It has well over half a million inhabitants, and a very large<br/>
European community, and is no mean city in appearance.<br/>
Stand on the ramparts of the Citadel, and you will see the<br/>
countless houses and mosques, the quiet, broad stream of the<br/>
Nile<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and, far off, the sharp grey forms of the Pyramids.<br/>
Turn round, and the old dead town is below you, silent, a<br/>
city of tombs; hard by, they seem close together, tombs<br/>
and voiceless huts; farther off, where the desert begins,<br/>
are the domed shrines, more sparse and <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuous</span>, of the<br/>
Caliphs and Mamelukes, under the shadow of the Red Mountain and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mokattams</span>. To the north are the villages on<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh </span>line, a long string of European <span style="color: #0000FF;">houses-almost<br/>
</span>a new <span style="color: #0000FF;">city-ranging </span>from Pont de Koubbeh out to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh<br/>
</span>itself. Beyond is desert, and the low hills that seem to bound<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">it-post</span>, clearest yellow and white. One <span style="color: #0000FF;">far-off </span>native<br/>
village, Kafr Gamous, stands out like a tiny fishing hamlet.<br/>
Its minaret might be the lighthouse at a harbour mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Cairo at present has a slightly unfinished aspect, owing to<br/>
the immense amount of building involved by the extraordinary incursion of <span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>of all sorts and nationalities<br/>
during recent years. Those who only knew Cairo ten or<br/>
fifteen years ago cannot recognise it now, with its crowded<br/>
streets, fine <span style="color: #0000FF;">shops</span>, high white houses, huge hotels, and<br/>
expansion on all sides. Where were almost waste places are now<br/>
streets; what was native suburb is now a <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>quarter.<br/>
<br/>
A walk through the main streets is interest enough in itself.<br/>
You pass "Shepheard's," its balcony crowded with curious<br/>
and amused tourists. Hawkers of all sorts are yelling, or<br/>
coaxing possible purchasers, offering postcards, ornamental<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">By-whisk</span>, walking-sticks, shawls, "<span style="color: #ff0000;">antikas</span>," scarabs fresh<br/>
from the factory. Snake-charmers and boys with tame<br/>
monkeys are performing their antics on the sidewalk.<br/>
Carriages and foot-passengers crowd the road and pavements.<br/>
At the open-air caf√©s are sitting crowds of Egyptians <span style="color: #0000FF;">or-in </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">evening-foreigners </span>of all kinds. The street widens out at the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">26<br/>
<br/>
