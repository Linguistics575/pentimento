<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>

<br/>
Full <span style="color: #0000FF;">time-tables </span>are given on pages 184 and 185.<br/>
The fares are: <span style="color: #ff0000;">1st </span>class, <span style="color: #0000FF;">MI </span>pt.; 2nd class, 43 pt..<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>and Mansourah are both large and important<br/>
towns. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>has a fine mosque, but its chief fame is that<br/>
it possesses the tomb of Said Ahmed <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Bedawy</span>, a celebrated<br/>
Moslem saint, in whose honour are festivals in January,<br/>
April, and August, the last two being the most important.<br/>
These "Moulids," as they are called, last a <span style="color: #0000FF;">week-from<br/>
</span>Friday to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Friday-and </span>are well worth seeing. There is a<br/>
huge crowd of some 200,000 people, who come in from all the<br/>
country round. Strange symbolical parades are held of fantastic emblems and curious dances; the uncanny, ceaseless,<br/>
Arab music and singing is their setting.<br/>
<br/>
After <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>the train passes <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mehallet-Kebir</span>, a charming<br/>
old town with many fair minarets and spires. One might be<br/>
tempted to spend a night there (though this can hardly be<br/>
recommended unless the traveller does not mind "roughing<br/>
it," as what inns the town possesses are very primitive). One<br/>
ought to walk through the town at sunset, up the narrow,<br/>
covered streets, past the many mosques. Then is heard,<br/>
startlingly sudden, the magnificent call to prayer breaking<br/>
out <span style="color: #0000FF;">overhead</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sonorous</span>, echoing and rolling through the<br/>
fading night. and dying away in a long wailing note.<br/>
<br/>
Mansourah is a great town for cotton and trade, and has<br/>
quite a considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>colony. The chief attraction<br/>
is the river view, and as a town it is notable as the place<br/>
where St. Louis was imprisoned in 1250 A.D.<br/>
<br/>
From Mansourah to Damietta the line parallels the river,<br/>
and passes at first through rich cotton country. None of<br/>
the small towns are of special interest or importance, though<br/>
they are characteristic enough of the country.<br/>
<br/>
Damietta itself, like Rosetta, declined as Alexandria rose,<br/>
but it is still a centre of a small commerce from Greek and<br/>
Levantine <span style="color: #ff0000;">ports</span>, besides the interior of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The general impression of Damietta is unique. The river<br/>
