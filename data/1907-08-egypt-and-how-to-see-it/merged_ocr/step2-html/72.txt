<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE <span style="color: #ff0000;">IT<br/>

fail to increase, unless some means are adopted for checking<br/>

</span>"It would be extremely difficult for the Government to<br/>
devise an effective remedy for this state of things. The real<br/>
remedy rests with the travellers themselves. If money<br/>
were, in future, only bestowed in return for some <span style="color: #0000FF;">actual<br/>
</span>service rendered, or in case of evident and established distress, the present pernicious habit of begging would soon die<br/>
out, to the advantage both of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>and of the visitors.<br/>
<br/>
"It is with this conviction that we venture to express a<br/>
hope that our fellow countrymen, when travelling in Egypt,<br/>
will lend their aid to this important reform by abstaining<br/>
from the distribution of money in response to mere demands<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">bakshish</span>, bestowing it only when the circumstances<br/>
appear to them to warrant their generosity.<br/>
<br/>
"Tourists should especially abstain from throwing money<br/>
from the decks of the steamers to the landing-stages or on<br/>
to the banks of the Nile for the purpose of witnessing the<br/>
scramble for the coins; such exhibitions are mischievous<br/>
as well as degrading.<br/>

</span>The shops in Upper Egypt are, as a rule, primitive, and it<br/>
is as well to take what one requires from Cairo. There are a<br/>
few <span style="color: #0000FF;">shops-chemists</span>, photograph shops, and suchlike, but<br/>
very little else in the way of European necessities is to be<br/>
found. As to clothes, one should take thick things as well<br/>
as <span style="color: #0000FF;">thin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>there are occasional cold days, and almost always<br/>
cold nights. It rains very seldom, but once in a way it does<br/>
rain, and a waterproof or umbrella may be found most useful,<br/>
even at Assouan, between November and March. A <span style="color: #ff0000;">sunhelmet </span>is really seldom necessary; a straw hat, or at most a<br/>
terai or felt <span style="color: #0000FF;">but</span>, is quite sufficient. The glare in the desert is<br/>
occasionally trying, and some visitors may find smoked glasses<br/>
comforting.<br/>
