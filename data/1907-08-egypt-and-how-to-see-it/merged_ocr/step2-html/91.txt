<br/>
Amenhotep 111., but bearing the names of many of the<br/>
later kings.<br/>
<br/>
Most people will consider Karnak well worth a second<br/>
visit at least; and, if possible, they should arrange to see it<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">moonlight-the </span>effect is impressive.<br/>
<br/>
Thebes--West <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bank.-0n </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>west side of the Nile there<br/>
are a great many points of interest which should on no<br/>
account be missed.<br/>
<br/>
It is best to start at about 10 A.M., to have lunch on the<br/>
far side. and return to Luxor about 3 or <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>RM<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Notice should be given to the hotel <span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span>, who will arrange<br/>
for lunch to be sent over to the Rest House erected by Messrs.<br/>
Cook on the western side.<br/>
<br/>
On the river-front <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>boats belonging to the various<br/>
hotels. and on the other side the donkeys are waiting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THE TEMPLE <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>SETI I. AT KURNA<br/>
<br/>
This is about three-quarters of an hour's ride in a northwesterly direction from the landing-stage. It is conspicuous<br/>
from a distance by the fine columns forming the <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The temple, founded in honour of Amen, and partly<br/>
decorated by Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, was completed by his son Rameses the<br/>
Great, who added many of his own <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>The portion<br/>
now standing represents only about a third of the original<br/>
building, as there were at least two pylons, separated from<br/>
the sanctuary by broad colonnade courts, which have <span style="color: #0000FF;">disappeared</span>. The walls bear interesting reliefs of Seti and<br/>
Rameses before the gods.<br/>
<br/>
THE TOMBS OF THE KINGS AT <span style="color: #0000FF;">BIBAN-EL-MULUK<br/>
<br/>
</span>Close to Kurna the desert begins and the spurs of the hills<br/>
meet the plain. The track enters a rocky valley<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>which<br/>
winds, and gradually narrows right into the heart of the<br/>
hills, arid, rocky, infinitely desolate; it is well named the<br/>
"Valley of Death." After half an hour's ride the valley<br/>
becomes a mere gorge, and ends in two or three rocky clefts.<br/>
This was the site chosen by the kings for their sepulture.<br/>
<br/>
Cut in the face of the almost perpendicular limestone are a<br/>
number of small, stone-lined doorways. All the tombs, though<br/>
of varying size and degree of elaboration, are made on the<br/>
same plan. A steep, <span style="color: #0000FF;">sloping </span>passage, cut downwards, right<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">91<br/>
