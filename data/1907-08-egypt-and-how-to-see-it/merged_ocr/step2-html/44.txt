<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
probably dating from the twelfth century. The church<br/>
itself was probably built in the sixth century; it is, however,<br/>
in a remarkably well-preserved <span style="color: #0000FF;">condition </span>In the corner<br/>
of the right aisle is a cabinet containing caskets in which are<br/>
said to be preserved the bones of St. Barbara and of other<br/>
saints.<br/>
<br/>
The return journey may be made from St. George's station<br/>
by the Helouan railway to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Babel-Louk </span>station, or by crossing<br/>
the line and continuing towards the Nile the terminus of the<br/>
tramway may be reached.<br/>
<br/>
Two churches in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky </span>quarter are worth seeing.<br/>
They are situated in the Sharia <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zuwila</span>, a lane leading out<br/>
of the Sharia-el-Souren, which is the first turning to the left<br/>
after passing the tram-line which crosses the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky</span>. The<br/>
churches are built one above the other; the upper one is<br/>
divided, as in the case of the other churches, by screens.<br/>
and contains the usual pictures of saints, among which are<br/>
those of the Virgin, St. Theodore, and St. George, which<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>according to an inscription, are four hundred years old. The<br/>
gallery above is occupied by <span style="color: #0000FF;">nun</span>, who are hidden from <span style="color: #0000FF;">sight<br/>
</span>by a tall screen.<br/>
<br/>
Below the level of this church, and communicating with<br/>
it by a flight of stairs, is the other, dedicated to the Virgin.<br/>
It has been recently restored, but great care has been taken<br/>
to leave it as much as possible in its original state. In an<br/>
annex is shown a greatly venerated picture of the Virgin<br/>
Mary and Child; the hands of the Child and the tiara which<br/>
surrounds His head are of silver.<br/>
<br/>
HELOUAN<br/>
<br/>
Helouan has a certain distinction in that it is, so far, the<br/>
only modern "desert "town in the north of Egypt. Its<br/>
chief merits are the fine air and the sulphur baths. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Obviously<br/>
</span>it is more a resort for invalids than for others, yet <span style="color: #0000FF;">many<br/>
</span>prefer it even to Cairo. A group of houses on yellow sand.<br/>
the range of high, sheer hills to the east, the broad plain down<br/>
to the river, and, beyond, the Pyramids<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Sakhara. Dahshur.<br/>
and in the far distance <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mena-such </span>is Helouan, brilliant.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">clear-cut</span>, and wind-swept, in keen sunlight. In the evening<br/>
all is enhanced by the glorious colouring of the sunset: the<br/>
Pyramids stand out to the last; at first sharp and red, thev<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">become </span>dim purple <span style="color: #ff0000;">shaPeS</span>, and then fade with the fading<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">44<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
