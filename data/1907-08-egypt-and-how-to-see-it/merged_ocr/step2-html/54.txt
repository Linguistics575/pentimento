<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The smooth surface was covered with sculptures and inscriptions.<br/>
<br/>
The chambers and passages inside had their special uses<br/>
as sepulchres, and were finally closed when the king for<br/>
whom they were built had been entombed. There used to<br/>
be a temple close to each Pyramid, devoted to the honour of<br/>
the monarch.<br/>
<br/>
The Great Pyramid can be climbed<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>it is an exertion<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and<br/>
though the view is fine, it is quite what one expects from any<br/>
high point. Ascent by proxy is, however, quite easy and<br/>
costs a few piastres: the Arab boys are always ready to<br/>
compete therein.<br/>
<br/>
The Great Pyramid was opened by Caliph El-Mamoun in<br/>
820 <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>D. on the chance of finding treasure, but the entrance<br/>
his men made is now blocked up. The present entrance is<br/>
about 40 ft. from the base. A great vaulted gallery leads<br/>
down to the subterranean chamber<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>90 ft. below the base and<br/>
347 ft. from the entrance; it is 11 ft. high and measures<br/>
46 by 27 ft. Mariette claimed that this was a false chamber,<br/>
intended to divert the attention of any one entering from<br/>
the real tomb. An upward passage leads towards the centre.<br/>
and is the approach to the "Queen's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chamber </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">( </span>18 ft. by<br/>
17 and 20 ft. high). Mariette considers that here also the<br/>
passage to the great gallery was closed, so that those who<br/>
reached this point might suppose they had seen all the<br/>
Pyramid held<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The great gallery is 151 ft. long, 7 ft. wide,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">28 </span>ft. high; it leads to the King's Chamber (34 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>by 17<br/>
and 19 ft. high), in which are the remains of a red granite<br/>
sarcophagus.<br/>
<br/>
There is much argument about these Pyramids<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>some<br/>
even consider that they had some strange metrical and<br/>
dimensional object. But however their dimensions may<br/>
have been devised, the consensus of opinion is that they are<br/>
tombs: for that matter the Pyramid may be a monument<br/>
to the king's learning as well as a resting-place for his body.<br/>
<br/>
The smallest Pyramid, that of Mycerinus, is said, in<br/>
one legend, to have been built by one of the princesses on<br/>
doubtfully acquired resources; another myth assigns it to<br/>
Rhodopis, but Mycerinus was the real builder. He it is to<br/>
whom it was revealed by the gods that he had but six years<br/>
to live, but it is said that he doubled the period by turning<br/>
day into night.<br/>
