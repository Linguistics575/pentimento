<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
covered in and populous with sellers of Assiout shawls, red<br/>
slippers, and red and black <span style="color: #0000FF;">pottery-vases </span>and cups of rather<br/>
formal design, animals, monkeys, camels, lizards, quaintly<br/>
moulded and whimsical of expression<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The barrage is about a mile <span style="color: #0000FF;">away-a </span>long, plain, solid<br/>
succession of <span style="color: #0000FF;">arches</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the Nile stretches blue-grey above<br/>
and below it. Here, too,<br/>
are gardens, made and in<br/>
preparation, with delightful<br/>
weeping - willows. Kingfishers, hoopoes, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">waterwagtails </span>hop about and flit<br/>
to and fro under the brilliant<br/>
sunlight.<br/>
<br/>
Assiout is still rather<br/>
primitive, perhaps, but it<br/>
has one small <span style="color: #0000FF;">hotel-the<br/>
</span>New <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hotel-close </span>to the<br/>
station, which is certainly<br/>
much cleaner than most of<br/>
its kind. One may well<br/>
spend two or three days<br/>
there. There is a certain<br/>
cleanliness and quiet, too,<br/>
about the town, an absence<br/>
of noise or crowd, a distinct picturesque placidity<br/>
that makes the best of the<br/>
clear air and the sun<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The country to the south<br/>
<br/>
On the Canal, Beni-Korra of Assiout is wholly subject<br/>
<br/>
to "basin irrigation"; the<br/>
<br/>
land is divided up by banks of earth into basins several<br/>
<br/>
miles across. In the autumn, when the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>is in flood, the<br/>
<br/>
basins are filled, the water is allowed to stand for a month<br/>
<br/>
or six weeks, and then it flows back to the river or into<br/>
<br/>
another basin at a lower level.<br/>
<br/>
For this reason it will be noticed that the villages are built<br/>
<br/>
on mounds and stand up a few feet above the fields.<br/>
<br/>
Sohag (kilo. 470) is the next place of importance. This is<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mudirieh </span>town, or capital, of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Guergueh </span>province. It<br/>
