<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>

<br/>
cisterns twenty-two metres deep. A reservoir, forty by<br/>
seventy metres, has been found close by. In another part<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koinobion </span>a dining-hall has been discovered. It was<br/>
probably reserved for distinguished guests. Here was<br/>
found a magnificent relief in white marble. The roof of<br/>
this hall was supported by columns, and the walls were<br/>
covered with marble and porphyry. The Rev. C. M. Kaufmann informs us that, judging from the numerous fine<br/>
capitals which have of late been found on the west side of<br/>
the monastery, he hopes to come upon the church of St.<br/>
Thekla, which is mentioned in the life of the saint. This<br/>
church was within the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koinobion</span>, and probably some highly<br/>
important discoveries will be made there."<br/>
<br/>
ABOUKIR<br/>
<br/>
A very pleasant excursion may be made to Aboukir, a<br/>
small village about ten miles east of Alexandria, along the<br/>
coast. It has much historical interest, both ancient and<br/>
modern. Near it stood the great city of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canopus </span>in Ptolemaic times, and here the Canopic branch of the Nile entered<br/>
the sea. According to Seneca, Canopus was <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>remarkable for the luxury and depravity of its inhabitants.<br/>
<br/>
In later times Aboukir is famous as giving its name to<br/>
Nelson's great battle and victory over the French <span style="color: #0000FF;">Met </span>in<br/>
1798. Napoleon defeated the Turkish army in 1799 at<br/>
Aboukir, and his army was defeated there by Sir Ralph<br/>
Abercrombie in 1801.<br/>
<br/>
There are frequent trains to Aboukir from Sidi-Gaber<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Alexandria-Ramleh </span>Railway Company's station). The<br/>
journey occupies about <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty-five </span>minutes. The following<br/>
are the best trains:<br/>
<br/>
From Sidi Gaber: 10.50 A M, 2.0 and 4.10 P.M.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span>, Aboukir: 1.10, 4.55, 7.0, and 8.35 P M.<br/>
<br/>
The fares are<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lst </span>class, single, <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>pt.; return, 6 pt<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>2nd <span style="color: #ff0000;">9</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9</span>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">9</span>; <span style="color: #ff0000;">99 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>A good way of making the expedition is to go to Aboukir<br/>
by railway and on the return to charter donkeys and ride<br/>
back to San Stefano along the coast. From San Stefano<br/>
the electric tram takes one to Alexandria in a few minutes.<br/>
