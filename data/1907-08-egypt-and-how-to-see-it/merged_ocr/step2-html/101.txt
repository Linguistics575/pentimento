catalogued on the walls. The other was called the room of<br/>
purification. This rite was similar to Christian baptism,<br/>
and consisted in aspersions of holy water. There is a picture<br/>
of the king being purified by Horus and Thoth.<br/>
<br/>
The finest and most delicately conceived relief is that on<br/>
the north wall of the hall above the door; it depicts a solar<br/>
disc and a winged scarabeus in a boat, with two hawk-headed<br/>
figures of Horus. The hypostyle is supported by twelve<br/>
pillars with floral capitals and rich decoration.<br/>
<br/>
The walls of the temple are beautifully painted; everywhere are figures of Horus and Hathor. The most important<br/>
is the west wall, on which is the textual and pictorial description of the battles of Horus. His foes have crocodile and<br/>
hippopotamus heads. With Horus are associated the king<br/>
and Isis. In the first relief the king and Horus are each<br/>
slaying a hippopotamus with javelins.<br/>
