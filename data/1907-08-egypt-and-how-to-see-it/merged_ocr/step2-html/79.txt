<span>UPPER EGYPT<br/>
<br/>
can claim some attention owing to the proximity of the two<br/>
great Coptic monasteries, the White and the Red. These<br/>
once magnificent buildings suffered repeatedly at the hands<br/>
of the Mamelukes. They are now being slowly and carefully<br/>
repaired. They are situated on the desert edge.<br/>
<br/>
Sohag itself has only one <span style="color: #0000FF;">feature-the </span>river-front. A long<br/>
line of dwelling-houses faces the Nile, and the road is shaded<br/>
by lebbek-trees. The soft, peaceful, changing lights on the<br/>
water, the boats passing lazily up and down, the distant<br/>
fertile shore, and the hills that bound the view, form a most<br/>
characteristic <span style="color: #0000FF;">picture </span>In the immediate foreground are the<br/>
women scrambling up and down the bank, washing clothes,<br/>
fetching water, and chattering all the time.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Guergueh </span>(kilo. 504) is a large town. There is a very old<br/>
Roman Catholic convent here, and across the river are the<br/>
remains of a temple of Rameses the Great.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Birbeh</span>, a little to the north of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Guergueh</span>, is supposed to<br/>
be the site of This, or Thinis, the seat of the earliest of all<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dynasties-the </span>first and second. In the hills on the<br/>
left can be seen the rock tombs of the Thinite notables.<br/>
<br/>
Baliana (kilo. 521) is the station for the temples of Abydos.<br/>
For this expedition donkeys can be engaged at the station;<br/>
the charge is 10 pt. per day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ABYDOS<br/>
<br/>
Abydos is some six or seven miles from Baliana station.<br/>
The route is uninterrupted, over the rich plain, along the<br/>
high <span style="color: #0000FF;">causeway-the </span>one path from river to desert edge<br/>
when the floods are out. Abydos has one of the most important and interesting of all the temples in Egypt. It was<br/>
built by Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, the father of Rameses the Great, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bas-reliefs </span>and paintings are as wonderful as any in Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>carried out with the greatest skill and exactitude. They<br/>
are, as in the art of that period, conventional and devoted<br/>
to elaborate and minute detail, but the thoroughness of the<br/>
work distinguishes it from almost all that of other epochs.<br/>
<br/>
The important feature of this temple is the Tablet of the<br/>
Kings. It shows Seti, the king, and Rameses, the prince,<br/>
offering the sacred fire and reading the hymn; and then<br/>
follow the cartouches of seventy-six of the most noted kings<br/>
of Egypt, from Menes to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seri-a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">greet </span>and valuable record<br/>
for Egyptologists.<br/>
