line. At last come fields, trees, houses, and then Suez (Suez<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Town</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>dusty old town, stretching in untidy detachments<br/>
down to the sea.<br/>
<br/>
The train passes through the town and comes out upon a<br/>
long causeway leading to Suez Docks.<br/>
<br/>
Round the docks is a small town in itself, and the cleanest.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">pleasantest </span>part of Suez. Here are the Canal Co.'s and other<br/>
offices, with the houses of the officials facing a shady boulevard. In front passes the ceaseless stream of shipping,<br/>
entering and leaving the Canal.<br/>
<br/>
Look seaward. The anchorage is bounded on the right<br/>
by the high red cliffs of Gebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Attakah</span>; on either side the<br/>
more distant hills tail off, grey-blue, towards the open <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>where runs the road to India and the Far East.<br/>
<br/>
There are two small hotels, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hotel </span>Bachet and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">HOtel </span>Bel-Air, but few people stay in Suez unless <span style="color: #0000FF;">compelled </span>by the exigencies of travel.<br/>
<br/>
THE SUEZ CANAL<br/>
<br/>
The Canal by day is not profoundly exciting. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">progress </span>is slow, the scenery unvaried. One should start in the<br/>
late afternoon, and take advantage of the night-time. For<br/>
the night reveals the one feature of the voyage at its <span style="color: #ff0000;">bestthe </span>Bitter Lakes. After a slow and toilsome journey through<br/>
the narrow passage, the ship emerges suddenly into the<br/>
open. The searchlight plays full, brilliant, on the depth of<br/>
dark sky and water.<br/>
<br/>
Myriad white shapes appear ahead, flitting, dipping.<br/>
skimming, nearing the boat, then retreating, resting on the<br/>
water, quitting it, with slow-flapping wings. When <span style="color: #0000FF;">they<br/>
</span>are quite close, under full play of the light, you can see that<br/>
they are pelicans, with their wide wings, long beak, and<br/>
pouch beneath. As they pass under the ray they appear as<br/>
tongues of flame, transparent, mysterious, against the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bright<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">darkness </span>of the water.<br/>
<br/>
Here the ships do not stop to exchange courtesies or combat precedence for tying up. A big P. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">O.</span>, or along<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>lean<br/>
German Lloyd <span style="color: #0000FF;">sheets </span>past almost at full speed, ablaze with<br/>
light. The pilot-boat hangs on for dear life, while the pilot<br/>
ascends or descends the ladder like a trained acrobat. At<br/>
length <span style="color: #0000FF;">one</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>own boat makes the entrance, and from the<br/>
Bitter Lakes the Canal is placid, <span style="color: #0000FF;">narrow</span>, and uneventful as far<br/>
as Port Said.<br/>
