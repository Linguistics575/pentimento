Sais, a collection of fishermen's huts on the south of the<br/>
lake, was once an important city, Tanis. It was the capital<br/>
in the twenty-first dynasty. The numerous obelisks are attributed to Rameses the Great, and a gateway <span style="color: #0000FF;">beam </span>his name.<br/>
<br/>
The ruins of the city were uncovered by Mariette, who<br/>
found huge fallen and broken obelisks and great statues of<br/>
porphyry and granite. Pillars and stones lie here and there<br/>
where they fell one by one in the silent ages. Pottery and<br/>
papyri of great interest have also been found. Amongst<br/>
them were a table of hieroglyphics and a geographical pamphlet showing the names or provinces of ancient Egypt.<br/>

the "Land of Khem."<br/>
