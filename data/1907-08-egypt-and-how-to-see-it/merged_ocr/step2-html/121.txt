<span>THE DELTA<br/>
<br/>
sufficient wealth to occupy his army for three days in<br/>
pillage.<br/>
<br/>
The town is as uninteresting as most Arab towns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>surrounding country is <span style="color: #0000FF;">pretty-by </span>the Ismailia Canal,<br/>
for instance, which is the barrier between the cultivated<br/>
land and the desert. Near the lock is the irrigation resthouse, by <span style="color: #0000FF;">itself-a </span>most attractive spot in the evening<br/>
light. Behind it is a broad track of sand, then a few straggling palms, then the desert, changing rapidly to violet as<br/>
the shadows lengthen. In the far distance is a line of low<br/>
hills, of the deepest purple. The canal, luminous in the<br/>
failing light with soft reflections, stretches straight in either<br/>
direction. High-masted boats move slowly down the stream.<br/>
<br/>
There are many such attractive places in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Delta-the<br/>
</span>road from Bilbeis to Abou Hammad, for example. It is<br/>
about sixteen miles, parallel with the canal bank. The<br/>
scenery consists of palm-trees, crops of all sorts, and here<br/>
and there a village. There is many a quaint <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkieh</span>, on<br/>
which a small boy or girl stands, like a charioteer, above the<br/>
horizontal wheel, yelling now and again and brandishing a<br/>
stick to prevent the buffalo from going fast asleep.<br/>
<br/>
The whole road is delightful, sunlit and sleepy. Now<br/>
and again a fat village notable passes on an equally fat<br/>
donkey, or a splendid dark- faced Bedouin on a fine mare,<br/>
a true horseman--one would say a centaur but for the<br/>
flow of robes and the glistening girdle <span style="color: #0000FF;">round </span>the head- dress.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Salhieh</span>, again, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Komin</span>, where the French fought, are<br/>
good <span style="color: #0000FF;">places-tig </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-groves </span>at the end of all things, on the<br/>
border of the desert. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salhieh </span>one walks straight away<br/>
from civilisation and the railway station on to the sand.<br/>
Only the line of telegraph posts to Kantarah breaks the<br/>
monotony. The yellow sand gleams, and the distant mounds<br/>
here and there fade and seem to take strange shapes in the<br/>
mirage of the strong sunlight. Now and again one comes<br/>
on a gipsy-faced woman tending a few goats that nibble<br/>
the scarce, stunted shrubs. In the distance, perhaps, appears<br/>
a Bedouin <span style="color: #0000FF;">caravan-a </span>long string of camels, laden with a<br/>
miscellaneous assortment of <span style="color: #0000FF;">wares-returning </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mia</span>;<br/>
for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salhieh </span>is on the old overland route to Asia used since<br/>
the time of the Pharaohs by just such caravans as one may<br/>
see to- day.<br/>
