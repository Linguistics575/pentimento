under which the Virgin is said to have rested, and the well<br/>
from which she drew water wherewith to wash the Child's<br/>
garment. Where she threw it down balsam-plants sprang<br/>
up, so it is said. The balsam-trees which originated from<br/>
these were said to grow nowhere else in Egypt, and no<br/>
Christian was considered to be properly baptized unless a<br/>
drop of their oil was thrown into the font. The Apocryphal<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">GOSpels </span>also state that the idols of On fell down when the<br/>
Virgin and Child reached the city.<br/>
<br/>
On the desert side of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh </span>is the Ostrich Farm, which<br/>
is open to visitors. It is an interesting object for an <span style="color: #0000FF;">afternoon </span>excursion. The view from the top of the building,<br/>
round which are the pens of the ostriches, embraces desert<br/>
and cultivation, Cairo and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mokattams</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Marg is a thoroughly native mud village in a large grove<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-trees</span>; it contrasts strikingly with the European<br/>
settlements at the other stations.<br/>
<br/>
One can motor out as far as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh</span>, and it is possible<br/>
that a motor-road may <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>made shortly as far as Khanka.<br/>
The trains run every half-hour from Pont <span style="color: #ff0000;">Limoun </span>to Marg<br/>
up to 1.30 at night. The time-table is on page 187.<br/>

THE HELIOPOLIS OASIS<br/>
<br/>
The phenomenal extension of Cairo in all directions induced<br/>
a group of financiers to start the scheme known as the "Heliopolis Oasis "in 1905. Some five thousand acres of highlying desert land near H.H. the Khedive's Palace at Koubbeh<br/>
were procured, with the object of building a species of desert<br/>
pleasure city. The work is at this moment progressing<br/>
vigorously. A fine road connects Abbassieh with the "Oasis,"<br/>
and a motor service has been organised. An electric <span style="color: #0000FF;">railway<br/>
</span>is also in process of construction, to connect the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Oasis </span>"<br/>
with Pont <span style="color: #ff0000;">Limoun </span>station, and a network of roads has been<br/>
laid out in the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">city </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>itself. Some fifty villas and shops,<br/>
a station for the electric railway, a family hotel, a casino in<br/>
Moorish style, and the Heliopolis Palace Hotel are in course<br/>
of erection, and a large amount of work has already been<br/>
achieved.<br/>
<br/>
The Palace Hotel has been conceived on a large scale.<br/>
It is in the Oriental style of architecture, and will have a<br/>
fine restaurant on each of its two stories, from whence is<br/>
obtained a wide view of the desert, the cultivation. and Cairo;<br/>
