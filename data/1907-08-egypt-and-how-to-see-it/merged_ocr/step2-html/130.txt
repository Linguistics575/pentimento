<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
papyri. Ptolemy II. (Philadelphus) built the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharcs</span>, a lighthouse of white marble. once one of the seven wonders of the<br/>
world. During the reign of the Ptolemies Alexandria must<br/>
have been a great and magnificent city.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Thelibrary </span>and museum were burnt <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>ground on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Julius<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesar</span>'s entry into Alexandria. In compensation Antony<br/>
is supposed to have presented Cleopatra and her city with<br/>
the library of Pergamus. in which were some 200,000 MSS.<br/>
This second library was destroyed by order of the Caliph<br/>
Omar about 640 A.D.<br/>
<br/>
The Serapeum was a very wonderful building. Begun<br/>
bv Caesar and completed by Augustus<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>it held the statue<br/>
of Serapis, which was worshipped by both Greeks and<br/>
Egyptians.<br/>
<br/>
Alexandria was a great centre of Christianity and persecution; perhaps there was more internecine discord there<br/>
than in anv other city of Christian history. Every one who<br/>
has read Kingsley's book will remember the fate of Hypatia<br/>
and the character the author gives to the fierce monks and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">priests </span>Arius, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Athanasius</span>, Cyril, Nestorius, and many a<br/>
relentless sectarian contributed their share to Alexandrine<br/>
discord.<br/>

POMPEY'S PILLAR AND THE CATACOMBS<br/>
<br/>
Few relics of Alexandria's former greatness remain; the<br/>
most interesting are Pompey's Pillar and the Catacombs.<br/>
The former consists of a single red-granite shaft about seventy<br/>
feet high. It was erected by a Roman prefect of Egypt in<br/>
the reign of Diocletian. It can be easily reached by tram<br/>
from the Mohammed Aly Square in about ten minutes.<br/>
<br/>
A short distance west of Pompey's Pillar are the Catacombs. Among them are many interesting tombs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>four centuries <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ant</span>. One fine tomb of the Roman period<br/>
was discovered in 1900, and is well worth a visit. It has<br/>
most interesting and beautiful reliefs both in Egyptian and<br/>
Roman style. Professor Wallis Budge in Messrs. Cook's<br/>
guidebook goes into details fully and with admirable <span style="color: #ff0000;">prec1s10n</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The two obelisks known as "Cleopatra's Needles "once<br/>
stood in Alexandria, but they have been removed and are<br/>
now, one in London and the other in New York.<br/>
