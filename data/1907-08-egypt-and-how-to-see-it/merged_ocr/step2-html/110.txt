<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
monoliths for many a mighty statue, temple, and obelisk;<br/>
indeed, wherever the red granite is seen throughout all<br/>
Egypt every stone had its origin in these quarries, cut<br/>
laboriously with primitive tools from the rocks of Assouan.<br/>
shaped and smoothed with consummate skill, then floated<br/>
down the river on vast rafts, and finally dragged, by the<br/>
labour of thousands<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>to their resting-place in some far<br/>
northern shrine. One huge obelisk<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>90 ft. long, can be <span style="color: #ff0000;">seen<br/>
</span>at the quarries, half excavated, with one face still joined to<br/>
the mother rock.<br/>
<br/>
These quarries, which are to the south of the town, <span style="color: #0000FF;">should<br/>
</span>be visited (donkeys<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>5 to 8 pt.)<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">PHILIE<br/>
<br/>
</span>The most remarkable monuments are on the island of<br/>
Philae, a short distance from the dam. The island has been<br/>
called the "Pearl of Egypt," and certainly its setting is<br/>
most beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
The temples, of which there are several, all date from the<br/>
Ptolemaic period. No doubt there were earlier shrines. but<br/>
these have disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to visit <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>is to take the train from Assouan to Shellal. The journey takes half an hour. The<br/>
trains are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
From Assouan<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>7.0, 9.0, 10.45 A.M., 2.10, 4.0, and 5.10 P.M'<br/>
From Shellal: 8.0, 9.40, 10.5 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ALL</span>, 12.0, 2.50, and 6.0 RM.<br/>
<br/>
The fares are: First class, 6 pt.; second class, 3 pt.<br/>
<br/>
At Shellal boats are in waiting.<br/>
<br/>
Since the construction of the Assouan dam the island of<br/>
Philae is submerged from about the middle of January till<br/>
the middle of June. When the water is high the temples<br/>
must be approached and entered by boat.<br/>
<br/>
After exploring Philae a visit to the dam can be made,<br/>
and then one can return to Assouan by boat, down the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">cataract</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>ELEPHANTINE ISLAND<br/>
<br/>
There are the remains of several temples on the south<br/>
end of the Island of Elephantine, opposite the Cataract<br/>
Hotel, and also a very old Nilometer, which is worth seeing.<br/>
<br/>
