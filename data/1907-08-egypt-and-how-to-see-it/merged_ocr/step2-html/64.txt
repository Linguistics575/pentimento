<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
The Fayoum is radically different from all the rest of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>it is practically an artificial <span style="color: #0000FF;">province-neither </span>more<br/>
nor <span style="color: #0000FF;">less-brought </span>into being by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahr- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yussuf </span>some four<br/>
thousand years ago. <span style="color: #0000FF;">This</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>probably it<br/>
existed a thousand years before his day) flows westward<br/>
from the Nile, and divides into many little canals that water<br/>
the whole country and ensure its unusual <span style="color: #0000FF;">fertility-for </span>it is<br/>
unusually fertile. Roses, apricots, figs, grapes, olives, corn,<br/>
cotton, and many another fruit or crop, all are plentiful, and<br/>
some superior to what we find <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the rest of Egypt. Even<br/>
the sheep and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fowls </span>are fat and well- liking.<br/>
<br/>
To the north, east and south are the hills which separate<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fayoum </span>from Egypt and the Libyan Desert. To the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">north- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">west </span>is Lake Moeris (Birket- el- Karoun). This was<br/>
the glory of the province, the home of the sacred crocodiles<br/>
worshipped by the dwellers 1n <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoé</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoé </span>like Ombos<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>had its <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tentyris</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>city of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heracle0polis </span>whose citizens<br/>
worshipped the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ichneumon</span>. There was also the Labyrinth,<br/>
a marvel to Herodotus.<br/>
<br/>
Lake Moeris was probably partly artificial, it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>in fact,<br/>
a great reservoir that supplied water to all the land lying<br/>
north of it. King Amenemhet <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>(twelfth dynasty) seems<br/>
to have been the first to put it to this use; he built a regulator and other irrigation works, of which remains are still<br/>
to be seen at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lahoun</span>. Incidentally it harboured the sacred<br/>
crocodiles, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">also-as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nowadays-a </span>quantity of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoé </span>is a mere heap of <span style="color: #ff0000;">débris</span>, haunted by the kite and<br/>
the jackal <span style="color: #0000FF;">alone-that </span>great city where Sebek, the crocodile<br/>
god, was worshipped. Many kinds of fish, too, <span style="color: #0000FF;">seem </span>to have<br/>
been sacred. The priests probably combined <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>sacred<br/>
fish culture with practical irrigation, and induced the people<br/>
on religious grounds to maintain the waterways which were<br/>
actually to serve the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crops</span>. The principle of the widespread<br/>
utility of Lake Moeris was that the Nile, when high<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>flowed<br/>
into it. As the Nile flood receded the surplus water in the<br/>
lake returned to the river through the various exits and<br/>
sluices, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">repaid </span>its debt.<br/>
<br/>
The modern town of Medinet-el-Fayoum is interesting.<br/>
The broad Bahr- el- Yussuf flows through it from end to end,<br/>
bridged here and there, and with streets on either bank.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">water- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">wheels </span>are here (and nowhere else in Egypt)<br/>
worked <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the current itself. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoé </span>is to the north.<br/>
