<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
to have been the only attempt to escape from the influence<br/>
of the all-powerful Theban priesthood of Amen-Ra. He<br/>
preferred the worship of a single deity (the sun) to the<br/>
polytheism of his predecessors, changed his name to Khuenaten, "The Splendour of the Sun," and obliterated the name<br/>
of Amen-Ra from the walls of his sanctuaries. The priests<br/>
appear, however, to have been too powerful for him, and he<br/>
found it impossible to live at Thebes.<br/>
<br/>
A site for a new capital was chosen at a point half-way<br/>
between Memphis and Thebes. The famous architect Bek<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>son of Men, was employed to build a magnificent royal city,<br/>
adorned with splendid temples, and containing a palace for<br/>
the king. This city was called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Elrhut-Aterr-</span>" The Horizon<br/>
of the Sun."<br/>
<br/>
Besides being a religious reformer, the king appears to<br/>
have encouraged the advance of art. Under his patronage<br/>
the enlightened Bek produced some exceedingly fine work,<br/>
of which an example is preserved in the beautiful stucco<br/>
pavements which formed part of the king's palace, and which<br/>
can still be <span style="color: #ff0000;">seen</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A number of very interesting cuneiform tablets were found<br/>
in 1887, being despatches to Amenhotep IV. from the rulers<br/>
of Mesopotamia and other Asiatic countries. These show<br/>
that the king's other interests had so monopolised him<br/>
that he was neglecting the affairs of the empire.<br/>
<br/>
Amenhotep passed the remainder of his life quietly at the<br/>
new capital with his mother and wife and his seven daughters.<br/>
Soon after his death his successors returned to Thebes and<br/>
the thraldom of Amen; the "City of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sun </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>was allowed<br/>
to fall into ruins, and art into its former convention.<br/>

Assiout (kilo. 378) is the largest city in Upper Egypt, largely<br/>
inhabited by Copts.<br/>

The trains stop here for five minutes. The station has<br/>

ASSIOUT<br/>
<br/>
A town of white minarets, white and grey houses, and<br/>
many palm-trees, right under a big bluff of scarred, sandy<br/>
hill, it stands clear and clean against the plain, fortified from<br/>
the autumn <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood </span>by low mud bastions.<br/>
<br/>
There are fairly broad roads past fine houses and gardens,<br/>
leading then to winding, narrow streets. Many of these are<br/>
