<span>THE DELTA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
flows past the curious old houses; steps descend to the water.<br/>
Every house has its boat, it is the Venice or Amsterdam of<br/>
Egypt, and has the charm of all such river-side cities. Behind<br/>
and above the row of houses at the waterside are minarets,<br/>
roofs, mosques, a wide extent of buildings; for Damietta is<br/>
a town of some size, and has notable bazaars<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Damietta has a history of its own. It was the gate of<br/>
mediaeval Egypt long before it had eclipsed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pe-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lusium </span>and annexed <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>trade of the eastern delta<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>fell before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Byzant-ines </span>in 860 A.D.. but they<br/>
lost it, and the Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">ElMetounkel </span>fortified it six<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">years </span>later. Then followed<br/>
the intrusion of Christian<br/>
warriors: Roger of Sicily<br/>
in 1165, others in 1217.<br/>
St. Louis in 1248. All<br/>
these attacks were followed by sieges and disasters, and finally rest<br/>
from such incursions. The<br/>
Arabs destroyed the<br/>
ancient city and rebuilt<br/>
it five miles from its<br/>
ancient site.<br/>
<br/>
LAKE MENZALEH<br/>
<br/>
Lake Menzaleh, the<br/>
largest lake in Egypt (165<br/>
miles in circumference), is<br/>
accessible from any station between Kantarah and Port Said<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-or </span>from Port Said itself, and again on the other side from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh</span>, a fair-sized village which has just<br/>
suffered severely from a fire (April 1907), is the termination of the "Basse Egypte <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Light Railway, which starts<br/>
from Mansourah.<br/>
<br/>
The lake is shallow, and is largely fed by the Nile. In<br/>
flood time the whole of what was the Pelusian Plain is under<br/>
water. The lake is remarkable for the myriads of birds of<br/>
