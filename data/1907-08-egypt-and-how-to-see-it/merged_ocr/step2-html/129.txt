<span>ALEXANDRIA<br/>
<br/>
but, for those who prefer a quieter life, very pleasant. In<br/>
front is the sea, and behind there is a pretty garden with<br/>
shady trees and a tennis <span style="color: #0000FF;">court<br/>
<br/>
</span>Other hotels that can be recommended are the New<br/>
Victoria and the Carlton.<br/>
They are both close to the<br/>
tramway and rather nearer<br/>
the town. Full particulars<br/>
of the hotels, <span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">c.</span>, at Alexandria and Ramleh are<br/>
given on pages 159-161.<br/>
<br/>
Villas at Ramleh, surrounded by pretty gardens<br/>
and near the sea, can be<br/>
rented for longer or shorter<br/>
periods. The neighbourhood is charming, and the<br/>
air fresh and cool. It is<br/>
a great resort in summer,<br/>
and a godsend to the jaded<br/>
officials who cannot escape<br/>
to England during the<br/>
heat.<br/>
<br/>
It is necessary to give a<br/>
note of warning to bathers.<br/>
Although the bathing is<br/>
perfectly safe all along the<br/>
coast, it is not advisable<br/>
to swim far from the shore<br/>
without a boat, as there<br/>
are sometimes powerful currents. There have been several fatalities, and it is not safe<br/>
for even strong swimmers to venture out too far alone.<br/>

ALEXANDRIA'S EARLY HISTORY<br/>
<br/>
Historically Alexandria has no very ancient interest. It<br/>
was founded by Alexander the Great of Macedon and developed by Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sober</span>. The latter founded the museum<br/>
and the great library<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>among whose keepers are such names<br/>
as Aristophanes of Byzantium and Eratosthenes of Cyrene.<br/>
Callimachus the poet arranged and labelled the 400,000<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">129<br/>
<br/>
