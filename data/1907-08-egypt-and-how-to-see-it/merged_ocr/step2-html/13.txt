RAILWAY ARRANGEMENTS<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Many </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">pe0ple </span>are surprised when they come to Egypt to<br/>
find a railway system which can compare in most particulars<br/>
with those of Europe and America. There are some 1500<br/>
miles of railway, with about 270 stations, under State management, besides a large number of light railways.<br/>
<br/>
The most important trains are composed of large <span style="color: #ff0000;">doublebogie </span>corridor carriages of the latest design, lighted by electricity or <span style="color: #0000FF;">gas </span>On all the principal expresses dining- or<br/>
luncheon-cars are provided, and for the longer journeys<br/>
sleeping-cars; these are of the well-known type used all<br/>
over Europe, and are run under an arrangement with the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Wagon-Lits </span>Company.<br/>
<br/>
There are three classes of carriages<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the thirds, however,<br/>
are somewhat <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>from those in England, and it is very<br/>
unusual to see a European travelling third class. Fares are,<br/>
on the whole, considerably cheaper than those of English<br/>
railways. A short journey costs more in proportion than <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>long one. The second-class fare is half the first-class, and<br/>
the third half the second.<br/>
<br/>
Return tickets are not issued at present<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>except on one or<br/>
two of the suburban lines. No luggage is carried free, except<br/>
that which is taken by the passenger into the carriage.<br/>
Special trains, saloons, and the conveyance of carriages or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">motor-cam </span>can be arranged for at short notice; particulars<br/>
on these points are given on page 197.<br/>
