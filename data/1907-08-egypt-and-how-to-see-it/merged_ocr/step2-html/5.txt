<span>PREFACE<br/>
<br/>
THE present book is not designed to supplant the many<br/>
existing guide-books on Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">nor-though </span>every effort has<br/>
been made to ensure <span style="color: #0000FF;">accuracy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">does </span>it purport to serve as an<br/>
infallible book of reference to archaeologists. Its object is,<br/>
rather, to aid the visitors to this country by indicating that<br/>
which is most worth seeing, where they should go, and how<br/>
they may <span style="color: #ff0000;">economise </span>time, money, and fatigue to the greatest<br/>
advantage.<br/>
<br/>
Cairo and Alexandria, Upper Egypt, the Fayoum, and<br/>
Lower Egypt are dealt with chapter by chapter, and their<br/>
interests, characteristics, and chief features presented.<br/>
<br/>
To the text are added appendices giving detailed and<br/>
practical information of every kind<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>these have been made<br/>
as complete as possible. Time- tables and similar particulars,<br/>
which vary from time to time are <span style="color: #0000FF;">arranged</span>" so as <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ajpply<br/>
