<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
progress has been made towards the restoration of those <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>greatest interest.<br/>
<br/>
To obtain admission the visitor must be provided with<br/>
tickets, costing 2 pt. each, and obtainable at the hotels,<br/>
tourist agencies, Post Office, or at the mosques themselves.<br/>
<br/>
All visitors have to put on large Arab slippers (provided at the mosques) over their <span style="color: #0000FF;">boots </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-a </span>compromise<br/>
with the Moslem injunction to take off shoes or boots before<br/>
entering.<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of convenience, we may divide into two groups<br/>
those mosques which, from their antiquity or other associations connected with them, are most worthy of a visit:<br/>
(1) those in the neighbourhood of the Citadel, and (2) those<br/>
situated in or about the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mousky </span>quarter. Those of the first<br/>
category can be visited in the morning, and the others in the<br/>
afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
The Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Human</span>, situated close to the Citadel, is a<br/>
fourteenth-century mosque of vast dimensions. The massive<br/>
gateway is 85 ft. high, with a stalactite domed roof. Inside<br/>
is the vestibule, which, as the mosque is at present undergoing restoration, is used as a place of worship. The work of<br/>
restoration will be very thorough, and is expected to take<br/>
two years to complete. The court is 115 ft. long and 105 ft.<br/>
broad, and has a large fountain in the centre. It is cruciform<br/>
in shape, the arms of the cross being formed by four large<br/>
recesses, which were reserved for the four sects of Islam.<br/>
The arches of these recesses are very fine, especially that<br/>
towards the east, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">span </span>of which is 70 ft. Under this is<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dikkeh</span>, or reading-desk, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">behind </span>that the kibla, or<br/>
praying niche<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>ornamented with various inlaid marbles. To<br/>
the right of the kibla is the nimbar, or pulpit. A door to<br/>
the left leads to the mausoleum, in the centre of which is<br/>
the tomb of the founder of the mosque.<br/>
<br/>
To the left, immediately on entering the courtyard, there<br/>
is a doorway leading into a <span style="color: #0000FF;">madrassah</span>, or school, containing<br/>
365 rooms, formerly occupied by students. The top stone of<br/>
this doorway is formed of eleven pieces of black and white<br/>
marble dovetailed together. The south minaret is the highest<br/>
in Cairo (280 ft.).<br/>
<br/>
The building has at various times served as a fortress, and<br/>
lodged in the outer walls may be seen cannon-balls which the<br/>
French fired from the Citadel.<br/>
<br/>
The unfinished mosque opposite is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rifaiya</span>, containing<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">32<br/>
<br/>
