GENERAL INFORMATION<br/>
<br/>
THE best months for Egypt are from October to May. The<br/>
weather is delightful all through, save for a very few days.<br/>
In the worst years, indeed, one may possibly count ten days<br/>
that are not quite perfect, but a few showers, one or two<br/>
days of rain, and perhaps one day of rather hot wind and<br/>
dust in April are all one need expect. The rest is sunshine<br/>
and warmth such as even the Riviera cannot afford.<br/>
<br/>
Of routes there is a very wide choice: one can go by long<br/>
sea, which takes from twelve to fifteen days and is certainly<br/>
cheapest, or one may go from Marseilles, Genoa, Naples,<br/>
Venice, Trieste, Brindisi, or Constantinople. The shortest<br/>
route is, of course, <span style="color: #0000FF;">via </span>Brindisi, and takes four and a half<br/>
days. Full particulars are given on page <span style="color: #0000FF;">PAN</span>.<br/>
<br/>
It is as well to <span style="color: #0000FF;">secure </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>passage early, as, especially in the<br/>
late autumn, the boats may be crowded. One may note here<br/>
that it is almost always possible to secure <span style="color: #0000FF;">a-.place </span>in the<br/>
P. <span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span>O. Brindisi Mail Express, even at the last moment.<br/>
<br/>
As to clothes and general equipment, no very special<br/>
measures need be taken. Ordinary English summer clothing<br/>
