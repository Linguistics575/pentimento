<span>CHAPTER II<br/>
CAIRO<br/>
<br/>
As the train comes to a standstill in Cairo station the visitor<br/>
is besieged by a crowd of hotel porters, but this need cause<br/>
no annoyance. If rooms have been engaged previously, all<br/>
that is necessary is to pick out the representative of the<br/>
particular hotel chosen. He will take charge of the luggage<br/>
and lead the way to the hotel omnibus outside.<br/>
<br/>
First to be considered are the hotels. Driving from the<br/>
station<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>one reaches "Shepheard's "in a few minutes; then<br/>
just beyond it is the Continental. Turn to the right and<br/>
you pass the Angleterre, then, going towards Kasr-el-Nil,<br/>
the National and the Savoy. On the river-bank, just to<br/>
the south of the bridge, is the new Semiramis, in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr-elDoubara</span>, a great quarter for the wealthy residents. If<br/>
you go over the bridge, and to the right hand, you reach<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>Palace and its garden. Here also are the<br/>
fashionable villas.<br/>
<br/>
There are several other hotels, more economical, but quite<br/>
comfortable: the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Metropole</span>, Eden Palace, New Khedivial,<br/>
and Bristol. There are, too, plenty of pensions: the<br/>
Imperial, Carlton House, Villa Victoria, Rossmore House,<br/>
Pension Sima--to mention a few only. It is also possible<br/>
to hire a furnished flat for the winter; so there is no lack of<br/>
choice where to stay.<br/>
<br/>
The Savoy is perhaps the premier hotel, situated at<br/>
the corner of Kasr-el-Nil and Suliman Pasha streets, a very<br/>
pleasant part of the town. It is a favourite rendez-vous of<br/>
Cairo rank and fashion. The restaurant, for which the hotel<br/>
is noted, is always crowded with smart diners-out during the<br/>
winter. The Savoy Saturday night dances are among the<br/>
most popular events of the Cairo season.<br/>
<br/>
"Shepheard's "is famous all over the world, and hardly<br/>
needs recommendation; it always maintains its well-deserved<br/>
popularity. The hotel is situated not far from the station,<br/>
in the principal street of the town. In front there is a fine<br/>
