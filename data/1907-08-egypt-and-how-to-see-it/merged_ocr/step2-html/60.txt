<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
these are, however, frequently crowded with excursionists.<br/>
A very pleasant private picnic can be arranged by chartering<br/>
for the day a motor- launch from Messrs. E. P. Blattner and<br/>
Co. Telephone No. 443 Cairo. The charge is <span style="color: #ff0000;">LE4 </span>per<br/>
day, and the boat holds twelve <span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>comfortably. The<br/>
river trip takes about two <span style="color: #ff0000;">hours..<br/>
<br/>
</span>From the Barrage station there is a trolley line which goes<br/>
through all the gardens and to all the weirs. This is a novel<br/>
and pleasing method of progression: the trolleys hold four<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>(more comfortably two), and are pushed by two<br/>
Arab <span style="color: #0000FF;">boys </span>The fares are:<br/>
<br/>
Pt<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>From the station to the central canal and back <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
<br/>

The Nile, which formerly entered the sea through seven<br/>
mouths, has now but <span style="color: #0000FF;">two-the </span>Damietta and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rosetta<br/>
</span>branches<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>these diverge <span style="color: #0000FF;">northeast </span>and north- west respectively, from a point a short distance north of Cairo. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Just<br/>
</span>below the point of divergence the barrage is built across<br/>
both branches<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>its object is to hold up the level of the water<br/>
in the Nile so as to allow it to enter three great <span style="color: #0000FF;">canals-the<br/>
</span>Rayah (canal) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewfikieh</span>, Rayah <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menufieh</span>, and Rayah<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Behira</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>commence at this point. They provide water<br/>
for, and allow of navigation to, almost all parts of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Delta<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Barrage Was one of the great experiments <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Moha <span style="color: #ff0000;">mmed<br/>
</span>Aly. The plans were drawn up by Mougel Bey <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>1835, it<br/>
took twenty years to build and cost <span style="color: #0000FF;">2800,000</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>On completion, however, it was found that the foundations would<br/>
not hold owing to the shifting nature of the soil. The works<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">remained-a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">costlyiailure-until </span>in 1885 strengthening opera<br/>
