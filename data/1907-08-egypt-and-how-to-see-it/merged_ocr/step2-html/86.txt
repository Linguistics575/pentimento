<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is best to engage a guide for the temples and tombs.<br/>
There are quite a number of reliable men, and the selection<br/>
can be made through the hotel. The charge is from 20 pt.<br/>
to 30 pt. per day; arrangements can be made for longer<br/>
periods.<br/>
<br/>
There are excellent donkeys for hire. The best course is<br/>
to select one and keep it throughout one's stay. The charge<br/>
per day is 10 pt., but the donkey-boy will expect a piastre or<br/>
two <span style="color: #ff0000;">balcshish</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes-East </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bank.-0n </span>the near or east side of the river<br/>
there are two places of special <span style="color: #0000FF;">interest-the </span>temple of Luxor,<br/>
in the village, two minutes' walk from the hotels, and Karnak.<br/>
about a mile and a half to the north.<br/>

THE TEMPLE OF LUXOR<br/>
<br/>
The temple of Luxor was built by several successive kings<br/>
at different periods, and dedicated to Amen and his wife<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">son-Mat </span>and Khons. The principal builders were<br/>
Amenhotep III. of the eighteenth, and Rameses II. of the<br/>
nineteenth dynasties. The former built the temple proper,<br/>
and the latter added the court and pylon on the north. The<br/>
great colonnade was built under <span style="color: #ff0000;">Harmhabi</span>. The original<br/>
entrance to the temple was through the centre of the north<br/>
pylon. On either side is a colossal seated statue of Rameses.<br/>
In front of these were two obelisks of red granite; one of<br/>
them is still in its place, but the other has been removed<br/>
and erected in the Place de la Concorde in Paris. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
walls of the pylon are reliefs representing Rameses defeating<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khita </span>(Hittites) at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kadesh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the pylon is the great court of Rameses II.;<br/>
this was surrounded by a double row of columns. In the<br/>
north-west corner, near the pylon, is a small temple built by<br/>
Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, earlier than the great temple inside which<br/>
it stands. On the south-west wall of this court is a representation of the temple of Luxor as it appeared in its day<br/>
-a most interesting memorial. To the south is a lofty<br/>
colonnade of fourteen columns with calyx capitals in two<br/>
rows. These columns are over forty feet high, and give a<br/>
most impressive aspect to the whole structure, seen from<br/>
the river.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond is the hypostyle hall, containing thirty-two papyrus<br/>
