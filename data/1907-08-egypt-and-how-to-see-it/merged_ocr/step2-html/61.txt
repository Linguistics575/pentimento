<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tions </span>were undertaken by Sir Colin Scott <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moncrieff</span>, which were<br/>
completed in 1890 at a further cost of Â£460,000, and have<br/>
been entirely successful.<br/>
<br/>
The various works are built of a reddish yellow sandstone<br/>
of pleasing colour, and are in Norman style with castellated<br/>
towers at intervals. These, though unusual enough in such<br/>
surroundings, have in the distance a most attractive appearance against the trees. The triangle of ground formed by<br/>
the two branches of the Nile was once fortified, but has since<br/>
been laid out in gardens.<br/>
<br/>
The trees and the gardens are the great feature of the<br/>
Barrage: perfect lawns, trees, shrubs, flowers of all kinds,<br/>
a delightful narrow pond passing beneath a wooden bridge<br/>
and covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-lilies-all </span>is a most attractive contrast<br/>
to the usual Egyptian scenery. One may well wander all<br/>
day and never tire of it; and the ordinary Egyptian scenes<br/>
are all the more appreciated for the very contrast. An<br/>
afternoon, a whole day, or a long evening can be spent there,<br/>
as one pleases. Only provisions should be taken; a luncheon- plus tea-basket is here, as everywhere in Egypt, the<br/>
real solution of the question. One may choose some charming spot in the gardens, under trees, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>lawn; or<br/>
in one of the Norman towers, where a room exists for such<br/>
purposes, chairs and tables and an attendant who supplies<br/>
water for the tea, washes up the things, and generally makes<br/>
himself <span style="color: #0000FF;">useful-all </span>these things are provided.<br/>
<br/>
One thing should be <span style="color: #0000FF;">remembered-the </span>gardens are far<br/>
cooler than Cairo (perhaps their chief attraction is the absence of heat, dust, and glare), and it is apt to be distinctly<br/>
chilly at night. Wraps and <span style="color: #0000FF;">goats </span>should be taken, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>more so as the Barrage is almost at its best after sunset<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
