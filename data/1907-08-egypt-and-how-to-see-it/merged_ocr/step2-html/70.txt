<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
The train is a fast and luxurious substitute. Every <span style="color: #0000FF;">night<br/>
</span>through the season the trains de luxe run between Cairo<br/>
and Luxor; they are made up of dining- and sleeping-cars<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>and only carry first-class passengers. These trains are really<br/>
as excellent as any in the world; they do not tear along and<br/>
shake the life out of the luckless passengers as do the vaunted<br/>
Riviera "flyers." The cars cannot be surpassed. They<br/>
have a double roof to preserve an even temperature, double<br/>
windows that keep out dust and <span style="color: #ff0000;">cinders</span>; and, of course,<br/>
electric fans, ice, and any and everything one can wish for is<br/>
carried. Their great length and width ensures steady and<br/>
smooth running, so that one can sleep well all through the<br/>
journey.<br/>
<br/>
The trains from Cairo and Luxor respectively leave at<br/>
6.30 P.M., and dinner (price 25 pt.) is served at 7.30 P.M.<br/>
At the beginning and end of the season the "Trains de <span style="color: #ff0000;">Luxe </span>"<br/>
do not run, and a sleeping- and dining-car are put on to the<br/>
8 RM. from Cairo and the 5.30 P.M. from Luxor, three times<br/>
a week, in each direction.<br/>
<br/>
It <span style="color: #0000FF;">15 </span>as well to secure berths through the Wagons- Lits<br/>
Company's offices in Cairo and the principal stations, or<br/>
through the tourist agencies.<br/>
<br/>
Those who wish to get some impression of the country,<br/>
and who do not mind a long journey by day, can leave Cairo<br/>
at 8.30 A.M., or Luxor at 7.0 A.M., and they will reach their<br/>
destination the same evening. They should, however, take<br/>
a luncheon-basket with them.<br/>
<br/>
The best months are from November to March, before and<br/>
after which periods the heat is rather too much for many<br/>
people. But if one cares to brave it, and owing to the purity<br/>
and dryness of the air it is not really so very trying, one<br/>
should go south in October; then Egypt presents her greatest<br/>
wonder, for the "Nile <span style="color: #ff0000;">overfloweth </span>all his banks," and the<br/>
world is one vast sheet of water from the railway to the hills.<br/>
The sunset fires it to a marvel of flame that fades to deep<br/>
red, then rose, at last steely black under the starlight.<br/>
Here and there a causeway cleaves the flood, a village<br/>
stands out, a group of palm-trees rise. The desert hills take<br/>
wonderful colours under the changing light.<br/>
<br/>
People who know no Arabic will probably need a dragoman<br/>
or guide. It is, perhaps, best to engage one on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">spot</span>, and<br/>
not to take men from Cairo. The local guides know their<br/>
work and their monuments much better; besides, a strange<br/>
