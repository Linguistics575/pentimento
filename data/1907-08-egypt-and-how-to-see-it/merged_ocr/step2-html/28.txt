<span>EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT<br/>
<br/>
meetings are almost always crowded. The totalisator is in<br/>
use (<span style="color: #0000FF;">pari </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mutual</span>), and tickets on the horses can be taken<br/>
for LEI, or by less wealthy backers for 20 pt. As the principle<br/>
of payment is the division of receipts<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>less the percentage due<br/>
to the totalisator (which goes to the funds of the racing club),<br/>
one's winnings vary. A favourite whom every one supports<br/>
may not even pay back his full dollar, and outsiders backed<br/>
by a few only have been known to pay 60 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. Visitors can<br/>
become temporary members if introduced <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>member of the<br/>
club; they should apply to the secretary. For subscription<br/>
and entrance to the grand stand on race days see page 164.<br/>

<br/>
The Zoological Gardens, a great resort of fashionable Cairo<br/>
on Sunday afternoons, are at Gizeh, close to the plantations.<br/>

collection of <span style="color: #0000FF;">animals-about </span>a thousand <span style="color: #0000FF;">specimens-is </span>very<br/>

just be seen through the trees on the right-hand side of the<br/>

one large mound ablaze with <span style="color: #0000FF;">geraniums </span>of all sorts and<br/>
hues, a perfect mass of colour through the dark foliage<br/>
and stems. The Aquarium contains a quantity of different<br/>
varieties of Nile fish. It is open daily from 8.30 A.M. till<br/>
