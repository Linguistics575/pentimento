ISMAILIA TO SUEZ



From Ismailia station the road leads straight to the lake,
down the avenue that crosses the canal. There one may
well pause at the bridge. The bank is a mass of eolour----
red, orange. white, and blue flowers. Below, the boats
lounge past under the trees.

Everything is lazy and peaceful, bathed in warm sunlight.
Here and there, down the road. appear neat small houses---
bungalows, rather; their verandahs, that tell of easy-going,
outdoor life, are gay with many-coloured creepers. Here
are no Arab huts, no strenuous shops, nothing but acclima-
tised quiet.

Then comes the lake-vivid, deep blue. The far-off Asian
-bank is vivid golden sand, against which stands out the
least mark, shrubs or stumps of black wood. Even the
steamers, passing up and down, appear black in the keen
sunlight. It is all restful, full of calm light and colour.

ISMAILIA TO SUEZ

The journey takes about two hours, through desert land
all the way. Bordering the line are stretches of marsh. To
the right are the hills, red- brown; to the left the Canal.
One can only see the canal momentarily where it appears,
blue as the curved blade of a Damascus sword. The only
sign of the waterway is the mast or funnel of some ship
gliding slow 1y from station to station.

The wind blows keen, clean, and increasing across the
