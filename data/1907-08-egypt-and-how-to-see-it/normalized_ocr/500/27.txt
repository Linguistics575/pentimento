CAIRO

Opera Square; to the right hand are shops, opposite them the
Opera House, and to the left the railed-in Esbekieh Gardens;
straight on is the wide Midan Abdin, close to Abdin Palace.
Four main streets lead to the right from the square: the
Boulac road, just before the Continental Hotel, as yet
rather a dingy, tram-haunted street, though it will be fine
enough in four or five years' time, when the Boulac-Ghezireh
bridge is built; the Sharia-el-Magraby, wherein is the Angle-
terre Hotel and also the Turf Club-a fine, open street; then
the Sharia-el-Manakh, the Bond Street of Cairo; and the
. Sharia Kasr-el-Nil, which leads to the Savoy Hotel.

One may go to the Kasr-el-Nil Bridge and look up the
river. The Semiramis, the British Agency, and other great
houses line thebank; down stream are the barracks, followed
by the quaint, native buildings of the Boulac quarter, and
a mile or so away is the Embabeh railway bridge. The island
of Ghezireh consists practically of the Sporting Club grounds,
and the quarter where are all the villas, to the north. -, All
the afternoon and evening smart carriages and motor-cars
career round it, and strings of polo ponies pass to and from
the polo ground. The road straight on from the bridge
and then to the left is one long avenue all the way to Gizeh,
and thence to Mena House and the Pyramids.



The Kasr-el-Nil bridge, which connects Cairo with Ghezireh,
is opened every day from 1.30 RM. to 3 RM. to allow the
boats to pass up and down. At that hour it is impossible to
cross the bridge, and the only way to get to Ghezireh is by
ferry (see page 199).

The various interests on the Ghezireh side of the river
are the Khedivial Sporting Club, the Aquarium and Grotto,
the. Zoological Gardens, and the Public Works Department
plantations. These last are well kept, and have many
beautiful trees and shrubs.

KHEDIVIAL SPORTING CLUB

The Khedivial Sporting Club is the great resort of the
English, and most of the European colony. It has a twelve..
hole golf course, twelve asphalt tennis-courts, several squash
racquet courts, polo grounds and croquet lawns, and a race-
course (flat and for steeplechasing). There is an excellent
grandstand, and paddock with a quantity of stalls. The race
