EGYPT. AN!) HOW TO-SEE IT



line. At last come fields, trees, houses, and then Suez (Suez
Town )----" dusty old town, stretching in untidy detachments
down to the Bea.

The train passes through the town and comes out upon a
long causeway leading to Suez Docks.

Round the docks is a small town in itself, and the cleanest.
pleasantest part of Suez. Here are the Canal Co.'s and other
offices, with the houses of the officials facing a shady boule-
vard. In front passes the ceaseless stream of shipping,
entering and leaving the Canal.

Look seaward. The anchorage is bounded on the right
by the high red cliffs of Gebel Attakah; on either side the
more distant hills tail off, grey-blue, towards the open Bea,
where runs the road to India and the Far East.

There are two small hotels, the H6tel Bachet and th"
HÃ©tel Bel-Air, but few people stay in Suez unless com-
pelled by the exigencies of travel.

THE SUEZ CANAL

The Canal by day is not profoundly exciting. The pro
gress is slow, the scenery unvaried. One should start in the
late afternoon, and take advantage of the night-time. For
the night reveals the one feature of the voyage at its best-
the Bitter Lakes. After a slow and toilsome journey through
the narrow passage, the ship emerges suddenly into the
open. The searchlight plays full, brilliant, on the depth of
dark sky and water.

Myriad white shapes appear ahead, flitting, dipping.
skimming, nearing the boat, then retreating, resting on the
water, quitting it, with slow-flapping wings. When thev
are quite close, under full play of the light, you can see that
they are pelicans, with their wide wings, long beak, and
pouch beneath. As they pass under the ray they appear as
tongues of flame, transparent, mysterious, against the bright
darkness of the water.

Here the ships do not stop to exchange courtesies or com-
bat precedence for tying up. A big P. and 0., or along. lean
German Lloyd sheers past almost at full speed, ablaze with
light. The pilot-boat hangs on for dear life, while the pilot
ascends or descends the ladder like a trained acrobat. At
length one's own boat makes the entrance, and from the
Bitter Lakes the Canal 1s placid, narrow, and uneventful as far
as Port Said.
