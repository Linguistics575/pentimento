EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT



The smooth surface was covered with sculptures and in-
scriptions.

The chambers and passages inside had their special uses
as sepulchres, and were finally closed when the king for
whom they were built had been entombed. There used to
be a temple close to each Pyramid, devoted to the honour of
the monarch.

The Great Pyramid can be climbed'. it is an exertion. and
though the view is fine, it is quite what one expects from any
high point. Ascent by proxy is, however, quite easy and
costs a few piastres: the Arab boys are always ready to
compete therein.

The Great Pyramid was opened by Caliph El-Mamoun in
820 A. D. on the chance of finding treasure, but the entrance
his men made is now blocked up. The present entrance is
about 40 ft. from the base. A great vaulted gallery leads
down to the subterranean chamber, 90 ft. below the base and
347 ft. from the entrance; it is 11 ft. high and measures
46 by 27 ft. Mariette claimed that this was a false chamber,
intended to divert the attention of any one entering from
the real tomb. An upward passage leads towards the centre.
and is the approach to the "Queen's Chamber'. (18 ft. by
17 and 20 ft. high). Mariette considers that here also the
passage to the great gallery was closed, so that those who
reached this point might suppose they had seen all the
Pyramid held, The great gallery is 151 ft. long, 7 ft. wide,
and 29 ft. high; it leads to the King's Chamber (34 ft. by 17
and 19 ft. high), in which are the remains of a red granite
sarcophagus.

There is much argument about these Pyramids: some
even consider that they had some strange metrical and
dimensional object. But however their dimensions may
have been devised, the consensus of opinion is that they are
tombs: for that matter the Pyramid may be a monument
to the king's learning as well as a resting-place for his body.

The smallest Pyramid, that of Mycerinus, is said, in
one legend, to have been built by one of the princesses on
doubtfully acquired resources; another myth assigns it to
Rhodopis, but Mycerinus was the real builder. He it is to
whom it was revealed by the gods that he had but six years
to live, but it is said that he doubled the period by turning
day into night.
