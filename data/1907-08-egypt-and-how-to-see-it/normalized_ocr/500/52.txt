EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

whole road is level; on either side is a long plain, in early
winter a vast sheet of water as far as the eye can reach, one
rose-red expanse at sunset, on which quiver the huge tri-
angular shadows of the Pyramids. Later, the water passes
off, and in a month or two all is one wide sea of verdure.

The road is Isrnail's creation, built in an incredibly short
space of time. It is the finest road in the country. The
long avenue of Lebbek trees is crowded with cabs, carriages,
motor-cars, native carts, strings of camels, and a. few stray
cyclists of equally strange nationality and dress. Between
the trees, as the tram Ries along, one is suddenly aware of
those great shapes-sharp, grey-red, rigid above the rough
desert cliff. Little black specks move to and fro at their
base-c-people already exploring and sight-seeing.

A crowd of White-robed donkey-boys and dragomans hover
round the tram as it arrives. The hotel is a few yards off
to the right hand. After seeing the Pyramids and the
Sphinx, one may stop and have lunch, or tea on the verandah,
before returning to Cairo.

The road curves up the hill to the Pyramids. There is no
escape from these great monuments. They stand silent
above everything. They appear, faint blue shapes of sharp
outline from Galioub as the train approaches Cairo, from
Matarieh, from the Ghezireh club grounds above the tree-
tops, from any and every point of clear westward view in
Cairo.

Their size alone and their form remains. Stripped of their
brilliant white smooth casing, once covered with strange
carvings and paintings, bereft of the huge precincts and
stone gateways, they appear barbarous, rude, rugged, almost
meaningless, shapes of forgotten power. And the Sphinx is
more wonderful, more mysterious still, Horemku the ancient.
No one can tell when the Sphinx came into being. There is a
legend that it was in existence at the time when Chephren
built his Pyramid. Thothmes IV. cleared away the sand in
which it was buried, at the command-wives, in a dream-of
Harmachis, who claimed that it was his statue. Probably
a far greater antiquity belongs to it, .for Princess Honitsen,
daughter of Cheops (builder of the Great Pyramid) speaks,
in an inscription on a stele, of a "Temple of the Sphinx "
as existing in her day. The following is a translation t
