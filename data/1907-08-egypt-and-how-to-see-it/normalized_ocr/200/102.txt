EGYPT. AND HOW TO SEE IT

A staircase of 242 steps and fourteen stages leads to the
platform of the pylon, and one can ascend by a corridor on
to the roof of the portico. In the front of the pylon there
are four recesses which formerly held the huge Ggstafis
which were the feature of every Egyptian temple. An
inscription asserts that these were also used as lightning
conductors. It is a wonderful temple. irfa wonderful state
of preservation.



After Edfou for some miles the railway winds round the
face of the elifis, high above the Nile. One of these is crowned
by the ruins of ELSin-ag, a Roman fortress. After Kagoug
the line crosses the wide plain of Kom Ombo. Only three
years ago this was arid desert, but now, through the enters
prise of Sir Ernest Cassel, as far as the eye can reach are
green crops and evidence of a thriving community.

The next station, Daraw, is a fair-sized town; it is the
srartinppoh1t of the camel route to Berber and the Sudan.
As the train stops one is besieged by native sellers of fans
and other articles of Sudanese manufacture.

THE TEMPLE OF KOM 0MBO

Donkeys (price 8 pt. to 10 pt.) can be obtained at Daraw
for the excursion to the temple of Sebek and Horus. Aride
of an hour and a half brings one to the site of the ancient
town-of importance in the time of the Ptolemies.

The temple is on the edge of the Nile. Half (the right-hand
side) is dedicated to the erocodile-gud Sebek. and the left-
hand side to Horus. The pylon in front is partly destroyed.
Of the columns in the court beyond, onlv half their height
remains. but what is left is finely painted and in good pre-
servation. After the court is the great hypostyle hall. The
roof has fallen, but its position is defined by two rows of
richly decorated pillars with palm-leaf capitals.

. To the right of the north gateway is a finely worked relief
of the king, Neos Dionysius, receiving the benediction of a
lion-headed Isis and other gods, in the presence of Horus.

The small hypostyle hall has also two rows of pillars; on
the shafts are pictures of Euergetes sstsriiieing to the gods.
On the left wall (north-west) is a splendid relief of Horus
offering a curious. curved. siekle-shaped sword to Euergetes
IL Behind the king are his sister Cleopatra and his wife.
