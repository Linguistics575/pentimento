Ptah was incarnate in the Apis bulls, who were first wor-
shipped, then drowned in the sacred lake, embalmed, and
finally buried in the magaifieent granite sarcophagi of the
Apis Tombs.

The first objects of interest after leaving the station are
the Colossi of Rameses IL: these formerly marked the
entrance to a temple. The first, made of granite, lies pros-
trate; its length with the crown, which has fallen off. is
over 30 ft. The second colossus is of limestone, 42 ft. high;
it stands in an enclosure "pt. is charged to enter, unless
one has a general pass). The foundations of the temple of
Ptah can be Been a little to the north.

From this point it is about an hour's ride to the Step
Pyramid. This is the tomb of King Zoser (third dynasty),
older: than the Gizeh Pyramids; unlike them, it is built
in six stages or steps. It is about 200 ft. high. A little to
the south-west is the Pyramid of Unas, a king of the fifth
dynasty. The walls of the tomb chamber are covered with
coloured hierzoglyphies which are among the oldest that
have been found.

Mariette was the famous French Egyptologist who discovered
the Apia Tombs m 1851, and afterwards became Director of
Antiquities to the Egyptian Government (1857-1881).

A few minutes distant are the tombs of the Apis bulls or
Sempeum; there are nearly four hundred yards of vaulted
subterranean passages with niches at intervals in which are
the granite sarcophagi of the bulls. Twenty-four of these
are still in position; they are out from a single block of
granite, and weigh sixty or seventy tons. The following
extract from Mariette's report on his discovery may be
interesting:



rr I confess that when I penetrated for the first time, on
November 12, 1851, into the Apis vaults, I was so profoundly
struck with astonishment that the feeling 15 still fresh in my
mind, although five years have elapsed since then. Owing
to some chance which it is difficult to account for, a chamber
which had been walled up in the thirtieth year of the reign
of Rameses II. had escaped the notice of the plunderers of
the vaults, and I was no fortunate as to find it untouched.

thing in the chamber seemed to be precisely in its original
