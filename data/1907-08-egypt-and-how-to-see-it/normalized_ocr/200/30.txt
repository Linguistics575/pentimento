EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

Italian opera, grand, and light, and French opera buuje have
met with success worthy of the management. It can hold
nearly twelve hundred people, and is not uncomfortable. It
is, however, more or less of a temporary nature. All Cairo
is hoping for a grand new theatre, plans for Which are being
studied.

There is in the Ezhekieh Gardens a small theatre, where
light French plays are from time to time given (though operas
have been attempted also). Occasionally these are really
amusing and well acted, though they are naturally of the
"Capucines "order-vt_illes end farces.

There is an Arab theatre in the Ezbekieh quarter, where
Arabic (and, be it said, rather weird) versions of Shakespeare
are given, and there are sundry Arab music-halls, where the
more curious can see native dancing and hear native singing.



THE BAZAARS

The native bazaars are a great institution. They are
situated in or near the Mousky, which is the original
and oldest commercial street in Cairo-narrow, crowded,
picturesque, and quite unlike any other thoroughfare in the
city. People of all nationalities and in every sort of clothing
pass up and down, or in and out of the big wholesale shops.

About half a mile up the Mousky (beyond the tram crossing)
there is a turning on the left; in this are the booths of gold-
smiths, smell native jewellers, and, further down, copper
vendors. About a hundred yards along this side-street is a.
turning on the right called the Khan Khalil; this is the
Turkish bazaar-the best of all the bazaars. The Khan
Khalil is very narrow, and parts of it are covered in; its
devious paths lead past shops of every kind-iewe1lens, carpet-
sellers,'shawl-sellers, amber merchants, brass and Copper
smiths, Indian and Persian vendors of every and any kind of
eurio or ornament. Of course one can hard) hope to pick
up treasures. Far too many keen dealers are exploited
Cairo at various times to leave any really precious "finds."
But one lean-often at quite a. reasonable pritxs--bay charm-
ing tnrquoises, peridots, and other stones. There are quan-
tities of fine carpets and praying-mats, swords, spears,
mrbuge (Soudanese rhinoceros-hide whips). As all the wares
are exposed to the fullest possible view, it is worth passing
through the bazaars. if only to see so motley an exhibition.
