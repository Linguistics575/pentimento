EGYPT, AND HOW TO SER IT



FACOUS

Facous is a fertile centre of palm-groves that branch off
to the East and South above small canals. and villages with
quaint winding mud walls, along which the women pass
blue-gowned, their great water-jars on their heads. The big
canal, Bahr Facous. divides into three or four other canals
that range through moderately fertile land and eventually



At Famns

lose themselves in that semi-Waste end-of-the-world country
so characteristic of certain parts of the Delta. The line
past Azazi and Ekiad to 8alhieh is a very avenue of palms;
the permanent way is the high-road for choice. Salhieh is
the end of all things, a palm-grove bounded by desert.
whence one can see almost to Kantarah and the Suez Canal.

DAMIETTA

It is rather a far cly to Damietta, but it can be seen in a
day, and one need not spend any great length of time there.
Besides, the journey itself by Tantah and Mansourah is
interesting to any one who really wishes to have an impression
of the Delta. 122
