EGYPT. AND HOW TO SEE IT



about 4500 acres ot land under cultivation at present. The
principal trade is in dates; there are some 70.000 date-palms,
and the fruit is better then that grown anywhere in Egypt.

The principal ancient Egyptian remains are the temple
of Hibis (mc. 521), in which is inscribed an interesting hymn
to the sun-god. At Nadam. near the modern capital. are
three temples, one of the time of Ptolemy III. (u.c. 240)
and the other two of the time of Antoninus Pius (150 A o.).
There are the remains. also, of Roman Wntch-tnwem and
forts. a circular hriek-kiln and tombs, probably of the third
and fourth centuries of the Christian em. Near Ein Tabashir
are some curious buildings with tiny cuhicel recesses (eight
inches across), whirl mev have been dovecots.

of no great interest. Sulimu. it is true, was an important
station on the caravan route for the slave and other trades
from East and Central Africa through all the cases to Morocco.

The Wady Natroun, or Nation Valley, is hardly an oasis.
as them is little or no cultivation. The valley-about
twentv miles long-has several small salt lake; and is remark-
able for its alkaline deposits, which furnish salt. sulphate
and carbonate of soda, and similar products. The Wady-
Natroun has considerable antiquarian interest, and is com-
paratively easy of access, being but a few hours from Cairo.

There used to be a town in the middle of the valley-a
large settlement of Christian monks. St. Mecurius. the
Egyptian, was the pioneer of these recluses. to the number
of some 5000, as well as 600 desert tu1ehorites He is

The Natron Valley and its monasteries have been visited
by many travellers ever since Egidus Lochiensis in 1633.
and great stores of manuscripts have been recovered there-
from. They must have been veritable treasuries, espeeisily

Monasteries in the Levant," by the Hon. R. Curzon, who
