PREFACE

THE present book is not designed to supplant the many
existing guide-books on Egypt, nor-though every effort has
been made to ensure aoeursey-does it purport to serve as an
infallible book of reference to archaeologists. Its object is,
rather, to aid the visitors to this country by indicating that
which is most worth seeing, where they should go, and how
they may economise time, money, and fatigue to the greatest
advantage.

Cairo and Alexandria, Upper Egypt, the Fayoum, and
Lower Egypt are dealt with chapter by chapter, and their
interests, characteristics, and chief features presented.

To the text are added appendices giving detailed and
practical information of every kind; these have been made
as complete as possible. Time- tables and similar particulars,
which vary from time to time are _a, i: rsngie" so trs, tpjajpply

1908. In subsequent annual editions, Izot' only will the text
be revised, but the appendices will be brought up to date,
so as to be correct for the following Housou.

This guide- book is also published ht French and German
editions.
