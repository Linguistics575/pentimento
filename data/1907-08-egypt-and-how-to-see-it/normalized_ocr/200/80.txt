EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT



The other temple, built by Rameses IL, is not in anything
like the same state of preservation', only a part of the outer
walls and a few statue-columns remain. There was here a
second tablet, copied from that of Seti's temple, and now
removed to the British Museum; but, unlike the original,
it is mutilated. Herd by, to the north, is the tomb of Osiris,
and a mound of dibrig formed by the countless tombs of
ancient Egyptians who sought to be buried near Osiris. So
does Abydos represent at once the birth of Egypt and its
greatest period; and, more, it holds the historical record
of all the greatest who reigned, from Osiris and Meues even
to the days of Seti and Rsmeses-a great and ancient monu-
ment indeed.

Nag-Hamadi (kilo. 556) is the centre of a large sugar
district, and the factory is a model of the most modern
requirements of that industry.

Just beyond Nag-Hamadi the railway crosses the Nile,
and keeps to the east bank from this point onwards. The
hills begin to close in towards the river, and culminate near
Dabbeh in the huge sheer eliff of Gabel-el-Tarif (left-hand side).

Keneh (kilo. 611) is the home of the putters, the source of
the porous jars and bottles of fascinating shapes which one
sees all over Egypt. Water in them cools naturally and
automatically. It is rather interesting to see the native
potter turning the primitive wheel with his foot; the shape-
less clay rises to his touch and takes its appointed form.
Many of the houses in the town have their walls built of the
spoiled jars, which gives them a curious appearance

Keneh is the starting-point for the expedition to the temple
of Hathor at Dendem.

DENDERA

Dendera is some five miles-about an hour's donkey ride-
from Keneh. Ita chief feature is its modernity. The Temple is
of the lateJ? tolemaie period. One perceives at once a tendency
to depart from the rather grim convention; the figures on
the walls are more lifelike, their faces more expressive, and
the great crowning heads of Hathor on the pillars are really
beautiful and impressive in themselves. Evidently those
who designed the temple and its decorations were thinking
of Greek philosophy as well as of Egyptian mythology.
