RAILWAY ARRANGEMENTS

Manv people are surprised when they come to Egypt to
tiad a railway system which can compare in most particulars
with those of Europe and America. There are some 1500
miles of railway, with about 270 stations. under State manage-
ment, besides a large number of light railways.

The most important trains are composed of large double-
bogie corridor carriages of the latest design, lighted by elee-
tricity or gas On all the principal expresses dining- or
luruheorvears are provided, and for the longer journeys
sleeping-ears; these are of the well-known type used all
over Europe. and are run under an arrangement with the
Waeon-Lits Company.

There are three classes of carriages; the thirds, however,
are somewhat different from those in England, and it is very
unusual to see a European travelling third class. Fares are,
on the Whole. considerably cheaper than those of English
railways. A short journey costs more in proportion than a.
long one. The see0r1d-elass fare, is half the first-elasss, and
the third half the second.

Return tickets are not issued at present. except on one or
two of the suburban lines. No luggage is carried free, except
that which is taken by the passenger into the carriage.
Special trains, saloons, and the convevance of carriages or
motor-cam can be arranged for at short notice; particulars
on these points are given on page 197.
