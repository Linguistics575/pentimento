EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT



to have been the only attempt to escape from the infb1enee
of the all-powerful Theban priesthood of Amen-RS. He
preferred the worship of a single deity (the sun) to the
polytheism of his predecessors, changed his name to Khu-
enaten, "The Splendour of the Sun," and obliterated the name
of Amen-Ra from the walls of his sanctuaries. The priests
appear, however, to have been too powerful for him, and he
found it impossible to live at Thebes.

A site for a new capital was chosen at a point half-Wuy
between Memphis and Thebes. The famous architect Bek.
son of Men, was employed to build a magnificent royal city,
adorned with splendid temples, and containing a palace for
the king. This city was called Ekhut-Aten --" The Horizon
of the Sun."

Besides being a religious reformer, the king appears to
have encouraged the advance of art. Under his patronage
the enlightened Bek produced some exceedingly fine work,
of which an example is preserved in the beautiful stucco
pavements which formed part of the king's palace, and which
can still be seen.

A number of very interesting cuneiform tablets were found
in 1887, being despatehes to Amenhotep IV. from the rulers
of Mesopotamia and other Asiatic countries. These show
that the king's other interests had so monopolised him
that he was neglecting the affairs of the empire.

Amenhotep passed the remainder of his life quietly at the
new capital with his mother and wife and his seven daughters.
Soon after his death his successors returned to Thebes and
the thraldom of Amen; the "City of the Sun,, was allowed
to fall into rains, and art into its former convention.

Assiout (kilo. 378) is the largest city in Upper Egypt, largely

ASSIOUT

A town of white minarets, white and grey houses, and
many palm-trear, right under a big bluff M scarred, sandy
hill, it stands clear and clean against the plain, fortified from
the autumn Mod by low mud bastions.

There are fairly broad roads past fine houses and gardens,
leading then to winding, narrow streets. Many of these are
