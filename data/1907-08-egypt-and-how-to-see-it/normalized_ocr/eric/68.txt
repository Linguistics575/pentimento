EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT



keen Egyptologists. .One-~may-.surely. be forgiven for pre-
ferring to spend laz-y hours on the lake itself; its charm and
restfulness are a perfect antidote to the fever of the restless
pleasure-distraught Cairo life. The return drive to the
station is uphill, and one must allow an hour and a half:
the hotel ponies have been known to jib, and at any rate
they are likelv to be slow at the ascent. The best available
train leaves Abchaway at 4.4 RM. and reaches Medina at 4.54;
then goes on to Wasta. arriving there at 6.30 in time for the
north- and south-bound expresses.
