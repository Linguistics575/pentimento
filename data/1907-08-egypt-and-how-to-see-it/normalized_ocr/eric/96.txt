EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

Rameses II. to Amen. The entrance is, as usual, through a
pylon of colossal dimensions. On the inside are some very
realistic representations of the Syrian campaigns; on the
south side is the battle of Kadesh, and on the north the
Egyptian army encamped.

Very little remains of the first court, except the broken
Colossus of Rameses, a statue cut from a single block of
red granite. It must have been nearly sixty feet high,
and even the fragments that now remain testify to the
excellence of the workmanship. The second court is in very
fair preservation; it was surrounded by colonnades, and
many of the columns (some with statues of Osiris) are still
standing. Beyond is the hypostyle hall of forty-eight
columns, reached by three flights of steps.' The two centre
rows have calyx capitals and are higher than the rest, form-
ing a clerestory roof, as at Karnak; part of this roof is still
intact. Leading from the great hall are two smaller halls
with columns, beyond which was the sanctuary and other
rooms. They are, however, in a very ruinous state.

THE TOMBS 0F KURNET MURRAI

To the west of the Ramesseum is the hill of Kurnet Murrai,
where there are several rock tombs of the eighteenth dynasty.
The most interesting is that of Huya, who was governor of
Ethiopia under King Tut-enkh-Amen. The wall sculptures
are worth examining.

Beyond the hill of Kurnet Murrai is the small temple of
Deir-el-Medina, built by Ptolemy IV. and dedicated to Hathor.
If time allows, this is worth a visit.

MEDINET HABU

About a mile south of Deir-el-Medina are the temples of
Medinet Habu. The principal temple is that of Rameses III.;
it very much resembles the Ramesseum in plan, but is in a
much better state of preservation. Many of the exploits of
Rameses III. are depicted on the walls. The reliefs on the
outside walls of the temple are worth notice; both naval and
military operations are there depicted.

THE TOMBS OF THE QUEENS

The Tombs of the Queens are about a mile to the north-
west" of Medinet Habu. That of Queen Titi is the most
