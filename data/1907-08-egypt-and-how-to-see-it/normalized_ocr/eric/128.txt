EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

Ramleh on the Cairo-Alexandria line is Sidi-Gaber, about
ten minutes from Alexandria terminus; all trains stop there.

As to amusements, in Alexandria itself there is the Zizinia
Theatre, at which the various operatic and dramatic com-
panies perform after or before their stay in Cairo. There
are also concerts, and occasionally small dances at the hotels.

There are several clubs--the Khedivial (over the Bourse),
the Mohammed Aly, in Rue Rosette, and a recently formed
but very comfortable little English club, the Union.

HOTELS

There are many hotels and pensions in and around
Alexandria, of all classes and suitable to every taste. Of
those in the town, the Savoy Palace, Khedivial, Grand
Hotel, and Hotel Windsor are the best. These are all first-
class, and in any one of them the visitor will find comfortable
quarters.

The Savoy Palace is perhaps the most up-to-date, as the
hotel was only opened at the beginning of 1907. It pos-
sesses everything that makes hotel life pleasant--electric
lifts, a French restaurant and American bar, a hair-dressing
establishment in the hotel; and there are private suites of
rooms provided for the more wealthy visitors.

The Khedivial is situated in the fashionable quarter of
the town, and can be recommended.

The Grand Hotel is most conveniently placed in the very
centre of the town.

The Hotel Windsor is near the sea. It is rather smaller
than the hotels mentioned above, and offers very reasonable
terms to its visitors.

At Ramleh the principal hotel is the Grand Casino San
Stefano--about ten minutes by electric tram from Sidi-
Gaber station. This hotel forms the summer quarters of the
Government, and it offers many attractions to its visitors.
It is on the sea-shore, and has a splendid terrace facing
the sea, on which meals are served in summer and a band
plays every afternoon. There are also frequent concerts.
an occasional dance, and many other entertainments. At-
tached to the hotel is a well-equipped bathing establishment,
where one may take one's morning bathe in the sea with
safety and comfort.

The Hotel Beau Rivage is a minute or two further on by
tram. It is smaller and more moderate than the Casino,
