EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT



of the doors opening on to the sanctuary is a curious fresco,
showing Decius sacrificing to Knoumu. Decius is the latest
Roman emperor cited in hieroglyphics on Egyptian monu-
ments. On the north wall is a fresco of the hawk-headed
Horus netting water~fowl and fish in company with Com-
modus and Knoumu--a curious trio.

There is a small chapel in the east wall, where are several
inscriptions that mention the names of Roman emperors.

Esneh has also a Roman quay wall on the river.

At Mahamid, two stations beyond Esneh, are the ruins of
El-Kab, the Nekkab of ancient Egypt and Eileithyiaspolis of
the Greeks.

The ruins, about two miles south of the station, are sur-
rounded by an extremely massive wall of mud-brick 37 ft.
thick, which, although built during the Middle Empire, is
little damaged. There is a very fine view from the { north
wall.

The small temple of Amenhotep III., to the east, is worth
seeing.

There are many other remains. In the hills to the north are
rock tombs of the Middle and New Empires and inscriptions
by kings of the sixth dynasty; also a small rock temple,
reached by a stairway cut in the rock, and built under Euer-
getes II.

Edfou, the next station, once a great city, is now but a
small town. The temple is in the middle of the town on
the west bank of the river; it is the most perfect example of
an Egyptian temple existing today.

The station of Edfou is on the edge of the river, which is
crossed by the ferry, and the temple is reached in twenty
minutes' walk or ten minutes' donkey-ride.

Horus was the local deity, and to him the temple is dedi-
cated. He was the first "Lord of the Two Lands "in pre-
dynastic mythology. The temple, commenced by Ptolemv
Euergetes I. and continued by Philopator, was completed
by Neos Dionysius, who added the decorative reliefs. Other
rulers also added to it. It is a monument to the glory of
Horus and the greatness of the Ptolemaic monarchs. The
columns are admirably preserved, and richly decorated with
fine capitals. The paintings and reliefs on the ceiling of the
