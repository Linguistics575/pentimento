EGYPT. AND HOW TO SEE IT

it will contain four hundred rooms, fitted with every comfort
as well as sitting-rooms, reading-rooms, billiard-rooms.
concert-rooms, bars, & c. & c. In a word, it is designed to
meet every wish and even caprice of the visitor or resident
who cares to exchange the heat and dust and rush of Cairo
for the quiet and pure air of the desert. Further, the origi-
nators of the scheme have laid out a "Sporting Park," as
one may call it, for racing, golf, tennis, polo, and other games.
The purity of the keen air, the sense of space, the beauty of
