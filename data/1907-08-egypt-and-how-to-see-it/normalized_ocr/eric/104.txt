EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

There are three rooms to the north-east. In the third is
a relief of Ptolemy Philometor, followed by Cleopatra and
the two gods of the temple, receiving from Khons the emblem
of long life. At this end of the temple are the two sanc-

'l'e1nple of liom Umbo

tuaries, that of Sebek to the right and of Horus to the left.
In front of the' temple, on the terrace, close to the two
sanctuaries, is a small temple devoted to the birth-goddess,
but it is mostly in ruins. Last of all is the little unfinished
chapel dedicated by Domitian to the glory of Hathor.

Between Daraw and Ghezireh, where the line at times
skirts the river, are wonderful views of the sweeping curves
of the Nile. Palms on the far bank stand out against the
brilliant ochre of the desert hills.

A subtle change seems to have come over the country.
It is all of a sudden the Egypt of the picture-books known
in one's childhood. The river, sand, and palm-trees are old
friends. One looks for a crocodile at the water-side.

After Ghezireh comes the junction for Shellal, and then
Assouan.
