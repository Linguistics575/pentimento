EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

The Fayoum is radically different from all the rest of
Egypt, it is practically an artificial province--neither more
nor less--brought into being by the Bahr- el- Yussuf some four
thousand years ago. This "River of Joseph "( probably it
existed a thousand years before his day) flows westward
from the Nile, and divides into many little canals that water
the whole country and ensure its unusual fertility--for it is
unusually fertile. Roses, apricots, figs, grapes, olives, corn,
cotton, and many another fruit or crop, all are plentiful, and
some superior to what we find 1n the rest of Egypt. Even
the sheep and fow 1s are fat and well- liking.

To the north, east and south are the hills which separate
the Fayoum. from Egypt and the Libyan Desert. To the
north- west is Lake Moeris (Birket- el- Karoun). This was
the glory of the province, the home of the sacred crocodiles
worshipped by the dwellers 1n Arsinoé. Arsinoé like Ombos,
had its Tentyris--the city of Heracle0polis whose citizens
worshipped the Ichneumon. There was also the Labyrinth,
a marvel to Herodotus.

Lake Moeris was probably partly artificial, it was. in fact,
a great reservoir that supplied water to all the land lying
north of it. King Amenemhet III. (twelfth dynasty) seems
to have been the first to put it to this use; he built a regu-
lator and other irrigation works, of which remains are still
to be seen at Lahoun. Incidentally it harboured the sacred
crocodiles, and also--as nowadays--a quantity of fish.

Arsinoé is a mere heap of débris, haunted by the kite and
the jackal alone--that great city where Sebek, the crocodile
god, was worshipped. Many kinds of fish, too, seem to have
been sacred. The priests probably combined this. sacred
fish culture with practical irrigation, and induced the people
on religious grounds to maintain the waterways which were
actually to serve the cr0ps. The principle of the widespread
utility of Lake Moeris was that the Nile, when high, flowed
into it. As the Nile flood receded the surplus water in the
lake returned to the river through the various exits and
sluices, and repaid its debt.

The modern town of Medinet-el-Fayoum is interesting.
The broad Bahr- el- Yussuf flows through it from end to end,
bridged here and there, and with streets on either bank.
The water- wheels are here (and nowhere else in Egypt)
worked by. the current itself. Arsinoé is to the north.
