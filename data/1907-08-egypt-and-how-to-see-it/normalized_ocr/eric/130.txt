EGYPT, AND HOW TO SEE IT

papyri. Ptolemy II. (Philadelphus) built the Pharcs, a light-
house of white marble. once one of the seven wonders of the
world. During the reign of the Ptolemies Alexandria must
have been a great and magnificent city.

Thelibrary and museum were burnt tothe ground on Julius
Caesar's entry into Alexandria. In compensation Antony
is supposed to have presented Cleopatra and her city with
the library of Pergamus. in which were some 200,000 MSS.
This second library was destroyed by order of the Caliph
Omar about 640 A.D.

The Serapeum was a very wonderful building. Begun
bv Caesar and completed by Augustus. it held the statue
of Serapis, which was worshipped by both Greeks and
Egyptians.

Alexandria was a great centre of Christianity and perse-
cution; perhaps there was more internecine discord there
than in anv other city of Christian history. Every one who
has read Kingsley's book will remember the fate of Hypatia
and the character the author gives to the fierce monks and
priests. Arius, Atlianasius, Cyril, Nestorius, and many a
relentless sectarian contributed their share to Alexandrine
discord.



POMPEY'S PILLAR AND THE CATACOMBS

Few relics of Alexandria's former greatness remain; the
most interesting are Pompey's Pillar and the Catacombs.
The former consists of a single red-granite shaft about seventy
feet high. It was erected by a Roman prefect of Egypt in
the reign of Diocletian. It can be easily reached by tram
from the Mohammed Aly Square in about ten minutes.

A short distance west of Pompey's Pillar are the Cata-
combs. Among them are many interesting tombs of the first.
four centuries A.1). One fine tomb of the Roman period
was discovered in 1900, and is well worth a visit. It has
most interesting and beautiful reliefs both in Egyptian and
Roman style. Professor Wallis Budge in Messrs. Cook's
guidebook goes into details fully and with admirable pre-
c1s10n.

The two obelisks known as "Cleopatra's Needles "once
stood in Alexandria, but they have been removed and are
now, one in London and the other in New York.
