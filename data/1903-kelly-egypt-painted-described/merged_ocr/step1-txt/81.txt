Cairo

to Cairo by train, H Effendi elected to .walk.
Mistaking his way in the dark, he found himself
among the rocks which formed the habitation of the
expelled pariahs. An immediate attack was the result,
and the unfortunate gentleman was obliged to scramble
up the rocks and keep his enemies at bay by rolling
stones and d√©bris upon them; with each check he made
his way to the next ridge, where he would again be
attacked and forced to adopt the same plan of defence.

In this way the night was passed, until about three
in the morning he found himself, bootless, torn, and
half unconscious, upon the Tiira line some miles on
the other side of Cairo. Presently the first early
morning quarry- train appeared, taking stone to
Abbasiyeh, and H Effendi called upon the driver
for assistance. The driver, however, startled and
alarmed, exclaimed, "You must be either a devil or
a murderer to be here at this time," and with the
assistance of the stoker bound him hand and foot,
and threw him among the coals in the tender. On
reaching Abbasiyeh he was locked up in the lamproom to await the arrival of the station-master, upon
whose appearance the zealous railivay-men recounted
the adventure, and, throwing open the door, brought
out the supposed malefactor. Their discomfiture may
be imagined when, recognising in him a high Government official, the station-master with obsequious
"salaams" hastened to offer his apologies, and commiserated with "his excellency" upon the indignity
and discomfort he had suffered.
