Egypt

ing to occupy several days; a sail to Port Said, a
day's fishing with the fleet, or to the artist the stalking and sketching of wild birds, passes the time pleasantly
and advantageously. The fisher-folk also are hard..
working and worthy creatures, and only too anxious to
be obliging. While sketching here I have repeatedly
interrupted men engaged in landing fish, who at my
request have contentedly posed up to their waists in
water while I introduced them into my subject.

From Ghaitren-Nasara a short sail brings you to
Matarieh, also a fishing centre and the port of the town
of Menzala.

As in Damietta, Menzala possesses many features of
interest. Here also burnt brick takes the place of sundried, and, as we have noticed in Damietta, adds variety
to the colour of buildings all more or less dilapidated.
The form of the mosque minarets also is peculiar to
this district, their height and beauty showing that at one
time Menzala must have been wealthy and ambitious.
On its outskirts are many old tombs, where also are
many beautiful gardens and vine-walks of former
grandees, now hopelessly neglected. Poor to-day and
thinly populated, Menzala is a monument of picturesque
decay, and, like most of the extremely pictorial places
in Egypt I have visited, is squalid and insanitary in
inverse ratio to its beauty.

The town is built on the banks of a canal called the
"Bahr-es-Soghraieh," which, starting from the Nile at
Maniiirah, serves, in its course of fifty miles or so of
devious wanderings, to water as many farms and villages,
