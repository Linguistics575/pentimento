wise, and would avoid chills and their evil consequences,

Though generally quiescent, the Nile, like all sunny
characters, has its moments of anger, when for brief
periods passivity gives place to storm. During the
months of March and April the "khamsin" l winds
are prevalent. Blowing from the south-west and
having their origin in the heart of Africa, these hot
winds sweep across hundreds of miles of desert,
gathering volume as they travel and enveloping all
nature in a veil of whirling drift-sand, occasionally
sufficiently dense to obscure the sun. Then, lashed
into fury by the wind, the Nile becomes a dangerous
river for small boats, which are sometimes wrecked,
while even large steamers may be driven out of their
course and stranded. Though, as the name implies, the
"khamsin tt winds cover a period of approximately fifty
days, they are intermittent in their energy; two or
three days of wind being succeeded by an equal period
of beautifully fine weather.

From the north-west also comes a strong wind
which sometimes carries dust with it, though in this
case it never lasts long, and is frequently followed by
a heavy shower of rain. A rather curious instance
occurred some few years ago during a gymkhana at
the Pyramids. While the sports were in full swing,
a gathering gloom to the north-west attracted the
attention of some, and evidently betokened a shower.
