steamer to make the trip in comfort, the benefit of
which supply they hoped to share.

Our journey was far from smooth sailing. Groundings were frequent, and once we overran some submerged masonry, which smashed one of our plates
and filled the fore-peak with water, and some hours'
work was necessary before this damage was repaired,
our men having to work under the water.

The climax, however, was reached at a village called
Tarbaniyeh, where the river, though apparently good
water, had only one narrow and very tortuous navigable canal, in which several "giassas "were hopelessly
stuck. Our men were sent out wading in the hopes
of finding a way round them, but without avail, and
the only course open to us was to make fast a hawser
and tow the obstructing vessels backwards out of the
way. We made fast to the nearest boat and went
astern. The moment, however, the strain came on,
we pulled her whole stern out without moving the
boat an inch. Then followed a scene which, though
pathetic, was amusing. The owner, with loud laments.
