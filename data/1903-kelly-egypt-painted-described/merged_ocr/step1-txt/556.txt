Egypt

Prophet are indulgence in opium, hashish, or tobacco,
as well as intoxicants of any kind. Hashish and alcohol
work more havoc among the natives than any other
influence, yet every caf√© will supply the former, and no
restriction is placed upon the sale of drink, which, in
Cairo and other centres, has such a demoralising effect
among the Moslem population; and the institution of
a liquor licence and the prohibition of opiates would
be at least one move in the direction of diminution of
crime.

More than all else, however, would be the force of
example on the part of the European population, and I
am glad to think that Englishmen at any rate have set
such an example to the people. From highest to lowest
of the Government servants, each has been actuated by
a sense of responsibility beyond the reach of bribes;
honesty and integrity characterise every department of
the administration, while justice and good faith on the
part of all have inspired in the mind of the native a
feeling of confidence and respect.

In conclusion, I cannot do better than give an
illustration in proof of this. A native, wishing to sell a
horse whose soundness was under discussion, exhausted
all the asseverations in his repertoire without convincing
the doubter. F inally the bargain was clinched, as with
raised hand he exclaimed, "Ana kelm wahed, ana kelm
Inglisi," which may be roughly translated as:

"I speak the truth, I speak as an Englishman! "
