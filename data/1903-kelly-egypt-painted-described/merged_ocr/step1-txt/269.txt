The N ile

This temple, dedicated to the worship of the
crocodile, is very appropriately built on the water's
edge, its pylon standing on the very brink. What
remains of the temple is small in extent, but the inscriptions on the walls are particularly interesting, and the
capitals and deep cornice richly carved. Standing as it
does on the river, and entirely free from obstruction,
Kom Ombos is a striking feature in a landscape otherwise somewhat lacking in character, and, especially in
the softer evening effects, forms a good subject for the
painter.

As we proceed, the former grandeur of the scenery
is left behind, and the limestone mountains which have
been our daily companions from Cairo, and to which so
much of the beauty of the river is due, will shortly
disappear to give place to the granite hills and golden
sands of Nubia. Presently a bend in the river discloses
the palm-groves of Elephantine, and the town of
Assuan surrounded by the hills which here close in
upon the river, and mark the frontier of Egypt proper
and the southern boundary of the Cataract.
