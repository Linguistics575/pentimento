The N ile

The temple itself is half hidden among mud-heaps,
all that remains of the Roman buildings which once
surrounded it, and is probably the latest temple to be
built in Egypt, dating only two thousand years back.
It is in wonderful preservation, and the massive dignity
of its interior is very impressive, and in its architecture

Pharaohnic period.

The Nile is a river of contrasts no less than of
harmonies. On one side, mud-banks and cultivation

perpendicular sides, the regular stratifications being
broken here and there by some earthquake "fault "or
a rock-hewn tomb. Close in to the rocks lie boats,
dwarfed into insignificance by the tremendous mass
above them, while the blue-clad quarrymen, toiling
laboriously, load them with their cargoes of dazzling
white. Eagles soar about the Cliff's and are lost to sight
before the top is reached, and along the narrow strip of
shingle-beach a small boy and his black flock of goats
scramble warily in search of pasture. The whole is
