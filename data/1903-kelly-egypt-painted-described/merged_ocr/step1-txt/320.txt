garments together, prepared to come out. For t
moment I thought she intended to land in a state

unfastened the bundle on her head, which proved u

her shoulders, and allowed to fall gradually, withoe
touching water, or exposing an inch of her perso

until, reaching the bank, she stood radiant in her fre
clothing, with the wet garments in her hand!

This town of Mit Gamr, with Zifta on the opposite
bank, forms, I think, one of the most picturesque bin
in the country. The river sweeps broadly betwe
them in a double curve, the old houses rising direct ]
from the water on either side, and in many ca
supported on built columns whose foundations a
submerged.

sunburned and weathered, is opposed to an edifice
yellow stone or red brick, the whole gaining a spark
and brilliance by contrast with the green-paint
window-shutters and the foliage of the arboured ca A
on the banks.

Some of the mosques have a curious double minaret
and in the town are many quaint corners which it h
always been my intention one day to paint. U
