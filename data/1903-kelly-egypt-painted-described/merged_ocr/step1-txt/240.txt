Egypt

tion of Egypt is represented by the crumbling debris
which partially cover magnificent buildings erected a
thousand years before their advent in the country.

So much of antiquity is here, that the ordinary
person, comfortably settled in an up-to-date hotel,
and surrounded by a world of Western fashion, may
well be perplexed by such an incongruity of dates;
and it is difficult at first to realise that Joseph and
his brethren may possibly have witnessed the commencement of many of these piles, or that their
unhappy descendants may as slaves have toiled in
their completion. The mind becomes bewildered,
and, to those who are unversed in hieroglyphics or
the ancient history of the land, interest in the
monuments must be largely pictorial.

Still, even to the lay mind many characteristic
features of design and decoration must appeal. No
one who has seen the colonnade at Luxor could
fail to appreciate the grandeur of its columns or
the splendid boldness of the capitals. The lofty
obelisk, and granite statue of Rameses IL, are but
a foretaste of that greatness of idea which culminates
in the magnificence of Karnak or the stupendous
dignity of the Colossi.

No expert knowledge is necessary for the appreciation of Karnak. It immediately fascinates the visitor,
whose wonder grows as he wanders through its ruined
halls, and vainly attempts to picture it as it once was,
and repeople its courts with the stately pageantry of its
religious processions.
