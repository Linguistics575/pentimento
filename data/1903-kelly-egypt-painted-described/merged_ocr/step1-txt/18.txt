Egypt

heartily rendered to the proprietors of Black and White
and The Century Magazine for their kind permission to
repeat matter already published by them, and also to
the many owners of my work, who have so generously
allowed the reproduction of pictures in their possession
---a courteous and kindly co-operation without which
it would have been almost impossible to complete this
volume.
