Religion and Character of the Egyptians

are not tolerated in Christian countries. Polygamy,
for instance, is sanctioned by the Koran; but it must
be remembered that this is only the continuance of a
practice common among the patriarchs and heroes of
the Old Testament. As a rule, the Egyptian is the
husband of one wife, and, provided she has children,
and gives no serious cause for displeasure, he is usually
faithful to her. Should she, however, be barren, the
husband will probably take a second in the hope of
perpetuating his name and race; and the first wife,
if not previously divorced, becomes an attendant upon
her more fortunate sister.

Their religion exercises a great influence upon the
mass of the people, among whom it is a frequent
subject of discussion; and, just as Arabi Pasha's
success initially was the result of his intimate knowledge of the Koran and his power of dramatic recitation of its verses, so Moslem history shows how, in
almost all cases, pretenders and leaders of great popular
movements have gained their ascendency through its
influence.

Owing to lack of education and very slight intercommunication between villages, public opinion in
Egypt is almost non-existent, and it is only by appeals
to their religious fervour or fanaticism that any combined action on their part can be aroused.

Most of the festivals, which form the only relaxation from work, are of a religious character, and even
the names men bear have often a similar significance.
