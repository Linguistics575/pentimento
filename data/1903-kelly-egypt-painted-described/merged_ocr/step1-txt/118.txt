so full of vermin that I dared not remove them, and I

illuminated ceiling restoration may be seen.

Mena House Hotel now has some of the finest

a fine collection of decorative work, all of which is
genuine and the best of its kind. Most of the old
furniture of wood- or brass-work has disappeared,
