Egypt

In the Muski, the "caboot" or wooden roof which
formerly spanned the street has been removed, and
the small but attractive native shops, with their oldworld superstructure, have to a great extent been
replaced by large plate-glass windows and modern
fronts. The street has been practically rebuilt, and
the Muski of the long ago is no more.

Even the dog-scavengers of former times have given
place to the "Cairo Sanitary Transport Co." of to-day;
and though no doubt the latter is a vast improvement
upon the earlier primitive state of things, its advent
marked the disappearance of another picturesque feature
of Cairo street life.

I well remember how by day these dogs would
lie about the streets lazily blinking and sleeping in
the sun, too indolent often to eat the scraps thrown
to them, and not infrequently being run over and
killed by passing vehicles. At night, however, they
formed dangerous packs of hunters, and I have more
than once been chased by them. Each pack had its
own particular quarter, and was never known to
cross into that of another, and the fiercest onslaught
would suddenly cease when this imaginary line of
demarcation was reached. In the town they are a
thing of the past, but they still live in the warrens
beyond Fostat and the Gibel Achmar1 at Abbasiyeh.

A native official of my acquaintance had a very
unpleasant experience of them some years ago. We
were both dining at Zeitiin, and while I returned
