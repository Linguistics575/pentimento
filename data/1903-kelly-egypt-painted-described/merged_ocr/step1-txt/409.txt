Riding through the Land of Goshen

Everything was quiet, and in the darkness I could
see little, the roadway being roofed by a thatch of
some kind, which prevented the starlight penetrating.
After groping about in the dark, I stumbled upon a
raised platform of earth, on which, rolled up in my
blanket, I went to sleep. On awakening in the morning I discovered that my impromptu bedchamber was
simply a small courtyard which formed a kitchen, the
common property of two or three adjacent houses, and
that I was sleeping on an earth-oven, the fire of which
some one had just set alight. On discovering me, the
women immediately fled, but presently the Omdeh and
his headmen came to offer their "salaams "and to inquire as to my comfort during the night. I was able to
assure him that I had slept well, and was quite ready
for breakfast. During the day I made a sketch of my
curious bedroom, a proceeding which excited considerable interest among the onlookers. "Why," said one
man to the Omdeh, "is the Effendi painting this poor
place? ""Hush," said the Omdeh, "he is a friend
of the Queen's, and he will take the picture to her and
say,' See, your Majesty, what poor houses these people
live in,' and she will reply,' Yes, poor fellows, here is
,5 Soo; go and tell them to build better ones!, "

Outside the village were several extremely beautiful
subjects. The mud of which the buildings are composed had been excavated on the spot, the hollow so
caused filling up with infiltrated water, forming a large
"birkeh" or pool, which partly encircled the town.
These "birkeh" are invariably found in conjunction
