repeated this with every cast. I watched the pair
for some time with amusement, and I really think
that the bird caught more than the fisherman, in
spite of his superior appliances.

Very frequently may be seen perched high up on
the bank native boats in course of construction or
repair. Seeing them out of water gives one a better
idea of their proportions. The sweep of the, high
bow is really beautiful, as also the model of the hull
itself. It always strikes me as curious that, though
no building-plan is used and the workmen appear
to construct their vessel by rule of thumb, still in the
whole length of the river the model of each class of
boat is identical. It is worth while watching the
boat-builder at work, and one can only wonder that
so much beauty of line and proportion can be got
out of the scraps of wood and twisted timbers of
which they are built. It may be noticed also that
invariably they are "hogbacked," that is, that the
keel, instead of being straight, inclines upwards from
each end of the boat so that it is lost amidships.
The reason for this is, that while the depth of keel
at bow and stern gives the vessel sufficient hold on
the water for sailing purposes, should it strike a
bank the cut-water will easily carry through, and by
reason of its flat bottom and shallower draught amidship the whole body of the boat will "jump" the
obstruction. The high lateen sail also is the result
of experience and local necessity; for were European
