Canal Life in the Delta

in Egypt, have still an interest of their own in the
water-borne traffic they carry.

The Bahr Moiise eventually debouches into Lake
Mentala, fishing-boats from whence frequently enter
and fish its waters. On one of my journeys our party
arrived at the banks of this canal at a point too deep
for fording, and entirely devoid of any means of transit.
As it was necessary that we should cross, we were rather
at a loss what to do. Presently there approached a
fishing-boat netting the stream, and on our hailing the
crew they quickly hauled in their nets and prepared
to ferry us across. The precipitous banks, rendered
slippery by the splashing water, made it no easy task
to transfer our camels, horses, and donkeys from the
high bank to the boat below them. After much excitement, and with a great deal of trouble, our beasts, camp
equipment, and ourselves were safely landed on the
other side. The operation, however, necessitated three
journeys of the boat, and consequent loss of a couple
of hours of daylight for the fishermen. Upon our
offering to reward them for their services, they declined
all payment, saying that "Allah had allowed them to
befriend the wayfarer, and he would reward them";
and a few minutes later their nets were again in the
water and the fishermen working as though no in-.

craft, though usually peaceful in its character, and, to
those inclined for sport, able occasionally to provide
