The First Cataract

Close to the station was a deserted shop, its windows
heavily festooned with cobwebs, and over whose door
appeared the name of Charles Neufeld, which, with the
subsequent arrival of Slatin Pasha, just escaped from
Omdurman, brought home to all the great tragedy of
the Siidan then being enacted so close beside you.
The bazaars, too, were full of Dervish trophies: swords
and spears from Toski or Abu Klea, blood-stained
"jibbeh" or coats of mail, hide shields broken by
British bullets, all having a melancholy interest, and
to be bought for a trifle.

The day of retribution is come and gone, and
Assuan no longer is the sentinel of civilisation it then

long pipe-stems of carved ebony, curious sticks and
ornaments, or strings of beads on plaited leather made
by the handsome Besharin, and the universally demanded

whips vary very much in value, the special point of

find, and costly when met with. These used to be
common instruments of punishment, and cut the flesh
