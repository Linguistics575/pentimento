Egypt

might be developed in quite a different direction. T
surrounding district of Ghait-en-Nasaral is peculiarl
fertile, and capable of enormous production of fruit a
vegetables. Why are its natural advantages neglect
by the authorities? Fruit export alone might become
a profitable asset for the people and the Government
and the building of a light railway to Port Said, or t t
institution of a fleet of shallow-draught steamers, wou a
enable this district to send across Lake Menzala
endless supply of fresh vegetables and farm-produce f
the provisioning of passing ships.

All this could be done without any interference wit
existing trades or privileges, land already used for t.
purpose elsewhere being equally available for the growth
of cotton or other export commodities.

What is wanted is Government help in the wa
suggested. Given their proper means of communicit2
tion, water in the river, their light railways, or steam
to Port Said, etc., and the sympathetic encourage
of the Government, a new era of prosperity would ark
for Damietta (and incidentally for Rosetta also) which
while relieving the necessities of a hard-working a
respectable population, would add materially to
revenue of the country.
