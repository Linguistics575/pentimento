Egypt

ornate "mihrab" is credited with healing virtue, and
any day men and women may be seen rubbiilg lemons
on one of its pilasters, and licking up the moisture in
the firm belief that a cure will ensue. A little stick
hangs on the railing of the tomb; this is used to cure
fools or idiots, by striking them on the head. Women
also bring their ailing children here for relief. In this
case water is poured into a large porphyry bowl, and
with another piece of the same stone they grind until
the water is red and muddy, the mixture being given
to the children with absolute confidence in its medicinal
property.

The Red Mosque at Biilak also has peculiar sanctity.
I purposed painting it some years ago, but my servant
warned me that it would be useless my making the
attempt. "Why so P "I asked, and he gravely informed
me that "once an artist tried to do so, and a stone fell
from the minaret and killed him; on another occasion
the water of the'meydaah,' or tank, had turned to
blood; and he was sure i that whatever I might paint
during the day'Allah' would obliterate by night,
even if nothing worse befell." It so happens that, other
work interfering, I have never yet been able to carry
out my intention, and so disabuse my servant's mind
of its curious belief.

It is said that for a year the devout Moslem may
worship each day in a different mosque without completing the round of Cairo's religious edifices. This
statement is certainly well inside the mark, there being
probably four hundred or more recognised mosques in
