Mosques and Public Buildings

In their tilework, tesselated pavements, the highly

surrounds the tomb and forms the grill between the
"sebeel" and mosque proper; and I have noticed in
many places where an archway is formed by keyed stonework, each stone is ornamented separately, so that" the
structure is not disguised, as is so often the case with
us, where joints are hidden and perhaps a floral relief
made to appear as the support of the superstructure.

It always seems to me that these mosques are characterised by great dignity of proportion, accurate spacing,
and a very discriminating use of ornament. The first
aim would seem to be to satisfy structural demands,

several are associated with Kalaiin. Here the particularly
