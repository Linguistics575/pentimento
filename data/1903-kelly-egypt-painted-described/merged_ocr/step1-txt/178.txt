Egypt

The views from here are certainly splendid. To
the east lie Abbasiyeh's white buildings standing out
against the sea of foliage which stretches from Kiibbeh,
Zeitiin, and Matariah until it is lost in the blue
distance of Marg. Below you lies the city of Cairo,
whose extent has perhaps never before been fully
realised. Beyond it to the north spread indefinitely
corn and cotton-lands, through which the silver thread
of river winds towards the sea. To the. west and
south-west is the plateau of the Libyan desert impinging upon the cultivated land. Here are the pyramidfields of Gizeh, Abiisir, Sakkara, and Dahshiir, and
even the distant Mediin Pyramid can be seen. Beyond
is the eternal desert, which finally merges into the Great
Sahara. I very much doubt if there is anywhere a
more impressive series of views than may be seen from
the Gama Garichy, and this year I witnessed from
it one of the weirdest effects I have ever seen in
Egypt. It was approaching sunset, when a sudden
dust-storm arose obscuring the view in all directions.
Below me was an abyss of yellow fog, which in spite
of the high wind appeared motionless; the sky was
obliterated, and the very ground I stood upon had
disappeared. Nothing was to be seen in any direction except the domes and minarets of the tombs
of the Memliiks, which, without visible base, reared
their ghostly forms in mid-air. Behind them was a
luminous veil focussing in a central point of sickly
whiteness, which represented all that could be seen of
the setting sun.
