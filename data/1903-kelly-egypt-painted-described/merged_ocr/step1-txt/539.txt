Condition of the People

insupportable burden, has found the treasury considerably enriched. Public works of the first importance
have been carried on, not by forced labour, but at fair
wages; rights of property or persons are respected, and
the laws wisely and impartially administered.

But while in many ways the material prosperity of
the people has increased, the moral influence of an
honest and enlightened administration is no less marked.
The strenuous effort to abolish every abuse, equal
justice for rich and poor, a scrupulous regard for
religious and racial customs, and the evident sincerity
and sympathy of the dominant power, have given to the
people a new sense of security, and have created in them
the desire to help themselves.

Already richer than ever in their history, every one
seems to be striving after independence. Little hoards
of savings are dug up from their hiding-places for
investment, and there is a keen demand for land.
Large acreages of reclaimed land have been bought in
this way, thus adding to the productiveness of the
country, as well as restoring to circulation large sums
of money previously withdrawn.

So far, England has well fulfilled her trust, and,
though some appointments which have recently been
made have provoked criticism, Egypt is probably the
best administered country in the world to-day, where,
free from the obligations of party politics, the best
man available is set to carry out a given work; and
it must be acknowledged that he nearly always does
it well.
