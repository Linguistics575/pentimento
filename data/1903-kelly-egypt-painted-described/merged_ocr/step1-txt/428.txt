Egypt

there can be no doubt that much of the increased
wealth of the people and country is due to the enormous development of irrigation-works which has been
going on for some years past.

Every one, however, must work. While the father
is busy ploughing or sowing, the sons work at the
shadoof. The women, in the intervals of housework,
are also busy in the fields, while children of the
tenderest age watch the cattle tethered in the bercime
or drive the patient buffalo at the water-wheel.

While the corn is growing, other work is to be
done. The cotton-fields have to be weeded and vegetables planted. The first crop of bercime, enriched by
the manure of the cattle grazing upon it, is replaced
by a second heavier crop, which is cut and marketed
as fodder.

Meanwhile the palm-trees want attention. Each tree must be separately climbed and pruned, the outer
branches being cut off, leaving only the central bunch
of leaves to protect the opening blossom. When ripe,
each female flower must be fertilised by male pollen,
for the farmer pays a tax on every fruiting tree and
will take no chances.

Large areas are under date-cultivation, and although
requiring considerable attention it is a very profitable
crop. The tree begins to fruit at about three years
old, often when mature bearing four to eight cwt. of
fruit per tree. When cultivated, the date-palm is never
of great height like the wild ones we meet at intervals, but so soon as its limit of profitable production
