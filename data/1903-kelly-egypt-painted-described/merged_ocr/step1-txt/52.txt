older Italian streets are not without interest. All are
beautified by avenues of "lebbek" 1 trees, and an
occasional rand point, with its small ornamental garden
and plashing fountain.

All the best hotels are here, and, except for the
passing camel-train and ubiquitous donkey-boy, which
lend it a touch of local colour, this part of Cairo has
little interest other than is to be found in well-dressed
Paris or London..

I cannot help regretting the old flannel-shirt and
Knickerbocker days of the early'eighties, when good
families lived in Sharia Esbekiyeh and the Fagalla, and
residents were not above riding donkeys and dining in a
public caf√©. Those days were comfortable and picturesque, and I cannot help thinking more healthy; and
very excellent dinners were formerly provided by these
breweries.

Probably one of the first impressions the new-comer
receives is the al-fresco nature of the life of the
place, and the casual manner in which the numerous
cafes of the Esbekiyeh quarter are permitted to overspread the footwalks with their little tables and chairs,
in some cases compelling pedestrians to walk in the
road, at the risk of being run over by some recklessly
driven "arrabiyeC'2 They are interesting, however,

Levantines, arguing or love-making, some lazily smoking the bubbling "sheesha,"' others playing "trictrac "4 for the price of a coffee or vermouth.
