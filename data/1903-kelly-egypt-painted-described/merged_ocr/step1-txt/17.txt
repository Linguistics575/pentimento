Author's Note

IN response to the expressed wish of many friends, I
have ventured to present in book form some of the
impressions and experiences derived from a somewhat
lengthened residence in Egypt.

In doing so, I make no attempt to produce a work
of any critical value, my aim being rather to give a
broadly pictorial representation of the life and scenery
of the country, and particularly those phases of each
which lie off the beaten track. Nor do I pretend to
fully illustrate my text or describe my illustrations; but
my hope is, that each, amplifying the other, may convey
to the reader a little of the fascination of the country,
and perhaps excite some feeling of sympathetic interest
in a people I have learned to like so well.

I would like to avail myself of this opportunity of
expressing my grateful thanks to my many friends in
Egypt, who, by facilities offered and information given,
have so materially assisted me in gaining such know
ledge of the country as I possess. My thanks are also
vii
