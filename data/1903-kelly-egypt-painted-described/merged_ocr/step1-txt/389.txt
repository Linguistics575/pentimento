Riding through the Land of Goshen

Guided by the servants, who carried lamps, we had to
stumble over a rough bridle-path for a mile or more to
the Sheykh's house, prettily situated on a canal-bank,
and surrounded by palm-trees and fruit-gardens.

Sheykh Mohammed met us at the gate of his compound, and, kissing us on both cheeks, made us welcome,
saying that he was honoured by the presence of Englishmen in his house. The gate opened into a square
courtyard; on the left, a divan and other offices, while
on the right were the kitchens and the servants' quarters.
In the centre was a well, and beyond, the guest-chamber
opened by arches into the compound.

Entering the divan, coffee and cigarettes were
served while dinner was being prepared. The Sheykh's
brother and other guests soon arrived, and, exchanging
the usual greetings, we sat down crossllegged upon the
couches awaiting the advent of dinner. Presently the
servant informed our host that the dinner was ready,
and, asking us if we were agreeable, the Sheykh led the
way into the guest-room. This was a long narrow
room, some thirty feet by fifteen, one side of which was
practically opened to the night air. The walls and
floor were of sun-dried mud, a raised "delcka" (or
bench) of the same material running round the three
sides of the room; carpets and cushions were spread
upon the "delcka," and matting covered a portion
of the sanded floor. The roof was thatched with
"doura" I stalks, from the beam hung two or three
lanterns, and in a niche in the wall stood the drinking
I Indian corn.
