Egypt

which they alternate praise to Allah with a narration of
their own exploits.

This really exciting scene, and the more dangerous
shooting of the rapids by boat, are now ended with the
closing of the Barrage Gates, and the First Cataract has
sacrificed to the needs of the country another of its
traditional attractions.

It used to be possible to return to Assuan by a very
rough but exceedingly interesting pathway which ran
along the river-bank, and, especially toward evening
when all nature has taken on a richer colour and more
solemn mien, nothing could be more beautiful than the
panorama of the Cataract basin as here seen. This path
also has fallen a victim to the engineer, though fortunately the water still remains, and similar beauty of
scenery may be enjoyed by boat.

In such scenes and excursions time passes very
happily at Assuan, and, failing any other occupation, it
is quite sufficient just to live. The air is delightful,
and though hot it is too dry to be enervating. The
dryness, however, adds difficulty to the work of the
artist, and in painting my view of the Cataract from
Elephantine I was obliged repeatedly to soak my
picture in the river, and even then found it difficult to
spread a wash, so quickly did the surface dry. Though
the days are often hot (and I have known it to be
107Â° indoors on New Year's Day), the evenings are
delicious, and the nights, which are often cold, refresh
you after the heat of the day and prepare you for the
morrow.
