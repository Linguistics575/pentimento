portions of the Koran which are learnt by heart, and
it is very doubtful if the master is capable of anything

One of the evils of such lack of knowledge lies in
the inability of the fellahin to read books or papers,
and, being obliged to accept all extraneous information
at second hand, they are peculiarly liable to be misled
by false or prejudiced statements, often promulgated
among them by unscrupulous intriguers.

On the other hand, the education of the youth of
the great towns is now well looked after. Some years
ago I was asked by the Ministry of Public Instruction
to preside over a small commission appointed to consider the question and draw up a scheme of education
to be adopted in the Khedivial schools. The report
presented, and accepted by the Ministry, provided for
a very thorough and liberal system of education
through all the grades, from the primary to the most
advanced classes, and one sufficient to equip a boy for
any position in life. I am told that the scheme is
working well, and the Government has wisely introduced into the Education Department, as masters, gentlemen of the highest education and social position, so
that the youth of Cairo and the large towns are now
enjoying a training equal to many public! schools, and
with the advantage of association with and direction
by graduates of English universities.

Such an elaborate education is neither possible nor
necessary in the case of the agricultural masses, but a
great deal more should be done for them than has yet
