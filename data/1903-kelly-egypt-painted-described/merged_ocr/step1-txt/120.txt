CHAPTER IV

MOSQUES AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS

EVERY one who visits Cairo "does" the mosques
as a matter of course, and evinces a certain amount
of interest in what he sees. The blue tiles of Ibrahim
Aga, the splendid effect of the great doorway of the
Sultan Hassan Mosque, or the delicate ornament and
graceful minaret of Kait Bey are each in turn admired.
To how many of such visitors, however, does it occur
that in them is embodied much of the history of Cairo,
and that in its mosques and public buildings is the
most perfect expression of that elegant and distinctive
art which we call Saracenic? Here is an architecture
of well-defined periods, complete in its expression,
elaborate in the application of its ornament, of older
date than the Gothic style they admire and reverence
so much at home, and of which it is, to some extent at
least, the possible origin.

It is not within the province of this book to enter
into an elaborate history of the origin and development
of the style: the subject has been fully dealt with
elsewhere by experts. It will suffice for our purpose
