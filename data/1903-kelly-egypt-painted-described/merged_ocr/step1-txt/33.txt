Introductory

picturesque in each class of life, and endeavour to
convey some impression of the varied landscape the
country affords.

My first introduction to Egypt was in 1883, and
was ushered in in rather a startling manner. We were
still two or three hours' steaming distance before
land could possibly be in sight, when suddenly we
saw, inverted in the sky, a perfect miragic reproduction of Alexandria, in which Pharos Light, Ras-elTin Palace, and other prominent features were easily
distinguishable. The illusion continued for a considerable time, and eventually as suddenly disappeared, when,
an hour or two later, the real city slowly appeared above
the horizon! A good augury, surely, of the wonders
I hoped to discover on landing!

Though the journey from Alexandria to Cairo is
more convenient, it is desirable in some ways to land at
Port Said. The railway journey is no doubt longer,
but its tedium is relieved by a greater variety of scene
than I have experienced on any journey of the same
length. Even Port Said is not devoid of pictures, and
as an example of engineering skill and commercial
enterprise the Canal is always interesting. The
periodic games, with their red-tiled roofs peeping
from among the surrounding foliage, look pretty in the
sunlight; while the hybrid population thronging the
stations, and an occasional coastguard patrolling the
Canal on camel-back, enable you to realise the fact that
you have left the New World behind and are on the
threshold of the East. r
