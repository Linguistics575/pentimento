20." Riz-bi-leban," the usual rice arid milk which

invariably concludes a meal.

While eating, servants stood behind us, some with
lanterns, others with jars of rose-scented drinkingwater from which each one drank from time to time.
With the exception of the soup and the rice, which were
eaten with the same spoon, all food is taken with the
right hand, host and guest exchanging choice morsels
from time to time. Everything was excellently cooked
and served, and a certain amount of pretty ceremony
characterised the meal.

For the benefit of any who may be privileged to be
thus feasted, let me mention one point of table etiquette,
namely, that the diner should never eat of every dish,
or his host, supposing that he has not been satisfied,
will order the menu to be repeated from the beginning!
It may also be worth remembering that the penultimate
dish always consists of bores in some form, such as ribs
or knuckle; this is a warning to the diner that only
rice is to follow, so that now, or not at all, his appetite
must be appeased.

Rising independently as each one finishes, the same
ceremonial washing is repeated.

Our meal over, the servants and villagers present
finish all that remains of the repast, while we enjoy our
coffee and cigarettes among the cushions of the divan.
Fortunately politeness does not compel conversation,
and the guests if so wishful may rest in silence. t:
