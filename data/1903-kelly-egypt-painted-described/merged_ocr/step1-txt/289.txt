The First Cataract

partially executed obelisk which, destined to adorn
some temple, still remains undetached from the rock of
which it is a part. This is interesting in that it shows
the ancient method of quarrying; and one is moved to
speculate upon the cause which brought the work to
this abrupt conclusion.

For a certain distance your path follows the course
of an old Roman wall of sun-dried brick, originally of
great height and thickness, but now ruinous. How is
it, one is inclined to ask, that a people whose work was
usually characterised by so much solidarity and strength
should in Egypt be content to use so perishable a
material as this?

Presently you leave behind all trace of man and
traverse a desert strangely wild. The sand is greyish in
colour, and in all directions are low ranges of irregular
hills, composed of blocks of granite piled up in
indescribable confusion. Here and there are pinnacles,
formed by some huge rock curiously, and apparently
insecurely, balanced upon another as though placed
there by a hand; and individual stones occasionally
bear forms of weird suggestion, which adds to the
"uncanny" effect of it all. Not a pleasant bit of desert,
perhaps, but impressive and in its way fascinating.

The pylons of the temple eventually rise above the
rough ground before you, and a final gallop between
native huts and compounds brings you to the bank of
the river, where, resting under a sycamore, you can sit
and gaze upon the scene you have journeyed so far
to see.
