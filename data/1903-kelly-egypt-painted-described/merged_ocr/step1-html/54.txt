<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
French is now little spoken, except in the best shops<br/>
or at social functions, and few visitors will find much<br/>
occasion to speak Italian or the other languages in<br/>
daily use. English, however, is becoming more and<br/>
more spoken by the natives. Few of the dealers in<br/>
bazaars frequented by Europeans but can converse in<br/>
English, and most of the donkey-boys of Cairo talk<br/>
it freely.<br/>

If you want really to see Orientalism in Cairo, the<br/>
best plan is to pick up an intelligent donkey-boy and<br/>

lanes; while your donkey-boy is quite a good fellow<br/>
as a rule, and enlivens your ride by imparting all<br/>
kinds of superfluous information, some of which may<br/>
be true, but all of it generally entertaining. I prefer<br/>
him to the dragoman, also, because he usually knows<br/>
Cairo better; and once the principal mosques, etc., have<br/>
been visited, the real pleasure of your stay consists in<br/>
an unfettered exploration of the thousand odd corners<br/>
of the native quarters.<br/>
<br/>
Here every step reveals a new picture. Little<br/>
shops, protected from the sun by ragged awnings,<br/>
display goods and commodities of the most varied<br/>
description, among which, alas! you will notice a<br/>
goodly proportion of Manchester prints.<br/>

Here is a barber's shop with its fly-net drawn<br/>
across the door. The fruiterer arrays his brightly<br/>
