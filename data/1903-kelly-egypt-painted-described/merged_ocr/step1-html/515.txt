<span>Religion and Character of the Egyptians<br/>
<br/>
is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Muled-en-Nebee</span>, or birthday of the Prophet.<br/>
This always takes place in some open space outside the<br/>
town, and during the nine days of <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>continuance has<br/>
all the character of a large country fair, in which amusements and religious functions are curiously intermingled.<br/>
Of the latter, many of the most curious have one by<br/>
one been abandoned. Thus the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">d6seh</span>" has long<br/>
been prohibited. Formerly this function was the most<br/>
important of all, when the Sheykh of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saadiyeh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Darwishes </span>would ride on horseback over a long line<br/>
of devotees lying prostrate on the ground. I have<br/>
myself seen fanatics eat live scorpions, glowing charcoal,<br/>
and even chew up and swallow glass lamp-funnels;<br/>
while many others would cut themselves with knives,<br/>
etc., in a most sickening manner.<br/>
<br/>
These are now things of the past. There was one<br/>
observance, however, which I am sorry to see abandoned,<br/>
as it was both dramatic and impressive. I last witnessed<br/>
it in a long street close to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Husaneyn </span>Mosque.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>forget which festival it was, but for many hundred<br/>
yards the street was lined by two rows of men, squatting<br/>
on their haunches and facing each other, and crying<br/>
in unison "Allah! <span style="color: #0000FF;">Allah </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>"With each cry they would<br/>
bend forward and touch the ground with their foreheads, the first syllable of the name being said while<br/>
upright, and the second as the "salaam" was made.<br/>
The effect of this combined movement and chant, performed in absolute unison and with perfect regularity,<br/>
was most striking. Gradually, as the rapidity of the<br/>
motion was increased, many performers would fall<br/>
