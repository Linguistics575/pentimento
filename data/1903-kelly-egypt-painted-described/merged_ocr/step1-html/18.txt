heartily rendered to the proprietors of Black and White<br/>
and The Century Magazine for their kind permission to<br/>
repeat matter already published by them, and also to<br/>
the many owners of my work, who have so generously<br/>
allowed the reproduction of pictures in their possession<br/>
---a courteous and kindly co-operation without which<br/>
it would have been almost impossible to complete this<br/>
volume.<br/>
