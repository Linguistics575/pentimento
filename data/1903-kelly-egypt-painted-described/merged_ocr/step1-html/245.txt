<span>The N ile<br/>
<br/>
Seen by moonlight when the bare facts of its absolute<br/>
desolation are softened, it is indescribably weird and<br/>
mysterious. Here at any rate is one temple which<br/>
lends itself to poetic treatment. In all directions there<br/>
are pictures<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>the great pylon glowing in the setting sun,<br/>
the quiet repose of the sacred lake, or the majestic<br/>
aisles of the great hall, each is a subject which permits<br/>
of varied treatment. Surrounding the ruins are <span style="color: #ff0000;">palmgroves</span>, and human interest is picturesquely added in the<br/>
person of the native goatherd or Arab watchman, who<br/>
with long staff or gun patrols the precincts.<br/>
<br/>
Between Luxor and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak </span>is the well-known<br/>
avenue of sphinxes. Behind it to the east is another,<br/>
half hidden among the palm-trees, leading to a pylon<br/>
now in ruins. At its base, standing upon a pedestal of<br/>
granite, is a foot, well sculptured and of colossal proportions. Not much in itself, perhaps, but how imposing must have been the figure, of which nothing else<br/>
now remains but the scattered fragments of stone which<br/>
are piled high around its <span style="color: #0000FF;">base</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>Similarly the enormous<br/>
columns of the great hall, the lofty obelisks, and the<br/>
towering masses of the pylons inspire in the beholder<br/>
a feeling of reverential wonder at the greatness of the<br/>
minds which thought on such a scale.<br/>
<br/>
The dominant feeling with any one who explores<br/>
these ruins is the bigness of it all. Big, not only in its<br/>
conception, but in the overcoming of seemingly insurmountable difficulties of construction. Sixty feet in the<br/>
air the columns are supporting architraves formed of<br/>
enormous blocks of stone, each weighing perhaps twenty<br/>
<br/>
95<br/>
