<span>The First Cataract<br/>
<br/>
partially executed obelisk which, destined to adorn<br/>
some temple, still remains undetached from the rock of<br/>
which it is a part. This is interesting in that it shows<br/>
the ancient method of quarrying; and one is moved to<br/>
speculate upon the cause which brought the work to<br/>
this abrupt conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
For a certain distance your path follows the course<br/>
of an old Roman wall of sun-dried brick, originally of<br/>
great height and thickness, but now ruinous. How is<br/>
it, one is inclined to ask, that a people whose work was<br/>
usually characterised by so much solidarity and strength<br/>
should in Egypt be <span style="color: #0000FF;">content </span>to use so perishable a<br/>
material as <span style="color: #0000FF;">this</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?<br/>
<br/>
</span>Presently you leave behind all trace of man and<br/>
traverse a desert strangely wild. The sand is greyish in<br/>
colour, and in all directions are low ranges of irregular<br/>
hills, composed of blocks of granite piled up in<br/>
indescribable confusion. Here and there are pinnacles,<br/>
formed by some huge rock curiously, and apparently<br/>
insecurely, balanced upon another as though placed<br/>
there by a hand; and individual stones occasionally<br/>
bear forms of weird suggestion, which adds to the<br/>
"uncanny" effect of it all. Not a pleasant bit of desert,<br/>
perhaps, but impressive and in its way fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
The pylons of the temple eventually rise above the<br/>
rough ground before you, and a final gallop between<br/>
native huts and compounds brings you to the bank of<br/>
the river, where, resting under a sycamore, you can sit<br/>
and gaze upon the scene you have journeyed so far<br/>
to see.<br/>
