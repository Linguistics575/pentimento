</span>sails used, vessels would frequently be "<span style="color: #0000FF;">blanketed </span>"by<br/>
the high banks and palm-groves, whereas the enormous<br/>
height of the lateen sail overtops both trees and buildings, and enables it to catch the breeze even during the<br/>
lowest period of the river.<br/>
<br/>
During flood-time all these vessels, now high and<br/>
dry, will be floated off the banks, and make their<br/>
first entry into the life of the river, bedecked with<br/>
coloured flags on which are embroidered the names<br/>
of "Allah," "Mahomet," "Hassan wa <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hussa</span>,"<br/>
etc. This same flood, however, will often carry away<br/>
large portions of the banks, and even partially destroy<br/>
the village built upon it. A great deal of damage is<br/>
done in this way, and must entail a heavy loss upon<br/>
the villagers. Nowadays spurs of stone are being<br/>
built at frequent intervals, so as to turn the main<br/>
current into mid-stream and so preserve the banks,<br/>
while those who have suffered loss in this way have<br/>
the first claim upon whatever land may be deposited<br/>
on the opposite side or below them.<br/>
<br/>
Each year the course of the Nile changes, and<br/>
as the river falls the new channels have to be discovered afresh. This makes navigation difficult, and<br/>
it requires a practised eye to tell by the nature of<br/>
the ripple where is deep water and where a shoal.<br/>
Often, and particularly in a breeze, the water cannot<br/>
well be told in this way, and the "midra," or sounding pole, has to be brought into play, and with the<br/>
cry of "Ali" (high, or shallow) engines are <span style="color: #0000FF;">stopped<br/>
</span>and a new course tried<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
