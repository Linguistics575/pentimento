is only attracted by curiosity, and bears you no ill-will.<br/>
A little tact and good-humour on your part will get<br/>
over the difficulty pleasantly, and the remarks you will<br/>
overhear among your audience are often both amusing<br/>
and instructive.<br/>

While painting the mosque door which illustrates<br/>
this chapter, a native of my acquaintance passing by<br/>
stopped to salaam, and then remarked<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>"Why,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Effendim</span>, do you sit here all day in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dust</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span>"<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, I am painting, as you see."<br/>
<br/>
"But why paint that poor little mosque<span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span>"<br/>
<br/>
"Because I like the colour of it," I replied.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Yes," he said, "but it is only dirt"<br/>
<br/>
"It is beautiful, for all that," I respond; and presently, a new idea having struck him, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">asks </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l<br/>
<br/>
</span>"And what will you do with it when it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span>"<br/>
<br/>
I explained that I would take it to England and sell<br/>
it, that people liked such things with which to ornament<br/>
their houses.<br/>
<br/>
"Salaamat, and how much will you get for <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>"<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>Oh! perhaps <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lys</span>"<br/>
<br/>
"Wonderful! "he exclaimed. "Why, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">would </span>not<br/>
give you thirty pence! But then," he added, "I<br/>
suppose I know nothing about it."<br/>
<br/>
It always strikes me as curious how incapable the<br/>
Eastern usually is of appreciating pictorial art; he sees<br/>
no resemblance whatever to the object delineated, and<br/>
it would please him just as well upside down. I have<br/>
met exceptions, but this is the general rule, though he<br/>
always appears to take a great interest in your <span style="color: #ff0000;">occupa<br/>
