the young, while their elders traded their live-stock<br/>

I am glad to think that since my last visit the<br/>
cemetery has been removed to higher ground some<br/>

really beautiful, and every bend furnishes a pleasant<br/>
vista with a possible surprise in store.<br/>

stored our tents and other camp equipment. As a west<br/>
