<br/>
Prophet are indulgence in opium, hashish, or tobacco,<br/>
as well as intoxicants of any kind. Hashish and alcohol<br/>
work more havoc among the natives than any other<br/>
influence, yet every caf√© will supply the former, and no<br/>
restriction is placed upon the sale of drink, which, in<br/>
Cairo and other centres, has such a <span style="color: #ff0000;">demoralising </span>effect<br/>
among the Moslem population; and the institution of<br/>
a liquor licence and the prohibition of opiates would<br/>
be at least one move in the direction of diminution of<br/>
crime.<br/>
<br/>
More than all else, however, would be the force of<br/>
example on the part of the European population, and I<br/>
am glad to think that Englishmen at any rate have set<br/>
such an example to the people. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span>highest to lowest<br/>
of the Government servants, each has been actuated by<br/>
a sense of responsibility beyond the reach of bribes;<br/>
honesty and integrity <span style="color: #ff0000;">characterise </span>every department of<br/>
the administration, while justice and good faith on the<br/>
part of all have inspired in the mind of the native a<br/>
feeling of confidence and respect.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, I cannot do better than give an<br/>
illustration in proof of this. A native, wishing to sell a<br/>
horse whose soundness was under discussion, exhausted<br/>
all the asseverations in his repertoire without convincing<br/>
the doubter. F <span style="color: #ff0000;">inally </span>the bargain was clinched, as with<br/>
raised hand he exclaimed, "Ana kelm wahed, ana kelm<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Inglisi</span>," which may be roughly translated as<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>"I speak the truth, I speak as an Englishman! "<br/>
