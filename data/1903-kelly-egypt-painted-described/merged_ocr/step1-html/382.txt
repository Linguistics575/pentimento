<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt'<br/>
<br/>
</span>is a continuous delight, in which form and <span style="color: #0000FF;">c<br/>
</span>changing atmospheric effect fill every hour of<br/>
with picture subjects hardly possible of <span style="color: #0000FF;">attainment<br/>
<br/>
</span>What could be more restful than the camp<br/>
be <span style="color: #ff0000;">enjdyed </span>beside these quiet waterways, where n<br/>
is found to mar the poetic beauty of surroundings<br/>
the quiet water alternately repeats or foils<span style="color: #ff0000;">!<br/>
