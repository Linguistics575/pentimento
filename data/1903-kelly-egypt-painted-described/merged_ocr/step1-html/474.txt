into an amble by the encouraging endearments those<br/>
parched lips can scarcely utter. The man has won,<br/>
but it will be many days before he will be able to enjoy<br/>
that first ride when he and his now docile friend will<br/>
think and move as one.<br/>

Horsemanship is one of the cardinal virtues with<br/>
the Bedawin, who will refer to their neighbours as<br/>
"those dirty Egyptians who cannot ride a horse," and<br/>
much of your prestige among them depends upon your<br/>
ability to ride their desert-bred beauties. It is curious<br/>
that, no matter how well-behaved and gentle a horse<br/>
may be with his master, he nearly always rebels against<br/>
a strange rider, who will have to reconquer the beast<br/>
for himself.<br/>

The Arabs are universally good horsemen, and<br/>
keenly enjoy equestrian sports. One pretty trick they<br/>
do, is to mark out a course by placing water-pots on<br/>
either side alternately, and some little distance apart.<br/>
Then, urging his horse into a furious gallop, the rider<br/>
will hang from the saddle and pick up a "<span style="color: #ff0000;">ghouleh</span>"<br/>
from one side, and then, swinging over, place it on the<br/>
ground on the other, while at the same time picking<br/>
up another. This is repeated over and over again<br/>
with wonderful precision and rapidity, and seldom at<br/>
the expense of a cracked pot.<br/>
<br/>
Another trick, rather disconcerting to the stranger,<br/>
is to charge straight at you as you stand, stopping<br/>
suddenly just in front of you with the horse's nose<br/>
almost touching yours, or else with a quick swerve avoid<br/>
