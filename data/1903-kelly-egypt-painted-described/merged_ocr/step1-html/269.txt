</span>This temple, dedicated to the worship of the<br/>
crocodile, is very appropriately built on the water's<br/>
edge, its pylon standing on the very brink. What<br/>
remains of the temple is small in extent, but the inscriptions on the walls are particularly interesting, and the<br/>
capitals and deep cornice richly carved. Standing as it<br/>
does on the river, and entirely free from obstruction,<br/>
Kom Ombos is a striking feature in a landscape otherwise somewhat lacking in character, and, especially in<br/>
the softer evening effects, forms a good subject for the<br/>
painter.<br/>
<br/>
As we proceed, the former grandeur of the scenery<br/>
is left behind, and the limestone mountains which have<br/>
been our daily companions from Cairo, and to which so<br/>
much of the beauty of the river is due, will shortly<br/>
disappear to give place to the granite hills and golden<br/>
sands of Nubia. Presently a bend in the river discloses<br/>
the palm-groves of Elephantine, and the town of<br/>
Assuan surrounded by the hills which here close in<br/>
upon the river, and mark the frontier of Egypt proper<br/>
and the southern boundary of the Cataract.<br/>
