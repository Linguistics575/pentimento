<span>Condition of the People<br/>
<br/>
insupportable burden, has found the treasury considerably enriched. Public works of the first importance<br/>
have been carried on, not by forced labour, but at fair<br/>
wages; rights of property or persons are respected, and<br/>
the laws wisely and impartially administered.<br/>
<br/>
But while in many ways the material prosperity of<br/>
the people has increased, the moral influence of an<br/>
honest and enlightened administration is no less marked.<br/>
The strenuous effort to abolish every abuse, equal<br/>
justice for rich and poor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>scrupulous regard for<br/>
religious and racial customs, and the evident sincerity<br/>
and sympathy of the dominant power, have given to the<br/>
people a new sense of security, and have created in them<br/>
the desire to help themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Already richer than ever in their history, every one<br/>
seems to be striving after independence. Little hoards<br/>
of savings are dug up from their hiding-places for<br/>
investment, and there is a keen demand for land.<br/>
Large acreages of reclaimed land have <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>bought in<br/>
this way, thus adding to the productiveness of the<br/>
country, as well as restoring to circulation large sums<br/>
of money previously withdrawn.<br/>
<br/>
So far, England has well fulfilled her trust, and,<br/>
though some appointments which have recently been<br/>
made have provoked criticism, Egypt is probably the<br/>
best administered country in the world to-day, where,<br/>
free from the obligations of party politics, the best<br/>
man available is set to carry out a given work; and<br/>
it must be acknowledged that he nearly always does<br/>
it well.<br/>
