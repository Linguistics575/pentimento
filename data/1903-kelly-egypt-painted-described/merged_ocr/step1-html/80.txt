<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
In the Muski, the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">caboot</span>" or wooden roof which<br/>
formerly spanned the street has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">removed</span>, and<br/>
the small but attractive native shops, with their oldworld superstructure, have to a great extent been<br/>
replaced by large plate-glass windows and modern<br/>
fronts. The street has been practically rebuilt, and<br/>
the Muski of the long ago is no more.<br/>
<br/>
Even the dog-scavengers of former times have given<br/>
place to the "Cairo Sanitary Transport Co." of to-day;<br/>
and though no doubt the latter is a vast improvement<br/>
upon the earlier primitive state of things, its advent<br/>
marked the disappearance of another picturesque feature<br/>
of Cairo street life.<br/>
<br/>
I well remember how by day these dogs would<br/>
lie about the streets lazily blinking and sleeping in<br/>
the sun, too indolent often to eat the scraps thrown<br/>
to them, and not infrequently being run over and<br/>
killed by passing vehicles. At night, however, they<br/>
formed dangerous packs of hunters, and I have more<br/>
than once been chased by them. Each pack had its<br/>
own particular quarter, and was never known to<br/>
cross into that of another, and the fiercest onslaught<br/>
would suddenly cease when this imaginary line of<br/>
demarcation <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>reached. In the town they are a<br/>
thing of the past, but they still live in the warrens<br/>
beyond <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fostat </span>and the Gibel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Achmar1 </span>at Abbasiyeh.<br/>
<br/>
A native official of my acquaintance had a very<br/>
unpleasant experience of them some years ago. We<br/>
were both dining at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zeitiin</span>, and while I returned<br/>
