<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
ornate "mihrab" is credited with healing virtue, and<br/>
any day men and women may be seen <span style="color: #ff0000;">rubbiilg </span>lemons<br/>
on one of its pilasters, and licking up the moisture in<br/>
the firm belief that a cure will ensue. A little stick<br/>
hangs on the railing of the tomb; this is used to cure<br/>
fools or idiots, by striking them on the head. Women<br/>
also bring their ailing children here for relief. In this<br/>
case water is poured into a large porphyry bowl, and<br/>
with another piece of the same stone they grind until<br/>
the water is red and muddy, the mixture being given<br/>
to the children with absolute confidence in its medicinal<br/>
property.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Mosque at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biilak </span>also has peculiar sanctity.<br/>
I purposed painting it some years ago, but my servant<br/>
warned me that it would be useless my making the<br/>
attempt. "Why so <span style="color: #0000FF;">P </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>I asked, and he gravely informed<br/>
me that "once an artist tried to do so, and a stone fell<br/>
from the minaret and killed him; on another occasion<br/>
the water of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'meydaah</span>,' or tank, had turned to<br/>
blood; and he was sure <span style="color: #ff0000;">i </span>that whatever I might paint<br/>
during the day'Allah' would obliterate by night,<br/>
even if nothing worse befell." It so happens that, other<br/>
work interfering, I have never yet been able to carry<br/>
out my intention, and so disabuse my servant's mind<br/>
of its curious belief.<br/>
<br/>
It is said that for a year the devout Moslem may<br/>
worship each day in a different mosque without completing the round of Cairo's religious edifices. This<br/>
statement is certainly well inside the mark, there being<br/>
probably four hundred or more recognised mosques in<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">52<br/>
