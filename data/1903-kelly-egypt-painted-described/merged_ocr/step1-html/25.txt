Nile water must return." So says <span style="color: #0000FF;">ad </span>old Egyptian<br/>
proverb, the truth of which has certainly been exemplified in my own case; for after many years of<br/>
residence, I find myself still enamoured of a country<br/>
which may with some truth be called the world's<br/>
wonderland.<br/>
<br/>
It is not of course within the power of every one<br/>
to repeat his visit, but probably few of the many<br/>
thousands who annually "drink Nile water <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>are without the desire at least of again experiencing its subtle<br/>
and elusive charm.<br/>
<br/>
From the earliest days Egypt has been a centre of<br/>
historical and political interest, and to a large extent<br/>
has been the nursery of the world's art and civilisation;<br/>
but whether the attracting cause be the glamour of its<br/>
romantic history, or the physical enjoyment of its<br/>
climate, generation after generation of travellers is<br/>
irresistibly drawn to it, and all, from Herodotus to<br/>
