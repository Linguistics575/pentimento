the slow changing of their colouration as the light varies.<br/>
Clear and sharp against the blue sky at mid-day,<br/>
every serration and stratification is clearly defined.<br/>
Each horizontal layer holds <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little drift-sand or<br/>
disintegrated rock which adds to the range of local<br/>
colour. The glittering high lights relieve themselves<br/>
against the warm-tinted mass, which is again broken<br/>
by the purple-blue shadows of projections. The day<br/>
passes, and the declining sun warms the colour of the<br/>
whole, losing at the same time much of the sharp<br/>
detail of mid-day, while long-drawn reflections repeat<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruddy-tinted </span>hills in a limpid mirror of eau-du-Nil.<br/>

Sunset comes, and the shaded banks, crested with<br/>
verdure, are relieved strongly by the now glowing<br/>
mass of rock beyond, against which idle sails, hanging<br/>
in graceful folds from the spars, appear a delicate<br/>
violet. The boats'-crews, plying crookedly-built sweeps<br/>
with intermittent stroke, propel their vessels sleepily<br/>

weird singing of a supercargo. Otherwise the river<br/>
is silent, and pelican and ibis fish undisturbed in the<br/>
shallows, or contentedly plume themselves on the<br/>
slowly appearing mud-banks.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time the purple earth-shadow climbs<br/>
the mellow eastern sky, until on the final disappearance<br/>
of the sun begins the most wonderful transformation<br/>
of all. For a short time everything is grey against<br/>
the sky beyond, but after an interval of twenty minutes<br/>
or so a second glow slowly appears upon the hills, and,<br/>
