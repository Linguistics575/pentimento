<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Presently, from the distance, came the sound of<br/>
gathering hordes, the thunder of whose approach<br/>
culminated in their wild <span style="color: #0000FF;">salutation </span>of the sheykh under<br/>
whose banner they were gathered.<br/>
<br/>
Then were described the incidents of the long months<br/>
of the desert journey. Heat, thirst, hunger, and dust<br/>
by day, and the eternal silence of the starlight, broken<br/>
only by the distant howl of wolf or jackal; the waxing<br/>
and waning of the moons, or the excitements and forays<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">march</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-each </span>in turn, by voice and accompaniment, were graphically represented. Hour after hour<br/>
this went on, until, after four hours of close attention,<br/>
fatigue prevented my listening to its conclusion, and<br/>
at midnight I retired. A wonderful epic, admirably<br/>
rendered, and occupying in all about eight hours in its<br/>
performance, it formed a splendid theme for dramatist<br/>
or composer.<br/>
<br/>
This position of tribal poet is hereditary. Each<br/>
member of the tribe contributes to the bard's support,<br/>
and his sons are taught from infancy to perpetuate<br/>
their songs and legends.<br/>
<br/>
Though their nomadic life militates against education, the Bedawin are very much alive to its advantages,<br/>
and quickly glean scraps of knowledge from those they<br/>
meet with in their wanderings. I have been struck<br/>
with the intelligence with which they grasp the salient<br/>
point of any matter under discussion, and their interest<br/>
in countries and conditions of life quite foreign to<br/>
them.<br/>
