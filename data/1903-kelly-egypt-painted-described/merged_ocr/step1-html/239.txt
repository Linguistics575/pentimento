<span>The Nile<br/>
<br/>
Approaching with great rapidity, it was soon apparent<br/>
that a cloud of sand surmounted by heavy rain-clouds<br/>
was rushing before a squall of wind. The weatherwise immediately left the stand and sought shelter<br/>
in the stables close by; but before all present realised<br/>
the danger, or could effect a retreat, the storm broke<br/>
upon us in a blinding drift of sand, almost immediately<br/>
followed by a downpour of rain. On account of the<br/>
dense mass of dust in the air the rain reached the<br/>
ground in the form of liquid mud, which, while causing<br/>
the usual discomfort incidental to a wetting, was also,<br/>
Iam afraid, responsible for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruination </span>of many gay<br/>
frocks and feathers.<br/>
<br/>
To the student of its monuments, the special<br/>
interest of the Nile begins when, after a journey of<br/>
4.50 miles, Luxor is reached. Here the mountains on<br/>
either side fall away, leaving a large alluvial plain, upon<br/>
which, on both sides of the river, formerly stood the<br/>
hundred-gated Thebes, once the centre of religious<br/>
influence in Upper Egypt, and unquestionably the largest<br/>
and most magnificent of its cities.<br/>
<br/>
The ancient city has disappeared, and we can now<br/>
form no idea of its plan or general appearance; but<br/>
its ruined temples, the extent and grandeur of which<br/>
impress the visitor strongly, are monuments to its<br/>
former greatness and a record of the history of those<br/>
ancient days.<br/>
<br/>
Every epoch is represented. Temples of Seti and<br/>
Rameses have within them Coptic church and Moslem<br/>
mosque, while all that remains of the Roman <span style="color: #ff0000;">occupa<br/>
