housed. Though the hotel was, and still is, excellent,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>those days seem primitive when compared with to-day,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">l </span>when the addition of two of the largest and <span style="color: #0000FF;">best-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>the requirements of the increasing numbers who now<br/>
seek health and enjoyment in its deliciously pure air.<br/>
The old hotel stands in the main street (which<br/>
forms a kind of promenade along the river-side), and is<br/>
a curious, old-fashioned building, with an interior court<br/>
from which open the public rooms and the several<br/>
staircases leading to the upper stories. It has a kind of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">i </span>quaintness which always pleases me, and certainly is<br/>
more in keeping with the spirit of the old frontier town<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>than its modern rivals. The street itself is wide, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">l</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>well shaded by palms and sycamores, which grow along<br/>
the Nile bank and sometimes encroach upon the roadway. Below are the remains of Cleopatra's Bath; and<br/>
groups of sailing-boats constantly pass between you and<br/>
Elephantine Island, green with the verdure of <span style="color: #ff0000;">palmgroves </span>which stand out against the golden sand-drifts<br/>
lying on the western hills. To-day this former<br/>
channel is dry except at high Nile, and a busy market<br/>
animates banks where steamers used to pass. Should<br/>
you have nothing else to do, it was sufficient amusement to sit under the portico of the hotel and enjoy<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>the passing life, or spend an hour in bargaining for a<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">kiirbash</span>" or a string of beads. Lower down the<br/>

white in the sun, and some are perched upon the<br/>
