<span>Egypt<br/>
as it fell, blistered hands and face and parched us all<br/>
with thirst.<br/>
<br/>
A little farther on, the hot sun had evaporated the<br/>
water, leaving a sediment of slime covered with a<br/>
crust of salt. As you broke the surface in travelling,<br/>
the black mud gave off most horrible <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours</span>, and at<br/>
the same time liberated swarms of small stinging flies<br/>
which made life unbearable; or again, pools of water<br/>
formed incubators for the myriads of mosquitoes which<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">novered </span>over them. Nothing whatever in the shape of<br/>
cultivation or animal life breaks the sadness of this<br/>
dead land.<br/>
<br/>
Away to the north is the once fruitful "Field of<br/>
Zoan," overlooking which the ruins of Tanis remain to<br/>
prove a former period of greatness. Here also bad<br/>
water coming from higher lands has killed the once<br/>
fertile plain. It is dead, and not even weeds will grow<br/>
upon its sun-cracked soil. Here can still be seen the<br/>
terraces and water-channels, and the little runnels in<br/>
the gardens, and all the evidences of a former cultivation which Abraham once looked upon. I have seen<br/>
nothing in ruined city or temple which speaks half so<br/>
pathetically of its past as this sun-parched "<span style="color: #0000FF;">mummy </span>"<br/>
land.<br/>
<br/>
In between these barren lands are small patches of<br/>
cultivation, where a few poor people strive to keep<br/>
alive; and in one of these settlements, while riding to<br/>
join my Bedawin friends, I made the worst meal I ever<br/>
had in Egypt: all that could be provided was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">small<br/>
</span>bit of bread and a few ounces of sour milk between<br/>
