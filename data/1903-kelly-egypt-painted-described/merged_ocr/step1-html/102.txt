<br/>
Purchasing in the bazaars is a matter not to be<br/>
undertaken lightly, and requires time and patience.<br/>
Except in one or two shops which are principally<br/>
frequented by Europeans, fixed prices are unknown,<br/>
and the article is only worth what can be obtained for<br/>
it. Extravagant prices are often asked, to which you<br/>
counter by offering a quarter of the sum as a basis of<br/>
discussion, and sometimes days may be spent in negotiation before a bargain is made.<br/>
<br/>
I remember some time ago, while painting in the<br/>
carpet bazaar, I found an American lady whom I knew<br/>
slightly, in hopeless despair over the price demanded<br/>
for a really beautiful rug upon which she had set her<br/>
affections. I quietly induced her to go away, and,<br/>
taking up the negotiation on her behalf, eventually<br/>
secured it for <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-third </span>of the sum originally asked.<br/>
The lady was happy, and the dealer perfectly content,<br/>
knowing that he could not have got more. Bargaining<br/>
is a game thoroughly enjoyed on both sides, and, if<br/>
played with proper patience and good feeling, productive of mutual admiration, if not respect. Beware<br/>
of haste, however. There is an Egyptian proverb,<br/>
"El agela min esh <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shaitan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">( </span>Haste is from the devil),<br/>
and shopping in the bazaars seems specially to come<br/>
within the ban. For instance, a gentleman, no doubt<br/>
pressed for time, was making a purchase here, and at<br/>
once paid the price asked, and hurried away. I found<br/>
the dealer presently in tears, and asked what ailed <span style="color: #0000FF;">him</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
