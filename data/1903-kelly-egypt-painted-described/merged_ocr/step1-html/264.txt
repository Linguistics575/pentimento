showing how education, and the desire for education, is<br/>
spreading in the country.<br/>
<br/>
As we steam southward the scenery changes in<br/>
character. The hills are lower, and have little of that<br/>
boldness which formerly impressed us. The banks also<br/>
are less precipitous, and though of great height are<br/>
more shelving, stretching in big sweeps from the water<br/>
to the belt of trees which marks high-water level, the<br/>
difference between low Nile and flood being about<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">forty-five </span>feet.<br/>
<br/>
Irrigation here is increasingly difficult as the Nile<br/>
falls. Each drop in the level requires the erection of<br/>
another shadoof, and the cutting of a long and gradually<br/>
deepening drain by which to carry water to the first.<br/>
Sometimes three, and even four, shadoofs will be required to connect the receding water with the thirsty<br/>
land above; each shadoof is worked by one or more<br/>
men or boys, and proves a heavy drain upon the <span style="color: #ff0000;">laboursupply </span>of the farm. Under a powerful sun it is terribly<br/>
hard work, and the labourers are practically nude, their<br/>
well-set figures and glistening skins shining in the sun<br/>
like classic bronzes.<br/>
<br/>
The principal crop appears to be maize, but as usual<br/>
the banks left by the falling water are planted in beans,<br/>
onions, and water-melons. While date-palms are becoming less frequent, the castor-oil plant is more in<br/>
evidence, and looks very gay in its scarlet blossoms<br/>
and luscious foliage, and round about Kom Ombos<br/>
particularly I notice large areas under this crop.<br/>
