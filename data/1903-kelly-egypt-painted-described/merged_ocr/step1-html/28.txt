<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt<br/>
<br/>
</span>exploration of the monuments is one process of gradual<br/>
disillusionment.<br/>
<br/>
So then the visitor is constantly experiencing a series<br/>
of new impressions, which, though contrary to <span style="color: #0000FF;">anticipations</span>, are more satisfying and real. He is discovering Egypt for himself, and treasures the knowledge<br/>
gained by charming experience.<br/>
<br/>
To its sunlit atmosphere, therefore, and this sense<br/>
of fresh discovery, may be attributed much of the<br/>
glamour that invests Egypt with a magnetic attraction which draws all men thither, and renders the<br/>
country a mine of inexhaustible pictorial wealth.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking broadly, Egypt may be divided into three<br/>
separate spheres: the Nile, the Delta, and the Desert.<br/>
The first is the happy touring-ground of all, and it<br/>
may seem almost an act of supererogation to attempt<br/>
any description of scenes so well known as Cairo and<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>Valley; and yet even here may be discovered<br/>
some new fact or fresh point of view which may<br/>
interest. The two latter, however, are practically<br/>
unknown subjects to the generality of visitors, and<br/>
present a native life and local characteristics which<br/>
differ essentially from each other, as well as from the<br/>
well-worn tourist track.<br/>
<br/>
The primitive simplicity of the "fellahin" in the<br/>
Delta has a charm not to be found among the inhabitants of the large towns, while it is only in the Desert<br/>
itself that Arab life may be met with; and it will be the<br/>
object of this volume, so far as may be, to reflect what<br/>
has for so many years struck me as characteristic and<br/>
