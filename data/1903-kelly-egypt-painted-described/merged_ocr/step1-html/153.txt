dish, is ordered to defray the cost of rebuilding it,<br/>
and must also pay a fine to the Cadi for having placed<br/>
a temptation in the way of a true believer, and for<br/>
having contaminated the food of the faithful.<br/>
<br/>
The net result being that both baker and Christian<br/>
were mulcted in penalties, the Cadi alone being enriched by the amount of the fines imposed, besides<br/>
enjoying a forbidden luxury in the sacred name of<br/>
Justice.<br/>

The Cadi's duties were many, and included a<br/>
general supervision of the bazaars and shops, where<br/>
a rigid control was kept over traders, and even the<br/>
price of food-stuffs was determined by him.1 In the<br/>

instruments of torture and death, with which summary<br/>
justice was wont to be meted out to offenders. The<br/>
picturesqueness of those days has perhaps to some<br/>
extent disappeared, but the Cadi's court still continues<br/>
to exercise its functions, and will still often furnish<br/>
amusement to the onlooker.<br/>
<br/>
To the uninitiated the administration of justice presents many difficulties, among which I may instance the<br/>
nature of the oath to be taken by witnesses. Different<br/>
sects have varying customs, and an oath which would<br/>
morally bind one, exercises no control whatever upon<br/>
another. Thus one man will swear "Bi'llahi, bi'llahi<br/>
'tanti, <span style="color: #0000FF;">bi'llahi </span>talat" (By God, by second God, by<br/>
third God, or, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Three </span>times I swear by God), and still lie,<br/>
though perhaps some other form would be considered<br/>
