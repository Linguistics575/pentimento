<br/>
The vegetable life of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">canals </span>is pretty, and you<br/>
recognise many familiar plants, while others are strange.<br/>
Kingfishers and wagtails are numerous, and among the<br/>
irrigated fields the "paddy bird "gleams white against<br/>
the black soil. Songbirds there are none in Egypt,<br/>
and, with the exception of the hoopoo and Kingfisher,<br/>
few can boast any special beauty of plumage; but in<br/>
the distant lowing of cattle, the drone of honey-bees,<br/>
and the lively chirrup of the grasshopper, the stillness<br/>
is pleasantly broken, and you hardly notice the absence<br/>
of song<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>The whole effect of this pastoral panorama is one of<br/>
quiet industry and mellow content, in which the noisy<br/>
railway strikes the only note of discord.<br/>
<br/>
As a contrast to this bucolic peacefulness, the wayside stations furnish subjects of a different kind. The<br/>
platforms are crowded by natives, some travelling, but<br/>
mostly idlers, for the passing of the mail is an event.<br/>
Here is the portly "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sheykh-el-Belad</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>1 exchanging<br/>

Bedawin, too proud to mingle with the noisy "fellah,"<br/>
though probably <span style="color: #ff0000;">sympathising </span>with their <span style="color: #ff0000;">Witticisms </span>at<br/>
the expense of the unbeliever. Little girls crying<br/>
