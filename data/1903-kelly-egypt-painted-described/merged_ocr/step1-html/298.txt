<br/>
</span>which they alternate praise to Allah with a narration of<br/>
their own exploits.<br/>
<br/>
This really exciting scene, and the more dangerous<br/>
shooting of the rapids by boat, are now ended with the<br/>
closing of the Barrage Gates, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">First </span>Cataract has<br/>
sacrificed to the needs of the country another of its<br/>
traditional attractions.<br/>
<br/>
It used to be possible to return to Assuan by a very<br/>
rough but exceedingly interesting pathway which ran<br/>
along the river-bank, and, especially toward evening<br/>
when all nature has taken on a richer colour and more<br/>
solemn mien, nothing could be more beautiful than the<br/>
panorama of the Cataract basin as here seen. This path<br/>
also has fallen a victim to the engineer, though fortunately the water still remains, and similar beauty of<br/>
scenery may be enjoyed by boat.<br/>
<br/>
In such scenes and excursions time passes very<br/>
happily at Assuan, and, failing any other occupation, it<br/>
is quite sufficient just to <span style="color: #0000FF;">live</span>. The air is delightful,<br/>
and though hot it is too dry to be enervating. The<br/>
dryness, however, adds difficulty to the work of the<br/>
artist, and in painting my view of the Cataract from<br/>
Elephantine I was obliged repeatedly to soak my<br/>
picture in the river, and even then found it difficult to<br/>
spread a wash, so quickly did the surface dry. Though<br/>
the days are often hot (and I have known it to be<br/>
107Â° indoors on New Year's Day), the evenings are<br/>
delicious, and the nights, which are often cold, refresh<br/>
you after the heat of the day and prepare you for the<br/>
morrow.<br/>
