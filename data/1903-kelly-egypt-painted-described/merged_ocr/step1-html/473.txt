iron drum in which they roast the coffee-berries on a<br/>
fire of "<span style="color: #0000FF;">cabs</span>"; and children, brightly dressed, play<br/>
"peep-bo "round the tents!<br/>
<br/>
Such are some of the pictures close to hand. Mount<br/>
your horse or camel and follow the men and you will<br/>
find more stirring ones. Here is a bunch of colts<br/>
which must be broken in. Beautiful in their action and<br/>
innocent of restraint, at first they playfully resist all<br/>
efforts to coax the bridle over their heads. Finally,<br/>
one is saddled and bridled, and the pretty beast begins<br/>
to realise that a period in his life is past, and now<br/>
begins a struggle for supremacy with man. Taking<br/>
advantage of its momentary surprise, the Arab quickly<br/>
mounts and gathers up the reins. For an instant it<br/>
is absolutely still with pent-up indignation; then, with<br/>
a sudden bound which sometimes bursts the girths and<br/>
leaves the rider in the dust, the horse breaks into a<br/>
terrific gallop, in which it fights and plunges in a vain<br/>
endeavour to get rid of its unaccustomed load. As<br/>
suddenly as it began, it will put its two front feet<br/>
together and stop dead; then, should this not be<br/>
sufficient, will perhaps begin to rear, or jump quickly<br/>
from side to side. Every trick is tried, but all of no<br/>
avail; and finally it breaks into a long flying stride as<br/>
though to run for ever across the scudding sand, and<br/>
so to leave behind it the horrid nightmare which has so<br/>
suddenly come upon it.<br/>
<br/>
An hour or two later, an exhausted man, whose<br/>
bloodshot eyes and drawn face testify to the severity<br/>
of the fight, rides slowly into camp on a dejected horse,<br/>
