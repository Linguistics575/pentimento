<span>CHAPTER <span style="color: #ff0000;">VIII<br/>
</span>THE LOWER <span style="color: #ff0000;">NILE<br/>
<br/>
</span>I WONDER how many of the thousands who annu<br/>
"do" the Nile trip have the enterprise to <span style="color: #0000FF;">explore'<br/>
</span>lower reaches? Picnic parties to the Barrage<br/>
frequent enough, but this great dam <span style="color: #ff0000;">represents </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">r<br/>
</span>the world at large Ultima Thule in that direction.'<br/>
And yet the lower river, though lacking many <span style="color: #0000FF;">poi<br/>
</span>of interest the Upper Nile affords, is well <span style="color: #0000FF;">worth<br/>
</span>visit, and has a peculiar charm of its own<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>I confess that I had little idea of the interest <span style="color: #0000FF;">attack<br/>
</span>ing to this, to me, unknown waterway, until a f<br/>
years ago. On the invitation of a high <span style="color: #ff0000;">Governm<br/>
</span>official, I accompanied him in his yacht upon a <span style="color: #ff0000;">tour </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">c </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Li<br/>
</span>inspection of the lower river and the coast towns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">anA<br/>
</span>joining the steamer at Kasr-en-Nil, we were soon p<br/>
the Barrage and embarking upon what was to me<br/>
voyage of discovery<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Already, though only a few miles below Cairo,<br/>
great difference is noticeable. Progressing by <span style="color: #0000FF;">h<br/>
</span>sweeping curves, the river is almost entirely <span style="color: #ff0000;">enclo<br/>
</span>within its high banks, which, though devoid of pal<br/>
are fringed with big sycamores, thorns, acacia, <span style="color: #0000FF;">an<br/>
