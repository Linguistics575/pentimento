<br/>
Abdul Aziz means The Slave or Servant of the Beneficent<br/>
<br/>
One.<br/>
Abd-el-Rahman "The Servant of the Most Compassionate.<br/>
Abdullah "The Servant of God.<br/>
Nasrullah "The Victory of God.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Habibullah </span>"The Beloved of God.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nur-ed-Din </span>"The Light (or Glory) of Religion.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Abd-el-Messiah </span>"The Servant of Christ.<br/>
And so on.<br/>
<br/>
This last name is suggestive, and it seems difficult<br/>
to reconcile their fanatical hatred of the Christian with<br/>
the fact that such a name as this is honoured among<br/>
them, and that the "Eed-el-Imahi," or "birthday of<br/>
Christ," is one of their great festivals.<br/>
<br/>
Many of these "muleds," or sacred feasts, are most<br/>
interesting to the observer, in the picturesque pageantry<br/>
by which they are accompanied.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Muled-el-Husaneyn</span>, or birthday of Hassan<br/>
and Huseyn, sons of the Prophet, is one of the most<br/>
interesting, at any rate in Cairo. On this occasion all<br/>
the bazaars are illuminated and decorated, and the shops<br/>
tastefully arranged for the reception and entertainment<br/>
of guests. It was the custom of the Khedive, as well<br/>
as holy <span style="color: #ff0000;">sheykhs</span>, to pass through the bazaars on their<br/>
way to or from the Mosque <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Husaneyn</span>, and they<br/>
would partake <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">refreshments </span>en route. A like courtesy<br/>
is always extended to the passer-by or curious visitor,<br/>
who will be invited to sit and rest, and watch the<br/>
picturesque scene while enjoying the excellent beverages<br/>
and sweetmeats so cordially presented.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the most important of these Moslem feasts<br/>
