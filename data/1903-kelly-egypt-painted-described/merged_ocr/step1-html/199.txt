<span>The Nile<br/>
<br/>
enjoy a trip previously only within the reach of the<br/>
well-to-do, and, all modern "improvement" notwithstanding, the journey up the Nile still is, and must<br/>
always remain, one of the most beautiful and fascinating<br/>
the world affords.<br/>
<br/>
The ostensible object of the journey is of course the<br/>
inspection of the temples. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Few </span>passengers, however, are<br/>
versed in hieroglyphics, and the full enjoyment of the<br/>
antiquities is only possible to the Egyptologist. I<br/>
rather suspect that were the <span style="color: #0000FF;">truth </span>known, most of the<br/>
Nile visitors are secretly bored, and only "do" these<br/>
sights under moral compulsion. As a matter of fact,<br/>
with the single exception of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phila</span>, none of the temples<br/>
as they appear to-day are intrinsically beautiful, and in<br/>
most cases are so surrounded and smothered by squalid<br/>
dwellings and accumulated <span style="color: #ff0000;">d√©bris </span>as to prohibit any<br/>
distant or general view from which they might be<br/>
perhaps more generally pictorial.<br/>
<br/>
Karnak is sufficiently free from such obstruction and<br/>
impresses by its vastness; while from the river, Kom<br/>
Ombos and Luxor are well seen, but usually fail as<br/>
pictures, unless under the magic influence of some<br/>
effect of light and air.<br/>
<br/>
The real charm which draws people to the river is<br/>
undoubtedly its own beauty, and the interest of the life<br/>
it supports.<br/>
<br/>
The variety of scene is surprising; and no matter<br/>
how often the trip to the Cataracts is made, each<br/>
successive journey discovers some new feature, or<br/>
presents familiar scenes under different conditions<br/>
