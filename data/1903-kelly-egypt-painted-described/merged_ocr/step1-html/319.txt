very loose trousers of some bright colour, red predominating. The "<span style="color: #0000FF;">mandil</span>," or head-scarf, is always<br/>
bright, canary yellow, vivid green, crimson, etc., which,<br/>
with a peep of an equally brilliant undervest, sets off<br/>
the bronze (and often beautiful) faces of the girls to<br/>
wonderful advantage.<br/>

I never tire of sketching these dusky beauties at<br/>
their watering-places. Here, more than at any other<br/>

In this connection I must mention another incident<br/>
which occurred at Mit Gamr. We had moored our<br/>
steamer close to the place where the women came for<br/>
water. There were a great number of them filling<br/>
their pots, washing clothes, cooking utensils, and themselves in the intervals of gossip. Some would go<br/>
