<span>The N ile<br/>
<br/>
Returning to Luxor, you may ride along the banks<br/>
of a small "khalig" or canal, full during high Nile<br/>
but usually dry after December. This is well shaded<br/>
by sycamore and tamarisk trees, and produces a great<br/>
variety of water-plants, and in one of the groves is a<br/>
very beautiful "<span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkia</span>" or water-wheel. Idle for most<br/>
of the year, the flood brings it into activity again, and<br/>
adds its groaning to the other sounds of field life. My<br/>
servant volunteered the following explanation of the<br/>
perpetual "sighing of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkia</span>." It is said that<br/>
Alexander the Great had asses' ears, a fact of which<br/>
none but his barber was aware. Unable at length to<br/>
maintain the horrible secret, the barber in order to<br/>
relieve his soul went into the fields and whispered<br/>
the fact to a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkia</span>, and ever since they continue to<br/>
cry mournfully to each other, "Alexander has ears! "<br/>
"Alexander has ears<span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>Among other trees you will see here for the first<br/>
time the <span style="color: #ff0000;">d6m-palm</span>, which I think I am right in<br/>
saying does not flourish to the north of Luxor; and<br/>
from here onwards to Assuan the castor-oil plant is<br/>
grown as a regular crop.<br/>
<br/>
Quite apart from its historic interest Luxor is<br/>
quite a pleasant place to stay in, and the people<br/>
themselves are quiet and agreeable, though of course<br/>
keenly alive to the chance of a "tip." A very<br/>
excellent example was set them by the late British<br/>
consular agent, Achmed Effendi Ayyad, who was<br/>
always most attentive to strangers. Some years ago<br/>
he entertained my wife and myself to dinner. Twelve<br/>
