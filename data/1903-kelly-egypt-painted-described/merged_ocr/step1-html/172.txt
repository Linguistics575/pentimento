scattered in all directions, and the mule stampeding<br/>
for the hills! My donkey immediately followed the<br/>
example and left us stranded miles from anywhere and<br/>
night approaching. The chance of catching a train<br/>
at Tiira being remote, I decided to tramp back to<br/>
Cairo, and, guided by the distant Citadel, we began<br/>
the march. Loaded as we were with the various<br/>
paraphernalia, it was no easy work even on good<br/>
ground; but, just as darkness <span style="color: #ff0000;">overtook </span>us, we got<br/>
into some miles of rough <span style="color: #0000FF;">debris </span>from old quarries,<br/>
over which we alternately climbed and stumbled.<br/>
After three hours of most wearisome and dangerous<br/>
walking, we eventually reached the Citadel and got<br/>
a conveyance home. My boy, who had been silent<br/>
for a long time, suddenly broke <span style="color: #0000FF;">out-<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>My master, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>will always thank Allah for this day."<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Why</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>"I said.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Because never again in my life can I be so unhappy<br/>
as to-day."<br/>
<br/>
Eastern philosophy evidently has its advantages.<br/>
<br/>
Behind Abbasiyeh, lying in between the Mokattam<br/>
Hills and the Gibel Achmar, is a stretch of desert as<br/>
good in form and colour as any in the country. Here,<br/>
an hour's donkey-ride from Cairo, is a fresh range<br/>
of subject. Tourists know it well, as it is the way<br/>
to the so-called petrified forests. For many years I<br/>
have painted here, and find a never-failing supply of<br/>
new subjects. The desert is fascinating. Its surface<br/>
is varied by water-course or pebble-bed, and an <span style="color: #0000FF;">infinite<br/>
<br/>
</span>variation of colour and texture. Wild growth of <span style="color: #0000FF;">all<br/>
