of the victim terribly if used with skill, so that the<br/>
possession of one, and the threat of using it, often was<br/>
a sufficient deterrent in itself without resort to more<br/>
active means of correction. The use of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">kiirbash </span>"<br/>
in the country officially ceased with the English occupation, and few Europeans would think of using it upon<br/>
their fellows, unless in self-defence in case of attack,<br/>
happily a rare occurrence.<br/>
<br/>
It used to be a frequent sport at Assuan to make up<br/>
a small party on horseback, each armed with a long<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">kiirbash</span>," and, cutting out one or more dogs from<br/>
the village, "run "them across the desert to the hills.<br/>
The poor dogs, though seldom caught, were no doubt<br/>
terrified, but these "runs" over difficult <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground'were<br/>

excitement which attract the foxhunter, and at the<br/>
worst the frightened "pariah" suffered only an odd<br/>
sting from the lash.<br/>

Gymkhanas also served to let out some of that<br/>
exuberance which all who stay at Assuan seem to feel;<br/>
but most attractive and suitable to the position were<br/>
the water picnics and regattas among the islands of the<br/>
Cataract.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us then had our own sailing-boats, and<br/>
there were others for hire if necessary: gaily painted<br/>
little "feluccas," their stern-sheets shaded by an awning,<br/>
and with a long red or blue streamer floating from the<br/>
yard-arm in the breeze, or trailing in the water when<br/>
calm. They were comfortable little boats, and fairly<br/>
good sailers, and, loading up with lunch- and tea-basket,<br/>
