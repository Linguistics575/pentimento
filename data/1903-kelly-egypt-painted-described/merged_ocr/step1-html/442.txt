joy of domestic life and those little courtesies which<br/>
grace their intercourse with others.<br/>
<br/>
The fellah has a sense of humour, and thoroughly<br/>
enjoys a laugh. Does your donkey bray? that, it is<br/>
explained, is because the Devil has whispered in its ear,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>Your mother is dead! "The proverb<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>Shami shumi<br/>
masri <span style="color: #ff0000;">kharami</span>" (The Syrian is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">scoundrel</span>, the Egyptian<br/>
only a thief), reveals a vein of sarcasm which at the<br/>
same time bears testimony to the superior busines<br/>
acumen of the "Shami "<span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>Little love indeed is lost<br/>
between the Syrian squatters in Egypt and their <span style="color: #ff0000;">neighbars</span>, whose attitude is summed up in the saying:<br/>
"Iza kan <span style="color: #0000FF;">t'shEf </span>tarban wa Shami, <span style="color: #ff0000;">sayeb </span>et tarban wa<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">nit </span>esh <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shami </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">( </span>Should you happen to see a Syrian<br/>
or a snake, leave the snake alone but kill the Syrian)!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the robust physique and loud<br/>
voices of the Egyptians seem to cow the few Turkis<br/>
peasants who are engaged in farming in the Delta; and<br/>
I am afraid that, if the truth were known, these poo<br/>
fellows are often the victims of robbery and wrong at<br/>
the hands of their neighbours.<br/>
<br/>
These Turks, by the way, are most engaging i<br/>
their simplicity and patience, and I know of no peasant<br/>
class with whom I have so immediately felt o<br/>
sympathetic terms. Their clean-cut features an<br/>
sensitive mouths plainly indicate the reserved and refine<br/>
natures they possess; and I have always noticed that n<br/>
matter how poor-often desperately poor-the ma<br/>
may be, his house is tidy, the bedding <span style="color: #ff0000;">irreproachabl<br/>
<br/>
</span>clean, and, when refreshment is offered, the whol<br/>
