<span>Religion and Character of the Egyptians<br/>
<br/>
party is accompanied by several young men who play<br/>
upon large tambourines in unison. Their playing has<br/>
a quaint effect, as, by striking <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">skin </span>or rim, the<br/>
quality of the sound is changed; and by alternating the<br/>
fingers, or flat of the hand, other variations are effected.<br/>
The effect is something like this: "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tm-Tum-BzzTnr-Tum-Nz</span>," but in a full rich tone which is very<br/>
harmonious when many players are engaged. Meanwhile the "Howlers "rest occasionally from their exertions, but on each occasion the performance is renewed at<br/>
a slight acceleration of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tempo</span>. So, by slow degrees,<br/>
enthusiasm is worked up, and the pace increased until<br/>
there is no time in which to pronounce the whole word,<br/>
which now is only "-'lah, <span style="color: #0000FF;">-'laC</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>. Men fall insensible<br/>
and are dragged away, the music meanwhile becoming<br/>
quicker and quicker, until the motion of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Darwishes<br/>
</span>is so rapid as to prohibit speech, and all the sound<br/>
emitted is a suffocated "Ha."<br/>
<br/>
Now all present in the mosque gather to witness<br/>
the final <span style="color: #0000FF;">presto</span>. The performers, barely conscious,<br/>
make one last wild effort, and accelerate their motion in<br/>
a frenzy of delirium, while the tambourines are struck<br/>
so rapidly as to produce one almost continuous note of<br/>
immense volume and richness. This glorious tone is<br/>
gathered in the vaulted dome above, and, echoing and<br/>
re-echoing, comes back upon you in such a splendid<br/>
combination of harmonics <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>forms the grandest and<br/>
most stupendous note of music it has ever been my lot<br/>
to hear. Suddenly the "Zikr" ceases, and the bystanders seek to restore to consciousness and sanity the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">IS </span>225<br/>
