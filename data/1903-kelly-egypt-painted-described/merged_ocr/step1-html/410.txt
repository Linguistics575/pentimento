into which all the offal of the place is cast. As though<br/>
this were not enough, the people of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kahbiina </span>had<br/>
placed their village cemetery on its brink; and though<br/>
the curious domes and tombstones of the departed no<br/>
doubt added to the picturesqueness of the scene, this<br/>
hardly conduced to the health of the village, which drew<br/>
a portion at least of its drinking-water from the pool.<br/>
<br/>
Of late the Government have been making strenuous<br/>
efforts to have all these pools filled and the cemeteries<br/>
removed to better sites at a distance; and the last time<br/>
that I visited <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kahbiina </span>I found that this order had<br/>
been carried out, and the pool no longer remained to<br/>
add beauty to the landscape by its reflection of town<br/>
and date-grove<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>While always finding the male inhabitants curiously<br/>
interested in my work, the women, on the other hand,<br/>
were excessively shy, and as I passed them in the street<br/>
they would turn their faces to the wall and gather their<br/>
children to them, lest the "evil eye" of the Christian<br/>
should bring disaster upon them. I found, however,<br/>
that after a time this restraint broke down, and in<br/>
the end I was able to get models for my pictures fro<br/>
among the young women of the place.<br/>
<br/>
The men I found to be usually well set-up and<br/>
handsome; the women, occasionally beautiful whe<br/>
young, on approaching middle age become plain t<br/>
a degree, and one almost regrets that, no doubt owin<br/>
Ito the exigencies of their field-work, the use of the vei<br/>
is dispensed with<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
