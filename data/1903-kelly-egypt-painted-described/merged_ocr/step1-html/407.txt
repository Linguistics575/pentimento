</span>Riding through the Land of Goshen<br/>
<br/>
in the courtyard of some dwelling, and it is difficult at<br/>
first for the stranger to find his way about the village.<br/>
As a rule, the houses have one small door opening<br/>
into the lane, this being frequently the only means of<br/>
egress and ventilation. The windows (when they occur)<br/>
are merely openings in the wall devoid of glass or<br/>
shutter, in place of which a lattice of split bamboo or<br/>
palm-stalks placed crosswise is built in during the<br/>
construction of the house. The narrowness of the<br/>
streets prevents any free circulation of air, while the<br/>
smoke of the fires of dung or corn-cobs fills the houses<br/>
and hangs heavy in the lanes. Yet, in spite of this<br/>
apparently deliberate effort to exclude air, the people<br/>
seem well-conditioned <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>healthy, their occupation<br/>
being in the fields, and their homes simply serving the<br/>
purpose of eating-room or chamber. As I have mentioned, several of the principal houses are dignified by<br/>
an upper story, in which some relief at least is possible<br/>
from the heavy air below, and where the passing breeze<br/>
protects you to some extent from the irritation of the<br/>
myriads of flies which swarm everywhere. Needless to<br/>
say, other forms of insect-life occur, whose tortures<br/>
have to be endured in patience by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">unacclimatised<br/>
</span>visitor. Immediately inside the gate was the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">mandara</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>or guest-room, as usual open to the air on one side, and<br/>
in most respects the same as that already described at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fakiis</span>, though of less size and importance. Opposite,<br/>
across the lane, is a similar room where lodge the<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">gufhah</span>" of the village. As it gets dark, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span>is<br/>
lit by the watchmen, while lamps are placed in the<br/>
169<br/>
