you. The most common is the "mit minan," a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sagelike </span>shrub, but often growing to a height of six or<br/>
seven feet, and in clumps of as much as forty feet<br/>
in circumference. Then there is the fork-like "helba "<br/>
and desert thorn, the bright green "hyssop," or the<br/>
highly aromatic "gazelle broth," and a great variety<br/>
of ice-plants, some red and fleshy, others lusciously<br/>
green. Wild-flowers also abound, and I have counted<br/>
as many as twenty varieties in an area of as many<br/>
feet. One of the prettiest is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flower </span>of the<br/>
"helga," heliotrope in colour, and shaped like a convolvulus, which springs from the junction of spine and<br/>
stem, and among them grows the dingy "atriplex"<br/>
or salt-bush, small and rather like a sponge in appearance.<br/>
<br/>
Remain still. and look closer, and another interest<br/>
appears in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">life </span>these shrubs harbour. Little flies<br/>
feeding on the young shoots are being hunted by the<br/>
spider or ant, who again fall victims to the stealthy<br/>
lizard, the smaller varieties of which would seem to be<br/>
devoured by their larger brothers, some of whom are of<br/>
considerable size and exceedingly quick in their motion.<br/>
Large beetles scavenge the desert, and with herculean<br/>
efforts carry away and bury in the sand pieces of offal<br/>
and partially consumed prey many times larger than<br/>
themselves. Their <span style="color: #0000FF;">modus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">operandi </span>is very <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting</span>. The "booty" is deposited, and the beetle commences to excavate below it, shovelling the loose sand<br/>
away with head and shoulders. Gradually the mass of<br/>
forage sinks, until it is entirely below the surface, and<br/>
