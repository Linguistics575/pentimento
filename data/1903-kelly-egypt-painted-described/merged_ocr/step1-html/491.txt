<span>The Desert and the Bedawin<br/>
<br/>
My horse was terrified or stupid and refused to<br/>
move, so, dismounting, I attempted to lead him by the<br/>
head. Still he would not go, and I decided to remount.<br/>
In doing so, I vaulted right over him, and fell upon<br/>
the off side, so distorted was my sense of proportion.<br/>
When I eventually found the rest of the party, they<br/>
appeared to be miles away, though <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>size of giants,<br/>
and the illusion only ceased upon my coming close<br/>
alongside them. I have been in many desert storms,<br/>
but this was the only occasion upon which such a<br/>
sequence of strange phenomena and delusions occurred,<br/>
probably due to extreme fatigue.<br/>
<br/>
In contrast to such experiences, how peaceful are<br/>
the nights in the desert! The air is cold and clear, and<br/>
the stars appear unusually large and close upon you,<br/>
while the silence is as though Nature held her <span style="color: #0000FF;">breath </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>The social relationships of the Bedawin are simple.<br/>
Each tribe is governed by its sheykh, the "father" of<br/>
the family, whose expressed wish is sufficient to ensure<br/>
the carrying out of any plan, or to prohibit any action<br/>
of which he disapproves; and it is very charming to see<br/>
the deference and respect with which the "patriarch"<br/>
is regarded by his sons and tribesmen.<br/>
<br/>
Their etiquette also should be scrupulously respected<br/>
by the stranger if he would avoid friction. I have<br/>
known of cases where some ignorant omission, or commission, on the part of a guest could only be taken as<br/>
an insulting disregard of their feelings and traditions.<br/>
No one, for instance, should refuse the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">tit-hit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>offered<br/>
by his host at meals, nor should he approach a tent<br/>
