<br/>
</span>dripping garments trailing in the dust. One you<br/>
lady, however, had hit upon a better plan, for, <span style="color: #ff0000;">carryi<br/>
</span>a bundle on her head, she waded into the water until.<br/>
reached her chin, then, slipping off all her clothing, s<br/>
washed it and herself, and finally, gathering <span style="color: #0000FF;">her<br/>
</span>garments together, prepared to come out. For t<br/>
moment I thought she intended to land in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">state<br/>
</span>nudity; but no! as she stepped along she slo<br/>
unfastened the bundle on her head, which <span style="color: #ff0000;">proved </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">u<br/>
</span>be another costume. This she quietly slipped ov<br/>
her shoulders, and allowed to fall gradually, <span style="color: #ff0000;">withoe<br/>
</span>touching water, or exposing an inch of her <span style="color: #ff0000;">perso<br/>
<br/>
</span>until, reaching the bank, she stood radiant in her <span style="color: #ff0000;">fre<br/>
</span>clothing, with the wet garments in her hand!<br/>

This town of Mit Gamr, with Zifta on the opposite<br/>
bank, forms, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>think, one of the most picturesque <span style="color: #0000FF;">bin<br/>
</span>in the country. The river sweeps broadly <span style="color: #ff0000;">betwe<br/>
</span>them in a double curve, the old houses rising <span style="color: #0000FF;">direct </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]<br/>
</span>from the water on either side, and in many <span style="color: #0000FF;">ca<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">supported </span>on built columns whose foundations <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>submerged.<br/>
<br/>
The buildings are very rich in colour; old whitewash<br/>
sunburned and weathered, is opposed to an <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice<br/>
</span>yellow stone or red brick, the whole gaining a spark<br/>
and brilliance by contrast with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">green-paint<br/>
</span>window-shutters and the foliage of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">arboured </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ca </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A<br/>
</span>on the banks.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the mosques have a curious double minaret<br/>
and in the town are many quaint corners which it h<br/>
always been my intention one day to paint. U<br/>
