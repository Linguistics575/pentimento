<br/>
Any visitor wandering through the streets of Cairo<br/>
could not fail to be struck with the number and, in<br/>
many cases, the extreme beauty of these buildings.<br/>
<br/>
Their origin, however, was not due entirely to<br/>
devout feeling or a sense of religious obligation. Pictorial and sculptural representation being forbidden by<br/>
the Mohammedan code, such buildings formed the only<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">possible </span>monument to departed greatness, and supplied<br/>
much of the historical record of Mohammedan rule<br/>
in Egypt. Another explanation of the extraordinary<br/>
number of these buildings may be found in the fact<br/>
that in olden days <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs </span>and Cadis, Pashas and<br/>
Muftis, were alike rapacious, and not over-scrupulous<br/>
to regard the wishes of departed city fathers as to the<br/>
disposal of their worldly goods, and their legitimate<br/>
heirs not infrequently went begging in consequence of<br/>
official sequestration in the name of God and the Prophet.<br/>
So frequent were these robberies in the name of the<br/>
law, that wealthy merchants preferred to build during<br/>
their lifetime, or to bequeath their money for the<br/>
erection of a mosque or <span style="color: #ff0000;">sebeel</span>; any money willed for<br/>
this purpose being regarded as a sacred trust, and therefore inviolable.<br/>
<br/>
These <span style="color: #ff0000;">sebeels</span>, with their beautiful open metal grills,<br/>
which are so frequent an adornment to the streets of<br/>
Cairo, are simply public fountains at which the wayfarers quench their thirst, and the devout perform<br/>
their ablutions before worshipping in the mosque to<br/>
