date the little Mosque of Abu-Bekr, recently beautifully<br/>
and carefully restored, has many points of interest,<br/>
especially in its tile dados and open metal-work.<br/>
<br/>
Viewed from the streets, the mosques are usually of<br/>
simple but dignified design. The facade is generally of<br/>
plain masonry, broken only by the several tiers of small<br/>
windows, either square, round-headed, or occasionally<br/>
circular, and filled in with wrought-iron work of a more<br/>
or less ornate character. Frequently these windows are<br/>
placed in shallow recesses, finishing in a cornice of<br/>
carved stone, the shadows from which, as well as from<br/>
the projecting wall, serving to break up an otherwise<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>space into perpendicular lines.<br/>
<br/>
The sky-line is usually battlemented or finished by a<br/>
projecting cornice, as in the Hassan Mosque. Above<br/>
this rises the square base of the dome, gradually<br/>
returned by "squinches" to the circular form of the<br/>
dome itself, and above all rise one or more minarets<br/>
of two or three diminishing stages, terminating in a<br/>
bold yet delicately proportioned cupola or finial.<br/>
Exterior ornament is usually confined to the minarets,<br/>
the dome, and especially to the doorways, which are<br/>
trefoil-headed and richly embellished with pendentive<br/>
carvings, a fitting framework to the handsome metalwork which is so common a feature of the door itself.<br/>
<br/>
You will notice in nearly all cases that the lintel<br/>
of the door is formed of stone, apparently coloured<br/>
in black and white designs of a curious pattern. In<br/>
