<br/>
</span>pots and vessels for ablutions; the room in other respects<br/>
being devoid of furniture or decoration.<br/>
<br/>
Before sitting to eat, all are expected to wash in<br/>
public. A servant, holding a basin in his hand, pours<br/>
water from a jug while you wash your face and hands; 1<br/>
then rinsing your mouth and sniffing water into your<br/>
nostrils, you are ready to take your place at the<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">sahniyeh</span>," a low brass tray on which the dinner is<br/>
served, using your towel as a napkin during the meal.<br/>
Meanwhile a large fire of <span style="color: #0000FF;">corn-cobs </span>and cotton-stalks<br/>
has been kindled in the courtyard, and one by one<br/>
silent and ghostly figures appear from the distant gloom<br/>
and squat down to watch the strangers.<br/>
<br/>
As a specimen of the fare a hospitable host will<br/>
provide for his guests, let me describe this meal<br/>
rather fully.<br/>
<br/>
The "<span style="color: #ff0000;">sahniyeh </span>"is covered with victuals, each place<br/>
being marked by a pile of thin loaves which serve the<br/>
double purpose of plate as well as food, and piles of<br/>
radishes, lettuces, and small dishes of stewed <span style="color: #0000FF;">vegetable<br/>
</span>surround the central dish. I noticed that the Sheykh<br/>
had procured for me a knife, fork, and plate; but,<br/>
wishing to compliment him, I called a servant, and, <span style="color: #0000FF;">t<br/>
</span>the delight of every one, told him to take them away<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a<br/>
</span>I did not need them. My host was charmed, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ag</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>embracing me exclaimed, "Here is an Englishman wh<br/>
understands us: he eats with his hands <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>"This <span style="color: #0000FF;">epis<br/>
</span>put me for ever in my host's good graces, and secure<br/>
<br/>
1 The jug and basin, called "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tisht-wa-Abrik</span>," are of copper or <span style="color: #0000FF;">brass</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">am<br/>
</span>of an elegant though curious form<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
