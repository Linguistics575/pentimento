<span>Riding through the Land of Goshen<br/>
<br/>
Some villages which I have visited are almost too<br/>
filthy for endurance. At El Ghazali, for instance, the<br/>
guest-chamber placed at my disposal was erected on<br/>
the edge of a "<span style="color: #ff0000;">birkeh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>more than usually foul, while<br/>
the cracks and crevices of its interior walls were filled<br/>
by the nests of wild bees and its floor alive with lice.<br/>
Though very beautiful in its situation and surroundings,<br/>
one night at El Ghazali proved enough for me, and,<br/>
dispensing with refreshment of any kind, I made an<br/>
early departure.<br/>
<br/>
In most of the villages where I have stayed the<br/>
accommodation provided has usually been tolerable, and<br/>
frequently good. Any one, however, in search of the<br/>
picturesque must be prepared to put up with inconvenience and discomfort in return for so much of<br/>
beauty and pictorial interest. The greatest privation is<br/>
probably the uncertainty and varying quality of your<br/>
meals, and I have always found it a wise plan when<br/>
travelling in the country to eat as much as you can<br/>
when food is obtainable, as your next meal is always<br/>
a matter of uncertainty.<br/>
<br/>
Usually rising with the sun, a cup of coffee is always<br/>
procurable, and sometimes a small cake or piece of bread.<br/>
During the day it is usually possible to obtain some light<br/>
refreshment, such as boiled eggs, bread, and coffee,<br/>
though as a rule no substantial meal is prepared until<br/>
nightfall, when the diner is apparently expected to<br/>
provide himself with nourishment for the next twentyfour hours. When one's days are spent in horse-riding<br/>
and open-air work, it will readily be understood that<br/>
