</span>older Italian streets are not without interest. <span style="color: #0000FF;">All </span>are<br/>
beautified by avenues of "<span style="color: #0000FF;">lebbek</span>" 1 trees, and an<br/>
occasional <span style="color: #0000FF;">rand </span>point, with its small ornamental garden<br/>
and plashing fountain.<br/>
<br/>
All the best hotels are here, and, except for the<br/>
passing camel-train and ubiquitous donkey-boy, which<br/>
lend it a touch of local colour, this part of Cairo has<br/>
little interest other than is to be found in well-dressed<br/>
Paris or <span style="color: #ff0000;">London..<br/>
<br/>
</span>I cannot help regretting the old flannel-shirt and<br/>
Knickerbocker days of the early'eighties, when good<br/>
families lived in Sharia <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekiyeh </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fagalla</span>, and<br/>
residents were not above riding donkeys and dining in a<br/>
public <span style="color: #ff0000;">caf√©</span>. Those days were comfortable and <span style="color: #0000FF;">picturesque</span>, and I cannot help thinking more healthy; and<br/>
very excellent dinners were formerly provided by these<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">breweries</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Probably one of the first impressions the new-comer<br/>
receives is the al-fresco nature of the life of the<br/>
place, and the casual manner in which the numerous<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">cafes </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekiyeh </span>quarter are permitted to overspread the footwalks with their little tables and chairs,<br/>
in some cases compelling pedestrians to walk in the<br/>
road, at the risk of being run over by some recklessly<br/>
driven "<span style="color: #ff0000;">arrabiyeC'2 </span>They are interesting, however,<br/>
with their groups of swarthy Italians, Greeks, and<br/>
Levantines, arguing or love-making, some lazily smoking the bubbling "sheesha,<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>others playing "<span style="color: #0000FF;">trictrac </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">4 </span>for the price of a coffee or vermouth.<br/>
