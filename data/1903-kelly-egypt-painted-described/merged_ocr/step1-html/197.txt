<br/>
superstitious minds its annual overflow must have<br/>
appeared to be of a somewhat supernatural character,<br/>
and it is not surprising that the rising of its waters<br/>
should have been the signal for a series of religious and<br/>
festal ceremonies, or that the early Egyptians should<br/>
have included it among their numerous deities.<br/>
<br/>
There is something peculiarly impressive in the<br/>
silent flow of the noble river, a feeling of dignity and<br/>
repose, and a quiet beauty not to be appreciated in a<br/>
moment. Few holiday resorts <span style="color: #ff0000;">coinbine </span>so much of<br/>
historic glamour and present-day interest, and the<br/>
"is rightly regarded as one of the greatest<br/>
attractions Egypt has to offer the tourist.<br/>
<br/>
In former days the journey to the Cataracts was the<br/>
privilege of the few, whose ample means and leisure<br/>
enabled them to enjoy its scenery in a manner peculiarly<br/>
in sympathy with its character and traditions. The<br/>
slow-sailing "dahabiyeh" was not incongruous with<br/>
the lotus-age of Egypt, while the crocodile and sacred<br/>
ibis recognised little difference between the stately<br/>
Nile yacht and the aforetime sacred barges of the<br/>
priests.<br/>
<br/>
To-day a difference is noticeable. The advent of<br/>
steam traffic on the Nile has not only driven the<br/>
crocodile to more secluded waters, but with them has<br/>
also disappeared much of the old glamour of the<br/>
stream. Everything is more or less <span style="color: #ff0000;">vulgarised</span>, and,<br/>
though the beauty of its scenery and majestic monuments remains practically the same, a subtle change<br/>
has overcome the spirit of the scene.<br/>
