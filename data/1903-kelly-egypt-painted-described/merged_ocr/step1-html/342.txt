<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
whose operations are controlled by Government; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghaiten-Nasara </span>being the principal <span style="color: #0000FF;">octroi </span>and resident<br/>
station of the Controller of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fisheries</span>. Here hundreds<br/>
of fishing-boats daily land their "hauls," the best fish<br/>
going to Cairo and other large markets, smaller kinds<br/>
being consumed by the fellahin or made into "<span style="color: #ff0000;">fessikh</span>" <span style="color: #ff0000;">l<br/>
</span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh </span>and elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the eye can reach stretches the water of<br/>
the lake, on whose quiet bosom hundreds of the whaleback boats peculiar to the district skim gracefully as<br/>
they shoot their nets<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, while others from time to time<br/>
return to land their still living freight, which is kept<br/>
in tanks on shore until ready for despatch to various<br/>
markets.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally a big "drive" is organised by the<br/>
resident Controller. Every available boat is out in the<br/>
small hours of the morning, and forms a huge semicircle some miles away. Turning homewards the boats<br/>
slowly return, the crews beating the water and chanting weird songs as they proceed. Gradually the circle<br/>
narrows until it is plainly apparent that the water<br/>
within the cordon is literally alive with fish. Then<br/>
ensues a scene to be remembered. From every boat<br/>
men jump into the water, dragging nets which are<br/>
eventually overlapped until the entire circle is enclosed.<br/>
Each moment the space becomes narrower, and the<br/>
cries of the men louder, while overhead swarms of<br/>
pelican, flamingo, crane, and sea-birds add their screams<br/>
to the cries of the fishermen. The seething water is<br/>
<br/>
