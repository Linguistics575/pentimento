<span>The First Cataract<br/>
<br/>
Close to the station was a deserted shop, its windows<br/>
heavily festooned with <span style="color: #0000FF;">cobwebs</span>, and over whose door<br/>
appeared the name of Charles Neufeld, which, with the<br/>
subsequent arrival of Slatin Pasha, just escaped from<br/>
Omdurman, brought home to all the great tragedy of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siidan </span>then being enacted so close beside you.<br/>
The bazaars, too, were full of Dervish <span style="color: #0000FF;">trophies</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>swords<br/>
and spears from Toski or Abu Klea, blood-stained<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">jibbeh</span>" or coats of mail, hide shields broken by<br/>
British bullets, all having a melancholy interest, and<br/>
to be bought for a trifle.<br/>
<br/>
The day of retribution is come and gone, and<br/>
Assuan no longer is the sentinel of civilisation it then<br/>
was; but its bazaars still contain weapons, and relics of<br/>
the war, to remind us of that terrible time when regiment<br/>
after regiment passed through its streets, only to be<br/>
lost in the burning deserts to the south.<br/>
<br/>
Pleasanter souvenirs than these, however, are to be<br/>
found in the shops. Fine amber beads of large size,<br/>
long pipe-stems of carved ebony, curious sticks and<br/>
ornaments, or strings of beads on plaited leather made<br/>
by the handsome <span style="color: #ff0000;">Besharin</span>, and the universally demanded<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">kiirbash</span>" or whips of hippopotamus-hide. These<br/>
whips vary very much in value, the special point of<br/>
excellence demanded being a perfectly even gradation<br/>
from the thick stock to its finely tapering points.<br/>
Some are six or seven feet in length, and a whip of such<br/>
a size, well proportioned and flexible, is now hard to<br/>
find, and costly when met with. These used to be<br/>
common instruments of punishment, and cut the flesh<br/>
