doors wear above their other garments the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">hubarah</span>,"<br/>
or large shawl of black silk, which envelops the whole<br/>
person, and, falling in picturesque folds about the<br/>
figure, has a graceful effect. The face, all but the<br/>
eyes, is covered with a veil of white muslin which<br/>
almost reaches the feet, which again are shod with<br/>
dainty shoes of morocco-leather. The eyes and eyebrows are heavily shaded with "Kohl," which certainly<br/>
enhances the brilliance of this most beautiful feature<br/>
of the Egyptian women. Unmarried ladies will be<br/>
clad in much the same way, though in their case the<br/>

<br/>
</span>Women of the middle and lower classes instead of<br/>
the expensive "<span style="color: #ff0000;">hubarah </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>substitute the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">milayeh</span>,"<br/>

called "<span style="color: #ff0000;">burko-u-arusa </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">( </span>or bridal veil), instead of<br/>
being of muslin, is made of a kind of coarse crape,<br/>
ornamented at the edge with <span style="color: #0000FF;">embroidery </span>or gold beads,<br/>
while over the nose is worn a curious ornament of brass<br/>
or gold, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>the distinctive mark of the married<br/>
state. Unmarried girls of the lower classes seldom veil,<br/>
and Coptic women, and those living in the country,<br/>
frequently dispense with it altogether. Though plainly<br/>
if not sombrely clad, to all outward appearance, the<br/>
indoor costumes of the women are always gay, and,<br/>
according to their means, of rich material. A good<br/>
deal of jewellery is worn, and in most cases the nails<br/>
and finger-tips and palms of the hands are tinted<br/>
red with "henna," while among the lower classes<br/>
