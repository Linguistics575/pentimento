<br/>
</span>the serious injury, or even death, of several of the<br/>
combatants.<br/>
<br/>
No ill-feeling seems to be engendered, however;<br/>
though nearly approaching war, it is simply a friendly<br/>
exhibition of prowess, in which fatalities are complacently<br/>
regarded as "the will of God."<br/>
<br/>
Such are some of the subjects the desert affords the<br/>
artist, in which the simple incidents of patriarchal life<br/>
are varied by a "<span style="color: #ff0000;">fantasia </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>on <span style="color: #0000FF;">horse- </span>or camel-back, or<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>excitement of a hawking-party.<br/>
<br/>
Painting in the desert, however, is very arduous. It is<br/>
a "barren and dry land," where the heat often is terrible,<br/>
and where hunger and thirst add their discomfort to<br/>
the many difficulties incidental to your work: the glare<br/>
of light thrown upwards from the glittering sand, the<br/>
irritation of the sand-flies, and above all the feeling<br/>
of hopelessness of ever approximating to the subtle<br/>
beauty of your subject. Thirst, however, may often<br/>
be relieved by sucking a pebble, while, as I have mentioned before, the expedient of a little charcoal or green<br/>
paint rubbed upon the eyelids (especially the lower one)<br/>
is a considerable mitigation of the glare.<br/>
<br/>
There is one phase of desert-life, however, which is<br/>
not only intensely disagreeable, but frequently attended<br/>
with danger, and that is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sandstorm</span>. Most people<br/>
who have visited Egypt have in Cairo, or up the Nile,<br/>
had some experience of the discomforts of the khamsin;<br/>
but this can give them little or no idea of what it means<br/>
to the traveller in the desert, where no shelter is<br/>
obtainable, and the full effect of the storm is felt.<br/>
