name. So "Ya <span style="color: #ff0000;">meenuk</span>! "directs a man to move to<br/>
his right, while "Ya <span style="color: #ff0000;">meenik</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ft </span>applies to a woman, and<br/>
the cry "Ya <span style="color: #ff0000;">meenuk </span>wa she malik!" warns a man<br/>
and woman in front of you to step to their right and<br/>
left respectively, so that you may pass between them.<br/>
Should you, as in the excitement of the moment is<br/>
quite probable, invert the genders, both will step<br/>
inwards and render a collision inevitable; from which<br/>
it will be seen that a little knowledge of Arabic is<br/>
dangerous, and that donkey-riding through the streets<br/>
has many excitements.<br/>
<br/>
Such then are some first impressions of the native<br/>
streets of Cairo, above whose struggling mass of<br/>
humanity rise the mansions of a bygone day with<br/>
the mellowness of a thousand years upon them.<br/>
<br/>
As the first sense of strangeness wears off and<br/>
familiarity increases, you are able to further <span style="color: #ff0000;">particularise </span>and distinguish between the various types and<br/>
occupations.<br/>
<br/>
Here let me correct a general error which speaks<br/>
of all natives as "Arabs." In reality there are very<br/>
few Arabs to be found in Cairo, and those met with<br/>
are usually "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Magrabin</span>," or Tunisians, who have come<br/>
in to trade their camel- and goat-hair fabrics. The<br/>
"Bedawin "are seldom to be seen, most of the Eastern<br/>
caravans being composed of Syrian or Persian traders.<br/>
<br/>
Each trade or nationality used to frequent some<br/>
particular khan, or caravansary, whose lower story<br/>
provided shops and stalls for the display of goods, the<br/>
<br/>
upper room being the living apartments of the travellers.<br/>
