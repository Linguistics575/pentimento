Our return journey amply illustrated the disabilities<br/>
these watermen have to suffer. We arrived at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Man</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">...<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sErah </span>late in the evening, and during the night scores<br/>
of heavily laden "<span style="color: #ff0000;">giassas</span>," which had been for some<br/>
time unable to proceed for want of water, started upstream, firmly believing that the Barrage authorities<br/>
would let down enough water to enable the Pasha's<br/>
steamer to make the trip in comfort, the benefit of<br/>
which supply they hoped to share.<br/>
<br/>
Our journey was far from smooth sailing. Groundings were frequent, and once we <span style="color: #ff0000;">overran </span>some submerged masonry, which smashed one of our plates<br/>
and filled the fore-peak with water, and some hours'<br/>
work was necessary before this damage was repaired,<br/>
our men having to work under the water.<br/>
<br/>
The climax, however, was reached at a village called<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tarbaniyeh</span>, where the river, though apparently good<br/>
water, had only one narrow and very tortuous <span style="color: #0000FF;">navigable </span>canal, in which several "<span style="color: #ff0000;">giassas </span>"were hopelessly<br/>
stuck. Our men were sent out wading in the hopes<br/>
of finding a way round them, but without avail, and<br/>
the only course open to us was to make fast a hawser<br/>
and tow the obstructing vessels backwards out of the<br/>
way. We made fast to the nearest boat and went<br/>
astern. The moment, however, the strain came on,<br/>
we pulled her whole stern out without moving the<br/>
boat an inch. Then followed a scene which, though<br/>
pathetic, was amusing. The owner, with loud <span style="color: #0000FF;">laments</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
