</span>This invocation of the Deity is universal, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">th</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>ideas of a suitable blessing are sometimes odd to <span style="color: #0000FF;">our<br/>
</span>minds. My servant had a bad cold and <span style="color: #0000FF;">threatene<br/>
</span>to be ill; my wife therefore got him a mixture <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>bottle of cod-liver oil, and duly instructed him as <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>when and how to take them. The following day I <span style="color: #0000FF;">asked<br/>
</span>him if he had followed the "sit's "1 instructions<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Yes, my master," he replied, "I have dru<br/>
the nasty stuff; may God prosper you and give yo<br/>
another <span style="color: #0000FF;">son</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>As we sail down the river and begin to <span style="color: #0000FF;">net<br/>
</span>Damietta, the stream becomes more sluggish and t<br/>
water deeper, the fall to the sea being so slight that t<br/>
river-water is held up as by a dam, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">coincident<br/>
</span>the vegetation appears to be richer. Palms <span style="color: #ff0000;">agaii<br/>
</span>abound, while fig-trees and vines are plentiful.<br/>
noticed from time to time what appeared to be villag<br/>
of high conical buildings, like pottery kilns. Th<br/>
turned out to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">pigeon-aes</span>, millions of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">bird<br/>
</span>being housed in this way for the sake of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">du<br/>
</span>which is used as a fertiliser. Costumes again ha<br/>
undergone a modification, and the type of people.<br/>
partly sailor and partly fellah; the intervals of far<br/>
ing operations being often employed upon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ri<br/>
</span>in freight-carrying, or in sea-fishing outside. This s<br/>
influence seems to make the people more manly <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>independent, and I was much charmed with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">simp<br/>
