rs, <span style="color: #ff0000;">equallf </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">attractive </span>to the artist and to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">curio</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">er</span>; Grenfell's tomb, or the camp of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Besherin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in turn furnishes the day's employment<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Â°htful</span>, and I may add that in no other place in<br/>
