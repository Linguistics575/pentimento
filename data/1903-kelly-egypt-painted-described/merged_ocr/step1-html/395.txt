<span>Riding through the Land of Goshen<br/>
<br/>
peculiar to an Egyptian spring. A thin film through<br/>
which the early sun is struggling covers the sky, except<br/>
where, low down on the horizon, a glint of blue shines<br/>
with a promise of heat and brilliance later on. Everything looks soft in the tender light, and the distant belt<br/>
of palm-trees rises mistily above the <span style="color: #ff0000;">deW-bespangled<br/>
</span>fields. On the right is the smoke of a camp fire, and<br/>
the quiet canal water, repeating the grey sky above,<br/>
completes a scheme of silver which is only <span style="color: #ff0000;">emphasised<br/>
</span>by the coloured head-dresses of our attendants and the<br/>
gay trappings of their horses.<br/>
<br/>
The surrounding country is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>expanse of green<br/>
fields and ripening corn, broken frequently by <span style="color: #ff0000;">palmgroves </span>and clumps of tamarisk-trees, in which nestle<br/>
the little farmsteads of the people, innocent of anything in the shape of hedgerow or boundary marks.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking generally, the country districts of Egypt<br/>
have few roads, their place being taken by large arterial<br/>
canals which are usually navigable. Their high banks<br/>
also, well beaten by camel tread or hoof of cattle,<br/>
form <span style="color: #0000FF;">excellent </span>paths for man and beast, and, except<br/>
during rain, when they become dangerously slippery,<br/>
are perfect riding-tracks for the horseman. Usually<br/>
the canals are well wooded with shade trees, among<br/>
which the sycamore, oak, tamarisk, and mimosa are<br/>
the most common. On the banks are the frequent<br/>
shadoof, and in the fields are <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkias </span>worked by a<br/>
buffalo which a small boy encourages to keep awake by<br/>
the aid of a long whip of hide. You will notice <span style="color: #0000FF;">that<br/>
<br/>
</span>these animals are always blindfolded to prevent <span style="color: #ff0000;">dizzi<br/>
