<span>The Lower Nile<br/>
<br/>
fortunately, during this present spring 1000 houses and<br/>
200 shops of the old town have been destroyed by fire,<br/>
and I fear that my opportunity is lost.<br/>
<br/>
Without attempting any detailed description of the<br/>
many days spent on this journey, I was specially<br/>
charmed with the old town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Samaniid</span>, whose fine<br/>
bazaar facing the river is, I believe, the oldest existing<br/>
in Egypt; though, alas! the trade which formerly<br/>
created it has failed to preserve it in its pristine<br/>
dignity and prosperity.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">araskiir </span>is another charming scene from the river,<br/>
but without any special internal feature on exploration;<br/>
and of another type is the little village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shinbab</span>,<br/>
whose tomb-mosque and tree-shaded huts looked very<br/>
picturesque in the early evening light.<br/>
<br/>
In pure landscape the Lower Nile is very rich, and<br/>
the populace is deferentially agreeable. Whenever I had<br/>
occasion to leave the steamer I was treated with the<br/>
utmost respect, and was never asked for a "backsheesh"<br/>
excepting once, when a small mite proffered the request,<br/>
only to be soundly rated for her rudeness by her elder<br/>
sister.<br/>
<br/>
In some respects I found these people to be much<br/>
like the Irish peasantry in their simple politeness to a<br/>
stranger. How often in Ireland, for instance, will an<br/>
artist while sketching be saluted by the passer-by with<br/>
"God bless your work, sir! "So here I was frequently<br/>
"salaamed "by a native who would <span style="color: #0000FF;">ask<br/>
</span>"Does your work prosper <span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Thanks be to Allah," I would reply.<br/>
