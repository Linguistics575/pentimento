</span>I caught many facetious as well as complimentary<br/>
references to both bride and groom. It is rather<br/>
remarkable the faculty of extemporisation these people<br/>
possess; for, though no doubt the language lends<br/>
itself to rhythmic treatment, the quick manner in which<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">improvisateur </span>will vary his sentiments, and seize<br/>
upon any passing event or personality as a subject of<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">witticism</span>, is really clever. Their sense of rhythm is<br/>
extraordinary, and they largely indulge in syncopations,<br/>
time being marked by clapping of hands or striking of<br/>
the "tabla," <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span>and this, when performed by a crowd as the<br/>
accompaniment to some general chant or song, is very<br/>
striking and good in its effect. While sitting here at<br/>
work my notice was attracted by the gyrations of a<br/>
man, apparently standing on the water, and drifting<br/>
rapidly down the stream. On nearer approach he<br/>
proved to be a fisherman, standing up to his ankles in<br/>
water on a raft of wickerwork barely large enough to<br/>
sustain his weight, and employed in fishing the river<br/>
with his casting-net.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salamiin</span>, as in most villages, a public "mahdieh"<br/>
or ferry supplies the necessary means of transit from<br/>
one bank to another; the ferry-boat usually being large<br/>
enough to pass over, not only passengers, but camels,<br/>
horses, and other live stock. A little higher up the<br/>
canal is the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dekerniss</span>, from the water<br/>
looking bright and clean, but pervaded with an overpowering smell of "<span style="color: #ff0000;">fessilch</span>," of which it is a great<br/>
