instinct, and then, in turn assisting each other in raising<br/>
their heavy loads into position, the steep bank is climbed<br/>
and they disappear from view over its crest.<br/>

The stately carriage of these women is most<br/>
attractive, due no doubt to unconfining garments and<br/>
the habit of bearing heavy weights on their heads.<br/>
