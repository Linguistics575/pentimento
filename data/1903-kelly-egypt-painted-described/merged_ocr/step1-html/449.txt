to supply its own hardwood and building timber is<br/>
one to be anticipated with lively satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally this experiment has had the effect of<br/>
bringing under cultivation a bit of desert hitherto<br/>
regarded as beyond its reach, and has given a high<br/>
market value to neighbouring land previously considered worthless.<br/>
<br/>
I have spoken a good deal of the fertility of the<br/>
land and the effect of water on the sand, and of<br/>
late years extended irrigation has brought under cultivation a very large acreage of desert formerly<br/>
barren.<br/>
<br/>
There is, however, another zone, fortunately a small<br/>

the sunshine, while their brittle leaves and stems seemed<br/>
to shudder in the breeze.<br/>
<br/>
No sound of life was to be heard, except the<br/>
struggling of our tired horses through the tangled<br/>
mass; while the splashing water, crystallising into salt<br/>
