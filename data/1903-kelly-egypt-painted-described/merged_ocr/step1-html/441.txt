See two natives "shake hands": there is no clasp in<br/>
it, simply the touching of one by the other, but then<br/>
each kisses his own as symbol of regard.<br/>
<br/>
You render thanks in appreciation for hospitality<br/>
received; your host will answer<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>Your presence brings<br/>
