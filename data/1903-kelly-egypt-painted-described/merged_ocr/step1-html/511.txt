<span>Religion and Character of the Egyptians<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">other</span>, and keenly appreciative of a joke, they have<br/>
many traits which charm, whereas their faults may<br/>
usually be traced to the influence of their origin and<br/>
past government. Quarrelling seldom, and kind to<br/>
their poorer or afflicted brothers, I confess to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">very<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">warm </span>feeling for these poor simple people, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">respond<br/>
</span>so readily to a kindly word or act, and are so grateful<br/>
for consideration.<br/>
<br/>
One thing which always impresses me strongly is the<br/>
evident sincerity of their religion. To them "Allah "<br/>
is a personal Deity, whose fatherhood is believed in,<br/>
and to whom his children can with confidence appeal.<br/>
Whatever is, is ordained of Allah, and therefore best,<br/>
and no word of complaint questions the Divine intelligence or regard for welfare of the "faithful." "The<br/>
Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be<br/>
the name of the Lord," is their attitude, and "Kismet "1<br/>
the only comment on disaster!<br/>
<br/>
It is a custom among many to regard the<br/>
Mohammedan religion as largely vicious and immoral.<br/>
In reality it is neither, and I am strongly of opinion<br/>
that a sincere Moslem is a good man, and that his<br/>
religion is in many ways spiritual and ennobling.<br/>
Indeed, an average Mohammedan may well shame the<br/>
majority of Christians. To him, his religion is a daily<br/>
personal need, and his devotions, in which he constantly<br/>
occupies himself, are tremendously real. The ritual<br/>
of prayer provides few petitions and is mostly a<br/>
religion of adoration, though petitions are presented<br/>
