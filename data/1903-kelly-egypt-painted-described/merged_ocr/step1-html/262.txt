<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
remarkable in Egypt. It is comparatively recent in<br/>
point of date, having been completed so lately as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">f</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BAN</span>, and has many points of resemblance to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dendefa</span>. Two special features distinguish it from<br/>
others. Its pylons are of unusual height, rising 112<br/>
feet above ground, and are covered by carved depictions of battle scenes. From the top of the pylons a<br/>
very striking view is to be had which repays the effort<br/>
of climbing. Here, by the way, it may be mentioned<br/>
that the ascending galleries by which the roof of the<br/>
temple or upper stories of the towers are reached are<br/>
inclined planes simply, and not staircases, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">mounting </span>is therefore a gradual and easy process. Another<br/>
special feature of Edfu is the high boundary-wall entirely<br/>
enclosing the temple, from which it is separated by a<br/>
narrow court, which eventually merges into the Cloister<br/>
of the outer hall. This wall, like those of the temple<br/>
itself, is covered by hieroglyphics in bas-relief, not<br/>
incised, and many of the figures which occur are well<br/>
modelled. Various scenes from the life of its times<br/>
are pictured here, among which are crocodile and<br/>
hippopotamus hunts, in which all the accessory facts,<br/>
even to the strands of ropes or the meshes of <span style="color: #ff0000;">fishingnets</span>, are carefully elaborated.<br/>
<br/>
As is so frequently the case, the temple is so surrounded by rubbish-heaps as to be practically standing<br/>
in a deep depression which prohibits any distant or<br/>
general view of the building, and, until cleared out<br/>
by M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Marriette</span>, even supported a native village upon<br/>
its roof.<br/>
