</span>athwart the stream which bears them slowly to their<br/>
northern markets.<br/>
<br/>
No less interesting are the mud-banks themselves,<br/>
crowned with the fresh green of the young <span style="color: #0000FF;">Indian-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">corn </span>crop. You will notice how each successive fall<br/>
of the water cuts the steep sides into terraces, from<br/>
the face of which slabs of alluvial mud constantly<br/>
break off like basaltic rock, and are swept away in<br/>
the stream. Each fresh terrace as it is formed is<br/>
brought under cultivation by the industrious farmer,<br/>
who plants on its narrow area onions, beans, and<br/>
other vegetables.<br/>
<br/>
In mid-stream, before the water has entirely left it,<br/>
every mud-bank is marked out with stakes, and these<br/>
claims will presently be sown with water-melon and<br/>
cucumber, every inch of arable soil being utilised to<br/>
its utmost possibility.<br/>
<br/>
From the terraces of the bank you may see fishermen throwing their hand-nets. The nets are circular,<br/>
about twelve feet in diameter, with a line attached to<br/>
the centre. The fisherman lays his net in folds upon<br/>
both arms, and with a dexterous swing of the body<br/>
throws it over the water, upon which it falls in a<br/>
perfect circle. The outer edge is weighted and falls<br/>
slowly to the bottom, enclosing whatever fish may<br/>
happen there in its descent. The fish caught in this<br/>
way are usually small, though the Nile contains many<br/>
of great size which are sometimes caught by line.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed one day <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>curious episode in this connection. As the fisher cast his net, a Kingfisher, poised<br/>
