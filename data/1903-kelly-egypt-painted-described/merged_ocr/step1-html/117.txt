shine through the gloom of the lofty interiors. I have<br/>
also noticed that instead of mixing pigments into greens<br/>
or purples, etc., the effect of these colours is sometimes<br/>
produced by painting the whole surface blue, through<br/>
which run thin lines, or series of small spots, of yellow<br/>
or red, as the case may be, and the eye from a distance<br/>
blends the whole into the desired hue.<br/>
<br/>
Whether in their stone-carving, pavements, woodwork, or decoration, these people were certainly great<br/>
artists; and the painter, in the intervals of work, may<br/>
learn much from a study of such examples of each as<br/>
are still left in Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The question naturally arises, Where are the best<br/>
examples to be found? Any good dragoman or intelligent donkey-boy will be able to show the inquirer<br/>
several houses such as I have mentioned, where still<br/>
remains, though more or less dilapidated, practically<br/>
all of its original splendour of decoration. The pavements and tilework perhaps will be broken, but<br/>
sufficient remains to give a very complete idea of the<br/>
whole. The ceilings and domed centre-lights are<br/>
generally fairly perfect, the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">mashrubiyeh</span>" work<br/>
perhaps having suffered most of all. In some rooms<br/>
the panelled "dulab," or wall-cupboard, reveals secret<br/>
passages and hiding-places, suggestive of the romantic<br/>
intrigues they were designed to cover, and to which<br/>
the quotations from the Koran and religious proverbs<br/>
with which frieze and windows are enriched form a<br/>
standing reproof.<br/>

I was fortunate enough some years ago to secure<br/>
