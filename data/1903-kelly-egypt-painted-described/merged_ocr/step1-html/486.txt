head, covering mouth and nose, and leaving only the<br/>
eyes exposed, which, though protecting the face from<br/>
the flying splinters, only adds to your heat and <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffocation</span>. Even should the water-skins not be cracked or<br/>
the water dried up, you cannot stop to drink, and food<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>equally unattainable. "Hungry and thirsty, your<br/>
soul dies within you," as hour after hour you ride<br/>
until the storm abates or some shelter is found to end<br/>
your misery.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fortunately</span>, all sand-storms are not so violent as<br/>
this, and at the expense of severe granulation of the<br/>
eyes I have been able to paint them in many moods,<br/>
and in my opinion the pictures I have been able to<br/>
obtain have amply <span style="color: #ff0000;">repaid </span>my suffering.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the moral effect of such storms is peculiar,<br/>
and results in a kind of temporary hallucination which<br/>
is curious. I was caught in a storm some time ago<br/>
which had this curious effect upon both my horse and<br/>
myself. We were riding over a rough bit of desert,<br/>
slightly undulating, with "<span style="color: #ff0000;">khores</span>," or water-worn<br/>
gullies, here and there. During a dense whirl of sand,<br/>
our party lost touch with each other and I found<br/>
myself alone. In all directions was this driving <span style="color: #ff0000;">dustveil</span>, which had the effect of distorting everything.<br/>
Rocks became mountains and a shrub appeared as a<br/>
tree. All idea of distance was lost, and, standing<br/>
upon the little <span style="color: #0000FF;">hammock </span>from which I searched for<br/>
the rest of my party, I might have been outside the<br/>
universe <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jvitnessing </span>the warring of the elements in<br/>
original chaos.<br/>
