invariably concludes a meal.<br/>

While eating, servants stood behind us, some with<br/>
lanterns, others with jars of rose-scented <span style="color: #ff0000;">drinkingwater </span>from which each one drank from time to time.<br/>
With the exception of the soup and the rice, which were<br/>
eaten with the same spoon, all food is taken with the<br/>
right hand, host and guest exchanging choice morsels<br/>
from time to time. Everything was excellently cooked<br/>
and served, and a certain amount of pretty ceremony<br/>
characterised the meal.<br/>
<br/>
For the benefit of any who may be privileged to be<br/>
thus feasted, let me mention one point of table etiquette,<br/>
namely, that the diner should never eat of every dish,<br/>
or his host, supposing that he has not been satisfied,<br/>
will order the menu to be repeated from the beginning!<br/>
It may also be worth remembering that the penultimate<br/>
dish always consists of <span style="color: #0000FF;">bores </span>in some form, such as ribs<br/>
or knuckle; this is a warning to the diner that only<br/>
rice is to follow, so that now, or not at all, his appetite<br/>
must be appeased.<br/>
<br/>
Rising independently as each one finishes, the same<br/>
ceremonial washing is repeated.<br/>
<br/>
Our meal over, the servants and villagers present<br/>
finish all that remains of the repast, while we enjoy our<br/>
coffee and cigarettes among the cushions of the divan.<br/>
Fortunately politeness does not compel conversation,<br/>
and the guests if so wishful may rest in silence. <span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
