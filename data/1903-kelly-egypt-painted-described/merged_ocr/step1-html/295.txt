<span>The First Cataract<br/>
<br/>
bench, before the stone is placed in the position it is<br/>
destined to occupy, and where, perhaps, difference of<br/>
lighting, as well as height and distance, may seriously<br/>
modify the effect intended to be produced.<br/>
<br/>
Very beautiful in form and colouration are the<br/>
columns of the inner hall, which Mr. Newman, the<br/>
American artist, has so entirely made his own; and in<br/>
the Kiosk, or "Pharaoh's Bed," the introduction of an<br/>
unusually long <span style="color: #0000FF;">impost </span>between the exceedingly rich<br/>
capitals and the architrave gives it an effect of grace<br/>
and elegance not usually associated with the art of<br/>
ancient Egypt. The mural decoration of the Kiosk,<br/>
and the raised hieroglyphs and figure-carving of the<br/>
small gateway at the eastern corner of the pylon, are<br/>
other special points of interest which repay study.<br/>
<br/>
There is one curious phenomenon associated with any<br/>
monument or place of interest in Egypt. Wherever<br/>
you may happen to go, whether <span style="color: #ff0000;">it </span>be a deserted<br/>
temple, an unfrequented mosque, or a rocky islet in the<br/>
Cataract, immediately, and apparently from the bowels<br/>
of the earth, some <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>will suddenly appear to beg a<br/>
piastre or to offer his undesired services. Phila, is<br/>
no exception to the rule, and no sooner do you step<br/>
upon the island than men and children appear from all<br/>
directions, like vultures scenting their prey. It is really<br/>
amusing at times, and the native can be no humourist<br/>
or he would see the frequent absurdity of the thing<br/>
himself! I<br/>
<br/>
One day, for instance, I noticed a small boy of seven<br/>
or eight gravely attempting to assist over some fallen<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">117<br/>
