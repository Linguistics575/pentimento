</span>In decoration, as in structure, the art of the ancient<br/>
Egyptian is distinctive. The hieroglyphs of the temples<br/>
and delicately relieved mural carvings of the tombs at<br/>
Sakkara are peculiar to this country and epoch, and it<br/>
is remarkable that, though as "art "somewhat archaic,<br/>
in no instance is truth to nature contradicted. Animal<br/>
action, for instance, is always correctly represented, and<br/>
the story told with directness and force; and although<br/>
all such depictions followed a manner which might be<br/>
styled convention, the Egyptian artist saw nature with<br/>
a simple truthfulness which avoided those errors of<br/>
anatomy and motion which <span style="color: #ff0000;">characterise </span>so much of<br/>
mediaeval art, and are only now slowly succumbing to<br/>
greater knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Undoubtedly the ancient Egyptians were a people<br/>
of great scientific attainment; and apart from the lost<br/>
mechanical methods which enabled them to carry out<br/>
their stupendous works, many problems remain unsolved. The texture of the mummy-cloths cannot<br/>
be copied by modern weavers; and who knows the<br/>
composition of the pigments employed in the decorations of the rock-tombs? pigments as fresh to-day as<br/>
when applied 3000 years ago! And how again were<br/>
the interior chambers of the temple illuminated? Many<br/>
of these chambers are entirely beyond the reach of daylight, so that artificial light must have been constantly<br/>
employed. Yet there is no sign of lamp or sconce, or<br/>
trace of smoke upon the walls! These are some<br/>
questions upon which no light has been thrown by<br/>
papyrus or hieroglyph, and upon which we can only<br/>
