"<span style="color: #0000FF;">mandira</span>," and, preceded by the usual washing, dinner<br/>
is served. Very different from that provided by Sheykh<br/>
Mohammed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abdiin</span>, the fare here proved to be poor,<br/>
and consisted solely of a pyramid of rice on which were<br/>
distributed a few rather lean pieces of mutton. The<br/>
inevitable "riz-bi-leban "followed; and as both dishes<br/>
were strongly flavoured by the pungent smoke of the<br/>
fires, it will be readily understood that a keen appetite<br/>
is necessary before one can enjoy such a meal as this.<br/>
As is always the case, the coffee, by its excellence, made<br/>
amends for the dinner itself. The old Sheykh of the<br/>
village joined us at the meal, and, after eating a little,<br/>
made way for his son to do the same, etiquette forbidding both father and son to eat with a stranger at<br/>
the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Presently I was conducted to my bedroom, guided<br/>
by a "<span style="color: #ff0000;">gaffir</span>," who carried a long stick and a lantern.<br/>
As we proceeded down the narrow lane, the dogs,<br/>
running alongside on the roofs, would constantly snap<br/>
at us and had to be repeatedly beaten off. My room<br/>
was merely a cupboard, about six feet square, without<br/>
window or, so far as I could see, any ventilation whatever, except the heavy door, which locked on the outside. The interior of the room was mainly occupied<br/>
by a dais of mud on which the mattress was spread.<br/>
Beneath was an opening which proved to be the fireplace,<br/>
but without a chimney, and before I could prevent him<br/>
my conductor had lit the rubbish it contained, the<br/>
pungent smoke from which very quickly drove me<br/>
into the street.<br/>
