machinery, and directed by the best intelligence, absolutely fail to make the land support them. No doubt<br/>
the knowledge would come in time; but as matters are,<br/>
none but the "fellah?' seems able to coax from the soil<br/>
its best and richest return.<br/>
<br/>
Though conservative in their methods, they are in<br/>
some ways adaptable, and steam turbines are recognised as better means of irrigation than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkia </span>or<br/>
shadoof. The old hand-mill has almost entirely <span style="color: #0000FF;">disappeared </span>in favour of the steam-engine, and only lack<br/>
of capital, in the case of the small farmers, serves to<br/>
perpetuate many other picturesque accessories to their<br/>
labour which will eventually succumb to modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">improvements</span>.<br/>
<br/>
As a rule, all the field operations are picturesque.<br/>
Ploughing is carried on with the traditional yoke of<br/>
oxen, though occasionally you may see a camel harnessed<br/>
with an ox or donkey, or even all three together<br/>
yoked to the same plough. The plough itself is a very<br/>
simple implement of wood, with its point iron-shod<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Deep ploughing is not required, and the wooden<br/>
plough of Egypt does little more than scratch the soil,<br/>
breaking the surface into rough clods, among which<br/>
the seed is sown. These clods are seldom broken by<br/>
harrowing, for if the surface were <span style="color: #0000FF;">too </span>smooth, the sun<br/>
would "<span style="color: #ff0000;">cake </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>the land after irrigation, and so smother<br/>
the seed. There is an implement used, however, rather<br/>
like a barrow without a wheel, which is dragged over<br/>
the ploughed land, partially breaking the lumps and<br/>
covering up the newly sown seed.<br/>
