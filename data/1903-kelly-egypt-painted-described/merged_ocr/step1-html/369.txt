<span>Canal Life in the Delta<br/>
<br/>
in Egypt, have still an interest of their own in the<br/>
water-borne <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>they carry.<br/>
<br/>
The Bahr <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moiise </span>eventually debouches into Lake<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mentala</span>, fishing-boats from whence frequently enter<br/>
and fish its waters. On one of my journeys our party<br/>
arrived at the banks of this canal at a point too deep<br/>
for fording, and entirely devoid of any means of transit.<br/>
As it was necessary that we should cross, we were rather<br/>
at a loss what to do. Presently there approached a<br/>
fishing-boat netting the stream, and on our hailing the<br/>
crew they quickly hauled in their nets and prepared<br/>
to ferry us across. The precipitous banks, rendered<br/>
slippery by the splashing water, made it no easy task<br/>
to transfer our camels, horses, and donkeys from the<br/>
high bank to the boat below them. After much <span style="color: #0000FF;">excitement</span>, and with a great deal of trouble, our beasts, camp<br/>
equipment, and ourselves were safely landed on the<br/>
other side. The operation, however, necessitated three<br/>
journeys of the boat, and consequent loss of a couple<br/>
of hours of daylight for the fishermen. Upon our<br/>
offering to reward them for their services, they declined<br/>
all payment, saying that "Allah had allowed them to<br/>
befriend the wayfarer, and he would reward <span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span>";<br/>
and a few minutes later their nets were again in the<br/>
water and the fishermen working as though no in-.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">terruption </span>had occurred.<br/>
<br/>
The Ismailia Canal, which connects Zagazig with<br/>
Ismailia, is another fine stream; often busy with passing<br/>
craft, though usually peaceful in its character, and, to<br/>
those inclined for sport, able occasionally to provide<br/>
