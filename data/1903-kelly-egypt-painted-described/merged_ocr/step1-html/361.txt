</span>Canal Life in the Delta<br/>
<br/>
probably, is the one which I reproduce, where the<br/>
irregular buildings of the village pile up picturesquely<br/>
behind the mosque, which forms the only really architectural feature of the place. You will notice that<br/>
from the minaret of the mosque, which in itself is of<br/>
rather an unusual form, are some projecting poles;<br/>
these are what remain of the scaffolding used in the<br/>
erection of the building many hundred years ago, and<br/>
which the builders forgot to remove on the completion<br/>
of the work-a curious example of the Egyptian habit<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">lather </span>faire. The pool shown in my sketch looked<br/>
lovely from a distance, but closer acquaintance proved<br/>
it to be one of the most filthy "birkeh "possible, and<br/>
literally alive with rats. Our camp here was across the<br/>
canal, our tents being pitched under a fine grove of<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">gamase </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>trees, from which we had a particularly fine<br/>
view of town and river, as well as being free from the<br/>
flies and smells which are the inevitable accompaniment<br/>
to any congregation of native houses.<br/>
<br/>
On the river itself occurred many picturesque <span style="color: #0000FF;">incidents</span>. Here, in a large "<span style="color: #ff0000;">giassa</span>," passed a weddingparty accompanying the bride-elect to the distant village<br/>
which was to be her new home; a pleasant-looking<br/>
girl, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">laughingly </span>responded to the salutations of our<br/>
party. She was accompanied by her female relations<br/>
and the various articles of furniture or utensils which,<br/>
with her own clothing contained in brightly painted<br/>
wooden boxes, formed her contribution to the equipment of her new abode. The rowers in the bow<br/>
extemporised songs to the accompaniment of the<br/>
