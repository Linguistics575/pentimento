<span>Religion and Character of the Egyptians<br/>
<br/>
are not tolerated in Christian countries. Polygamy,<br/>
for instance, is sanctioned by the Koran; but it must<br/>
be remembered that this is only the continuance of a<br/>
practice common among the patriarchs and heroes of<br/>
the Old Testament. As a rule, the Egyptian is the<br/>
husband of one wife, and, provided she has children,<br/>
and gives no serious cause for displeasure, he is usually<br/>
faithful to her. Should she, however, be barren, the<br/>
husband will probably take <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>second in the hope of<br/>
perpetuating his name and race; and the first wife,<br/>
if not previously divorced, becomes an attendant upon<br/>
her more fortunate sister.<br/>
<br/>
Their religion exercises a great influence upon the<br/>
mass of the people, among whom it is a frequent<br/>
subject of discussion; and, just as Arabi Pasha's<br/>
success initially was the result of his intimate <span style="color: #0000FF;">knowledge </span>of the Koran and his power of dramatic recitation of its verses, so Moslem history shows how, in<br/>
almost all cases, pretenders and leaders of great popular<br/>
movements have gained their ascendency through its<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influence</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Owing to lack of education and very slight intercommunication between villages, public opinion in<br/>
Egypt is almost non-existent, and it is only by appeals<br/>
to their religious <span style="color: #ff0000;">fervour </span>or fanaticism that any combined action on their part can be aroused.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the festivals, which form the only relaxation from work, are of a religious character, and even<br/>
the names men bear have often a similar significance<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
