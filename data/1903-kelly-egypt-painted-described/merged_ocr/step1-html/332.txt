<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
their goods from house to house, while the women<br/>
making their purchases, or washing and drying clothes<br/>
on their little stagings, give quite a Venetian aspect to<br/>
this river-front.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Irequently </span>from upper windows water is hauled up<br/>
by means of a rope and bucket, a pulley being fixed<br/>
for this purpose. Every house has its little stone stairway leading into the water, and these are often covered<br/>
with a wooden hood so as to enable the ladies to bathe<br/>
in privacy. Everything suggests an amphibious life;<br/>
and the river here being of great depth, vessels of large<br/>
tonnage are able to enter the port and discharge or<br/>
receive their cargoes safely.<br/>
<br/>
Rain is frequent and heavy on the coast; and in<br/>
place of the sun-dried bricks of Upper Egypt it is<br/>
necessary here to use burnt brick, the vivid red of<br/>
which showing through broken plaster lends an<br/>
additional touch of colour to the buildings, and adds<br/>
considerably to the general charm of the place. The<br/>
principal streets are for the same reason flagged <span style="color: #0000FF;">With<br/>
</span>stone, and in consequence very much cleaner than any<br/>
others I have seen in Egypt. Inside the town are<br/>
many fine buildings, baths, mosques, and the palaces of<br/>
former grandees. The main street has many good<br/>
shops, and evidently retains a large trade, while some<br/>
of the "odd corners" are most quaint and pictorial,<br/>
and though different in character are as picturesque as<br/>
anything in Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
Two features of domestic architecture struck me.<br/>
In place of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mushrabiyeh </span>work of Cairo, the windows<br/>
