passed by en route. It must be lived in quietly and<br/>
absorbed. Never mind books; walk about by yourself<br/>
and see what you can discover for yourself, and enjoy<br/>
that. In doing so you will find many quaint bits, and<br/>
see much of a life whose every incident is worth your<br/>
attention. And may I warn the reader against abusing<br/>

pleasanter for every one if you bear in mind that they<br/>

grateful rest from your sight-seeing. The difficulty of<br/>
language will again suggest itself, but on these occasions<br/>
conversation is not essential; a polite "salaam" and<br/>
smile of appreciation is quite sufficient to meet the case.<br/>
<br/>
You will notice in your wanderings variously coloured<br/>
doorways, their surrounding whitewash being gaily<br/>
ornamented with conventional designs in red, blue, and<br/>
yellow. These lead to the "hammam," or bath, and<br/>
