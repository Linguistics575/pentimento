<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
ing to occupy several days; a sail to Port Said, a<br/>
day's fishing with the fleet, or to the artist the stalking and sketching of wild birds, passes the time pleasantly<br/>
and advantageously. The fisher-folk also are <span style="color: #0000FF;">hard..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">working </span>and worthy creatures, and only too anxious to<br/>
be obliging. While sketching here I have repeatedly<br/>
interrupted men engaged in landing fish, who at my<br/>
request have contentedly posed up to their waists in<br/>
water while I introduced them into my subject.<br/>
<br/>
From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghaitren-Nasara </span>a short sail brings you to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Matarieh</span>, also a fishing centre and the port of the town<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menzala</span>.<br/>
<br/>
As in Damietta, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menzala </span>possesses many features of<br/>
interest. Here also burnt brick takes the place of sundried, and, as we have noticed in Damietta, adds variety<br/>
to the colour of buildings all more or less dilapidated.<br/>
The form of the mosque minarets also is peculiar to<br/>
this district, their height and beauty showing that at one<br/>
time <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menzala </span>must have been wealthy and ambitious.<br/>
On its outskirts are many old tombs, where also are<br/>
many beautiful gardens and vine-walks of former<br/>
grandees, now hopelessly neglected. Poor to-day and<br/>
thinly populated, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menzala </span>is a monument of picturesque<br/>
decay, and, like most of the extremely pictorial places<br/>
in Egypt I have visited, is squalid and insanitary in<br/>
inverse ratio to its beauty.<br/>
<br/>
The town is built on the banks of a canal called the<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahr-es-Soghraieh</span>," which, starting from the Nile at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Maniiirah</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">serves</span>, in its course of fifty miles or so of<br/>
devious wanderings, to water as many farms and villages,<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">142<br/>
<br/>
