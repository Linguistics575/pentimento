interest of its own. Alongside the line is the Ismailia<br/>
Canal, refreshing among so much sand, and on its<br/>
smooth surface glide graceful lateen-sailed boats. Beyond it to the south are the marshes of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nefisha</span>, partly<br/>
cultivated, and enlivened by little clumps of palm-trees<br/>
and scattered farms. Behind, glowing in the light, are<br/>
the ruddy-tinted Suez Mountains, which stretch across<br/>
the desert until they meet the Mokattam Hills at Cairo.<br/>
To the north, unbroken desert stretches until it merges<br/>
into the now barren and desolate "Field of Zoan <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>of<br/>
Abrahamic days.<br/>
<br/>
No one can pass through this short bit of desert<br/>
without picturing to himself the old Biblical days and<br/>
the wanderings of the Israelites. One's thoughts are,<br/>
however, soon recalled to the present by the arrival of<br/>
the train at Kassassin, the forerunner of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tel-el-Kebir<br/>
</span>and the modern history of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
About a mile from the station, and just before the<br/>
train begins to slow down, the whole extent of Arabi's<br/>
entrenchments can be seen on the right, the railway line<br/>
actually passing through the bastion placed to guard<br/>
his extreme right flank. The battle-field is well worth<br/>
a visit; forts and trenches are still practically perfect,<br/>
and twenty years of wind and weather have done little to<br/>
destroy these relics of the famous fight. I visited Tel<br/>
a few months ago, and was much struck by this. Even<br/>
the marks of gun wheels and limbers, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hoofstrokes </span>of their plunging teams, are clearly defined<br/>
in the hard, pebbly surface. Specific movements of<br/>
the guns may be traced, and one can almost hear the<br/>
