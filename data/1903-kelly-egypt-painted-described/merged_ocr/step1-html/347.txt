now alive with fish, which, finding escape impossible,<br/>
leap high into the air, only to be met by a swoop of<br/>
voracious sea-birds from above.<br/>
<br/>
As the "catch" is being ladled into the boat, the<br/>
splashing leaping mass of fish, amongst which hundreds<br/>
of men are deliriously shouting, combined with the<br/>
screeching of the birds, the flapping of wings, and the<br/>
hissing of the water, makes up a scene of confusion<br/>
and wild excitement which baffles description and is not<br/>
readily forgotten. The take of fish on these occasions<br/>
is of course enormous, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">h </span>a drive as I have<br/>

Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menzala </span>is normally quiet in its character, and<br/>
being closely preserved against shooting has become a<br/>
home for millions of water-fowl. Neither on the lake<br/>
itself nor in the surrounding marshes are firearms<br/>
permitted, though the "wily" native will often replenish his larder by diving, and catching wild duck<br/>
by the feet while unconsciously swimming above.<br/>
<br/>
Pelicans and waders of all kinds abound, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">firstnamed </span>being of the most friendly disposition, and most<br/>
of the boats have a tame specimen on board. They<br/>
are interesting birds; their plumage is beautiful in<br/>
the tender suggestion of pink showing through the<br/>
white down, while the black or maroon points on<br/>
wings and tail, and their multi-coloured bills and<br/>
orange pouches, form a pretty colour-scheme, and the<br/>

in a manner which IS quite irresistible.<br/>
