</span>The harvest being gathered, threshing follows, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>picturesque operation of peculiarly Biblical interest.<br/>
The corn being spread in a large circular pile on some<br/>
clear space of ground close to the village, a yoke of<br/>
oxen are driven round and round upon it, drawing<br/>
after them a wooden vehicle rather like a large chair on<br/>
runners. This is called the "nurag," and is ingenious.<br/>
Between the runners which assist the oxen in beating<br/>
out the corn, are several circular knives, which revolve<br/>
as the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">nurag </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>travels, and simultaneously cut up the<br/>
straw into the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">tibbin</span>," which is the staple fodder for<br/>
stable animals. Though strictly adhering to the Scriptural command and leaving his yoke unmuzzled, the<br/>
driver, seated in the "nurag," vigorously wields his<br/>
whip of ox-hide, and gives them little opportunity for<br/>
forage.<br/>
<br/>
When the operation is over there remains a high<br/>
mound of grain, chaff, and chopped straw which must<br/>
be separated. The means employed are simple to a<br/>
degree. Taking advantage of a breeze, a man with a<br/>
large wooden shovel tosses the mixture high into the<br/>
air. The corn, being heavy, falls 1n a <span style="color: #0000FF;">gradually</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Increasing </span>pile close to the workman' s feet, the chaff and straw<br/>
blowing away and forming a second pile of "<span style="color: #ff0000;">tibbin</span>"<br/>
some little distance off; each is then separately gathered<br/>
and stored, and the operation is complete.<br/>
<br/>
Though hard work is imperative, the increased<br/>
water-supply resulting from barrage-works and <span style="color: #ff0000;">canalbuilding </span>enables the farmer to get the best return for<br/>
<br/>
his labour; and even reclaimed desert-land may, with<br/>
