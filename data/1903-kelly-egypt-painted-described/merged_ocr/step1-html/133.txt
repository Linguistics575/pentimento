<span>Mosques and Public <span style="color: #ff0000;">Buildings<br/>
</span>should be studied, however. F <span style="color: #ff0000;">orbidden </span>by his <span style="color: #0000FF;">religion<br/>
</span>to reproduce human or animal forms, as savouring of<br/>
idolatry, ordinary pictorial representation was denied<br/>
the Moslem artist, who was therefore obliged to seek<br/>
some other means of expression.' This has resulted in<br/>
the development of a form of applied art, rich in its<br/>
elaboration, most suitable to its purpose, and in every<br/>
way original and artistic.<br/>
<br/>
Two dominant features will at once strike the <span style="color: #0000FF;">beholder</span>: first, the pendentive form of carving or plasterwork which embellishes corbels and brackets, and lends<br/>
such an air of grace and lightness to canopy or arch;<br/>
and secondly, that <span style="color: #0000FF;">curiously </span>involved geometric design<br/>
which <span style="color: #ff0000;">characterise </span>almost all their schemes of decoration. Both forms are almost universally applied, and<br/>
are found alike in buildings and furniture.<br/>
<br/>
The best examples of the pendentive are to be found<br/>
in the corbelling which supports the stages of minarets,<br/>
or in the cornices and doorways of such mosques as<br/>
Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barkiik</span>, El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghury</span>, and Sultan Hassan; while<br/>
the dome of Kait Bey, the bronze doors of Muayyad<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kalarm</span>, and the panels of nearly every "mimbar,"<br/>
or pulpit, are enriched with designs of a geometric<br/>
character.<br/>
<br/>
On studying these designs, it will be found that in<br/>
most cases the radiating lines emanate from a rosette<br/>
which usually forms the centre of a panel, or in larger<br/>
spaces is repeated at intervals over the whole surface.<br/>
<br/>
1 Exceptions occur, as in the frieze of Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">H-mu</span>, but this introduction <span style="color: #ff0000;">of<br/>
</span>animal life is usually the work of Persian <span style="color: #0000FF;">decorate</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>.<br/>
