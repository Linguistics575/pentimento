<span>Mosques and Public Buildings<br/>
<br/>
to remind ourselves that its evolution dates from the<br/>
early part of the seventh century, when in the twentyfirst year of the Hejira (A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">642</span>) the "Jehad" proclaimed by Mohammed had resulted not only in the<br/>
subjugation of Arabia, Syria, and Persia, but witnessed<br/>
also the conquest of Egypt and the building of the<br/>
first Mohammedan mosque in Cairo.1<br/>
<br/>
Initially, Mohammedan art was simply the adaptation of existing forms to the necessities of the new<br/>
faith, the models being principally the Byzantine<br/>
churches or the Roman temples in Syria and Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
In plan the mosque closely follows that of the<br/>
Basilica, the chancel becoming reduced in size, and<br/>
taking the form of the "mihrab" or niche in the<br/>
eastern wall, but in other respects, at least in the<br/>
earlier periods of the style, remaining much the<br/>
same.<br/>
<br/>
The first real development was the substitution, for<br/>
structural reasons, of the pointed arch in place of the<br/>
semicircular one which <span style="color: #ff0000;">characterise </span>Byzantine and<br/>
Roman alike; and in the building of the Mosque of<br/>
Ibn Tulun in A.D. 876 <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>find for the first time<br/>
a building in which the "broken arch <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>was carried out<br/>
throughout the entire structure, and the first expression<br/>
of purely Saracenic principles of decoration. This was<br/>
nearly three hundred years before the pointed arch<br/>
was introduced into England, and was contemporary<br/>
with our Anglo-Saxon period of architecture, while<br/>
before the introduction of the Norman style into<br/>
<br/>
