and district was a "den of thieves" (<span style="color: #ff0000;">kharamieh</span>); but<br/>
since the quartering of troops there, the people were<br/>
well behaved, and the value of all property had<br/>
improved. His influence upon the Egyptian troops<br/>
has been most marked. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1883 </span>I saw what remained<br/>
of Arabi's army reviewed by the then Khedive; it<br/>
was simply a rabble, ill clothed, only partially armed,<br/>
and, as it seemed to me, lacking in even the elements<br/>
of discipline and drill. See the same troops to-day,<br/>
after twenty years of close association with their English<br/>
comrades and training by British officers. Their<br/>
regiments, smart and soldierly, move with a dash and<br/>
precision which compare <span style="color: #ff0000;">favourably </span>with our own<br/>
crack corps; and, whatever their views before conscription, there is no doubt that, once enlisted, the native<br/>
soldier has developed a passion for drill which is quite<br/>
remarkable.<br/>

Looking back towards Cairo, there is a fine view<br/>
of the tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs</span>, and the Citadel Mosque<br/>
beyond, which, particularly at sunset, is very striking.<br/>
Indeed, many pictures may be made hereabouts, and<br/>
it is curious how well the Mohammed Ali Mosque looks<br/>
from a distance, though in itself so poor in design and<br/>
proportion. Its situation, however, is superb, and it<br/>
dominates everything for miles around. There is a<br/>
particularly striking view of it from near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tiira</span>.<br/>
Here the intervening desert rises between you and<br/>
Cairo, blotting out all of the city except the Citadel<br/>
itself, which, blue in the distance, stands up solitary<br/>
and graceful beyond the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ridge</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
