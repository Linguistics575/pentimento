<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Though in my opinion the Cairene has <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>traits<br/>
which command respect, it is inevitable that here, as<br/>
in all great centres of population, immorality and<br/>
crime should exist. I am afraid that association with<br/>
Europeans has had a somewhat <span style="color: #ff0000;">demoralising </span>influence,<br/>
and the former <span style="color: #0000FF;">single-mindless </span>of the Mohammedan<br/>
has to some extent succumbed to Western indulgence,<br/>
while the large introduction of Europeans of the lowest<br/>
class into the life of the cities has had the effect<br/>
of destroying much that is good in their religion,<br/>
while at the same time introducing nearly every<br/>
European vice. Yet, notwithstanding this, there is<br/>
hardly a street in Cairo where the traveller may not<br/>
pass unmolested, a statement that could certainly not<br/>
be made of our lowest slums at home.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me a crying shame that Cairo should<br/>
be so overrun with low-class wine-bars, whose tenants<br/>
are not required to have any licence, or apparently<br/>
submit to any control whatever, and where wines and<br/>
spirits of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">vilest </span>and most inflammatory nature are<br/>
retailed. Surely something in the nature of supervision<br/>
might be attempted; for it is a most regrettable fact<br/>
that when once the Mohammedan violates his religion<br/>
by indulging in strong drink, he almost invariably<br/>
becomes a sot, even if the regular consumption of<br/>
absinthe and brandy, to which he becomes a slave,<br/>
does not make of him a criminal or a lunatic.<br/>
<br/>
Another consequence of Western association may<br/>
be noticed in the gradual modification of costume.<br/>
A few years ago all natives, of whatever rank, wore<br/>
