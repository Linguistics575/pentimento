</span>which entirely alter their character. I have been<br/>
greatly struck by this, and it is really difficult to say<br/>
that you know the Nile, so varying are its moods.<br/>
<br/>
How unlike its morning aspect does any given spot<br/>
appear at sunset! and the sudden change of wind from<br/>
north to south will immediately effect a complete<br/>
change in the appearance of your surroundings. Early<br/>
mists, still water, changing light or wind, each in turn<br/>
transforms an individual scene into as many different<br/>
pictures. Added to this is the difference in your point<br/>
of view consequent upon the rising and falling of its<br/>
water-level, the varying incident of river-life, and the<br/>
ever-changing character-studies the banks afford.<br/>
<br/>
It is not my object, however, to enter upon any<br/>
detailed description of the river, but rather to point out<br/>
a few features which strike me as interesting, and<br/>
typical of the journey as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
Almost immediately on leaving Cairo a new country<br/>
unfolds itself. The Mokattam Hills and pearly-tinted<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tiira </span>range appear very different when seen from the<br/>
water-level, and, after passing the palm-groves of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrach√©n </span>and the various groups of pyramids which lie beyond, all that is already familiar is left behind, and Ayat<br/>
marks the beginning of what is new to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">voyageur</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Here, and for a considerable distance to the south,<br/>
the hills on either side have fallen away, and interest is<br/>
confined to the river itself and its high mud-banks. But<br/>
how very interesting it is! It is blowing freshly from<br/>
the east, and little clouds slightly wind-torn cast <span style="color: #0000FF;">their<br/>
</span>fleeting shadows upon growing corn and muddy water<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
