camels laden with tomatoes, etc. Here is a half-bred<br/>
Arab shepherd with his piebald flock, again a wild-eyed<br/>
Bedawi on his "hagin" l employed as a "<span style="color: #ff0000;">gaffir</span>'" on<br/>
some neighbouring estate. Old-world houses, formerly<br/>
occupied by the highest in the land, are falling into a<br/>
disreputable old age. Their gates, half smothered in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bougainvillaea</span>, open into gardens of wild and unkept<br/>
beauty, where marble fountains and statuary testify<br/>
pathetically to a former glory long since departed.<br/>
On either side of the road are glimpses of farm-lands<br/>
well wooded with palms, acacia, sycamore, and cypress<br/>
trees, through which in the distance may be seen the<br/>
white houses of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Demerdache </span>relieved against the Gibel<br/>
Achmar beyond. Here are plenty of subjects of a<br/>
pastoral nature which lend themselves to poetic treatment.<br/>
<br/>
Down by the river-side at Rhoda are subjects of<br/>
another kind. Here the old palaces of the island and<br/>
the houses of Masr-el-Atika rise from the narrow backwater, and lead the eye delightfully to the vista beyond.<br/>
"Nuggars<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>innumerable enter from the larger river,<br/>
and birdlike gliding over its smooth surface, deposit<br/>

<br/>
It is an animated scene as the work of unloading<br/>
proceeds amidst the babel of noise inseparable from any<br/>
congregation of natives. Women and children are there<br/>
washing their <span style="color: #ff0000;">clpthing </span>and utensils, or drawing their<br/>
domestic water-supply. Over all is a sun-bathed atmo<br/>
