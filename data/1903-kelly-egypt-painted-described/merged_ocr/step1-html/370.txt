<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
a good day's duck-shooting. One of the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span>of all the canals in Egypt, however, is the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Baht </span>Yusef in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayiim</span>, which is fed by the Nile at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Assist</span>, 200 miles away. Originally built in the time<br/>
of Rameses by Joseph, whose name it bears, it still<br/>
supplies the province with a rushing stream of <span style="color: #ff0000;">drinkingwater</span>, which encircles the whole town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medinet-elFayiim</span>, and on whose banks are some of the most<br/>
picturesque canal scenery to be met with.<br/>
<br/>
This province of <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ayiim </span>is one of the few places <span style="color: #0000FF;">off<br/>
</span>the beaten track which is open to the uninitiated visitor.<br/>
The town has one or more hotels where moderate<br/>
comfort may be enjoyed, and is connected with Cairo<br/>
by a regular train service; but should the visitor be<br/>
obliged to put up with a little inconvenience at times,<br/>
the beauty of the country is ample compensation, and<br/>
the feeling of personal freedom enjoyed is sufficient<br/>
recompense for the loss of any accustomed luxury.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Medinet-el-Fayiim </span>is in many respects a <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable </span>town, and well worth exploring. Its bazaar, which<br/>
is the longest in Egypt, is covered for its entire length<br/>
of 1% miles, and several times crosses the various canals<br/>
on bridges. Picturesque at all times, I saw it some<br/>
years ago when decorated in honour of the Khedive's<br/>
visit, and it really was a remarkable sight. Though the<br/>
Egyptian is always clever at decoration, the people of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayiim </span>excelled on this occasion. Triumphal arches,<br/>
gay with flags and coloured lanterns, reached the roofs<br/>
at intervals; the shop-fronts were brilliant with rich<br/>
hangings and trophies of plants and flowers; crimson<br/>
