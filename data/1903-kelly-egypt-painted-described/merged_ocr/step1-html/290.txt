<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>is really very beautiful, and, no matter under<br/>
what effect of light or from what point of view it may<br/>
be seen, it is always a picture; and, jewel-like, the beauty<br/>
of the island is enhanced by the setting of rugged hills<br/>
and flowing stream which encircle it.<br/>
<br/>
I recently paid a last farewell visit to Phila, and<br/>
already the work necessary for its preservation had<br/>
converted the temple into a workshop, and, by the cutting down of its trees, and the covering of the natural<br/>
banks with masonry, much of its original charm has<br/>
been destroyed. Whether the great dam will result in<br/>
its eventual destruction or not, its banks at any rate<br/>
will be submerged, and it can never again be seen as the<br/>
beautiful <span style="color: #0000FF;">verdure-clad </span>island we have known.<br/>
<br/>
The temple itself has never been completed, the<br/>
advent of the Romans and the amour: of Cleopatra no<br/>
doubt being among the contributing causes. This<br/>
perhaps adds a little to the interest of the building, as<br/>
it gives us an insight into the methods adopted in its<br/>
construction. In the colonnade which leads to the<br/>
great pylon, the columns are remarkable for the great<br/>
variety of their capitals, and in some cases they are still<br/>
uncarved, only the first "blocking out "of the stone<br/>
having been done. From this, as well from other<br/>
unfinished decorations elsewhere, it is fair to assume<br/>
that the Egyptians were in the habit of first building,<br/>
and then elaborating their carvings in sim, where the<br/>
full effect of the design might be estimated from time<br/>
to time; a better principle, to my mind, than our own<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>which usually completes such decoration on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mason's<br/>
