<span>Riding through the Land of Goshen<br/>
<br/>
Everything was quiet, and in the darkness I could<br/>
see little, the roadway being roofed by a thatch of<br/>
some kind, which prevented the starlight penetrating.<br/>
After groping about in the dark, I stumbled upon a<br/>
raised platform of earth, on which, rolled up in my<br/>
blanket, I went to sleep. On awakening in the morning I discovered that my impromptu bedchamber was<br/>
simply a small courtyard which formed a kitchen, the<br/>
common property of two or three adjacent houses, and<br/>
that I was sleeping on an earth-oven, the fire of which<br/>
some one had just set alight. On discovering me, the<br/>
women immediately fled, but presently the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Omdeh </span>and<br/>
his headmen came to offer their "<span style="color: #0000FF;">salaams </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">inquire </span>as to my comfort during the night. I was able to<br/>
assure him that I had slept well, and was quite ready<br/>
for breakfast. During the day I made a sketch of my<br/>
curious bedroom, a proceeding which excited considerable interest among the onlookers. "Why," said one<br/>
man to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Omdeh</span>, "is the Effendi painting this poor<br/>
place<span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>"Hush," said the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Omdeh</span>, "he is a friend<br/>
of the Queen's, and he will take the picture to her and<br/>
say,' See, your Majesty, what poor houses these people<br/>
live in,' and she will reply,<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes</span>, poor fellows, here is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">,5 </span>Soo; go and tell them to build better ones!<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>"<br/>
<br/>
Outside the village were several extremely beautiful<br/>
subjects. The mud of which the buildings are composed had been excavated on the spot, the hollow so<br/>
caused filling up with infiltrated water, forming a large<br/>
"birkeh" or pool, which partly encircled the town.<br/>
These "birkeh" are invariably found in conjunction<br/>
