<span>Cairo<br/>
<br/>
There are a great many of these khans in Cairo,<br/>
particularly in the Bab-en-Nasr and Bab-esh-Sharieh<br/>
quarters, and they were usually named after the<br/>
founder, as in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan-el-Khalily </span>(Khalil's Inn), or took<br/>
their name from the particular trade affected, as in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Stlk-ez-z√©t </span>(Oil Bazaar), etc. In many cases these<br/>
khans have good architectural features. Most of them,<br/>
however, are falling into decay, steamboats and railways<br/>
having to a large extent destroyed the caravan trade<br/>
they were built to accommodate.<br/>
<br/>
Cairo is a dusty place, and one of the most<br/>
important of street trades is that of the water-carriers,<br/>
and of these there are several grades. <span style="color: #0000FF;">First </span>the<br/>
"sakka," who dispenses unfiltered water from his <span style="color: #0000FF;">goatskin-a </span>most laborious trade, as the pay is small and<br/>
a skin of water weighs very heavily. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Formerly </span>the<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">sakka</span>" was obliged to go to the river, perhaps a<br/>
mile or more away, for his supply; but to-day standpipes in the street relieve him of this extra labour.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Frequently </span>the shopkeepers in a street will jointly<br/>
employ one or more of these water-carriers to continually sprinkle the streets and fill the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">zeers</span>" l<br/>
of those whose trade requires such a supply. Their<br/>
"sprinkling," however, is of a vigorous and thorough<br/>
nature, and I was once, while painting in the street,<br/>
completely saturated, and my picture swamped. Very<br/>
vexing, no doubt; but when the poor man fell on his<br/>
knees, and clasping mine implored forgiveness, I could<br/>
not find it in my heart to be angry, and so dismissed<br/>
