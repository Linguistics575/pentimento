picturesque in each class of life, and endeavour to<br/>
convey some impression of the varied landscape the<br/>
country affords.<br/>
<br/>
My first introduction to Egypt was in 1883, and<br/>
was ushered in in rather a startling manner. We were<br/>
still two or three hours' steaming distance before<br/>
land could possibly be in sight, when suddenly we<br/>
saw, inverted in the sky, a perfect miragic reproduction of Alexandria, in which Pharos Light, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ras-elTin </span>Palace, and other prominent features were easily<br/>
distinguishable. The illusion continued for a considerable time, and eventually as suddenly disappeared, when,<br/>
an hour or two later, the real city slowly appeared above<br/>
the horizon! A good augury, surely, of the wonders<br/>
I hoped to discover on landing!<br/>
<br/>
Though the journey from Alexandria to Cairo is<br/>
more convenient, it is desirable in some ways to land at<br/>
Port Said. The railway journey is no doubt longer,<br/>
but its tedium is relieved by a greater variety of scene<br/>
than I have experienced on any journey of the same<br/>
length. Even Port Said is not devoid of pictures, and<br/>
as an example of engineering skill and commercial<br/>
enterprise the Canal is always interesting. The<br/>
periodic <span style="color: #0000FF;">games</span>, with their red-tiled roofs peeping<br/>
from among the surrounding foliage, look pretty in the<br/>
sunlight; while the hybrid population thronging the<br/>
stations, and an occasional coastguard patrolling the<br/>
Canal on camel-back, enable you to realise the fact that<br/>
you have left the New World behind and are on the<br/>
threshold of the East. <span style="color: #0000FF;">r<br/>
