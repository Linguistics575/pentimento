agreeable item, he showed us his ambers and pipes, of<br/>
which he had a large number, some of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mouth</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">...<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pieces </span>being richly jewelled. These pipes (<span style="color: #ff0000;">shebribik</span>)<br/>
are almost always regarded as heirlooms, and remain in<br/>
a family for generations, so that Abd-el-Salaam<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>collection may be regarded as his pedigree, of which he was<br/>
justly proud.<br/>
<br/>
The outskirts of the town are no less picturesque<br/>
than its water-side, and in the principal cemetery there is<br/>
one of the most impressive domes in Egypt, its bulbous<br/>
form being most uncommon. This tomb-mosque, of<br/>
which I give an illustration, is the burial-place of a<br/>
former sheykh of the town, and in many features is,<br/>
so far as I know, unique. The mosque minarets also<br/>
are of extreme elegance and very lofty, and occur frequently in various directions. These Arab cemeteries<br/>
are<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>always interesting, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">found </span>a great variety of<br/>
subjects among them. In one tomb, evidently that of<br/>
a sailor, I noticed suspended above the grave a <span style="color: #ff0000;">wellexecuted </span>model of a vessel, the only case in which I<br/>
have seen such an addition to their usually bare interior.<br/>
<br/>
It will be seen from what I have said, and from the<br/>
illustrations I give, that Damietta is well worth a visit<br/>
from the artist or intelligent Sightseer; and I may add<br/>
that the people are most polite and willing to oblige,<br/>
and I found no difficulty in getting models here, any<br/>
passer-by apparently being willing to pose if asked.<br/>
<br/>
Damietta itself is easily accessible by train, and h<br/>
two Greek hotels which are quite comfortable enough for<br/>
men who can rough it a little. The river-trip, however,<br/>
