<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
tourists who buy souvenirs in Cairo will often find that<br/>
the case in which they are packed costs as much as the<br/>
articles themselves<span style="color: #ff0000;">!<br/>
<br/>
</span>That Egypt was not always treeless is shown by<br/>
the ancient forestry records, and reference to timber<br/>
growing for the building of its fleets. It is therefore<br/>
particularly interesting to note the experiment in the<br/>
cultivation of timber-trees now being carried on by<br/>
the Ministry of Finance under the direction of Mr.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Birdwood. The site selected for the nursery is at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tel-el-Kew</span>, in itself a fact of some importance as<br/>
proving the feasibility of making virgin desert profitable; and though only in its infancy, many hundreds of<br/>
thousands of timber and fruit-trees have been successfully planted or sown there, and what a few years ago<br/>
was simply a waste of pebble and sand is now a<br/>
luxuriant garden<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Iam not able to give any detailed list of the trees<br/>
and shrubs which have been planted, but among them<br/>
are a great variety of pines, eucalyptus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">caoutchouc</span>,<br/>
etc., as well as pomegranates, oranges, and plums.<br/>
With few exceptions, the trees have done well; some<br/>
already are twenty feet or so in height, and many young<br/>
beds have been successfully raised from seed. That the<br/>
trees will grow is established; and if it can be shown<br/>
that, as they develop, their economic properties are<br/>
maintained, a new and valuable asset will be added to<br/>
the resources of Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The experiment is, I think, of the greatest value,<br/>
and the possibility of the country being eventually <span style="color: #ff0000;">able<br/>
