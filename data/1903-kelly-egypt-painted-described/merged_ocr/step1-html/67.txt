sticky decoction, and necessitating the subsequent application of more than one skinful of water ere the<br/>
old gentleman's locks were restored to a presentable<br/>
condition.<br/>

You will also notice the bread-sellers-men and<br/>
women who, with basket or barrow, hawk their flat<br/>
loaves of unleavened bread about the street, and<br/>
another superior grade carrying a basket with sticks<br/>
rising from its brim, upon which are threaded little<br/>
circular cakes of sweetened bread; while dates, eggs,<br/>
vegetables, sugar-cane, and other edibles are always to<br/>
be bought in the streets.<br/>
<br/>
Another curious street trade is that of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">incenseburner</span>, who with brass brazier swinging fumigates<br/>
your shop or clothing for the fraction of a penny; and<br/>
it must be confessed that some corners into which you<br/>
will penetrate are so <span style="color: #0000FF;">evil-smelling </span>as to render his good<br/>

there is a peculiar odour, common to all Eastern towns,<br/>
whose quiet intensity pervades everything, and it is a<br/>

Still, bad <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours </span>notwithstanding, these narrow tortuous<br/>
streets are very fascinating; every turn presents a<br/>
picture, and the very dirt has a charm.<br/>
<br/>
Wandering about the streets is tiring, but it is the<br/>
only way in which the real Cairo can be understood.<br/>
Oriental life cannot be properly appreciated under the<br/>
guidance of a dragoman who hurries you from place<br/>
to place, ignoring the living history so carelessly<br/>
