<br/>
the merits of his beast and claiming your patronage.<br/>
On landing you are surrounded, and all the efforts of<br/>
the local policeman (who certainly does not spare the<br/>
rod) fail to protect the traveller from the pushing and<br/>
pulling of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">donkey-boys</span>, as each one strives by<br/>
main force to get you on to the back of his beast.<br/>
Nothing is of any use but a little of the vernacular,<br/>
and it is astonishing how amenable they become on<br/>
being addressed in their own language. You are then<br/>
permitted to select your donkey and mount in peace,<br/>
and are for the rest of the day spoken of as "the<br/>
Pasha" or "the Bey"; and the very boy or man<br/>
who shortly before was giving you the maximum<br/>
of annoyance, now scornfully reproves the passing<br/>
mendicant with, "Be quiet, you fool, don't you know<br/>
the Bey is an Egyptian and speaks Arabic l <span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>The ride from Keneh to the ruins of Dendera is<br/>
very pleasant, the road lying entirely across fields and<br/>
being good enough for a gallop, and I have usually<br/>
found my donkey here one of excellent paces.<br/>
<br/>
In the field as you pass the cattle are grazing<br/>
attended by good-looking boys and girls, while <span style="color: #ff0000;">starknaked </span>urchins, wound round with ropes of plaited<br/>
grass and flowers, perform a kind of morris-dance<br/>
for your edification. The country-people here are<br/>
polite, and greet you respectfully with "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Naharak </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">said </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>"<br/>
(May your day be <span style="color: #0000FF;">happy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>); or, on your departure,<br/>
the courteous salutation, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Roh-es-Salaam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>" (Go in<br/>
peace <span style="color: #ff0000;">O</span>, to which you respond, "Ma <span style="color: #ff0000;">salaami </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">( </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">With<br/>
