find an hour or more of steady riding necessary before<br/>

<br/>
</span>As I have <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to show, the country-people<br/>
are almost universally hospitable and considerate. The<br/>
only case to the contrary which comes within my own<br/>
knowledge was once when, on reaching <span style="color: #ff0000;">San-el-Hap</span>,<br/>
our servants, who had been sent to cut <span style="color: #ff0000;">bercime </span>for our<br/>
horses, were assaulted in the field by some of the villagers, who objected to supplying fodder to strangers;<br/>
and in this case the incivility was punished by a sound<br/>
beating from the Sheykh.<br/>
<br/>
This incident suggests another point worthy of<br/>
notice, in the paternal attitude of the sheykh to his<br/>
villagers; in most cases he is looked up to as the father<br/>
of his people, and his authority is seldom if ever<br/>
questioned. I was once present at a land sale where<br/>
the legal transfer of a plot of land, which had been<br/>
bought by a local sheykh, was about to be completed,<br/>
when claim was laid to it by one of his followers. The<br/>
sheykh, a strong big man with only one eye, said not a<br/>
word, but, grasping his staff, took a few hasty strides<br/>
towards him, and, had he not been held back by those<br/>
around, would probably have brained him. Trembling<br/>
with indignation, he exclaimed to the inspector, "My<br/>
Bey, I cannot help it; I must <span style="color: #0000FF;">castigate </span>him: he is one<br/>
of my sheep which I have brought up."<br/>
<br/>
1 Distances are always reckoned by time and not by miles. Thus, in response to<br/>
inquiries, the answer will be, so many hours "by your legs," or so many "by horse."<br/>
