<span>Religion and Character of the Egyptians<br/>
<br/>
pursuits were only varied by occasional military service<br/>
or labour upon public works.<br/>
<br/>
One by one, succeeding dynasties have succumbed<br/>
to more vigorous and powerful successors. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharaohonic </span>successions and the Persian, Greek, or<br/>
Roman conquerors have gone, each in turn destroying<br/>
the aristocracy which preceded it, and of whom no trace<br/>
now remains but in the temples or monuments of their<br/>
day. But through all the political vicissitudes of the<br/>
country, and frequent change of masters, the slave class<br/>
has continued till to-day in the persons of the fellahin.<br/>
Little altered in character, following the same avocations,<br/>
using the same implements, and above all rendering the<br/>
same servile obedience to the dominant power as was<br/>
the case in the days of Rameses or Seti. Docile and<br/>
obedient, good-humoured and industrious, they are,<br/>
and always have been, a nation of slaves. Passive in<br/>
affliction and rendering a ready obedience to the stronger<br/>
will which rules them, they are entirely devoid of that<br/>
spirit of manly independence so characteristic of their<br/>
Bedawin neighbours, and lacking in the initiative of the<br/>
newer Western races.<br/>
<br/>
Since the Mohammedan conquest in the year<br/>
638 A.D., this passivity of character has been still<br/>
further accentuated by the fatalistic teaching of their<br/>
religion.<br/>
<br/>
In the year <span style="color: #0000FF;">1517 </span>Egypt came under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">domination<br/>
</span>of the Turks, and, with the brief interruption of<br/>
Napoleon's occupation (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1798- </span>1801), has continued<br/>
under their government until the present time.<br/>
