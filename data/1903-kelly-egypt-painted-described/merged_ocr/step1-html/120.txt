</span>MOSQUES AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS<br/>
<br/>
EVERY one who visits Cairo "does<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>the mosques<br/>
as a matter of course, and evinces a certain amount<br/>
of interest in what he sees. The blue tiles of Ibrahim<br/>
Aga, the splendid effect of the great doorway of the<br/>
Sultan Hassan Mosque, or the delicate ornament and<br/>
graceful minaret of Kait Bey are each in turn admired.<br/>
To how many of such visitors, however, does it occur<br/>
that in them is embodied much of the history of Cairo,<br/>
and that in its mosques and public buildings is the<br/>
most perfect expression of that elegant and distinctive<br/>
art which we call Saracenic? Here is an architecture<br/>
of well-defined periods, complete in its expression,<br/>
elaborate in the application of its ornament, of older<br/>
date than the Gothic style they admire and reverence<br/>
so much at home, and of which it is, to some extent at<br/>
least, the possible origin.<br/>
<br/>
It is not within the province of this book to enter<br/>
into an elaborate history of the origin and development<br/>
of the style: the subject has been fully dealt with<br/>
elsewhere by experts. It will suffice for our purpose<br/>
