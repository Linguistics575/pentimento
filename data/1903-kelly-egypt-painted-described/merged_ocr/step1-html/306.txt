<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>has almost disappeared, except during high <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ni<br/>
<br/>
</span>when for a brief period the <span style="color: #0000FF;">long-suffering </span>watermen c<br/>
ply their trade profitably. In some places villages, b.<br/>
originally close upon the river-bank, are now so far <span style="color: #0000FF;">fro<br/>
</span>the remnant of the stream trickling on the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">si<br/>
</span>that their women must traverse nearly a mile of s<br/>
and mud before they can fill their jars. Not only<br/>
the supply limited, but it is correspondingly bad<br/>
quality. The shallow stream cannot remain fresh <span style="color: #0000FF;">un<br/>
</span>the hot sun, while <span style="color: #0000FF;">debris </span>of all kinds decomposing in.<br/>
pollute still further an already tainted supply. With<br/>
further hundred miles or so of steadily <span style="color: #ff0000;">diminishi<br/>
</span>volume and constantly added contamination, it<br/>
readily be imagined that the inhabitants of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">c<br/>
</span>towns have to undergo real privation in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">matter </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">r<br/>
</span>their drinking-supply, and one can only wonder t<br/>
disease is not more common among them. No <span style="color: #0000FF;">do<br/>
</span>centuries of gradual inoculation protect the native fro<br/>
the effects of water impurities which few <span style="color: #ff0000;">Europea<br/>
</span>could withstand. Still, natural immunity <span style="color: #0000FF;">notwithstand<br/>
</span>ing, an exceeding bitter cry for water constantly <span style="color: #ff0000;">go </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>up from these poor folk, and one cannot but enter t<br/>
strongest protest against the manner in which the lo<br/>
river is neglected by the authorities in Cairo; f<br/>
while the rest of the Delta continues to prosper <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>marvellous degree, it is to some extent at the exp<br/>
of a large community whose capital is in their <span style="color: #ff0000;">boa<br/>
</span>and their trade upon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">water</span>. Poor patient folk<br/>
A small sum annually expended in dredging and <span style="color: #0000FF;">c<br/>
</span>serving the river would at least relieve their di<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">124<br/>
