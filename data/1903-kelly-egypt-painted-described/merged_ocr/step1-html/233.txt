Groundings, however, are very frequent, and entail<br/>
hard work upon the crew. The anchor is sent out<br/>
on a boat, and while the winch is working on the<br/>
hawser the hands exert themselves to the utmost in<br/>
their efforts to shove the steamer <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>with poles.<br/>
Sometimes hours are occupied in the work, the crew<br/>
supporting each other with cries of "O Allah!"<br/>
"Work, Mohammed!<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>etc., and a doggerel chant in<br/>
which many English words appear, until the joyful<br/>
shout of "Mashi! "( She <span style="color: #0000FF;">moves</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>) proclaims your vessel<br/>
once more afloat and soon to continue her voyage<br/>
to the Cataract.<br/>
<br/>
The prevailing wind on the Nile is from the<br/>
north, a fortunate provision of nature which enables<br/>
boats to sail against a stream which afterwards, should<br/>
the wind be contrary, is strong enough to drift them<br/>
back again. A curious fact also may here be noticed,<br/>
and that is, that there is almost always some breeze on<br/>
the water, even though a short distance away from the<br/>
banks the air is still; and the traveller may often see<br/>
boats briskly sailing on the river a mile away, while<br/>
he perhaps is sweltering in a hot and stagnant air.<br/>
This circumstance should always be remembered by<br/>
travellers. Nothing is more dangerous than, after<br/>
some hot excursion on land, to continue the journey<br/>
on the water without protection of some kind from<br/>
the cooler air. This is especially the case on the<br/>
downward journey, when your steamer, probably<br/>
travelling at the rate of ten or twelve knots, is driving<br/>
into a north wind of equal velocity. Then, if you are<br/>
