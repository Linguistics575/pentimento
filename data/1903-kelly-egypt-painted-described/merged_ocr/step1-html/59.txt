coloured stock upon still brighter papers, a vivid<br/>
contrast to the adjoining charcoal-store or gloomy<br/>
shoeing-forge. Gay saddlery, the glitter of the coppersmiths' display, and the ever-lively native cafe, combine<br/>
with the life of the street in forming pictures calculated<br/>
to drive the artist to despair. How busy and how<br/>
interesting it all is! Notice that Ethiopian whose<br/>
purple-black skin gleams plum-like from below the<br/>
snowy turban, or this tall Nubian whose bronze-like<br/>
features shine in the sun from amidst their setting<br/>
of ivory whites and blue. The closely veiled women<br/>

Through this motley hurrying throng the stately<br/>

his way, and with warning cries the donkey-boy or<br/>
"carro<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>driver seeks to clear a path through the<br/>
crowd. The cries of the drivers are incessant, each<br/>
passenger being separately addressed, according to rank<br/>
or occupation. Thus: "Make room, 0 my mother<span style="color: #ff0000;">!</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
