<span>CHAPTER IX<br/>
<br/>
CANAL LIFE IN THE DELTA<br/>
<br/>
LITTLE as the Nile below Cairo is known to visitors,<br/>
still less are the majority acquainted with that vast<br/>
network of irrigating canals which intersect the country<br/>
in all directions. In sightseeing as in picture-making<br/>
the "point of view "is everything; and many of these<br/>
canals being navigable, a trip by water through the<br/>
Delta is one which may be made in comfort, and affords<br/>
scenes and incidents which differ essentially from those<br/>
presented to a traveller on horseback on the higher level<br/>
of the canal bank.<br/>
<br/>
On the eastern side of the Delta these canals finally<br/>
empty themselves into Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menzala</span>, an inland sea,<br/>
stretching from Port Said to Damietta, and in itself<br/>
well worthy of a visit.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Damietta, a ride of some two miles through<br/>
a country of extreme fertility brings you to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghait-enNasara</span>, a fishing-station on the lake, where is immediately presented to you a phase of life peculiar to the<br/>
district.<br/>
<br/>
The fishing industry of the lake is of great importance, and employs profitably a large number of people<br/>
