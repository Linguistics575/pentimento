<span>The Desert and the Bedawin<br/>
<br/>
the seemingly inevitable collision. Etiquette forbids<br/>
any movement on your part, as this would imply<br/>
suspicion of the rider's skill.<br/>
<br/>
By far the most exciting, however, of these sports<br/>
is "jerid "or javelin play. This usually occurs when<br/>
two friendly tribes meet upon a suitable stretch of<br/>
desert, each tribe being represented by several hundred<br/>
horsemen, which are drawn up in lines facing each<br/>
other a quarter of a mile or more apart.<br/>
<br/>
The champion of one side will then ride up to the<br/>
opposed line, and, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">scorn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>ridicule of them and<br/>
a boastful narration of his own exploits, challenge one<br/>
of them to fight.<br/>
<br/>
On the appearance of the opposing champion the first<br/>
must turn and fly, chased by the other, his endeavour<br/>
being to reach his own lines before being caught by his<br/>
pursuer. Should he succeed in doing so, both turn,<br/>
and the positions of pursuer and fugitive are reversed,<br/>
but it always ends in a fierce, though friendly, fight in<br/>
the centre, where each, by heavy <span style="color: #ff0000;">javelin-strokes</span>, strives<br/>
to unseat the other. One, or even both, may be placed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ears </span>de combat, often with the addition of a broken<br/>
head or fractured limb.<br/>
<br/>
Various "champions<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>appear and disappear, until<br/>
the pent-up excitement of the onlookers will stand the<br/>
strain no longer, and, each side shouting their family<br/>
battle-cry, the opposed lines of horsemen will charge<br/>
each other and engage in a desperate <span style="color: #ff0000;">mélée </span>in the<br/>
middle. The horses as well as their riders are equally<br/>
madly excited, and the scrimmage often results in<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">207<br/>
