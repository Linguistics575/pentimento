unaddressed, and even the Sheykh himself would not<br/>
sit upon the carpet beside me uninvited.<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>though the bread was more palatable, and among" other<br/>
dishes new to me was "cumis" (or curdled mares'milk), and a rather sour <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>granular cheese made from<br/>
camels'-milk. The etiquette of the table was the same;<br/>
and here also, after making a light meal, the Sheykh<br/>
rose so that his sons, who up to now had served us,<br/>

As night fell a large fire of corn-cobs and scrub<br/>
would be lit in the tent, and all would gather round it<br/>

to a little above freezing-point is trying, and the nights<br/>
often are bitterly cold.<br/>

The question naturally arises, How do these Arabs<br/>
occupy themselves? Shepherds and nomads for generations, their attention is directed principally to the tending<br/>
of their large <span style="color: #0000FF;">flocks </span>of sheep and goats, and the breeding<br/>
of camels and horses. Robbery, with which their name<br/>
is often associated, is usually more or less incidental,<br/>
and not a habit, and from their point of view is to<br/>
some extent justifiable. I noticed on one occasion a<br/>
sheykh's son wearing a lady's green silk dressing-gown,<br/>
and on my asking him where he got it, he rather<br/>
