<span>Riding through the Land of Goshen<br/>
<br/>
laden animal rolled over into the water, some six feet<br/>
below, and were it not for the length of its neck, which<br/>
enabled it to keep its nose above the water, would most<br/>
certainly have been drowned, the canes having stuck in<br/>
the narrow channel and effectually pinned it in its<br/>
uncomfortable position. It was not until its driver<br/>
had jumped into the water and cut the cords which<br/>
secured it to its load that the camel was enabled<br/>
to right itself, and, after many fruitless efforts,<br/>
eventually succeeded in climbing the steep canal-bank,<br/>
rendered all the more slippery by its own dripping<br/>
condition.<br/>

The greetings of the wayfarers also add materially<br/>
to the pleasure of your ride: no travellers can pass each<br/>
other without exchanging courteous greetings, all of<br/>
which have a more or less Biblical flavour <span style="color: #0000FF;">r</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">aharak<br/>

such terms as "Amil <span style="color: #ff0000;">mariif </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">( </span>Do me the favour), or<br/>
"Min <span style="color: #ff0000;">fadlak</span>" (By your courtesy), while the universal<br/>

you are from some given point, and, like the Irishman<br/>
who thinks "his honour "would like a pleasant reply,<br/>
the peasant answers, "Bus firket kaab," which means<br/>
"the turn of a heel only," whereas you will probably<br/>
