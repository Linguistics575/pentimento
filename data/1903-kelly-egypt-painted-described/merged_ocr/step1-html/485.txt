</span>The Desert and the Bedawin<br/>
<br/>
At first the air is still, but hot and lifeless, while<br/>
the sky gradually assumes a dusty appearance, as, low<br/>
down on the horizon, ominous-looking clouds appear<br/>
in the south-west. The sultry air becomes more<br/>
and more stifling, producing a feeling of lassitude and<br/>
depression which is distressing; camels and horses also<br/>
show signs of uneasiness, and the sheep bleat pitifully<br/>
in apprehension.<br/>
<br/>
Presently little puffs of wind, hot as from an oven,<br/>
herald the approaching storm. As the wind gains in<br/>
strength, the air is filled with a dusty fog through<br/>
which the sickly glare of the sun is hardly visible.<br/>
Fine drift-sand blows like snow-wreaths across the<br/>
desert, and the eyes are blinded and the lungs filled<br/>
with the choking dust. As the storm develops, little<br/>
splinters of rock or small pebbles are hurled through<br/>
the air, and cut the skin like knives. The sun is<br/>
totally obscured, and the ever-driving sand gradually<br/>
assumes the appearance of billows, which, splashing<br/>
and breaking upon the rocks like ocean surf, envelops<br/>
everything in camp, and piles tons of drift-sand high<br/>
against the tents and baggage. Then comes the time<br/>
when safety lies in movement. Camp equipage is<br/>
hastily packed upon the terror-stricken animals, and<br/>
the party starts to ride obliquely through the storm,<br/>
in order to cross its path, or find shelter in a mountain<br/>
spur. To remain still is to be covered and entombed,<br/>
while riding is discomfort indescribable.<br/>
