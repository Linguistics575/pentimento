raising her until the spout is reached; refreshed, she<br/>
returns the compliment to her companion, and both<br/>
continue on their way rejoicing.<br/>

In another place a poor man stretches a ragged<br/>
awning of sackcloth upon two sticks inserted between<br/>
the joints of masonry, and beneath its partial shade<br/>
exposes the juicy water-melon or baskets of fruit he<br/>
wishes to sell. What a simple, and yet how rich a<br/>
picture! See the shadow cast by the awning, orange<br/>
within, but blue-edged; how strong a bit of colour it is<br/>
against the dusty wall it traverses, and how the fruit,<br/>
half in sunlight, half in shade, contrasts with the faded<br/>
costume of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">vendor-all </span>the colours of the rainbow<br/>
in six feet square, combined with what a variety of<br/>
texture and effective light and shade! Such pictures<br/>
surround you everywhere, until the mind becomes<br/>
bewildered by the wealth of subject the streets afford.<br/>

The series of streets from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-en-Nasr1 </span>to the<br/>
Citadel forms the main transverse thoroughfare of Cairo,<br/>
and is thoroughly familiar to tourists. Here most of<br/>
the sightseeing is done, and many of the more important mosques are to be found. A splendid view of<br/>
this quarter is to be had from the tower of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">HÃ©tel<br/>
</span>du Nil close by, from the top of which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">domes </span>and<br/>
minarets of all the best-known mosques surround you,<br/>
and hardly any suggestion of modern life is visible.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most effective bits here is the fine <span style="color: #ff0000;">BabZuweyla </span>or "Metwali" gate, so called from its twin<br/>
minarets, which lift themselves high above the massive<br/>
structure of the gate itself. Until a few years <span style="color: #ff0000;">age </span>the<br/>
