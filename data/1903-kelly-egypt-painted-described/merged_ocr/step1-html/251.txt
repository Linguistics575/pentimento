preservation, and gives a very perfect idea of what the<br/>
temple must have been in its original glory, though<br/>
most of the colouration has gone from the columns and<br/>
ceilings. Here, and in the Ramasseum, is a new feature<br/>
in the use of sculptured figures as supporting columns,<br/>
an idea more fully developed in the Greek Caryatides<br/>
at Athens; and it would be interesting to trace the<br/>
influence which in other ways the old Egyptian art must<br/>
have had upon the Greek.<br/>
<br/>
Close to the Ramasseum, prostrate and broken, is<br/>
another of those mighty portrait-statues so frequent<br/>
in Egypt. This one is sixty feet high, and originally<br/>
monolithic. Formed of hard grit-stone, it is finely<br/>
sculptured; and though not always apparent to the<br/>
eye, by passing the hand over the shoulder or knee,<br/>
etc., little subtleties of modelling are detected, and<br/>
show that the artist who made it had some knowledge<br/>
at least of interior anatomy.<br/>
<br/>
Most imposing of all the monuments here, however,<br/>
are the Colossi. Standing alone among the cornfields,<br/>
or surrounded by the Nile at flood-time, they are from<br/>
any point of view, and under any effect of light, the<br/>
embodiment of dignified repose, and form fitting<br/>
monuments to the greatness of their creator.<br/>
<br/>
All these monuments should be separately studied<br/>
by the aid of expert knowledge. Our concern is more<br/>
with their pictorial aspect, though a few characteristic<br/>
features may be noticed in passing. One striking<br/>
peculiarity is the sloping outer walls of the temple<br/>
or pylon, plainly serving the purpose, as it no doubt<br/>
