<span>Cairo<br/>
<br/>
It is a cosmopolitan assembly, where almost every<br/>
European language is spoken, as the following will<br/>
show. Two gentlemen of my acquaintance were<br/>
strolling round the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekiyeh </span>Gardens, and presently<br/>
seated themselves close to some young men engaged<br/>
in conversation. Being old Cairenes, and between<br/>
them acquainted with twelve different languages, they<br/>
were immediately struck by the fact that the youths<br/>
were speaking in a tongue neither of them had ever<br/>
heard before. What it could be they could not<br/>
imagine, and finally, curiosity prevailing, one of them<br/>
accosted the strangers, and in polite French explained<br/>
their perplexity, and begged for enlightenment. "Oh,"<br/>
said one of them in reply, "we are talking Welsh <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>"<br/>
<br/>
Here, then, is one of the difficulties which <span style="color: #0000FF;">immediately </span>confront the Englishman, who is seldom<br/>
a good linguist. For the full enjoyment of Cairo a<br/>
little French and rather more than a smattering of<br/>
Arabic are essential, and the latter, at any rate, is not<br/>
easily acquired. Consequently the tourist is at the<br/>
mercy of his dragoman for any information, and misses<br/>
those snatches of "<span style="color: #ff0000;">chaff </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>and repartee among the natives<br/>
which often add so much to the day's amusement.<br/>
With commendable energy travellers frequently, and<br/>
after much labour, learn a few Arabic phrases, usually<br/>
questions, forgetting that they cannot possibly <span style="color: #0000FF;">understand </span>the replies. Let me recommend them to confine<br/>
their earlier efforts to the acquisition of such sentences<br/>
only as give absolute instructions to servants, drivers,<br/>
etc., and to which no response is required.<br/>
