with food as to be perpetually in a comatose condition.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, there is a proverb which says, "God blesses<br/>
the house the birds build in," and I have frequently<br/>
noticed swallows' nests built in the most inconvenient<br/>
positions in their living-rooms. As an instance of the<br/>
respect a native will pay to such a superstition, I may<br/>
mention a case which affected me personally. My<br/>
servant had been in the habit of making my early<br/>
coffee in a silver jug, and one morning its place was<br/>
taken by a commoner vessel. Asking the reason, my<br/>
boy informed me that during the night a' pair of birds<br/>
had commenced to build <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>it, and it could not therefore<br/>
be disturbed. The idea was so pretty that I felt forced<br/>
to accept the position.<br/>

Riding through the country districts is most <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting</span>, and the incidents met with on the road are<br/>
frequently amusing. Here comes a donkey so heavily<br/>
laden with <span style="color: #ff0000;">bercime </span>that little is to be seen of it but<br/>
nose and hoofs. Sitting on the piled-up green-stuff is<br/>
a man with his little boy on his lap. Quite unable to<br/>
see, the donkey accidentally bumps his outstretching<br/>
load against a palm trunk, and the next instant the<br/>
positions are reversed, the donkey's heels in the air and<br/>
the man and child struggling from beneath the beast<br/>
and its inverted load. Another time I saw a camel,<br/>
heavily laden with sugar-cane, attempting <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>cross the<br/>
rough bridge of palm trunks which spanned a deep but<br/>
narrow canal. Slipping on the insecure footing, the<br/>
