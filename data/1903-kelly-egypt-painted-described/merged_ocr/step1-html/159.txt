<span>The Environments of Cairo<br/>
<br/>
ment; and no matter with what delight the earlier years<br/>
of bazaar work in Cairo may have been passed, the artist<br/>
is inevitably drawn to the more ethereal beauty of the<br/>
larger fields of work without<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>In the immediate neighbourhood of Cairo is an<br/>
inexhaustible field of work for the artist, embracing<br/>
almost every variety of subjects.<br/>
<br/>
Pass over the bridge by the railway station and you<br/>
almost immediately enter the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shribra </span>Avenue, the oldest<br/>
and most imposing of all those with which Cairo is beautified, and reminiscent of the great Mohammed Ali and the<br/>
tragic reign of Ismail. In the early years of my residence it was the fashionable drive of Cairo. Every<br/>
Friday and Sunday it was thronged by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elite </span>of<br/>
Cairo, and for a mile or more was brilliant with military<br/>
uniforms, the gay costume of the "sais" or consular<br/>
"cavass," as the mixed throng of diplomat and tourist,<br/>
native and European, rich and poor, waited to exchange<br/>
salutations with the ever-courteous Tewfik Pasha, the<br/>
late Khedive.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shribra </span>is deserted now, and nothing in Cairo has<br/>
ever taken the place of the bi-weekly parade in which<br/>
ceremony and spontaneity were curiously intermingled.<br/>
The city has spread westward, and people take the air<br/>
in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>Drive in solitary exclusiveness.<br/>
<br/>
Though without its weekly pageant, the old avenue<br/>
has other attractions. The gnarled trunks of sycamore<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">lebbek </span>which form the avenue have all the<br/>
irregular beauty of age upon them. The long vista<br/>
is peopled by country-folk driving into market their<br/>
