<span>The Desert and the Bedawin<br/>
<br/>
the sand, falling in upon it, covers it. Then a more<br/>
remarkable feat is performed; for in sand too loose to<br/>
retain a footprint the "scarab" succeeds in forming a<br/>
tunnel from the open air to his hidden treasure below.<br/>
How it is done is a mystery, for no artificial aid is<br/>
employed, and simply with head and shoulders as before,<br/>
the passage is cleared, and the sand above remains to<br/>
crown the arch.<br/>
<br/>
Butterflies and other <span style="color: #ff0000;">gaily-Winged </span>insects furnish<br/>
food for lark or <span style="color: #0000FF;">starling</span>, who in turn provide a dinner<br/>
for the hawk.<br/>
<br/>
The surface sand is largely strewn with coloured<br/>
pebbles, among which are agate, onyx, <span style="color: #ff0000;">cornelian</span>, and<br/>
flint, while fossil shell-fish and other petrifactions prove<br/>
it once an <span style="color: #0000FF;">ocean-bed</span>. More recent floods have brought<br/>
their contribution of porphyry or gritstone; volcanic<br/>
clinker and conglomerate adding still another to the<br/>
many pages of its history.<br/>
<br/>
Such in part is the physical desert, which for the<br/>
geologist, botanist, or student of its fauna has many<br/>
fascinations. But to the artist what ?--) limitless<br/>
expanse of variegated sand, alternately <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>or undulating, which stretches, in subtle modifications of its tints,<br/>
to distances hardly to be determined; the little <span style="color: #0000FF;">flecks<br/>
</span>of cloud, and the low hills, rosy or delicately purple in<br/>
the sun-swathed air, which from time to time peep<br/>
above the horizon, only serve to lead the imagination<br/>
to the immensity of its waste beyond.<br/>
<br/>
Out-jutting rock or lying boulder, ruddy and sunburnt, cast their blue shadows on the sand, whose<br/>
