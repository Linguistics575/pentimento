To the right of the line thousands of pelican, heron,<br/>
wild duck, and ibis enliven the mud-flats and shallows<br/>
which form the eastern end of Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menzala</span>; on the<br/>
other, looking towards Sinai, you will see an almost<br/>
constant recurrence of mirage, its semblance of water<br/>
reflecting little islets being, most perfect, and it is difficult for the new-comer to realise that this is illusion<br/>
and not fact.<br/>
<br/>
The real interest of the journey begins, however,<br/>
when, on leaving Ismailia, the line turns westward<br/>
across the desert. Here is something new, and to the<br/>
appreciative mind how vast and suggestive the desert's<br/>

And yet how exhilarating is this first introduction<br/>
to virgin desert! The air is fresh and sparkling as the<br/>
sea-breeze brings with it woolly clumps of fresh-tinted<br/>
clouds, whose velvety shadows chase each other across<br/>
the desert's undulations. The fawn-coloured sand shines<br/>
against the relatively dark sky beyond; patches of glittering salt and coloured pebbles give variety to both tint<br/>
and texture; the dry water-courses are fringed by the<br/>
grey-green "mit minan" bush and <span style="color: #ff0000;">brighter-hued<br/>
</span>hyssop, while tufts of growth of various kinds scattered<br/>
over its surface give a chromatic scale to distances<br/>
which seem immeasurable. Here and there a sharper<br/>
note of colour is struck by some wandering Arab<br/>
silhouetted against the sky, or a shepherd leading his<br/>
multi-coloured flock in search of such scant pasturage<br/>
as the desert affords. This district is called the Wady<br/>
Tumilat, or "valley of the hills," and has a varied<br/>
