THE NILE<br/>
<br/>
No other river, probably, presents so many curious<br/>
features, or is environed with so much romantic suggestion, as this remarkable stream, which, rising in Lake<br/>
Victoria Nyanza, in the course of its 3000 miles<br/>
traverses half the length of Africa. Tributaries from<br/>
the Bahr-el-Ghazal on the west, and the river Sobat<br/>
rising in the mountains south of Abyssinia, combine to<br/>
form the even-flowing main stream called the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bahr-el-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abiad</span>" or White Nile. So far practically unnavigable, it is only upon its junction at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartiim </span>with the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Bahr-el-Azrak," or Blue Nile, that the river becomes<br/>
that great waterway which from the earliest times has<br/>
been a busy highway for the commerce of the world.<br/>

little of the source of the majestic stream which,<br/>
appearing from out of a dim unknown, flowed uninterruptedly and without tributaries through the land,<br/>
and by its periodic and regular inundations brought<br/>
fertility and wealth to the whole country.<br/>
<br/>
It is easy to understand the veneration with<br/>
which the Nile was regarded by the ancients. To<br/>
