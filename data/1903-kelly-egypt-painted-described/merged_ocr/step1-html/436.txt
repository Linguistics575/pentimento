<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Here let me mention that though the title of sheyk<br/>
is generally a birthright, it does not of necessity <span style="color: #0000FF;">imu<br/>
</span>authority. Each village has its <span style="color: #ff0000;">omdeh </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">sheykh<br/>
</span>pointed by the Government; sometimes the heredit<br/>
sheykh may fill the position, but often the appoint<br/>
is specially made and the title only enjoyed so long<br/>
the holder is continued in the office. He is <span style="color: #0000FF;">respond<br/>
</span>for the good behaviour of his people as well as t<br/>
collection of local taxes, and exercises a general con<br/>
over the affairs of his village. The office carries wi<br/>
it a small remuneration, while the honour is <span style="color: #ff0000;">gre<br/>
</span>appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking generally, the fellahin live very <span style="color: #0000FF;">amica<br/>
</span>together, and, so far as my observation goes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">quar<br/>
</span>are infrequent. Their relations would seem <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>governed by a patriarchal feeling of kinship, and po<br/>
exists amid their toil in the beautiful idioms of th<br/>
language and <span style="color: #ff0000;">salutations</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Strangers passing in the road salute each ot<br/>
graciously and gracefully, while friends in <span style="color: #ff0000;">meeti<br/>
</span>exhaust a vocabulary of compliment before the dir<br/>
question as to health or happiness is asked or <span style="color: #0000FF;">answer<br/>
</span>What could be more poetic than their "Good-by<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">says </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l<br/>
<br/>
</span>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shiif </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">wishuk </span>b'il khare in-sh'llah" (Until by<br/>
will of God I see your face in health)?<br/>
<br/>
Or the greeting between reunited friends<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Ana <span style="color: #ff0000;">huashtini </span>ya <span style="color: #ff0000;">akhuya </span>"( I have longed for <span style="color: #0000FF;">y<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>my brother)?<br/>
<br/>
The "<span style="color: #0000FF;">salaam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>itself is full of meaning. <span style="color: #ff0000;">First<br/>
