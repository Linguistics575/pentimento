<span>Condition of the People<br/>
<br/>
partly due to insanitary conditions of life, but mainly<br/>
to the lamentable carelessness and ignorance of the<br/>
mothers. Infants would seem to enjoy none of that<br/>
care and attention at birth usual among other races,<br/>
and none but the most robust stand much chance of<br/>
surviving the early days of their existence. I have<br/>
personally met with one case, and believe it is not at all<br/>
infrequent, where the child has been born as its mother<br/>
was working in the fields, and, simply wrapped in a<br/>
handkerchief, has been placed under the shade of some<br/>
bush while the mother continued her work. Presently<br/>
the woman returned to find the sun beating upon the<br/>
baby, already dead from exposure and neglect. "This<br/>
is the will of God," she will say; and, though doubtless grieved for the loss of her little one, she is all<br/>
unconscious of culpable neglect on her own part!<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, I cannot help feeling that the solution of the<br/>
whole question lies in the education of the women, whose<br/>
position in Egypt is at present most unsatisfactory.<br/>

them on an altogether lower level, fatal to their <span style="color: #ff0000;">selfrespect</span>, and militating against their proper influence<br/>
over their children, which we value so highly.<br/>
<br/>
Their legal position as wives also is most insecure.<br/>
Divorce may be pronounced by the husband arbitrarily<br/>
and without appeal; and though the wife has no claim<br/>
upon her lord, he can at any time command her return.<br/>
A treble divorce, however, pronounced at different<br/>
periods, or by the words, "Thou art trebly divorced,"<br/>
spoken before witnesses, frees the woman entirely, and it<br/>
