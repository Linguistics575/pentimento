cushions scattered about them for reclining. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>corner is a "<span style="color: #ff0000;">zeer</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>or large water-pot, and beside it a<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">cubiyeh</span>" or drinking-cup of brass or copper. In<br/>
the sand is half buried a large earthen bowl, used as a<br/>
hearth, while perhaps a few quaintly wrought lamps<br/>
complete the list of furniture.<br/>
<br/>
The Bedawin themselves are striking in appearance,<br/>
tall, and commanding in their carriage, and having the<br/>
keen eye and aquiline nose of the Semite. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frequently<br/>

born of traditions and habits of freedom. Serious<br/>
in manner, they have none of that noisiness which<br/>

visit: "I like this man, he does not make a noise or<br/>
laugh<span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span>"<br/>
<br/>
Domestic in their habits, everything about them has<br/>
personal associations. The tent-cloths are spun, woven,<br/>
and dyed by their women and children, as also are their<br/>
saddle-cloths and trappings, and are in consequence so<br/>
much prized that no money will buy the simplest<br/>
product of their wives' industry, though frequently<br/>
they may be given as a token of regard. Generally<br/>
married to one wife, she is helpmeet and companion to<br/>
her lord, and with her children is treated with devotion<br/>
and respect; and I believe that the Arab word "watan <span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>is the only equivalent in any language for the English<br/>
word "home."<br/>
