which they are frequently attached. The upper story<br/>
is invariably a school, to which some small <span style="color: #0000FF;">endowment </span>attaches, sufficient at any rate to remunerate the<br/>
"malim" for his labours. Here the youth of the<br/>
district were wont to receive their education, which<br/>
consisted almost entirely of a committal to memory of<br/>
selected passages from the Koran.<br/>
<br/>
Bequests such as the foregoing were usually vested<br/>
in the Cadi or Mufti, who was often called upon to<br/>
administer estates left for purposes of a most eccentric<br/>
character. As an instance, I may mention the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beyt-elMufti</span>, which, with its beautiful garden, adjoins the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">H6tel </span>du Nil in the heart of Cairo. In this case the<br/>
testator (so I understand) bequeathed a considerable<br/>
fortune for the foundation of a home for the stray cats<br/>
of Cairo. The Mufti, wise in his generation, began to<br/>
build a house of the most ornate description, richly<br/>
embellished with arabesques, and surrounded by an<br/>
extensive garden, in its time probably one of the most<br/>
beautiful in the city. "Meanwhile, some mysterious<br/>
agency was evidently at work, for, on completion of<br/>
the building, the Mufti was able to declare that, as<br/>
there were no homeless cats left in Cairo, the testament<br/>
was void, and promptly entered into occupation <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>To-day the house is in a ruinous condition, and<br/>
occupied by people of the lowest origin.<br/>
<br/>
In those days the powers vested in the Mufti and<br/>
Cadi were great, and the administration of the law as<br/>
interpreted by them often furnished incidents of the most<br/>
amusing description. In wandering round the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Helmieh<br/>
