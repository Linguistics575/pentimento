<span>Riding through the Land of Goshen<br/>
<br/>
Guided by the servants, who carried lamps, we had to<br/>
stumble over a rough bridle-path for a mile or more to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheykh</span>'s house, prettily situated on a canal-bank,<br/>
and surrounded by palm-trees and fruit-gardens.<br/>
<br/>
Sheykh Mohammed met us at the gate of his compound, and, kissing us on both cheeks, made us welcome,<br/>
saying that he was honoured by the presence of Englishmen in his house. The gate opened into a square<br/>
courtyard; on the left, a divan and other offices, while<br/>
on the right were the kitchens and the servants' quarters.<br/>
In the centre was a well, and beyond, the guest-chamber<br/>
opened by arches into the compound.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the divan, coffee and cigarettes were<br/>
served while dinner was being prepared. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheykh's<br/>
</span>brother and other guests soon arrived, and, exchanging<br/>
the usual greetings, we sat down <span style="color: #ff0000;">crossllegged </span>upon the<br/>
couches awaiting the advent of dinner. Presently the<br/>
servant informed our host that the dinner was ready,<br/>
and, asking us if we were agreeable, the Sheykh led the<br/>
way into the guest-room. This was a long narrow<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">room</span>, some thirty feet by fifteen, one side of which was<br/>
practically opened to the night air. The walls and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">floor </span>were of sun-dried mud, a raised "<span style="color: #ff0000;">delcka</span>" (or<br/>
bench) of the same material running round the three<br/>
sides of the room; carpets and cushions were spread<br/>
upon the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">delcka</span>," and matting covered a portion<br/>
of the sanded <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor</span>. The roof was thatched with<br/>
"doura" <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>stalks, from the beam hung two or three<br/>
lanterns, and in a niche in the wall stood the drinking<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>Indian <span style="color: #0000FF;">corn</span>.<br/>
