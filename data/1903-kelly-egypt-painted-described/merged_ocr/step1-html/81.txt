<br/>
to Cairo by train, H Effendi elected to .walk.<br/>
Mistaking his way in the dark, he found himself<br/>
among the rocks which formed the habitation of the<br/>
expelled pariahs. An immediate attack was the result,<br/>
and the unfortunate gentleman was obliged to scramble<br/>
up the rocks and keep his enemies at bay by rolling<br/>
stones and <span style="color: #ff0000;">d√©bris </span>upon them; with each check he made<br/>
his way to the next ridge, where he would again be<br/>
attacked and forced to adopt the same plan of defence.<br/>
<br/>
In this way the night was passed, until about three<br/>
in the morning he found himself, bootless, torn, and<br/>
half unconscious, upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tiira </span>line some miles on<br/>
the other side of Cairo. Presently the first early<br/>
morning <span style="color: #ff0000;">quarry- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">train </span>appeared, taking stone to<br/>
Abbasiyeh, and H Effendi called upon the driver<br/>
for assistance. The driver, however, startled and<br/>
alarmed, exclaimed, "You must be either a devil or<br/>
a murderer to be here at this time," and with the<br/>
assistance of the stoker bound him hand and foot,<br/>
and threw him among the coals in the tender. On<br/>
reaching Abbasiyeh he was locked up in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lamproom </span>to await the arrival of the station-master, upon<br/>
whose appearance the zealous <span style="color: #ff0000;">railivay-men </span>recounted<br/>
the adventure, and, throwing open the door, brought<br/>
out the supposed malefactor. Their discomfiture may<br/>
be imagined when, recognising in him a high Government official, the station-master with obsequious<br/>
"salaams" hastened to offer his apologies, and commiserated with "his excellency" upon the indignity<br/>
and discomfort he had suffered.<br/>
