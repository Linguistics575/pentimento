<span>Cairo<br/>
<br/>
As buildings increased in size and architectural<br/>
embellishment, these lattices gradually became enlarged<br/>
and decorated, first by the notching of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">laths</span>, but<br/>
eventually developed into the roomy balconies of fine<br/>
trellis-work which are such a feature of Cairo street<br/>
architecture, and from behind which the ladies of the<br/>
harim could, unobserved, enjoy the air and see all that<br/>
occurred in the street below them. Most of these<br/>
windows have still the little projecting niche which<br/>
forms the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mashrubiyeh </span>proper.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, this work lends itself so readily to<br/>
the making of screens and ornamental furniture, that<br/>
the demands of dealers and tourists have practically<br/>
stripped Cairo of one of its most characteristic<br/>
features, and, owing to danger of spreading fire, the<br/>
Government will no longer allow it to be reinserted.<br/>
Many streets, such as Sharia <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gamamis</span>, Bab-el-Wazir,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siigarieh</span>, which were a few years ago the<br/>
richest in Cairo, have now practically no example<br/>
left of this interesting and beautiful work, and year<br/>
after year witnesses the slow but certain disappearance<br/>
of other equally characteristic features.<br/>
<br/>
Modern necessity must inevitably clash with<br/>
mediaeval quaintness, and to-day the historic streets<br/>
of the early Moslems resound to the clanging bells<br/>
of electric cars. The picturesque Bab-esh-Sharieh,<br/>
one of the eastern gates of Cairo, has been demolished<br/>
to allow of road improvements; and many streets, such<br/>
as the Muski, have during the last few years lost<br/>
much of their Eastern character.<br/>
