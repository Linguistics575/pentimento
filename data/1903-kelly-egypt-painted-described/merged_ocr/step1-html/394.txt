<br/>
in the fields some distance from the town, fruit or<br/>
sweetmeats would be brought to me, the good-natured<br/>
"fellah" squatting before me, delighted with my<br/>
evident relish of the refreshment. So the days passed,<br/>
and when sundown closed my day's work I would be<br/>
assisted to the Rest House, where, solemnly shaking<br/>
hands with my friends and wishing each other "good<br/>
night," we part till to-morrow, when the whole performance is repeated.<br/>
<br/>
There is something touching in the simple kindness<br/>
of these people. Their hospitality and kindly offices<br/>
are rendered as a matter of course, for which the only<br/>
reward expected is that you will condescend to accept<br/>
the tribute of respect they offer. Such was my life<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fakiis</span>, each day's busy enjoyment being graced by<br/>
some little act of civility which made work easy,<br/>
and which has left with me a very pleasing recollection<br/>
of the good folk of the village.<br/>
<br/>
Here also I had the good fortune to make the<br/>
friendship of M' <span style="color: #ff0000;">Collough </span>Bey, then engaged upon a<br/>
land survey, to whose companionship through many<br/>
long and sometimes trying rides I owe so much of my<br/>
pleasure on these journeys, while his perfect knowledge<br/>
of the language and customs of the people has greatly<br/>
added to the information several years of wandering in<br/>
these districts has brought me.<br/>
<br/>
The morning arrived when <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>was to leave <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fakas</span>,<br/>
and with it a fresh proof of the Sheykh's kindness, in<br/>
the form of a handsome donkey intended specially to<br/>
carry my baggage. It is one of those silvery mornings<br/>
