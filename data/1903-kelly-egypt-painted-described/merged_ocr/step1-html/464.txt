<br/>
</span>colour gains in delicacy by contrast with the greens and<br/>
greys of its vegetable growth.<br/>
<br/>
There is an opalescent sparkle and clear transparency<br/>
of light about it all which is most subtly beautiful, a<br/>
poetic setting for the romantic life of the Bedawin who<br/>
inhabit it.<br/>
<br/>
My first introduction to the Bedawin was accidental,<br/>
but fortunately under pleasant conditions, which led to<br/>
my being invited by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sheykh </span>to pay a visit to his<br/>
camp; and I soon afterwards found myself the guest of<br/>
the Sheykh Alewa and Saoud-el-Tahawi, chiefs of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hanaardi </span>Arabs, then camped in the desert of Suez.<br/>
<br/>
Under the escort of a party of horsemen of the<br/>
tribe, camp was reached at sunset, and a final mad<br/>
gallop brought us to the Sheykh's tent, where he and his<br/>
sons were awaiting us. Assisting us to dismount, and<br/>
kissing my hand, the Sheykh bade me welcome, and,<br/>
conducting me to my tent, added, "This house is yours;<br/>
do what you will with it, and with us your servants."<br/>
A Biblical greeting, the effect of which was heightened<br/>
as water was brought, and face, hands, and feet washed<br/>
before I was left to rest upon the cushions in the tent,<br/>
or the Sheykh retired to superintend the preparation of<br/>
the evening meal.<br/>
<br/>
As I rested, one by one the headmen of the tribe<br/>
called to pay their respects. Taking off their shoes<br/>
at the entrance, they advanced in turns with many<br/>
"salaams," each as he kissed my hand uttering the<br/>
single word "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahubbah</span>" (Welcome); then, seating<br/>
themselves in a long row on the opposite side of the<br/>
<br/>
zoo<br/>
