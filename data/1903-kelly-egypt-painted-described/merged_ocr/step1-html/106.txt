last stage of the minarets was wanting, but these have<br/>
recently been restored by the department created for<br/>
the preservation of Arabic monuments. This department has already done a great amount of excellent<br/>
restoration as well as preservation<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>and without doubt<br/>
has secured the continued existence of many buildings<br/>
of great historic interest, which would otherwise most<br/>
certainly have perished. While fully appreciating the<br/>
good work already done, I would venture a criticism<br/>
upon the restoration of the minarets of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bab-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Zuweyla </span>and the mosque of the Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barkiik</span>. In<br/>
each case the department has rebuilt the final stage in<br/>
the delicate form of cupola supported by pillars, which,<br/>
though a common feature enough, is hardly in keeping<br/>
with the rest of the structure in these instances; and to<br/>
the best of my belief these stages were originally of<br/>
solid walling, embellished with exterior carvings and<br/>
slightly relieved pilasters. Passing through the gate,<br/>
you come to the flag or tent-makers' bazaar, cool and<br/>
shady beneath its wooden roof; and beyond are streets<br/>
of varying interest which eventually lead into the very<br/>
prosaic Sharia Mohammed Ali.<br/>
<br/>
Behind and around these principal bazaar streets are<br/>
quarters little known, but rich in monuments <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofdomestic<br/>
</span>architecture and decoration. Here palaces of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memliik </span>days, at present in the occupation of the lowest<br/>
classes, watch mournfully over narrow lanes now practically deserted. Life here is subdued as compared with<br/>
the trading centres, but the scene retains some <span style="color: #0000FF;">flavour<br/>
</span>of its bygone magnificence. Handsome doorways<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
