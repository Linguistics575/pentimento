<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
the "personally conducted" tourist of to-day, have<br/>
come under the spell of its influence. Its historical<br/>
interest is apparent to all, and the archaeological fascination which holds the "digger" is easily understood;<br/>
but to the generality of visitors on pleasure bent these<br/>
factors do not appeal, yet each year sees ever-increasing thousands flocking to the Nile Valley, some to<br/>
make their first enthusiastic excursions, others to renew<br/>
acquaintance with scenes already familiar.<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, all, whatever their temperaments<br/>
or mental endowments may be, are alike charmed,<br/>
though appealed to in different ways.<br/>
<br/>
Putting aside all questions of scientific research,<br/>
with which indeed I am not competent to deal, it is<br/>
not easy to determine wherein lies the power of attraction which Egypt undoubtedly possesses. Analyse the<br/>
country and you find little of inherent beauty to greatly<br/>
distinguish it from others. Its life is picturesque and<br/>
its relics are of absorbing interest, but other countries<br/>
can provide richer and more varied scenes, and yet do<br/>
not compare with Egypt in world-wide popularity. A<br/>
narrow strip of alluvial mud closely hemmed in by<br/>
high deserts constitutes the land, through which,<br/>
placidly and uneventfully, flows a chocolate-coloured<br/>
stream. On a grey day how dull and depressing it all<br/>
is! but glorified by its wonderful sunlight Egypt<br/>
sparkles with colour, while the very opacity of the<br/>
muddy river serves more perfectly to repeat the<br/>
coloured beauty it reflects.<br/>
