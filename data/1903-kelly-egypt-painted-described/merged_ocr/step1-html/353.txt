<span>Canal Life in the Delta<br/>
<br/>
each of which adds its quota of contamination to the<br/>
stream.<br/>
<br/>
It may be imagined that by the time <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menzala </span>is<br/>
reached, the water of the canal is anything but savoury;<br/>
yet the people have their houses and mosques built<br/>
into the water, and discharge their drainage into the<br/>
stream, the drains being frequently close beside the<br/>
steps from where the <span style="color: #ff0000;">townswomen </span>draw their domestic<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">supply</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
<br/>
</span>When last there the streets of the town had an<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unwanted </span>look of cleanliness, a general cleaning-up<br/>
having been ordered by the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Omdeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>in anticipation<br/>
of a Government inspection. The accumulated garbage<br/>
of the streets was, however, calmly and deliberately<br/>
swept into the canal, their only source of water-supply!<br/>
On being remonstrated with, and the fact pointed out<br/>
that such pollution of their water must inevitably result<br/>
in disease, the only response vouchsafed by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Omdeh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--<br/>
</span>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mialaishe </span>ya Bey di min Rubbani," which means,<br/>
"It is not our fault, O Bey, our Lord sends it."<br/>
<br/>
Being market-day, we thought we would stroll round<br/>
and see the scene, always one of the most picturesque<br/>
incidents of native life.<br/>
<br/>
The market-place itself was simply the widening<br/>
out of the principal street into an irregular sort of<br/>
square, now thronged with people from the neighbouring district; but in addition to being the market-place<br/>
it was also the cemetery of the town, where the tombs<br/>
of their departed friends served the market-people as<br/>
