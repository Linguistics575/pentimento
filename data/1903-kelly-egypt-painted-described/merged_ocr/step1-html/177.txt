<span>The Environments of Cairo<br/>
<br/>
kinds abounds, and as a contrast to the arable land<br/>
of Egypt it produces a great many <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowering </span>plants.<br/>
From the plain, numerous "wadys" or valleys bore<br/>
into the heart of the hills, wild to a degree, and as<br/>
worthy of the geologist's attention as that of the<br/>
artist. One of these, a tremendous earthquake rift,<br/>
ends in an abrupt wall of rock, below which is the<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ein-el-Mia</span>," or Moses' Well, a favourite luncheon<br/>
rendezvous. Weird and rugged to a degree, this valley<br/>
always recalls to my mind the hymn:<br/>
<br/>
. all through the mountains, <span style="color: #0000FF;">thunder-riven</span>,<br/>
<br/>
And up from the rocky steep,<br/>
<br/>
There rose a cry to the gate of heaven,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rejoice</span>, I have found My <span style="color: #0000FF;">sheep</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>,<br/>
<br/>
No setting for the parable could be finer or more<br/>
suggestive.<br/>
<br/>
All this rock is a solid mass of fossils, usually<br/>
bivalves and sea-worms, though amongst others I have<br/>
found a very perfect crab of large size.<br/>
<br/>
From the top of the Mokattam Hills are several<br/>
most impressive views, particularly from the little<br/>
mosque of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sheykh-el-Gaiichy </span>behind the Citadel.<br/>
This mosque is of a very ancient date, and forms the<br/>
burial-place of the old saint whose name it bears. A<br/>
lonely resting-place, which my servant explains thus.<br/>
The old Sheykh had three young and beautiful wives,<br/>
and on his death-bed he ordered his tomb to be built<br/>
on the top of the hill in order that he might from<br/>
thence be able to overlook the whole city, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">see<br/>
</span>that his widows got into no mischief<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
