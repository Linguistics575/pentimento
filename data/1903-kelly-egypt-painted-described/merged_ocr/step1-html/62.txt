him with "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Maalaish </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">( </span>It does not matter). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fervently<br/>
</span>blessing me, he cried, "Another would have beaten me,<br/>
but you are a good man and have mercy"; and then,<br/>
going down the street, he called upon all to "praise<br/>
Allah that here was a righteous man who has pity<br/>
upon the afflicted<span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>This was many years ago, but<br/>
I am still remembered in that street, and am spoken<br/>
of as "ragul tamam," or <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>an upright man."<br/>
<br/>
Other grades of water-carriers are the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">khamali</span>,"<br/>
who, carrying his earthen jar upon his back, very<br/>
dexterously pours the filtered water over his shoulder<br/>
into the little brass cups he carries; then the "sussi,"<br/>
whose terra-cotta pot contains liquorice-water, or a drink<br/>
made from prune-juice; and lastly the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">sherbutli</span>," or<br/>
seller of lemonade and sherbet. The latter'is really a<br/>
fine picturesque figure, partially enveloped in a bright<br/>
red apron and carrying in a sling a huge glass bottle, the<br/>
spout <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">silvered </span>copper being surmounted by a "<span style="color: #0000FF;">cradle</span>"<br/>
containing a large piece of ice. The greenish lemonade,<br/>
in which <span style="color: #0000FF;">float </span>half lemons, seen through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lightcoloured </span>glass looks very refreshing; and, with the eye<br/>
of an artist, it is his custom to have his drinking-bowls<br/>
of china coloured with bright blue.<br/>
<br/>
Here then are the grades of water-carriers, and it<br/>
would be as well to distinguish between them, if you<br/>
would avoid the mistake of an old gentleman who,<br/>
hot and tired with "bazaaring," called a "sussi" and<br/>
made him understand by signs that he wanted the<br/>
contents <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofhisrjar </span>poured over his head. After some<br/>
hesitation the "sussi" did so, deluging him with the<br/>
