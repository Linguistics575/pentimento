<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me, however, that the position is not<br/>
without its dangers. Of late years <span style="color: #0000FF;">irrigation </span>has been<br/>
largely developed, and, in addition to reclaiming land<br/>
that was formerly waste, has added considerably to the<br/>
value of that already under cultivation. The small<br/>
investor, hitherto perhaps simply a farm-labourer,<br/>
will naturally, when possible, buy the relatively cheap<br/>
new lands, which offer to him the greatest promise of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">return</span>, and thus withdraw a certain amount of labour<br/>
from land on which more regular and continuous<br/>
irrigation renders increased rather than diminished<br/>
labour necessary. As I have said before, the native<br/>
is the best farmer for Egypt, and, so far, his place as<br/>
an agriculturalist has never been satisfactorily filled by<br/>
another.<br/>
<br/>
The completion of the New Nile Dams at Assuan,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Assifit</span>, etc., must soon bring this question prominently<br/>
forward; and, so far <span style="color: #ff0000;">asI </span>can see, it resolves itself into a<br/>
question of <span style="color: #0000FF;">population</span>. Increased acreage and fertility<br/>
will shortly overtake the supply of available labour, a<br/>
shortage which the normal increase in population is<br/>
totally inadequate to supply; and though no doubt the<br/>
prosperous condition of the country will induce a large<br/>
number of immigrants to settle, this will hardly of itself<br/>
solve the problem.<br/>
<br/>
The yearly increase in purely native population is<br/>
infinitesimal, due in large measure to the excessive rate<br/>
of infant mortality, which I am told reaches the appalling figure of 90 per cent!<br/>
<br/>
This extraordinary scale of mortality is no doubt<br/>
