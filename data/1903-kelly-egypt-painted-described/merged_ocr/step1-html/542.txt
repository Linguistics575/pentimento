<span>Egypt<br/>
is only by first marrying some one else that she and<br/>
her original spouse can make up their quarrel and renew<br/>
conjugal relations! As a matter of fact, a woman on<br/>
her marriage becomes little else than a "chattel," to be<br/>
enjoyed or removed at will, and whose duties consist<br/>
solely in ministering to the wants of her husband or<br/>
attending to his children. One cannot therefore hope<br/>
for much improvement in a race whose mothers, usually<br/>
married far too young, are raised but little above the<br/>
beasts, and possess neither the ability nor the inclination<br/>
to properly train their offspring.<br/>
<br/>
Under all the circumstances it is not surprising that<br/>
the Egyptian girl does not invariably regard marriage<br/>
as the most-to-be-desired aim in life. Some years ago,<br/>
an old servant asked for leave of absence so that he<br/>
might return to his village in order to marry his<br/>
daughter to a neighbouring farmer. All the settlements<br/>
were satisfactory, and old Ali was well satisfied with his<br/>
daughter's prospects in life. Two days later he surprised<br/>
me by returning to his duties, saying that his daughter<br/>
was ill and the marriage postponed. It transpired<br/>
afterwards that the girl, dreading the slavery of a<br/>
married life, had poisoned herself rather than endure<br/>
what she regarded as an unhappy fate!<br/>
<br/>
It must not be supposed that these marriages are not<br/>
often happy ones: no doubt they are. But whatever<br/>
their result may be, there is no question as to their<br/>
picturesqueness, and particularly in country places, where<br/>
simplicity only serves to add to their interest. The<br/>
attendant festivities last from three to ten days, <span style="color: #0000FF;">accord<br/>
