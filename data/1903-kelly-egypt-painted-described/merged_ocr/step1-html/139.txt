<span>Mosques and Public Buildings<br/>
<br/>
In their tilework, tesselated pavements, the highly<br/>
ornate "mihrab," and indeed in every detail of their<br/>
decoration, the mosques of Cairo furnish a wide field for<br/>
study; but perhaps enough has been said to convince the<br/>
casual visitor that they have an interest quite apart from<br/>
being simply the places of worship of the "faithful."<br/>
<br/>
Two other features I should like to mention before<br/>
leaving this subject. In the Mosque of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalarin </span>is a<br/>
very effective use of woodwork, both in the painted<br/>
and inscribed frieze course which runs entirely round<br/>
the interior, and also in the open <span style="color: #ff0000;">trellis-work </span>which<br/>
surrounds the tomb and forms the grill between the<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">sebeel</span>" and mosque proper; and I have noticed in<br/>
many places where an archway is formed by keyed stonework, each stone is ornamented separately, so that<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>the<br/>
structure is not disguised, as is so often the case with<br/>
us, where joints are hidden and perhaps a floral relief<br/>
made to appear as the support of the superstructure.<br/>
<br/>
It always seems to me that these mosques are characterised by great dignity of proportion, accurate spacing,<br/>
and a very discriminating use of ornament. The first<br/>
aim would seem to be to satisfy structural demands,<br/>
and, when these principles were fulfilled, ornament was<br/>
laid on lavishly, but in the right place, and was never<br/>
permitted to disguise building requirements, or to<br/>
interfere with the effect of the building as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
Many superstitions attach to these <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosques-VAS</span>,<br/>
for instance, with its twin pillars, between which none<br/>
but the elect are supposed to be able to pass, while<br/>
several are associated with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalaiin</span>. Here the particularly<br/>
