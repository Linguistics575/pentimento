<span>Canal Life in the Delta<br/>
<br/>
wind was blowing, sailing was out of the question, our<br/>
journey being from east to west, and we had therefore<br/>
to be towed by the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">guffrah </span>"1 of each village in turn.<br/>
Starting from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menzala </span>with a good team, we travelled<br/>
well, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rais-el-guffrah </span>"meanwhile going on ahead to<br/>
warn the next village to be ready. It was very pleasant,<br/>
sitting on our cabin roof under a genial sun watching the<br/>
woody bank glide by, the quietude of the scene being<br/>
periodically broken by the incidents of village or agricultural life. Where nothing of human interest was to<br/>
be seen, the flitting and splashing of hundreds of kingfishers supplied its place. This is a remarkable feature<br/>
of the canal, for though every waterway in Egypt abounds<br/>
in kingfishers, nowhere else have I seen them in such<br/>
numbers as here. Out of <span style="color: #0000FF;">curiosity </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>counted their nests<br/>
in one reach of not more than two hundred yards,<br/>
and found them to number over one hundred and fifty,<br/>
and so tame were they that sometimes, as on rounding<br/>
a bend we would get close in-shore, they would remain<br/>
sitting on twigs as we passed almost within reach of<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
The lively cheerfulness of the Egyptian Kingfisher<br/>
always impresses me; he seems happy, and perhaps has<br/>
reason. No one molests him, the river has abundance<br/>
of fish, and, when satisfied, there is nearly always a<br/>
generous warmth in which to plume himself and<br/>
ruminate. One cannot help being struck by this<br/>
little bird's power of assimilation. I have seen <span style="color: #0000FF;">him<br/>
</span>catch a fish apparently much bigger than himself, and<br/>
