<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays fleets of well-appointed steamers rush<br/>
tourists to and from the Cataracts, and travellers of<br/>
the early'sixties would be amazed by the regularity,<br/>
rapidity, and cheapness with which the formerly adventurous voyage can now be accomplished, while the<br/>
recent railway extensions have brought <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartrim </span>itself<br/>
within a comparatively few hours of Cairo. Dinners<br/>
and dances on the decks of electrically illuminated<br/>
steamers have supplanted the quiet enjoyment of<br/>
the moonlit river gliding beneath your dahabiyeh.<br/>
Huge hotels at Luxor and Assuan attract the gayest<br/>
from Cairo, and repeat beneath the shadow of the world's<br/>
most historic ruins the <span style="color: #0000FF;">blast </span>life of London or Paris.<br/>
As with the people frequenting it, so also the native<br/>
inhabitants of the Nile banks have undergone a change,<br/>
and for the worse; for in place of the primitive, <span style="color: #ff0000;">simpleminded </span>people of the long ago, we have a populace<br/>
whose <span style="color: #ff0000;">clamouring </span>for "backsheesh "destroys much of<br/>
the pleasure of the trip, and whose former industry and<br/>
courtesy are largely undermined by the comparative<br/>
wealth annually extorted from Cook's tourists, which<br/>
enables it to spend a considerable portion of each year<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">demoralising </span>idleness.<br/>
<br/>
My own experience is, that with few exceptions<br/>
courtesy may hardly be looked for in Upper Egypt;<br/>
the slightest service, necessary or otherwise, demands its<br/>
fee, travellers being simply regarded as an annual<br/>
harvest to be reaped to its utmost possibility.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the greatly improved facilities<br/>
for travelling have enabled many thoughtful people to<br/>
<br/>
