Though generally quiescent, the Nile, like all sunny<br/>
characters, has its moments of anger, when for brief<br/>
periods passivity gives place to storm. During the<br/>
months of March and April the "khamsin" l winds<br/>
are prevalent. Blowing from the south-west and<br/>
having their origin in the heart of Africa, these hot<br/>
winds sweep across hundreds of miles of desert,<br/>
gathering volume as they travel and enveloping all<br/>
nature in a veil of whirling drift-sand, occasionally<br/>
sufficiently dense to obscure the sun. Then, lashed<br/>
into fury by the wind, the Nile becomes a dangerous<br/>
river for small boats, which are sometimes wrecked,<br/>
while even large steamers may be driven out of their<br/>
course and stranded. Though, as the name implies, the<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">khamsin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tt </span>winds cover a period of approximately fifty<br/>
days, they are intermittent in their energy; two or<br/>
three days of wind being succeeded by an equal period<br/>
of beautifully fine weather.<br/>
<br/>
From the north-west also comes a strong wind<br/>
which sometimes carries dust with it, though in this<br/>
case it never lasts long, and is frequently followed by<br/>
a heavy shower of rain. A rather curious instance<br/>
occurred some few years ago during a gymkhana at<br/>
the Pyramids. While the sports were in full swing,<br/>
a gathering gloom to the north-west attracted the<br/>
attention of some, and evidently betokened a shower.<br/>
