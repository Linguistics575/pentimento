<span>The Lower N ile<br/>
<br/>
is of great interest, and well worth doing, and can easily<br/>
be performed by steam-launch from Cairo. Should<br/>
ladies be of the party, tents and camp-beds should be<br/>
carried, local inns being impossible for them, and the<br/>
cabins of a launch too cramped for comfort. Excellent<br/>
camping-places are everywhere available, provisions of<br/>
good quality are to be bought, and such a trip as I have<br/>
described may in this way be made without inconvenience<br/>
and at moderate cost. Wild duck abound on the lower<br/>
river, which, with snipe, quail, and pigeon shooting,<br/>
goes far to relieve the tedium of the less interesting<br/>
reaches. But, though sport is plentiful, I recommend<br/>
the trip purely for its varied charm of life and scenery,<br/>
not the least attractive being the sense of adventure,<br/>
and freedom from conventionality.<br/>
<br/>
To me, Damietta was quite charming, as also was<br/>
the whole river-journey, but this visit has left with me<br/>
a feeling of pity and indignation. The people are<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">masliim</span>," <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>and I think unnecessarily so. There<br/>
seems to me to be no reason why Damietta should not<br/>
again become the flourishing shipping centre it once<br/>
was, and only the policy (instituted by Mohammed Ali)<br/>
of fostering the trade of Alexandria to the exclusion of<br/>
other ports prevents the return of at least some portion<br/>
of its former prosperity.<br/>
<br/>
Without wishing to enter upon questions of policy, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>it appears to me that this attitude of exclusion is foolish.<br/>
The trade of Alexandria is firmly established, and need.<br/>
hardly fear the rivalry of Damietta, whose commerce<br/>
