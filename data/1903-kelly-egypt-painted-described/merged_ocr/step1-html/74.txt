strength that makes the scheme. Similarly, in their<br/>
costumes black figures largely, and enhances the value<br/>
of the brighter garments the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">arbiyeh</span>" <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>partially<br/>
conceals. In fact, the general range of colour in the<br/>
streets is black, white, and blue, among which little<br/>
glints of red, yellow, purple, or green shine like jewels<br/>
in the sun.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the human attraction of the streets,<br/>
domestic architecture is interesting. The ground <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor<br/>
</span>usually consists of shops, and above are the jutting<br/>
upper stories. The supporting corbels are often richly<br/>
carved, and many of the large arched doorways of the<br/>
houses are richly moulded and embellished in a manner<br/>
suggestive of the most ornate period of Norman work.<br/>
The entablatures are frequently enriched by perforated<br/>
stone windows decorated with that intricate geometrical<br/>
design so peculiar to Saracenic art.<br/>
<br/>
The wooden doors themselves are often richly<br/>
panelled, and display large knockers of bronze inlaid<br/>
with silver. Wrought-iron or bronze grills protect<br/>
many lower windows, and the upper stories are<br/>
rendered remarkable by the projecting balcony and<br/>
windows of "<span style="color: #ff0000;">mashrubiyeh </span>"work.<br/>
<br/>
Originally these were simply small cages of latticework slightly projecting, in which were placed the<br/>
jars of drinking-water, in order that the breeze and<br/>
evaporation might cool them. The name is derived<br/>
from "<span style="color: #ff0000;">sherub</span>" (drink), and "<span style="color: #ff0000;">mashrubiyeh</span>" simply<br/>
means the "place of drink."<br/>
