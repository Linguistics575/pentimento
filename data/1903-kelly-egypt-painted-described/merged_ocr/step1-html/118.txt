<br/>
</span>the best of the ornamental woodwork from two such<br/>
houses, condemned to demolition as unsafe. Altogether<br/>
I was able to remove a great many fine "<span style="color: #ff0000;">mashrubiyeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>windows of a good period, as well as several panelled<br/>
doors and decorated "dulab."<br/>
<br/>
The ceilings were particularly fine, but proved to be<br/>
so full of vermin that I dared not remove them, and I<br/>
much regretted that lack of accommodation prevented<br/>
my securing a great deal of stone and marble ornamentation. Such opportunities are rare, however, and I am<br/>
glad to see that, among its other functions, the department so ably conducted by Hertz Bey has the power<br/>
to label any house which is considered a good example<br/>
of domestic art, "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Protected </span>"; thus, while the department may or may not require to do anything in the<br/>
way of preservation, the building remains under supervision and is secured against possible acts of vandalism.<br/>
<br/>
Close to the Bab-Zuweyla is a fine house recently<br/>
completely restored by Hertz Bey and his assistants,<br/>
which, I believe, can be inspected on application, while<br/>
in the neighbouring mosque a most perfect piece of<br/>
illuminated ceiling restoration may be seen.<br/>
<br/>
Mena House Hotel now has some of the finest<br/>
examples of "<span style="color: #ff0000;">mashrubiyeh</span>" work, especially in the<br/>
eastern balcony, and in several rooms are good examples<br/>
of carved woodwork and inlaid mural panels; and<br/>
in the grand salon of the French Embassy also is<br/>
a fine collection of decorative work, all of which is<br/>
genuine and the best of its kind. Most of the old<br/>
furniture of <span style="color: #0000FF;">wood- </span>or brass-work has disappeared,<br/>
