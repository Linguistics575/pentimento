<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
enormous blocks of red granite which break out at<br/>
various points. Beyond the town are palm-groves in<br/>
which are the barracks of the native troops, while<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>behind lie the streets and bazaars of the town.<br/>
<br/>
We were a small party in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1894</span>--<span style="color: #ff0000;">-I </span>think only eight<br/>
of us; but it was a very pleasant one, and the constant<br/>
exchange of courtesies between our hotel and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">messof </span>the 10th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siidanese</span>, then quartered there, supplied<br/>
the social element most delightfully. One evening the<br/>
mess would dine with us en bloc, the dinner <span style="color: #0000FF;">being</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>followed by a musical evening largely provided by the<br/>
ladies, who performed on mandoline, guitar, or piano,<br/>
but also memorable for the rousing choruses of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">coonsongs</span>. Another time we would join the mess. These<br/>
occasions were rendered exciting by the long <span style="color: #ff0000;">donkeyride </span>in the dark, and it was amusing to see ladies in<br/>
evening dress clinging to their steeds as they stumbled<br/>
through the palm-groves. Soldiers and donkey-boys<br/>
escorted us, some with lanterns, which only dazzled, and<br/>
perhaps added a little to the uncertainties of the ride.<br/>
<br/>
Later, we saw this regiment march out of the town<br/>
en route for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siidan</span>, its commander soon to meet <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>soldier's death, though happily the second in command<br/>
still enjoys the honours he has well earned at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartii<br/>
</span>and the Cape.<br/>
<br/>
Assuan has always been the frontier town of Egypt<br/>
proper; and at the time I speak of, though Wady<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Halfa </span>was the headquarters of the frontier force,<br/>
Mahdist bands disputed the intervening country and<br/>
rendered it unsafe for travellers.<br/>
