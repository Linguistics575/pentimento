it is very doubtful if the master is capable of anything<br/>

One of the evils of such lack of knowledge lies in<br/>
the inability of the fellahin to read books or papers,<br/>
and, being obliged to accept all extraneous information<br/>
at second hand, they are peculiarly liable to be misled<br/>
by false or prejudiced statements, often promulgated<br/>
among them by unscrupulous intriguers.<br/>

On the other hand, the education of the youth of<br/>
the great towns is now well looked after. Some years<br/>
ago I was asked by the Ministry of Public Instruction<br/>
to preside over a small commission appointed to consider the question and draw up a scheme of education<br/>
to be adopted in the Khedivial schools. The report<br/>
presented, and accepted by the Ministry, provided for<br/>
a very thorough and liberal system of education<br/>
through all the grades, from the primary to the most<br/>
advanced classes, and one sufficient to equip a boy for<br/>
any position in life. I am told that the scheme is<br/>
working well, and the Government has wisely introduced into the Education Department, as masters, gentlemen of the highest education and social position, so<br/>
that the youth of Cairo and the large towns are now<br/>
enjoying a training equal to many public! schools, and<br/>
with the advantage of association with and direction<br/>
by graduates of English <span style="color: #0000FF;">universities</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

necessary in the case of the agricultural masses, but a<br/>
great deal more should be done for them than has yet<br/>
