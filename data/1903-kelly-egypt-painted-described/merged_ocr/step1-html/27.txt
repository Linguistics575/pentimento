hin" would excite pity in a colder clime, but here<br/>
the transfiguring effect of sunshine softens every fact<br/>
and beautifies what would otherwise be repellent.<br/>
The atmosphere also is peculiarly soft and luminous,<br/>
clear to a remarkable degree, yet bathing distances in<br/>
a mellow warmth which takes away any sense of<br/>
hardness. To its sunshine and air, more than to anything else, is due perhaps that subtle and mysterious<br/>
charm which all who have ever been to Egypt unconsciously feel.<br/>
<br/>
Another factor in the case is, I think, the element<br/>
of surprise. Most people go out with a preconceived<br/>
idea of what they are going to see, and find something<br/>
entirely different. Egypt is not the conventional East,<br/>
or what is generally accepted as Oriental. It is peculiar<br/>
and individual. Sand and rocks abound, but in place of<br/>
the brazen sky convention demands, its vault is azure,<br/>
sparkling, clear. Instead of the expected sun-browned<br/>
vegetation, was ever green so vivid and transparent<br/>
as the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">bercime</span>" l fields and growing corn of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Delta </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P<br/>
<br/>
</span>The people too, though clothed in Eastern garb, are<br/>
not of one type or mould, but are good-humoured,<br/>
hard-working individuals, with many of whom the<br/>
traveller will in time become acquainted. Nor has<br/>
the landscape anything stereotyped about it, but varies<br/>
infinitely in character according to place or season.<br/>
The very towns and buildings are not quite what<br/>
had been expected, and even the Nile trip and the<br/>
