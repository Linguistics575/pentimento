ness, and it is said that once these animals are put to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkia </span>work they never again see the sun. Here is a<br/>
pretty "<span style="color: #ff0000;">esbeh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>shaded by <span style="color: #ff0000;">mulberries</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span>perhaps surrounded by a vine-walk. In the fields Isaac drives his<br/>
yoke of oxen, while Rebecca leads her flock to water,<br/>
or again, Rachel, "balass" on head, walks majestically<br/>
and gracefully in quest of her domestic water-supply.<br/>
It is all very Scriptural, and the very life and conversation of the people repeat those of the Old Testament.<br/>
<br/>
Away from the canal itself, the water is carried in<br/>
little channels to all parts of the field, and these narrow<br/>
banks again form the only defined pathway through the<br/>
cultivated lands.<br/>
<br/>
As you ride along the people press upon you offers<br/>
of hospitality in some form, and importune the traveller<br/>
to "honour the house by <span style="color: #0000FF;">breaking </span>bread in it." One<br/>
such invitation I remember very well. The farmhouse<br/>
in question stood on the opposite side of the canal,<br/>
and its owner, who was resting beneath the shade of<br/>
the fig-tree which overshadowed it, rose and begged<br/>
us to rest and have some refreshment. We declined<br/>
the polite offer, but he, exclaiming that we should<br/>
never pass his "<span style="color: #ff0000;">esbeh</span>" without eating, mounted his<br/>
horse and chased us until we were forced to return<br/>
and do him this honour. This man, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shelil-en-Nebraishi<br/>
</span>by name, <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>been exiled from Egypt and took service<br/>
with the Mahdi; he commanded a regiment of cavalry<br/>
during the early stages of the Mahdist rising, but<br/>
deserted and returned to Egypt on the appearance of<br/>
the English, with whom he said he had no quarrel.<br/>
