Throughout its history Egypt has been noted as one<br/>
of the world's granaries, and until the beginning of the<br/>
last century had little but food-stuffs to export.<br/>
<br/>
By threats of fine and punishment, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mo-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hammed </span>Ali compelled the people to plant trees and<br/>
grow cotton. To-day, cotton is one of its most<br/>
remunerative crops, and commands the highest price of<br/>
any in the market. Of late years other growths have<br/>
enormously developed. Onions, once grown solely as<br/>
a vegetable for home use, are now exported in <span style="color: #ff0000;">everincreasing </span>quantities. Sugar also, until recently planted<br/>
only for local consumption, is now a crop of such<br/>
dimensions as to employ a large amount of capital in<br/>
its manufacture, and soon to result in another valuable<br/>
addition to the export trade of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The prejudice against trees, however, seems to have<br/>
continued; for though the country is apparently well<br/>
wooded, few of the trees are of any economic value.<br/>
The date and <span style="color: #0000FF;">thim-palms </span>have their fruit, and the<br/>
leaves of the former are, as I have said, utilised in<br/>
basket-making, etc. The trunk, however, is useless as<br/>
timber, and cannot be dressed. The sycamore and<br/>
lebbek also are soft and non-enduring, and only the<br/>
tamarisk yields a wood of any soundness, but that<br/>
only in quantity sufficient for the making of their<br/>
water-wheels and farm implements. There is no<br/>
straight timber suitable for building or cabinet purposes<br/>
grown in the country, all has to be imported; and<br/>
