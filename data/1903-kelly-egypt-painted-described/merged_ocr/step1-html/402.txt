villages as these, European visitors are almost unknown,<br/>
and the inhabitants are amongst the most simple of<br/>
these primitive people. On our approach, of which<br/>
the men in the fields had given warning, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Omdeh<br/>
</span>and headmen of the village met us on the outskirts;<br/>
their pleasure on our arrival was great, and exclaiming<br/>
"What honour for our <span style="color: #0000FF;">village</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>"and "You bring a<br/>
blessing on the house! "they kissed our hands and<br/>
stirrup-irons and bade us welcome, and acting as our<br/>
guides led us through the trees to the principal gate<br/>
of the village.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kahbiina</span>, being a typical "fellah" village, may be<br/>
described rather fully. The outside walls, made of sundried mud, are practically without doors, or windows,<br/>
and have rather the appearance of a line of fortifications, the narrow lanes of the village terminating in<br/>
heavy wooden doors, closed at nightfall, and guarded<br/>
from the inside by the village watchmen. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">mud-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">huts </span>of which the village consists are usually of one<br/>
story, the roofs being covered with heaps of cotton<br/>
and "<span style="color: #ff0000;">doura </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>stalks, stored there as fuel. Space being<br/>
limited, the houses usually adjoin, leaving narrow lanes<br/>
where necessary, which form the only thoroughfares of<br/>
the town.<br/>
<br/>
Roaming at will over the house-tops are sheep, goats,<br/>
and the half-wild dog common to all these villages.<br/>
Occasionally an upper story is built to houses of<br/>
greater importance, and here and there are square<br/>
towers, erected to accommodate the thousands of <span style="color: #ff0000;">pigeons<br/>
<br/>
</span>whirling overhead. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frequently </span>these lanes end <span style="color: #0000FF;">abruptly<br/>
