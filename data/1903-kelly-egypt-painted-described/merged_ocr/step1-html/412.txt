While mentioning examples of native hospitality<br/>
and kindness, I must not forget two particular incidents<br/>
which occur to my mind, and which will show to what<br/>
an amount of trouble the native will put himself in<br/>
order to be obliging. I had been in the provinces<br/>
some little time, and had entirely exhausted my<br/>
supply of tobacco. Halting at a village, I asked the<br/>
Sheykh if he could supply me; he replied that though<br/>
he had tobacco it was not fit for "his excellency" to<br/>
smoke, but that if I would condescend to become his<br/>
guest for the time-being he would be able to supply<br/>
me shortly. It seems almost incredible that the Sheykh<br/>
straightway <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched </span>a servant on camel-back to<br/>
Zagazig with instructions to buy an "<span style="color: #ff0000;">oke</span>" <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>of the<br/>
best Turkish tobacco to be had there. It was the<br/>
third day before the journey was completed, and the<br/>
Sheykh enabled to present me with a "<span style="color: #0000FF;">smoke </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>suitable<br/>
to my station! The other case was that of a poor<br/>
man, the floor of whose hut was covered by felted rugs<br/>
of the most simple kind, and decorated by barbaric<br/>
ornaments in red and yellow paint. Out of mere<br/>
curiosity I inquired where they came from, as I had<br/>
seen nothing like them before. I was informed they<br/>
were made in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sihlan</span>, and there the matter dropped.<br/>
During the following summer, after my return to<br/>
England, a parcel arrived from Egypt, forwarded to me<br/>
