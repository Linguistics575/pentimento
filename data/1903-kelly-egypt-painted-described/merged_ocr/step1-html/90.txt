<br/>
</span>STREETS AND BAZAARS<br/>
<br/>
THE work of an artist in Cairo is full of interest, and<br/>
I look back upon many pleasurable experiences, while<br/>
others perhaps have been for the moment irritating and<br/>
occasionally disastrous. There seems to be a curious<br/>
fatality which compels the painter (if he is careful to<br/>
select the best point of view) to take his stand in the<br/>
most uncomfortable and impossible positions. Thus in<br/>
Cairo the artist will frequently find that his easel must<br/>
be planted in the middle of the street, to his own discomfort and the disturbance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic</span>. I often wonder<br/>
at the toleration which allows so much interference with<br/>
the right of way; but, as I said before, the people are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">good-natured </span>souls, and usually regard the painter as a<br/>
"magnoon," or kind of harmless lunatic, who is not to<br/>
be taken seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally you are surrounded by a crowd, while<br/>
heat, dust, and flies try your patience to the uttermost.<br/>
If you are of a nervous or irritable disposition, do not<br/>
attempt street work in Cairo. The crowd which<br/>
surrounds you, perhaps completely blocking your view,<br/>
