work, and prove the fields re-peopled. Reeds and<br/>
branches swing slowly in the quiet air, and their gentle<br/>
"swish" as the breeze passes is soothing to senses<br/>
almost lulled to sleep. With the heat of day come<br/>
the thirsty cattle or tired buffalo to wallow in the<br/>
stream ere they recommence their toil, and the kingfisher, as ever, <span style="color: #0000FF;">flashes </span>his gay plumage in the sun as he<br/>
darts from bank to stream.<br/>
<br/>
These are pictures of drowsy peacefulness which<br/>
soon give place to the glory of the sunset. Rich<br/>
verdure stretches as far as the eye can reach, deep<br/>
and strong in colour close to you, but purple in the<br/>
distance against the orange sky. The patches of<br/>
ploughed land look black against the foliage, from<br/>
which the smoke-laden village is separated by a golden<br/>
haze. Palms and tamarisks tell strongly against the<br/>
evening sky, which is hardly less bright than the<br/>
glowing point of light which marks the kindling of<br/>
a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkia </span>fire. As the night deepens, detail is lost in<br/>
the gathering gloom. The sky on the horizon still<br/>
retains something of sunset glow, which melts through<br/>
rose and violet into the pure depth of blue overhead.<br/>
A crescent moon, with attendant star, shines crisp and<br/>
clear in the vault, where, one by one, other stars appear<br/>
to mark the approach of night. With drooping arms,<br/>
palm-trees beckon to their reflections in the water<br/>
at your feet, as though in pleasure that the heat of<br/>
day is over. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkias </span>have stopped their groaning,<br/>
and only the cry of a night-bird or the <span style="color: #ff0000;">croaking </span>of<br/>
the frogs breaks the stillness. The whole transition<br/>
