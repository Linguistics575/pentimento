energy <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>attention of the "rais," under whose direction a strong pull on one side or the other by the<br/>
rowers carries the boat clear of a sunken rock or<br/>
dangerous current. The work is done silently and<br/>
anxiously until, at a given signal, the boat is with great<br/>
difficulty rounded up and moored to the bank a<br/>
hundred yards or so above the Cataract. Taking up<br/>
your position lower down, the "fantasia" begins.<br/>
One by one the naked swimmers plunge into the stream,<br/>
each with a log of wood about five feet in length, and<br/>
of the thickness of a man's thigh. Reappearing, each<br/>
man is astride of his log, which sinks under his weight<br/>
until the water is above the waist, and only the end of<br/>
the log appears. Assisting the impetus of the stream<br/>
by powerful strokes, the swimmer rushes down the<br/>
narrow, seething waters. Now he is caught in a wave<br/>
which leaps high into the air, and a moment later is<br/>
sucked under by the eddy which succeeds; again the<br/>
log shoots clear out of the water, but is soon recaptured<br/>
by the swimmer. So they pass by you with terrific<br/>
velocity, now entirely lost among the swirling waves,<br/>
and again almost forced out of the water by the<br/>
pent-up energy of the stream. It is a "battle-royal,"<br/>
for life and a "backsheesh "<span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
<br/>
</span>The force of the current is perhaps best realised on<br/>
the return journey, when the untiring and strenuous<br/>
exertions of the crew barely make headway. At last<br/>
the smoother water of the wider stream above is<br/>
reached and sail again set, and the crew, released from<br/>
their rowing, break into a song of thanksgiving, in<br/>
