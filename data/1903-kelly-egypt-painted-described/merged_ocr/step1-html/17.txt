<span>Author's Note<br/>
<br/>
IN response to the expressed wish of many friends, I<br/>
have ventured to present in book form some of the<br/>
impressions and experiences derived from a somewhat<br/>
lengthened residence in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
In doing so, I make no attempt to produce a work<br/>
of any critical value, my aim being rather to give a<br/>
broadly pictorial representation of the life and scenery<br/>
of the country, and particularly those phases of each<br/>
which lie off the beaten track. Nor do I pretend to<br/>
fully illustrate my text or describe my illustrations; but<br/>
my hope is, that each, amplifying the other, may convey<br/>
to the reader a little of the fascination of the country,<br/>
and perhaps excite some feeling of sympathetic interest<br/>
in a people I have learned to like so well.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">would </span>like to avail myself of this opportunity of<br/>
expressing my grateful thanks to my many friends in<br/>
Egypt, who, by facilities offered and information given,<br/>
have so materially assisted me in gaining such know<br/>
ledge of the country as I possess. My thanks are also<br/>
