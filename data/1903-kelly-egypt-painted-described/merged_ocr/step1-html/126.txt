<span>Egypt<br/>
England the university Mosque of El Azhar (or "the<br/>
splendid ") was founded (A.D. <span style="color: #ff0000;">97o</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all the earlier mosques consisted of a more<br/>
or less square court surrounded by <span style="color: #ff0000;">cloisters </span>supported<br/>
on pillars, which in many cases, as in El Azhar and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalaran</span>, were robbed from Christian churches or Greek<br/>
and Roman temples.<br/>
<br/>
We see then that, quite apart from any pictorial<br/>
value these mosques may have, their historic interest<br/>
is great; and it is remarkable that at a time when<br/>
Gothic in Europe was declining, the Saracenic style<br/>
in Egypt produced its most perfect example in the<br/>
tomb mosque of Kait Bey, and for a considerable<br/>
time subsequently continued to produce good designs.<br/>
Generally speaking, the mosque was also the mausoleum<br/>
of its founder, such tomb mosques being distinguished<br/>
by the dome in addition to the minaret; for while the<br/>
latter is a usual feature in mosque design, the dome<br/>
is only employed when marking some burial-place<br/>
below.1 It is worth remark also that in most cases<br/>
these monuments of art were the design of <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>man,<br/>
and were completed during the lifetime of an individual;<br/>
and, although lacking some of the interest which attaches<br/>
to the<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>mixed styles and gradual development of most<br/>
of our cathedral piles, they have instead a completeness<br/>
and homogeneity which leave nothing to be desired.<br/>
<br/>
I have already mentioned several of the more<br/>
important mosques which should be seen and studied,<br/>
