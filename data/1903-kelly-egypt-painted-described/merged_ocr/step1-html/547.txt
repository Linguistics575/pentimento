parties; but to the curious observer the culminating<br/>
point is reached when, on the last evening of their<br/>
festal days, the party forms into a procession called the<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Zeffet-el-Arusa</span>" and escorts the bride to her new<br/>
home. The bride is mounted on a camel, but is entirely<br/>
hidden from view by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>mahmal," or canopy, formed<br/>
by a large shawl spread over a booth of palm-branches,<br/>
which is attached to the saddle. Before her, leading<br/>
the procession, are the village musicians, and following<br/>

camels which carry her <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ares </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">permit</span>: and the gifts<br/>

written signature to a document is not considered valid<br/>
unless attested, the assumption being that no one can<br/>
write except the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">kaitib</span>" l and the signature therefore is a forgery. Instead of writing it, signatures<br/>
are affixed by seal, the holder's identity having to<br/>
be established before the seal can be cut and handed<br/>
over.<br/>

Generally speaking, the education provided by the<br/>
native schools consists simply in the teaching of <span style="color: #0000FF;">certain<br/>
