</span>The Desert and the Bedawin<br/>
<br/>
While a guest of the Sheykh Mansour Abn Nasrullah, chief of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nefaarta </span>Arabs, I had an opportunity<br/>
of hearing one of these songs, which merits some<br/>
description. We were seated in the Sheykh's tent, all<br/>
the headmen of the tribe being present to enjoy this<br/>
narration of the prowess of their ancestors.<br/>
<br/>
The bard was an old man, grey-bearded and<br/>
withered, and was accompanied by his son, who would<br/>
succeed him. Each carried a two-stringed instrument<br/>
which is played with a bow, called the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">kemengeh</span>";<br/>
and having by many preliminaries worked his audience<br/>
up to the proper pitch of excited anticipation, the bard<br/>
began the "Song of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nefaarta</span>."<br/>
<br/>
Introduced by a weird accompaniment on the<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">kemengeh</span>," to which the boy played a kind of second,<br/>
it commenced like the sighing of the wind in the trees,<br/>
or the sound of its sweep across the desert when the<br/>
sand blows gently through the thorns. Gathering<br/>
volume by degrees, and with an infinite variation of its<br/>
opening theme, a gradual crescendo led up to the commencement of the song itself.<br/>
<br/>
Going back for generations, the legend described the<br/>
growing of the parent tribe into a power in Mesopotamia; how later, when camels and horses and doughty<br/>
warriors were numerous, they decided upon the conquest of Tunis. Every varying mood was <span style="color: #ff0000;">emphasised<br/>
</span>by the accompaniment, and one seemed to hear the<br/>
hurried riding of messengers sent to summon distant<br/>
families, till the sound of their horses' hoof-strokes was<br/>
lost in the desert wind.<br/>
