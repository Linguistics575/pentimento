<span>The N ile<br/>
<br/>
The village of Edfu is entirely lacking in pictorial<br/>
interest, but appears to be cleaner and better built than<br/>
many of the mud-towns on the Nile. It can, however,<br/>
boast of a good school and evidently capable teacher.<br/>
On returning from the temple this year, a boy of ten or<br/>
twelve attached himself to our party, and began to speak<br/>
in very good English, which he informed us had been<br/>
entirely acquired in the village school. Presently he<br/>
turned to one of the party, and said, "You are not<br/>
English, you are American."<br/>
<br/>
"Well," replied the gentleman, "that is so, but<br/>
what do you know about <span style="color: #ff0000;">America </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">P </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>"America is called the New World, and was discovered by Columbus."<br/>
<br/>
"Perhaps you know all about Chicago <span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span>"<br/>
<br/>
"Chicago is a large city built upon Lake Michigan,<br/>
and some time ago destroyed by fire."<br/>
<br/>
"And New <span style="color: #0000FF;">York </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span>"<br/>
<br/>
"Is the leading seaport of America on the coast of<br/>
the Atlantic."<br/>
<br/>
"What about Liverpool? <span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Liverpool is the second city <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">England</span>, and stands<br/>
upon the Mersey."<br/>
<br/>
So it went on, each answer being readily and correctly given, and not entirely parrot fashion, for subsequent questions proved him to have an intelligent<br/>
knowledge of many subjects upon which we examined<br/>
him. On parting at the steamer, he declined a "tip,"<br/>
saying that "he always liked a talk with the English,<br/>
for no one could get on who did not speak their<br/>
