<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
extravagance of tourists, even beggars will hardly<br/>
think you for them, and the substitution of piastres<br/>
instead of <span style="color: #ff0000;">milli√©mes </span>as "<span style="color: #ff0000;">backsheesh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>has added<br/>
appreciably to the incidental expenses of the trip.<br/>
When it is considered that the daily wage of the<br/>
majority of these people does not exceed two or<br/>
three piastres, it will be readily understood how disproportionate and bad in its influence is any excessive<br/>
dispensing of "largesse "by travellers.<br/>
<br/>
At many of these landing-places interesting curios<br/>
are to be bought: inlaid walking-sticks and pottery,<br/>
ornamental baskets and dish-covers made from coloured<br/>
grasses plaited in good designs, and the inevitable<br/>
Egyptian "<span style="color: #ff0000;">antilcas</span>." Stuffed animals and horns are<br/>
to be avoided, but some really beautiful fabrics are<br/>
to be had, and occasionally a good coin or ornament<br/>
in metal-work.<br/>
<br/>
What a lively ten minutes it is for the would-be<br/>
purchaser, whose bargaining must be carried on in<br/>
pigeon-English and under stress of time! It is all<br/>
very amusing, and the final scramble in the mud for<br/>
the odd coins thrown ashore as the steamer leaves<br/>
is really most laughable.<br/>
<br/>
These stoppages, with their attendant noise and<br/>
bustle, form excellent foils to the easy-going life of<br/>
your steamer, and perhaps serve to increase the delight<br/>
with which the traveller revels in the constantly varying<br/>
beauty of the mountains on the eastern side.<br/>
<br/>
Take for instance the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat-topp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>range of <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eshun<br/>
</span>or the castellated bluffs of Gibel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr-es-Saad</span>. Notice<br/>
