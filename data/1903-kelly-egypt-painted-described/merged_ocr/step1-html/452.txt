<span>CHAPTER XII<br/>
THE DESERT AND THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">BEDAwiN<br/>
<br/>
</span>THE suddenness with which the cultivation of the<br/>
Delta ceases and the surrounding deserts begin is one<br/>
of the most striking of Egypt's many dramatic contrasts.<br/>
Occasionally, as I have described in the preceding<br/>
chapter, a marshy zone separates the two, but more<br/>
generally the transition is abrupt and immediate.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the picturesque fellah and his richly pastoral<br/>
surroundings, a few steps often are sufficient to introduce<br/>
the wanderer into what is practically a new existence.<br/>
<br/>
Not only is the scenery entirely changed, but its life<br/>
also, human or animal, has little in common with that of<br/>
the black soil, and presents features which, though of<br/>
equal interest, are essentially different.<br/>
<br/>
What is there about the desert which so irresistibly<br/>
attracts those who have lived upon it? I am often<br/>
asked the question, but find it hard to give a ready<br/>
answer. There is a sense of freedom born of its own<br/>
immensity, and the majesty of its awful stillness, which<br/>
is strangely impressive, while its variety of colour and<br/>
character effectually robs it of any charge of monotony.<br/>
