<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt<br/>
<br/>
</span>the Delta, where, by living among them in all their<br/>
primitive surroundings, an insight into their <span style="color: #0000FF;">character<br/>
</span>and habits is acquired which would be impossible in any<br/>
other way.<br/>
<br/>
As being typical of all, let me describe the <span style="color: #ff0000;">life </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0<br/>
</span>the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">fellah </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>as found in the province of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sharkiyeh</span>, or<br/>
Eastern province, of the Delta. This is practically <span style="color: #0000FF;">t<br/>
</span>land of Goshen, and still retains many traces of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Israelitish </span>days. Here the tourist is unknown, and the busy<br/>
whirl of latter-day civilisation has hardly yet penetrate<br/>
to districts whose inhabitants contentedly follow <span style="color: #0000FF;">live<br/>
</span>of patriarchal simplicity.<br/>
<br/>
My headquarters here have usually been at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fakiis</span>,<br/>
a thriving market-town in the centre of the province,<br/>
beautifully situated at the junction of two large canals,<br/>
and surrounded by the green fields and palm-groves <span style="color: #0000FF;">So<br/>
</span>characteristic of this part of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Here I made the acquaintance of the leading landowner, Sheykh Mohammed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abdiin</span>, Sheykh of th<br/>
town, and a model of all that hospitality and <span style="color: #ff0000;">integrit<br/>
</span>should be.<br/>
<br/>
I had just arrived from Cairo, and was putting <span style="color: #0000FF;">up<br/>
</span>the Irrigation Rest House as the guest of a Cover<br/>
ment servant temporarily quartered there. My <span style="color: #0000FF;">advent<br/>
</span>proved a serious strain upon the commissariat department; and as it was after sunset, there seemed <span style="color: #0000FF;">slight</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>prospect of our being able to replenish. All <span style="color: #ff0000;">anxiet<br/>
</span>on this score, however, was removed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrival<br/>
</span>messengers, who, presenting the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">salaams </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>of th<br/>
Sheykh, begged the honour of our company at <span style="color: #0000FF;">din<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">158<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
