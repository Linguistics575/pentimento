<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
The era of the modern Egyptians may be considered<br/>
to date from the accession of Mohammed Ali in 1811,<br/>
during whose reign so many public works were in-.<br/>
augurated, but again at the cost of forced labour and<br/>
excessive taxation of the poor "fellah."<br/>
<br/>
Never characterised by strong action, and by long<br/>
tradition trained to submission, the people suffered in<br/>
patience the cruelty, extortion, and frightful injustice<br/>
of the pashalik system of government; until, with the<br/>
expulsion of Ismail and the advent of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik </span>Pasha and<br/>
the Dual Control, there began that new era whose<br/>
impartial justice and wise administration of the country<br/>

</span>With such a history, it is little wonder that the<br/>
Egyptian has many traits which are to be condemned.<br/>
Oppression has developed in him a propensity to lying<br/>
and deceit, and, childlike, he seeks to make up for<br/>
insignificance by noise; and, as is always the case among<br/>
a persecuted race, vengeance for the cruelty they themselves suffer is wreaked upon the weaker, or on beasts.<br/>
Much as I like the "native," his cruelty to animals is<br/>
terrible at times; and one of the very few occasions on<br/>
which I have got into trouble in Cairo, was when I<br/>
interfered to put a stop to a child's amusing itself by<br/>
plucking the feathers from a struggling pigeon, held by<br/>
her father for the purpose!<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, they are industrious, simple in<br/>
their habits, and devoted to their children; and, as I<br/>
have shown, hospitable to the stranger. Courteous to<br/>
