<span>Streets and Bazaars<br/>

"I have sold that embroidery for so <span style="color: #0000FF;">much</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>" "Well,"<br/>
I said, "was not that the price you <span style="color: #ff0000;">wanted </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>"Yes,"<br/>
he replied, "but why did I not ask double! "so that<br/>
the buyer probably paid a great deal too much for his<br/>
purchase, and left the dealer <span style="color: #0000FF;">unhappy-all </span>due to<br/>
haste. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Few </span>of us, however, could reach the sublime<br/>
heights of one shopkeeper I encountered in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Suken-Nahassin </span>(or coppersmiths' bazaar). I wished to<br/>
buy a "sheesha," or water-pipe, and saw the one I<br/>
wanted just over the man's head. With the blandest<br/>
smile, "En <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nahass</span>" pointed out that he was seated<br/>
then, and the pipe out of reach, but would I mind<br/>
getting it another day when he was standing, as he<br/>
saw me pass that way very often, and there could be<br/>
no hurry <span style="color: #0000FF;">t.<br/>

</span>This street of the coppersmiths is one of the most<br/>
interesting of bazaar streets. Here in poky little<br/>
shops are sold all sorts of domestic utensils in brass and<br/>
copper, nearly always beautiful in form, though rather<br/>
rough in workmanship. A very large trade is done<br/>
here, the natives often investing savings in copper-work,<br/>
which is always sold by weight, and is readily <span style="color: #0000FF;">marketable </span>in case of need. Out of this branch the shoemakers' and silversmiths' bazaars, and, crossing the<br/>
Muski, its continuation forms that of the cloth-sellers,<br/>
from which open the spice, scent, and Tunis bazaars.<br/>
The latter is very paintable, though entirely lacking<br/>
anything in the way of structural beauty.<br/>
<br/>
The whole of this district is one of superabundant interest. F <span style="color: #ff0000;">rom </span>the Bab-en-Nasr to the Sharia <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed<br/>
