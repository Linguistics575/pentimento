<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt<br/>
<br/>
</span>tion of Egypt is represented by the crumbling <span style="color: #0000FF;">debris<br/>
</span>which partially cover magnificent buildings erected a<br/>
thousand years before their advent in the country.<br/>
<br/>
So much of antiquity is here, that the ordinary<br/>
person, comfortably settled in an up-to-date hotel,<br/>
and surrounded by a world of Western fashion, may<br/>
well be perplexed by such an incongruity of dates;<br/>
and it is difficult at first to realise that Joseph and<br/>
his brethren may possibly have witnessed the commencement of many of these piles, or that their<br/>
unhappy descendants may as slaves have toiled in<br/>
their completion. The mind becomes bewildered,<br/>
and, to those who are unversed in hieroglyphics or<br/>
the ancient history of the land, interest in the<br/>
monuments must be largely pictorial.<br/>
<br/>
Still, even to the lay mind many characteristic<br/>
features of design and decoration must appeal. No<br/>
one who has seen the colonnade at Luxor could<br/>
fail to appreciate the grandeur of its columns or<br/>
the splendid boldness of the capitals. The lofty<br/>
obelisk, and granite statue of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, are but<br/>
a foretaste of that greatness of idea which culminates<br/>
in the magnificence of Karnak or the stupendous<br/>
dignity of the Colossi.<br/>
<br/>
No expert knowledge is necessary for the appreciation of Karnak. It immediately fascinates the visitor,<br/>
whose wonder grows as he wanders through its ruined<br/>
halls, and vainly attempts to picture it as it once was,<br/>
and repeople its courts with the stately pageantry of its<br/>
religious processions.<br/>
