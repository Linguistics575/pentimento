<span>The Life of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Fellah"<br/>
<br/>
copious irrigation, be quickly brought under cultivation,<br/>
and, in the course of three or four years, be productive<br/>
of two or even three crops per annum. Everything<br/>
depends upon his own industry, and with free water<br/>
and proper application the fellah is able to live with<br/>
some degree of comfort upon a holding of eight to ten<br/>
feddans of <span style="color: #ff0000;">land..<br/>
<br/>
</span>If any proof were wanting as to the prosperity and<br/>
security of tenure now enjoyed by the fellahin, it is<br/>
to be found in their eagerness to buy land, and their<br/>
ability to pay for it.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of Government land (which is usually<br/>
sold by auction on the spot), rather than add to estates<br/>
already large, preference is given to smaller buyers, who,<br/>
by a graduated system of payments, are enabled to pay<br/>
off the purchase-money and yearly taxation by instalments: a system which, while encouraging thrift among<br/>
the people, incidentally restores to circulation large sums<br/>
of hoarded wealth.<br/>
<br/>
One thing which must strike the observer is the<br/>
entire absence of fences or other divisions between<br/>
estates or farms. Certainly the canals do supply leading<br/>
boundary marks, but otherwise the country is apparently<br/>
one continuous field, where each farmer knows to a<br/>
nicety the extent of his holding, which is roughly<br/>
indicated by a stone or post here and there, landmarks<br/>
which no one would commit the crime of removing.<br/>
Should doubt or dispute arise upon these points, the<br/>
matter is usually adjusted by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">omdeh </span>or sheykh of<br/>
the village.<br/>
