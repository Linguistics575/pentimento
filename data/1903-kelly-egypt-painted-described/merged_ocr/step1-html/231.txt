repeated this with every cast. I watched the pair<br/>
for some time with amusement, and I really think<br/>
that the bird caught more than the fisherman, in<br/>

Very frequently may be seen perched high up on<br/>
the bank native boats in course of construction or<br/>
repair. Seeing them out of water gives one a better<br/>
idea of their proportions. The sweep of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">high<br/>
</span>bow is really beautiful, as also the model of the hull<br/>
itself. It always strikes me as curious that, though<br/>
no building-plan is used and the workmen appear<br/>
to construct their vessel by rule of thumb, still in the<br/>
whole length of the river the model of each class of<br/>
boat is identical. It is worth while watching the<br/>
boat-builder at work, and one can only wonder that<br/>
so much beauty of line and proportion can be got<br/>
out of the scraps of wood and twisted timbers of<br/>
which they are built. It may be noticed also that<br/>
invariably they are "hogbacked," that is, that the<br/>
keel, instead of being straight, inclines upwards from<br/>
each end of the boat so that it is lost amidships.<br/>
The reason for this is, that while the depth of keel<br/>
at bow and stern gives the vessel sufficient hold on<br/>
the water for sailing purposes, should it strike a<br/>
bank the cut-water will easily carry through, and by<br/>
reason of its flat bottom and shallower draught amidship the whole body of the boat will "jump" the<br/>
obstruction. The high lateen sail also is the result<br/>
of experience and local necessity; for were European<br/>
