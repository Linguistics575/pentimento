<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
of us (of whom my wife was the only lady) sat down<br/>
to an excellent meal served on a large round table. A<br/>
good bottle of claret was provided for us, but otherwise<br/>
the dishes were all Egyptian, and eaten with the hands<br/>
in the orthodox manner, each diner vying with the<br/>
other in picking out tit-bits for my wife, which were<br/>
offered with the most graceful courtesy. Her ready<br/>
acceptance of the position gave great delight to the<br/>
other guests, while our host presented her on leaving<br/>
with several curios of value. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Achmed </span>Effendi has passed<br/>
to his eternal home, but his brother, Said Mustapha,<br/>
whom I saw a short time ago, has succeeded to the<br/>
office, and worthily maintains the tradition of hospitality<br/>
associated with the name of Ayyad.<br/>
<br/>
To those in search of such mementoes, many good<br/>
curios can be picked up here at moderate cost, either<br/>
from a dragoman (if you know "<span style="color: #ff0000;">antikas</span>"), or should<br/>
you not feel confident in your own judgment, the<br/>
porter at Pagnon's Hotel usually has a collection from<br/>
which to select, and his information and advice may<br/>
be relied upon. The trade in spurious curios is very<br/>
general, and it is surprising to what trouble and<br/>
expense the native will occasionally put himself in<br/>
their manufacture. There is a rare gold coin much<br/>
sought for but rarely to be had, which in weight is<br/>
equal to five English sovereigns, though of course of<br/>
much greater value. A gentleman was offered what<br/>
appeared to be a genuine specimen for the relatively<br/>
paltry sum of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Â£7</span>, a fact which made him suspicious<br/>
of its genuineness. On testing, it proved to be of gold<br/>
