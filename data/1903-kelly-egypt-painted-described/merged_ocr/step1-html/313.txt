</span>Sheykh, his men put their backs and shoulders <span style="color: #0000FF;">under<br/>
</span>our vessel, and, on the word, gave a "heave," which<br/>
lifted her bodily a few feet. In this way we were<br/>
gradually carried over the bank, past the obstructing<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">giassas</span>," and launched fairly in the channel above<br/>
them, where we anchored and went ashore with the<br/>
Sheykh to breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
While the watermen are universally poor, there are<br/>
many prosperous farms in the district, some proprietors<br/>
being wealthy, among whom must be classed our host,<br/>
the Sheykh of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tarbaniyeh</span>. His house was imposing<br/>
in appearance, having many courts and gardens, and,<br/>
mirabile <span style="color: #0000FF;">dicta</span>, seemed well built and equipped. The<br/>
refreshments provided were certainly excellent, and,<br/>
what is more unusual in country districts, the cigarettes were unquestionable. The gardens would have<br/>
delighted suburban residents at home, and suggested<br/>
the palace of a pasha rather than that of a "yellow"<br/>
sheykh. Leaving the reception-room on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">groundfloor</span>, French windows opened into a rose-garden, the<br/>
well-kept walks being shadowed by vines and figs on<br/>
trellis-work. Clumps of feathery bamboo sprang from<br/>
"round points" in the walks, a fountain and fishpond adding refreshing coolness to the shady <span style="color: #0000FF;">quadrangle</span>. The whole was surrounded by a Cloister with<br/>
alcoves at the corners, and through a central arch you<br/>
entered an orchard and vegetable-garden beyond, in<br/>
which were tamarinds, Japanese medlars, oranges, limes,<br/>
almonds, pomegranates, artichokes, and asparagus, etc.,<br/>
the borders of the beds being of carnations, pansies,<br/>
