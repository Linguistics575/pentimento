<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
rugged hills of grotesquely piled-up rock, among which<br/>
are little patches of cultivation and an occasional<br/>
hamlet; at the water's edge the red-granite boulders<br/>
have, under the combined action of sun and water,<br/>
become coated with a glistening skin of black, smooth<br/>
to touch, and polished as though an army of <span style="color: #0000FF;">house-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">maids </span>had been engaged in <span style="color: #ff0000;">blackleading </span>them. A<br/>
little higher their own ruddy tint gleams bright in<br/>
the sunshine. On the western side the high hills are<br/>
almost entirely covered by the drift-sand poured over<br/>
them from the deserts beyond; and among the many<br/>
beauties Egypt has to show, none are more lovely than<br/>
these enormous wreaths of sand, gold in colour and<br/>
with a sheen like satin. From the terrace of the new<br/>
Cataract Hotel is a very fine view of these <span style="color: #ff0000;">sandcovered </span>mountains, whose local colour is enhanced by<br/>
the outjutting rocks of red and plum-colour, the<br/>
vivid verdure of the islands, and the delicately blue sky,<br/>
all more or less repeated in the water below.<br/>
<br/>
It is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phila</span>, however, which most people come to see,<br/>
and usually no time is lost before the excursion is made.<br/>
This should be done on donkey-back, every bit of<br/>
the journey being interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after leaving the town you will reach the<br/>
Cufic Cemetery, an extensive burial-ground, whose<br/>
ancient tombs and cupolas have a certain picture value;<br/>
or a slight divergence from the direct path allows of an<br/>
inspection of the old granite quarries, whence most, if<br/>
not all, of the huge monoliths which we have got to<br/>
know have been brought. Here may still be seen the<br/>
<br/>
