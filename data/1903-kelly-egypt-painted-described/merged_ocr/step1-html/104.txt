<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Ali is one long sequence of animated pictures, in which<br/>
appear types of almost every Oriental race. Moors<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fez</span>, Algerines and Tunisians from the western<br/>
states, and from the East, Syrians, Persians, and traders<br/>
from Cashmere-all are to be found among its teeming<br/>
population, each by costume and facial characteristics<br/>
readily distinguishable from their Egyptian fellows.<br/>
<br/>
Various incidents of greater or less importance<br/>
attract attention. See how majestically the women walk,<br/>
carrying on their heads the quaintly <span style="color: #ff0000;">shaped </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>balass," l<br/>
or, cross-legged on the shoulder, the few weeks old<br/>
infant which clings tightly to its mother's head-dress.<br/>
How strangely also trivial facts occasionally strike the<br/>
onlooker! I well remember my momentary sense of<br/>
astonishment when for the first time I heard a native<br/>
infant cry. It was so entirely like one of our own,<br/>
that I felt quite a glow of sympathy and kinship.<br/>
Notice also the kindness shown to the blind or crippled<br/>
by the passers-by; or you may see a native sharing his<br/>
frugal meal with the mangy and half-starved dog he<br/>
would be defiled by touching.<br/>
<br/>
Here and there, let into the walls, are large slabs<br/>
of stone, frequently richly inscribed, from which project one or more nozzles or spouts. These lead to a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">water-tank </span>within, and by sucking the wayfarer is<br/>
able to quench his thirst. See those two little mites,<br/>
hot and tired by their playing, vainly <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavouring </span>to<br/>
reach the fountain so far beyond them. Presently one<br/>
atom, clasping the other round the knees, succeeds in<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>The usual <span style="color: #0000FF;">two-handled </span>water-pot.<br/>
