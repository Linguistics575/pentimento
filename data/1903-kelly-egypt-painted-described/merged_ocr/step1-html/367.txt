distributing centre. I visited the market-place, which<br/>
I found to be rather more than usually picturesque,<br/>
especially in the number of women seated in long rows<br/>
on the ground, and offering for sale a great variety of<br/>
articles, from cotton prints and glass bangles to antimony and scents. Many were engaged in grinding<br/>
antimony into the "Kohl" used by all women in the<br/>
shading of their eyes and eyebrows. The antimony<br/>
was ground by means of a mortar and pestle made of<br/>
brass; most of them were quaint in form and of great<br/>
age, and on being struck rang like a bell. After some<br/>
good-humoured bargaining I secured one, and found its<br/>
great weight added considerably to my baggage for the<br/>
rest of the journey. Many of these women wore veils<br/>
on which were stitched gold and silver coins, probably<br/>
their dowry on marriage; others had strings of coins or<br/>
gold ornaments attached to the "mandil," or scarf,<br/>
which bound the head. One I particularly noticed,<br/>
evidently an heiress, the weight of whose fortune<br/>
depending from her head-dress almost prevented her<br/>
walking upright. People hereabouts are evidently<br/>
well-to-do, and many thriving shops adorned the town:<br/>
among others was a very well-equipped "Apothecaries'<br/>
Hall," where, on the invitation of the chemist, we<br/>
enjoyed a light meal.<br/>
<br/>
Here also are made a great many figured and<br/>
coloured mats, some of great size, and mostly of good<br/>
design. The weaving-sheds were large and airy, and<br/>
it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>interesting to watch the work proceeding.<br/>
