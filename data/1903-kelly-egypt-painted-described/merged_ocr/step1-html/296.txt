masonry a worthy dame of such proportions that, <span style="color: #0000FF;">had<br/>
</span>she stumbled in her climbing, he could not have escaped<br/>
destruction beneath her fall! This same child had<br/>
pluck, however, for on one of the party laughingly<br/>
threatening to throw him into the water from the<br/>
terrace on which we were standing, the youngster<br/>
promptly dived in himself, a distance of probably thirty<br/>
feet or more, and swimming to the bank disappeared<br/>
among the trees. Presently, however, he returned,<br/>
pushing in front of him, as he swam, a log which bore<br/>
the still more diminutive form of the infant sister he<br/>
brought to claim the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">backsheesh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>he had earned!<br/>

All these people are more or less amphibious, and<br/>
apparently take to water before they can walk. Even<br/>
young lads will fearlessly swim the lesser cataracts, and<br/>
employ a sort of overhand stroke which keeps their<br/>
heads and chests well above the waves; and it is very<br/>
amusing to see half a dozen or more of them plunge in<br/>
from the rocks like so many frogs, and whirl down the<br/>
rapid much as children might prance across a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hayfield</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Log-swimming down the "Great Gate," or principal<br/>
rapid of the Cataract, is a feat for men, and worth<br/>
seeing. A boat is procured at Shelal, and is manned<br/>
by eight or ten swarthy Berberin, under the control <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>a competent "rais," who requires a quick eye and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>strong arm if he would avoid disaster. Starting in<br/>
smooth water and under sail, it is not long before the<br/>
impetus of the stream is felt as the channel narrows.<br/>
Then the sail is taken in, and the rowers get out their<br/>
sweeps. Eddies catch the boat and demand all the<br/>
