<span>The Lower <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile<br/>
</span>good-natured folk, whose philosophy and <span style="color: #0000FF;">industry<br/>
</span>serve to some extent to overcome the natural poverty<br/>
of their condition.<br/>
<br/>
At last a sudden bend in the river brought us into<br/>
full and immediate view of Damietta: a glorious stretch<br/>
of piled-up buildings, domes, and minarets, broken by<br/>
the masts and spars of innumerable feluccas and <span style="color: #ff0000;">giassas<br/>
</span>with their high lateen sails, coasting-vessels from Alexandria and Port Said, Greek wine-boats, schooners and<br/>
brigs from Italy and the Levant, all serving to produce<br/>
an impression of prosperity and trade.<br/>
<br/>
Alas, poor Damietta! the Venice of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span>its trade<br/>
is but a shadow of what it had been, and, like its prototype, little is left of its earlier prosperity but the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fastdecaying </span>palaces and mosques, and other evidences of<br/>
a once important and flourishing position in the world<br/>
of trade.<br/>
<br/>
The visitor to Damietta is at once impressed with<br/>
the fact that here is something quite different from<br/>
anything he has seen elsewhere in Egypt. Its main<br/>
features differ essentially from other Nile cities.<br/>
<br/>
Built upon the east bank, the houses rise from the<br/>
water as at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biilak</span>, but in most cases have as their<br/>
basement a stone wharf or landing-stage, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>broad<br/>
paved quay in front of the Government buildings proclaims Damietta a maritime port. Along the waterside are several of the principal mosques, broad steps<br/>
leading to the river, as at the Ghauts of Benares.<br/>
Here the faithful perform their ablutions preparatory<br/>
to prayer. Boats laden with fruit and food-stuffs hawk<br/>
