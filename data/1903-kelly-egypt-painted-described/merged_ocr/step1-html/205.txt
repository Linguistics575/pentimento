<br/>
</span>How rich in colour the water is, each wavelet catching<br/>
a little of reflected blue which gives a sparkle to its<br/>
otherwise chocolate-coloured mass! A boat with flapping<br/>
sail is landing passengers and goods on a sandbank, or,<br/>
running well with the wind, is throwing off a creamy<br/>
cataract from its high-pointed bow. See the shape of<br/>
the sails as they bend to the wind, and the gleam of sunlight upon the bellying canvas, as with quick tacks the<br/>
boat follows the tortuous channel of the river. Between<br/>
the masts you will notice a short post from which hangs<br/>
a brown canvas bag. This contains the provisions of<br/>
the crew, and is placed there in the sight of all so that<br/>
no one can indulge in a surreptitious meal.<br/>
<br/>
Here and there between places of importance a<br/>
ferry-boat crosses with its freight of passengers or live<br/>
stock, while round the distant bend in the river appears<br/>
a group of vessels, with sails "goosewinged," running<br/>
before the wind like a flight of sea-birds.<br/>
<br/>
On the banks, silhouetted against the sky, countryfolk pass from village to village driving camels and<br/>
donkeys laden with produce or building material, while<br/>
the handsome bullock and patient "<span style="color: #ff0000;">gamoos </span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>tethered<br/>
in the fields, or turning the water-wheels, serve in turn<br/>
to vary the life of the scene. Half-naked men<br/>
laboriously working at the "shadoofs" lift irrigating<br/>
water for the fields; and women and children are as<br/>
usual occupied in laundry-work at the water's edge, or,<br/>
statuesquely erect, bear away their "balass" of water<br/>
gracefully poised upon their heads.<br/>
