eventually, after many efforts, swallow it, without so far<br/>
as I could see increasing in bulk, and a moment later<br/>
he is on the hunt again. How many victims have<br/>
already been consumed it would be impossible to say,<br/>
but it is evident that the Kingfisher has powers of<br/>
rapid digestion which this dyspeptic age might well<br/>

Quietly the days passed, halting when I wished to<br/>
sketch, or when my companion had inspection work to<br/>
do. At sundown we would select a clean site near the<br/>
canal-bank upon which to pitch our tents, and after<br/>
dining in the little saloon of our yacht, would turn in<br/>
and sleep till shortly before sunrise. No dramatic<br/>
incident marked the trip, <span style="color: #ff0000;">our </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.only </span>excitement being<br/>
perhaps occasioned by wandering cattle becoming <span style="color: #ff0000;">enta.ngled </span>in our tent-ropes during the dark hours of the<br/>
night; otherwise it was simply one succession of days<br/>
in which easy travelling was combined with pleasant<br/>
work. Without entering into detailed description of<br/>
the whole journey, one or two of the villages on the<br/>
banks may specially be mentioned. Mit Hadid is one<br/>
of the most picturesque of the many beautiful villages<br/>
that we met with in Northern Egypt. I give an<br/>
illustration of the scene, now unfortunately to a large<br/>
extent destroyed by the building of a light railway<br/>
along the bank. The village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salamiin</span>, which stands<br/>
in a commanding position at a bend of the stream, has<br/>
many points of interest. The village itself is of some<br/>
importance, and its tortuous and precipitous lanes<br/>
presented many pictorial features; the best view,<br/>
