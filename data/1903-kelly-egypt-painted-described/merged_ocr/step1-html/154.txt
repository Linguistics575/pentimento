<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
scenes not entirely different from those to which he<br/>
has been accustomed, yet with an added charm. The<br/>
open-air markets of the suburbs present the same types<br/>
and occupation as in town, but the horizon is wider,<br/>
the vista more extended, while the merely human<br/>
interest of the scene gradually assumes a lesser <span style="color: #0000FF;">importance </span>in subjects in which atmospheric effect plays<br/>
an important part.<br/>
<br/>
On the banks of the Nile he finds scenes which,<br/>
lacking the congested life of the streets, are still full<br/>
of movement and alive. Outside the walls among the<br/>
dust-heaps of Fostat, or the tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs</span>, are<br/>
views in which he finds the <span style="color: #0000FF;">great </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sity </span>for the first time<br/>
in repose, and enveloped in a soft light which sweetens<br/>
and dignifies dome and minaret and mass of building.<br/>
<br/>
Free from distracting noise and insistent detail, he<br/>
is beginning to understand the spirit of the scene.<br/>
<br/>
Each hour of the day, as the light changes, the same<br/>
subject varies infinitely in colour and effect, and leads<br/>
the mind to poetic treatment of the scene; and so<br/>
by slow degrees the student, industriously reproducing<br/>
what he sees, merges into the artist who, familiar with<br/>
all the facts before him, seeks to clothe them in some<br/>
beautiful idea, in which is embodied something of<br/>
himself and his new-born appreciation of the light of<br/>
heaven.<br/>
<br/>
Picturesque as the life of the cities is, nothing in<br/>
all Egypt is half so beautiful or difficult of attainment<br/>
as its wonderful skies. Egypt is essentially a <span style="color: #0000FF;">landscape<br/>
</span>country whose eternal flatness demands expansive <span style="color: #0000FF;">treat<br/>
