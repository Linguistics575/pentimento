<span>Streets and Bazaars<br/>
<br/>
whose rich carvings are partly hidden by the accumulated <span style="color: #ff0000;">d√©bris </span>of generations, lead into courtyards rich<br/>
in arabesques, and from which opens the "mandara,"<br/>
or guest-room, whose tesselated pavements and marble<br/>
fountains speak of the sumptuous life of former days.<br/>
The harim windows, which also look upon the court,<br/>
are rich with the fast-disappearing "<span style="color: #ff0000;">mashrubiyeh </span>"work<br/>
and perforated plaster lights. Carved corbels support<br/>
the ornate pillars and beams of ceilings still resplendent<br/>
with the rich painting and gilding which has to some<br/>

strangely with the sleeping-mats and ragged habiliments of the vagrants who now seek shelter here. It<br/>
is all very sad and pathetic; and one may ride for hours<br/>
through streets displaying all this picturesque incongruity, and which, so far as I can ascertain, are seldom<br/>
visited by tourists, and are practically unknown even to<br/>
residents in Cairo. Some of the details of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">buildings </span>are worthy of study. The street doorways are<br/>
often extremely richly carved in designs of great<br/>
variety, each stone being frequently separately treated,<br/>
and the whole of the ornamented portion framed by a<br/>
double string, or beading, which interlaces at intervals<br/>
and forms at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">imposes </span>a plaited design of great<br/>
beauty. The door itself is usually plain timber, heavily<br/>
studded with iron nails, and perhaps boasting a knocker<br/>
of rich design and material. The interior doors of the<br/>
houses are, however, richly panelled in a great variety of<br/>
