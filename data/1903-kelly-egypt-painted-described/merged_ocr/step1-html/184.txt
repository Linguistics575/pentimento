which is expected of the well-regulated tourist, and,<br/>
having paid <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>our guides in full, returned to our<br/>
carriage to enjoy a well-earned lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Presently we found that we were surrounded by a<br/>
crowd of hungry-looking natives, who began to clamour<br/>
for "backsheesh "in a manner which struck us as being<br/>
threatening. Not liking the appearance of things, we<br/>
ordered the driver to start for Cairo, and immediately a<br/>
combined attack upon the carriage began. Some tried to<br/>
hold the horse's head, but were kept off by the driver's<br/>
whip, while my friend and myself, standing up in the<br/>
carriage and each wielding a heavy oak stick, were<br/>
barely able to repel the assault of those who leapt<br/>
upon us as we galloped off. Every hand laid upon<br/>
the carriage, and every head within reach, felt the<br/>
weight of our blows until we were fairly on the highroad again, and almost clear of our assailants. A few<br/>
of the most irate followed us for a mile or more, and<br/>
a parting fusilade of stones concluded the episode.<br/>
This was before Mena House Hotel existed, or proper<br/>
regulations for the Pyramid traffic were formulated.<br/>
To-day the Arabs here are pretty well-behaved, and<br/>
authority is represented by several policemen who<br/>
constantly patrol the vicinity of the monuments as a<br/>
protection to travellers.<br/>
<br/>
To properly appreciate the Pyramids they must<br/>
be seen repeatedly, under all conditions, and from<br/>
many points. It is difficult to grasp their huge bulk,<br/>
which is perhaps best realised from a distance of a<br/>
mile or more. From the road <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cake </span>is I think<br/>
