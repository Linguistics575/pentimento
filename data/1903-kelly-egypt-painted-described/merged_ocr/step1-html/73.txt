<span>Cairo<br/>
<br/>
there are others in whose decorations appear archaic<br/>
representations of men and beasts, railways and steamboats. Here resides a "hadj," whose pilgrimage to<br/>
Mecca is considered sufficient dispensation from the<br/>
Prophet's prohibition, which forbids the picturing of<br/>
any form of animal life; and custom allows this record<br/>
of his journey. Colour forms a very important item<br/>
in their decoration, and I think the Egyptian displays a wonderful instinctive knowledge of harmony.<br/>
The various coloured habiliments of man or woman are<br/>
never out of keeping or in any way incongruous, and<br/>
often you will see blue and green or pink and red<br/>
together without jarring. But then the tone of each is<br/>
just and the proportions are accurate. Similarly, in the<br/>
painting and dressing of the shops great art is displayed,<br/>
and I particularly call to mind one shop which was<br/>
evidently and intentionally a scheme in red. The<br/>
wooden shutters were painted that particularly vivid<br/>
though rich red you get to know so well in Cairo, the<br/>
inside walls a lighter shade of the same, while the<br/>
owner's salmon-coloured "<span style="color: #ff0000;">khaftan</span>" and crimson sash<br/>
and slippers stood out in relief against the ruddy <span style="color: #0000FF;">brassware </span>he offered for sale. I may also mention another<br/>
point which has struck me, and that is the value of black<br/>
in their arrangements. Take a saddle with its cloths<br/>
and tassels: the pommel is always maroon or crimson<br/>
leather, and over the saddle is a cloth or saddle-bag of<br/>
varied pattern and colour, but generally light in key;<br/>
but the whole is given a grip and character by the fact<br/>
that the tassels are black, and it is this little point of<br/>
