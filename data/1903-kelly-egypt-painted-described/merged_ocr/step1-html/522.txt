Space will not permit of my attempting to describe<br/>
all the festivals of the Mohammedan faith, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muled-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es-Saleh</span>, or the picturesque "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Seyideh </span>Zeynab<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>which<br/>
most tourists see<span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>but I cannot leave this <span style="color: #ff0000;">su.bject<br/>
</span>without referring to the procession of the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahmal</span>"<br/>
or Holy Carpet, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>the most important of those<br/>
which occur during the time visitors are usually in the<br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
Always associated with the Mecca pilgrimage, the<br/>
origin of the ceremony would appear to be as follows.<br/>
In the year of the flight 670 (A.D. 1272) the Sultan<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">E2 </span>Zahir <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beybars </span>performed the pilgrimage to Mecca<br/>
in state, the journey being made on camel-back, and<br/>
beneath the shelter of the "Mahmal "or canopy used<br/>
as <span style="color: #ff0000;">aprotection </span>from the sun; and succeeding Sultans,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs</span>, and Khedives followed the same practice until<br/>
comparatively recently. The Khedives of Egypt have<br/>
now ceased to make the pilgrimage, but send the<br/>
"Mahmal "<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>an emblem of royalty, in which is placed<br/>
the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kisweh</span>," or Holy Carpet, made each year as a<br/>
covering for the Kaaba, or tomb, of the Prophet in<br/>
Mecca. On the arrival of the new one, the old carpet<br/>
is returned to Cairo with the pilgrims, and is then cut<br/>
up into small pieces which are afterwards sold as relics,<br/>
the proceeds being applied to the Moslem charities.<br/>
<br/>
The "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kisweh</span>" is made in Cairo at great expense,<br/>
and consists of eight pieces of black cloth made of silk<br/>
