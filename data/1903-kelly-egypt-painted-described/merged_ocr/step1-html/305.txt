English river. Here and there among the darker<br/>
foliage glisten the brilliantly green shoots of the mulberry tree just bursting into leaf.<br/>
<br/>
From time to time groups of heavily laden lateen<br/>
boats, laboriously crawling up-stream, lend the necessary<br/>
touch of Orientalism; while goatherds with their flocks,<br/>
or the occasional village-life on either side, give variety<br/>
to a scene whose main characteristic is placidity.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond everything else the reflections fascinate me.<br/>
Every form is repeated to perfection, and in colour<br/>
hardly less vivid than the object itself. As evening<br/>

while the silence may be felt! I have experienced<br/>
nothing in Upper Egypt quite so romantic as those<br/>

Daylight invites criticism, and one realises that the<br/>
villages are poor and devoid of many picturesque<br/>
features common in up-country hamlets, and, possibly<br/>

higher up. Water-wheels are often idle for want of<br/>
water, and the formerly great industry of water-borne<br/>
