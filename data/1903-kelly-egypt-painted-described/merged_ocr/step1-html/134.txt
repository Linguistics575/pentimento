<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
This rosette resolves itself into two, three, or more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">crane</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>superimposed, with an equal space between the<br/>
various arms, and the ends of these, instead of being<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">square</span>, form an obtuse angle, the lines of which are<br/>
extended, and by crossing and recrossing break up<br/>
the intervening spaces into a variety of mathematical<br/>
figures. Here again a possible influence of early<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Christian </span>forms upon a style of art so differentially<br/>
developed may perhaps be traced.<br/>
<br/>
In the painted ceilings, brass lamps, or inlaid <span style="color: #ff0000;">coffeetables </span>we find the same form of ornament, and in<br/>
many cases the lines are of a different material, and<br/>
raised above the intervening spaces, which are individually carved, giving the whole an extremely rich effect.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the furniture of the mosques has long ago<br/>
disappeared, except where, as in the stone pulpit of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Barkfik</span>, it has been built in as part of the structure.<br/>
<br/>
South Kensington Museum possesses several of these<br/>
panelled pulpits of wood, such as that of Kait Bey,<br/>
and Lagin's pulpit from Ibn Tulun, in addition to<br/>
many fine examples of panelled doors, copper and brass<br/>
drinking-vessels, candlesticks, etc.; and in the Cairo<br/>
Museum in the Hakim Mosque are many of the<br/>
exquisite lamps or chandeliers of perforated and chased<br/>
metal-work formerly hanging in the mosques, as well<br/>
as several finely wrought <span style="color: #0000FF;">cofree-tables</span>, and other specimens of the best art of the Saracens. Unfortunately,<br/>
many more beautiful pieces have been surreptitiously<br/>
removed and sold to dealers, and have passed into<br/>
the hands of private collectors.<br/>
