<span>The N ile<br/>
<br/>
The temple itself is half hidden among mud-heaps,<br/>
all that remains of the Roman buildings which once<br/>
surrounded it, and is probably the latest temple to be<br/>
built in Egypt, dating only two thousand years back.<br/>
It is in wonderful preservation, and the massive dignity<br/>
of its interior is very impressive, and in its architecture<br/>
and plan, as well as in its decoration by hieroglyphic<br/>
inscription, displays all the chief characteristics of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharaohnic </span>period.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile is a river of contrasts no less than of<br/>
harmonies. On one side, mud-banks and cultivation<br/>
are opposed to precipitous cliffs which on the other rise<br/>
abruptly from the water' s edge a thousand feet into the<br/>
air. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Every </span>geological <span style="color: #0000FF;">feature </span>IS plainly shown <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>their<br/>
perpendicular sides, the regular stratifications being<br/>
broken here and there by some earthquake "fault "or<br/>
a rock-hewn tomb. Close in to the rocks lie boats,<br/>
dwarfed into insignificance by the tremendous mass<br/>
above them, while the blue-clad quarrymen, toiling<br/>
laboriously, load them with their cargoes of dazzling<br/>
white. Eagles soar about the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cliff</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>and are lost to sight<br/>
before the top is reached, and along the narrow strip of<br/>
shingle-beach a small boy and his black flock of goats<br/>
scramble warily in search of pasture. The whole is<br/>
repeated in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-a </span>mass of shimmering, glittering<br/>
light which almost blinds the beholder.<br/>
<br/>
In mid-stream bustling steamers and quick-sailing<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">giassas </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>steer their course between lazily drifting<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">tibbin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>boats, while others again from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Guergeh </span>or<br/>
Sohag, heavily laden with a pyramid of water-pots, lie<br/>
