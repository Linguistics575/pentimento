<br/>
</span>always painted in gay tints, and the dark stripe now<br/>
so noticeable in the sails is quite a recent addition,<br/>
and certainly enhances their effect. Possibly this<br/>
exuberance is one of the results of increased prosperity,<br/>
due perhaps in some degree to the very factories we<br/>
are all so ready to abuse.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the towns and villages on the Upper<br/>
Nile are picturesque, and the white-washed houses<br/>
and tall minarets of Sohag, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Guergeh</span>, and Abu Tig<br/>
are pleasant features in the landscape. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assiiit </span>also,<br/>
the capital of Upper Egypt, is a large and in some<br/>
respects a handsome town, <span style="color: #0000FF;">splendidly </span>situated on a<br/>
bend of the river, well surrounded by trees and<br/>
gardens, and backed by the high cliffs of the Libyan<br/>
Desert, which here approach to within a short distance<br/>
of the river.<br/>
<br/>
Every mile of your journey has its own particular<br/>
interest. Here is a herd of buffaloes wallowing in<br/>
the river, and enjoying a brief respite from the scorching sun and irritating fly. They are good swimmers,<br/>
also, as I noticed the other day, when a small boy<br/>
brought his "<span style="color: #ff0000;">gamoos</span>" down to water. Instead of<br/>
returning to the controlling hand of the lad, the<br/>
buffalo struck off down-stream at a pace with which<br/>
the distracted youngster on the bank could not keep<br/>
up. What the end of the race was, I was not able<br/>
to ascertain.<br/>
<br/>
Then comes your first temple, Dendera; and the<br/>
excitement of your first excursion. The bank is<br/>
crowded by donkeys and their drivers, each proclaiming<br/>
