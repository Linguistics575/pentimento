authority, the thief was eventually caught and the calf<br/>
recovered. The nearest court, however, was at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mansiirah</span>, and its date of sitting rather distant, so the<br/>
intelligent "<span style="color: #0000FF;">marnEr</span>" l imprisoned not only the thief,<br/>
but the farmer, his family, and the calf, so as to have<br/>
them ready to hand when the case should be tried;<br/>
and then forgot all about them! It was many years<br/>

To-day it is different, and confidence in the absolute<br/>
impartiality of the law as now administered has induced<br/>

of a more serious nature will not be allowed to pass<br/>
unnoticed; and, in consequence, there is a swelling of<br/>
the statistics of the courts.<br/>

Though thinking that, at least in part, the recorded<br/>
increase in criminality may be accounted for in this way,<br/>
I am afraid that there can be no question that crime is<br/>
more prevalent than formerly; and until more widespread education has had time to work its cure, other<br/>
means must be adopted. We cannot make the people<br/>
Christians, and it may not be even desirable to do so,<br/>
but at any rate let us do all that is possible to keep them<br/>
good Mohammedans. Among other prohibitions of the<br/>
