is reached it is cut down to save the tax and make<br/>
room for a new one. The crop is almost entirely taken<br/>
up by European dealers, and even a few weeks after<br/>
harvest it is hardly possible to obtain a handful of dates<br/>
in a village which perhaps is entirely occupied in their<br/>
cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
Here again economy is the rule. Every leaf cut <span style="color: #0000FF;">off<br/>
</span>is dried, and later on made into baskets or the wicker<br/>
beds of the middle classes, while under the trees, if the<br/>
grove is not too dense, <span style="color: #ff0000;">bercime </span>and vegetables occupy<br/>
the intervening spaces.<br/>
<br/>
Then the corn harvest begins, in which female<br/>
labour is largely employed, numbers of women and<br/>
girls following the crop from village to village until<br/>
all is gathered. These labourers are usually paid in<br/>
grain, which can be readily exchanged for food or<br/>
lodging or the other necessaries of the moment, leaving<br/>
a margin in cash as the result of much hard bargaining<br/>
with the local dealers.<br/>
<br/>
The corn is generally plucked up by the roots, made<br/>
up into little sheaves, and carried to some vacant spot<br/>
in the vicinity to await its threshing. As soon as the<br/>
crop is off the field, flocks of sheep or goats are put<br/>
on to it to feed upon whatever stubble or gleanings<br/>
may remain, and behind them comes the ploughman,<br/>
preparing the ground for the next crop. These occupations are concurrent, and I have seen in the same<br/>
field every operation from ploughing to threshing<br/>
going on at the same moment, for no time must be<br/>
lost if the land is to give its best return.<br/>
