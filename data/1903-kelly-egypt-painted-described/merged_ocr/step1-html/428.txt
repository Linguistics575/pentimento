<br/>
</span>there can be no doubt that much of the increased<br/>
wealth of the people and country is due to the enormous development of irrigation-works which has been<br/>
going on for some years past.<br/>
<br/>
Every one, however, must work. While the father<br/>
is busy ploughing or sowing, the sons work at the<br/>
shadoof. The women, in the intervals of housework,<br/>
are also busy in the fields, while children of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tenderest </span>age watch the cattle tethered in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bercime<br/>
</span>or drive the patient buffalo at the water-wheel.<br/>
<br/>
While the corn is growing, other work is to be<br/>
done. The cotton-fields have to be weeded and vegetables planted. The first crop of <span style="color: #ff0000;">bercime</span>, enriched by<br/>
the manure of the cattle grazing upon it, is replaced<br/>
by a second heavier crop, which is cut and marketed<br/>
as fodder.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile the palm-trees want attention. Each tree must be separately climbed and pruned, the outer<br/>
branches being cut off, leaving only the central bunch<br/>
of leaves to protect the opening blossom. When ripe,<br/>
each female flower must be fertilised by male pollen,<br/>
for the farmer pays a tax on every fruiting tree and<br/>
will take no chances.<br/>
<br/>
Large areas are under date-cultivation, and although<br/>
requiring considerable attention it is a very profitable<br/>
crop. The tree begins to fruit at about three years<br/>
old, often when mature bearing four to eight cwt. of<br/>
fruit per tree. When cultivated, the date-palm is never<br/>
of great height like the wild ones we meet at intervals, but so soon as its limit of profitable production<br/>
