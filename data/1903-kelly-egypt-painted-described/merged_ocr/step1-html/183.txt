<span>The Environments of Cairo<br/>
<br/>
Of all the environs of Cairo, however, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pyramidfield </span>of Gizeh is the first to attract the visitor, and I<br/>
think it is the experience of most that it is only after<br/>
repeated visits that any real appreciation of Pyramid<br/>
or Sphinx is developed, and that their impressiveness<br/>
increases with continued familiarity. The first visit is<br/>
fatiguing; and so much is found to do, that emotion<br/>
succumbs to physical exhaustion. The ascent of the<br/>
Great Pyramid and the exploration of its interior<br/>
galleries and chambers are followed by the regulation<br/>
camel-ride to the Sphinx, and the inspection of the<br/>
tombs. This under a hot sun, and with the constant<br/>
irritation of importunate guides and curio-sellers, is<br/>
a big day's work, and the traveller is usually far too<br/>
tired after it all to have any sentimental regard for<br/>
monuments which have mainly impressed him on account<br/>
of their size, and in which he finds nothing whatever<br/>
of beauty.<br/>
<br/>
It is a pity that the intolerable nuisance of the<br/>
Pyramid "guide" could not be done away with.<br/>
Their persistence worries the new-comer, and even<br/>
residents who are well known to them hardly escape<br/>
their unsolicited attentions. Still, it is better than it<br/>
used to be. I well remember my first visit to them<br/>
in 1883, when, owing to the late campaign, tourists<br/>
were a very rare exception in Cairo that winter, and<br/>
the Pyramid Arabs were starving for "backsheesh."<br/>

A <span style="color: #0000FF;">friend </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">joined </span>me in the excursion, about which we<br/>
had made particular inquiries, and knew to a piastre<br/>
what payments had to be made. We did everything<br/>
