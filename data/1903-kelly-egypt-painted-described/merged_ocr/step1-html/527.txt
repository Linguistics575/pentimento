The ceremony is divided into two functions. The<br/>
first consists of the reception by the Khedive of the<br/>
portions of the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kisweh</span>," which are then carried through<br/>
the streets to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Husaneyn </span>Mosque, where they are<br/>
stitched together. A month later it is again blessed<br/>
by the Khedive, when, enclosed in the "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahmal</span>," it is<br/>
sent to Mecca with the pilgrims.<br/>
<br/>
This reception and despatch of the "Mahmal "is one<br/>
of the most picturesque of their many festivals, and its<br/>
procession through the narrow streets, escorted by<br/>
soldiers, and amid the enthusiasm of the Moslem crowd,<br/>
is very striking; as also is its return with the old<br/>
carpet, when, surrounded by its following of ragged<br/>
and dirty, but pre-eminently blessed, "hadjis," it is<br/>
met, away in the desert, by the proud and gratified<br/>
relatives of the pilgrims.<br/>
<br/>
Everything in connection with their religion has a<br/>
picture value. The mosques themselves with their<br/>
attendant worshippers, who conform to fixed rules as to<br/>
positions, etc., and the various incidents of their muleds,<br/>
<br/>
. give the artist great scope. It is necessary, however, that<br/>
<br/>
the painter should study and understand his subject if<br/>
he would avoid anachronisms. A picture by an eminent<br/>
foreign painter occurs to me, in which is depicted an<br/>
Arab in the act of prayer, and carrying in his belt an<br/>
armoury of pistols, knives, and swords. Beautiful as the<br/>
painting is, it <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>be an irritation to the Orientalist;<br/>
for the teaching of the Koran is distinct, and commands<br/>
