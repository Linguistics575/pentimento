a forgery. It transpired that the native had actually<br/>
melted five sovereigns, and cast the imitation in a<br/>

A short distance above Luxor is the village of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>. The landing-place is picturesque; whitewashed houses crown the bank, which is fringed by<br/>
a row of lebbek-trees. Under the trees sit several<br/>
public letter-writers, who, like the rest of the inhabitants,<br/>
proffer their services as guides. The temple, which lies<br/>
in the centre of and entirely beneath the town, is reached<br/>
by descending a flight of steps; but except for the fact<br/>
that being on a level with the capitals you are better<br/>
able to study their carvings and illuminations, there is<br/>
little of special interest in the small portion opened out.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Further </span>excavation would entail the demolition of much<br/>
of the best property of the village, and is not likely to<br/>
be attempted for a long time to come. Disappointing<br/>
though the temple is, the market-place is well worth<br/>
seeing, and many odd corners of its bazaar are quaintly<br/>
pictorial. A great feature of the place is its mosque,<br/>
built of coloured bricks, set in patterns, with tile<br/>
ornamentation of the doorway. The upper stages of<br/>
minaret are interesting in form, and finished in the<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>unusual, and the only one of the kind I have seen in<br/>
Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Edfu, which is soon reached, is a more important<br/>
item in your journey, its temple being the most<br/>
perfect in preservation, and in many respects the most<br/>
