<span>The First Cataract<br/>
<br/>
we would start for an all-day excursion to the Cataract,<br/>
or have a sailing match round Elephantine.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sari</span>, which was our general boathouse and my studio for the time-being, we soon passed<br/>
the lower gate, a narrow channel between Elephantine<br/>
and the bank, over which a ruined Roman fortress<br/>
mounted guard.<br/>
<br/>
All beyond was the Cataract basin, freely dotted with<br/>
islets, between which ran strong eddies or miniature<br/>
rapids which made sailing difficult. Sometimes these<br/>
little falls were a foot or more in height, and it required<br/>
considerable judgment in order to nurse your boat up<br/>
the back eddy, and then suddenly fill sail and "jerk"<br/>
her up the rapid; failure meant a long drift <span style="color: #0000FF;">downstream </span>before you could renew the attempt, and a<br/>
correspondingly great advantage to your most successful rival.<br/>
<br/>
These little islands, which are formed by a collection<br/>
of granite boulders filled in with silt, are very pretty,<br/>
and are usually well covered with shrubs and trees of<br/>
various kinds <span style="color: #0000FF;">r-charming </span>picnic-places when the failing<br/>
wind did not permit of sailing, and ideal sketching<br/>
stands, free from the flies and fleas and disconcerting<br/>
smells incidental to many others we have had to endure.<br/>
<br/>
Here you will often see men fishing with lines,<br/>
though personally I have never seen anything caught.<br/>
The Egyptians, however, love to idle in the sun, and this<br/>
pretence of fishing as an excuse for "<span style="color: #0000FF;">loafing</span>" finds<br/>
many sympathisers at home.<br/>
<br/>
The banks themselves are, on the Eastern side,<br/>
