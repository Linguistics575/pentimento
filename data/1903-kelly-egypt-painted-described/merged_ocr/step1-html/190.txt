<br/>
the prismatic tints. The huge bulk of the Pyramids<br/>
themselves, jagged-edged and weather-worn, are glorious<br/>
in a sunlight which reveals unexpected subtleties of<br/>
colour, while their brilliantly illumined sides contrast<br/>
sharply with the sky, which acquires a depth and<br/>
intensity of blue which is almost startling. A passing<br/>
cloud-shadow or occasional group of figures mark points<br/>
of distance which the clearness of the air conceals, and<br/>
give scale to monuments whose immensity is scarcely to<br/>
be comprehended.<br/>
<br/>
As a contrast to the imperishable nature of these<br/>
monuments, all that now remains of the once prosperous<br/>
city of Heliopolis is the single obelisk, standing in the<br/>
fields solitary and alone. Beyond are the palm-groves<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbet-en-Nahla </span>and Marg, a refreshing variation of<br/>
subject after so much sand and dust, and in which<br/>
the native life of the village and its picturesque cemetery are valuable incidents.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot close my review of Cairo and its neighbourhood without saying that with one exception, when, at<br/>
the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kafrah </span>below the Pyramids, a stone was<br/>
thrown at my picture, I have never while working experienced anything in the way of rudeness or molestation<br/>
at the hands of the native. On the other hand, their<br/>
kindness has often been great, as I have shown. Let<br/>
me add in conclusion two other instances of this.<br/>
<br/>
I have frequently been at work the whole day long<br/>
among the dusty tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs</span>, around which<br/>
are built the little houses of the quarrymen and labourers<br/>
from Cairo. Several times has one or other of these<br/>
