<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
who work with the greatest dexterity and speed,<br/>
the choice of colours and form of the pattern being<br/>
given by the master, who, working entirely from<br/>
memory, gives instructions to the boys by numbers<br/>
which determine the colour of the grass used, and the<br/>
number of threads of the warp to be taken up in <span style="color: #0000FF;">forming </span>the pattern.<br/>
<br/>
On leaving <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dekerniss</span>, a steam-launch which plies<br/>
between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mansiarah </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menzala </span>threw on board our<br/>
boat a bundle of letters, which recalls to my mind my<br/>
indebtedness to several of the Government departments<br/>
who have kindly undertaken to forward me my correspondence, a difficult task sometimes in the case of<br/>
any one leading a nomadic life. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>may give one <span style="color: #0000FF;">instance </span>which occurred a few years ago, when a letter<br/>
forwarded originally to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fakiis </span>had followed me from<br/>
point to point for some weeks, and was eventually<br/>
delivered to me by a camel-man as I was seated enjoying an al-fresco lunch under a palm-tree. The letter<br/>
proved to be nothing more than a dinner invitation<br/>
long since out of date, but I mention the incident as<br/>
an instance of the extreme kindness of officials and<br/>
natives in the matter.<br/>
<br/>
The navigable canals in Egypt are numerous. The<br/>
Bahr-el-Bukr (or river of bullocks) and the Bahr<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Moiise </span>(river of Moses) are large streams which, with<br/>
the Bahr <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fakas </span>water, form a highway for a great<br/>
portion of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sharkiyeh </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dekkalieh </span>provinces:<br/>
good streams of running water, which, though not<br/>
presenting the animated life of many other waterways<br/>
