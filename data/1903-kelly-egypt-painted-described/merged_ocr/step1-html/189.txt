<br/>
</span>The Environments of Cairo<br/>
<br/>
one of the best views, where desert and cornfields<br/>
sharply contrast, and the Pyramids, standing boldly<br/>
against the sky, are reflected in the pool which runs<br/>
alongside the avenue. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span>the desert also is a quaint<br/>
view of them, but nothing impresses so much as a quiet<br/>
walk round them in the cool silence of a moonlit night.<br/>
The Sphinx also, battered though it be by Mohammed<br/>
Ali's artillery, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whetrseen </span>in all the solemnity of night<br/>
is inexpressibly weird, and gives the beholder an <span style="color: #0000FF;">over-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">awing </span>sense of eternal dignity and calm. Sit down<br/>
and live with it hour by hour and night after night,<br/>
and you will learn that the Sphinx is no mere<br/>
monument of stone, but has a mysterious power of<br/>
impressing itself upon your soul, as, looking backward<br/>
through the ages, and into the dimness of the future,<br/>
this most ancient and most incomprehensible of all<br/>
Egypt's monuments forces upon you some slight<br/>
understanding of what is meant by time and eternity.<br/>
<br/>
It is rather curious that forms of such an uncompromising nature as the Pyramids should possess<br/>
any pictorial value whatever, yet the fact remains<br/>
that no objects in Egypt are so frequently painted, and<br/>
it will be acknowledged that usually the resultant<br/>
picture pleases. Many factors combine to produce<br/>
this result. The surrounding desert, broken here and<br/>
there by ruined mastaba or outjutting rock, sweeps<br/>
in beautiful intersecting curves, to which the angle of<br/>
the pyramid forms the necessary line of contradiction.<br/>
Varied in colour and texture, these sand-sweeps are<br/>
infinitely lovely, and in a subdued form display all<br/>
