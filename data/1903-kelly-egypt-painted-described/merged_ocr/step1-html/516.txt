</span>exhausted and insensible, only to be pulled out by the<br/>
leg by one or other of the excited crowd behind them,<br/>
who would take their place and continue the performance<br/>
as before.<br/>
<br/>
To-day, even the performance of the Howling<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Darwishes </span>in old Cairo, who provided such a regular<br/>
Friday's amusement for visitors, has been prohibited<br/>
by order of the Khedive, though <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Zikr" may<br/>
still be witnessed in conjunction with other festivals.<br/>
<br/>
Probably one of the most interesting of these events<br/>
is that last "fantasia" which ends Ramadan. This<br/>
takes place at night, in the Citadel Mosque of<br/>
Mohammed Ali, when, after the Khedive has performed<br/>
his devotions, the mosque is thrown open to all who<br/>
come. The huge interior is brilliantly illuminated by<br/>
innumerable lamps hanging from the roof and dome,<br/>
which can hardly be seen through the smoke of incense.<br/>
The floor is richly carpeted, and, with the varied<br/>
costume of the dense mass of people attending the<br/>
performance, combines a feast of colour and light,<br/>
as well as a curious study of physiognomies which<br/>
alternately express faith, incredulity, or amusement.<br/>
<br/>
All over its large floor-space are gathered little<br/>
groups of the devout, chanting to the accompaniment<br/>
of cod, <span style="color: #ff0000;">kemengeh</span>, or tabla. Interest mainly centres<br/>
in the large ring near the "kibleh," where fifty or<br/>
more Howling <span style="color: #ff0000;">Darwishes </span>perform. In this case they<br/>
are standing, and with each cry of "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Allah </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">V</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>bend<br/>
almost double from the waist, till their long locks<br/>
nearly touch the ground as they "salaam." This<br/>
