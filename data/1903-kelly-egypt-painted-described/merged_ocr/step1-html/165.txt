<span>The Environments of Cairo<br/>
<br/>
sphere, which softens all tints and brings them into<br/>
harmony with the eternal blue of the sky.<br/>
<br/>
Across the bridge at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh </span>the high mud-banks are<br/>
crowned by a grove of date-palms, below which a fleet<br/>
of boats lie in readiness for the opening of the bridge;<br/>
beyond rise the picturesque old houses of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biilak</span>, against<br/>
which the floating river-life stands out in bold relief.<br/>
<br/>
In the early morning before the sun has dissipated<br/>
the mists, how silvery it all is! and again at sunset look<br/>
back at Cairo and see how the last of the sunlight gilds<br/>
the Mokattam Hills, behind which the full moon rises,<br/>
pale in the warm sky. The city, half hidden by the<br/>
gardens of Rhoda, is but a suggestion in blue haze,<br/>
above which the Citadel and Mosque of Mohammed Ali<br/>
rise to catch a glint of the fading light. Below, the<br/>
river with its long-drawn reflections is already drowsily<br/>
asleep. Such are some of the pictures to be found<br/>
everywhere, whose interesting details are beautified by<br/>
the glory of some atmospheric effect.<br/>
<br/>
At Abbasiyeh and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Demerdache </span>are many subjects<br/>
for the painter, in which a new feature presents itself<br/>
in the uniforms of the soldiers, British or native,<br/>
stationed there. "Tommy <span style="color: #ff0000;">Atkins</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>is a good deal in<br/>
evidence in Cairo, and particularly here, and I must<br/>
pay him the tribute of saying that he is nearly always<br/>
well behaved. I have seldom seen a soldier drunk,<br/>
and in many ways he has had a good influence upon<br/>
the people. I was painting here some time ago close<br/>
to a house occupied by a native gentleman, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who<br/>
</span>volunteered the statement that formerly <span style="color: #ff0000;">Demerdache<br/>
