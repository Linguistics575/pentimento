<span>Streets and Bazaars<br/>
<br/>
frequent intervals was supplied with fresh coffee from<br/>
an adjoining caf√© kept by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moorsi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharth</span>. Neither<br/>
would accept any remuneration, and the only return I<br/>
was permitted to make was by painting a small portrait<br/>
of the jeweller, while even to this day I have the<br/>
greatest difficulty in inducing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moorsi </span>(whom I always<br/>
go to see) to accept payment for the coffee supplied.<br/>
<br/>
Another instance was when painting in the<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">GamalieC'l </span>This is a busy thoroughfare, and the<br/>
policeman on duty, seeing that I was disturbed, stopped<br/>
the entire traffic of the street, until I begged him to<br/>
allow it to pass as usual!<br/>
<br/>
To most people, however, the culminating interest<br/>
of Cairo lies in its mosques and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bazaars-the </span>former<br/>
rich in arabesques and decorative features, to which<br/>
I shall have occasion to refer in another chapter, and<br/>
the latter presenting many architectural charms, and<br/>
a phase of life as picturesque as that to be seen<br/>
outside.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan-el-Khalily </span>and its neighbour, the Persian<br/>
bazaar, are perhaps the most popular because best<br/>
known. Here are to be bought those costly<br/>
embroideries and Eastern rugs custom compels you<br/>
to take away from Cairo. Certainly the effect of the<br/>
carpet bazaar, whose soft grey light adds an additional<br/>
tenderness to the harmonious colour of its contents,<br/>
would lead any one to extravagance; while the refreshing coolness of the Persian bazaar tempts the tired<br/>
Sightseer to rest a while, only to fall a prey to the<br/>
