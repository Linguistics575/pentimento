</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">FEW </span>places in Egypt, or indeed elsewhere, have t<br/>
power of inspiring their visitors with such a <span style="color: #ff0000;">feeling </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0<br/>
</span>almost personal regard as Assuan. All who stay <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>enjoy to the full the period of their visit, and lea<br/>
it with sincere regret. There is little to do in t<br/>
"tourist" sense, yet every day has its own inter<br/>
Without feeling the necessity of "going out and <span style="color: #0000FF;">doi<br/>
</span>something," the visitor may live happily, perhaps lazily<br/>
all the time; and, after the hurry and fatigue of muc<br/>
dusty sightseeing, Assuan appears as a haven of re<br/>
in which nothing more is expected of you than to 1i<br/>
in the quiet enjoyment of the beauty it <span style="color: #ff0000;">undoubtedl<br/>
</span>possesses.<br/>
<br/>
No longer trailing at the heels of your dragom<br/>
and obediently regardful of the interesting facts h<br/>
mechanically describes, you are emancipated, free, an<br/>
once more restored to your lost individuality and self<br/>
respect.<br/>
<br/>
My first visit to Assuan was in 1894, when t<br/>
only accommodation the town afforded was the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ol<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>Grand Hotel, and the dismantled steamer Seti, moore<br/>
