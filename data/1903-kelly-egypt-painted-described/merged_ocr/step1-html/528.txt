that before engaging in prayer the Moslem must remove<br/>
any weapons he may be bearing and place them on the<br/>
ground pointing towards Mecca, just in front of the<br/>

obtained, and I cannot help thinking that, beyond all<br/>
else, the artist should be <span style="color: #0000FF;">truthful </span>in his work<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
