<span>The Desert and the Bedawin<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere is sunshine more brilliant, or the air purer and<br/>
more invigorating, while a thousand little things go to<br/>
make up the total of its charm.<br/>
<br/>
The moment the desert is struck a strange feeling<br/>
of exhilaration comes over horse and rider, and in the<br/>
crisp morning air both seem to experience the joy of<br/>
life and become impatient for a race.<br/>
<br/>
Holding in your horses for a moment, you give<br/>
them their heads, and with a bound they are off at that<br/>
tearing, plunging gallop peculiar to the desert-bred<br/>
stallion. The wind rushes, by you, tossing mane and<br/>
tassels, as with snorts of fierce enjoyment' the horse<br/>
inhales the breeze. Sand and pebbles fly from their<br/>
hoof-strokes, while the clumps of grey-green "mit<br/>
minan "bush or spiky "helga "are quickly left behind.<br/>
As you race along, the startled jerboa and desert hare<br/>
scatter to right and left before you, and the pelican or<br/>
vulture seek safety in rapid flight. Jackals crouch in<br/>
their lairs as you pass, and presently up start a pair<br/>
of black wolf and give object to the chase, and the<br/>
pace grows hotter till the hard-pressed animals reach<br/>
sanctuary in the rocks. It is a half-hour of intoxication<br/>
for man and beast, until, panting but excited, your<br/>
horses are with difficulty brought to a standstill.<br/>
<br/>
These "Arabs" get up a wonderful pace, and the<br/>
sensation is delightful. Their stoppage, however, is<br/>
abrupt, and should the rider be careless he and his steed<br/>
will part company!<br/>
<br/>
Dismounting to rest a while, you have time to notice<br/>
more particularly the desert growths which surround<br/>
