</span>Still, things are progressing in Egypt, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">among<br/>
</span>the highest classes at any rate broader views obtain.<br/>
Many of the upper classes have enjoyed university<br/>
education in Europe, and are more or less cosmopolitan<br/>
in their sympathies, while the freedom of intercourse<br/>
which now exists between the gentlemen of Egypt and<br/>
their European guests cannot fail in time to break<br/>
down what remains of racial and religious prejudice.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it is stated that crime is increasing<br/>
in the country, and poisoning cases are unfortunately<br/>
very frequent. In most instances I believe this particular crime is an act of vengeance by the brother upon<br/>
a sister who has gone astray, the girl usually being the<br/>
victim rather than her seducer; and I recently heard of<br/>
one extraordinary case where two shadoof-men, brothers,<br/>
walked all the way from Assuan to Suez and there<br/>
killed the sister who had disgraced her family, afterwards surrendering themselves to the Mudir and<br/>
stating <span style="color: #0000FF;">what </span>they had done. Of late years European<br/>
labour has been more freely introduced into the country,<br/>
and I cannot help thinking that this has not had a good<br/>
effect upon the morale of the people; but apart from<br/>
any consideration of this kind, is it not possible that this<br/>
increase in criminal record is more apparent than <span style="color: #0000FF;">real</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?<br/>
<br/>
</span>As I have previously suggested, an appeal to law<br/>
was not always wise, and the victim of assault or robbery<br/>
was often better advised in bearing his wrong in silence<br/>
than in taking any legal action for redress.<br/>
<br/>
Let me give an illustration. Near a village in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sharkiyeh </span>lived a farmer whose "fatted <span style="color: #ff0000;">calf </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>was stolen<br/>
