been attempted. The American and English Mission<br/>
Schools have done, and are doing, splendid work, and<br/>
the new Gordon College at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartrim </span>promises to be<br/>
completely successful; and, provided no attempt at<br/>
proselytising is made to arouse the suspicion of the<br/>
parents, such schools must result in a vast amount of<br/>
good to the race.<br/>
<br/>
Boys and girls should be equally educated, at any<br/>
rate so far as the middle grades; while those who<br/>
desire it should be enabled to advance to the highest<br/>
standard possible, irrespective of sex; and in the case<br/>
of the girls some tuition in domestic work and the<br/>
elements of hygiene is much to be desired. Private<br/>
philanthropy has done something in this direction, but<br/>
of course on a scale quite out of proportion to the<br/>
necessities of the case.<br/>
<br/>
If only in the village schools a complete knowledge<br/>
of their own Koran could be imparted, the beneficial<br/>
result would be great. Few of the people know anything more of their sacred writings than it suits the<br/>
Imam to teach them, and Ifeel sure that a thorough<br/>
knowledge of their own religion would go far to break<br/>
down that fanatical hatred of the Christian which so unfortunately exists. How many, for instance, even among<br/>
the relatively enlightened, are aware of Mohammed's<br/>
instruction that "after Moslems, of all persons Christians<br/>
are to be revered"? I suspect that this and kindred<br/>
teaching is of set purpose disregarded by the teachers,<br/>
who, instead, impart to their scholars such passages only<br/>
as are calculated to keep alive antagonism and hate.<br/>
