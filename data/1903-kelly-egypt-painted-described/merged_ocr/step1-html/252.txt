<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
is the origin, of the buttress of later architecture. This<br/>
form lends to the buildings a sense of strength and<br/>
solidity which is very impressive; and, as though to<br/>
counteract the effect of weight in their structure, almost<br/>
invariably you will find an impost inserted between the<br/>
capital and architrave which gives a touch of lightness<br/>
which is valuable. Where any procession of pylons or<br/>
gates occurs, it will be noticed that each successive <span style="color: #0000FF;">door</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>way is increasingly larger and more ornate, until the<br/>
magnificently enriched interior courts of the temple<br/>
itself are reached. Thus, those approaching the shrine<br/>
would experience an ever-growing feeling of wonder<br/>
and admiration; and on returning, the diminishing<br/>
proportions, aided by perspective, could not fail<br/>
to impress the beholder with a sense of distance and<br/>
immensity.<br/>
<br/>
Dignity and repose <span style="color: #ff0000;">characterise </span>all these monuments,<br/>
and whether it be the Sphinx at Gizeh, or a sculptured<br/>
Rameses at Thebes, each expresses the same idea of<br/>
omniscience and immutability, to which the everlasting<br/>
nature of pyramid or temple-building forms a fitting<br/>
complement. To my mind, the evident intention that<br/>
these monuments should last for ever suggests more<br/>
of the character of the builders than any written record.<br/>
The deeply inscribed hieroglyphics are often somewhat<br/>
boastful, and reveal far less of majesty than the massive<br/>
walls which bear them, and sculptures which attribute<br/>
to the king almost divine power are less real and<br/>
impressive than the pride which would not suffer their<br/>
bodies to decay.<br/>
