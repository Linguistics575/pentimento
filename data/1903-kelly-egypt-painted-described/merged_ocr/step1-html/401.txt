<span>Riding through the Land of Goshen<br/>
<br/>
The delay caused by this entertainment compelled<br/>
us to quit the canal-bank and make the best of a<br/>
straight course across the fields to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kahbrina</span>, where we<br/>
proposed to stay the night. The winding pathways<br/>
of the fields, however, render it easy to mistake your<br/>
way, and we were a little uncertain as to the direction<br/>
we should take. Presently meeting a boy herding goats,<br/>
we asked him were we right for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kahbiina</span>. "Yes, your<br/>
excellency," he replied, "and had we known you were<br/>
coming this way we would have had a road made<br/>
straight for you." This reply was made in all seriousness, and is a pretty instance of the graceful imagery<br/>
of the East, which permeates all classes of society, and<br/>
certainly, among the poor fellahin of Egypt, lends<br/>
poetry to lives which are otherwise largely those of<br/>
drudgery and toil.<br/>
<br/>
As we approach <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kahbiina </span>the country becomes <span style="color: #0000FF;">increasingly </span>beautiful, the groves of date-palms are more<br/>
frequent and larger in extent-indeed, in many parts<br/>
they become almost one continuous forest, through<br/>
which wind tortuous paths and channels of running<br/>
water. Between the rows of palms, <span style="color: #ff0000;">bercime </span>or<br/>
vegetables grow, and the occasional open stretches<br/>
through which we pass are bright with the blossom of<br/>
the bean-fields, whose fragrance scents the whole air.<br/>
<br/>
On nearing the village the pathway widens into a<br/>
broad beaten track of sandy soil, well shaded by the<br/>
surrounding palm-trees, and leading to the principal<br/>
entrance of the village, which lies in the middle of a<br/>
particularly dense grove. In such out-of-the-way<br/>
