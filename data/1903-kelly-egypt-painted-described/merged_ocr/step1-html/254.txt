</span>still excites wonder and admiration; and in astronomy,<br/>
letters, or art, Egypt was pre-eminent among the<br/>
nations, and counted among its sciences many which<br/>
have been lost to the world, or maybe are only now<br/>
being rediscovered. Surely among what is picturesque<br/>
in Egypt may be included the romance attaching to<br/>
this lost Atlantis of knowledge.<br/>

Reverting to Egypt of to-day, we find little interest<br/>
in Luxor itself, especially since the market, formerly in<br/>
the centre of the town, has been removed to a more<br/>
distant site enclosed in high iron railings, and roofed<br/>
where necessary with corrugated iron! All very<br/>
prosaic, but better for the people, and certainly adding<br/>
considerably to the comfort of the town itself.<br/>

they cause; country-people drive their produce-laden<br/>
beasts to the market; and in the fields youngsters tend<br/>
the tethered cattle or roaming flock, and shyly beg a<br/>
