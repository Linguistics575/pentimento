<br/>
</span>might be developed in quite a different direction. <span style="color: #0000FF;">T<br/>
</span>surrounding district of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghait-en-Nasaral </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">peculiarl<br/>
</span>fertile, and capable of enormous production of fruit <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>vegetables. Why are its natural advantages neglect<br/>
by the authorities? Fruit export alone might <span style="color: #0000FF;">become<br/>
</span>a profitable asset for the people and the Government<br/>
and the building of a light railway to Port Said, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">t </span>t<br/>
institution of a fleet of shallow-draught steamers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">wou </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>

</span>endless supply of fresh vegetables and farm-produce <span style="color: #0000FF;">f<br/>
</span>the provisioning of passing ships.<br/>
<br/>
All this could be done without any interference wit<br/>
existing trades or privileges, land already used for <span style="color: #0000FF;">t.<br/>
</span>purpose elsewhere being equally available for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">growth<br/>
</span>of cotton or other export commodities.<br/>
<br/>
What is wanted is Government help in the wa<br/>
suggested. Given their proper means of <span style="color: #ff0000;">communicit2<br/>
</span>tion, water in the river, their light railways, or steam<br/>
to Port Said, etc., and the sympathetic encourage<br/>
of the Government, a new era of prosperity would <span style="color: #0000FF;">ark<br/>
</span>for Damietta (and incidentally for Rosetta also) which<br/>
while relieving the necessities of a hard-working a<br/>
respectable population, would add materially to<br/>
revenue of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
