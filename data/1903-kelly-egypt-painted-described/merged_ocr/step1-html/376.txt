<span style="color: #ff0000;">Birket-el-kuriin</span>, my friend made a special journey<br/>
to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayiim</span>, and was successful in securing some<br/>
equally large specimens, which are now, I understand,<br/>
in the British Museum.<br/>

Canal scenery, however, has an interest of its own<br/>
quite apart from passing incident, and this is especially<br/>
so in the case of the smaller canals not open for<br/>
navigation. Pitch your tent upon the banks of one of<br/>
these, and enjoy its changing pictures. Undisturbed<br/>
by traffic, the banks support a wilder and more luxuriant<br/>
growth than in the larger streams, and water-lilies<br/>
and other aquatic plants float upon its placid surface.<br/>
In the early morning the thistles and wild-flowers<br/>
which fringe it are laden with the dew, which hangs<br/>
heavy upon the cobwebs which festoon them; every<br/>
leaf and blade of grass has its glittering point of light,<br/>
soon to be evaporated by the newly risen sun. The<br/>
water is a sheet of silver, over which a low mist hangs,<br/>
partially screening the wooded landscape beyond. All<br/>
nature is silent, and no sign of life is seen except where<br/>
the water-beetle sports, or a rising fish silently breaks<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">limpid </span>water with a streak of light.<br/>
<br/>
Presently insect-life awakes, and the chirrup of the<br/>
grasshopper and the drone of bees fill the air, now<br/>
warm in the sunshine. The morning breeze sends a<br/>
purple ripple down the stream, and the dew and the<br/>
mist have disappeared to form those tiny flecks of white<br/>
which float between the earth and the eternal blue ot<br/>
the sky above you. The distant lowing of cattle or the<br/>
bleat of sheep marks the beginning of another day of<br/>
