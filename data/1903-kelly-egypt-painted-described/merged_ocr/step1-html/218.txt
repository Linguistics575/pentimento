gradually growing in intensity, eventually illuminates<br/>
everything in a rosy light, almost as brilliant as the<br/>
sun itself, but more ethereal and mysterious. This<br/>
again gives place to the purple mistiness of night, or<br/>
the ghostly whiteness of the moonshine.<br/>
<br/>
Effects and scenes such as these constitute what<br/>
people come to see, and probably nowhere but in the<br/>
Nile valley is such a succession of wonders. Words<br/>
and pictures equally fail to describe adequately such<br/>
beauty; it must be seen to be fully appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Your journey, however, does not entirely consist of<br/>
nature-poems, such as I have attempted to describe.<br/>
The onward march of civilisation has left its impress<br/>
on the Nile, and the necessities of industrial development and the restless energy of commercial enterprise<br/>
make their influence felt here as elsewhere in Egypt.<br/>
Smoking steam-tup go spluttering by, towing behind<br/>
them groups of coal-laden barges bound for the<br/>
molasses-reeking sugar factories of Maghagha or<br/>

belched over the river. Steam turbines are replacing<br/>
the picturesque "<span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkia</span>," while stone embankment<br/>
or railway bridge go far to spoil reaches of the river<br/>
otherwise beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Still, these improvements are inevitable, and testify<br/>
to the material prosperity of the country, and after<br/>
all they are not sufficiently numerous to seriously<br/>
threaten the beauty of the river. On the other hand,<br/>
I notice that the boats have more colour about them<br/>
than formerly; their bows and rudders are nearly<br/>
