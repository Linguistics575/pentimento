<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tinguishes </span>him from his Egyptian neighbour is his<br/>
love for dumb animals. While the Egyptian is<br/>
instinctively cruel to beasts, the Bedawi loves his horse<br/>
or camel, and makes pets of his dogs. In their tents<br/>
are always a few of these desert greyhounds, and very<br/>
frequently a couple of tame gazelles; while among the<br/>
Arabs of the Libyan desert the "cheetah" or hunting leopard is trained for sport and is frequently a<br/>
domestic pet.<br/>
<br/>
The daily life of the Bedawin is quaintly pictorial<br/>
and vividly suggestive of Bible days.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a shepherd leading his piebald flock in search<br/>
of pasturage or water, and, with his long gun ready,<br/>
keeping a watchful guard against the sudden onslaught<br/>
of a wolf; or, as he walks he deftly spins yarn from<br/>
the wool torn from the fleeces of his charge by desert<br/>
thorn or scrub. Again, a party of Arabs are exercising<br/>
their horses or driving camels to the nearest well.<br/>
<br/>
Round about the tents domestic incident is in full<br/>
swing. Here is Hagar, black-eyed and handsome, playing with her firstborn son, who with childish hands spreads<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">doura </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>for the fowl and pigeons which flutter round<br/>
them; close beside them, sleepy-eyed but vigilant, a<br/>
rough-coated dog affectionately mounts guard upon the<br/>
pair. Black-robed women are working at the looms, or<br/>
are engaged in plaiting tassels for their lords' "hagin<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>1<br/>
<br/>
Others again grind flour at the hand-mill, or turn the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>The hagin or dromedary is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">racing </span>camel, <span style="color: #0000FF;">specially </span>bred for the purpose by<br/>
the Bedawin. A common error <span style="color: #0000FF;">suppose</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>two humps in the case of the dromedary<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>against the camel's one. All are camels, the two-humped species being the<br/>
Bactrian camel of the Asiatic <span style="color: #ff0000;">steppcs</span>.<br/>
