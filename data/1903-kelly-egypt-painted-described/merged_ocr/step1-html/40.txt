</span>Suddenly, as the journey proceeds, you realise that<br/>
you have left the desert and are surrounded by green<br/>
fields and foliage. This is the Land of Goshen, which<br/>
we will revisit later; and how beautiful it looks as in<br/>
quick succession village and "<span style="color: #ff0000;">esbeh</span>," <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>palm-grove<br/>
and corn-fields, succeed each other as the train rushes<br/>
on! How fresh is the green of the fields, and with<br/>
what seeming elation do the palms and bananas stretch<br/>

</span>The various phases of agricultural life present themselves in turn. Here is a "fellah" with his yoke of<br/>
oxen and wooden plough, or "fass" 2 in hand he is<br/>
making runnels for the water supplied by the primitive<br/>

wells. We will know all these people better presently.<br/>
Speed will only now permit of a quick impression of<br/>
Biblical picturesqueness and simplicity.<br/>
<br/>
Canals abound everywhere, and boats' sails constantly<br/>
appear among the growing crops, and frequently on<br/>
their banks you will notice circular spaces enclosed<br/>
by low mud-walls and carpeted with straw. These<br/>
are holy places where the faithful pray amidst their<br/>
work.<br/>
