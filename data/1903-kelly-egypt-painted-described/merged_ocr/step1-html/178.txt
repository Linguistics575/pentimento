<span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
The views from here are certainly splendid. To<br/>
the east lie Abbasiyeh's white buildings standing out<br/>
against the sea of foliage which stretches from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kiibbeh</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Zeitiin</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matariah </span>until it is lost in the blue<br/>
distance of Marg. Below you lies the city of Cairo,<br/>
whose extent has perhaps never before been fully<br/>
realised. Beyond it to the north spread indefinitely<br/>
corn and cotton-lands, through which the silver thread<br/>
of river winds towards the sea. To the. west and<br/>
south-west is the plateau of the Libyan desert impinging upon the cultivated land. Here are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pyramidfields </span>of Gizeh, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abiisir</span>, Sakkara, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahshiir</span>, and<br/>
even the distant <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mediin </span>Pyramid can be seen. Beyond<br/>
is the eternal desert, which finally merges into the Great<br/>
Sahara. I very much doubt if there is anywhere a<br/>
more impressive series of views than may be seen from<br/>
the Gama <span style="color: #ff0000;">Garichy</span>, and this year I witnessed from<br/>
it one of the weirdest effects I have ever seen in<br/>
Egypt. It was approaching sunset, when a sudden<br/>
dust-storm arose obscuring the view in all directions.<br/>
Below me was an abyss of yellow fog, which in spite<br/>
of the high wind appeared motionless; the sky was<br/>
obliterated, and the very ground I stood upon had<br/>
disappeared. Nothing <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>to be seen in any direction except the domes and minarets of the tombs<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memliiks</span>, which, without visible base, reared<br/>
their ghostly forms in mid-air. Behind them was a<br/>
luminous veil focussing in a central point of sickly<br/>
whiteness, which represented all that could be seen of<br/>
the setting sun.<br/>
