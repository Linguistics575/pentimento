patterns. Each panel is built up of separate pieces of<br/>
wood, which allow of a certain amount of "play," the<br/>
separate pieces being easily moved by the finger. The<br/>
same principle is applied to "<span style="color: #ff0000;">mashrubiyeh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>work, this<br/>
freedom in the joints protecting the whole from possible<br/>
destruction due to warping and the buckling caused by<br/>
varying temperature and humidity.<br/>
<br/>
The perforated plaster windows which often form<br/>
the upper lights in a "<span style="color: #ff0000;">mashrubiyeh</span>," and are to be<br/>
found in most of the mosques, have one ingenious<br/>
feature. The design is usually of a floral nature, and<br/>
is cut in the slab of plaster, the lower edge of<br/>
each perforation being at an angle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>degrees, so<br/>
that when seen from below no intervening material<br/>
interferes with the effect of the pattern. As these<br/>
windows are almost always placed high in the walls,<br/>
the effect of their delicate tracery, in which is set<br/>
coloured glass, tells very brilliantly through the gloom.<br/>
A great amount of judgment is also displayed in the<br/>
decoration of their ceilings, which are usually one or<br/>
other of two kinds. One is a rich canopy of hammer<br/>
beams, frequently carved at the edges and illuminated<br/>
in gold and colours, the intervening spaces consisting<br/>
of flat boarding similarly decorated. The other is of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">applique</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>work, or thin strips of wood nailed upon the<br/>
boarding so as to form a geometric design of a very<br/>
intricate character. These strips are usually gilded,<br/>
and the interstices painted blue, green, and red. The<br/>
whole effect is rich in the extreme, and the colours<br/>
employed are of great purity and brilliance, so as to<br/>
