<br/>
reality the span is a built structure, the several stones<br/>
of which are cut into these curious patterns and slid<br/>
into each other, thus locking together on the principle<br/>
of the keyed arch. Across the entrance is a low<br/>
wooden railing or barrier, which marks the boundary<br/>
of the mosque. No one may cross this barrier shod, for<br/>
beyond is holy ground. Some exteriors are decorated<br/>
with friezes of inscribed stonework, as in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalaiin</span>,<br/>
whose broad Arabic inscription forms a very striking<br/>
feature in its decoration. This application of ornamental<br/>
writing to decorative purposes is very valuable, and is to<br/>
be found about the doorways of most mosques; and<br/>
though Arabic or the earlier Cufic characters lend themselves more easily to decorative treatment, I often think<br/>
that even European architects might make more use of<br/>
lettering in their decoration, thus serving the double<br/>
purpose of ornament and information. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">should </span>mention<br/>
that the alternate red and white stripes on the outer walls<br/>
are not always part of the original scheme, but in many<br/>
cases have their origin in the fact that, when carrying out<br/>
the illuminations ordered to celebrate Mohammed Ali's<br/>
Syrian conquests, it was found very difficult to adequately<br/>
treat the vast expanse of wall presented by the mosques<br/>
of the city, and consequently the distemper colouring of<br/>
the alternate courses was resorted to as a substitute for<br/>
other forms of decoration. This colouration was almost<br/>
invariably in red and yellow, and the darker banding of<br/>
black and green found in so many buildings may be<br/>
taken as being part of the original design.<br/>
<br/>
It is not only as architecture that these buildings<br/>
