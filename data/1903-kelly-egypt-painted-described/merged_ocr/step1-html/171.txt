<span>The Environments of Cairo<br/>
<br/>
When working in these outlying districts, the artist<br/>
is as a rule free from the ordinary disturbances of the<br/>
city. Heat, glare, and thirst, however, often supply<br/>
the place of other irritations; indeed, one might almost<br/>
say that, except in the early morning or twilight, the<br/>
artist has always got something to put up with. In<br/>
painting in the open the glare and heat are often very<br/>
trying, but I am convinced that the use of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sketchingumbrella </span>is fatal to colour. The painter is then seated<br/>
in a little purple island of shadow surrounded by a sea<br/>
of yellow light, conditions under which it appears to<br/>
me to be impossible to determine the value of the<br/>
pigment you are using. I have always found it best<br/>
to dispense with artificial shade, and, should the glare<br/>
prove insupportable, a little green paint or charcoal<br/>
rubbed on the under eyelid gives immense relief.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes accidents such as a sudden swirl of dust<br/>
do grievous damage to your work, and at times physical<br/>
discomfort overtakes you in other ways. Let me give<br/>
an instance. I had selected a subject several miles out<br/>
in the desert from Tiira, and for lack of other means<br/>
I reached the place on mule-back and my servant on a<br/>
donkey, neither beast having either saddle or bridle, and,<br/>
as I had gone out for the day, a heavy lunch-basket was<br/>
added to the other impediments After working all day,<br/>
at sunset I prepared to return, and, putting my boy on the<br/>
mule, loaded him up with as much of my baggage as he<br/>
could well manage. Just as I was mounting my steed,<br/>
I heard a shout <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>my servant, and turned round<br/>
in time to see him spread-eagled in the air, the baggage<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>65<br/>
