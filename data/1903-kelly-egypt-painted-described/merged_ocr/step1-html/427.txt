</span>The Life of the "Fellah"<br/>
<br/>
The soil is wonderfully fertile, and the extent of its<br/>
productiveness depends largely upon the regular and<br/>
sufficient distribution of irrigating water, in which work<br/>
much of the labour of the field is employed. The<br/>
annual overflow of the Nile reaches a very small proportion of the whole land, which is therefore fed by a<br/>
system of large canals which carry the fertilising fluid<br/>
to every corner of the Delta. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span>these larger canals<br/>
(which also form useful highways) branch lesser ones,<br/>
intersecting the country in all directions, and from<br/>
which each estate or farm draws its supply. This supply<br/>
is regulated by Government, the canals being filled in<br/>
rotation, and the farmer allowed so many shadoofs<br/>
or <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakkias </span>according to his acreage; and, in the case<br/>
of the steam-pump, the water raised is authorised up<br/>
to a certain number of gallons per day or per week,<br/>
and is measured by meter.<br/>
<br/>
The fields are nearly always divided into little<br/>
squares formed by a low ridge of mud; and the water<br/>
being brought from the pumps by a shallow channel<br/>
formed in the same way, all that is required is to break<br/>
down the wall with a "fass" (or hoe), or even with<br/>
the foot, and so allow the water to flood whichever<br/>
portion of the field requires it. When <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>has<br/>
been given to one square, the channel is closed by a<br/>
clod of earth and the water diverted into another part<br/>
of the field.<br/>
<br/>
Conditions in Egypt are favourable to crop-raising,<br/>
and, given an adequate water-supply, success depends<br/>
almost entirely upon the efforts of the farmer; and<br/>
