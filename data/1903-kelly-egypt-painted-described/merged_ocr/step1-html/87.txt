Latterly there has been an almost universal abandonment of their distinctive and picturesque garb by the<br/>
younger generation of the well-born, who now dress<br/>
in the same manner as European gentlemen. This<br/>
perhaps is natural and not to be surprised at when<br/>
such intimate social relationships exist between the<br/>

These dresses are distinctive according to the position<br/>
of the wearer. Ladies of the upper classes when out of<br/>
