</span>in conversation I learned that he had recently sold<br/>
land at <span style="color: #0000FF;">£28 </span>per "feddan," <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>which a few years previously had only cost <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>f to £6. The land, however, was<br/>

of life on the Lower Nile is great, and in no part of<br/>
the country have I seen so much variety of colour in<br/>
the costumes, the brilliance of which may perhaps be an<br/>
unconscious set-off against the greyness of their lives.<br/>
