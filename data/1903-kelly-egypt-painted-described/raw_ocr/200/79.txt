Cairo

As buildings increased in size and architectural
embellishment, these lattices gradually became enlarged
and decorated, first by the notching of the Iaths, but
eventually developed into the roomy balconies of fine
trellis-work which are such a feature of Cairo street
architecture, and from behind which the ladies of the
harim could, unobserved, enjoy the air and see all that
occurred in the street below them. Most of these
windows have still the little projecting niche which
forms the mashrubiyeh proper.

Unfortunately, this work lends itself so readily to
the making of screens and ornamental furniture, that
the demands of dealers and tourists have practically
stripped Cairo of one of its most characteristic
features, and, owing to danger of spreading fire, the
Government will no longer allow it to be reinserted.
Many streets, such as Sharia Gamamis, Bab-el-Wazir,
and the Siigarieh, which were a few years ago the
richest in Cairo, have now practically no example
left of this interesting and beautiful work, and year
after year witnesses the slow but certain disappearance
of other equally characteristic features.

Modern necessity must inevitably clash with
mediaeval quaintness, and to-day the historic streets
of the early Moslems resound to the clanging bells
of electric cars. The picturesque Bab-esh-Sharieh,
one of the eastern gates of Cairo, has been demolished
to allow of road improvements ; and many streets, such
as the Muski, have during the last few years lost
much of their Eastern character.
