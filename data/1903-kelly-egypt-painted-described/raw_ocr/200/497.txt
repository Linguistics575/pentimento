The Desert and the Bedawin

While a guest of the Sheykh Mansour Abn Nasr-
ullah, chief of the Nefaarta Arabs, I had an opportunity
of hearing one of these songs, which merits some
description. We were seated in the Sheykh's tent, all
the headmen of the tribe being present to enjoy this
narration of the prowess of their ancestors.

The bard was an old man, grey-bearded and
withered, and was accompanied by his son, who would
succeed him. Each carried a two-stringed instrument
which is played with a bow, called the "kemengeh";
and having by many preliminaries worked his audience
up to the proper pitch of excited anticipation, the bard
began the " Song of the Nefaarta."

Introduced by a weird accompaniment on the
" kemengeh," to which the boy played a kind of second,
it commenced like the sighing of the wind in the trees,
or the sound of its sweep across the desert when the
sand blows gently through the thorns. Gathering
volume by degrees, and with an infinite variation of its
opening theme, a gradual crescendo led up to the com-
mencement of the song itself.

Going back for generations, the legend described the
growing of the parent tribe into a power in Mesopo-
tamia; how later, when camels and horses and doughty
warriors were numerous, they decided upon the con-
quest of Tunis. Every varying mood was emphasised
by the accompaniment, and one seemed to hear the
hurried riding of messengers sent to summon distant
families, till the sound of their horses' hoof-strokes was
lost in the desert wind.
