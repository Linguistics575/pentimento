Egypt

It seems to me, however, that the position is not
without its dangers. Of late years irrigation has been
largely developed, and, in addition to reclaiming land
that was formerly waste, has added considerably to the
value of that already under cultivation. The small
investor, hitherto perhaps simply a farm-labourer,
will naturally, when possible, buy the relatively cheap
new lands, which offer to him the greatest promise of
return, and thus withdraw a certain amount of labour
from land on which more regular and continuous
irrigation renders increased rather than diminished
labour necessary. As I have said before, the native
is the best farmer for Egypt, and, so far, his place as
an agriculturalist has never been satisfactorily filled by
another.

The completion of the New Nile Dams at Assuan,
Assirit, etc., must soon bring this question prominently
forward ; and, so far asl can see, it resolves itself into a
question of papulatim. Increased acreage and fertility
will shortly overtake the supply of available labour, a
shortage which the normal increase in population is
totally inadequate to supply ; and though no doubt the
prosperous condition of the country will induce a large
number of immigrants to settle, this will hardly of itself
solve the problem.

The yearly increase in purely native population is
infinitesimal, due in large measure to the excessive rate
of infant mortality, which I am told reaches the appal-
ling figure of 90 per cent!

This extraordinary scale of mortality is no doubt
