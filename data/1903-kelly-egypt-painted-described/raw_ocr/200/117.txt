Streets and Bazaars

shine through the gloom of the lofty interiors. I have
also noticed that instead of mixing pigments into greens
or purples, etc., the effect of these colours is sometimes
produced by painting the whole surface blue, through
which run thin lines, or series of small spots, of yellow
or red, as the case may be, and the eye from a distance
blends the whole into the desired hue.

Whether in their stone-carving, pavements, wood-
work, or decoration, these people were certainly great
artists; and the painter, in the intervals of work, may
learn much from a study of such examples of each as
are still left in Cairo.

The question naturally arises, Where are the best
examples to be found? Any good dragoman or in-
telligent donkey-boy will be able to show the inquirer
several houses such as I have mentioned, where still
remains, though more or less dilapidated, practically
all of its original splendour of decoration. The pave-
ments and tilework perhaps will be broken, but
sufficient remains to give a very complete idea of the
whole. The ceilings and domed centre-lights are
generally fairly perfect, the "mashrubiyeh" work
perhaps having suffered most of all. In some rooms
the panelled "dulab," or wall-cupboard, reveals secret
passages and hiding-places, suggestive of the romantic
intrigues they were designed to cover, and to which
the quotations from the Koran and religious proverbs
with which frieze and windows are enriched form a
standing reproof.
