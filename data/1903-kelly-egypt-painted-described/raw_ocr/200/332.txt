Egypt

their goods from house to house, while the women
making their purchases, or washing and drying clothes
on their little stagings, give quite a Venetian aspect to
this river-front.

F requently from upper windows water is hauled up
by means of a rope and bucket, a pulley being fixed
for this purpose. Every house has its little stone stair-
way leading into the water, and these are often covered
with a wooden hood so as to enable the ladies to bathe
in privacy. Everything suggests an amphibious life;
and the river here being of great depth, vessels of large
tonnage are able to enter the port and discharge or
receive their cargoes safely.

Rain is frequent and heavy on the coast; and in
place of the sun-dried bricks of Upper Egypt it is
necessary here to use burnt brick, the vivid red of
which showing through broken plaster lends an
additional touch of colour to the buildings, and adds
considerably to the general charm of the place. The
principal streets are for the same reason flagged with,
stone, and in consequence very much cleaner than any
others I have seen in Egypt. Inside the town are
many fine buildings, baths, mosques, and the palaces of
former grandees. The main street has many good
shops, and evidently retains a large trade, while some
of the "odd corners" are most quaint and pictorial,
and though different in character are as picturesque as
anything in Cairo.

Two features of domestic architecture struck me.
