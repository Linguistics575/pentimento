Egypt

reality the span is a built structure, the several stones
of which are cut into these curious patterns and slid
into each other, thus locking together on the principle
of the keyed arch. Across the entrance is a low
wooden railing or barrier, which marks the boundary
of the mosque. No one may cross this barrier shod, for
beyond is holy ground. Some exteriors are decorated
with friezes of inscribed stonework, as in Kalarin,
whose broad Arabic inscription forms a very striking
feature in its decoration. This application of ornamental
writing to decorative purposes is very valuable, and is to
be found about the doorways of most mosques; and
though Arabic or the earlier Cufic characters lend them-
selves more easily to decorative treatment, I often think
that even European architects might make more use of
lettering in their decoration, thus serving the double
purpose of ornament and information. I should mention
that the alternate red and white stripes on the outer walls
are not always part of the original scheme, but in many
cases have their origin in the fact that, when carrying out
the illuminations ordered to celebrate Mohammed Ali's
Syrian conquests, it was found very difficult to adequately
treat the vast expanse of wall presented by the mosques
of the city, and consequently the distemper colouring of
the alternate courses was resorted to as a substitute for
other forms of decoration. This colouration was almost
invariably in red and yellow, and the darker banding of
black and green found in so many buildings may be
taken as being part of the original design.

It is not only as architecture that these buildings
