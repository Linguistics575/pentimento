Riding through the Land of Goshen

for me more than one admiring friend. To return to
the dinner, here is the "menu" provided on this
occasion, each course being served separately:

1. Soup, rather greasy, to which was added a bowl
of" semna" (or clarified butter), the whole
very oily, but rendered more palatable by the
juice of several lemons squeezed into it.

Salads.

Baked turkey, stuffed with rice and nuts.

Spinach and oil.

Haricot beans.

Boiled beef.

Chops.

Sheep's brains.

A dish called " maWf," consisting of rolled vine,
leaves containing minced meat and spices tied
round with the tendril and stewed with oil.

IO. Mutton hash.

I 1. F ried potatoes.

12. A pudding made of fine flour, honey, and oil.

and it was a little disconcerting to be suddenly con-
fronted with-

13. Sausages.

14. Stuffed tomatoes.

I s. Boiled mutton.

16. More fried potatoes.

I7. '' Mish-mish " (stewed apricots).
