Egypt

tinguishes him from his Egyptian neighbour is his
love for dumb animals. While the Egyptian is
instinctively cruel to beasts, the Bedawi loves his horse
or camel, and makes pets of his dogs. In their tents
are always a few of these desert greyhounds, and very
frequently a couple of tame gazelles ; while among the
Arabs of the Libyan desert the "cheetah" or hunt-
ing leopard is trained for sport and is frequently a
domestic pet.

The daily life of the Bedawin is quaintly pictorial
and vividly suggestive of Bible days.

Here is a shepherd leading his piebald flock in search
of pasturage or water, and, with his long gun ready,
keeping a watchful guard against the sudden onslaught
of a wolf ; or, as he walks he deftly spins yarn from
the wool torn from the fleeces of his charge by desert
thorn or scrub. Again, a party of Arabs are exercising
their horses or driving camels to the nearest well.

Round about the tents domestic incident is in full
swing. Here is Hagar, black-eyed and handsome, play-
ing with her firstborn son,who with childish hands spreads

them; close beside them, sleepy-eyed but vigilant, a
rough-coated dog affectionately mounts guard upon the
pair. Black-robed women are working at the looms, or
are engaged in plaiting tassels for their lords' " hagin." 1

Others again grind flour at the hand-mill, or turn the

l The hagin or dromedary is the rating camel, specialty bred for the purpose by
the Bedawin. A common error suppose: two humps in the case of the dromedary
" against the camelâ€˜s one. All are camels, the two-humped species being the
Bactrian camel of the Asiatic steppel.
