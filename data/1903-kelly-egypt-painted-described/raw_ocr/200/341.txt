CANAL LIFE IN THE DELTA

LITTLE as the Nile below Cairo is known to visitors,
still less are the majority acquainted with that vast
network of irrigating canals which intersect the country
in all directions. In sightseeing as in picture-making
the " point of view " is everything ; and many of these
canals being navigable, a trip by water through the
Delta is one which may be made in comfort, and affords
scenes and incidents which differ essentially from those
presented to a traveller on horseback on the higher level
of the canal bank.

On the eastern side of the Delta these canals finally
empty themselves into Lake Menzala, an inland sea,
stretching from Port Said to Damietta, and in itself
well worthy of a visit.

a country of extreme fertility brings you to Ghait-en-
