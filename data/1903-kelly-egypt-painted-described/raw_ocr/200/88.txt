doors wear above their other garments the "hubarah,"
or large shawl of black silk, which envelops the whole
person, and, falling in picturesque folds about the

being of muslin, is made of a kind of coarse crape,
ornamented at the edge with emb.roidery or gold beads,
while over the nose is worn a curious ornament of brass
or gold, Which IS the distinctive mark of the married
state. Unmarried girls of the lower classes seldom veil,
and Coptic women, and those living in the country,
frequently dispense with it altogether. Though plainly

indoor costumes of the women are always gay, and,
according to their means, of rich material. A good
deal of jewellery is worn, and in most cases the nails
and finger-tips and palms of the hands are tinted
red with "henna," while among the lower classes
