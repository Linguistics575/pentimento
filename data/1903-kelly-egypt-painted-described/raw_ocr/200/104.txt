Egypt

Ali is one long sequence of animated pictures, in which
appear types of almost every Oriental race. Moors
from Fez, Algerines and Tunisians from the western
states, and from the East, Syrians, Persians, and traders
from Cashmere-all are to be found among its teeming
population, each by costume and facial characteristics
readily distinguishable from their Egyptian fellows.

Various incidents of greater or less importance
attract attention. See how majestically the women walk,
carrying on their heads the quaintly shaped '' balass," l
or, cross-legged on the shoulder, the few weeks old
infant which clings tightly to its mother's head-dress.
How strangely also trivial facts occasionally strike the
onlooker! I well remember my momentary sense of
astonishment when for the first time I heard a native
infant cry. It was so entirely like one of our own,
that I felt quite a glow of sympathy and kinship.
Notice also the kindness shown to the blind or crippled
by the passers-by ; or you may see a native sharing his
frugal meal with the mangy and half-starved dog he
would be defiled by touching.

Here and there, let into the walls, are large slabs
of stone, frequently richly inscribed, from which pro-
ject one or more nozzles or spouts. These lead to a
Water-tank within, and by sucking the wayfarer is
able to quench his thirst. See those two little mites,
hot and tired by their playing, vainly endeavouring to
reach the fountain so far beyond them. Presently one
atom, clasping the other round the knees, succeeds in

' The usual twnâ€˜hnndled water-pot.
