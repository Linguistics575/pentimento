The Environments of Cairo

When working in these outlying districts, the artist
is as a rule free from the ordinary disturbances of the
city. Heat, glare, and thirst, however, often supply

could well manage. Just as I was mounting my steed,
I heard a shout from my servant, and turned round
in time to see him spread-eagled in the air, the baggage
