The Desert and the Bedawin

My horse was terrified or stupid and refused to
move, so, dismounting, I attempted to lead him by the
head. Still he would not go, and I decided to remount.
In doing so, I vaulted right over him, and fell upon
the off side, so distorted was my sense of proportion.
When I eventually found the rest of the party, they
appeared to be miles away, though tht size of giants,
and the illusion only ceased upon my coming close
alongside them. I have been in many desert storms,
but this was the only occasion upon which such a
sequence of strange phenomena and delusions occurred,
probably due to extreme fatigue.

In contrast to such experiences, how peaceful are
the nights in the desert! The air is cold and clear, and
the stars appear unusually large and close upon you,
while the silence is as though Nature held her breath I

The social relationships of the Bedawin are simple.
Each tribe is governed by its sheykh, the " father" of
the family, whose expressed wish is sufficient to ensure
the carrying out of any plan, or to prohibit any action
of which he disapproves ; and it is very charming to see
the deference and respect with which the "patriarch"
is regarded by his sons and tribesmen.

Their etiquette also should be scrupulously respected
by the stranger if he would avoid friction. I have
known of cases where some ignorant omission, or com-
mission, on the part of a guest could only be taken as
an insulting disregard of their feelings and traditions.
No one, for instance, should refuse the " tit-bit tt offered
by his host at meals, nor should he approach a tent
