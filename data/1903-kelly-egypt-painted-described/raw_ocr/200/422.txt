machinery, and directed by the best intelligence, abso-
lutely fail to make the land support them. No doubt
the knowledge would come in time ; but as matters are,
none but the " fellah ?' seems able to coax from the soil
its best and richest return.

Though conservative in their methods, they are in
some ways adaptable, and steam turbines are recog-
nised as better means of irrigation than the sakkia or
shadoof. The old hand-mill has almost entirely dis-
appeared in favour of the steam-engine, and only lack
of capital, in the case of the small farmers, serves to
perpetuate many other picturesque accessories to their
labour which will eventually succumb to modern im-
provements.

As a rule, all the field operations are picturesque.
Ploughing is carried on with the traditional yoke of
oxen, though occasionally you may see a camel harnessed
with an ox or donkey, or even all three together
yoked to the same plough. The plough itself is a very
simple implement of wood, with its point iron-shod,
Deep ploughing is not required, and the wooden
plough of Egypt does little more than scratch the soil,
breaking the surface into rough clods, among which
the seed is sown. These clods are seldom broken by
harrowing, for if the surface were mo smooth, the sun
would "cake '' the land after irrigation, and so smother
the seed. There is an implement used, however, rather
like a barrow without a wheel, which is dragged over
the ploughed land, partially breaking the lumps and
covering up the newly sown seed.
