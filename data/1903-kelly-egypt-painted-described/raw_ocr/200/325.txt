The Lower Nile

fortunately, during this present spring 1000 houses and
200 shops of the old town have been destroyed by fire,
and I fear that my opportunity is lost.

Without attempting any detailed description of the
many days spent on this journey, I was specially
charmed with the old town of Samarisd, whose fine
bazaar facing the river is, I believe, the oldest existing
in Egypt ; though, alas ! the trade which formerly
created it has failed to preserve it in its pristine
dignity and prosperity.

Faraskiir is another charming scene from the river,
but without any special internal feature on exploration ;
and of another type is the little village of Shinbab,
whose tomb-mosque and tree-shaded huts looked very
picturesque in the early evening light.

In pure landscape the Lower Nile is very rich, and
the populace is deferentially agreeable. Whenever I had
occasion to leave the steamer I was treated with the
utmost respect, and was never asked for a " backsheesh"
excepting once, when a small mite proffered the request,
only to be soundly rated for her rudeness by her elder
sister.

In some respects I found these people to be much
like the Irish peasantry in their simple politeness to a
stranger. How often in Ireland, for instance, will an
artist while sketching be saluted by the passer-by with
" God bless your work, sir ! " So here I was frequently
"salaamed " by a native who would ask-

" Does your work prosper P‚Äù

"Thanks be to Allah," I would reply.
