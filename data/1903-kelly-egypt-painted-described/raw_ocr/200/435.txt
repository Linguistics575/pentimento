 

The Life of the " Fellah"

copious irrigation, be quickly brought under cultivation,
and, in the course of three or four years, be productive
of two or even three crops per annum. Everything
depends upon his own industry, and with free water
and proper application the fellah is able to live with
some degree of comfort upon a holding of eight to ten
feddans of land. '

If any proof were wanting as to the prosperity and
security of tenure now enjoyed by the fellahin, it is
to be found in their eagerness to buy land, and their
ability to pay for it.

In the case of Government land (which is usually
sold by auction on the spot), rather than add to estates
already large, preference is given to smaller buyers, who,
by a graduated system of payments, are enabled to pay
off the purchase-money and yearly taxation by instal-
ments : a system which, while encouraging thrift among
the people, incidentally restores to circulation large sums
of hoarded wealth.

One thing which must strike the observer is the
entire absence of fences or other divisions between
estates or farms. Certainly the canals do supply leading
boundary marks, but otherwise the country is apparently
one continuous field, where each farmer knows to a
nicety the extent of his holding, which is roughly
indicated by a stone or post here and there, landmarks
which no one would commit the crime of removing.
Should doubt or dispute arise upon these points, the
matter is usually adjusted by the omdeh or sheykh of
the village.
