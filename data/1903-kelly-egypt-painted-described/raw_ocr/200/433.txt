 

The Life of the "Fellah"

is reached it is cut down to save the tax and make
room for a new one. The crop is almost entirely taken
up by European dealers, and even a few weeks after
harvest it is hardly possible to obtain a handful of dates
in a village which perhaps is entirely occupied in their
cultivation.

Here again economy is the rule. Every leaf cut off
is dried, and later on made into baskets or the wicker
beds of the middle classes, while under the trees, if the
grove is not too dense, bercime and vegetables occupy
the intervening spaces.

Then the corn harvest begins, in which female
labour is largely employed, numbers of women and
girls following the crop from village to village until
all is gathered. These labourers are usually paid in
grain, which can be readily exchanged for food or
lodging or the other necessaries of the moment, leaving
a margin in cash as the result of much hard bargaining
with the local dealers.

The corn is generally plucked up by the roots, made
up into little sheaves, and carried to some vacant spot
in the vicinity to await its threshing. As soon as the
crop is off the field, flocks of sheep or goats are put
on to it to feed upon whatever stubble or gleanings
may remain, and behind them comes the ploughman,
preparing the ground for the next crop. These occu-
pations are concurrent, and I have seen in the same
field every operation from ploughing to threshing
going on at the same moment, for no time must be
lost if the land is to give its best return.
