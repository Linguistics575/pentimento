delicate fabrics so seductively spread before him.

Purchasing in the bazaars is a matter not to be
undertaken lightly, and requires time and patience.
Except in one or two shops which are principally
frequented by Europeans, fixed prices are unknown,
and the article is only worth what can be obtained for
it. Extravagant prices are often asked, to which you
counter by offering a quarter of the sum as a basis of
discussion, and sometimes days may be spent in negotia-
tion before a bargain is made.

I remember some time ago, while painting in the
carpet bazaar, I found an American lady whom I knew
slightly, in hopeless despair over the price demanded
for a really beautiful rug upon which she had set her
affections. I quietly induced her to go away, and,
taking up the negotiation on her behalf, eventually
secured it for one-third of the sum originally asked.
The lady was happy, and the dealer perfectly content,
knowing that he could not have got more. Bargaining
is a game thoroughly enjoyed on both sides, and, if
played with proper patience and good feeling, pro-
ductive of mutual admiration, if not respect. Beware
of haste, however. There is an Egyptian proverb,
"El agela min esh Shaitan ,, (Haste is from the devil),
and shopping in the bazaars seems specially to come
within the ban. For instance, a gentleman, no doubt
pressed for time, was making a purchase here, and at
once paid the price asked, and hurried away. I found
the dealer presently in tears, and asked what ailed him.
