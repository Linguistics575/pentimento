Egypt

the serious injury, or even death, of several of the
combatants.

No ill-feeling seems to be engendered, however;
though nearly approaching war, it is simply a friendly
exhibition of prowess, in which fatalities are complacently
regarded as " the will of God."

Such are some of the subjects the desert affords the
artist, in which the simple incidents of patriarchal life
are varied by a " fantasia " on horse-. or camel-back, or
the medieval excitement of a hawking-party.

Painting in the desert, however, is very arduous. It is
a " barren and dry land," where the heat often is terrible,
and where hunger and thirst add their discomfort to
the many difficulties incidental to your work : the glare
of light thrown upwards from the glittering sand, the
irritation of the sand-flies, and above all the feeling
of hopelessness of ever approximating to the subtle
beauty of your subject. Thirst, however, may often
be relieved by sucking a pebble, while, as I have men-
tioned before, the expedient of a little charcoal or green
paint rubbed upon the eyelids (especially the lower one)
is a considerable mitigation of the glare.

There is one phase of desert-life, however, which is
not only intensely disagreeable, but frequently attended
with danger, and that is the sandstorm. Most people
who have visited Egypt have in Cairo, or up the Nile,
had some experience of the discomforts of the khamsin ;
but this can give them little or no idea of what it means
to the traveller in the desert, where no shelter is
obtainable, and the full effect of the storm is felt.
