Mosques and Public Buildings
should be studied, however. F orbidden by his religion

to reproduce human or animal forms, as savouring of
idolatry, ordinary pictorial representation was denied
the Moslem artist, who was therefore obliged to seek
some other means of expression.' This has resulted in
the development of a form of applied art, rich in its
elaboration, most suitable to its purpose, and in every
way original and artistic.

Two dominant features will at once strike the be..
holder : first, the pendentive form of carving or plaster-
work which embellishes corbels and brackets, and lends
such an air of grace and lightness to canopy or arch;
and secondly, that curiously"involved geometric design
which characterise almost all their schemes of decora-
tion. Both forms are almost universally applied, and
are found alike in buildings and furniture.

The best examples of the pendentive are to be found
in the corbelling which supports the stages of minarets,
or in the cornices and doorways of such mosques as
Sultan Barkiik, El Ghury, and Sultan Hassan; while
the dome of Kait Bey, the bronze doors of Muayyad
and Kalaiin, and the panels of nearly every " mimbar,"
or pulpit, are enriched with designs of a geometric
character.

On studying these designs, it will be found that in
most cases the radiating lines emanate from a rosette
which usually forms the centre of a panel, or in larger
spaces is repeated at intervals over the whole surface.

1 Exceptions occur, as in the frieze of Sultan Hassan, but this introduction of
animal life is usually the work of Persian decorators.
