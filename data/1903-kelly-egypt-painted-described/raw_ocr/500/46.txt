Egypt
hawkers drive a brisk trade in eggs, dates, sugar-cane,
and bread.

Presently cries of " Irkub " 1 send passengers to their
seats, and, to the accompaniment of bell-ringing, horn-
blowing, and waving flag, you continue your journey,
eventually reaching Cairo, tired, but delighted, and
having had a glimpse at least of two of the most
characteristic features of Egyptian landscape with its
attendant incident.

1 Ride.
