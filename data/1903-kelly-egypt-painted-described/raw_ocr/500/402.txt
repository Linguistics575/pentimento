villages as these, European visitors are almost unknown,
and the inhabitants are amongst the most simple of
these primitive people. On our approach, of which
the men in the fields had given warning, the Omdeh
and headmen of the village met us on the outskirts;
their pleasure on our arrival was great, and exclaiming
"What honour for our village I " and "You bring a

stirrup-irons and bade us welcome, and acting as our
guides led us through the trees to the principal gate
of the village.

Kahbiina, being a typical "fellah" village, may be
described rather fully. The outside walls, made of sun-
dried mud, are practically without doors, or windows,
and have rather the appearance of a line of fortifica-

heavy wooden doors, closed at nightfall, and guarded
from the inside by the village watchmen. The mud-.
huts of which the village consists are usually of one
story, the roofs being covered with heaps of cotton
and " doura " stalks, stored there as fuel. Space being
limited, the houses usually adjoin, leaving narrow lanes
where necessary, which form the only thoroughfares of
the town.

Roaming at will over the house-tops are sheep, goats,
and the half-wild dog common to all these villages.
Occasionally an upper story is built to houses of
greater importance, and here and there are square
towers, erected to accommodate the thousands of pigeons

whirling overhead. F requently these lanes end abruptly
