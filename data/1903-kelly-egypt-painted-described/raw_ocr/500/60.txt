Egypt

name. So "Ya meenuk! " directs a man to move to
his right, while " Ya meenik / " applies to a woman, and
the cry "Ya meenuk wa she malik!" warns a man
and woman in front of you to step to their right and
left respectively, so that you may pass between them.
Should you, as in the excitement of the moment is
quite probable, invert the genders, both will step
inwards and render a collision inevitable; from which
it will be seen that a little knowledge of Arabic is
dangerous, and that donkey-riding through the streets
has many excitements.

Such then are some first impressions of the native
streets of Cairo, above whose struggling mass of
humanity rise the mansions of a bygone day with
the mellowness of a thousand years upon them.

As the first sense of strangeness wears off and
familiarity increases, you are able to further particu-
larise and distinguish between the various types and
occupations.

Here let me correct a general error which speaks
of all natives as "Arabs." In reality there are very
few Arabs to be found in Cairo, and those met with
are usually " Magrabin," or Tunisians, who have come
in to trade their camel- and goat-hair fabrics. The
" Bedawin " are seldom to be seen, most of the Eastern
caravans being composed of Syrian or Persian traders.

Each trade or nationality used to frequent some
particular khan, or caravansary, whose lower story
provided shops and stalls for the display of goods, the

upper room being the living apartments of the travellers.
