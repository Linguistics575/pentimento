 

The Desert and the Bedawin

Nowhere is sunshine more brilliant, or the air purer and
more invigorating, while a thousand little things go to
make up the total of its charm.

The moment the desert is struck a strange feeling
of exhilaration comes over horse and rider, and in the
crisp morning air both seem to experience the joy of
life and become impatient for a race.

Holding in your horses for a moment, you give
them their heads, and with a bound they are off at that
tearing, plunging gallop peculiar to the desert-bred
stallion. The wind rushes, by you, tossing mane and
tassels, as with snorts of fierce enjoyment' the horse
inhales the breeze. Sand and pebbles fly from their
hoof-strokes, while the clumps of grey-green "mit
minan " bush or spiky " helga " are quickly left behind.
As you race along, the startled jerboa and desert hare
scatter to right and left before you, and the pelican or
vulture seek safety in rapid flight. Jackals crouch in
their lairs as you pass, and presently up start a pair
of black wolf and give object to the chase, and the
pace grows hotter till the hard-pressed animals reach
sanctuary in the rocks. It is a half-hour of intoxication
for man and beast, until, panting but excited, your
horses are with difficulty brought to a standstill.

These "Arabs" get up a wonderful pace, and the
sensation is delightful. Their stoppage, however, is
abrupt, and should the rider be careless he and his steed
will part company!

Dismounting to rest a while, you have time to notice
more particularly the desert growths which surround
