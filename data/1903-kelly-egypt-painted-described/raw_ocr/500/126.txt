Egypt
England the university Mosque of El Azhar (or "the
splendid ") was founded (A.D. 97o).

Nearly all the earlier mosques consisted of a more
or less square court surrounded by cloisters supported
on pillars, which in many cases, as in El Azhar and
Kalaran, were robbed from Christian churches or Greek
and Roman temples.

We see then that, quite apart from any pictorial
value these mosques may have, their historic interest
is great; and it is remarkable that at a time when
Gothic in Europe was declining, the Saracenic style
in Egypt produced its most perfect example in the
tomb mosque of Kait Bey, and for a considerable
time subsequently continued to produce good designs.
Generally speaking, the mosque was also the mausoleum
of its founder, such tomb mosques being distinguished
by the dome in addition to the minaret; for while the
latter is a usual feature in mosque design, the dome
is only employed when marking some burial-place
below.1 It is worth remark also that in most cases
these monuments of art were the design of one man,
and were completed during the lifetime of an individual ;
and, although lacking some of the interest which attaches
to the" mixed styles and gradual development of most
of our cathedral piles, they have instead a completeness
and homogeneity which leave nothing to be desired.

I have already mentioned several of the more
important mosques which should be seen and studied,

1 This refers to the great dome, and does not apply to the small dome or cupola
frequently placed over, the niche.
