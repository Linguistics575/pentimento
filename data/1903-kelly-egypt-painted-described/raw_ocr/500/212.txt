Egypt

extravagance of tourists, even beggars will hardly
think you for them, and the substitution of piastres
instead of milli√©mes as " backsheesh " has added
appreciably to the incidental expenses of the trip.
When it is considered that the daily wage of the
majority of these people does not exceed two or
three piastres, it will be readily understood how dis-
proportionate and bad in its influence is any excessive
dispensing of " largesse " by travellers.

At many of these landing-places interesting curios
are to be bought: inlaid walking-sticks and pottery,
ornamental baskets and dish-covers made from coloured
grasses plaited in good designs, and the inevitable
Egyptian "antilcas." Stuffed animals and horns are
to be avoided, but some really beautiful fabrics are
to be had, and occasionally a good coin or ornament
in metal-work.

What a lively ten minutes it is for the would-be
purchaser, whose bargaining must be carried on in
pigeon-English and under stress of time! It is all
very amusing, and the final scramble in the mud for
the odd coins thrown ashore as the steamer leaves
is really most laughable.

These stoppages, with their attendant noise and
bustle, form excellent foils to the easy-going life of
your steamer, and perhaps serve to increase the delight
with which the traveller revels in the constantly varying
beauty of the mountains on the eastern side.

Take for instance the flat-topp" range of F eshun
or the castellated bluffs of Gibel Kasr-es-Saad. Notice
