Here let me mention that though the title of sheyk
is generally a birthright, it does not of necessity imu
authority. Each village has its omdeh or sheykh ,
pointed by the Government ; sometimes the heredit
sheykh may fill the position, but often the appoint
is specially made and the title only enjoyed so long
the holder is continued in the office. He is respond
for the good behaviour of his people as well as t
collection of local taxes, and exercises a general con
over the affairs of his village. The office carries wi
it a small remuneration, while the honour is gre
appreciated.

Speaking generally, the fellahin live very amica '
together, and, so far as my observation goes, quar se.
are infrequent. Their relations would seem to .
governed by a patriarchal feeling of kinship, and po
exists amid their toil in the beautiful idioms of th
language and salutations.

Strangers passing in the road salute each ot
graciously and gracefully, while friends in meeti
exhaust a vocabulary of compliment before the dir
question as to health or happiness is asked or answer'
What could be more poetic than their " Good-by
which says l

"Shiif wishuk b'il khare in-sh'llah" (Until by
will of God I see your face in health) ?

Or the greeting between reunited friends :

" Ana huashtini ya akhuya " (I have longed for yo.
C) my brother)?

The " salaam '

,

itself is full of meaning. First
