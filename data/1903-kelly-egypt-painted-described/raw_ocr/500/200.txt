Egypt

which entirely alter their character. I have been
greatly struck by this, and it is really difficult to say
that you know the Nile, so varying are its moods.

How unlike its morning aspect does any given spot
appear at sunset! and the sudden change of wind from
north to south will immediately effect a complete
change in the appearance of your surroundings. Early
mists, still water, changing light or wind, each in turn
transforms an individual scene into as many different
pictures. Added to this is the difference in your point
of view consequent upon the rising and falling of its
water-level, the varying incident of river-life, and the
ever-changing character-studies the banks afford.

It is not my object, however, to enter upon any
detailed description of the river, but rather to point out
a few features which strike me as interesting, and
typical of the journey as a whole.

Almost immediately on leaving Cairo a new country
unfolds itself. The Mokattam Hills and pearly-tinted
Tiira range appear very different when seen from the
water-level, and, after passing the palm-groves of Bed-
rach√©n and the various groups of pyramids which lie be-
yond, all that is already familiar is left behind, and Ayat
marks the beginning of what is new to the voyageur.

Here, and for a considerable distance to the south,
the hills on either side have fallen away, and interest is
confined to the river itself and its high mud-banks. But
how very interesting it is! It is blowing freshly from
the east, and little clouds slightly wind-torn cast their

fleeting shadows upon growing corn and muddy water.
