is a continuous delight, in which form and cc ca I
changing atmospheric effect fill every hour of
with picture subjects hardly possible of attainment,
What could be more restful than the camp
be enjdyed beside these quiet waterways, where n
is found to mar the poetic beauty of surroundings
the quiet water alternately repeats or foils !
