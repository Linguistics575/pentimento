Egypt
is only by first marrying some one else that she and
her original spouse can make up their quarrel and renew
conjugal relations! As a matter of fact, a woman on
her marriage becomes little else than a " chattel," to be
enjoyed or removed at will, and whose duties consist
solely in ministering to the wants of her husband or
attending to his children. One cannot therefore hope
for much improvement in a race whose mothers, usually
married far too young, are raised but little above the
beasts, and possess neither the ability nor the inclination
to properly train their offspring.

Under all the circumstances it is not surprising that
the Egyptian girl does not invariably regard marriage
as the most-to-be-desired aim in life. Some years ago,
an old servant asked for leave of absence so that he
might return to his village in order to marry his
daughter to a neighbouring farmer. All the settlements
were satisfactory, and old Ali was well satisfied with his
daughter's prospects in life. Two days later he surprised
me by returning to his duties, saying that his daughter
was ill and the marriage postponed. It transpired
afterwards that the girl, dreading the slavery of a
married life, had poisoned herself rather than endure
what she regarded as an unhappy fate !

It must not be supposed that these marriages are not
often happy ones: no doubt they are. But whatever
their result may be, there is no question as to their
picturesqueness, and particularly in country places, where
simplicity only serves to add to their interest. The
attendant festivities last from three to ten days, accord-.
