remarkable feat is performed ; for in sand too loose to
retain a footprint the "scarab" succeeds in forming a
tunnel from the open air to his hidden treasure below.

employed, and simply with head and shoulders as before,
the passage is cleared, and the sand above remains to
crown the arch.

The surface sand is largely strewn with coloured

their contribution of porphyry or gritstone; volcanic
clinker and conglomerate adding still another to the
many pages of its history.
