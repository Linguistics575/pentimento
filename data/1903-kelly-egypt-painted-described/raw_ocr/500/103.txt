haste. F ew of us, however, could reach the sublime
heights of one shopkeeper I encountered in the Suk-
en-Nahassin (or coppersmiths' bazaar). I wished to
buy a "sheesha," or water-pipe, and saw the one I
wanted just over the man's head. With the blandest
smile, "En Nahass" pointed out that he was seated

This street of the coppersmiths is one of the most
interesting of bazaar streets. Here in poky little
shops are sold all sorts of domestic utensils in brass and
copper, nearly always beautiful in form, though rather
rough in workmanship. A very large trade is done
here, the natives often investing savings in copper-work,
which is always sold by weight, and is readily market-.
able in case of need. Out of this branch the shoe-
makers' and silversmiths' bazaars, and, crossing the
Muski, its continuation forms that of the cloth-sellers,
from which open the spice, scent, and Tunis bazaars.
The latter is very paintable, though entirely lacking
anything in the way of structural beauty.

The whole of this district is one of superabundant in-
terest. F rom the Bab-en-Nasr to the Sharia Mohammed
