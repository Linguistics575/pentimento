cultivation of timber-trees now being carried on by
the Ministry of Finance under the direction of Mr.

Tel-el-Kew, in itself a fact of some importance as
proving the feasibility of making virgin desert profit-

Iam not able to give any detailed list of the trees
and shrubs which have been planted, but among them

and the possibility of the country being eventually able
