station of the Controller of F isheries. Here hundreds
of fishing-boats daily land their "hauls," the best fish
going to Cairo and other large markets, smaller kinds
being consumed by the fellahin or made into "fessikh''l

As far as the eye can reach stretches the water of
the lake, on whose quiet bosom hundreds of the whale-

they shoot their nets", while others from time to time
return to land their still living freight, which is kept
in tanks on shore until ready for despatch to various
markets.

Occasionally a big "drive" is organised by the
resident Controller. Every available boat is out in the
small hours of the morning, and forms a huge semi-
circle some miles away. Turning homewards the boats
slowly return, the crews beating the water and chant-
ing weird songs as they proceed. Gradually the circle
narrows until it is plainly apparent that the water
within the cordon is literally alive with fish. Then
ensues a scene to be remembered. From every boat
men jump into the water, dragging nets which are
eventually overlapped until the entire circle is enclosed.
Each moment the space becomes narrower, and the
cries of the men louder, while overhead swarms of
pelican, flamingo, crane, and sea-birds add their screams
to the cries of the fishermen. The seething water is
