is of great interest, and well worth doing, and can easily
be performed by steam-launch from Cairo. Should
ladies be of the party, tents and camp-beds should be
carried, local inns being impossible for them, and the
cabins of a launch too cramped for comfort. Excellent
camping-places are everywhere available, provisions of
good quality are to be bought, and such a trip as I have
described may in this way be made without inconvenience
and at moderate cost. Wild duck abound on the lower
river, which, with snipe, quail, and pigeon shooting,
goes far to relieve the tedium of the less interesting
reaches. But, though sport is plentiful, I recommend
the trip purely for its varied charm of life and scenery,
not the least attractive being the sense of adventure,
and freedom from conventionality.

To me, Damietta was quite charming, as also was
the whole river-journey, but this visit has left with me
a feeling of pity and indignation. The people are
" masliim," 1 and I think unnecessarily so. There
seems to me to be no reason why Damietta should not
again become the flourishing shipping centre it once
was, and only the policy (instituted by Mohammed Ali)
of fostering the trade of Alexandria to the exclusion of
other ports prevents the return of at least some portion
of its former prosperity.

Without wishing to enter upon questions of policy, K
it appears to me that this attitude of exclusion is foolish.
The trade of Alexandria is firmly established, and need .
hardly fear the rivalry of Damietta, whose commerce
