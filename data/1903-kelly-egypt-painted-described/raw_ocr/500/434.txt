The harvest being gathered, threshing follows, a

picturesque operation of peculiarly Biblical interest.
The corn being spread in a large circular pile on some
clear space of ground close to the village, a yoke of
oxen are driven round and round upon it, drawing
after them a wooden vehicle rather like a large chair on
runners. This is called the " nurag," and is ingenious.
Between the runners which assist the oxen in beating
out the corn, are several circular knives, which revolve
as the " nurag " travels, and simultaneously cut up the
straw into the " tibbin," which is the staple fodder for
stable animals. Though strictly adhering to the Scrip-
tural command and leaving his yoke unmuzzled, the
driver, seated in the "nurag," vigorously wields his
whip of ox-hide, and gives them little opportunity for
forage.

When the operation is over there remains a high
mound of grain, chaff, and chopped straw which must
be separated. The means employed are simple to a
degree. Taking advantage of a breeze, a man with a
large wooden shovel tosses the mixture high into the
air. The corn, being heavy, falls 1n a gradually 1ncreas-
ing pile close to the workman' s feet, the chaff and straw
blowing away and forming a second pile of "tibbin"
some little distance off ; each is then separately gathered
and stored, and the operation is complete.

Though hard work is imperative, the increased
water-supply resulting from barrage-works and canal-
building enables the farmer to get the best return for

his labour; and even reclaimed desert-land may, with
