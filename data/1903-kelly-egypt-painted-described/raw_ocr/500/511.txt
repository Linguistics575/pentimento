Religion and Character of the Egyptians

each 'other, and keenly appreciative of a joke, they have
many traits which charm, whereas their faults may
usually be traced to the influence of their origin and
past government. Quarrelling seldom, and kind to
their poorer or afflicted brothers, I confess to a very

â€˜warm feeling for these poor simple people, who respond

so readily to a kindly word or act, and are so grateful
for consideration.

One thing which always impresses me strongly is the
evident sincerity of their religion. To them "Allah "
is a personal Deity, whose fatherhood is believed in,
and to whom his children can with confidence appeal.
Whatever is, is ordained of Allah, and therefore best,
and no word of complaint questions the Divine intelli-
gence or regard for welfare of the " faithful." " The
Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed be
the name of the Lord," is their attitude, and " Kismet " 1
the only comment on disaster!

It is a custom among many to regard the
Mohammedan religion as largely vicious and immoral.
In reality it is neither, and I am strongly of opinion
that a sincere Moslem is a good man, and that his
religion is in many ways spiritual and ennobling.
Indeed, an average Mohammedan may well shame the
majority of Christians. To him, his religion is a daily
personal need, and his devotions, in which he constantly
occupies himself, are tremendously real. The ritual
of prayer provides few petitions and is mostly a
religion of adoration, though petitions are presented
