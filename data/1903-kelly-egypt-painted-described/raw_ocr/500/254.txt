Egypt

speculate. The art of their jewellers and stone-carvers
still excites wonder and admiration ; and in astronomy,
letters, or art, Egypt was pre-eminent among the
nations, and counted among its sciences many which
have been lost to the world, or maybe are only now
being rediscovered. Surely among what is picturesque
in Egypt may be included the romance attaching to
this lost Atlantis of knowledge.

Reverting to Egypt of to-day, we find little interest
in Luxor itself, especially since the market, formerly in
the centre of the town, has been removed to a more
distant site enclosed in high iron railings, and roofed
where necessary with corrugated iron! All very
prosaic, but better for the people, and certainly adding
considerably to the comfort of the town itself.

The surrounding country is fresh and fertile, and a
good donkey-ride through the farm-land is a refresh-
ing relaxation after the fatigue of sightseeing, or the
exhausting excursion to the Tomb of the Kings.

Turning to the right before reaching Karnak, the
road, or "kiibri''l as it is here called,1eads through
crop- and pasture-land to the desert beyond. Here the
usual phases of rural life are in full swing : the " rai-el-
bahim" and his mixed herd loom through the dust
they cause; country-people drive their produce-laden
beasts to the market ; and in the fields youngsters tend
the tethered cattle or roaming flock, and shyly beg a
" backsheesh " as you pass.

1 Bridge, probably so called because the raised roadway would be surrounded by
the annual overflow.
