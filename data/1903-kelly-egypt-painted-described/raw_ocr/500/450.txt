Egypt
as it fell, blistered hands and face and parched us all
with thirst.

A little farther on, the hot sun had evaporated the
water, leaving a sediment of slime covered with a
crust of salt. As you broke the surface in travelling,

the same time liberated swarms of small stinging flies

terraces and water-channels, and the little runnels in
the gardens, and all the evidences of a former cultiva-
