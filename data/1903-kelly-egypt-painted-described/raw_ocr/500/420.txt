Egypt
find an hour or more of steady riding necessary before
your objective is reached.1

As I have endeavoured to show, the country-people
are almost universally hospitable and considerate. The
only case to the contrary which comes within my own
knowledge was once when, on reaching San-el-Hap,
our servants, who had been sent to cut bercime for our
horses, were assaulted in the field by some of the vil-
lagers, who objected to supplying fodder to strangers;
and in this case the incivility was punished by a sound
beating from the Sheykh.

This incident suggests another point worthy of
notice, in the paternal attitude of the sheykh to his
villagers ; in most cases he is looked up to as the father
of his people, and his authority is seldom if ever
questioned. I was once present at a land sale where
the legal transfer of a plot of land, which had been
bought by a local sheykh, was about to be completed,
when claim was laid to it by one of his followers. The
sheykh, a strong big man with only one eye, said not a
word, but, grasping his staff, took a few hasty strides
towards him, and, had he not been held back by those
around, would probably have brained him. Trembling
with indignation, he exclaimed to the inspector, " My
Bey, I cannot help it; I must eastigate him: he is one
of my sheep which I have brought up."

1 Distances are always reckoned by time and not by miles. Thus, in response to
inquiries, the answer will be, so many hours " by your legs," or so many " by horse."
