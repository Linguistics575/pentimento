Egypt

Still, things are progressing in Egypt, and among
the highest classes at any rate broader views obtain.
Many of the upper classes have enjoyed university
education in Europe, and are more or less cosmopolitan
in their sympathies, while the freedom of intercourse
which now exists between the gentlemen of Egypt and
their European guests cannot fail in time to break
down what remains of racial and religious prejudice.

On the other hand, it is stated that crime is increasing
in the country, and poisoning cases are unfortunately
very frequent. In most instances I believe this par-
ticular crime is an act of vengeance by the brother upon
a sister who has gone astray, the girl usually being the
victim rather than her seducer; and I recently heard of
one extraordinary case where two shadoof-men, brothers,
walked all the way from Assuan to Suez and there
killed the sister who had disgraced her family, after-
wards surrendering themselves to the Mudir and
stating what they had done. Of late years European
labour has been more freely introduced into the country,
and I cannot help thinking that this has not had a good
effect upon the morale of the people; but apart from
any consideration of this kind, is it not possible that this
increase in criminal record is more apparent than real E

As I have previously suggested, an appeal to law
was not always wise, and the victim of assault or robbery
was often better advised in bearing his wrong in silence
than in taking any legal action for redress.

Let me give an illustration. Near a village in the
Sharkiyeh lived a farmer whose "fatted calf" was stolen
