Egypt

delirious devotees, who drop insensible on the ground,
or mechanically continue their motion unconscious that
the act is over!

Space will not permit of my attempting to describe
all the festivals of the Mohammedan faith, the Muled-
es-Saleh, or the picturesque "Seyideh Zeynab," which
most tourists see; but I cannot leave this su.bject
without referring to the procession of the "Malunal"
or Holy Carpet, which is the most important of those
which occur during the time visitors are usually in the
country.

Always associated with the Mecca pilgrimage, the
origin of the ceremony would appear to be as follows.
In the year of the flight 670 (A.D. 1272) the Sultan
Ez Zahir Beybars performed the pilgrimage to Mecca
in state, the journey being made on camel-back, and
beneath the shelter of the "Mahmal "or canopy used
as aprotection from the sun; and succeeding Sultans,
Khalifs, and Khedives followed the same practice until
comparatively recently. The Khedives of Egypt have
now ceased to make the pilgrimage, but send the
"Mahmal "as an emblem of royalty, in which is placed
the "kisweh," or Holy Carpet, made each year as a
covering for the Kaaba, or tomb, of the Prophet in
Mecca. On the arrival of the new one, the old carpet
is returned to Cairo with the pilgrims, and is then cut
up into small pieces which are afterwards sold as relics,
the proceeds being applied to the Moslem charities.

The "Kisweh" is made in Cairo at great expense,
and consists of eight pieces of black cloth made of silk
