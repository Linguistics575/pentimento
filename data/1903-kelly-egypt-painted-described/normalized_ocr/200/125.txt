Mosques and Public Buildings

to remind ourselves that its evolution dates from the
early part of the seventh century, when in the twenty-
first year of the Hejira (A.D. 64.2) the "Jehad" pro-
claimed by Mohammed had resulted not only in the
subjugation of Arabia, Syria, and Persia, but witnessed
also the conquest of Egypt and the building of the
first Mohammedan mosque in Cairo.1

Initially, Mohammedan art was simply the adapta-
tion of existing forms to the necessities of the new
faith, the models being principally the Byzantine
churches or the Roman temples in Syria and Egypt.

In plan the mosque closely follows that of the
Basilica, the chancel becoming reduced in size, and
taking the form of the "mihrab" or niche in the
eastern wall, but in other respects, at least in the
earlier periods of the style, remaining much the
same.

The first real development was the substitution, for
structural reasons, of the pointed arch in place of the
semicircular one which characterises Byzantine and
Roman alike; and in the building of the Mosque of
Ibn Tulun in A.D. 876 We find for the first time
a building in which the "broken arch Ft was carried out
throughout the entire structure, and the first expression
of purely Saracenic principles of decoration. This was
nearly three hundred years before the pointed arch
was introduced into England, and was contemporary
with our Anglo-Saxon period of architecture, while
before the introduction of the Norman style into
