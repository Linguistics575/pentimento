The First Cataract

Much more of interest remains which I have not
pted to describe. The cool and picturesque
rs, equallfattractive to the artist and to the curio-
er; Grenfell's tomb, or the camp of the Besherin, -
in turn furnishes the day's employment.

I have said enough, perhaps, to show that Assuan is
. htful, and I may add that in no other place in
pt have I noticed the donkey-boys and guides so
-controlled and quiet in their demeanour.
