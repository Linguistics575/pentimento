conducting me to my tent, added, "This house is yours;
do what you will with it, and with us your servants."
A Biblical greeting, the effect of which was heightened

or the Sheykh retired to superintend the preparation of
the evening meal.

As I rested, one by one the headmen of the tribe

at the entrance, they advanced in turns with many
"salaams," each as he kissed my hand uttering the
single word "Mahubbah" (Welcome); then, seating
