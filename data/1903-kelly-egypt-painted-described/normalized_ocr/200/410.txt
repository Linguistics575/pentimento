with the villages, and quickly become open cesspools
into which all the offal of the place is cast. As though
this were not enough, the people of Kahbiina had
placed their village cemetery on its brink; and though
the curious domes and tombstones of the departed no
doubt added to the picturesqueness of the scene, this
hardly conduced to the health of the village, which drew
a portion at least of its drinking-water from the pool.

Of late the Government have been making strenuous
efforts to have all these pools filled and the cemeteries
removed to better sites at a distance; and the last time
that I visited Kahbiina I found that this order had
been carried out, and the pool no longer remained to
add beauty to the landscape by its reflection of town
and date-grove,

While always finding the male inhabitants curiously
interested in my work, the women, on the other hand,
were excessively shy, and as I passed them in the street
they would turn their faces to the wall and gather their
children to them, lest the "evil eye" of the Christian
should bring disaster upon them. I found, however,
that after a time this restraint broke down, and in
the end I was able to get models for my pictures fro
among the young women of the place.

The men I found to be usually well set-up and
handsome; the women, occasionally beautiful whe
young, on approaching middle age become plain t
a degree, and one almost regrets that, no doubt owin
Ito the exigencies of their field-work, the use of the vei
is dispensed with.
