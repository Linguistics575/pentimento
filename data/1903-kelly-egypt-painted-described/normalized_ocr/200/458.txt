you. The most common is the "mit minan," a sage-
like shrub, but often growing to a height of six or
seven feet, and in clumps of as much as forty feet
in circumference. Then there is the fork-like "helba "
and desert thorn, the bright green "hyssop," or the
highly aromatic "gazelle broth," and a great variety
of ice-plants, some red and fleshy, others lusciously
green. Wild-flowers also abound, and I have counted
as many as twenty varieties in an area of as many
feet. One of the prettiest is the Bower of the
"helga," heliotrope in colour, and shaped like a con-
volvulus, which springs from the junction of spine and
stem, and among them grows the dingy "atriplex"
or salt-bush, small and rather like a sponge in appear-
ance.

Remain still. and look closer, and another interest
appears in the life these shrubs harbour. Little flies
feeding on the young shoots are being hunted by the
spider or ant, who again fall victims to the stealthy
lizard, the smaller varieties of which would seem to be
devoured by their larger brothers, some of whom are of
considerable size and exceedingly quick in their motion.
Large beetles scavenge the desert, and with herculean
efforts carry away and bury in the sand pieces of offal
and partially consumed prey many times larger than
themselves. Their modas aperandi is very interest-
ing. The "booty" is deposited, and the beetle com-
mences to excavate below it, shovelling the loose sand
away with head and shoulders. Gradually the mass of
forage sinks, until it is entirely below the surface, and
