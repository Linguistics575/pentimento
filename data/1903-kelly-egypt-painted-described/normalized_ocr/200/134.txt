Egypt

This rosette resolves itself into two, three, or more
crane: superimposed, with an equal space between the
various arms, and the ends of these, instead of being
Jquare, form an obtuse angle, the lines of which are
extended, and by crossing and recrossing break up
the intervening spaces into a variety of mathematical
figures. Here again a possible influence of early
Christian forms upon a style of art so differentially
developed may perhaps be traced.

In the painted ceilings, brass lamps, or inlaid coffee-
tables we find the same form of ornament, and in
many cases the lines are of a different material, and
raised above the intervening spaces, which are indivi-
dually carved, giving the whole an extremely rich effect.

Most of the furniture of the mosques has long ago
disappeared, except where, as in the stone pulpit of
Barld1k, it has been built in as part of the structure.

South Kensington Museum possesses several of these
panelled pulpits of wood, such as that of Kait Bey,
and Lagin's pulpit from Ibn Tulun, in addition to
many fine examples of panelled doors, copper and brass
drinking-vessels, candlesticks, etc.; and in the Cairo
Museum in the Hakim Mosque are many of the
exquisite lamps or chandeliers of perforated and chased
metal-work formerly hanging in the mosques, as well
as several finely wrought coffee-ttaes, and other speci-
mens of the best art of the Saracens. Unfortunately,
many more beautiful pieces have been surreptitiously
removed and sold to dealers, and have passed into
the hands of private collectors.
