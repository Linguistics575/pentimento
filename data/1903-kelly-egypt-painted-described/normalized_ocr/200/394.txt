in the fields some distance from the town, fruit or
sweetmeats would be brought to me, the good-natured
"fellah" squatting before me, delighted with my
evident relish of the refreshment. So the days passed,
and when sundown closed my day's work I would be
assisted to the Rest House, where, solemnly shaking
hands with my friends and wishing each other "good
night," we part till to-morrow, when the whole per-
formance is repeated.

There is something touching in the simple kindness
of these people. Their hospitality and kindly offices
are rendered as a matter of course, for which the only
reward expected is that you will condescend to accept
the tribute of respect they offer. Such was my life
at FakF1s, each day's busy enjoyment being graced by
some little act of civility which made work easy,
and which has left with me a very pleasing recollection
of the good folk of the village.

Here also I had the good fortune to make the
friendship of M' Collough Bey, then engaged upon a
land survey, to whose companionship through many
long and sometimes trying rides I owe so much of my
pleasure on these journeys, while his perfect knowledge
of the language and customs of the people has greatly
added to the information several years of wandering in
these districts has brought me.

The morning arrived when l was to leave Fakas,
and with it a fresh proof of the Sheykh's kindness, in
the form of a handsome donkey intended specially to
carry my baggage. It is one of those silvery mornings
