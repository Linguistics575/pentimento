Egypt

enormous blocks of red granite which break out at
various points. Beyond the town are palm-groves in
which are the barracks of the native troops, while
, behind lie the streets and bazaars of the town.

We were a small party in r894---l think only eight
of us; but it was a very pleasant one, and the constant
exchange of courtesies between our hotel and the mess-
of the 10th Mdanese, then quartered there, supplied
the social element most delightfully. One evening the
mess would dine with us en bloc, the dinner being..
followed by a musical evening largely provided by the
ladies, who performed on mandoline, guitar, or piano,
but also memorable for the rousing choruses of the coon-
songs. Another time we would join the mess. These
occasions were rendered exciting by the long donkey-
ride in the dark, and it was amusing to see ladies in
evening dress clinging to their steeds as they stumbled
through the palm-groves. Soldiers and donkey-boys
escorted us, some with lanterns, which only dazzled, and
perhaps added a little to the uncertainties of the ride.

Later, we saw this regiment march out of the town
en route for the Sruian, its commander soon to meet a.
soldier's death, though happily the second in command
still enjoys the honours he has well earned at Khartrs
and the Cape.

Assuan has always been the frontier town of Egypt
proper; and at the time I speak of, though Wady
Haifa was the headquarters of the frontier force,
Mahdist bands disputed the intervening country and
rendered it unsafe for travellers.
