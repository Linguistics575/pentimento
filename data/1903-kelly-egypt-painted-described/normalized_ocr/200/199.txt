The Nile

enjoy a trip previously only within the reach of the
well-to-do, and, all modern "improvement" not-
withstanding, the journey up the Nile still is, and must
always remain, one of the most beautiful and fascinating
the world affords.

The ostensible object of the journey is of course the
inspection of the temples. Few passengers, however, are
versed in hieroglyphics, and the full enjoyment of the
antiquities is only possible to the Egyptologist. I
rather suspect that were the thsth known, most of the
Nile visitors are secretly bored, and only "do" these
sights under moral compulsion. As a matter of fact,
with the single exception of Philae, none of the temples
as they appear to-day are intrinsically beautiful, and in
most cases are so surrounded and smothered by squalid
dwellings and accumulated d√©bris as to prohibit any
distant or general view from which they might be
perhaps more generally pictorial.

Karnak is sufficiently free from such obstruction and
impresses by its vastness; while from the river, Kom
Ombos and Luxor are well seen, but usually fail as
pictures, unless under the magic influence of some
effect of light and air.

The real charm which draws people to the river is
undoubtedly its own beauty, and the interest of the life
it supports.

The variety of scene is surprising; and no matter
how often the trip to the Cataracts is made, each
successive journey discovers some new feature, or
presents familiar scenes under different conditions
