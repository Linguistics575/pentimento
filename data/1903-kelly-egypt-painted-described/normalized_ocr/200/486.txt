Egypt

head, covering mouth and nose, and leaving only the
eyes exposed, which, though protecting the face from
the flying splinters, only adds to your heat and suffoas
tion. Even should the water-skins not be cracked or
the water dried up, you cannot stop to drink, and food
is equally unattainable. "Hungry and thirsty, your
soul dies within you," as hour after hour you ride
until the storm abates or some shelter is found to end
your misery.

Fortunately, all sand-storms are not so violent as
this, and at the expense of severe granulation of the
eyes I have been able to paint them in many moods,
and in my opinion the pictures I have been able to
obtain have amply repaid my suffering.

Sometimes the moral effect of such storms is peculiar,
and results in a kind of temporary hallucination which
is curious. I was caught in a storm some time ago
which had this curious effect upon both my horse and
myself. We were riding over a rough bit of desert,
slightly undulating, with "khores," or water-worn
gullies, here and there. During a dense whirl of sand,
our party lost touch with each other and I found
myself alone. In all directions was this driving dust-
veil, which had the effect of distorting everything.
Rocks became mountains and a shrub appeared as a
tree. All idea of distance was lost, and, standing
upon the little hammock from which I searched for
the rest of my party, I might have been outside the
universe Jvitnessing the warring of the elements in
original chaos.
