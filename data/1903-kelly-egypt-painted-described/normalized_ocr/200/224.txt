Egypt

the merits of his beast and claiming your patronage.
On landing you are surrounded, and all the efforts of
the local policeman (who certainly does not spare the
rod) fail to protect the traveller from the pushing and
pulling of the donkey- boys, as each one strives by
main force to get you on to the back of his beast.
Nothing is of any use but a little of the vernacular,
and it is astonishing how amenable they become on
being addressed in their own language. You are then
permitted to select your donkey and mount in peace,
and are for the rest of the day spoken of as "the
Pasha" or "the Bey"; and the very boy or man
who shortly before was giving you the maximum
of annoyance, now scornfully reproves the passing
mendicant with, "Be quiet, you fool, don't you know
the Bey is an Egyptian and speaks Arabic l tt

The ride from Keneh to the ruins of Dendera is
very pleasant, the road lying entirely across fields and
being good enough for a gallop, and I have usually
found my donkey here one of excellent paces.

In the field as you pass the cattle are grazing
attended by good-looking boys and girls, while stark-
naked urchins, wound round with ropes of plaited
grass and flowers, perform a kind of morris-dance
for your edification. The country-people here are
polite, and greet you respectfully with "Naharak said l "
(May your day be happy!); or, on your departure,
the courteous salutation, "Roh-es-Salaam l" (Go in
peace D, to which you respond, "Ma salaami" (With

my blessing).
