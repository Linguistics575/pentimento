sails used, vessels would frequently be "bianketed "by
the high banks and palm-groves, whereas the enormous
height of the lateen sail overtops both trees and build-
ings, and enables it to catch the breeze even during the
lowest period of the river.

During flood-time all these vessels, now high and
dry, will be floated off the banks, and make their
first entry into the life of the river, bedecked with
coloured flags on which are embroidered the names
of "Allah," "Mahomet," "Hassan wa Huss√©n,"
etc. This same flood, however, will often carry away
large portions of the banks, and even partially destroy
the village built upon it. A great deal of damage is
done in this way, and must entail a heavy loss upon
the villagers. Nowadays spurs of stone are being
built at frequent intervals, so as to turn the main
current into mid-stream and so preserve the banks,
while those who have suffered loss in this way have
the first claim upon whatever land may be deposited
on the opposite side or below them.

Each year the course of the Nile changes, and
as the river falls the new channels have to be dis-
covered afresh. This makes navigation difficult, and
it requires a practised eye to tell by the nature of
the ripple where is deep water and where a shoal.
Often, and particularly in a breeze, the water cannot
well be told in this way, and the "midra," or sound-
ing pole, has to be brought into play, and with the
cry of "Ali" (high, or shallow) engines are stopped
and a new course tried.
