Cairo

It is a cosmopolitan assembly, where almost every
European language is spoken, as the following will
show. Two gentlemen of my acquaintance were
strolling round the Esbekiyeh Gardens, and presently
seated themselves close to some young men engaged
in conversation. Being old Cairenes, and between
them acquainted with twelve different languages, they
were immediately struck by the fact that the youths
were speaking in a tongue neither of them had ever
heard before. What it could be they could not
imagine, and finally, curiosity prevailing, one of them
accosted the strangers, and in polite French explained
their perplexity, and begged for enlightenment. "Oh,"
said one of them in reply, "we are talking Welsh I "

Here, then, is one of the difficulties which im-
mediately confront the Englishman, who is seldom
a good linguist. For the full enjoyment of Cairo a
little French and rather more than a smattering of
Arabic are essential, and the latter, at any rate, is not
easily acquired. Consequently the tourist is at the
mercy of his dragoman for any information, and misses
those snatches of "chaff" and repartee among the natives
which often add so much to the day's amusement.
With commendable energy travellers frequently, and
after much labour, learn a few Arabic phrases, usually
questions, forgetting that they cannot possibly under-
stand the replies. Let me recommend them to confine
their earlier efforts to the acquisition of such sentences
only as give absolute instructions to servants, drivers,
etc., and to which no response is required.
