The Desert and the Bedawin

At first the air is still, but hot and lifeless, while
the sky gradually assumes a dusty appearance, as, low
down on the horizon, ominous-looking clouds appear
in the south-west. The sultry air becomes more
and more stifling, producing a feeling of lassitude and
depression which is distressing; camels and horses also
show signs of uneasiness, and the sheep bleat pitifully
in apprehension.

Presently little puffs of wind, hot as from an oven,
herald the approaching storm. As the wind gains in
strength, the air is filled with a dusty fog through
which the sickly glare of the sun is hardly visible.
Fine drift-sand blows like snow-wreaths across the
desert, and the eyes are blinded and the lungs filled
with the choking dust. As the storm develops, little
splinters of rock or small pebbles are hurled through
the air, and cut the skin like knives. The sun is
totally obscured, and the ever-driving sand gradually
assumes the appearance of billows, which, splashing
and breaking upon the rocks like ocean surf, envelops
everything in camp, and piles tons of drift-sand high
against the tents and baggage. Then comes the time
when safety lies in movement. Camp equipage is
hastily packed upon the terror-stricken animals, and
the party starts to ride obliquely through the storm,
in order to cross its path, or find shelter in a mountain
spur. To remain still is to be covered and entombed,
while riding is discomfort indescribable.
