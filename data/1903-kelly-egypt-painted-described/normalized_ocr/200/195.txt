The Environments of Cairo






people prepared some light repast and very
ially invited me to partake of it, which I have
ly done; and in Cairo itself, while engaged upon
sque interior, the Imam has cleared out a cupboard
ks, etc., in order that I might leave my materials
, and so saved me the trouble of constantly carry-
hem backwards and forwards.
