wood, which allow of a certain amount of "play," the
separate pieces being easily moved by the finger. The
same principle is applied to "mashrubiyeh" work, this
freedom in the joints protecting the whole from possible
destruction due to warping and the buckling caused by
varying temperature and humidity.

The perforated plaster windows which often form
the upper lights in a "mashrubiyeh," and are to be
found in most of the mosques, have one ingenious
feature. The design is usually of a floral nature, and
is cut in the slab of plaster, the lower edge of
each perforation being at an angle of If degrees, so
that when seen from below no intervening material
interferes with the effect of the pattern. As these
windows are almost always placed high in the walls,
the effect of their delicate tracery, in which is set
coloured glass, tells very brilliantly through the gloom.
