Egypt

remarkable in Egypt. It is comparatively recent in
point of date, having been completed so lately as
f? BAN, and has many points of resemblance to
Dendefa. Two special features distinguish it from
others. Its pylons are of unusual height, rising 112
feet above ground, and are covered by carved depic-
tions of battle scenes. From the top of the pylons a
very striking view is to be had which repays the effort
of climbing. Here, by the way, it may be mentioned
that the ascending galleries by which the roof of the
temple or upper stories of the towers are reached are
inclined planes simply, and not staircases, and mount-
ing is therefore a gradual and easy process. Another
special feature of Edfu is the high boundary-wall entirely
enclosing the temple, from which it is separated by a
narrow court, which eventually merges into the Cloister
of the outer hall. This wall, like those of the temple
itself, is covered by hieroglyphics in bas-relief, not
incised, and many of the figures which occur are well
modelled. Various scenes from the life of its times
are pictured here, among which are crocodile and
hippopotamus hunts, in which all the accessory facts,
even to the strands of ropes or the meshes of fishing-
nets, are carefully elaborated.

As is so frequently the case, the temple is so sur-
rounded by rubbish-heaps as to be practically standing
in a deep depression which prohibits any distant or
general view of the building, and, until cleared out
by M. Marriette, even supported a native village upon
its roof.
