The Nile

How rich in colour the water is, each wavelet catching
a little of reflected blue which gives a sparkle to its
otherwise chocolate-coloured mass! A boat with flapping
sail is landing passengers and goods on a sandbank, or,
running well with the wind, is throwing off a creamy
cataract from its high-pointed bow. See the shape of
the sails as they bend to the wind, and the gleam of sun-
light upon the bellying canvas, as with quick tacks the
boat follows the tortuous channel of the river. Between
the masts you will notice a short post from which hangs
a brown canvas bag. This contains the provisions of
the crew, and is placed there in the sight of all so that
no one can indulge in a surreptitious meal.

Here and there between places of importance a
ferry-boat crosses with its freight of passengers or live
stock, while round the distant bend in the river appears
a group of vessels, with sails "goosewinged," running
before the wind like a flight of sea-birds.

On the banks, silhouetted against the sky, country-
folk pass from village to village driving camels and
donkeys laden with produce or building material, while
the handsome bullock and patient "gamoos "l tethered
in the fields, or turning the water-wheels, serve in turn
to vary the life of the scene. Half-naked men
laboriously working at the "shadoofs" lift irrigating
water for the fields; and women and children are as
usual occupied in laundry-work at the water's edge, or,
statuesquely erect, bear away their "balass" of water
gracefully poised upon their heads.
