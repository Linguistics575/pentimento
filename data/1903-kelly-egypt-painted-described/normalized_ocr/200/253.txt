The Nile

In decoration, as in structure, the art of the ancient
Egyptian is distinctive. The hieroglyphs of the temples
and delicately relieved mural carvings of the tombs at
Sakkara are peculiar to this country and epoch, and it
is remarkable that, though as "art "somewhat archaic,
in no instance is truth to nature contradicted. Animal
action, for instance, is always correctly represented, and
the story told with directness and force; and although
all such depictions followed a manner which might be
styled convention, the Egyptian artist saw nature with
a simple truthfulness which avoided those errors of
anatomy and motion which characterise so much of
mediaeval art, and are only now slowly succumbing to
greater knowledge.

Undoubtedly the ancient Egyptians were a people
of great scientific attainment; and apart from the lost
mechanical methods which enabled them to carry out
their stupendous works, many problems remain un-
solved. The texture of the mummy-cloths cannot
be copied by modern weavers; and who knows the
composition of the pigments employed in the decora-
tions of the rock-tombs? pigments as fresh to-day as
when applied 3000 years ago! And how again were
the interior chambers of the temple illuminated? Many
of these chambers are entirely beyond the reach of day-
light, so that artificial light must have been constantly
employed. Yet there is no sign of lamp or sconce, or
trace of smoke upon the walls! These are some
questions upon which no light has been thrown by
papyrus or hieroglyph, and upon which we can only
