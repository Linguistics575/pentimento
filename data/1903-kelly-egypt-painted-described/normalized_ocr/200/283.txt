The First Cataract

we would start for an all-day excursion to the Cataract,
or have a sailing match round Elephantine.

Leaving the old Sari, which was our general boat-
house and my studio for the time-being, we soon passed
the lower gate, a narrow channel between Elephantine
and the bank, over which a ruined Roman fortress
mounted guard.

All beyond was the Cataract basin, freely dotted with
islets, between which ran strong eddies or miniature
rapids which made sailing difficult. Sometimes these
little falls were a foot or more in height, and it required
considerable judgment in order to nurse your boat up
the back eddy, and then suddenly fill sail and "jerk"
her up the rapid; failure meant a long drift down-
stream before you could renew the attempt, and a
correspondingly great advantage to your most success-
ful rival.

These little islands, which are formed by a collection
of granite boulders filled in with silt, are very pretty,
and are usually well covered with shrubs and trees of
various kinds ;---charming picnic-places when the failing
wind did not permit of sailing, and ideal sketching
stands, free from the flies and fleas and disconcerting
smells incidental to many others we have had to endure.

Here you will often see men fishing with lines,
though personally I have never seen anything caught.
The Egyptians, however, love to idle in the sun, and this
pretence of fishing as an excuse for "lroafing" finds
many sympathisers at home.

The banks themselves are, on the Eastern side,
