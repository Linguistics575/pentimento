Egypt

Abdul Aziz means The Slave or Servant of the Beneficent

One.
Abd-el-Rahman "The Servant of the Most Compassionate.
Abdullah "The Servant of God.
Nasrullah "The Victory of God.
Hahibullah "The Beloved of God.

Nur-ed-Din "The Light (or Glory) of Religion.
Abd-el-Messiah "The Servant of Christ.
And so on.

This last name is suggestive, and it seems difficult
to reconcile their fanatical hatred of the Christian with
the fact that such a name as this is honoured among
them, and that the "Eed-el-Imahi," or "birthday of
Christ," is one of their great festivals.

Many of these "muleds," or sacred feasts, are most
interesting to the observer, in the picturesque pageantry
by which they are accompanied.

The Muled-el-Husaneyn, or birthday of Hassan
and Huseyn, sons of the Prophet, is one of the most
interesting, at any rate in Cairo. On this occasion all
the bazaars are illuminated and decorated, and the shops
tastefully arranged for the reception and entertainment
of guests. It was the custom of the Khedive, as well
as holy sheykhs, to pass through the bazaars on their
way to or from the Mosque el-Husaneyn, and they
would partake of refreshments en route. A like courtesy
is always extended to the passer-by or curious visitor,
who will be invited to sit and rest, and watch the
picturesque scene while enjoying the excellent beverages
and sweetmeats so cordially presented.

Probably the most important of these Moslem feasts
