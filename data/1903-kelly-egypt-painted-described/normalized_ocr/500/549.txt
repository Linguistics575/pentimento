been attempted. The American and English Mission
Schools have done, and are doing, splendid work, and
the new Gordon College at Khartrim promises to be
completely successful; and, provided no attempt at
proselytising is made to arouse the suspicion of the
parents, such schools must result in a vast amount of
good to the race.

Boys and girls should be equally educated, at any
rate so far as the middle grades; while those who
desire it should be enabled to advance to the highest
standard possible, irrespective of sex; and in the case
of the girls some tuition in domestic work and the
elements of hygiene is much to be desired. Private
philanthropy has done something in this direction, but
of course on a scale quite out of proportion to the
necessities of the case.

If only in the village schools a complete knowledge
of their own Koran could be imparted, the beneficial
result would be great. Few of the people know any-
thing more of their sacred writings than it suits the
Imam to teach them, and Ifeel sure that a thorough
knowledge of their own religion would go far to break
down that fanatical hatred of the Christian which so un-
fortunately exists. How many, for instance, even among
the relatively enlightened, are aware of Mohammed's
instruction that "after Moslems, of all persons Christians
are to be revered"? I suspect that this and kindred
teaching is of set purpose disregarded by the teachers,
who, instead, impart to their scholars such passages only
as are calculated to keep alive antagonism and hate.
