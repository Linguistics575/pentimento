Egypt

and district was a "den of thieves" (kharamieh); but
since the quartering of troops there, the people were
well behaved, and the value of all property had
improved. His influence upon the Egyptian troops
has been most marked. In 1883 I saw what remained
of Arabi's army reviewed by the then Khedive; it
was simply a rabble, ill clothed, only partially armed,
and, as it seemed to me, lacking in even the elements
of discipline and drill. See the same troops to-day,
after twenty years of close association with their English
comrades and training by British officers. Their
regiments, smart and soldierly, move with a dash and
precision which compare favourably with our own
crack corps; and, whatever their views before conscrip-
tion, there is no doubt that, once enlisted, the native
soldier has developed a passion for drill which is quite
remarkable.

Looking back towards Cairo, there is a fine view
of the tombs of the Khalifs, and the Citadel Mosque
beyond, which, particularly at sunset, is very striking.
Indeed, many pictures may be made hereabouts, and
it is curious how well the Mohammed Ali Mosque looks
from a distance, though in itself so poor in design and
proportion. Its situation, however, is superb, and it
dominates everything for miles around. There is a
particularly striking view of it from near Tiira.
Here the intervening desert rises between you and
Cairo, blotting out all of the city except the Citadel
itself, which, blue in the distance, stands up solitary
and graceful beyond the ridge.
