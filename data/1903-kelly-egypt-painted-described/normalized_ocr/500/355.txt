Canal Life in the Delta

wind was blowing, sailing was out of the question, our
journey being from east to west, and we had therefore
to be towed by the "guffrah "1 of each village in turn.
Starting from Menzala with a good team, we travelled
well, the "rais-el-guffrah "meanwhile going on ahead to
warn the next village to be ready. It was very pleasant,
sitting on our cabin roof under a genial sun watching the
woody bank glide by, the quietude of the scene being
periodically broken by the incidents of village or agri-
cultural life. Where nothing of human interest was to
be seen, the flitting and splashing of hundreds of king-
fishers supplied its place. This is a remarkable feature
of the canal, for though every waterway in Egypt abounds
in kingfishers, nowhere else have I seen them in such
numbers as here. Out of curiosity I counted their nests
in one reach of not more than two hundred yards,
and found them to number over one hundred and fifty,
and so tame were they that sometimes, as on rounding
a bend we would get close in-shore, they would remain
sitting on twigs as we passed almost within reach of
them.

The lively cheerfulness of the Egyptian Kingfisher
always impresses me; he seems happy, and perhaps has
reason. No one molests him, the river has abundance
of fish, and, when satisfied, there is nearly always a
generous warmth in which to plume himself and
ruminate. One cannot help being struck by this
little bird's power of assimilation. I have seen him

catch a fish apparently much bigger than himself, and

1 Plural of "gaffir," or village watchman.
