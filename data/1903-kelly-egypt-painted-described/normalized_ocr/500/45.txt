Introductory

The vegetable life of these canals is pretty, and you
recognise many familiar plants, while others are strange.
Kingfishers and wagtails are numerous, and among the
irrigated fields the "paddy bird "gleams white against

"Nasrani. "2 Standing partly aloof are a couple of
Bedawin, too proud to mingle with the noisy "fellah,"
though probably sympathising with their Witticisms at
the expense of the unbeliever. Little girls crying
"moyeh "8 perambulate the platform ministering to the
needs of the thirsty; and among the native travellers
