The N ile

Returning to Luxor, you may ride along the banks
of a small "khalig" or canal, full during high Nile
but usually dry after December. This is well shaded
by sycamore and tamarisk trees, and produces a great
variety of water-plants, and in one of the groves is a
very beautiful "sakkia" or water-wheel. Idle for most
of the year, the flood brings it into activity again, and
adds its groaning to the other sounds of field life. My
servant volunteered the following explanation of the
perpetual "sighing of the sakkia." It is said that
Alexander the Great had asses' ears, a fact of which
none but his barber was aware. Unable at length to
maintain the horrible secret, the barber in order to
relieve his soul went into the fields and whispered
the fact to a sakkia, and ever since they continue to
cry mournfully to each other, "Alexander has ears! "
"Alexander has ears! "

Among other trees you will see here for the first
time the d6m-palm, which I think I am right in
saying does not flourish to the north of Luxor; and
from here onwards to Assuan the castor-oil plant is
grown as a regular crop.

Quite apart from its historic interest Luxor is
quite a pleasant place to stay in, and the people
themselves are quiet and agreeable, though of course
keenly alive to the chance of a "tip." A very
excellent example was set them by the late British
consular agent, Achmed Effendi Ayyad, who was
always most attentive to strangers. Some years ago
he entertained my wife and myself to dinner. Twelve
