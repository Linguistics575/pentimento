The Environments of Cairo

one of the best views, where desert and cornfields
sharply contrast, and the Pyramids, standing boldly
against the sky, are reflected in the pool which runs
alongside the avenue. F rom the desert also is a quaint
view of them, but nothing impresses so much as a quiet

The Sphinx also, battered though it be by Mohammed
Ali's artillery, whetrseen in all the solemnity of night
is inexpressibly weird, and gives the beholder an over-
awing sense of eternal dignity and calm. Sit down
and live with it hour by hour and night after night,
and you will learn that the Sphinx is no mere
monument of stone, but has a mysterious power of
impressing itself upon your soul, as, looking backward
through the ages, and into the dimness of the future,
this most ancient and most incomprehensible of all
Egypt's monuments forces upon you some slight
understanding of what is meant by time and eternity.

It is rather curious that forms of such an un-
compromising nature as the Pyramids should possess
any pictorial value whatever, yet the fact remains
that no objects in Egypt are so frequently painted, and
it will be acknowledged that usually the resultant
picture pleases. Many factors combine to produce
this result. The surrounding desert, broken here and

in beautiful intersecting curves, to which the angle of
the pyramid forms the necessary line of contradiction.
Varied in colour and texture, these sand-sweeps are
infinitely lovely, and in a subdued form display all
