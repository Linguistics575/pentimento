The N ile

superstitious minds its annual overflow must have
appeared to be of a somewhat supernatural character,
and it is not surprising that the rising of its waters
should have been the signal for a series of religious and
festal ceremonies, or that the early Egyptians should
have included it among their numerous deities.

There is something peculiarly impressive in the
silent flow of the noble river, a feeling of dignity and
repose, and a quiet beauty not to be appreciated in a
moment. Few holiday resorts coinbine so much of
historic glamour and present-day interest, and the
Ct Nile trip "is rightly regarded as one of the greatest
attractions Egypt has to offer the tourist.

In former days the journey to the Cataracts was the
privilege of the few, whose ample means and leisure
enabled them to enjoy its scenery in a manner peculiarly
in sympathy with its character and traditions. The
slow-sailing "dahabiyeh" was not incongruous with
the lotus-age of Egypt, while the crocodile and sacred
ibis recognised little difference between the stately
Nile yacht and the aforetime sacred barges of the
priests.

To-day a difference is noticeable. The advent of
steam traffic on the Nile has not only driven the
crocodile to more secluded waters, but with them has
also disappeared much of the old glamour of the
stream. Everything is more or less vulgarised, and,
though the beauty of its scenery and majestic monu-
ments remains practically the same, a subtle change
has overcome the spirit of the scene.
