CHAPTER XII
THE DESERT AND THE BEDAWEN

THE suddenness with which the cultivation of the
Delta ceases and the surrounding deserts begin is one
of the most striking of Egypt's many dramatic contrasts.
Occasionally, as I have described in the preceding
chapter, a marshy zone separates the two, but more
generally the transition is abrupt and immediate.

Leaving the picturesque fellah and his richly pastoral
surroundings, a few steps often are sufficient to introduce
the wanderer into what is practically a new existence.

Not only is the scenery entirely changed, but its life
also, human or animal, has little in common with that of
the black soil, and presents features which, though of
equal interest, are essentially different.

What is there about the desert which so irresistibly
attracts those who have lived upon it? I am often
asked the question, but find it hard to give a ready
answer. There is a sense of freedom born of its own
immensity, and the majesty of its awful stillness, which
is strangely impressive, while its variety of colour and
character effectually robs it of any charge of monotony.
