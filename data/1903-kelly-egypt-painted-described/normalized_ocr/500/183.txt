The Environments of Cairo

Of all the environs of Cairo, however, the pyramid-
field of Gizeh is the first to attract the visitor, and I
think it is the experience of most that it is only after
repeated visits that any real appreciation of Pyramid
or Sphinx is developed, and that their impressiveness
increases with continued familiarity. The first visit is
fatiguing; and so much is found to do, that emotion
succumbs to physical exhaustion. The ascent of the
Great Pyramid and the exploration of its interior
galleries and chambers are followed by the regulation
camel-ride to the Sphinx, and the inspection of the
tombs. This under a hot sun, and with the constant
irritation of importunate guides and curio-sellers, is
a big day's work, and the traveller is usually far too
tired after it all to have any sentimental regard for
monuments which have mainly impressed him on account
of their size, and in which he finds nothing whatever
of beauty.

It is a pity that the intolerable nuisance of the
Pyramid "guide" could not be done away with.
Their persistence worries the new-comer, and even
residents who are well known to them hardly escape
their unsolicited attentions. Still, it is better than it
used to be. I well remember my first visit to them
in 1883, when, owing to the late campaign, tourists
were a very rare exception in Cairo that winter, and
the Pyramid Arabs were starving for "backsheesh."

A friend joined me in the excursion, about which we
had made particular inquiries, and knew to a piastre
what payments had to be made. We did everything
