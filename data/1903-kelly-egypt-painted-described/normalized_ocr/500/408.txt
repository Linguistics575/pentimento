Egypt

"mandiira," and, preceded by the usual washing, dinner
is served. Very different from that provided by Sheykh
Mohammed Abdiin, the fare here proved to be poor,
and consisted solely of a pyramid of rice on which were
distributed a few rather lean pieces of mutton. The
inevitable "riz-bi-leban "followed; and as both dishes
were strongly flavoured by the pungent smoke of the
fires, it will be readily understood that a keen appetite
is necessary before one can enjoy such a meal as this.
As is always the case, the coffee, by its excellence, made
amends for the dinner itself. The old Sheykh of the
village joined us at the meal, and, after eating a little,
made way for his son to do the same, etiquette for-
bidding both father and son to eat with a stranger at
the same time.

Presently I was conducted to my bedroom, guided
by a "gaffir," who carried a long stick and a lantern.
As we proceeded down the narrow lane, the dogs,
running alongside on the roofs, would constantly snap
at us and had to be repeatedly beaten off. My room
was merely a cupboard, about six feet square, without
window or, so far as I could see, any ventilation what-
ever, except the heavy door, which locked on the out-
side. The interior of the room was mainly occupied
by a dais of mud on which the mattress was spread.
Beneath was an opening which proved to be the fireplace,
but without a chimney, and before I could prevent him
my conductor had lit the rubbish it contained, the
pungent smoke from which very quickly drove me
into the street.
