Egypt

is the origin, of the buttress of later architecture. This
form lends to the buildings a sense of strength and
solidity which is very impressive; and, as though to
counteract the effect of weight in their structure, almost
invariably you will find an impost inserted between the
capital and architrave which gives a touch of lightness
which is valuable. Where any procession of pylons or
gates occurs, it will be noticed that each successive door-
. way is increasingly larger and more ornate, until the
magnificently enriched interior courts of the temple
itself are reached. Thus, those approaching the shrine
would experience an ever-growing feeling of wonder
and admiration; and on returning, the diminishing
proportions, aided by perspective, could not fail
to impress the beholder with a sense of distance and
immensity.

Dignity and repose characterise all these monuments,
and whether it be the Sphinx at Gizeh, or a sculptured
Rameses at Thebes, each expresses the same idea of
omniscience and immutability, to which the everlasting
nature of pyramid or temple-building forms a fitting
complement. To my mind, the evident intention that
these monuments should last for ever suggests more
of the character of the builders than any written record.
The deeply inscribed hieroglyphics are often somewhat
boastful, and reveal far less of majesty than the massive
walls which bear them, and sculptures which attribute
to the king almost divine power are less real and
impressive than the pride which would not suffer their
bodies to decay.
