into an amble by the encouraging endearments those
parched lips can scarcely utter. The man has won,
but it will be many days before he will be able to enjoy
that first ride when he and his now docile friend will
think and move as one.

Horsemanship is one of the cardinal virtues with
the Bedawin, who will refer to their neighbours as
"those dirty Egyptians who cannot ride a horse," and
much of your prestige among them depends upon your

may be with his master, he nearly always rebels against
a strange rider, who will have to reconquer the beast
for himself.

The Arabs are universally good horsemen, and
keenly enjoy equestrian sports. One pretty trick they
do, is to mark out a course by placing water-pots on
either side alternately, and some little distance apart.
Then, urging his horse into a furious gallop, the rider
will hang from the saddle and pick up a "ghouleh"
from one side, and then, swinging over, place it on the
ground on the other, while at the same time picking
up another. This is repeated over and over again
with wonderful precision and rapidity, and seldom at
the expense of a cracked pot.

suddenly just in front of you with the horse's nose
almost touching yours, or else with a quick swerve avoid
