Egypt

rugged hills of grotesquely piled-up rock, among which
are little patches of cultivation and an occasional
hamlet; at the water's edge the red-granite boulders
have, under the combined action of sun and water,
become coated with a glistening skin of black, smooth
to touch, and polished as though an army of house-.
maids had been engaged in blackleading them. A
little higher their own ruddy tint gleams bright in
the sunshine. On the western side the high hills are
almost entirely covered by the drift-sand poured over
them from the deserts beyond; and among the many
beauties Egypt has to show, none are more lovely than
these enormous wreaths of sand, gold in colour and
with a sheen like satin. From the terrace of the new
Cataract Hotel is a very fine view of these sand-
covered mountains, whose local colour is enhanced by
the outjutting rocks of red and plum-colour, the
vivid verdure of the islands, and the delicately blue sky,
all more or less repeated in the water below.

It is Phila, however, which most people come to see,
and usually no time is lost before the excursion is made.
This should be done on donkey-back, every bit of
the journey being interesting.

Shortly after leaving the town you will reach the
Cufic Cemetery, an extensive burial-ground, whose
ancient tombs and cupolas have a certain picture value;
or a slight divergence from the direct path allows of an
inspection of the old granite quarries, whence most, if
not all, of the huge monoliths which we have got to
know have been brought. Here may still be seen the
