The Environments of Cairo

kinds abounds, and as a contrast to the arable land
of Egypt it produces a great many flowering plants.
From the plain, numerous "wadys" or valleys bore
into the heart of the hills, wild to a degree, and as
worthy of the geologist's attention as that of the
artist. One of these, a tremendous earthquake rift,
ends in an abrupt wall of rock, below which is the
"Ein-el-Mi-isa," or Moses' Well, a favourite luncheon
rendezvous. Weird and rugged to a degree, this valley
always recalls to my mind the hymn:

. all through the mountains, thunder-riven,

And up from the rocky steep,

There rose a cry to the gate of heaven,
' Rejoice, I have found My sheep!,

No setting for the parable could be finer or more
suggestive.

All this rock is a solid mass of fossils, usually
bivalves and sea-worms, though amongst others I have
found a very perfect crab of large size.

From the top of the Mokattam Hills are several
most impressive views, particularly from the little
mosque of the Sheykh-el-Gaiichy behind the Citadel.
This mosque is of a very ancient date, and forms the
burial-place of the old saint whose name it bears. A
lonely resting-place, which my servant explains thus.
The old Sheykh had three young and beautiful wives,
and on his death-bed he ordered his tomb to be built
on the top of the hill in order that he might from
thence be able to overlook the whole city, and see

that his widows got into no mischief.
