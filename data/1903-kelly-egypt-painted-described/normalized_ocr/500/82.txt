Egypt

Though in my opinion the Cairene has pany traits
which command respect, it is inevitable that here, as
in all great centres of population, immorality and
crime should exist. I am afraid that association with
Europeans has had a somewhat demoralising influence,
and the former single-mindedness of the Mohammedan
has to some extent succumbed to Western indulgence,
while the large introduction of Europeans of the lowest
class into the life of the cities has had the effect
of destroying much that is good in their religion,
while at the same time introducing nearly every
European vice. Yet, notwithstanding this, there is
hardly a street in Cairo where the traveller may not
pass unmolested, a statement that could certainly not
be made of our lowest slums at home.

It seems to me a crying shame that Cairo should
be so overrun with low-class wine-bars, whose tenants
are not required to have any licence, or apparently
submit to any control whatever, and where wines and
spirits of the vilest and most inflammatory nature are
retailed. Surely something in the nature of supervision
might be attempted; for it is a most regrettable fact
that when once the Mohammedan violates his religion
by indulging in strong drink, he almost invariably
becomes a sot, even if the regular consumption of
absinthe and brandy, to which he becomes a slave,
does not make of him a criminal or a lunatic.

Another consequence of Western association may
be noticed in the gradual modification of costume.
A few years ago all natives, of whatever rank, wore
