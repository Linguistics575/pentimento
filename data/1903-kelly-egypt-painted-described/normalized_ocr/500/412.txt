While mentioning examples of native hospitality
and kindness, I must not forget two particular incidents
which occur to my mind, and which will show to what

he had tobacco it was not fit for "his excellency" to
smoke, but that if I would condescend to become his

me shortly. It seems almost incredible that the Sheykh
straightway despatched a servant on camel-back to
Zagazig with instructions to buy an "oke" l of the
best Turkish tobacco to be had there. It was the
third day before the journey was completed, and the
Sheykh enabled to present me with a "smoke "suitable
to my station! The other case was that of a poor
man, the floor of whose hut was covered by felted rugs
of the most simple kind, and decorated by barbaric
ornaments in red and yellow paint. Out of mere

seen nothing like them before. I was informed they
were made in the Sihlan, and there the matter dropped.
