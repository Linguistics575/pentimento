distributing centre. I visited the market-place, which
I found to be rather more than usually picturesque,
especially in the number of women seated in long rows
on the ground, and offering for sale a great variety of
articles, from cotton prints and glass bangles to anti-
mony and scents. Many were engaged in grinding
antimony into the "Kohl" used by all women in the
shading of their eyes and eyebrows. The antimony
was ground by means of a mortar and pestle made of
brass; most of them were quaint in form and of great
age, and on being struck rang like a bell. After some
good-humoured bargaining I secured one, and found its
great weight added considerably to my baggage for the
rest of the journey. Many of these women wore veils
on which were stitched gold and silver coins, probably
their dowry on marriage; others had strings of coins or
gold ornaments attached to the "mandil," or scarf,
which bound the head. One I particularly noticed,
evidently an heiress, the weight of whose fortune
depending from her head-dress almost prevented her
walking upright. People hereabouts are evidently
well-to-do, and many thriving shops adorned the town:
among others was a very well-equipped "Apothecaries'
Hall," where, on the invitation of the chemist, we
enjoyed a light meal.

Here also are made a great many figured and
coloured mats, some of great size, and mostly of good
design. The weaving-sheds were large and airy, and
it was interesting to watch the work proceeding.
