Justice.

The Cadi's duties were many, and included a
general supervision of the bazaars and shops, where
a rigid control was kept over traders, and even the
price of food-stuffs was determined by him.1 In the

instruments of torture and death, with which summary
justice was wont to be meted out to offenders. The
picturesqueness of those days has perhaps to some
extent disappeared, but the Cadi's court still continues
to exercise its functions, and will still often furnish
