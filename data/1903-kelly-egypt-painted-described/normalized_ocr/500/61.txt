Cairo

There are a great many of these khans in Cairo,
particularly in the Bab-en-Nasr and Bab-esh-Sharieh
quarters, and they were usually named after the
founder, as in Khan-el-Khalily (Khalil's Inn), or took
their name from the particular trade affected, as in
Stlk-ez-z√©t (Oil Bazaar), etc. In many cases these
khans have good architectural features. Most of them,
however, are falling into decay, steamboats and railways
having to a large extent destroyed the caravan trade
they were built to accommodate.

Cairo is a dusty place, and one of the most
important of street trades is that of the water-carriers,
and of these there are several grades. F irst the
"sakka," who dispenses unfiltered water from his goat--
skin---., most laborious trade, as the pay is small and
a skin of water weighs very heavily. F ormerly the
"salcka" was obliged to go to the river, perhaps a
mile or more away, for his supply; but to-day stand-
pipes in the street relieve him of this extra labour.

F requently the shopkeepers in a street will jointly
employ one or more of these water-carriers to con-
tinually sprinkle the streets and fill the "zeers" l
of those whose trade requires such a supply. Their
"sprinkling," however, is of a vigorous and thorough
nature, and I was once, while painting in the street,
completely saturated, and my picture swamped. Very
vexing, no doubt; but when the poor man fell on his
knees, and clasping mine implored forgiveness, I could
not find it in my heart to be angry, and so dismissed
