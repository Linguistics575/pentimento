strength that makes the scheme. Similarly, in their
costumes black figures largely, and enhances the value
of the brighter garments the "arbiyeh" 1 partially
conceals. In fact, the general range of colour in the
streets is black, white, and blue, among which little
glints of red, yellow, purple, or green shine like jewels
in the sun.

In addition to the human attraction of the streets,
domestic architecture is interesting. The ground floor
usually consists of shops, and above are the jutting
upper stories. The supporting corbels are often richly
carved, and many of the large arched doorways of the
houses are richly moulded and embellished in a manner
suggestive of the most ornate period of Norman work.
The entablatures are frequently enriched by perforated
stone windows decorated with that intricate geometrical
design so peculiar to Saracenic art.

The wooden doors themselves are often richly
panelled, and display large knockers of bronze inlaid
with silver. Wrought-iron or bronze grills protect
many lower windows, and the upper stories are
rendered remarkable by the projecting balcony and
windows of "mashrubiyeh "work.

Originally these were simply small cages of lattice-
work slightly projecting, in which were placed the
jars of drinking-water, in order that the breeze and
evaporation might cool them. The name is derived
from "sherub" (drink), and "mashrubiyeh" simply
means the "place of drink."
