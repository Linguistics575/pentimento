Religion and Character of the Egyptians

pursuits were only varied by occasional military service
or labour upon public works.

One by one, succeeding dynasties have succumbed
to more vigorous and powerful successors. The
Pharaohonic successions and the Persian, Greek, or
Roman conquerors have gone, each in turn destroying
the aristocracy which preceded it, and of whom no trace
now remains but in the temples or monuments of their
day. But through all the political vicissitudes of the
country, and frequent change of masters, the slave class
has continued till to-day in the persons of the fellahin.
Little altered in character, following the same avocations,
using the same implements, and above all rendering the
same servile obedience to the dominant power as was
the case in the days of Rameses or Seti. Docile and
obedient, good-humoured and industrious, they are,
and always have been, a nation of slaves. Passive in
affliction and rendering a ready obedience to the stronger
will which rules them, they are entirely devoid of that
spirit of manly independence so characteristic of their
Bedawin neighbours, and lacking in the initiative of the
newer Western races.

Since the Mohammedan conquest in the year
638 A.D., this passivity of character has been still
further accentuated by the fatalistic teaching of their
religion.

In the year I fr? Egypt came under the domination

' of the Turks, and, with the brief interruption of
Napoleon's occupation (1798- 1801), has continued
under their government until the present time.
