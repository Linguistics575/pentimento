language"! Cheeky, no doubt, but interesting as
showing how education, and the desire for education, is
spreading in the country.

As we steam southward the scenery changes in
character. The hills are lower, and have little of that
boldness which formerly impressed us. The banks also
are less precipitous, and though of great height are
more shelving, stretching in big sweeps from the water
to the belt of trees which marks high-water level, the
difference between low Nile and flood being about
forty-dive feet.

Irrigation here is increasingly difficult as the Nile
falls. Each drop in the level requires the erection of
another shadoof, and the cutting of a long and gradually
deepening drain by which to carry water to the first.
Sometimes three, and even four, shadoofs will be re-
quired to connect the receding water with the thirsty
land above; each shadoof is worked by one or more
men or boys, and proves a heavy drain upon the labour-
supply of the farm. Under a powerful sun it is terribly
hard work, and the labourers are practically nude, their
well-set figures and glistening skins shining in the sun
like classic bronzes.

The principal crop appears to be maize, but as usual
the banks left by the falling water are planted in beans,
onions, and water-melons. While date-palms are be-
coming less frequent, the castor-oil plant is more in
evidence, and looks very gay in its scarlet blossoms
and luscious foliage, and round about Kom Ombos
particularly I notice large areas under this crop.
