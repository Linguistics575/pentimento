of whieh, owing to the increasing trallie on the Nile, has been generally felt by
the travelling public.

Previous to this tww mrnng'ament. 110 aetyomtwnlaii0n of rm]: sort was to be
had anywhere on the. Nile, and travellers intruding: tn alnu' a munih 0r mnro in
Upper l'sry se had to incur the 0051 and inconvenience of hiring a Dnhabeah, n
slow nnd tor ious mode uf conveyance.

The Imxor Hotel was opened at the enmmunccment of the season, 157?»?8,
and the experiment has proved so Buuccsafnl mi to induct: nur lnmmgtrb‘ ta

their jnurnny at Lllxor on their way up Iar clown the Nile. thus nifurding
opportunities for the antiquarian tn vimt Karlmc and 'J'hcbca, and to devuta
the time necessary for thoroughly oxamirtirut them most interesting places.
