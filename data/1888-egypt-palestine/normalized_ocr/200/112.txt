RETURN VOYAGE.

When, on the down voyage, the laout stops at, any place which is not
marked in the itinerary as a regular tirioppiuy, uplace, or touches twice.
at. the sauna station, passengers who want donkeys to visit. these places
It second time must. pay for the donkeys themselves; the same applies
to night, excursions, visiting Kuru:1k, ur all); other 1:1: Lcc, by lnooulight,
or going to b'aultusius.

This three weeks' excursion on the Nile, and life on board a steamer,
is generally quite long enough for any one, and it is with great [ lulighh
that the view of the citadel and minurcts of Cairo is hailed, A gentle.,
man passenger once expressed his feelings very properly in saying that
to do all the work and sighr-scuiug 1111 Lin: Nile, and then to floit idly
down, was inst like reading a highly-iuturesting book, and, when
fiiuluyd, turning its leaves once more luisuruly over and lingering With
delight on the most beautiful passages, have a last glimpse at them,
and be very glad to have done wich it.

Should any msscngcr desire to return to Cairo a d: y or two sooner,
he cull be put aowu at any of the railway stations bumeen Assiout and
Ghizeh l but as there is only one train a day, he must be careful not
to miss it, or he might go without bed and food.

We here add a copy of the general bill of regulations and list of
1u) pi) ing-plaeos; the best course is nut to interfere nor propose any
Change whatever in this itinerary based on experience. Some people
will do so, and thus cause disorder and sometimes; displeasure.
