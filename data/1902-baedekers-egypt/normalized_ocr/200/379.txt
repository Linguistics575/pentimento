ground, but it is now almost entirely sunk in the sand. It was
discovered and excavated by Mariette, and has been restored by the
% ervioes des Antiquite's de I'Egypte', as is recorded on a. tablet
at the entrance. The mural reliefs, besides being interesting on
account of their subjects, are among the finest and best-preserved
examples of the art of the Ancient Empire (comp. p. ol). The
imperfect lighting of the tomb unfortunately prevents some of the
reliefs from producing their full effect, and various delicate details
inevitably escape the visitor.

From the street (Pl.A) we first enter the SMALL VESTIBULE (PLB),
which contains two pillars (upper parts restored), against which is
a figure of Ti, in a long wig and a short,
broad apron, holding a staff in one hand
and a kind of club in the other. On
the E. wall are several female peasants
(P1. a), representing the villages belong-
ing to Ti, bringing food to the tomb;
on the S. wall are poultry and doves
being fattened (P1. N. The other reliefs
are obliterated.

We next pass through a doorway,
the sides of which show tigures of Ti
and inscriptions, and enter the GREAT
COURT (P1. 0), an extensive quadrangle,
with a modern wooden roof borne by
twelve freely restored square pillars.
This hall was the scene of the offerings
to the deceased and the saiyrtfiee of
victims. In the centre of the court is
a flight of steps (Pl. o, by which we
may descend to a low subterranean
passage extending the whole length of
the building, and leading first to a
kind of vestibule and then to the tomb-
ehamher of Ti. The new empty sarcoph-
agus completely fills the niche in Which
it stands, so that only the front of it
can be seen. - The Wall Paintings
in the great court deserve no long
examination; they are much injured
by exposure and some have altogether faded. On the N. Wall (P1. e ]
are represented the saeritioe of cattle, shown in the Wood-cut
below, and servants with gifts t. Behind the wall here is another

* We annex woodcuts of some of the best ofthese scenes, from photo
graphs taken from impressions obtained by Dr. Iteil (d. 1880), and there-
fore almost facsimiles. With the exception of the large picture of Ti

engaged in hunting (p. IN) ), which is one-nineteenth the original size,
they are reduced to oaeetwelfth of the nriginel size.
