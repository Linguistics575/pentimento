l'nlnS include many pyramids, differing from those of Egypt by their
slender form, and several Iemples, of which those built by Hanna u.
and by Tallurka are specially note'worthyr but the remains of the city are
yn the whole very seauty. Cajlliaud explored the site in 1622 and Lepsius
m 1844. - Opposite Memui lies the village of AM O6m; not far off, in
the desert, is the dei Ganil, with the ruins of a large Christian o'nVent.
- On the same [ lett) bank, about 9 ll. above Abu Ihhn, is a. group of

Beyond Abu Hammed the railway descends the valley of the Nile
on the border line between the Atmfr (steppe) on the E. and the
cultivable belt on the river-bank on the W. The latter is marked

Nov. and Jan. the verdant strip reminds one of the bank of the Nile
in Egypt.

spacious white house is seen at a little distance from the village.
The Robatab and Shékiyeh tribes, together with a few sub-tribes,
constitute the great Arab group of the Monastr, whose territory is

The Monasir preserve a. number of ancient legends roncm-ning the
wanderings, feuds, and inter-marriages of their ancestors, arid are
exceedingly proud of these'histories of God's people'. In 1884
Col. Stewart, General Gordon's t-hief assistant, Rousset, the French
consul, and a Greek were treacherously decayed to the left bank
and murdered by this people, an atrocity by which Gordon's isolation
was hastened and his ultimate fate sealed.
