Temple of Ramrea H. ABYDOS. 20, Route, 223

with seven columns, which was never completed. The sculptures
and hiesoglyphies were sketched in colour under Sethos, and only a
few of them were afterwards finished as reliefs'en ereux'. They
represent Sethos saorifioing. The scenes in the lower row depict the
slaughter and cutting up of sarziiieial animals. The screens were
intended to veil the proceedings in the court from theKings' Gallery.

Adjoining this court are four urtf'mishei1 roams (P1. A, B, C, D), In
the three tivst the designs on the walls are merely sketched in; in D they
have been completed in colour. - Rooms E-I lie one story higher and
can he entered only from the outside. ll and I are filled with rubbish,
E-G contain unfinished representations dating from the reign ofMerenptah.

Returning now to the second hypostyle hall, we may pay a brief
visit to the Chamber which adjoins it on the left and was dedicated
to Ptah-Sokaris, god of the dead at Memphis. The roof is supported
by three simple columns without capitals (p. 220). The fine reliefs
show Sethos revering Sokarie, Nefertem, and other gods.

Opening "this chamber are two small vaulted'pcls; that to the
right dedicated to Soknris, that to the left to Neferte. On the left wall
of the former is a relief of Horus and Isis by the bier of Osiris, on Whose
mummy sits a gparvow-turwk (Isis); on the right wall are Isis and Home
hy the bier of Sokaris-Osirie, whose left hand is raised to his brow.

A few minutes to the N. of the, Temple of Sethos I. lies the
Temple of Ramses IL, which also was iiedieated to Osiris. It is in
a very ruinous state, but still presents many features of interest.
The scanty traces of a specious court may be made out in front of
the present entrants. Within, the ground-plan of a peristyle court
(decorated with Osiris-columns like the Ramesseum, p. 284), two
halls, the sanctuaries beyond them, and various other rooms can still
be traced; but the average height of the remaining walls is only
5-6 ft. To judge by the extant remains, this temple was a much
more sumptuous and more carefully built structure then any of the
other buildings of Ramses IT. known to us. Not only fine-grained
limestone, but also red and blanh granite (for the doors), sandstone
(for the, columns), and alabaster [ for the innermost shrine) were used
in its construction. The still brilliantly coloured mural decorations
in the rear-rooms are executed in delicate low relief recalling the
admirable seulptums under Sethos L; the rude: reliefs'en creux'
make their appearance only in the court and the first hall, with the
adjoining rooms. The reliefs in the first court represent a grand
procession.

On the right (NO wall peasants are shown bringing oxen, anrelopes,
geese, and other animals to four priests, of whom the first records the
gifts, while the second offers incense; farther to the right, the animals are
being slaughtered. On the left (E. tr, S.) walls are similar scenes. To the
left as we enter are persons with saerii1cia1 gifts, who are met hy a. Iuro-
cession of priests, soldiers, the royal War-uharint, captive negroes and
Asiatica, etc. The colouring of the figures is surprisingly well preserved.
In the rooms behind are much damaged religious representations.

On the outside of the temple, B'. side, is an inscription relating to
the war waged by Ramses II, against the llittites; unfortunately duly the
lower parts of lines are preserved. Adjacent are representations of erents
in the war, similar to those of the Ramesseum at Thebes (pp. 284. 285).
