On the smoothed S. wall of the fore-court is a Stale dating from
the Tith year of the reign of Ramses H., commemorating the mar-
riage of' the Pharaoh with the daughter of the King of' the Hittites.
At the top the king appears seated between two gods beneath a
canopy, while the prime of the llittites and his daughter (whorn
Ramses had brought captive to Egypt) worship him. - The space be-
tween the southernmost colossus and the face of the cliff has been
converted into a small open Court (Pl. o by the erection of a doorway.
0n the W. wall of the court is a long poetic inscription of Ramses H.

The FAQADE of the temple is crowned by a concave cornice, above
which is a row of 22 eynocephali. Within the cornice are the names
of Ramses H., surrounded by 111'an1s-serpents, and interrupted by
figures of' Ammon (to the left) and Re-Harmachis (to the right).
Then follows the riedication-iusciiptiott of the king to Ammon-RE
and Ite-H-rows. In a niche above the EVTRANCE DOOR (P1. g)
the préeuumeu of the king (Weser-ma-ré) is represented by large
figures in relief, amongst which that of the hawk-headed sun-god
is conspicuous. To the right and left the king presents an image of
Maat to this god, Le. to his own deitied name. On the lintel of the
door Ramses is shown performing the ceremonies appropriate to the
foundation of a temple before Ammon and Mut, 011 the left, and
before Ite-Harm/is and the lion-headed Wert-hckaw, on the right.
Within the portal a smaller doorway Was built by Ramses II.

We now enter the roi1-temple, the interior of' which measures
about 180 ft. from the threshold to the back of the innermost cham-
ber. The first chamber, the Great Hypostyle Hall (Pl. B), corres-
ponding to the open court with covered Colonnades in temples built
in the open air, is 54 ft. broad and 518 ft. deep. The ceiling is sR-11p-
ported by eight square pillars, against which stand C) siris-figures ot'
the king (30ft. high), holding the scourge and the eiook. The figures
in the N. 10w wear the double crown, those in the S. row the crown
of' Upper E gypt. The arti~tin effect or thes e admirably executed
statues 1svery tine; the besti is the fourth iigurei 1n the N. row, with its
intelligent exp1e ~ion and well- -preserved characteristic nose. The
ceiling of the central aisle is adorned with flying vultures, those of'
the side-aisles with stars and the names of the king. The 1reliefs on
the wall, still vividly coloured, MP of great historical value. 0n
the N. half of the ENTRANCE WALL CPI, h) the king is shown grasping
a band of enemies by the hair and smiting them with his club, in
presence of the ltawk-headed RE-Harmachis, guardian-deity of
N. Egypt, who hands the curved sword to Ramses. Above the king
hovers a vulture and behind him is his guardian-spirit "Kn. Beneath
are the king's daughters, with sistra. The S. half of this wall (Pl. i)
is occupied by a corresponding scene, in presence of Ammon-RE,
guardian-deity of S. Egypt. Beneath are the king's sons.
