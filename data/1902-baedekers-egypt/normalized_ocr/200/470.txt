t0 Asslu'l. MA'AHUMIL IB. acute. AI I

220 M. Monfalnt (rail. stat., p, 191) lies on the W. hank close
to the river, which must have made great eneroaehmeuts here since
the end of the 18th nentury. Between Munfalt1t and Assidt (26 M.
by river, only 17 M. by land) the Nile makes many curves.

Ma'ahdeh, a small village on the E. bank, lies on a narrow
strip of fertile land between the Nile and the S. end of the rocky
Gehel Abu Féda. The hills to the N.E. of Ma'sbdeh nontain tombs
of the Early Empire. To the S. is the Gebel Kumeh, with a quarry
exhausted in the reign of Sethos II. (insc ription).

Ahout 31/2 hr.to the N.E 4., on the plateau of the Arabian hil_ls, is
the sn- called Crocodile Grotto, in which a large number of mummies of
erncodiles were found, besides human mummies and 11 celebrated papyrus
MS. containing fragments of Homer's Iliad. The uxpedition is not worth
the trouble, as practically nothing "to beq seen except the charred remains
of the mummies of crocodiles. - To tth .E. of Ma ahdch lies the village
of (Arab e1'Agyat with tombs and quarries.

On the E. bank are (227 M.) the three villages of Beni Mo-.
hammad. To the N.E. of these, on the N. verge of a large and
fertile plain that extends S. to almost opposite Assit1t, lies the Coptic
village Dtsr el-Gebrai (Gabra1ui), rontaining a Greekinseription (dis-
coveled by MLHarris) in the form of a dedication ofthe Lusitaniau
Cohort, which served under Diocletian and Maximiau, to Zeus,
Hercules, and Nike (Victoria). In the Gebel Mardg, a ridge about
"/2111. distant, are numerous r0ek-tumbs belonging to princes and
grandees of the home of the'Serpent Mountain'.

These tombs, mostly dating from the close of the Early Emphe, are
divided into a N. E. and a S w. group, the former eompvjrahtg, 80 tomm
"with inscriptione and represeniations0, the latter about M) C12 with r1-
prescntuiions). The most interesting are two of the S. E, group, situated
above the village of Dér el. Gehmi belonging to Thnw and Elm (11th Dyn. J,
princes of the home of the Serpent Noantal n and of the name ofhbydor
like the graves of Berdhas.an, these tombs contain interesting repreeen-
tations of hamdieraftrurier1, harv est- ecenes fishing and hunting scenes, ere.

Above Beni Molytmmerl the Nile makes several great bends and
is divided into two arms by the large island Seilret Behtp. (ht the
E. arm lies (233 M.) Ebntib (Abnoub), with 5800 inhab. [ 4800 Gupts)
and fine palm-groves. The mountains on the E. hank now recede,
and the foot-hills of the Libyan chain approach the river, which is
here barred by the Dam of Assiitt (Assiout Barrage) now under
construction, an imposing work intended to regulate the irrigation
of the provinces of Assirit, Minyeh, snd Benieuef. It consists of
eight sections, the first and last of which have thro arches and a
sluice, while the others have nine arches each. As at the Barrage
below Cairo o. Iii), each arch can be shut by an iron door. The
dam is erossed by a turrrisge-road. - Immediately above the weir,
on the W. bank, is the efflux of the Ibrahimiyeh Canal, the S. pm-
longation of the Baht Ydsuf (p. MO),

We land at pit M.) et-. Hamra, the palm- -enc.losed harbour of
Assiut. Au embauked to ad, shad ed by fine trees, leads past the station
and handsome private and public buildings to the town in 1/4 hr.
