thickness to a transverse Gallery (Pl. k ], with a small room CPI, mm)
at each end. At the point l in this gallery, Mariette found a deep
well, new full of water, in which were 110 fewer than nine statues of
Khephren. The best or these are now in the Museum of Gizeh
(p. 81). Several figures of baboons and fragments of other statues
also were found here.

Between the Granite Temple and the Sphinx excavations have
laid bare a series of walls made of bricks of Nile mud. These date
from the Ptolemaic or the Roman period, and were built around the
Sphinx in order to protect it from the shifting sand.

The tombs surrounding the different pyramids, where the rela-
tives and state-oN), of the kings were interred, are far inferior
ill interest to the tombs that have been excavated and rendered
accessible at Sahkftm (p. 137) and the graves in Upper Egmt. The
exterior of the mastahas (p. 137), how: ver, may be studied here
(especially in the tombs to the W. and SE. of the Great Pyramid)
to better advantage than at Sakhzira. Travellers who propose to visit
Sahh√©ra may content themselves with an inspection of the exterior
of these graves; otherwise the so-iyalleil Tomb of Numbers (p. 128)
and Campbelys Tomb (p. rro are usually visited.

Travellers who are not pressed for time and who desire to obtain
a closer view of the second and third Pyramids, are recommended to
make the following *0ireait of the Pyramid Plateau.

After having inspected the Great PyrarnidCp.itN, we turn

the entrance, descend the mound of debris and proceed to the N. W.
angle of the Pyramid, "here the leveiled space on the ground

exposed to view. Towards the W. and S.W. lie numerous tombs
presenting an impressive appearance. One of these may he ascended
in order to inspect the shafrs (p. cxiiv) leading into the depths.

We now skirt the W. side of the vast necropolis, and reach the
N.W. angle of the rocky enclosure of the court of the Second Pyr-
amid. A natural deft in the rock (P1. d ] here facilitates our descent
from the top of the rock, which is 16 ft. in height. At the foot of it
we reach the plateau which was hewu in the rock in order to prepare
a level surface for this pyramid (p. 121). On the N. side of the
Pyramid is it 1lul1rry (P1. e), where, under Ramses H., blocks were
hewn for the temple of Heliopolis. The incisions and transverse
furrows forming sis rows of squares date from this period.
