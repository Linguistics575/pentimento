The rocky island of Bigeh (Egypt. Senmet), the goddess of which
was Rather, is the most interesting of the Cataract Islands near
Philze. It is easily reached by small boat in a few minutes from
Philay, of which it commands a picturesque view. We land at
the ancient quay and ascend by an ancient staircase. In front of us
lie the remains of a Ptolemaic temple (Neos Dionysus), of Which
part of the hypostylc hall is still standing, with its plant-eolumm
united by sttteytt-Nvalls. On the E. side is a door, into which an apse
has been built. The ruins are now occupied by a Nubian hamlet.
Behind the temple (to the W.) is a heauless seated statue of Am-
cnophis II., and beside the temple is the fragment of a seated figure
of Thutmosis 111. There are numerous inscriptions en the island.

The island off the N. end of Philas, now called Konoaso, was
formerly the B. limit of Egypt tsee p. 350). It contains numerous
n) ck-iuscriptioas, some dating as far bank as the Middle Empire.
On a massive donhle rock the orioueluys of Psnmmetikh II. are
conspicuous.
