Tanta, the thriving capital of the province of 6lutrl4yeli,
which lies between the Rosetta and Damietta arms of the Nile,
with a population estimated at 57,000, possesses large public build-
ings, bazaars, and an extensive palace of the Khedive.

The Mosque of the Seiyid et-Bedawi is a modern building of 110
special interest. The court contains the basin for ahlntions.

Seiyid Ahmed el- Bedawi, probably the mast popular saint in Jiycr, gypt,
was born in the 12th cent. at. Fez, and settled at Tania after apilgrirnage
to Mecca.

Travellers may generally visit the mnsque withnut an attendant. bat
must not omit to deposit their shoes at the door. During the fair, however,
whiclt attracts among other visitors a number "fanatical Mohammedan;
from countries rarely visited by Europeans, it is advisable to procure the
escort of the sh'Ã©kh of the mosque, to whom an introduction may be
obtained through the consular agent (fee 1-2 fix).

The eatafalque of the saint is covered with red velvet adorned
with embroidery, and is enclosed by a handsome bronze railing. The
dome is still tmfiuished. One large and two small schools are con-
nected with the mosque. The sebil, or tank, with the small medreseh
(school) above it, in the space adjoining the mosque, is older.

The most important of the three annual FAIRS op TANTA is that
of the'mmid' (nativity) of the saint in August, when upwards of
half-a-million persons congregate here from all the Eastern countries
bordering on the Mediterranean, and from the Mohammedan part of
Africa. The streets are lined with booths and stalls, and singers.
