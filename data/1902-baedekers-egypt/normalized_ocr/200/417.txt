Suez. lies at the head of the gulf of that name, one of the N.
extremities of the Red Sea, and to the S.W. of the mouth of the.
Suez Canal. Before the construction of the great work of M. de Les-
seps, it was a miserable Arabian village, with 1500 iuhah. at most,
while in 1897 it contained 17,457, including 2774 Europeans. Its
trade, however, in spite or the opening of the canal and the construe-
tion of large docks, has not materially increased. Neither the Arab-
ian quarter, with its seven mosques and unimportant bazaar, nor
the European quarter, which contains several buildings and ware-
houses of considerable size, presents any attraction. The streets
and squares are kept clean, and the climate is excellent.

On a mound of debris to the N. of the town, not far from the
station and the magazines of the'Ehtu1iviyeh Company', is a
kiosque of the thdive, commanding a thte view of the mountains
of the peninsula of Sinai, the sea, the harbour, and thttown. The
hill is called by the Arabs Kohn el-Kolzum, and was probably the
site of the Ptolemaic fortress Klysma; relics of the period of the
Pharaohs have also been discovered here. Beyond the railway, to
the W., are the mad-huts of an Arab sailors' quarter. The small
eminence to the N.W. is named the Beduins' Hill. - A little
farther to the N. is the mouth of the Fresh Water Canal o. 162),
the flow of which into the conduits, as well as its discharge into
the sea, is regulated by means of a large look. The level of the
canal is here 61/2 ft. above that of the Red Sea. on its banks, and
