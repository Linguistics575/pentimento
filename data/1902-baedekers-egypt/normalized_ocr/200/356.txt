12% ft. broad, and, owing to the unevenuees "the rock from which the
pavement has been removed, varies from 13 ft, to 13 ft. bin. in height.

In the pavement of the chamber e is the mnuth (furmer1y covered) of
a shaft 30 ft. in length, which hea a fine granite lining at its upper end
and could be closed by e traprdoor at its lower end. It is continued by
a horizontal shaft, 10 ft. in length, to the Tomb Chamber (P1. i). Imme-
diately before the latter is reached, a tlight of seven steps leads to the
right to a. chamber with recesses 0n the right and back walls. The tenth
chamber Is paved with blocks of granite, 2%: ft. in thickness, and its
ceiling has been fm-med by placing the stones against cech other at an
angle so as to resemble a. nmft and then hollowing them out on the inside
in the fosan of a Gothic arch. The richly decorated sarcophagus of Men-
kewré was found here by Col. Vyse in a good state of preservation. It
was externally 2 ft. 7 in. high. The lid was gone. Fragments of the inner
wooden coffin and of the royal mummy (now in the British Museum)
were found in the chamber e, The vessel in which the msrcsoplvsgus was
being conveyed. to England. was unfortunately lost off the coast of Spain.

The original intention of the builder was to construct a pyramid on
a small scale, containing only the sloping corridor 1k, leading to a cham-
ber at e, smaller than that now existing. Bat when a larger pyramid was
projected, the corridor ubcd Was formed, leading first to an anteehamber
end then to e tomhrchamber at e, enlarged by deepening the earlier
chamber at um point. Under the New Empire the interior iT the pyramid
was ruined by the forcible entry of treasure-seckers; but probably daring
the Suite period a restoration took place. To this restoration are due the
sloping shaft and. the granite chamber in which We sarcophagus of Men-
kewre was concealed, as well as the lowerrlying mom with the recesses.

The Second and Third Pyramids are most conveniently visited in
the course of the circuit of the Pyramid plateau mentioned on p. 126.
After inspecting the Great Pyramid visitors usually proceed to the
Sphinx, which rises from amidst the sand ofthe desert about 350yds.
to the SE. The path thither leads between the so-called'mortar
pits' (P1. m) and three Small Pyramids of no interest. That in the
centre (Pl. L), according to Herodotus, was the tomb of a daughter of
Kheops; that to the s., according to an inscription preserved in the
Museum of Gizeh, belonged to Heuwetsen, another daughter of the
same king.

The **Sphinx l which, next to the Pyramids thernseles, is the
most famous monument in this vast burial-ground, is hewu out of
the natural rock, and, with some aid from added blocks of stone, has
been moulded into the shape of a recumbent lion with the head of a
man. It represents the king, probably Amenemhét III. (12th Dyn.),
by whom it may be supposed to have been. erected; afterwards it l'as
taken for the sun-god f.lar'-em-Eklvwet ('Horus on the horizon'),
known to the Greeks as Harmachis. In front of the breast originally
appeared an image of a god, the weatherwom remains of which
may still be made out. The head, wearing the royal head-cloth,
which was originally adorned with the royal serpent, was most
carefully executed. Now, however, it is i1eplorab1y mutilated:, the
neck has become too thin, the nose and beard have been broken

t The Egyptian Sphinx, being of the masculine gender, is represented
with the head of a ram or of a men, and. rarely with that of a Women.
which is ascribed to it in the Greek myths.
