of Memmm. THEBES (W. BANK). su. Route. 307

flood of verses spread over the legs of the colossus, most of them by the
vain eourt-poetess Batbittat One of her effusions (on the left leg) relates
in 16 hexameters, that Memnon greeted Hadrian, as well as he could (ui:
Bu'mrovl When he perceived the emperor before sunrise, hut that a clearer
note, like that caused by a blow on an instrument of copper, was emitted
at the second hour, and that even a third sound was heard. Hadrian
greeted Memnon as often, and all the world could see how dear the emperor
was to the gods.

'Balhilla, by an inward impulse stirred'
'Has written all she saw and all she heard'.

By far the best verses are those on the front of the pedestal by As-
klepiodolus, who calls himself imperial procurator and poet. They may
be translated as follows: -

'Sea~horn Thetis, learn that Mumnon never suffered pangs of dying'.

'Still, where Libyanmountains rise. sounds thevoiee of his loud crying' -

' (Mountains Which the Ni1is-sueeam, laving, parts from Thebes, the hun-
dred-gattsd)' -

'When he glows, through rays maternal with Warm light illuminated'.

'But thy son who, never-8ated, dreadful battle still was seeking',

'Dumb in Troy and Thessaly, rests now1 never syeakirvg'.

The ruins in the neighbourhood of the eolossi are unimportant.
About 3 min. beyond them is another Statue of great size, now,
however, almost completely, covered by arable land. The ruined
ternple, in front of Which the above-mentioned statues stood, has
left an important memorial in the shape of a conspicuous ry0l0ssa1
Sandstone State, erected by Amenophis m. It is now broken in
two. The hieroglyphics and the representations refer to the dedi-
cation of the temple. In the rounded pediment the Pharaoh appears
receiving the symbol of life from Amman on the right, and from
Sokar-Osiris on the left; above are the winged sun-disk and the
name of Amenophis III. Behind the Pharaoh in each case is his
consort Teye. - Still farther to the YW., at the foot of the Libyan
mountains, two fragments of an ancient briek-bqilding, known as
Kirrn el-Hétdn, project like huge horns from the ground.

rise the hills of the Libyan Desert. A little farther on, we see on
the opposite bank the extensive palm-groves and smoking ellie-
