Mayfotver, and 1'icloria of this line make similar three-weeks
voyages hctweou Cairo and Assutrn from December to May. The
general arrangements and conditions resemble those of Messrs.
Cook's steamers. The, return fare is 35t. and upwards, according to
the cabin.

Passengers by steamer should beware of the risk of catching
cold by leaving the windows of their cabin openi They should also
avoid placing themselves too near the edge of the deck: and it is

run aground, especially above Lasor. Liability to delay through
this last fact, makes it impossible to be sure of reaching Cairo in
time to make connection with the ocean-steamvrsi
