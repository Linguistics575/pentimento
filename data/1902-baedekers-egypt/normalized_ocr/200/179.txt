clxviii ARABIC LANGUAGE.

In the period of theTulunides, when Persian'mf1uenog made
itself felt even in the religious conceptions of Egypt, portraits were
painted and coloured wooden statues erected in the palaces, and
there was even a factory for figures of animals in Cairo. But no
long period elapsed before the prohibition contained in the Sunna
against the representation of any living being again came into force.
Representations of this kind are therefore very rare, and are now
to be found preserved only in the low reliefs carved by Persian
sculptors of the 8Wite sect Statues and paintings have disappeared
without leaving a trace. Painting and sculpture in modern Egyp-
tian art have been reserved exclusively for the decoration of wall-
surfaces.

The TRANsrarrutArios of Arabic vocal sounds. so intensely different
from our mvn, in the ordinary Latin alphabet is rendered additionally

in railway tim tables, and in other publications we tind the transliteration

pronounced'toolnol'; Ahusfr, pronounced'Abo seer', etc. - The 1 or the

Arabic belongs to the Semitic group of languages, and has no
relationship with the tongues of Europe, A knowledge of Hebrew,
however, will materially facilitate the learning of Arabia The
golden era of Arabic literature is coeval with the introduction of
Jr'i-fsitm, and the 1.iorirt in the dialect of the Jiuredsh (the
family of Mohammed) is still regarded as an unrivalled model of
style and language. But by the side of thisliterary Arabic flourished
also various colloquial dialects, which were carried by the Arabs
into the various provinces conquered for the Crescent, and there
developed partly under the ir1fluenee of the old local tongues. In
this way arose the vulgar dialects of Arabic, of which that spoken
in Egypt is one. In writing, however, an attempt was made to
retain the older forms, and the written language of the present day,
known as Middle Arabic, occupies a position midway between the
original classical tongue and. the popular dialects.
