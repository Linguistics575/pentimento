of the king. The *Tombs of el-'Amama contain the best examples
of this realistic tendency and are, therefore, of great importance in
the history of art.

About It/s M. to the N. of the landing-place at Hagg-Kandii
are the ruins of the city. The position of the PALACE OT? AMEN-
orms IV. is indicated by a house (known to the Arabs as el-Ken'iseh)
erected by Prof, Flindcrs Petrie to protect the sumptuousiy painted
*stucoo Pavements, which he discovered in the course of his ex-
anvatious in 1591-92. There are four pavements, two in each room
of the protective house. The let Pavement (in the first room),
which originally decorated a hall of the harem borne by twelye
columns, is divided into two sections by a -1 -shaped band of cap-
tive Asiatios and negroes and bows [ emblematic of the so-called
'nine nations of archers', the hereditary foes of Egypt ], which the
king thus trod under foot as he passed through the hall. In the
centre of each section is a rectangular pond with water-plants and
tislies, surrounded by a thicket of marsh-plants, representing the
banks of the pond, enlivened with birds and animals. This thicket
was interrupted by the columns, the traces of which are quite
distinct. The entire pavement was surrounded with a border of
painted vases and bouquets of flowers. - The 2nd Pavement, in
the same room, is in poor preservation, though ornamental vases
and bouquets may be distinguished. - The *3rd Pavement (in the
second room) is the finest. It also is divided into two symmetrical
halves by a central band of bows and captives. On each side, in
the ttentre, is a pond surrounded by a border of marsh-plants and
animals (interrupted by the columns), while at the sides (beyond
the columns ] is a second similar border. The whole pavement,
like, No. 1, is surrounded with a border of vases and nosegays. The
calves frisking in the marshy thicket are admirably drawn and
highly lifelike in their movements. The hall to which this pare-
ment belonged had sixteen columns, the bases of three of which
are still in position. - The 4th Pavement resembles the others in
arrangement but is in inferior preservation.

The second room of this house contains also a few architectural frag-
ments found among the ruins of the palace, including a portion ofa
palm-column; three fine alalraetur reliefs'en ereux' of captives; a fragment
of a relief of the king worshipping the sun, etc.

To the S. of the protective house are remains of large colomiades
belonging to the paiane. - To the E. lay the Library, in which the
celebrated tablets of Tell e1-'Amama with cuneiform inscriptions
(p. IU') were found.

To the N.E. was the Great Temple, now almost completely
ruined; the square brick pillars of one of the large halls may still
be clearly seen
