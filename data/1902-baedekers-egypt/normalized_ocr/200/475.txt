Aphroditopolis, capital of the tenth unme of Upper Egypt.

571/2 M. Akhmim, a steamboat and mail station 011 the E.
bank, also reached. from Sohég by a shorter land-route, is a thriving
little town with 28,000 inhab., including 8000 Copts. The weekly
market on Wed. is much frequented, and the bazaar is wel1-stoekei1.
The numerous cotton mills produce the cloth for the blue shirts of
the feilihin and for the long shield, (pl. shduit), or shawls with fringes,
which the poorer classes wear on state oreasions and for protection
against cold. Akhmim stands on the site of Khemmis or Panopalis,
which was the capital of a separate Home. The Egyptians named it
Epu and also Jrhenté-hfirs, after its god, the ithypheilic Min (p. exxvi),
whence proceed the Coptic Shmin and the Arabic Ahhmim.

Herodotus fu, 91) distinguishes the citizens of Khemmis as the only
Egyptians who favoured Greek customs and relates that they erected a
temple to Perseus, worshipped him with Heilenic rites, and held games
in his honour. The citizens claimed Perseus as a native of their town
and told the garrulous italicamassian that he had visited Khemmis, when
on bis way to Libya in pursuit of the Burgun's head, and had recognised
them as bis kinsmen A statue of him stood in the temple, From time
to time the hero revisited Khemmis, leaving, as a. sign of his presence
ll sandal, two em lung; the timliug of this was considered a portent at
good fortune. - Strabo mentions thcweevers and stone-cutters of Peuopnlis.
- Khemmis still fhrarishci1 in the Roman period, and its a_ncient and
famous temple was finally completed in the 12th year of TraJen. After
Christianity established itself here the vicinity of Pannpolisbeeeme crowded
with etmvents. Ncstovit1s, Bishop of Constantinople, who had been banished
to the oasis of Hibeh (Khirgeh) on accuunt of his disbelief in the divine
mntherhuud of the Virgin Mary, was attacked them by the plundering
Blemmycs, and carried captive into the Thehaid, where be surrendered
himself to the prefect of Panopolis, to avoid a charge ofwilful flight. 1Je
died in Pauopolis-Aklunim. Even after the conquest of Egypt by Islam
the temple of the'great town" of Akhmim was, as Abulfeda and other
Arabs relate, among the most important remains of the days of the Pharaehs.
The temple ruins now lie outside the town, to the N. The temple was
dedicated to Min (Pan), the town-gnd Of one of these temples the only
remains are a few stones of the 18th Dynasty and some scanty fragments
of a building of the Ptolemnic and Roman period. These are reached by
the water when the Nile overflows its banks and are gradually being
swept away. The second temple, farther to the N.VV.. built, uecordiug to
the above-mentioned inscription, under Trajan, is rupresented by at few
blocks only.
