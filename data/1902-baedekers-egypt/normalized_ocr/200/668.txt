(PL l), adorned with reliefs. On the back-wall of the second are
two lions sitting face to face; above them is a baboon (Thout)
worshipping the goddess Tefnut (in the form of a lioness); higher
up are two ibises.

. The SANCTUARY (P1. E), in which fragments of the granite shrine
still lie on the ground, is embellished with reliefs by an m1identitierl
emperor, who appears in them before various deities. In the rear-
wall are a door (of later construction ] and two windows, surmounted
by the winged sun-disk. On the outside of this wall was a large
door-shaped recess, containing a relief of Thont of Pnubs.

On the E. bank, nearly opposite Dakkeh, lies the village of
'11bbitn, with the ruins of a Fortress of the Middle Empire. This
was enclosed by a lofty wall of sun-dried bricks, mats, and wooden
logs, and was defended by a ditch. Within the S.E.'ang1e of the
wall lay a small temple. - Adjacent are two almost completely
demolished Temples, one to the 8., the other to the N. of the village.
Near the former is a Cistem hewn in the rock, to the E. of which are
several tombs of the Middle Empire, excavated in the ground.

From Jiubb'sin a route led through the extensive dei'Aut.ki to the
numerous guld-miues there, which were worked until the middle ages.

Granite mortars and mills and other apparatus used in the search for gold
are still to be seen, especially in the midi Khawanib.

At (38 M.) Kurteh, on the W. bank, are the ruins of a small
temple, dedicated to Isis, ou the site of an earlier shrine of the
Middle Empire. - In the river lies the large and well-w1tivatal
island of Derdr, known also as Gtziret Jfurteli. Opposite the S. end
of this island, and to the S. of the hamlets of Ofeduineh and Birbek,
lies the Temple of Ofeduineh, also called Temple of Mahetaka. This
marks the site of the aneient town of Hiertrsykatttinoe, which lay on
the extreme boundary of the Egyptian kingdom under the Ptolemies
and the Romans. The now mach mined temple dates from the
Roman period, but it was left unfinished and never fully decorated
with reliefs; it was dedicated to Isis and Serepis. The only remeim
now left are those of a rectangular court, which was surrounded
on three sides by covered colonnades. The main axis of the court
runs E. and W.; the entrance is on the E. side. No columns are now
standing except five on the S. side, once connected with each other
by screen-walls. In the ICE, corner is a remarkable spiral staircase
of masonry, which led to the roof of the aulonnade. - About 16 ft.
to the E. of this court are the ruins of another building, of which
only the rear-wall is now erert. On the outer side of this are several
reliefs and inscriptions, notably a relief in the Greek style repre-
senting Isis recumbent beneath the sacred fig-tree. Upon the tree
perches a hawk, while another hovers above; a man, bearing the lock
of youth, presents a vessel to the goddess, and above to the left
appear Min, Isis, and Serapis. The same scene is repeated on a
smaller scale, below, to the right. On the ground near the temple
are heaps of poteherds of the Byzantine period.
