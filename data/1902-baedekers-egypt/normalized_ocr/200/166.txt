ALEXANDRIAN ART. cle

its monumental creations, of which scanty relics only are now extant,
Alexandriau sculpture was wonderfully prulitio in genre composi-
tions and decorative carvings. The extant sculptures may he easily
divided into three classes according to their style. The first class
oomprises the works of native artists affected by Greek influence,
who adhere in general to the traditional canon, but display a. purer
taste in the treatment of the face and in the attitude and modelling
of the figure. Thus the colossal statue of a Macedonian king [ said
to he Alexandern0, which was found in the temple-precincts at
Kamak and is now in the Museum of Gizeh, is exeeuted, as regards
its general arrangement, in conformity with the ancient Egyptian
scheme of statues, while its thee and hair axe treated in a freer
manner. Two other specimens of this art are to be seen in the
vestibule to the innermost tornb-tharnber in the great tomb at Kiim
esh-Shuh√©fa (p. 12); another is the colossal head of a Ptolemy,
treated in the Egyptian style (K. in Room V of the Museum at
Alexandria) The Egyptian sculptor of the portrait-statue of a native
scribe found at Alexandria (No. 294 in the Gizeh Museum, p. 90)
has gone still further. Not only has he ahendoned the crouching
posture traditional for such subjects, but he has also imitated as
closely as possible the Cheek style in the attitude, the shape of the
head, and the folds of the drapery; though at the same time the
stiftuess of the position, and still more the pillar at the back with its
hieroglyphic inscription, clearly announce the origin of the artist.
A smaller group of statues and reliefs are apparently the works of
Greek immigrants, who brought with them, and practised unchanged,
an art acquired abroad, and mainly inspired by Athenian ideals.
Examples of this Alexandrian'Ideal 8tyU' are to be seen in the
splendid Head ofa Gaul in the Gizeh Museum (Room XL, No. 291),
which deviates considerably in style from the well-known realistic
Gauls' heads of the Pergamenian school; a sepulel1ral Stale in the
same Museum (Room XL, No. 289); the fine seated Statue of Hercu-
les in the vestibule of the Alexandrian Museum; the Head of
Hercules (Case J, Room XVI), and numerous other specimens in
the same museum. A curious weakening of this ideal style, due to
the neW material, appears in sculptures carved in limestone quarried
at Meks near Alexandria or in the shell-limestone of the Mokatgam
hills near Cairo. The most interesting specimen of this is a group
of a mourning woman and child in the Alexandria Museum (0;
Room IV). The most important achievement of this school was the
ahove-mentioncd colossus of Serapis in the Serepeum at Alexandria,
the work of a sculptor named Bryaris, who seems to have been an
immigrant from Carin; and this may still be reconstructed in its
details with the help oi'numerous larger or smaller copies. The
colossus represented the mysterious deity sitting on a throne, with
Cerberus by his side, and crowned with the corn-meesure, the em-
blem "truitfulness. The grave countenance framed with flowing
