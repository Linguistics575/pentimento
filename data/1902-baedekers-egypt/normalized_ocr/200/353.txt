120 Route 8. SECOND PYRAMID. Pyramids

the lid of which had disappeared before the time of the French
expedition (p. 116). Length 772 ft., width 3 ft. 3111., height 3 ft.
4 inches. The very massive sides ring with a clear tone when struck.
Curiously enough, the King's Chamber does not lie exactly in aline
with the diagonal of the Pyramid, but is 16 ft. 4 in. to the S. of it.

The Air Shafts (P1. J, H), the ends of which are seen about
3 ft. above the floor of the chamber, were perhaps constructed from
religious motives. They are about 6 in. in height and 8 in. in width
only, expanding by a few inches at the outer extremities. The N,
shaft is 236 ft., and the S. shaft 174 ft. long.

We now retrace our steps, and, on emerging from these awe-
inspiring recesses, hail the light and air with no little satisfaction.

The other chambers in the interior of the Great Pyramid as yet dis.
covered are inaeeeesible. The first passage 2, b, v, which is blocked at b,
leads downwards in a straight line, 293 ft. in Ieagth, and terminates in a
horizontal corridor, 27 ft. in length, 3ft. in height, and 2ft. in width,
which leads to the unfinished subterranean chamber 5, hewn in the rock.
The E. and W. sides of this chamber are each M) ft. in length, the N.
and S. sides 27 ft., and the height 101/s ft. It does not lie in a line
with the diagonal of the Pyramid, and its floor ie10Wsft.be1ow the
love ] on which the Pyramid is built. The subterranean horizontal pass-
ugc l, $ 0 ft. long, ends in a cul-de-sae. The statement of Herodotus that
the subterranean ehamher planned by Kheops for the reception of his
body was surrounded by a canal enudneted hither from the Nile, is ee
mucous, es the chamber lies above the highest level of the overflow of
the river, and it has, moreover, been ascertained that no channel from the
river ever led in this direotioa. - From the lower end of the Great Hall
a shaft, discovered hy Davison in 1763, descends to the lower passage,
and is erroneously known as the'Well'. The enterprising Caviglie found
that it terminated in the passage leading to the subterranean chamber CN.
To an appearance it was bored through the masonry after the latter had
been finished.

The Second Pyramid, called by the Egyptians Wer- Khafr?
('Great is Khafré'), was erected by Khafré, who was called Khephren
by the Greeks (p. luix ], but his name has not been discovered on
any part of the structure. Owing to the greater height of the rocky
plateau on which it stands, it appears higher than its larger neigh:
hour. The perpendicular height of this Pyramid is now 4471/2 ft.
[ formerly 454 ft.), each side of the base measures 690% ft. (orig-
inally 7073/4 ft), amt the height of each sloping side is 5631/3 ft.
(originally 5721/2 ft.), while the sides rise at an angle of 525W.
The solid content of the masonry is now 2,156,960 cubic yds., equi-
valent to 4,883,000 tons in weight (originally 2,426,710 cub. yds.,
equivalent to 5,309,000 tons). As the rocky site rises towards the
W. and N., a considerable part of it required to be removed in or-
der that a level surface might be obtained. The levelled space sur-
rounding the base of the Pyramid was paved with blocks of lime-
stone (see p. 126). To the E. are remains of the temple erected for
the worshippers of the deceased Pharaoh, a structure of the kind
which probably adjoined all pyramids (pp. 124, 127). The iucrusm-
tion of the Pyramid, which must have been preserved almost intact
