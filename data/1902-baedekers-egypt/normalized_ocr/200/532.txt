Temple of Ammon. THEBES (E. BANK). 2d. Route. 253

its Vestibule still projects. On the rear of the S. tower (Pl. o is a
long inscription (unfortunately imperfect at the top), recording the
gifts of Amenophis III. to the god Ammon; end on the rear of the
N. tower (Pl. m) are seen the last remnants of a larger represen-
tation of a festal voyage, in the shape of a sacred bark of Ammon
with the king on board and another fully manned ship.

On passing through the third pylon into the Central Court
we come first upon an Omaasz, the last survivor of four, erected 111
pairs by Thutmosis I. It Is 76 ft. high and stands upon a' base 6 ft.
square. On each face of the obelisk are three verlieel inscriptions,
the central one being the Jedieatory inscription of Thutmosis L,
and the other two additions by Ramses IV. and Ramses VI. The
bases of the other obelisks are adjacent. The obelisks marked the
entrance to the temple in the reign of Thutmosis I.

A deviation mey here be made to inspect the Hixtorical Relief; on the
exterior walls of the great hypostyle hall (comp. p. 251)

Next i'ollows Pylon W, in a most ruinous condition, beyond
which are the scanty remains of the First Colonnade, originally
embellished with columns and eo1ossa1 statues of Osiris. Within
this colonnade rose the two great OBELISKS of Queen Maker√©, made
of tine pink granite from Assain, and covered at the apex with
electrum (a mixture of gold and silver). The Right Obelisk has been
overthrown, and the top has fallen some distance to the N. The
*Left Obelisk, still standing, is 97% it. high and its diameter at
the base is 81/2 ft; it is the tallest obelisk known, with the exee
tion of that in the piazza in front of! the Lateran at Rome, which is
105 ft. high. The inscriptions record that the obelisks were made
in 7 months. Originally there was only the customary single ver-
tical inscription on each face; but afterwards, on the upper parts
reliefs were added, showing Makere, Thutmosisl., and Thutmosis IL
srterificing to Amman. The names and figures of Ammon were ob-
literated by Amenophis IV., but restored by Sethos I.

This Colonnade underwent various transformations under the 18th Dy-
nasty. When Thutmusis I. built it originally it had two rows with tive
columns in each to the left, and two with six columns in each to the
right, supporting roofs. When Makers erected the ebelisks in the 16th
year of her reign, the columns to the right and two pairs of those to the
im Were removed. Thutmesis III. surrounded the obeliske with a sand-
stone structure which concealed more than half of them, and portions of
which still remain. Finally underAmenophis u, the right half of the colon-
nade was restored and six pairs of papyrus-columns were erected, of
Which, however, only the stumps are now left.

As we proceed towards the E., we pass the Fifth Pylon, also
erected by Thutmosis 1., which forms the baek-wall of the colonnade
just described, and enter a Second Colonnade, another erection
of Thutmosis I. This colonuade had sixtetm-sided columns bat is
now much ruined. On each side of the central passage Thutmosis III.
constructed two ehambers, with a granite gateway (restored by
Sethos L) between. Beyond this gateway rises the Sixth Pylon,
