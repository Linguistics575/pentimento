Cxxxviii HISTORY OF ART.

burned bricks of Nile mud; the roofs were made of slender wooden
beams, covered with straw "reeds and daubed within and without
with Nile mud; the columns were either of stone, of mud, or of
wood, and in palates were inlaid with coloured stones or glass-paste.
Uolour was also extensively used in the interiors; the walls were
whitewashed and adorned with bright-eoloured rugs or with paint-
ings, and even the pavements were covered with coleuring matter.

A considerable number of FORTIFIBD STRUCTURES have been
preserved. Amongst these may be mentioned the Nubian castles to
the S. ofwidi Ilalfa and the Egyptian Castles "El-KÃ©b and ILhn
el-Abrnar, the most of which probably date from the period of the
Middle Empire.

As taxes and salaries were paid in kind, large MAGAZINES were
required for the reception of tribute, not only by the state but also
by tcmples. The remains of such storehouses have been found
beside the 1lamesseurrt (p. 287), at Tell el-Maskhf1.ta (p. 163), and
elsewhere.

Probably in no other country have so many Temples within such
narrow limits survived from antiquity as in Egypt. Most of these,
it is true, date from the New Empire and the Ptolemaio epoch, so
that we have a clear conception of the temples of these periods only.
ii'ew or 110 complete temples have survived from the Ancient or
Middle Empires "from the late-Egyptian period.

Amoag the TEMPLES or THE ANCIENT EMPIRE the first plate is
held by the Sanctuary afthe Sun at Abu Gurib, erected by King Ra-
n-woser (p. 129), and excavated in 1899 by Borehardt and Schaefet.
This temple resembles those of later periods in having Its interior
walls embellished with reliefs and inscriptions. Praotioally nothing
new remains of the small Temples beside the second and third pyr-
amids at Gizelz, where the memes ot' the kings buried in those pyr-
amids were worshipped; but Fiinders Petrie's discovery of the
Temple beside the pyramids of Meidt'tm affords us a clear idea of
such a sanctuary at the earliest period (1). 192). Here the walls are
absolutely bare and the architectural forms of the severest simplic-
ity. It is very questionable whether, as was at one time supposed,
the Granite Temple, beside the great Sphinx (p.124), and the small
Temple, near the Birket Karim (p. 181), really belong to the period
of the Ancient Empire.

The remains of the TEMPLes or THE MIDDLE EMPIRE are even
scentier. Large sanctuaries, little inferior in size to those "later
times, IN are built during this period at Luxor, Karnak, Koptos, Abydos,
Hawftra (the sevcalled Labyrinth ], Jllahtln, Medlnet el-Faylim, Be
Liopalis, Bubastis, and Tunis; but none has left euy considerable

the Hyksos supremacy and were replaced under the 18th Dyn. by
new buildings, in which the materials of the earlier iydifltws were
utilized as far as possible. Their inner walls were decorated, us in
