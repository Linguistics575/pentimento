xxvi HEALTH RESORTS.

provided with one for his Joins, another for his shoulders, and a
third for his head. The slippers or pattens are then put on, and the
anteehamber re-er1tered. When the l.cabrtibs are removed, cold water
is sprinkled over the feet, fresh towels are then provided, and the
bather at last throws himself down on his divan, wonderfully re-
freshed, yet glad to enjoy perfect repose for a short tlme. This
interval of tranquil enjoyment is the favourite Oriental'key' [ i.e.
luxurious idleness ]. Every bath contains a coffee and pipe establish-
ment. Coffee and hot eau sucre'a are the favourite beverages. Before
dressing, the bathe: is generally provided with two or three more
relays of fresh towels. The whole of these operations need not 00-
eupy much more than an hour, but Orientals often devote a whole
morning to the bath. - Many of the baths are charitable founda-
tions, where the natives pay little or nothing. Europeans are ge nerally
expected to pay 8 piastres or more (including coffee and nargileh ],
and a fee of about 1 pias. is given to the'soap man'.

(10). Egypt as a Health Resort. Medical Hints.

The btynefioia1 infh1ene, e of the climate of Egypt has been known
since the Roman period at least, and of late years on increasing
number of visitors have fToiyked to the Nile to enjoy the benefits
of its remarkably dry winter-erunate. Phthisis (in certain cases),
asthma, chronic bronchitis, Brigl1t's disease, rheumatoid arthritis,
gout, insomnia, dyspepsia1 and mental strain are some of the most
important ailments that are at least alleviated by a visit to Egypt.
In deciding which ofthe health-resorts in Egypt a given case should
be sent to, the physician must of course consider whether or not
warmth must be secured. along with dryness of air, whether purity
of air alone or also a bright stimulating climate is to be specially
sought, and whether cold winds are harmful or not. Invalids who
have not been ordered to a particular health-resort before leaving
home should consult a physician immediately on arriving in Egypt;
and it is advisable in all cases to secure the advice of the physician
resident at the spot selected.

It is now generally understood that Cairo cannot properly be JO0-
sidered .1 health-resort. The presence of a large city with its noise
and bustle, its situation, exposed to the influence of a wind coming
from the N. over the broad cultivated Delta, the unhealthy saturation
in the early part of winter of considerable low-lying tracts of the
town composed of old rubbish, and the higher relative humidity, all
combine to compel those who seek health from the climate of Egypt
to look to other stations. There are, however, excellent health-re-
sorts in the immediate vicinity of the capital1 vis. Mena House Hotel,
and especially Helwfm. Luxor and Assufm, in Upper Fugypt, omyr still
more favourable climatic conditions. There is at least one English
physician M each of these four stations. The hotels at all are ex-
