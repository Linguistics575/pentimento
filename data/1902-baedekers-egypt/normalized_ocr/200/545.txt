of this part are of the time of Ramses IL, and far inferior to those
of the central building and left-hand portion of the sanctuary.

We re-enter the colonnade through Door c, and proceed through
Door fl to visit the LEFT DIVISION ofthe temple. In the small CHAPEL
0F RAMSES I. (with two papyrus-bud eolumns), are high reliefs,
which were probably "usurped' by Ramses 11.: to the right the king
kneeling before Ammori, Khons, and the deitted Sethos, while
behind him is Mut. - Adjoining are three CHAMBERS (PLA, B, C).
0n the side-walls ot' the central chamber (Pl. A) Sethos I. offers
incense to the boat of Ammon. On the rear-wall is a door-shaped
stele to Ramses II. The two other rooms (P1. B and C) were built
by Ramses II. and contain rather rude reliefs (the king before the
gods). - A side-door (P1. l) leads from the Chapel of Ramses I. to
a narrow Corridor, the left wall of which is now represented by a
single course of masonry. Thence we enter (to the right) ROOM D,
with sunk reliefs dating from Ramses 11., showing that king and his
father Sethos slMrrifieing before various deities. - A small Door
(Pl. m) at the end of the corridor brings us owe more into the
nolonnade.

A little to the N. of the temple is a spring with a water-wheel
(S & kiyeh) and some tsunt. trees, used as a watering-place for cattle.
Farther to the N., among the spurs of the Libyan mountains, is the
Neoropolis of Drab Abu't Negga.

Drah Abu'l Negga is one of the oldest cemeteries nfThehes, and the
treasures discovered here by Irariette's excavations were of extraordinary
value. Tombs of the 11th, 13th, and 17th Dynasties were discovered here,
but they have all been destroyed. The Rock Tombs 0n the hill-slope of
Drall Abu'l Negga are more interesting. Immediately behind the last
houses in the village of Kurna, is the Tomb of Web-a1mors, dating from the
beginning of the New Empire, with tasteful stucco reliefs of vintage and
funeral scenes. A hole in this tomb is the only access to the adjacent
Tam!) of Jfent-aersghopshef, royal faa-bearer. 0f the two chambers here
one has been til1.ed up by e landslip. The very fine reliefs of the other

represent bavial-geer1e8 and funeral saeritioes. - Farther to the N, is the
unfu1ishisd Tomb of Ramos√©, an architect.

4. Bibtsn e1-N11IU. Tombs of the Kings.

The Tomas OF THE KINGS AT Bi's'as 1-sL-3Ims0s belong to the 18~20th Dyn-
asties, and, in contrast to the pyramids that mark the graves of kings
up to the beginning of the New Empire, consist of series of passages and
chambers hewn in the rock. Like the corridors within the pyramids they
Were intended only for the reception of the sarcophagus; the temples
dedicated to the munes of the deceased, in which the olIerings to the dead
were made, were built in the plain.

The Smuurunn of the tombs is przustically the same in all. Three
Curridore, placed one beyond the other led into the innermost reeesses.
Small side-chambers sometimes opened ik the first corridor; oblong recesses
were made at the top of the sides of the second; and small recesses for
the reception of the furniture of the dead were provided at the end of
the third, A door led from the third corridor into an Anteraum, baynnd
which lay the Main Hall, where, in a hollow in the Mor, the heavy
granite sarcophagus was deposited. The main hall, the roof of which
