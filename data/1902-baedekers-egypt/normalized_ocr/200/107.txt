HISTORY.

Louis IX., the Saint, of France undertook the Sixth Crusade,
marched against Egypt, took Damietta, but was captured
along with his army at Mansj1ra, and was only released
on payment of a heavy ransom (p. 158).

BAr.uul's MAMELUKE SULTANS. The first of these monarchs
was hfu'iss Eibek.

Bibars, one of the ablest of this dynasty, annihilated theisst
remnants of the kingdom of Jerusalem in the course of
four campaigns. He brought to Cairo the last represents
tive ot' the'Abbaside khalifs, who had been overthrown by
the Mongols and expelled fromBagdid, and permitted him
and his successors nominally to occupy the throne.

1.ra1iritzl, el-Mm.s0r Kaléan (p. 59), succeeded to the exolu-
sion of a youthful son of Bibsrs, successfully opposed the
Mongols, and entered into treaties with the Emperor Ilu-
dolph and other European princes.

El-Ashraf Khalil captures'Akks [ Acre ], the last plseeiu
the Holy Land held by the Christians.

NL.sir, Mohammad era-N/ith ibn Kaldlin (p. 33), succeeded
his brother Khalil at the age of nine years, but owing to
internal disseusions was compelled to retire to Syria.
With the aid ofthe Syrian emits, however, he regained
his throne. Distrust, vindictiveness, and cupidity soon
showed themselves to beprominent characteristics of Nis.ir,
who treated his emits with the utmost capriciousness,
loading them with rich gifts or ordering them to exe0u-
tion as the humour seized him. The emir Isma'il AMAidd,
known also as a historian, succeeded, however, in retain-
ing his master's favour till the time of his death. Towards
the mass of the population Nisir was liberal and conde-
scending, and towards the clergy indulgent. In order to
provide the enormous sums required (or the expenses of
his court and his love of building, he appointed Christian
offioials in the custom-house and tinamye departments.

Hasan, Melilc en-Norir Abu'l-hfari0itlawn t'bnr.ftrltitin (p.49),
the sixth sou ofNésir, was still a minor when he ascended
the throne. The lawless independence of the Mamelukes
and emits was aggravated by a plague in i318-49 which
exterminated whole families, whose property was imme-
diately seized by the government. After having been de-
throned in 1351, Hasan xegained his sosptre three years
later, bat in 1361 he was assassinated

UIRUASSIAN MAMELUKE SULTANS (Borgites). The founder of
this dynasty was -

in xaising himself to the throne by setting aside Hagyi, a
