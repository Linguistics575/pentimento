Eastern Desert. tios.'iut. 30. Route. 317

In the Ptolemaic period the desert-mute ended at the Leukoa Limm
er'White Harbour', and in earlier times in the vicinity of the Wtidi
Gums, near the village of Suuw, a little to the N. of Kueér. About
3 or 4 M, to the N. oflio, sér lies Old Fo.str, with some scanty an-
cient remains.

In going from 1505M towards the Nile the Beduins sometimes prefer
another and more southerly route than that through the Wadi Hammibnit.
This diverges from the route above described at the Bir el-Be'da' [ see above)
and leads at first through the winding wad; Kabr el-li'hddim, afterwards
passing the Gabe! Wtt? .tds and through the pass'of Brat el-Ghazzil into the
Wtidi Ghazdl To the right rise the conical GeI/el Daghaniyeh and Gabe!
3foshiighir. We next follow the Wadi Hamada, which farther on takes the
name of dei el-Ijomr from the flue Gabe! J.lome, Whiuh Gaks it on the
right, The night is spent at BO "3fo'r7a, a well beside a few huts of the
'Ababdeh. At the t7ebel Wdlaf We cross the Twit ed-dahrdwi, a road
running from N. to 5., and farther on reach'Armira, with another Well
and more'Ababdeh hats. Thence our route lies through the midi Nity
and the deiKesh to the Bir el-Kash, a dried-up well, beyond which we
pass numerous quarries of green breccia. Beyond the passes of Ri'at el-
Kha (sandstone formation) and Rim el~1_lamre we reach the Mahwala (see
p. 345) of RM d.tmr, whenee we go un through the deiMdghla; to Mute
wamt Khie el-Ghir. Lastly we proceed vii thihrat eforrb'st to Lakiga (p. 345),
Where our route unites with the more northerly one already described.

The Jovnxuy TO Barman ]: through the territory of the'Ahabdeh Beduins
is seldom undertaken. We may start from Keneh or Kuptos, diverging at
Lalgeta from the route to Iroyhr, or we may begin at apoint opposite Edfu
(Contra-Apollinopolis) or Redésiyeh (p. 319). On both routes traces of old
watering stations are discernible. The Itinerary of Antonine (3rd cent.
A.D.) gives a list of the ancient stations (starting Horn Koptos ] with their
distance from each other in Roman miles, as follows: Phamicou 24, Di-
dyme 24, Afrodito 20, Eompusi 22, Jovis 23, Aristoru's 25, Phalacl'o 25,
Apollonos 23, Kuhelsi 2r, Kmnon Hydreuma 27, Berenike 18 - in all 258
Roman miles = about 236 English miles. - A third route, established
by Hadrian, led from Antinoupolis fp. 201) to the Red Sea, and then
southwards along the coast to Berenike.

aoleroishur, the Russian Eg ptologist, who described his journey in
the'Iiccueil de n-avaux relatix's 21 la philolngie /tvptierme' (1889), took
11 days from Redesiyeh (p. 319) to Berenike, and returned thence to
Assuin in S days.

lst Day. Bir .Allbtld (3 hrs), in the Wddi Midfl. The Wadi Jriiilt is
entered opposite the mouth of the Wadi Ammeribbe. This is an ancient
station with quarry-marks like those at et-Hésh, near Silsileh (p. 319).
Lepsius mentions a ruin here, named Herhmh (122, sandstone), dating from
some ancient settlement.

2nd Day. Temple of Sethos I, The Temple was discovered in 1316 by
ihtiuiated, On his first journey to the mines of Mt. Zubdru- It was built
by Sethos l, beside a water-station either constructed or restored by that
king, and was dedicated to Ammon-RE. The vestibule is built of blocks
of sandstone and is supported by 4 columns with lotns-'capitalst The
reliefs represent the kill" as victor over negroe: and ASiatics. - Turs
following inner ahambe F are entirely hewn out of the rock The iirst
HALL contains 4 square pillars. Long inscriptions on each side of the
entrance record the sinking of the wells and the building of the temple
0n the side-walls the king is shown "rsrif'scing to the varith gods wor-
Fhipped in the temple. In the rear-wall are threehiches, with statues of
the king and various gods. - A Small Bur'ldmg bitsidt.tlys temple perhaps
marks the site of the Well sunk by Sethos. On an adjoining rock, to the
E, are three stelcs. On one of these is an Asiatic goddess on horseback,
with a shield in her left hand; the second is dedicated to the official
entrusted by Sethos with the sinking of the well; and on the third is the
