Nile. Towards the left are situated the Christian Cemeteries, sur-
rounded by lofty walls and presenting no attractions. The tlrst is the
English and Protestant Cemetery, the second the Roman Catholic,
beyond Which are those of the Greeks, Armenians, and Copts.
[ The railway-station of Fum e1-Khalig, mentioned at p. 154, lies
to the E)

To the left of the road, close to the Protestant cemetery and adjoining
the Armenian Church, lies the Dir Mari Menu. or convent of St. Nenass,
a brick-walled enclusure, recognizable by its domed sehil and containing
an ancient church dedicated to the saint Menas. _ About Vs M. further on,
near the Helwan railway-line, is the Dér Abu Sefén, named after the
largest, though not the oldest, church within its precincts. The tall window-
less walls, supported by massive buttresses, lend a highly picturesque air to
the convent, Which is best viewed from the S. The convent has a diameter
of 650 ft., and includes three churches (EIJAIIIV'LI, Anba Blretttldtt, and Aim
Sefin) end a nunnery (Dér et-Baadt). - Among the mound; of debris to the
E. of Old Cairo are several other Coptic convents (Dfr Babhtn, [ Mr Tudl'm,
Abe: Kir wa J'uhamm, etc.) which, however, are otinterest to specialists only.

TheHEAD or THE OLD AQURDUCT (Arab. Et-rpm/tir), Which sup-
plied the citadel with water before the completion ofthe new water-
works (pt 63j, rises about 100 yds. beyond the Fum el-Khstig.
It is constructed of solid masonry in a hexagonal form, and has
three stories, about 150 ft. in diameter.

The road continues to follow the direction of the arm of the
Nile, which, however, is generally concealed by the houses and
walls of the Manjal quarter, and reaches CIM.) the mansion which
formerly belonged to 8ute" rniin Pasha er-Fransiiuri Ol. 1861; visitors
not admitted). -

The first narrow and short road to the right beyond the "lui-
teen leads to the ferry crossing to the Island of 3691a (Geziret R5411).
We descend the slope, enter the ferry-boat (1 pies. for one person,
there and back; payment made on returning), ascend the opposite
path, and turn to the right. A guide is usually easily found to
conduct travellers through the intricate lanes to the garden at the
H. extremity of the island belonging to the heirs of Hasan Pasha.

At the S, end of the garden andisland is the NILOMETERNH ytish
constructed in A.D. 716 by order of the Omayyad Khslif Suhimin
(715-17) It consists of a square well, 16 ft. in diameter, hav-
ing in the centre am octagonal column7 on which are inscribed the
ancient Arabian measurest The dirt', or old Arabian ell, is "centi-
métres, or about 211/3 inches long, and is divided into 24 yirit, The
Ch1fi: inscriptions on the central column and on marble slabs built
into the walls refer to restorations of the Nilometer in the 9th cent.
after Christ, under the'Abbaside khalifs Mirndsn and Mutawakkil.
Numerous later restorations have also taken place, the lastin1803.
The oitiee of measuring the water is entrusted to a shékh.

The zen) poiat of the Nilumeter (according tu Nqrui'sd-Bey) is 25 ft.
above the average level of the Mediterranean, so that the top of the
column is nearly N) ft. above sea-level. The water of the Nile, when al

its lowest, covers 7 ells of the Nilumeter, and when it reaches a heighl
