HISTUIH _

mid Pasha formed a new ministry, the soul of which was
Arahi Bey, the energetic minister of war. This cabinet at
once proceeded, without receiving the consent of the Khe-
dive, to pass several measures intended to diminish the
European influence in the political and 1inaueia1 admin-
istration of the country. The Khedive, to whom both
France and England had promised protection, declared that
he would offer a determined resistance to the measures of
the cabinet. At the end of May the British and French
fleets made their appearance before Alexandria. In the
middle of June serious disturbances broke out in that
town, in the amuse of which many Europeans were killed,
while the others found refuge on board the ships. On
July 11th and 12th Alexandria was bombarded by the
British fleet, and on Sept. 13th the fortified camp of Arabi
at Tell el-lie) was stormed by a British force under Sir
Garnet Wolseley. Arabi and his associates were captured
and sent as exiles to Ceylon. Since these events British
inf1ueuee has been paramount in Egypt. In the autumn
of 1883 a widespread rebellion broke out among the Na-
bian tribes of the Sadin under the leadership of Muham-
med Ahmed, the so- called'Mahdi' (p. lxv ], which prov-
ed fatal to the Egyptian supremacy in the Sud'an. An
Egyptian army 0f10,000 men under an Englishman named
Hinks Pasha was annihilated in Nam, 1883, by the Mahdi's
fotces, and a second expedition of 3500 regular troops of
the Egyptian army, led by Baker Pasha, was' also completely
defeated at Tom: in February, 1884. On the 18th of the
same month General Gordon, who had been Governor
General of the StWul in 1877-79, after a perilous ride
morass the desert, entered Kharttun, which he had unter-
taken to save from the Mahdi; while on Mar. lst audMar.
13th the rebel tribes under the Mahdi's lieutenant Osman
Digna were defeated at El-Teb and Tamanieb by the
British troops under Graham. The Mahdi himself, how-
er, still maintained his position near Kharttnn, and towards
the close of the year a second British expedition [ of 7000
men) was sent out under Wulseley to resmle Gordon.
Wolseley selected the tedious and laborious Nile route for
this expedition in preference to the shorter but more dau-
gerous desert route from Suikin to Berber. An advanced
brigade under General Stewart was, however, sent on from
Eorti at the beginning of 1885, which accomplished its
march across the Baytida Desert [ see Map, p. xxx) with
cumplete success, gaining severely contested victories over
large bodies of the Mahdi's followers at Abti Ktea (Jan.
17th) and at a point near Metemmeh (Jan. 19th). Stewart,
