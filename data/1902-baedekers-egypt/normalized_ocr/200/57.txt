mostcommonly employed as doorkeepers (bawwdb), as house-servants
(khadddm), as grooms and runners (561's), for which their swiftness
renders them unrivalled, as coaehmen ('arbagi), and as cooks (.tabbali).
Each of these five classes is admirably organised as a kind of guild,
with a shékh of its own, who levies a tax from each member, and
guarantees the character and abilities of members when hired. Thefts
are very rarely committed by the Nahians, but in cases of the kind the
shékh compels the whole of his subjects to contribute to repair the
loss, and cases have been known in which several hundred pounds
have been recovered in this way. The result is that there is a
strict mutual system of supervision, and suspected characters are
uneeremoniously excluded from the fraternity. Nubian women are
seldom seen in Egypt except as slaves.

(6.) SUDAN NEGROES. Like the lierbers, most of the uegroes in
Egypt are professors of Fil-Islivrn, to the easily intelligible doctrines
of which they readily and zealously attach themselves. Most of the
older negmes end negresses with whom the traveller meets have
originally been brought to Egypt as slaves, and belong to natives,
by whom they are treated more like members of the family than
like servants. Although every slave Who desires to be emancipated
may now with the aid of government sever the ties which bind him
to his master, most of the uegroes prefer to remain on the old foot-
ing with the family which supports them and relieves them of the
anxiety of providing for themselves. The eunuchs7 who also belong
almost exclusively to the negro races, but are rapidly becoming
rarer, very seldom avail themselves of this opportunity of regaining
their liberty, as their emancipation would necessarily terminate the
life of ease and luxury in which they delight. Under the present
government slavery is very rapidly approaching complete extinction
in Egypt, ehielly in consequence of changes in the mode of living,
and the growing preference of the wealthy for paid servants. - The
negroes who voluntarily settle in Egypt, constituting a body of (Hut-
siderahle size, form the dregs of the people and are employed in the
most menial oifiees.

Most of the negro- races of Central Africa to the N. of the
equator are represented at Cairo, particularly in the rank and file of
the negro regiments.

(7). TURKSi Although the dynasty of the vieeroys of Egypt is
of Turkish origin (see p. xcviii), a comparatively small section of the
community belongs to that nation. According to the census of 1897
there are 40,126 Turks in Egypt, but among these are reckoned
Turkish subjects from every part of the Ottoman empire. Only a
few are genuine Osmanlis. The Turks of Egypt are ehiefly to he found
in the towns, Where most of them are government oiNials, sohliers,
and merchants. The Turkish language is little understood in Egypt.

[ 8). LEVANTINES. A link between the various classes of dwellers
in Egypt and the visitors to the banks of the Nile is formed by the
