Another route, practicable in good weather but entirely depen-

This part of the Red Sea was long regarded as the'reedy sea' across

The Springs of Moses, Arabic'Ain (plural'Avtin) Mam, form
an oasis about tive furlongs in circumference, the property of
M. Costa (p. 172 ] and several Greek residents in Suez. The yege-
tation here is very luxuriant. Di-palms and vegetables are ry1l-
tivated by the Arabs, who receive oile-ltalr of the yield of dates as
their reward. Their gardens are enclosed by mud-walls and pal-
ings. The springs vary in temperature from 700 to 82Â° Fahr.; some
are only slightly brackish, while others are exceedingly salt. The
largest of them, in the garden farthest to the 8., is said to have
been the bitter spring which Moses sweetened by casting a certain
tree, into it. Beside it is an open colonnade in Which the traveller
may rest and partake of coffee offered by the Arabs.
