MEHALLET EL-KOBRK. :2. Route. 159

The sculptures (haestretiefs and reliefs Wh crew) are most elaborately
executed. Several of the female heads and busts, sud suute of the cows'
heads also. ere remarkably fine. The inscriptinns consist of the usual
formulae; none of them are historical. In some the 11ierogiyplsios are
unusually large, in others they are of small and elegant form, and in all
they are executed in the somewhat i1orid style peculiar tn the age of the
Ptolemies. On the W. side of the mine is an interesting large slab of
grey granite, veinetl with red, on which is represented the king offering
a gift of land to Osiris and Isis,'the great divine mistress'. Higher up
there is another block or grey granite, with e representation of Isis en-
throned, and of the king offering to'his mother' two small bags of mal-
achite and eye-paint. To the E. is another block of grey granite, with
reliefs. On a grey bleak of granite, lying in an oblique position, is re-
presented the sacred bark of Isis, resembling those seen elsewhere in
bronze only. The cabin is like B house of two stories, in the upper of
which sits the goddess, with cow's harm and a disk, on a lotus-tlower,
tmd attended on her right and left by winged goddesses. Ort the N. side
lies an unusually large Hethor capital, in granite. Numerous remains of
pillars and erehitraves also still exist.

0n the N.W. side of the ruins of the temple lies the village of
Behbit, and adjoining it still exists the sacred lake of the temple.
