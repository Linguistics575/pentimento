74 Route ii. OLD CAIRO. Environs

produces an imposing effect. The columns, all of marble of various
kinds, were once 366 in number. Their heterogeneous nature is
accounted for by the fact that they were brought from Roman and
Byzantine buildings in Cairo and were adapted to their new filmy-
tions by rude Procrustean methods of lengthening or shortening.

The facades of the Court (Salzn) have no pretensions to MI-
tiquity; the arches (many defective) are of a curious shape, which
it is d'rffieult to classify either as pointed, round, or horseshoe
shaped. The court itself is now planted with trees. In the centre
is a fountain, beside a palm-tree. The aSouth-Ecstern Liwcin is
the sanctuary. In front of the pulpit is a column of grey marble,
on which, by afreak of nature7 the names of Allah, Molrammed,
Mid Sultan Suleirnru in Arabic characters anul the outline of the
prophet's'kurbatslf appear in veins of a lighter colour. This column
is believed by the Muslims to have been transported miraculously
from Mecca to Cairo by the Khalif'Omar. In the N.E. corner is
the Tomb of Sheikh'Abdallah, son of "Amr. 1n the W. eolom1ade,
which consisted of a single row of columns only, a Pair ofColumns
alone remains. They are placed very close together. and it is said
that none but honest men could squeeze themselves between them.

This mosque is almost disused. On the last Friday in the mouth of
fasting, however, a solemn service is annually held here, in which the
Khedive and bis grandee" take part. 0n the remaining Fsidays throughout
fhe year a handful of poor Muslims, moslly of the wurkiug classes, assemble
ior worship in the venerable but poorly preserved sanctuary. - In 1808
this moeque witnessed a very remarkable scene. The whole of the Mu-
hummedau priesthood, the Christian clergy of every sect, and the Jewish
rabbis. with line aewrd, assembled in the mosquc of "Amr tu pray for the
rise of the File, which had delayed beyond the usual period.

The traveller will fiud it not uninteresting to visit one of the
Kulleh Ncmufrtetories on the M'. and S. sides of the mosque Cbalrshtsh,
a l'ew copper coins). The porous water-jars (Arabia Kulle/zl used
throughout the whole of Egypt are ol1iei1y manufactured at lieneh
in Upper Egypt of light-grey clay of very equal consistency. The
remarkably uniform and delicate porosity of the vessels is produced
by mixing the clay with ashes. The rapid evaporation caused by
the porosity of the kulleh cools the liquid within to a temperature
of 12-140 lower than that of the surrounding air.

A visit to the Tombs of the Mamelukes (p. 68) may be con-
veniently made hom this point. Continuing to follow the road
across the rulobigh-ldlls of Fostirt, we observe on our right a Mar.
lim burial-ground, and at a shoxt distance in front of us the old
aq11educt (p. 69). A little to the right, on an eminence, rises an
old ruined mosque { Gami'a AM Su'ad), beyond it is the Citadel
with the mosque of Mohammed'Ali, and farther distant are the
hills of the Moi am with the mosque of (Hyiisl1i (p. 108). This
view is very stri g towards sunset. The road, "hich becomes bad
beyond this point, leads round the ruined mosque aml ascends
