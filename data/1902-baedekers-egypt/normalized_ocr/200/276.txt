Quanm. CAIRO. 4. Route. 63

in 1799. These solidly built gates are, along with the Bib es-zuwis1eh
(y, 48), the only survivors ofthe sixty in the Fétimite walls of Cairo
and were erected by the vizier Bedr el-Gamili in the 11th century.
Their plan resembles that of ancient Roman gateways. Both have
an outer and an inner gate, flanked by square or round towers, and
united by means of a vaulted inner court.

In the Mohammedan cemetery outside the Bab en- -h'asr is buried Jo-
hama Ludwdg Bunkhmdt (11.1817), known to the Arabs as'Shékh Ibrahim,
the distinguished Oriental t1eveller, whose works are still of high author-
ity. - The two towers with iron basins, which we observe an the left,
belong to the City Water Wank, constructed in 1855- 66 and se\ eral GG
enlarged. The water is pumped up man the Nile by steam. - From the

We return from the B31) en-Nagr by the Shdrt'a Btl, en-Nair,
passing (right) the Okella of J.rtfit Bey (p. 68), one of the most
interesting secular structures in Cairo. Farther on, in the Sharia.
el- Gamaliyeh (P1. E, 3, 2), to the left, is the Conventual Mosque of
Sultan szars el- iriiiaU7r" diiii, with the tomb ofthe founder. We
next follow the 8enintyeh to the right to the Shiri'a en-Naltlnstn
and Khordagiyeh, the Sikkeh el-Gedideh, and the Muski (p.42).

The remaining features of the N. quarters are of little interest.
The principal thoroughfare is the Sharia or Boulevard Clot Bey CPI.
G, B, 2), which runs to the N.W. from the N.E. angle of the
Ezbekiyeh (p. 39), to the Lttnfn Bridge and the Railway Statiuns
(p. M). - In a side-street to the W. of the Shari'a Clot-Bey lies
the Chief Coptic Church (Pl. C, 2), recently built and dedicated
to St. Mark. The interior is architecturally uninteresting, but it is
well worth while to attend a Coptic service here (p. 71). Adjacent
are schools and the house of the Coptic Patriarch. - The open
'plaee' at the end of the Shiri'a Clot-Bey is known as the Bond
Point de Faggtila or Me" ddrs Bib el-lladid CPI. B, 2). At the end of
the Shirira Bib el-Hadid, which also leads hither from the W. side
of the Ezbekiyeh, is the handsome Sebtl of the Mother of Iama'ft
Pasha. (Pl. B, 2).
