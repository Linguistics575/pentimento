extra garment to take its place after exercise or when the air is
cooling, will be found a safeguard against chills. Most invalids
should notleave the hotel Cor, in certain cases, their bedrooms) before
:10 a. m., and then only to hetake themselves to some sunny corner.
The hour for coming into the hotel varies with the place and the
month, being earliest in Jan. and latest in March and April. If the
patient be guided by the relative humidity, it would be earliest at
Menu House, say about sunset; at little later at Helwén; at Luxor
still later, f) p. m. (except in Jan.), and 8 p. m. in March; and
latest of all at Assuin, - it being always understood that pre-
cautions as to extra clothing have been taken.--Those who are not
invalids, end even in some cases iuvalids also, may sleep with the
windows open with safety.

If a cold is caught it is apt to result in fever or in diarrhoea,
which may turn to dysentery. There are good chemists at Alex-
andria, Cairo, Luxor, and Assuén, from whom small medicine-
chests adapted for the climate may be purchased. The advice of
the traveller's physician at home will be useful in stocking such a
medieine-ehest. "serious cases of illness a European doctor, When
procurable, should always be consulted, as the traveiler's own es-
perienee acquired at home is of little avail in the climate of Egypt.

Fits of shivering are the usual relude to an attack of fever. Qui-
nine is the best remedy, of which l- doses should be taken on the days
when the patient is free from fever. Rest and copious perspiration will
also afford relief.

Diarrhoea, which is apt to turn to dysentery, is a very common com-
plaint in this climate, and is generally the result of eating unripe fruit
01- of catching cold. The patient should first take a slight uperieut, and
afterwards tincture of opium ur concentrated tinature of oamphor. A
simple farinaceuus diet (such as wen-boiled riae), with tea or well
matured, ursfurtii'sed, and unsweetened red wine, will be bemsmsial, while
fruit, meat, and fatty substances should be avoided. In bases both of
diarrhoea and fever all remedies are sometimes unavailing except change
uf climate, espeoia11y if the patient is in a marshy or unhealthy locality.

Sprains, which often result from exploring ruins and caverns, are
most efreotua1ly treated With cold aompresees, while the injured limb
should be tightly bandaged and allowed perfect rest.

The sting of u scorpion (seldom dangerous) or bite of a snake is
usually treated with ammonia.

Sunstroke is Very common in Egypt, even in spring when the air is
still cool. The head and neck should therefore always be carefully
shielded in one of the ways indicated at p. xiv. The usual remedies are
rest and shade, cold compresses, and warm baths with cold donehes
applied to the head and neck. Syringing the ears with cold selt- and-
water is one of the best remedies.

Grey (better than blue) spectacles or veils may be used with advan-
tage when the eyes mifer from the glare of bright weather. Zine ieyee
wash, or some other innocuous lotion, should be used in such cases.

Btiolcir1g-plaster, lint, as well as all Mferveseing powders, and other
medicines should be carefully kept from exposure to moisture.
