influemre of the philosophers then resident at the Museum. In
Trqprn's reign (98-irr) the Jews, who constituted one-third of
the whole population, caused sanguinary riots. Hadrian (117-138),
who visited the city twice, held public disputations with the pro-
fessors at the Museum. Marcus Aurelius Ct01-t8 (0 attended the
lectures of the grarrunaritrns Athenasus, Harpoeration, Hephrestion,
Julius Pollux, and others. Lucian also lived at Alexandria at this
period, in the capacity of secretary to the prefect of Egypt. In
199 Severus (193-211) visited Alexandria, and established a new
municipal constitution. A disastrous visit was that of Caracalla
(211-217), who revenged himself for the derision of the Litizeus by
a bloody massacre and also caused the academy to be Mosed. Still
more disastrous were the contests between the Palmyrenes and the
Imperialists (p. xci), in which a large part of the population was
swept away by the sword, pestilence, and famine.

Christianity early found its way to Alexandria. According to
tradition, the Gospel was first preached to the Alexandriaus by St,
Mark (Whose bones were removed to Venice in 828). The first
great persecution of the Christians, which took place in the reign
ofDecius C250), "as a terrible blow to the Alexandriaus. The city
had for a considerable time been the seat of a bishop, and had
since 190 possessed a thcologioal school7 presided over by Pantamus
and Clement of Alexandria, who endeavoured to combine Chrisn-
ianity with the Neo-Plato/m which sprang up about this period
at Alexandria and was taught by Ammonius Saceas, Herennius,
Plotiuus, and others. A second persecution took place in 257,
during the reign of Valerian; and shortly afterwards, in the
reign of Gallimus, the plague carried oft a large portion of the
population.

Christianity, however, still continued to gain ground, and Al-
exandria was even regarded as the chief seat of Christian erudition
and of the orthodox faith under Athanasius. Alexandria was mean-
while. soon obliged to yield to Constantinople its proud position as
the centre of Greek thought and science. The sauguinsry quarrels
between the Athauasiau party and the Adams under their unworthy
bishop Georgius further contributed to the rapid decline of the city.
Ou the accession of Julian the Apostate (361-363) the pagans of
Alexandria again instituted a persecution of the Christians. In the
reign of Tlmodosius L379-393), however, paganism received its
rleath-blow, and Theophilus, the patriarch of Alexandria, displayed
the utmost zeal in destroying the heathen temples and monuments.
The famous statue of Serapis was burned and most of the temples
were converted into churches. The material prosperity of the city
also fell off so greatly that the municipality was no longer able to
defray the cost of cleansing the Nile and keepi mg the canals open.
The revenues of Alexandria were still farther diminished by the
proceedings of the, patriarch Uvril. who led the armed mob against
