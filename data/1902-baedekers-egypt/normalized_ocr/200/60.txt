own respective countries. It has been asserted that European
families settled in Egypt die out in the second or third generation,
but of this there is no suffieient proof, as the European community
is of very recent origin, and many examples to the contrary might
be cited. Moreover as the Europeans in Egypt dwell exclusively in
the large cities, they do not afford very conclusive evidence on the
general question; for city life, as opposed to country life, is even
less propitious to human health and vigour in warm countries than
it is in northern climes. Thus the Mameluhes have left no deseeu-
dants in Egypt. The climate of Egypt (comp. p. Ixi) is less ener-
vating than that of most other hot countries, an advantage attri-
buted to the dryness of the air.

c. The Nile.

The Nile ranks with the Amazon and the Congo as one of the
three longest rivers in the world [ about 4000 miles), since its head-
stream was proved by Dr. 0. Baumann in 1892 to be the Kagera,
.which rises three degrees to the S of the Equator. Throughout
nearly the whole of its course the river is navigable, with two great
interruptions only (between Abu Hammed and Barkal and between
Dongola and Wadi Halfa).

The Nile is formed by the confluence of the White and the Blue
Nile at the town of Khartlim, from which point to its principal
mouths at Damietta and Rosetta, a distance of 1350 miles, it
traverses an absolutely barren country, and receives one tributary
only, the Atbam, on the east side, about 140 miles below Khar-
ttun. Notwithstanding the immense length of the river, it very rarely
presents the picturesque appearance of some of the great European
and other rivers, as its banks are generally tlat and monotonous,
and it contains hardly a single island worthy of mention. The broad-
est parts of this portion of the Nile are a little below Kl1artim, a
little above its bifurcation uearCairo, and also near Minyeh, at each
of which places it attains a width of about 1100 yds., while the
White Nile is of greater breadth throughout a long part of its lower
course. As the river pursues its tortuous course tluougl1 thirsty
land, for a distance of 15 degrees of latitude, much of its water is
consumed by evaporation and infiltration (a process by which it is
probable that the Libyan oases are supplied with water from the
Nubian Nile), and still more by the extensive system of artitieial
canals requisite for the irrigation of a whole kingdom. At the cou-
tluenee of the White and Blue Nile their average volumes are in the
proportion of three to one, but the latter assumes far greater im..
portance when swollen by the Abyssinian rains. The Blue Nile is
in fact a species of mountain-tomit, being liable to rise suddenly
and sweep away everything it encounters on its rapidly descending
course. It is therefore called the Babr et-Asra.k,. Le. the blue,
'dark', or'tarbid', in coutradistinction to the Bahsr sl-Ah/ai, Le. the
