the most beautiful sights' in Egypt; and only very blas√© travellers will be
content merely with the views from the Windmill Hi1 ] (p, 67) and the
Citadel (p. M), - The Petri/ted Forest is, of course, cspcciaily interesting
to geologists;, but even ordinary travellers will f1ud their account in an
expedition to it, especially if they have not previously seen the desert. -
The Barrage (in MI is the largest erection of the kind in the world and
is interesting "such not only to engineers. It will, however, be sur-
