Apis Tombs. SAKKKRA. 9. Route. 135

adorned with religious inscriptions and containing a large and a
small sarcophagus; adjoining is a smaller chamber.

Beyond the Step Pyramid, as we continue on our way to Ma-
riette's House, a striking view opens towards the N. In the fore-
ground lies the green valley of the Nile, bordered by palm-trees,
and framed on both sides with the yellowish-grey desert; and we
also observe the alabaster mosque of Mohammed'Ali at Cairo. On
the left tower the three pyramids of Gizeh, and the three nearer
pyramids of Abusir. The path turns to the right beyond the next
heap of rubbish (N.W.), crosses the hollow, and soon reaches -

htariette's House. Mariette, the famous French Egyptologist,
first rose into notice by his discovery of the Apis Tombs in 1861',
and from 1858 till his death in 1881 was director of the official
excavations in Egypt. No charge is made for admission to the terraee,
but it is usual to give a fee of 21/3 pies. or more, according to the
number of the party, to the'ehaftm' who take charge of the house.
A guide to the tombs must be taken at Mariette's House, as visitors
are not admitted to them unattended.

A trodden path leads from Mariette's Rouse, to the W., in a
few min., to the "Apis Tombs, the subterranean part of the Egypt-

ian Serapeum, hewu in the ruek.

Apis, the sacred bull of the god Ptah (p. 132), which was worshipped
in a special temple at Memphis. was after death embalmed like a human
being and interred with great pomp in the necropulis of Memphis. As
early as the reign of Ameuophis III., and probably still earlier, the Apis
tombs consisted of a. subterranean tomb-chamber, reached by a sloping
shaft, over which a chapel was erected in honour of the bull. Under
Ramses II. a large common grave was prepared for the Apis bulls by
Prince Irha-em-sveset, a subterranean gallery, over 100yds. in length,
was hewn. the mek and flanked with chambers, which were walled up
after receiving the wooden coffin containing the sacred remains. Psam-
metikh I. caused a similar gallery With side-vaults to be constructed at
right angles to the first one. These vaults, which were added to at inter-
vals down to the Ptolemaie period, were much lerger and more carefully
constructed than the previous series. They have an aggregate length of
about 380 yds. and are about 10 ft. in width and 171/2 ft in height. Above
them rose a 1 rge temple for the cult of the dead god. - The ancient
Egyptians believed that like the soul of men (p. cxxiii) the spirit of the
deceased bull was united with Osiris, and became the 1hsiris-Apis' (Egypt.
Osn-hapi; Gr. Osorapis). He thus became a kind of god of the dead and
was called, like Osiris.'Lord of the western land',. pilgrims crowded to
the tomb to pay their devotions and to present votive offerings. The last
were usually small memorial tablets, which were inserted in the walls
of the subterranean galleries. The wurship of the foreign god Seraph or
Sarapis, introduced under Ptolemy L, rapidly spread in Egypt, and it is
easy to understand how the new Seraph was eonfonnded with anmzzin
end worshipped along with the latter in the ancient temple in the necro-
pnlis of Memphis. The temple itself came to be commonly known as the
Serapwm or Sarapeum. Within the extensive chambers of the Serapemn
there was estthlished a colnny of hennits, who lived in the strictest se-
clusion in small cells, receiving even their food through narrow windows
or air-holes. There is no doubt that these were the prototypes of the
Christian monks and escetica of a later period. - A second temple of
Osorapis, built by Nelrtaaebos, once stood opposite the temple covering
the Apis tombs (W. of Mariette's house). These temples were connected by
