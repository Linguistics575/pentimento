Russia and France. Syria was secured to Mohammed by
the peace of Kutdhyeh, but he was obliged to recognise the
suzerainty of the Porte. At the instigation of the British,
Sultén 1faluntld renewed hostilities with Egypt, but he
Was decisively defeated by Ibrahim at Nisibz' on 24th June,
1839. In consequence of the armed intervention of Eng-
land and Austria, however, Ibrahim was compelled to
quit Syria entirely, and Mohammed Was obliged to yield
to the Porte a second time. By the so-gallery tirmin of in-
vestiture in 1811 Sultan Abdu'l-Medjid secured the hered-
itary sovereignty of Egypt to the family of Mohammed
'Ali, the pasha reuouncing his provinces of Syria, Candia,
and the Hijaz, and binding himself to pay an annual tri-
bute of 60,000 purses (about 305,000L.) to the Porte and
to reduce his army to 18,000 men. During the last years
of his life Mohammed fell into a state of imbecility. Be

improved the canals, completed the railways from Cairo
to Alexandria and to Suez, and, above all, zealously sup-
ported the scheme of M. Ferdinand de Lesseps for con-

war he was obliged to send an auxiliary army and con-

Ismé'il, the second son of Ibrihtm Pasha, who was born on

education in France and had there acquired the strong pre-
