The rear-wall of this great vestibule forms the facade of the
temple proper; it is surmounted by a hollow cornice and a round
moulding. In the centre is a door leading to the -

Hypostyle Ball, the roof of which is supported by six columns,
with elaborate foliage -capitals on which heads of Hathor also
appear. The base and lowest two drums of each column are of
granite, the remainder of sandstone. Eight square apertures in the
ceiling admit the light. Four rows of reliefs on the walls exhibit
the king'sacrifitring to the gods of Dendera or celebrating sacred
rites. In this and all the following rooms of the temple, with the
exception of the second storeroom to the left of this hall and the
Crypts (p. 229), the eartouehes of the king are left empty, probably
because the priests were in doubt as to which ruler should be
selected for honour in the unsettled times during which the temple
was built.

Some of the Beliefs in the lower rdw, representing the ceremonies
performed by the king at the foundation of a temple, deserve notice. To
the right of the Entrance (PI. tr): the king, wearing the crown of Lower
Egypt. quits his palace, preceded by it priest offering intense; to the left
the king cleaves the earth with a hoe on the site of the temple - turns
the first sod, as we should express it "'' s" in fmmt of him is the goddess
Hathot. - To the left of the Entrance (P1. O: the king, with the crown
of Upper Egypt, quits his palace (as above); to the right he presents
Ilethor with bricks, representing the huiHing-mtrterial for the new temple.

On each side of this hall are three Chambers, used as laboratory,
treasury, and staterooms for the sacrificial incense, etc. The in-
scriptions and representations show the Pharaoh in presence of
Hathor, the lion-headed Horus of Dendera, and other gods.

We next enter the FIRST ANrsumarrmur, which is lighted by
apertures in the roof and walls, and is decorated with four rows of
mural reliefs. The latter represent the king worshipping, etr.
in presence of Hathor and the other deities of Dendera. To the
right and left are passages. leading to the staircases which ascend
to the roof of the temple (p. 230). On the left also is a small
chamber probably used for some religious rite.

The SECOND Arrzmurasrmut, which we next enter, is lighted
by means of apertures in the side-walls, and has four rows of re-
presentations on the walls. A door to the left opens into a room
used as a Wardrobe, in which perfumes were preserved as well as
the sacred wreaths and garments with which the images of the gods
were embellished at festivals.

The corresponding door on the right side of the hall leads to
three connected Rooms, which to a certain extent form a special
