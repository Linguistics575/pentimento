The village of Biahmu or Bihanw, which lies on the railway to se.
mires (p. 177), AV: M. to the N. of Medinet tsl-Fart), is usually vis.
ited on donkey-baek (11mm; there and back him.) The road, which
leads in the directiun of the railwar-embirukmeat through fertile tields
and past murmuring irrigation channels, Mrovds an insight into the fer.
tility of the district. A short distance to the N. of Biahmu rise two large
stone Building", which present the appearance of ruined pyramids and are
called by the natives Kursi Fir'aun ('Phavaoh's eheir') or ee-iSarmm Cthe
idol'). These were the pedestals of two Colos; alsiu1dstone Slam" omeg

Flinders Petrie, who estimates their original height at 40 ft. The learned
Father Vensleb of Erfnrt saw the lower portion of one of these figures
in 1672. Each was surrounded by a girdle-wall, with a granite door on
the N. side. The N.E. angle of the easternmost wall is still in good
preservation. These walls were once washed by the waters of Lake
Weris, and there is practically no doubt that in them we must recognize
the two pyramids described by Herodotus (p.175) as standing in Lake
Mceris. each with a colossal seated human figure upon it.

Near Begig (or Atrgtsig; trailway-station, see above), 3 If. to the SW. of
Medineh7 lies a tine obelisk, broken into two parts, which must once have
been at least b6 ft. in height. The natives call it'Aratld, Dr the column.
The inscriptions, which are damaged at many places, inform us that the
munument was erected by Usertesen L, who also founded the obelisk of
Ueiiopuiis (p, 107).

The Pyramid of trswkva end the Labyrinth.

Nearly a whole day is required for avisit to the Pyramid of Hawira.
The light railway may be taken to the station of Hawira, but as even in
