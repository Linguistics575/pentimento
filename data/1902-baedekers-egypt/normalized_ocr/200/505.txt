keeps the ass for the day. On the W. side the donkeys, which are much
more heavily worked, are not so good, but they are fairly well saddled.
Charge? fr. per day. The hotels on the E. hank provide donkeys; on
the W, bank they must be ordered beforehand.

Antiquities. The traveller in Thebes is frequently tempted to purchase
antiquities. Half the population of Lnxor is engaged in tmfiic with an-
tiquities, and the practice of fabricating scarabaei and other articles
frequently found in tombs is by no means unknown to the other half.
Many of the articles offered for sale are so skilfully imitated that even
experts are sometimes in doubt as to their genuineness; the ordinary
traveller seldom or never secures an authentic specimen. Travellers are
specially warned against purchasing papyri without expert advice. Purchases
should not be made in presence of the dragomans, as those individuals,
by tacit agreement, receive a. percentage from the dealers, which is, of
course, added tn the price. Only as many piastres as they ask shillings
should ever be offered to the importnnate hawkers of antiquities at the
temples and tombs. Those who desire a genuine memorial of antiquity
should apply to the director of the hotel or to the British or German
consular agents (the latter of whom has a collection of antiquities well
worth seeing). Prices vary greatly; t0-20s, or even more, must be paid
for a good searahayus With fine polish. Good and reliable specimens may
be obtained from Mohammad Muhuxseb and'Abd eF3fegid.

Photographs. Good photographs are produced by A. Beale in Luxor;
but even in 8hepheard's and other hotels in Cairo, excellent photographs
of Egyptian temples are sold at moderate prices. Those by Sébah are
excellent.

Distribution of Time. Travellers by the tourist-steamers are more nr
less committed to the prescribed programme (comp. p. 186). Those who
are at liberty to arrange their time for themselves will find the following
prngrammca convenient.

THREE DAYS' VISIT. iat day. Luxor and Karnak (E. bank). Though

that Thebes has fu1hHcd his highest expectations; and he will not fail to
take a later opportunity to return to refresh and eonllrm his first im.
pression. A visit by moonlight is exceedingly attractive, but travellers
are advised not to make it alone, even although there is nothing to fear
from robbers. - Visitors should ride early to Karnak, while the temple
