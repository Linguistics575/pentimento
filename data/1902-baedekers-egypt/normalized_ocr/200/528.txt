that, in the fifth year of Rehoboam, Shiehek king of Egypt name up

twelve hundred Chariots, and threescere thuueend horsemen; and the
people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lu-
bim, the Sukkiim, end the Ethiopians. And he took the feueed cities
which pertained teJudah, and came to Jerusalem'. Verse 9 is the same
as the above passage from Kings. Of the myrne-labeia only a few can be
identified with certainty with otherwise known names of places in Pa-
lestine, such as Rabbath (lest ring of the ilvst row), Teanach, Shunem,
Rehab, ITaphararm, Mahanarm, Gibeon, Beth-IIorou, Kedemoth, Ajalon
(in the second row). Several symbols have recently been obliterated by
the whitewash used to preserve the wall, and some of the name-labels
have also been Lle=lroyed, as 2.9. Negiddo at the beginning of the third
row. The rest of the inscriptions, which are couched in the usual home
bastic style, give no farther information as to the campaign.

We return to the great court and proceed to the Second Pylon of
Ramses L, which was built out of the materials of a temple of the
heretical period (comp. p. 237; isolated blocks leer the cartauches
of Amenophis IH., Tut-enkh-Amon, and Eye). The left or N. tower
has fallen and the right or S. tower is sadly damaged. On the S. side
of the right tower aPpears Ramses II. defeating his foes in presence
of Ammon. In front of this pylon was a kind of small Vestibule,
the entrance to which was flanked by two statues of Ramses II. The
figure on the right side still stands and o1isp1ays excellent work-
manship; beside the left leg is a figure of the Princess Bent-Anat.
Only the legs of the other figure remain. In the doorway, where
the cartouches of Ramses I., Sethos 1., and Ramses II. are found, an
intervening door Was erected by Ptolemy VI. Philometor and Pto-
lemy IX. Euergetes 11., during their joint reign. The lintel and
upper parts of this doorway are wanting, but the jambs are in good
preservation, with expressions of homage to Ammon and his fellow-
gods. 0n the inner side (left) of the earlier doorway7 at the foot,
are the sacred boat of Amman and the king entering the temple.
In the second row from the foot appears Ramses II. kneeling before
Ammon and receiving the symbol of jubilee1 indicative of long
reign. Behind stands the goddess Mut, while Khons, with the moon's
disk on his head, conducts Philometor to behold the god Amman.
Probably the representation is a restoration by Philometar of an
older work on the same Spot. The other rows exhibit the king in
presence "various deities. - We next enter the -

"Great Hypostyle Ran. This imposing hall may certainly
claim to rank among the wonders of the world. Many ofthe columns
are prostrate, others lean as though on the verge of falling, and
architrave and roof-slabs have either fallen or seem on the point
of doing so. The indescribable effect produced by this enormous
structure is perhaps best appreciated if we place ourselves in the
wide doorway of the second pylon and look through the double row
of huge calyx-columns towards the sanctuary, Ce. towards the E.
