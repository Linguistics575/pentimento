108 Route 7. MOIgATTAM. Environs

An interesting visit may, however, be made without much
trouble to an Ostrich Farm kept by some Fremshmen, about 1/4 hr.
to the E. of Matariyeh, with about 800 birds (adm. 10 pias.).

The excursion may be extended to the village ofEl-Merg (21/2114; mil.
wuy-station, see p. 106), with some ruins of the 18th Dynasty, and the once
prosperous, bat now ruinone Khdnlczih, on the outskirts of the desert (3'/2M.
from Matariyeh); bat this is not recommended.

The Birket el-Hegg, nr Lake of the Pilgrims, to the E. of El-Merg,
presents no attraction except during the latter half of the lunar mnnth
of Shawwtv1, when the great caravan which aeeompanies the new kisweh,
or cover for the Kafha, to Mecca, assembles here to celebrate the so-called
Nahum ] Festival (p. lxxii). A similar scene may, however, be more con-
veniently viewed at Cairo, where festivities take place at the departure
and arrival of the sacred carpet.

g, The Mokattam Hills.

An excursion to the Mo1ptt.tam llills is best made on Donkey-back (p. M).
Including the return, it takes about 3 hrs., bat it may be aomhined with
the visit to the srna11erPetrif1ed Forest in the manner indicated at p. 110.
The View is best at sunset, or in the morning between 8 and 9 o'clock.

The best route to the Mol.ra.t.tarn starts from the Citadel, whence
it ascends almost straight, passing through thelhtb el-aebel CPI. F, (i)
and over the railway-bridge. - The route starting from theTombs
of the Khalifs should he avoided on account of the intolerable dust,
About 3/4 hr. brings us to the top.

The *Mohattam Hills Cor Gebel Giytuhi, as the range of hills to
the E. of Cairo is sometimes called after the conspicuous old mosque
situated on the summit) belong to the great range of nummulite
mountains Which extend from N.W. Africa, across Egypt and India,
to China. This nununulite formation is one of the Eocene, or oldest
deposits of the tertiary period, and immediately follows the chalk.
It Mfori1s a favourite building-stone, and there are numerous quar-
ries on the slopes of the hills.

The nummulite is remarkably rich in fossils, the chief mass of which
consists of millions of nummulites "kind of snail-shell), or large rhizo-
pods of the polythalmia group. The larger kinds are about one inch
in diameter, and the smaller about Va inch. They are also frequently
seen in the stones of the Pyramids, which are to a great extent con-
structed of nummulite limestone. The Greeks also noticed these curious
fossils, and Hcmdotus mentions the smallest kinds as being petrifreil
lentils. of the sort eaten by the ancient Egyptians.

The quarries in the slopes of the Mulgattttm end the higher side-valleys
of the range also yield a profusion of sea-urchius (clypeuster, cidaris,
eehinolaanpas, eth, various kinds of oysters, cerithium, ovula, stromhus,
nerina, furritellu, nautilus, bivalves, sharks' teeth, and bones of the
halicore. Beautiful crystals of isiaglass-stone and of strontien also oacnr.

The *VIEW from the top, especially with its sunset colouring,
is maguitieent. The thousand minarets of the city and the pitstur--
esque buildings of the Citadel are then tinted with a. delioate rosy
hue.'fhe grandest of all the burial-grounds of the desert forms a
