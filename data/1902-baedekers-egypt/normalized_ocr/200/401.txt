ZaMstlt, a thriving, semi-European town, lies on a branch of the
Fresh Water Canal (see below) and on the Mtgir.r. (Mon) Canal (the
ancient Tauite arm of the Nile, p. 156). It is the capital of the E.
province of Sherlciyeh and seat of a Mudir, and contains 35,700 in-
habitants. The situation of Zal.cirils, in the midst of a fertile tract
watered by several canals, and connected with the richest districts
of the Delta, is extremely favourable, and it is a rapidly improving
place. Zahitzik forms the chief centre of the Egyptian cotton and
grain trade. Many European merchants have oifiiyes here, and the
large 1yotton-faetocie, s give the place an almost European appearance.
An Arab market is held here every Tuesday.

2Ulsizils is the junction for braneh-railways to Fuviur (p. 23
and to Abu Jrehiir-Manyira, etc. (see p. 156). Narrow-gauge rail-
way to 8inbeMwtn (p. 157).

In the vicinity, near Tell 2hrs.ta, 1,21 hr. to the s., lie the ruins of
the ancient Buhastis (Egyptian Perrlluxti; the Pibeseth of Ezekiel xxx. 17),
the capital of the Buhastite nome. The remains of the temple of Bastet,
the patron-goddess of the town, were excavated in 1887-89 by the Egypt-
olngist Neville, at the expense of the Eg pt Exploration Fund; but they
are in too ruinous a state to repay a visa' _ The temple, begun by the
pyramid-builders Kheops and Khephren, underwent frequent alterations
at the hands "Ramses II. and other Inter kings, bat owed its final
form to the mnnarehs of the 22nd Dyu., who resided at Bubastis, and to
NektanebEs (Nekht-rltustrl1tmt). At this period it consisted of four large
halls, of an aggregate length of 600 feet; and in these were celebrated
Ihe joyous ztud liceutious f'clivals in honour of Bastet.'When the Egypt-
ians travel to Buhastis', says llerodutus,'they do su in this manner. Men
and Women sail together, and in each bout there are many persons of
both sexes. Some "the women make a noise with rattles, and some of
the men blow pipes during the whole journey, while the other men and
women sing and clap their hands. If they pass a town on the way, they
lay to, and some of the women land and shout and mock at the women
of the place, while uthers deuce and make at disturbance. They do this
at every town that lies on the Nile; and when they arrive at Bubastis
they begin the festival with great siurriliees, and on this occasion more
wine is consumed than during the whole of the rest of the year. Alt the
people of both sexes, except the children1 make a pilgrimage thither,
about 700,000 persons in an, as the Egyptians nssert.'

Beyond the next stations, [ 541/2 M.) Abu el-Ahhdar and (55 M.)
Abu Hammtid (p. 157) the railway skirts the Fresh Water or 15-
ma'tliyeh Canal. The fertile tract which we now traverse is part of
the Goahen of the Bible. During the Turkish r√©gime it fell into a
miserable condition, and at the beginning of the century afforded
a very scanty subsistenr'e to barely 4000 Arabs; but the cultivation
was so rapidly improved by means of the fresh-water canal that it
now supports upwards of 12,000 prosperous farmers and peasants.
Beyond the canal, on the right, is a fertile strip, behind which rise
the desert hills.
