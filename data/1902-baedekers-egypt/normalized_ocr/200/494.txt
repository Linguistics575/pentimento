Temple of Hatter. DENDERA. 22. Route. 227

front of this great hall; but perhaps the means to add these were
nut forthcoming.

If we compare the temple of Dendera With a similar structure
of the earlier period, such as the temple of Abydos or the great
national sanctuary of Karnak, we tind it not less beautiful in its
own way, though of course far from competing with these gigantic
structures in magnificence or extent. Its chief characteristics are a
tine symmetry of proportions and dignified adaptation to its put-
poses. Neither the itgares nor the inscriptions sculptured on the
walls compare in masterly execution with those in the tombs of
the ancient kingdom or with those in temples dating from the
reigns "Thutmosis III. and. Sethoe I.; but we cannet refuse our
admiration even to these products of later Egyptian art.

The rubbish round the temple reaches to the balustrades be-
tween the columns in front and nearly to the roof on the E. side;
hence the floor of the temple appears sunken and is reached by a
flight of steps.

We first enter the Great Vestibule, or Pronaoe, which has
'Y sistrum-iuylumns with heads of Hathor (p. cxxxvii ]. At the top
of the faeade is a huge concave cornice, in the middle of which is
the winged sun-disk.

0n the upper edge of the cornice is the following Greek inscription

The exterior front of the hall is enclosed by six balllstradee be..
tween the columns in the tirst row. Between the central pair of
columns is a door, half the height of the columns. The interior
walls of the promos are decorated with four mws of representations.
These depict the ruler (in succession the Roman emperors Augus-
tus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero) advancing with vutive
offerings for Hathor and the otbergods worshipped in thetemple. The
reliefs (ehiselled out) on the balustrades between the oolurnns (P1.tv/)
refer to the ceremonial entrance of the ruler into the sanctuary.
