eslr-8lreryi, Le. river of the East. Skirting the, l bank of the stream
for 1/2 hr. towards the N., we reach the -

Pyramid of 1.rtswkrs, the tomb of Ammemhit III. This consists
of unhumt bricks of Nile mud mixed with straw, and, when its sides
were perfect, covered an area about 115 yds. square. The limestone
imrruststion, however, had disappeared even in the Roman period.
The nucleus of the structure is a natural mass of rock, 39 ft. in
height. The dilapidated summit is easily reached in a few minutes
by a flight of well-wom steps. The entrance to the pyramid, on
the S. side, was discovered in 1889 by Prof. Flindcrs Petrie. An
intricate series orpassagesi 111 the interior leads to the tomb- chamber
which is 22ft.long, 8 ft. Wide and 6 ft. high. Amenemhét Ill.
and his daughter Ptahnofru were interred here.

On the S. the pyramid was adjoined by at large temple, the
main portion of which was probably dedicated to the manes of
Amcnemhét. This ediiiee, however, which served as a quarry for
centuries after the Roman period, has completely vanished, with
the exneption of an extensive space strewn with small splinters
of stone and fragments of tine granite columns. Traces of its walls
may also he recognized in the sloping banks of thc Bulw (Wu. There
is no doubt that this editiee was the famous Labyrinth, of which
ancient travellers speak with sunh unbounded admiration.

For the best description we are indebted to Strabo, who visited the
Labyrinth in person. He says:'There is also the Labyrinth here, awork
as important as the Pyramids, adjoining which is the tomb of the king
who built the Labyrinth. After advancing about 30-40 stadia beyond the
lirst entrance of the canal, there is a table-shaped surface, on Which rise
a small town and a vast palace, consisting of as many royal dwellings
as there were formerly names. There is also an equal number of halls,
bordered with columns and adjoining each other, all being in the same
row, and forming one building' like a long wall having the halls in front
of it. The entrances to the halls are opposite the wall. In front of the
entrances are numerous long covered passages, intersecting each other and
thus forming such a winding path, that the ingress and egress to each
hall is not practicable to a stranger without a guide. It is a marvellous
fact that each of the ceilings of the chambers consists of a single stone,
and also that the passages are covered in the same way with single slabs
of extraordinary size, neither wood nor other building material having
been employed. On ascending the roof, the height of which is incon-
siderable, as there is only one story, we observe a stone surface con »
sisting oflarge slabs. Descending again, and. looking into the hu11s, we may
observe the whole series borne by twenty-seven monolithic columns. The
walls also are constructed of stones of similar size. At the end of this
structure, which is more than a stadium in length, is the tomb. consist-
ing of a square pyramid, each side of which is four plethre (400 ft.) in
length, and of equal height. The deceased, who is buried here, is called
Imandes. It is also asserted that so many palaces were built, because it
was the custom for all the nnmes, represented by their magnates! with
their priests and. victims, to assemble here to offer gacnriiice and gifts to the
gods, and to deliberate on the most important concerns. Each name
then took possession of the hall destined for it.'

The remains of brick buildings, which still linger on this site and
were erroneously regarded by Lepsius as remains ot the Labyrinth, date
from a village of the Roman period.

To the N, of the pyramid stretches the large neeropolis used since
