said to contain the head of Hosén. The head is said to have been
brought to Cairo in a green silk bag. This tomb-mosque is "hiefly
frequented by men on Thursdays, and by women on Saturdays.

On leaving the mosque we turn into the Mashdad el-mstsnt
on. E, 3), cross the Sikkeh el-ijedideh (p. 42) obliquely, and enter
the Ssrksnrs EL-HALWAGi (Pl. E,3), which is mainly occupied by the
score or more stalls of the Booksellers.

Most of the booksellers are also scholars, and their shops are the resort
of the learned world of Cairo. As the prices of books vary greatly in
accordance with the demand and other circumstances and there is no
such thing as a fixed publishing price, purchasers should always endea.
vour to ascertain beforehand the true value of any work they wish to
buy. As in the case of many other Wares, the line between new and
seeond-hsnd hooks is not "strictly drawn in the East as in Europe.
The booksellers generally keep catalogues, several feet in length, to
refresh their memories regarding the state of their stock. The Koran,
which is shown very reluctantly to norh-h1us1ims, is kept separate tram
the other books. The books are not arranged side hy side as in Ea,
ropean shops, bat piled up in a very iuednvenient fashion. Many of them
are sold in louse sheets, in which case the purchaser should see that
the work is complete, as gaps are of frequent occurrence. The bindings
usually consist of leather or iursteboaril, Valuable hooks are often kept
in cases of red sheepskin, oat of which they are drawn by means of a
loop. - The workmanship of the boolcbim1ers, who, like other Oriental
ertizans, work in the open street, is far inferior to European productions
Red is their favourite colour.

We now proceed to the left to the W. entrance of the Mosque
of Azhar.

The amussi's eI-Azhar (P E, 3, 4), the'blooming', the mostim-
portautmonument of the Fit.imite period, was completed in973A.D.
by Gohar, the vizier ofthe Fitimite Sultan Mu'izz, and was converted
into a University in 988by J0altfel-uzis (p. xciv). The rectangular
grouad-plan of the original building is easily recognizable, but
it has been so frequently restored that no part of it can he said
to date actually from the Fétimite period except the central part
of the sanctuary, with its cnpolas. Everything outside this rectangle
is known positively to be of later date. The characteristic old
ornamentation of the arcades and cupolas deserves special attention;
that of the walls has been for the most part renewed after vanished
patterns. The arcades of the court (.sa.hrs) were rebuilt under the
Khedive Tewfih with scrupulous reproduction of the old style and
the retention of the old columns - The successive rulers ongypt
have emulated each other in maintaining and enlarging this venerable
building. In the 18th cent. the wealthy'Abd er-Balunan added four
aisles to the sanctury, and in more recent days Sa'id Pasha and the
Khedives Tewfil; and'Abbis 11. have been notable benefactors of
the mosque.'Abbtu, II. erected a new building in place of the
dilapidated N.W. side of the mosque, and his new -Arah faeede
is practically the only one the mosque boasts, the other sides being
all quite unpretentious and concealed in narrow lanes.

The principal entrance (PI. o, where strangers receive a guide,
is on the N.W. side, and is called BO el-hfuontinin, or lGrate of the
