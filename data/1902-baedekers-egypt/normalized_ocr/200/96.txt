Sais, etc.) becoming vessels of the invaders. Various at-
tempts to expel the latter failed.

Mi. Tanutamon, son of Shabako, succeeded in recovering Egypt
for a brief period, but was finally defeated by the Assyr-
ians and driven back into Upper Egypt. The Assyrian
rule in Egypt was, however, approaching its end.

The absence of the main Assyrian forces, which were
engaged in distant wars in Babylon and Elam, afforded
an opportunity of shaking off the yoke, which was seized
by Psammetikh of Sars, son of Nekho (see p. lxxxiv ], with
the help of Gyges, King of Lydia. The foreign garrisons
were expelled; the authority of the small native princes
was gradually curbed; and Egypt was again united. Ta-
Tmtamon was forced to retire to Ethiopia, which from that
period onwards ceased to belong to Egypt and made no

8. The Late Egyptian Period (663-332 BC.)

"XXVI. DYNASTY (663-595 B.C.).

Egypt now enjoyed another period of prosperity. Trade began to
flourish owing to the new relations with Greece. Art also received
a fresh impetus; even under the Ethiopian kings artists had begun
to imitate the models of the classic period or Egyptian art under
the Early Empire and to revive the ancient forms. This reversion
to the ancient times appeared also in other departments, sych as
literature, the spelling of inscriptions, and even the titles of ofli-
eials, so that the period of the 26th Dyn. may be styled the Egypt-
ian Renaissance.

6634510. Psnmmetikh I. (Psamtik) strengthened his position in Upper
Egypt by marrying Shep-en-wept niece of Shabako, and
daughter of Princess Amenerta'ie.

610-594. Nekho (Nahum). While the Assyrians were engrossed in a
deadly contest with the Babylonians and Medes, Nekho
invaded Syria, defeating and slaying Josiah, King of
Judah, at the battle of Megiddo. The Egyptians were,
however, defeated at Karkemish by Nebuchadnezzar, King
of Babylon, and thus lost their possessions in Syria and
Palestine. - Nekho began to nonstruct a canal from the
Nile to the Red Sea, but was stopped by an oracle (p. 165).

594L588. Psammetikh II. warned against Ethiopia.

588-569. Apries or Unphris (Weh-eb-TE; the Haphrgh of the Bible)
made another attempt to recover Syria, but was unable to
prevent the capture of Jerusalem by Nehuiohsi1myraar in
5256. A military rebellion in Libya dethroned Apries, and
his general Amasis was proclaimed king.
