the mutilation of many of the inscriptions and also its present name
(Der--monastery).

Adjoining the temple 0n the left is an archway of hrieks.

We first enter a large Vestibule (P1. A), the roof of which (now
mostly fallen in) was supported by two pahu-eolumns. Light was
admitted through openings in the end-walls. Separated from it by
two columns with rich floral capitals and two pillars adorned with
heads of Iiathor is the Pronaus (P1. B). Screen-walls rose between
the pillars and columns. and between the columns, which bear figures
of the ileiiied sage Amenhotep and the god Imhotep, is a doorway,
open at the top. Only the left screen is now left. The walls of this
hall are embellished with ineised reliefs, representing the king siuui-
tieing to various deities. Towards the top of the left wall is a taste-
ful window, Which originally lighted a staircase. From the promos
three doors open into as many Chapels. Ahovethe hollow cornice over
the doorway to the Central Chapel (Pl. U) are seven heads of Hathor.
On the interior walls appears Philopator, sometimes accompanied by
his sister Arsinoé; and on the jambs of the entrance-door are four
gods with bulls' heads. 0n the left wall of the Left Chapel (P1. D)
is a remarkable representation of the Judgment of the Dead (Pl. a ].
To the right is enthroned Osiris, god of the underworld, and in front
of him are the'retish' of Eme-wet (p. cxxv0, the four gcnii of the
dead upon a lotus-tlower, the'Devourcr of the Underworld" in the
form of a hippopotamus, and Harpocretes, resting upon a crooked
staff. The ibis-headed Thout inserihes the verdict. To the left Anubis
and Horus weigh the heart of the deceased; two goddesses of truth,
with feathers on their head, conduct the deceased into the judgment
hall. Above is the deceased praying to the 42 judges of the dead.
On the resr-wall (P1. b) of this chapel Philopetor offers incense
before Osiris end Isis. On the right wall (Pl. e) appears, to the left,
the sacred boat of Osiris-Sokeris, with standards, etc., beside it.
To the right the king offers incense to Anubis, who holds a disk,
and to the ithyphallie Min. On the lintel of the door is a four-
headed rem (the god of the four winds), above which is a flying
vulture, worshipped by four goddesses. - 0n the door-jambs, the
king with three hawk-headed and three jaekal-headed genii. - The
reliefs in the Right (S.) Chapel (P1. E) are of little interest.

The valley of Dér el-Medinch is rich in Tombs ofvari011s periods,
particularly of the 20th Dyn., with the colours of the paintings
marve0ously preserved. They are not shown without the permission
of the Inspector General (p. 297 ].
