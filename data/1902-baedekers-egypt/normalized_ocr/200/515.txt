240 Route 24. THEBES (E. BANK). 1. Temple

The exterior walls of the pylons are adorned with representations
referring to the campaign against the Hittites, which Ramses If.
carried on in Syria in the 5th year of his reign. The Beliefs en crew
have suffered severely from the hand of time and at several places
are almost obliterated. On the Right (W.) Tower we see the life and
business of the Egyptian camp; to the left the king on his throne
holds a council of war with his princes, in the middle is the camp,
fortified by the shields of the soldiers arranged side by side, to the
right the king in his chariot dashes into the fray. The scenes on
the Left (E) Tower plunge us into the battle; the king in his chariot
dashes against his foes who have surrounded him, and launches his
arrows against them. The field is covered with dead and wounded,,
while the Hittites flee in wild confusion to the fortress of Kadesh,
whence fresh troops issues Farther to the left Kadesh, gin with
water, appears, with the defenders on the battlements. Remote
from the battle-field, to the extreme left, the prince of the Hittites
stands in his chariot, surrounded by his guards, and'fears before
his majesty'.

Below the reliefs on the W. tower is a long poetical description
of the battle of Kadesh, inscribed in vertical lines. This is now
generally.known as the Wpie of Pentaur'. It is continued on the E.
tower, where, however, the text is still partly concealed by rubbish.

On the front of each tower of the pylon are two large vertical
grooves for the reception of flag-staffs, and above them are large
square apertures, which served both to receive the braces securing
the Mg-stairs and to admit light and air to the interior.

The portal between the towers is in a very ruinous condition.
The reliefs represent Ramses II. in presence of the chief deities of
the temple. The carvings, in tolerably high relief, in the doorway
date from the reign of the Ethiopian king Shabaku.

Beyond the principal pylon (though nut accessible from this
side) lies the great Court of Ramses II. (Pi. A), which was entirely
surrounded by a double row of papyrus-eolumns (74 in all), with
hud-eapitals and smooth shafts. It measures 185 ft. in length and
167 ft. in breadth, but owing to the presence of a mosque (p. 238),
only the W. side has been laid here. In the N.W. comer, adjoining
the W. tower of the pylon, lies an ancient Chapel (Pl. Th), built
by Thutmosis 1H. and restored by Ramses 11. It is raised upon a
platform above the pavement of the court, and contains three
chambers, of which that in the centre Was dedicated to Ammon,
that on the W. to Mut, and that on the E. to Khons. On the side
facing the court it had a small colonnade of four clustered papyrus-
columns in red granite.

The Walls of the court are covered with reliefs and inscriptions,
including ssrerifioial scenes, hymns to the gods, representations of
conquered nations, em, most of which date from the reign of Bam-
ses II. Specially interesting is a relief on the S.W. wall [ P1. Y),
