the special rites in honour of Osirist We first enter a Hall, the roof of
which was supported by ten whimus (without Capitals) To the right of
this lay three small chambers, adorned with fine sculpture and dedicated
vespectiv ely to Horus, Osiris, and Isis. Behind them lies another room
(P1. In closed). To the left on entering the cnlumned hall is a door lead-
ing to a room with four columns, which was adjoined by three smaller
apartments tPl. n, 0,17). These are much damaged and still partly buried.

SOUTH WING. - This building consists of a series of rooms, all
more or less ruinous, a slaughter-yard, storerooms, etc. The most
important, to Which a visit should be paid even if all the others be
omitted, is the long corridor known as the *GALLERY OF THE KINGS,
entered from the left side of the second hypostyle hall, between the
second and third row of columns. On the right wall is the famous
*LIST DE KINGS. Sethes I. with the censer, and the, crowu-ptince
Ramses (with the side- lock of youth) reciting hymns from a book,
are seen reveriug their royal ancestors, the names of 76 of whom are
inseribed in the two upper rows. The list begins with Menes, the
first king of Egypt, and extends down to Sethos, the names of un-
important or illegitimate rulers being omitted. Above the list is the
inscription:'The performance of the prayer for the dead - May
Ptale8okaris-osiris, lord of the tomb, who dwells in the temple of
Sethas, increase the gifts for the king: of Upper and Lower Egypt -
by King Sethos; 1000 loaves of bread, 1000 barrels of beer, 1000
cattle, 1000 geese, 1000 ineense-ofrerings, ete., by King Sethos for
King Menes' etc. (here follows the list). In the lowest row the
phrases'by King Men-mat-ry,'by the son ofRe Sethos' are repeated
over and over again.

This list of kings is of great historical importance, as partly by its
aid it has been possible to "the order of succession of the Egyptian
kings. Another similar list is mentioned at p. 255.

On the Left wall of the corridor we again meet Sethos end the
youthful Ramses. The father holds 11 ceueer in his left hand, while
the son, adorned with the priestly panther-skin, pours a libation on
the altar in front of him. The inscription contains in systematic
order the names of these objects of worship, with their homes, whom
Sethos has honoured with ssreritWral gifts. - 1n the centre of the right
walf a door leads into' narrow Passage, beyond which is a vaulted

stone staircase which probably led to the roof of the temple.

The Relief; in the passage date from Ramses II. On the right wali

Another door in the Kings' Gallery (now built up) led m a email
Chamber, the walls of which were adorned partly wilh paintings by Se-
thue L, partly by reliefs'en creux' by Ramses IL This chamber is now
almost entirely buried again.

The other rooms of this S. wing are all more or less in ruins.
From the s. end of the kings' gallery, where Coptic prayers have
been written up in red, we enter the Slaughter Court, surrounded
