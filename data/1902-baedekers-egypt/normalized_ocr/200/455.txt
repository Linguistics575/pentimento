The wall-paintings olosely resemble those in the tomb of Khnem-

men, and agricultural scenest Left WallfN.). At the top, hunting

If time permit. some of the other tombs also should be visited, the
most interesting being the following: TOMB i, that of Klmemhotep, son of
the Khncmhotcp buried in Tomb 3. In the vestibule stands a Truto <
Doric' column; the tombthamber Was unfinished. - Tomb 5, aatirhished.
- TOMB li, of Khnrmhotep, governor of a province under Amenemhét I.
In the tomh-chamber are two pltmt-isolumus { unfortunately broken); the
wall-pairings are interesting but sadly faded. On the pear-wall appear
soldiers and a caravan of Libyans, with their wives and children and
herds, who visited the province of the deceased; the men are distinguished
by the ostrich-feathers in their hair, the women carry their children in
baskets on their backs. - Tours 18, though untiaished, is interesting as
the process of bellowing out the tom0-eharnber may be traced. The
pavement in the front of the chamber is not fully excavated; and at
the heck are ten 1ot1us-6o1umas with closed hud-capitals, of which five
still unfinished remain. - TOMB 21, of Nakht, governor of thc gazelle-nome
under the 12th Dyn., resembles No.15 (p.198) in its arrangement. -
TOMB 23, of Weterrustht, governor of the E. districts, with uninteresting
mul-paintings; on the E. wall is a Coptic inscription. - TOMB 27, of
Remushenti, governor of the gazellwnome. - TOMB 28, with two columns,
was cJuvcrtcd into at church in the Christian period. - Tom, 29, of Baket,
nomarch of the gezelle-nome. The door to this tomb and the entrance
to Tomb 30 were broken by tho Copts. The wall-paintings are in com-
paratively good preservation, but offer no novel point of interest; the
dwarfs following the deceased. on the W, half of the S wall, may perhaps
be mentioned. - TOMB 33, of Baket, prince (nflhe gaaslle-aome, son of the
Bnket interred in No. 2r, several walt-paintings. - Tomes 3i3) were left
unfinished.
