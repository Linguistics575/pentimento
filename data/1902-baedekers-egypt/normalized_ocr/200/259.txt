sentence as he proceeds; or he directs one of the more advanced students
to read aloud, adding his uwn expltsmrtior1s from time to time. The students
sit in a circle around the teacher, listening, at attentively taking notes. As
soon as a student knows by heart and can explain the whole of the book
which is heing studied by the class, the shékh makes an entry in his
copy of the work, called the Igiraeh, whereby authority to lecture on the
hook is conferred on the student himself. The president of the univer-

After having completed his course ofreligious instruction, the student
proceeds to study law ('ilm M-fi.NO.'Jur% yruderuse', says Ibn 1rhttliiiin,

The above list of the subjects taught at the most important of Moham-
medan schools will serve to convey an idea of the intellectual eonditian
of Orientals at the present day. The most conspicuous defect of their
culture consists in the entire absence of independent thought, in conse-
quence of which they are the mere recipients of the knowledge of the
past. Their minds are thus exclusively occupied with the lowest grade
of intellectual work, their principal task consisting in the systematic
arrangement or encyclopaedic compilation of the knowledge handed down
to them.

On quitting the Mosque of Azhar we proceed in a straight di-
rection, leaving the Mosque of Muhammad Bey Abu Dalmb on the

direction, we reach the street of Ashrafiyeh, opposite the Mosque

of Ashréf (p. 42 ].
