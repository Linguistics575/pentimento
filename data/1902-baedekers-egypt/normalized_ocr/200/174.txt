BUILDINGS OF TRE MOHAMMEDANS. olxiii

top stories are used for hanging up the lamps during the fasting
month of Barnsu.1io1.

Since the days of the Bahrite Mameluke sultans [ 1250 AD.)
every mosque has possessed a Sybil. or public fountain, except in cases
when a separate building is erected for this. The sebils are rooms
with bronze railings at which passers-by may obtain water, which is
supplied from cisterns placed beneath. The upper story of the sebil
is a kind of loggia, supported by columns and covered with a tent-
foot, frequently in elegant timber-architeeture. This is the Maktab,
or elementary school. The detached columns that frequently em-
bellish the exterior of these buildings Mfferentiate them from all
the other parts of the mosque-faearle, in whinh columns appear
only built into the angles or immured in the masonry.

Tombs. - The tombs of sultans and emirs and of their families
are invariably built in connection with mosques (p. olsii). 0n the
other hand the Sh? kh Tombs, or tombs of saints, which are found
in all parts of the country, are independent structures, usually built
on the spot on Which the revered deceased ended his clays. These
closely resemble the mortuary chapels of the m0s (111es and are, like
them, covered with domes. The ordinary tombs of the Muslims are
generally situated on high ground, beyond the influemye of the
moisture of the river, and preferably in the desert. The subterranean
vaulted chambers are generally large enough for four or more bodies,
and are destitute of decoration. The corpse, wrapped in white
cotton cloth, is placed upon a bed of sand, with the face turned
towards Mecca. When both sexes are interred in the same vault a
partition-wall is erected to separate them. Above the vault stands a
Cenotaph (Tarkibeh) resting on a more or less decorated pedestal,
and bearing two upright columns of marble "other stone, one of
which, placed immediately over the head of the deceased, bears his
name and age, with texts from the Koran. At the top is represented
the turban of the deceased, the form of which indicates his rank.
Over the eenotephs of persons of distinction are frequently erected
canopies, resting on four columns or pilasters. Wealthy families
surrounded the tombs of their ancestors with extensive building's
(known as 1.hjsli), includingrooms for mourners, sebil, school, stables,
eustodiau's residence, etc. The tombs of the Khalifs and Mamelukes
at Cairo include many erectinns of this kind, Which lend the cem-
eteries the appearance of small half-deserted towns.

The secular buildings are on the whole less interesting. The
Fortification, of the citadel of Cairo, dating from the time of
Saladin, recall the mediasval castles of Europe. Some of the nu-
merous gates in the walls of Cairo date from the Fitimite period;
they were probably built after Roman models and are distinguished
for the skill with which they are constructed, especially for accuracy
in the jointing of the stones.
