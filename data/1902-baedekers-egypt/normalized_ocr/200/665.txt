Rock Temple of Gerf9uyhu The Egyptian name of this temple
was Per-Ptah, the'House of Ptah'. It was founded in the reign of
Ramses II. by Setaw, at that time governor of Ethiopia, and it was
dedicated to Ptah of Memphis and his fellow-gods. In front of
the rock-temple proper lay a
quadrangular COURT (P1. A ],
which was surrounded on
three sides by covered colon-
nades. The E. colonnnde had
lotus-columns, while the
others were supported by
pillars, against which stood
colossal figures of Ramses II.
Two ofthe columns and Eve of
the pillars are still standing.
The W. side of the court is
bounded by the rock-Grade
of the temple, hewn to imi-
tate a pylon and rleeorated in
a corresponding style. On the
left side of the portal is a re-
lief of Ramses offering fresh
vegetables to Ptah. Passing
through this portal, we enter
a large HALL (Pl. Bl, gr, ft.
square, hewn out of the rock.
The ceiling is supported by
six pillars, 28 ft. high, against
which are statues of the king
like those in the court. On

under various titles7 standing
