of Gizeh. GREAT PYRAMID. 8. Route. 119
at an angle of 2 (P 41', and is altogether 1061/2 yds. in length. We
follow this passage as far as the point d only, 20 yds. from the
entrance. Here diverges the ascending pasaage de, the lower end
of which is tilled with massive Mocks of granite, placed in position
after the interment of the mummy to protect the grave from robbers.
The hardness of the material of which this barrier consists compelled
the Arabian treasure-hunteps (p. 116) to avoid it, and to force a
new passage (Pl. d) through the softer limestone. This is the roughest
and most awkward spot on the whole route. Beyond the granite
blocks we enter a passage CPI. ale), Il yds. in length, with a very
slippery Mor, beyond which lies the Great Hall (Pl. h).

Before entering the latter. we may pass through a formerly concealed
opening in the pavement tn the 11orizonta1 passage e ], which leads to
the secalled Chamber of the Queen (Pl. g). This passage is at ilrst 3 ft.
9 in. only in height, but at a distance of 61/2 yds. from the chamber the
tlooriag sinks a little, so that the height inereases to 5 ft. Biuches. The
N. and S. sides of the chamber are each 17 ft in length, and the E. and
w. sides 18 ft. 10inches. The height is 20 ft. iin' including the poin ted
nmf, which consists of enormous blocks uf rack projecting, beyond the
sides of the walls to e distance of 51/2 it. into the surrounding milSOm-y.

The jointing and polish of the flne-grainec1 Mokattam limestone
in the Great Hall (PL h) form an unsurprrssable marvel of skilful
masonry, of Which the Arab historian'Abdellat.if accurately remarks,
that neither a needle nor even a hair can be inserted into the joints
of the stones. The Great Hall is 28 ft. high and 155 ft. long. The
lower part is 3 ft. 4 in. in width; and the upper part, beyond the
last of the panels of stone, each of which is l ft. 8 in. thick and
2ft. high, is 7 ft. in width. The roof is formed of seven courses of
stone projecting one above the other and crowned by l1orizontal
slabs. The incisions ou the walls wore used to facilitate the intro-
duction of the sarisophagus. 0n the floor are irregularly hewnhoilows,
which now serve to prevent the visitor from slipping. At the end of
the Great Hall is a small horizontal passage, 22 ft. long and 3 ft.
8 in. high, expanding about the middle into an Autechamher CPI. i),
which was once closed by four trap-doors of granite. The remains of
one of these slabs, in its pendent position, should be noticed. We
next enter the King's Chamber (Pl. g), the most interesting of all,
The N. and s. sides are each 17 ft. in length, the E. and W. sides
341/3 ft, and the height is 19 ft.; the floor of the chamber is
1391/2 ft. above the plateau on Which the Pyramid stands. The
chamber is entirely lined with granite, and is roofed with nine
enormous slabs of granite, each 18/, ft. in length, above which
tive chambers have been formed, which may he reached from the Hall

h by means of ladders.

These hollow chambers were by no means necessary to prevent the
roof of the King's C tmber heiug crushed by the superineumbent weight.
The o/ev-cautious builders have here made an error in their calculations,
The name of Kheops was found in the twu highest chambers (P1. o, p).

The Khrg's Chamber now contains nothing but an empty and
mutilated flarcophayo of granite, bearing no trace of an inscription7
