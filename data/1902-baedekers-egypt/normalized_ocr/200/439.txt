dragoman is essential (p. xxii). A contract with him must be drawn
up stipulating fur the price and duration of the voyage, the style of
living, the maintenance of the dalmbiyeh in a good and etNient
condition, and the providing of a small boat to be at all times at
the disposal of the traveller. A clause should also be insqted re-
lieving the travellers from all responsibility for any damage to the
dahabiyeh or its contents, not due to their fault; and finally both
parties should expressly agree to submit all disputies as to the car-
rying out of the contract to the arbitration of the consul in whose
presence it has been signed.

Experienced travellers will find a very much cheaper mode of
cunveyance than the dahahiyeh in one ofthe native Sailing Boats or
Felaka, which are used for the transport of sugarcane, cotton, eta,
and are to be found in all the larger towns, such as Cairo7 Millyeh,
Assid.t, Girgeh, Assuin, etc. No luxury, of course, must he looked
for, but its absence is compensated by the close relations with the
land and people into which the traveller is brought. Woollen cover-
lets, a mattress, towels, an oil eoolring-stom (obtainable in Cairo),
tinned meats, a filter (air), and insruot-powder must not be forgotten
A young attendant with some knowledge of cooking may he obtained
for 2 or 3 fr. per day. A written contract must be carefully drawn
up to include all details.
