HELIOPOLIS. 7. Route. 107

while that of all the others, which pereolates through the ground
from the Nile, is usually brackish.

About 3/4 M. beyond the garden are situated the ruins of the
famous ancient Heliopolis, or city of the sun, called On by the
Egyptians. The latter name frequently occurs in the Bible. Thus,
in Genesis (xli, M), we are informed that Pharaoh gave Joseph'to
wife Asenath, the daughter of Potiphetah (Egypt. Petedpré,'he
whom the sun-god Re has given'), priest of On'.

Jleliopotirths was one of the most ancient Egyptian cities and was
the chief town of a separate province, included in Lower Egypt. The
deities "the place were the hawk-headed RE-Harmaehis (the sun-gud.
whence the Greek name Heliopolis) and the humau-headed Atum, who
was incarnated in the sacred Mnevis Bull. To these was dedicated the
famous temple,'the House of Rré', built on the site of an earlier edifice
by Amcnemhet 1., first king of the 12th Dyn.. in front of which his sen
and successor Usertesen I, erected two great obelisks (see below) in eel-
ehration of an important anniversary. A large section of the Egyptian
religious literature was due to the priests of Heliopolis, and their doctrines
were widely disseminated throughout the country at a very early period,
"that Ré-Havmachis was one of the most highly venerated deities in
Egypt. - Even during the Greek period these priests enjoyed a high
reputation for wisdom; Herodotus eonversed with them and Plato is said
to have spent thirteen years with them, in order to learn some at least
of their doctrines. - Under the New Empire the temple of Beliopo1is
was the largest and most richly endowed in all Egypt, next to the temple
of Ammon at Thebes. - When Straho Ch. about 60 BAJO visited Egypt,
the city had been t16stroreil, but the temple Was still intact, except for some
minor injuries attributed to Cambyses; even the houses of the priests
and the apartments of Plato and his friend Eudoxus were shown to the
traveller. The priestly school. however, had ceased to exist, and only a
few ofiiisiuing priests and guides for foreigners resided there.

The outer walls are now the only vestiges of the tsity, while of
the temple nothing is left but a few scanty ruins and the *OBELISK.

The latter, the oldest Egyptian obelisk known, is of red granite
of Syeue (Assuiu), and is 66 ft. high; but the ground on which it
stands has been so raised by deposits of mud, that a great part of the
obelisk is now buried. Each of the four sides bears the same in-
scription in bold hieroglyphics; that on the N. side, the only one
entirely legible, records that Usertesen L, King of Upper and
Lower Egypt, lord of the diadems and son of the sun, whom the
(divine) spirits of On (Heliopolis) love, etc., founded the obelisk
on the first festival of Set (a kind of Jubilee celebration). The in-
scriptions on the other three sides are more or less covered by the
cells of wild bees, besides being otherwise damaged. The prr-
amidium at the top and the hawks which begin the inscriptions on
each side were once covered with metal. The companion obelisk
(for these monuments were always erected in pairs) stood down to
the 12th century.

To the W. of the obelisk the remains of the temple may be recog-
nized in a few blocks of granite, bearing inscriptions by Ramses II. On
one Ramses IL appears olfering a lityation to Atum. - The necropolis of

Heliopulis, where eofflrw and tombstones of .1 late period have recently
heen innit ], does not repay a visit.
