The narrow cultivable strip is tilled by peasants of a distinctly darker
complexion than the fellidyin of the Thebaid. Both land and people
approach gradually nearer to the Nubian type.

0n the E. bank lies Alclit. - At the village of Minihm (E. bank)
we enter the E. branch of the stream, which here forms the island
of ManpFipelt, with a village of the same name.

On a hill on the It. bank and conspicuous from a considerable
distance appear the ruins of the beautiful temple of K6m Ombo,
especially picturesque by the light of the full moon. The islands
opposite the E. bank were, perhaps, in former times united with the
mainland, or separated from it only by a narrow channel; but in the
course of centuries the Nile has gradually extended its channel
farther and farther to the Isl.; and during the 19th cent. alone abuirt
20 ft. have been washed away from the E. bank, along with a large
portion of the building. An embankment has been constructed to
prevent farther mischief.

t2 M. K6111 Ombo, the'Hill of Ombos', lie about 50 ft. above
the average surface-level of the Nile. The ancient Egyptian city
of Umbos probably owes its foundation to the strategic, importance of
its site, upon a hill commanding both the Nile and the routes from
Nubia to the Nile valley. Yet the town attained no great prosperity
until the Ptolemaic era, when it was converted from an ordinary
provincial town into the capital of the separate norm of Ombites.
It was at this era that the mighty temples were built, which excite
our admiration to-day; the earlier sanctuaries have left scarcely a
trace. Not content like other towns with one local deity, Omhos
possessed two chief gods - the eroco6ile-hesded Sobk (Suklros)
and the hawk-headed HaroF/ris. With the former were specially
associated Hathor and the youthful moon-god Khotu-Hov; with
the latter, the'Good Sister' (T-seru-myfret, a special form of Ha-
thor) and the'Lord of Both Lends' (P-neb-teui). The rains of the
town, now buried in sand, lie in the NE. corner of the plateau.
In 1893 all the temple-build'urgs in the S. part of the plateau were
cleared of rubbish and restored undm- the directions of De Morgan,
A marble tablet on the right door to the great hypostyle hall (p. 325)
commemorates the fact. At the W. angle of the plateau is a olis-
mantletl British fort.

From the landiug-plaee, to the S. of the hill, a read skirts the
river-bank to a modern tlight of steps, which ascends direct to the
principal entrance. Tickets of admission should not be forgotten.

The temple-precincts were enclosed by a brick girdle-wall. The
entrance is formed by a massive Pylon, erected by Ptolemy Neos
Dionysus. Only the right (E.) half is now standing, the other has
sunk in the river. The reliefs show Nees Dionysus presenting various
offerings to the gods of Ombos. We now betake ourselves to the -
