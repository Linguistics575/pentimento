the tomb of a shékh. The low rapids here, caused by granite rocks

Temple of Dendhr, built by Augustus, and dedicated to various
gods, including Pete-iii and Peufov, the sons of Kuper, two local

way remains; the towers, probably built of brick, have disappeared.
At the top of the portal is the winged sun-disk, and within and
on the front (E) and back (W.) is the Pharaoh siurrilicing to various
gods. Beyond the portal we enter an open COURT, which Was orig-
inally enclosed by brick walls. The faeade of the TEMPLE is adorned
with two columns with rich i1ursl capitals, connected with the side-
walls by sereet1-wslls. The temple comprizes a Vestibute and two
Smaller Chambers. The former is embellished with reliefs of the
Pharaoh in presence of the gods, which in the Christian period,
when the hall was used as a church, were covered with stucco, bear-
ing pictures of saints. The smaller rooms have no decoration. In
the rear-wall of the innermost is a shallow Recess, with representa-
tion of the local saints Pete-ese and Pé-U6r praying tolsis and Osiris.
In the top ot' this wall also is a deep crypt, which could be closed
by a large and a small stone. The N. and S. Exterior Walls of the
temple are adorned with interesting reliefs. 0n the N. wall, to the

door, he saeritioes to Pete-ése, who is accompanied by a woman,
probably his wife.

Among the various Inscriptions placed on the walls hy visitors to the
temple, is one in Cuptie, in which a certain Presbyter Abraham records
that he erected a cross here in the church at the command of the Nubian
King Tsqspaaomé. This appears within the 8. side-door ot' the vestibule.

The stones lying in { rent of these are, perhaps, remains of ancient houses.

Beyond (18% M.) Jfertyeli, a commune 011 both banks, the banks
of the Nile become flatter and are partly cultivated.
