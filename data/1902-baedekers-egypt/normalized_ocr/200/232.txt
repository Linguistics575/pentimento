DAMANHUR. 3.Roate. 21

The Lake Mureotis, or Mania, as it was also called in ancient times,
bunnds Alexandria 0n the s. side. la Straho's time it was filled from the
Nile by means of numerous canals, both from the S. and E., Which
brought great traffie to this inland harbour, while the sea-harbour was
more important for the export trade. The Jake, which lies 8 ft. below
the serleve1, was once surrounded by a Juxuriantly fertile tract of
country, yielding excellent white Wine, which has been extolled by
Horace and Virgil. During the Arabian and Turkish regime the waters
of the lake gradually subsided, but in 1801, during the siege of Alexan-
dria, the English cut through the neck uflttud between the lake and the
sea, a little to the w. of Abulsir, thus laying an extensive and fertile
region under water and destroying about 150 villages. Mohammed'Ali
did all in his power to repair the damage and to improve the environs of
Alexandria, but 100,000 acres of cultivable land are said still to be uuvered
try the sea. The water is now evaporated fur the sake of its salt.

At L17 M.) Kafr ed-Dash the first cotton-fields appear (on the
right).

A "arrow-gauge loup-line diverging here (three trains daily) serves
the villages ot' Bidi Ghazi, Ku'm el-Hanalh, Abu el-lfatdmir, Hdah 11:11 (2200
iuhab.), and Nadiba, and rejoins the main line at Damanldr (see below).

Several Arab villages are seen from th elofty railway-emhankmen t.

381/2 M, Damtsuhiir (Raitu-ay Hater), the second station at which
the express stops (reached in 1 hr.), and the capital of the pro-
vince "Beh√©reh, with 22,100 inhab., was the ancient Egyptian
TinR-ett-Hor [ city of Horus), and the Roman Hermopobis Parva.
The town lies on an eminence and contains some tolerably suh-
stautialbuildings. Among them are several manul'aetories fur the
separation of the cotton from the seeds, and above them tower
several minarets. The Arabian cemetery lies close to the railway.

48 M. Soft eb-hfeVsk. About 3 M. to the S.E., near the modern
Nebireh (Nebeimh), on the ancient Canopie arm of the Nile, lie the
ruins of Naucmtis, a Greek commercial city, founded by Aahmes.
The ruins, discovered by Prof. Flinders Petrie and excavated in
1885, do not repay a visit.

531/2 M. Tels ei-Biiriid, a village with a large mound of ruins,
is the junction for a branch-linu skirting the W. coast of the Nile
delta. None of the express-trains stop here.

This branch-line is an alternative route to Cairo, but is of no im-
portance to tourists. There are only two trains daily (in 3%: hrs). The
stations are insigailiraut. The last one is Embdbeh (p. TO), beyond which
the line ('rnsses the A ile by an iron bridge and enters Cairo (p. M).
