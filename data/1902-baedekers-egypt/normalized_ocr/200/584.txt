Ipir el-Medineh. The Tomb o.f Huyé at Karim Murmi' (p. 295) has of late

which are fitted together in waving
lines. Through this a Doorway of stone

precincts, at the hack of which (N)
are steep rocks. The traveller on pas-

crowned with l hollow cornice, many..
Greeks and Coyts have written their names. In Christienhmes
it was used. by the monks as a dwelling-plow, and to this is due
