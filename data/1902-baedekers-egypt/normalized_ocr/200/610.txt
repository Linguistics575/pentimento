EDFU. 27. Route. 315

The Greeks called it Great Apoaonopolie, after its chief god Horus-
Apollo. It was the capital of the second name of Upper Egypt, the
Apollonopolites of Graco-Roman times. Horus, who according to
the myth here waged one of his great combats with Set (comp.
pp. ray, 215), was surnamed'he of Tebhet', Tehhet being probably
a district of ancient Edfu; he was represented as a flying hawk, as
a man with a hswk's head, or as the sun with outsptead plumes.

The way to the (20 min.) Temple of Horus leads almost due w.
from the landing-plaee, then, turning to the N. (right), skirts the
Canal of Edfu and crosses it by a good new bridge. It then proceeds
to the W. through several streets and finally turns N. again for a
short distance. - Another route leads straight on from the landing-
plene, bends to the right through fields, and then traverses the streets
of the town without crossing the canal.

The "Temple of Horus was freed by Mariette under the auspices
ofthe Viceroy Sa'id from the accumulated rubbish that is now piled
up high all around it; and the edifice is now seen in wonderful,
almost perfect preservation, exceeding that of any other Egyptian
temple or even of any antique building in the world, in spite of the
2000 years that have passed over it. Unfortunately the faces of the
kings and gods in the reliefs all over the temple Were scratched out
in the Christian period. The present temple occupies the site of an
earlier sanctuary and was dedicated to the sun-god Horus, Hathor of
Dendera, and the youthful Horus,'Unites of the Two Lands' (Har-
scm-tewE, Harsomtus). The history of its construction and a de-
scription of the entire structure are detailed in lengthy inscriptions
on the exterior of the girdle-wall (st PL i and k). The temple proper
(Le. the two hypostyle halls and the smaller apartments beside and
behind these) was begun in 237 13.0. by Ptolemy III. Euergetes 1.,
and completed, so far as the masonry was concerned, by his MIC-
cessor Philopstor in 212 13.0. The decoration of the walls with
reliefs and inscriptions, postponed by the death of Philopator and
the disturbed reign of Epiphanes his successor, was resumed in
176 B.0. under Philometor and completed in 147 13.0. (under Euet-
getes II.), Ce. 95 years after the laying of the foundation-stone.
Euergetes II. built the great hypostyle hall (completed 122 13.0.)
and embellished it with reliefs, and under Soter li. and Ptolemy XI.
Alexander I. the eolonnaded court, the girdle-wall, and the pylon
were added, though the reliefs on the latter date from Neos Diony-
sos. The final touch was given in 57 BA). The building-material
is sandstone.

The great Pylon, to which a flight of steps descends, is covered
on all sides with reliefs and inscriptions. On the front of each of
the towers the colossal tigure of the King Neos Dienyeos is con-
spicuous, smiting his foes, whom he holds by the hair, in presence
of the hawk-headed Horus of Edfu and Hathor of Dendera. In two
rows, above, the king appears praying and offering sacrifices before
