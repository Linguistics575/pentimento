to Ania }. BENIHASAN. 28. Route. 197

Benilyrsan.

Donkeys (with good saddles) are in waiting at the 1ar1iting-p1atus of
the steamers, for the texcursion to the Speas Artemidos and the Rack Tombs
(there and. back 3-1 hrs.; Ir-ls. 611.). - Travellers ascending the river in
a. dahahiyeh should visit the Rook Tombs first, those descending should
visit the Speos first, in each case sending the duhahiyeh on to meet
them. - For travellers by railway the most convenient stations are Minyeh
and AM Karlie: (p. 190).

The village of Benilyuuw was founded towards the end of the
18th cent. by the inhabitants of the present Old Benihasan (see
below), who wished a widerspaee for cultivation near their abode. -
The route to the Specs Artemidos [ V2 hr's. ride) leads to the E., at
first through fields, then along an embankment on the edge of the
desert, in which is an Arab cemetery. In the vicinity is the eats'
graveyard, in which the cats sacred to Pakht, patron-goddess of this
region, were interred. Farther to the E. we reach the mouth of a
widi or ravine, with quarries of ancient date On the right (3.)
side of the ravine, about 600 ft. from its mouth, lies the temple.

The rock-temple of the goddess Pakht, called Speos Artémidos
by the Greeks, is known to the Arabs as Spam Mntar (Antar's stable),
after an ancient here. It consists of a vestibule and of an inner
chamber connected with the vestibule by a corridor. It was built
in the joint reign of Queen Makeré and King Thutmosis 111.; the
latter afterwards erased the names and representations of his sister
(p. 278), and Sethos I. inserted his own names in the blanks.

Over the Entrance to the temple is a long inswription in praise of the
reign of 1Iakcfg. Of the eight pillars which supported the VESTIBULE only
three now remain; these bear on their sides the names of Thutmosis 111.
and Sethos l. (originally Makeré). Rear Wall. To the left of the door,
Sethos L. between Ammon-HT (enthmned) and the 1iort-heatbed Pakht;
Thnth delivering a speech to the nine great gods of Kama ]; and to the
gods of Upper and Lower Egypt. To the right of the deer are three
reliefs: Sethus saorifhsing to Pakhtr Scthos receiving from Pakht the
hieroglyphies of the word'life', hanging from two Sceptres; Sethus blessed
by Thout. To the left in the Coluunoe the king is represented ofrering
wine to Hathor; to the right, he otl'ers her a cynocephalus. In the Ii'l1rt
wall of the INNER CHAMBEIL is a niche intended for a statue of the goddess.

To the W. (left) is a second grotto, on the outside of which are
the uutouches of Alexander 11., son of Roxana, and six scenes
representing the king in the company of the gods. The interior, which
was supported by pillars, is now in ruins; perhaps it was never Dom-
pleted. In the vicinity are several roek-tomhs of the New Empire,
in the form of rectangular chambers, with deep shafts.

We now return to the mouth of the desert-ravine and proceed
thence to the N., passing the ruins of Bmilmsan el- Kadim ('the
old'; comp. above). In 1/2 hr. we reach a ruined tower, whence the
path ascends the hill-slope to the -

*Rock Tombs of Benihasan (1/2 hr's. ride direct from the 1sud-
ing-plaee ]. These were constructed during the Middle Empire by
the princes and grandees of the town of Munet-Klmfu ('Nurse of
Khuhr) and rank among the most interesting monuments in all
