A great advance, was made when words, for which there was
no special symbol, began to be expressed by the pictures of other
and different objects, the phonetic siguUicamre of which, however,
happened to be the same. Thus, eigi, pr'to go out' was expressed
by the picture of a house, because a'house' also Was called pr;

s''son' by a'goose' gs } tp'first' by the symbol i tp'dagger'.

Many of' these symbols gradually came to be used for so many
different words that their original word-signifies/n was lost, and
they thenceforth were used as purely syllabic symbols. Thus, the

symbol p' originally'to tfy'wiys afterwards used for the syllable p'
in any Apritieajion; trr, originally'pigeou' and afterwards also trr
'great', was used for any syllable mr. In this way word-symbols
that had a single sound came to he used as letter e.g. 0 T
'mouth' was' used for r; m J,'lake' for J; 1 51-1'serpent'
(t is the feminine termination) for g; etc.

These syllable and literal symbols were, probably used at first
for grammatical purposes only (as suffixes), hut afterwards, owing-
to frequent ambiguities in the signifuuurce of the verbal sym-
bols, they were used to indicate the pronunciation in each par-
ticular ease and thus to render the reading easier. Thus to the
symbol Sb-r wr'great' a O r was frequently added, written thus



Sire wt, in order to indicate the pronunciation; or -'nkh'to live'
0
was followed by the two explanatory consonants Wm n and Â© M,

thus, tg) Will; or U nb'lord' was preceded by MAMA n, thus

W nb. Frequently all the consonants in a word were written
instead of merely the verbal symbol, thus (if?, I E Q .e'kht'field' in-

stead of gag s'kht.

In addition to these there was another class of hieroglyphics,
known as Determinatives, which were placed after the word in
order to give some hint as to its meaning. Thus, thy., s'foju'r'to drink'

is written [ 1%, with the determinative' (a man with
< C2 >

his finger in his mouth) in order to indicate that the idea expressed
by s' (a) wr has something to do with the mouth. These determinatives,
which greatly facilitate the reading of inscriptions, were freely used
especially in later hieroglyphic periods.

The hieroglyphic system, as we 11nd it in the earlier Egyptian
inscriptions, is already complete; its development, briefly sketrhed
above, had already come to a close. The following different classes
of hieroglyphic symbols were used simultaneously.
