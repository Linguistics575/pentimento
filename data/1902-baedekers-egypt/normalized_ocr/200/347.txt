nmnts. Some emmeptiuu ofthe enormous amount of labour involved
may he obtained, when we learn that, aceordiug to Prof. Flinders
Petrie's calculation, about 2,300,000 separate blocks of stone, each
containing 40 cubic ft., were required for the Pyramid of Kheops,
and that nearly all were quarried on the E. bank of the Nile and
bad to be conveyed through the plain to the desert-plateau.

The Comtmction of the Pyramids has been admirably described
by Herodotus, the earliest writer on the subject7 who visited Egypt

about /r70-460 BA).

Herodotus states (IL 125) that'there were about 100,000 men employed
annually for three months in constructing the Great Pyramid of Kheopsi.
They first made the mad for the transport of the stones from the Nile
to the Libyan Mts.; fur the length of the road ammmm tcr five stadia
(1017 yds.), its breadth is ten fathums (ro it), and its height, at the
highest places, is eight fathoms (48 ft.), and it is constructed entirely of
polished stone with figures engraved on it H. Tea years were thus enn-
aumed in making this road and the subterranean rhembers (for the eoffhrs).
The eonstar11etion of the Pyramid itself eeeupied twenty years. Each or
the four sides measures eight piethm (820 ft.), and the height is the
same. It is covered with polished stones, well jointed, none of which is
less than thirty feet long. This pyramid was first built in the form ofa
night of steps. After the workmen luul completed the pyramid in this
form. they raised the other stones (used for the inerustation) by means
of machines, made of shurt beams, from the ground of the first tier of
steps; and after the stone was placed there it was raised to the second
tier by another machine; fur there were as many machines as there were
tiers of steps; or perhaps the same machine, if it was easily moved, was
raised from one tier to the other, as it was required furliftinz the stones.
The highest part of the pyramid was thus finished first [ by smoothing),
the parts adjoining it were taken next, and the lowest part, next to the
earth, was completed last. It was recorded on the pyramid, in Egyptian
writing, how many redishes, wrriosss, and roots of garlic had been distrib-
uted mnung the wovlsmcrs, and ifl rightly remember what the interpreter
who read the Writing told me fft, the meney they cost amounted tn aix-
teen hundred talents of silver (upwards of 350, COOL). If this was really
the case, how much mere must then have been spent on the iron with
which they worked, end on the food and clothing of the workmen,'

In modern times many eager discussions have been held as to
the mode in which the Pyramids were erected and the meaning of
the account given by Herodotus, The most important questions
seem to be: Cl) How could Kheops, when he ascended the throne
and chose an area of 82,000 sq. yards for his monument, know
that his reign would be so unusually long as to enable him to com-
plete it? [ 2) If one of the builders of the great pyramids had died

+ Aeeurning tn Prof. Flinders Petrie, these three months fell during the
inundation, when field-work was at at stv1d-stilt end the. services of100, C00
men for trumsporting the stones could be easily enough obtained. The
stone cutters and masons were probably engaged all the year round in
the quarries and tn the pyramid itself.

"This route is still trircea1rlo. It terminated on the E. side of the
Pyramid of Kheops (see Plan and p. 127).

iff It is unlikely that the. interpreters. who attended trztvellerslike the
drugumans of the present day, were able to read hiecrox1yphies. They
probably repeated mere popular traditions regarding the pyramids'ud
other munumentS, with embellishments end exaggeratione of their own.
