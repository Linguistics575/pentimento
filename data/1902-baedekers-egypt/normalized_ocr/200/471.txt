Asiti.t, or'Sit2.t (the name of which still preserves the ancient
Egyptian Syowt), enjoyed considerable importance, even in anti-
quity,'rhietly owing to its favourable situation in the midst of an
extensive and fertile plain and at the beginning of a great caravan
route leading to the oases in the Libyan desert and theme to the
Sud√©n. The town was the capital of the Upper Sycamore Nome and
the chief seat of the worship of the god Wepwnt, who was repre-
sented as a mckal or wolf of the desert. This latter circumstance
gave rise to the Greek name Lycopolis or'w 01f town'. The modern
Assiut. which extends for about a mile from E. to W.., is the largest
town (over 42,000 inhab.) in Upper Egypt, the capital of a pro-
vinoe, and the residence of the Mudir. It has, however, lost part of
its commercial importance since the great caravans from W. Africa
have frequented other routes and places. The tine pottery of Assiitt,
especially its bottles and pipe-bowls, is justly celebrated and forms
an important article in its export trade, which also deals in linen,
embroidered leather goods, carved ivory, natron, soda, and corn,
Near the harbour are several large palm-gardens, in Which also grow
pomegranate, tig, and other fruit trees. These gardens are let at
high prices and produce rich harvests of fruit. The streets and
bazaars are full of busy life, especially on Saturdays, when the
people of the neighbourhood fioek into the market.

ginning of the 4th cent. onwards Christianity was dominant in the town
and neighbourhood. Pious believers took refuge in the caves of thc
nerropolis to live rt Jife of penitenre apart from the world. One of these,
John of aycopviis, at the end of the 4th cent., bore the reputation of a
saint and even of a prophet. Theodosius sent an embassy to him to cn-
quire the. outcome of the civil war. The auehorite foretold a complete
but bloody victory, and this prophecy was fulti11ed in the victory of
Theodosius over Eugenius at Aquileia in 3'34 A.D. - The Egyptian Missiun
