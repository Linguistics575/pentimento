the sultan Selim (p. xuviii) placed a garrison of Bosniaus here. Their de-
scendants were defeated in 1811 by the ileeiug Mamelnkes, but in the
8ame YBar lbrihim Pasha. (p. xcix) captured and destroyed the fortress.

Paths ascend both on the N. and S. to the only Gate of the for-
tress, which lies on the N. side. This is embellished with the
Egyptian hollow cornice and the sun-disk. The Girdle Walt ofmugh
stones is supported on the S. side by a substructure of carefully
hewn blocks. The interior of the fortress is occupied by a Lunfused
group of houses, built ot' rough stones, but incorporating fragments
of older buildings, such as portions of columns used for thresholds.
Two of the larger buildings are still in good preservation, vix. a
Byzantine Church in the middle and an Egyptian Temple, with a
pylon, in the NW. corner. The church was afterwards used as a
mosque, but a dedicatory cross is still to be seen on one of the tJol-
umns. The temple contains no inscriptions. A steep flight of steps
descends on the W. side to the river. The view from the castle-hill is
very liiuyi to the E. rise hills r-rowued with the tombs of shekhs, while
the Nile flows below; to the W. lies the tawny desert, contrasting
with the verdant fields and graves and the grey houses ofAnibeh.

Close to the s. slope of the hill lie the ruins of a smal ] Tours, sul-
rounded by a wall. Farther up the valley is a large Cemetery, With simple
phriatiau graves and some brick tombs on at more ambitious ewlu. There
"a similar, cemetery in the \alley to the N. of the castle.

In the steep W. slope of the eastle-hill are live Membrint Re-
cesscs, of the Middle Empire. These new lie at some height above
the river-bank and some are very tliflicmlt of access, but originally
they "ere reached by means of steps from a path skirting the river
at a higher level than the present path. The first (ou the S.) was
constiucted in the reign of Thutnmsis Ill. by Nehi, governor of
Ethiopia. The second was constructed in the reign of Ramses II.
by Setuw, governor of Ethiopia, "ho is represented in it with his
otfieia1s. The third chapel dates from the joint reign of That-
mosis III. and Hatshepsowet, but the name of the latter is fWery-
where defaced. Both rulers, each beside a deity, ere represe1rted
on the rear-wall. The fourth Chapel, the most important, belongs
to Amenophis If. Ou the right side-wall the king receives tribute
of all kinds (including a panther) from two orfieials. 0n the left
wall the king appears conducted by Horus, lord of Beheni Ovidi
Haifa ], to a row of gods. In a niche in the birek-wall is the statue
of the king, embraced by Horus of Mem (on the right) and by Satet
(on the left). - The i'1ftl1 recess has no sculptures.

On a steep c, liit facing the river, to the S. of Keer Ibrim, are a
Relief and Inscription of Sethaa L, commemorating a 1iotory. beside
it are graffiti of elephants, giraffes, etc.

The mountains presently retire, leaving room for a strip of culti-
vated land. Numerous Szilciyehs or water-wh) are seen. - 30 M.
