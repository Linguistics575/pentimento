naturally surrender, to a great extent, both their freedom of choice

much below that of an independent tour.

COINAGE (comp. the tables before the title-page and at the end
of the book). The Egyptian Pound ('Livre Egyptienne'; ME.) is
worth 20s. (hi., and is divided into 100 Pimtres, worth 10 Millz'émes
each. The Arabic name for the piastre is Kim ]; (p1. Jfurttsls; pro-
nounced in Cairo Tirsh,'urt? sh), but the European name is Bwrry-
where current. Travellers should note the distinction that is still
frequently made between the'great piastre' ([ ci'rsh tarifa) worth
10 milliemes and the'little (or half) piastre' (lamb suyh), worth
5 milliémes. - Egyptian gold coins are seldom met with, their
place being taken by the British sovereign (Ninth ingtisi = 97 piss.
5 mill.), the French Napoleon (20 fr. 5 Bint---" 77 pies. 2 mill.), and the
Turkish pound (Mejidiyeh = 87 pias. 71/2 mill. == 185.), ail of whinh
are legally current. At Alexandria and Suez, and a few other points,
reckoning in francs is still common. Where British influence is
strong, as in places with large garrisons, the word Shilling is used for
the Rulfa Riyal, which is equivalent to about is. 31/211.

Ohsmete coins are rare in Egypt, bat counterfeit or depreciated (Le. worn
or perforated) pieces are common enough. As these are more likely to be
oirereil to foreigners than to natives, travellers should be on their guard
against them when obtaining change. A liberal supply of small change is
more essential in the East than anywhere else (comp, pp. xxii, 2B ].

PASSPORTS are usually asked for at all the Egyptian ports, and if
the traveller is unprovided with one he is liable to detention and
great inconvenience. The passport is given up at the e11stom-ho11se
and reclaimed at the traveller's consulate or at Cairo. Bankers fre-
quently require strangers to establish their identity by some such
document; and the countenance and help of consuls must also
depend upon the proof of nationality ofhmyil to them by the traveller.

A British Foreign ofi'um Passport (price 2s, "r ageut's fee ls. 6d.) may be
obtained in London through W. J. Adams, 59 Fleet Sti-eet-7 Mass, MO West
Strand-, C. Smith k Sons, 63 Chatting Cross, etc.

CUSTOM Host. The custom-house examination is generally
carried out with great thoroughness, though with perfect politeness.
The objects'shiirily sought for are tobacco and cigars, on which a.
somewhat high tax is levied (25, 40, or 100 pias. per kilogramme or
21/51bs., according to quality, comp, p. xxx). The exportation of
antiquities is forbidden, except with a special r: ertiticate of permis-
sion; and luggage is accordingly examined again as the traveller
quits the country. The Bustom-house is now under European man-
agement, and it is advisable to refrain from an attempt to facilitate
matters by bnkshish (p. xx). If luggage be forwarded across the
frontier, the keys mast be sent with it; but it is very desirable to
superintend the toustom-house examination in person.
