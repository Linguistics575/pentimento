Ixxii DOCTRINES OF EL-ISLAM.

festivals some of them fall into akind of epileptic convulsion, and foam
at the mouth; but no notice is taken of them, and they are left to re-
cover without assistance. - The zikrs of the dancing dervishes Which
formerly tnok place in the Tekkiyeh el-Mulawiych, to the s_w. of the Place
Sultan Haaan (Pl. Jr, 6), are now discontinued.

The WORSHIP or SAINTS AND MABTYES was inculcated in con-
nection with EI-rslirn at an early period. The faithful undertook
pilgrimages to the graves of the departed in the belief that death
did not interrupt the possibility of communication with them.
Thus the tomb of Mohammed at Medina, and that of his grandson
Hosén at Kerbela, became particularly famous, and every little
town soon boasted of the tomb of its particular saint. In many of
the villages the traveller will observe small dome-goFered huiltl-
ings with grated windows. These are saints' tombs and are called
'Shékhs' Ceomp. p. clxiii).'Shah' also means a chief or old man.
Shreds of cloth are often seen suspended t'romrthe gratings of these
tombs, or on certain trees Which are considered sacred, having
been placed there by devout persons. About the end of the 18th
century a reaction against the abuses of El-fslim sprang up in
Central Arabia. The WAHHABITES, or Wahhabees, named after
their founder'Ahd erl-Walilrib, endeavoured to restore the religion
to its original purity; they destroyed all tombs oisaiats, including
even those of Mohammed and Hosén, as objects of superstitious
reverence, and sought to restore the primitive simplicity of the
pruphet's code of morals; they even forbade smoking as being iii-
toxicating. They soon became a great political power, and had not
Mohemmed'Ali deemed it his interest to sl1pITess them, their in-
tiuemee would have been far more widely extended than it now is.

We have hitherto spoken of the doctrines of the Sunniles (from
sunna,'tririition'), who form one great sect ofEl-1slim. At an early
period the SHi'ITRs (from sWa,'seet') seceded from the Sunnites.
They assigned to VAli, the sou-in-law of Mohammed, a rank equal
"even superior to that of the prophet himself; they regarded him
as an iruraraatiou of the Deity, and believed in the divine mission
of the imirms descended from him. El-Mahdi, the last of these, is
believed by them not to have died, but to be awaiting in conceal-
ment the coming of the last day. The Persians are all Shirites. T0-
wards the West also Shi'itism was widely disseminated at an early
period, particularly in Egypt under the régime of the Fatimite
sovereigns. The Shtites are extremely fanatical, refusing even to
eat in the society of persons of a different creed. As to the other
sects, chiefly oonfh1ed to Syria (Metdwileh, Ixnm'iliyeh, Nosairtyeh,
Druses, etc.) see Baedeker's Syria and Palestine.
