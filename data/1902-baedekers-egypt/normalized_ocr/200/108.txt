Nitsir. The emits, exasperated by his treachery and in-
trigues, dethroned him in 1389; but in 1390 he trir1mph-
antly re-entered Cairo. Be fought successfully against the
Mongoliaus under Timur and the Osmans under Bajazid.

Femg (pp. 33, 05 ], his son, had scarcely ascended the
throne, as a boy of thirteen years of age, before the os-
mans7 and a little later the Mongols, again began to
threaten the Egyptian dorniuioas. Farag proeeeder1viiytori-
ously as far as Damascus; but owing to disseusions among
his emirs he was obliged to return to Cairo. After the
defeat of the Turks by the Mongols under Timur at the
battle of Angora, Farag was compeiled to enter into nego-
ciatione with Timur. The latter years of Farag's reign
were constantly disturbed by the rebellions of his emirs,
particularly El-Mahmadi Muaiyad. He was at length com-
pelled by the insurgents to capitulate at Damascus, and
was executed (May, 1412).

El-Mahnmdi Muaiyad (p. 47) succeeded Fasag. His reign
was ehietly occupied with victorious campaigns against his
unruly Syrian vassals, in which he was greatly aided by
the military talents of his son 2br/ihtrn.

He exacted heavy contributions from Christians and Jews,
and he re-enacted and rigorously enforced the sumptusry laws
of "Omar, Mutawakkil, Hakim, and Mohammed en-tWir. Not
only were the colours to be worn by the C'hristiaus and Jews
prescribed [ the costume ot' the former being dark-blue, with
black turbans, and a wooden cross weighing 51175. hung round
their necks; that of the latter. yellow, with black turhnus.
and a. black ball hung from their necks); but the fashion "
their dress and length of their turbans, and even the costume
of their women, were so regulated as entirely to distinguish
them from the followers of the prophet.

Bursbey (Berisbai; p. 66), who had for a time been the
vicegerent of an infant sultan, ascended the throne on April
1st, li22. He waged successful campaigns against Cyprus
and the Mongols.

Knit Bey (pp. 55, 66) was one of the last independent
Mameluke sultans ongypt. Both as a general and a diplo-
matist he ism5iyssst'ully maintained his position against
the Turks (Su1taus Mohammed and Bajazid), and even
inflii5tei1 serious losses on them; but the refractory Mame-
lukee obstructed his undertakings and in 1496 compelled
him to ahdicate in favour of his son Mohammad, a boy of
fourteen.

El-Ghuri, Kamuweh et-0tlri (pt 47), once a slave of Ifiit
Bey, was upwards of sixty years of age when he ascended
the throne, but he still possessed sufiieient vigour to keep
the unruly emirs in check. Already seriously injured by
