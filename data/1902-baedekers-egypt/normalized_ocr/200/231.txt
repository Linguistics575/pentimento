(a Coptic name), with 14,300 inhab, almost exclusively natives,
Iies at the mouth of the Rosetta arm of the Nile (far' el-yltarbi), the
ancient Bnlbitinic arm (p. Iii). During the middle ages and in
more recent times its commercial prosperity was considerable, until
the construction of the Mal.tmildtyeh Canal (pp. 11, 18) diverted its
trade to Alexandria. The streets contain many small but substantial
houses in a peculiar, half-European style, with projecting stories
and windows towards the outside The many gardens yield ex-
cellent fruit. Numerous columns from edifiees of the heathen
and Christian periods, some of them of granite and some of marble,
are seen lying in various open spaces, particularly in one of con-
siderahle size near the river, and a number of others are built into
the houses. The spacious Masque of Sakhmn is also embellished
with many ancient columns. The hill of Abu Ifaadfir, to the S. of
the town, which commands a line view, is supposed by some topo-
graphers to have been the site of the ancient Botbitine, but it is
more likely that this lay to the N. of Rosetta. - The fortiiieations
to the N. of the town are not shown except by permission of the
