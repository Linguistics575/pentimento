Amenophis w. Cf392-f374 B.C. ] endeavoured to replace the old
religion by the worship of a single deity, vis. the sun, an
endeavour perhaps to provide a god that should be worshipped in
common by all thopeoples ofthe extensive empire (p. cxxii). The
movement was probably instigated by the priests of Heliopolis
and was directed at Mst only against the gods of Thebes, who,
during the New Empire, had thrown all others into the shade.
Many of the ancient deities, especially those of Thebes, Were
fanatically'perseented', their images and names being removed
from all monuments. For his own original name, in which the
name ofAmmou ocvurs, the king substituted that of Ebh-m-atory
0r Spirit of the Sun. Tell el-'Arnarna (p. 203), near Which is the
king's tomb Cp. 209 ], was made the napital instead of Thebes.
After the death of Amenophis internal commotious broke out
and the recently intrmlueed'religion was again abolished.

Among his successors (137i-f35 () 11.0.) were Eyé (tomb at Bibin
