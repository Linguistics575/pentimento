The *Temple of Isis, dedicated to Isis and her eon Rarpoeratiys,
was the principal sanctuary on the island and probably occupies
the site of an earlier shrine. Its erection, begun by Ptolemy Phila-
delphus, was completed in its essential details by Euergetes L, but
its embellishment with inscriptions and reliefs was a very gradual
process, and at not a fow points was never finished,

The Fms'r PYLON, 150 ft. broad and 60 ft. high, consists of two
to were and a central povtal, decoratsut by Nektanebos with the custom-
ary reliefs. On the front of the right tower appears a huge figure
of the Pharaoh (Ptolemy Neos Dionysus) in the usual attitude,
grasping a band of enemies by the hair, and raising his club for the
fatal stroke. To the left stand Isis, the hawk-headed Horus of
Edfu, and Hathor. Above are two reliefs: to the right, the king
(Neos Dionysus) presents the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt to
Horus and Nephthys; to the left, he offers incense to Isis and Har-
pocretes. On the left tower are _simi1ar representations, and at the
foot are numerous dcmotic and Greek inscriptions. A doorway,
embellished with reliefs by Philometor, leads through the left tower
direct to the entrance of the Birth House (p. 340). In front of the
pylon formerly stood two ohelisks, erected by Euergetes II., and two
lions, all of granite. One of the ohelisks (which bears an important
Greek inscription) and portions of the other are now in England;
while one of the lions has been placed on the base of the left ahe-
lisk, and the other lies on the ground. - The terrace is modern,
dating from 1896.

Adjoining theE. pylon-tower, to the right, is an elegant Gateway,
which was built by Ptolemy Philadelphue and originally stood in a
brick-wal ]. It is embellished with reliefs of Ptolemy (on the lintel)
and Tiberius (on the jemhs).

The Â°AECENT "1112; PuoN is recommended. The winding staircase
begins in the S.E. angle of the fore-court (see below). Several unadorned
and feebly lighted chambers are found within the towers. The view
from the top commands the whole island and its surroundings.

We now pass through the central gateway, within which, to the
right, is a French inseriptioMUn 7 de la republique') commemorating
Napoleon's Egyptian campaign and the pursuit of the Mamelukes
by General Desaix in 1799,
