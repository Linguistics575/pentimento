off, and the reddish tint which enlivened the face has almost dis-
appeared. A fragment of the beard lies on the ground beside the
Sphinx. But in spite of allir1juries, it preserves an impressive
expression of strength sad majesty: the eyes have a thoughtful, far-
away espresssion, the lips wear a half-smile, and the whole face, as
even'Abde11attf remarked, is of graceful and beautiful type. The
entire height of the mmiument, from the crown or the head to the
pavement on which the fore-legs of the lion re'st, is said to he 66 ft.
The ear, according to Mariette, is 41/2 ft., the nose 5 ft. 7 in., and
the mouth 7ft. 7 in. in length; and the extreme breadth of the
face is 13 ft. 8 inches. If the traveller stands on the upper part
of the car, he cannot stretch his hand as far as the crown of the
head. There is a hollow in the head.

The Excavation ofthe Sphinx, so far as is now kauwn, was first under-
taken by Thutmusis IV. (see below), During the Ptulcmaic and Roman
periods the eolossus was several times restored, and Was highly admired
and revered, as numerous inscriptions upon it testify. It is all the more
eurioas, therefore, that the Sphinx is mentioned neither by Herodotus nor
by any later Greek traveller. The mutilations which now distigure it date
from the Arab domination. In 1380 it fell a victim to the iconoclastic zeal
of a fanatic shekh, and it was afterwards used as a target by the barbarous
3Lunelakes. _ In the present century, the Sphinx was first cumpletcly
excavated by Cavigh'a (p. 116), at the cost (450!) of an English society.
He discovered the tlight of steps which ascended to the stupendous mon-
ument, and also found between the paws of the lion a carefully laid
pavement, at the end of which next to the breast of the Sphinx rose a
kind of open temple. The latter was enclosed by two partitions, through
Which ran a passage, in the middle of which was a small tigare of a re-
cumbent lion, facing the Sphinx. In the background and at each side were
memorial stones erected by Thutmesiz IV. and Ramses U. (see below). The
Sphinx has also been excavated by Mariette, and in 1883 by Mamm'a.

Between the paws of the Sphinx, which are concealed by blocks
of limestone, stands an Altar, and in front of the breast of the
colessus is the Memorial Stone of Thutmosis IV., both of red granite.

On the upper part of the latter, to the right and left, appears Thut-
mosis IV., saerifieing to the sun-gud Hurmaehis, who is represented es a
Sphinx The inscription below relates that the Pharaoh while a, prmee
hunting lions fell asleep one day in the shadow of the Sphinx, and that
the god appeared and commanded. the prince to'free him from the desert
Sand that encumbered him'. As soon as Thutmosis ascended the throne,
he rcmcmhered his dream and caused the Sphinx to be excavated.

About 50 yds. to the S.E. of the Sphinx is situated the *Granite
Temple, erroneously called Temple of the Sphinx, but in reality the
sanctuary ofthe god Solcaris-Osiris. This large building constructed
of granite and alabaster, discovered by Mariette in 1803, is a tine
example of the simple and majestic architecture of a period when
the art of working the hardest kinds of stone had already attained
perfection. The exterior of the temple is still concealed by rubbish,
but the interior has been partly excavated.

walls against the encroachment of the sand, we pass through a door
