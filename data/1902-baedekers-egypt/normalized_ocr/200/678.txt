NORTH WALL (right; PL l). The suhject on this wall is the
Battle of Kudesh, the culminating event in the Hittite war, with
which we have already become acquainted in the Ramesseum (pp. 284,
285), and at Luxor, Kamak, and Ahydos.

In the Lower Half of the representation we see first the march
of the Egyptian army, which consists of infantry and eharioteers;
then (between the doors to Rooms Fand Cl), the Egyptian camp, with
the shields of the soldiers arranged round it in a kind of Stockade.
The bustle of the camp is represented with great vivacity; the un-
harnessed horses receiving their fodder, the resting soldiers, the
camp-followers, etc.; to the right is the royal tent. The third picture
shows the king on his throne, holding a council of war with his
