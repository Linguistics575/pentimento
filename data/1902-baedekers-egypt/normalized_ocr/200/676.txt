w., so that at sunrise the sun's rays penetrate to the innermost sane-
tuary._ Burcklturdt first brought to Europe the news of this sanetuaxy
(1812'), and in 1817 Betzoni freed it from the sand which had blown
into it from the W. desert. It was again laid bare by Lepsiasirtl8U
ami by Mariette in 1869 (when the Empress Eugenie visited it);
while more recently i in 1802) the fneade was restored and two walls
built to protect the temple from the sand by Capt. Joh'nstone, R, E.

As we approach the temple, we first reach aFore goisrt (Pl. A),
hewu out of the rock, to which a tlight of steps ascends from the
rlvex. At the bark of this space rises the imposing faehde of the
temple. The front of' this terrace is embellished with rows of captives
anti a'hollow cornice, end is bounded by a balustreiie, bearing in-
scriptions m honour of Ammon end Pi-uarn1achis. Behind the
balustrade originally stood figures of hawks and small statues of
kings. Here our attention is attracted by the fo "*Colossi cftltrmses' fl.
[ PL u, b, c, d), hewn out of' the cliff against which their backs axe
placed, and arranged in pairs on each side of the, entrance to the
temple. Each of these figures is over 65 ft. in height, Le, larger than
the Colossi ofMemnon (p. 305 ]; but in spite of the enormous scale, the
workmanship is admirable, and the countenanres have a singularly
pleasant and intelligent expression. They are best viewed from the
sand-hill to the N. of the temple or from the river. The mihl court-
teuanue and characteristic nose of Ramses Ir. axe best preserved in
the first colossus 0n the S. (Pl. a). The second colossus has un-
fortunately been deprived of its head and shoulders, which now lie
on the ground before it. The upper part of' the third colosmh was
patched up under Sethos L, who added the support under the
right arm.

Upon his head the king wears the double crown; his hands rest upon
his knees; and from his neck bangs a ring bearing the name of Ramses II,
which is also carved upon the upper arm and between the legs. To the
right and left of each colossus and between their legs are tmaller ligures
of other members of the. royal family. To the. left of the f1vst colossus
(PL a) is Princess Neht-tew√©, to the right, L'errt-Anat, between the legs an
tInit/iii) princess. To the left of the second unlossus (P1. b) is Tu-E,
the mother of Ramses IL, lo the. right is hie wife Nehret-erE, and between
his legs, Prince Amea-her-kl1Dpsher. On each of the thrones of culussi b
and c, on the sides next the entsanre, are two Nile-gods, wreathing the
Mral emblems [ papyrus and lily) of Lower and Upper Egypt round the
hieroglyphic eymbul for'to unite' (comp. p. lexix), while below is a row
of fettered prisoners, those. on the left heinghegroes, those on the right,
Syrians.

Upon the two S. eolossi are a. number of Greek, Carien, and Phamieian
inscriptions, of considerable philologiea1 and historical interest. These
were. carved by soldiers who had penetrated thus far in the course of
military expeditions The most remarkable is u Greek inscription on
the left leg of the injured colossus (Pl. b), written by Greek mercenaries
seat by Psammetikh I. from Elephantine to Nubia. They had advanced
to the second vataraet and wrute this inscription on their Way back. The
English tviuraiation runs as t'ullows: -

'When Kim: Psammutiu us came to Elepltantine, they wrote this, who
came with Psammetichus, son of Theoeles, and proceeded vi?) Kerkis as
far as the river allowed of it. Pntasimto led the foreigners, Amasis the
