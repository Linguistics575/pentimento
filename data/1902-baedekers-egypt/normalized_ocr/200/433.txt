In the desert, to the E, fron the E. hank ofthe lake and to the NW,
from Tnmiych, rises the mound of 1mm UsMm, covering the ruins of Ku-
wait, k Greek town frequently mentioned in local history, with a temple
of Puepher6s and Petesuehus. - The mound 11mm el-AU, 7 u. to the E.
of Karztnis, marks the site of Bucchias, with a ruined Greek temple. Both
mounds were explored in 18:16 by Messrs. Hogarth and Grenfel ], at the
expense of the Egypt Exploration Fund,

The ruins marking the site of Kasr 1fartm lie at the S.W. end of
the Birket Ifart1a, We land on the promontory ot' Khashm Khalil,
which is overgrown with tamarisks and reeds. Ascending thence
101055 the desert for about an hour, we reach the temple, which is
now 21/s M. from the lake, though it originally stood on its bank.
The fishermen object to pass the night here, being afraid of the
Beduins and the'Afrtt' (evil spirits).

liner Earth is a fairly well preserved temple, of the late Pto-
lemaic period. The numerous traces of an ancient town that sur-
round it are probably those of Dionysias, Which was situated on the
extreme w. verge of the Roman province of Egypt, at the beginning
of the caravan route to the'Small Oasis' (Bahriyeh, p. 195). A tyir-
cular foundation-wan indicates the site of an ancient cistern. The
walls of the temple consist of carefully hewn blocks of hard lime-
stone. This temple, like almost all the shrines in the oases, was
dedicated to the ram-headed Ammon-Khnum, as is proved by two
figures of this deity standing at the highest part of the posterior wall
of the upper story of the open roof. The winged sun-disk occurs over
each gateway in the building. There are 110 ancient inscriptions.

The temple is 20 yds. in width across the fngade, and 29 yds. in length.
The entrance. facing the E., is approached by at lofty and carefully enn-
structed platform, M yds. in length, forming a fore-eourt. On the thyade
of the temple, to the right IX.) of the eutrirruurdoor, ie a massive, semi-
circular projection, vesemb1iug the half of a huge column. On the lower
floor are the apartments of the temple which were dedicated to wovship.
In the first three Antemoms the ground slopes down towards the Sanctuary,
which was divided into three small rooms at the heck. The sanctuary is
iianked by two narrow passages, each of which is adjo ned by three rooms.
The Intercoms also have adjacent chambers from which we may enter the
cellars, or ascend by two flights of step" to the upper floor with its different
apartments, and thence to the roof, whence we obtain an extensive view
of the remains of the ancient city, of the lake, and the desert. Over the
doors leading into the second and third anteruoms and into the sanctuary,
instead of the ordinary concave cornice, there is a series of Urzeus snakes.

To the E, of the large temple are situated two smaller Rumen temples,
in tolerable preservation. the larger of which. situated 300 paces from
the smaller: is not without interest. Its walls (18 ft. by til ft.) consist of
good burnt bricks. and its substructures of solid stone. The calla ter-
minates in a niche resembling an apse; on each of the side-walls are two
half-eolruuns. which, as the fragments lying on the ground show, belong
to the Ionic order.

About 81/g M. to the E. of Kagr 1iar6r1 are the ruins of Kagr eI-Benit,
the nneient Euhemevia, including the remains of a temple of Sukhns and
Isis. -.- Beside the village of Ibxtit, 13/. M. tn the 8.13:. of this point, lie
the ruins and the necropolis of the ancient Theadebphm; and 5 M. to the
N.W. nf Harit, almost due W. from Kaer Ifariin, are the ruins of the en-
cient Philateris, now known as Wadfu. All these plaees, which were founded
under the early Ptolemics in the reclaimed bed ofLakc Mceris, have been
recently explored by the English travellers Grenl'ell and Hunt,
