were followed by the destruction of many pagan statues and the
obliteration of many pagan inscriptions. The Nile, which annually
overllowed as far as the temple of Kamak, and the saline exudatinns
of the soil, wrought harm; jackals and other animals sought shelter
in the subterranean chambers; many tombs, at first occupied by
Christian hermits, were converted into peasants' dwellings; Christian
churches were erected in the temple-halls, and houses were built
between the columns of the temple at Luxor. Carefully hewn blocks
and slabs were removed from the monuments, which were used as
quarries, and many limestone details were thrown into the furnace
and reduced to lime. Whither the enormous population of the
bundrisd-gsted Thebes betook itself is unknown. A few widely
scattered villages alone now represent the giant city.

The main entrance to the temple by the great pylon (p. 239) is now
closed. We therefore leave the pylon to the last and proceed from the
road on the bank of the river to the eourt ot' Ameuophis III, (p. 2M) and
thence through the culunnade (p.144) to the court of Ramses u. (p. 240),
where we begin our inspection ofthe various chambers. Adnu% rior1-tiekets
(p. 184) must not be forgotten. In the following description. however, the
pylon is mentioned first. A'Notice exp1ieative des Rnines du Temple de

*Temple of Luxor (P1. A, B, 3, 4). The mediawal and later
buildings which once encumbered it have been cleared away, though
the little mosque of Atm'l Wggisg still stands within its N. part.
The temple was built by Amenophis III. (18th Dyn.) on the site of
an older sanctuary of sandstone, and was dedicated to Amman, his
wife Mat, and their son, the moon-god Khons. Like all Egyptian
temples, it included the sanctuaries with their adjoining rooms and
enteehamhers, a large hypostyle hall, and an open peristyle court.
The last was to have been preceded by a large hypostyle hall with
three aisles, bat only the central row of columns was erected at the
death of the king. The temple was then 207 yds. in length, while
its greatest breadth was 60 yds. Opposite the tempie was a granite
Ithapel (p. 240), erented by Ihutmosis Ill. During the religious
revolution under Amenophis IV. (p. 203) the representations and
name of Ammon were obliurtrtsyd, and a sanctuary of the'Sun' was
built beside the temple. Tut-eukh-Amon (p. lxxxii) transferred the
royal residence back to Thebes, and caused the uutinished great
hypostyle hall to he hastily completed and the walls to be decorated
with reliefs (p. MI), in which Haremheb afterwards substituted
his own name for that of his predecessor. The'Temple of the Sun'
was destroyed, and in the reign of Sethos the figures of Ammon
