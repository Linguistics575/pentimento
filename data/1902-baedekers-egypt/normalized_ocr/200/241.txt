28 Route d. CAIRO, Physieiaoe.

animals are to be found in great numbers at all the most frequented points;
at night in front of the cafés; and the stranger who wishes to hire a
donkey is sometimes welt-nigh overwhelmed hy the charge of light cavalry
to mect his wishes. The donkeymoys of Cairo (preferable to older drivers)
often possess a considerable fund of humour, and their good spirits react
upon their donkeys. The traveller should sternly repress the first symp-
turn of the usual cruel goading of the animals to quicken their pace
Galloping is forbidden within the town. The balgshish should be propor-
tionate to the quality of the donkey and the behaviour of the itor1key-boy.

Dragomens (comp. p. xxii). Only travellers who are pressed for time
require a cicernne. The best (5-8 fr. per day) are to be had at the hotels,
where also a list of the guides licensed by the police may he seen. If,
however, the traveller knows Il few wards of Arabic, and is nut in l
hurry, he will soon find his way through every part of the city and the
environs with the aid of his donkey-hoy alone.

Cycles may be hired from Marina :9 thr., Shéri'a liapr en-Nil (Road.
Puint Snares).
