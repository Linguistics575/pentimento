musque-like Cenotaph: of famous saints, such as the Shekh Mirlrrntid, the.
ShEkh'Ali, the Lady (Seyidneh) Zenah, ete, whose memory is celebrated
hy festivals on their birthdays, ete.

The Granite Quarries (Arabic Ma'ddin), from which the ancient
Egyptian builders and sculptors drew their supplies (comp. p. 328),
are situated in the hills to the S., and may he reached in 1/4 hr.
either direct from the Bishirin camp or from the town by a route
leading via the Arab cemeteries (p. 329) and then to the E., passing
a grove of tamarisks. Numerous blocks of granite lie where they
were left when the works were given up; c.g. the huge black (marked
'ohelisk' on the Plan) in the N. Quarry, measuring 92 ft. in length
and 101/2 ft. in breadth at the broadest part. A moderately lofty
cliff shows manifold traces of the industry of the ancient stone-
cutters. The blocks were detached from the clilfs by boring nu-
merous holes along a prescribed line, driving wedges into these, and
then wetting the wedges. By this process tolerably smooth and
even fractures were obtained. Frequently the blocks were finished
on three sides before being finally detached. Statues, sareophagi,
ohelisks, eto., were also roughly worked over by the stone-cutters
in the quarries in order to lessen the weight for transport. The hill
above the N. quarry commands a wide prospect, including the con-
vent of St. Simeon (p. 334) in a desert-valley, to the W., beyond
the Nile.

The S. Quarry, 1/2 hr. farther to the S., contains still more
rough-hom sculptures, ready for removal. The quarry opens to
the E., facing the desert. On a rock here may be seen an inscrip-
tion with the name of Amenophis 111., though the name and fhyms
of the stone-cutter who carved it have been obliterated. Beside it
two trough-shaped sarcophagi have been begun (in the Ptolemaie
or in the Roman period); and in the vicinity are the unfinished
r'olossus of a king (covered, except the feet, with sand), and alerge
quadrangular block, perhaps intended for the shrine of a god. Far-
ther on, near the railway, and towards the top of the cliff, is a figure
of Osiris (called Ramses by the natives), about 20 ft. in height.
This point commands a fine view of the desert and in the direction
nf Phila.

A massive Embankecl Road, by which the huge blocks were
conveyed to the Nile, runs from the quarries to Assuin and is used
to this day. -. If we follow the railway-line we reach the railway-
station of Shell√©l (p. 335) in 1/4 hr.



The verdant island of' Elephantine, with its luxuriant palm-
trees, attracts all travellers. The Arabs call it merely Gczi-reh, Ce,
'island', or G'estret A8sutn. It is reached by small boat Crigiikeh)
in a few min. from the Lyndirtg-platyy, and the entire visit takes
barely an hour. There are two villages on Elepharttine, whose in-
habitants speak Nubian.
