DAHsutht. 9. Route 153

If time permit, the traveller may now proceed to the 8. Group
of Salclaim, a ride of 11/4 hr. to the S. from Mariette's House. We
pass near a space of ground about 440 yds square, enclosed by
broad and massive, but now very dilapidated walls Oil the E., N.,
and W. sides, while the S. side is bounded by the natural hills of
the desert.-The route now leads straight to theMaetaha el-Fir'auu,
the most interesting monument in the s. group. To the left are
the dilapidated Pyramids of Pepi ]. and Merem'? and a pyramid
called by the Arabs Harem egr-e'showwiV, On the N.W. side of the
Magtaha el-Fir'aun ts the Pyramid of Pepi II. All these pyramids
(now inaccessible ] are constructed and adorned exactly in the
same manner as that of King Ounos (p. 13d). The Mug'tubu el-
Firraun resembles in its shape same of the maetabas of the Middle
Empire. The passages in the interior resemble those in the pyr-
amids of Dunes and his successors, so that this monument may
probably enough be a king's gave, as its name implies (trave of
Pharaoh'). The top, which is easily reached, commands a fine view.

011 the S. and Fl. slopes of the plateau of 8alilrira are numerous
Rock Tombs. They are far simpler than the magtabas both in point
of construction and of internal decoration.

About 11/2 M. tn the S. of the llegtaba el-Fir'mm lie the Necropolis and
Pyramids of Duhshtu'. Here rise two large pyramids and a Smaller one of
limestone, and two of brick (the'Blaek Pyramids'), together with remains
of others, all of which Me at u considerable distance from each other.
The N. Brick Pyramid, which was once covered with slabs of stone, is
probably the tomb of King Usertesen m. (12th Dyn.). The length of
the side at the base is 345 ft., while the height is now only about 90 ft.
To the N, of this pyramid, bat within the girdle-wall that formerly
enclosed it, are two subterranean galleries with tomb-chambers in
which female members of the royal family were interred. In the lower
of these galleries Were found the jewels "the princesses 8it-Hauuu, and
Merit (now. in the Gizeh Museum, p. 82). - At the E. base of the pyramid
is a house belonging to the Service .195 Antiquilés, in which the night may
be spent by permission previously obtained at the Museum in Gizeh.

To the S.W, of the N. Brick Pyramid lies a larger Stone Pyramid.
This is still 326 ft. in height and 2311 yds. in width, being nearly as large
m the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, and in its solitude presents a very imposing
appearance, even to an accustomed eye. It was probably (like the Pyr-
amid of Meidtsm, p. 192) built by 8rwiet1, and is thus the most ancient
royal tomb in the form of a pyramid.

To the E. and S. are remains of several other pyramids. Still further
to the S. rises a pyramid of peculiar form, sometimes called the mater
Pyramid, the lower part rising at an angle of 54" at', while the sides of
the apex form an angle of 42° W. This pyramid is 2060 yds. square and
321 ft. in height. The exterior enatiug is in good preservation. The
interior was explored as early as the year 1600 by an English traveller
named Melton. In 1860 M. Le Brun found a small chamber in the interior.
No clue to the name of the builder has been discovered.

To the E. of the Blunted Pyramid and a few kilometres to the S. of
the li, Brick Pyramid, not Far frum the village of Messhtyeh, which lies
on the edge of the desert to the N. of Dtrhshr" rr, rises the S. Brick Pyramid.
This, which was originally covered with limestone slabs, was perhaps
built by King AmenemhétIII. (12th Dyn.). Tn the N. of it. bat enclosed
by the former girdle-wall, Me the graves of King Her and R'l'ncess Neb-
/tetepti-Pheot (p. 82). Between the N. and S. Brick Pyramids is the ruined
Pyramid of Ameuamhit ll. (12th Dyn.).
