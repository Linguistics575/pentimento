constructed in the solid masonry and lighted, like the staircases, by
means of small and rather deep window-openings (see p. 316). The
staircases in the two towers are connected with each other by a IPs-
sage running above the central portal; and in each tower there is a
door affording access to the roof of the colonnade in the court. On
the roof of the W. Colonnade are the workalen's drawings for the
concave cornice of the pylon. The *View from the top is unusually
attractive, commanding not only the most imposing survey of the
temple-buildings, but also ranging over the plain through which
the Nile flows, with its verdant crops and its villages fringed with
palms and mimosas, framed by the desert-mountains in the distance.

The half-buried Birth House, lying to the left of the entrance to
the great temple of Horus, is less worthy of a visit. It was built by
Ptolemy IX. Euergetes II., while the interior decorations date from
Soter II. It was surrounded by a gallery, with pillars bearing figures
of Bes (p. cxxvii).

In the interior is a room with one column. On the right wall: Hathor
of Dendera nurses Horus, white Keven other Hathnrs play musical instru-
ments' Behind the goddess is her youthful Emu Ehe-wrsr, with a sistrum.
On the left wall: Isis-Halhor in a marsh and Khnum with the youthful
Hows.

0n the E. bank, about 5M. aboveEdfu, is thevillege ufBedésiyeh
(Rodsieh), after which a Temple of Sethos J., lying 37 M. to the E.,
has been named; see p.347. - Farther along the E. bank (12 M. from
Edm), on the mountain-slopes approaching close to the river near
the hill es-Serég, are the picturesque remains of a late-Byzantine
fortified town (perhaps the ancient Thmuis ], with a church or con-
vent. In the neighbourhood are ancient quarries with inscriptions
(one of Thutmusis 111.). The nummulite limestone of the hills here
gives place to sandstone (comp. p. liii), which has furnished the
material for most of the gigantic buildings of Upper Egypt.

Near the village of el-Héeh { et-Hérrh), beside the Gebet Abu Shegctl
on the W. bank, a number of quarries may be observed from the
steamer. From masons' marks and Greek inscriptions in these we
learn that sandstone blocks were quarried here in the 11th year of
Antoninus (149 AD.) for a temple of Apollo (Le. Horus, perhaps at
Edfu.

g, the W. bank, 1/4 hr. above el-Hésh and about 1/shr. below
Silsileh, is a gorge known as Shatt er~Reghl ('Shore of the Men',
or Es-aab'a regN,'the seven men'), which was perhaps the starting
point for an ancient tyaravan-route through the desert. On the left
side of a cliff here, a few paces from the river-bank, is a most
