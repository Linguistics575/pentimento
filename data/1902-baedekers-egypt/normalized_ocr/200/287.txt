68 Route 5. TOMBS OF THE MAMELUKES Environs

continuation of the Muski (p. tr), renders it very easy of access.
A tiue effect, especially by eveniug-light, is produced by the domes
and. the peiruliu.eol011ring of the valley and the opposite heights
"the Molgattam. To the W. are the city, the plain "the Nile, and
the Pyramids; to the N. lies the straggling suburb of'Abtfisiyoh
(pl 77); and at our feet are the Tombs of the Khalifs (p. 64), the
most conspinuous of which are the tomb-mosque of Wit Bey (p. Mr,
to the left), with its dome and minaret, and the two domes and
two minarets of Sultan Barlitsl.L (p. 65).

The Tombs of the Mamelukes, to the S. "the Citadel, in-
eluding monuments of various periods, are most conveniently visited
via the Brill el-lrardfeh (Pl. E, 7), whence a good carriage-roadleads
through the midst of the tombs to the Hésh el-Bisha (see below).

slopes of the 11ol.urtt.arm The older tombs are in much poorer
preservation than the Tombs "the Khalifs, owing to their (j011-

by their miuarets. A few are of architectural and artistic interest;
but historical data as to the names of their builders are entirely
wanting, for the extent inscriptions upon them are almost exclu-
sively verses of the Karim.

To the S. the imposing dome of the tomb of Imam Shefe'i
(ya. 1240), "a bluish-grey eolour, is conspicuous. Beside it is an
extensive modern neempulis, rtl1isyfly "fami1y-tombs. The dome
itself and the Byzantine carvings and panelling on the lower part
of the interior walls are interesting.

Near it is the HOS): elvliésha, or family burial mosque, built
by Mohammed'Ali. The monuments (including those of Ibrthhn
and'Abbis L; p. o) are in white marble, and were executed by
Greek and Armenian sculptors. The inscriptions and ornamenta-
tion are richly gilded and painted,
