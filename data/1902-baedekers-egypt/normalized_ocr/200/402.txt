1876, is in great part a restoration of an earlier canal, dating from the
14th cent. BC. This ancient cane ], beginning at Bahastis, watered the
land of Goshen with its branches, and entering the Bitter Lakes, changed
their character, acenrding to Strahu, end cnnnected them with the Red
Sea. The channel of the old canal, which was re-discovered by the French
expedition of1798, is still traceable at places, and its direction has fre-
quently been followed by the engineers of M. de Lesseps. From the not
ir1eonsiderable remains of the old canal nem- Belh√©s, it appears to have
been about 50 yds. (100 clls, according to Strabu) in width, and 1643/: ft.
in depth. The somewhat steep banks are still strengthened at places
with solid masonry. Acuurding to Herodotus the canal was four days"
journey, ttnd according to Pliny 62 Roman miles, in length. In ancient
times the canal was primarily constructed for purposes of navigation,
and it is still used by numerous small barges; but it is now ehicily im-
portantas a channel for conducting fresh water to the towns on its banks,
particularly 1sma't1tya and Suez, and as a means of irrigating and fer-
tilising the cmmtry through which it passes. Near Cairo the canal diverges
from the Nile to the N. of the Key ea-ein, and thence tmcee to the NE.
the boundary between the Arabian plateau [ on the right) and the land
of Goshen (on the left). To the E. of Abu Hamulid it is joined by the
Balir el-3ftUa, a bvaneh-uuuuU coming from anazilg, and runs to the E.
through the Ifrddi .2'slmiltit, which is over 30 M. in length. At Nefiahah
(see below) the canal forks; the S, arm leads to Suez, while the N, arm
leads to Port 8arid.

The Goshen nf the Bible (Egyptian (iasem) is first mentioned in the
Book of Genesis, xW. 10, where Pharaoh says to Joseph: -'Amt thou
shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou,
and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks. and thy
herds' and all that thou hast'. Neatron is also made of Goshen in Genesis
xlvi. 28, 29; and xlvii. 5, 6, 27. Exodus x.1l mentions the cities in
Gnshen in which the Israelites were compelled to work at the tasks im-
posed on them by Pharaoh: -'Thercfore they did set over them tak
masters to Bftliet them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh
treasure-cities, Pithum and Raamses' (soc below). Gnaheu lay in the
Egyptian nome of Arabia, the capital of which was Per-Sopt (the Phakum
of the Greeks), irieatifierl with the ruins discovered by Neville near the
modern Saft el-Hsmzeh. Gnshen may therefore be located in the triangle
between Zalf2ztls, Belb" es, and Abu Hammad.

62 M. Tell el- Kebtr, an'ursignifiiraat place, noted as the scene
of'Arabi's defeat by the British troops in 1882. On leaving Tell
el-Kebir the train passes a cemetery laid out by the English, with a
tasteful monument to the British soldiers who fell in the struggle
with'Arabi, - 711/2 M. Jra.eoi.stn (husassint). - 76 M. Muftmmeh.

The neighbouring ruins of Tell 2141115ka probably mark the site oi
the Pithom (Egypt. Per-Atmn, m'house of the god Atum') of the Bible,
where the Jews served in hard bondage and built treasuge-eities (0r
storehouses) fur Pl1arauh (Exud. i, 11) The spot has been explored for
the Egypt Exploration Fund by 1Gvi1le, who discovered among the
temple-huildings several grain-stores, in the form of deep, rectangular
chambers without doors, into which the corn was poured from above
These perhaps date from the time of Ramses IL, anil may possibly be
the actual'storehouses' of the Bible.

82% M. Abu (lu1rtr. - 90 M. ch'isheh is the junction for the
line to Suez (p. 164). As we approach Isma'iliya the blue Lake
Timedl: (p. 170) presents a beautiful and striking contrast to the
desert just traversed, especially if some large sea-going steamer
happens to be passing, with its masts overtopping the low houses
of the town.
