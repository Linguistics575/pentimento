cliv ALEXAND RIAN ART.

Alexandria near the old Quarantine (t. e. in the region of the royal
palaces), and have been examined by the German geologists Frsas
and Schneider.

Not much more than the names have come down to us of a
number of large buildings of the Ptolemies, each of which do11btless
represented an architectural advance. Such were the Sam, or
Mausoleum of Alexander the Great, the harbour-worksfmpttutadion
and Diabathra) which united the city and the island of Pharos, and
the Alexandrian Temple of Pan, which rose in the form of a hill.
The last relics of the Telesterium, a temple built by Ptolemy If.
outside the E. gate of the city for the celebration of the Eleusinian
mysteries, were destroyed about the middle of the nineteenth cen-
tury, before scholars had found time to examine them carefully. All
that remains of the Greek 8erapeum, in the neeropulis of Sehk√©m,
now lies buried again in the sands of the desert, except the sculp-
tures brought to light in the first excavation, some of which are now
left to disintegrate in the open air (comp. pp. 135 et seq.). 8uifi-
cient attention has not yet been paid to the position in architectural
history of the technically unique Aqueduct of Alexandria, Which
was coastal with the foundation of the city, and stretched its sub-
terranean canals along all the principal streets, supplying the
cisterns which were found in every house and some of which are
still in existence. Of the palaces and villas of the Ptolemies, of
the celebrated lighthouse on the island of Pharos, of the Gymnasium
situated on the Dromos or chief street, and of a few other buildings
we learn from ancient authors enough at least to justify us in sur-
raising that they served as models to the Roman architects for sim-
ilar edifiees. The building of Alexandria was the flrst example on
a grand scale of the systematic laying out of a city on a homo-
geneous plan, with its regular network of streets cutting each other
at right angles and bordered with colonnades, its long vistas, and
its symmetrically disposed public buildings; and it was imitated in
innumerable subsequent foundations. The latest 0fthese was Antimon-
polis (p. 201), founded by Hadrian on the Nile, the lingering rem-
nants of Which were not finally destroyed until last century. The
Rue de la Porte de Rosette in modern Alexandria marks the line of
the ancient main street, which united the E. and W. gates of the
fortifications; and numerous remains of the double colonnade with
which it once was bordered are seen in the fragments of columns in
the neighbouring houses and gardens.

These comprehensive architectural undertakings were naturally
accompanied by a corresponding activity in the domain of Sculpture.
In the time of Alexander the Great, under the Ptolemies, and
afterwards under the Roman emperors, this art was especially erm.
played, as it had been under the ancient Pharaohs, in producing
statues and busts of the royal family. (For portraits of Alexander,
see Nos. 29 and 35 in Case c, in Room 1 in the Museum.) Besides
