Quarters. 1.i61tilJ. 4. Monte. ot

From the E. outer court we enter the chief Lhtin (see below:
or sanctuary, and thence proceed to the inner quadrangle or Sat"
el-Gami'a, 99 yds. square. With the exception of the ceilings, whicl
had to be restored in order to protect the interior, the building has
been preserved almost intact, though its fitting up has been frequentl:
altered. The most important renovations were carried out by Lagin
afterwards Sultan Mar1i.st1r. It was he who erected the mausoleum-
like Dome (PL 6) in the centre of the court, covering an octagona
basin on the site of an old Well. The court is surrounded by a doubh
arcade, except on the sanctuary side, where the arcade is quadruple
while a fifth row of arches collapsed in 1875. Pointed Opening:
above the pillars serve to lighten the weight of the masonry, ani
the faqades are crowned by e medallion-frieze with open -wor1
pinmuslas. The pillars are polished and have their corners roundei
into q11arter-eo1umus, with delicately carved capitals. By one 0'
the pillars of the sanctuary is a marble tablet bearing the chaite ]
0f the mosque in ancient Arabic (Cutie) characters. The origins
roof of the arcades, of which remains are extant above the dikkelr
was made of beams of date-palm, overlaid with sycamore wood
Along the top of the walls runs a frieze of sycamore wood, inscribet
with texts from the Koran. According to the testimony of Mahriz
this wood belonged to Noah's Ark, Which was found by Ibn Tuliir
on Mt. Ararat.

The PrayerRecess (_P1. 5) has tine Byzantine capitals and remain:
of gilded mosaic. The wooden cupola in front of it has lately heel
restored. The Pulpit erected by Melik ssl-Han.) in 1298 stil
deserves close attention, though it has been robbed of its charac-
teristio panels carved in ebony and ivory. These were sold in Europe,
and most of them are now in South Kensington Museum.

The Mimrret Cm. T), in the N.W. outer court, is built of stone
instead of brick, and also shows peculiarities in its square lowel
section and elsewhere. The ascent is easy, and the top commands
an admirable *View. To the S. are the pyramids of DahshU, and
to the W. the huge pyramids of Gizeh; the valley of the Nile as fa!
as the Delta lies before us; to the E. rise the picturesque slopes oi
the Mohattam and the Citadel; and in the foreground all round lies
Cairo, with its houses, mosques, palaces, and gardens. From the
minaret access is gained to the concrete roofs of the arcades, pro-
tected by elegant balustrades; a walk round these is recommended.

Outside the entrance to the mosque we tum to the right, end
after about 140 paces, to the right again. Passing the S.W. side ol
the mosque, and turning a little to the left, we traverse several
lanes and alleys, all in the old quarter of Kel'et el-Kebsh (p. 54),
and reach the small, but once handsome -

Ghmi'a 1rkit Bey (Pl. C, 7), which was erected in the rich By-
zantine-Arabian style during the reign of Kd'it Bey [ 1468-96,
p. xcvii), whose tomb o. M) it resembles in plan, Its threatened
