LAKE MENZALEII. fd. Route. 169

300 yds. to the N. of it, on the pier, is a colossal statue of Ferdinand
de Lesseps (p. IG), by the French sculptor E. Frémiet, unveiled
on Nov. 17th, 1899, thirty years after the opening of the Suez Canal,
his great achievement.

The Inner Harbour, or Bassin Ismal'l, is adjoined by three
sheltered basins in which vessels discharge and lead; viz. the Corn-
mercial harbour and the arsenal harbour (on each side of the hand-
some buildings of the Canal Co.), and the'Bassin Cherif'. The last
is flanked with buildings erected by Prince Henry of the Nether-
lands as a depot for the Dutch trade; on his death (1879) they were
purchased by the British government and are now used as a military
deprit and barracks CPI. 9).

The Arab Quarter and the Cemyery lie to the W. (tramway,
p. 168). The tombs are constructed in the form of vaults of masonry
above ground, as the soil is saturated with salt uater at a depth of
2 ft. below the surface.

Ferry-boats (fare 10 pins.) across Lake Menzuleh to Dumfetta (p,160)
start trom the 3rd kilometre oil the Suez Canal, which may be reached
nn donkey-back or by vowing-boat.

The numerous masts in the harbour ofPort Sa'id remain in sight
long after we quit that town. The Canal, on the W. bank of which
runs the steam-tramway to Isma'iliya (p. 164), is constructed in a
perfectly straight line through Lake Menzaleh. The brackish waters
of this lake extend over an area of about 1000sl M., covering what
was once one of the must fertile districts in Egypt, and was inter-
sected by the three most important arms of the Nile (p. li) in an-
cient times, the Pelusiae, the Iauitio, and the Mendesian. Among
the numerous towns and villages situated here were the important
cities of Tanis and Tennis. Immense t1oelrs of pelicans and silver
heroas, some tlruniagoes, and a few herds of' buffaloes are to be met
with here. The operation of draining the lake has been begun, the
part adjoining the Canal on the E. is already dry. - Ihie el-'Esh
(16th kilometre) is the first station.

Lake Menzaleh ends at (27W, M.) 1il1-Faat.ara ('the bridge'), an
isthmus separating it from Lake Balah. Over this isthmus led the
ancient caravan route from Egypt to Syria. The steam-tr-ay to
Port 8a'id o. 164) has a station here, near which are several restau-
rants. The village, with its mosque, lies on the Asiatic bank of the
canah The hill to the left commands a tolerable survey of the

environs.

About 11/2 hr. from liantax-a, a little to the S. of the old caravan road'
lies the hill of Tell Abu Séfah, with the ruins of a. temple of Ramses 11.
and remains of the Ptolemeic and Roman periods. - A moderate day's
Journey (on camels) t'rom Kantarzt are situated the ruin-atrewn Tell Fardma
and Tell el-Faqlqla, occupying the site "Pelusium. the celebrated eastern
seaport and key to Egypt, which now contains no objects of interest. -
