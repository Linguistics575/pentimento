with oalyx-osrpitals.

Of the various Lotus Columns, which seem to have been freely
used if we may judge from the numerous pietuxes "them, Com-
paratively few have been preserved. Clustered columns of this kind
with bud-capitals occur under
the encient and Middle Em-
pires (in a tomb at Bsrnilu-
San), but appear to have died
out under the New Empire.
The above-rnentioaed column

'atBenWasan is formed of four
straight stems, rising trom a
base resembling a mound of
earth and fastened together
at the top by bands (Fig. IV).
The capital is formed of closed
huds, the green sepals ofwhieh
extend quite to the top of the
white petals of the corolla.
Near the top of the shaft
smaller stems are' inserted
between the main stems.
Examples of clustexed co ] -
umns of the Nymphasa lotus
with open (calyx) capitals
(Fig. 111) are freqently repre-
sented in tombs oftheArusient
and Mitb1leErnpires, but they
occurmost frequentIyistbuiH-
ings of the later period.

The Papyrus Columns are much more numerous. They differ
widely from the lotus-eolumus. The stems in the latter are, circular
in section, while in the papyrus-Frans they are triangular, and
moreover taper rapidly at the base, where they are encircled with a
wreath of pointed leaves - characteristics that are wanting in the
lotus-columns. There is a diffexenee also in the capitals; for the
sepals of the pspyrus-f1owsr are much shorter than those of the lotus
and do not reach to the tips ofthe petals (see above). The simple pap-
yrus-column with a 1ntd-oapital is seen only in paintings and reliefs;
whereas the clustered column is common enough (Fig. Va). The
latter usually consists of eight stems held together by bands at the
top, while between these stems smaller clusters of three, fastened
together by six bands, were inserted. These inserted stems, however,
lost their independent treatment at an early perioiL-Towirsds the.
