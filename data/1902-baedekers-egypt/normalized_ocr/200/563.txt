5. From Bibin ty1-hr111iur to Dér el-behri and El-Asesif.

To return frum Btbirn el-hi1110k to the plain we should take the moun-
tain-peth viii DB1" el-huhri. It is possible to ride to the top of the hill,
but better to go On foot all the way. Riding down the hill is by no
means to he recommended. The donkey-boys usually lead the animals by
a narrow path over the ridge, and await the traVellers at the foot. The
afternnon is the best time to visit the temple of BET el-haliri, for during
the hotter hours of the day the oppressive rays of the suu are reileeie1
from the rocks here with peculiar intensity.

The path begins at Tomb 16, ascends the hill separating Bibén
el-yruWr from Dilr'sl-balm' and Iil1-Asasif, and descends in zigzags.
It is fatiguing but safe, and is easily accomplished in'3/, hr. The
* View is most remarkable: first into the desolate valley of the Tombs
of the Kings, then from the summit and as we descend into thepeculiar
ravine of Dh. el-balyri; we see the steep projecting mountain-side
with its tombs, and buildings old and new, with the rich green of
the fertile plain below spread out on both sides of the Nile, and
here and there its groups of palms and gigantic temples, as far as
Kernel; end Luxor 0n the E. bank. The situation of the temple of
Dir el-bahri is remarkably fine; on the W. and N. it is framed by
precipitous rocks of a light-brown and golden colour, against which
the dazzling white walls of the temple stand out in magnificent LB-
lief. - Below the temple lies the house of the Egypt Exploration
Fund, where the keeper of the ruins lives. Opposite is the Chalet
Hatam, a 1une, heou-r0om open only to cook's patrons.

The *Temple of Dér el-bahri, named by the Egyptians'Zoeer-
soeru', or Wost splendid of att', was built and adorned with reliefs
and inscriptions, at the beginning of the New Empire7 by Queen
Makere Hatshepsowet, the sister, wife, and co-regent of That-
mosis m. The construction of the temple shared the chequered for-
tunes of its foundress (p. lxxxii). When Makeré was expelled from
the throne by her brother and husband after a briefreign, the build-
ing operations came to a halt, and Thutmosis caused the names and
f1gure of his sister to be obliterated in all the finished sculptures
and inscriptions at Dér M-balm' as well as elsewhere throughout the
country. Thutmosis IL, who succeeded his brother, continued the
work of destruction by inserting his own name in place of that of
Makere, When Thutmosis II. died, however, Makere once more regain-
ed the throne, and the building was resumed. Operations were not
carried on with any remarkable activity, for when the queen's long
reign came to an end, the temple was still unfinished. Thut-
mosis 11L, once more on the throne. so far from supplying what
was still wanting, resumed his former tactics, destroying all allusions
to his sister and sometimes inserting his own name and figure in
place of hers.

The splendid temple was thus never finished. Amenophis IV.
carefully destroyed all reference to Amman, and the inscriptions
