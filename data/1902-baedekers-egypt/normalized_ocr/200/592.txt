Merlinet Habit. THEBES (w. Ill xx). 24. Route. 299

The inner side of the central edifice, through which we pass
by the Gatr'way 12, bears reliefs showing the king in various posi-
tions as the conqueror of his enemies.

We now enter the Outer Court, 85 yds. long, between the pavilion
and the main temple. In the middle stands a small Gateway (P1. B),
erected by Nektanehos. To the right lies the Temple of the 18th
Dyn. (see p. 303). To the left is a small TEMPLE "Ayrrssuurrai's,
the mother-in-law of' Psammetikh I. (comp. p. Ixxxv ].

Through a large Portal we enter a Forevt'am't and thence pass to
the vaulted Sanctuary, which was completely surrounded by a enrridnr.
0n the Left Wing of the portal we see Amenertais saerifieing tn Amman
(above), and standing holding two eistre before Ammon and Met (below).
On the Right Wing Amenertars sacvih'ee8 to Amman (above), and to Am.
man and a goddess (below). The temple is adjnined on the right by three
chapels, dedicated to Shepenwepct, Nitoeris (daughter and granddaughter
ofAmenertaiO, and Meht-Wesekhet (wife of Psammetikh IO.

The "Main Temple of Ramses m. was built on exactly the
same plan as the Ramesseum and was dedicated like it to Amman.

The large First Pylon is covered with representations and in-
scriptions. 0n the Right Tower On. C), to the right, the king is
shown hefore Ammon-Re-mms/is, grasping a band of enemies
hy the hair and smiting them with his club. The hawk-headed god
hands him the curved sword and leads to him by a cord the captured
lands, which are represented in the accustomed manner (p. 251)
by circular walls enclosing their names and surmounted by bound
enemies. Beneath are two other rows of representations of con-
quered lands. Farther to the left, between the grooves for the flag-
stairs, is a similar bat much smaller scene, representing the king
smiting two foes in presence of Ammon; and heneath is a long in-
scription, descrihing in poetic but exceedingly exaggerated language
the victory won hy Ramses III. over the Lihyans in the 11th year
of' his reign. At the foot Amman is seated to the left, with Ptah
standing behind, inserihing the king's name on a palm-leaf'. The
king kneels before Ammon, under the sacred tree, and Teneives
from the god the hieroglyphs for'juhilee of the reign', suspended
on a palm-hranch, as a symbol of long life. Thout writes the king's
name on the leaves of the tree, and beside him stands the goddess
Sefkhet-ebui. To the right of the portal, below, is a stale of the
12th year of' the king (imitated from a stale of the 35th year of
Ramses II. at Abu-Simbel, p. 372), containing a dialogue between
Ptah end the king. The Left Tower (P1. D) repeats these scenes
and inscriptions.

Through the Central Portal (P1. d), embellished within and
without by representations of' the king worshipping the gods, we
enter the First Court, forming an approximate square of115 ft.
The inner side of the first pylon is adorned with scenes from the
Libyan campaign of Ramses (see above). To the S. (P1. e) is a
battle, in which the Egyptians are aided by mercenaries from among
the Shardana (p. 298), who are distinguished by their round helmets
