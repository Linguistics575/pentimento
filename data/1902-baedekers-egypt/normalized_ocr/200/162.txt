in the representations of the crowds of warriors in these battle
reliefs, while the actual combats are frequently mere confused
assemblages of standing and recumbent ilgures of men and animals,
bat all the same we cannot withhold admiration from the keen face
ulty of observation displayed by the artists. And perhaps a good
deel of the apparent confusion would disappear if we could see the
reliefs with all their original colouring. _-In the SA'iTE PmuoD the
works of the Ancient Empire were again selected as models for sinllp-
tures in this branch of the plastic art, though no attempt was made
to rival the ancient masters with actual copies. But all the same
the reliefs of this period offer apleasing contrast to the rude prodmr-

The goldsmiths and workers in metal in particular had attained the
most eumplete mastery of their craft; they thoroughly understood
all its ancillary arts, such as euemelliug and Damasoene work, and
they were thus able to produce works of a degree of finish such as
a highly civilised nation alone could execute and appreciate.

The traveller should note the signifuurtion of some of the SYM-

columns and other parts of the Egyptian temples. Thus, is the
