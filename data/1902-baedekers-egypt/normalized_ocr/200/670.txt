KOROSKO. .22. Route. 365

76 M. 8hdturmeli, a considerable village, situated among palms
on the 8. bank. The Nile now bends to the 8., and the mountains
approach close to the E. bank, their steep slopes lending a peculiar
charm to the scenery.

811/2 M. 8enktri- Dakuan7yeli (E. bank) and MÃ©lki (W bank).

87 M. Korosko (E. bank), with a post and telegraph office, is
the chief place in the district of the same name, embracing the
Nile valley from Sheturmeh t0 Fares o. 376). On the bank rises
a handsome mosque. The village is situated in a plain, hounded
by a semicircle of mountains, and it is the starting-point of the great
caravan-l'oute to Abu llammed (p. 382-, 8-10 long days' journey).
This road strikes direct aeross the desert, the chief resort of the
Atrtbdeh and Bishirin Beduins, avoiding the three upper cataracts7
and cutting off the windings of the Nile. During the Mahdist insur-
rreetion Korosko was of considerable strategical importance and was
held by a strong garrison; now, however, the forts and barracks are
deserted. - The traveller may ascend [ V2 hr.; steep and stony)
the hill of Awus el-thurrdni, close to Korosko. On the summit is
the tomb of the saint to whom the hill owes its name, a frequented
pilgrim-resort. The view extends over the Nile valley as far as Derr.

is the most fertile portion of Nubia. The belt of cultivable land
along the river is comparatively broad; and it is irrigated by means
of water-weels Csklriyeh) of curious construction. - A little beyond
Korosko the Nile valley trends to the N.W., so that the N. wind
which prevails in winter frequently retards the sailing-boats. 0n
the left bank rises a picturesque chain of hills. 0n the E. hank
lies R & a; on the W. bank is (3 M.) Abu Handul.

At a little distance from the W. bank, deeply sunk in the yellow
desert sand, lies (91/2 M.) the -

Temple of "Amide, which dates from the 18th Dyu. and was de-
dicated to Re-Harmachis. Its erection and decoration were begun
under Thutmosis 111. end Amenophis IL, and completed under
Thutmosis IV. The figures of Ammon, which were defaced by
Amenophis IV., wele restored by Sethos L In Christian times the
temple was used as a church and the reliefs were covered with white-
wash, which has had the effect ofpreserving the original colouring,
as we see now that the whitewash hes peeled Mr.
