HISTORY. The district round the modern Asenim, including the island
of Elephantine, bore in antiquity the name of l'ébu, 0r'Elephant Land',
probably because the Egyptians here frrsit saw the African elephant. At
a later date that name was restricted to the island and town of Elephant
iae. From antiquity down to the present day Elephamine has marked
the limit of Egypt proper in the direction of Nubia. From the erection
of the Pyramids to the Roman period the ancient Egyptians found material
for their great temples and statues in the quarries ot YEtra (Syene), which
yielded tlne eulourud granite, containing a large proportion of translucent
quartz and of yellow, brownish, pink, tmd black miea. Curiously enough,
however, the term'8yenite', which Was used by Pliny, is now applied
by geulogists to a different variety of stone, containing a much larger pro-
portion ot" horab1enrle. Strategically. Yebn commanded the Nile cataracts
and the channels that fostered eommunicatim by water between Egypt
and Nubia. It was also the starting-point ot" the great caravan-routes
leading to Nubia and the Sudin, along which passed the earliest com-
mercial and military expeditions of the Egyptians, and it thus became
an important depOt for the trade with the interior of Africa The ancient
capital of the province was also named YEbu and lay on the St side of the
island (p. 331).

Another town, named Swinet, the Hyena of the Greekst, was situated on
the E. bank of the Nile, but appears not to have attained any great im-
portance until a late periud. Large mounds of rubbish near the railway-
station still indicate the former size of this town. Juverml, the Latin satiric
poet, was appointed prefect of the garrison at Syene, or, in other words,
was banished to the most remote lreutier of the empire, as apunishmeut
for his biting attacks on the court. A famum curiosity of ancient Syene
was a well, into which the sun's rays descended perpendicularly, casting
no ehacluw1 at midday during the summer-solstiee, thus proving that
Syene was situated under the tropic (which, however, has now shifted
sumewhat to the so. The report "its existence led the learned Athenian
Erutosthenes (216u9d Btu), attached to the Museum at Alexandria, to the
discovery of the method of measuring the size of the earth that us still
employed The place enLt'ered greatly at the hands of the Blemmyes (p. 352),
but became the seat of a Christian bishop, and appears to have rapidly re-
gained its prosperity under the Khalifs. Arab anlhurs record that nu fewer
than 20,000 inhabitants died of the plague at one time, a fact that points
to a very large total population. After the close of the 12th cent. Assufm
suffered severely from the incursions of plundering Arab tribes, J'mally
put a stop to by a Turkish garrison stationed here by the sultan Selim,
after the conquest of Egypt in 1517.

The broad and clean street skirting the liver presents an almost
European appearance, with its whitewashed houses. To the N, of
the landing-place'a rained building, for which stones of earlier
buildings have been used, projects into the river. This, known to
the Arabs es Idl-yarnrnc" ttn (the bath), probably dates from the
Roman period and seems to have been a lock or a téte-de-pont.
Near it rises the Assuen Hotel; farther down are the government-
buildings, the Cafe hl1édiv'1al, Chsok's bureau, and the Post Omer,
and upstream are the Commissariet Store, the Cataract Hotel, and
the palm-shaded railway-station (p. 327). Farther to the S. are
the ruins of a building (probably a convent) on a hill and Fort
Tagug. On the island of Elephantine the Savoy Hotel is conspi-
ruous. Across the river appears the hill with the roek-tombs and the
Kubbet el-hztwa (p. 334) on the highest point. The Nile, with its
