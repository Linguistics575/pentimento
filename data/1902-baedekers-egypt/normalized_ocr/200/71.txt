grown in Egypt from a very early period. A bushy tree, which in
its halt'-leal1ess condition attracts the attention of every traveller ou
landing at Alexandria in winter, is the Poinsettia puleherrima. The
insignificant blossom is surrounded by leaves of the most brilliant
red, presenting- a very picturesque and striking appearance. Natural
forests, or even solitary wild trees, are never met with in the valley
ot' the Nile or in the valleys of the northern deserts.

e. The Climate of Egypt.
By Leigh Cannes ], ALD. (Loni), ER. Met. Soc.

The blue clnuxlless sky, the powerful sunlight, and the dry
warm air are among the first facts that strike the traveller on his
arrival in Egypt; and his surprise increases when he observes that
the conditions remain uniform day after day7 and are, in short, so
entirely the rule that'the weather' ceases to be a topic of conver-
sation. If from the top ot' the hills "cliii's bordering the Nile valley
to the S. of Cairo he looks out on the boundless deserts on either
side, the visitor will realize at once that Egypt is praeticalry a part
of the Sahara, a verdant strip of fertile soil, 8A2 M. wide, depend-
ent for its existence upon the Nile; and that the refreshing purity
of the atmosphere is essentially due to the proximity of the desert.

The atmosphere of the Libyan Desert, to the W. of the Nile
valley, is so dry in Winter, that dew is rarely seen even when the
thermometer falls to freeziug-point; and a shower condensed in
the upper air is often dissipated before it can reach the earth. The
daily range of temperature recorded here by Rohlfs was 3Y', which
is more than is usual in Egypt; the minimum untcd was (PAP
below freezing-point and the maximum 122Â°. During the warm
season (from about May to October) the hot desert air ascends and
a current of cold air streamsiu from the Mediterranean. Thus arises
a North Wind, the famous'Etesian Wind' of Herodotus, which
greatly tempers the heat of summer throughout Egypt, and which
is more and more duprived of moisture as it proceeds farther and
farther to the b. During the remaining mouths West Winds prevail,
which, rising in the N. and neutral portions of the Libyan Desert, reach
Lower Egypt from the S.W. and Upper Egypt from the N.W. In
winter the W. wind is often pieruiugly cold at Cairo and Alexandria
and cool in Upper Egypt, owing to the fact that the Libyan Desert
and Sahara are colder than Cairo by 3" "4", while Cairo is colder
in winter than Alexandria by Y. In spriug, during the fit'ty days
before the summer-solstice, a strong, hot, dry, and sand-ladeu wind
from the S.W. blows at irregular intervals for a day or two at a time,
and is known as the Khamsfn (from Arab. lchzmastn, fifty). The sun
is then often obseured, the temperature may be raised to 100-i0 (P,
and the relative humidity reduced to 10 per cent or less in Cairo and
