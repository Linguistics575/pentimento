enclosed sanctuary, within the large temple. We see here first a
small storeroom, connected by a Corridor (Pl. i) with the W. stair-
case (p. 230). Thence we enter an open Court, beyond Which is a.
charming Kiosaue, supported by two 11athor- columns and approached
by seven steps. Here the preliminary celebration for the chief i11nB-
tion at Dendera, the great new year's festival, was conducted with
great splendour by the priests of Hathor. The walls of the kiosque
are embellished with three rows of representations, showing the king
and various deities in presence of the gods of Dendera. Just above
the floor is a procession of local deities CI., those of Lower Egypt,
1., those of Upper Egypt) bearing gifts. On the ceiling the sky
goddess Newt is depicted with the sun rising from her lap and
shining upon a head of Hathor that typifies the temple of Dendera.

We now return to the second auteehamber in order to visit
thence the innermost part of the temple,'thc hidden secret cham-
bers', as they are called in the inscription's.

The central door leads to the profoundly dark Sanctuary, in
Which the sacred boats with the images of the gods formerly stood.
The king alone, or his saoerdota1 representative, might enter this
sacred precinct and in solitude commune with the deity. Only
once a year was this permitted even to him, at the great festival of
the New Year. The reliefs on the walls depict the rites which the
king had to perform on entering the sanctuary, and the saerifttres
which he had to offer.

There are three rows of BELIEFS, but only the lowest can be distiuetl
seen even with the Md of a candle or a magnesium lamp. The relie s
hrs so arranged that each scene on the Left Wall (Pl. k), beginning at
the entrance. is followed in historical sequence by the corresponding scene
on the Right Wall (P1. I), 1 (left) The king ascend! the steps to the shrine
of the gods; 2 (right) removes the band tastening the door; 3 (1.) hreeks
the seals on the door; 4 (L) opens the door; 6 [ 1.) gazes upon the god-
dess; 6 (L) preys to her with his arms hanging down; q [ 1.) offers incense
before the sacred boats of H & thor and Horns or Edfn; and (N, m) before
the boats of Hathor end Hsr-sern-tewiG. - Item' Wull (PLm). To the left,
the king, before whom is the youthful son of Hathor with sistrnm and
rattle, presents an image of the goddess Meat to Humor and Horns; to
the left, the same ceremony before Hethor and Hervsem-tewe,

The Sanctuary is surrounded by a Corridor, lighted by aper-
tures in the side-walls and in the ceiling, and entered from the
second enteehamher by means of two side-doors. Opening off this
corridor are 11 Small Chambers (P1. i-xi), which were used as store-
rooms and for various rites. Room I, which is embellished with
reliefs like those in the Sanctuary, contained a shrine with an image
of Hathor.

Before ascending to the roof of the temple, we should visit the
subterranean chambers, or Crypts, which claim attention not only
for their remarkable construction but also for the fresh tints of their
paintings. The temple contains no fewer than 12 Crypts (or14
if we reckon separately the parts of these that are divided), cou-
strueted in the thickness of the temple-wells in different stories,
