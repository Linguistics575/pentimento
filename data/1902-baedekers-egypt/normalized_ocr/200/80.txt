DOGTRINES OF BIsrsLUi. Ixix

is for the most part rigorously observed, but prolonged repasts dur-
ing the night afford some compensation. Many shops and oflires are
entirely closed during this month. As the Arabic year is lunar, and
therefore eleven days shorter than ours, the fast of Ramaglin runs
through all the seasons in the course of thirty-three years, and its
observance is most severely felt in summer, when much suffering is
caused by thirst.

The PILGRIMAGB TO MECCA, Which every Muslim is bound to
undertake once in his life, is also deserving of mention. Most of
the pilgrims now perform the greater part of the distance by water.
On approaching Mecca the pilgrims undress, laying aside even
their headgear, and put on aprons and a piece of cloth over the
left shoulder. They then perform the circuit of the Ks'ba, kiss
the black stone, hear the sermon on Mt. "Arafat near Mecca, pelt
Satauwith stones in the valley of Mina, and conclude their pil-
grimage with a great saeruieial feast. On the day when this takes
place at Ireeea, sheep are slaughtered and a festival called the Great
Beiram (el-nd el-kebir) observed throughout the whole of the Moham-
medan countries. (The'Lesser Beiram', Arab. el-'td e: s-yughaiyar,
follows Ramadan.) The month of the pilgrimage is called Dhil-
higgeh (that'ofthe pilgrimage'), and forms the close of the Muslim
years? The conduct of the caravan, with the gifts presented to the
town of Mecca, the escort, and other items, costs the Egyptian govern-
ment more than 50,000t. annually. For an account of the feast in
connection with the pilgrimage, see p.1xxvii.

Most of the Arabic LITERATURE is connected with the Koran.
Commentaries were written at an early period to explain the ob-
scure passages in it, and there gradually sprang up a series of PN-
egetical writings dwelling with elaborate minuteuess 11P00 every
possible shade of interpretation. Crrsrnmar, too, Was at first studied
solely in connection with the Koran, and a prodigious mass of
legal literature was founded exclusively upon the sacred volume
(p. lxv). Of late years, however, some attempts have been made

, Mmummnmn CALENDAR. The Mohammedan era begins with July 16th
(lat Mnharreml 0f the year 622 A. D., being the day of hrolyunrned's flight
(Hegira) from Mecca to Medina (p.1xii). The Mohammedan year is purely
lunar and has no reference or relation to the sun; it contains 354 days,
Dr 355 in leap-years, eleven of which occur in each cycle of 30 years.
There are12 months, the first7 third, etc., ofwhich have 29 days each, the
second, fourth, etc., 30 days; these are named Molrtsrrem,'iatur, Rubi' el-
auwel, Rtwbtrel-tuhir, Gemcld el-auwel, Gemdd el-dkm'r, Regreb, Shm'bdw, Rama-

In order approximately to cunvcrt a year of Our era into one of the
Muslim era, subtract 622, divide the remainder by 33, and add the quotient
to the dividend. Conversely, a year of the Mohammedan era. is converted
into nne of the Christian era. by dividing it by 33. subtracting the quotient
from it, and adding 622 to the remainder. On 20th April, 1901, began the
Muslim year 1319.

The Gregorian calendar Was introduced into Egypt in 1875, but is
observed by government in the f'manoe department only.
