To the right and left lie two oblong chambers. At the back are
three chapels, the central and largest of which is the SANCTUARY
(P1. D). On the walls of this chamber are reliefs. 0n the left wall
Ramses presents flowers to the boat of Ptah; on the right wall, the
king before the boat of Harmachis. In the centre of the Sanctuary
is a pedestal, wrought out of the rock, for the sacred boat. At the

Above Girsheh the scenery relapses into monotony. - 29 M.
Kushtamneh, a commune on both banks. On the E. bank rises the
Gebel Hayati. 0n the W. bank is a Uiok-built fortress of the Middle
Empire, known to the natives as Kuri. Extensive sand-hanks and
granite rocks interrupt the course of the river.

Dakkeh is the ancient Egyptian Per-Selkeft),'House of Selket', the
Greek Pselchis, near which the Roman general Petronius defeated
the Ethiopians in 23 A.D., on his campaign to Napeta. We proceed
to the S., through the miserable mud-huts of the village, and in a
few minutes reach the -

Temple of Dakkeh, which has been much damaged within the
last few years. The present temple (comp. the Plan, p. 362) (MMIII-
pies the site of an earlier shrine, probably of the New Empire, and
was dedicated to Thout of Pnubs, an Ethiopian town. By the
Greeks this god was called I? sotn11phis. The most ancient part of
the building dates from the time of the Ethiopian king Ergamenes
(Pl. D) and his contemporary Phi1opstor (P1. 0). Euergetes II,
added a vestibule (P1. B), and the temple received its tlnal form
under the Roman emperors by the addition of the Sanctuary (PLE)

about 6 ft. in height, now completely exposed by the natives in the
course of their excavations for sebbikh (p. IV).

A broad path, still flanked on either side by a single course of
blocks of masonry, leads to the well-preserved PYLON (Pl. A), which
stood in the outer girdle-wall and formed the entrance to the temple-
precinets. Each Pylon-towes has a groove for a flagstafr; and both
have afew isolated reliefs on the outside and numerous inscriptions,
chiefly Greek, though some, added by visitors to the temple, are
Demotie and Meroi'tic. Within the central gateway, on the left side,
is the king making offerings to Thout, Tefnut, and Hathor, while

Isis appears below.

The ASCENT or me PYLON is attractive. In each tower there is a
staircase, beginning in a guard-room at the foot and passing three other
rooms in the successive stories. 011 the platform at the top of the W.
