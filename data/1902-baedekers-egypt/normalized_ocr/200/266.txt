Persian name of bidgir, by means of which the cool north-wind is

introduced into the houses.

The Gemi'a llm J_ { nleim (Pl. F, 6), situated to the N.E. of the Mosque
of Mohammed'Ali, was erected in 1317 by Sultan en -Ntuiir. Long used
as a military magazine and storehouse, it has recently been cleared out,
and is willingly shown by the British military authorities. It exhibits
traces of the Romanesque taste oh the exterior, particularly on the portals.
In the interior are some marble columns with ancient capitals.

Immediately to the SE. of the Mosque of Ibn Kariitn is the so-mllezl
Well of Joseph (B" wrostsf; Pl, F, 6), a square shaft, sufik in the limestone rock
to a depth of 290 ft. Within the shaft, at a depth of about 155 ft., is a
platform on which the oxen stood that brought the water to the surface
hy means of a sélgiyeh. The well formerly provided the citadel with water,
bat has lost its importance since the completion of the new water-works
(p. 63). When the citadel was constructed here in the 12th cent, the
builders discovered an ancient shaft ii11ei1 with semi, which Saldheddin
Fttsuf (p. 32) caused to he re-opened and named after himself fc1stfrns, or
Joseph's, Well. This circumstance gave rise to the tradition, which was
"t1ieily cntreut among the Jews, that this was the well into which the
Joseph of Scripture was put by his brethren.

The Gimi'a Eulémén Plshl (Pl. F, 6), also called Briryat, on the NE.
side of the citadel, was erected in 1526 by 8n1ilrniin, the 31arneluke, after-
wards Sultan Selim. The architecture is a mixture of Arabian and Turkish.
The mosque is small, but i3tmW11l1y executed. It contains Cutie inscriptions,
marble mosaics, it decorated prayer-recess, a pulpit in marble, end'uy-
teresting dour-mouuts.

To the tombs of the Khalifs and Mamelukes, see p.61.

From the BO 21-68621 ('moantaia-gste'J, to the E. of the citadel, a road
leads straight to the Mukattam (p. 108). A road diverging to the right a
little farther on leads to e Dervish Monastery (visitors admitted), situated
on a mountain-slope. (The monastery may also be reached from the Place
Méhemet Ali vii the narrow lanes between the Tombs of the Mamelukes
and the citadel.) An easy staircase ascends to an attractive court, in
which are situated the residences of the monks. Coffee is frequently
offered to travellers, all recompense being declined. From the court a
dark cave (probably an old quarry) enters the mountain-side, with the
graves of deceased dervishes. At the end is a chamber containing the tomb
of the founder of the order of dervishes, where worshippers are frequently
observed. The remains of a female relative of the Khedive also rest here
under an elaborate gilt tomb.

We return to the Place Ruméleh (p. 51) and follow the Shiri'a
Muhammed'Ali to its intersection with the 8Mri'a el-Hilmi'yeh
(Pl. D, 5, 6; the doakey-drivers know short-cuts hither from the
citadel). We follow the latter street and its continuation es-8iyii-
ftyeV Three minarets soon come into sight, the two most distant
belonging to the dei'a 8hekMn (P1.D,6). At the corner opposite
the mosque is the Sebil of the Mother of'Abbtis I. (Pl. D, 6), in
marble, rich and effective in general appearance, but lacking finish
in its details. The street now takes the name of 8Mri'a er-Rukbtyeh
on. D, 6, T). We follow it for about 300 yds., and turn down the
Sharia Ibn Tumn to the right, in which, after about 70 yds. more,
we observe on the right a lane leading to the E. entrance of the -

*aArssirts Ibu Tu1tin (P1. D, 7; also pronounced Ta1tm). This
mosque, the oldest in Cairo, was erected by Ahmed Ibn Tulan, the
founder of the dynasty of the Tulunides (p. xciii), in the year 879.
