QUANTITY AND ACUENTUATXON "Vowus. Vowels with a. ir1reumflex
accent (h) are long; other vowels are shut. The accent falls on the last
syllable when that it long (indicated by I), It falls on the third syllable
from the end when that and. the penultimate are short and neither vuwel
is followed by two consonants. It falls nu the penultimate (1) when that
is long or ends in two consonants and (2) when it is short and does not
end in two congouaats, but when the preceding syllable ends in two con-
aommis. Diphthongs (rss", er", au) must be reckoned as equivalent to long
vowels. There are exceptions to these rules.
