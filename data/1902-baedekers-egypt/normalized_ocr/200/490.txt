right contains MI image of the deceased; from that to the left 11 mummy-
shaft descends obliquely; adjacent is a Coptic inscription. In the deeply
recessed rear-wall of the Jett side are four smaller niches, probably in-
tended for the eoffms. This tomb also contains inscriptions of the Middle
Empire 1eeording its restoration by a descendant of Baati. - The next
tomb, Farther to the right, is of even greater interest than the one just
described. It belonged to a prince named Etu. The tomb is in the form
of a rectangle, with the mummy-shaft opening in the back-wall. The
representation of Etu to the left of the entrance, is very lifelike and
derives peculiar interest from the fact that the grandees of the early period
are seldom represented, as here, in full military activity: Our hero lifts
the arm vigorously to strike his foe. The mode of wearing the hair and
headdress, seen both in this figure and that of Bta' a wife, is tmusual.
Etu was :1 rich 1111111, possessing, according to the inscriptions, 2350 oxen.
On the left side of the rear- wall are several scenes from the private life
of the deceased. Cattle are being slaughtered, cooks are busy at their
work, etc. Above the door leading to the mummy-shaft we see an un-
usually large table, adjoining which is a long but much damaged in-
"yription.

The smaller tombs in the vicinity are less interesting. Several Coptic
inscriptions testify that unchorites found retreats in these tombs during
the Christian period.

Farther 011 we pass a fine mountain-mass, which looks especially
imposing by afternoon-light, and see several thrivingvillages, often
situated close to the river. 431/2M. ITru (E. bank), with 5000
inhab., is the Coptic Phbow, where, at 11 large convent founded by
Pachomius, the monks of all the convents in Egypt used to assemble
twice a year. A little farther to the S., outhe E. bank, lay Tabmmsi,
where Pnchomius founded the first convent about the middle of the
4th century.

461/2 M. Deshneh { Dechna }. with 11,000 inhatr, a railway and
steamboat station, is situated on the ruins of an ancient town.

65 M. Keneh Crail.and steamer station ], the ancient Kainepolis,
a town with 27, 500 inhstr, lies 011 the E. bank of a canal about
1 M. from the E. bank of the Nile. It is the capital of the fifth
Mudiriyeh of Upper Egypt, with an area of 597ur. M. and apopu-
Ietiou of 711,457. The town has post and telegraph offices, a US
commercial agent (Abd el-Ammari), and several hotels (Railway
Hotel; Htstel ales Eivangers; H6tel d' Alexandvie). Igeneh has a
special reputation for its Kulal (p1. of Kulle ], or 0001 porous water-
bottles, and for other clay vessels, Hundreds of thousands of these
vessels are annually exported from Keneh to Cairo and Alexandria
in boats of a primitive but nut unpraetieal descriptiun, constructed
for the purpose. At the time of the pilgrimage to Mecca Keneh
presents a very lively scene, as it is then frequented by large numbers
of the participators in that great religious picnic. The spiritual
and material wants of the pious Hegdg are catered for by six spacious
mosques, numerous tsoftee-houses, and a large number of places of
amusement, among the attractions of which Egyptian daniying-gir1s
tre prominent.
