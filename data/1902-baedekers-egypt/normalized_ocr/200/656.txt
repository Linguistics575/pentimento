LOWER NUBIA. 351

consisted, as it does to-day, of a number of separate districts (e.y.
the land of Wewet). The present inhabitants of Nubia are more
faithful to their ancient manners and customs than the Egyptians.

Iritstory. Lower Nubia, whence the Egyptians drew their sup-
plies of incense7 is mentioued in some of the earliest Egyptian in-
scriptions, Its relations with Egypt were still oloser under the kings
of the 6th Dyn., who there enlisted negro mercenaries, while the
princes of Elephantine dispatched great trading expeditions to the
lands of the Upper Nile. But it was not until the period of the
12th Dyn. that the conquest of Nubia was undertaken and the ture
ders of Egypt advanced to Semmh (p. 379). In order to guard the
newly acquired possessions against the attacks of the uegroes a
chain of forts was erected in the rocky valley of Bath el-Wgar
(p. 378), with its numerous cataracts. between Wadi iialfa and
Semneh. From this base the Pharaohs of the 18th Dyn. penetrated
still farther to the S. and made themselves masters of the land of
Kosh as far as Napata (p. 382), which then became the southernmost
city of the empire. The conquered regions were incorporated with
the southernmost department ongypt proper, which began at El-fob
(p. Mi), and the whole of the great province thus formed was placed
under an ot'fleiir1 who bore the title of'Prince of Kosh and Governor
of the Southern Larrds'. Under the established rule of Egypt Nubia
rapidly prospered; new towns were founded, and beautiful temples,
little inferior in size and embellishment to those of the motherland,'
arose in profusion, especially on the W. bank of the Nile, which
was safe horn the attacks of the E. Beduir1s. Most of these temples
were dedicated to the great Egyptian gods, Ammon, RE-Birrmiwhis,
and Ptah; but in some of them other deities were also worshipped,
such as Isis and others of the Egyptian gods, the local Nubian god
Tetuu7 the deceased King Usertesen m., who united the roles of
first conqueror and patron-saint of Nubia, and occasionally also the
reigning king and queen (pp. 360, MU, 3'70, 374). The temple-
inscriptions were composed in the Egyptian language and written
la the Egyptian oharacter, and Egyptian became the orMial Iy1-
guage, although the great mass of the people adhered to their native
Nubian tongue.

Nubia coatim1ed to be a dependency of the Pharaohs until about
1100 B.C. But when the power ofEgypt waned under the 2ist Dyn.
(p. lxxxiii), Nubia shook off her allegiance and a native ETHIOPIAN
MONARCHY was established, with Napata as its capital. But the
civilization of this kingdom continued to he Egyptian; and its
monarchs, who were dependent on the priests, regarded therhselves
"the true protectors of the Egyptian religion and l? the legitimate
rulers of Egypt. In 775 B.0. the Ethiopian Piwnkht [ p.lxiixilv) tem-
porarily over'ran all Egypt, and shortly afterwards an Ethioplan tiy-
