lxx DOCTRINES 0F EL..ISL23i.

to supersede the ancient law, and to introduce a modem European
system Cp. xx).

With regard to theological, legal, and still more to ritualistic
questions, El-Islem has not always been free from dissension. There
are in the first place four Orthodox sects, the J.hmeftes, the Share-
'ites, the Malekites, and the Hambalites, named after their founders.
In addition to these must be mentioned the schools of Free Thing-
ers, who sprang up at an early period, partly owing to the iafluenoe
of Greek philosophy. The orthodox party, however, triumphed, not
only over these heretics, but also in its struggle against the volup-
tuousness and luxury of the most glorious period of the khalifs.

Ascetism and fanaticism were also largely developed among
professors of EI-Islim, and another phase of religious thought Was
pure MYSTICISM, which arose'shieily in Persia. The mystics (rsati) in..
terpret many texts of the Koran allegorically, and their system there-
fore frequently degenerated into Pantheism. It was by mystics who
still remained within the pale of El-Islém (such as the famous Ibn

el-'Arabi, born in 1164 ] that the Orders of Dervishes were founded.

Dervishes (dumish, plan dardwz'ah). That earthly life is worthless, that
it is a delusion, and at best a period of probation, are sentiments of
frequent recurrence in the Fortud This pessimist view of life has been
eor1firmed by Mohammed's conception of the Supreme Being, on whose
awe-inspiriug attributes he has ehiefly dwell, thus filling his adherents
with a profound dread of their Creator. The result of this doctrine was
to induce devout persons to retire altogether from the wicked world, the
scene of vanity and disappointment, and to devote themselves to the prac-
tice of ascetic exercises, with a view to ensure their happiness in ammre
state. The fundamental aim of this asceticism was to strive after a
knowledge of God by cultivating a kind of half » consciuus and ecstatic ex-
ultatinn of mind. A mystic love of (mi was deemed the great assport
which enabled the worshipper to fall into this ecstatic trance, tin to lose
himself so cnmplelely in eur1ternplatior1 us to destroy his own individuality
(fund) and blend it with ihtt of the Deity (Hliluid). AS in Europe the
monastic system and the mendicant urders sprang from the example of
peuitents and hermils Who had renounced the world, so in the Mohammedan
world asceticism was rapidly developed into an organised system ofmen-
dicancy. At an early period many noble thinkers (such as the Persians
Sa'di and Wdiz) and talented poets enrolled themselves in the ranks of the
ascetirs, but the dervishes or the present day have entirely lost the spirit
of their prototypes, and have retained nothing bat the mere physical ca-
pacity for throwing themselves into a mechanical Mate of ecstasy and remi-
ering themselves proof against external sensations..

The following are the principal orders of dervishes Ctar'Tat ed-dariiwishy
in Egypt: -..

(1) The Rifd'iyeh (sing. "ifd'i), an order founded by Seiyid Ahmed
Rift" el-kebtr, possess a monastery near the mosque of Sultan Easan
(see y. MO, and are recognisable by their black flags and bleak or dark
blue tnrbaus. The best-know" sects of this order are the U'ldd'Ilwtin,
or'ltwmi.yeh Dervishes, and the Btfdigeh Dervish". The former are
nuted for their extraordinary performances at festivals, such as thrusting
iron nails into their eyes and arms, breaking large stones against their
chests, as they lie on their backs on the ground, and swallowing burning
charcoal and fragments of glass. The Sa'dtyeh, who usually carry
green flags, are st1ake-cltarmers (p. xxiv), and on the Friday on which
the birthday of the prophet is celebrated used to allow their shékh to
ride over them on horseback (the awseh; p. lxxvi ].
