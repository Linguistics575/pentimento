members of the various Mediterranean races, especially Syrians and
Greeks, known as Levantines, who have been settled here for several
generations, and form no inconsiderable element in the population
of the larger towns. Most of them profess the Latin form of 6jl1ris-
tianity, and Arabic has now become their mother tongue, although
they still speak their old national dialects. They are apt linguists,
learning the European languages With great rapidity, and good men
of business, and owing to these qualities they are often employed
as shopmen and clerks. Their services have also become indispeus-
able at the consulates and in several of the government-omits. A
large proportion of them are wealthy. The Egyptian press is almost
exclusively in the hands of Syrians.

Lf) ). ARMENIANS AND JEWS. This section of the community is
about as numerous as the last, and in some respects contrasts
favourably with it. The Armenians generally possess excellent
abilities, and a singular aptitude for learning both Oriental and
European languages, which they often acquire with great grammatical
accuracy. Many of them are wealthy goldsmiths and Jewellers.

The Jews are met with only in Cairo and Alexandria. They are
often distinguishable by their red hair from the native Egyptians,
as well as by other characteristics. Most of them are from Palestine,
though of Spanish origin, but many have recently immigrated from
Roumania. The latter are popularly called Ehleohti" /in reference
to the barbarous German idiom they speak. All the mouey-changers
in the streets (garrdf), and many of the wealthiestmerchants of Egypt,
are Jews, and notwithstanding the popular prejudice entertained
against them, owing as is alleged to their disregard of cleanliness,
they now form one of the most highly respected sections of the
community.

sembles that of their race in European countries.

(11). EUROPEANS. The number of European residents and
visitors in Egypt was 112,574 in 1897, inclusive of the British army
of occupation. The Greeks are most numerously represented, then
the Italians, English (including Indians and Maltese), French, Aus-
trians (including many Dalmatians), and Germans. The numerous
Swiss residents in Egypt, who are not represented by a consul
of their own, are distributed among the above leading classes
(French, Italian, German). Beside these nationalities, there are
also a few representatives of Russia, America, Belgium, Sean-
dinavia, and other countries. Each of the above leading nation-
alities shows a preference for one or more particular occupa-
tions, in which they sometimes enjoy a complete monopoly. The
Greeks of all classes are generally traders. They constitute the aris-
tocracy of Alexandria, and the vietual-dealers (ba.k.MI) in all the
other towns are mostly Greeks. They are the proprietors of the
small steam-mills that abound in the villages, and of the numerous
