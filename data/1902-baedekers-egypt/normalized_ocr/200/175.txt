clxiv BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS.

Ofthe ancient Palace: nothing but ruins now remains. Thelower
stories, built of massive blocks, have barrel-vaults and pointed arches
of hewn stone, the upper stories have similar vaults in lighter
masonry. In one case, ia the Beshtak Palace in the Béu el-Kas-
serén quarter at Cairo, we observe remains of balconies and of a
projecting, slightly curved cornice supported by wooden consoles;
and traces of richly painted coffered ceilings are also met with.
From an examination of the snauty remains and with the help of
the Arabic writers, whose descriptions, however, are seldom free
from fanciful exaggerations, we, mey conclude that the palaces re-
sembled in general the houses of the richer private citizens, exceed-
ing them only in size and splendour.

Dwelling Houses rarely have more than two stories; on the
groundfloor is the Salamlik, the men's apartments, and on the first
Mor the J.1artm, the women's apartments and family-rooms. The
following rules are generally observed in the construction of a dwell-
ing-house: - (1) The principal rooms look into the court or garden,
if there be one. co The windows looking to the street are as few
