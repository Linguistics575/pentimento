Tempteo/ Amman. THEBES (EBANK). 2d. Route. 255

worthy of that honour. Farther on this path turned off at right
angles to the S. and led to the entrance of' the -

Great Festal Temple of Thutmosia 111. We first enter a small
chamber in which two sixteen-sided columns are still standing,
and pass thence through another chamber with one column, and a
vestibule, into the Great Frstnl Hall. This has three aisles and is
144 ft. wide and 32 t't. deep. The root'was supported by 20 columns
in two rows, and 32 square pillars. The peculiar shape of the col-
umns here is quite unique; the shafts taper downwards, and the
capitals are in the form of inverted calyces, the petals of which
point downwards. The pillars, though not so tall as the columns,
were of the same height as the walls, and with the latter supported
the roofing slabs of the side-aisles. The roof of the lot'tier central
aisle was supported partly by the columns and partly by small
pillars with an arehitrave rising from the roof above the pillars to
the height of the columns. The reliefs on the pillars show Thut-
mosis III. in presence of the gods.

The rooms adjoining the festal hall, several of which are in ruins,
were adorned with ruliels by 1'11utrnoMs III. A door in the partly ruined
reer-Wall of the Colonnade leads E. to the SANCTUARY, which included
three ehamhers. Only the lower part of its walls is nowleft. Adjoining,
on the N., is a SMALL ROOM, with its root supported by 4 clustered papyrus-
columns With bud-capitals (still in good preservation); on the lower part
of the wall are vepresentatiuns of the plants and animals brought frnm
Syria to Egypt by Thutmosis III. in the 25th year of his reign. - To the
H. is the ALEXANDER ltoou, built by Thutmosis Ill. and restored by Alexan,
der the Great. The reliefs show Alexander (or in a few isolated cases
Thutmosis), saerifleing to the gods. - Farther on is I HALL, with 8 sixteen-
sided columns, "which q are still erect, and beyond that runs a CORRI-
mm, opening off which are two small rooms with columns and seven other
chambers, with reliefs or Thutmosis

In the above-mentioned chamber with om, column was found the
famous Karim }: Table of the Kings, a list of the Egyptian monarchs from
the earliest times down to the 18th Dyn. (now in the Blh1iothisque Na-
tionale in Paris).

The central and E. portions of the Temple of Amman (from
Pylon m onwards) were surrounded by a GIRDLE Warm, the ex-
tent remains of which are covered with reliefs of Ramses II. sacri-
ficing to the gods. Close behind the wall Ramses IL built a Colon-
nade (now completely mined), embellished with Osiris-statues, and
connected with a Small Temple (ruins uninteresting), built by the
same king.

Still farther to the E. is a well-preserved ancient Gateway, 62 ft.
in height, which was the E. entrance to the temple ofAmmon, and
lay 510 yds. distant from the ilrst Cw.) pylon. It was built by one
of the Ptolemies.

If we turn to the right (S.) outside the gateway, we soon reach a small
building hearing the eartouehes of Ramses m. and Ramses IV. - To the
N. of the gateway lies a small Temple of Osiris, dedicated hy Amenertais,
sister of shehako J. (25th Dyn.) and mother-in-law of Pmmmetikh I.
bear it are several small chapels ot' the same period C26'th Dyn J.
