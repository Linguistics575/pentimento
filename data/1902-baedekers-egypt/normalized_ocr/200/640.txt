the daggeroue monsters offered to convey him to the island bu his back, out
of gratitude for the young man's previous kindness tn animals. The lover
was thus able to reach the prison of his mistress, and the guards suirered

tanebos (c. 350 8.0), to which the oldest temple buildings on the
island belong. But there is little doubt that both Philte and the ad-
