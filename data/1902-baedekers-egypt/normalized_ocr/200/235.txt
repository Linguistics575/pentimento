A. Cairo.

PLAN Oh CAuw. The European names of the streets used formerly
to be written up in French only, so far in they were written up at all,
but since the British occupation the Arabic names have been used,
transliterated en a careless and inexact system (p. clxixJ. Our plan follows
this tran'literation in general, correcting, however, the more obvious
defects (e.g. the English'ee' is represented, as in the text, hy'P). Some
of the French names have been retained.

Hotels. The leading hutcls at Cairo are excellent, and even those of
the second class are well t1ttcd up, nearly all having electric light, baths,
eta; children and servants pay 1x: th'-price; comp. p. xviii. As all the hotels
frequently are full, especially in Jan., Feb., and March, it is a wise pre-
caution to telegraph for rooms from Alexandria or Port Su'id.
