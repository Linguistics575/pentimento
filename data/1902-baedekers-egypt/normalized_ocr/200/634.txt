either msgect the large new Mic Dam, with the permission of one of the
"'1rg,1L" 1T.tie11ier. at She1lcil, or visit the ancient Gmm'te Quarries (p. 330),
- J rovxsmns and tickets of admission should not be forgotten.

The return by boat down the smaller cataract has now been rendered
impossible by the works for the new dam (see below)

The RAILWAY, starting at the Luxor Station, to the S. of' Assuin,
describes a wide curve round the N. and S. granite quarries (p. 330)
and ends at the station of Shellél (p. 336).

The DESERT Rome, which crosses the railway-line and leads
past the Arabian and European cemeteries (the latter containing
the graves of' many British soldiers), is the old road described by
Strabo, who assigns it a length of 50 stadia. Ou the heights to the
right are small British forts and bloek-huusuys. Beside the road lie
large blocks of' granite, with ancient inscriptions carved by Egyptian
offieiUs employed in the quarries. M. rle Morgan has numbered
these inscriptions with white numbers. Farther on, beyond the
point where the route viii the river-bank diverges (see below), We
notice considerable fragments of an ancient Brick Wall, incorporat-
ing a few granite blocks, which was probably erected as early as
the Middle Empire to protest the mad against the predatory attacks
of the E. deSert-trihes. The wall is 6 ft. thick and, at places, 12 ft.
high. It flrst appeare to the W. of the road, then crosses it, and
remains on the E. side as far as 8helliit Cp. 336).

The RIVERSIDE ROUTE diverges to the right from the Desert Route
about 1/2 M. beyond the European cemetery, approaches the river,
and reaches the village of Maltatta, opposite the island of Sehél.

The island of Sehir1, lying below the cataract and rear-hed from Assuin
hy heat, was dedicated to Anukis, and contains over 200 roek-inscrip-
tions, besides the ruins of two temples. One of the temples (io the S.)
dates from the 18th Dyn., the other, near the village of Sehél on the W.
side of the island, from the Ptolemaic period (Philupatur). High up .m
the S.E rocks of the island is an important inscription of the Ptolemaic
period, recording that in the reign of the primieval King Zosertp.134) the
Nile failed to rise during a period of seven years and thattyfaaniue arose
in the land in enusequence, until at the prayer of the king the Eatarael-
god Khnum put an cud to it by a fresh inundation.

Beyond Sehél we ride inland across loose rocks, and pass through
the long Nubian village of' Kamr; then, after traversing the desert
fer a short distance, we return to the river. The view of the stream
with its numerous dark-eo1o11red granite rocks, covered with a
smooth glaze, like enamel, is very fine, although the foaming rapids
of the Great Cataract are now things of the past. To the right are
the works of the new Barrage (Arabic, el-Khazt'in), a gigantic dam
which is expected to be finished in 1903. The object of this huge
undertaking is to dam up the waters of the Nile to a depth of 65 ft.
during the inundation, in order to utilize it gradually for the regular
irrigation of the entire country throughout the rest ofthe year. The
Gm, which is being constructed of solid granite masnnry, is It IM.
