HISTORY. lxxxi

XIII. and XIV. DYNASTIES.

The monarchs of the ISM Dynasty, most of whom were named
Sebekhotep, maintained Egypt at the height of her power for some
time, but a period of decline afterwards set in. There is no period
of Egyptian history at whirh kings were more numerous, most of
them reigning but a short time. The South was probably ruled by
the descendants of the ancient Theban kings, while in the town of
Xois, in the W. Delta, another family raised themselves to power,
forming the 14th Dynasty.

ii. Hyksos Period (ca. 1700-1575 B.C.).
XV. and XVI. DYNASTIES.

Egypt was now conquered by a Semitin people, known as Hyksos,

i.e.'Shepherd Kings' or, perhaps more correctly,'princes ot' the

Shosu' or Syrian Bed uins. Few of their monuments have been pre-

served (statue of Kheyan, see p. 86); but it is evident that they
conformed to the ancient culture of Egypt.

6. The New Empire C1600-ii00 3.0.).

Egypt became a great power during this period. At first the culture of
the New Empire differed little from that of the Middle Empire, but
under Thutmusis III. political and social life as well as the art of Egypt
underwent a radical change, owing to the new relations with W. Aim
The tribute paid by foreign states caused an enormous flood of wealth
to pour Into Egypt, and especially into Thebes, the capital. The earlier
buildings, that had fallen into disrepair, were now replaced hy impasing
monuments, such as the temples at Karrtak, Luxor, etc.

XVII. DYNASTY (ea. 1600-1545).

While the Hyksos kings maintained themselves in the N., the S.

was ruled by Thehan princes, who were at first vassals of the foreign

intruders. The tombs of these princes lie near Drah Abu'l Negga.

Sekenyen-RE 1., IL, m. The mummy of one of these was found
at Dir el-babri (p. 278).

Kemosii. His queen was perhaps Ahhotep, whose jewels are now in
the Museum "Gizeh (p. 83 ].

Amoais (Ahmos√©, 1580-1555 B.O.) conquered Auaris, the chief fort-
ress of the Hyksos, and expelled the intruders from Egypt,
which was reunited under one sweptre.

Amenophis I, (Amenliotep, 1555-1545 13.0.). This king and his
mother Netret-er" e' were afterwards regarded as the patron-gods of
the Neoropolis of Thebes.

*XVIII. DYNASTY CL5Ui-i360 B.G.),

Thutmoais I. (Thutmoai, 1545-1515 13.0.) re-conquered Nubia. His
tomb at Bibiu eI-Huiiie (p. 277) was the first royal mck-tomb
constructed under the Pharaohs. During his lifetime his children
fought for the succession.
