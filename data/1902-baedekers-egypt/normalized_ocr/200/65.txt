farrowed with numerous ravines, and occasionally nearly 1000 ft. in height.
The different strata of the earlier nummulite formation, as well its those
of the upper chalk, are here exposed to view, and generally enntain TIII-
mernus fossils. The names: particularly those of Dakhe) and Khieirgeh,
are remarkable for their fossil wealth. The soil of the deep depressions
in which these eases lie, partly below the level of the Nile, consists of
the variegated clayey or sandy strata of the upper chalk. The ground
is strongly impregnated with alum at places. Numerous thermal springs
well up from the upper strata of the chalk, and the soil thus irrigated is
luxuriantly clothed with vegetation, The barrier of Nubian sandstone
which abuts on the valley of the Nile at Silsileh extends far into the
Libyan desert. It forum the Ennthwestern boundary of the oases of khiirgeh
end DÃ©khel, beyond which it stretches for an unknown distance into
the heart of the desert. This formation cuntains si1icuied wood and iron
and manganese ores in abundance. About six days' Journey to the W.
of the cases begins a complete ucean of sand. As far as the eye can
reach we discover nnthing but a vast expanse onoose yellow sand, which
generally forms itself into ranges of sand-hills, many miles in length,
and ooeasionally rising to a height ot' 1500 ft. ur upwards above the level of
the plain.

The oasis of Iurdfra lies in a rececs eroded in the nummulite lime-
stone. To the N. and W. of Farafra extends the eneene limestone plateau
its far as the neighbourhood of Siam, between which oasis aad Bahriyeh
it is remarkable for its numerous basin-shaped and sharply definiu1 de-
pressions. The whole of the desert around the Oasis of Ammun consists
of recent tertiary deposits, the fossil wealth of which was once extulled
by Herodotus and Eratosthenes.

d. Agriculture and Vegetation.

I. CAPABILITIES OF THE SOIL. In the time of the Pharaohs the
Egyptian agricultural year was divided into three equal parts,
the period of the inundation (from the end of June to the end of
October), that of the growing of the crops (from the end of Oe-
tober to the end of February), and that Of the harvest (from the
end of February to the end of June). At the present day there are
two principal seasons, corresponding to our summer and winter,
besides which there is a short additional season, corresponding with
the late summer or early autumn of the European year. The land
is extremely fertile, but it is not so incapable of exhaustion as it is
sometimes represented to be. Many of the crops, as elsewhere, must
occasionally be ml1osvei1 by a fallow period; others thrive only when
a certain rotation is observed (such as Wheat, followed by clover and
beans); and some fields require to be artitieia1ly manured. Chuya-
sionally two crops are yielded by the same iiehl in the same season
(wheat and Se ffron, wheat and clover, etc.) The great extension with-
in the last thirty or forty years of the cultivation of the sugar-cane,
which requires a great deal ot'moisture, and ofthe eottou-plant, which
requires extremely little, has necessitated considerable modifieations
in the modes ot'irrigation and cultivation hitherto in use. As both of
these crops are of a very exhausting character, the land must either
be more frequently left fallow, or must be artiiitrially manured. The
industry and powers of endurance of the Egyptian peasantry are
thus most severely tried, although the homogeneous soil of the
