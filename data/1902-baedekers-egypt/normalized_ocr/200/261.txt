vestibule and then the sanctuary, a magnitioent apartment with
lofty stilted arches. The decoration is simple. The lower part
of, the wall with the prayer-niehe is, however, tastefully adorned
with gilded panels and coloured marbles, while the middle part
displays a rich mosaic of coloured marbles, terminating below in
charming dwarf arcades with colonnettes of blue glass. The upper
part of the wall bears inscriptions in bold black letters, interspersed
with gilded arsbesqaes and. rosettes in marble medallions. The
coloured wooden mailing and the inlaid ornamentation of the pulpit
and doors also deserve notice. 0n the left is the mausoleum of
the sultan, end on the right that of his family. The Liwin is
separated by a modern iron railing from the court, which is planted
with trees.

Immediately adjoining the mosque is the tow11-gus BM, tarihr.
wéleh (P1. E, l), at the end of the street. This is built of solid
blocks of stone and resembles the two other gates of the Fi.timite
period, the Bah el-Futt11, and the Bib-sn-Nay o. 62). It was
erected at the end of the 11th cent. by Greek builders from Edessa.
The S. side consists of two huge towers; by that to the W. are a
number of stone and wooden balls, probably dating from the Mame-
luhe period. Tt1rr1kn Bey, the last of the Giroassiau sultans of Egypt,
was hanged outside this gate by Sultan Selim L, on 15th April,
1517 (p. 33j. This gate is also called Btr'h el-hfitureW, from the
old tradition that the most highly revered saint Kutb el-Mitwelli
has his abode behind the western gate, where he sometimes makes
his presence known by e gleam of light. From the inner (E) gate
hang bunches of hair, teeth, flowers, shreds of clothing, and other
votive ofterirrgs, placed here by sick persons who hope thereby to be
cured of their diseases. Opposite the outside of the gate is the sehil
of Sultan Farag, by the large grated window of which executions by
strangulation took place down to the middle of the 19th century.

From the Zuwéleh Gate the Dem; EL-AIjMAR (Pl. E, 4) leads
towards the E. About 200 yds. from the gate is the recently restored
*Mosque of the Emir Kismas e1aslpklri, a small bat handsome
building, erected in 1481 in the style of Ifrit Bey. The mausoleum,
which is large in proportion to the mosque, long remained empty,
as Emir Kismés el-Ishéki, master of the horse to lgei't Bey, died
and was buried in Syria. In 1851, however, the pious Shekh Abu
Hariha was interred here. - In the same street, farther on named
SHARI'A ET-TABBANEH (P1.E,4,5), lies the restored thittti'a Altun
Bogha. e1-hrertliud, built by Emir el-Merdéni, taup-bamrr of Sultan
Mohammed eu-Ns'tsir, and finished in 1332. The new concrete dome
in front of the ITayer-niohs is home by superb ancient Egyptian
granite columns. The tasteful ornamentation of the ceiling and the
elaborate mosaic of the prayer-niche also demand attention.
