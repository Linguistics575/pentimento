ALEXANDRIAN ART. Llvii

wrestling-ring, and still more from the popular pleasure-resorts in
the streets; for the Alexendrians, notorious for their love of' pleasure
and enjoyment of ridicule1 took peculiar delight in jugglers end
mountebanhs of' all kinds, and in dwarfs and cripples, etc. Car-
ieatures, sometimes of the most doubtful character. thus form a
considerable fraction among the productions of this art. At the same
time the artists preserved also a certain strain of idealism, shown in
their inclination to present these genre motives in mythological set-
ting, as when they represent Satyrs and Cupids in all kinds of genre
situations, Aphrodite beating the mischievous Cupid, Hercules stag-
gering home intoxicated from the banquet, etc.

Talent for decorative art is apparent even in these creations. But
it achieves higher things in the mural frescoes and in the reliefs1 the
most developed form of which, the pictorial relief with landscape
background, also took its Iise ander the influene, e of Ptolemaic art.
Numerous mural paintings in the Greek style have recently come to
light in the ancient cemeteries of Alexandria, and many of these
are, signit1tyynt1y, found beside "beneath frescoes in the revived
Egyptian style. When the graves were used a second time the Greek
paintings were covered with whitewash and the Egyptian frescoes
were painted on the top. Examples of both styles may be. seen in the
museum at Alexandria (Room XI, No. 8). The technical delicacy
and freshness of conception which we: still characteristic of Alex-
andrian painting at, the imperial epoch are apparent in the Portraits
attached to the heads of mummies, painted on thin wooden tablets,
in tempera7 or in encaustic colours. or in :1 style uniting both these
methods. The practice of furnishing the mummy-covering with a
portrait reproducing the features of' the deceased dates from early
Egyptian times. In the Hellenistic period masks modelled in stucco
and coloured, or paintings upon wood were chosen for this purpose,
in order that the features of' the deceased might be portrayed as those
of a living person. In most, cases ill fact, even in portraits of the
rudest make, the lifelike expression is surprising. They look as
though they were executed from the living model, so that the theory
that they were posthumous portraits is not very probable. At the
back of some of these portraits a layer of mortar, about an inch in
tl1iekness, has been found, and in others there are holes, which
seem to have been meant for nails to fasten the picture to the well;
and from these circumstances we may conclude that portraits of this
kind used to be painted as ornaments for rooms during the lifetime
of the persons represented, and that they were removed from the
wall and placed on the mummy-eovering after death, except when
it Was preferred to substitute napies of the originals. From the in-
vestigations which Prof. Georg Ebers has devoted to this class of'
portraits, it would seem that most, if not, all, of the speeimens yet
known come from the cemeteries of the Faytun. The persons 18.
presented are mostly Hellenistic Egyptians of Greek origin, but there
