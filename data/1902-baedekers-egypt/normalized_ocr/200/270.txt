The FIRST LATERAL HALL contains a collection ofPersian Miniatures.
The origin and deveiopment of this branch of art have not yet been ad-
equately investigated. The specimens here exhibited, most of which were
collected by the late Mustafe Fidil Pasha, hrother of Isma'il Pasha, and
were afterwards purchased by the Egy ptian government, have all been
produced under Mohammedan iafluemees, though evidences of B. Asiatia
taste are abundant. These iarfiiiririi't'Grs' ere distinguished from the
purely ornamental art of the Karena in the lower hall by a greater free-
dom of conception and variety of motive, pavh'usularly by the frequent em-
ployment of living mrmsNeavly all are illustrations of poetical 01- his-
torical works. The chronological arrangement shows that this art was at
its best in the 14-17th cent., and that thereafter a rapid decline set in.
The finest miniatures are shown in the cases in the middle of the room.
