(on a smaller scale). Rear Wall: Makere between Bath or and Ammon,
who holds the hieroglyph for'life' before her face. Above the
entrances to the recesses CPI. t, u), Makeré and Thutmosis offer
milk and wine to Hathor.

We return hence to the Central Court and ascend the inclined
approach which brings us first to a much ruined TERRACE, the roof
of which was borne by a double row of pillars and sixteen-sided
columns. A granite doorway here gives access to the -

Irpper Court. The reliefs of a festive procession Which adorned
this hall have suffered severely at the hands of the Coptic monks.
Turning sharp to the right (N.), we reach a door (P1. x) admitting
to a Vresaanu1m, which had three sixt6sn-sirl6d columns. Opposite
the door is a small Recess (PI. y), with representations of Queen
Makcre in good preservation.

Rear Wall of the recess: Makcré (erased) before Ammon. Side Walls:
MakerE seated at table, with the priest En-metf in front of her. The l'rgisve
ot the queen is uninjured, contrary to the nsuul practice; but the priest's
frgure was defaced by Amcnophis IV.

To the left of the vestibule we enter an Open Court, in which is
an *Altar, approached by ten steps, and dedicated by Makeré to
the sun-god Ré-Harmaehis. It is one of the very few altars that have
qome down to us from Egyptian antiquity on their original sites.
In the W. well of this court is a small recess, 5-6 ft. in height, with
saerifieial scenes on the wulls. The figure of Makere receiving the
offerings has been scratched out.

A door in the N. Well of this court admits to a Chapel, compris-
ing two chambers, the ceilings of which, decorated with yellow
stars on a blue ground, are vaulted in the pointed style. With a
few unimportant exceptions the reliefs on the wells have been (tare-
fully nhisellcd away by Thutmosis III. and Aruenophis IV. On the
side-walls of the Mt Chamber (P1. D) Maker?) offers sircrif1ees to var-
ions deities, mainly deities of the dead, such as Anubis, Sokaris,
Osiris, Emo-wet, and also to Amman. Above a bench against the
end-wall is a representation of Makeré and Thutmosis 1. before the
fetish of Eme-wet. 2nd Chamber. On the right wall; Thutmosis I.
(originally Makere) end his mother Senyseneb (with figures unin-
jured), saerifieing to Amman. On the left wall: Mekeré and her
mother Ahmes ssorifieing to Ammon. On the tyr1d-wa11: Makere end
Anubis.

0n the S. side of the upper court are several chambers now in
ruins, and a well-preserved SACRIFICIAL HALL, with a vaulted roof,
which was used for the cult of the memes of Makeré and is adorned
with reliefs.

To the right and left of the entrance: Slaughter and cutting up Of the
saevuiela1 beasts. 0n the side-walls are shown three rows ofpriests and
offieia1s bringing saer'1iieia1 gifts to Maliere, and above are three rows of

tyaeriireial objects of various kinds. Malreré herself (elftused) is seated to
the right (lett on the other wall), with a list of the offerings before her,
