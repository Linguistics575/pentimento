better to obtain a good general impression from the whole, than to examine
the details minutely. Luneheot1, Which the traveller must bring with
him, is usually taken near the Kiosk o. 343).

From the landing-place we proceed to the S.W. end of the is-
land to visit the extensive Outer Temple Court, which is bounded
on the N. by the first pylon of the Temple of Isis, on the S. by the
Vestibule of Nektanebos, and on the E. and W. by colonnades. This
court dates from the late-Ptolemaic period or from the reign of Au-
gustus. Attention should be paid to the strong Quay Wall that per-
haps was carried round the greater part of the island, with flights of
stone steps at various points. The remains of one such flight may be
seen on the S. bank, to the E. of the building of Nektanebos.

The VESTIBULE 0F NEKTANEBOS was built by Nektanebos as the
vestibule for a temple, dedicated to'his mother Isis, revered at Aba-
ton, mistress of Philae, and to the Hathor of Senmet' (p. 314). The
temple was swept away by the floods of the Nile very shortly after its
completion; but Ptolemy Philadelphus caused the vestibule to be
thoroughly restored. The elegant little structure was supported by
14 columns with varying floral capitals, above each of which was a
second capital bearing a head of Hathor. Unfortunately only six of
the columns are now standing, and the roof has disappeared. Be-
tween the columns were screen-walls, over 6 ft. in height, crowned
with concave cornices and rows of Urmus- serpents, and interrupted
on the E., W., and N. by exit-doors. These screens-walls bore
reliefs showing King Nektanebos offering gifts to the gods. Before
the river-front of the temple two Obelisks upon chest-shaped bases
were erected in the Ptolemaic period. These were made of sand-
stone instead of the usual granite. TheW. obelisk, bearing a Greek
and several Arabic inscriptions, is still standing, though it has lost
its apex; the E. obelisk is represented by its base only.

The WEST Commune, which follows the line of the shore of the
island, is 100 yds. in length and has a row of 31 (former1y 32) plant
columns, each 16 ft. high, no two capitals of which are alike. Most
of the columns have two series of reliefs, showing Tiberius offering
gifts to the gods. The ceiling, which is partly destroyed, is decorated
with stars and flying vultures. The rear-wall, the windows in which
command a beautiful view of the stream and of the island of Bigeh
(p. Md), is embellished with two horizontal rows of alto-reliefs,
representing the Pharaoh (usually Augustus or Tiberius) offe1'ing
various gifts to the gods. The relief over the window opposite the
first two columns (P1. a) is specially noteworthy for its excellently
preserved colouring and the delicacy of its execution; it represents
Nero offering two eyes to Horus, Isis'the good sister', and the'lord
of both lands'. - A subterranean stairway leads outside this colon-
nade to a small Nilometer.

The EAST COLONNADE is unfinished; only six of its if) columns
are completed, the remainder were left merely rough-hewn. The
