DAWN. 9. Route 153

If time permit, the traveller may now proceed to the 8. Group
of fiald.cfira, a ride of 11/4 hr. to the S. from Mariette's House. We
pass near a space of ground about 440 yds. square, enclosed by
broad and massive, but now very dilapidated walls 011 the E., N.,
and W. sides, while the S. side is bounded by the natural hills of
the desert-The route now leads straight to the Mastaba el-Fir'auu,
the most interesting monument in the S. group. To the left are
the dilapidated Pyramids of Pepi I. and Merem'é and a pyramid
called by the Arabs Harem esh-Showwéf. on the NW. side of the
Mastaba ert1r'aun is the Pyramid of Pepi ff. All these pyramids
(now inaccessible) are constructed and adorned exactly in the
same manner as that of King Chtnos o. 134). The Maggaba el-
Fir'atm, resembles in its shape some of the mastabas of the Middle
Empire. The passages in the interior resemble those in the pyr-
amids of Onnos and his successors, so that this monument may
probably enough be a king's grave, as its name implies ('grave of
Pharaoh'). The top, which is easily reached, commands a fine view.

On the S. and E. slopes of the plateau of Sakkara are numerous
Rock Tombs. They are far simpler than the mastabas both in point

of construction and of internal decoration.

About 11/2 M. to the S. of the Mastaba el-Fir'aun lie the Necropo1is and
Pyramids of Dahahiur. Here rise two large pyramids and a smaller one of
limestone, and two of brick (the'Black Pyramids'), together with remains
of others, all of which are at a considerable distance from each other.
The N. Brick Pyramid, which was once covered with slabs of stone, is
probably the tomb of King Usertesen m. (12th Dyn.). The length of
the side at the base is 345 ft., while the height is now only about 90 ft.
To the N. of this pyramid, but within the girdle-wall that formerly
enclosed it, are two subterranean galleries with tomb-chambers in
which female members of the royal family were interred. In the lower
of these galleries were found the jewels of the princesses Sit-Hathor and
Merit (now. in the Gizeh Museum, p. 82). - At the E. base of the pyramid
is a house belonging to the Service des Antiquités, in which the night may
be spent by permission previously obtained at the Museum in Grizeh.

To the S.W. of the N. Brick Pyramid lies a larger Stone Pyramid.
This is still 326 ft. in height and 234 yds. in width, being nearly as large
as the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, and in its solitude presents a very imposing
appearance, even to an accustomed eye. It was probably (like the Pyr-
amid of Meidtm, p. 192) built by Snofru, and is thus the most ancient
royal tomb in the form of a pyramid.

To the E. and S. are remains of several other pyramids. Still farther
to the S. rises a pyramid of peculiar form, sometimes called the Blunted
Pyramid, the lower part- rising at an angle of 54° 41'. while the sides of
the apex form an angle of 42° 59'. This pyramid is 2061/2 yds. square and
321 ft. in height. The exterior coating is in good preservation. The
interior was explored as early as the year 1660 by an English traveller
named Melton. In 1860 M. Le Brun found a small chamber in the interior.
No clue to the name of the builder has been discovered.

To the E. of the Blunted Pyramid and a few kilometres to the S. of
the N. Brick Pyramid, not far from the village of Nenshtyeh, which lies
on the edge of the desert to the N. of Dahshiir, rises the S. Brick Pyramid.
This, which was originally covered with limestone slabs, was perhaps
built by King AmenemhEt III. (12th Dyn.). To the N. of it, but enclosed
by the former girdle-wall, are the graves of King Her and Princess Neb-
hetepti-khrot (p. 82). Between the N. and S. Brick Pyramids is the ruined
Pyramid of Amenemhat JJ. (12th Dyn.).
