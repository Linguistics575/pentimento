of the same name near Berenike).

dth Day. Descent through the Wddi 2htzali, with its aeacias. Rude
designs and graffiti 0n the rocks. From this point a diverging route leads
direct to the emerald mines of the Gehel Zaibara (see below) We cross

next proceed through the broad green Wddi Motilfleh towards the Gabe!
Jfa'igef, near which is a spring of excellent water.

5th Day. Through huge granite rocks to groups of rude stone huts,
probably built by miners View of Gehel Ziibara. On a rock to the right
is a view of an Egyptian bark, with sails and oars. Farther on is a ruined
station, with the remains of a stone hut.

6th Day. Anrient station of ed-Dueig. Adjacent is another smaller

We pass the granite hill of Abu Irid.

of that name, crosses our route, and proceeds in windings to the Red
Sea The last station is Aim Greta, comprising several buildings, the
largest of which contains the remains of rooms. Another rectangular
building seems to have been a reservoir for water.

10th Day. Arrival at St'kket Bender, near the ruins of the old temple
of Berenike.

The town of Berenike (Bereniee), situated in the same latitude as
Assuiin, was founded in B.C. 275 by Ptolemy Philadelphus, who revived
the commerce of the Red Sea by the establishment of several new ports.
The town, which was named by Ptolemy after his mother, was the ter-
minus of the main desert-routes from Egypt, and for Koo or 500 years was
the cntrep0t of a marine commerce carried on mainly with Arabia and
India. The ruins, still extant, surround the Trmple, which faces the
E.N.E. In front is a fore-court 281/2 ft. in width and 12 ft. in depth,
whieh was adjoined by the temple proper (inner length 31 ft.), com-
prising two rows of apartments The representation 0n the left outside-
wall shows an emperor (probably Hadrian) appearing before a goddess,
who seems to be, from the legend, the tutelary deity of the green (i.e.
emerald) mine.

The Emerald Mines, 1h" to the N. of Berenike, were worked by the
Arabs, according to Makrizi, down to the year 760 of the Hegira (1370 A.D.),
after which they were abandoned. Mohammed 1Ali made an unavailing
attempt to re-open them. They lie partly in the Wadi fjakiit and partly on
the Gabe! Jhibava, 14 M. to the ICE. They are best visited from Contra
Apollinopelis, but may, like Berenike, he approached by following the
coast of the Arabian Gulf from Koser. The first route diverges from the
road to Berenike in the Wadi Genuil (see above). To the s. of the Gebel
Libara lies the village of Sake't, with the huts of miners and a small
rock-hewn temple, with a few Greek inscriptions.
