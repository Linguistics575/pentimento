distinct quarter of the town, almost exclusively inhabited by Copts
and now known as the Kasa- oli-8liamra. It is built within the
girdle-wall of the ancient Roman Castle of Babylon (pp. 32, 73 ].
Here, enclosed by a dense mass of houses, is situated the much
frequented Coptic church of -

Abu Sergeh (St. Sergius), According to a wide-spread belief
this church was built before the Mohammedan conquest, but this
can be true of the crypt only. According to tradition, the Virgin
and Child after their flight to Egypt spent a month in this crypt.

This church may be regarded as the original model of the older
Egyptian-Byzantine churches in which the Coptic Christians now
worship 1'. The basilica consists of a nave and aisles, the latter pro-
vided with galleries. The nave and tribune have open roofs, that of
the latter being supported by elliptical beams, and both being
probably of later date than the church itself. The lofty side-walls
of the nave consist of two rows of columns, one above the other, the
columns of the lower row being separated by keel-arohes, while
the upper series, supporting the gallery, consists of alternate groups
of two marble columns and one pillar of masonry, connected by
an architrave. The columns of marble originally belonged to ancient
edifees, and have been placed here without the least regard to their
suitability in point of diameter, form of capital, or other architectural
features. Two of the three original entrances are now built up, while

i. Coptic Worship. On entering the church, the members of the con-
gregation first pay their homage to a number of pictures of saints hanging
on the walls (the veneration of saints and of the Virgin being a prominent
feature of the Coptic system), and then kneel before the altar and kiss
the hand of the priest. They then take their stand (for there are no seats)
In the part of the church allotted to them, leaning on crutches which
they bring for the purpose, as the service often lasts for three hours.
The service begins with the reading or chanting of prayers and passages
from the Gospels, partly in the Coptic language, and partly in Arabic,
in which the priest is assisted by a schoolmaster and a choir of boys.
During this performanee the worshippers, with very few exceptions,
engage freely in conversation. After a time the burning ofincense begins.
The priest, swinging his censer1 leaves the h√©kal and joins the con-
gregation, each member of which he blesses, placing his hand on their
heads. - The Celebration of the Eucharist is very frequent in the Coptic
churches, Immediately following the ordinary service. -. On Palm Sunday
wreaths of palm are blessed by the priest, which are then worn by the
Copts under their tarbtuhes during the whole of the following year as
amulcts against every misfortune that can befall body or soul, - On
18th January, the anniversary of the Baptism of Christ Cid el-yhi.his),
men and boys plunge into the large font or bath Which is to be found
in most Coptic churches, the water having been first blessed by the priest.
Or they perform the same ceremony in the Nile, into which they first
pour some consecrated water. On the eve of this festival, as well as on
Holy Thursday and on the festival of the Apostles, the priest washes the
feet of the whole of his congregation. - An external form to which the
Copts attach great weight is the observance of fasts, and a Copt who is
negligent in this respect will rarely be met with. On these occasions all
kinds of animal food, not excepting fat, eggs. butter, and cheese, are
prohibited. - Comp. Butler's'L'optic Churches of Egypt' (1884).
