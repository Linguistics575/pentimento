A few paces to the E. of the tomb of Re-gem-ni is a Street of
Tombs, exhumed by Loret in 1899. Several interesting structures
of the 6th Dyn. were discovered here.

The first is the somewhat ruinous tomb of Jla-nefer-seshem, surnamed
Sheshi, a vizier and judge, the chief remains of which are a hall with six
square pillars, each bearing the tigure of the deceased, and an elegant stele.

The first tomb on. the left in the Street of Tombs proper is that of
'Uihtkh-merhrov, surnamed dlesi. Through the door we enter a. chamber
with reliefs of fluvial life (water-animals, fish, crocodile. hippopotamus),
beyond which is a second room, with a representation of the deceased
inspecting his fisheries. In one of the doorways are interesting reliefs of
surgical operations; on the right, circumcision, on the left, an operition
on a man's toe. In the adjoining room are figures of dancers. - The
next tomb belongs to We-he-Ni or Ptah-nefer-seshem, surnamed Sheshi,
'the first next to the king'. In a chamber with fine painted reliefs is the
door-shaped stele, with two figures of the deceased emerging; above the
door is a recess with a bust of the deceased. In another room is shown
a poultry-yard. - The last tomb (on the left), that of Ke-eper,'the first
next to the king', is built of crude bricks, the door alone being of limo.
stone. - On the rubbish above the ancient graves at the end of the street
stands a Tomb ofthe New Empire, with the stumps of four papyrus-eo/ns.

The street, bending to the right wo, leads to the ruined Pyramid of
Queen I'epwet. The stepped core, On which the limestone blocks of the outer
covering are laid, is still clearly discernible. Adjoining the E. base of the
pyramid stands the temple, in the central chamber of which is the shattered
stele, with the granite altar still lying in front of it. On the debris of
the pyramid stands a tomb of the New Empire, with a fine tombstone.
