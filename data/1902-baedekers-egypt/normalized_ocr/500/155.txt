extent to which these'everlasting abodes' might be enlarged and
developed is best illustrated by the Mas.taba of Mereruka at Sakhara
(p.1i8), which, like any ordinary well-to-do house, contains a suite
of rooms for the master, another (the harim) for his wife, a third,
behind, for the son, besides various store-rooms. The inner walls
were embellished with inscriptions and representations (usually in
relief), the chief object of which was to place the deceased in the
possession of as many saerifieial offerings as possible (comp. pp. 137
et seq.). The deceased and the members of his family were re-
presented by statues, which were placed in one or more special
rooms (the so-eallei1 Serdfibs, Le. cellars) constructed in the thick-
ness of the walls and connected with the other chambers by means
of small apertures only. Most of the fine statues of the Ancient
Empire nowin the Museum at Gizeh (pp. 79-81) were found in such
serdahs. The adfin of wood or stone, containing the corpse wrapped
in bandages, stood in a subterranean chamber, to which a perpen-
dicular shaft, from 10 to 90ft. in length, descended from the floor
of the innermost room or from the centre of the flat roof.

Just as the streets of a town were arranged round the palace of
the prince: so the rows of mastabas were grouped around the tomb

of the king. Originally the royal tombs were large brick mastahas
like the others (eomp. p. cxliii), containing chambers for the body
of the king and for the various funeral gifts. Subsequently they
assumed the form of a step-pyramid, rising above the subterranean
tomb-chamber, as we may see in the step-pyramid at Sakhalin
(Fig. V1116, and p. 134). The normal form of pyramid (Fig. VlIIa)
was not introduced until the beginning of the 4th Dynasty, but
thenceforward it remained the usual form for royal tombs until
the 18th Dynasty. In the rock beneath the massive stone erection
of the pyramid a sloping shaft led to a subterranean passage,
which was closed. by means of a stone trap-door, and to the
chamber in which the sarcophagus stood. The great pyramids at
Gizeh (pp. 116-122), the step-pyramid at Sahkara, and various
others contain several passages and several chambers, but the
