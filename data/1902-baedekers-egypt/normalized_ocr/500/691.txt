The THREE DAYS' HALT of the tourist-trains (p. 381) allows sufficient
time for an inspection of the principal sights, for a shooting-expedition
to the R35 Ehartiim (p.383) and up the White Nile to the OM.) tree
known as Mushir Bey, and for an excursion to the battlefield of Kerreri
(p. 385). - A military band plays twice a week in the afternoon (about
5 p.111.) in the River Avenue.

Irhartiim (1240 ft.), the capital of the Sudan and the residence
of the governor-general, is situated in 150 40' N, lat., on the left
bank of the Blue Nile, immediately above its confluence with the
White Nile (comp. p. xlii). The name ('elephant's trunk') refers to
the shape of the long peninsula that ends on the N.W. in the R33
Khartt1m (p. 388). The town was built in 1823-30 by Mohammed
'Ali, and quickly rose to prosperity as the southernmost depét of
the trade of Egypt, so that it is said to have had 70,000 inhab. in
1882. During the rebellion of the Mahdi (Mohammed Ahmed)
General Gordon, who was despatched hither by the British gov-
ernment to withdraw the garrisons in the Sudan, entered the town in
Feb., 1884, and defended it until Jan. 26th, 1885. The town was
reduced to ruins by the Mphdists; but the work of rebuilding it was
begun in 1898. Most of the houses are of brick, though free use
is also made of Kerreri sandstone, and are surrounded by fine
gardens.

Along the bank of the Nile runs the River Avenue, a promenade
ever 2 M. in length, planted with palms and other trees. At its E.
extremity lies the hamlet ofEurri; and as we proceed thence towards
the W. we pass successively the British Bawacks (Pl. h), a fragment
of the old town-wall (el-Lstaham), the Gordon Memorial College
(Pl. g; see below), and the Hospital (Pl. f). The Gordon Memorial
College, for which Lord Kitchener obtained the necessary funds by
public subscription throughout the British Empire, is a large and
handsome building in which native youths are trained by English
and Egyptian teachers for an official career. The gardens and villas
of the British officials add a picturesque feature to the scene, many
of the houses being built in the verandah cottage style. That farthest
to the E. belongs to Slatin-Pasha. Farther to the W. are military
stores and the workshops of the Water Transport Department; and
tinally a school of forestry. The Palace of' the Sirddrr (P1. b) is built
in the Gothic style; before it stand a British and, a Sudanese sentinel.
Gordon's house, at the portal of which he fell under the lances of
the dervishes, occupied the same site. At the back of it is the
Telegraph Of/hee. In a large square, to the W., rises the Sirdtrtyeh
or Government Building (Pl. a). A little behind are the two Banks
(Pl. d) and the Shops let by government, with the Post Of/iee (P1. i).
In front are a number of villas (including those of the Mudir, the
Adjutant General, and the Financial Director) and a fine garden,
