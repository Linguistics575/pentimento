cxlii HI STORY OF ART.

Ptolemies that attention was once more directed to the S. These
monarchs raised many large temples to the gods of the country
usually on the site of earlier ruined buildings. All these temples
are built on one uniform plan, differing but slightly from the form
prevalent under the New Empire (comp. the plan of the temple at
Edfu with that of the Ramesseum). There is a difference in only
two essential points. The colonnade (or terrace) at the back of the
colonuaded court of the earlier temples has developed into a larger
Vestibule or Great Hypostyle Hall, supported by columns, of which
an example had already occurred in the temple of Luxor. The
columns of the front row are united with each other by means of
Screen Walls or Balustrades (over 6 ft. in height) which separate
the court from this Vestibule Hall, called by the Greeks Pronaos. -
Furthermore the Sanctuary, which formerly had a door at each
end, is now closed at the back and retains only the front entrance.
Between the vestibule and the sanctuary a lesser hypostyle hall and
two smaller halls are placed, an arrangement, however, which also
occurs under the New Empire. The side-rooms are also numerous
at this period and among these special mention must be made of a
small Mrcrifciat Court situated on the right side (see plan of Edfu,
p. 314 ] and an elegant Kiosk adjoining it 6b.), which do not occur
in any of the older templesi.

From a very early period all flat surfaces on pylons, interior
walls, column-shafts, and ceilings were covered with represen-
tations and inscriptions. The external walls, the pylons, and the
walls of the courts, Le. those parts of the temple that were ex-
posed to the vulgar eye, commemorated the exploits of the king,
campaigns, great festivals, or other important events of his reign;
the representations were intended to keep the power and noloility
of the Pharaoh constantly before his people. On the other hand the
representations in the interior of the temple were exclusively
devoted to the religious proceedings that took place there. The
king, who theoretically was the only mortal who might have inter-
course with the gods, appears again and again, offering gifts and
homage to the deities and receiving from them earthly blessings.
In the late period and especially under the Ptolemies the secular
representations on the external walls and the walls of the court gave
place to religious scenes. The variegated battle-scenes of the New
Empire no longer appear on the pylons, but the typical figure of the
Pharaoh smiting his enemies in presence of the god; and 011 the
external walls the battle-scenes and triumphs of the ruler give place
to saerifieial and other sacred scenes depicted at tedious length. -
The temple, moreover, like his house and his tomb, was in the eyes
of the Egyptian a type in small of the world. The roof corresponded

court in the Ptolemaic temples.
