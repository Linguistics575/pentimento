J. S.-E. Quarters. CAIRO. J. Route. 49

3, The floath-1ila, gtern Quarters.

The route described in this section leads via. the Boulevard Méhémet-
Ali to the Citadel, and thence by a wide curve to the S. back to the
boulevard. Electric Tramway to the Place Ruméleh, see p. 25.

Starting from the Place'Atabet el-Khatira (see p. 40), the
SHARI'A MonAMMEn'ALI or Boulevard Méliémet-Ali (P1. C-E, 3-6),
1860 yds. in length, leads to the S.E. straight to the foot of the
citadel. A little more than one-third of the way down the boulevard
we cross the filled-in hed of the 1ib-Khnttg canal; to the left lies
the Place IMI) et-Khatlt, with the Administration Building (0ouvern-
orat; P1. D, 4), containing the Police Headquarters o. 26), and the new
building of the Viceregat Library (p. 56). The Shari'a Bit; el-Khalk
(called farther on Wtotoantyeh, p. 58) leads to the right to the
present library (p. 56). About 1/4 M. farther on, a side-street leads
to the Gt1mra el-Mclekeh Softya (P1. D, 5; entrance by the S. portal),
a Turkish-Arabian mosque of 1611, with a dome supported by
antique columns, and ornamented in the Byzantine-Arabian style.
The pulpit is of marble. A short visit may also be paid to the small
mosque of Et-Eurdtni (Pl. D, 5), built in 1630 and restored in 1885,
lavishly adorned with mosaics, and adjoined by a large and elegant
minaret. - Farther on the boulevard passes the uninteresting and
much altered mosque of Ei-0.rtzttn (Uettn'; Pl. D, 5), and ends
near two large mosques. That on the left is the unfinished tamira
Rifa'iyeh, named after an order of dervishes (p. lxvi), and con-
taining the family burial-vault of the Khedive Isma'il. - On the
right rises the -

**Gkmra Sultan Hasan (Pl. E, (O, the'superb mosque', and the
finest existing monument of Byzantine-Arabian architecture. It was
built in 1356-59 by Sultan Hasan (p. xcvi; tickets of admission
necessary, seep. 30; 1 pias. for the use of shoes). The exterior of this
huge building, which occupies a bush-grown rock below the citadel,
recalls the broad surfaces of the early-Egyptian temples. The massive
**Gateway (P1. I), 85 ft. high, though its scheme of ornamentation
was never fully carried out, has been more or less closely imitated
in the entrances to many other Egyptian mosques .--A11 the fapades
of the mosque are crowned by a unique and boldly projecting cornice,
of'stalaotite' formation and formerly furnished with pinnacles. The
shallow central recess of the N.W. facade displays one large window
and a little ornamentation, while the other recesses are pierced by
windows of unequal size. The outside of the mausoleum is decorated
in the Byzantine-Seljuk style. - The S. Miparet (Pl. 11a) is the high-
ést minaret in Cairo, measuring 270 ft. from the pavement (that of
Et- Ghiirt 213 ft., Kalat'm 193 ft., Muaiyad 167 ft., Et-Azhar 167 ft.,
irtm Bey and Barfmfc 164 ft., Tamara. 132 ft.,'Amr 105 ft/). The
eorrasponding minaret (P1. fits) on the N. facade was overthrown
by an earthquake, but was afterwards rebuilt on a smaller scale.
