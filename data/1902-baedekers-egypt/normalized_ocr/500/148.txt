HISTORY OF ART. cxxxvii

brilliant colours (Fig. NI o. The low square abacus, which under the
New Empire was covered with inscriptions only, was at the same
time developed into a cubical block and somewhat inappropriately
decorated with representations of the gods, figures of Bes, or heads
of Hathor.

Besides those plant-columns other varieties occur. The so-called
Hathor or Sistmm Columns have round shafts crowned on four sides
with the head of the goddess Hathor (with cows' ears), above which
was a temple-like addition. These are exclusively confined to
temples of female deities, and are most numerous in the Ptolemaie
period; they are doubtless reproductions of the sistrum, the peculiar
rattle used by women (p. oxxxiii). The so-called Columns with
inverted Calyx Capitals, occurring in the colonnade of Thutmosis ill.
at Karnak, are quite unique, and are probably imitations of the

shape of the old wooden supports ii.

f) omparatively few of the ancient Egyptian Secular Buildings
have been preserved. The number of ruined towns is not, indeed,
insignificant; but the remains of the earlier houses are almost in-
variably concealed by those of later date and are thus very diffi-
cult to examine. The remains of earlier houses have come down to
us directly in only a few exceptional instances, as at Kahiln o. 180 ]
and Tell el-'Amarna o. 203). These, in connection with repre-
sentations preserved on the monuments, afford us some knowledge
of the structure and interior arrangements of Egyptian PRIVATE
HOUSES, which in many respects were identical with the Arab
houses of modern Egypt (p. olxiv). The house of the humble
farmer or artizan was as simple then as it is to-day. An open court,
in which the family spent the day, was adjoined by a few dark
sleeping-rooms and stables for the cattle, while a staircase led from
the court to the flat roof, upon which a few smaller apartments
were often found. The houses of the more Prosperous Egyptians
also had a court as their central point, at the back of which was a
colonnade or vestibule of light columns, open in front, affording
protection from the sun. Thence a door led to a wide hall, the roof
of which rested on columns, and beyond that was a narrow and larger
hall, also with eolurnns, probably used as the eating-room. Beyond
that again were other apartments (bedrooms) for the master of the
house and his grown-up sons. On one side of the three principal
divisions of the house (court, broad hall, narrow hall) were the
women's apartments, or harim (harem), the middle point of which
was another open court; and on the other side were the slaves' apart-
ments, the store-rooms, the kitchens, and the stables This ar-
rangement of the Egyptian dwelling-house was probably the same
in essential details at all periods, and even in the ROYAL PALACES
(e.g. at Tell er-'Amarna) the three principal divisions occur in the
same order. The walls of the houses and palaces were built of un-
