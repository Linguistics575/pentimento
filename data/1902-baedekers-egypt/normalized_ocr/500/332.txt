HELIOPOLIS. 7. Route. 107

while that of all the others, which percolates through the ground
from the Nile, is usually brackish.

About 3/4 M. beyond the garden are situated the ruins of the
famous ancient Heliopolis, or city of the sun, called On by the
Egyptians. The latter name frequently occurs in the Bible. Thus,
in Genesis (111i, 45), we are informed that Pharaoh gave Joseph'to
wife Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah (Egypt. Petepré, he
whom the sun-god Re has given'), priest of On'.

Heliopolz's-On was one of the most ancient Egyptian cities and was
the chief town of a separate province, included in Lower Egypt. The
deities of the place were the hawk-headed Ité-Harmachis (the sun-god,
whence the Greek name Heliopolis) and the human-headed Atum, who
was incarnated in the sacred Mnevis Bull. To these was dedicated the
famous temple,'the House of RE", built on the site of an earlier edifice
by Amenemhét A, first king of the 12th Dyn., in front of which his 8011
and successor Usertesen f. erected two great obelisks (see below) in cel-
ebration of an important anniversary. A large section of the Egyptian
religious literature was due to the priests of Heliopolis, and their doctrines
were widely disseminated throughout the country at a very early period,
so that Ré-Ha1anaehis was one of the most highly venerated deities in
Egypt. - Even during the Greek period these priests enjoyed a high
reputation for wisdom; Herodotus conversed with them and Plato is said
to have spent thirteen years with them, in order to learn settle at least
of their doctrines. - Under the New Empire the temple of Be1iopo1is
was the largest and most richly endowed in all Egypt, next to the temple
of Ammon at Thebes. - When Strabo (b. about 60 RC.) visited Egypt,
the city had been destroyed, but the temple was still intact, except for some
minor injuries attributed to Cambyses; even the houses of the priests
and the apartments of Plato and his friend Eudoxus were shown to the
traveller. The priestly school, however, had ceased to exist, and only a
few officiating priests and guides for foreigners resided there.

The outer walls are now the only vestiges of the city, while of
the temple nothing is left but a few scanty ruins and the *OBELISK.

The latter, the oldest Egyptian obelisk known, is of red granite
of Syene (Assutu0, and is 66 ft. high; but the ground on which it
stands has been so raised by deposits of mud, that a great part of the
obelisk is now buried. Each of the four sides bears the same in-
scription in bold hieroglyphics; that on the N. side, the only one
entirely legible, records that TJsertesen L, King of Upper and
Lower Egypt, lord of the diadems and son of the sun, whom the
(divine) spirits of On (Heliopolisj love, ete., founded the obelisk
on the first festival of Set (a kind of jubilee celebration). The in-
scriptions on the other three sides are more or less covered by the
cells of wild bees, besides being otherwise damaged. The pyr-
amidium at the top and the hawks which begin the inscriptions on
each side were once covered with metal. The companion obelisk
(for these monuments were always erected in pairs) stood down to
the 12th century.

To the W. of the obelisk the remains of the temple may be recog-
nized in a few blocks of granite, bearing inscriptions by Ramses II. On
one Ramses II. appears offering a libation to Atum. - The necropolis of

Heliopolis, where cofflns and tombstones of a late period have recently
been found, does not repay a visit.
