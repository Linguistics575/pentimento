Inundation. THE NILE. li

it rises again and attains its highest level (comp. p. 69). After
having begun to subside, it generally rises again for a short time,
sometimes regaining and even passing its flrst culminating point.
At length it begins to subside steadily, and after a time the de-
crease becomes more and more rapid. In J anuary, February, and
March the fields from which the water has receded gradually dry
up, and in April, May, and the first few days of J une the river is
at its lowest. When the river is low the water covers 7 ells [ 129/5 ft.)
of the Nilometer at Roda (p. 69); when it reaches 152/3 ells
(273/4 ft.) the inundation has attained the height most favourable
for agriculture at the present day.

Egypt is now no longer a vast lake during the inundation as
it formerly was, nor does the overflow of the fields take place in a
direct manner as is commonly supposed. In Upper Egypt the water
is conducted into a vast network of reservoirs and canals, and dis-
tributed as required, and special engineers are appointed for their
supervision. The whole of the cultivable land is divided into huge
basins (Md), in which the water introduced by the canals is main-
tained at a certain height until it has sufficiently saturated the soil
and deposited the requisite quantity of mud. After the water in the
river has subsided, that in the basins may either be discharged into
the river or into the canals, or it may be used for filling other ba-
sins lying at a lower level. During these operations many of the
villages are connected by means of embaakrnertts only, while others
can only be reached by boat, and the whole country presents a
very peculiar and picturesque appearance. With the help of the
great Barrage (p. 111), the Delta is irrigated all the year round by
means of a network of canals. The principal CANALS in Upper Egypt
are the Sohtrptyeh (iSoahagieli), which quits the river at Sohag (p.191);
the Ihrahimtyeli, which begins below Assifit and ends to the N. of
Benit.su√©f; and the Balm Yusuf, which serves the Fayfim. In Lower
Egypt the chief canals are the MaljmiMtyeh and Khatatbeh, in the
W. Delta; the Bohr Tim, the Balm Shib'z'n, and Es-6httlul, in the
Central Delta; the Teuf.ktyeli, with its continuatious the Man-
Mhfyeh and Bohr "-Sughair, the Balm Bulityeh, the Balir Mu'iss,
and the Jsma" th" yeh Canal, in the E. Delta.

If the river and the system of canals connected with it are in
any way neglected the consequences are very disastrous, as was
notably the case during the latter part of the Byzantine supremacy
aud under the disgraeeful sway of the Mamelukes, when the fertile
soil of Egypt yielded less than one-half of its average produce. The
mean difference between the highest and the lowest Mate of the
river is about 25 ft. at Cairo, 38ft. at Thebes, and 49 ft. at Assuan.
Even in March and April the traveller will have an opportunity of
observing how powerful and rapid the flow of the river still is,
although its fall from Assuan (by the first cataract) to Cairo is
299 ft. only, or about seven inches per mile. The rapidity of the
