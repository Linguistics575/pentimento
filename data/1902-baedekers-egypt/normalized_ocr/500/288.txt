Nile. Towards the left are situated the Christian Cemeteries, sur-
rounded by lofty walls and presenting 110 attractions. The first is the
English and Protestant Cemetery, the second the Roman Catholic,
beyond which are those of the Greeks, Armenians, and. Copts.
(The railway-station of Fum el-Khalig, mentioned at p. 154, lies
to the E.)

To the left of the road, close to the Protestant cemetery and adjoining
the Armenian Church, lies the Dér Mari Ména, 0r convent of St.) Ienas,
a brick-walled enclosure, recognizable by its domed sebil and containing
an ancient church dedicated to the saint Menas .--About 1/2 M. farther on,
near the I.Eelwiin railway-line, is the Dér Abu Sefén, named after the
largest, though not the oldest, church within its precincts. The tall window-
less walls, supported by massive buttresses, lend a highly picturesque air to
the convent, which is best viewed from the S. The convent hes a diameter
of 650 ft., and includes three churches (EVA4t'a, A-nba Blumiida, and Abu
Sefén) and a nunnery (Dér eJ-Bandt). - Among the mounds of debris to the
E. of Old Cairo are several other Coptic convents (Dir Bablzm, Dér Tod-ms,
Alm Kir wa Yeahamm, etc.) which, however, are ofinterest to specialists only.

The HEAD OF THE OLD AQUEDUCT (Arab. El-Nrn/i.iirj, which sup-
plied the citadel with water before the completion of the new water-
works o. 63), rises about 100 yds. beyond the Fum el-Khalig.
It is constructed of solid masonry in a hexagonal form, and has
three stories, about 150 ft. in diameter.

The road continues to follow the direction of the arm of the
Nile, Which, however, is generally concealed by the houses and
walls of the Manjal quarter, and reaches (1 M.) the mansion which
formerly belonged to Sutémc'in Pasha el-Frans/run' (d. 1861; visitors
not admitted) -

The first narrow and short road to the right beyond the ehi-
teau leads to the ferry crossing to the Island of Rtot.1a (6'eeiret Radon).
We descend the slope, enter the ferry-boat (1 pies. for one person,
there and back; payment made on returning), ascend the opposite
path, and turn to the right. A guide is usually easily found to
conduct travellers through the intricate lanes to the garden at the
S. extremity of the island belonging to the heirs of Hascm Pasha.

At the S. end of the garden andisland is the NILOMETER (Miliyts),
constructed in A.D. 716 by order of the Omayyad Khalif S1hhntrn
(715-17). It consists of a square well, 16 ft. in diameter, hav-
ing in the centre an octagonal column, 011 Which are inscribed. the
ancient Arabian measures. The dirty, or oldArabian ell, is 54 centi-
métres, or about 211/3 inches long, and is divided into 21 hirét. The
Cutie inscriptions 011 the central column and on marble slabs built
into the walls refer to restorations of the Nilometer in the 9th cent.
after Christ, under the'Abbaside khalifs Mimiln and Mutawakkil.
Numerous later restorations have also taken place, the lastin 1803.

The office of measuring the water is entrusted to a shékh.

The zero point of the Nilometer (according to NatirniL1-Bey) is 28 ft,
above the average level of the Mediterranean, so that the top of the
column is nearly 59 ft. above sea-level. The water of the Nile, when at
its lowest, covers 7 ells of the Nilometer, and when it reaches a height
of 15 ells and 16 l.ctriit, the shékh of the Nile measurement proclaims the
