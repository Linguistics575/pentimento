below.

The Suez train returns to Nefisheh, and then turns to the S.
(left). On the right we observe a large viceregal nursery for trees.
The train crosses the fresh-water canal, and remains on the W.
bank all the way to Suez. Farther on, to the left, we obtain a fine
view of the bluish-green Bitter Lakes (p. 171). To the right rises
the Gebel Gtmefteh, or Gebet Ahmed Dakar, with its productive
quarries, which yielded material for the construction of the canal.
More in the background are the heights of the Gebel'Uwébid.
116 M. Féyid .--Near (128 M.) G'enef'eh we lose sight of the
Bitter Lakes. 011 the left again stretches a vast sandy plain. On
the right, above the lower hills, tower the dark masses of the
'Atd.ka Mts., the outlines of which stand out very prominently by
evening-light; they are also conspicuous from Suez. Before reach-
ing Shaltd (p. 171 ] we catch a glimpse of the Suez canal.

14. The Suez Canal from Port gaftil to Suez.

The passage of the Suez Canal is interesting only on One of the large
steamers, for from the small steamboats Which ply regularly between hr.
ma'iliya and Port Sartd the passenger cannot see beyond the embankments
of the Canal. The S. part of the Canal, from Ismaftltya to Suez, is the
more interesting. The passage from Port Safid to Suez occupies 15-22 hrs.
The fare by the British steamers is about fu., by the French steamers
100 fr., by the German steamers 44-60 marks; for the tax levied by the
Canal Co. On each traveller, see p. 167.

a. Isthmus, of Suez and History of the Canal.

The Isthmus of Suez, a narrow neck of land which connects
Africa with Asia, is at its narrowest part 70 M. in width. On
