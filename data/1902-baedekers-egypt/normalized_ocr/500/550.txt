snake. Farther to the right gods peep forth from a lake of fire. In the

presenting the hours of the night; these, ili-

to their Ka', 12jaekal-headed daemons, stand-

snakes, upon the'lake of the Ureei'. In the
Lower Panel we see Horus, leaning on his stair,
and 11 gods advancing towards Osiris,'lord of
the western ones' (tie. of the dead). Osiris
(whose figui'e has been destroyed) stands above
a serpent in a recess, in front of which is'n
Urteursnake, Twelve other gods approach the
recess from the other side. Farther on are

men before vaulted oveus (?), watched hy a
god. The beginning of Chapter IV of the,

guarded hy the serpent Teke-hor. On the roof
are two representations of the Egyptian sky.
