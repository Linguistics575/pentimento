and at its base extend the ruins of the ancient Ethiopian city of Napata.
Under the New Empire Napata was the southernmost town under Egyptian
rule and the chief depot of the trade with the SudU. It attained the zenith
ot its Prosperity in the 9th cent. B.C., when it became the capital of an in-
dependent Ethiopian kingdom (p. 351). Taharka and his successors (p. lxxxiv).
res'ded here and built sumptuous temples for Ammon-RE and other deities.
When the royal residence was transferred abnut 600 B.C. to Meroé (p. 384),
Napata began to decline; and although it afterwards became the seat of
the court more than once and though it remained throughout the religious
centre _ot the kingdom, it never regained its former prosperity. The extant
ruins include many pyramids, difhsving from those of Egypt by their
slender form, and several temples, of which those built by Ramses Ii.
and by Taharka are specially noteworthy; but the remains of the city are
on the whole very scanty. Oailliaud explored the site in 1822 and Lepsius
in 18dd. - Opposite Meraui lies the village of Abu Dom; not far oif, in
the desert, is the Wddi Gazdl, with the ruins ofa large Christian convent.
- On the same (left) bank, about 9 ll. above Abu Dom, is at group of
about two dozen pyramids, probably older than those of the Gebel Barkal.
They are built of soft sandstone and are much weatherworn.

About 9 M. to the S.W. of Meraui, and easily reached on donkey-
back, are two groups of pyramids, one at El-Kurru on the right bank of
the Nile, the other at Tangasst' on the left bank. The river is crossed in
a boat made of palm-trunks or (not without danger) on a light raft of
sorghum-stems. - There is another group of about 30 pyramids near
the village of Ziima, on the right bank, about 21/4 N. farther down.

Still farther to the S.W. in the Nile valley, on the left bank about
30 N. from Meraui, lies Tforti, which was General Mrolseley" s headquar-
ters in Dee., ISM, during his unavailing dash to relieve Gordon o. 385).
On the same bank, 60 M. farther to the s., is Abra (htssi, an important
trading-point with the Kubahish Pylt1ins, and the starting-point of a
caravan-route to El-Obéd (p. 390; 14-20 days' journey), 0n the right bank,
5 N. farther down, lies Dongola ez-Agusa ('Old Dongola0, the now deserted
former capital of the province. Thence to New Dongola (p. 382), 75 M.

Beyond Abu liammed the railway descends the valley of the Nile
on the border line between the Atm/ir (steppe) on the E. and the
cultivable belt on the river-bank on the W. The latter is marked
by palm-trees and, lower down, by a bushy undergrowth. Between
Nov. and Jan. the verdant strip reminds one of the bank of the Nile
in Egypt.

9.48 M. Rohatab-Dakhesh is the residence of a mudir, whose
spacious white house is seen at a little distance from the village.
The Robatab and Shékiyeh tribes, together with a few sub-tribes,
constitute the great Arab group of the Monasir, whose territory is
bounded on the N. by that of the Barabra and Bisharin Arabs.
The Monasir preserve a number of ancient legends concerning the
wanderings, feuds, and inter-marriages of their ancestors, and are
exceedingly proud of these'histories of God's people'. In 188/t
Col. Stewart, General Gordon's chief assistant, Rousset, the French
consul, and a Greek were treacherously decoyed to the left bank
and murdered by this people, an atrocity by which Gordon's isolation
was hastened and his ultimate fate sealed.
