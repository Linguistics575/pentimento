FROM WADI HALFA TO NEW DONGOLA, 20d 31.; military railway (two
trains weekly) to (173 M.) Kermeh in 21 hrs.; thence steamer. - The
following are the chief railway-stations. 35 M. Sarms, with a fort built
as a protection against the Mahdists; 50 M. Ambigol; 63 M. Akasheh. -
93 M. Ferkeh. On the Nile here is the rained temple of Aymara, a large
edifice of the late-Ethiopian period. On the island of thu, farther to the
s., are the remains of a temple of Thutmosis III. and AmenoPhis IL, and
a Coptic church; and at Â£01.91) is a well-preserved temple of Amenophis III.
- 130 M. Said Fanti. - 173 M. Kermeh 0r Kerman is situated at the
Third Cataract. In the vicinity are traces of an ancient city and an ex-
tensive necropolis, with Pylon-shaped erections of sun-dried bricks. To
the N. lies the island of Tombis, which marked the S. limit of the Egyptian
power at the beginning of the New Empire. On the island are a few
rock-inscriptions. - From Kermeh a government-steamer plies up the
Nile, passing the island of Argo, to (31 N.) the town of New Dongola, 01-
EZ-Ordeh, situated on the left bank. This thriving town, with 15,000 inhab.
is the capital of the province of DOngola, and the starting-pd" of the
caravan-routes to the oasis of 8elima. - To Old Dongota, see p. 383.

The construction of the railway to Khartiirn was undertaken in
1896-97 in order to support the advance of the Anglo-Egyptian
army; and in spite of the enormous difficulty of laying a railway-
line across the sandy and stony surface of the desert, the work was
so energetically carried on that it advanced almost a mile daily. As
in other parts of Egypt (comp. p. 166) the one essential point was
the provision of an adequate supply of water for the workmen and
the machinery. A series of watering-stations (I-VI) was accordingly
established, at which wells, sunk to a depth of 80 ft., tap the sub-
terranean water, which is found to flow from the S. When the
train stops, the numerous soldier-passengers flock to the houses of
the guardians of the wells. - On the E. rises the bare, violet-
coloured chain of hills, beyond which lies (1'24 M.) Blr Murat
and behind which runs the caravan-route from Eorosko to Abu
Hammett (comp. p. 365). The stony desert gradually gives place
to undulating sand-hills. Isolated dihn-palms, fields of barley,
conical sayal-acacias, and finally a grove of palms announce the
proximity of the Nile.

2fH M. Abu Rammed (baths tor ladies and gentlemen). Behind
the post-sheds and the little house of the British official, we have
a glimpse of the poor village and of the Nile. Crocodiles are some-
times seen sunning themselves on the rocks. The important position
at the bend of the river, which here turns abruptly to the S.W., was
captured from the dervishes in Aug., 1897, by General Hunter, who

had advanced from Dongola.

About 75 M. to the SAY. ofAbu Hammed, and d M.to the N.E. of ert-am',
a village situated beside the Fourth Cataract, is the Gebel Barkal, the
'sacred mountain" of ancient inscriptions. This isolated rocky hill rises
from a plain on the right bank of the Nile, about 11/2 M. from the river,
