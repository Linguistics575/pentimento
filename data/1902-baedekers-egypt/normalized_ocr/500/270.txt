The GROUND FLOOR contains the Oriental MISS. A special feature of
the library, possessed by no other Oriental collection available to Franks,
consists of the MatrtsW, or copies of the Koran, the flnetst of which are
exhibited in cases. They are remarkable' for their large size,. superb
execution, and great age, and constitute the finest existing, Specimens of
Arabian art. The oldest specimens of the Koran, dating from the 3rd- 5th
cent. of the Hegira (10-12th cent. of our era), are in the Cu./te, or early
Arabian, character and are written on parchment. - Most of the'Gi, large
copies of the Koran o ape1 were executed by order of the sultans of the
Bahrite Mamelukes JllJl? jl'li, and of the Circassian Mamelukes (1382- 1517),
while a few of them date from the still later period of the Osman sultans.
Each example is furnished with a label giving its provenienee and date.
One of the most interesting is the copy of'Abd er-2tazzd.k, written by
'Abd er-Rahmdn 17m Abilfail.ti 1n the year 599 of the Hegira, and dedicated to
the mosque of Hosen. To the superseription of each siireh are added both
the number of verses and that of the words and letters it contains, besides
traditional utterances of the Prophet connected with the chapter in ques-
tion, - a most labOrious piece of work, resembling what has been done
by Jewish scholars in preparing copies of the Old Testament. Next in
interest is a Foriin of Sultan Mohammed ea-Ard.sir itnt Btyeddtn K111011211
(1293-1341), written entirely) 111 gilded characters, by Ahmed 111suf, 3. Turk,
in 730 of the Hegira. Several other Korans date from' the reign of Sultdn
Sha'bcm (1363-TO, and from the time" of Khondabavaka, his Potters they
are written on thick and strong paper, and vie with each other in magni-
f1eenee. - The collection contains three Korans of the reign of Sultan 311111111:
(1382- 99), the oldest of which, executed in 769 of the Hegira, measures 111 by
32 inches. It was written with one pen In sixty days by'Abd er-2? alimdn e.s-
$ 111M, the author of a pamphlet, entitled'Sana'at el- K111161311" (the art of
Writing J, and now preserved in this library. This skilful penman was
also employed by Farag (1399-1412), the son of Barkttk. From the year
810 dates a fine copy, written by M12311 ilin Jsmaril et-Kindn1, surnamed
Gagini, for Sultan Sh√©kh el- Mahmirdi Muaiyad (1412-21). - A copy which
once belonged to K1111 Bey (1168- 96), dating from the year 909, is the
largest Koran' 1n the" collection, measuring dd% by 35 inches. To the period
of the Osman sultans belongs the small mushaf of Safiya, mother of
Sultan Mohammad Khan, which dates from 988.111 it a black line alter-
nates with' a gilded one, and the flrst few pages a1e very beautifully exe-
cuted. A copy ofHusen Bey Ohemashm gi is written in a smaller character.
- The library also' boasts of many other valuable Korans from India, Persia,
and Turkey. One of the most beautiful of all was executed in Morocco.

The FIRST LATERAL HALL contains a collection of Persian Miniatures.
The origin and development of this branch of art have not yet been ad-
equately investigated. The specimens here exhibited, most of which were
collected by the late Mustafa Fadil Pasha, hrother of Isnnaril Pasha, and
were afterwards purchased by the Egyptian government, have all been
produced under Mohammedan influences, though evidences of E. Asiatic
taste are abundant. These irioiirifiGiii'it'io" ii" s' are distinguished from the
purely ornamental art of the Korans in the lower hall by a greater free-
dom of conception and variety of motive, particularly by the frequent em-
ployment of living forms. Nearly all are illustrations of poetical or his-
torical Torts The chronological arrangement shows that this art was at
its best in the 14-17th cent., and that thereafter a rapid decline set in.
The finest miniatures are shown in the cases in the middle of the room.
