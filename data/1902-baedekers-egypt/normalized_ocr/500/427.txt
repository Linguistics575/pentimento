through the same cana1 (i.e. the Bahr Yt1s11f), both It and the canal retain
water enough for purposes of irrigation. At both ends of the canal there
are look-gates by means of which the engineers can regulate the influx
and efflux of the water.' The method by which the distribution of the
excess water was accomplished is unknown. Near the modern ebLahfm
there is a lock to this day. - The statement of Herodotus that Lake Maui,
was an artifieia1 construction thus rests upon an error and is moreover
in direct contradiction to Strabo's account, which expressly mentions
that in its size and colour the lake resembled the sea and that its banks
looked like the sea-shore. For the pyramid and statues mentioned by
Herodotus as standing in the lake, see p. 179.

The Fayfun forms a separate province. The Inhabitants are fellah'in,
or tillers of the soil, and Beduins. To the latter race belong the poor
fishermen who inhabit the banks of the Birket liariin.

From Cairo to el- Wasta (57 M.), see R. 17. Travellers coming
from Cairo ohan ge carriages here and have a considerable time to wait. "

The braneh-line to the Fayt1m runs towards the W., across
cultivated land, to the village of Abu Rddi, beyond Which it tra-
verses a desert tract, and crosses the low and bleak Libyan chain
of hills, reaching its highest point at a level of 190 ft. above the
sea. At (15 M.) Siala (6fila) the Pyramid of el-Lahirn (p. 180) is
visible on the horizon to the left. We cross first the Bohr Fsla,
which flows towards the Baht Yt1sut from the N., and then the
Bohr Tamiyeh (p. 178 ]. - Near the station of (181/2 M.) Edwa
(Adweh; 69 ft.) isa cemetery with the dilapidated tombs of several
shékhs. Numerous palm-branohes are placed by the tombstones as
tokens of affection. We pass the station of et-Mashlh and traverse
rich arable land.

Medtnet el-Fayttm, usually known as El-j1fedheli, is the chief
town of the province of Faytun and contains about 31,000 inhah.
(including many Greeks). The Bohr Ytuul' (p. 175) flows through
the town, its running water forming a feature quite unusual in
Ttlgyptiarrtowns. The very long covered bazaar contains nothing of
special interest. The dilapidated mosque of Ji/fit Bey, built on a
bridge over the Bahr Yt1sut, contains numerous antique columns,
brought from the ancient Arsinoii, some of Which have shafts of
polished marble with Arabic inscriptions, and Corinthian and other
capitals. Below the mosque, on the bank of the Bahr Yt1sut, are
some remains of ancient masonry. At the W. end of the town the
Bahr Yt1suf radiates into numerous branches. The dilapidated
mosque of "situated here forms a picturesque foreground.

To the N. of the town are the extensive rubbish-mounds, known
to the inhabitants as Etm6n Paris, or'riders' hills', covering an
area of about 1/2 acre and rising to the height of 65 ft. These mark
the site of Crocodilopolis-Arsinoé.

The ancient Egyptian name of this town was Shetet. It was the centre

of the worship of the crooodile-headed water-god Sobk (the Greek Suchos),
under whose protectiOn the entire lake-land stood. The crocodile was
