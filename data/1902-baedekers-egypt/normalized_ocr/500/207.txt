mouths. The lighthouse (17:3 ft. high) and the masts of the ships
in port then come in sight and finally the huge breakwaters of the
harbour. The entrance, marked by buoys, is 1/2 M. wide, but the
actual channel between the moles is only loo-ity) yds. in width.

on to Isma'iliya is not examined until that port is reached.
