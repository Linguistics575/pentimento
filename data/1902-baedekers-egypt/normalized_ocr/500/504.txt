LUXOR. N. Route. 233

Below Nahadeh the Nile makes a bend, beginning at ed-Uhmftle
(W. bank). - Rhisdm (E. bank; rail. station, p. 192 ] has a necro-
polis of the 11th Dynasty. - 32 M. (W. bank) Kam1Ueh.

On the left bank, as we draw near Thebes, rise high limestone
hills, presenting precipitous sides to the river, from whieh, however,
they are separated by a strip of fertile land. The right bank is flatter,
and the Arabian hills retreat farther into the distance. Before
reaching the point where the W. chain projects a long curved mass
of rock towards the river, we see to the left first the great obelisk,
then the py1os1s of the temple of Karnak, half-eoneealed by palm-
trees. When we clear the abrupt profile of the W. cliffs and new
formations are visible at its foot, we may catch a distant view of
Luxor towards the S.E. None of the buildings on the W. bank are
visible until the steamer has ascended as high as Karnak; then flrst; the
Golossi of Memnon and afterwards the Ramesseum and the Temple
of Dér el-baltri come into view. As we gradually approach Luxor,
we distinguish the flags flying above the consular dwellings. The
eastellated villa of a Dutch resident is conspicuous in the back-.
ground. In a few minutes more the steamer halts, close to the
eolonnades of the temple. - 39 M. Luster (see below).
