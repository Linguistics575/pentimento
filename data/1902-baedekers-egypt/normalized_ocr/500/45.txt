xxxiv THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. Origin.

is maintained only by means of reinforcements from abroad. Another
proof of the transforming influemses of the Egyptian climate IS
afforded by the uniform character of the domestic animals. The
oxen, in particular (which, however, are gradually being replaced
by the buffalo), though they have often been repeatedly extermillated
in a single century by murrain, and have been succeeded by foreign
races from every quarter of the globe, invariably after a few genera-
tions assume the well-known Egyptian type with which the re-
presentations on the ancient temples render us so familiar.

There have been many hypotheses as to the origin of the Egyp-
tians. In all probability the rise and development of that people
followed essentially the same course as those of other great races,
whose geographical positions exposed them to a similar variety of
external ir1fluenees. In the course of its history this people attained
a characteristic development of its own; but we have to enquire as
to the nature of the original prehistoric stock. In classical antiquity
the Egyptians were considered to be of African origin, and Diodorus
has given expression to this view by quoting a tradition of the
Ethiopians, according to which the Egyptians were originally an
Ethiopian colony, just as their country itself is aproduct of the
Nile. But the Greeks and Romans knew little of Central Africa,
and, more eSpecially, they were acquainted with none of the peoples
of the Nile district except those whom we now distinguish as Hami-
tie. When these peoples began to find their way from Asia across
the Red Sea into Africa, they no doubt pushed down the Nile, after
subduing the primeval inhabitants of the river-valley. The Ethio-
pian tradition thus agrees with the Biblical, which describes Ham
as the father of Mizraim and Cush - names under which the ancient
Hebrews used to personify Egypt and Ethiopia. But since the days
of Lepsius (1810-84) the term Hamites or Hamitic races has been
used to distinguish that great ethnographic group of peoples which
has, in the course of ages, altered the population of half Africa,
ever pressing from E. to W., in a course as determined as that of
the heavenly bodies, and driving out the primeval population before
them. The final stages of this migration, which, like those of the
horse and came ], falls partly within the historic period, were reached
when the Hamites came in contact with the Semitic races.

The civilization and culture of the Egyptians have been suc-
cessively affected by every race that has played a prominent part
in W. Asia, from the ancient Babylonians to the modern Arabs and
Turks. Maspero argues for a gradual infiltration from Libya also
in the earlier epochs. But the Libyans were themselves Hamitic,
no less than the Ethiopians who overtook them in their advance
westwards. Recent philologists [ such as Reinisch) classify the Ha-
mites from their linguistic characteristics as the prototype of the
Semitic family, distinguished by more elementary, more primitive
forms. It is universally assumed that both Hamites and Semites
