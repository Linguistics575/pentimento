HISTORY.

the trade of Egypt was terribly depressed by high taxes
and by the accompanying debasement of the coinage. At
the instigation of the Venetians Kansuweh el-% tari
equipped a fleet for service against the Portuguese in In-
dia, and with it in 1508 he gained a naval victory over
Lorenzo, son of the Viceroy Francisco d'Almeida, near
Shawl in Beluehistan; but the following year his fleet was
compelled to retreat to Arabia. Ill-Olds" fell, while fight-
ing against the army of the Osman sultan Selim I. on the
plain of Dabik (to the N. of Aleppo).

Tihrutn Bey o. 48) was dethroned by the Osman Sultan
Selim I. of Constantinople (pp. 33, 106). Cairo was taken
by storm. Egypt theneeforth became a Turkish Pashalic.
Selim compelled Mutawakkil, the last scion of the family
of the'Abbaside khalifs, who had resided at Cairo in ob-
seqrity since the time of Bibars, to convey to him his
nominal supremacy, and thus claimed a legal title to the
off1ee of Khalif, the spiritual and temporal sovereign of
all the professors of El-Is1tm.'

III. MODERN HISTORY,

Turkish Domination after 1517.

The authority of the Osman sultans soon declined, and with
it that of their governors. The Egyptian pashas were now
obliged, before passing any new measure, to obtain the
consent of the 24 Mameluke Beys (or princes) who gover-
ned the different provinces. These beys collected the
taxes, commanded the militia, and merely paid tribute to
the Pasha.

'Ali Bey, originally a slave, raised himself to the dignity
of an independent sultan of Egypt. He conquered Syria,
but died on the point of returning to Egypt, where his
son-in-law Abu Dabad had seized the throne. After Da-
bad's death the beys -

Jfurdd and Ibrahim shared the supremacy, and rendered
themselves almost independent of Turkey.

The French Occupation.
Napoleon Bonaparte (pp. 19, 33, 165) arrived at Alexau-
dria, hoping to destroy the British trade in the Mediter-

. l The Turkish Khalifs, however, have never been recognised by the
Sh1'1tes, as not being descended from'Ali. Most of the Sunnites also,
especially among the learned Arabs, regard them merely as temporal mon-

archs.

Relying on an ancient tradition, they maintain that none but de-

scendants of the Itoreishites, the family to Which Mohammed belonged,
can attain the offree of Imam, or spiritual superior. They accordingly re;
gard the great Sherif of Mecca as their true Imam.
