HISTORY OF ART. 011

in the representations of the crowds of warriors in these battle
reliefs, while the actual combats are frequently mere confused
assemblages of standing and recumbent figures of men and animals,
but all the same we cannot withhold admiration from the keen fae-
ulty of observation displayed by the artists. And perhaps a good
deal of the apparent confusion would disappear if we could see the
reliefs with all their original colouring. - In the SA'iTE PERIOD the
works of the Ancient Empire were again selected as models for sinllp-
tures in this branch of the plastic art, though no attempt was made
to rival the ancient masters with actual cepies. But all the same
the reliefs of this period offer a pleasing contrast to the rude produe-
tions of the reign of Ramses IL, in their delicate and exact "tyell-
tion, and in a certain elegance and a charming softness of form.
Art under the PTOLEMIES was at first content to follow in the track
of the Saite artists; but it gradually grew more and more crude,
and the temple-walls were overladen with rows of tasteless reliefs.
The figures of men and gods in these became heavy and shapeless,
so that their features and limbs have a swollen appearance. Unfor-
tunately the reliefs of this late period of Egyptian art are the most
numerous and most conspicuous in Upper Egypt, and thus it is that
the traveller is inclined to assign to Egyptian sculpture a much
lower rank than even its mediocre productions deserve.

In the practice of the Artistic Handicrafts Egypt was perfect,
The goldsmiths and workers in metal in particular had attained the
most complete mastery of their craft; they thoroughly understood
all its ancillary arts, such as enamelling and Damascene work, and
they were thus able to produce works of a degree of finish such as
a highly civilised nation alone could execute and appreciate.

The traveller should note the signifieation of some of the SYM-.
BOLS and SIGNS most commonly used in the ornamentation of the

columns and other parts of the Egyptian temples. Thus, is the
