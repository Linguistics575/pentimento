The narrow cultivable strip is tilled by peasants of a distinctly darker
complexion than the felléthin of the Thebeid. Both land and people
approach gradually nearer to the Nubian type.

On the E. bank lies A (cm. - At the village of Miniha (E. bank)
we enter the E. branch of the stream, which here forms the island
of ilfan: sttrfyelt, with a. village of the same name.

On a hill on the E. bank and conspieuous from a considerable
distance appear the ruins of the beautiful temple of Kom Ombo,
especially picturesque by the light of the full moon. The islands
opposite the E. bank were, perhaps, in former times united with the
mainland, or separated from it only by a narrow channel; but in the
course of centuries the Nile has gradually extended its channel
farther and farther to the E. 5 and during the 19th cent. alone abont
20 ft. have been washed away from the E. bank, along with a large
portion of the building. An embankment has been constructed to
prevent farther mischief.

42 M. Kern Ombo, the'Hill of Ombos', lis about 50 ft. above
the average surface-level of the Nile. The ancient Egyptian city
of Ombos probably owes its foundation to the strategic importance of
its site, upon a hill commanding both the Nile and the routes from
Nubia to the Nile valley. Yet the town attained no great prosperity
until the Ptolemaic era, when it was converted from an ordinary
provincial town into the capital of the separate nome of Ombites.
It was at this era that the mighty temples were built, which excite
our admiration to-day; the earlier sanctuaries have left scarcely a
trace. Not content like other towns with one local deity, Ombos
possessed two chief gods - the crocodile-headed Sobk (Sukhos)
and the hawk-headed Haroéris. With the former were specially
associated Hathor and the youthful moon-god Khons-Hor; with
the latter, the'Good Sister' (T-sent-no/ret, a special form of Ha-
thor) and the'Lord of Both Lands' (P-meh-teu/é). The ruins of the
town, now buried in sand, lie in the N.E. corner of the plateau.
In 1893 all the temple-buiHiltgs in the S. part of the plateau were
cleared of rubbish and restored under the directions of De Morgan.
A marble tablet on the right door to the great hypostyle hall (p. 325)
commemorates the fact. At the W. angle of the plateau is a dis-
mantled British fort.

From the landing-place, to the S. of the hill, a road skirts the
river-bank to a modern flight of steps, which ascends direct to the
principal entrance. Tickets of admission should not be forgotten.

The temple-precincts were enclosed by a brick girdle-wall. The
entrance is formed by a massive Pylon, erected by Ptolemy Neos
Dionysos. Only the right (E.) half is now standing, the other has
sunk in the river. The reliefs show Neos Dionysos presenting various
offerings to the gods of Ombos. We now betake ourselves to the -

*Great Temple of Sobk and Baroéris. This temple was built on
a uniform plan in the Ptolemaic perior1, and embellished with re-
