Polo, Cricket, and Tennis Grounds (W.).

A Footpath leads directly from the end of the bridge among pahn-trees
by the side of the Nile, affording views of the trtyffie on the river and
on the BC1liilr bank. Refreshments (milk, etc.) may be obtained at the
Café Bellevue, etc.

The principal building on the island is the former viceregal
chateau, which was purchased in 1893, along with the adjacent
buildings and the park, by a limited company and has been opened
as the Ghezireh Palace Hotel, (see p. 24). The chateau was erected
by Franz Pasha (p. (W), a German architect, in 1863- (18, and taste-
fully ornamented with Moorish stueeo-work by C. van Diebitsch.
Few remains of its former magnifieenee in the interior are now left.

Below B1llgli and the island the Nile is spanned by the Railway

the Railway Stations (Pl. B, A, 1; p. 24), lead straight N. to the
(21/2 M.) vi11age and palace of Shubra, on the Nile. To the right, a
