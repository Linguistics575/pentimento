lxxii DOCTRINES OF EL-ISLAM.

festivals some of them fall into a kind of epileptic eonvnlsion, and foam
at the mouth; but no notice is taken of them, and they are left to re-
cover without assistance. - The zikrs of the dancing dervishes which
formerly took place in the Tekkiyeh el-Molawiyeh, to the S.W. of the Place
Sultan Hasan (Pl. D, 6), are now discontinued.

The WORSHIP OI? SAINTS AND MARTYRS was ineuleated in con-
nection with El-Islam at an early period. The faithful undertook
pilgrimages to the graves of the departed in the belief that death
did not interrupt the possibility of communication with them.
Thus the tomb of Mohammed at Medina, and that of his grandson
Hosén at Kerbela, became particularly famous, and every little
town soon boasted of the tomb of its particular saint. In many of
the villages the traveller will observe small dome-covered build-
ings with grated windows. These are saints' tombs and are called
Hilhtslthst (comp. p. Clxiii).'Shékh' also means a chief or old man.
Shreds of cloth are often seen suspended fromthe gratings of these
tombs, or on certain trees which are considered sacred, having
been placed there by devout persons. About the end of the 18th
century a reaction against the abuses of El-Islam sprang up in
Central Arabia. The WAHHABITEs, or Wahhabees, named after
their founder'Abd el-Wahhab, endeavoured to restore the religion
to its original purity; they destroyed all tombs of saints, including
even those of Mol.1ammed and Hosén, as objects of superstitious
reverence, and sought to restore the primitive simplicity of the
Prophet's code of morals; they even forbade smoking as being in-
toxicating. They soon became a great political power, and had not
Mohammed'Ali deemed it his interest to suppress them, their in-
fluence would have been far more widely extended than it now is.

We have l1itl1erto spoken of the doctrines of the Sunnites (from
sunna,'tradition0, who form one great sect of El-Islam. At all early
period the SHi'ITEs (from shta,'sect') seceded from the Sunnites.
They assigned to rAli, the son-in-law of Mohammed, a rank equal
or even superior to that of the prophet himself; they regarded him
as an incarnation of the Deity, and believed in the divine mission
of the imams descended from him. El-Mahdi, the last of these, is
believed by them not to have died, but to be awaiting in conceal-
ment the coming of the last day. The Persians are all Shi'ites. To-.
wards the West also Shi'itism was widely disseminated at an early
period, particularly in Egypt under the régime of the Fitimite
sovereigns. The Shi'ites are extremely fanatical, refusing even to
eat in the society of persons of a different creed. As to the other
sects, ehiefly eontined to Syria [ Metdwileh, Ismatut1ph, Nosairt" yeh,
Druses, eta), see Baedeker's Syria and Palestine.
