The hills on the two banks of the river approach so close together
here that they have justly been compared to the pillars of a gigantic
gateway. In very ancient times there were probably rapids at this

historical value in honour of kings and high officials. In front are
five doorways, separated from each other by pillars (P1. a-d) at vary-
