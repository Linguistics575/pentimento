Tanya, the thriving capital of the province of Gharbtyeh,
which lies between the Rosetta and Damietta arms of the Nile,
with a population estimated at 57,000, possesses large public build-

obtained through the eonsu1ar agent (fee 1-2 fr.).

The catafalque of the saint is covered with red velvet adorned
with embroidery, and is enclosed by a handsome bronze railing. The
dome is still 11nfinished. One large and two small schools are con-
