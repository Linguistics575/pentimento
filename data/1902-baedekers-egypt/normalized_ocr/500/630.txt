Elephuniine, ASSURE. 29. Route. 331

By far the most interesting object on the island is the *Nilo-
meter, beside a stldyeh on the E. side facing Assutn, known to
the Arabs as Miltyt'ts. After more than a thousand years of neglect
it Was repaired and restored to use in 1870 in the reign of the
Khedive Isma'il, as is recorded by French and Arabic inscriptions.
At the top of the staircase is an inscribed block of granite. 011 the
walls of the staircase are damaged Greek inscriptions of the im-.
perial epoch, giving the water-levels. The scales date from the
later imperial epoch, and the ells are marked in Creek (and also in
Demotic) characters. The new scale is inscribed on marble tablets.
---. Strabo's accurate description of this nilometer is not yet anti-
quated: -

'The Nilometer is a well built of regular hewn stones, on the bank
of the Nile, in which is recorded the rise of the stream, not only the
maximum but also the minimum and average rise, for the water in the
well rises and falls with the stream. On the side of the well are marks,
measuring the height sufficient for the irrigation and the other water-
levels. These are observed and published for general information....
This is of importance to the peasants for the management of the water,
the embankments, the canals, etc., and to the officials on account of the
taxes. For the higher the rise of water, the higher are the taxes'.

Farther to the S., opposite the Cataract Hotel, lies a massive
Ancient Structure. Many of the blocks used were taken from earlier
edifietys and are covered with inscriptions of different dates. The
roek-inseriptions close to the stream should also be noticed.

The entire S. part of the island is covered with great mounds
of rubbish formed by the ruins of the Ancient Town of 1illephantine,
Among some brick walls a few paces to the W. of the quay we may
distinguish the foundations of a small temple, constructed with
stones brought from earlier edifices, including the drums of columns
and blocks with the cartouches of Thutmosis m., Ramses III., and
other monarchs. From the solitary stump of a column now stand-
ing we learn that Trajan was the builder. Close by is the top of a
Greek altar in red granite, with the inscription,'To the great god
Ammon'. About 50paces to the E. a granite portal, once the entrance
to some large temple, dominates all this part of the island. The
reliefs upon it show Alexander, the son of Alexander the Great
(comp. p. lxxxvii), sacrificing to the ram-headed Khnum and other
deities of Elephantine. Inscribed blocks and sculptured fragments
lie around in all directions. Various other buildings, seen and de-.
scribed by the savants of the French Expedition, were pulled down
about the beginning of the 19th century. Among these were temples
built by Ameuophis III. and Thutmosis III.

The higher parts of the island, especially a granite promontory
on the W. bank, command a fine *View of the black and brown,

rough and smooth rocks of the cataract, among which the Nile flows.

A row round the island is recommended (1/2 hr.). - The islet of
ihrdinarti or Sirdat% Island, between Elephantine and the W. bank of
the Nile, belongs to Lord Kitchener.
