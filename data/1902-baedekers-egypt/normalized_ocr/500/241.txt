28 Route d, CAIRO. Physicians.

animals are to be found in great numbers at all the most frequented points;
at night in front of the cafes; and the stranger who wishes to hire a
donkey is sometimes well-nigh overwhelmed by the charge of light cavalry
to meet his wishes. The donkey-boys of Cairo (preferable to older drivers)
often possess a considerable fund of humour, and their good spirits react
upon their donkeys. The traveller should sternly repress the first symp-
tom of the usual cruel goading of the animals to quicken their pace.
Galloping is forbidden within the town. The balgshish should be proper-
tionate to the quality of the donkey and the behaviour of the donkey-boy.

Dragomens (comp. p. xxii). Only travellers who are pressed for time
require a Cicerone. The best (5-8 fr. per day) are to be had at the hotels,
where also a list of the guides licensed by the police may be seen. If,
however, the traveller knows a few words of Arabic, and is not in a
hurry, he will soon find his way through every part of the city and the
environs with the aid of his donkey-boy alone.

Cycles may be hired from Marina d. Co., Shgriea Kaer en-Ni ] (Rond-
Point Snares).
