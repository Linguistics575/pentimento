Roman imperial period, was never completed, Above the floral Cap-
itals of the columns it was intended to add Ifathor-eapitals. Only
the end-walls are smoothed on the outside, the side-walls were left
rough-hewn. Within, two of the screen-walls between the columns
are embellished with reliefs: Trajan offering wine to Isis and to the
hawk-headed Horus, and Trajan before Osiris and Isis. The re-

The rocky island of Bigeh (Eg ypt. Senmet), the goddess of which
was Hathor, is the most interesting of the Cataract Islands near
Phila. It is easily reached by small boat in a few minutes from
Phila, of which it commands a picturesque view. We land at
the ancient quay and ascend by an ancient staircase. In front of us
lie the remains of a Ptolemaic temple (Neos Dionysos), of which
part of the hypostyle hall is still standing, with its plant-columns
united by se, ree1t-walls. On thall, side is a door, into which an apse
has been built. The rains are now occupied by a Nubian hamlet.
Behind the temple (to the W.) is a headless seated statue of Am-
enophis II., and beside the temple is the fragment of a seated figure
of Thutmosis 111. There are numerous inscriptions on the island.

The island off the N. end of Phila, now called Konosso, was
formerly the S. limit of Egypt [ see p. 350). It contains numerous
rock-inscriptions, some dating as far back as the Middle Empire.
On a massive double rock the c-artouches of Psammetikh II. are
conspicuous.
