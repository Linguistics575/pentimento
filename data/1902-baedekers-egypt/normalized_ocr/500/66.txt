AUHIUULTURE. lv

valley of the Nile requires less careful tilling and ploughing than
ours. As the dung of the domestic animals is used as fuel through-
out Egypt, where wood is very scarce, that of pigeons is almost
the only kind available for agricultural purposes. An abundant
source of manure is afforded by the ruins of ancient towns, which
were once built of unbaked clay, but now consist of mounds of earth,
recognisable only as masses of ruins by the fragments of pottery they
contain. Out of these mounds, which conceal the rubbish of thou-
sands of years, is dug a kind of earth, known as Sebhtskh, sometimes
containing as much as 12 per Bent of saltpetre, soda, ammonia, and
other salts.

II. IRRIGATION. The whole of the cultivable soil of Egypt is
divided into two classes in accordance with its relative height
above the surface of the Nile: (1) The'Rai', or fields which retain
their moisture after the subsidence of the overflow long enough (or
nearly long enough) to admit of the ripening of the crop without
additional irrigation; (2) The'iSliarttl.ti', or those which always
require artifi0ial irrigation. The irrigation is effected by means of:
(1) The'Siuiiveh', or large wheels (rarely exceeding 30 ft. in dia-
meter), turned by cattle or bufia1oes, and sometimes by camels or
asses, and fitted with scoops of wood or clay, resembling a dredg-
ing-machine. (P) The'8hddof', an apparatus resembling that of
an ordinary well, set in motion by one person only, and drawing the
water in buckets resembling baskets in appearance; as a substitute
for the sahiyeh several sl1idilfs are sometimes arranged one above
the other. (3) When it is possible to store the water in reservoirs
above the level of the land to be watered, it is allowed to overflow
the fields whenever required. This is the only method available in
the oases, where fortunately the water rises from the springs with
such force as to admit of its being easily dammed up at a suffi-
ciently high level. (A) Pumps driven by steam are also used, par-
ticularly when a large supply of water is required, as in the case
of the sugarplantations on the'Gefs' of the Nile in Northern Egypt,
where they are seen in great numbers. (5) The'Tdbdt', a peculiar,
very light, and easily moved wooden wheel, which raises the water
by means of numerous fans, is used in the Lower Delta only and
in places where the level of the water in the canals remains nearly
the same. Archimedean screws also are found in the Delta, and in
the Ii'ayt1m there are water-wheels of peculiar construction, so con-
trived as to be turned by the weight of the water. Occasionally
irrigation is effected by means of a basket slung on a rope between
two labourers. In order to distribute the water equally over flat
fields, they are sometimes divided into a number of small squares
by means of embankments of earth, 1 ft. in height, which, owing to
the great plasticity of the Nile mud, are easily opened or closed. so
as to regulate the height of the water within them. The agrarian
measures of the Egyptian government are all directed towards the
