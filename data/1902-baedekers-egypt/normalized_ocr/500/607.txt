may Mill be noticed. The Rear Wall is much damaged; to .the Tight we
see the deceased and his wife at table, to the left, the relatives in rows.

The tomb of Renni, nomareh and high-priest, still farther to
the left (W.), contains representations resembling those in the

tomb of Paheri (p. 313), but not so skilfully executed.

On the Left Wall are harvest-scenes', the deceased and his wife at
table, with their relatives seated opposite. On the Right Wall, the funeral
and accompanying ceremonies. In the Rear Wall is a recess wilh a seated
statue of the deceased, now quite destroyed.

The last three tombs farther to the left (W.) appear to date from
a period before the New Empire.

One of these belongs to a man and his wife AH-NOFRU a lady attached
to the royal harem. Another- (With a vaulted ceiling) elonged to BEBI
and his wife Sehek-nakht, who also was a lady of the harem. The third
consists of a vaulted chamber with a. tastefully adorned ceiling and a room
with the shaft. It dates from the reign of Sehek-hotep II. (18th Dyn.).

A little to the W. of the hill of tombs stood a small Temple of'
Thutmosis III., now destroyed.

On the W. bank opposite el-Rib, about 1/2 M. from the river,
lies the village of Muissat (Mo'isdt), and farther on, about 3 M. from

Kom el-Alynar ('Red Hill'), with the ruins and tombs of Hiera-
konpolis.

meralronpo1is (Egypt. Nekhen) was one of the most ancient cities in
the country and perhaps originally the capital of Upper Egypt. Its god was
a Horus, to whom the sparrow-hawk was sacred, whence arose, the Greek
name Hierakonpolis ('eity of hawks) A little to the N., beyond a broad
desert route, is a second mass of ruins, amongst which is a large Fort, with
a lower outer wall and a high inner wall of unburnt bricks. On the E.
side is a sally-port. In the adjoining cultivated land lay the Temple of
Nekhen, in which Quibell discovered in 1897-98 some important sculptures
of the earliest period, besides others of later date, including the bronze
group of Pepi I. and his son (p. 85) and a fine bronze hawk. - To the
W. are a few rock-tomhs of the Early and Middle Empires, one without
inscriptions and two with designs and inscriptions upon stucco. - About
1/4 hr. farther to the W., also on the hill of K6111 el-Ahmar, are eight rock-
tombs, dating from the beginning of the New Empire, of Which only the
first to the right or N. (2'houti, of the time of Thutmosis I.) and the first
tc the left or S. (Harmosé, high-priest of Nekhen) repay a visit. The
structure of these tombs resembles that of the tombs at el-Eiib. At the
inner end of each is a recess with a statue of the deceased and his wife.
In the tomb of HermosE dancing-girls are painted upon stucco.
