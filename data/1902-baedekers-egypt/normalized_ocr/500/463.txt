of the king. The *Tombs of el-'Amarna contain the best examples
of this realistic tendency and are, therefore, of great importance in
the history of art.

About 11/2 M. to the N. of the landing-place at IJagg-lfam1il
are the ruins of the city. The position of the PALACE or AMEN-
OPHIS IV. is indicated by a house (known to the Arabs as el-lrenheh)
erected by Prof. Flinders Petrie to protect the sumptuously painted
*Stucco Pavements, which he discovered in the course of his ex-.
cavations in 1691-92. There are four pavements, two in each room
of the protective house. The fgt Pavement (in the first room),
which originally decorated a hall of the harem borne by twelye
columns, is divided into two sections by a -1 -shaped band of cap-
tive Asiatics and negroes and bows (emblematic of the so-called
'nine nations of archers', the hereditary foes of Egypt ], which the
king thus trod under foot as he passed through the hall. In the
centre of each section is a rectangular pond with water-plants and
fishes, surrounded by a thicket of marsli-plants, representing the
banks of the pond, enlivened with birds and animals. This thicket
was interrupted by the columns, the traces of which are quite
distinct. The entire pavement was surrounded with a border of
painted vases and bouquets of flowers. - The 2nd Pavement, in
the same room, is in poor preservation, though ornamental vases
and bouquets may be distinguished. - The *3rd Pavement (in the
second room) is the finest. It also is divided into two symmetrical
halves by a central band of bows and captives. On each side, in
the centre, is a pond surrounded by a border of marsh-plants and
animals (interrupted by the columns), while at the sides (beyond
the columns) is a second similar border. The whole pavement,
like No. 1, is surrounded with a border of vases and nosegays. The
calves frisking in the marshy thicket are admirably drawn and
highly lifelike in their movements. The hall to which this pave-
ment belonged had sixteen columns, the bases of three of which
are Mill in position. - The dth Pavement resembles the others in
arrangement but is in inferior preservation.

The second room of this house contains also a few architectural frag-
ments found among the ruins of the palace, including a portion of a
palm-column; three fine alabaster reliefs'en creux" of captives; a fragment
of a relief of the king worshipping the sun, etc.

To the S. of the protective house are remains of large colonnades
belonging to the palace. - To the E. lay the Library, in which the
celebrated. tablets of Tell el-'Arnarna with cuneiform inscriptions
(p. 94) were found.

To the N.E. was the Great Temple, now almost completely
ruined; the square brick pillars of one of the large halls may still
be clearly seen.

The N. Group of Tombs lies about 11/2 M. to the N.E. of the
palace.
