ARRIVAL AT ALEXANDRIA (comp. Map, p. 18 ]. The perfectly
flat NE. coast of Egypt, and even Alexandria itself, are not visible
to the steamboat-passenger until very shortly before the vessel enters
the harbour. We first observe the lighthouse. The steamer takes a
pilot on board and is steered by him through a narrow, shallow, and
rocky channel (Béghaz) into the harbour. As the passage can only
be effected by daylight, vessels arriving in the evening must ride at
anchor outside until next morning. To the left, on the Rh et-TM
('Cape of Figs'), are the vieeroy's palace and the arsenal. Most of
the steamers lie alongside the quays.

As soon as the brief sanitary inspection is over, the porters and
commissionnaires swarm wildly on deck, vociferati11gin half-a-dozen
different languages, and with animated gestieulations precipitate
themselves Upon the travellers' luggage. The best plan, especial-
ly when ladies are of the party, is to secure the services of one of
Cook), "Gase's agents, who relieves the traveller of all trouble,
assists in clearing luggage at the eustom-house, and conducts the
travellers to the special omnibuses for the hotels or railway-station.
These agents are recognizable by the oftieial caps, while the Arabs
in the service of these firms bear large brass plates on their breasts.
A sum of 15-20 pias. generally covers the total expenses of landing,
etc., but a great deal of trouble is saved by procuring a landing
ticket before leaving home. - The Custom House Examination,
which takes place on shore, resembles the process in Europe.
