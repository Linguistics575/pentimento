the shaft and the abacus, are the only evidence of any effort towards
originality in this direction.

The most prominent characteristic peculiarities of Arabian arehi-
tecture are the following: -

1. The introduction of the pointed arch as the dominating
aesthetic characteristic (Mosque of Ibn Tou) and the employment
of the Byzantine stilted round areh, as well as of the round and
pointed horseshoe arch, the scalloped arch, the elover-leaf arch, and
the'keel' arch. These (with the exception of the seolloped and
elover-leaf arches) were accompanied by corresPonding forms of
domes.

2. The development of the form of tower known as the minaret.

3. The refining of various forms of pinnacles that occur also in
early Egypt, Assyria, Phoenicia, and Persia.

4. The employment in facades of two colours, by alternate
courses of red and white limestone or (in later examples) of black
and white marble.

5. The invention of the elegant wooden balconies and the
system of closing window-openings with wooden gratings (mush-
rebiyehs) or with plaster or stone gratings in Arabian patterns
(hamariyehs).

6. The development of surface ornaments into geometrical
patterns of every kind (entrelaes) or eonventionalized foliage (arab-
esques strictly so-called); the use of Arabic ornamental inscriptions
on friezes and medallions; and the treatment of wall-surfaces and
ceilings in rich polychrome hues, whether by painting, incrustation,
or mosaic,.

The chief monuments of Arabian architecture in Egypt are the
religious edifiees (mosques) and the tombs.

The period within which these were built extends from the
accession of the Tulunide sultans to the conquest of Egypt by the
Turks. The earlier mosques have disappeared, leaving hardly a
trace behind, and our knowledge of them depends upon the oh-
viously exaggerated and often confused descriptions of the Arabic
writers. The later mosques are of little artistic value. Some of
them display a union of Turkish-Arahie architectural forms with
Egyptian-Arabic ornamentation.

The only existing building dating from the TULUNIDE PERIOD
is the mosque of Ahmed Ibn Tu1tn (p. 53). The oldest plaster de-
corations in this mosque display a system of ornamentation, the
various elements in which remain, as in the antique, separate and
distinct, though some of them are so unusual in form as to defy
ts1asisifieation under any known style.

In the FETIMITE PERIOD that followed, the characteristic in-
tertwined geometrical patterns, with Sp aces filled up by Arabic orna-
mentation showing a tendency to the Byzantine style, begin to
appear. Bricks ceased to he the exclusive building material and
