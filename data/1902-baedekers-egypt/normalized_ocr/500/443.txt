LY17 N. TOURIST STEAMBOAT in 4 days.

The quay to the S. of the Kerr en-Kit bridge is the starth1g-place
of the steamers. To the left (E. bank) lie the palaces and gardens
of Cairo, the British Consulate General, the island of Réda, and
Old Cairo (p. 70), beyond which rise the Mohattam Mts., with the
citadel; on the W. are the Palace of Gizeh, with the museum, and
the Pyramids of Gizeh .--To the left (E. bank), farther on, are
the quarries and hamlets of Turra and Ma'sara (see p. 155). Oppo-
site, on the W. bank, rise the pyramids of Abusir, Salslrira, and
Dahshtr. Farther up? to the left, amidst a tine grove of palms, is a
Coptie convent, and adjacent is a still unfinished gun-faetory.

The steamer remains for some hours at (14 M.) Bedrashén (rail.
stat., p. 189), where asses are kept ready for a visit to Memphis, Sali-
hara, etc. (p. 130). Opposite, on the right bank of the Nile, lies the
village of /-feltti'irt., and a little inland is the watering-plaee of that
name (p. 154). .--0n the bank at (jll M.) Kafrr tl-Up/ii (W. bank;
rail. stat.), where the three-weeks tourist-steamer lays to for the
night, are some ancient constructions. The unimportant pyramids
ofLisht lie to the right; that to the N. is the tomb of Amenernhiit l,
(12th Dynf), that to the S. is the tomb of Usertesen I.

Iiifsha (Rekkah), on the W. bank, is the starting-point of the ex-

The PYRAMID AND Mastanas 0F NEIryiht deserve a visit, Which may be
accomplished in about f) hrs. (railw: ny travellers may perform it in lets
time from Rihka station; comp. p. 189). Crossing the 1railway, we proceed
on donkey-back in about 1% hir. to the pyramid, which rises close to the
cultivated country on the soil of the desert, 11/2 M. to the N. of the vil-
lage of Maintain. _

The Pyramid of Meidl'lm, in alCprobahir1ty the tomb of Snofru, the
predecessor of Eheops, is so different from all the other structures of
the kind that it is called by the Arabs el-Ijaram el-kadddb, or the false
pyramid. It consists of threeforig" 1nally seven) square towers, which rise
to a height of 121 ft. in three smooth and steep stages at an angle of
740 10'. The first section is 69 ft., and the second 20% ft., while the third,
now almost entirely destroyed, was once 32 ft. in height. The outer walls
consist of admirably jointed and polished blocks of Mohattam stone. The
Pyramid of Meidilrn was pillaged as early as in the time of the 20th Dyn-

asty. It was opened in 1881 by Maspero, who found a long corridor and
a chamber without sarcophagus. It was again carefully examined more
