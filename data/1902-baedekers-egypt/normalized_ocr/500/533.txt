254 Route N. THEBES (E. BANK). 2. Karnak:

the last and smallest, also an erection of Thutmosis 111., now in
ruins. 0n the walls to the right and left of the granite gateway are
representations in the usual style of the cities and tribes subdued
by Thutmosis III. (comp. p. 248); to the right are the tribes of the
S, to the left'the tribes of the Upper Retenu (Le. Syria), which
His Majesty took in the wretched town of Megidilo'.

Beyond the sixth pylon we enter the 1ihre-0ourt of the Sane..
tuary, in which are two large Granite Pillars erected by Thut-
mos1s Ill." The S. (right) pillar bears the lily of Upper Egypt, the
N. pillar the papyrus of Lower Egypt. Here also are a *Bust ofa
Colossal Statue of Ammon and a headless Statue of the Goddess
Amonet, in reddish sandstone, both dedicated by King Tut-env
Amon, whose name was later replaced by that of Haremheb, his
successor.

To the right of the fore-court is a colnnnade with papyrus-columns,
built by Thutmusis HL, whence a fine view of the ruins is obtained.
Behind the entrance ere reliefs of the time of Sethos II.

The Sanctuary, built by Philip Arrhidaeus on the site of an
earlier chamber, is not yet completely exhumed. It is built entirely
of pink granite, and is divided into two chambers. The front
chamber, opening to the W., is 19 ft. long, the hinder one, open-
ing to the E., over 25 ft. The roof, which was adorned with
yellow stars upon a blue ground, has been completely destroyed.
The walls both outside and inside were covered with reliefs, the
colouring of which is still in good preservation at some points.

Interior Walls. In the firgt chamber Philip appears offering saerittees
to various forms of Ammon. The figures and inscriptions are picked out
with bluish-green pigment. The reliefs in the second chamber are larger
and better executed, but in poorer preservation. Here, to the left, Philip
is seated at a banquet.

Round the outside of the Sanctuary runs a raised CORRIDOR. Un the
H. side of the first chamber are 4 rows of reliefs, the lowest of which is
destroyed: 1. Rites attending the entrance of the Sanctuary by the king;
the goddess Amonet gives milk tn the king. 2, 3. The sacred boat of
Ammon on different festal occasions. On the S. wall of the second
cham her are four reliefs, representing the king sacrificing to various forms
of Ammon, etc. On the N. wall of the first chamber the king offers two
small trees to Ammon-Kametf. On the N. wall of the second chamber
are reliefs similar to those on the S.wa11. The opposite wall, as well as
the back of the Sixth Pylon in the fore-court, is oeeupied-by inscriptions,
known as the Annals of 2'hutmosis 111., detailing the warlike acquisitions
of that monarch. The relief above the inscription to the right of the
black granite door depicts Thutmosis III. conferring gifts on the temple
(two obelisks, vases, necklaces, chests)..

Opening off this corridor are a number of rooms all more or less In
ruins, which were built and embellished with reliefs by Queen Makere.
As in all other places, the names and figures of the queen have been
scratched out and replaced by those of Thutmosis II. or Thutmosis III.

Continuing our progress still towards the E. beyond the sane-
tuary, we reach a flat open space, strewn with the scanty relics of
the earliest Temple of the Middle Empire. In front of the chambers
of Thutmosis IH., which may be recognized on the N. side, ran a
path, on which the Pharaohs erected statues to the grandees judged
