frfaypotoer, and Victoria of this line make similar three-weeks
voyages between Cairo and Assutn from December to May. The
general arrangements and conditions resemble those of Messrs.
cook's steamers. The return fare is 351. and upwards, according to
the cabin.

Voyages on the Nile are also arranged by the THEWFIKIEH NILE

avoid placing themselves too near the edge of the deck; and it is
well to remember (ay. whom shaving) that the steamers sometimes
run aground, eSpecially above Luxor. Liability to delay through

time to make connection with the ocean-steamers.
