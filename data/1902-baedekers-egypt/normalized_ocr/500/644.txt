The SECOND PYLON is smaller (105 ft. broad, 40 ft. high) and
less well-preserved than the first pylon. The Portal between the
towers, approached by a shallow flight of steps, was built by Euer-
getes II. and embellished with reliefs of the usual type.

. The 1arge_relief on the Right Tower represents the Pharaoh Neos
Dionysus placing the slaughtered 8aerifieial animals before Home and
Hathor. Above are two small reliefs: to the right, Nees Dionysos presenting
a wreath to Horus and Nephthys; to the left, Neos Dionysus oii'el'ing in-
eense and pouring water upon an altar, in presence of Osiris, Isis, and
Horus. The granite of the site at the foot of the tower has been smoothed
to form a stele, with a six-lined inscription and reliefs relating to a lavish
grant of lands. made to the temple of Isis by Philometor in the 2'4th year
of his relgn (157 B.C.). In front of it are the foundations of a small
Chapel (Pt. m). - On the Left Tower are similar scenes (tigures deliberately
defaced). On both towers are grooves for the Mg-staffs.

An inner staircase ascends to the W. pylon (comp. the Plan), whence
we proceed across the central portal to the E. pylon. The ascent of the
1'trtst pylon (p. 339) is, however, preferable in every respect.

Within the doorway, at the top, to the right, are some much
faded early-Ohristian pictures.

The TEMPLE OF ISIS PROPER, entered by this portal, consisted
of an open Court (here very small), a Hypostyle Hall or Prouaos,
several Vestibules, and a Sanctuary, with smaller chambers adjoin-
ing, The walls are covered both outside and inside with reliefs of
Ptolemies (Philadelphus, Euergetes 11., etc.) and Roman emperors
(Augustus, Tiberius, Antoninus) performing the customary cere-
monies in the guise of Pharaohs 5 but the traveller will find detailed
descriptions of similar scenes in our accounts of the temples of
Dendera (p. 227) and Edfu (p. 315).

The OPEN COURT had a small covered hall on each side, tho
roof of which rested on a single column. The uncovered portion could
be shaded from the sun by means of a velarium; the holes for the
cords are still visible in the upper part of the concave cornice turned
towards the second pylon.

The HYPOSTYLE HALL, with eight columns, was originally sep-
arated from the preceding court by sereen-walls between the first
row of columns. The colouring of this hall, which has been pre-
served on the ceiling and the columns, must have been very bril-
liant, The floral capitals of the columns both in the court and this
hall ere the most instructive of all the specimens that have come
down to us of the manner in which the Egyptians of the later period
coloured their columns. Comparatively little regard was paid to the

natural colours; 6.9. light green palm-twigs receive blue ribs, etc.
Christian services Were celebrated in the court and hall, of which
the numerous Coptic crosses chiselled in the walls aye memorials. A
Greek inscription in the doorway to Room B, on the I'lght1. recerde that
'this good work' took place under Bishop Theodorus. This was In the
reign of Justinian.
. The small VESTIBULES (Pl. 1), E, F) preceding the sanetyy, s
are adjoined by chambers lying in darkness. The 8yANtmrARY, Whiel1

has two tiny windows, still contains a pedestal placed here by Euer-
