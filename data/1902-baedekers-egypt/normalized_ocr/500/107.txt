HISTORY.

Louis IX., the Saint, of France undertook the Sixth Crusade,
marched against Egypt, took Damietta, but was captured
along with his army at Manyha, and was only released
on payment of a heavy ransom (p. 158).

BAERITE MAMELUKE SULTANS. The first of these monarchs
was Mu'iss Eibek.

Bibars, one of the ablest of this dynasty, annihilated the iast
remnants of the kingdom of Jerusalem in the course of
four campaigns. He brought to Cairo the last representa-
tive of the'Abbaside khalifs, who had been overthrown by
the Mongols and expelled from Bagdid, and permitted him
and his m100e8s0rs nominally to occupy the throne.

1ra1hiin, el-Mansar Kaldan (p. 59), succeeded to the exelu-
sion of a youthful son of Bibars, sueeessfully opposed the
Mongols, and entered into treaties with the Emperor Ru-
dolph and other European princes.

El-Ashraf Khalil captures'Alrka (Acre), the last place in
the Holy Land held by the Christians.

Nasir, Mohammad en-N6.sir ibn Kalrmn (p. 33), succeeded
his brother Khalil at the age of nine years, but owing to
internal dissensions was compelled to retire to Syria.
With the aid 0fthe Syrian emits, however, he regained
his throne. Distrust, vindietiveness, and cupidity soon
showed themselves to beprominent characteristics of Nasir,
who treated his emirs with the utmost capriciousness,
loading them with rich gifts or ordering them to exeou-
tion as the humour seized him. The emir Isma'il Abuliidtr,
known also as a historian, succeeded, however, in retain-
ing his master's favour till the time of his death. Towards
the mass of the population Nasir was liberal and conde-
scending, and towards the clergy indulgent. In order to
provide the en0rm011i1 sums required for the expenses of
his court and his love of building, he appointed Christian
offioials in the custom-house and finanee departments.

Hasan, Melik en-Ntffir Abu'l-j1faZlH.ra8trn ihnlrallifsn (p.49),
the sixth son of Nasir, was still a minor when he ascended
the throne. The lawless independence of the Mamelukes
and emirs was aggravated by a plague in 13/g8-.49 which
exterminated whole families, whose property was imme-
diately seized by the government. After having been ile-
throned in 1351, Hasan regained his sceptre three years
later, but in 1361 he was assassinated

CIRCASSIAN MAMELUKE SULTANS (Borgites). The founder of
this dynasty was -

Barking (pp. 33, 60, 6.3 ], a Cireassian slave, who succeeded
in raising himself to the throne by setting aside Haggi, a
boy of six years, and great-grandson of Molgammed en-'
