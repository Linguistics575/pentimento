8. Der el-sued/tteh. THEBES (\\'.BANK). 24._Roule. 295

Proceeding farther into the valley, we reach a tomb with a wide
entrance from which there is a fine view of Dér el-Medina and of
the fertile plains to the E., traversed by the Nile and bounded by
the distant Arabian mountains. In the foreground are seen Medinet
Habu, the Colossi of Memnon, and the Ramesseum, and on the
other side of the river the gigantic ruins of Karnak.

The hill of garnet Murrai', 1/2 M. to the S.E. ofDér el-Medineh,
is occupied by a number of fella }; huts. Scattered among these are
several tombs of the 18th Dyn., most of which are of little interest.
The only one that need be mentioned is the -

Tomb of Buyii, who was governor of Ethiopia under Tut-enkh-
Amon. The key is kept by the Inspector General at Medinet Habu
(to the S.E.).
