74 Route 6. OLD CAIRO. Environs

produces an imposing effect. The columns, all of marble of various
kinds, were once 366 in number. Their heterogeneous nature is
accounted for by the fact that they were brought from Roman and
Byzantine buildings in Cairo and were adapted to their new func-
tions by rude Procrustean methods of lengthening or shortening.

The facades of the Court (Salm) have no pretensions to an-
tiquity; the arches (many defective) are of a curious shape, which
it is diffieult to classify either as pointed, round, or horseshoe
shaped. The court itself is now planted with trees. In the centre
is a fountain, beside a palm-tree. The South-Eastern Lhvtn is
the sanctuary. In front of the pulpit is a column of grey marble,
on which, by a freak of nature, the names of Allah, Mohammed,
and Sultan Suleiman in Arabic characters, and the outline of the
prophet's'kurbatsll' appear in veins of a lighter colour. This column
is believed by the Muslims to have been transported miraculously
from Mecca to Cairo by the Khalif'Omar. In the N.E. corner is
the Tomb of Shékh'Abdallah, son of "Amr. In the W. colonnade,
which consisted of a single row of columns only, a Pair of Columns
alone remains. They are placed very close together, and it is said

that none but honest men could squeeze themselves between them.

This mosqae is almost disused. On the last Friday in the month of
fasting, however, a solemn service is annually held here, in which the
Khedive and bis grandees take part. On the remaining Fridays throughout
fhe year a handful of p001' Muslims, mostly of the working classes, assemble
tor worship in the venerable but poorly preserved sanctuary. - In 1808
this mosque witnessed a very remarkable scene. The whole of the Me-
hammedan priesthood, the Christian clergy of every sect, and the Jewish
rabbis. with one accord, assembled in the mosque ofiAmr to pray for the
rise of the Nile, which had delayed beyond the usual period.

The traveller will find it not uninteresting to visit one of the
Kulleh jUanu/'aetories on the W. and S. sides of the mosque (balsshish,
a few cepper coins). The porous water-jars (Arabie Kultehi ] used
throughout the whole of Egypt are ehiefly manufactured at fieneh
in Upper Egypt of light-grey clay of very equal consistency. The
remarkably uniform and delicate porosity of the vessels is produced
by mixing the clay with ashes. The rapid evaporation caused by
the porosity of the kulleh cools the liquid within to a temperature
of 12-140 lower than that of the surrounding air.

A visit to the Tombs of the Mamelukes (p. 68) may be con-
veniently made from this point. Continuing to follow the road
across the rubbish-hills of Fostét, we observe on our right a Mus-
lim burial-ground, and at a short distance in front of us the old
aqueduct (p. 69). A little to the right, on an eminence, rises an
old ruined mosque (dei'a Abii 8u% d), beyond it is the Citadel
with the mosque of Mohammed'Ali, and farther distant are the
hills of the Moliattam with the mosque of (r1y11shi (p. 108). This
view is very striking towards sunset. The road, which becomes bad.
beyond this point, leads round the ruined mosque and ascends
