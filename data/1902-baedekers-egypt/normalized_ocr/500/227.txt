chateau Nimreh Teldtch ('Number Three'; Pl. N. T.) and the chateau
and garden of 3folurrrem-Eey.

The EXCURSION TO MEKS (Mex) may be made by railway, by
boat.. from the Marina, by the electric tramway (p. 5), or by carriage
(p. 5). By rail we start from the principal station (P1. G, 5), pass
the stations of Hadm and Nusha, cross the Malumldtyeh Canal, and
then turn towards the W., passing Gabbari, Phare, and iiiF2hi" ifi,
(comp. Pl. E, F, 8). The station for Meks is at (i0 M.) Manazel.
The road (Pl. i/ C, 8) traverses the hilly ancient Neeropolis of the
Ptolemaic period (p. 9). Between the road and the railway are the
gardens and palace of Gabbwri, which have been converted into a
Quarantine or iazzaretto. In the friable limestone of the coast-hills
are a number of tomb-chambers, called Baths of Cleopatra; but most
of them have been destroyed by the inroads of the sea, and are now
covered up. Farther on, to the right, is the large Slaughter House,
built in 1898. On the beach of Meks are a casino, sea-baths, and
several restaurants and cafes. To the S.W., close to the sea, is the
Bath el-Urah C'Beduin Gate'), the extremity of a line of fortifications
extending between the sea and Lake Mareotis (p. 21). The quarries
of Meks (p.111) supplied the material for the new harbour-works.

RAMLEH is connected with Alexandria by a road beginning at
the Porte de Rosette and by two railways. On one of the railways,
however (Abulsir-Rosetta line, p. 19, starting from the principal
station, Pl. G, 5), there are only two trains daily to Ramleh.

The station of the DIRECT RAILWAY T0 RAMLEH lies to the N. E.
of the town (P1. G ,2); trains every 1/2hr. (lst el.return-fare, 4pias.).

The so- called Roman Tome: (P1. G, 3), 1/4151. to the E. of the station,
seems to be an early-Arab erection. - To the w. of the station stood,
down to March, 1880, the famous obelisk called Cleopatra's Needle, dating
from the time of the Pharaohs, and erected in front of the Caesareum. It
was presented to the city of New York by the Khedive Isma'il, and new
forms one of the prominent features of the Central Park there. - A com-
panion obelisk, that lay prone in the sand by the side of Cleopatra' s Needle
until 1877, nosir adorns the Thames Embankment at London.

Projecting into the sea, to the left, soon after the departure, is
the small Fort Silseleh (Pl. H, 1). We here obtain a retrospect of
the siekle-shaped S.E. side of the town.

The railway then traverses the rubbish-heaps of the ancient
Nicopolis, the large E. suburb of Alexandria founded by Augustus
on the site of his final victory over the adherents of Antony. Near
1hrahtmtyeh, the first station, are a Greek-Orthodox Church, numerous
villas, and the finely situated British Sporting Club, with its race-
course. Beside the next station, Sidi GÃ©ber or Muejafa, is the tomb
of a highly revered Mohammedan saint, with a neighbouring mosque
built by the present Khedive. On an eminence to the left is a ruined
vieeregal chateau, built by Ismafil Pasha, now accommodating the
greater part of the British garrison, the remainder being under canvas
close by (Camp Moustapha). In the vicinity are the remains of the
