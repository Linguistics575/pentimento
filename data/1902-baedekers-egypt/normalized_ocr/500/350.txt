of Cairo. GREAT PYRAMID. 8. Route. 117

Construction of the Great Pyramid. According to Borehardt's theory this
pyramid was not built on a single homogeneous plan (p. 115). It was
originally designed to contain only one sloping corridor hewn in the rocky
ground and leading through an antechamber (s) to the tomb-chamber (t).
Bat before this design was completely carried out, it was exchanged for
a more comprehensive plan, involving the eor1struetion of another ehamber,
now called the Queen's Chamber (g), reached by the corridor marked c, e, f.
But even this was not final, for Kheops undertook another and greater
extension, resulting in the construction of the Great Hall (h) and the King's
Chamber (k).

The ASCENT of the Pyramid, though fatiguing, is perfectly safe.
The traveller selects two of the importunate Beduins (p. 113) and

proceeds to the N.E. corner of the pyramid where the ascent usually

begins. Assisted by the two Beduins, one holding each hand, and,
if desired, by a third (110 extra payment) who pushes behind, the
traveller begins the ascent of the steps, which are each about 3 ft.
high. The strong and active attendants assist the traveller to mount
by pushing, pulling, and supporting him, and will scarcely allow
him a moment's rest until the top is reached. As, however, the un-
wonted exertion is fatiguing, the traveller should insist on resting
as often as he feels inclined. Htkut walk"; mt/tsh balyhtsh' (be quiet,
or you shall have no fee) is a sentence which may often he em-
ployed with advantage. All requests for bakshtsh should be refused,
and it is as well to keep an eye upon one's pockets. - The ascent
may be made in 10-15 min., but, in hot weather especially, the
traveHer is recommended to take nearly double that time, in order
