HISTORY OF ART. Cxli

presented by the great temple-eourt; the oolonnadecl [ hypostyle ]
hall of the temple corresponds to the broad hall of the dwelling;
and the deep and large hall in which the master of the house spent
his time finds its analogue in the sanctuary, the dwelling-plaoe of
the god. And Just as these apartments in the dwelling-house were
adjoined by chambers and rooms for various purposes, so the sane-
tuary in the temple was adjoined by a series of small apartments,
store-rooms, eto. Thus the temple was literally what the Egyptians
called it, the House of the God.

In many temples the oolonnaded hall is further separated from
the sanctuary by one or more Smaller Halls (with or without ool-
umns) of narrower proportions and diminishing in height. Fre-.
quently also the sanctuary is followed by several other halls and
chambers; and not unfrequently the great hall is preceded by two
eolonnaded courts instead of by one, while in these the eolonnade
on the rear-side is placed on a terraoe-like structure above the level
of the pavement. The particular purposes of all these various rooms
are hard to determine; with the exception of the open court they
were probably all closed to the general public and accessible to the
priests alone. Only the king or his representative, the high-priest,
might enter the inner sanctuary and there'gaze upon the god'.

Though many temples, such as the temple at Luxor and the
great temple of Ammon at Karnak, exhibit a much more com-
plioated form than that just described, the explanation is that they
were not built 011 one uniform plan but owe their construction to
various builders. la the descriptions of the particular temples 130n--
cerned this matter is treated with due attention to detail.

0eeasionally the nature of the site compelled farther deviations
from the above-desoribed form. In Lower Nubia the sandstone
rocks approach so close to the bank of the Nile that the temple
must be partly or wholly constructed in the rock, the necessary
rooms being hewn out. At GerfWustsn (p. MO) the court is built
as usual, while the oolonnaded hall and the sanctuary are hewn out
of the rock. The larger temple of Abu Simbel is entirely a rock-
building, the pylon and the eolossi included. At Abydos the diffieulty
of excavating the rock was avoided by placing the part of the temple
containing the slaughter-eourt and other offiees at right angles to
the main edifice, so that the whole now presents the form of a "1.

Of the large temples of the Libyan epoch (Bubastis) and of the
late period Ceur. at Sais) almost nothing has come down to our day.
Nearly all the kings of that period resided in the Delta, and there-.
fore markedly favoured the N. in erecting their monuments. There
the sanctuaries were built of limestone, and in mediaeval and mod-
ern times the blocks have either found their way into lime-kilns,
or, since the Delta itself yields but scanty building materials, have
been utilized for new buildings, usually leaving only the less easily
worked blocks of granite behind. It was not until the days of the
