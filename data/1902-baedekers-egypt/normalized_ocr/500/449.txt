194 Route f8. EL-HIBEH. From Cairo

the Mudiriyeh. The linen-manufacture for which this place was
celebrated in the middle ages has greatly declined, but there are
several sugar-plantations and a small bazaar. To the left of the
railway is a fine grove of palms.

0n the right bank of the Bahr Yi1suf, 10 M. to the W. of Benisuéf,
lies the village of Henassiyeh el-Medineh (vulgo, Jfenassiyeh Umm elAimdn,
'rubbish-heaps of Henassiyeh'), beside the mounds of débris, covering
an area of 1,2 sq. M., which mark the site of the ancient TLsrac1eopttW.
The Egyptian name of the town was 27enen-seten, from which are derived
the Coptic muh, and the Arabic Aland: and Hetuuttyeh. It was the capital
of a name (the Graeco-Roman Heracleopolites) and the chief seat of the
worship of the ram-headed god Hershef, identified by the Greeks with
Heracles (whence the name of the town). The ichneumon also was re-
vered here. Among its chief shrines was a temple erected under the Middle
Empire and a new building by Ramses IL, but all have practically van-
ished; and four columns of a late period, probably dating from a Byzantine
church, are all that projects above the rubbish-heaps. The ancient neero-
polis lies on the W. side of the Bahr Yilsuf.

Another road, traversing the Wadi Baydd, which opens near the vil-
lage of Baydd, on the E. bank of the Nile, opposite Beniyatef, leads through
the desert to the Convents of ,88. Anthony and Paul (p. xxxix), a few leagues
from the Red Sea.

As far as Minyeh the space between the E. bank and the hills
remains narrow, the limestone rocks frequently abutting on the river
in unbroken walls or rounded bluffs. Few villages are seen 011 this
bank, but the fertile alluvial tract on the W. side, IO-IMI. in width,
is thickly populated and carefully cultivated, exhibitingin profusion
all the cereals that grow on the Nile, date-palms, and S11gar-eane.
The sugar-factories, which are a monopoly of the Khedive, follow
each other in rapid succession. They are connected by the railway,
and short branch-lines, used in harvest-time only, run from them
to the plantations lying farther to the W. Their lofty brick and iron
chimneys impart a very moderu-industrial air to the ancient land
of the Pharaohs. Large barges with sugar-lanes or with fellahin
'factory-hands' are met on the river. The juice is expressed from
the cane and then refined by being boiled twice in closed vessels.

The boat passes several large islands. On the W. bank lie Ba-.
ranka and Blbeh (Bebe, el-Kobm, p. 189), with large sugar-factories.
The channel now contracts, and numerous islets are passed. 95 M.
Feelin [ Fachn, - rail. stat., p.189), on the W.bank, is 11513 M. from the
river. Near the village of El-Hibeh (El-chah), on the E. bank,
about 21/2 M. farther up, are the ruins of an ancient town, con-
jectured to be JTet-henu t'phasnix-eastle0, the capital of a province.

The Town Walls, Which are in good preservation. were restored under
the 21st Dyn., as is proved by numerous bricks stamped with the names
of Princess Etrt-ern-khetr and her husband Jfett-kheper-rg, or of their 5011

Pinotem (IL), high-priest of Ammon. - Ruins of a temple, built by
Sheshonk I. and Osorkon 1. (22nd Dye), have also been discovered here.

On the E. bank rises the Gebel Shékh Embfirak.

108% M. Maghagha (post and telegraph oftiee at the rail. stat.,
p. 189), on the W. bank, with a large sugar-faetory, which pas-
sengers by cook's tourist steamers are permitted to inspect.
