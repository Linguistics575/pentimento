11nfinished capitals should be noticed. In the back-wail are five
doors, which led to various chapels.

TEMPLE 0F ARHESNOFER (ArsnuphisJ, a Nubian deity, erected by Philopator
and Ergamehes, his Nubian contemporary, and extended by Epiphanes.

The *Temple of Isis, dedicated to Isis and her son Harpocrates,
was the principal sanctuary on the island and probably occupies
the site of an earlier shrine. Its erection, begun by Ptolemy Phila-
delphus, was completed in its essential details by Euergetes L, but
its embellishment with inscriptions and reliefs was a very gradual
process, and at not a few points was never finished.

The FIRST PYLON, 150 ft. broad and BO ft. high, consists of two
towers and a central portal, decorated by Nektanebos with the tn1storn-
ary reliefs. On the front of the right tower appears a huge figure
of the Pharaoh (Ptolemy Neos Dionysos) in the usual attitude,
grasping a band of enemies by the hair, and raising his club for the
fatal stroke. To the left stand Isis, the hawk-headed Horus of
Edfu, and Hathor. Above are two reliefs: to the right, the king
(Neos Dionysos) presents the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt to
Horus and Nephthys; to the left, he offers incense to Isis and Har-
pocrates. On the left tower are similar representations, and at the
foot are numerous demotic and Greek inseriptions. A doorway,
embellished with reliefs by Philometor, leads through the left tower
direct to the entrance of the Birth House (p. 340). In front of the
pylon formerly stood two obelisks, erected by Euergetes IL, and two
lions, all of granite. One of the obelisks (which bears an important
Greek inscription) and portions of the other are now in England;
while one of the lions has been placed on the base of the left obe-.
lisk, and the other lies on the ground. - The terrace is modern,
dating from 1896.

Adjoining the E. pylon-tower, to the right, is an elegant Gateway,
which was built by Ptolemy Philadelphus and originally stood in a
brick-wall. It is embellished with reliefs of Ptolemy (on the lintel)
and Tiberius (on the jambs).

The "ASCENT "THE PYLON is recommended. The winding staircase
begins in the S.E. angle of the fore-court (see below). Several unadorned
and feebly lighted chambers are found within the towers. The view
from the top commands the whole island and its surroundings,

We now pass through the central gateway, within which, to the
right, is a French inscription (Un 7 de la r√©publir1e') commemorating
Napoleon's Egyptian campaign and the pursuit of the Mamelukes
by General Desaix in 1799.

The FORE COURT, which we next enter, is bounded on the S. by
