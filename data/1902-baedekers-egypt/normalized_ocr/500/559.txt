of the underworld and the beginning of the journey in the 4th
region. On the Right Entrance Wall and the Right Wall is the
journey through the 2nd region of the Underworld (2nd chapter of

In the two Middle Rows we see (above) the boat of the sun, adorned in
front with a rug, and bearing the ram-headed sun-god, seven other gods,
and the'mistress of thtrboat'. It is preceded by two goddesses of truth,
Osiris, the lion-headed Sekhmet, and other deities. Below in his boat is
the sun-god, in the form of a scarabaeus, worshipped by two figures ot
Osiris; in front are three serpents and several deities. In the Top and
Bottom Rows (representing the banks of the river) are small square panels,
containing representations of spirits in human and animal shapes (air.
baboons, fiery serpents), which greet the god on his entrance into the
lower world or drive away his foes.

In a Recess at the end of the left wall is the jackal-headed Amr-
bis, performing the ceremony of the'Opening of the Mouth' before
Osiris. - On the Rear Wall is the journey of the sun in the 2nd
hour of night [ 2nd chapter of the'Book of that which is in the

and one without a number). SIDE ROOM XI. The gate of the under-
world and the sun's journey through the 3rd region (3rd chapter of

text in this room contains a very ancient myth of a rebellion of
mankind against the sun-god, their punishment, and the ilnal rescue
of the survivors. The scene on the rear-wall is an illustration from

spirits, with two boats of the sun floating on its back - SIDE
