MEMPHIS. 9. Route. 131

At (po M.) Bedrashén visitors bound for Memphis and Sakhara
leave the train, which goes on to Upper Egypt. The station lies to
the right of the line. We ride along the railway, turn to the right,
cross a bridge, and follow the embankment towards the village of
Bedrashén and a conspicuous grove of palms on the W. We pass
through the bazaar of the village, where candles may be bought at a
Greek'balslrtil'. On each side of the embankment lie green fields in
spring and summer, and large expauses of water in autumn and
the first half of winter. The embankment ends near the first trees
of the palm-groves, 20 min. from the station. The large mounds of
rubbish before us, shaded by palms, and strewn with blocks of
granite, broken pottery, and fragments of brick, mark the ancient -

Site of Memphis.

Were it not for the vast Necropolis to the W. of the ancient
city, no one would imagine that one of the most famous and pop-
ulous capitals of antiquity had once stood here. The Egyptians,
from the earliest period down to the Roman imperial epoch, built
their edifiees, with the exception of palaces and temples, of large
sun-dried bricks of Nile-mud; but even the public buildings of
Memphis have entirely disappeared, as the stones were carried off in
former centuries to build other editiees on the right bank of the
Nile. The narrow streets, which are said to have been half-a-
day's journey in length even down to the 12th eent., extended
between the Nile and the Girzeh Canal, to the N. as far as Gizeh,
and to the S. about as far as the latitude of the Pyramids of Dahsht1r.
The most important quarters and buildings of the city appear to have

stood in the fields of the villages of Bedrashén and Mit Rahineh.

HISTORY. Memphis, the capital of the nome of'the White Wall',
belonged to Lower Egypt and from a very early period played an im-
portant strategic and political rdle, owing to its position on the borders
between the two ancient kingdoms of the'North' and the'South' (p. lxxv).
A later tradition ascribes its foundation to Menes, the first historical ruler
in Egypt, who is said to have built also the temple of Ptah (Hephaestos),
the patron-god of the city. Memphis consisted of several quarters, the
most important of which were the'White Wall' (in later times the citadel),
the'South Wall', with a temple of Ptah, and the'House of the Spirit of
Ptah', or great temple-preeinets of that god. Under the 6th Dyn. a new
quarter was founded, in which King Pepi flsed the residence of his court
and near which the sepx1lchrtyl pyramid of the ruler was situated. This
quarter, and also the pyramid, were called Mevirirmewmofer, is. King
Meriré (Pepi) remains beautiful', and this name (in the later form Menfi,
in Greek Memphis) was afterwards applied to the whole city. Memphis
attained its greatest prosperity under the monarchs of the Ancient Empire,
who resided here or in the vicinity (near Gizeh). When Thebes became
the centre of Egypt and the Theban Ammon the most revered among
the gods, under the Middle and New Empires, Memphis appears to have
retrograded. But even in the time of the 20th Dyn. the temple of Ptah
was the largest in the country but two. In the course of the contests
for the possession ofEgypt, which raged after the 22nd Dyn., the city was
captured by the Ethiopian Piankhi and by the Assyrians, and on several
other occasions.
