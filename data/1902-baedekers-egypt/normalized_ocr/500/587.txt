The Tombs of the Queens, called by the Arabs Btbtrn, el-llarhn
"Bthttn cs-Sulfc'mdt, and sometimes Bib/in el-draggi Hummed, do
not demand a visit except from travellers who have abundant
leisure.

On the way from Der el-Medineh to the (1/4 hr.) Tombs of the
Queens we pass a number of historically important steles of the
18th, 19th, and 20th Dyn., placed against the ridge. One of these
shows Ramses 111. before Ammon; Mer-segret, goddess of the West,
offers him her breast; behind is Harmachis. The inscription refers
to the campaigns of the king. On another Ramses III. appears before
Horus, and his father Set-nakht before Ammon. - The road from
Medinet Habu (p. 297) to the (1/2 hr.) Tombs of the Queens crosses
the desert to the W., and passes through a mountain-valley with
bare and lofty sides of limestone, picturesquely formed and carved
with inscriptions to the gods of the regions of the dead.

The tombs belong mainly to the 19th and 20th Dynasties, but

a few are of the 18th Dynasty. Altogether upwards of 20 have
been discovered, many 11nfinishisd

Q't,'id The most interesting tomb lies
'tlist' on the S. side of the valley. This is

the Tomb of Queen Titi. It consists
of the usual antechamber (P1, 1) open
to the N., a long passage (Pl. 2j, and
a large chape1 (Pl. 3) with a small
chamber 011 each of its three sides.
In this as in most of the better pre-
served tombs of the Queens the fresh-
ness of the colour is extraordinary.

On each side of the entrance to the passage kneels Maat, the goddess
of truth, protecting those who enter with her wings. 0n the left wall
(P1. a) of the Passage J? we see the queen before Ptah, Harmachis, the
genii of the dead Emset and Twemetf, and Isis; on the right (P1. b) Titi
stands before Thout, Atum, Rebhsnewf, and Nephthys. Ptah is placed
opposite to Thout, Harmachis, i.e. the morning sun, to Atum, Ce. the
evening sun, the two genii of the dead Amset and Twemetf to the two
others Hapi and Kehhsnewf, and lastly Isis to her sister Nephthys. -
At the entrance to Room 3 are at Pl. c the Goddess Selket (with the scor-
pion on her head), and at Pl, dNeith,'the great lady of Sars. In Room 3
are figures of gods and daemons. - On the rear-wall of Side Chamber 4
Hathor, the goddess of death, appears (in the form of a cow) in a moun-
