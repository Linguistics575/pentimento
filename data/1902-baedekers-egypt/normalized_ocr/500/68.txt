FARM PRODUCE. lvii

the Delta yields its harvest of maize, which, next to wheat, is the
most important of the Egyptian cereals. (The annual yield of these
two grains is said to amount to 24 million bushels.) The autumn
cultivation lasts from August to October, and sometimes till Novem-
ber. In Central Egypt maize is also an important summer-crop.
Along with it is sometimes cultivated the less common Sorghum
or Durra [ Indian millet or Eaffir-eorn), which is eaten by the
poorest fellahin only. It is, however, largely consumed by the Bed-
11ins on the Arabian side of the Nile, and in the Sudan and Nubia
forms the chief food of the inhabitants. Another plant cultivated
in autumn, rarely seen in Egypt, but common in the Sudan and
Nubia, is the tropical Sesame, from Which oil is largely prepared.
