"p. All the varieties of the conjugations in Arabic cannot, of Course, be
exhibited here. In the vocabulary (pp. Clxxvi et seq.) reference is made to
the above paradigms by the insertion of the letters (a), (b), (c), etc., after
the verbs there given. - It should be noted that the form kasatt does not
mean'to break', but'he broke', or'he has broken'. The 3rd pers. sing.
(mass) of the perfect tense shows the simplest form of the verb (which
usually possesses three root-letters), so that that pers. of the perf. is given
in dictionaries'ra-A-du-sa-.--'--'---"'--
