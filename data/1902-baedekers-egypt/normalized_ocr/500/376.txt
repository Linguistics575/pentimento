many instances been pushed on one side, and on the top of some
of them the Arabs, for some unexplained reason, have built rude
masses of masonry. All the sareophagi, when discovered by Mariette,
had been emptied of their contents, with the exception of two,
which still contained a number of trinkets. Only a few of the
sareopl1agi bear inscriptions; one hears the name of Amasis, another
that of Cambyses, and a third that of Khabash, leader of the Egyptians
against the Persians (p. lxxxvi).

Near the E. end of the principal passage we reach a side-passage
on. f) diverging to the right, from which another passage leads to
the right, in a direction parallel with the main corridor, but now
built up, as it was in a dangerous condition. Opposite, we pass
over another sarc0phagus by means of steps (P1. g) and thus regain
the door by which we entered the vaults. The temperature in these
subterranean chambers is always about 7fP Fahr.

'I confess', says Mariette, in his report of the discovery,'that when
I penetrated for the first time, On
12th Nov,, 1851, into the Apis vaults,
I was so profoundly struck with
astonishment that the feeling is
still fresh in my mind, although
five years have elapsed since then.
Owing to some chance which it is
difficult to account for, a chamber
which had been walled up in the
thirtieth year of the reign of Ram..
ses II. had escaped the notice of
the plunderers of the vaults, and
I was so fortunate as to find it un-
touched. Although 3700 years had
elapsed since it was closed, every-
thing in the chamber seemed to be

of the tomb-chamber. Everything
was in its original condition in this
tnmb, where the embalmed remains
of the bull had lain undisturbed
for thirty-seven centuries'.

Next to the Apis Tombs the private tombs (Mastabas, p/cxliii)
are the most interesting points at Sakhara, though only a few are

open to the inspection of tourists.

The **Nasitaba of Ptahhotep, which lies between the Step Pyr-
amid and Mariette's House and has only recently been made ae0e88-.
ible, dates from the period of the 5th Dyn., under which the
deceased held one of the highest offiees of state.

From the entrance (A on the Plan,'p. 138), on the N, side, we
enter a CORRIDOR (B), on the right of which is the PILLARED HALL
