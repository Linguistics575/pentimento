of Cairo. MOKATTAM. 7. Route. 109

amids, gilded and reddened by the setting sun. At our feet are
the Citadel with the mosque of Mohammed'Ali, the old aqueduct
on the left, and the domes of Imam Shhfe'i o. 68 ]. A still more
varied view is commanded by a steep projection to the S. of the
old mosque of Gi1p1shi, the foreground being especially picturesque,
while the horizon to the S. seems more open and tempts our fancy
to visit the wonders of Upper Egypt.

At the N. end of the plateau is an old Turkish fort, whence a
bridge descends to the Citadel. On the N.E. and higher part of the
Mohattam, separated from the Citadel by a large quarry, is a memor-
ial stone, to the right, adjoining the summit, erected in 1874, by
the British party of geientifie men who observed the transit of Venus
from this point. The projecting rock in front of this point eom-
mands the most extensive panorama in the neighbourhood of Cairo,
and should certainly be visited if time permit. The S. (right) end
of these hills is skirted by the road to the. smaller Petrified Forest,
which may be reached from this point in about 1 hr. (see p. 110).

The route back to the town skirts the Citadel on the S. and
leads vit the Brib el-r.far0'feh and the Place MÃ©he'met Ali (p. 51;
view from below of the mosque of Mohammed'Ali).

3. Spring of Moses and. the Petrified Forest.

To the natives the Petriflei1 Forest is known as the'areat' and the
'little' Gebel el-Khashab. The styientifie traveller will find a visit to the
former extremely interesting, but most travellers will be satisfied with an
excursion to the latter, the outskirts of which may be reached in 11/2-2 hrs.
The expedition may be made in half-a-day on donkey-back. Carriages
require extra horses, and even then sometimes stick in the sand. - The
deviation to the so-oalled Spring of Moses adds rather less than an hour to
the expedition. - The donkey-boys are usually familiar with the route
to the Little Petrified Forest, so that a guide may be dispensed with;
but a visit to the'threat', near the Bir el- Fahmeh, can hardly be accom-
plished without the aid of a. well- informed'iiiiiiiaiir.

Leaving the Bab tur-Nasir (p. 62), we turn to the right to the
Tombs of the Khalifs, pass between the Mohattam (p. 108) and the
'Red Mountain' (p. 77), and ascend to a desert valley, into which
the E. splits of the Mohattam descend. After a ride of 1/4 hr., dur-.
ing which an isolated hill of red and black sandstone resembling
the'Red Mountain' is visible in the desert 011 our left, we cross a
deep, dry water-course. The path divides here. That to the right
leads to the Spring of Moses and the Little Petrified Forest (see
p.110), while that to the left is the route to the Great Petrified
Forest and the Bir el- Fahmeh (p.111).

About 100 paces to the right, at the foot of the mountain-slope behind
the tombs of the Khalifs, which we ascend on this side past some large
lime- kilns, is an interesting trace of the sea in the pliooene age, in the
shape of a rocky face of the nummulite plateau, 235 ft. above the present
sea- -1evel, thickly dotted over with holes made by boring shells.

Following the path to the right, we observe a yellowish hill at
the foot of the spurs of the Mohattam, and reach it in 1/4 hr. more.
