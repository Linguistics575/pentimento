polurnn (with rich floral capital), on the S. side, Is now erect. In
the side of the S. pylon-tower next the coert are two doors, one (8.)
leading to a chamber, the other (N.) to a staircase ascending through
three stories to the roof
t "( fine view). The N. tower
s1i, s,. k .K; also contains a staircase,
K I'i IE T. but the doors are now
_ blocked up. On each side
of the court four narrow
chambers have been con-
structed in the wall; and
a door in the N. colonnade
communicates with the
passage round the temple
and with a crypt. The
rear-wall of the court
forms the imposing fapade
of the Hypostyle Hall,
Which is entered by the
large portal in the middle.
Between the columns are
four screen-walls.

On the first screen to the
left, Thout and Horus are
shown anointing the king
"with the consecrated water,

typiiled by the hieroglyphs
s-l----" for'life' and'purity'. Adja-
cent sits Harsi√©sis of Talmis.

On the first screen to the
right is a Greek inscription.
This is a decree of Aurelius
Besarion, also named Amonius, military governor of C) mbos and Ele-
phantine, ordering the owners of swine to remove their animals from
the holy Talmis, It probably dates from the year 248-9 At. - On the
second column to the right are two Greek inscriptions, between which
is a long inscription in the Meroitic cursive character (p. oix). - The
most interesting inscription, however, is on the right corner of the fagade.
This is the Memorial Inscription of Silica, sub-king of the Nubians and all
the Ethiopians (ca. 5th cent. AD), in which he celehrates, in bad Greek,
his victory over the Blemmyes, whom he defeated'from Primis to Talmis,
advancing as far as Taphis and Talmls'.

The HYPOSTYLE HALL (Pl. C) was supported by 12 columns, with
elaborate floral capitals, but of these only two, beside the four on
the facade, are now standing. The roof has collapsed. Most of the
reliefs on the rear (W.) wall represent the emperor saerideing to
the gods; two, to the left of the door, deserve notice. One shows
one of the Ptolemies presenting a field to Isis, Mandulis, and a third
deity; the other represents AmenoPhis IL, founder of the original
temple (p. 3651 offering a libation of wine to Min and Mandulis.
0n the sereen-wall to the left of the entrance is a later Christian
painting of the Hebrew Children in the fiery furnace.
