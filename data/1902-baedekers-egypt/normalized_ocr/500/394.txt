HELWKN. 10. Route 155

back as the time of Amenophis IV. (ea. B.C. 1380) and were again
made available for sanatory purposes in 1871-72, have a temperature
of 91° Fahr. and resemble those of Harrogate, Aix in Savoy, and
Hercules-Bad in Hungary in their ingredients. They are efficaeious
in cases of rheumatism, skin diseases, and eatarrhs. The Viceregal
Bath Establishment, In the Moorish style, opened by the Khedive
in 1899, is excellently equipped, and compares well with the best
European baths. It contains immersion-baths for fresh, salt, and
sulphur water, electric baths, hot-air baths, vapour baths, radiant
heat baths, etc. There are two swimming baths (120 and 90 ft.
long), filled with running sulphurated and salt water, one reserved
for ladies, the other for gentlemen. There are arrangements also
for inhalation, massage, and sun and air baths. The interior of the
Ehedive's private bath-house may be inspected.

The Viceregal Observatory (see p. 77) is being removed from
Cairo to Helwan, with the addition of many new instruments.

The dry and warm climate is specially adapted for rheumatic,
pulmonary, and kidney diseases, and for all cases in which cold
and damp should be avoided (comp. also p. xxvii). Between Nov.
and Feb. rain falls for a few hours only, and even during the
inundation, when the lower-lying river-valley is covered with mist
in the morning and evening, the atmosphere at Helwan is free
from all perceptible moisture. The mean temperature in winter
is 610 5'Fahr., with a daily range of'Ito (from 51 to 72o). The
amount of daily sunshine averages 8 hrs., and the fall of tem-
perature after sunset is very slight. In consequence of the rocky
soil and the powerful rays of the sun, the air is extraordinarily
pure, dustless, and bracing.

Helwan is within easy reach of Cairo. Excursions may be made
to the gorge-like valleys of the desert, and to Sakhara, while the
banks of the Nile afford good wild-fowl shooting, but the desert
game is shy and not easily reached.

The quarries of Ma'sara. and Turra are reached from Helwan in
11/2 his. ride l can dies and matches should not be forgotten. These quarries,
which are still worked, yielded some of the stone used in the construction
of the Pyramids and Mastahas and other ancient buildings down to the
Ptolemaie period. The stone is transported to the bank of the Nile by
means of tramways, carts, camels, and mules. The Arahs of the present
day quarry the stone on the outside of the rocky slopes only, while the
quarrymen of the Pharaohs penetrated into the interior of the mountain
and excavated large chamhers, when they came to serviceable stone. These
apparently endless dark rocky halls can scarcely be trodden without a
feeling of awe. The roofs are supported by pillars of rock. A few in-
scriptions, recording the opening of new halls in the quarries, Borne de-
motie inscriptions, and reliefs (Kings AmenemhiU, Amosis, Amenophis IIL,
Nekht-Har-ehbét) are still preserved. The Egyptians named these the
quarries of Roma (or f'-roya), which the Greeks corrupted into Troja, while
Strabo relates that the village beside the quarries was'an ancient residence
of captive Trojans who had followed Menelaus to Egypt and remained there'.

From Helwan an interesting visit may he paid to the Wedi 1Tof (don-
key in 1/2 hr.: provisions and water should be taken), with its fine fossils

I

and remarkahle desert-vegetation, which is finegt after rain.
