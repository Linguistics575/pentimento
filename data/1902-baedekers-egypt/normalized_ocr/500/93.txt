Thutmosis II. nately.

Thutmosis III. (i5il5-tdiH BC.)

After the death of his sister and brother---

Thutmosis III. reigned alone. He was one of the most notable Egypt-
ian kings, recaptured Syria, and established the influence of
Egypt in W. Asia. His rock-tomb is at Biban el-Muhlk (p. 276 ].

Amenophis II. (Amenhotep; i461-1i36 B.C.); roiylr-tomb at Biban
el-Muhlk (p. 276).

Thutmosis IV. (1436-1427 8.0.) excavated the Sphinx at Gizeh
(p. 123).

Amenophis m. (1427-1392 B.C.), whose wife was named Teyé,
maintained intercourse with the kings of Babylon, Assyria, Mitani
(on the upper Euphrates), etc. (see cuneiform tablets from Tell
el-'Amarna, p. 94), and built temples in Nubia, Luxor, Medinet
Hab11 (Colossi ofMemnon), and elsewhere. His tomb is at Bibin
el-Multsk (p. 277).

Amenophis IV. (i392-i374 BC.) endeavoured to replace the old
religion by the worship of a single deity, viz. the sun, an
endeavour perhaps to provide a god that should be worshipped in
common by all the peoples ofthe extensive empire (p. cxxii). The
movement was probably instigated by the priests of Heliopolis
and was directed at first only against the gods of Thebes, who,
during the New Empire, had thrown all others into the shade.
Many of the ancient deities, especially those of Thebes, were
fanatically'persecuted', their images and names being removed
from all monuments. For his own original name, in which the
name of Ammon occurs, the king substituted that of Ekh-en-aton
01' Spirit of the Sun. Tell el-'Amarna (p. 203), near which is the
king's tomb (p. 209), was made the capital instead of Thebes.
After the death of Amenophis internal commotious broke out
and the recently introduced'religion was again abolished.

Among his successors (i37i-d350 BC.) were Eyé (tomb at Biban
el-Mu1tsk, p. 277) and Tut-enkh-Amon, who transferred the
royal residence back to Thebes.

Harma'is (Haremheb), who restored peace, is the virtual founder of

SethosI. (getoyei) fought against the Libyans, Syrians, and the Hit-.
tites (Kheta), a powerful people that under the 18th Dyn. had
penetrated from Asia Minor into N. Syria and threatened the
Egyptian possessions in Syria and Palestine. Sethos built large
temples at Karnak, Kurna, and Abydos. His tomb is at Biban
e1-Multsk (p. 271); his mummy at Gizeh (p. 80).
