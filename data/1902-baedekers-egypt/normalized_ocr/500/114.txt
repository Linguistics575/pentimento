however, was mortally wounded at the latter engagement.
The British reached the Nile at Gubat, just above Metem-
meh, on the evening of Jan. 19th, and 011 Jan. 24th a
small body of men under Sir Chas. Wilson set out forkhar-.
ttun in two steamboats which Gordon had sent to meet
them. Sir Charles reached Kharttm on the 28th, but
found that it had already fallen 011 the 26th, apparently

The project of reeonquering the Egyptian Sudan from the
Mahdists was temporarily abandoned, and WÃ©di Halfa Ile-
mained the S. limit of the Khedive's dominions (p. xxxi).
Though Suakin became the basis, of more or less desultory
operations against Osman Digna, the British devoted their

*chief attention to developing and improving the administra-
tion of Egypt proper. Negotiations on the part of the Porte,
instigated by France and Russia, to bring the British oo-.
eupation of Egypt/to a close, have hitherto proved fruitless.

trality of the Suez Canal.

The Khedive Tewfik died on January 7th,1892, and was
succeeded by his eldest son Abbas II. 1.rilmi (b. July 14th,

is controlled by the British plenipotentiary, Lord Cromer
(p. 2N. In the spring of 1896 a British-Egyptian military
force under Sir Herbert Kitchener (now Lord Kitchen er of
Ehartihn) commenced operations against the Mahdists to
the S. of Widi Halfa. On Sept. 2nd, 1898, the Mahdist
army was defeated in a decisive engagement, and 0mdur-.
min, their capital, situated on the left bank of the Nile,
opposite Kharttim, was taken. Since then the Egyptian
Sudan, reunited to Egypt, has been under a special Anglo-
Egyptian administration (see p. 380), at the head of which
is a British Governor-General, who is also Sirdar of the
Egyptian army. Kharttnn was rebuilt as" the centre of
government.
