Assifi.t, or Stat (the name of which still preserves the ancient
Egyptian Syowt), enjoyed considerable importance, even in anti-
quity, chiefly owing to its favourable situation in the midst of an
extensive and fertile plain and at the beginning of a great caravan
route leading to the oases in the Libyan desert and thence to the
Sudan. The town was the capital of the Upper Sycamore Nome and
the chief seat of the worship of the god Wep-wat, who was repre-
sented as ajaekal or wolf of the desert. This latter circumstance
gave rise to the Greek name Lycopolis, or'Wolf town'. The modern
Assitot, which extends for about a mile from E. to W., is the largest
town (over 42,0001nhab.) in Upper Egypt, the capital of a pro-
vince, and the residence of the Mudir. It has, however, lost part of
its commercial importance since the great caravans from W. Africa
have frequented other routes and places. The fine pottery of Assi1U,
especially its bottles and pipe-bowls, is justly celebrated and forms
an important article in its export trade, which also deals in linen,
embroidered leather goods, carved ivory, natron, soda, and corn.
Near the harbour are several large palm-gardens, in which also grow
pomegranate, fig, and other fruit trees. These gardens are let at
high prices and produce rich harvests of fruit. The streets and
bazaars are full of busy life, especially on Saturdays, when the

people of the neighbourhood fioek into the market.

I'lotintss, the greatest of the Neo-Platonic philosophers (205-270A. D.),
was born here in the beginning of the 3rd cent., and his system was not
uninflueneed by the priestly doctrines of his native town. From the be-
ginning of the 4th cent. onwards Christianity was dominant in the town
and neighbourhood. Pious believers took refuge in the caves of the
necropolis to live a life of penitence apart from the world. One of these,
John of Lycopolt's, at the end of the 4th cent., bore the reputation of a
saint and even of a prophet. Theodosius sent an embassy to him to en-
quire the outcome of the civil war. The anchorite foretold a complete
but bloody victory, and this prophecy was fu1li11ed in the victory of
Theodosius over Eugenius at Aquileia in 394 A.D. - The Egyptian Mission
of the American Presbyterians (100 stations, 26 churches, 97 schools) has
one of its chief stations at AssM.t (director, Rev. Mr. Alexander).
