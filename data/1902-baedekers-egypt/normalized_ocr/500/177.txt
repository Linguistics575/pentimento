clxvi BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS.

The ordinary streets of Oriental towns are very narrow, so
that no very satisfactory view is to be had of the fapades and
grated balconies of the houses. The groundfloor is built of solid
masonry and its rooms are frequently vaulted. The upper stories
usually overhang and are supported, together with their balconies
or oriel-windows, by stone consoles of peculiar construction. An
agreeable and effective contrast to the broad, flat surfaces of the
house-front is offered by the elegantly shaped oriel-windows and
by the Mushrthtyeh, or wooden balcony-gratings, carved to resemble
interlaced strings of beads. The deep door-recesses (like those of
the mosques) also serve to break the level uniformity of the facades.
The massive wooden doors are strengthened with iron bands or
(less frequently) studded with nails arranged in intricate inter-
laced patterns.

The er1tranee-passage (Dirkeh) admits to the Hash or court
(Pl. I, d), which corresponds to the atrium of Roman houses and
has no columns around it. Off this open the rooms of the Salamltk,
the Mandara, Takhta Bosh, and Mak'ad. At the back is the Btsh
el-Hartm (Pl. I, 12), or door to the staircase to the upper floor, before
which hangs a brightly coloured curtain. The staircase is usually
narrow and without ornament, though sometimes the ceiling and
string-boards are embellished with ablack and white mosaic pattern.
At the top is the vestibule of the Ktga (p. clxv), the drawing-room
of the harim. The Ki'a is usually a long and narrow room with a
lofty ceiling, and, strictly speaking, consists of three connected
portions, differentiated in shape and height of ceiling. The square
central portion, known as the Durkh" a, lies one step lower than the
Ltuytuv, on each side. These liwans are not always on the same
level; the broader one is regarded as the place of honour by the
ceremonious Orientals. The ceiling of the durka'a, always loftier
than those of the liwans, is provided with a cupola or lantern, with
coloured-glass windows of the kind known as Kamartyehs. These
kamariyehs are plaster-disks, about 11/4 in thickness, perforated,
while still soft, with patterns representing vases of flowers, houses,
geometrical figures, writing characters, etc., the openings being
afterwards filled in with coloured glass. Owing to the above-
mentioned difference in the height of the ceilings, two of the walls
of the durlptra rest upon supports which are based upon massive
brackets reaching far down on the main side-walls. This arrange-
ment results in a curious kind of flat arch, against which some of
the beams of the lissrsin-eeiling lean. The durka'a is paved with
coloured marbles and frequently has a fountain in the centre. The
Itwins are paved with ordinary stone slabs, which are concealed by
rugs or carpets. On one wall of the durlriea there is always a Safe,
a kind of stand on which are placed the dishes used in entertaining
guests. The walls of the Itwins are panelled to the height of 6 or
8 ft., and against them are placed divans, above which is a broad
