Abu Tarfa (W. bank). About 1 M. to the S. is a rock-cave with
the tomb of a shékh. The low rapids here, caused by granite rocks
in the Nile, are known as the Bab Abu Her.

121/2 M. Murwau (on both banks). At the village of Euh & htsb, on
the W. bank, are ancient quay-walls with a Nilometer and an un-
finished little cave-chapel, A little to the N. is a curious irriga-
tion arrangement hewn in the rock.

On the W. bank, opposite the village of Dendiir (E. bank), ap-
pears the small -

Temple of Dendiir, built by Augustus, and dedicated to various
gods, including Pete-ésé' and Pii-Hir, the sons of Kuper, two local
deified heroes. The temple stands upon a platform, immediately at
the foot of the mountains, and is preceded by a broad terrace. Of the
PYLON, which formed the entrance to the temple, only the stone door-
way remains; the towers, probably built of brick, have disappeared.
At the top of the portal is the winged sun-disk, and within and
on the front (E.) and back (W.) is the Pharaoh sacrificing to various
gods. Beyond the portal we enter an open COURT, which was orig-
inally enclosed by brick walls. The facade of the TEMPLE is adorned
with two columns with rich floral capitals, connected with the side...
walls by screen-walls. The temple comprizes a Vestibulc and two
Smaller Chambers. The former is embellished with reliefs of the
Pharaoh in presence of the gods, which in the Christian period,
when the hall was used as a church, were covered with stucco, bear-
ing pictures of saints. The smaller rooms have no decoration. 111
the rear-wall of the innermost is a shallow Recess, with representa-
tion of the local saints Pete-ésé and Pé-Hor praying tolsis and Osiris.
In the top of this wall also is a deep crypt, which could be closed
by a large and a small stone. The N. and 8. Exterior Walls of the
temple are adorned with interesting reliefs. 0n the N. wall, to the
left of the door from the vestibule, appears the Pharaoh ohering a
piece of cloth to Pé-Hor, on the S. wall, below, to the left of the
door, he sacrifices to Pete-ésé, who is accompanied by a woman,

probably his wife.

Among the various Inscriptions placed on the walls by visitors to the
temple, is one in Coptic, in which a certain Presbyter Abraham records
that he erected a cross here in the church at the command of the Nubian
King Eispanomé. This appears within the S. side-door of the vestibule.

Above the temple is a small Rock Chapel, with a door showing the
hollow cernice. 1n the clifls to the N. of the temple are some Quarries.
The stones lying in front of these are, perhaps, remains of ancient houses.

Beyond (181/3 M.) Meriyeh, a commune on both banks, the banks

of the Nile become flatter and are partly cultivated.

23 M. Girtheh (E. bank), situated in a wide belt of cultivated
land, lies besides the ruins, of the ancient Byzantine fortress of
Wrhagiira, which stretches up the hill from the river and is enclosed
by strong walls of masonry.

Opposite, on the W. bank, lie the village and -
