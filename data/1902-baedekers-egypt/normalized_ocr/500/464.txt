to Aesiti.t. TELL EL-'AMARNA. 18. Route. 205

The Tombs of Tell el-.'Amarna are essentially the same in point of
structure as the tombs of the 18th Dyn. at Thebes (p. 287). Each is im-
mediately preceded by a Fore Court, which was originally surrounded by a
brick wall. Thence a wide door admits to the Main Chamber, hewn in the
rock, and in many cases with columns supporting the roof. The Chamber
containing the statue of the deceased is next reached, either by another
door, or by a corridor, passing between two other apartments. Many of
the tombs are unfinished, in consequence of the early death of Ameno-
phis IV. and the subsequent return of the court to Thebes. - The tombs
(in both groups) are marked with black nu1nhers (1-25), running from N, to S.

TOMB 1 belonged to Buyii, superintendent of the royal harem
and steward to the queen-mother. In the entrance is the deceased
praying. The MAIN CHAMBER has two clustered columns, of which,
however, only that on the left side is standing. Entrance Wall. To
the right are the king and queen seated at table, below the queen
are two princesses facing each other, to the right are guards, etc.
Here, as in all similar representations in the tombs at Tell e1-
'Amarna, the sun appears above the royal couple, with rays ending
in hands. Below are musicians, a banquet-table, bowing servants,
soldiers, etc. Right End Wall. The temple of the sun is represented
with the chief altar in the colonnaded court and statues; to the right
the king leads his mother to her palace, escorted by guards (behind
and below); above is the sun with the rays ending in hands (see
above). Rear Wall. This is occupied, on each side of the door, by
two companion scenes (much injured), showing the king on the
balcony of the palace. Left Eml Wall. The king is being carried in
a litter to the temple of the sun (right), accompanied by a large
retinue. Entrance Wall. To the left, a scene resembling that to the
right (see above). - On both walls of the door to the next room the
deceased appears in prayer. The following Chamber (unfinished)
contains the mummy-shaft, surrounded by a parapet hewn in the
solid rock. - In the LAST CHAMBER (serdib; p. oxliv) is a recess
with the eolossal seated figure of the deceased, the features of Which
have been defaced. On the walls are mourners, -me11 with saeritieial
gifts, a carriage, chairs, etc.

TOMB 2, whose owner is unknown, deserves special attention
because its construction was still going on under Saker√©, the son-
in-law and successor of Amenophis IV. The Main Chamber has two
columns; the rear-chambers are unfinished. Among the representa-
tions in the former the following may be mentioned. Entrance Wall.
To the left is the king seated under a campy holding the stem of a
goblet, Which the queen is tilliug with water; adjacent stand three
princesses. To the right, the king, in a balcony of the palace, is
handing down golden ornaments to a woman and a man; behind
the balcony (to the right) are the royal chariot and fan-bearers;
below, servants with food and drink. Right Wall, The king seated
upon a chair in his palace; interesting representations of wrestlers;
Libyans and Syrians bringing tribute.

The other tombs lie 3/4 M. to the S.E., in another hill-slope.
