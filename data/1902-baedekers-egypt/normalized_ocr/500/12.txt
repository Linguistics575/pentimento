PREFACE.

Ever since the attention of the civilized world was re-
directed to Egypt at the beginning of the 19th century, the
seientifie investigation of its innumerable monuments has
pointed with ever-growing certainty to the valley of the Nile
as the cradle of history and of human culture. At the same
time Egypt, like other Eastern countries, possesses high nat-
ural attractions, in the peculiar charms of its Oriental eli-
mate, the singularly clear atmosphere, the wonderful colour-
ing and effects of light and shade, the exuberant fertility
of the cultivated districts contrasted with the solemn, awe-
inspiring desert, and the manners, customs, and appearance
of a most interesting and most diversified population.

The present fifth edition of the HANDBOOK TO EGYPT
comprises in its scope the regions previously treated of in
separate volumes devoted to Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt
respectively. Though the text has thus been curtailed by at
least one-third, the Editor believes, that by eonfining himself
to essential points and by carefully arranging his material,
he has succeeded in rendering the present edition no less
useful than the previous ones in supplying the traveller with
the necessary information regarding the country and the
people he is about to visit, in protecting him against extor-
tion and in rendering him, as far as the nature of the ease
permits, independent of outside assistance. An attempt has
been made to indicate clearly the most important among the
bewildering multiplicity of the monuments of antiquity; and
the descriptions of these have been so arranged that, assum-
ing the traveller to have previously read at his leisure our
account of the origin, history, and signifieanee of a partie-
ular temple, or tomb, ete., he will find adequate guidance
on the spot in that portion of our description that is printed
in larger type, while those who have time and inclination for
a more thorough examination, will find additional particulars
in small type. A first visit to the Temple of Dendera, for
example, may in this manner be accomplished in about an
hour, which is approximately the time allowed to passengers
by mail-steamer.
