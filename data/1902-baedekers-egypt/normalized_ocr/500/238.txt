Private Apartments are seldom to be obtained for a shorter period
than six months, so that an arrangement at a pension or at one of the
less expensive hotels will frequently be found almost as cheap. Informa-
tion as to rooms may be obtained at the chief shops or from agents whose
addresses may be best learned at the consulates. A sunny aspect should
be chosen, and a detailed written contract invariably drawn up. A
bargain as to food may be made with some neighbouring restaurant;
for only those conversant with the language should attempt to keep house
for, themselves with native servants.
