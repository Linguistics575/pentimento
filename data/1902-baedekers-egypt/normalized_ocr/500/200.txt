XII. Works on Egypt.

The traveller who desires more than a mere superficial acquaint-
ance with the land of the Pharaohs should of course before leaving
home read some of the standard works on the subject, and also
select a number of others for reference or entertainment during the
journey. This is all the more necessary if the traveller is entirely
ignorant of the ancient and modern languages of the country, in
which case he will find it diffieult, if not impossible, to institute
independent enquiries as to its manners, literature, and art. From
the appended list, which might easily be extended, the traveller
may make a selection in accordance with his individual taste.

A very complete bibliography of Egypt will be found in Prince Ibra-
him Hilmy" s Literature of Egypt and the Soudan from the earliest times
to the year 1885 inclusive; 2 vols. foI., London, 1886-87. Among the leading
foreign authorities on Egypt are ZepsiusV,'Denkmiiler aus Egypten und
Ailthiopien', Champollion's'Monuments de l'Egypte et de la Nubie', Jiotellinih;
'Nonumenti dell' Egitto e della Nubia', and the'Description de 1'Sgypte'
published by the members of the French expedition.

Arabian authors, a philosophical historian, and chiefly famous for the pre-
face to his history, which was printed at Btt1itl.c, in seven volumes, in 1868-,
Ahutjidd (d. 1331), prince of Hama in Syria. The following are authors
of important works on limited epochs of Egyptian history and of valuable
descriptive works: - Et-Mak.rtzi (d. 1442, at Cairo), the author of a geo-
graphical, physical, historical, iPAJ? olitiel. description of Egypt, and of
Cairo in particular, printed at Biiliil.c in 1854; Abul-i1falidsin (d. 1469), the
