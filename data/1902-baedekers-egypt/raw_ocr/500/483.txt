the special rites in honour of Osiris. We first enter a Halt, the roof of
which was supported by ten columns (without capitals). To the right of
this lay three small chambers, adorned with fine sculpture and dedicated
vespeetively to Horus, Osiris, and Isis. Behind them lies another room
(P1. m; closed). To the left on entering the columned hall is a door lead-
ing to a room with four columns, which was adjoined by three smaller
apartments tPl. n, o,p). These are much damaged and still partly buried.

SOUTH WING. - This building consists of a series of rooms, all
more or less ruinous, a slaughter-yard, storerooms, etc. The most
important, to which a visit should be paid even if all the others be
omitted, is the long corridor known as the *GALLERY OF THE KINGs,
entered from the left side of the second hypostyle hall, between the
second and third row of columns. 011 the right wall is the famous
*LIST OF KINGS. Sethos I. with the censer, and the orown-prinee
Ramses (with the side- lock of youth) reciting hymns from a book,
are seen revering their royal ancestors, the names of 76 of whom are
inscribed in the two upper rows. The list begins with Menes, the
first king of Egypt, and extends down to Sethos, the names of 1111-
important or illegitimate rulers being omitted. Above the list is the
inscription: 'The performance of the prayer for the dead - May
Ptali-8okaris-0siris, lord of the tomb, who dwells in the temple of
Sethos, increase the gifts for the kings of Upper and Lower Egypt -
by King Sethos; 1000 loaves of bread, 1000 barrels of beer, 1000
cattle, 1000 geese, 1000 ineense-offerings, ete., by King Sethos for
King Menes' etc. (here follows the list). In the lowest row the
phrases 'by King Men-mat-rt =, ,'by the son of Re Sethos' are repeated
over and over again.

This list of kings is of great historical importance, as partly by its
aid it has been possible to fix the order of succession of the Egyptian
kings. Another similar list is mentioned at p. 255.

On the left wall of the corridor we again meet Sethos and the
youthful Ramses. The father holds a ceuser in his left hand, whilo
the son, adorned with the priestly panther-skin, pours a libation 011
the altar in front of him. The inscription contains in systematic
order the names of these objects of worship, with their homes, whom
Sethos has honoured with sacrificial gifts. -- In the centre of the right
wall a door leads into a narrow Passage, beyond which is a vaulted
stone staircase which probably led to the roof of the temple.

The Beliefs in the passage date from Ramses II. On the right wall
the king and a, prince aspen lassoing a bull in presence of the jackal-
headed good Wep-wat. n the left wall Ramses and a, prince offer geese
to Ammon and Mutt farther to the left five gods are netting birds; Ramses
paces out the precincts of the temple; Ramses conducts four sacred cows
to Khons and King. Sethos.

Another door in the Kings' Gallery (now built up) led to a small
Chamber, the walls of which Jfftff, adorned partly with paintings by Se-
thos 1.,psrt1y by reliefs' en creux by Ramses II. This chamber is now
almost entirely buried again.

The other rooms of this S. wing are all more or less in ruins.
From the S. end of the kings' gallery, where Coptic prayers have
been written up in red, we enter the Slaughter Court, surrounded
