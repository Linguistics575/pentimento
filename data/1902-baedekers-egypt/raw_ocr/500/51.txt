xl T HE MODERN EGYPTIANS. Copts.

earh other. The two distinct types have also been recognized in the
skeletons of the ancient mummies.

Few nations in the East embraced the Gospel more zealously
than the dwellers on the Nile. Accustomed as they had long been
to regard life as a pilgrimage to death, as a school of preparation for
another world, and weary of their motley and confused Pantheon
of divinities, whose tself-seeking priesthood designedly disguised
the truth, they eagerly welcomed the simple doctrines of Christianity,
which appeared so well adapted to their condition and promised
them succour and redemption. Like Eutyches, they revered the
divine nature of the Saviour only, in which they held that every
human element was absorbed; and when the Council of Chalcedon
in 451 sanctioned the doctrine that Christ combined a human with
a divine nature, the Egyptians, with their characteristic tenacity
adhered to their old views, and formed a sect termed Eutychians, or
MonoPhysites , to which the Copts of the present day still belong.

The name of the Copts is an ethnical one, being simply an Arabic cor-
ruption of the Greek name of Egyptians. The theory is now exploded that
they derive their name from a certain itinerant preacher named Jacobus,
who according to Mahrizi was termed E1-BerLli'i, or 'blanket-bearer', from
the old horse-cloth worn by him when he went about prea :hing. This
Jacobus promulgated the monophysite doctrine of Eutyches, which had
found its most zealous snpporter in Dioscurus, a bishop of Alexandria,
who was declared a heretic and banished after the Council of Chalcedon;
and his disciples were sometimes called Jacobites. If this name had ever
been abbreviated to Cobit or Cobt, it would probably have occurred
frequently in the writings of Monophysites; but there we find no trace
of it. It is, on the other hand, quite intelligible that the word Copt,
though originally synonymous with Egyptian, should gradually have come
to denote a particular religious sect; for, at the period when the valley
of the Nile was conquered by 'Amr, the native Egyptians, who almost
exclusively held the monophysite creed, were ehiefly distinguished by
their religion from their invaders, who brm ght a new religious system
from the East.

TheseEgyptian Christians strenuously opposed the resolutions of
the Council of Chalcedon, and thousands of them saerifieed their
lives or their welfare in the fleree and sanguinary eonfliets of the
8th century, the causes of which were imperfectly understood by
the great majority of the belligereuts. The subtle dogmatic dif-
ferences Which gave rise to these wars aroused such hatred among
these professors of the religion of love, that the defeated Monophys-
ites readily welcomed the invading armies of El-Islam, or perhaps
even invited them to their country.

After the conquest of Egypt by the Arabs (p. 32) the Copts were
at first treated with lenity, .and were even appointed to the highest
government oftiees; but they were soon doomed to suffer persecutions
and privations of every description. These persecutions were mainly
due to their unbounded arrogance and their perpetual conspiracies
against their new masters, and their Mohammedan contemporaries
even attributed to them the disastrous eonf1agratious from which the
new capital of the country so frequently suffered (p. 33). Their
