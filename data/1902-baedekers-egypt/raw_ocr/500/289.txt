part of the Nile valley. The announcement of the wefa is the signal for
cutting the embenkments of the irrigation-canals (ydm gebr el-baltr or yam
wefa el-bahr, between the Ist and 14th day of the Coptic month Misra,
(Le. 6-19th'Aug.), which is accompanied with noisy popular merry-making.
The rate of taxation was determined in ancient times in accordance with
the height of the inundation, and even to this day there is a certain
connection between these two facts.

Adjoining the Nilometer is a large Kiosk in the Turkish style
(no admission]. - To the N. of a smaller round kiosk on the E,
quay-Wall is a modern Nilometer, to which a flight of steps de-
scends. - The S. end of the island commands a tine view of the
Nile, with Gizeh to the right, the pyramids in the baekgrouni1, and

of which are hung with innumerable rags. According to a popular
superstition the patient must thus offer to the saint the cloth which
enveloped the affected limb, pluck off two leaves, and tie them 011
the affected part with another cloth.
