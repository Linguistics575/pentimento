286 Route24. THEBES (w. BANK). 6. Ramesseum.

On the shafts of the columns and the sides of the pillars are representa-
tions of Ramses II. sacrificing to the gods. The figures of Osiris, most
of which are headless, represent Ramses II.

The S. wing of the wall between the first and second courts is
now level with the ground, but the N. wing is still partly standing,
and its surface, especially that facing the second court, is in good
preservation. Upon it are two rows of interesting representations.
Those in the Lower Row once more refer to the Hittite war and
commemorate Ramses IL's great exploits at the Battle of Kadesh.
The king, much larger than the other warriors, dashes along in his
chariot. The Hittites, pierced by arrows or trodden down by the
horses, fall in confused heaps; crowds of them are hurled into the
Orontes, where numbers perish. Farther to the right appears the
battlemented fortress of Kadesh, round which the river flows. Beside
it, on the other side of the river, are Hittite troops that have had
no share in the battle; some of them hold out helping hands to their
drowning comrades. The Upper Row (well seen with an opera-glass)
contains scenes from the Festival of Min, (the harvest-god), which
was celebrated when the king. ascended the throne (p. 300). To the
left stands:, the king, awaiting the procession which is headed by
priests carrying the images of the royal ancestors. Two tall poles
erected in front of the king bear the gods headdress. Adjacent are
priests letting fly four birds, for the purpose of carrying tidings to
the four quarters" of the globe that the Pharaoh has attained the
crown. Farther to the right the king appears cutting a sheaf with
a sickle for presentation to the god, thus discharging the second
ceremony usual at the festival. -- This second court also contained
colossal statues of the king. Fragments of one of these (in black
granite) lie upon the ground; the head is of great beauty (nose
broken). On the throne are the names of Ramses II., beside which
that of Belzoni the explorer (p. 116) has been placed.

The TERRACE bounding the second court on the W. was reached
by three flights of steps, of which that to the N. is in excellent
preservation. Ascending these we turn to the S. part of the Rear
Wall (P1. aj, on which are three rows of representations. In the
bottom row are eleven sons of the king; in the middle row, to the
left, is the king conducted by Atum and the hawk-headed Mont,
who holds the hieroglyph for 'life' before the king's face; to the
right is the king kneeling before the Theban triad, while Thout,
behind him, writes the king's name on a palm-leaf; in the top row
the king is shown sacrificing to Ptah, to the left, and offering in-
cense to the ithyphallic Min and a goddess, to the right.

Beyond this terrace is the Great Hypostyle Ball, which had three
entrances, corresponding to the above-mentioned flights of steps.
This hall, like the great hall at Karnak (p. 249), had three aisles,
of which that in the centre was higher than the others. The central
aisle has six couples of columns with ealyx-capitals and six couples
