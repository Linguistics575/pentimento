Eastern Desert. ISOSER. 30. Route. 317

In the Ptolemaic period the desert-route end ed at the Leukos Limen
or 'White Harbour’, and in earlier times in the vicinity of the Wddi
ihatu, near the village of Sauw, a little to the N. of J_x'oeér. About
3 or 4 M. to the N. of Iioeér lies Old Foflr, with some scanty an-
cient remains.

In going from Kosér towards the Nile the Beduins sometimes prefer
another and more southerly route than that through the Wiidi Hammihmit.
This diverges from the route above described at the Bir el-Béda '(see above)
and leads at first through the winding Wddt Kabr et-Khddim, afterwards
passing the Gebel Nuftds and through the pass'of Rtat el-Ghazdl into the
Wetde Ghaedl. To the right rise the conical Gebel Dayhatriyeh and Gebet
gfoshdghir. We next follow the Wadi Homada, which farther on takes the
name of Wddi el-{Iomr from the fine Gebel Homr, which flanks it on the
right. The night is spent at Bir erMo'ita, a well beside a few huts of the
'Abatrdeh. At the Gebel Wti.kif we cross the Tarizc ed-dahrdwi, a road
running from N. to s., and farther on reach 'Amdra, with another well
and more 'Ababdeh huts. Thence our route lies through the Midi Mir
and the dei {Cash to the Bir el-Kash, a dried-up well, beyond which we
pass numerous quarries of green breccia. Beyond the passes of Rfat el-
Khiit (sandstone formation) and Ih"at el-Eamra we reach the Mabwa1a(see
p. wo of Rds defar, whence we go on through the Wddi Mdghlat to Mab-
walat Khih. el-Ghir. Lastly we proceed viii thihrat a.3-pab'a to Lalcéya (p. 345),
where our route unites with the more northerly one already described.

The Jo UREEY TO BERENIKE through the territory of the rAhahdeh Beduins
is seldom undertaken. We may start from Iieneh or Koptos, diverging at
Talpha from the route to Kosér, Or we may begin at a point opposite Edfu
(Contra-Apollinopolis) 0r Redésiyeh (p. 319). On both routes traces of old
watering stations are discernible. The Itinerary of Antonine (3rd cent.
A.D.) gives a list of the ancient stations (starting from Koptos) with their
distance from each other in Roman miles, as follows: Phoenicon 24, Di-
dyme 24, Afrodito 20, Kompasi 22, Jovis 23, AristOnis 25, Phalacro 25,
Apollonos 23, Kabalsi 27, Eamon Hydreuma 27, Berenike 18 - in all 258
Roman miles = about 236 English miles. - A third route, established
by Hadrian, led from Antinoupolis (p. 201) to the Red Sea, and then
southwards along the coast to Berenike.

t7olenishefr, the Russian Egyptologist, who described his journey in
the ‘Ilucueil de travaux relatifs it 1a philolngie Ggyptienne‘ (1889), took
11 days from Redtstyeh (p. 319) to Berenike, and returned thence to
Assuitn in 8 days. 4

lst Day, Bir Abbad (3 hrs.), in the det Midb. The Wadi Miiih is
entered opposite the mouth of the Wddt Ammerikbe. This is an ancient
station with quarry-marks like those at el-Hosh, near Silsileh (p. 319).
Lepsius mentions a ruin here, named Herhush (tie. sandstone), dating from
some ancient settlement.

2nd Day. Temple of Sethos I, The Temple was discovered in 1816 by
Cailliaud, on his first journey to the mines of Aft. Zabira. It was built
by Sethos I. beside a water-station either constructed or restored by that
king, and was dedicated to Ammon-RE. The vestibule is built of blocks
of sandstone and is supported by A columns with lotus-capitals. The
reliefs represent the king as victor over negroee and Asiatics. - The
following inner chambers are entirely hewn out of the rock. The first
HALL contains a square pillars. Long inscriptions on each side of the
entrance record the sinking of the wells and the building of the temple.
On the side-walls the king is shown tsacrificing, to the variohs gods wor-
shipped in the temple. In the rear-wall are threehiches, with statues of
the king and various gods. - A Smut” Building be51de.the temple perhaps
marks the site of the well sunk by Sethos. On an adjoining rock, to the
E., are three steles. On one of these is an Asiatic goddess on horseback,
with a shield in her left hand; the second is dedicated to the official
entrusted by Sethos with the sinking of the well; and on the third is the
