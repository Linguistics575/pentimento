:MEHALLET EL-KOBRA. 22. Route. 159

The sculptures (hautreliefs and reliefs en crews) are most elaborately
executed. Several of the female heads and busts, and some of the cows‘
heads also, are remarkably fine. The inscriptions consist of the usual
formulas; none of them are historical. In some the hieroglyphics are
unuSually large, in others they are of smell and elegant form, and in all
they are executed in the somewhat florid style peculiar to the age of the
Ptolemies. On the W. side of the ruins is an interesting large slab of
grey granite, veined with red, on which is represented the king offering
a gift of land to Osiris and Isis, 'the great divine mistress'. Higher up
there is another block of grey granite, with a representation of Isis en-
throned, and of the king offering to 'his mother' two small bags of mal-
aehite and eye-paint. To the E. is another block of grey granite, with
reliefs. On a grey block of granite, lying in an oblique position, is re-
presented the sacred bark of Isis, resembling those seen elsewhere in
bronze only. The cabin is like a house of two stories, in the upper of
which sits the goddess, with cow‘s horns and a disk, 011 a lotus-tlower,
and attended on her right and left by winged goddesses. On the N. side
lies an unusually large Hathor capital, in granite. Numerous remains of
pillars and arehitraves also still exist.

On the N.W. side of the ruins of the temple lies the village of
Behbit, and adjoining it still exists the sacred lake of the temple.
