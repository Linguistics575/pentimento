p. 156), lie the mounds of debris known as Nebesheh, the ancient Egyptian
Yemet, the capital of the 19th nome of Lower Egypt. These were excavated
in 1886, at the instance of the Egypt Exploration Fund, by Prof. Flinders
Petrie, who discovered the remains of a temple built by Ramses IL, with
the aid of older monuments, and a sanctuary of the town-goddess Buto,
founded by Amasis. In the cemetery, among the Egyptian tombs of the
19th Dynasty and later, were found the graves of Cyprian mercenaries
stationed here under Amesis.
