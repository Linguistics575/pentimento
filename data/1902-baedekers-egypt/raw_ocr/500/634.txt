The RAILwAY, starting at the Lux or Station, to the S. of Assuen,
describes a wide curve round the N. and S. granite quarries (p. 330)
and ends at the station of SheWit (p. 336).

The DeseeT ROUTE, which crosses the railway-line and leads
past the Arabian and European cemeteries (the latter containing
the graves of meny British soldiers), is the old road described by
Strabo, who asmgns it a length of 50 stadia. On the heights to the
right are small British forts and bloek-houses. Beside the road lie
large blocks of granite, with ancient inscriptions carved byEgyptian
off1eials employed in the quarries. M. de Morgan has numbered
these Inscriptions with white numbers. Farther on, beyond the
point where the route via the river-bank diverges (see below), we
notice considerable fragments of an ancient Brick Wall, incorporat-
mg a few granite blocks, which was probably erected as early as
the Middle Empire to protect the road against the predatory attacks
of the E. desert-tribes. The wall is f) ft. thick and, at places, 12 ft.
high. It first appears. to the W. of the road, then crosses it, and
remains on the E. side as far as Shelldt (p. 336).

The RIVERSIDE ROUTE diverges to the right from the Desert Route
about 1/9 M. beyond the European cemetery, approaches the river,
and reaches the village of Maltatta, opposite the island of Sehél.

The island of Sehél, lying below the cataract and reached from Assui1n
by boat, was dedicated to Anukis, and contains over 200 roek-inserip-
tions, besides the ruins of two temples. One of the temples (t0 the S.)
dates from the 18th Dyn., the other, near the village of Sehel on the W.
side of the island, from the Ptolemaic period (Philopator). High up n11
the S.E. rocks of the island is an important inscription of the Ptolemaic
period, recording that in the reign of the primeval King Zoser (p. 134) the
Nile failed to rise during a period of seven years and that a famine arose
in the land in consequence, until at the prayer of the king the cataract-
god Khnum put an cud to it by a fresh inundation.

Beyond Sehél we ride inland across loose rocks, and pass through
the long Nubian village of .Kor6r; then, after traversing the desert
for a short distance, we return to the river. The view of the stream
with its numerous dark-eoloured granite reeks, covered with a
smooth glaze, like enamel, is very fine, although the foaming rapids
of the Great Cataract are now things of the past. To the right are
the works of the new Barrage (Arabic, el- Khastm), a gigantic dam
which is expected to be finished in 1903. The object of this huge
undertaking is to dam up the waters of the Nile to a depth of 65 ft.
during the inundation, in order to utilize it gradually for the regular
irrigation of the entire country throughout the rest of the year. The
dam, which is being constructed of solid granite masonry, is ith M.
in length and, at the deepest points, it is 100 ft. in height and 88 ft.
thick at the bottom. The outflow of the water will be regulated by
