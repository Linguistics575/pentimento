HISTORY. XCV

invoked the aid of Amalarich 1., King of Jerusalem C1162-
73), who came to Egypt and expelled the Kurds. A second
army of Kurds, which was about to invade Egypt, was
driven hack in the same way, whereupon Amalarich him-
self endeavoured to obtain possession of Egypt. Shawer
next invoked the aid of his enemy Nt1reildin, whose Km:-
dish troops expelled Amalarich. Egypt thus fell into the
hands of the Kurds Shirkuh and bjalaheddin. Shawer was
executed. Shirkuh became chief vizier, and on his death---
fia1klusdi1in ().Sahflieddtn Ydsu/‘ibn Eyyab, p. 32), the Saiadin
of European historians, ruled in the name of the ineap-
able khalif. On the death of the latter Salaheddin became
sole ruler of Egypt, and founded the dynasty of the -.

Eyyubides. 1171-1250.

JSaJ'ahedd'in built the citadel (p. 51) and old aqueduct of
Cairo (p. 53). Being a Sunnite, he abolished the Shi'ite
doctrines and forms of worship. Syria was conquered.

Melik el-‘Adil, his brother and successor, preserved intact
the dominions bequeathed to him; but the empire was
dismembered at his death, and Egypt fell to the share of
his son -

Melik el-Kamil (pp. 158, 160).

Damietta (Dumyit() was captured by the army of the Fifth
Crusade, but was surrendered again in 1221 (p. 160).
Kimil concluded a treaty with the Emp. Frederick IL, who
appeared at the head of an army in Palestine, by which
Jerusalem and the coast-towns were surrendered to the

emperor for 10 years.

While the sons of the last sultan were fighting with each
other for the throne of Egypt, the Mameluke -.mrtt..-

Melik ets-i1Mel.1 usurped the throne and founded the -

Mameluke Dynasty. i. 12d0-i517.

The Egyptians take Jerusalem, Damascus, Tiberias, and
Asoalon.

 

+ The MAMELUKES were slaves (as the word mamlak imports), pur-
chased by the sultans and trained as soldiers, for the purpose of forming
their body-guard and the nucleus of their army. They placed Melik e?-
Saleh on the throne, hoping to govern him without difficulty. But when
the new sultan found his authority sufficiently well established, he dis-
missed them from his service, and formed a new body-guard of the
Barnum MAMELUKES (who were so called from the fact that their barracks
were situated in the island of Roda in the Nile or Baliv). Ere long, how-
ever, the new guards succeeded in gaining possession of almost the whole
of the supreme power.
