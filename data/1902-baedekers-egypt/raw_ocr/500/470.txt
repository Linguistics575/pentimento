220 M. Monfalitt (rail. stat., p. 191) lies on the W. bank close
to the river, which must have made great eneroaehments here since
the end of the 18th century. Between Monfalt1t and Assitlt (26 M.
by river, only 17 M. by land) the Nile makes many curves.

Ma'ahdeh, a small village on the E. bank, lies on a narrow
strip of fertile land between the Nile and the S. end of the rocky
Gebel Abu Féda. The hills to the N.E. of Ma'abdeh contain tombs
of the Early Empire. To the S. is the Gebel Kumeh, with a quarry
exhausted in the reign of Sethos II. (inscription).

About 3% M. to the N.E. , on the plateau of the Arabian hills, is
the so- -ea11ed Crocodile Grotto, in which a large number of mummies of
crocodiles were found, besides human mummies and a celebrated papyrus
MS. containing fragments of Homer's Iliad. The expedition is not worth
the trouble, as practically nothing is to be seen except the charred remains
of the mummies of crocodiles. --... To the S.E. of Ma'abdeh lies the village
of ‘Arab el-U.tyat, with tombs and quarries.

On the E. bank are (227 M.) the three villages of Ihmi Mo-
hammad. To the N.E. of these, on the N. verge of a large and
fertile plain that extends S. to alm ost opposite Assit1t, lies the Coptic
village Dtr el- Gebrai (Gabmwi), containing a Greekinseription (dis-
covered by Mr. Harris) in the form of a dedication of the Lusitanian
Cohort, which served under Diocletian and Maximian, to Zeus,
Hercules, and Nike (Victoria). In the Gebel Mardg, a ridge about
11/2 hr. distant, are numerous roek-tombs belonging to princes and
grandees of the nome of the Hilerptnt Mountain'.

These tombs, mostly dating from the close of the Early Empire, are
divided into a N. E. and a S W. group, the former _,rohep1',,igi,r.1g b'0 temhs
" with inscriptions and representations), the latter about 4O (12 with re-
presentations). The most interesting are two of the S. E. group, situated
above the village of Der el-Grebrai,be10nging to Thaw and EIR, (11th Dyn. ),
princes of the nome of the Serpent Mounta' n and of the meme of Abydos.
Like the graves of Benihasan, these tombs contain interesting represen-
tations of handicraftsmen, 'ia'rviiriueiriiii,' f1shing and hunting scenes, etc.

Above Beni Mohammed the Nile makes several great bends and
is divided into two arms by the large island Ges''tret Behig. On the
E. arm lies (233 M.) Iilbnith (Abnoub), with 5800inhab. (4800 00pts)
and fine palm-groves. The mountains on the E. bank now reeede,
and the foot-hills of the Libyan chain approach the river, which is
here barred by the Dam of Assit1t (Assiout Barrage) now under.
construction, an imposing work intended to regulate the irrigation
of the provinces of Assitat, Minyeh, and Benisuef. It consists of
eight sections, the first and last of which have three arches and a
sluice, while the others have nine arches each. As at the Barrage
below Cairo o. ill), each arch can be shut by an iron door. The
dam is crossed by a carriage-road. ---. Immediately above the weir,
on the W. bank, is the efflux of the 2hralitm"tyeh Canal, the S. pro-
longation of the Baht Yt1suf (p. 210).

We land at (247 M.) el-Hamm, the palm- -enclosed harbour of
Assitt. Anembanked road, sh'aded by finetrees leadspastthe station
and handsome private and public buildings to the town in 1/4 hr.
