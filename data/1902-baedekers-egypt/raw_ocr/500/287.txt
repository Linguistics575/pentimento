68 Route 5. TOMBS OF THE MAMELUKES. Environs

continuation of the Muski (p. dll, renders it very easy of access.
A fine effect, especially by evening-light, is produced by the domes
and the peculiar. colouring of the valley and the opposite heights
of the Molsattam. To the W. are the city, the plain of the Nile, and
the Pyramids; to the N. lies the straggling suburb of 'Abbasiyeh
(p. 77); and at our feet are the Tombs of the Khalifs (p. 64), the
most conspicuous of which are the tomb-mosque of Wit Bey (p. fur,
to the left), with its dome and minaret, and the two domes and
two minarets of Sultan Barl.dsli o. 65).

The Tombs of the Mamelukes, to the S. of the Citadel, in-
cluding monuments of various periods, are most conveniently visited
via the Bill, el-lrartrfeh CPI. E, T), whence a good earriage-road leads
through the midst of the tombs to the 1.Ttysh er..Bisha (see below).
The tombs approach close to the city and extend as far as to the
slopes of the Mohattam. The older tombs are in much poorer
preservation than the Tombs of the Khalifs, owing to their con-
version into modern burial-plaees. Some are now represented only
by their minarets. A few are of architectural and artistic interest;
but historical data as to the names of their builders are entirely
wanting, for the extant inscriptions upon them are almost exclu-
sively verses of the Keran.

To the S. the imposing dome of the tomb of Imam Shefe'i
lea. 1240), of a bluish-grey colour, is conspicuous. Beside it is an
extensive modern neeropolis, ehiefly of family-tombs. The dome
itself and the Byzantine carvings and panelling on the lower part
of the interior walls are interesting.

Near it is the Hésh el-Basha, or family burial mosque, built
by Mohammed ‘Ali. The monuments (including those of Ibrahim
and 'Abbts L; 19.0) are in white marble, and were executed by
Greek and Armenian sculptors. The inscriptions and ornamenta-
tion are richly gilded and painted.

Eiectrt'c Tramway from the Place 'Atabet el-Khadra near the Ezbekiyeh,
see p. 27. A small Steamboat (fares 10, 5 pi.)p1ies every 20ao min. between
Old Cairo and Gizeh (p. 77), so that visitors may go on from the former
to visit the Museum or the Pyramids of Gizeh. Or with a visit to Old
Cairo may be combined that to the Tombs of the Mamelukes, returning
viii the Bdb et-/favd.feh (see above) and the Place Méhémet-Aii (fine view
from below of the mosque of Mohammed 'Ali). - Those who wish to visit
only the {fay esh-Sham’a (p. 71) may take the Helwan Railway as far as
the station of St. Georges (p. IM), which lies close by.

Tickets of admission to the mosque of'Amr, see p. 30.

Traversing the quarter of Isrna'iltyeh (p. 40) via the Shiri'a May"

the Mosque Fay' el-'Ain (p. 41; howling dervishes).
