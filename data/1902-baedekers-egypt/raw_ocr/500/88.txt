POPULAR FESTIVALS. lxxvii

The month Ramadan is succeeded by that of Shawwdl, on the first
three days of which is celebrated the first and minor festival of rejoicing,
called by the Arabs Ei-Hd e.s-djtttrhayyiv (the lesser feast), but better
known by its Turkish name of Beirctm. The object of the festival is to
give expression to the general rejoicing at the termination of the fast;
and, as at our Christmas, parents give presents to their children, and
masters to their servants at this festive season. Friends embrace each
other on meeting, and visits of ceremony are exchanged. During this fes-
tival the Khedive also receives his principal officials, ambassadors, etc.

At this season the traveller may also pay a visit to the cemetery by
the Bab en-Nasir, or to one of the others, where numerous Cairenes assemble
to place palm-branches or basilicum (tciluin) on the graves of their deceased
relatives, and to distribute dates, bread, and other gifts among the poor.

A few days after the Beiram, the pieces of the Kisweh, or covering
manufactured at Constantinople, at the cost of the Sultan, for the Ka'ba
(the most sacred sanctuary in the interior of the temple at Mecca), whither
it is annually carried by the pilgrims, are conveyed in procession to
the citadel, where they are sewn together and lined. The ceremonies
which take place on this occasion are repeated on a grander scale towards
the end of the month of Skawwdl (generally the 23rd), when there is a
gay procession of the escort which accompanies the pilgrimage caravan to
Mecca, and also takes charge of the Mahmal (p. lxxvi). On this occasion
every true believer in the prophet, if he possibly can, spends the whole day
in the streets. The women don their smartest attire. Many of the harem
windows are opened, and the veiled inmates gaze into the streets. The
chief scene of the ceremonies is the Ruméleh (Pl. F, 2), where a sumptuous
tent of red velvet and gold is pitched for the reception of the dignitaries.
The procession is headed by soldiers, who are followed by camels adorned
with gaily coloured trappings, and bearing cm their humps bunches of
palm-branches with Oranges attached. Each section of the cavalcade is
preceded by an Arabian band of music, the largest section being that which
accompanies the Takht Rawdn, or litter of the Emir el-1.Iagg, and the
next in order that of the Dem et-Eagg, or leader of the pilgrims, with his
attendants. Next follow various detachments of pilgrims and dervishes with
banners, and lastly the Mahmal (see p.1xxvi). A picturesque appearance
is presented by the camp of the assembled pilgrims (Haggi) at the Birket
el-Hagg (p. 108), whence the caravan finally starts for Mecca.

On the 10th of DhiHviggeh, the twelfth month, begins the great fes-
tival of El-Od el-Kebir, which resembles the lesser feast (el-nd es-sug-
hayyir) already mentioned. On this day, if on no other throughout the
year, every faithful Muslim eats a piece of meat in memory of the sacri-
fiee of Abraham, and the poor are presented with meat by the rich.

With the RISING OF THE NILE there are also connected several inter-
esting festivals, closely resembling those of the ancient period of the
Pharaohs, which even the Christian epoch was unable entirely to ob-
literate. As, however, they take place in summer, few travellers will
have an opportunity of witnessing them. As these festivals have refer-
ence to a regularly recurring phenomenon of nature, their dates are ne-
cessarily fixed in accordance with the Coptic solar reckoning of time, in-
stead of the variable Arabian lunar year. - The night of the ttth of the
Coptic month BaT1na (17th June) is called Lélet en-Nuleta, i.e. the 'night
of the drop', as it is believed that a drop from heaven for a tear of Isis,
according to the ancient Egyptian myth) falls into the Nile on this night
and causes its rise. The astrologers profess to calculate precisely the
hour of the fall of the sacred drop. The Cairenes spend this night on
the banks of the Nile, either in the Open air, or in the houses of friends
near the river, and practise all kinds of superstitious customs. One of
these consists in the placing of a piece of dough by each member of a
family on the roof of the house; if the dough rises, happiness is in store
for the person who placed it there, while its failure to rise is regarded
as a bad omen. 011 let June the river begins slowly to rise (comp.
p. 1). On the 27th of the Coptic month BaT1na (3rd July) the Menzdd‘i
en-Wil, or Nile-crier, is frequently heard in the morning, announcing to
