off, and the reddish tint which enlivened the face has almost dis-
appeared. A fragment of the beard lies on the ground beside the
Sphinx. But in spite of all injuries, it preserves an impressive
expression of strength and majesty: the eyes have a thoughtful, far-
away expression, the lips wear a half-smile, and the whole face, as
even 'Alodellatif remarked, is of graceful and beautiful type. The
entire height of the monument, from the crown of the head to the
pavement on which the fore-legs of the lion reit, is said to be 66 ft.
The ear, according to Mariette, is 41/2 ft., the nose 5 ft. 7 in., and
the mouth 7ft. 7 in. in length; and the extreme breadth of the
face is 13 ft. 8 inches. If the traveller stands on the upper part
of the ear, he cannot stretch his hand as far as the crown of the
head. There is a hollow in the head.

The Excavation of the Sphinx, so far as is now known, was first under-
taken by Thutmosis IV. (see below). During the Ptolemaic and Roman
periods the colossus was several times restored, and was highly admired
and revered, as numerous inscriptions upon it testify. It is all the more
curious, therefore, that the Sphinx is mentioned neither by Herodotus nor
by any later Greek traveller. The mutilations which now disfigure it date
from the Arab domination. In 1380 it fell a victim to the iconoclastic zeal
of a fanatic sh√©kh, and it was afterwards used as a target by the barbarous
Mamelukes. - In the present century, the Sphinx was first completely
excavated by Cavigh'a (p. 116), at the cost (3505.) of an English society.
He discovered the flight of steps which ascended to the stupendous mon-
ument, and also found between the paws of the lion a carefully laid
pavement, at the end of which next to the breast of the Sphinx rose a
kind of open temple. The latter was enclosed by two partitions, through
which ran a passage, in the middle of which was a small fig11re of a re-
cumbent lion, facing the Sphinx. In the background and at each side were
memorial stones erected by Thutmosis IV. and Ramses 11. (see below). The
Sphinx has also been excavated by Mariette, and in 1883 by Maspero.

Between the paws of the Sphinx, which are concealed by blocks
of limestone, stands an Altar, and in front of the breast of the
colossus is the Memorial Stone of Thutmosis IV., both of red granite.

On the upper part of the latter, to the right and left, appears Thut-
mosis IV., sacaOeing to the sun-god Harmachis, who is represented as a
Sphinx. The inscription below relates that the Pharaoh while a prince
hunting lions fell asleep one day in the shadow of the Sphinx, and that
the god appeared and commanded the prince to 'free him from the desert
sand that encumbered him'. As soon as Thutmosis ascended the throne,
he remembered his dream and caused the Sphinx to he excavated.

About 50 yds. to the S.E. of the Sphinx is situated the *Granite
Temple, erroneously called Temple of the Sphinx, but in reality the
sanctuary of the god 8oharis- Osiris. This large building constructed
of granite and alabaster, discovered by Mariette in 1803, is a fine
example of the simple and majestic architecture of a period when
the art of working the hardest kinds of stone had already attained
perfection. The exterior of the temple is still concealed by rubbish,
but the interior has been partly excavated.

Descending by a modern Passage (P1. aa) in steps, protected by
