DAMANHfIR. 3. Route. 21

The Lake Marcotis, or Marcia, as it was also called in ancient times,
bounds Alexandria on the S. side. In Straho's time it was filled from the
Nile by means of numerous canals, both from the S. and E., which
brought great traffie to this inland harbour, while the sea-harbour was
more important for the export trade. The lake, which lies 8 ft. below
the sea-level, was once surrounded by a luxuriantly fertile tract of
country, yielding excellent white wine, which has been extolled by
Horace and Virgil. During the Arabian and Turkish regime the waters
of the lake gradually subsided, but in 1801, during the siege of Alexan-
dria, the English cut through the neck ofland between the lake and the
sea, a little to the W. of Abulfir, thus laying an extensive and fertile
region under water and destroying about 150 villages. Mohammed 'Ali
did all in his power to repair the damage and to improve the environs of
Alexandria, but 100,000 acres of cultivable land are said still to be covered
by the sea. The water is now evaporated for the sake of its salt.

At (17 M.) Kafr ed-Dau/r the flrst eotton-fields appear (on the
right).

A narrow-gauge loop-line diverging here (three trains daily) serves
the villages of Sidi Ghazi, Kart eZ-Hanash, Abu el-3fatdmir, B6sh Issa (2200
inhab.), and Nediba, and rejoins the main line at Damanhilr (see below).

Several Arab villages are seen from thelofty railway-embankment.

381/2 M. Damanhor (Railway Hotel), the second station at which
the express stops (reached in 1 hr0, and the capital of the pro-
vince of 1leldreh, with 22,100 inhab. , was the ancient Egyptian
TimE-en-Hor (city of Horus], and the Roman Hermopolis Parva.
The town lies on an eminence and contains some tolerably sub-.
stantialbuildings. Among them are several manufaetories fer the
separation of the cotton from the seeds, and above them tower
several minarets. The Arabian cemetery lies close to the railway.

FROM DAMANHfJR TO MEgALLET Rih.r, 46 M., railway in 4 hrs. (fares 30,
18 pias.). - Beyond h'anht"tr and Raimuiniyeh the train crosses the Rosetta
arm of the Nile. - 13 M. Detsi11.r, a town with over 7000 inhab., on the
right bank of the Rosetta. arm. - Farther on we cross several canals. At
Katie (Kelline) diverges the braueh-line for Shirbin (p.159). - Several small
stations. - 46 ll. Mehallet Rail}. lies on the railway from Tan.ta to Nansi1va
(p. 159). - Damanhiir is also the starting-point of several LIGHT RAILWAYS:
1. To Teh el-Adriid (see below) viii, Ettehad (branch to Eihn Ferén) and
Dett'ngat (branch to Tad). - 2. Tu Teh eZ-Bdrcld viii, 8liubrakhtt [2746 inhab.),

below). -.-- 3. To Zartiin and 'Ag‘f (p. 22). - d. To Ifafr ed-Odauir (see above).

48 M. Saft et-Met/ik. About 3 M. to the S.E., near the modern
Nebtreh (hlebeirah), on the ancient Canopic arm of the Nile, lie the
ruins of Naueratis, a Creek commercial city, founded by Aahmes.
The ruins, discovered by Prof. Flinders Petrie and excavated in
1885, do not repay a visit.

531/2 M. Teh el-Bérad, a village with a large mound of ruins,
is the junction for a braneh-line skirting the W. coast of the Nile

delta. None of the express-trains stop here.

This branch-line is an alternative route to Cairo, but is of no im-
portance to tourists. There are only two trains daily fin 31/2 hrs.). The
stations are insignificant. The last One is Embdbeh (p. 76), beyond which
the line trusses the Nile by an iron bridge and enters Cairo (p. 24).

LIGHT RAILWAYs run to 2htmanhiir. viii Deltngat 0r Bhubrakhit (see
above) and to Kafr ‘Awdneh viii Bhattdid (see above).
