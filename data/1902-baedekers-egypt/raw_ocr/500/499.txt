and entered by narrow flights of steps or by openings concealed
by movable stone slabs. Their elaborate mural reliefs date from
the reign of Ptolemy XIII. Neos Dionysos, and are therefore the
oldest as well as the best executed decorations in the temple. The
arrangement and entrances of the crypts are shown in the small
Plans 11, III, and 1v. Magnesium wire or a lamp will be found
useful in examining the painted walls.

In Crypt No. 4, which we enter through a square opening in the pave-
ment, are several narrow chambers, on the walls of which are depicted
the sacrificial vessels, ornaments, and images of the gods that were pre-
served here. The colouring of the admirably executed reliefs is remark-
ably fresh. On the right wall of the second room to the right is an
interesting relief of King Pepi (6th Dyn.) kneeling and offering a golden
statuette of the god Ehi to four images ofHathor. On the walls of Crypt
No. 7 (entered through an opening in the pavement of the small sacri-
iieial court), Ptolemy XIII. appears presenting gifts (chiefly ornaments) to
various gods. - Crypts Not. 2 'e 2., arranged above each other in two
stories, are also interesting; they are most conveniently accessible from
Room VII.

We now return to the flrst antechamber, and ascend one of
the Staircases (p. 2128), which lead hence to the roof of the temple.

The EAST STAIRCASE, which ascends straight to the roof with easy
steps, is dark, being lighted only by a single opening in the wall. The
WEST STAIRCASE is a kind of spiral staircase, with ten rectangular bends
t0 the right, lighted by several windows, with tasteful symbolical repre-
sentations of the sun shining through them. The walls of both stair-
cases are embellished with reliefs of the ceremonial procession of the
priests with the images ot' Hathor and her fellow-gods at the great New
Year's Festival. The left wall presents us with a view of the procession
ascending from the lower rooms of the temple, the right wall shows it
descending. The priests are headed by the king; some of them wear
masks representing the lesser deities. After completing the circuit of the
lower rooms, the procession ascended to the roof of the temple, in order
that 'the goddess Hathor might be united with the beams of her father
RE" (the sun-god). - The W. staircase passes a small room (situated aheve
the storeruom adjoining the second antechamber), with three windows
looking into the court. Higher up is a small court with two rooms opening
off it, eorreqponding to the chambers for the cult of Osiris on the E. side
of the terrace (see below).

We now reach the Temple Roof, which has various levels, the
highest being above the great vestibule or pronaos (p. 229). At
the S.W. angle of the lower terrace, which we reach first, stands a
small open Pavilion, supported by 12 Hathor-columns. Adjoining
the terrace on the N. are three rooms, situated above the chambers
to the left of the smaller hypostyle hall. These were used in the
worship of the slain and risen Osiris, as curious representations
and numerous inscriptions indicate. The second room, separated
from the flrst by pillars, formerly contained the famous Zodiac of
Dendera (now In the Biblioth√©que Nationale at Paris), the only
circular representation of the heavens found in Egypt. The re-
maining portion of the ceiling still shows two figures of the goddess
of heaven. - A flight of steps ascends from the N.W. of the terrace
to the roof of the first antechamber and thence to the still higher
roof of the hypostyle hall. Thence a modern iron staircase leads to
