were restored. Ramses 11., the great-
est builder among the Pharaohs,
could not refrain from adding to the
temple at Luxor. He added a large
colonnaded court in front of the
completed temple; he 'usurped'
the ancient sanctuary of Thut..
mosis 111., and replaced the old re-
liefs with new ones; and he erected
a massive pylon, with obelisks and
colossal statues, the entrance of
which was formed next the sane-
tuary of Thutmosis, so that the
longer axis of the main temple was
altered. The total length of the
temple was now 284 yds. Later cen-
turies brought few alterations to the
temple of Luxor. After theintrodue-
tion of Christianity it was converted
into a church. A modern wall on
the side next the river protects it
against damage from inundation.
In front of the principal Pylon
(Pl. P-P) of the temple were 6 Colos-
sal Statues of Ramses IL, 2 sitting
and 4 standing, of which only the
two sitting and the westernmost of
the others are now in position. The
sitting figures are about 45 ft. in
height; that on the E. is buried
breast-high in rubbish. In front
of these seated tlgures rose two
Obelisks of pink granite, one of ----------
whieh (theW.) now adorns the Place E '. 2 ' ll t: tr
de la Concorde at Paris. Its base, . . . lol . o o
adorned on one side with three pray- " t . . ' 5 . . .
ing apes, still remains in situ. The
inscriptions name Ramses the Pha-
raoh, with many pretentious titles,
as the founder of this gorgeous
building erected in honour of Am-.
mon in S. Opet. The faces of these
obelisks, like those of most others,
are slightly convex, as the priestly
architects observed that a flat sur-
face was apt to appear concave in a
strong light.
