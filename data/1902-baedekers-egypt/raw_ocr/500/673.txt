The largest of these dates from the reign of Thutmosis III. We first
enter a chamber with a pointed roof. The representations on the
walls (much deflled by bats) show Thutmosism, in intercourse with
various deities or ssaeritieing to them. Among these deities is in-
eluded King Usertesen III., who was worshipped in Nubia as a god.
Behind is a vaulted room, with a recess containing three statues,

farther on, are more interesting. On each side of the entrance are
pompous inscriptions of Thutmosis III.
