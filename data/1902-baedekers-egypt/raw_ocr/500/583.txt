Enné, prince and overseer of the granaries of Ammon, who died after

a long life in the reign of Am'enoPhis 111. (18th Dyn.).

lines to guide the artist's hand); Ennii receiving tribute (only two rows

Most of the other graves, all on the mountain-slope, have been
filled up and are comparatively uninteresting. The *VIEW from the
top includes the Ramesseum and the statues of Memnon and extends
across the Nile to the buildings of Luxor and Karnak; to the left
are the mountains, with the temple of Dér el-bahri at their feet.

We ascend again to the right to No. 26, the Tomb of Heremheb, who
administered the entire royal revenue under Thutmosis IV. - First Room.
To the right and left of the entrance is a banquet-scene. On.the left rear-
wall, Haremheb presents to the king the contributions of the peasants;
above are scribes, registering the peasants, who are arranged in companies
and headed by standard-bearers. On the right rear-wall the tribute from
the Syrians and negroes is brought to the king. On the left wall of the
Corridor the funeral rites are shown.

Close to it is No. 27, the Tomb of Zenen, a fan-bearer on the king''s
right hand, and adjoining this, but turned towards the N., the Tomb of
Amenhotep (No. 102), secomi prophet of Ammon, and of his wife Roi.
The paintings in this include a scale in which gold rings are being
weighed, various workmen, one of whom is making a Sphinx, clerks with
tables writing out the crops, and a statue with a ram"s head; on the
right, music and dancing.

of the soldiers under Thutmosis IV. - First Room. On the rear-wall, to
the right, the king receives through Zenen the tribute of the Syrians; ad-
jacent is the deceased inspecting tribute brought to him (in the lower

of Queen Makere, hut in a very ruinous Mate, Adjacent is the recently
found tornb of another of Makere's architects.

ra-seneb (No. 34), who was chief priest of Ammon in the reign of Thut-
inosis m., with Asiatios bringing tribute, handicraftsmen, etc. This tomb
