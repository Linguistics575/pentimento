Horus, before Hather and Horus, 'Uniter of the two lands', and be-
fore other gods of Edfu. On the front of the pylon-towers are four
wide incisions, two on each side of the central portal. These were
intended to support large tlag-staffs, which were farther secured
by means of clamps fastened in the holes still to be seen in the
masonry directly above. The small rectangular apertures in the
towers served to admit light and air to the chambers and staircases
within (see below).

A passage, 5-6 ft. in height, leads, through each pyIOn-tower to the
outside of the stone girdle-wall, which is embellished with colossal reliefs
(Ptolemy XI. before the gods of Edfu) and bears the inscriptions mentioned
at p. 315. In front of the W. tower lie two colossal hawks in dark
granite. One is quite shattered; the other has the figure of a priest in

the costume of the ist cent. B.C. before it, and bore a crown fastened in
the square hole on the head.

The Court, between the pylon and the great hypostyle hall, is
a spacious enclosure, paved with broad flags, and surrounded on
three sides by a covered colonnade of 32 columns. In this court rose
the great altar upon which offerings were made to the gods of Edfu
in presence of the assembled people. The columns supporting the
roof of the colennade are embellished with rich floral and palm
capitals. The incised reliefs on the shafts show the king before
Horus and the other gods of Edfu; the name of the king has not
been inserted in the inscriptions. On the rear-walls of the colon-
nades are three rows of large reliefs, showing the Pharaoh (Ptolemy
Soter II. or Ptolemy Alexander) in communion with the gods or
triumphing over his foes in the guise of the god Horus. The same
representations occur over and over again in wearisome repetition
throughout the temple.

On the S. wall (P1. a), to the left of the entrance: 1. The king, wear-
ing the crown of Lower Egypt, quits his palace in order to visit the
temple; a priest offers incense in front of him. 2 Horus and Thout, at
the entrance to the temple, pour the water of consecration up0n the king.

- These scenes are repeated to the right of the entrance (P1. b), where,
however, the king wears the crown of Upper Egypt.

The doors to the right and left of a and b lead to the staircases
in the interior of the pylon (ascent, see p. 318). The E. and W.
exits (P1. c) are built up.

The Back of this court is formed by the front of the great hypo-
style hall,which is crowned by a concave cornice. On each side of
the large portal are three balustrades between the columns. Upon
these, facing the court, are reliefs representing Euergetes II. with
pendent arms or offering sacrifice to Hathor of Dendera (on the two
central balustrades) 01' to the hawk-headed Horus of Edfu (on the
others).

The Vestibule, or Pronaos, has 12 columns with elaborate
floral capitals. The ceiling is covered with astronomical represent-
ations, 110w blackened beyond recognition. On the walls are four
rows of incised reliefs, showing Euergetes saerifieing to the gods
and performing other religious rites, such as the ceremonies at
