side are the village of Gizeh (p. 77) and the station of the same
name on the Upper Egyptian railway. The road makes a curve,
crosses the railway {tramway-station), and then leads straight towards
the Pyramids, Which are still nearly 5 M. distant. Prettily situated
in a group of trees to the right of the road is the tomb of a shékh.
011 the left lie the huts of two fellahin villages, E.t- Tatbiyeh and
El-hlhn et-.Aswad (tramway-station). The fields on each side are
intersected by canals and cuttings, containing more or less water
according to the season. Small white herons, erroneously supposed
to be ibises, and vultures with light and dark plumage are frequently
observed here. The huge angular forms of the Pyramids now loom
through the morning mist, and soon stand out in clear outlines,
with all the injuries they have sustained daring the lapse of ages.

A few hundred yards before the road begins to ascend, it is pro-
teeted against the eneroaohments of the sand by a wall 5 ft. in
height. On the right are the extensive buildings of the Mena Home
Hated (p. 250; to the left is the terminus of the Electric Tramway.
The road winds up the steep N. slope of the plateau on which the
Pyramids stand. On an eminence in the desert to the right rises
the Eremitage, the villa of the Italian Abbale-Pasha. To the left
is a Viceregat Kiosk (Pl. a, p. 117).

TICKETS for the inspection of the Pyramids and other monuments
are sold in a Small Kiosk beside the viceregal kiosk, where a1 0 guides
(Beduins) are assigned to each party. For the ascent of the Great Pyramid
10 pias.; for a visit to the interior of the Pyramid, 10 pias.-, visit to
the other objects of interest 5 pias. (but with the aid of our plan, the
ticket and guide for this last item may easily be dispensed with). For
the entire expedition, including the ascent of the Great Pyramid and the
visit to its interior, the charge is 20 pias. Balyshtsh is entirely optional,
though a gratuity of a few pias. is customary. But no attention should
be paid to the begging of the Beduins. and visitors are advised to have
noth.ing to do with the vendors of so- -called 'antiquities' (almost invariably
spurioos; the fossil sea- -urehins or t1y.pea.steyt offered here are said to be

found in a mioeene deposit near 22wiyet er. rAryan, 21/4 M. to the S. of
the Sphinx).

The "Pyramids of Gizeh form one of five groups of pyramids
within the precincts of the Neeropolis of the ancient capital city of
Memphis (p. 131) which stand on the margin of the plateau of the
Libyan desert, along a line about 20M. in length. Southwards follow
the groups of Zthviyet el-rArytin and Abuttr (p. 129) 8alslMrao.l33j,
and Dahshfw (p.153). The fifth group, that of Abu Roash (p.128)
lies to the N. of the Pyramids of Gizeh. The Arab word for a
pyramid is haram (pl. ahrdm).

The Pyramids of Gizeh rank among the oldest monuments of
human industry, and their eolossal proportions extort from us to-
day the same astonishment that was felt in antiquity by Greek
and Roman travellers. We marvel not only at the technical know-
ledge and ability of the Egyptians, but also at the might of their
kings, who must have had absolute control over the labour of
thousands of their subjects, in order to be able to rear such monu-
