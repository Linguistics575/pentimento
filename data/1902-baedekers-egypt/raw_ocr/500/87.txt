of the Koran. The proeession usually enters the city by the Bdb en- -Nas1-
(p.62J_.1n 1%-2 hrs. it reaches the Rumeleh (p. 51), the large ope'n
space in front of the citadel, from which last twelve cannon- -shots are
fired as a salute. The c01tege then sweeps round the Ruméleh, and fin-
ally enters the citadel by the Bab el- Wezir (P1. E, 2). The departure of
the pilgrims (p.1xxvii) is attended with similar ceremonies.

The great festival of the 316rnn EN-N1imr, the birthday of the prophet,
is celebrated at the beginning of Itabit el-tttmotel, the third month. The
preparations for it begin on the second day of the month, and the most
important ceremOnies take place on the evening of the eleventh. The
city, and particularly the scene of the festival, is then illuminated by
means of lamps hung on wooden stands made f0r the purpose. Proces-
sions of dervishes (p. Ixx) parade the streets with flags by day, and with
lamps hoisted on poles by night. On this evening the sellers of sweet-
meats frequently exclaim - 'A grain of salt for the eye of him who will
not bless the Prophet!' The Odseh, or ceremony of riding over the der-
vishes, also took place on the eleventh of this month. SOme fifty der-
vishes or more lay close together on the ground, and allowed the shékh
of the Sa'diyeh dervishes on horseback to ride over them.Accide11ts
rarely happened, although the horse trod on every one of the prostrate
figures. During this ceremony the spectators shouted incessantly, ‘Allah-
1rM-M-M11-1aiht.' This barbarous custom was forbidden by the Khedive
Tewfik, and the ceremOnies are confined to the procession of the shekh and
the reading of the Koran in the Khedive s tent. At night a great zikr
is performed by the dervishes (p.1xxiJ. On this festival, as on all the
other molids" , the jugglers, buffoons, and other ministers 'of amusement,
ply their calling with great success (comp. p. xxivJ.

1n the fourth month, that of Rabi el- Akhiy (et- -ttini), occurs the peeu-
1iarly solemn festival of the birthday or Wdlid of Hosén, the prophet's
grandson, the principal scene of which is the mosque of Hosen, where
the head of Hosen is said to be interred. This festival lasts iiiii'e/ days
and fourteen "nights, the most important day being always a Tuesday (yam
et-tetdta). On this occasion the 'flurdniyeh Derm'shes (p. Ixx) sometimes
go through their hideous performance of chewing and swallowing burning
charcoal and broken glass, and their wild dances. 011 the chief days, and
on their eves, great crowds congregate in and around the mosque. On
these occasions the Keran is read aloud to the people, the streets adjoining
the mosque are illuminated the shops are kept open, and story- tellers,
jugglers, and others of the same class attract numerous patrons.

In the middle of Regeb, the seventh month, is the Matt'd of Seytdeh
Zénab ('Our Lady Zenab J, the granddaughter of the prophet. The fes-
tival, which lasts fourteen days, the most important being a Tuesday, is
celebrated at the mosque of the Seiyideh Zenab (p. 56) where she is said
to be buried. - On the 27th of this month is the Létet el- Jfi'e ag or night
of the ascension of the prophet, the celebration of which takes place
outside the Bab el-'Adawi, in the N. suburb of Cairo.

On the first, or sometimes on the seeond, Wednesday of Sha‘bdn, the
eighth month, the Métid of Imam 8tuiteti, is commemorated the centre of
attraction being the burial- -place of El- Karafeh (p. 68). This festival is
1y1merously attended, as most of the Cairenes belong to the sect of Imam
Shiiteq (p.1xxJ. The ceremonies are the same as at other molids.

The month of Ramadan (p.1xix), the ninth, is the month of fasting,
which begins as soon as a Muslim declares that he has seen the new
moon. The fast is strictly observed during the day, but the faithful in-
demnify themselves by eating, drinking, and smoking throughout the
greater part of the night. At dusk the streets begin to be thronged, the
story- -te11ers at the cafes attract large audiences, and many devotees ar
semble at the mosques. The eve of the 27th of the month is considered
peculiarly holy. It is called the Ltlet el- Kadr, or 'night of honour', owing
to the tradition that the Koran was sent down to Mohammed 011 this
night. During this sacred night the angels descend to mortals with bleSS-
ings, and the portals of heaven stand open, affording certain admission to
the prayers of the devout.
