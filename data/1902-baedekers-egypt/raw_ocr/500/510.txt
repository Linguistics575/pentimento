Sport. Sportsmen may have an opportunity of shooting a iackal, the
best time and place being at and after sunset near Biban el- Muluk or the
Ramesseum. An experienced hunter is to be found at the Luxor Hotel.
Hyamas are sometimes shot on the Karnak side. In March numerous quail
are found here.

On each side of the Nile, here interrupted by three islands,
stretches a wide belt of fertile land, bounded both on the E. and
W. by ranges of hills, overtopped by finely shaped peaks, especially
011 the E., where the ridge retires farther from the stream than on
the W. The verdant crops and palms which everywhere cheer the
traveller as soon as he has quitted the desert, the splendid hues that
tinge the valley every morning and evening, the brilliant, 11nelouded
sunshine that bathes every object even in the winter-season, lend
to the site of ancient Thebes the appearance of a wonderland, richly
endowed with the' gifts of never-failing fertility. Most of the ruined
temples are situated in the level district and are reached by the
waters of the Nile when the inundatious are at their highest; while
the tombs are hewn in the flanks of the hills, where their dark open-
ings are so numerous, that the E. slope of the Libyan range might
be aptly compared to a piece of cork or to a honeycomb.

On the right (E.) bank lies Luror, now a town of 11,000 inhab.
(over 2600 Copts), the chief tourist-centre in Upper Egypt. The
name is derived from the Arabic el- J.ruylr (p1. of el-lrtr.sr) and means
'the castles', having reference to the extensive temple within which
part of the place was built. Near the temple traces of an antique
structure on the river-rank may still be seen, though it is gradually
being washed away by the annual inundations. To the N. ofLuxor
extend the immense ruins of Kamak, formerly connected with it
by the streets of the city. Even under the Pharaohs the Temple of
Ammon, the chief god of Thebes, was considered the most striking
creation of an age peculiarly famous for architectural achievements.
To this day no other building in the world can match its dimensions.
Farther to the N. is another extensive temple-site at f1fedam0t
(p. 260), which must be regarded as occupying the site of a suburb
of Thebes.

On the left (W) bank was the Neeropolis, with vaults in the rock
and tombs on the desert-soil, adjoined by many mortuary temples
and dwelling -houses. Even in antiquity the Tombs of the Kings
o. 262] were reckoned among the chief sights of ancient Thebes.

The HISTORY of Thebes under the Early Empire is veiled in
uncertainty. The Egyptian name for the town was Wiset, or more
shortly Net, 'the city', whence the scriptural name No or No-Amon
t'eity', 'city of Ammon'). The W- bank was known as 'the West of
Wgset' or 'the West of the city'. No satisfactory explanation has
