The Third Pyramid, named by the Egyptians Neter-Menkearr7
('Divine is 3fenkewré'), was erected by Menkewa-E, the Mykerinos of
Herodotus and the Mencheres of Manetho. Its present perpendicular
height (Pl. B E) is 204 ft., its former height (B C) was 219 ft.; the
side of the base (A A) is 3561/2 ft.-, the present height (A BA) of the
sloping sides is 2633/4 ft., being originally (A CA) 2793/4 ft.; these
rise at an angle of Mo. The rock on which the Pyramid stands has
a shelving surface, and the necessary horizontal site was formed by
building up a pedestal of enormous blocks, instead of by removing
a portion of the rock. The stones of which the Pyramid is constructed
are remarkably large and well hewn. The upper part of its incruste-
tion was of limestone blocks, the lower part of granite, left partly
unpolished. The granite covering is in good preservation, especially
on the N, and W. sides. On the E. side are relies of the usual

temple of the dead.

The Interior is easily accessible. The entrance is on the N. side. A
Qassage ac descends at an angle of 26° 2' to a distance of 1041/2 ft., being
lined with red granite where it passes through the masonry from a to b,
and then penetrating, the solid rock from b to c. From c a horizontal pass-
age cd leads to an antechamber f', 7 ft. in height, 12 ft, in length, 10 ft.
in width, and decorated with door-shaped ornaments. Beyond this cham-
ber it passes three trap-doors g, descends slightly from h to d (gradient M),
a distance of 411/2 ft., and finally descends to the chamber e, in which
the sarcophagus uf than Irina “mu fa,,rtil This tthaanhe.r is 441/2 ft. long,
