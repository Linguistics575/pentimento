ments. Some conception of the enormous amount of labour involved
may be obtained, when we learn that, according to Prof. Flinders
Petrie's calculation, about 2,300,000 separate blocks of stone, each
containing 40 cubic ft., were required for the Pyramid of Kheops,
and that nearly all were quarried on the E. bank of the Nile and
had to be conveyed through the plain to the ilesert-plateau.

The Construction of the Pyramids has been admirably described
by Herodotus, the earliest writer on the subject, who visited Egypt

about 170-h60 BA).

Herodotus states (II, 125) that 'there were about 100,000 men employed
annually for three months in constructing the Great Pyramid of Kheops f.
They first made the road for the transport of the stones from the Nile
to the Libyan Mts.; for the length of the road amounts to five stadia
(1017 yds.), its breadth is ten fathoms (FO ft.), and its height, at the
highest plaees, is eight fathoms (48 ft.), and it is constructed entirely of
polished stone with figures engraved on It H. Ten years were thus con-
sumed in making this road and the subterranean chambers (for the coffins).
The construction of the Pyramid itself occupied twenty years. Each of
the four sides measures eight plethra (820 ft.), and the height is the
same. It is covered with polished stones, well jointed, none of which is
less than thirty feet long. This pyramid was first built in the form ofa
flight of steps. After the workmen had completed the pyramid in this
form, they raised the other stones (used for the incrustation) by means
of machines, made of short beams, from the ground of the first tier of
steps; and after the stone was placed there it was raised to the second
tier by another machine; for there were as many machines as there were
tiers of steps; or perhaps the same machine, if it was easily moved, was
raised from one tier to the other, as it was required forlifting the stones.
The highest part of the pyramid was thus finished first (by smoothing),
the parts adjoining it were taken next, and the lowest part, next to the
earth, was completed last. It was recorded on the pyramid, in Egyptian
writing, how many radishes, unions, and roots of garlic had been distrib-
uted among the workmen, and ifl rightly remember what the interpreter
who read the writing told me 'Ht, the muney they cost amounted to six-
teen hundred talents of silver (upwards of 350,000l.). If this was really
the case, how much more must. then have heen spent on the iron with
which they worked, and on the food and clothing of the workmen.'

In modern times many eager discussions have been held as to
the mode in which the Pyramids were erected and the meaning of
the account given by Herodotus. The most important questions
seem to be: (f) How could Kheops, when he ascended the throne
and chose an area of 82,000 sq. yards for his monument, know
that his reign would be so unusually long as to enable him to com-
plete it? (2) If one of the builders of the great pyramids had died

+ According to Prof. Flinders Petrie, these three months fell during the
inundation, when field-work was at a stand-still and the services of 100,000
men for transporting the stones could be easily eno.ugh obtained. The
stone cutters and masons were probahly engaged all the year round in
the quarries and on the pyramid itself.

it This route is still traceable. It terminated on the E. side of the
Pyramid of Kheops (see Plan and p. 127).

fff It is unlikely that the interpreters, who attended travellers like the
dragomans of the present day, were able to read hieroglyphics. They
probably repeated mere popular traditions regarding the pyramids and
other monuments, with embellishments and exaggerations of their own.
