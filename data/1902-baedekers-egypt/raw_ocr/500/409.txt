nearly the same, Lepére estimated that of the Red. Sea to be nearly
33 ft. higher than that of the Mediterranean.

In 1836 Ferdinand de Lesseps (i805-94() came to Cairo as a
young consular éléve, and there had his attention called to Lepbre's
Mémoire regarding the scheme of connecting the two seas, which
led him to consider its great importance, although Lepére himself
doubted its feasibility. In 1838 he made the acquaintance of Lieut.
Waghorn, an Englishman (p. 173], whose zealous advocacy of the
construction of a route between Europe and India via Egypt stim-
ulated his zeal for a similar project. In 1841 and 1847 Linant
Bey, the vieeroy's engineer of water-works, and Messrs. Stephenson,
Negrelli, and Bourdaloue, demonstrated the inaccuracy of Lepére's
calculations, and proved that the level of the two seas was nearly
the same, so that the construction of a canal between them was
possible. In 1854 M. de Lesseps, having matured his plan, laid it
before Sa'id Pasha, who was then Viceroy, and who determined to
carry it out. Diffieulties were thrown in the way of the enterprise
by the English government during Lord Palmerston's ministry,
but on 5th Jan., 1856, permission to begin the work was formally
granted by the Viceroy. A considerable time, however, elapsed be-
fore the necessary capital was raised, and it was not till 22nd April,
1859, that the work was actually begun. The Viceroy undertook to
pay many of the current expenses, and provided 25,000 workmen,
who were to be paid and fed by the company at an inexpensive rate,
and were to be relieved every three months. In order to provide
these workmen with water, 4000 water-easks suitable for being
carried by camels had to be constructed, and 1600 of these animals
were daily employed in bringing them supplies, at a cost of 8000 fr,
per day. On 29th Dee., 1863, the fresh-water canal (p. 162) was
completed, so that the company was thenceforth relieved of the
enormous expense of supplying the workpeople with water. The
hands now employed, among whom were a number of Europeans,
were less numerous, and much of the work was done by machinery,
of 22,000 horse-power in all.

011 18th March, 1869, the water of the Mediterranean was at
length allowed to flow into the nearly dry, salt-encrusted basins of
the Bitter Lakes, the N. parts of whichlay 26-310 ft. below the
level of the Mediterranean, while the s. parts required extensive
dredging operations. The opening of the Suez Canal was inaugurated
on 16th Nov., 1869, and the magnifieent festivities which took place
on the occasion are said to have cost the Khedive no less than
4,200,000l.

The cost of constructing the canal amounted to about 19 million
pounds sterling, of which 12,800,000 was paid by the shareholders,
while the rest of the sum was almost entirely contributed by the
Khedive. In 1875, however, the British Government acquired
177,000 of the Khedive's shares for a sum of 4,000,0001. The Suez
