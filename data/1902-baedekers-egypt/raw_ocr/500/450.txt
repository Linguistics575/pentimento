to Atrsitlt. mimarmuyficR, 18. Route. 195

Thrice a month a, camel-post leaves Jrraght gha for [3-4 days) the ‘Small
Oasis' of Babriyeh, also called Oasis of Behnesa, because it is connected
with Behnesa. by another desert-route (comp. p. 190).

The Nile-channel is very wide here (several islands); farther on
both banks are flat. - At (113 M.) /illiar6na (Charounah; E. bank)
are tombs of the end of the 6th Dynasty. Near Rtyrtt el-Alimar, to
the s., are the ruins of a large temple built by Ptolemy 1., and
tombs of a late period, belonging to the town of Ilet-seteni, in the
Cynopolitan nome. - 118 M. Bent Mazar (W. bank) is a railway-
station (p. 189). - About 3 M. farther up, close to the E. bank, are
the iusignificant remains of Shékh eI-Fadhl, near which is He;-
matha. The discovery of a large number of dog-mummies here
proves that we are standing on the site of the necropolis of Cyno-
polis, the ‘city of the dogs'. Several trough-like hollows and clefts
have been found here, some of which, in the rocks, are of con-
siderable size; but no inscriptions have been discovered. Cynopolis
itself, in which Anubis was worshipped and dogs were held sacred,
lay, according to Ptolemy, on an island in the Nile.

Opposite, 11/4 M. from the W. bank, lies El-Keis, the Egyptian
Kai's, which superseded Cynopolis. F'arther to the W., 011 the verge
of the Libyan desert, lies Behnesa (pl 189).

Near (1331/2 M.) J.rolosaneh(yroloma; rail. stat., p.190], on the
W. bank, the Nile divides into three arms, forming two considerable
islands. Opposite (E. bank) lies 8urartyeh (el-8eririeli). To the N.
and S. quarries are worked in the limestone rock. Among the
quarries is a small Rock Chapel, built under Merenptah and dedi-
cated to Hathor. 0n the external wall is Ramses III. between Hathor
and another deity.

On the W. bank lies the railway-station of Samalltt (p. 190). A
little farther to the s., at the mouth of a side-valley on the E.
bank, rise the steep rocky sides of the Gebel et-Yr (‘bird-moun-
tain'), with an extensive flat top bearing the Coptic convent DE?
el-Bukm, also known as Dtrr el-tAdra (convent of the Virgin).
Visitors are drawn up a vertical cleft in the rock by means of a
Windlass (truism). The convent, which consists of a group of miser-
able huts, occupied not only by the monks but by laymen with
their wives and children, is surrounded by a wall of hewn stone,
erected in the Roman period. The foundation of the church is
ascribed to the Empress Helen; the sanctuary is hewn in the solid
rock and possesses a gate, now half-buried, adorned with Byzan-
tine ornamentation.

A legend, recorded by Maigrizi, relates that on the saints day of the
convent all the bukir birds in the neighbourhood a=sembled here and thrust
their heads, one after the other, into the cleft of the rock until One died.

These birds are described as being black and white, with a black neck
ringed near the head. The convent is named also per t2-Buktr after them.

On the E. bank, about 1/2 hr. farther on and 1 M. from the river,
lies the village of Tehneh e.t-Tahorta (Tehneh of the mill'), with
two groups of ancient tombs.
