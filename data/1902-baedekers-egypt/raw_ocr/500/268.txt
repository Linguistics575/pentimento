From the E. outer court we enter the chief Ltwtn (see below."
or sanctuary, and thence proceed to the inner quadrangle or Sal”
el-t7dmi'a, 99 yds. square. With the exception of the ceilings, whicl
had to be restored in order to protect the interior, the building hat
been preserved almost intact, though its fitting up has been frequently
altered. The most important renovations were carried out by Lagin
afterwards Sultan Mamitir. It was he who erected the mausoleum-
like Dome (P1. 6) in the centre of the court, covering an octagona'
basin on the site of an old well. The court is surrounded by a double
arcade, except on the sanctuary side, where the arcade is quadruple
while a fifth row of arches collapsed in 1875. Pointed openings
above the pillars serve to lighten the weight of the masonry, ant
the facades are crowned by a medallion-frieze with open -wor1
pinnacles. The pillars are polished and have their corners rounded
into q11arter-eo1umns, with delicately carved capitals. By one o:
the pillars of the sanctuary is a marble tablet bearing the chartel
of the mosque in ancient Arabic (Cutie) characters. The origina'
roof of the arcades, of which remains are extant above the dilrkeh,
was made of beams of date-palm, overlaid with sycamore wood,
Along the top of the walls runs a frieze of sycamore wood, inscribec'
with texts from the Koran. According to the testimony of Mahr’iz:
this wood belonged to Noah's Ark, which was found by Ibn Tuhir
on Mt. Ararat.

The Prayer Recess LPI. 5) has fine Byzantine capitals and remain:
of gilded mosaic. The wooden cupola in front of it has lately bee1
restored. The Pulpit erected by Melik e1-Manylr in 1298 stil
deserves close attention, though it has been robbed of its charac-
teristie panels carved in ebony and ivory. These were sold in Europe,
and most of them are now in South Kensington Museum.

The Minaret CPI. T), in the N.W. outer court, is built of stone.
instead of brick, and also shows peculiarities in its square lowes
section and elsewhere. The ascent is easy, and the top commands
an admirable *View. To the S. are the pyramids of Dahshilr, and
to the W. the huge pyramids of Gizeh; the valley of the Nile " fan
as the Delta lies before us; to the E. rise the picturesque slopes of
the Moliattam and the Citadel; and in the foreground all round lies
Cairo, with its houses, mosques, palaces, and gardens. From the
minaret access is gained to the concrete roofs of the arcades, pro-
tected by elegant balustrades; a walk round these is recommended.

Outside the entrance to the mosque we turn to the right, and
after about 140 paces, to the right again. Passing the S.W. side o)
the mosque, and turning a little to the left, we traverse several
lanes and alleys, all in the old quarter of IGI'at el-Kebsh (p. 54]),
and reach the small, but once handsome -
