Two doors lead from Vestibule III to the two SANCTUARIES, of
which that to the left (Pl. H) was dedicated to Haroé'ris, that to the
right (Pl. 8) to Sable. In each is a pedestal of dark granite on which
the sacred boat with the image of the god was placed. Beside and
behind these chapels are smaller apartments with crypts.

Two small side-doors lead from the great hall to an INNER Pass-
AGE round the temple proper, in the innermost part of which are
seven doors opening into as many CHAMBERS (Pl. I-VII). In the
central Room IV is a staircase to the upper story. In some of the
others are unfinished sculptures [reliefs and inscriptions), illustrate
ing various stages in the progress of such works.

on the terrace in front of the great temple lay a small Birth
House, facing towards the S., and now in a most ruinous condition.
It was built or restored by Euergetes II. Among the extant reliefs
one (at Pl. o) deserves notice. It represents Euergetes II. with two
gods sailing in a boat through the marshes, which are bordered with
papyrus-plants thronged with birds; to the left is the ithyphallic
god Min-Ammon-RE. - On the S. side is a subterranean staircase
(Pl. p) leading to the river, on the bank of which is a Nilometer
