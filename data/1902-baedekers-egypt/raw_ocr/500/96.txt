the help of Gyges, King of Lydia. The foreign garrisons
were expelled; the authority of the small native princes
was gradually curbed; and Egypt was again united. Ta-

to the ancient times appeared also in other departments, spch as
literature, the spelling of inscriptions, and even the titles of offi,-
cials, so that the period of the 26th Dyn. may be styled the Egypt-
ian Renaissance.
