Cabs (comp. p, xvii), generally good victorias, with two horses, are
always abundant in the quarters near the Ezbekiyeh. Closed cabs (landaus)
are usually to be obtained only on special Order and at higher fares. The
hirer should make a special bargain in every case, especially for drives
of any length 01- to points not adequately provided for in the tariff. Fares
should never be paid in advance.

CAB TARIFF for 1-3 pers. (each pers. extra 1 pias. and each piece of
luggage beside the driver, 1 pias.).

ment Buildings (P1. D, g, p. M)); 1 Kil. 3 pias., 2 kil. k pias. If the
cab is dismissed beyond the radius 1 pias. more is charged for each kilo-
metre or fraction of a kilometre. A stoppage of 5 min. is allowed free,
but longer halts are charged for at the rate of 1pias. per 1/4 hr.

of the cab and the time, should he lodged at the poliee-offlee (p. 26)sbut
ab' a general rule the mere mention of the dreaded police Ocarak610 is
suflieient to reduce the drivers to reason. "

The CARRIAGES supplied by the larger hotels are better and cleaner
but also dearer than the ordinary cabs.
. Donkeys (comp. p. xviii), per short ride in the city 1-2, per hr. 3-h pias.,
half-a-day, 8-12, for a day's excursion LT.25 pias. As at Alexandria,
donkeys are becoming less and less fashionable in Cairo; but they are
still indispensable for those who wish to study Oriental life in the narrow
streets of the Arabian quarters, with their bazaars and mosques. For
visits to the Tombs of the Khalit‘s and the Mamelukes, to the view-points
0n the Windmill Hills and the Muhattam Hills, and similar excursions,
donkeys offer this advantage over cabs, that they can go _everywhere, while
the bridle-paths are much less dusty than the earrriage-roads. These
