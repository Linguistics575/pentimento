A. The Northern Quarters.

The following section deals principally with the interesting ediflees in
the N.E. part of Cairo, to the N. of the Sikkeh el-Gedideh, the continua-
tion of the Muski (p. 41). The route here described is thus a direct con-
tinuation of that described in Section 2. - The N.W. portion of Cairo
(p. 41) contains little of interest.

From the Sikkeh el-Gedideh (Rue Neuve), opposite the Gami'a
el-Ashraf (Pl. E, 3; p. 42), we enter the 8Mriea el-AWmlaptyeh
(P1. E, 3), which begins at the 8ebtl ofShékh Motahhar, dating from
1700. This street, with the Shari'a en-NaNrtusin to the N., is the
continuation of the great line of thoroughfares which runs from the
Bab ez-Zuwéleh on the S. to the Bab el-Futtill (p. 62) on the N.

To the right lies the entrance to the Khan e1-Kha1i1(p. 42),
nearly opposite which is the Std; etHW1gh (p1. Siyc‘igh), or bazaar
of the gold and silver smiths, which consists of several crooked
lanes, barely a yard in width. The occupants of these crowded
alleys keep their wares in glass-eases or under glass shades. Their
stalls present a very poor appearance, but their filigree-work is
sometimes very good. Spurious gold and silver wares are not 11n-
frequently sold as genuine. The silver manufactured at the shops
ought to bear a government stamp,indicating the number of carats.

From this labyrinth of lanes we return to the Shari'a el-Khor-
dagiyeh, which is prolonged by the 8Mri'a el-6Oergtyeh and the
8hhr'ia en-Nahhdsfn. The last contains the uninteresting market
of the coppersmiths. Several pipe-makers (skibulcshi) are also
established here. On the left side of this street are the imposing
red and white facades of the mosques of Mtristtn lrralirym, Mo-
rammed en-Nteir, and Barljo.rfyeh (p. 60), which occupy what was
once the site of a small palace of the Fatimite sultan Mu'izz.

Opposite is the broader Sh6rta Ett et-l.rt4t, leading to the Bét
e1-1riU.11 (P1. E, 3), or 'House of the Jmlge', originally a palace of
Emir Mamay, a general of Kait Bey. In the large court on the
right is an open verandah, resting 011 columns with early Arabian
capitals. This is the entrance to the building in which the kadi
holds his court on Sat. (at 4 p.m. Arab time). This court was
formerly the supreme tribunal of the country, and the appointment
of btu.1t was made by the government at Constantinople, and was
frequently bestowed upon favourites, as it is a very lucrative post.
Now, however, the hatii is always an Egyptian, and his jurisdiction
is limited to cases in which the law laid down by the Koran is to
be administered, and particularly to actions between husband and
wife. - We now return to the main street.

The mosque of Muristan 1ialMn (P1. E, 3) was once a vast
hospital, the greater part of which is now in a ruinous condition,
and used as a workshop by coppersmiths and tinkers. The tomb of
the founder, however, and the small mosque opposite (recently

restored) are tolerably preserved. The building, begun by Sultan
