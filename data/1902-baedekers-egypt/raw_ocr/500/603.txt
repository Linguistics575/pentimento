310 Route 26. ESNEH. From Luxor

Roman emperors. The facade, 120 ft. wide and 50 ft. high, is turned
towards the E. and is crowned by a concave cornice, in which stand
the names of Claudius and Yespasian. On the architrave below, on
each side of the winged sun-disk, are the votive inscriptions of these
emperors. Yespasian is here referred to as lord of 'Rome the capital'.
A flight of steps descends into the interior of the vestibule, which
belongs almost entirely to the Roman imperial epoch, and is the
only portion that has been excavated as far as the pavement. This
vestibule corresponds in arrangement to the Pronaos of the temple
of Hathor at Dendera (p. 219); it is 108 ft. broad and 54 ft. deep.
The roof, which is embellished with astronomical representations,
is borne hy 2-1 columns (i116 rows), with elahorate floral capitals
and decorated with reliefs and inscriptions. Each columns is 37 ft.
high and 173/4 ft. in circumference; the first six are connected by
halustrades. - The walls are covered with four rows of representa-
tions, showing the Roman emperor in the guise of an ancientPharaoh,
before the various gods of Esneh. In the middle of the Rear Wall
(W.) a portal (now built up), resembling a pylon and crowned with
a concave cornice, gave access to the inner parts of the temple. The
reliefs and inscriptions on this portal date from the reign of Pto-
lemy VI. Philometor. On each sideâ€˜is a smaller door (built up);
to the left of that on the right appears Decius sacrificing to the
ram-headed Khnum. The name of Decius is especially noteworthy
as being the last imperial name that occurs in hieroglyphics on any
Egyptian monument. - Towards the foot of the N. Wall is a re-
lief of Horus, the Emperor (Jomrroodus, and Rhnum drawing a net
full of water-fowl and fishes; to the left stands the ibis-headed
Thout, to the right the goddess Sefkhet-ebui. - Adjoining the
E. Wall, at the first halustrade to the left of the entrance, a small
chapel has been added. - Inscriptions and representations were
placed also on the Outer Walls by the Roman emperors.

In the neighbourhood of Esneh are the remains of several Cowre Cos-
vex'rs AND CHURCHES. About 31/4 M. to the S. is the Comm: ofSS. Manaos
and Senntz'os, which is said to have been founded by the Empress Helena,
and contains some ancient frescoes; 51/2 M. to the N. is the Le"r Anba
Matteos, or convent of St. Matthew; and 1/2 M. to the W. is an ancient
Church in the rocks, with a few frescoes.

The village of El-Hilleh, on the E. hank oppositeEsneh, stands
on the site of the ancient Contra-Latopolis. The temple, dating
from the later Ptolemies, has left not a trace hehind. - At el-
Jrenyin, 13 M. to the S. of Esneh on the W. hank, there are ancient
river-embankments. On the W. bank stretches a broad and fertile
plain, on the E. is the finely shaped Gebel Sharoneh. At el-Hawi,
on the E. bank, appears the first sandstone.

On the W. bank, about 3/4 hr. farther to the s., is the pyramid of
el-Kula, which now presents the aspect of a step-pyramid, owing to the
decay of the filling-in material. The entrance was on the S. side. In
spite of its ruinous condition this pyramid is still about 30 ft. high, while
its base occupies an area about 55 ft. square.
