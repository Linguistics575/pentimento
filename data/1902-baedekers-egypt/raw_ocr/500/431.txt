the period of the Middle Empire by the richer inhabitants of Meet..
Crocodilopoiis. The older graves are much injured, but those of the Greeco-
Roman period are in good preservation, and have yielded numerous
mummies. In many cases these hail portraits of the deceased pairted on
thin cedar boards or upon linen, placed upon the head. - Of stiil greater
value are the portraits found at el-Rubaydt, 13 M. to the N.E. of Medinet
e1-1rayf1m, which were purchased and. brought to Europe by Theodor Graf.

The return to Medinet tsl-Bay) may be made in 11/2 hr. without
again touching f.iawiiret el-Malgtaf, as follows: cross the Bahr &ita about
1/2 M. to the N.W. of the pyramid, then ride to the W., arid ittir crossing
the Balir Bald Md, proceed direct across the plain to Medineh.

A visit to the Pyramid of 1il1-Iahiin or 111ahdn (Egypt. Le-hiine,
i.e. 'mouth of the canal’, see p. 175) may be combined with the
above expedition. The pyramid may be reached from Haweret er..
Malsta' in i, or from the Labyrinth in 11/2 hr. 3 otherwise we proceed
viii the station of El-Laid) on the light railway (p. 178). The
pyramid is constructed of Nile brieks, piled up upon a rocky nucleus
bearing a star-shaped framework of low walls built of massive lime-
stone blocks. It has recently been opened by Fraser, and identified
as the tomb of Usertesen II. The remains of the ancient embank-
ments, once supposed to belong to Lake Meris, date from the time
of the Khalifs. Those who are interested in hydraulic engineering
should inspect the entrance of the Baht Yt1suf into the Fayt1m.

About 1/2111. to the E. of the pyramid of Eragaht"lry Prof. Flinders Pe-
trie discovered a temple in 1889, and close beside it the ruins of the town
2letep-thrertesert (“Contented is Tnertesen0, now called Kahdn. The latter
was founded by Usertesen II. (12th Dyn.) and had but a brief existence.
The lines of the streets and the site of the palate may still be traced,
and numerous domestic articles were found among the ruined houses.

Near auvotr, 11/2 M. to the W.S.W. of E1-Lahtin and close to the edge of
the desert, is another ruined town, Which owed its origin to Thutmosis III.,
who built a temple there. Many of the inhabitants were foreigners.

From E1-Laltf1n we take the train back to Medinet er-Faytlm.

The Birket Karim and its Environs.

Travellers who restrict the''mselves to the Birket Karen and Demeh may
accomplish their excursion by railway in one day if the trains suit, by
starting early and returning late. Otherwise a tent must be taken for
spending the night. Donkeys should be taken by train or sent on early
in the morning to Abuksa. Arrangements for crossing the lake by boat
must be made with the shékh of the fishermen; the usual charge is 30 fr.
per day, with a bakshish for the rowers, of whom 6-8 shOuld be stipulated
for to avoid delay. The assistance of the Mudir of Medineh (eompAy.1'U)
in securing a boat is useful; otherwise the boats may be out fishing. -
Those who wish also to visit the temple at Kasr {farms and to extend the
expedition (say for d days) cannot dispense with a dragoman (p. 174). - The
route from Medineh to the Birket 1rari1n via liknhtr is described on p. 178.

From Medinet el-Faytam to Abuksa the train takes 11/3 hour.
Between the stations of Senaro and Ebshuai lie the ruins of an an-
cient town. Abuksa is situated on a hill and commands a fine survey
of the lake and the Libyan mountains. Near the station is a sugar-
factory [closed at present].

From Ahuksa We ride to the N. along an embankment intersect-
ing the fields, and in 1/3 hr. reach the fellehin village of Kafr Abud,
