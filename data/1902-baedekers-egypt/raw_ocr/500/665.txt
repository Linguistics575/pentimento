Rock Temple of Gerf-ap1y"sm The Egyptian name of this temple
was Per-Ptah, the 'House of Ptah'. It was founded in the reign of
Ramses II. by Setaw, at that time governor of Ethiopia, and it was
dedicated to Ptah of Memphis and his fellow-gods. In front of

the rock-temple proper lay a

 

fiFiifi _ . quadrangular COURT (P1. A),
D which was surrounded on
D three sides by covered colon-

 

 

 

nades. The E. colonnade had
lotus-columns, while the
Ca C C.3l , others were supported by
is pillars, against which stood
colossal figures of Ramses II.
Two ofthe columns and five of
the pillars are still standing.
The W. side of the court is
bounded by the rock-fapade
of the temple, hewn to imi-
tate a pylon and decorated in
a corresponding style. On the
left side of the portal is a re-
lief of Ramses offering fresh
vegetables to Ptah. Passing
through this portal, we enter
a large HALL (P1. Ir), 45 ft.
square, hewn out of the rock.
The ceiling is supported by
six pillars, 28 ft. high, against
which are statues of the king
like those in the court. On
each side of the hall are
four recesses, each with the
king, in the guise of a god
under various titles, standing
between two deities.

17 ft. deep, is entered by a small door, on the left side of which is
