110 Route 7. SPRING OF MOSES. Environs

This hill stands at the mouth of the narrow, winding valley, 'h M.
in length, through which the path to the Spring of Moses ascends
over large blocks of stone and rubble. The ravine terminates in a
lofty amphitheatre of rock. Here is a cleft in the rock from which
trickle a few drops of bitter and brackish water, quite arbitrarily
named the Spring of Moses fAin Maw). The chief attractions of
the gorge consist in the numerous desert plants and the fossils it
contains and in the sense of perfect solitude which it conveys.

In order to reach the smaller Petrified Forest, we return to the
mouth of the gorge and proceed towards the SE., skirting the
slopes of the Molrattam, which are here more precipitous. We first
pass a black projecting rock, which has a glazed appearance, and
then a square gap in the rock, beyond which we observe opposite
to us gently sloping hills, consisting of limestone, marl, and beds
of fossil oysters. The route ascends, a little to the right, between
these hills, and soon reaches the plateau of the Gebel el-Khashab,
where the scattered fragments of fossil wood indicate the begin-
ning of the Little Petrified Forest. Almost all these trunks and
fragments have been referred by Unger to an extinct tree, which he
named the Nicolia [Egyptiaca and regarded as akin to the bombacem.
The petrifaction is now generally supposed to have occurred during
the later tertiary period under the action of silicious geysers, such
as are to be seen ttr-day in the Yellowstone Park of North America.
The silicated trunks lie in a secondary stratum, the overlying strata
in which they were originally embedded having disappeared in the
course of the desert denudation.

Crossing the plateau of the Petrified Forest for about 20 min.
more towards the s., we suddenly reach the S. slopes of the Mo-
kattam, through a gap in which a path descends into the Wadi et-
Tth, or 'valley of wanderings' (more correctly Wtdi Digla). This
valley stretches to the W.N.W. towards the valley of the Nile, and
begins at the hills of Gharaht1n, like the parallel With' Hof (p.155),
which debouches to the N. of Helwan. On the S. horizon rise the
hills of Tuna (p. 155), recognisable by the oli1 fortress on their right
spur and by two heights exactly opposite to us, of which that to the
left somewhat resembles a eoffin in shape, while that to the right
is hemispherical. Crossing the bottom of the valley in this direction
(8.), we perceive in the Tuna hi11s the entrance to a desert gorge,
bounded by lofty and precipitous slopes. This valley extends for
many miles in various windings, communicates with the ravines
of the desert which begin in the Gebel Hof near Wlwtrn, and is
abundantly stocked with the plants peculiar to the desert.

We may return to Cairo from the Little Petrified Forest through
the 'Valley of Wanderings', skirting the S. and W. slopes of the
Mokattam, and passing the Tombs of the Mamelukes. Another in-
teresting return-route leads across the Mokattam hills. If we choose
the latter we quit the Petrified Forest by a hollow to the S.W., and
