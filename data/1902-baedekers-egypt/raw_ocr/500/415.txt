170 Route 14. ISMAâ€˜ILIYA. From Port Sofia!

1886 by Prof. Flinders Petrie, who found numerous fragments of pottery,
arrow-heads, weapons, and other articles. Mr. Petrie identities the spot
with the Greek Daphnae and with the 2'aehpanhes or Tehaphnehes of the
Bible (Jer. ii. 16; Ecek. xxx. 18, ete.).

The Canal traverses Lake Balah, from which it is separated by
a low embankment. At Ebd'erddn (p. IBO, at the S. end of the
lake, the Canal passes through the first cutting. At the next passing
place we obtain a glimpse of the desert.

The hills of Till-h" ('the embankment'), which cross the course
of the Canal at an average height of 52 ft. above the sea-level,
presented the most serious obstacle to its construction. In order to
form a cutting through it, no less than 18,767,000 cubic yds. of
earth had to be removed, and 20,000 fellahin were employed in the
work before machinery could be-brought into operation. At the top
of the hill is the deserted village of El- Gisr, with a chapel to the
Virgin of the Desert, and a ruined mosque. A flight of steps as-
cends to this point from the Canal. The view hence embraces a
great part of the Isthmus, the frowning 'Atil.ra Hts. above Suez,
the mountains of the peninsula of Sinai, the course of the Canal,
and the green expanse of the Bitter Lakes.

At the end of the cutting the Canal enters Lake Timak1p, or the
Crocodile Lake, the dredged channel through which is indicated by
stakes. As we enter the lake we see the Khedivial Chateau (see
below) above us to the right, and in the S. the mountains of Gebel
Abu Balah. The lake, which is now about 6 sq. M. in area, and of
a beautiful pale-blue colour, was, before the construction of the
Canal, a mere pond of brackish water, and full of reeds. On its N.
bank lies the town of---

Ismafiliya. (Ismailia). - Hotels. VICTORIA HOTEL (branch of Shep-
Iteard's Hotel at Cairo), first-class, near the quay, with pretty veranda,
lake-baths, etc. - Hi5aars-RmyrvmAwr DES VOYAGEURS (proprietor, J. Basta).

quarters. - TRAMWAY between the quay and the railway station. - STEAM
TRAMWAY to St. Viozcent, a settlement to the E., in connection with the
steamers on the Canal, and to Port 8a"id (p. 168).

Isma'tltpa was the main centre of operations during the MII-
struction of the Suez Canal, but it afterwards lost its importance.
A new period of prosperity, however, has begun since the great
Asiatic and Australian mail-Steamers have ceased to call at Alexan-
dria, so that the traffle between them and Cairo is carried on vit
Port Sa'id and the Canal. The pretty gardens and plantations and
the view of the blue lake lend the town the appearance of an oasis,
with both European and Arabian cultivation. The air is healthy and
not moist, in spite of the proximity of the water.
