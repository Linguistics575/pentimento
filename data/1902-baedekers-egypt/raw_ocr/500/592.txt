Medina Helm. THEBES (w. BANK). 24. Route. 299

The inner side of the central edifice, through which we pass
by the Gateway a, bears reliefs showing the king in various posi-
tions as the conqueror of his enemies.

We 110W enter the Outer Court, 85 yds. long, between the pavilion
and the main temple. In the middle stands a small Gateway (P1. B),
erected by Nektanebos. To the right lies the Temple of the 18th
Dyn. (see p. 303). To the left is a small TEMPLE OF AMENERTA'is,
the mother-in-law of Psammetikh I. (comp. p. lxxxv).

Through a large Portal we enter a Fore-Court and thence pass to
the vaulted Sanctuary, which was completely surrounded by a corridor.
0n the Left Wing of the portal we see Amenertais sacrificing to Ammon
(above), and standing holding two sistra before Ammon and Mut (below).
On the Right Wing Amenertai's sacrifices to Ammon (above), and to Am-
mon and a goddess(below). The temple is adjoined on the right, by three
chapels, dedicated to Shepenwepet, Nitoeris (daughter and granddaughter
of Amenertais), and Meht-Wesekhet (wife of Psammetikh L).

The *Main Temple of Ramses III. was built on exactly the
same plan as the Ramesseum and was dedicated like it to Ammon.

The large First Pylon is covered with representations and in-.
scriptions. On the Right Tower (P1. C), to the right, the king is
shown before Ammon-Re-Harmaehis, grasping a band of enemies
hy the hair and smiting them with his club. The hawk-headed god
hands him the curved sword and leads to him by a cord the captured
lands, which are represented in the accustomed manner (p. 251)
by circular walls enclosing their names and surmounted by bound
enemies. Beneath are two other rows of representations of con-
quered lands. Farther to the left, between the grooves for the flag-
staffs, is a similar but much smaller scene, representing the king
smiting two foes in presence of Ammon; and beneath is a long in-
seription, describing in poetic but exceedingly exaggerated language
the victory won by Ramses III. over the Libyans in the 11th year
of his reign. At the foot Ammon is seated to the left, with Ptah
standing behind, inscribing the king's name on a palm-leaf. The
king kneels before Ammon, under the sacred tree, and 'receives
from the god the hieroglyphs for 'juhilee of the reign', suspended
on a palm-branch, as a symbol of long life. Thout writes the king's
name on the leaves of the tree, and beside him stands the goddess
Sefkhet-ebui. To the right of the portal, below, is a stele of the
12th year of the king (imitated from a stele of the 35th year of
Ramses II. at Abu-Simbel, p. 372), containing a dialogue between
Ptah and the king. The Left Tower (P1. D) repeats these scenes
and inscriptions.

Through the Central Portal (P1. d), embellished within and
without by representations of the king worshipping the gods, we
enter the First Court, forming an approximate square of 115 ft.
The inner side of the first pylon is adorned with scenes from the
Libyan campaign of Ramses (see above). To the S. (P1. e) is a
battle, in which the Egyptians are aided by mercen aries from among
the Shardana (p. 298), who are distinguished by their round helmets
