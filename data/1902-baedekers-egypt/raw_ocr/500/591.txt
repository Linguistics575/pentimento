A staircase in the S. tower ascends to the two APARTMENTS in
the upper story of the middle structure, the floor separating which
has disappeared. The wail-i-eliefs of the lower room have vanished,
but those of the upper room (harem scenes) are still quite distinct.
The window commands a fine view of the temples and ruined village
on the W. and of the plain to the E. Similar reliefs adorn the walls

of the other (inaccessible) rooms.

the gateway a and turning to the right towards the open N. side of the
W. Wing. To the left in the upper story are two windows. To the left
of one of these are two maidens; to the right of the other, the king on
a chair, with a maiden behind him and two in front of him. More to

wing we may observe the holes in which the ends of the rafters supporting
the floors of the upper stories were inserted.
