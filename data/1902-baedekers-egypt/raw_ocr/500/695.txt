The shopkeepers are mostly Dongolese. The number of women,
most of whom are well-built, is remarkably great. They wear loin-
cloths and usually have their hair elaborately dressed. The most
characteristic groups are to be seen at the various wells. The fashions
prevalent among the natives are very curious; as in their methods of
shaving, tattooing, and perfuming themselves, and otherwise alter-
ing their personal appearance. Elephantiasis is the most widely
spread disease; and sufferers from the fertit worm (filaria medinen-

sis) may occasionally be observed.
