Bersheh, in the step sides'of which are numerous tombs of the liar1y
and Middle Empires and also several quarries. The Valley is ehiefly
noted for the rock-tomhs in its N. slope, constructed under the
Middle Empire by the princes ofthe 'nome of hares'.. which in-
eluded this region. The only one of these that need be visited is -

TOMB 2, belonging to Thuti-hotep, son of Kai, prince of the
nome in the reigns of Amenemhét II. and Usertesen II. and III,
We ascend the path ascending the hill to the left at the mouth of
the valley, but before reaching the top divergn to the right by
another path. This tomb is constructed in exactly the same way
as the tombs at Beuil.1asan. The Vestibute, originally supported by
two palm-eol11mns, has been destroyed. A door leads hence to the
Tomb Chumher, the walls of which were embellished with reliefs,
now partly destroyed. On the Left Walt is a scene representing
the transportation of a eolosuml statue of the decreased, from the
quarries of Het-nrrb (p. 210) to a temple. The inscription in-
forms us that the statue was of alabaster and 10 ells (21 ft.) in
Jrcight. It is securely fastened with ropes upon a wooden sledge,
which is drawn by font rows with 43 workmen in each (172 in all),
A priest precedes the statue scattering incense. On the prow of the
sled stands a man pouring water on the ground to prevent the heavily
loaded sled from taking: fi1v by friction; and on the lap of the figure
is another man clapping his hands, probably the 1euler and time-
giver of the song of the workmen, whose task was facilitated by
rhythmical movement. Below are other workmen carrying water and

the top are, companies of people with branches in their hands,
hastening to meet the procession. To the extreme left stands Thuti-

three next rows cranes and geese are being fattened, f1sh are being pre-

in the lowest row are servants bearing fish and other food. 011 the right
half appears the deceased receiving the fish and fowl that have been

deceased are here shown: tillage, potters, vintage, vine-treading; below
are the daughter of the deceased, smelling lotus-flowers, and his body-
