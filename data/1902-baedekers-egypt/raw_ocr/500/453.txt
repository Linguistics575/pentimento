Egypt, not only on account oftheir remarkable architectural fea-
tures, but also for the manifold representations of scenes from the
domestic life of the early Egyptians.

The tombs, 39 in all, are arranged in a row in the rocks, and are
now distinguished by conspicuous red numbers. The best examples are
secured by iron doors against the vandalism of the natives, from which
they had previously suffered. The tombs were most recently carefully
examined and cleared of rubbish by Mr. Percy E. Newherry, at the cost
of the Egypt Exploration Fund. Travellers whose time is limited may
content themselves with a visit to the four chief tombs (Nos. 17, 15, 3, 2).
For remarks on the construction of the tombs, see pp. 287, 288
