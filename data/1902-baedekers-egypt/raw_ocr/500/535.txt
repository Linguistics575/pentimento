256 Route 24. THEBES (E. BANK). 2. Karnak:

c. THE NORTHERN BUILDINGS.

The ruins to the N. of the Temple of Ammon are in such bad preser-
vation that the traveller who has little time at his disposal may content
himself with a glance at the great N. girdle-wall of Nile-bricks, and at
the N. gateway.

Beginning at the E, gateway (see p. 255), we skirt the girdle-
wall of the great temple of Ammon, first to the N, and then to the W.
(left), until we see upon the right or N. side of our path another
girdle-wall of Nile-bricks. Passing through a gateway in the latter,
adorned with the cartouche of Nekht-Har-ehbét (p. lxxxvii), we
reach the -

Temple of Mont, which, though not inferior in size to the temple
of Khons (p. 243), is now so ruined that its ground-plan can scarcely
be made out. The temple was built for the war-god Mont or Mentu
by Amenophis III. (18th Dyn.), though it was subsequently several
times enlarged between the reign of Ramses II. and the epoch of the
Ptolemies, especially by Euergetes I. The temple stood upon a plat-
form of masonry, traces of which still remain. The earlier sculptures
and architectural fragments are of great beauty; and columns with
Hathor capitals were also employed. Two obelisks of red granite
once stood in front of the N. entrance, upon bases that are still in situ.
The N. gateway, built of granite, dates from Ptolemy Philadelphos.

From the granite gateway we proceed to the S.W., passing the
remains of a Ptolemaic Temple, of which the staircase is still to
be seen, to Six Small Chapels, each of which is entered by a sand-
stone gateway (without inscription) in the girdle-wall. Only the two
chapels farthest to the W, have left any considerable remains. The
second from the W. contains the name of Amenerta'is, with that of
her brother Shabako. The fine alabaster statue of the queen, now
in the museum at Gizeh (p. 87), was found here.

Re-entering the precinct of the temple of Ammon by a gateway
in its S. girdle-wall, we notice immediately to our left a Temple
of Ptah, patron-god of Memphis. It was built by Thutmosis III.
and enlarged and restored by Shabako the Ethiopian and by several

of the Ptolemies.

Ag we approach from the w., we reach five successive Gateways, of
which the second and fourth (P1. a and b) were built by Shabako, whose
names have been scratched out, the others by a Ptolemy. Farther on is a
Corridor, running between two columns (with rich foliage capitals) con-
nected by a balustrade. The Pylon at the end of the corridor has a portal
bearing the name of Thutmesis 11L, restored in the Ptolemaic period.
This admits to a Court (P1. c), embellished at the back with a portieo
supported by two sixteen-sided columns. Two altars stand here, dedicated
by Amenemhét I. and Thutmosis m. In the walls are ancient recesses.
A staircase ascends to the upper story. A doorway (with restored reliefs
of Thutmosis III.), in the main axis of the temple, leads into the Sanctuary,
which retains the original reliefs of Thulmosis HI. To the right is a
room with a statue of the lion-headed goddess Sekhmet-, to the left, another
with a well-preserved ceiling and ancient reliefs of Thutmosis III. - It
is instructive to observe the difference in style between the ancient and
the restored reliefs.
