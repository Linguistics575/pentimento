376 Route 35. FARAS. From Abu-Simbel

church. The ancient approach has disappeared; a ruinous flight of
steps leads up to the entrance. The First Hall contains four papyrus
columns with bud-capitals. The architectural details have been
painted over with Byzantine ornamentation, and the ancient mural
reliefs project from beneath figures of Christian saints. This hall
is adjoined by two side-ehambers and behind it is the sanctuary.

Among the reliefs on the walls of the Hall are the following. On the
left half of the Entrance Wall, Haremheb suckled by Anukis, beside whom
stands the ram-headed Khnum; on the right half of this wall is Harem-
heb before Thout, On the Ar. Wall, to the left of the door, the king be-
fore the ibis-headed Thout and four forms of the hawk-headed Horus
worshipped in Nubia; to the right of the door, Haremheb accompanied
by Set and Horus. - On the s. Wall (to the right of the door) are Christian
paintings of St. Epimachus and other saints on horseback and Coptic in-
scriptions. On the ceiling are figures of Christ and en Apostle.

On an isolated crag to the S. of the Gebel Addeh rise the ruins
of a Mediaeval Fortress. In the valley are numerous domed brick
tombs, probably Christian. .--- Farther to the S., in the face of an
isolated cliff opposite the island of Shataui, are several Memorial
Niches. One of these dates from the reign of King Eyé (18th Dyn.),
who here prays to six gods. Another was constructed by an official
named Paser, who was governor of Ethiopia in the reign of King
Haremheb. On the walls we see Paser praying to Ammon-Re and
Riv, and Paser's relatives before the deceased.

On the E. bank rise numerous isolated rocks, while the moun-
tains recede from the river. - 11 M. Kusté‘l (E. bank). H 171/2 M.
Adendhn (E. bank) is the last commune belonging to Egypt. The

Egyptian Sudan (p. 380).

On the W. bank are remains of Coptic convents; and on the E.
bank are the ruins of an isolated building of considerable size.

Fares (W. bank). Close by is a rectangular wall enclosing the

Ramses II. Close by are some Coptic shaft-tombs. - In the river
lies Geitret Farms, a large island, known as Artekio by the Nubians.

251/2 M. Sarah, on both banks. On the W. bank, beside 'Asli.keh,
are the remains of a small temple built by Ramses 11.; on the E.
bank is a rained town enclosed by a wall.

On the E. bank, farther on, lie (29 M.) Tihk'reh, with fine palm-
groves; Deghém, near which are several cultivated and inhabited
islands; and (331h M.) Aehktt.

Beyond Arleht (W. bank), the river-banks again become flat and
barren.

40 M. Tewfilgiyeh (Grand Halfa Hotel, kept by a Greek), the
landing-place for Wkdi Haifa, is a clean little town on the E.
bank, founded by the British in piece of several Nubian villages.
