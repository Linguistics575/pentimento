the sultan Selim (p. xcviii) placed a garrison of Bosnians here. Their de-
scendants were defeated in 1811 by the fleeing Mamelukes, but in the
same year Ibrahim Pasha. (p. xcix) captured and destroyed the fortress.

Paths ascend both 011 the N. and S. to the only Gate of the for-
tress, which lies on the N. side. This is embellished with the
Egyptian hollow cornice and the sun-disk. The Girdle Walt of rough
stones is supported on the S. side by a substructure of carefully
hewn blocks. The interior of the fortress is occupied by a confused
group of houses, built of rough stones, but incorporating fragments
of older buildings, such as portions of columns used for thresholds.
Two of the larger buildings are still in good preservation, vis. a
Byzantine Church in the middle and an Egyptian Temple, with a
pylon, in the NW. corner. The church was afterwards used as a
mosque, but a dedieatory cross is still to be seen on one of the col-
umns. The temple contains no inscriptions. A steep flight of steps
descends on the W. side to the river. The view from the castle-hill is
very fine; to the E. rise hills crowned with the tombs of shekhs, while
the Nile flows below; to the W. lies the tawny desert, contrasting
with the verdant fields and groves and the grey houses of Anibeh.

Close to the S. slope of the hill lie the ruins of a small Town, sur-
rounded by a wall. Farther up the valley is a large Cemetery, with simple
.Christ.iat.1 graves and some brick tombs on a more ambitious scale. There
IS a similar cemetery in the salley to the N. of the castle.

In the steep W. slope of the castle-hill are five Memorial Re-
cesses, of the Middle Empire. These now lie at some height above
the river-bank and some are very tliffurilt of access, but originally
they were reached by means of steps from a path skirting the riser
at a higher level than the present path. The first (on the so was
constructed in the reign of Thutmosis Ill. by Nehi, governor of
Ethiopia. The second was constructed in the reign of Ramses II.
by Setaw, governor of Ethiopia, â€œho is represented in it with his
officials. The third chapel dates from the joint reign of Thut-
mosis III. and Hatshepsowet, but the name of the latter is 6wery-
where defaced. Both rulers, each beside a deity, are represented
on the rear-wall. The fourth chapel, the most important, belongs
to Amenophis II. On the right si)e-wall the king receives tribute
of all kinds (including a panther) from two officials. On the left
wall the king appears conducted by Horus, lord of Beheni (Widi
Haifa), to a row of gods. In a niche in the back-wall is the statue
of the king, embraced by Horus of Mem (on the right) and by Satet
(on the left). - The fifth recess has no sculptures.

On a steep elift' facing the river, to the S. of Kasr Ibrim, are a
Relief and Inscription of Sethos L, commemorating a timely. beside
it are graffiti of elephants, giraffes, etc.

The mountains presently retire, leaving room for a strip of culti-
vated land. Numerous Srilciyehs 0r water-wheels are seen. - 30 M.
