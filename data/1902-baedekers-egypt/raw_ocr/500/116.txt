HIERUGLYPHICS. CV

A great advance was made when words, for which there was
no special symbol, began to be expressed by the pictures of other
and different objects, the phonetic significance of which, however,
happened to be the same. Thus, 3.9., pr 'to go out' was expressed
by the picture of a house, because a 'house' also was called pr;

s' 'son' by a 'goose' Irs'; tp 'first' by the symbol , tp 'dagger'.

Many of these symbols gradually came to be used for so many
different words that their original word-signifies/ion was lost, and
they thenceforth were used as purely syllabio symbols. Thus, the

symbol p' originally 'to fly'was afterwards used for the syllable p'

in any signifieaiion; uf, originally 'pigeon' and afterwards also m-
'great', was used for any syllable man In this way word-symbols
that had a single sound came to be used as letters; 6.9. <Z> rr
'mouth' was used for r; (lmal J, 'lake' for J; "-) rt 'serpent'
(t is the feminine termination) for F; etc.

These syllabio and literal symbols were probably used at first
for grammatical purposes only (as suffixes), but afterwards, owing
to frequent ambiguities in the significance of the verbal sym-
bols, they were used to indicate the pronunciation in each par-
ticular case and thus to render the reading easier. Thus to the
symbol Sits wrr 'great' a <C22> r was frequently added, written thus

Sits 11:93 in ord er to indicate the pronunciation; or mm 'to live'
<CCz2>
was followed by the two explanatory consonants rwwm n and C) kh,

thus Jil" tii) â€˜rnkh; or 'CCC77 nb 'lord' was preceded by brtttt, n, thus

"MAMA nb. Frequently all the consonants in a word were written
=.., w (l 39 ' .
instead of merely the verbal symbol, thus , a ikht Hield' 1n-

stead of , l] g s'lcht.

In addition to these there was another class of hieroglyphics,
known as Determinatives, which were placed after the word in
order to give some hint as to its meaning. Thus, 6.9., s'(o)wrr 'to drink'

is written fi?:it:e',,t, , with the determinative 2 (a man with
CD

his fhoger in his mouth) in order to indicate that the idea expressed
by i(oyur has something to do with the mouth. These determinatives,
which greatly facilitate the reading of inscriptions, were freely used
especially in later hieroglyphic periods.

The hieroglyphic system, as we flml it in the earlier Egyptian
inscriptions, is already complete; its development, briefly sketched
above, had already come to a close. The following different classes
of hieroglyphic symbols were used simultaneously.
