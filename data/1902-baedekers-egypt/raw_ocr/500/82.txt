(2) The {fddt'o'tyeh (sing. .kddivi), an order founded by the celebrated
Seiyid 'Abd ei-kiidir e1-Gtlttrii, have white banners and white turbans.
Most of them spend their time in fishing, and in their processions they
carry nets of different colours, fishing-rods, and other insignia of their
chief pursuit.

(3). The 8enusiyeh, founded by the Algerian Mohammad ben-‘Ali es-Senasi‘
(d.1\59), have spread over Arabia and the entire N. of Africa, especially
in the Egyptian oases of the Libyan desert. The residence of the chief
of the order was recently removed from the oasis of Gaghabilb to the
oasis of Kufr. The teaching of f3en1"ust was directed towards a return to
the original strietness of Islam and to its emancipation from the dominion
of Europeans and other heretics. The members of the order abstain from
music, singing, dancing, tobacco, and coffee.

(k). The Sammdniyeh, established at the end of the 18th cent. by 8hikh
Sammdn, practise extreme aseetieism, seeking seclusion for the purpose
in cells, caves, deserts, and even in the sea. Mohammed Ahmed, the mahdi
of 1fhartilm (p. cii), who appeared at El-Obeid in 1880 as the 'summoned
of God‘, joined this order.

(5) The Al.imediyeh (sing. altmedi), the order of Seiyid Ahmed e1-
Bedawi, are recognised by their red banners and red turbans. This order
is very numerous and is much respected. It is divided into many sects,
but of these the two most important only need be mentioned. One of these
is the tirhinndto'iygh, who play an important part in the ceremonies at the
tomb of Seiyid Ahmed at Tan.ta (p. 22). The other seat is that of the
Ulcid Wdli, who are generally young men, wearing high pointed caps with
a plume of strips of coloured cloth, and a number of small balls strung
across their breasts, and carrying wooden swords and a. kind of whip
made of a thick plait of rope.

There are also many other orders which it is unnecessary to enumerate.
The ceremony of the admission of members to all these orders is a very
simple matter. The candidate (el-muvid) performs the customary ablutious,
sits down on the ground beside the superior (gl-muvshid, 0r spiritual,
leader), gives him his hand, and repeats after him a set form of words,
in which he expresses penitence for his sins and his determination to
reform, and calls Allah to witness that he will never quit the order. The
ceremony terminates with three recitals of the confession of faith by the
murid, the joint repetition of the fatter; (p. lxviii), and a kissing of hands.

The religious exercises of all the dervishes consist chiefly in the
performance of Zikrs (tie. pious devotions, or invocations of Allah; see
below). Almost all the dervishes in Egypt are small tradesmen, artisans,
or peasants. Most of them are married men, and they take part in the
ceremonies peculiar to their order at stated seasons only. Some of
them, however, make it their business to attend festivals and funerals
for the purpose of exhibiting their zikrs. These last are called fulcara
(sing. falcir), i. e. 'poor men'. Others again support themselves by drawing
water (remali; see p. 37). Those who lead a vagrant life and subsist 0n
alms are comparatively few In number. The dervishes of this class
usually wear a kind of gown (dint) composed of shreds of rags of various
colours sewn together, or a shaggy coat of skins, and carry a stick
with strips of cloth of various colours attached to the upper end. A
considerable number of them are insane, in which case they are highly
revered by the people, and are regarded as specially favoured by God,
who has taken their spirits to heaven, while he has left their earthly
tabernacle behind.

The Zikvt of the Dancing and the Howling Dei'm'shes are the best
known.

The howling or shouting dervishes perform their zikr at Cairo on
Frid. (1.30-2.30p.m.] in the little mosque beside the Irate el-‘Ain (p. M).
The dervishes assume a kneeling 0r crouching posture, with their heads
and chests bent downwards. In this attitude they sometimes remain for
hours, incessantly shouting the Muslim confession of faith - 'It ilitha',
etc., until they at length attain the ecstatic condition, and frnish by
repeating the word ha, tie. 'he' (God) alone. On the occasion of great
