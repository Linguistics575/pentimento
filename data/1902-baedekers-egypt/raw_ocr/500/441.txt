here. that the inhabitants refused to eat any fish caught by a, hook, lest
the hook might previously have injured an Oxyrynchus. In the neigh-
bouring town of Cynopo1is (p. 193) the dog, was held in equal honour,

required the intervention of the Romans, arose between the two towns,

sacred animals of the other. On the introduction of Christianity Oxy-
rynchos became a veritable town of monks. In the town itself were 12
churches and all round it convent jostled convent. In the 5th cent. the
diocese of Oxyrynchos is said to have eontained 10,000 monks and 12,000
nuns. In the Mameluke period it was still of some importance, but it has
since steadily declined. Extensive excavations undertaken here in 1897 by
Grenfell yielded large quantities of Greek, Coptic. and Arabic papyri. -
