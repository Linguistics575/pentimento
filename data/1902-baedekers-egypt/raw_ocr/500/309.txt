*290. The famous Decree of Canopus, in three languages, found
at Tanis (p. 156).

The decree appears above in hieroglyphies, or the Ancient Egyptian
written language, below in Greek, and on the margins in the popular
dialect written in the Demon's character. The decree was pronounced by an
assembly of the priests in the temple of Canopus on 7th March (17th Tybi),
B.C. 238, in the reign of Ptolemy III. Euergetes J. It praises the king for
having brought bank the images of the gods from Asia, gained many
victories, preserved peace in the land, and saved it from imminent famine
by his forethought in remitting taxes and importing corn. In token of
gratitude a resolution is passed to institute new festivals in honour of
the king and queen and their ancestors, to call all priests also 'priests of
the divine Euergetas', to found a, new sace1ri1ota1 caste to be named after
Euergetes, and introduce an improvement in the popular calendar so that
the festival of Euergetes may always be celebrated on the first day of the
year as in the year of the decree. It is also resolved to pay permanent hon-
our to the Princess Berenice, who died young and unmarried, and to celebrate
certain yearly festivals to her memory. The inscriptions lastly declare
that the decree is to be inscribed in the holy (hieroglyphic), the Egyptian
(demotic), and the Greek languages, and to be exhibited in the temples.

the 4th or 3rd cent. 13.0.

‚Äù33991. Marble head ofa Gaul, all original Greek work of great
beauty, dating from the beginning of the Ptolemaie period (p. clv).

This head may be compared with those of the Dying Gaul in the Ca-
pitoliue Museum and the Group of Gauls in the Museo Boncompagni at
Rome, though it is executed in an entirely different style. The work-
manship is much freer, fresher, and less careful; the back of the head
and neck are but partly worked. Only the head, throat, and part of the
drapery are preserved, They appear to have belonged to a statue ofa
men represented in the most energetic movement, probably fighting. The
head is thrown back towards the right shoulder and the eyes look up-
wards in keen excitement.

292. Block of sandstone, with a frieze containing the names of
Psammetikh I. and Shahako (or Tanut-Amon). Below is a long
Greek inscription with the names of the emperors Valens, Ya-
lentinien, and Gratiau. - 294. Black basalt statue of the Egyptian
scribe Her, carved under Greek influence.
