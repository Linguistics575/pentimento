MEDICAL HINTS. xxix

should be resumed. A flannel waist-belt permanently worn, or an
extra garment to take its place after exercise or when the air is
cooling, will be found a safeguard against chills. Most invalids
should not leave the hotel (or, in certain cases, their bedrooms] before
10 a. m., and then only to betake themselves to some sunny corner.
The hour for coming into the hotel varies with the place and the
month, being earliest in Jan. and latest in March and April. If the
patient be guided by the relative humidity, it would be earliest at
Mena House, say about sunset; a little later at Helwan; at Luxor
still later, fl p. m, (except in Jan), and 8 p. m. in March; and
latest of all at Assuan, - it being always understood that pre-
cautions as to extra clothing have been taken.--- Those who are not
invalids, and even in some cases invalids also, may sleep with the
windows open with safety.

If a cold is caught it is apt to result in fever or in diarrhea,
which may turn to dysentery. There are good chemists at Alex-
andria, Cairo, Luxor, and Assuan, from whom small medicine-
chests adapted for the climate may he purchased. The advice of
the traveller's physician at home will be useful in stocking such a
medicine-chest. In serious cases of illness a European doctor, when
procurable, should always be consulted, as the traveller's own ex-

perience acquired at home is of little avail in the climate of Egypt.

Fits of shivering are the usual prelude to an attack of fever. Qui-
nine is the best remedy, of which 1-3 doses should be taken on the days
when the patient is free from fever. Rest and copious perspiration will
also afford relief.

Diarrhea, which is apt to turn to dysentery, is a very common com-
plaint in this climate, and is generally the result of eating unripe fruit
or of catching cold. The patient shOuld first take a slight aperient, and
afterwards tincture of Opium or concentrated tincture of camphor. A
simple farinaceous diet (such as well-boiled rice), with tea, or well
matured, unfortif1ed, and unsweetened red wine, will be beneficial, while
fruit, meat, and fatty substances should be avoided. In cases both of
diarrhoea and fever all remedies are sometimes unavailing except change
of climate, especially if the patient is in a marshy or unhealthy locality.

Sprains, which often result from exploring ruins and caverns, are
most effectually treated with cold compresses, while the injured limb
should be tightly bandaged and allowed perfect rest.

The sting of a scorpion (seldom dangerous) or bite of a snake is
usually treated with ammonia.

Sunstroke is very common in Egypt, even in spring when the air is
still cool. The head and neck should therefore always be carefully
shielded in one of the ways indicated at p. xiv. The usual remedies are
rest and shade, cold compresses, and warm baths with cold douches
applied to the head and neck. Syringing the ears with cold salt- and-
water is one of the best remedies.

Grey (better than blue) spectacles or veils may be used with advan-
tage when the eyes safrer from the glare of bright weather. Zine eye-
wash, or some other innocuous lotion, should be used in Such cases.

Sticking-plaster, lint, as well as all effervescing powders, and other
medicines should be carefully kept from exposure to moisture.
