Nasir. The emirs, exasperated by his treachery and in-.
trigues, dethroned him in 1389 ; but in 1390 he triumph--
antly re-entered Cairo. He fought sueeessfu1ly against the
Mongolians under Timur and the Osmans under Bajazid.

Farag (pp. 33, 65], his son, had scarcely ascended the

throne, as a boy of thirteen years of age, before the Os-
mans, and a little later the Mongols, again began to
threaten the Egyptian dominions. Farag proeea1edvietori-
ously as far as Damascus; but owing to dissensions among
his emirs he was obliged to return to Cairo. After the
defeat of the Turks by the Mongols under Timur at the
battle of Angora, Farag was compelled to enter into Ttego-
ciations with Timur. The latter years of Farag’s reign
were constantly disturbed by the rebellions of his emirs,
particularly El-Mahmadi Muaiyad. He was at length com-
pelled by the insurgents to capitulate at Damascus, and
was executed (May, 1412).

1ilMKalyniidi Muaiyad (p. 47) succeeded Farag. His reign

was chiefly occupied with victorious campaigns against his
unruly Syrian vassals, in Which he was greatly aided by
the military talents of his son Ibrahim.

He exacted heavy contributions from Christians and Jews,
and he re-enaeted and rigorously enforced the sumptuary laws
of 'Omar, Jkutawaklri1, Hakim, and Mohammed en-Nasir. Not
only were the colours to be worn by the Christians and Jews
prescribed (the costume of the former being dark-blue, with
black turbans, and a wooden cross weighing 51bs. hung round
their necks; that of the latter, yellow, with black turbans,
and a black ball hung from their necks); but the fashion of
their dress and length of their turbans, and even the costume
of their women, were so regulated as entirely to distinguish
them from the followers of the prophet.

Bursbey (Berisbai; p. 66), who had for a time been the

vieegerent of an infant sultan, ascended the throne on April
1st, 1422. He waged successful campaigns against Cyprus
and the Mongols.

Kait Bey (pp. 55, 66) was one of the last independent

Mameluke sultans ofEgypt. Both as a general and a diplo-
matist he successfully maintained his position against
the Turks(Sultans Mohammed and Bajazid), and even
inflieted serious losses on them i but the refractory Marne-
lukes obstructed his undertakings and in 1496 compelled
him to abdicate in favour of his son Mohammed, a boy of
fourteen.

El-Ghuri, Kan§uweh el-.Gtlit'lri (p. 47), once a slave of Kai't

Bey, was upwards of sixty years of age when he ascended
the throne, but he still possessed suftieient vigour to keep
the unruly emirs in check. Already seriously injured by
the discovery of the Cape route to India by the Portuguese
