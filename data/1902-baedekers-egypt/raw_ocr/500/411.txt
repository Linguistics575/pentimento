Port fidtd, the chief town of the Egyptian province of the
Isthmus and Suez Canal, lies at the E. extremity of an island Which
belongs to the narrow strip of land separating Lake Menzaleh from
the Mediterranean. It owes its origin to the Suez Canal, and its
prosperity during the last ten years has been so marked that it has
become a serious rival to Alexandria. The population, Which in 1883
was only 17,000, is now about 42,000, including 11,300 Europeans.

The Harbom occupies an area of 570 acres, and has been ex-
cavated to a depth of 2() ft. by means of laborious dredging. It is

sea towards the N. for a distance of an English mile; and the
western, running towards the NE. for 11/2 M., intended to protect
the harbour from the mud-deposits of the Nile (comp. p. 8). On
the landward end of the W. pier rises the *Lighthouse (Phare), Bon-
structed of concrete, 164 ft. in height, and one of the largest in the
world. Its electric lights are visible to a distance of 'li M. About
