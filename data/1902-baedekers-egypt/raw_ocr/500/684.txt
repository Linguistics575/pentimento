SEMNEH. 35. Route. 379

one of these, to the s., are the ruins of an Arab castle. Alternately
skirting the river and traversing the desert for another hour, we
next reach Shalfak, with a well-preserved fortress of the Middle
Empire.

The third day's route also leads through the desert, from the
heights in which we have occasional glimpses of the river-valley.
In 2 hrs. we find ourselves opposite the rocky island of Uronarti
('king's island'), on the N. end of which are the ruins of a fortress
of the Middle Empire and of a chapel built by Thutmosis 111. On
the W. side of the island are considerable rapids. In 2 hrs. more
we reach Semneh, which marked the s. limit of Egypt under the
Middle Empire. On the top of the hill are massive fortifications,
with well-preserved girdle-walls. Within the latter is a temple,
built by Thutmosis III. and Hatshepsowet and dedicated to the
Nubian deity Tetun. The river, here flowing between granite cliffs,
forms numerous rapids.. -- On the E. bank, opposite Semneh, lies
the village of Kummeh, to which the traveller is ferried on a raft.
At Kummeh are a ruined fortress of the Middle Empire and a
temple of the same date as that at Semneh. The numerous inserip-
tions on both banks of the stream are interesting, especially those
of the end of the 12th and of the 13th Dyn. with flood-marks, from
which it would appear that the Nile used to rise about 23 ft. higher
than it does at present. The explanation probably is that the river
was at that epouch retarded by some natural barriers a little lower
down, which it afterwards succeeded in sweeping away.
