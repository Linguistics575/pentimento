xxii DRAGOMANS.

generally have the effect of dispersing the assailants. Charity should
be given only to the sick or the aged. A beggar may be silenced
with the words 'Aulih yaTi'k' (may God give thee l).

The traveller should take care to be amply supplied with small
CHANGE at all times, and especially before taking an excursion into
the Country (comp. pp. xv, 26).

Travellers about to make a tour of any length may avoid all the
petty annoyances incident to direct dealings with the natives by
placing themselves under the care of a Dragoman (Arab. Tur-
gemth). The name is also appropriated to themselves by the ordinary
eo1nmissionmdres in Cairo, Alexandria, Port Sa'til, Luxor, Assuim,
etc. Most of them speak English, French, and Italian. Charges, see
p. 28. Dragomans proper, who generally consider it beneath their
dignity to escort their employers through the streets of towns, are
usually employed for the longer tours only, such as the voyage up
the Nile (p. 184), the journey to the Faytlm (p. 174), and a visit to
the less frequented towns in the Delta. Before engaging a drago-
man, the traveller should carefully enquire into his record at the
hotel and the consulate. For a fixed price per day the dragoman con-
traets to supply the necessary riding animals and boats and to defray
the entire cost of lodging and provisioning the party, including all
hotel-bills. The contract, which must be signed at the consulate,
should expressly determine all details as far as possible, including
the duration of the journey, with due provision for prolonging it if
desired. It is usual to pay the dragoman one-half of the total stip-
ulated sum before starting, and the remainder on the return, or one-
third before starting, one-third during the journey, and the remain-
ing third on its conclusion. Both parties to the contract should
bind themselves to submit disputes or differences to the arbitration
of the consul.

The dragomans are inclined to assume a patronising manner
towards their employers,while they generally treat their own coun-
trymen with an air of vast superiority. The sooner this imperti-
nence is checked, the more satisfactory will be the traveller's sub-
sequent relations with his guide. Above all, travellers should never
permit their dragoman to 'explain' the monuments. These men are
without exception quite uneducated, without the least knowledge
of the historic or aesthetic significance of the monuments; and their
"explanations' are merely garbled versions of what they have picked
up from guide-books or from the remarks of previous travellers.

On the successful termination of the journey travellers are too
apt from motives of good nature to write a more favourable testi-
monial for their dragoman than he really deserves; but this is truly
an act of injustice to his subsequent employers, and tends to con-
firm him in his faults. The testimonial therefore should not omit
to mention any serious cause for dissatisfaction.
