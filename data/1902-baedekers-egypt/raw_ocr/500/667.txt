No trace now remains of the court between the Pylon and the

originally the main entrance to the temple. On the jambs are a
number of reliefs, one above the other: to the left, Philopator
sacrificing to Re, Khnuln, and Isis; to the right, Philopator before
Ammon-mi, Harendotes, and Isis. Within the portal Augustus
offers the figure of Meat to the god Thout of Pnubs and to the lion-

hence to the roof of the temple in the imperial period; at the top
is a crypt in the thickness of the wall. - CHAMBER D, built by
Ergamenes, is also much ruined. Of its reliefs only one is interest-

scribed as 'Pharaoh of Senmet' (Bigeh) and for Anuket. '_., A small
door (of later construction) in the W. wall admits to Two CHAMBERS
