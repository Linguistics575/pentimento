HISTORY OF CAIRO. At a very remote period a city lay on the
E. bank of the Nile, opposite the great pyramids, and was called by
the Egyptians Khere-ohe, or 'place of oombat', because Horus and Set
were said to have contended here (p. CXX). The Greeks named it Bab-
ylon, probably in imitation of some Egyptian name of similar sound.
The citadel of this town (p. 71) was fortified by the Romans, and
under Augustus became the headquarters of one of the three legions
stationed in Egypt. In A.D. (W) Babylon was captured by 'Amr ihn

elvA.s, the general of Khalif Omar, who subsequently established
the new capital of the country here, in opposition to Alexandria
(p. 11), which was not so free from the disturbing Christian element.
A mosque was built on the site of the eotiqueror's tent, and the
Arabic word for tent (Fos.tli.t) became the name of the new city. The
latter gradually expanded towards the N., and was extended to the
N.E. as far as the base of the citadel by Ahmed ibn Tulftn, who
erected the new quarter of el-J.tra.tiih". Ahmed's splendour-loving
son Jfhumdriiyeh embellished the town with lavish magnifieenee.
The modern city of Cairo was founded by GOar, the general of the
Fatimite Ehatlt hfuirss, after the conquest of Egypt in 969 A.D,
He erected a residence for the Khalif and barracks for the soldiers
commanded by him to the N. of el-ffatst'it At the hour when the
foundation of the walls was laid, the planet Mars, which the Arabs
call Tthir, or 'the vietorious', crossed. the meridian of the new city;
and Muirzz accordingly named the place Masr el-lrtthira, or K&him.
Mast, the ancient Semitic name of Egypt, was also applied to Fostat,
the form Masr el-'Attlca (Old Cairo) being only introduced at a later
date for the sake of elearness. The new town extended rapidly.
Bricks were easily made of the Nile mud, the Mokattam hills afforded
excellent stone, while the gigantic ruins of the ancient Memphis
on the opposite bank of the river were also used as a quarry. In
973 Muiâ€˜zz took up his permanent residence in the new city of
Cairo. In 1106 the citadel which still commands the city was erected
by Falh')eddtn Ythufihn Eyptsh (Saladin) on the slope of the Mo-
hattam hills; and the Same sultan caused the whole town, together
with the citadel itself, to be enclosed by a wall, 29,000 ells in
length. Under his luxurious and extravagant Successors Cairo was
greatly extended and magnitieently embellished. At that period,
however, Cairo was fearfully devastated by the plague, as it had
been on two former occasions (in 1067 and 1295), and was also
