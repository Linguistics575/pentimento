these states was subdivided into a number of small principalities,
originally independent but afterwards dependent, which still existed
in historic times as 'nomes' or provinces. The two Egyptian king-
doms were for a, time hostile to each other. Their union seems to
have been operated from Upper Egypt and was subsequently ascribed
to King Menes. The memory of the division subsisted beyond the
dawn of the historic period; the arms of the united empire were
formed by the union of the lily and the papyrus, the symbolical
plants of Upper and Lower Egypt; the king styled himself 'king
of Upper and Lower Egypt' or 'Lord of both Lands', and wore the

double tiara, (to consisting of the white crown (if) of the S.

and the red crown y of the N.; and at the base of the temple-

walls were represented on one side the provinces of the s., and on
the other the provinces of the N. Even in matters of administration
respect was paid to this distinction, which was farther emphasized
by the physical iliffterenees of the two regions.
