gileh-hawkers, and others, elbowing their way. One of the noisiest
frequenters of the bazaars is the dalldl, or auctioneer, who carries
on his head or shoulders the goods he is instructed to sell, and
runs up and down the lanes shouting 'liardg, hardy’, and adding the
amount of the last bid he has received. However great the con-
Eusion may be, his practised ear instantly detects each new bid. is-
suing from one of the dukkans, and he immediately announces the
1ew offer - 'bi'ashrtn hirsh’, 'hiraslirtn unutt', and so on. The seller
af the goods always accompanies the dallal to give his consent to
the conclusion of the transaction. - The prices of the various Mm-.
modities depend on the demand, and also on the demeanour of the
purchaser. Orientals regard skill in cheating simply as a desirable
"eomplishment,

In walking through bazaars and other streets the traveller will
" interested in observing how iniL1striously and skilfully the
ARTIZANS work, with tools of the most primitive description. The
;urners (Rharrd.t), for example, are equally adroit with hand and
Feet. The following are the Arabic names for some of the cemmoner
landieraftsmen: Khaydt, tailor; Sabbagh, dyer; Ref'a, stocking
nalreritAlyyhl, silk-ribbon maker; (hsstr, butcher ; Farrtin, baker;
shmkari, plumber; Hadddd, smith; Mtti, wateh-maker.

European travellers who purpose making large purchases in the ba-
zaars, must arm themselves beforehand with the most inexhaustible pa-
ienee. Time has no value for an Oriental, and that fact must he taken
nto the calculation. Everything must be haggled for, sometimes in the
nost ohstinate fashion. When the customer knows the proper price and
drers it, the dealer will remark 'tatir' (it is little), but will close the bar-
min, Sometimes the shopkeeper sends for coffee from a neighhouring coffee-
10use in the course of the bargaining. If no satisfactory agreement can
ye reached, the customer should calmly proceed on his way. Every step
1e takes will lower the demands of the obdurate dealer. It is advisable
o offer at first rather a lower sum than the purchaser is willing to pay,
n order that the offer may be raised. A common phrase in the cere-
n0nious East is ‘Imdu baldeh' (take it fer nothing), which, of course, is
Lever seriously meant. Foreigners, however, must he prepared to pay
nore than natives. Dragomans and commissionnaires usually have a private
mderstanding with the dealer, so that to make purchases in their company

L. The Ezbekiyeh and the Isma’iliyeh Quarter.

The central point of the foreign quarter, between the old Arab-
an Cairo and the new town, built in the French style within the
ast 40 years, is the -

*Ezbekiyeh Garden (P1. 0, 3), or simply the Ezhelttyeh, which
24 named after the heroic Emir Ezbek, the general of Sultan
gee Bey (1468-96; p. M), who brought the general and son-in-
aw of Bajesidl. as a captive to Cairo. A mosque was erected here
n honour of his victory; and, though the building no longer exists,
ts name still attaches to the site. The fine gardens, which have sev-
zral entrances (adm. 1/2 pias.), were laid out in 1870 by M. Barillet,
brmerly chief gardener to the city of Paris. They cover an area of
