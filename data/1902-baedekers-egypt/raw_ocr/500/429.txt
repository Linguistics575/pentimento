178 Route M. BIAHMU. Faythn.

an interesting desert expedition may be made in one day on camels to the
Wtidi Haydn, a valley on the way to the oasis of Bahriyeh. - 3. Via Rabin
(MinshatRabz') to Kalamsha. - 4. Via Kuhafeh (see below), Hawdra (station
for the Labyrinth, p. 179), and Dimishkineh to Et-Lahti, (pyrafaid, see p. 180).
-- 5. From Edwa (on the government-line, p. 176) via Gabala (to flentrets, see
p.177) to Tamfyeh, and via Selalt and Sersena to Rhoda. -.- Other lines are
under construction.

The village of Biahmu " Bihamu, which lies on the railway to So.
mtres (p. 177), 41/2 M. to the N. of Medinet tsl-Faydrn, is usually vis-
ited on donkey-back (11/4 hrs, there and back 5 pias.). The road, which
leads in the direetion of the railway-embankment through fertile fields
and past murmuring irrigation channels, affords an insight into the fer.
tility of the district. A short distance to the N. of Biahmu rise two large
stone Buildings, which present the appearance of rained pyramids and are
called by the natives 2rursi Fir'aun (U?harao1fs ehair') or es-Sanam (fthe
idol'). These were the pedestals of two colossal sandstone Statues of King
Amenemhét Ill., remains of which have been found by Lepsius and by Prof.
Flinders Petrie, who estimates their original height at U) ft. The learned
Father Vansleb of Erfurt saw the lower portion of one of these figures
in 1672. Each was surrounded by a girdle-wall, with a granite door on
the N. side. The N.E. angle of the easternmost wall is still in good
preservation. These walls were once washed by the waters of Lake
Meris, and there is practically no doubt that in them we must recognize
the two pyramids described by Herodotus (p. 175) as standing in Lake
Mceris, each with a eolossa1 seated human figure upon it.

FROM MEDrNER TO f.hi:tmihe, 91/2 M., a ride of about 3 hrs. This fine
route leads through a remarkably fertile and well-cultivated region, viii
the villages of Beni Magmln and Es-Seiiyineh. Picturesquely situated on a
cliff to the left appears the village of Fidmta or Fademineh. - $enhi1r
(Sanhour) is a large village occupying the site of a considerable ancient
town. A resting-place and sometimes night-quarters are to be found in
the large house of the Shékh el-beled or village prefect. - Those who
wish to proceed to the pirlret-lGrI1n (about 11/2 hr.) should make a bargain
with the shekh of the fishermen in Senhl‘ir (comp. p. 180).

Near Begig (or Abguig; railway-station, see above), 3 M. to the S.W. of
Medineh, lies a fine obelisk, broken into two parts, which must once have
been at least 46 ft. in height. The natives call it 'Amild, or the column.
The inscriptions, which are damaged at many places, inform us that the
monument was erected by Usertesen I., who also founded the obelisk of
Heliopolis (p. 107).

The Pyramid of 1Eawkra and the Labyrinth.

Nearly a whole day is required for avisit to the Pyramid of Hawara.
The light railway may be taken to the station of Hawara, but as even in
that case donkeys must be brought from Medineh, it is more usual to ride
all the way.

The road follows the railway and leads at first along the bank of
the Bahr Y%uf to the village of Ifuht1feh (Kohaf'a), beyond Which
the Babr Tamiyeh is crossed by a bridge. Our path traverses well
cultivated land with numerous water-wheels. We cross the Baht
Bald Md ( 'river without water”), also called el-Bats, a deep channel
diverging from the Babr Yt1sut and ending at the Bahr Tamiyeh. -
In 11/2 Ws. ride from Medinet el-Faylim we reach -

1.Eawkret; el-Malgta', a considerable village, with apretty mosque.
A little farther on we cross a bridge over the Balm Séla, Which
intersects the ruins near the Pyramid of Hawara, and is some-
times called by the Arabs Baly' el-Mclekh, Le. river of salt, or Balir
