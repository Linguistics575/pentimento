a *Relief of King Haremheh returning in triumph from his campaign in
Ethiopia. The Pharaoh is seated on his throne, which is borne by12 soldiers
adorned. with feathers. Behind and before him are soldiers, warding off
the sun 3 rays with the long-handled flahe11um. A priest precedes the litter,
offering incense, with a train of captured Ethiopians and three rows of
soldiers (among whom is a trumpeter). To the left the king and Ammon
stand upon prostrate negroes. Beneath the main scene is a recess, to the
left of which are negro prisoners, and to the right Egyptian soldiers march-
ing off captives. Note the free style of the attitudes of the barbarians,
which is quite without the usual stiffness of Egyptian drawing. Poetic
inscriptions above both reliefs extol the king as the conqueror of the in-
habitants of Kush (Ethiopia): 'Hail to thee, King of Egypt''. Thy name is
extolled in the land of the Ethiopians', etc.
