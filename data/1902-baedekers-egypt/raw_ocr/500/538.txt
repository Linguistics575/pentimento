In the outside of the wall, behind Pl. e, is a procession of priests
carrying the sacred boats. Beside it is inscribed an ordinance of Harem-
heb, intended to restore order to the distracted state.

The reliefs on the W. Wall of the court, which also date from
Haremheb, are in poor preservation. I

The wings of Pylon X, the last pylon, forming the S. entrance
to the precincts of the great temple of Ammon, have collapsed, but
the central doorway is still standing. Haremheb was the builder of
this pylon also, for which he used the stones of a building raised
by Amenopbis IV. in Karnak to his new deity (p. 203). The reliefs
on the doorway exhibit Haremheb saerifieing and performing other
religious rites. - In front of the N. side of the pylon stand two head-
less statues of Ramses 11.; and before the S. side are the remains of
eo1ossa1 statues of Amenophis III. (E) and Haremheb (W.), and
the lower part of a colossus of Osiris.

Beyond the pylon the E. Avenue of8phinzes, erected by Harem-
heb, leads to the S. Temple Precincts.
To the E. of the avenue is a Chapel of' Osirir. Ptah (closed), with well-

preserved painted reliefs. The chapel was built by the Ethiopian Kings
Tanutamon and Taharka (25th Dyn.).

The avenue leads straight to a Gate, built by Philadelphus and
embellished with reliefs and long inscriptions, in the N. side of a
girdle-wall enclosing the temple of Mut. Thence we proceed amidst
figures of recumbent rams, sphiuxes, and fragments of statues to the -

Temple of Mat, built by Amenophis m., which has recently
been cleared of rubbish under the directions of Miss Benson, an
English lady.

A Gateway (Pl. A) admits us to a large Court, in the middle of which
was a colormade. Outside the gateway are several pillars with figures of
the god Bes. On the gateway are lengthy inscriptions of the Ptolemaic
period (hymns to Mut) and in the entrance is an inscription of Ramses m.,
who restored the temple. The court contains several seated figures of the
lion-headed goddess Sekhmet, which were dedicated In this temple by
Amenophis III. On several of these Sheshonk I. has placed his own name
in place of that of Amenophis. - Farther on is a second Colonnade, with
statues of Sekhmet and a colossal granite figure of Amenophis III. _
The inner rooms of the temple are in a very ruinous condition.

Behind the temple of Mut lies a Sacred Lake, in the shape of a
horseshoe. Farther to the W. are the remains of a small Temple
of Ramses 111.

On the W. Exterior Wall are some interesting representations of scenes
from the king's campaigns: 1 Battle in Syria; 2. Syrian captives brought
before the king; iiifji"fier'iriis,'atG'"p''s' of hands out off from the enemy are
being counted; 3. Battle with the Libyans; 4. Triumphal procession of
the king, and train of Libyan captives; 5. The king inspecting the captives;
6. Train of captives; 7. Dedication of the spoil to Ammon and his fellow
deities.
