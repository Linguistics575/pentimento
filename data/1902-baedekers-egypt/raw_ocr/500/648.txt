lie a temple and other buildings, and some large columns and Greek
inscriptions have been found In the quarries. About two days' jour-
ney farther to the N. is Gebel Dukhkhdn C'srnolre mountain'), the an-
cient porphyry quarries of which were worked by the Romans. Here
are the ruins of an Ionic temple of the time of Trajan (never com-
pleted), some remains of an irregularly built town, and two large
water-reservoirs. We follow the ancient route hence to Abu Sher
el-Kz'bli. The harbour of Myos Hormos has been silted up and is
now useless.

The JOURNEY TO Kosfsn (there and back 10-11 days at least")
is more interesting. It may also be made from Kuft (p. 231) or
Luxor (comp. p. 346). The route from Keneh leads first through
the villages of fihtkh Rek/ih, Domeh, and Etyrn Umrtin, the first on
the left, the other two on the right side of the road. The first night
is generally spent at the oaravanserai of Bir 'Ambar, about 31/2 hrs.
from Ifeneh, where the lofty palms and shady sycamores and mimosa:
offer a most inviting halting-place. The large earavanserai was
erected at the expense of an Ibrahim Pasha and comprises several
separate buildings, covered with dome-shaped roofs and surrounded
by courts and eolonnades.

0n the second day we advance steadily, ascending almost imper-
ceptibly, through a monotonous plain, intersected in all directions
by small undulating heights. All around us extends the inter-
minable yellowish-gray, sun-bleaehed rocks of the desert; not a
trace of organic life is visible, not a single green tree or shrub. At
the hill of el-Karn ('the horn'), which rises to the left of the eara-
van-route, about midway between Bir 'Ambar and Lalptta, the road
from Keneh is joined by those from Kuft and Luxor. The only
variety is afforded by an occasional Mubwala or Mahatta. The Mab-
walas are simply spaces covered. with camel’s dung. They occur on
every great caravan route at regular intervals and are of the utmost
importance as sign-posts showing the road. The Mahattas or halt-
ing- places are 71/r-9 M. apart and serve also as measures of distance.
The Kosér caravans usually pass the second night in the village of
Lsl.itsta (el-Gheta; 9 hrs/. from Kuft and Btr 'Ambar, 121/2 hrs. from
Keneh), which is chiefly inhabited by Llhahdeh (p. 3120). The small
oasis has two wells, tive palms, a few mud-huts, and a half-ruined
Arab earavanserai. Mutton, goat's flesh, poultry, pigeons, eggs, etc.,
way be obtained here. Near the chief well are some fragments of a
Greek inscription of the reign of Tiberius Claudius.

The first Roman station, the Hydreuma, now called by the Arabs
Kay el-Bendt ('eastle of the maidens'), is 3 hrs, to the S. of Lalpita.
