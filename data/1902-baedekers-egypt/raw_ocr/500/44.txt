vellous uniformity. As Egypt is said to be the. 'gift of the Nile', so
has the character of its inhabitants been apparently moulded by the
inf1uenees of that river. No country in the world is so dependent
on a river which traverses it as Egypt, and no river presents physical
characteristics so exceptional as the Nile; so, too, there exists no race
of people which possesses so marked and unchanging an individual-
ity as the Egyptians. It is therefore most probable that this unvary-
ing type is the product of the soil itself, and that the character of
the peoples who settled at different periods on the bank of the Nile,
whatever it may originally have been, has in due course of time
been moulded to the same constant form by the mysterious in-
flueneeg of the river. In all countries, indeed, national characteris-
ties are justly regarded as the natural outcome of soil and climate,
and of this connection no country affords M strong an illustration
as Egypt, with its sharply defined boundaries of sea and desert, and
in its complete isolation from the rest of the world. This fidelity to
type, which doubtless many other Oriental races share with the
Egyptians, is by no means in accordance with common theories as
to the decline and degeneration of the Orient. These races seem to
possess an innate capacity that is absent from Western nations "t---
the capacity, namely, of permanently preserving the original type.
In Egypt this tendency may be partly assisted by the universal
practice of early marriages, by which the succession of generations
is accelerated, while many children are born of parents still un-
affected by any physical deterioration. Although the country has
been at various periods overrun by Hyksos, Ethiopians, Assyrians,
Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Turks, and although the people
were tyrannised over, ill-treated, and in most cases compelled to in-
termarry with these foreigners, the Egyptians have for thousands of
years retained the same unvarying physical types, while their tyhar-.
acter has been but slightly modified by the introduction of Christianity
and Mohammedanism. If it now be borne in mind that these for-
eigners generally invaded the country in the form of an army, that
they formed but a small body compared with the bulk of the popula-
tion, and that they either married native women or sought wives
in other countries, it is obvious that they would either continue to
exist for a time as a foreign caste, a condition apparently repugnant
to nature and necessarily transient, or that they would gradually
succumb to the never-failing inf1uenetys of the soil and be absorbed
in the great mass of the aboriginal inhabitants. An excellent il-.
lustration of this process is afforded by the Arabian invasion, with
the circumstances and results of which we are better acquainted
than with the history of the other foreign immigrations; for, dis-
regarding the Beduin tribes, who are entirely distinct from the
Egyptian population, we now meet with genuine Arabs in the towns
only, where the merchants: pilgrims, and other members of that
people form a class entirely distinct from the natives, and one that
