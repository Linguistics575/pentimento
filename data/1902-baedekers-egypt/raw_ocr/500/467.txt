princesses who adore the names of the sun, while the queen lresen 3 her
own portrait, also adoring the names of the sun; behind them are three
princesses with sistra; the sun darts his rays upon an altar loaded with
food and vessels - Tome II, of Ramosé. To the left, in the entrance,
are the royal pair accompanied by a princess, receiving the symbol of
'Life' from the sun‘s rays, which are shaped like hands. In the recess
are seated flg,uires of the deceased and his wife. - Tomes 12 AND 13, though
unfinished, are of interest as illustrating the method in which these rock-
tombs were hollowed out. - T031314 belonged to a 'military commander
and fan-bearer on the king's right hand', whose name has everywhere
been carefully obliterated; while contrary to the usual rule in these tombs,
the names of the king and queen have been left uninjured. The tomb
is unfinished. On the right portion of the entrance-wall are preliminary
sketches in black of various objects (ships, a garden, a house with col-
umns). - TOMB 15 ot’Suti had just been begun. ---. TOMB til, though a fine
specimen, has no representations or inscriptions.

Tome 23, belonging to Eni, a royal tlouse-steward and seribe, differs
from the other tombs in its arrangement. A flight of limestone steps as-
cends to the entrance, which is crowned with a concave cornice, and in
front of which a eolonnade was intended to be erected. On each side of
the, lintel are the king and queen and three princesses praying to the sun;
on the left side in the entrance is the deceased praying, with the text
of his prayer in front of him, on the right side he appears with a staff
and nosegay (painted on stucco). The walls " the MAIN CHAMBER are
coated with stucco, but with the exception of the concave cornice at the
top are unpainted. In the RECESS is a colossal statue of the deceased. On
the right wall are the deceased and his wife seated before a worshipper,
0n the left wall, the deceased seated at table and receiving flowers from
a priest. These scenes also are painted on stucco but are much faded.

TOMB 25, the farthest to the S. in this group, belonged to the
priest and fan-bearer at the king's right hand Eye, a favourite of
Amenophis IV. and his successor on the throne (p. lxxxii). This
tomb, like so many of the others, was left unfinished, because the
king died during its construction, and the court was soon after-
wards removed back to Thebes, where Eye caused a new tomb to be
made for himself (p. 277). On the Door Posts, to the right and
left, are Eye and his wife, kneeling below inscriptions. In the
ENTRANCE, to the left, are the king and queen, followed by the
princesses and the court, praying to the sun, which directs its arm-
shaped rays towards the altar; below are Eye and Ti, his wife, in
prayer. To the right are Eye, in his oftieial costume, and his wife
praying, their prayers being inscribed beside them. - The MAIN
CHAMBER was designed to be supported by 24 papyrus-columns
with closed bud-capitals, but only 15 have been hewn out, and of
these only 4 are finished. The remainder (to the S.) have only
been begun in the living rock at the top. On three of the columns
appear the deceased and his wife, adoring the names of the sun and
of the king and queen. In the centre of the rear-wall is an un-
tinished door-shaped stele; in the N.E. angle is a flight of steps
leading to the not yet begun sarcophagus-ehamber; and in the N.W.
angle, is an unfinished door-shaped stele. The representation on the
left portion of the Entrance Wall, the only one fi11ished, deserves
notice. To the left are the king and queen at a window of the
palace throwing down decorations to Eye and his wife (upper parts
