These shops are not mentioned to the exclusion of many others equally
good, but merely to give the traveller an idea of where to look for shops
to suit him. As a rule the shops to the E. of the Ezbekiyeh and in the

the goods in the latter (fixed prices} are usually more modern and tasteful.

making purchases in these bazaars. Many so-called Oriental articles are
manufactured in Europe and are to be obtained at home equally genuine
and much cheaper. The prices demanded by the dealers for 'antiques'
are absurd, though unfortunately many travellers are foolish enough to
pay them, in spite of the notorious fact that most of the articles are forg-

in the case of small articles. Comp. p. 78.

Arabian Woodwork is sold by Pavvis, an Italian, on the left side of a
