copying books, or by filling some religious office to which a salary is
attached, and they occasionally receive donations from the wealthier
students. When teaching, the shékh sits cross-legged on a straw-mat and
reads from a book placed on a desk fralileh) before him, explaining each
sentence as he proceeds; or he directs one of the more advanced students
to read aloud, adding his own explanations from time to time. The students
sit in a circle around the teacher, listening, or attentively taking notes. As
soon as a student knows by heart and can explain the whole of the book
which is heing studied by the class, the shékh makes an entry in his
copy of the work, called the Igiieeh, whereby authority to lecture on the
book is conferred on the student himself. The president of the univer-
sity, who is usually the most distinguished of the shékhs, is called Bhiikh
el-thimira or Shiikh el-Isldm, and receives a salary of about 20 purses, i.e.
10,000 piastres.

Most of the students, particularly those whose native tongue is not
Arabic, begin their university education by learning the Arabic grammar
(film en-nafm). The 'next branch of study is religious science Cilm el-
ketdmh the introduction to which consists of a series of preparatory lee.
tures on the attributes of God and the prophet f'ilm et-tauliidJ.

After having completed his course of religious instruction, the student
proceeds to study law t'itrn el-fi.kh). 'Jurisprudence', says Ibn Khaldt1n,
one of the greatest of Arabian thinkers, 'is a knowledge of the precepts
of God in relation to the actions of men, some of which it is our duty to
perform, while others are forbidden, or recommended, or permitted; and
this knowledge is derived from the book of God, i.e. the Foriin, from
the Sunna (ale. tradition), and from the inferences drawn by the law-
giver (hrot.1ammed) from sufficient materials afforded by the Irpriii.

Besides these leading hranches of instruction, logic, rhetoric, the art
of poetry, the proper mode of reciting the 1foriin, and the correct pro-
nunciation of the letters are also taught.

The above list of the subjects taught at the most important of Moham-
medan schools will serve to convey an idea of the intellectual condition
of Orientals at the present day. The most conspicuous defect of their
culture consists in the entire absence of independent thought, in conse-
quence of which they are the mere recipients of the knowledge of the
past. Their minds are thus exclusively occupied with the lowest grade
of intellectual work, their principal task consisting in the systematic
arrangement or eneyelopatdie compilation of the knowledge handed down
to them.

On quitting the Mosque of Azhar we proceed in a straight di-
rection, leaving the Mosque of Mohammad Bey Abu Dahah on the
left, to the SaLuu wi-ji.UNLwrr%iar (P1. 23), also called Sill:
er-8udlin or bazaar for wares from the Sudan, consisting of gum,
dt1m-palrn nuts, ill-tanned tiger-skins, etc. Farther on, in a straight
direction, we reach the street of Ashrafiyeh, opposite the Mosque

of Ashréf (p. 42).

From the Au1rtdlyeh, opposite the exit from the Sudan Bazaar, the
SHERI‘A mHEAosrz'h'wt Es-SEGH’I‘R (P1. Til, 3), in which is the bazaar of the
same name, leads to the W. The $111; el-lflamzswi is the baraar of the
Christian merchants (iyrians and Copts), who vie with their Mohammedan
fellow-tradesmen in the exorbitanee of their demands, and whose chief
wares are European calico, porcelain, and drugs (which last are tr 'lil in
nearly all the bazaars) This narrow winding street is prolonged by the

of the Shiri‘a el-Hamzawi es-$eghir we observe on the right the covered
Sharia en-Narbiyeh (Pl. E, 3), with the Bills el-rAttitrin, or spice-market,
which is easily distinguished by its aromatic odours. The perfumes of
Arabia, genuine and adulterated, wax-candles, and drugs are the chief
commodities here. Attar of roses is sold hy weight at high prices. The
