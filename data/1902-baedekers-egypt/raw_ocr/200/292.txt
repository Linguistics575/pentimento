inscription with the date 1195. The church also contains some
interesting Byzantine carving and mosaics in ivory, now blackened
and discoloured with age. Anumber ofold pictures of saints, some
of them on a gold ground and with well-preserved colours, possess
no artistic value. The Coptic priest who exhibits the church expects
a fee of 1 pias, from each visitor. - Two narrow flights) steps
(Pl. q, 1') desoend to the Crypt (often 1louded), a small vaulted chapel
with marble columns under the choir, consisting of have and aisles
(boy to show the way 1 pias.) At the end of the nave is an altar
in the form of an early-Ohristian tomb-niche, which tradition in-
dicates as the spot where the Virgin and Child reposed; in the centre
of the aisles are apses. The right aisle contains the font, into
Which, tuumrding to the Coptic ritual, the child to be baptised is
dipped three times.

The Castle contains several other basilicas, used by Coptic and
Jewish congregations, but interesting only to those Who are making
a special study of this kind of architecture. Among them we may
mention the churches of St. Ihwbara (Siltch 1%rbCira; recentiy
restored), containing good earrings and paintings, Mari (?iryis
(St. George), and Et-'Mra. The Jews say that Elijah once appeared
in the Synagogue fEah-c%arnytm or Jfenhet Elirilut).

To the left of the exit from the castle, beyond the recently
ereeted Greek Convent of St. George, lies the Coptic church El,
Mo'allaka or'resting upon columnsâ€™. The latter, the oldest in Babylon
(p. 71), has been recently thoroughly restored. - Beyond the angle
on the S. side of the castle, between projecting towers, is a massive
Roman Gateway [exhumed in 1901), built of fragments of ancient
Egyptian masonry. 0n the gable are strongly emphasized baroque
forms; and over the archway, to the left, is a block showing the
winged sun-disk.

Starting from the door ofthe castle, we proceed touarrls the N.,
across the rubbish heaps of the ancient Pasta! Cp. 32), skirt the town-
wall, and after 650 yds. reach the whitewashed W. facade of the ex-
ternally insigrMeant mosque of Amru, which has three entrances.
Visitors usually enter by the S. entrance, below the minaret.

The G&mi'a. mm ibn a-UL, called Mosque of Amra by the
Europeans, owes its name to the general of the Khalif 'Omar,
though not a trace now remains of the original mosque, which was
only 50 ells long and 30 ells broad. Indeed there is scarcely a
building in Egypt that has so frequently been destroyed by water,
tire, and earthquake, and that has been so regularly rebuilt.

The interior (2 pias. to the attendant who escorts the visitor]
is in exact accordance with the typical form of the rectangular
mosque with a hypaethial arrangement " columns round an open
court; and in spite of its imperfect state (the N, and S. eulonnades
are represented by the bases only of the columns), its great size
