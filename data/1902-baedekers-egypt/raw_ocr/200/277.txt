The third street ilebouohiug at the Bond Point is the Faggdia
Street, from which, a little farther on, to the left, diverges the Shdrfa
e.s-i5iniir (PI. C, D11), pleasantly shaded by iebbelr-trees. In its pro-
Ihngationis the hitdiin e.z-i.Mhir, with the large mosque of that name,

5. The Immediate Environs of Cairo.

The most interesting points in the immediate neighbourhood of Cairo
may all he reached by Carriage (p. 27); bat travellers who use Dnnkey:
(p. 27) are more independent among the Tombs of the Khalifs and elsewhere.

1. The Tombs of the Khalifs and the Mamelukes.

A visit to the Tombs of the Khalifs (and to a certain degree to the
Tombs of the Mamelukes also) is exceedingly interesting, especially to,
wards sunset, owing to the very novel and curious picture they present. -
Tickets of Admission, see p. 30.

The large and superb mtu1s01ess of the 13-16th cent, Which,
under the names Tombs of the Khalifé and Tombs of the Mamelukcs,
stretch along the entire E. side of the city, were erected by the
Bahrite and Circeseian Mameluke Sultans. The name 'Tombs of
the Ehaliis', applied to the northernmost group, is historically a
misnomer, for the tombs have no connection with the 'Abhaside
Khalifs then resident in Egypt o. xciii) and treated as mere titled
puppets. All these mosque-tomhs were once richly endowed, each
being provided with a numerous staff of shékhs and attendants, who
with their families resided within their precincts. The revenues of
the mosques having been eonf%atiy1 at the beginning of the pre-
sent century, the tombs gradually fell to rain. Now, however, the
Committee mentioned at p. 30 has taken them into its keeping.

The usual route (very dusty) to the *Tomhs of the Khalifs leads
through the Bdb en-Nay (P1. E, 2; p. 62), past the Mohammedan
cemetery and the reservoir of the water-works (y. 63). To the right
is the Windmill Hill o. 67). Beyond the unimportant tomb of
Shékh Zaldl we have one of the finest )"Views of the city of the dead.

We may also proceed from S. to N. through the Béb el-Atabep (al-
Almba) or the Bdb er-Were, both of which are to the N. of the citadel.
In this case we cross the small cemetery 0f Kardfet Bath 21- Wezfr and first

reach the Tomb Mosque of Tkit Bey. We frr1ish our inspection with the
N. group of tombs (see below) and return to the town by the Béb ewNagr,

The N.E. group of these meusolea consists of the Tomb of Sultan
ert7M"srt o. 47), a cube surmounted by a stilted dome, and the
tomb-mosques of Sultan el-Aahrdf. with a handsome minaret, and
