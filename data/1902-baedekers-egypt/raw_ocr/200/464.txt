to Assiat. TELL ELJAMARSA. 18. Route. 205

The Tombs of Tell elJAmarnm are essentially the same in point of
structure as the tombs of the 18th Dyn. M. Thebes (p. 187). Each is im-
mediately preaeded by a Fore Court, whiah was originally surrounded by :1
brick wall. Thence a wide door admits to the Alain Chamber, hewn in the
rock, and in many cases with columns sumrotling Ihe ruof. The Chamber
containing the statue of the deceased is next reached, either by another
door, or by a corridor, passing between two other apartments. Many of
the tombs are unfinished, in consequence of the early death of Ameno-
phis IV. and the subsequent return of the court to Thebes. - The tombs
(in both groups) are marked withhlack numbers 6-25), running from N, to S.

TOMB 1 belonged to Huy√©, superintendent of the royal harem
and steward to the queen-mother. In the entrance is the deceased

however, only that on the left side is standing. Entrance Wall. To
the right are the king and queen seated at table, below the queen
are two princesses facing each other, to the right are guards, etc.

'Amarua, the sun appears above the royal couple7 with Iays ending
in hands. Below are musirdarrs, a bariryletetable, bowing servants,
soldiers, etc. Right End Wall. The temple of the sun is represented

two companion scenes (much injured), showing the king on the
balcony of the palace. Left End Wall. The king is being carried in
a litter to the temple of the sunrright), accompanied. by a large
retinue. Entrance Watt. To the left, a scene resembling that to the

deceased appears in prayer. The following Chamber fuuiinished)
contains the mummy-shaft, surrounded by a parapet hewn in the
solid rock. - In the LAST CHAMBER (serdiib; p. cxliv) is a recess
with the tyolossal seated figure of the deceased, the features of which
have been defaced. On the walls are moumers,-men with saeritityial
gifts, a carriage, chairs, etc.

TOMB 2, whose owner is unknown, deserves special attention
because its construction was still going on under Sakere, the son-

columns; the reaI-ehamhers are tu1tiuished. Among the representa-
tions in the former the following may be mentioned. Entrance Wall.
