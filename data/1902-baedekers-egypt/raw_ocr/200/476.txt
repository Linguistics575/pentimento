very few houses of a better class. It occupies the site of Ptolemu'is
Hermiu, a town founded and endowed with great privileges by
Ptolemy Soter I. Its Egyptian name was Pso'i. Strabo described it
as 'the largest town in the Theba'id and not inferior in size to
Memphis; with a constitution drawn up in the Hellenic manner'.

About 71ist M. to the W. of Menshiyeh, beside the village of
Kawz’imil, are large cemeteries of the most remote period.

Beside the village oNrl-Al.iaiuur, on the E. bank, are other barial-
places of the Ancient and the New Empire. On the hill, close to a
shékh‘s tomb, are the ruins of an Egyptian brick fortress. - On
the W. bank is the village of El-Ahuiwu el- Gharbiyeh.

The Gebel Tttkk, on the Arabian bank, approaches close to the
stream, about 3 M. below Menshiyeh. Extensive quarries (with
Greek, Latin, and Demotic inscriptions) exist here, especially
near Shékh hftisa; these yielded building material for Ptolemai‘s.

88 M. 11iripsh(thrergaJ, on the W. bank, is a railway-station (11.1 9t)
and has post and telegraph ofdees. It was formerly the capital of
the province of Girgeh (comp. p. 215), and contains over 17,000
iuhab., of Whom 4800 are Copts. Many of the houses in the town
are built ofburnt brick and decorated with glazed tiles. The bazaar
resembles those of other Nile towns. Outside the town lies a Roman
Catholic convent, which is probably the oldest but one in Egypt;
the abbot is a. member of the Fraternity of the Holy 8ep11lehre.
The town looks very picturesque as seen from the river. The Nile
makes a sharp bend here, and the effect is as if the W. bank, on
which the town stands, was at right angles to the E. bank. The
Arabian mountains rise like walls, and the four tall minarets of the
town, on the opposite bank of the Nile, seem to vie with them in
height. A picturesque group on the river-brink is formed by an old
and dilapidated mosque and a tall minaret beside it.

At Meshaikh, on the E. bank, opposite Girgeh, scholars will fiad iu<
terestia,y, remains of a temple built by Ramses II. and restored by Nereaptah.
Meshztikh is a village of the Aulad Yahya, On the site of the ancient Lepida-
sanpalis. Above the village are some ancient roek-tombs, the chief of which
belonged to Enher-moaé. a high-priest of This in the reign of Marenptah
(19th Dyn.). About 3 M. to the N. is the old Coptic convent of De‘r el-Meldk,
the large cemetery of which is still used by the Christian inhabitants
of Girgehi The Arabian mountains, Which approach close to the river
beyond the village, contain numerous tombs, ioar of which._ at a con-
siderable elevation, deserve special attention as being the vestiug-plaees
of grandee: of the ancient This (see below). Their inscriptions and WV
presentations are now scarcely visible. - The village El-Bz'rbeh, 31/2 N.
to the N. of Girgeh, perhaps occupies the site of This (Egypt. TI'n?), the
capital of the most ancient Egyptian kings (see p. lxxv) and of a home of
the sme name.
