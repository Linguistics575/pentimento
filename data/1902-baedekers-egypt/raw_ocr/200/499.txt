and entered by narrow flights of steps or by openings concealed
by movable stone ishrbs. Their elaborate mural reliefs date from
the reign of Ptolemy XIII. Neos Dionysus, and are therefore the
oldest as well as the best executed decorations in the temple. The
arrangement and entrances of the crypts are shown in the small
Plans li, m, and xv. Magnesium wire or a lamp will be found
useful in examining the painted walls.

In Crypt No. 4, which we eater through a square opening in the pave
ment, are several narrow chambers, on the walls of which are depicted
the saeriiieia1 vessels, ornaments, and images of the gods that were pre-
served here. The colouring of the admirably executed reliefs is remark-
ably fresh. On the right wall of the second room to the right is an
interesting relief of King Pepi (6th Dyn) kneeling and oifering a golden
statuette of the god Ehi to four images ofHgtltop. On the walls of Crypt
No. r (entered through an opening in the pavement of the small sacri-
Iieial court), Ptolemy XIII. appears presenting gifts (ebieily ornaments) to
various gods. - Crypts Nos. 1 nt 2, arranged above each other in two
stories, are also interestimu they are most conveniently accessible from
Room VlI.

We now return to the first auteeharaber, and ascend one of
the Staircases (p. 228), which lead hence to the roof ofthe temple.

The EAST ssAuicasu, which ascends straight to the roof with easy
steps, is dark, being lighted only by a single opening in the wall. The
WEST STAIRUASE is a kind of spiral staircase, With ten rectangular bends
to the right, lighted by several windows, with tasteful symboliml repre-
sentations of the sun shining through them. The walls of both stair-
cases are embellished with reliefs of the ceremonial pro0essior1 of the
priests with the images " Hathor and her fellow-gods at We great New
Year's Festival. The left wall presents us with at view of the procession
amending from the lower rooms of the temple, the right thll shows it
deseeadirrg. The priests are headed by the king; some of them wear
masks representing the lesser deities. After completing the circuit of the
lower rooms, the procession ascended to the roof of the temple, in order
that 'the goddess Hathor might be united with the beams of her father
Ité' (the sun-god). - The W. staircase passes at small room (situated ahnve
the storemnm adjoining the second anteehamber), with three windows
looking into the court. Higher up is a small court with two rooms opening
off it, corresponding to the chambers for the cult of Osiris 0n the E. side
of the terrace (see below).

We now reach the Temple Roof, which has various levels, the
highest being above the great vestibule or promos (p. 229). At
the S.W. angle of the lower terrace, which we reach first, stands a
small open Pavilion, supported by 12 Hathor-eolumns. Adjoining
the terrace on the N. are three rooms, situated above the chambers
to the left of the smaller hypostyle hall. These were used in the
worship of the slain and risen Osiris, as curious representations
and numerous inscriptions indicate. The second room, separated
from the Mst by pillars, formerly contained the famous Zodiac of
Denderu (now in the Bibliothéqne Nationale at Paris), the only
circular representation of the heavens found in Egypt. The re-
maining portion of the ceiling still shows two figures of the goddess
of heaven. - A flight of steps ascends from the N.W. of the terrace
to the roof of the first antechamher and thence to the still higher
roof of the hypostyle hall. Thence a modem iron staircase leads to
