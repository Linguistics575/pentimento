The exterior of the s. wall is covered with a long inscription, recount.
ing the building of the temple and its endowments.

Near the village of El-Kherbeh, about 1/4 M. to the N. of the
Temple of Ramses IL, are the ruins of the ancient city and of a
Shrine of Osiris, dating back to tho 12th Dynasty. - To the S. of
the latter are scanty traces of a second temple.

Farther to the W. lies a small fort, surrounded by two walls (the
outer wall the lower), named Shunet es-zebtT,whitsh probably served
as a place of defence against the incursions of the Beduins from
the W.

A Coptic Convent (more like a village) to the N.E. of this point, dating
frum the year 1306 of the Cnptie era, scarcely repays a visit.

The rubbislrmouudg at the font of the hills, IN. to the s'nv. of the
trmple of Ramses IL, called by the Arabs Umm el-Ga‘ah [‘uiother of pots'),
contain tombs of kings of the lat and 2nd Egyptian dynasties, including
those of L'mphm‘s and Mtebis(1stDyn.). They were explored by Amélineau
and Flinders Petrie, but there is now practically nothing to be seen

Near the village of Gnabut, to the S. of Abydor L, an ancient quarry.

Above Belieneh the course of the Nile lies almost due E. and W.
The Dam Palm (Hyphaeua thebaica) becomes more and more com-
mon and increases in size and beauty as we travel sonthwards(eomp.
p.1ix). About t M. from the S,bank1ies Samhtsd, unancient rubbish-
mounds. The Arabian Mts. approach close to the river.

28 M. Nag' Hamhdi, on the W. bank, a town of 4400 inhab., is
a railway-station (p. 19t), A large railway-bridge crosses the river
here (see p. 191),

31 M. Kim (W. bank), at one of the sharpest bends in the stream,
is a large but miserable-looking Village. It was the home of Shekh
Selim, Who died about 30 years ago, at a very advanced age, after
sitting stark naked for 53 years dn the bank of the Nile at the spot
now marked by his tomb. He was regarded by pious Moslems with
great honour and was deemed to possess great powers in helping
navigation. In the neighbourhood are the scanty ruins of the ancient
Diospolis Farm.

34 M. Kagr ertayiul (E. bank), a steamboat-statiou, is probably
the ancient Khenaboukian. Close to the bank is a steam-eugine for

Zauti. The ceiling was left vough-hewn. Some of the small instsriptioas
cut in the living rock near the entrance are in Coptic. The representations
on the .inside of the entrance-wall have been almost wholly destroyed,
but sume ships may be distinguished to the right of the door. On the

with a list of the gifts. In the rear-wall are two niches. That to the
