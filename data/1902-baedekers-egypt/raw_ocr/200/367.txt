132 Route 9. MEMPHIS.

Camhyses, the first monarch of the Persian dynasty. took the city by
storm after his victory at Pelusium (13.65%) over Peammetikh 111.; and
even after the foundation of Alexandria (13.0. 332) it still retained some
importance. Under Augustus it Wu; a large and populous city, though
its palaces, elevated on an eminence, lay mined and deserted. Among
the temples that still existed were those of Ptah, of Apis (p. 135), and
of a female deity, who was ii1er1tulei1 with the Aphrodite of the Greeks,
In consequence of the edict of Theodoeim (A.D. 378-3W5; comp. p. xoii)
the temples and statues were destroyed, and under the later Byzantine
monarchs the heretical Monophyeites (p. xciii) seem to have been very
numerous here. Mulgeuhis, the leader of the qopts, Was established at
Memphis while negotiating with 'Amr Ibn el-VAs, the general of 'Omar
(p. 32). The Mohammedan conquerors transferred their residence to the
right bank of the Nile, opposite the northernmost part of Memphis, using
the well-hewn blocks, which had once composed the venerahle palaces
and temples of the ancient city of Menes, for the construction of their
palaces, castles, and mosques at Cairo. Memphis, however, was so vast,
that it was long before its plunderere succeeded in entirely destroying it.
Down to a. late period the ruins of Memphis excited the admiration of
all visitors. Thus 'Abdelm.tif (at the end of the 12th cent.) assures us
that even in his time the ruins contained a profusion of wonders which
bewildered the mind and btrfiled description. - After his time the rapidly
dwindling ruins " Memphis are rarely mentioned.

The path diverging to the left from the Bedrashén embankment,
and leading through the palm-grove to the village of Hit Rakineh,
brings us to the *Golossel Statues of Ramses IT., which once
marked the entrance to the temple. The first of these, discovered
in 1888, is made of granite, and lies on its back on a slight eminence,
so that to see the face it is necessary to climb on to its breast. Its
length is 25 ft., not including the crown, which is 61/2 ft. in length.

The square hole in the head of the colossus was for the insertion of
the crown, which now lies on the ground beside it. On both shoulders,
breast, girdle, and bracelet occurs the name of the king; and en the
pillar at the back is an inscription. On the left of the statue is an incised
reliefof Princess Bent-Anat. - A stele oprries (26th Dym) and the upper
part of a donhle statue of Ptah and Ramses ll. © have also heeu found
on this spot, In the rounded pediment of the stele appear Ptah, on the
left, and the hawk-headed Sokaris, on the right.

A few min. farther on we reach the mud-hut that conceals the
Second Colossus (adm. 4 pins. for those without oftioial admission
tielret, see p. i30), discovered by Messrs. Caviglia and Sloane
(1). 116) in 1820. A wooden flight of steps ascends to a platform
from which the statue is inspected. It consists of remarkably hard
and tine-grained limestone, and before it was injured was about
42 ft. in height, corresponding to the measurement given by Hero-
dotus (30 cubits of 11/2 ft. each). The workmanship is excellent.
The handsome and gentle features of the king are admirably re-
produced. Au artitiuia] beard is attached to the chin. In the girdle
is a dagger adorned with two hawk’s heads. 0n the right shoulder,
the breast, and the girdle appear the prmnomina " Ramses IL -
In front of the hat are severe] fragments of monuments, showing
the name of Ramses 11.

Tn the N. of the colossi, near the village that crowns the hill ofE6m

et-mrtssztr', are the foundations of a temple of Ptah, built by Ramses IL,
with representations of local deities.
