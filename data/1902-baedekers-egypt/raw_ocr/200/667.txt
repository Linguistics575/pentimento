presentations of foob-prrirress, indicating the Sputi where the worshippers
stood The roof of the central portal may he reached from the W. tower.

No trace now remains of the court between the Pylon and the
vestibule. The fagade of the VESTIBULE, or Pranaos (Pl. B), had
two columns with palm-
capitals, connected with
the side-walls by means
of screens. Only the col-
umn to the left is now
standing; on the hack of it
is a representation of the
god Bes, dancing and
playing the harp. 0n the
walls are representations
of the king before the gods
of Dakkeh. 0n the E.
mile-wall is an interest-
ing picture , representing
the Pharaoh proffering to
the god Them a palette,
which is borne by Isis
and Nephthys and is,
perhaps , symbolieal of
Osiris. Beliefs of an Eth-
ioyian king occur on the
rear-wall (at the top, to
the left). The whole ofthe
walls and the ceiling were
Painted over in Christian
times with sacred sub-
jects, traces of which still
remain, notably 0n the E. wall (God the Father enthmned) and on
the N. wall (0ruciiixiun). - The doorway in the reaI-wall was
originally the main entrance to the temple. On the jambs are a
number of reliefs, one above the other: to the left, Philopator
saerifieing to RE, Khnum, and Isis; to the right, Philopator before
Ammon-hy, Harendotes, and Isis. Within the portal Augustus
offers the figure of Mast t0 the god Thout of Pnnhs and to the lion-
headed Tefnut.

CHAMBER C, which we enter next, is almost entirely demolished
and its flour is strewn with ruins. A staircase, on the right, led
hence to the roof of the temple in the imperial period; at the top
is a crypt in the thickness of the wall. - CHAMBER D, built by
foYgarner1es, is also much ruined. of its reliefs only one is interest..
ing (on the right wall) : Ergamenes pouring out wine for a god de-
scribed as 'Pharaoh ol' senmet' (Bigeh) and for Annket. '_, A small
door (oflater construction) in the W. wall admits to Two CHAMBERS
