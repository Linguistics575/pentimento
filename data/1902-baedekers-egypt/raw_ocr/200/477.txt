20. Abydos.

The ordinary traveller, especially when he has at his disposal only
the 8 hrs. allowed by the steamer, will confine himself to the Temple of
Sethas I. and the sadly dilapidated Temple of Ramses ff., with possihly a.
visit to the old fortress of Shenzt zz-Zebib. The other antiquities are
uninteresting. - Fair donkeys, with Eurupeau saddles, may he ohtaiued

Abydos lies about 81/2 M. from Beliéneh, a ride of 11/2 hr. The
track crosses several canals, passes through the hamlet of el-Hers,
traverses a fertile district dotted with numerous villages, and fimrlly
leads over part of the Libyan Desert. Fine view of the mountain-
chaiu running towards the Nile. The ancient Abydos, the sacred
city of the Egyptians, lay on the verge of the arable land, and ex-
tended from ‘Aniba or 'Arr5lnyt el-i1fadfCmeh (i.e. 'buried 'Ariba') to
ei-KI-bell (p. 224).

Abydos (Egypt. Abutu) was One of the most ancient cities in Egypt and
played an important r619. in the religion of the country. For here Was
the famous, grave of Osiris, in which the head of the god was traditionally
believed tn be buried in a casket. Just as the Shirite Mohammedan
cherishes nn dearer wish than to be buried near the tomb of Irosh1 of Ker-
hela(p. Ml), so the pious Egyptian, from the days of the Ancient Empire,
desired nn hatter fortune than to have his corpse carried to Ahydos, there
to find its last abode beside the tomb of Osiris. Those who Were uhehle
to do this, or who had huill tombs elsewhere, often caused their mummies
to he brought temporarily to Abydos, to receive the desired consecration
and to spend some time at least with Osiris. Many contented themselves
with merely erecting a memorial stone in the necropolis, thereby assuring
to themselves the favnur of Osiris, the lord of the underworld. - The
chief god of Ahydos was of course Osiris; hut his wife Isis, his son Horns,
and, under the New Empire, Ptah. 11armeehis, and Amman, with other
deities, were also worshipped there. - Straho gives an interesting account
of Abydos; 'Above it (Ptolerntrfs) lies Ahydos, Ihe site of the 2femmrniwn,
a wonderful palace of stone, built in the manner of the Labyrinth, only
somewhat less elaborate in its complexity. Below the Memnonium is a
spring. reached by passages with low vaults consisting of a single stone
and distinguished for their extent and mode of construction. This spring
is connected with the Nile hy a canal, which flows through a grove of
Egyptian thiorsraeacias, sacred to Apollo. Ahyst seems once to have been
a large city, second only to Thebes, but now it is a small place, etc.'
This spring may perhaps have been a Nilometer. Ammiauus Mareellimls
speaks of the oracle of the god Bes, which tlouvished here.

The most important part of ancient Abydos was its extensive
Neeropolis, situated in the desert. Four distinct sections are clearly
traceable. In the southernmost, beside "Aretha, are tombs of the New
Empire and the temples of Sethos and Ramses. To the N. of this
rises a hill, with graves dating from the close ofthe Ancient Empire.
Still farther to the N., between the shrine of Osiris and the fortress
of Sininet ez-Zehib o. 224), are the tombs of the Middle Empire,
many in the form of small brkk-pyrsmiils. Here also are found
graves of the 18-20th Dyn. and of the later period. Finally, in the
hill of Umm el-Gaulr, to the W, are the tombs of the kings of the
earliest dynasties. - The chief centre of interest is the -
