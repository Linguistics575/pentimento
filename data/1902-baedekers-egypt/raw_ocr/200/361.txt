l 28 Rants (f. TOMB Oh' NUMBERS. Environs

We may uomplete our circuit of the plateau of the Pyramids by
visiting the Sphinx (p. 123] and the Granite Temple, (p. 124), and
then return to the Great Pyramid and the three small Pyramids
lying in front of it to the E. - At the foot of the E. side of the
southernmost of these small pyramids lies a small Sanctuary of Isis
(P1. o), 'Mistress of the Pyramids', which was rebuilt by Psusennes
L215tDyn.). Only a few stumps of columns now remain.

We may now proceed to the E. to the verge of the desert plateau,
in the direction of the Arab village, in order the inspect the Tomb,
ofthe Ancient Empire, hollowed out in the rocky slope. Several of
those are now used as dwellings or stables. The best known is the
Tomb of Numbers (P1. n), which belonged to a certain Jrhafra-
onldi, a oourtier of Kl1aire. On the left tyntrbmye-wall appear the
deceased and his brother, accompanied by a dog, inspecting the
cattle that are driven before them by peasants. The peasants are
arranged in several rows, headed by a standard-bearer. Writers
are engaged in recording the number of cattle of each kind, the
numbers being placed above the herds (whence the name of the
tomb). Thus we are informed that Khafta-onkh had 853 bulls, 220
cows and calves, 2235 goats, 760 asses, and 974 rams. On the left
(8.) wall are the deceased and his wife at table. On the rear (W.)
wall are five door-shaped steles with u full-face portrait in high
relief of the deceased, to the left. The mural reliefs, which are in
poor preservation, are in the clumsy and undeveloped style of the
4th Dynasty. - On the S. horizon rise the pyramids of Abugir
(p. 129) and the step-pyramid " Sal.rlpira (p. 134].

Beside the viliuge of Keniu'seh, ahout 5 M. to the N. of the Pyramids
of Gizeh, vise the Pyramids of Abn Roast], which were erected towards
the end of the [uh Dynasty. They are must conveniently reached on camels
hired from the Beduins (enquire at the Mena House Hotel). The route
leads through the desert, skirting the edge of the cultivated land. The
1m est pyramid built by Tetf-RE (p. 127) and called Et-ipra by the natives,
is situated upon a steep rock, almost inaccessible from the plain, but
reached by an approach. still nearly 1 M. long, from the N.E. Nothing
is left of the pyramid but its rocky core, and the same is true Ufa smaller
stone-pyramid to the S.W. The plateau commands it fine view of the Bile
valley and of the gnrges of the Libyan desert. - There is a. third pyramid,
huilt of brick, in the plain to the N. of the village of Aba Roésh. The
brick superstructure which was 55 ft. in height when Lepsius saw it
in 1812, has since been entirely demolished, and nothing now remaiue‘
but the roek-eore with the tornb-eUrnher.

The ExcxmsmN TO THE PYRAMIDS " Ahugin, to the S. of Gizeh,
is interesting. We take the electric tramway to the Mena House Hotel
(p. 112), and ride thence in 1%-2 hrs. on a donkey (there and back
10 pies.) or camel. Or a donkey may be taken direct from Cairo in
2'/2 hrs., vit the villages of Gizeh and Shohremeut; or the excursion
may be combined with that to Sal.clptriy (p. 130).

Quitting the Mann House Hotel we ride along the verge of the
desert, leaving the Pyramids of Gtzeh on the right. To the left is
the cultivated country with several villages, the largest of which is
