Cigar-smokers will find it very '1'1rfitrult to become accustomed
to the Oriental tobacco, but they will tind tolerable oigar-shops at
Alexandria and Cairo, most of Which have been established quite
recently. As a general rule smokers are recommended to carry with
them, both in going to and returning from Egypt, as little tobacco
as possible, especially if they travel by the overland route, as a
rigorous search is often made and a heavy duty exacted, both at
the Egyptian, and at the French, Austrian, and Italian frontiers.
Travellers returning to England direct, with their luggage booked
