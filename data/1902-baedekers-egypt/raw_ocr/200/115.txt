V. Hieroglyphics.
By Professor th 8teiadoryr of Leipsiu.

Repeated attempts were made during the 17th aud 18th centuries
to decipher the peculiar picture-writing of the ancient Egyptians,
the learned Jesuit father Athanasius Kircher (1601-80) being
among the earliest to take up the subject. It was not, however,
until the beginning of the 19th century that the key was found,
though Sacy, a Frenchman, and Akerblad, a Swede, had previously
attained a certain amount of success in their (yirorts to find the clue.
Dr. Thomas Young, an English srholar, and Franenis C)hampol1ion,
a Frenchman, succeeded about the same date (vie in 1819 and in
1822) in discovering the loug-sought alphabet from a careful com-
parison of royal eartouohes. Champollion afterwards followed up his
initial discovery withsuch success that he may fairly rank as the real
interpreter of the Egyptian hieroglyphics.

The f'1vst clue was afforded by the famoixe ‘Roeetta Stone' (now in the
British Museum), discovered in 1799 in the Fort St. Julien at Ensella.
This tahlet of basalt bears three inscriptions: nne in the ancient Egyptian
language, written in hierog1yphies, (me in the populcvr language of a
later period inscribed in demntle characters, and " third in Greek; hut
the two last are merely translations of the first. The subject of the triple
inscriptinn is a decree of the Egyptian priests issued in 195 13.0. in honour
of Ptnlemy V. E iphanes. The first step luwards deciphering the hiero-
glyphics was ma e when it was ascerlained that the frequently occurring
groups nf signs each enclosed in an oval (sn-called carmuche) were the
names of kings and that the name of Ptolemy must be found among them.

C)hatnpollion and his successors established the phonetic signi-
tication of a large number of hieroglyphic symbols, and it then be-
came possible, from a knowledge of Coptic, the latest form ofthe
ancient Egyptian language, not only tn read but also to interpret
the inscriptions. H. Brugsuh, who led the Way to the complete
interpretation of demotic texts, was also the first to point out that
in hieroglyphic writing, as in the Semitic systems of writing, only
the consonants were inscribed, while the vowels were omitted as
not essential.

The Egyptian hieroglyphics form a system of picture-writing,
in which concrete objects were originally expressed by pictures re-
presenting- them; e.9.

Abstract ideas and verbs were represented on the same principle
by the use of pictures of objects suggesting in some sort the idea

to be expressed. Thus the idea 'to rule' lk' was expressed by the
picture of a sceptrel‘)7 'south' rf by a lilyge the botanical emblem
