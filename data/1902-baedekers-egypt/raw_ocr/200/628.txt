Ptolemazc Temple, ASSUIXN. 29. Route. 329

divided channel, appears small; but it still preserves its venerable
aspect, for everywhere, even on the rocks by the stream, are in-
serlptlons and numerous memorials ot' the grand old times.

Among the ruins of the ancient rity to the E. of the railway-
station lies a small and not very interesting PTOLEMAIC TEMPLE,
now buried III rubbish with the exception of the facade. The key
15 kept by an official uf the Administration des Autiquités. Built
by Eucrgetes I. and Philopator, but never quite completed, the
temple was dedicated to Isis of Syene.

la the centre of the fngade is the MAD! Portrar, n'owued with a con-
cave cornice; it IS now closed, the present entrance being by agap iu the
wall to the lett, Left Jamb: above, Eucrgetes presenting an image of Mam

gods Khuum, Hattie. and Anuhis, and Is'uergetes and his wife Bcreniee

chapels. The two side-ehmpels are f1ued uy; the reliefs in the central
chapel show Euergetes (once accompanied by Bereniee) before the various
deities of Syene.

Near the temple is a 1'oe1oittsirciptios1 of the reign nf Amenophis W.:

surt's rays descend.

To the S of the railway-station am the bases of several statues
of Roman emperors, with Latin votive iustriptious, perhaps on the
site of the old Praetorium. The new street on which these lie goes
on to the Cataract Hotel, passing the English Church, which was
built in 1800-.1900 by Mr. Somers Clarke in the style ot'a Coptic
chapel, with a dome.

A ride [llenhey there and back 5 pies.) may be taken to the CAMP
OF THE Wsuinis, situated within an ancient Arab cemetery, 3/4 ll.
to the E. of the town. These Arabs with their families live in
wretched tents covered with mats. Beduins of the 'Abibdell tribe,
differing both in type and dress from the Bishiriu, also have tents
bere. Both tribes speak a curious language, allied to Egyptian and
other E. African dialects. They support themselves by cattle-rearing
and by trading, especially with Senna-leaves, which they collect 1n
the desert and sell at good prices. The exhibitions and danees(Yau-
tasia') which they perform are simply invented to entertain the
tourist and have nothing national or chirraeteristic about them.
The handsome b'ishirin children, with thick curly hair: hawk chains
and other small articles about the town. - A iiue *Vlew IS c'ortt-
manded by the Tomb ofSlxélch Ilurzln, above the camp, to the right.

We may return vii the ancient ARAB CEMETERIES, which are
situated in the desert to the S. of the town. Each grave " marked
by a rectangle of unhewn stones and a slab bearing an inscription.
The tombs of the richer dead are small domed erections.
