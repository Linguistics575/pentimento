Mat, and Khons; in the Ptah aisle, the king before Ptah, Sekhmet
(Hathorj, and Neferiem. The sculptures (reliefs 'en ereux') are
of mediorre workmanship; they date from Ramses IL, who here
forgot his filirvl piety so far as to chisel away his father's reliefs to
make room for his own. The only interesting MURAL REPRESENTA-
TIONS are those in the lower row on the end-wall to the right. To
the right Thont and Horus pour over Ramses IL the holy water in the
form of the hieroglyphius for 'purity' and 'life'; to the left, Wep-wat,
with a jaekal's head, and Horus, with a hawk's head, 'the avenger
of his father', hold the hieroglyphic for 'life' before the k'rng's face;
nlose by, to the right, is Hathor of Dendera; farther to the left,
Ramses hands to Osiris and his companions, Isis and Horus, a case
for papyrus writings in the shape of a column held by a kneeling
king, with a hawk's head on the top as a lid.

Seven doors, placed in the axes of the built-up eatranturdoom
and the sanetuaries, lead from this first hall into the Second Hypo-
style Hall, which is higher and deeper. The arehitrave, on which
test the rooting slabs, is supported by 36 columns, arranged on either
side of the processional aisles in pairs on the same system as in the
preceding hall. The 24 columns in the tlrst two rows of columns
have papyrus-bud r:apita1s[p. xxxF). Beyondthe second rowthe Mor
of the temple is considerably raised, forming a platform upon which'
stands the third row of columns. The cylindlical shafts of these are
entirely destitute of capitals, but bear huge blocks of stone forming
an abacus for the support of the arehitrave. The inscriptions and
representations on the walls and columns date from the reign of
Sethos and are of admirable workmanship, but their subjects are ot
little general interest. The wonderful *Rzliefs on the right end-Wall
of the hall (Pl. b) should not be overlooked. Here, to the right, we
see Sethos I. standing before Osiris and Horus, with a censer and a
uosegay. 111 the next scene the king with the censer appears before
a shrine in the midst of which Osiris is enthroued; in front of the
god stand Meat and ltonpet (goddess of the year) and behind are Isis,
Amentet (goddess of the West), and Nephthys, with nine small gods
of the dead in the hackgrou nd, 011 Pier e is a representation of the
highly adorned saeredpost Tet, the fetish ofosiris ofBusiris, to the
right and left of which stands the king, wearing the. crown of Lower
Egypt (camp the representation on the pier at the S. end-wall,
P1. d). To the left of Pier e the king presents an image of Meat to
Osiris, Isis, and Roms, The king's profile is evidently a faithful
likeness and is everywhere portrayed with great artistic skill.

Adjoining this hall, in a direct line with the seven entrance
doors, are Seven Sanctuaries, of which that in the middle was de-
dicated to Amman, the chief deity under the New Empire, To
the, right are the sanctuaries of Osiris, Isis, and Horus; to the left
those of Harnrachis, Ptah, and the king. Each contained the sacred
