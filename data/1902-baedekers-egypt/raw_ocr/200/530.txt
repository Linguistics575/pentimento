The columns are not monolithic but are built up out of semi drums.
The material is a, reddish sandstone. Each of the twelve columns in the
two central rows is113/5 ft. V diameter. and upwards of 33 ft. in circum-
fcl'ence, i. e. as large rs Tr an 's Culumn III Rome or the Irend6me Column
in Paris. It requires six "men with outstretched arms to span one of
these huge columns. Their height is M) ft., that of the Capitals 11 ft.
The remaining 122 columns are each 42% k. in height and 61/2 ft. in
diameter.

The walls of the hall, the shafts of the columns, the ahaei, and
the architrave are covered with inscriptions and reliefs, many of
which still retain their ancient colouring. These date from the
reigns of Sethos I. and Ramses IL, the former of whom embellished
the N. half of the hall (as far as the 10th row of columns)7 the
latter the S. half. Only a single column (the first in the 6th row)
bears the name ofRamses I. Ramses m., Ramses IV. , Ramses TI.,
and Ramses XII. have also recorded their names. The scenes on
the columns show the king adoring the gods of Thebes. Those by
Sethus I. are in delicate ilat relief, those by Ramses II. in radar
sunk relief.
