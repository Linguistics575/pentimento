it rises again and attains its highest level (comp. p. 69). After
having begun to subside7 it generally rises again for l short time,
sometimes regaining and even passing its first culminating point.
At length it begins to subside steadily, and after a time the ile-
crease becomes more and more rapid. In January, February, and
March the fields from which the water has receded gradually dry
up, and in April, May, and the first few days of Jane the river is
at its lowest. When the river is low the water covers 7 ells lt? ft.)
of the Nilometer at Réda (p. 69); when it reaches 52/3 ells
[273/4 ft.) the inundation has attained the height most favourable
for agriculture at the present day.

Egypt is now no longer a vast lake during the inundation as
it formerly was, nor does the overflow of the fields take place in a
direct manner as is commonly supposed. In Upper Egypt the water
is conducted into a vast network of reservoirs and canals, and dis-
tributed as required, and special engineers are appointed for their
supervision. The whole of the cultivable land is divided into huge
basins (Md), in which the water introduced by the canals is main-
tained at a certain height until it has suffieiently saturated the soil
and deposited the requisite quantity of mud. After the water in the
river has subsided, that in the basins may either be discharged into
the river or into the canals, or it may be used for filling other ba-
sins lying at a lower level. During these operations many of the
villages are connected by means of ernba11kments only, while others
can only be reached by boat, and the whole country presents a
very peculiar and picturesque appearance. With the help of the
great Barrage (p. IH), the Delta is irrigated all the year round by
means of a network of canals. The principal CANALS in Upper Egypt
are the Sohag'iyeh (So uhagieh), which quits the river at Sohég (p.191) i
the 16rtrliirntyeh, which begins below Assirit. and ends to the N. of
Beuitsaéf; and the Balir Yusuf, which serves the Firyrim. In Lower
Egypt the chief canals are the Malyntsdtyeh and Khatatbeh, in the
W. Delta; the Balm Tim, the Balm Shibi‘n, and Es-son, in the
Central Delta; the Tewfiltlych, with its 1soutirruatious the Mao-
sariyeh and Baht ea-Sughair, the Bale Buhfyeh, the Balir Mu'iss,
and the Ismi'Wyelt Canal, in the E. Delta.

If the river and the system of canals connected with it are in
any way neglected the consequences are very disastrous, as was
notably the case during the latter part of the Byzantine supremacy
and under the disgraceful sway of the Marnelulres, when the fertile
soil ofEgypt yielded less than or1e-hali, of its average produce. The
mean difference between the highest and the lowest state of the
river is about 25 ft. at Cairo, 38 ft. at Thebes, and M) ft. at Aiusuiu.
Even in March and April the traveller will have an opportunity of
observing how powerful and rapid the flow of the river still is,
although its fall from Assuin (by the first cataract) to Cairo is
299 ft. only, or about seven inches per mile. The rapidity of the
