kingdom of the Pl1araolis with that widely extended Greek em-
pire which it was his great ambition to found. The site chosen
was opposite the island of Pharos, near the ancient Egyptian village
of Bhakotis, between the Mediterranean Sea and the Mareotic Lake
(p. 2i), which was connected with the Nile by several navigable
channels. The choice was both judicious and far-seeiug. For the
older, and apparently more favourably situated, harbours at the E.
end of the Delta, close to the Red Sea, were exposed to the danger
of being choked by the Nile mud, owing to a current in the Mediter-
ranean, beginning at the Strait of Gibraltar1 which washes the whole
of the N. African coast. Deinocratee, the architect, was entrusted
with the planning and building of the new city. After Alexanderâ€˜s
death, when his empire was divided among his generals, Ptolemy f.
Sober (323-280 B.C.) came into possession of Egypt. During his
wise and upright reign Alexandria became a great resort of artists
and scholars, including Demetrius Phalereus, the orator, who sug-
gested the foundation of the famous library, Apelles and Autiphilus,
the painters, Euclid, the mathematician, and Erasistratus and
Herophilus, the physicians. A history of Alexander the Great
written by Ptolemy himself has unfortunately been lost. This Ptol-.
emy also founded the Museum (p. 9), a splendid pile dedicated to
science and poetry, in which scholars dwelt as well as studied and
taught. Comp. p.1xxxvii.

Notwithstanding the continual dissensiuns among the Ptolemies
with regard to the succession to the throne (p. lxxxvii), which
seriously disturbed the peace of the city, the fame of Alexandria,
as the greatest centre of cummewe in the world and the thief seat of
Greek leaming, steadily increased, and in B.C. i8, when the
{omens interfered in the quarrels of Cleopatra and her husband
and brother Ptolemy KIT'., had reached its zenith. After the murder
of Pompey at Pelusium, Caeam entered Alexandria in triumph

emy XIV., and had considerable diffioulty in maintaining himself
in the Regia (see p. 9). Case! was afterwards conquered by the
oharms ot' theEgyptian queen, bat Antony fell more fatally into her
toils, and spent years of revelry with her at Alexandria [42-30].
Augustus enlarged the city by the addition of the'suhurb of Nica-
polis (p. 18). At this prosperous period Alexandria is said to have
numbered more than Guuf-mitior1 inhabitants. The Creek element
predominated, nest in importance to which was the Egyptian, while
a numerous, but exclusive, Jewish community was settled hexe as
early as the ith cent. BA).

The Greek scholar and traveller Strabo (3.0. 65-24] describes Alexan-
dria as it was in the decades immediately before the beginning ofour era,
in the 17th Book of his Geography. The former island ofPharos had been
united to the mainland by an embankment known as the Hcptastadium
(see p. 9), and on the E. extremity of the isluud rose the famous light-

house built by SoMratos, the Cnidian, in the reign of Ptolemy Ir. Phila- _
