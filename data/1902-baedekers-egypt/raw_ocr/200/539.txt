from the time of Amenophie H., of the 18th Dynasty. His name occurs

lying approximately from E. to w. Much further to the W. was a Pylon,
facing the river, but now destroyed; it was built by Sethoe I. and Ramses IL

sohools. In the vicinity were groves and lakes, besides granaries,
stables for the saorifitirl animals, barracks for the guards, prisons,
etc. Close by lay villages inhabited by the numerous workmen
who found employment in connection with the cemeteries: masons,
painters, builders, and above all embaimers, to whose care thehodies
were oommitted. Gradually a whole city arose here, like the quarters
beside the tombs of the Mamelukes at Cairo. Under the New Em-

known as 'prince of the West and director of the workers at the
