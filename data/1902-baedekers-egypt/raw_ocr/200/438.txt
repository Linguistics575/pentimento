usually less crowded than the others1 may be used in descending
the stream. In all these deviations from the usual tours, very strict
adherence to the terms of the special 1rmrigement is exacted.

Dahabiyehs. - Now that the visit to Upper Egypt is so much
facilitated by the railway and the regular services " tourist-steam-
ers, only those travellers to whom economy of time and money is
no object make the voyage in privately hired dahabiyehs or launches.
In Cairo the best dshabiyehs, comfortably and even luxuriously
fitted up, are those belonging to Messrs. Cook ' Son " steam-doa-
biyehs, G sailing dahabiyehs) and the AnyJo-American Co. (3 large
and 2 small steam-dahabiyehs, several sailing dahabiyehs). The
inclusive charge, e.g., for Cook’s excellent stsuun-duabiyeh 'Nito-
oris', is 400t. per month for 4 pets, 550t. for 6, or 675t. for 8. These
prices include not only the hire of the dahabiyeh and its full
equipment and the wages of the re'is or captain and the crew, bat
also the services of a dragoman and attendants, and provisions fex-
eept liquoro), donkeys, saddles, and all the incidental expenses of
excursions (excluding bakshish]. The charge for sailing dahabi-
yehs is, of course, less. In the case of head-winds small steam-ttw
may be hired for i)-8t. per day.

The traveller may also hire a dahabiyeh directly, i.e. indepen-
dently of the agents, and take the commissariat into his own
hands; but this is not recommended to inexperienced travellers. A
