The plans for Ihis dam, whirh will be the largest of the kind in the
world, were prepared by Egyntiau government otlierals, under the direction
nf Sir William Garstt'n, Um1er-:ceerehary of State. The construction is
entrusted to Messrs. John Aim] d; Co., of Liverpool; the chief engineer wan
.IIr Maurice Fitzmam'ice. The foar1iairontstorre was laid on Feb. 2nd, 1899,

original estimate of 2,000 OllOt, The reservoirvhasin ahuve the dam will
have a ohie capacity of 231.00%(00 gallons. It has been calculated that
the gain to Egypt from this dam thrnugh the irrigation of lands hitherto
beyond the reach of cultivation. wilt amount to 2,6fD,0f'M per annum.
The works would have been still more extensive and the storage hasir1
still deeper had it nut hecn apparent that in that case the island of Phila,
would have been pluced under water. - At the W. end of the darn is a
navigation eaual, with four locks, 260 n. in length and 32 ft. in breadth. a
Permission to inspect the works in usually readily granted on applie tion
to one of the chief engineers at Shelli] or at one of the omees of works.

Upwards of 10,000 workmen are engaged on the work; most of
these are Arabs, but there are also manyltalians and otherEuropesns,
An entire village has sprang up here, with woodeubarracks, canteens,
and shops for the workmen and houses for the offleials.

We now turn to the E., passing a cemetery for Christian workmen,
and regain the desert-route at the tomb of a shekh, near the ancient
1yri0lr-uall. .

The village of 'Shelli, {Challal}, where both the railway and the
desert route end, lies on the E. bank of' the Nile, opposite Philr.
The beautiful island, surrouu ded by clear smooth water and crowned
by its imposing temples and graceful kiosque, presents a striking
contrast to the rugged and barren rocky landscape that environs it.

The Island of Philae.

A comfortable tecr,v-boat plies to Philte from the E. bank (there and
back 5 pink; more is demanded at first).

Philae, the pearl of Egypt, is 500 yds. in length and 160 yds. in
breadth, and consists of a crystalline granite mixed with horn-
blende, beneath the alluvial deposits of the Nile. The modern name
is borrowed from the Greeks, and is derived from the ancient Egyp-
tian Pi-hrk, " the 'island of Lak'. The Oopts called it Pilakh, . .
'the corner', and the Arabs used to call it Bilab. Now-a-days none
of these names are known to the natives, who call the island anr
or Gemini Ana: el-Wog0d, after the hero of one of the tales in the
Thousand and One Nights, which has its scene transferred to Phihe
in the Egyptian version.

The boatmen relate it as follows. ‘Once upon a time there was a
king, who had a handsome favourite named Aims pl-Wagad, and a vizier,
whose daughter was named Zahr gl- Ward, Lu. Flower, of the Rose. The
