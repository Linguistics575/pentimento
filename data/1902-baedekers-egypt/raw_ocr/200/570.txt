while priests offer incense 01- perform other rites. On the end-well is re-
presented the door that led into the kingdom of the dead.

In the W. wall of the Upper Court is a series of RECESSES, a1-
ternetely large and small, containing representations of Thutmo-
S18 III. and Makere in presence of the gods. In the middle is the
entrance to the Sanctuary. In the left comer opens the small
Room ll, "l the right the s0-es1led Hall of Ammon, both of which
may be omitted by hurried visitors.

HOOMJi: The ceiling is well preserved. 0n the right wall appears
Amfnon-Re. in front of an altar, which replaces the eifeeed tigurc of Ma-
keret Behinq the altar is the queen's guardian spirit, 0n the rear-Wall
are Thutrnosis III. and Tthmnsis I. (subatituted for Makere) offering
clothes to Amman. On the left Thutmosis II. [substituted for Makere)
offers sacred oil to the ithyphallie Amman.

HALL " Annex. Part of the ceiling, decorated with stars on a blue
ground, still remains. On the left sidewall we observe Makere pacing
oet the temple-pl‘ecinets, before Ammon, before the ithyphallie Ammon-
11iu, end before the enthroned Ammon. 0n the right wall is Thutmosis III.
before_ these same gods. 0n the end-wall is Thutmosia II. (originally
Maker-c) hefure Amman. The figures of the gods here were defaced by
Amenophla IV. and were not replaced at the restoration under Ramses II.

A granite Portal, reached by an approach dating from the Ptole-
maic period, with balastrades, forms the entrance to the SANCTUARY.
The three chambers (P1. E, F, G) are unfortunately much damaged.
The first two have vaulted ceilings and are adjoined by recesses. The
representations in the lat Chamber (P1. E) show Makere (sometimes
Thutmosis III.) saoriiioing to various deities, among whom figures
the deceased Thntmosis II.

On the upper part of the right well is a noteworthy scene: Makere,
Thutmosie 111., and the princess Ranofru Baeritiee to the boat of Am-
man, behind which stood Thutmoeis I. with his consort Ahmes, end their
little daughter Bitnofru. A similar scene was represented above the
recess (P1. a) on the left wall; the kneeling Thulmosis m. end Princess
Ranofru may still be distinguished.

The 3rd Room (P1. G) was restored under Euergetes II. The
reliefs and inscriptions of this late period Compare very unfavour-
ably with the masterly sculptures of Makere.

In the rocks to the N. of the central court is the tomb of 2r'atru, a
queen of the Middle Empire. The passage, only about 3ft. high, leads
into a sepulchral chamber, covered with inscriptions. This tomb (explored
by Ebers) was probably covered up during the building of the temple. -
Near the keeper's house (p. u78) is a large shaft-tomh (perhaps of the
Middle Kingdom), ewnvated by Carter in 1900.

A few yards to the N. of the Lower Court is the square well-shark,
forming the entrance tn the common Tomb of the Thehan Priests, which
was discovered in 1891 by Gi-cbeut, and which yielded a rich antiquarian
booty now in the Museum of Gizeh (p. 101)).

The Shaft in which the famous discovery of Kings' Mummies was
made in 1881 (p. 101) is now filled up. It lies less than 1/2 M. to the S.
of the temple of Der el~bahri.

A short distance to the E. of the temple of Dh el-lrabri, in the
direction of the temple of Ifurna, we reach avalley between the hill
of Shékh 'Abd 'sl-Fumes on the 8. and the cliffs of the Dér el-bahri
valley oo the N. and E. Here lies the uecropo1is known by the Arabs
