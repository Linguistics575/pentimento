314 Route 26. KOM EL-AEMAR.

0n the Left Wall are unfinished; the red lines to assist the 1raug.hfymsn
may still be noticed. The Rear Wall is much damaged; tolthe fight we
see the deceased and his wife at table, to the left, the relatives "1 rows.

The tomb of Renni. nomarch and high-priest, still farther to
the left (W.), contains representations resembling those in the
tomb of Paheri (p. 313), but not so skilfully executed.

On the Left Wall are hervest-seenes', the deceased and his wife at
table, with their relatives seated opposite. On the Right Wall, the funeral

and accompanying ceremonies. In the Rear Wall is a recess with a seated
statue of the deceased, now quite destroyed.

The last three tombs farther to the left(W.jappear to date from
a period before the New Empire.

One of these belongs to a man and his wife Au-Vornu a lady attached
to the royal harem. Another (with " vaulted ceiling) hclonged to Benz
and his wife 8ebek-nalrhu, who also Was a lady of the harem. The third
consists of a vaulted chamber with a tastefully adorned ceiling and a room
with the shaft. It dates from the reign of Sebek-hotep ll. (13th Dyn.).

A little to the W. of the hill of tombs stood a small Temple of
Thutmosis IH., now destroyed.

On the W. bank opposite B1-Kib, about 1/2 M. from the river,
lies the village of' Muissdt (hfo'is6t), and farther on, about 3 M. from
the river, on the edge of the desert, rises the -

K6m el-Ahmm ('Red Hill‘), with the ruins and tombs of Hiera-
konpolis.

Hierukonyolis (Egypt. Nekhen) was one of the most ancient cities in
the country and perhaps originally the capital of Upper Egypt. Its god was
a Horus, to whom the sparrow-hawk was sacred, whence arose the Greek
name Hierakonpolis ('city of hawks‘). A little to the N., beyond a broad
desert route, is a second mass of ruins, amongst which is a large Fort, with
a lower outer wall and a high inner wall of unhumt bricks. On the E.
side is a sally-port. In the adjoining cultivated laud lay the Temple of
Nekhen, in which Quibel] discovered in 1897-38 some important seulpturar
of the earliest period, besides others of later date, including the bronze
group of Pepi r. and his sun (p. 80) and a i'me bronze hawk. - To the
W, are a few rock»tombs of the Early and Middle Empires, one without
inscriptions and two with designs and ins0riptior1s upon stucco. - About
I/4 hr. farther to the w., also on the hill of K6111 el-Alimar, are eight rock-
tombs, dating from the beginning of the New Empire, of which only the
first to the right or ti. (Thouli, of the time of Thutmosis I.) and the first
tc the left or S. (Harmoté, high-priest of Nekheu) repay a visit. The
structure of these tombs resembles that of the tombs at el-EO. At the
inner end of each is a recess with a statue of the deceased and his wife.
In the tomb of Ilarmose danciug-girls are painted upon stucco.

27. Edfu.

Edfu is a steamboahslation. The 1'otgrisf8feamers spend a night here
on their upward journey. The Railway Btutiitth (p. 308) is opposite the town,
on the E. bank.
