presided over by governors (mrh(ifes) of their own, and are indepen1-
dent of the provinci a1 administration: Cairo, Alexandria, the Isthmus
and Suez, EIJArish, and Damietta. The eight Upper Egyptian
provinces are those of (itselv, Berti.su7, Fayilm, Minyeh, Ania} (with
the oases of Dékhel and e1-KhirgelO, Giryeh, Keneh, and Assm‘m.

The chief ofiirl in every province is the Jfudtr. Each mudir
and mohéfez is assisted by a council, or 'diwtrn', of other oftUers.
This council in the provinces consists of a Wakil, or vioe-governor;
a chief clerk, tax-gatherer, and accountant, who is always a Copt;
a J.rifi, or supreme judge, and the chief authority in spiritual mat-
ters; sometimes the president of a chamber of commerce and. chief
authority in civil affairs; a superintendent of police; an architect
for the supervision of canals and other public works; and lastly the
chief physician of the province. The provinces are subdivided into
districts, called Markus, the chief oifiif1als of which (hfa'rmir) are
directly subordinate to the mudir and have their ofiieia1 residence
in the more important towns. Subordinate to the ma'mtir again is
the rOmdeh, or chief magistrate of the Nahiyeh, " commune, Which
may be either rural or urban. 1n the larger communes the 'orndelt
is assisted by the Shékh el-beled, or mayor. The larger towns are
divided into quarters each of which has its magistrate; several such
qu arters form an urban district under the jurisdiction of a Shékh el-
tumn, or prefect., corresponding in rank to the governor of a provincial
district.

foreigners. The numbers of males and females were approximately
equal. The settled population was distributed in 3692 towns and
villages and 14,449 hamlets, farms, etc. Taking the cultivable area
of the country into account (see p. xxxi), the above figures show a
