heaps of débris. 0n the top of the hill it divides. The branch to the
left leads back to the town, from the houses of which the Mosque
of Sultan Hasan (p. 49) stands out conspicuously. The road, first
in a straight direction , afterwards inclining to the right, leads to
the uecropolis known as Imam Shéfe’i (p. 68).

3. Balm; and the Island of Gezireh.

Bitliu.t Cor Boulaq), the river-harbour of Cairo, situated beyond
the Isma‘iliyeh Canal, is reached from the Ezbekiyeh via the Sharia
Balcilc and the bridge of Abu LEleh (P1. A, B, 3; electric tramway,
p. 27). its narrow streets present a very busy scene, aitbrding a
more characteristic picture of Oriental life than the capital. Goods
are conveyed hither from Upper Egypt, from Nubia, and from the
fertile Delta. The principal quay, nearly opposite the Ghezireh
Palace Hotel (p. 76), is most frequented between October and De-
oember, when the rapids of the river are most easily navigated.

At the N. mid of the town is situated the Arsenal, founded in
J835, with a manufactory of weapons attached to it. Machinery for
Egyptian manufactories arriving from Europe is put together at
Bela]; before being sent to its final destination, and all repairs of
machinery are executed here. 1hiltrls also boasts of a large Iron
Foundry, a Khedivial Technical School, a Paper Manufaetory, a
House of Correction for Women, a Lunatic Asylum, and the Govern-

The island of Gezirch (Gezilret Jh'thf,k) lies in the Nile opposite
Bt1liir. Travellers cross in a few minutes by motor-Iaunch (in
winter only) or by rowing-boat. The mad thither crosses the hand-
some Great Nile Bridge adjoining the Futr en-Mt (P1. A, 5 , p. 40),
the extensive barracks of Cairo. The bridge, about 420 yds. in
length, was built by a French iron company. The buttresses, which
were constructed with the aid of air-tight 'eaissons', are of solid
stone, and are 55 yds. apart. The bottom of the foundations is
about 45 ft. below the level of the river when at its lowest. At a
very early hour in the morning an interesting and picturesque crowd
of peasantry may be seen congregated here for the purpose of paying
duty on the wares they are bringing to market. The Nile bridge
is opened for the passage of vessels through it for an hour in the
morning and another in the afternoon (announced on the notice-
boards), and is then impassable for foot-passengers and carriages.

The starting-place of the electric tramways to the Museum and
Pyramids of Gizeh is situated on the Island of Gezireh, immediately
beside the bridge (comp. pp. 77, 112). The S. part of the island,
to the right of the road (Which the tramway follows), is adorned
with a beautiful avenue of lebbek-trecs, which is througed with
