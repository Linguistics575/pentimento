of the temple-obelisks; ships and soldiers hastening to a festival. Pl. d.
Two shim bringing the obelisks from the quarries of Assutm to Thebes.

Within the S. evJonnade, at intervals of about 10 ft., are holes hewn
in the rock, which were forgerly iilled with Nile mud and used for plants.
Remains of palms, vines, and the like are still extant.

We now ascend the approach to the Central Court, on the S.
side of which we can best observe the careful workmanship of the
retaining walls, intended to obviate any movement of the soil. They
consist of finely polished blocks of limestone, with simple but
effective ornamentation. Broad pilasters, only 3 inches in depth,
and placed at wide intervals, project from the wall. Above each
are a gigantic hawk and a serpent. The W. side of the court is-
bounded by a terrace bearing two "olonnades, that to the right
named the Birth Colonnade, that to the left the Punt Colonnade.

The BIRTH COLONNADE contains It pairs of square pillars sup-
porting the roof. On all four sides of the pillars is the same scene:
Ammon (a later addition) laying his hand in blessing upon the
shoulder of Makere (figure defaced throughout) or Thutmosis III.
The inscriptions and representations on the walls of the colonnade
refer to the proomsatior1 and birth of the queen (P1. e). Among
these are two tine figures of the queen-mother Alunes, once in
presence of the ram-headed Khnum and the frog-headed Heket,
and once in presence of the ibis-headed Thout. - Two steps at the
N. and of this colonnade descend to a Vestibule with 12 sixteen-
sided columns in three rows. 0n the walls are fine reliefs.

In the 8. Wall is a small Races: with representations of the queen (ef-
faced) heiore various deities; above appears the queen (again scratched
out) before Osiris. To the left of the recess is Aunhis with the queen
standing behind him; to the right are Nekhbct and Harmaehis, between
whom were the names of the queen. - In the N. Wall is a similar Recess.
Above it is Thntmosie III. making a wine-offering to the hawk-headed
Sukaris, god of the dead; to the right, Anubis and the queen (seratehed
out); to the left, the queen (scratched out) standing in a chapel before the
fetish of Eme-wet. - 0n the W. (rear) Wall, the queen (scratchea out) sacri-
f'seirvg to Amman (to the left) and to Anubis (to the right), with the sacri-
fiisiat gifts heaped up before each god.

Three steps at the hack of the auteehamber lead to a Cnnm 0F Axnns,
which has three chambers with pointed vaulting. The colouring of the
mural decorations is admirably preserved, though the figure of the queen
is invariably semtrhed out. They represent Makcre [Thutmosis occurs
once on the E. wall of the second chamber) before various deities, espe-
cially Anubis.

Oa the N. side of this court is another COLONNADE, the roof of
which is supported by 15 sixteen-sided columns. It is ur1tinished
and the walls were never decorated. Behind it are four chambers
(now walled up), the walls of which were also left 11r1decoratiul.

We now turn to the COLONNA‘DE 017 PUNT, on the S. side of the
w. terrace, exactly corresponding with the Birth Colonnade. The
*Scenes on thewalls, unfortunately much damaged, commemorate en
Expedition to Punt (p. 232), undertaken during the queen’s reign.
0n the S. Wall we see a village in Puut(P1. f). The houses are
