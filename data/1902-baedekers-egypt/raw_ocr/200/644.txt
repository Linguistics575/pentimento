of Isis. PHILAE. 29. Route. 341

The SECOND PYLON is smaller (105 ft, broad, 40 ft. high) and
less mr11-presuved than the first pylon. The Portal between the
towers, approached by a shallow ilight of steps, was built by Euer-
gates II. and embellished with reliefs of the usual type.

. The large_relief on the Right Tm: represents the Pharaoh Neos
Dionysus plaeiag the slaughtered si1crili It] animals before Horns and
Hnthor. Above are two small reliefs; to the right, Neos Dionysus presenting
a wreath to Horas and Nephthys; to the lett, Neos Dionysus mrmng in-
cunsc and pouring water upon an altar, in presence of Osiris, Isis, and
Horns. The granite of the site at the that of the tnwerhas been snmothed
to fame stele, with a six-lined inscription and reliefs relating to a. lavish
giant ot lanes. made to the temple of leis by Philoruvtor in the 21th year
at his reign (157 Bil). In front of it, are the foundations of a small
Chapel (PL m). - 0n the Left Tower are similar scenes (tigures deliberately
defaced). On both towers are grooves for the flirg-statrs.

An inner staircase ascends to the W. pylon (comp. the Plan), whence
we proceed across the central portal to the E. pylon. The ascent rut the
1'tvst pylon (p. 333) is, however, preferable in every reipect.

Within the doorway, at the top, to the right, are some much
faded early-Christien pictures.

The TEMPLE DP ISIS PROPER, entered by this portal, consisted
of an open Court (here very small], a Hypostyle Hall or Prouaos,
several Vestibules, and a Sanctuary, with smaller chambers adjoin-
ing, The walls are covered both uutside and inside with reliefs of
Ptolemies (Philadelphus, Euergetes ll., etc.) and Roman emperors
(Augustus, Tiberius, Antoninus) performing the customary cere-
monies in the guise of Pharaohs; but the traveller will 11nd detailed
desesiytions of similar scenes in our accounts of the temples ot'
Dendera (p. 227) and Exlfu o. 315j.

The OPEN COURT had a small covered hall on each side, tho
roof of which rested on a single column. The uncovered portion could
be shaded from the sun by means of a velurium; the hole”. for the
cords are still visible in the upper part of the concave curnice turned
towards the second pylon.

The HYPDSTYLE HALL, with eight columns, was originally sep-
arated from the preceding court by screen-walls between the first
row of columns. The colouring of this hall, which has been pre-
served on the ceiling and the columns7 must have been very bril-
liant. The floral capitals of the columns both in the court and this
hall Are the most instructive of all the specimens that have come
down to us of the manner in which the Egyptians of the later period
noluured their columns. comparatively little regard was paid to the
natural colours; 6.9. light green palm-twigs receive blue ribs, etc.

Christian services Were celebrated in the court and hall, of which
the numerous Coptic crosses chiselled in the walls are memorials. A
Greek inscription in the doorway to Room D, on the right, recome that
'this good work‘ took place under Bishop Theodurns. This was In the
reign of Justinian.

. The small VESTIBULES (Pl. D, E,r) preceding the Sanctuery
are adjoined by chambers lying in darkness, The SANCTUARY,wh1t-h
has two tiny windows, still contains a pedestal placed here by Ener-
