At the left (S.) end of the Punt Colonnade is a curious little
Sauna: 0F HATHOR, goddess of the dead o. cxxvi), which was also
reached from below by a fligbt of steps. The innermost chambers,
which are bewn in the rock, are preceded by two covered Colonnades

square pillars with Hathor- capitals; the second, which lay at a slightly
