The. Trusts of the tombs, from the entrance to the thust chamber,
were covered with sacred pictures and texts, I knowledge of which was
esste!iy for the deceased in the future life. The prevailing conception
nt Biban el-31ubik was that the deceased king, accompanied by the sun<
god (or rather absorbed in the sun-god), sailed through the underworld
at night in a boar; thus those scenes and texts were preferred which
described this voyage and instructed the deceased as to the exact route.
These texts Were taken from two books, closely related to each other.
One was called 'The Book of that which is in the Underworld’. According
to this, the underworld (2'urat; p, cxxiv) is divided into 12 regions, cor
responding to the 12 hours of night; and the descriptions in the book
were therefore likewise in 12 chapters. In each of these the river with
the boat of the sun tloating on it is represented in the middle; in the
boat stands the ram-headcd sun-gnd, surrounded by his retinue, and
bringing for a short time light and life to the regions he traverses. Above
and below are shown the two banks of the river, thronged by all manner
of spirits, drernons, and monsters, which greet the sun and ward " his
enemies.

The second book, known as the 'Book of the Portals', reproduces the
same conceptions. The nocturnal journey of the sun through the 12 WV
gions of the underworld is again represented, and, as in the first book,
these regions are conceived of as provinces or names. Massive gates,
guarded by gigantic serpents, separate one region from another; each gate
hears a name known to the san-god, and the deceased must know it also.
Two gods and two Mis-spitting, snakes guard the approach and greet the
sun- od.

i third work, which may he called 'The Sun‘s Journey in the Under-
world‘, contains still more gloomy and unattractive representations. The
sun-god has arrived in the underworld and addresses a speech to the
spirits and monsters, which are carefully depicted in long rows.

Recourse was had to other works also for the decoration ofthe king's
tombs. The chief of these Were the 'Praisiny of RE‘, and 'ilre Book of
the Queuing of the Mouth‘. The former, which was used in the first cor-
ridors, contains a long-winded hymn to the sunrgod, to be recited in the
evening as the sun entered the underworld. In the enurse of the hymn
the god is invoked under 75 ditferent names and is depicted in as many
forms. - The text, and illustrations in the second of these works teach
the multifarious ceremonies which had to be performed before the statue
of the deceased king in order to iudue it with life and ensure it the use
of its Organs, so as to enable it to eat and drink in the tomb.

Strubo tells ot'AO tumhs 'worthy ofa visit', the scholars of the French
Expeditinu mention H, while at present 41 are accessible, on the entrances
of which their numbers are inscribed. Pausanias, Elian, I1e1ior1orus,
Ammianus Maroellinusr and other ancient authors refer to them as the
Syringes (cu’pt yes) of Thebes, which name also tenure in the Greek in-
scriptions wit in the tombs. The word 'Syriax' meant first a shepherd‘s
pipe formed of longish reeds, then it came to mein a el1y,,l0w passage,
and thus was applied to the long rock-hewn passages of Biban isl-Muiiik.

There are two routes from the Temple of Sethos at Kuma to
Bibtrn el-Muh‘ik (s donkey-ride of 3/4 hr.). The lower of these is
described below. The mountain-track vit Asasif and Dir el-bahri,
more fatiguing though shorter, is better followed on the return
(comp. p. 278).

The lower route passes the spring to the N, of the Temple of
Sethos, leaves the necropolis of Drah Abu'l Negga (p. 262) to the
left, and winds through the valley (Wadi), ilrst to the N.W., then to
the W. The gorge gradually contracts. between walls ofnaked yellow
