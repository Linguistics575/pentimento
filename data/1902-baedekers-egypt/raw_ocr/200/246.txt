several times subsequently. The town suffered severely in other
ways also, and indeed its whole history, so far as recorded, like
that of the sultans and the Mamelukes themselves, seems to have
presented an almost continuous succession of revolutions, rapine, and
bloodshed. As most of the Mameluke Sultans who resided in the
citadel died a violent death, so the reign of almost every new po-
tentate began with hitter and sanguinary contests among the emirs
for the offiee of vizier, while but few reigns were undisturbed hy
insurrectious in the capital. During the third r√©gime of Mohammad
en-Ni.sir, who hail been twice deposed and as often recovered his
throne, a persecution of the Christians took place at Cairo. The
Christians, of whom great numbers resided in Cairo and throughout
the whole of Egypt, were accused by the people of incendiarism. Their
churches were closed or demolished, while they themselves were so
ill-tmated and oppressed, especially in the reign of Sultan $12M:
(1351-54), that many of them are said to have embraced Islamism.
In 1386 and 1307, in the reign of Sultan 8lia'bdrt, sanguiuary eon-
f1iets took place in the streets of Cairo between hostile parties of
Mamelukes, and in 1377 Sha%in himself was tortured and strangled
in the oitsdel. Even greater disorders attended the dethronement
of Sultan Barledlc (1389), when the wildest anarchy prevailed at
Cairo, the convicts escaped from their prisons, and in concert with
the populace plundered the houses of the emirs and the public
magazines. The following year another rebellion among the Ma-
melukes restored Burl.ttll.t to the throne. Seareely, however, had he
closed his eyes and been succeeded by Farag (1399), when the Ma-
melukes again revolted, and renewed oonfliets took place for posses-
sion of the citadel, during which the city was partly plundered.
Similar scenes were repeated on almost every change of government.
The turbulence of the Memelukes, who were always treated with
too much consideration by the saltans, became more and more un-
bearable; they robbed the people in the markets, assaulted citizens
in the public streets, and grossly insulted respectable women.

On 26th Jan., 1517, the Osman sultan Selim L, after having
gained a victory in the neighbourhood of Heliopolis (p.107), en-
tered the city. Ttmin Bey, the last Mameluke sultan, was taken
prisoner and executed (p. 48). Selim caused the fiatyst marble
columns which adorned the palace in the citadel to be removed to
Constantinople. Theneeforward Cairo became it mere provincial
capital, and its history is almost an entire blank down to the period
of the French expedition. - On 22nd July, 1798, after the Battle
of the Pyramids, Cairo was occupied by Bonaparte, who established
his headquarters here for several months, and quelled with san-
guinary severity an insurrection which broke oat among the pop-
ulace on 23rti-2iith September. At the beginning of the year 1799
Bonaparte started from Cairo on his Syrian expedition, and on his
return to France7 Kleber was left as eommander-in-ehief of the
