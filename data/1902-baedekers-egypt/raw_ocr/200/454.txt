The VESTIBULE which formerly stood behind an open court, is
borne by two columns with sixteen edges and tapering towards
the top. The cornice projects considerably above the arehitrave
and is ostensibly supported by thte lathe heWu, like all the rest of
the structure, out of the living rock. The resemblance of these Iaths
to the mutules of the Dorie order is worthy of mention.

The TOMB CHAMBER was divided by two pairs of columns into
three slightly vaulted sections. Most of the scenes were painted on
a thin layer of stucco, with which the limestone walls were coated.
At the foot is a long inscription cut in the rock, in lines of a. greenish
colour, 21/2 ft. high, containing the above interesting excerpt from
Egyptian provincial history. In 1890 the nord names were cut out
of the rock by some vandal hand and the paintings have also un-
fuxttlnately st1ireved so much in the last 30 or to years, that the
subjects of some of them are now almost indistinguishable
