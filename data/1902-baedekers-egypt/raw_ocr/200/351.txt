118 Route 8. GREAT PYRAMID. Pyramids

to avoid the discomfort of arriving breathless and heated at the
summit. The space at the top at present is about 12 yds. square,
so that there is abundant room for a large party of visitors.

The **V1EW is remarkably interesting and striking. There is
perhaps no other pmSpeet in the world in which life and death,
fertility and desolation, are seen in so close juxtaposition and in
such marked contrast. To the W. (S.W. and MW.) extend yellowish
brown and glaring tracts of sand, interspersed with barren cliffs.
The huge and colourless monuments erected here by the hand of
men remind the spectator, like the, desert itself, of death and
eternity. On a bare plateau of rock stand the other pyramids and
the Sphinx, rearing its head from the sand, like some monster suf-
focated by the (lust. To the s., in the distance, rise the pyramids
of Abugir, Sakkéra, and Dal1sld1ri to the N. stretch the. mylds in
the valley of' the Nile. Towards the E., on the other hand, glitters
the river, on each bank of which stretches a tract ofrieh arable
land, luxuriantly clothed with blue-green vegetation, and varying
in breadth. The fields are, intersected in every direction by canals,
on the banks of Which rise stately palms, waving their tlesible fan-
like leaves, and interlacing their shadows over the fella}; villages
perched like rrnt-hills on embankments and mounds. In the direction
of Cairo runs the long straight iurrriage-road. Immediately before
us rises the Citadel with its striking minarets; while the Mokattam
hills, which form the chief mass of colour in the landscape, gleam
in the morning with a pale golden tint, and in the evening with a
violet hue.

The descent of the Great Pyramid is more rapidly accomplished
than the ascent, but is hardly less fatiguing. Persons liable to
giddiness may find it a little trying, but the help of the Beduins
removes all danger.

INTERIOR (comp. Platt, p. 117). A visit to the interior of the
Great Pyramid is comparatively uninteresting to the ordinary tourist.
It will be found fatiguing, and an interval of rest between the ascent
and this expedition is recommended. Travellers who are in the,
slightest degree predisposed to npoplectin or fainting fits and ladies
travelling alone should not attempt to penetrate into these stit1ing
recesses. The explorer has to crawl and clamher through low and
narrow passages, which, at places, espenially near the entrance, are
not above 31/2 ft. high and kit, wide. The stones on the floor are
often extremely slippery, and the close air smells strongly of bets.
The temperature of' the interior is 79° Fahr. The attempts of the
guides to goad the visitor into inconvenient hurry should be dis-
rvgarded.

The Entrance (Pl. al is on the N. side (as in all pyramids), on
the thirteenth tier of stones, at a perpendicular height otU8 ft. from
the ground. The long passage a r, which is now only 3 ft. 4 in. in
width and 3 ft. ll in. in height, deseetu1s in a straight direction
