No. 10 is the Tomb of Amen-meses, one of the pretenders to the
throne at the end of the 19th Dyn. (p.1xxxiii). His mother Tekhat
and his wife Beket-ir were also buried here. The representa-
tions in this tomb have been deliberately destroyed.

"No. 11. Tomb of Ramses III. This imposing tomb, usually
called 'Bruee's Tomb' or 'The Harper’s Tomb', is inferior in size
only to No. 17 and No. M. The style of the sculptures is not the
best, but the variety and richness of the representations are unex-
celled. This tomb possesses a unique peculiarity in the ten side-
chambers, opening off the first two corridors. The tomb was begun
and finished as far as Room m by Setrurkht, father ofRamses 11L;
his cartouches are still to be seen at various places where the later
stucco has fallen off.

The entrance is approached by the usual flight of steps with
inclined plane; on each side of it are two pilasters with bull's
heads. Over the door is the usual representation of Isis and Neph-
thys, as at No. 8. - CORRIDOR 1. To the right and left of the
entrance are kneeling figures of the goddess Maat, sheltering those

sun (as above) between a serpent, a crocodile, and two gezelles’
heads. Then follows the text of the 'praising of IN', which is con-
tinued on the Right Wall. - Smn CHAMBER 1 (to the left) ', Baking,

On both sides the 'praising of Rri' is continued, with the appro-
priate tigartys of the god (p. 263], who approach Isis on the left
wall and Nephthys on the right. - SIDE CHAMBER 3 (t0 the left).
In the Upper Row (beginning on the left entrance-wall) we see a
kneeling Nile-god bestowing bis gifts upon seven gods of fertility
(with ears of corn on their heads); and (beginning on the right
entrance-well) a Nile-god before the serpent-headed goddess Napret
C'eorn0, tive royal snakes, clad with aprons, and two gods of fer-
tility. In the dilapidated Lower Row, to the left, the Nile-god of
Upper Egypt presents gifts to ten clothed royal serpents; to the
right, the Nile-god of Lower Egypt before Napret and three royal
serpents. - SIDE CHAMBER 4 (to the right) may be called the king's
ermoury, for its walls are covered with representations of weapons,
