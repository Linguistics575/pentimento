The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (pp. xxxi, Cii), occupying an area
approximately equal to that of Central Europe, extends from a line
drawn at Fares (p. 376), above Wadi Halfa, on the N., to beyond
the tenth parallel of latitude on the S. It includes the provinces of
Dangolu, Berber, fGartfsm, Kassala, Kordopin, Fashoda, and 8err-
near, and the smaller districts of dei Hal/‘a and Suukim The
British and Egyptian flags ily side by side in the Sudén, and the
rights of the joint possessors are defined by a convention signed on
Jan.19th, 1899. The interest on the Sudan war-loan (p. ciii) is
guaranteed to the British Empire, while Egypt bears the east of
the army and is responsible for any detteit (IE 98,000 in 1900).
The army consists of 16 battalions of Egyptian troops and a few
companies of British soldiers. The Governor-General and Sirdér of
the Egyptian Army is a British ot'fietyr, appointed by the Khedive
on the recommendation of the British government, without whose
consent he may not be dismissed. The Mudirs (p. xxxii) of the 1lro-
vinces are British officers also. At present military government and
martial law prevail throughout the Sudan, though a civil court of two
instances was established at Jfhartfun in March, 1901 (camp. ll, xx).
An ad valorem tax of 20 per cent is levied upon the export of gum
(400 tons in 1900), india-rubber, ivory, and ostrieh-festhers;
certain articles ofgeneral consumption are taxed 10 per cent of their
value in the towns; and among the other sources of revenue are taxes
upon date-palms, irrigation-wheels, and boats, the ptsdlars' tax,
prospecting and mining licences, the house tax, and the land sale
tax. The considerable import, trade in cotton goods and articles
for barter with the natives is in the hands of Greek and Arab
merchants. Beside the Egyptian coins the Maria Theresa dollar,
equivalent to about 20 pias., is currenh

The climate resembles that of Upper Egypt Cp. lxi), though the
maximum of temperature is higher and the occasional variations
have a greater range. At Kharttun the maximum heat is reached
twice a year, in April and September (109"Fahr. oa2ist Sept.,1900).
