On the W. bank, to the N. ofElephantine, rises shill, crowned
with the tomb of a Shékh, in which are excavated the *ltock Tombs
of the princes and grandees of Elephantine. These, most of which
were opened in 1885-86 by Sir r. Grenfell, date from the close of
the Ancient Empire and from the Middle Empire and are therefore'
contemporary with the tombs at Benil1asan, which they resemble
both in construction and decoration. The more important tombs
are now kept closed. Tickets should not be Forgotten.

We cross the river in a small boat (there and back, 5 pias. each
person). From the landing-place we ascend a sandy path, which
reaches the top at Tomb 31. The ancient staircase, hewn in the
rock and consisting of two parallel frvghts of about 85 steps, with an
inclined plane between them up which the sarcophagi were drawn,
is now covered by the sand. The view from the tombs is fine.

We begin with Tomb No. 25, belonging to Mekhu. This dates
from the 6th Dyn.; and both its construction and decoration are
somewhat article It contains 18 somewhat roughly worked columns
in 3 rows. Between two columns opposite the entrance is a stone
table with three legs, which was perhaps used as an altar. 0n the
rear-wall, opposite the entrance, is a door-shaped stole, within a
recess approached by steps and closed by a screen-wall. The IE-
presentations on the walls and columns show the deceased receiving
various votive gifts. To the right ofthe entrance offerings are being
made to the deceased; to the left of this are agricultural scenes
[ploughing ; harvest; asses bringing home the harvest). - Adjoining
is Tomb No. 26, belonging to Sahni, son of Mekhu. The remark-
able entrance is divided by a eross-heam into two parts - the
door proper and a window above it, The tomb chamber, with
14 square pillars, is of little interest. A relief on the Rear Walt
represents the deceased in l boat, accompanied by his daughters,
hunting in the marshes: to the left he appears holding the jevelin
in his right hand and the slain birds in his left; to the right he
appears harpooning two tish at a blow; in the middle is u Iurpyrus-
thieket with birds hovering about it.

Climbing up to the right (N) from this tomb, we pass several
others (Nos. 27, 29, 30) Whirh are sanded up, and reach -

No. 28, that ofHeka-yeb (locked). In the small chamber is a
representation of the deceased as a negro, with a dark-bmwn skin.
- Farther on is -

*No. 31, the fine tomb of Si-reupowet, son of Satet-hotep, and a
prince under Amenemhét II. Beyond a narrow Passage follow a Hall
with (l square columns (without decoration) and then a. Corridor
(locked) with three recesses on each side. Each of these recesses
eontains a statue of the deceased in the guise 0fthe Osiris mummy.
Before the first on the left side appears the deceased followed by
his son. At the end of the corridor is a small Hall, with four pil-
lars, on each of which “men": thCdiaetyasied. The lines dividing the
