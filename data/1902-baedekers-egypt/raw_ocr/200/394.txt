HELWAN. 10. Route 155

back as the time ot' Amennphis IV. (ca. B.C. 1380) and were again
made available for sanatory purposes in 187 - , 2, have a temperature
of 91” Fahr. and resemble those of Harrogate, Aix in Savoy, and
Hercules-Bad in Hungary in their ingredients. They are erihyaeioug
in cases of rheumatism, skin diseases, and catarrhs. The Viceregal
Bath Establishment, in the Moorish style, opened by the Khedive
in 1899, is excellently equipped, and compares well with the best
E11ropeiu1 baths. It contains immersion-baths for fresh, salt, and
sulphur water, electric baths, hot-air baths, vapour baths, radiant
heat baths, etc. There are two swimming baths (120 and 90 ft.
long), filled with running sulphurated and salt water, one, reserved
for ladies, the other for gentlemen. There are arrangements also
for inhalation, massage, and sun and air baths. The interior of the
Ehedive's private bath-house may be inspected,

The Viceregal Observatory (see p. 77) is being removed from
Cairo to Helwéu, with the addition of many new instruments.

The dry and warm climate is specially adapted for rheumatic,
pulmonary, and kidney diseases, and for all cases in which cold
and damp should be avoided (comp. also p. xxviil. Between Nov.
and Feb. rain falls for a few hours only, and even during the
inundation, when the lower-lying river-valley is covered with mist
in the morning and evening, the atmosphere at I.lelwin is free
from all perceptible moisture. The mean temperature in winter
is 610 b'Fahr., with a daily range of 21° (from 51 to 72"). The
amount of daily sunshine averages 8 hrs., and the fall of tem-
perature after sunset is very slight. In consequence of the rocky
soil and the powerful rays of the sun, the air is extraordinarily
pure, (lustless, and bracing.

Helwén is within easy reach of Cairo. Excursions may be made
to the gorge-like valleys of the desert, and to Sakkira, while the
banks of the Nile afford good wild-fowl shooting, but the desert
game is shy and not easily reached.

The quurries of Ma’gnra and Tuna are reached from Helwin in
It/g hr's. ride ' candles and matches ahould not be forgotten. These quarries,
which are atill worked, yielded some of the stone used in the construction
of the Pyramids and Magtnhas and other ancient buildings down to the
Ptolemaic period. The stone is transported to the bank of the Nile by
means of tramways, carts, camels, and mules. The Arabs of the present
day quarry the stone on the outside of the rocky slopes only, while the
querrymen of the Pharaohs penetrated into the interior of the mountain
and excavated large uhaulherq. when they came to serviceable atone. These
apparently endless Grit rocky halls can ncarcely be trodden without &
feeling of awe. The roofs are supported by pillars of rock. A few in-
scriptions, recording the opening of new halls in the quarries, some de-
mntic inscriptions, and reliefs (Kings AmenemhU, Amosis, Amenophis IW,
Nekht-Har-ehhét) are still preserved. The Egyptians named these the
quarries of Ropes (or 2'-royu), which the Greeks corrupted into Woja, while
Strabo relates that the village beside the quarries was ‘en ancient residence
of captive Trojans who had followed Menelaua to Egypt and remained there'.

From Eelwin an interesting visit may he paid to the Wedian (don-
key in 1/2 him; pmvisious and water should be taken), with its ilae fossils
and remarkahle desert-vegetation, which is tittegt after rain.
