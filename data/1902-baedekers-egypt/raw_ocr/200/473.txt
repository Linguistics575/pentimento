214 Route 19. BUTiG. From Assm;

the tomb of the Nomar'ck Muemi, on the hill above the Soldiers' Tomb;
here were found the soldiers now in me Nue,curn at Gizeh (p.79).

The geological formation of this hill of tombs is very interesting,
especially on :tccuunt of the numerous specimens of Callizmaue nilatica
and other cusem found on its upper part.

About a N. to the s.w. of Assiat, on the slope of the Libyan Mts.,
is the Coptic convent of Der Rifeh, near which are several tombs of the
Middle and Ne v Empires. These belong to princes and grandees of the
neighbouring town ofB/ms-lvotep (Shatb, see below), bat beyond some im-
pr tant inscriptiuns contain nothing of interest. About 2 M. to the N. of
Drbr him; is Dr'r Drmkeh, with quarries and Coptic burial inscriptions.

19. From Asi1t1t. to Girgeh and Beliéneh (Ahydos)
by the Nile.

99 M. The tourist-steaalevs lay up for the night at Sohkg and in amend-
ing the river pass Itelifmeh without stopping.

The voyage from Assi0t to Akhmim leads through an extremely
fertile and well-cultivated district. We11-ti11ed fields, broader ort the
W. than ou the E., adjoin both banks of the river, and are shaded
by tine palms and Nile acanias, especially near the riverside villages.
Here, as in mort of Egypt, large quantities of pigeons are kept by
the peasants, ehiefly for the sake of their droppings, which form the
only manure used in the fields, the dung of the cattle being dried
and used as fuel. Large pigeon-houses, not unlike pylons, are
visible in all the villages, and huge floeks of pigeons are seen
wheeling in the air or settling like a dark cloud on the tields. Most
of these pigeons are of the common grey species, and attain l con-
siderable size, but many pretty little reddish-grey turtle-doves are
also seen. The pigeons really consume more than they pruduce, so
that their encouragement by the felléhiu is rightly regarded as a
serious mistake in their husbandry;

ET- Wasfa lies nearly opposite Assi0t.. la the Gebel RekVsm, to
the F.. ot'the villages of Natf'eh and Ghomyeb, is an alabaster quarry.

51/2 M. Shayhbeh (Chayhaba), on the W. bank. Shapb (Chotb),
Which lies 3 M. inland near the railway, is perhaps the Egyptian
Shas-hotep, the Greek Hypselis, capital of the Hypselite Home. The
chief deity here Was the ram-headed Khnum (ueeroporrs, see above).

15 M. Butig or Abutig(rai1. stat., p. 191), an agricultural town
011 the W. bank with 11,000 inhab. and a small harbour filled with
Nile-boats, lies in the ancient llypselite name. The present name
is probably derived from the Greek name of 'grcohri-xn (Aputheke),
i.e. Storehouse.

Near the E. bank is Eadari (7850 inhab), an the w. hank follow
the steamboat and railway stations (‘21 M.) Sedfu and (271/2 M.)
lem .

. f/a. Budrwi, 21/2 M, from the Nile, are several rude rock-tomhswith-
out inscriptions. Farther to the H.. nem- BCshioeh, are four large quarries
in the hard limestone rock. Near Humamiye/L, in the steep side of the rocky

hill, are three rock tombs, one above another, eoataining inscriptinns and
representations. belonging to the royal ori'usials Am and Kakcs."
