44 M. Mubarak“, a commune on both banks. Ou a t1at-trqpsd
hill on the W. bank, about 11/4 M. to the S. of the temple, stands
the Byzantine Fortress of 3fehendi. This is surrounded by a thick
wall strengthened with towers, except on the side next the river,
where the steepness of the hill was considered protection enough.
From the main entrance, on the S. side, a street leads to a church
of some size and thence to an open space. The houses, built of
brick and stone, have vaulted roofs and are in good presenation.

50 M. Sayteeh, on both banks. - 56 M. Medilc. The mountains,
especially on the E., become higher. The river makes a wide bend
to the W.

The (68 M.) Writli el-'Arab, on both banks, is inhabited by an
Arabic-speaking population.

The village of Ee-Sehu’e. consists of two parts, one on each bank
of the Nile. "Beside that on the W. bank lies the TEMPLE 0F Es-
SEBL‘IA or 8eba'a [the lions), called by the Egyptians Per-Amon
('Bouse of Ammon'). This temple was dedicated to Ammon and
Re-Harmachis by Ramses IL, and is constructed on the same plan
" the temple at (Jed-Tryin (p. 360). Ramses himself was also
worshipped here as a god. The present name of the place is appar-
ently derived from the avenue of Sphinres leading to the temple.
Most of these are now covered with sand. Beside the two first are
two colossal statues of Ramses II. Statues of the king also stood in
front of the PYLON, which is 32 ft. high and 42 ft. broad. The sadly
weatherworr1 reliefs on the front of the pylon-towers represent the
king smiting his foes, in presence of Ré-Harmachis (N. tower) and
Ammon-Ré (S. tower). The reliefs embellishing the jambs of tho
central doorway show the king "crititring to various deities. The
large COURT, which we now enter, is 65 ft. square. To the right and
left are colonnades, each with 5 square pillars, against which stand
colossal figures of the king. The reliefs on the walls, representing
the king in the usual scenes ofintercourse with the gods, are poorly
executed and oihyr no Special interest.

The following GREAT HALL begins the rock-hewu portion of the temple.
The ceiling of this is supported by 12 square pillars. of which six are ad-
joined by eol0ssal flgures of Ramsest The following TILANSVERSE Rooor is
odjoined by two side-chambers and three other chambers in the hack-wall.
On the walls of the first three we see Ramses lI. worshipping and presenting
nlferings to various deities, among whom the deified king himself appears.
The central chamber behind is here, as at Gerf trusén, the SANCTUARY.
On the right wall the king offers ilower, before the sacred boat of Har-
machis, which is decorated with hawke’ heads. On the left wall he offers
incense and lihation before the boat of Ammun, which is adorned with
rama‘ heads. On the rear-wall appears the bout of the sun, in which the
ram-headed sua-god Re-Harmaehie sits beneath a cannpy, worshipped by
the king (on the left) and three apes (on the right]. Beneath is a recess,
in which the outlines of statues of three gods of the temple (Amman,
Ramses IL, and Ré-Hermachis) may still be made out, although a figure
of St. Peter, with a halo and a large key, has been painted over that in

the centre. The king appears on the right and left of the recess1 with
tltywev8. .
