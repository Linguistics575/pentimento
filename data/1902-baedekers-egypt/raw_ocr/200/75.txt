eordingly drove them to the mountains of Ktf by which the earth
is surrounded, whence they occasionally make incursions. Adam
Was then created, on the evening of the sixth day, and the Muslims
on that account observe Friday as their Sabbath. After the creatiOn
of Adam came the fall of the angel who conquered the gin11. As he
refused to bow down before Adam he was exiled, and thenceforward
called Iblis, or the devil. After this, Adam himself fell, and be-
came a solitary wanderer, but was afterwards re-uuitsu1 to Eve at
Mecca, where the sacred stone in the Ka'ba derives its black colour
from Adam's hyars. Adam is regarded as the first orthodox Muslim.

Besides the creative activity of God , his maintaining power is
specially emphasised, us being constantly employed for the pre-
servation of the world. His instruments for this purpose are the
Angels. They are the bearers of God's throne, and execute his
commands. They also act as mediators between God and men,
being the constant attendants of the latter. When a Muslim prays
(Which he does after the supposed fashion of the angels in heaven),
it will be observed that he turns his face at the conclusion firstover
his right and then over his left shoulder. Ife thereby greets the
recording angels who stand on each side of every believer, one on
the right to record his good, and one on the left to record his evil
deeds. The traveller will also observe the two stones placed over
every grave inaMuslim burial-ground. By these sit the two angels
who examine the deceased (p. lxxv), and in order that the creed may
not escape his memory it is incessantly chanted by the conductor
of the funeral.

While there are legions of good angels, who differ in form, bat
are purely ethereal in substance, there are also innumerable sa-
tellites of Satan, who seduce men to error and teach them sorcery.
They endeavour to pry into the secrets of heaven, to prevent which
they are pelted with falling stars by the good angels. (This last is
a notion of very great antiquity.)

(fl). \VRITTEN REVELATION AND THE Prtormiris. The earliest
men were all believers, but they afterwards fell away from the true
faith. A revelation therefore became necessary, and it is attained
partly by meditation, and partly by direct communication. The pro-
phets are very numerous, amounting in all, it is said, to 124,000;
but their ranks are very various. Some of them have been sent to
found new forms of religion, others to maintain those already exist-
ing. The prophets are tree from all gross sins and endowed by God
with power to work miracles, which power forms their credentials;
nevertheless they are generally derided and dishelieved. The greater
prophets are Adam, Noah, Abraham, Jesus, and Mohammed.

The only other matter of interest connected with Molpunmed's
religious system is the position which he himself occupies in it.
Moses and Christ prophesied his advent, but the passages C0Htirn-
ing him in the Thorah and Gospels have been suppressed. He is
