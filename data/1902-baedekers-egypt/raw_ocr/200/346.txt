side are the village of Gizch Cp. 77) and the station of the same
name on the Upper Egyptian railway. The road makes a curve,
crosses the railway (tramway-statiou), and then leads straight towards
the Pyramids, Which are still nearly 5 M. distant. Prettily situated
in a group of trees to the right of the road is the tomb of a shtskh.
0n the left lie the huts of two felléhin villages, Et- Tatbiych and
Et-K6m ct-Aswad Ctramway-sutionj. The fleldi; on each side are
intersected by canals and cuttings, containing more or less water
according to the season. Small white herons, erroneously supposed
to be ibises, and vultures with light and darkplumage are frequently
observed here. The huge angular forms of the Pyramids now loom
through the morning mist, and 800tt stand out in clear outlines,
with all the injuries they have sustained during the lapse of ages.

A few hundred yards before the road begins to ascend, it is pro-
tected against the encroachments of the sand by a wall 5 ft. in
height. 011 the right are the extensive buildings of the Menu House
Hotel (p. '25); to the left is the terminus of the Electric Tramway.
The road winds up the steep N. slope of the plateau on which the
Pyramids stand. On an eminence in the desert to the right rises
the Eremilaye, the villa of the Italian Abhale-Pasha. To the left
is a Vicengat Kiosk (P1. a, p. 117).

Trmisrs for the inspection of the Pyramids and other monuments
are sold in a Small Kiosk beside the viceregal kiosk, where al 0 guides
(Beduins) are assigned to each party. For the ascent of the Great Pyramid
10 pins.; for a visit to the interim of the Pyramid, 10 pias.; visit to
the other objects of interest 5 pias. (but with the aid of our plan, the
tieket and guide for this last item may easily be dispensed with). For
the entire expedition, including the ascent of the Great Pyramid and the
visit to its interior, the charge is 20 pias. Balishish is entirely optional,
though a gratuity of a few pias. is customary. But no attention should
be paid to the begging of the Beduins. and visitors are advised to have
nothing to do with the vendurs of so-called 'tvntiquitica' (almost invariably
spurious; the fossil aea-urchins or clypeastcrs offered here are said to be
found in a mioucne deposit near Ziwiyet Bb'Aryin, 2% M. to the S. of
the Sphinx).

The "Pyramids of Gizeh form one of iive groups of pyramids
within the precincts of the Necropolis of the ancient capital city of
Memphis o. 131) Which stand on the margin of the plateau of the
Libyan desert, along a line about 20 M. in length. Southw ards follow
the groups orZliwiyet el-'Arytin and Abu.str (p. 12N, Sakkam (p. 133),
and Ihrhgluir (p.103). The fifth group, that of Abu iti,tn (p. 128)',
lies to the N. of the Pyramids of Gizeh. The Arab word for a
pyramid is hamm (p1. ahrdm).

The Pyramids of Gizeh rank among the oldest monuments of
human industry, and their cnlnssal proportions extort from us to-
day the same astnnishment that was felt in antiquity by Greek
and Roman travellers. We marvel not only at the technical know-
ledge and ability of the Egyptians, but also at the might of their
kings, who must have had absolute control over the labour of
thousands of their subjects, in order to he able to rear such mouu-
