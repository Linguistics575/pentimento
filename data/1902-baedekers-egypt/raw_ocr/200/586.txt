Proceeding farther into the valley, we reach a tomb with a wide
entrance from which there is a fins view of Dh ssl-Meilhielt and of
the fertile plains to the hh, traversed by the Nile and bounded by
the distant Arabian mountains. In the foreground are seen Medinet
Habu, the Colossi 0f Memnnn, and the Ramesseum, and on the
other side of the river the gigantic ruins of Karnak.

 

The hill of' guinet Marni, 1/2 M. to the S.E. ofDér el-Medineh,
is occupied by a number of fellah huts. Scattered among these are
several tombs of the 18th Dym, most of which are of little interest.
The only one that need be mentioned is the -

Tomb of HuyE, who was governor of Ethiopia under Tut-isnt-lt-
Amen. The key is kept by the Inspector General at Medinet Hahn
(to the SE).
