of Cairo. GREAT PYRAMID. 8. Route. 117

Construction of the Great Pyramid. According to Borehardt‘s theory this
pyramid was not built on a single homogeneous plan (p. 115). It was
urigiually designed to contain only one sloping corridor hewn in the rocky
ground and leading through an mntechamber (5) to the tomb-ehamber co.
But before this design was completely carried out, it was exchanged for
a more comprehensive plan, invnlving the construction of another chamber,
now called the Quseis Chamber (g), reached by the corridor marked c, e,f,

high. The strong and active attendants assist the traveller to mount
by pushing, pulling, and supporting him, and will scarcely allow
him a moraent's rest until the top is reached. As, however, the un-
wonted exertion is fstiguing, the traveller should insist on resting
as often as he feels iuulined. ‘Iskut avuU8 marsh bahshish’ Che quiet,
or you shall have no fee) is a sentence which may often be em-
ployed with advantage. All requests for bakshish should be refused,
and it is as well to keep an eye upon one's packets. - The ascent
