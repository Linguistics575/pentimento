The construction of the railway to Kharthm was undertaken in
1896-97 in order to support the advance of the Anglo-Egyptian
army; and in spite of the enormous difficulty of laying a railway-
line across the sandy and stony surface of the desert, the work was
so energetically carried on that it advanced almost a mile daily. As
in other parts of Egypt (comp. p. 166) the one essential point was
the provision of an adequate supply of water for the workmen and
the machinery. A series of watering-stations (I-VI) was accordingly
established, at which wells, sunk to a depth of80 ft., tap the sub-
terranean water, which is found to tlow from the S. When the
train stops, the numerous soldier-passengers iloek to the houses at
the guardians of the wells. - On the E. rises the bare, violet,
coloured chain of hills, beyond which lies (r-U M.) Bir Ilurat
and behind which runs the caravan-route from Kurosku to Abu
Hammed (comp. p. 365). The stony desert gradually gives place
to undulating sand-hills. Isolated di"uu-iurlrns, fields of barley,
conical siayal-acaciati, and finally a grove of palms announce the
proximity of the Nile.

at the bend of the river, which here turns abruptly to the 5.W., was
"aptured from the dervishes in Aus., 1897, by General Hunter, who
had advanced from Dungola.
