had their original home in Asia. At what period each hived oft'
from the original common stock is veiled in prehistoric darkness.
But it is clear that Asiatic infiuemyeg must have affected the dwellers
on the Nile even before the introduction of the art of tillage, while
the valley of the Nile in Egypt was still populated by pastoral
races - a conclusion based mainly on the origin of the domesticated
ox and of several other domestic animals. 0n the other hand the
original ancestor of the Egyptian domesticated ass was peculiar to
Africa, dwelling among the mountains and steppes to the S. of
Egypt. In this fact we fiad an indication of the route followed by
the Hamitic invaders of Egypt.

The beginning of anything like a regular political development
in Egypt cannot be dated before the introduction of agriculture;
most probably it began with the cultivation of wheat and barley,
grains of Which have been found among the remains in the most
ancient Egyptian tombs, dating from before the earliest dynasty.
The origin of both these cereals is indisputably Asiatic; their tirst
home was in the valley of the Euphrates or in some more central
region of the pontiueut. Besides these grains the funeral oiler-
ings under the earliest dynasties included also linen, wine, and
the produce of other cultivated plants, originally indigenous to
w, Mia.

Some of the earliest ideal conceptions of the proto-Egyptians
must also have been drawn from Asiatic sources, which, however,
in this case are to be looked for farther to the S. in that continent.
Not only the use of incense bat also the sycamore and the persea,
the two sacred trees in the Egyptian Pantheon, were known in
Egypt from the very earliest period. But all these plants are ex-
olusively indigenous to the mountainous regions of S. Arabia and
the adjoining coasts of the Bed Sea; they could have been derived
from no other source. The use of incense is as ancient as the most
ancient known religion. The tree called by the Greeks persea, and
known to modern botanists as mimusops, flourished in the gardens
of ancient Egypt; and the sycamore, which is now nowhere found
in a wild state outside the regions mentioned above, is to be seen
all over Egypt at the present day.

To sum up. The condition of the prehistoric dwellers in the
Egyptian Nile valley may be described as the result of a union be-
tween the autochthonous inhabitants and the Hamitic tribes whhrh,
advancing from the Bed Sea, entered the country from regions to
the S. and SI}. of Upper Egypt. After a long interval of time the
ancient dwellers on the Nile were subjected to new modifustioas,
arising from the predatory attacks ofa race that had attained a higher
level of civilization. This latter race must have started from the
valley of Euphrates, otherwise it would not have been able to ia-
troduce into Egypt, as it did, the knowledge of wheat and barley
and the art of cultivating them with the plough, the knowledge of
