254 Route 24. THEBES (E. BANK). 2. Karnak:

the lastrand smallest, also am erection of Thutmosis m., now in
ruins. On the walls to the right and left of the granite gateway are
representations in the usual style of the cities and tribes subdued
by Thutmosis III. (comp. p. 245); to the right are the tribes of the
8., to the Ieft 'the tribes of the Upper Retenu (i.e. Syria), which
His Majesty took in the wretched town of Megiddo'.

Beyond the sixth pylon we enter the Fore~Court of' the Sane-
tuary, in which are two large Granite Pillars erected by Thate
mosis Ill.' The S. (right) pillar bears the lily of Upper Egypt, the
N. pillar the papyrus of' Lower Egypt. Here also are a Must ofa
Colossal Statue of Ammon and a headless Statue of the Goddess
Am6net, in reddish sandstone, both dedicated by King Tut-enkh-
Amen, whose name was later replaced by that of' Haremheb, his
successor.

To the right of the fore-court is a colnunnde with papyrureolumns,
built by Thutmneie HL, whence a fine view of the ruins is obtained.
Behind the entrance are reliefs of the time of Sethos II.

The Sanctuary, built by Philip Arrhidmus on the site of an
earlier chamber, is not yet completely exhumed. It is built entirely
of pink granite, and is divided into two chambers. The front
chamber, opening to the W., is 19 ft. long, the hinder one, open-
ing to the E., over 25 ft. The roof, which was adorned with
yellow stars upon a blue ground, has been completely destroyed.
The walls both outside and inside were covered with reliefs, the
colouring of which is still in good preservation at some points.

Interior Walls. In the lirtrt chamber Philip appears olNvirvg siuuritiees
to veriuue forms of Ammon. The figures and inscriptions are picked out
with bluish-green pigment. The reliefs in the second chamber are larger
and better executed, but in poorer preservation. Here, to the left, Philip
is seated at a banquet.

Round the outside of the Sanctuary runs a raised CORRIDOR. Un the
tl, side of the ihrst chamber are 4 rows of reliefs, the lowest of which is
destroyed: 1. Rites attending the entrance of the Senutuary by the king;
the goddess Ameuet gives milk to the king. 2, 3. The sacred boat of
Ammon on different festal Occasions. On the S. wall of the second
chamber are four reliefs, representing the king saeriiiciag to various forms
of Ammon, etc. On the N wall of the fiegt chamber the king ottturs, two
small trees to Ammon-Kametf. 0n the N. wall of the second chamber
are reliefs similar to those on the b', wall. The opposite wall, as well as
the back of the Sixth Pylon in the fore-tsmart, is oeeupied'hy inscriptions,
known as the Annals of Thutmosia111., detailing the warlike acquisitions
ot that monarch. The relief above the inscription to the right of the
Mack granite door depicts Thutmosis III. conferring gifts on the temple
(two ohelisks, vases, necklaces, chests). .

Opening " this corridor are a number of rooms, all mnre or lceem
rains, which were built and embellished with reliefs by Queen 3rttkiagCv.
As in all other places, the names and iigtues of the queen have been
stretched out and replaced by those of Thutmosis II. or Thutmoeie III.

Continuing our progress still towards the E. beyond the sane-
tuery, we reach a flat open space, strewn with the scanty relics of
the earliest Temple of the Middle Empire. In front of the chambers
of Thutmosis 111., which may be recognized on the N. side, ran a
path, on which the Pharaohs erected statues to the grendees judged
