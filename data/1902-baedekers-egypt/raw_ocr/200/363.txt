of Glrtua.

A visit to Memphis and 8a1.i1.riira may easily be accomplished in one
day. A calm and windless day should be selected (p. 112). Provisions
should not be forgotten- k an acetylene lump 11 also desirable: , candles may
be rocured at Bcdruhen in the Greek 'hattiir, or shop, mentioned "
p. 1 1. - Tickets admitting to the monuments of Sekkira may be obtained
for 5 pies. each at the railway- station of Bedrashén. Travellers, however.
who possess a. general ADMISSION TICKET from the Service deg 2UGiiG de
l "Egypte (p. 78) do not require these special tickets. Excursions to Sakkiua
and Memphis are orgirleil by Mum. Cook, Messrs. Gaze and other totiriat
agents. But the haste with which these excursions are conducted and
the crowd of tourists taking part in them are out of keeping with the
tlignified and solemn associations of the spot.

The following arrangement of the journey will be found convenient.
Take the train at 8 11.111 to (3/14 hr.) Bedrashe"n, where donkeys and
drivers (10 pias. there and back) are in waiting. Ride vii the site of
Memphis, where the ”Colosu' of Rams“ (p.132) are inspected to the Necro-

Tombs (p.135) and the " Tombs of Ptahhotey and Ti (pp.137, 139) 4hrs. should
be allowed; and possibly time may he found for the inspection of the
0mm: Pyramid O.IM) or the 'Tomb of Mercrulm (p.143). For yturniyr
to the station of Bedraahén Wa hr. more shnuld he reckoned. The train
from Upper Egypt generally reaches Bedrashen about 5.30pnn., but the
railway time-tahle should be consulted. - Those who are not too fatigued
may return by the route described above vii Aburlr to the Mena House
Hotel (21/2 hrs; bargain beforehand with the donkey-tIriver), and thence
take the electric tramway to Cairo

Travellers who wish to devote It/ed days to Sakkera may pass the
night at Mariette .1 House (p.135), for which 'the previous permission of
the museum authorities at Guzeh should be obtained. A blanket is a

The trains start from the Principal Station (p.24). The railway
crosses the Nile, passes EmhMreh (p. 76], and makes a wide curve
to (61/4 M., in 25 min.) Buay ed-Dal.crtir. Farther on, near (8 IL)
632611 tp. 77), the Pyramid of Kheops appears on the right. On the
left, beyond the Nile, we see Ord Cairo, above which rises the long
ridge of the Moliat.tarn, and to the S. the Gebel Tuna (p. IM). On
the banks of the Nile are the military establishments of Turn. To
the right rise the hills of the Libyan desert with the Pyramids of
Abugir (p. 129). Farther 011 is the sugar-tUte of Hawamdiyeh.
We next observe the step-pyramid, which, however, soon disappears.
On the right and left of the line are tracts of arable land. To the
