have been chiselled out here also, and replaced by those of others.
Tire figures and names of the gods defaced by Amenophis IV. were
restored under Haremheb and Sethoe I. The entrance was originally
on the E. side, bat the later restorations, under Ramses III. and in
the Ptolemaie and Roman periods, were so extensive, that little of
the ancient ground-plan is distinguishable. The reliefs on the out-
side date from the reign of Ramses m.

To the E. of the Pavilion of Ramses is a gate leading into the
second court. The temple itself, to the left, comprises a Calla
(P1. K) surrounded by a Colonnade (added by Thutmosis 111.), and
six Chambers behind. The Colonnade is enclosed on the outside by
a parapet upon which rise square pillars, which support the roof
along with the sixteen-sided columns in the inner row. The re-
presentations show Thutmosis III. saeritiiring or performing other
sacred rites in presence of the gods. In the inner chambers Thut-
mesis I. and Thutmosis II. also appear in place of the original
figures of Makere. The inscriptions on the pillars on each side of
the entrance refer to the restorations by Haremheb, Sethos I., and
Pinotem. The cella had a door at each end (restored by Euer-
gates IL). The last room on the right still contains a 'mum' of red
granite. - The structures to the N. and B. of the anterior colonnade
wore added at a later period. That to the N. was erected with
blocks taken from earlier edifices, bearing the names of Ramses IL,
Pinotem, and Hakoris. The small grated windows should be noticed.

We now return to the Second Court, which dates from the Sartic
period. The granite gateway to the E. was built by Peteamenop√©, a
noble living under the 26th Dyn. (comp. p. 284]. On the B. the
court is bounded by the Second Pylon, 50 ft, wide, which was erected
by Shabako (p. lxxxiv), the Ethiopian, and restored under Soter II.
On the back of the Pylon appears Taharka (p. lxxxiv), grasping a
band of enemies by the hair and smiting them. - The adjoining
Court of Nektunebos, 311/2 ft. long and 26 ft. wide, was supported
on each side by four columns with bud-capitals (only two now
complete)7 connected with each by sereen-walls. On the E. side
was a portal, - About 13 ft. to the E. of the last rises the large
First Pylon, which was built in the later Pmlemaic epoch, with
blocks taken from earlier editiees (espk1a11y from the Ramesseum).
Ptolemy x. Soter II. and Ptolemy XIII. appear on the central portal,
worshipping the gods.

On the B. side of the pylon, facing the First Court, which was
128 it. long and 82 ft. broad, was a Cotonmrde, which had columns
with rich floral capitals, connected with each other by high screen-
walls (t1nfiuisheO Only the two central columns are now left. In
front of one of the sereen-walls is placed a red granite stele ofThut-
mosis III., discovered in the course of the excavations. The Galeu'ays
in the wall surrounding the court are now built up; that on the S.
(P1. 9) is adorned with inscriptions by Antoninus Pius.
