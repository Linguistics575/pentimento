hatter to ob1aiu a. guml general impression from the whole, than to examine
the details minutely. Luneheon, which the traveller must bring with
him, ig usually taken near the Kimk (p. 343).

From the landing-place we proceed to the S.W. end of the is..
land to visit the extensive Outer Temple Court, which is bounded
on the N. by the first pylon of the Temple ofIsis, on the S. by the
Vestibule of Nektanebos, and on the E. and W. by colonnades. This
court dates from the late-Ptolemy": period or from the reign of Au-
gustus. Attention should be paid to the strong Quay Wall that per-
haps was carried round the greater part ofthe island, with flights of'
stone steps at various points. The remains of one such flight may be
seen on the S. bank, to the E. of the building of Nektamebos.

The VESTIBULE " NEKTANEBOS was built by Nektanebos as the
vestibule for a temple, dedicated to 'his mother Isis, revered at Aba-
ton, mistress of' Philae, and to the Hathor of 8eumet' (p. 314). The
temple Was swept away by the floods ofthe Nile very shortly after its
completion; but Ptolemy Philadelphus caused the vestibule to be
thoroughly restored. The elegant little structure was supported by
14 columns with varying floral capitals, above each of which Was a
second capital bearing a head of Hathor. Unfortunately only six of
the columns are now standing, and tho roofhes disappeared. Be-
tween the columns were sareen-walls, over 6 ft. in height, crowned
with concave cornices and rows of Lrrarus- serpents, and interrupted
0n the B., W., and N. by exit-doors. These screens-walls bore
reliefs showing King Nektanebos offering gifts to the gods. Before
the river-front of the temple two Ohetislcs upon chest-shaped bases
were erected in the Ptolmnaic period. These were made of' sand-
stone instead of the usual granite. Thew. obelisk, bearing a Creek
and several Arabic. iuseriptions, is still standing, though it has lost
its apex; the E. obelisk is represented by its base only.

The WEST Commune, which follows the line of the shore of the
island, is 100 yds. in length and has a row of 31(former1y 32) plant
columns, each If) ft. high, no two capitals of whirh are alike. Most
of the columns have two series of reliefs, showing Tiberius offering
gifts to the gods. The ceiling, which is partly destroyed, is decorated
with stars and flying vultures. The rear-wall, the IN indows in which
command a beautiful view of the stream and of the island of Bigeh
(p, 344], is embellished with two horizontal rows of alto-reliefs,
representing the Pharaoh (usually Augustus or Tiherius)offe1'ing
various gifts to the gods. The relief over the window opposite the
first two columns (P1. a) is specially noteworthy for its excellently
preserved colouring and the delicacy of its execution; it represents
Nero offering two eyes to Horus, Isis 'the good sister', and the 'lord
of both lands'. - A subterranean stairway leads outside this eulon-
mule to a small Nilometer.

The EAST COLONNADE is urtilnislusd; only six ofits 16 column:
are completed, the remainder were left merely rough-hewn. The
