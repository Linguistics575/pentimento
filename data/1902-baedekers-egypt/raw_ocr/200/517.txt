now destroyed. One chapel (L) was dedicated to the goddess Mat,
the other (M) to the moon-god Khons. - A door in the centre of
the rear-wali admits to a smaller hall, which originally had eight
columns, and was converted into a Church (P1. E) in the Christian
period. The ancient entrance to the swnetuary-ehambers has here
been altered into a kind of apsidal recess, bounded on the right and
left by two granite Corinthian columns. At a few points the Christian
whitewash has peeled off, permitting the 'heathen' reliefs of Amen-
ophis III. to become visible again. Adjoining the church are sev-
eral small rooms (Pl. H, I, K).

We now retum to the hypostyle hall and quit the temple by a
door on the E. side (beside Pl. K), but re-tenter it almost immediately
to inspect the Birth Room (Pl. R), the roof of which rests upon
three clustered columns. The room owes its name to the Beliefs on
the W. wall, referring to the birth of Amenophis III. The reliefs
on the S. wall refer to his accession to the throne.

From the Birth Room we enter Room 0, the roof of which is
supported by three columns, and thence, glancing at the much
damaged reliefs, we pass through an arched doorway into the so-
called -

Sanctuary of Alexander the Great (Pl. G). This chamber was
practically rebuilt by Alexander, who replaced the original four
supporting columns in the centre by a chapel, in which the sacred
boat of Ammon was preserved. The reliefs covering both the in-
terior and exterior walls of the chapel represent Alexander before
Amman and his fellow-gods. On the walls of the chamber the reliefs
ot'Amenophis 111. have been left (the king before the various Theban
deities). - A gap in the wall on the N. side of the Sanctuary ad-
mits us to a small square Hall (P1. F), with four clustered papyrus-
columns. The wall-reliefs, which are in three rows, show Amen-
ophis m. before Ammon and other Theban deities. The door hence
to the Sanctuary has been built up.
