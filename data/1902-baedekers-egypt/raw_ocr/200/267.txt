54 Route 4. CAIRO. 3. Wuth-Eaetern

It lies in the quarter Kat'at el-Kebsh, on a hill named 69ch 1rethkitr.
The editiee is said to have been designed by a Christian prisoner
in imitation of the Kama at Mecca, but without columns, and the
whole of the building was constructed of entirely new materials.
The walls consist of brick, coated with stucco. The older part of
the ornamentation,which is in carved stucco (not moulded) and wood,
exhibits none of the intricate forms of the Byzantine-Arabian style,
which appear in the later restorations.
