116 Rants s. PYRAMIDS or' M'zrm. Environs

under the Romans and under the Arabs, renewed attempts were
made to penetrate to the treasures supposed to lie in the interior.

The fn-st modern traveller who carefully and successfully examined
the Pyramids was Nicholas shew in 1721', but he still entertained the
notinn that the Sphinx had a subterranean connention with the Great
Pyramid. He was followed by Norden in 1737; Porocke in 17M, who
givm " plan and dimensions; Fourmunt in 1755-, C'arsteu Niebnhr in
[70].; Davison in 176r, Bruce in 1768, Yolney in 1783-, Browne in 1792-95;
Denon. Coutclle, Jonmrd, and other sevunts " the French expedition
under Bonaparte in 170i)d80i. Jomard in particular has the merit of
having: taken very accurate measurements. Hamilton, in 1801, was a
dispossicauvte and critical observer. In 1817. Ciwiglia, a. bold, but illiterate
and fanciful seeman‘ was fortunate in eliciting new facts regarding the
interior of the Great Pyramid, and excavated the Sphinx. In 1817, Belzeni
thoroughly explored the Interior of the Second Pyramid. Belmni, an
intelligent explorer and accurate draughtsman, wee originally a monk at
Rome. but when the French occupied that city he retired tn Lnndum
where he devoted himself to study in spite of many hardships. In 1815 he
arrived in Egypt, where, besides exploring the pyramid, he discovered the
tomb ofSethus 1. atThebes, etc. The next eminent explorer was Sir Gardner
Wilkinson in 1831. In 1837 and 1838 Col. Howard Vyse and Mr. Perriug
made very thorough investigations and took careful measurements which
will always be considered authoritative. In 1842-45 Prof. Lepsins, the
distinguished German Egyptologist, made several very important aimv.
eries, and furnished us with much valuable information. He found no
fewer than thirty pyramids which had been quite unknown tn previous
travellers. J. Maspero opened the small pyramids nf 8attitra in 1880
and discovered important inscriptions. W. M, Flinders Petvie subjected
the Pyramids of Gizeh to a new and thorough inventixznticn in 1881782.
The Pyramids ofDahst11he were examined in 1594-95 by De ngan; those
of Lisht in 1895 by Gautier and Jéquier.

The pyramids of Gizeh stand upon aplateau, which extends
about 1600 yds. from E. to W. and about 1300 yds. from N, to b'.,
the E. and N. margins being very precipitous at places. The prr-
amids are built exactly facing the four cardinal points. The diagonal
of the largest pyramid from RR. to SW. is exactly in a line with
the diagonal of the second pyramid.

The M'Greaj; Pyramid is called by the Egyptians ‘Yekhwet
A"liyfu' or the ‘Gtariom Place of Khufu'. No trace is now left of
its original outermost covering, whieh probably consisted of slabs
ot limestone and granite. The length of each side, (P1. AA) is now
750 ft., but was formerly (PL B B) about 768 ft.; the present per-
pendicular height (Pl. E 0) is 451 ft., while originally (Pl. E E),
including the nucleus ofroek (Pl. Fr) at the bottom, and the apex
(Pl. CE), which has now disappeared, it is said to have been 48211.
The height of each sloping side (A 0) is now 568 ft., and was for-
merly (P1. B E) 610 ft. The angle at which the sides rise is 51050'.
The cubic content of the masonry, deducting the foundation of rock
in the interior, as well as the hollow chambers, was formerly no less
than 3,277,000 cubic yards, and it still amounts to 3,057,000 cubic
yards. 1n round numbers, the stupendous structure covers an area
of nearly thirteen acres. The material of which it is constructed is
Stone from the Mokattum and from Turra, containing numerous
fossils, chiefly nummulites (p. 1081.
