These schools are maintained by the private enterprise of the schooi-
masters themselves, who exact 1-2 piestres per week from each pupil. The
mere reading and recitation of verses from the Koran being in itself can-
sidered e meritorious act, the great object of these schools is to teach the
pupils to recite the {Karin by heart. After learning the alphabet, the pro.
nuncietiou and the values of numbers, the pupil is taught the r1imstruir1e
'beautiful' names of Ailih, a knowledge of which is necessary to enable
him to repeat the ninety-nine prayers of the Mohammedan rosary (sebha).
The boy is then made to write out the Fritl)a, or first chapter (siifeh)
of the Karin, which he reads often enough to impress it perfectly on
his memory, swaying his body to and fro the while, whereby, as he
imagines, his memory is rendered more pliant. After learning the ihat
chapter, he next proceeds to learn the last, the last but one, and the
others in the same inverted order, until he reaches the second, the TNW-
son being that the chapters gradually diminish in length from the
second to the last. Although the language is often ilift'um1t and obscure,
no explanations are given, so that the boy who knows the whole book
by heart usually understands but little of it. As soon as the boy has
learned the whole of the Koran in this way, the completion of his studies
is commemorated by the ceiehration of the Khatmeh, a family festival, to
which the sehoolmaster is invited.

The Bazaar" of Cairo, though inferior to those of Damascus
and Constantinople, present to the European traveller many novel
features and many interesting traits of Oriental character. As is
the universal custom in the East, shops of the same kind, with
their workshops, are congregated together in the same quarter,
named sometimes after a mosque, but more usually after the wares
there sold, e.g. Silk en-NuNitutm bazaar of the coppersmiths, Sill:
el-8lsordagiveli, bazaar of the ironmongers. Most of the bazaars Mn-
sist of narrow, and often dirty, lanes, generally covered over with
an awning to shade them from the sun, and Mnked with shops about
6 ft. wide. These shops (dtikkan) are open towards the street, and
in front of each is a mappaba or seat on which the customer takes his
place and on Which the shopkeeper otters his prayers at the appointed
hours. The inscriptions above and in the shop do not consist of the
dealer's name, but of various pious ejaculations, such as 'Oh Allah,
locker of the gate of gain, oh, all-nourisher’, 'the help of Allah and
a speedy victory', etc. These lanes usually enclose a massive store-
house of considerable size (kha‘n), eonsisting of two stories. Several
of these khins form a quarter of the city (Mra). These were for-
merly elosed at night by massive, Iron-mounted gates, still in some
cases preserved, though no longer used.

The principal market-days are Monday and Thursday, when
the tratliiy in the narrow streets is so great that it becomes difficult
or impossible to traverse them. Pedlers are seen forcing their way
through the crowd, shouting at the top of their voiees, sometimes
carrying a small table with them, and frequently selling their wares
by auction. So, too, we observe "ofiee-siy1lers, water-bearers, nar-

for which is sttt. The magazines of the wholesale merchants, with their
large courts, are called wakkdleh, which the Franks have corrupted to
Occalek, Octal, or 0mm.
