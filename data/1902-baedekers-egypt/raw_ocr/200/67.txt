emancipation of farming from Its dependence upon the inundatious

III. AGRICULTURAL SEASONS. (I) The Winter Crop, or 'rdsli-
Shimwi" grown sxelusively on the 'Itar' laud (p. IV), is sewn im-
mediately after the subsidence of the inundation. In Upper Egypt
seerl-time accordingly begins as early as the middle of October, in
Central Egypt (from Assirit. to Cairo) at the beginning of November,
and in the Delta about the end of December. The ground is seldom
prepared for sowing by the use of the plough. The seed is Scattered
over the still soft and moist soil, and is then either pressed into it
by means of a wooden roller, beaten into it with pieces of wood, or
trodden in by oxen f. Throughout tlic whole country a period of four
months elapses between seed-time and the completion of the har-
vest. The winter-harvest is, theremre, over in Upper Egypt about the
middle of February, in Central Egypt about the middle of March,
and in the Delta towards the end of April. The principal crop
everywhere is wheat, next to which are barley, clover, and broad
beans (p. lvii).

(2) The Summer Crops f'Er-fle"f' or 'Et-lfilyi') occupy the period
from April to August; but many of the plants grown at this season
require a longer period of development, extending throughout the
whole of the autumn and even part of the winter. This is particul-
arly the case with the tice-crop, which is sown in May, but does
not attain maturity till the middle of November, and with the cot-
ton-plant, sown in April, and harvested in November or December.
A large quantity of cotton is also yielded by a second harvest from
the pruned plant in the month of August, in the second year of its
growth. The cultivation of tobacco has recently been forbidden in
Egypt, in the interest of the customs duties.

t3) The Autumn Season ('En-Nabthi' or 'Ed-Deniiri0, as al-
ready stated, is the shortest season, extending to little more than
seventy days ; and yet within this brief space the rich soil of

 

i- The AGnmm/rmmn IMPLEMENTS of the Egyptians are exeeedingly
primitive and defective. The chief " these is the plough (milu-zii), the
farm of which is precii ly the same as it was 5000 years ago; and the
traveller will recognise it on many of the monuments and in the system
0f hiernglyphics. It mnsists of a pole about 6tt. long, drawn by an ox,
buffalo, or other beast of burden, attached to it by means of a yoke,
while to the other end is fastened a piece of wood beat inwards at an
acute angle, and shod with a three-pror1ged piece of iron (Hum). Cun-
neeted with the pole is the handle which is held by the fe11iity These
rude and light ploughs penetrate but slightly into the ground. The
barrow is replaeetl in Egypt by a 1-0110:- provided with iron spikes Umm-
fud, literally 'hedgehog'). The only tool used by the natives on ihetr
ticlds, or in making embankments of earth, is a kind of hoe or shovel
(mim'ufeh). The process of reaping consists of cuttin: the grain with a
sickle (mingul), in simply upmnting it by hand. The Merry, 0r 'tlureshing-
sledge‚Äù, consists uf a kind of sledge resting nu a roller provided with
sharp semi-circular pieces uf iron, and drawn by oxen or buffaloes. This
primitive machine, being driven over the wheat, peas, Dr lentils to be
thrashed, crushes the stalks and ears and sets tree the grain OT seeds.
