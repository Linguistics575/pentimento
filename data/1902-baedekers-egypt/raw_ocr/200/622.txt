The GREAT HYEOSTYLE HALL (Promos) contains 10 columns with
rich floral and palt'n-cepitatls7 on which the roof rested. On the shafts
appears Neos Dionysus sirorii1oir1g to the gods. The ceiling of the
two main aisles is embellished with ilyirog vultures; while the under
side of the aruhitrave supporting this ceiling bears astronomical
designs (star-gods in their boats, etc.) We may observe the lines
dividing the surface into squares to guide the artist in drawing the
figures, and also some older sketches that were not carried to com-
pletion. The mural reliefs here are especially beautiful, the finest
being that to the right of the N. porta1(on s<;Ieen-wa11h). We here
see the king (Neos Dionysus], in presence ofHa1'oijris (t0 the right),
being blessed by a lion-headed Isis and the hawk-headed Harsiésis,
on the right, and by the goddess Newt and the ibis-headed Thout,
on the left.

The remaining mural reiiefs may be inspected by thuse who are not preser
ed for time. On Screen Wall i: the guardian-goddesses of U per and Lower

The SMALL HYPOSTYLE HALL is entered by two doors. Its ceil-
ing, which was lower than that of the great hsll, was supported by
10 columns with floral capitals. On each shaft Euergetes II. is
shown sa0rieoing to a god; the mural reliefs also show him in com-
munion with the gods, The relief on the left (N.) wall should be
noticed: the hawk-headed Haroéris presents the curved sword to
Energetes IL, behind whom are his sister Cleopatra and his wife of
the same name. The sacred crocodile of Omhos is represented at
P1. n, between the doors leading from the great hall.

Between the dlmrs leading hence to the inner rooms of the temple are,
reliefs showing Phirometor, elder brother of Eaergetes IL, saecifieiag to
the hawk-headed Haroéris.

The following 'three smaller Yssrrsvras, each of which lies a
little higher than the preceding, are also embellished with tine
reliefs. Adjoining are a number of side-chambers, whieh may have
been used as staterooms; those to the 1eft[N.) have almost (50rrt-
pletely disappeared. On the rear-wall of Vestibule 111, between
the doors, is a tiae relief: Philometor, Vlad in a white mantle and
arcompanied by Cleopatra: stands before the Irdwlc-hearied moon
