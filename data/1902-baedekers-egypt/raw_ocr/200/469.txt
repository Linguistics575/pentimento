210 Route 18. EL-IgUSiYEH‘ From Cairo

On the tear-well of the Third Room (Pl. a) the mummy of the prineees is
shown standing under a canopy? while in front of it the coral family and
court are mourning. This srene is continued on the right wall. On the
left wall We see the mummy lying below the same canopy; at the foot
of the bier is the nurse of the deceased, in front is the mourning royal
family, while farther to the right is a wnman with a. young prinuess on
her breast. On the entrence-wall are mirrors, spoons, boxes, and other
objects with which the tomb was furnished (much injured). - We return
to the steps at d. Nearer the entrance a Corridor (Pl. 1) leads to the
left to a sloping Passage (Pl. m) ending in an anilnished Chamber (Pl. rs).

In the hills enclosing the plain of Tell el-'Amarmvthere are numerous
quarries of limestone and alabaster. The most important are the AM
buster Quarries of Hemmb, iliswvered by Newberry, to which a path run-
ning eastwards to the 8. of the S. group of tombs leads. These quarries
are ascertained from numerous inscriptions to have been worked under
the Early Empire and at the beginning of the Middle Empire.

We next reach [193 M.) EHrawti.ta, on the E. bank, with an
entirely destroyed palace of thetime of Amenophis IV. In the neigh-
bourhood are several inscriptions, defining the boundaries of his
holy district (p. 203).

Near the W. bank lies the village of Dértit (rail. stat., p. 191).
The boat now passes between the islands; of Geoiret el-Ijawatn, on
the E., and (3eziret el-hfandtra, on the W.

The Arabian Mts., rising in precipitous rocky walls, approach
the river. Swallows, ducks, and other birds inhabit the caves in
the porous rock on the banks, and fly in and out in screaming
crowds. The cliffs on the right bank of this part of the Nile are
known as Gebel Abu Féda. The stream below them is considered
the most dangerous part of the channel between Cairo and Assuin.
Violent winds blow round the crags, and numerous sand-banks
impede navigation.

Near ed-Dér and el-lru.etr (on the E. bank) are several rrrelr-
tombs, without inscriptions: dating trhiedy from the Early Empire,
and also some ancient quarries.

0n the W. bank, 3 M. from the river, lies El-Kugiyeh, now an
insignificant town with 7200inhab., the ancient Came, in which,
according to 2Elian, Venus Urania and her Cow (Le. Rather, the mis-
tress of heaven) were worshipped It was known to the ancient
Egyptians as 06314 and was capital of the Lower Sycamore Nome.

The necropolis of 66m) lay to the E., near the modern Mir, where
numerous graves of the Middle Empire have recently been discuvererl,
the interesting contents of which are now in the museum at Gizeh. Grievin-
Roman tombs were alsn found here, containing mummies with painted
plaster heads instead of fave-masks. _

At cl-Har'ib, on the E. bank, are the ruins of an ancient Egypt-
ian town, at the mouth of a Wadi ascending to the Arabian moun-
tains. The walls, provided in places with window-openings, are
high, but fragments of dcmotic inscriptions show them to be of late
date. Small caves in the rocks contain bones from mummies of
men and oats.
