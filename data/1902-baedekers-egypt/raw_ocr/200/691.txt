known as Mushir Bey, and fur, an excursion to the battlefield of Kerreri

Khartitm (1240 ft.), the capital of the Sadin and the residence
of the governor-general, is situated in 15° MY N. 1at., on the left
bank of the Blue Nile, immediately above its 1yoi1iluenoe with the
White Nile (camp p. xlix). The name ('elephant's trunk’) refers to
the shape of the long peninsula that ends on the N.W. in the Ris
Kharttim o. 388). The town was built in 1823-30 by Mohammed
'Ali, and quickly rose to prosperity es the southernmost depét of
the trade of Egypt, so that it is said to have had 70,000 inhab. in
1882. During the rebellion of the Mahdi (Mohammed Ahmed)
General Gordon, Who was despatched hither by the British gov-
ernment to withdraw the garrisons in the Sudin, entered the town in
l"eb., 1884, and defended it until Jan. 26th, 1885. The town was
reduced to ruins by the M.ahdists; but the work of rebuilding it was
begun in 1898. Most of the houses are of brick, though free use
is also made of Kerreri sandstone, and are surrounded by fine
gardens.

Along the bank of the Nile runs the River Avenue, a promenade
over 2 M. in length, planted with palms and other trees. At its E.
extremity lies the hamlet ofBum; and as we proceed thence towards
the W. we pass successively the British Barracks (Pl. h), a fragment
of the old town-wall (er-Istalurm), the Gordon Memorial College
(P1. g; see below), and the Hospital (Pl. f). The Gordon Memorial
College, for which Lord Kitchener obtained the necessary funds by
public subscription throughout the British Empire, is a large and
handsome building in which native youths are trained by English
and Egyptian teachers for an official career. The gardens and villas
of the British offi0ials add a picturesque feature to the scene, many
ofthe houses being built in the verandah cottage style. That farthest
to the B. belongs to Slatin-Pasha. Farther to the W. are military
stores and the workshops of the Water Transport Department; and
finally a school of forestry. The Palace of the 8irddr (P1. b) is built
in the Gothic style; before it stand a British and. ll Sudanese sentinel.
Gordon’s house, at the portal of which he fell under the lances of
the dervishes, occupied the same site. At the hack of it is the
Telegraph Office. In a large square, to the W., rises the 8irdtr?yeh
or Gwemment Building (Pl. a). A little behind are the two Banks
(P1. d) and the Shops let by government, with the Post (Woe (Pl. e).
In front are a number of villas (including those of the Mudir, the
Adjutant General, and the Financial Director] and a tine garden,
