upon them at a later date,- to the right of the door is Khtrem-wtwst, in
presence of Ramses IL, his father, in commemoration of the king's tifth

At this little temple we turn, direct our steps towards the Nile,
and in 1/4 hr. reach the ROCK TEMPLE, on the right side of the val-
ley, recognizable from a distance by the Stair leading up to it. The
latter consists of 41 steps hewn in the rock, with a massive bal-

Energetes lI. (Physkon), and provided with reliefs and inscriptions
by him and by Ptolemy X. Soter II.
