AA CONSULATE9.

(6). Public Safety. Consulates. Courts of Justice.

Public Safety. The authority of the Khedive is so well estab-
lished throughout the whole of Egypt that travellers are as safe as
in Europe. Weapons for self-i1efeuoe are an unnecessary en011m-
brance. i J?owling-pieees may be purchased in Cairo or they may
he had for hire at the principal hotels. Sportsmen who bring their
own guns will find it very troublesome to clear them at the iyustom-
house, and cartridges also are contraband (p, xv). Ammunition (in-
cluding Lefaueheux cartridges) may be bought in Cairo, but not
higher up, where only coarse, gun-powder can be obtained.

Consulates. Consuls in the East enjoy the same privilege of
exterritoriality as ambassa dots in other countries. On public 0C088-
ions they are attended by Kavasses, or armed consular ofiieers. A
distinction is sometimes made between professional C'eonsules
missi') and commercial consuls; and there are consuls general [who
act also as political agents), consuls7 viee-eonsuls, and consular
agents, possessing various degrees of authority. Ju all cases of em-
ergency the traveller should apply for advice to the nearest consul
of his country.

Courts of Justice. In place of the exclusive consular juris-
diction to which foreigners were formerly liable, a system of Mixed
Tribunals was established in 1876. The judges consist of natives
and foreigners (the latter generally appointed by the Khedive from
qualified oflioiMs nominated by the Great Powers), who give their
verdicts in accordance with Egyptian law7 founded on that ofl’rance
and Italy. Cases in which the Khedive himself and the Egyptian
government are concerned are also tried before this tribunal, which
includes courts of iirst and second instance. The courts of the first
instance are at Cairo, Alexandria, and Msns.tira, and there is a delo-
gation at Port Sa’id. The appeal-court is at Alexandria. Lists of
qualified barristers are exhibited in the anterooms of the courts. -
Cases between natives, and 'slleaiminaloases, are tried by the Native
Courts, established in 1884. Courts of the first instance are situated
at Cairo Alexandria, Benisnéf Assitlt, 11ml [(eneh and also (with a
more filii%'i jurisdiction) at Tanta and oicr.sii', (Z l zik) The
appeal- -court is at Cairo; about half the number of itsjudges are
Europeans. The procedure is based upon the Code Nspoléon.

(7). Intercourse with Orientals. Dragomans.

The average Oriental regards the European traveller as a Croesus
and sometimes too as a madman, - so unintelligible to him are
the objects and pleasures of trav elling Be therefore looks upon him
as fair gau1e,v1dfeelsjastitied in pressing upon him with aperpetual
demand for bakshish which simplymeans' a gift'. Travellers are often
