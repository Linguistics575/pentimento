small bottles into which it is usually put contain only one drop. Then
follow the weavers and tailors.

The ~héri'a en-Narbiyeh is continued to the S. by the Bhdrira el-Fub-
Mm?» (Pl. E, 3, 4), in which is the bazaar for wares irum Tunis and
Algiers. We iirst uhserve drug-etalls, and then magazines of 1iglrsooluured
Woollen and other statrs, Arabian rugs, etc.

We now turn sharp to the right, then sharp to the left, and pursuing
the same direcliun, parallel with the El-rals1ytiru1 street (see below), and
passing a number uf shoemakess' stalls (bawdbishi), we come to a broader
covered passage which we fulluw to the right for a few woes, and then
take the first lime to the left. This lane is cuutinued under the name of
Shari'u er-lf-gritty, and is inhabited chietly by tailors, "ioth-mereltatlts,
and dealers in undressed wool. A short abrupt curve of this lane, to the
left, then brings us to the Sildl'i'a et-u.k.kddtn.

The Asnnirimn forms the first part of a long line of streets
leading to the S. and farther on taking successively the names of
fhu'missrr, Srsiauu EL-'AKKAuiN, and vauxime. In the mu"1rtyelt
we observe the medréseh and mausoleum of Sultan e1-irhtiri (P1. B,
3, o. The madréseh, to the W., was finished in 1503 and has a
minaret, inappropriately crowned with five modem dwarf cupolas.
The mausoleum, to the B., dating from 1504, has a modem and
tasteless wooden cupola and a restored ceiling (in the oratory). The
sultan, who fell in Syria (p. xeviij, is not buried here. Adjacent is
a well-preserved sebil, with kuttaib (p. 37), projecting into the Street.

To the E. of the Shiri'a Bi-rAytitdi'a lies the quarter O' Hum /radary:
In its main street stands the ruinous 'aloaas of Gamal ed-Din ez-Zehhbi
(Pl. E, t), president " the merchants, an interesting building of 1637
(adm, lst ticket as in the musques, 2 pin.) Through a dilayiduted passage
(dir'lceh) we reach the court of the delamlik, With two we1i-pvoervei1
fagades. To the right is the door of the harem; to the left is a flight of
steps leading to the Tekhla B6sh (p. clxv). The inscription on the moulding
gives lhe da'e of the building. The small door in the middle of the wall
(bcib ereir) is the private door of the master of the house, leading to the
harem. Just to the left is a small chamber with Mushrabiyehs (p. elxvi),
whence the ladies of the harem cuuld overlook the court and the Takhuv
hash. In front is the Kim, recently restored. The rest of the house is
in ruins.

The Sukkariyeh (P1. E, 4) forms the bazaar for sugar, dried
fruits (mutt), fish, candles, and similar wares. 0n the left is the
modern marble Sch?! of Mohammad Mu, and on the right the -

Namiu el-Muaiyad (P1. D, B, 4), also known as t7dmi'a
et-Al/mar ('the red'), a mosque dating from 1416. It was erected
by Sultan Shékh el-hralynttdi Muaiyad (p. xcvii), of the dynasty of
the Circassian Mamelukee, who had been defeated in a rebellion
against Sultan Fang (p. 35), and vowed that he would build a
mosque on this site if he were released from prison.

The lately restored sanctuary, the two mausolisums, and the minarets
on the gates of the Bab ez-aneleh (see p. 48), the upper parts of which
were added in 1892, are the only remains oi the original structure. The
three massive walls, intended to encluse three new liwims, were erected
during a restoration in the second half of the 19th century.

The bronze gate at the entrance, the handsomest in Cairo,
originally belonged to the mosque of Sultan Hasan (p. 49), but
was bought for the new mosque for 500 diners. We first enter a
