lie a temple and other buildings, and some large columns and Greek
inscriptions have been found in the quarries. About two days' jour-
ney farther to the N. is Sebet Dukhkhén (‘smoke mountain'), the an-
eient porphyry quarries of which were Worked by the Romans. Here
are the ruins of an Ionic temple of the time of Trajan (never Ilom-
pleted), some remains of an irregularly built town, and two large
water-reservoirs. We follow the ancient route hence to Abu Shav-
cl-Kibli. The harbour of Myos Hermes has been silted up and is
now useless.

The JOURNEY TO Koefm (there and back 10-11 days at least]
is more interesting. It may also be made from Ifuft (p. 231) "
Luxor (comp. p. 3467. The mute from Keueh leads first through
the villages of Shékh Rekdb, Démch, and JCihn 'Irnr8n, the first an
the left, the other two on the right side of the road. The first night
is generally spent at the orararanserai of Bit 'Ambar, about 3h hrs.
from Iieneh, where the lofty palms and shady sycamores and mimosa:
offer a most inviting halting-place. The large caravanserai was
erected at the expense of an Ibrahim Pasha and comprises several
separate. buildings, covered with don1e-s1rsrped roofs and surrounded
by courts and colonnades.

On the second day we advance steadily, ascending almostimper-
ceptihly, through a monotonous plain, intersected in all directions
by small undulating heights. All around us extends the inter-
minable yeu0wish-gray, sun-bl6aohed rocks of the desert; not a
trace of organic life is visible, not a single green tree or shrub At

"n-route, about midway between Bir 'Ambar and Lalpitp, the road
from Keneh is joined by those from Kuft and Luzon The only
variety is afforded by an occasional Mubwala or Maluv.tyu The Mab-
walas are simply spa ces covered with camel’s clung. They occur on
every great caravan route at regular intervals and are of the utmost
importance as sign-posts showing the road. The Mahattas or halt-
ing-places arc 71/9-9 M. apart and serve also as measures of distance.
The Ifoyh caravans usually pass the second night in the village of
Lahéta (et-6r"heta; f) hrs. from Wm. and Bir 'Ambar, 121/2 hrs. from
Keneh)7 which is chiefly inhabited by ‘Ababdeh (p. 329). The small
oasis has two wells, five palms, a few mud-huts, and a half-ruined
Arab caravarrserai. Mutton, goat's ilesh, poultry, pigeons, eggs, etc.,
may be obtained here. Near the chief well are some fragments of zt
Greek inscription of the reign of Tiberius Claudius.

The first Roman station, the Hydreuma, now called by the Arabs
Kay el-Bemh (‘castle of the maidens'), is 3 hrs, to the S. of Lakéte.
It forms an oblong 125 ft. in length and 101 ft. in breadth. The
