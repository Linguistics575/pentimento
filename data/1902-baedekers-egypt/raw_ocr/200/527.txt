'jubiieis', as a sign that the king would yet celebrate mmnyjubileee. On
the W. wall of the court are representations of gasrrihee8 and of a pro-
eeesion with standard-bearers. v The architraves hem- ttorid disdieatory
inscriptions, recording that Ramses III. created this munument in honour
of bis father Ammon. - A door in the left colounede opens into the
Portion of the Bubasti-les (see below); and one in the right cnlmnede
(now built up) admitted to the S. colonnade of the great hall.

A door leads from the terrace at the back of this court into a
Hypoxtyle Halt, with eight columns with papyrus-bud capitals. Ad-
joining are three Chapels, dedicated respectively to Amman (in the
middle), Mut (left), and Khons (right), and each containing re-
presentations of the king suurrifKing to the beat of the respective
god. Beside the chapel of Khons is another chamber, now much
dilapidated; on each side of the chapel of Ammon is a chamber;
and beside the chapel of Mut is a staircase.

From the court ot the Temple of Ramses We proceed by the E.
door to the so-ruuled Portico of the Bubastides, situated at the SE.
corner of the great court. This portico was embellished with reliefs
and inscriptions by the kings of the 22nd Dynasty.

The following reliefs may be particularized. To the left as we enter
(on the projecting wall), above: Amman hands King Osurkon I. the
curved sword and the palm-branch (symbol of long life); below, Khhum
holds the hieroglyph for 'life' before the king; Hathor gives milk to the
king. Left (W.) Wall. Takelothis II. and his son Osurkou, the high-
priest of Ammon, holding an image of the goddess of truth, in presence
of Ammon. Below is a lung inscription. To the right of the exit-doar
is another long inscription (of the 12th year of Takelothie IL), above
which two reliefs represent King Takelothis presenting a. loaf of bread
tn Amman. Other reliefs represent Sheshonk I. before Amman.

We now pass through the rear door of this portieo in order to
inspect the highly important Triumphal Monument of Sheshonk l,
(the Shishak of the Bible). This is on the outside of the S. tower
of the second pylon, and is easily found. It commemorates the
victory won by Shishak over Rehoboam, son of Solomon, King of'
Judah. The large form of Ammon, wearing the double crown.
appears to the left, grasping in his right hand the sword of' victory
and in his left cords binding five, rows of captured towns in
Palestine, each of which is represented by a circular wall enclosing
its name, beneath the upper part of a fettered prisoner. The curved
noses, prominent rs1usolc-bomss, and pointed beards of the captives
clearly identify them as Semitic. Beneath Amman appears the god-

dess of the Theban home with the name ofthe nome upon her

head. She holds a club, bow, and quiver, and leads five rows of
captives with cords. To the right Shishek is seen grasping a group
of cowering Semites by the hair and smiting them with his club.
The portrait of Shishak was left 11niinished throughout.

The Biblical passages referring to the campaign are as follows: 1 Kings
mm. 25-26: 'And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehohuam, that
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: And he took away the
treasures of the house of fha Lnrd mm tha transln-Ae nr Hm king's house;
