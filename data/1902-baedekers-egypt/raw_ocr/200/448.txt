recently by Prof.Flindevs Petrie, who discovered on its E. side the small
Temple of Snofru. This, built of hlnrks of limestone, consists of two,
hare chambers leading to an open court immediately adjoining the pyr-
amid. The numerous inscriptions on the walls were placed there by
later pilgrims to the shrine.

The Magtaba: of Meidhm lie to the N. and E. of the pyramid. These
were the tumbs of the eunrtiers and ortieial, of Snofru, and are among
the oldest monuments of the kind in the world. The two most important
(to the N.) are those of the judge and vizier Nefey-maat and his wife Fetal,
and of Prince Rallutep and his wife Nafret. Their inner chambers, Which
were inaccessible in antiquity and have been again built up after explor-
ation, were emhellished with admirably executed representations and in-
scriptinns. The tomb of Itahotep is decorated with painted has-reliefs,
while in that of Nefermaat some of the scenes are painted upon stucco
(e.g. the geese, now in the Museum at Gizeh, p. 79), while others are en-
graved in outline and the inner surfaces filled up with colours. -
Numerous graves of the humbler ranks of society have also been dis-
covered at Neidtun, In these the bodies were not interred in the usual
manner, at full length, but lying ou their left side, facing the E, and
with knees drawn up.

On the right bank, opposite Rihha and about 11/2 M. from the
river, lies the hamlet of A.tfils, with some mounds of earth and
debris representing the ancient Aphroditopolis, named after Hathor-
Aphrodite who was worshipped here.

The Egyptian name of the town was Tep-yr, or Per Humor nebt Tep-y?,
Le. Wowse of Hathon mistress of Tep-re", whence the shortened Coptic
Petpeh and Arable Afilr. Strabo states that a white cow, sacred to Hathor,
Was worshipped here.

In the Christian period (ca. 310 A.D.) Aphroditopolis gained some cel,
ehrity from St. Anthony, who fixed his hermitage in the mountains to the
E. of the tewn, beside a well and a group of palms. So many pilgrims
of every class, age, and sex sought out the holy man, that a regular post-
ing route, with relays of camels, was laid out across the desert. St. An.
thony, however, tled from his admirers and buried himself deeper in the
mountains, Bat while he thus shook oif his earthly visitents, he could
not so easily escape those extraordinary tempters from sspirit-Ur4 at which
Callot has taught us to smile, though to St. Anthony himself, as well as
to b't.Hilarion and other similarly persecuted anchorites7 the contest Was
One of bitter earnest.

Passing a few islands, we teach (W. bank) El-Wasta (rail.
station, see p. 189; branch-line to the Fayihn, p. 176; post-office
and Arab telegraph at the rail. station, 1/4 M. from the Nile).

A small canal feb-May/rs), beginning near the village of Zéwiyeh
(W. bank), runs out of the Nile into the Bahr Yasuf(p.189).

On the W. bank the mountains renede a little, but on the E. hank
their steep and lofty spurs frequently extend down to the river in
rising picturesque forms. None of the Nile-villages before Beni§uef
need he mentioned. 0n the E. bank stands the Ceptic convent of
Jhfr Antonius. - About 2 M. inland from 'rlttsn (W. bank) lies the
village of Bali (Bouche; rail. stat., p. 189), inhabited by Oopts.

711/2 M. Beniguéf, on the W. bank (rail. stat., p. 189; stat., 3/4 M.
from the Nile), is a town of15,000 inhab., pleasantly situated be-
tween the railway and the river. It contains a post and telegraph
offiee and is the capital of a province, Which contains 171 villages
and about 314,450 inhabitants. To the left of the rail. station is
