mietta (comp, p.160). The first serious attack made on h1aruyim was by
the Crusaders under Louis IX, of France in 1249. After encountering great
difthsatties they succeeded in crossing the Aghmiin Canal, but in the neigh.
bnurhood of Maru.sora they were repeatedly defeated by the young b'111.tU
el-Mo‘aggem Turaushah. Their tleet was destroyed', and 'faaninedevir'
broke out. When the ill-fated Crusaders attempted to escape they were
intercepted by the vigilant Turks, who thinned their ranks terribly and
captured the king with his brother Charles of Anjou and a number of
kaights. On 6th May, 1250, Louis and his barons were released on paw

The small mosque of Sanga, near the Russian viee-consulate, con-
tains columns brought from older edifiees, with Byzantine capitals of
Corinthian tendency, bearing Sameenie arohes. The mimbar (yulpit)
and ceiling are still embellished with remains of tine wood-Barving,
which was originally painted. - An unfounded tradition points out
an old house of Saladin’s time, near the Et-Muunfiy Mosque, as
the prison of Louis IX» (see above). - The Palace of the Khedive,
a huge and unattractive building, is used as a law-wart.

EXCURSION T0 Bssmsrh: EL-HAGER, 6-7 hrs. there and back (boat
25-30 pies.) In ascending the stream, the boat passed the town on
the left, lying close to the bank of the river. On the right is the yil-
lege of thiper, also known from an early period as Tell el- Yebiidtvelt
Chill of the Jews"), inhabited by Arabs. Many of the Jews of Man-
s.s6rs still cause their dead to be interred here. The next places are
Mt er-tHtorara and Mit Niibil on the right, and Kufr Wish (Aetbh

The road to the ruins passes through a luxuriant growth of trees
(lime-trees, silver poplars, and willows, besides the eunt-tree, the
lebbek, the tamarisk, and the bemxif shrub). A walk of 40 min.
brings us to the ruins of Behbit et-ITager, the ancient -

Iseum or Isidis Oppidum of the Romans. The ancient name of
the place was Hebet or Per-eltbét, or 'House of the god of Heber'
(Le. Horus), of Which the modern name is a corruption. Isis also
was worhipped here. Within a still distincly traceable girdle-wall
rises a heap of ruins, known as Huger et..thhntis (buffalo stone),
Which form the remains of the once magnifhserit ISIS TEMPLE "
BEEBiT, built by Nekht-Her-ehbét (30th Dyn.) aud Ptolemy 11.
Philadelyhus. The ruins of the venerable sanctuary form an im-
posing and most picturesque mass of blocks: fragments of columns
and architraves, ceiling slabs, and other remains, altogether about
400 paces in teireamferemse. The structure consisted entirely of
beautiful granite, tshietly grey, but psrtly red in colour.
