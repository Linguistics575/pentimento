SIDE CHAMBERS (Pl. r-x) open. These, used for various ee1'1g'1ous rites and
for staterooms, are adorned with reliefs and are faintly lighted by holes
in the roof. In each of the C0rrtiViy0tTt8 (Pl. m and VIII) is the entrance
to a erypt, alosed by a stone slab.

We now return to the small hypostyle hall and pass through
Room XIX to the Inner Passage between the exterior of the temple
proper and the interior of the girdle-wall. 0n the outside of the
temple walls are lions' heads as waer-spDuts and four rows of reliefs
and inscriptions. At the foot of the wall appear the king, the queen.
and a procession of local deities appmaehing the three chief gods of
Edfu. On the inner side of the E. girdle-wall (m. hh) the king ap-
pears before the various gods of Ildru; on the N. wall (PI, gg) are
similar scenes and long hymns to the gods of Edfu. 0n the W.
wall (Pl. ff) are more important reliefs and inscriptions represent-
ing the contests of the god Horus with his enemies who are de-
picted as crocodiles and hippopotami.

The chief are the following: "t Scene (below, to the right). The king,
standing on shore, attempts to trausfix a hippopotamus. which bends its
head aside. Horus, who is accompanied by his mother lsis, does the same;
in hie left hand he holds a chain, and in his right a jevelin; beside him
is his mother Isis, and behind, at the helm, is a small Hurue. - 2nd Sam.
The king appears on land, before two ships, in each ofwhich are a Home
and an assistant with a boar's head. Horus holds the hippopotamus with
a chain and pierces its head with a javelin. - Jth Scene. The hippopo-
tamus lies on its bask, with a chain fastened to its hind-feet. - 7th Scene
(the finest of all). Horus, in a ship with expanded sail, aims ablow with
his right hand at the head of a hippopotamus, the 1tiud-toot of which is
caught in a line held in the godâ€˜s left hand. Isis kneeling in the bow of the
boat holds the head of the animal by a cord. The king, standing on the
bank with two attendants armed with javelin and knife, seeks to pierce
the skull of the hippopotamus. - Farther to the left (opposite the pylon):
The king, the ram-headed Khnum, the hawk-headed Horns, and the ibis-
headed Thout are dragging a net, in which are not only birds, f'1shes, and
a stag, elm, but also two Asiatice and negroes, the ancestral foes of Egypt.

A subterranean staircase, curving to the E., leads from the E.
part of the passage round the temple to an ancient Nilometer, oat-
side the temple, also reached from without by a spiral staircase. On
the walls of the latter is the scale, with demotic numbers. The sub-
terranean communication with the river has been interrupted.

Finally, an *AsorarT TO THE Top op THE PYLON is recommended.
The doors on the S. side of the Court (to the right and left of Pl. (1
and b) lead into dark chambers, from each of which an easy staircase
of 242 steps in 14 flights ascends to the platforms of the towers.
Doors on the landings of the staircase admit to small ehsmbers,
