12 Route 2. ALEXANDRIA. Pompey's Pillar.

S.W. are Law Courts, These are the only buildings which escaped
the fury of the, natives in 1882. Beside St. Mark's Building is a bust
of General Earle, who fell at Birhekan in 1885. - From the E.
side of the square runs the busy Rue Chelrif Pacha, with its attrae-
tive shops; from the S. side the Rue dee Seems, prolonged by the
long and straight Rue Ierhfm (electric tramway], constructed
through an old and crowded Arab quarter, leads to the Mahmadiyeh
Canal (p. 11).

On both sides of the canal, in the S.W. of the city, is a quarter known as
Mme! el-Shm'guwtsh (Pi, D, If, 7) and Mine! el-Bttssd (cotton-market', Pl. D,
E, io, occupied by wholesale dealers in grain, cotton, sugar, unions, etc.
Visit in the u1oraiugiaterestiug, especially with MI introduction to FL Cot-
hm exporter.

From the s. comer of the square we reach the triangular Square
Ste. Catherine (Pl. F, 4), the name being derived from the Ilo-
man Catholic church of St. Catherine situated here. The RueAbou
Durdeh (electric tramway) leads hence to the s., passing the
Bidi Amr Mosque (Pl. G, G), to the old Forte de la Colonne or
Parts du Nil, now occupied by the Salesians as a school of art and
industry.

A little farther to the S. we pass a large Arabian cemetery, lying
on the right, and 80011 reach an eminence covered with rubbish and
fragments of ruins, on Which rises *Pompey's Pillar CPI. If, G, 7).
The monument is composed of Ted granite from Assu√©u, and it is
now the only important relic of antiquity in the oity. The found-
at'ror1s,iromposer1 of several blocks (one with the name and figure
of Sethos J., p. 1sxxii) which once belonged to other buildings, are
much damaged. The height of the column7 together with the rectan-
gular pCdFstu] and the Corinthian capital, is 89 ft.; the shaft is
(iid ft. high, and is about 9 ft. in diameter.helow7 and not quite
8 it, at the top. The pillar Was raised by the Egyptian prefect
Meximus as a landmark for sailors, and afterwards bore a statue of
the Emp. Diocletian erected in 302 A.D. by a Roman prefect named
Posidius. The present name of the pillar is due to the mediaeval
bClirl that it marked the tomb of Pompey the Great.

Following the wide road (Rue Karmouss} a little farther, and
o1ivergiug to the right by the Rue de l Usine i Gaz, we reach [10 min.)
an Egyptian Burial Place, hewn in the rocky S. slope of the
116m eoh-8hul.cii/d (hill of p0tsherds'; now a quarry) and forming the
largest extant catacomb of ancient Alexandria. The main chambers
seem to have belonged to an Egyptian grandee, while round about
are the smaller and simpler vaults of his suite end dependents. The
tomb probably dates from-the 2nd cent. A.D. and is an admirable
example of the characteristic Alexandria" fusion of the Egyptian
and Grmco-Roman styles. The chambers lie in several stories one
above another, and the lower are now tillel with waher and igaeees-
sible. The burial-plaee was discovered in 1900 and was excavated
under the superintendence of Dr. Schiess-Bey fp. (il and Dr. Betti
