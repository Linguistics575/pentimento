TELL EL- JAMAILVA Cor, better, Il-' Amama) a name derived from
the Beni Amran or El -'Amarrrs Beduins is the, name now given to
the extensive ruins and gorA-tornhs which lie near the villages of
Haggdfumlil 011 the S. and et-Tell 011 the N., and form the last
reiins of the ancient royal city Elchut-Attm, Ithe horizon of the sun’.

When Amenophis IV. (p. lxxxii) became, converted to the ex-
clusive worship of the sun and abjnred the ancient gods, he quitted
Thebes, the capital until that time, and withdrew with his court to
a new sacred spot. This was situated in the Hermopolitan name in
Central Egypt, on both banks of the Nile, and its boundaries mar
be traced to this day by inscriptions chiseiled ou the rocks near
el-Hawdja (p. 210) and et-TettCE.baulc) aud near Tune]: and Gildeh

the imposing royal abode arose the dwellings of the uobles, aud lardly
tombs were prepared for the king and his favourites in the hills to
the east. But after the death ot'Arneuophis the ancient religion
once more obtained the upper hand, the court returned to Thebes,
and the new town rapidly decayed. Its life had not lasted for more
than 50 years, and the site upon which it stood was never again
occupied. Owing to this circumstance the ancient streets and
ground-plans have remained to this day and may be trwed with
little trouble. The religious revolution under Amenophis IV. was
accompanied by a revolution in art. The artists who worked in his
reign, probably feeling themselves more independent of ancient
traditions, attempted to lend their creations an expression more in
accordance with nature. 111 many vases, however, they fell into BN-
aggeration, atsI for example, in the representations of the lean form
