been offered of why the Greeks bestowed upon it the name Thebes
C87i3a0,which was home by cities inBceotia, Attica, Thessaly, Ci1i-
uia, near Miletus in Asia Minor, etc. Among the Greeks the town,
including the W. bank, was known also as Ato’cmhg, ‘city ofZeus'
(Ammon),also called Diospolia M megale or Diospalis Mayne to dis-
tinguish it from Diospolis Parva or H6u (p. 224). Wéset was the
capital of a nome, and it was ruled by princes of its own, whose
tombs (6th Dyn.) were discovered at Drah Ahu’l Negga. The local
deity was the hawk-headed Mont, a god of war, who was also wor-
shipped in the neighbouring town of Hermonthis. Several other
places lay near WEset ou the E. bank; among these were Epet-
Esowet (the modern Kamak) and South Opel (modern Luxor), which
were afterwards incorporated with the great 'city' and subjected to
the same rulers.

When the Theban princes assumed the royal dignity during
the Middle Empire, Thebes rose to a more commanding position.
The city was adorned with temples, amongst which the large shrines
raised in Epet-Esowet and South Opet to their local deity Ammon
were conspicuous. But the greatness of Thebes dates only from the
beginning of the New Empire. The liberation of the country from
the Hyksos and the reunion ofthe empire was directed ttintl Thebes,
and that city continued for centuries to be the favourite seat ofthe
Pharaohs, and the reservoir into which flowed the untold treasures
exacted as tribute or brought as booty from conquered nations. A
large share of this wealth was bestowed upon Amman. The mag-
nificent and gigantic temple, erected at this period to the god, is
still one of the chief sights of Thebes. The gralldees of the kingdom
esteemed it an honour to become priests of Ammon, the schools be-
side his temples flourished, and the kings offered their richest gifts
to this god, from Whom they expected a surer fulhhnent of their
petitions than from any other. The fame of the huge city early
reached the ears even of the Greeks. In a possibly interpolated pas-
sage of the Iliad LIX, 379-384), Achilles, enraged with Agamem-
non, assures Ulysses that he will never more unite in council or in
deed with the great Atrides: -

"Ten times as much, and twenty times were vain; the high pil'd store

or rich Mycenae, and if he ransack wide earth for more,

Search old Orchomeuns for gold, and by the fertile stream

Where, in Egyptian Thebes, the heaps of precious ingots gleam,

The hundred-gated Thebes, where twice ten score in martial state

Of valiant men with steeds and cars march through each massy gate."
(Blackie‘s Translation.)

The epithet émréomlog, Le. 'hundred-gated', here used by
Homer,was also applied by later classical authors to Thebes. Diodorus,
Straho, Pliny, and Stephanus of Byzantium all make use of it, rsfer-
ring to the gates of the town, as symbols ofits size and power. The
