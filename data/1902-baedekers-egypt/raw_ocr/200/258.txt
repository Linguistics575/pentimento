Barbers' (P1. a), because the students used to have their heads shaved
here. To the right of this gateway is the Mesgid Ta'ibarsiyeh CPI. 2),
with a magnifieeut mihrib, 0r prlryer-re0ess, of 1309, and to the
left are the offioe of the steward CPI. 31, in a restored mausoleum,
and the ziiwiyet eL-0tisrlgwtyee CPI. 4], now used as a library.

The long archway, ending in a portal added by [Cart Bey (by
whom the adjacent minaret was also built), leads directly into the
large Salm el- Gihni'a, or moirque-eourt, enclosed by an arcade
(restored), with Persian 1ceel-srel1es, niches, medallions, and open-
work pinnacles.

The Sanctum", with its nine aisles, now forming the principal
hall of instruction, has 140 marble columns C100 antique) and covers
an area of about 3600 sq. yds. The front aud-older part is low in
the ceiling. The part at the back, to Which we ascend by a few
steps, has considerably higher arcades, restored a few years ago.
The hall is imperfectly lighted. A staircase to the right of 'Abd
er-lubrnin's pulpit (mimbur) ascends to an upper story, Which is
assigned to students from Mecca and Yemen. On the S. side is the
Tomb of 'Abd er-RMunin (Pl. 8). The N. side is bounded by the
very elegant little mosque of Eiiwiyet Cx6harg1veh (Pl. 9j, recently
restored.

The ceilings of the Northern and of the Southern Ltwfm are
supported by double eolonnades. The N. Ltwin is adjoined by the
Court of Ablutions (Pl. li), with a square basin in the centre.

The Lateral Iittoiine and many of the subsidiary buildings of
the mosque are divided by partitions or railings into Riwzika, or
separate chambers (literally, oolonuadesj. Each M' these is set apart
for the use of the natives of a particular country, or of a particular
province of Egypt (comp. the Plan and its reference numbers 12-22,
p. 44). Most of the students are natives of Egypt, so that the
Egyptian riwfilgs (Upper Egypt, Lower Egypt, Eastern Egypt] are
the largest, each having several hundred students. About twenty
years ago the total number of students was 7600-7700, taught by
230 professors; but since the British occupation the numbers have
sensibly diminished, especially as no students now come from the
former equatorial provinces of Egypt. The university of Cairo is,
however, still the largest in the domain of 1jll-Islimi and at the last
census the mosque was occupied by 6923 souls. - The nationality
of the various groups of students'may be learned from the guide.
This being one of the fountain-heads of Mohammedan fanaticism,
the traveller should, of course7 throughout his visit, be careful not
to indulge openly in any gestures of amusement or contempt.

The S'rvnm'rs (Mugdwirzâ€˜n) ua11a11y remain three, and sometimes from
four to six years in the mosque. They pay no fees, but each viwii.k is sup-
ported by an annual subsidy from the endowments of the mosque. There
is Also a separate riwilg, called the Zdwiyet Wr0mpiin, for blind students,
fur whose maintenance a portion of the funds is set apart. - The PRO-

ressona, or Shims, receive no salary, either from the mosque or from
government, but support themselves by teaching in private houses, by
