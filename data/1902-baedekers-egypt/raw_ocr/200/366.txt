MEMPHIS. 9. Route. 131

At Wo M.) Bedtashén visitors bound for Memphis and 8ald.itirs
leave the train, which goes on to Upper Egypt. The stationlies to
the right of the line. We ride along the railway, turn to the right,
cross a bridge, and follow the embankment towards the village of
Bedrashén and a conspicuous grove of palms on the W. We pass
through the bazaar of the village, where candles may be bought at a
Greek 'ba.kirgl'. On each side of the embankment lie green fields in
spring and summer, and large expanses of water in autumn and
the first half of winter, The embankment ends near the first trees
of the palm-groves, 20 min, from the station. The large mounds ot'
rubbish before IIS, shaded by palms, and strewn with blocks "
granite, broken pottery, and fragments ofhrick, mark the ancient -

Site ot Memphis.

Were it not for the vast Neeropolis to the w. of the ancient
city, no one would imagine that one of the most famous and pop-
ulous capitals of antiquity had once stood here. The Egyptians,
from the earliest period down to the Roman imperial epoch, built
their ediiiises, with the exception of palaces and tcmples, of large
sun-dried bricks of Nile-mud; but even the public buildings of
Memphis have entirely disappeared, as the stones Were carried off in
former centuries to build other eiiifiises on the right bank of the
Nile. The narrow streets, which are said to have been half-a-
day's Journey in length even down to the 12th cent, extended
between the Nile and the Girzeh Canal7 to the N. as far as Gizeh,
and to the S. about as far as the latitude of the Pyramids of Dosiulr.
The most important quarters and buildings of the city appear to have
stood in the fields of the villages of Bedrashén and Mit Rahineh.

HISTORY. Memphis, the capital of the home of 'the White Wall',
belonged to Lower Egypt and from a very early period played an im.

ortant strategic and political rele, owing to its position on the borders
getween the two ancient kingdoms of the 'North' and the 'South' (p.1xxv).
A later tradition ascribes its foundation to Menes, the first historical ruler
in Egypt, who is said to have built also the temple of Ptah (Hephaestus),
the patron-god of the city. Memphis consisted of several quarters, the
most important of Which were the 'White Wall' (in later times the citadel).
the 'South Wall', with a temple of Ptah, and the 'House of the Spirit of
Ptah', or great temple-precinuts of that god. Under the 6th Dyn. a new
quarter was founded, in which King Pepi fixed the residence of his court
and near which the sepnlchral pyramid of the ruler was situated. This
quarter, and also the pyramid, were called Jfevitcé-mersmofer, Le. King
Meriré (Pepi) remains beautiful', and this name [in the later form Men};
in Greek Memphis) was afterwards applied to the whole city. Memphis
attained its greatest prosperity under the monarchs of the Ancient Empire,
Who resided here or in the Vicinity (near Gizeh). When Thebes became
the centre of Egypt and the Thcban Ammon the most revered among
the gods, under the Middle and New Empires, Memphis appears to have
retrograded. Bat even in the time of the 20th Dyn. the temple of Ptah
Was the largest in the country bat two. In the couree of the contests
for the possession ofEgypt, which raged after the 22nd Dyn., the city was
captured by the Ethiopian Piankhi and by the Assyrians, and on several
other occasions.
