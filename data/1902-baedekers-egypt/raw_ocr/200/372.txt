SAKKRRA, 9. Route. 133

Fem: Mir RmiNEH (Memphis)ro Ssyriica. We ride towards the
W. from the statues of Ramses, leaving the village of Mit Rahineh
at a little distance to the right. On quitting the palm-grove we
obtain an attractive view; immediately to the right, shaded by
palm-trees and lehbeke, is the small House of Tigran-Bey, a nephew
of Nubar Pasha. About 1 M. to the W. is anotherlong palm-grove
surrounding 8attira and bordering the desert; beyond this, on the
yellow sand of the desert, rise eleven pyramids. The first of these,
to the left, is the S. briek-pyramid, beyond which are the blunted
pyramid, the N. briek-pyremid, and the great pyramid, all belong-
ing to the group of Dahsht1r o. 153). Not far from these we next
perceive the Mestaha Fir'aull, with the pyramid of Pepi H.; then,
exactly above the houses of futl.rira, two pyramids, the lesser of
which is that of Pepi L; and, lastly, to the right, the pyramid of
onnos, the great step-pyramid, and two smaller ones (to the right,
that of Teti). These last eight pyramids belong to the group of
8ablsira. - Having nearly reached (3/4 hr. from the statues of
Ramses) Saltlcdw, We leave the village to the left, passing an open
space with a pond, turn towards the N., and skirt the palm-groves.
At the end of these, on the left, is aheautiful, shady sycamore,
close to a spring of good water.

A different route must he followed during the period of the inundation,
when the low ground between Mit Rahineh and Sahkin is under water.
From the statues of Ramses we return to the t5 min.) end of the embank-
ment (see p. 131), which leads hack to Bedrashiha, and then turn to the
N., traverse the whole of thc palm-grove, and ride through the brick
houses of ancient Memphis, until we reach another embankment which
winds across the lain towards the W., and is interrupted by a bridge
with sluices. In 2 min, more we reach the margin of the desert beside
some brick ruins (marked 'Remains of a house in crude brick' on the map)
where we join the above route.

The united two routes ascend to the plateau , and bring us in
sight of the vast *Wecropolia of Sukkara, which extends about
41/3 M. in length from N. to 8., and 1/4-1 M. in width from E. to W.
It contains sepulehral monuments of every kind, dating both from
the ancient and the later empire. Loose heaps of light-eoluured
sand mark the position of recent excavations. The whole of the
Neeropolis has been repeatedly explored both by the Byzantines and
the Khalifs, as Well as by modern explorers. The Arab name 8ay.kdra
has probably arisen from the corruption of some earlier Egyptian
name connected with Salem, the god of the dead of Memphis.

Two routes to Maritstte's House, which is 20 min. distant, are
shown on the map. That to the right passes several unimportant
pyramids, with the so-ealled Cemetery of the Oats, where numerous
mummies of cats and ibises were found, to the extreme right. No-
thing is tobe seen here, as the tombs are now closed, being considered
dangerous. The whole of the soil of the Neeropolis is indeed so
honeyeumhed with tombs that great caution should be used in tra-
versing it. - The route to the left, leading straight towards the Step
