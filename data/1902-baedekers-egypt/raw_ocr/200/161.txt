cl HISTORY OF ART.

Egyptian reliefs are either Bas-Relieft, the earliest andpt all
periods the commonest form, or Incised Beliefs ('reliefs en creuxâ€™),
to which the design is sunk helow the surface. Painting occurs in
Egypt only as an accompaniment of or as a suhstitute for sculpture.
Statues and reliefs were almost invariably painted, and even stones
that are naturally eoloured, such as granite, basalt, ete., appear to
have been subjected to this general rule of polychromatic embel-
lishment. When painting was used instead of sculpture (as, 6.9., in
the tombs of the 18th Dyn.), it was so either in order to save ex-
pense or because the available stone was not suitable for carvings.
That the same rules of drawing applied to paintings as applied to
reliefs needs scarcely be stated.

Egyptian relief, like Egyptian statuary, attained its highest
point under the 5th Dyn. (p. lxxx). The high level of technical amt
artistic skill attained at that period is best illustrated in the Maetabas
of Ti and Ptahhotep at buyl.sraop.137,i39). Under the 6th Dyn. and
during the Middle Empire both carving and enmposition had hegun
to decline, though it must he admitted that the artists of Benilgesan
(p. 197) added a valuable series of new motives (military scenes,
provincial life, funeral scenes) to the previous list of subjects. The
free and naturalistic tendency received a fresh impetus in the middle
of the 18th Dyn., when the new political relations of Egypt with
Asia Minor opened up a new horizon to the "tist, and the strange
importations from foreign countries supplied him with novel sugges-
tions. In particular, the wonderfully faithful representations of
animal-life during this period may challenge comparison with the
best achievements of other nations in this direction. The traveller
will find the finest specimens of these works in the tombs of Shf-kh
Abd el-Kurnzt o. 288).

Unfortunately, however, this naturalistic tendency soon ran into
exaggeration. In the reign of Amenophis IV., doubtless in connec-
tion with the religious reformation of that time (p.1xxxiO, it found
its way into the official art of the court and iatimyneed the represents-
tions of the king and the court, but it there quickly degenerated
into mannerism. Reaction was the natural consequence, and a
return was soon made to the ancient style, hampered as it was with
its strict rules of composition. But in spite of all traditional stiffness
of composition and grouping, this reactionary art attained a high
level once more under Sethos L, from whose reign date the delicate
and graceful reliefs in the temple at Abydos. But a rapid decline
set in under Ramses IL, probably in consequence of the too lavish
demands made upon artistic resources for the decoration of the nu-
merous new temples. - Although the reaction against the art of
Amenophis IV. expunged a number of subjects from the list of those
available in offioivl representations, the warlike exploits of the
monarchs of the 19th and 20th Dyn. provided new material in
compensation. No advance towards lucidity of grouping is shown
