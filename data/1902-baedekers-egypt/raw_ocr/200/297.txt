78 Route 6. MUSEUM OF GIZEH.

the Survey Department (Director, Capt. Lyons) and the Mudirtyeh
of the province of Cizeh, and a tine view of the Pyramids. The
tramways halt at the Zoological Gardens (p. 105) and at the landing-
place for the ferry from Old Cairo (p. 69), about 5 min. walk from
the entrance of the Museum in the palace of Gizeh.

The Palace of Gizeh, a huge rambling editiee, built in a light
and 11nsubstantial0rienu1 style, with about 500 saloons and apart-
ments, was erected by the Khedive Isma‘il for his harem at a cost
stated at 120 million francs. In 1889 the Museum of Egyptian
Antiquities, formerly at Btlil.r, was installed here, but the process
of transferring this valuable collection to a more suitable and safer
sdifiee, recently completed, has begun (see p. 40).

The MMuseum of Egyptian Antiquities is the most valuable
collection of the kind. It was founded by the eminent French Egypt-
ologist Aug. Mariette (d. 1881). The present director is the no less
eminent G. Maspem; the conservator is Emil Brugsch-Bey, assisted
by Ahmed Kamal Bey and s. Davessy. - The earliest description of
the Museum is Mariette’s 'Les Prirseipaus Monuments du Musée de
Baulacq' (18M); Maspero also published a ' Guide du Visiteur auMuse'e
de Boutaeg' (1884). The present detailed Catalogue (1394], which
is sold at the entrance, though not perfect, is quite indispensable
for students. The more important and the more recently acquired
objects are provided with full descriptive labels in French. Owing
to the alterations consequent upon the removal to the new building,
the following description does not preteml to accuracy on all points.

The museum is open in winter daily, except Mon. and Frid., from
5330 till 4.30, in summer (16th April to 15th Oct.) from 8.30 to
12; admission 5 piastres, free in summer. Sticks and umbrellas are
given up at the entrance and returned at the exit (no fee).

A special room is reserved for Students; apply to the director or to
one of the conservators. - In the Sale Roona (R. 1in duplicates: etc.. of the
antiquities may be purchased, " prices fixed by the Museum authorities
and plainly marked on the objects offered. Purchases here made have, ot
course, a guarantee of their genuineness (comp. also p. xv). A permit
to export is given with each purchase, - Travellers going on to Upper
Egypt should provide themselves here with l GENERAL Amneswx TICKET
ut the Service des Antiquite’s de I‘Eyypre (f 1 Eu, romp. p. Wt), admitting
them to all monuments.

In the Garden near the entrance is a tall pedestal supporting
a Sphinx in red granite, with the names of the Pharaoh Ramses IL,
added later. On the right of the road to the palace is the top of an
Obelisk, dating from the reign of Queen Makere, whose figure was
replaced by sagritieial tables under Thutmosis IO. On a platform
of masonry in front of the main entrance rests the marble sarwphagus
of Aug. Mariette (see above).
