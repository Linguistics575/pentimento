in 1293, ie the largest monument of its period and is of con-
siderable architectural interest. Many of its details, especially the
windows, recall the Romanesque style of Europe. Originally there
Was a separate ward for every known disease, besides lecture-rooms
for students and an orphanage. Now, however, decay and alteration
have so changed the building that only the wards surrounding the
principal court can be iyontidently identified.

The Portal is constructed of black and White marble, and is of
imposing height. The doors still show traces of their former covering
of bronze. The ceiling of the entrance, with its open beams, is also
very effective; the other corridors are vaulted in the Gothic style.
The first door on the left leads into the mosque; the second door on
the right leads to the Vestibule of the Tomb of J.rt4tr0n. The tomb
itself contains tine granite columns and pillars, which once sup-
ported the dome. The prayer-recess, with its mosaics, its beautiful
i1warf-srriytriles, and its shell-shaped ornamentation, is also worthy of
notice. The marble and tortoise-sheil ornamentatiun of the lower
parts ofthe walls and pillars is the finest inCairo. In the tomb chamber
are still preserved articles of dress which once belonged to JPrlMn
and are popularly supposed to possess miraculuns healing virtues.

Adjacent to the Mrtristtus, as the second of the three eirdlees
mentioned above, is the *Medréseh and Tomb of Mohmmed en-
Nhgir, dating from about 1303, but now almost a total ruin.

We enter it from the street by a marble portal in the late-Romanesque
style, brought by a brother of Naeir from the church ofAkka, which was
destroyed in 1291. The top of it has been completed in the Arab mannert
The door leads into a corridor, on theright side ofwhich is the tomb of High
(dome in ruins), while to the left is the eanctuery of the medréseh, with
interesting plaster carvings on the side of the prayer-recess. In front are
the ruins of the main building, now containing workshops and huts of
the poor. The remnants of plaster decorations on the back~walls, like
those in the medréseh and on the interesting miuaretu, recall in some
respeots those of the Alhambra.

The third large building is the 'Barlrtilrireh, the medréseh of
Sultan 13ka Ci382-99; p. xcvi), built in 1384, Which also con-
tains the tomb of the daughter of Barl.rtolp It possesses an interest-
ing marble portal and a bronze-mounted door. The greater part of
it was thoroughly restored a few years ago, and the euluuring and
gilding applied to the sanctuary and mausoleum are, unforunately,
much too loud. - Opposite is a modern sehil.

Continuing to follow the busy Shdri'a err-Nayldifm (p. 59), the
continuation of the Géhergiyeh, we come to the Sebil 'Abd er-Ray-
mdn, at a fork of the street, one of the prettiest structures of its sort
in Cairo (18th cent.) On the grouudi1oor is the chamber for the dis-
tributiun of the water, tastefully decorated with fayeuce. Upstairs is
the hall of an elementary school, commanding a striking retrospect
of the busy street, with the three red and white mosques and their
minarets to the right. To the left is the huge fngade of the palace
oflhir Beshték (P1. B, 3), erected in the first half of the 14th cent.
