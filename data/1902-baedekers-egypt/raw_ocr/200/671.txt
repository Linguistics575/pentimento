appears the praying figure of Setaw, who was governor of Ethiopia
under Ramses II. Beyond the pylon extended originally a court
enclosed by brick walls, while at the back stood a hall, supported
by four proto-Dorie (p.0xxxiii) columns. This court was afterwards
converted by Thutmosis IV. into a covered HYPOSTYLE HALL (still
in good preservation) by the erection of 12 columns and stone side-
walls. The reliefs on the pillars and walls show Thutmosis W. in
intercourse with the gods; and the votive inscriptions on the pillars
and architraves also date from that king. The columns are em-
bellished with perpendicular bands of inscriptions, containing dedi-
cations by Thutmosis III. or Amenophis Il., who are also represented
on the rear-wall before the gods.

The following TBANsvense CHAMBER is 'lil/s ft. broad and 61/2
deep. To the right on the inside of the Entrance Wall is Thut-
mosis III. embraced by Isis, and then Amenophis II. offering liba-
tions to Ammon-Ré. On the left Thout and Horus of Edfu pour the
consecrating water, symbolized by the hieroglyphs for 'life', over
Amenophis II. - Three doors in the back-wall of this room lead
into other apartments The central one enters the SANCTUARY, on
the back-wail of which is a Stole of great historical importance. At
the top is a relief of Amenophis II. presenting two vessels of wine
to Ré-Harmachis and Ammon; beneath is an inscription of 20 lines,
from the 3rd year of the reign ofAmenophis IL, recording the comple-
tion of the temple begun by Thutmosis III. and the campaign of
Amenophis II. in Syria. Among other details the king records that
he captured seven Syrian princes and hanged six of them on the
walls of Thebes and the seventh at Napata. (p. 382). - Doors (of
later construction) to the right and left of the sanctuary each admit
into two Chambers, also accessible from the above-mentioned trans-
verse chamber. The most interesting reliefs here are those in the
tirst room to the right, representing the ceremonies at the foundation
of a temple.

Between the temple and the river are the foundations of a small Chapel.

The Nile here describes a curve from E. to W., on the E. bank
of which are (10 M.) Diwdn and -

Derr, one of the lnrndsomest villages in Nubia, prettily situated
beneath Sycamores and date-palms. On the river-bank is the ruined
residence of the Kishif, who was formerly independent ruler of
Lower Nubia. In the village is a large mosque, and between the
village and the hills lies an extensive cemetery with a tasteful
shGh's tomb. Close by, at the foot of the hills, lies the small and
unfortunately mach injured Book Temple ofDerr. This was known
to the Egyptians as the ‘Temple of Ramses in the House of 135’ (Le.
in 1urliopolis-Derr). It was built by Ramses Il., and was dedicated
to the sun-god ite-Harmachis. We tirst enter the much ruined
GREAT HYPOSTYLE HALL, 42h ft. deep by 46 ft. broad, the sides of
whi(h were partly formed by the smoothed rocks of the hill. The
