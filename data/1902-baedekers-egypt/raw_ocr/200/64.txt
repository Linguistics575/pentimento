GEOLOGICAL NOTICE. ]iii

Amidst the desert sand of the isthmus, which even in Lower Egypt
farms :1 substratum underlying the Nile mud, and in the E. part of the
desert is nearly covered with a solid gypsenus and saline arust, the rock
occasionally crops up, or has been uncovered in the amuse of the ex-
cavation of the penal. Near the Sbaliif station (p. 171] a greenish-grey,
gypscous marl overlies the solid limestone, Which euntains the tertiary
marine conehylia, sharks' teeth, and remains of crocodiles» and am-
phibious mammalia. The same formation occurs in other places 3180,
and ridges of the early tertiary nummulite limestone likewise occasionally
rise from the plain. At several points on the coast of the Red Sea,
particularly near linger (p. 347), at a height of 600-950 ft. above the sea-
levcl, we find rock of the late tertiary " diluviel eta containing coral,
which shows how much the land must have risen since that period.

To the postpliocene, or latest tertiary period, belong several isolated
deposits of sandstone near Cairo, in which are found the beautiful fna-
MI sca-urehins (Clypeaster Aeyypliacus) frequently offered for sale near
the Pyramids (p. 113). One of the principal geological curiosities near
Cairo is the Petriyied Forest (comp. p Ill).

Above Cairo, to the s., the Nile is tlanked by ranges of hills, beyond
which, to the E., stretches the Arabian desert, and to the W. the Libyan
desert. The hills on both hanks of the Nile consist of early tertiary num-
mulite limestone. The strata dip gradually from south to north, so that
the further we amend the Nile the older are the strata that we meet
with. To the south of Edfu the hummulite limestone disappears, being
succeeded by quartzose sandstone, belonging to the middle or upper
chalk formation, and forming eunsiderable cliii'a at the Gebel Silsileh
(p. 320), which coniiae the river within a narrow bed. This last formation,
known as ‘Nubian sandstone', covers many thousands of square miles of
Nubia and the Sudan. From Assuan to Silsileh the Nile tiows through
Nubian sandstone, but near the ancient Syene a transverse barrier of granite
and 'sreaite' advances from the mist, forming the boundary between Egypt
and Nubia. This barrier extends eastwards for about 180 miles, forming
a very irregular chain of bzu'rcn hills $00-13% ft. in height. The Nile
has forced a passage for itself through this hard rock, exposing to view
at places the beautiful red fclspzu' crystals which it contains, and forms
the flvst cataract at Assuftn (p. M?).

(2) THE ARABXAN DESERT (pp. MI et aisq0. Parallel with the coast of the
Red Sea, a broad and massive range of mountains, rising to & height of
6600 ft. and consisting of crystalline rocks (granite, syenite, diorite, por-
phyry, horr1blende-s1Bte _ gnciss, mica-slate, etc.), runs through the Arabian
Desert, sending forth numerous rIunih'tuxtim1s into the interior of the
aountty. This range is adjoined on the E. by roof-st-it, tstratified form»
ations. At first there oucurs a considerable stratum 0f Nubian sandstone,
next to which we iind a series of clayey 11nd unlearenus strata belonging
to the upper white ebalk (Urination. Theec strata are succeeded by ex-
tensive masses of limestone, belonging to the nummulite formation, and
stretching to the Nile. These extensive mountains, with their numerous
profound ravines and boldly shaped masses " ruck, impart a must im-
posing character to the Arabian Desert. This region is by no means so
destitute of vegetation as is usually supposed; for, although without oases.
it contains. particularly in the N. part, :1 number of springs and natural
cisterns, which are filled by the rare, bat often copious, ruins of winter.

" THE LIBYAN DESERT, This region again presents an entirely dif-
ferent character. It consists of an immense, morwtor1ous, and stony table-
land, 650-1000 ft. above the level of the Nile, extending between the Nile
and the oases of Khérgeh, Di1chel, Farifra, end Bahriyeh. The surface
of the desert rises in gradations, each preceded by * broad girdle of isolated
mounds, which have obviously been formed by erosion, the materials
having been washed down from the adjoining plateau. The whole of this
stony and absolutely anwatered plain, the monntnny of which is only
varied by a few solitary ranges of sand-hills, consists of nummulitc limo
stone. In the direction of the oases it descends in precipitous slopes,
