vi PRE FACE.

The materials for the first edition of the volume on Lower
We, were mainly furnished in 1877 by Professor G. Ebers
0 Leipsic. Among the contributions prepared for the
English version were those of the distinguished Egyptolo-
gist, Dr, SamuelBirclz. The volume on Upper Egypt, orig-
inall published in 1891, was founded on material contributed
by Izafessor Ebers and Professor I Ihtmichen of Strassburg.
The present combined edition, like the preceding, has been
completely revieed by Professor Gewg 8teindorir of Leipsie,
who devoted a journey to Egypt in 1900 mainly to this object.
The introductory articles bearing their names have also been
specially revised by Franz-Pasha and Ds, Georg 8chweinfurth
of Cairo. For other important contributions the Editor is
obliged to Dr. Borchardt of Cairo, to Dr. Leigh Canney of
Aswan, to Mr. Percy E.Newbe7'ry ofLondon, to Dr. H. Schilfer
of Berlin, to Dr. ll. Thievseh ofMunich, to Prof. Moritz of
Cairo, and to Dr. I David of Khartrhn.

The MAPS and PLANS have been the object of the Editor's
special care, and all have been carefully revised by Prof.
Steindorff, with the aid of the most recent publications and
of much valuable unpublished material, kindly placed at his
disposal by Prof. Loret of Lyons, M. G. Legrain ofGairo,
and others. To the present edition have been added entire-
ly new maps of the Fuytsm, ofthe Nile from Cairo to Aisstian
(3 sheets; 1 : 500,000), and of the environs of Assfusn; new
plans of Part Sa’id, Luxor, etc.; and many new ground-plans.
The spelling of the names on the new maps follows the offi-
cial French system of transliteration adopted in the ‘Recenee-
ment général de yEgypte du 1 juin 1897', published in 1898.
In all the maps and plans the North is at the top of the page,
except where there is an express indication to the contrary.

Ancient Egyptian names are transliterated on the system
indicated at p. Uvi. Arabic names have been specially revised
by Professor Socin of Leipsic.

HOTELS, etc., see p. xviii. Hotels which cannot be ac-
curately characterized without exposing the Editor to the risk
of legal proceedings are left unnnentioned.

To hotel-proprietors, tradesmen, and others the Editor
begs to intimate that a character for fair dealing and cour-
tesy towards travellers forms the sole passport to his com-
mendation, and that advertisements of every kind are strictly
excluded from his Handbooks. Hotel-keepers are also warned
against lgersons representing themselves as agents for Thur.
