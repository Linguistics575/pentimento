Towards the close of the New Empire the power of the Egyptian state
gradually declined, until finally not even the last restiag-plaoes of the
dead could be secured from robbers. Not only the necroyolis at Drah
AbirNegga (p. 262), but even the secluded tombs in the 'Valley of Wmgs'
(p. 262) were plundered. The authorities recognized their impotence and
contented lhemselves with rescuing the murnmies of the ancient Pharaohs.
The mummy of Ramses II. was therefore transferred from its tomb at
Hibiin el-Malin; (p. 267) to that of Selhos L, and when that refuge ceased
to be deemed secure, both bodies were removed to the tomb of Amenophis 1.
Finally, under the gist Dyn., it we: resolved to protect the royal mummies
from farther profunation by iuterriag them all together in a rocky cleft
near Dér el-ballri (p. 283), which was artificially widened for the purpose.
The corpses of the ruling dynasty were also placed here. Thus at last
the remains of the great monarchs of the New Empire -Amogis L,
Thntmosis III. Sethos I., and Ramses II. - were left in peace until in
1875 the fellahm once more discovered their secret reatiug-place and the
plundering of the mummies began again. The modern thieves succeeded
in keeping their secret to themselves for a considerable period, but in
1881 they were traced, and the mummies were deposited in the museum
at Cairo to save them from the hands of the robbers.
