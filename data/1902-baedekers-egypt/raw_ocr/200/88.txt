POPULAR FESTIVALS. Hxvii

The month Jiar,naPin is succeeded by that of Shawwrth on the flrst
th1ee days of Which is celebrated the tirst aad minor festival of rejoicing,
called by the Arabs Ei-mi eg- thtithayyiv (the lesser feast), but better
known by its Turkish name of Beirut». The object of the festival is to
give expression to the general rejoicing at the termination of the ttst;
and, as at our Christmas, parents give presents to their children, and
masters to their servants at this festive season. Friends embrace each
other on meeting, and visits of ceremony are exchanged. During this fes-
tival the Khedive also receives his principal ofiie'1als, ambassadors, etc.

At this season the traveller may also pay a visit 'to the cemetery by
the Bath en- -Nas.r, " tu 'me of the others, wheve numerous Cairehes assemble
to place palm- -branclies or basilicum (rain) on the graves of their deceased
relatives, and to distribute dates, bread, and other gifts among the poor.

A few days after the Beirém the pieces of the Kisweh or covering
manufactured at Constantinople, at the cost of the Sultan, for the Ku'ba
(the most sacred sanctuary in the interior of the temple at Mecca), whither
it is annually carried by the pilgrims, are conveyed in procession to
the citadel, where they are sewn together and lined. The ceremonies
which take place on this occasion are repeated on a grander scale towards
the end of the mouth of Slmwwdl (generally the 23rd), when there is a
gay procession of the escort which accompanies the pilgrimage caravan to
Mecca, and also takes charge of the Mnhmal (p.1xxvi). 011 this occasion
every true believer in the prophet, if he possibly can, spends the whole day
in the streets. The women don their smartest ettire. Many of the harem
windows are opened, and the veiled inmates gaze into the streets. The
chief scene of the ceremonies is the ltuméleh (P1. F, 21, where a sumptuous
tent of red velvet and gold is pitched for the reception of the dignitaries.
The procession is headed by soldiers, who are followed by camels adorned
with gaily coloured trappings, and hearing on their humps bunches of
palm-hranches with oranges attached. Each section of the csvalcarle is
preceded by an Arabian band of music, the largest section being that which
accompanies the Takht Rawdn, or litter of the Emir el-Iangg, and the
next in order that of the Dem et-tfagg, or leader of the pilgrims, with his
attendants. Next follow various detachments of pilgrims and dervishcs with
banners and lastly the Mahmal (see p.1xxvi). A picturesque appearance
is presented by the camp of the assembled pilgcims0.Gggi) at the Biiket
el- Aragg (p.108), whence the caravan finally starts for Mecca

On the 10th of BM! higgeh the twelfth month, begins the great ies,
tival of El-‘Id ei-irebrv, which resembles the lesser feast (el-'td e?-r.u1g-
heyyir) already mentioned. On this day, if 011 no other throughout the
year, every faithful Muslim eats a piece of meat in memory of the sacriv
flee of Abraham, and the poor are presented with meat by the rich.

With the RISIXG OF THE Nrrm there are also connected several ir1teo
esting festivals, closely resembling those of the ancient period of the
Pharaohs, which even the Christian epoch was unable entirely to ob-
literate. As, however, they take place in summer, few travellers will
have an opportunity of witnessing them. As these festivals have refer-
once to a regularly recurring phenomenon of nature, their dates are ne-
cessarily tixed in accordance with the Coptic solar reckoning " time, in-
stead of the variable Arabian lunar year. - The night of the 11th of the
Coptic month eariina (17th June) is called Eaet cn-IVUI-cta, Le. the 'night
of the drop', as it is believed that it drop from heaven Cor a tear of Isis,
asterding to the ancient Egyptian myth) falls into the Nile on this night
and causes its rise. The astrologers profess to calculate precisely the
hour of the fall of the sacred drop. The Cnirehes spend this night on
the banks of the Nile, either in the open air, or the houses of friends
near the river, and practise all kinrls of superstitious customs. One of
these consists in the placing of a piece of dough by each member of a
family on the roof of the house- if the dough rises, happiness is in store
for the person who placed it there, while its tuilure to rise is regarded
as a bad nmeu. On let June the river begins slowly to rise (comp.
p. l). On the 27th of the Coptic month Ba' unit (3rd July) the Manda“
