in the camp; now released from their burdens, they testify satisfaction by
means of movements and attitudes which the artist seems never tired D
drawing. The soldiers are conversing with each other, and one drinks
from a wine-skin. Disputes end quarrels are not wanting, and the camp-
followers ply their stave: aatively on each other. Above, to the right,
the tranquillity of the camp is rudely disturbed by an attack of the Hit,
tites. To the Right the king, seated upon his throne, takes counsel with
his princes who stand before him; close by is the royal chariot. Beneath
captured spies are being beaten, in order to extract information. - The
representation! on the 5. Wing of the pylon are even more realistic. The
left half is occupied hy the picture of the battle of Kudesh, which we
have already seen on the pylon at Luxor (p. 240). Ramses in his chariot
dashes against the foes, who are either slain by his arrows or flee in wild
confusion and fell into the Orontes. Behind the king are his war-chan’ote.
To the right, at a distance from the scene of action, is the Hittite prince.
Ahove is a second, now scarcely distinguishahle, representation of the
Hittitee fleeir1g to their fortress. The reliefs on the right half show the
usual presentment of the king, grasping enemies by the hair and smitiug
them; further to the right is the king holding a long "alf, and accom-
panied by far1-bearevs.

On the interior walls of the Portal of this pylon are the usual reliefs
of Ramses s;yerilkirrg to various gods. At the top of the Jambs (P1. a, b)
Ramses appears pacing out the precincts of the temple (a rite performed
at the foundation of a temple); " the bottom, various deities.

The First Court is now utterly mined, and scarcely a trace re-
mains of the eolonnades that bounded it on two sides. Fragments,
however, of the lofty wall on the W. side are still standing. In front
of the ancientW. gate lie the remains of the *Colossus ofRamses 11.,
the hugest statue in Egypt. The name offtamses IL appears in well-
preserved hieroglyphies on the upper arm and on the seat of the
statue, The face is unfortunately completely destroyed. The re-
mains (breast, upper arm, one foot, etc.) still testify to the care
with which this gigantic monument was chiselled and polished.

The savents of the French Ex edition carefully measured the various
parts, as follows: length of ear 1[2 ft.. surface of face from ear to ear
bale ft., surface of breast from shoulder to shoulder 23% ft., from one
shoulder to the other in a straight line 211/: ft T circumference of the arm
at the elbow 171/2 ft., diameter of the arm between the eihow and shoulder
We ft., length of the index linger 31/5 ft., length of the nail on the middle
finger 7% inches, breadth of ditto 6 inches, breadth of the foot across
the toes, 41/2 ft, The total height seems to have been 571/2 ft., and its
total weight over two million pounds.

The colossal head of another Statue of Ramses II. was found on the
S. side of the temple farther back, and was conveyed to the Nile by
Belzoni in 1816, and thence to Alexandria. It is now one of the chief
treasures in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum. Other fragments
have been brought to light more recently.

The Second Court is entered through a gap in the wall to the
right of the colossus. It is in much better preservation than the
first court, and is mentioned with its osryatidirs in Diodorus’s de-
scription of the tomb of Osymandyas. On all four sides were colon-
nades, those to the right and left (N. and S.; almost wholly de-
stroyed] having two rows of papyrus-bud columns and those on the
front CE.) and back (W.) square pillars with statues of Osiris and
pepyrus-bud columns. The W. colounude is raised on a kind of
terrace.
