HISTORY OF CAIRO. At a very remote period a city lay on the
E. bank of the Nile, opposite the great pyramids, and was called by
the Egyptians Khere-ohe, or 'place of combat', because Horus and Set
were said to have contended here(p. cxx). Tho Greeks named it Bale
ylots, probably in imitation of some Egyptian name of similar sound.
The citadel of this town (p. 71) was fortified by the Romans, and
under Augustus became the headquarters " one of the three legions
stationed in Egypt. In AD. (W) Babylon was captured by 'Amr ibn

el-Vig, the general ot' Khalif 'Omar, who subsequently established
the new capital of the country here, in opposition to Alexandria
(p. ii), which was not so free from the disturbing Christian element.
A mosque was built on the site of the conqueror‘s tent, and the
Arabic word for tent (Foe.t6.tibeoame the name of the new city. The
latter gradually expanded towards the N., and was extended to the
N.E. as far as the base, of the citadel by Armed ibn Tuhin, who
erected the new quarter of et-late':". Ahmed's splendour-loving
son IGumtsrttyth embellished the town with lavish magr1itiesymre.
The modern city of Cairo was founded by thnvar, the general of the
"timite Khalif Mut’zz, after the conquest of Egypt in 969 A.D,
He erected a residence for the Khalif and barracks fur the soldiers
commanded by him to the N. of el-1.Gti'i'. At the hour when the
foundation of the walls was laid, the planet Mars, which the Arabs
call 1.Ghir, or 'the viehorious', crossed the meridian of the new city;
and Mui‘zz accordingly named the place May et-lriylvira, or Ntfhira.
Mss.sr, the ancient Semitic name of Egypt, was also applied to Fast&t,
the form May el-‘Atflcu (Old Chrird) being only introduced at a later
date for the sake of clenrness. The new town extended rapidly.
Bricks were easily made of the Nile mud, the Moknttam hills afforded
excellent stone, while the gigantic ruins of the ancient Memphis
Oil the opposite bank of the river were also used as a quarry. In
973 Mui'zz took up his permanent residence in the new city of
Cairo. In 1166 the citadel which still commands the city was erected
by FaW.reddin Yasufibn Eyyt'sb (Saladin) 0n the slope of the Mo-
hattnm hills; and the same sultan caused the whole town, together
with the citadel itself, to be enclosed by a wall, 29,000 ens in
length Under his luxurious and extravagant successors Cairo was
greatly extended and magnithleatly embellished. At that period,
however, Cairo was fearfully devastated by the plague, as it had
been on two former occasions (in 1067 and 1295), and was also
