[30-40,000l.]. But in spite of all its dilapidation, the huge pro-
portions of the building, combined with the masterly execution of
the details, produce an impression of great majesty.

On leaving this mosque, we proceed to the S.E. (right) to the
circular PLACE Bvsnham (pl. E, 6), from which theMeeca pilgrimage
starts (p.1xv), and to the Médhn Mohammad 'Ali " Place Mé-
Mmet Ali, about 650 yds. in length. From the middle of the 'Place',
opposite the old TslwlinstatioaNare de Iridtm), we enjoy a splendid
*View of the Mosque of Mohammad 'Ali (see below).

From the E. side of the Ruméleh a broad carriage-road, passing
two mosques Cort the left: the thimi'a M-MalrrntU"ayeri, and beyond
it the dei'a Emir Akhtrr, with a decaying minaret), and afford-
ing a view of the Tombs of the Khalifs to the left, ascends in
windings to the Citadel. A shorter and steeper mute , which may
be ascended on donkey-hack, diverges to the right near the be-
ginning of the "Suri-road, passing through the Bdb el-‘Amb,
flanked with its huge towers. It was in this narrow and crooked
lane, enclosed by lofty walls, and formerly the chief approach to
the citadel, that the massacre of the Mamelukes took place on 1st
March, 1811, by order of Mohammed 'Ali (13. mix). Amin Bey,
the only one who survived, effected his escape by making his horse
leap into the moat, through a gap in the wall.

The Citadel Oi2-5ara,' Pl. E, V, B) Was erected in 1166 by
Saladin o. 32) , with stones taken, according to Arabian his-
torians, from the small pyramids at Gizeh. Ofthe original structure,
however, nothing now remains except the outer E. wall afld a few
towers in the interior. Although the fortress commands the city, its
site is unfavourable in respect that it is itself completely com-
manded by the heights of the Molprt.tam, rising above it immed-
iately t0 the S.; thus in 1805 Mohammed rAli was enabled, by
means of a battery planted on the Grebe] (r1yt1shi (11.108), to compel
Khurshid Pasha to surrender the Citadel.

We enter the inner court of the Citadel by the Btu, el-Gedid
(P1. F, fr, 'New Gate’], and observe on a terrace before us the -

Nliunira Mohammed 'Ali (P1. E, 6), the 'Alabaster Mosque', the
lofty and graceful minarets of which are so conspicuous from a-dis-
tauce as to form one of the landmarks of Cairo. The building was
begun by Mohammad 'Ali, the founder of the present Egyptian
dynasty, 011 the site of a palace which was blown up in 1824; and
in 1857 it was completed in its present form by Sa‘id Pasha (ic).
The architect was the Greek Yhuf Boslma of Constantinople, who,
aided by Greek foremen, built it on the model of the Nuri Osmani-
yeh mosque at Constantinople. The columns are built, and the
walls incrusted, with yellow alabaster obtained from the quarries
near Beni.surif.

The Entrance (P1. O), near the centre of the N. side, leads
