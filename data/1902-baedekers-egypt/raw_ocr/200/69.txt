V. TREES AND PLANTATIONS. During the last thirty or forty
years trees have been " extensively planted that Egypt now pre-
sents a more richly wooded appearance than formerly. In ancient
times every square foot of arable land seems to have been exclu-
sively devoted to the cultivation of industrial crops, the natives
preferring to import from foreign countries the timber they required
for ship-building purposes, and probably also the small quantity
employed in the construction of their temples. Mohammed 'Ali,
a great patron of horticulture, at one time offered prizes for the
planting of trees, but his efforts were unattended with success, as
the climatic and other diffieulties attending the task were then bat
imperfectly understood in Egypt. Ibréhim followed the example of
his predecessor, but Abbis I. and Sa'id were sworn enemies to trees
of every kind, and they were content that their palaces should be
exposed to the full glare, of the sun. The Khedive Isma'il, however,
at length revived the plans of his celebrated ancestor, and by the
engagement of M. Barillet (1869], superintendent of the gardens
of Paris, one of the most skilful 1aru1seape-grmteriers of the day,
introduced an entirely new feature into Egyptian scenery The finest
of the shade-trees, both on account of its umbrageousness and the
excellence of its wood, and one which thrives admirably, is the
lebbck(A1bizzia Lebbek), which has long been erroneously called by
travellers the acacia of the Nile [the latter being properly the gun!
tree). Within forty years the lebbek attains a height of 80 ft. and
a great thickness, while the branches project to a long distance over
the roads, covering them with a dense leafy canopy within a remark-
ably short time. Among the most important of the other kinds of
trees thus planted are the msrgnifteent 'Pltrmboyer des Indo' (Poin-
ciene puhoherrimaJ, the rapidly-growing Eucalyptus, tropical fig-
trees, and several rare varieties of palms.

The commonest TREES OF AN EARLIER PERIOD which the trav-
eller will encounter in every town in Egypt are the following: -
The Acacia Nilotica (shut), the thorn-tree of antiquity, the pods
(karat!) of Which, resembling rosaries, yield an excellent material
for tanning purposes. Next to the palm, this is the tree most fre-
