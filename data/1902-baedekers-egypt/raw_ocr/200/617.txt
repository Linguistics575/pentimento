After skirting the bushy river-bank for 1/4 hr. we reach the
S. Muxrmax'rs, offering a picturesque appearance as seen from the
Nile, The chief of these are two Recesses ahout (l ft. deep, which lie
close beside each other. The arehitraves over the entrances are
adorned with concave cornices and urleus-serpents and are borne by
clustered columns. That to the N. (right) was erected by Meren-

to Harmaehis, Ptah, and a Nile-god (on the right), and to Amman,
Mat, and Khons (on the left). Beneath is a long hymn to the Nile
and lists of' offerings to be made to the river-god. On each of the
narrow side-walls are injured reliefs of the king saeriticing to the
gods. - The scenes in the S. recess are repetitions of these, except
that Merenptah is replaced hyPrsrasesH., who Constructed the recess
in the first year of his reign. - On the rock between these recesses
is a door-shaped Stale, on which King Merenptah is shown present-

and much ruined recess, dating from the reign of Sethus J, 0n the
river-bank are traces of an ancient flight of steps descending to
the stream.

The largest QuintetÂ». worked especially under the New Empire,

stones by the Nile for a temple of Ptah. There are two Posts of the
time of 1ietl1os L, Demotic Inscriptions from Roman times and an
unfinished colossal Sphinx (near the river-bank). - At the N. end
of the quarries are found the scanty ruins ofthe ancient town Khenu
and its temple (fragmentary insrriptions of Ramses IL). To the
Th, townrvls the top of the roek, is a stele of Amenophis ly, record-
