the world, and gave its name of ‘Pharns' to all h' hthouaea afterwards
erected. Its original height is said to have been E100 ells (590 ft.), and
though even in antiquity it threatened more than once to collapse, part
of the ancient tower still stood erect alter the great earthquakes of 1303
yu1..!r6: This was overwhelmed by the sea :tlittle later, and the present
fortifications ('eort tin Phare' or 'Fort Kiit-Bey') were erected near its
site_1n the 15|h century. The Freptttstadium, a vast embankment seven
stadm (1400 yds.) in length, as its name imports, was constructed by
Ptolemy e'oter, or his son Philadelphns. It was pierced by two passages,
bridged LiverV and before Cwsar's time served also as an aqueduct. Having
since that period been artificially enlarged by déhris from the ancient city,
thrown into the sen, as well as by natural deposits, it has attained at
width of more than [OOO yds , and new forms the site of a great part of
the modern city.

Among the PmNcuuL QUAmrms of the ancient city Strabo partic-
ularly mentions the Weeropolie or city of the dead, at the extreme W.
end, 'where there are many gardens, tombs, and establishments for ent-
balmiag bodies'; Rhalmtis, 'the quarter of Alexandria situated above the
ships‘ magazines", chiefly inhabited hy Egyptians (comp. p. 8); the Royal
City (Begia; afterwards called Brucht'um), which was auhsequently walled
In, and contained the palaces and public buildings, on the mainland
between the Loehias and the Heptsstadiam; the Jovi Quarter, situated
to the E. of the Lochias. Outside the Canopic gate, on the F.., lay the
hippodrome, and farther to the E, Wits the suburb of Nimpotis (p. 18),
30 stedia from Alexandria, which possessed an amphitheatre and a race-
course.

The town was regularly built, with street; intcrseetiag each other
at right angles. The main artery of traflie seems to have been the long
street beginning at the Canopic gate (comp. p. 15).

or the Pluxcnux. Bmuuxes of ancient Alexandria the scanty relies
of only a few can beidentifurdfp.t2). The Paneum is doubtless identical
with the modern K6m ed-Dik (p. 15). The Gymnasium probably lay to
the W. of this point.

The theatre, the Same, and the Museum were situated in the 'Royal
City' (see above), which Originally occupied a Mets and afterwards a fourth
or even a third part of the whole extent of the city. The Alexru1drian
Theatre lay opposite the island of Aatirvhodus, so that the spectators
had a view of the sea in the hackgmund. The Sema was an enclosed
space, within which were the tumhs of Alexander the Great and of the
Ptolemies. Adjoining the tomb of Queen Cleopatra stood a temple 0f1»is,
remains of which have hem discovered at the intersection uf the Rue
Nabi Daniel and the Rue de rH6pital Grec. This discovery should go far
to settle the site of the eagerly-sought tomb of Alexander.

The Museum probably stood on a site to the E. of the church of St.
Athanasius. According to Strabo, it contained 'a hall for walktng, nu-
other for sitting, and a large building with the refeistory of the Scholars
residing at the Mnaemu.’ Connected with the Museum wag the famous
Alexandria» Librurt 7 which contained 400,000 scrolls as early as the reign
of Ptolemy U. Philadelpht1s, while in Caesar time, when it Was burned,
the number had risen to about 900,000. The library lay to the N. of the
Museum, near the harbour. Besides the revenues enjoyed by the Museum
in its corporate capacity, a yearly salary was paid to each of the members,
whose number in the time of the first Ptolemies has been estimated at
one hundred at least.

The site of the Serepeum, or great temple of Sorapis, may be approxi-
mately determined by the fact that Pompey's Pillar (p. 12) stand in the
midst of it. The god to whom it was dedicated Was introduced by the
Ptolemies. and the temple is said to have been surpassed in grandeur by
no other building in the World except the Roman Capitol.
