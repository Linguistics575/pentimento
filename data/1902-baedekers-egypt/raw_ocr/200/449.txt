the Mudiriyeh. The linen-manufecture for which this place was
celebrated in the middle ages has greatly declined, but there are
several sugar-plantations and a small bazaar. To the left of the
railway is a fine grove of palms.

0n the right bank of the Bahr Y6suf, 10 M. to the W. of Beniguéf,
lies the village of Rmusasigels el-Medineh trulgo, Ilenassfyeh 17mm elturutn,
'rubbish-heaps of Henassiyeh‘), beside the mounds of debris, covering
an area of 1,2 sq. M., which mark the site of the ancient Beratr1isirptr1is.
The Egyptian name of the town was Hmmsetm, from which are derived
the Coptic Hus, and the Arabic Ahmia and Hemmiyeh. It was the ca ital
of a name (the Graseo-ltornan Heracleopolites) and the chief seat 0 the
worship of the mm-headed god Hershef, identiiied by the Greeks with
Heracles (whence the name of the town). The ichneumon else was re.
vered here. Among its chief shrines was a temple erected under the Middle
Empire and a new building by Ramses IL, but all have practically ven-
ished; and four columns of a late periud, Erobably dating from a Byzantine
church, are all that projects above the rn hish-heaps. The ancient neon»
polislies on the W. side of the Bal.orY0suf.

Another road, traversing the Wadi Baytid, which opens near the vil.
lnge of Baytid, on the E. bank of the Nile, opposite Beuieuéf, leads through
the desert to the Cements of BS. Anthony and Paul (p. xxxix), a few leagues
from the Bed Sea.

As far as Miuyeh the space between the E. bank and the hills
remains narrow, the limestone rocks frequently abutting on the river
in unbroken walls or rounded bluffs. Few villages are seen on this
bank, but the fertile alluvial tract on the W. aide, 10-1211. in width,
is thickly populated and carefully cultivated, exhibiting in profusion
all the cereals that grow on the Nile, date-palms, and 8uglrr-eMie.
The sugar-t‘actories, which are a monopoly of the Khedive, follow
each other in rapid succession. They are connected by the railway,
and short branch-lines, used in l1awest-time only, run from them
to the plantations lying farther to the W. Their lofty brick and iron
chimneys impart a very moderu-industrial air to the ancient land
of the Pharaohs. Large barges with sugar-canes or with fellahin
'faetory-hands' are met on the river. The juice is expressed from
the cane and then retined by being boiled twice in closed vessels.

The boat passes several large islands. On the W. bank lie Ba-
mnka and Bibeh [Bebe el-Kobra, p. 189), with large sagar-faetories.
The channel new contracts, and numerous islets are passed. 95 M.
Feelin CFaelini rail. stat, p.189), on the W.bank, is Ili', M. from the
river. Near the village of El-Hiheh (Et-Hebah)7 on the E. bank,
about 21/2 M. farther up, are the ruins of an ancient town, Cpotl-
jectured to be Het-bmu (ppasnix-oastle'J, the capital of a province.

The Town Walls. which are in good preservation, were restored under
the 21st Dyn.. as is proved by numerous bricks stamped with the names
of Princess Esl-em»kheb and her husband Men-kheper-ri, or of their son
Pt'notem (11.), high-priest of Ammon. - Ruins of a temple, built by
Sheshnnk l. and Osorkun I. (22nd Dyn.), have also been discovered here.

On the E. bank rises the Gebel Shékh Embdrak.

1081/2 M. Maghigha (post and telegraph oftiee at the rail. stat.,
p. 189), on the W. batik, with a large sugar-fairy, which pas-
eengers by C'ook's. tourist steamers are permitted to inspect.
