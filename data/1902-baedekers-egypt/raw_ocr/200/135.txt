a picture of the life of the ancient Egyptians. Under the ancient
empire the grandees alone were allowed to build themselves tomhs,
and that probably only by favour of the king. The ordinary citizens
had to content themselves with simple graves in which the ne-
cessaries for the future life were buried with the bodies. But at a
later period even the lower ranks of suoiety huilt 'everlasting houses'
for themselves, at least so far as they possessed the means to do so.
The dead were under the protection of the local deities, and in some
instances also under special gods of the dead. Thus at Memphis
Sultan's was the god of the dead and provided for their support, while
these functions were discharged at Assitit. hy Wep-wat and at Ahydos
by the 'Lord of the West'. But even at an early date these local gods
retired in favour of Osiris, who was originally the local deity of
Busiris in the Delta, where he ruled the dead in the fruitful fields.
The death which Osiris suffered awording to the legend (p. cxx)
was the common lot of mortals; hut just as Osiris rose again, so a
man also could begin a new life, provided that the same formula,
were pronounced for him by some faithful son; he went to Osiris,
became united with the slain god, in fact was himself Osiris. Ad-
mission to the realm of Osiris depended upon the recitation of
magical formulas and ineantations, a knowledge of which mast he
communicated to the deceased. At the same time a virtuous life
upon earth was required to assure the deceased eternal happiness,
and he had therefore to undergo l trial before Osiris and to prove
before forty-two Judges that he was free from mortal sin. Before
this took place, and hefore his heart had heen weighed hy Thout
in the scales of righteousness and found perfect, he might not enter
the future land. Opinions differed as to the place of abode of the
blessed dead. Their dwelling was usually located in the West, among
the mountains, and in the desert where the sun set. Some believed
that they inhabited the fertile fields of Earu, a fruitful country
where ploughing and reaping were carried on as upon earth, and
where the corn grew to the height of seven ells, forming a veritable
paradise for the Egyptian peasant. As the labour in this future land
might often be too great for the strength of the deceased, it hecame
the custom at the period of the Middle Empire to place Ushabtis in
the tomb along with him. These were little figures of men, which
were imbued with life by a magic spell written upon them, and
assisted the deceased in his labours.

Auoth er doctrine sought to unite the different conceptions of the
future life and placed the abodes of the blessed in Twat, the under-
world. This was the country through which the sun passed at night. It
was believed to lie under the earth, to be roofed like the earth by a
sky, and to be traversed by a river. It was divided into twelve parts,
corresponding to the twelve hours of night, and, according to a

certain view, separated trom each other by massive doors (comp.
