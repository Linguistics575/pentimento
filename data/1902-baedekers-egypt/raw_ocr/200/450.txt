Thrice 1t month a earr1el-post leaves hraghtgl1s for (34 days) the 'Small
Oasis' of Bubrfyeh, also called Oasis of Bkhmsu, because it is connected
with Behnesa. by another desert-route (comp. p. 190).

The Nile-channel is very wide here (several islands); farther on
both banks are flat. - At (113 M.) Sharéna (Charounah; E. bank)
are tombs of the end of the 6th Dynasty. Near Kbm el-Alimar, to
the 8., are the ruins of a large temple built by Ptolemy L, and
tombs of a late period, belonging to the town of Het-seteni, in the
Cynopolitan nome. - 118 M. Bent Mazar (W. bank) is a railway-
station (p.189). - About 3 M. farther up, close to the B. bank, are
the iusignimumt remains of Shékh eI- Fadhl, near which is 'iii'-"
mama. The discovery of a large number of dog-mummies here
proves that we are standing on the site of the necropolis of Cytso-
polia, the ‘city of the dogs'. Several trough-like bollows and clefts
have been found here, some of which, in the rocks, are of Tlou-
siderable size; but no inscriptions have been discovered. Cynopolis
itself, in which Anubis was worshipped and dogs were held sacred,
lay, according to Ptolemy, on an island in the Nile.

Opposite, 11/4 M.from the W. bank, lies El-Keis, the Egyptian
Kdis, Which superseded Cynopolis. Farther to the W. ., 011 the verge
of the Libyan desert, lies Behnesa (p.189).

Near [1331/2 M .) 'ir2LUi"iivTirtrdsci',. rail. stat., p.190), on the
W. bank, the Nile divides into three arms, forming two considerable
islands. Opposite (E. bank) lies Surariyeh (el-Seririeh). To the N.
and S. quarries are worked in the limestone rock. Among the
quarries is a small Rock Chapel, built under Merenptah and dedi-
cated to Hathor. 0n the external wall is Ramses III. between Hathor
and another deity.

0n the W. bank lies the railway-station ofSamallzlt (p. 190). A
little farther to the s., at the mouth of a side-valley on the E.
bank, rise the steep rocky sides of the Gebe] e.t-Tibr (‘bird-moun-
tain'), with an extensive flat top bearing the Coptic convent IAr
er-Bukra, also known as Dir el-Udra (convent of the Virgin).
Visitors are drawn up a vertical e,left in the rock by means ofa
Windlass (bukra). The convent, which consists of a group of miser-
able huts, occupied not only by the monks but by laymen with
their wives and children, is surrounded by a wall of hewn stone,
erected in the Roman period. The foundation of the church is
ascribed to the Empress Helen; the sanctuary is hewn in the solid
rock and possesses a gate, now half-buried, adorned with Byzan-
tine ornamentation.

A legend, recorded by Mahx-izi. relates that on the Saint‘s day of the
convent all the hukir birds in the neighbourhood assembled here and thrust
their heads, one after the other, into the cleft of the rock until one died.

These birds are described as being black and white, with a black neck
ringed near the head. The convent is named also per 6FBvkir after them.

On the E. bank, about hu. farther on and 1 M. from the river,
lies the village of Tehneh e.r-TaMUus (Tehnell of the mio'), with
two groups of ancient tombs.
