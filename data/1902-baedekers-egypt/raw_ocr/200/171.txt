' BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS.

hewn stone was used for portions of the editiwa; the mosque of El-
Abrnar, built in 1125, showed the first example of a stone faeade
embellished with stalaetites. The portals began to he placed in
recesses, and small trupolas made their appearance in the interior
of the mosques. The pointed arch, introduced in the mosque of
11m Tultlu, gave place to the Persian 'keel'-ara. Towards the
close of this period forms began to be adopted, especially in mili-
tary architecture. that seem to have been copied from the build-
ings of the Crusaders in Syria and Palestine. The leading character-
istic ofthe EYYUBIDB Pmuouwas the introduction of the ground-plan
of the Persian medreseh, which superseded the previously used
ground-plan of the courts until the first Mameluke period. Large
domes began to be built over the mausolee, which as founders'
tombs were placed near the sanctuaries of the mosques.

To the FIRST MAMELUKE DYNASTY we owe a number of huge
editiees, with ground-plans in both the above-mentioned styles and
exhibiting, especially in the fagades, the influence of the archi-
teeture of the Crusaders. Most of these structures date from the
reigns of Bihars and KMit1n, the latter of whom raised the first
minaret of stone. Under NÃ©eir endeavours began to be made to
design facades independent of foreign influence.

Under the SECOND MAMELVJKE DYNASTY the mosgue-fayule at-
tained its zenith, and from this period date the most elegant
achievements of Arabic architecture in Egypt. The faeades now
assumed a more homogeneous character; the minarets, of enhanced
elegance ever sinee the days of Kaltt'sn, reached their highest de-
velopment; the domes, now also built of stone [see below), were
richly adorned with sculpture; and the walls, ceilings, pavements,
and even domestic furniture were sumptuously embellished with
mosaics, panels, carvings, and stalaetites. The first dome built of
stone was that of the mosque of Barlstit (p. 65).

The use of written characters has played a prominent part in
the decoration of Arabic buildings at all times, and the art did not
deteriorate in the latest period. Under the Iulunides the closely
written Clufie character was employed, while under the Ftrtimites
and, still more, under the Eyyubides, the letters became taller and
more slender. The letters themselves and the spaces between them
were embellished with arabesque ornamentation. In the later IT-
riods the currive character known as Neskhi was used also; and the
t'riezes of intertwined letters dating from the period of the Mame-
Iukes frequently rise to the dignity of works of art.

We may now proceed to an examination of the special kinds of
buildings, beginning with the mosques.

Mosques are of two kinds, the thimiU, lit. an assembly for
prayer, and Meeyid, the place on which the knee is bent for prayer.
The oldest mosques are very simple in p1an(eomp. the plan " the
mosque of Ibn Tultm, p. 53). Around a quadrilateral court (Sum),
