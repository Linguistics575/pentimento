Ch, ihe ruck ulmve is " memorial inscripliml of the quarry-mastor:
Hm nmstcr-huildur in the temple ‘Ramsux N. shines in the House of Me
heat' (Heliupulis) Matt, son nf Bek-en-Aom, master-buiidcr ot' Thebes'.

Ou the E. side of the Pyramid are remains of the temple once
connected with it (p. 120). We follow the W. side of the Pyramid.
On the rock to the right is another hieroglyphic inscription (P1. f)
by the above-mentioned Mu'i, near which are several roek-toinbs,
One ofthese (Pl. " that of Neb-ent-peMtvel, nearly opposite the
SW. angle of the Pyramid, has a fine ceiling hewn in the rock in
imitation ofpalm-stems. (Visitors should beware of the tornb-shatt.)

Our route now leads towards the S.W. to the Third Pyramid
(p. 122). To the S. of it stand three small Pyramids, perhaps
belonging to relatives of King Meukewre

We leave the remains of the-temple (p. 122) belonging to the
Third Pyramid 011 the left, and descend towards the E. by the ancient
roadfp.114), which is distinctly traceable. Here, 011 the lel't, is
another series of rook-tombs dating from the 4th and 5th Dynasties.
Among these is that of Tebelmi (Pl. h,- beware of the mummy-
shat'ts), with several chambers and recesses. 0n the wall of the
second chamber, to the right as we enter,is a representation of dancers
at the funeral (can ile necessary).

In the valley before us, to the right, rises a projecting ridge of
rock containing tombs of nu interest. Adjoining this rock, 011 the
left, are three sycamores aml two date-palms, rising above an Arab-
ian burial-plaoe. Still farther to the E. we observe the remains of
rv wall (perhaps the ancient town-wail), with a gateway. To the loft
of the trees rises a high mound of debris, consisting partly ol the
natural rock and partly of masonry7 and supposed to be the remains
of the Pyramid of King Telf-RF, the successor ofMycerinos. Passing
through it, we come to other tombs on the left, also covered with
sand. Among these is the tomb of Wer-khewu (P1. Jc), ajudge under
the 5th Dynasty.

We now proceml to the iei't (N.) to Campbell’s Tomb, a family
tomb of the 26th Dyn., discovered by Uol. Vyse in 1837, and named
by him after Col. Campbell, the British oousul-geueral of Egypt at
that period. The upper part, the magtaha proper, has been entirely
destroyed, and the shaft (53 ft. deep), at the bottom ofwhinh is
a tomb-tyhamber vaulted with an arch having, a span ofil ft., isuow
uncovered. The sides of the sha ft are separated from the surround-
ing rock by a trench, which is spanned by bridges of stone at only a
few points. The sarcophagus which lay in the tomb- chamber
contained the remains of the royal scribe Pe-bop Wah-eh-re-em-
yekhwet, a contemporary of King Apries. It is now covered with
sand, but one of the Beduins usually offers to descend and lay it
bare. Beside the sarcophagus lies a stoneiid shaped like a mummy.
" niches in the Sand W. sides ofthe shaft are two other sarcophagi;
and a fourth sareophagus found here is now in the British Museum.
All these sarcophagi had been opened and plundered.
