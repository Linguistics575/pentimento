H Ilorrte 2. ALEXANDRIA. Palme Rds et-Tin.

We now enter the SEPCLCHEAL CHAPEL (P1. K). The sarcophngi
containing the remains stand in niches (P1. s-eo and are hewn, like
their lids, out of the snlid rock. The fronts are adorne’l7 after the
Greek fashion, with festomls, masks, heads of Medusa, bucrania,
and bunches of grapes. On the middle one is a reclining figure of
the deceased. The walls of the niches are decorated with Egyptian
reprecentations of religious import.

CENTRAL N(CHE (a). Rear Wall: On a bier supported by lions' feet
rests the mummy, surrounded by Horus, Thoth, and Anubis, the three
guds of the lower world; below the bier are three canopic vases. Left
Walt: A priest of the dead, wearing a panther-skin, rea’ls from It ml];
gor1r1szses "cpiilce in front of an altar. [Eight Wall: similar scene. - RIGHT
NICHE (b). Reap Wall: King s'aerril1eing an Apis ball, with a winged gor
dess, with a feather, in the background. Left Wall: Royal srerifirpe to
Osiris. Right Wall: Two gods with long staves. - The representations in
the LEFT NICHE (c) are similar. - To the right, and left of the door are
representations of the jartktu-heatler1 Anubis and the crow diIe-headed Sob1r,
each with the armour, shield, and lance of a Roman soldier.

Round the sepulchrel chapel runs a GALLERY (L), entered from
the vestibule, with two rows of she1f-t0mbs CWI in all). Each of
these contained at least three mummies. The names and ages of the
deceased7 in red paint, are still visible on some of the slabs.-- Ad-
Joining the cnnidor are four LATEIL ROOMS (N-O), with shelf-toral;
and snrcophagus-niches. At the back of the corridor is a Sumo-
PHAGUS CHAMBER (Pl. M), with three tomb-niches and plain pillars.
We leave the buria1-plsure here by a breach in the wall.

Farther to the W. lie some other previously known tombs, of less
interest.

The main portion of the Arab quarter lies on the ancient Hepta-
stadium (p. 9), between the, E. and the W. harbours. Its chief
thoroughfare is the RUE 1m FRANCE, with its prolongations the Rue
Masguid Terbana and Rue Ris et-Tin (Pl. E, 3), Which begins at
the NW. earner of the Place Méhémet Ali (p. il). The Arab quarter
is adjoinerl by the Turkish quarter CPI. D, E, 2), on what was
formerly the island of Pharos o. 8), with less narrow streets and
handsome houses and gardens. Both these quarters present interest-
ing scenes of Oriental life. The Rue Ris et-Tin ends at the vice-
regal -

Palace of RM et-Tin (Pl. A, B, 3), a name signifying 'pro-
montnry of figs'. The palace, \xhich was built by Mohammad 'Ali
and restored by Isma’il, is uninteresting. The balcony, however,
commands a fine view of the extensive harbour. (Admission by
ticket procured at the consulate.) The Harem, a. separate building,
facing the sea, is built on the model of the seraglio at Constantin-
ople. - A visit to the neighbouring Lighthouse (Pl. A, 4) is inter-
esting, especially in the early morning, but admission is granted
only to those provided with an order to be obtained through the
consulate. - The Naval Arsenal (P1. c, D, 3) is not worth visiting.

The RUE ma LA Penna DE Rosm’m (Pl. F-I, 4), leading to the
E. tram the centre ot' the city. is another important thoroughfare.
