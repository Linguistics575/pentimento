DOCTRINES OF EL-ISLAM. m

the promised Paraclete, the Comforter (St. John xiv, 16), the last
and greatest of the prophets; but he does not profess to be entirely
free from minor sins. He Gorifirms previous revelations, but his
appearance has superseded them. His whole doctrine is a miraele,
and it therefore does not require to be ooufirmed by special miracles.
After his death, however, a number of miracles were attributed to
him, and a position was assigned to him as the principal mediator
between God and man. The apotheosis of human beings is, more-
over, an idea foreign to the Semitic mind, and it was the Persians
who first elevated 'Ali and the imims (literally reciters of prayers)
who succeeded him to the rank of supernatural beings.

The KORAN itself was early believed to he of entirely super-
natural origin. The name signifies 'rehearsal', or 'reading', and
the book is divided into chapters called 80reli8. C 'he firgt revelation
vouoluuded to the Prophet took place in the 'blessed aight' in the
year 609. With many interruptions, the 'sending dowu' of the
Koran extended over tweuty-three years, until the whole book,
which had already existed on 'well-preserved taNes' in heaven7
was in the prophet's possession. During the time of the Abbaside
khalifs it wasa 1n atter of the keenest controversy whether the Koran
was created or uncreated. (The Oriental Christians have likewise
always manifested a great taste for subtle dogmatic questions, such
as the Procession 0f the Holy Ghost.) The earlier, or Meccau St"1rehs,
which on account of their brevity are placed at the end of the book,
are characterised by great freshness and vigour of style. They ateiu
rhyme, but only partially poetic in form. In the longer Siirehs ofa
later period the style is more studied and the narrative often
tedious. The Koran is nevertheless regarded as the masterpiece of
Arabic literature. Theprayers of the Muslims consist almost exclus-
ively " passages from it, although they are ignorant of its real
meaning. Even by the early commentators much of the Koran was
imperfectly understood, for Mohammad, although extremely proud
of his Arabio Book', was very partial to the use of all kinds of
foreign words‘ The translation of the Koren beingprohibited, Pers-
ian, Turkish, and Indian children learn it entirely by rote.

The Karin has been translated into English, French, German, Italian,
and Latin. The best English translations are those of Sale [1734; with
.1 ‘preliminary discourse‘ and copious notes), ed, by Rev. E.M. Wherry,
1882-36, 'vols., and also published in a cheap form by Messrs Wame a (10.,
London); Radwell (London, 1861 g2nd ed., 1878]; and Palmer (London, 1880).

resurrection has been grossly corrupted by the Koran and by sub-
sequeut tradition; but its main features have doubtless been bor-
rowed from the Christians, as has also the appearance of Antisrhrist,
and the part to be played by Christ at the Last Day. On that day
Christ will establish El-Islam as the religion of the world. With
him will Ie-appear El-Mahdi, the twelfth Imim (p. 1xxiij, and
