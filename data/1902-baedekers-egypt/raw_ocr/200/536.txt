Between this temple of Pteh and the great hypostyle hall of the
temple of Ammon are the remains of three small Chapels of the Late
Period, all entered from the E.

The southernmost and largest was built towerda the close of the
26th Dyn. by the majordomo Peteneit. In the doorway we see Peemme-
tikh III. and the Queen Enkh-nes-rusfer-isb-riq saiwuieirtg to Amman and
other gods. Beyond is a hall built orbrielr, with four stone columns. To
the right of the entrance to the Sanctuary is Nitoeris, wife of Psemme-
tikh IL, to the left is Amasis. - The central chapel was erected by an
otherwise unknown Sheshenk in the reign of Amasis, who is repreiented
on theleft jamb of the trt11vanee-doov. On the right jamh i5 Queen Enkh-
niss-rtefer-isb-re, to whose household Sheshonk belonged. The walls of this
temple are of brick, with the exception of the sanctuary, Which is of stone.
- The N. chapel, the oldest, was built in the reign of Taherka (25th Dyn.),
who, along with the princess Shepenwepet, appears on the walls,

d. THE Soumenx BUILDINGS.

Situated to the S. of Ramses Il.’s girdle-wall (p. 255) is the
Sacred Lake, named by the Arabs Birket el-jlftrtZlia or Lake of the
Bait Pit, as the water has become saline and unthinkable through
'1nflltration. The banks were anciently faced with hewn stones, and
traces of these are still to be seen on the W., S., and especially on
the N. side.

Between this lake and the girdle-Wall are it few haif-vuined chambers.
partly constructed of alabaster. The ruins nearest the lake date from the
reign of Thutmesis IIT., these immediately adjoining the temple-wall from
the reign of the Ethiopian Taharka.

We now proceed to visit the Connecting Buildings between the
Temple of Ammon and the Temple of Mut, which were begun by
Queen Makeré but were probably no vex completed. Quitting the Gm-
tral Court of the Temple of Ammon, we enter a court enclosed on
two sides by wells and on the rear by Pylon VIL, all of which are
in rains. On the exterior of the w. wall was inscribed the famous
treaty made by Ramses II. with the Hittites (p. 252). On the E. wall
is a long inscription (P1. 11), describing the contests of King Meran-
ptah with the Libyans and the peoples of the Mediterranean (Etrus-
cans, Achmens, etc.); and farther on is a triumphel relief (Pl. b) of
Merenptah in the presence of Ammon grasping a group of enemies
by the hair and smiting them with his club.

Pylon WI was built by Thutmosis Ill, whose victories are eel-
ehrated on both sides of it. In front of the S. side are the remains
of two colossal statues of Thutmosis IIT., in red granite.

Beside the easternmost of the two walls which unite Pylon VII
with Pylon VIII lies (to the left) a small Chapel, dating from the
reign ufThutmosis 111. Round the Sanctuary runs a gallery supported
by pillars connected with each other by balustrades. Farther on, on
the same wall, is a representation (Pl. e) of Ramses II. sacrificing.

Pylon VIII is in comparatively good preservation, although it
was built by Queen Mekeré, and is thus the most ancient part of the
entire building. Makeré’s names were removed from the reliefs by
