still less in Upper Egypt. The change of the wind to the N.W. or W.
is abrupt, with cool weather for frequently 10-20 days before another
Khamsin blows. The effect is stimulating to the individual. The
name 'kharnsin' is also applied by Europeans, though erroneously,
to a similar but much more gentle wind in winter. About 50 per
cent of the days of the year are calm [i.e. windless) in the Libyan
Desert; and these calms extend in winter to Upper Egypt also, less
often to Lower Egypt-The ir1t111enee of the R. or Arabian Desert
and the Red Sea upon the climate of the Nile valley is very slight.

In addition to the Mediterranean Sea and the Libyan Desert a
third factor inf1ueneiug the climate of Egypt is found in the extent
of cultivated land. Alexandria, owing to the prevailing winds, is
under the inituenee of both sea. and desert in winter, but from May
to October under that of the sea alone. Cairo, at the apex of the
Delta, is partly affected by the desert in winter, but from May to
October it is wholly under the inf1uenoe of the Delta and its cultivated
land. Upper Egypt is much less affected by this third factor than
Lower Egypt, for the bends of the Nile valley and the very limited
cultivation permit the N. and N.W. winds to pass over large tracts
of desert before it reaches Upper Egypt.

The mean TEMPERATURE in winter at Cairo and in the greater
part of the Deltais 56°Fahr. ; the temperatureis lowestin the latter
half of Jan., being then about that of London or Berlin at the end
ofSeptember. In spring the mean is 78", in summer 83° (maximum
95°, or during the Khamsiu 115"], in autumn 6iP. Alexandria is
more ini1uentyeil by the sea, and it is therefore warmer in winter
and eonler in summer than Cairo. The mean winter temperature is
MP (minimum M"). In Upper Egypt, where the desert climate
prevails almost exclusively, the mean winter temperature is 66”
(minimum 37°), and in summer the heat sometimes rises to 1220
in the shade. Throughout the Whole of Egypt the temperature
reaches the minimum Just before sunrise, when it is very cold, rises
quickly until It a. m., then more slowly till it touches the max-
imum " 2 or 3 p. 111., after which it gradually falls again. There
is 110 sudden fall of temperature at sunset, except in the cultivated
land. The temperature at night is considerably affected by vege-
tation. Observations made with automatic recording instruments in
the neighbourhood of Cairo and at Luxor have demonstrated that
when the crops are high the nocturnal temperature sinks much lower
in the cultivated land than in the towns or in the desert.

The temperatures mentioned above will probably seem high to
any Northern traveller; but as a matter of fact they are not felt to
be oppressive owing to the great DBYNESS of the Egyptian climate,
which has a drying power thrice as great as that of the Mr in the
Engadine and thus rapidly absorbs all moisture generated at the
surface of the body. Rain is a rare phenomenon in Upper Egypt.
Even at Cairo the clouds are seldom condensed into a continuous
