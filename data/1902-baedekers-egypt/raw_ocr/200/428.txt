sacred [0 Sobk, and the Greeks thcrcfurc named the city C'vocodt'Jopotis,
or 'eroeot1i1iy-iowu'. It never attained to any political importance. Ptol-
emy II. Philadelphus seems to have converted it into an essentially
Hellenic city by adding new quarters, founding Greek temples and educat-
tional institutions, and introducing the Greek language. This monarch
also raised Queen Arsinn'é to the dignity ofpatvon-goddess, and the district
became known as the 'ArsinoirittNome', and the capital " the 'City of
the dwellers in the Areinoitic Nome', or, mnre briefly, as Aru‘noi At the,
time of its greatest prosperity it had over 100,000 inhabitants.

For 11 visit to the ruins, We.proceed due N. from the mosque of
1.Git Bey, following the trodden path through the extensive modern buriale
place The eanbanJrrmwte, like ramparts, to the right and left, are re-
mains of Saltpetre Pam, such as were formerly used to extract the sehakh-
salts from the ruhhish-heaps of ruined towns. To the N. of that on the
left lies a. mound of rubbish known us K671; eHK/yarydvm, the highest part
of which. es-MPa. encloses the ruins of some large building. During the
Inst twenty years important discoveries have repeatedly been made here of
pepyri, most of which are now in the Arrhduke Rainer'e collection in
Vienna, while others are in the museums of Berlin and other towns. MoSt
of the prpyri are Greek business documents (records, ceeeipts, letters, etc.),
but some literary specimens have also been found, containing fragments
from Homer Euripides, Thucydidee, etc. Others are written in Coptic,
Persian, Syriac, or Arabic.

Beyond the trailway-embankment, to the left, we now see the highest
mound. the E6m Fdr'is (65 ft.), the top of which commands e survey of
the whole of the Ifayr1m. To the right [W.] are the black mound known
as K6m ms-Nsimshi, and the long Kom et~Tmyairm Where papyri have also
been discovered. More to the N., on the W, verge ot the ruins, rises the
Krim el-‘Aquimeh ('borurrnoand0, Which Wits used in the 5-Eth cent, after
Christ as the burial-plate of the poorer inhabitants. In the tombs here
numerous toys, well-preserved textile fabrics, etc.. have been found.

We follow the path to the N. and presently thu1 nurselves in a section
of the ruins, which, in Dr. Sehweiararth's word, 'to this day pvodaces
the impression of a city but recently destroyed. The walls of the houses
still stand fan- and wide, but the narrow interlacing lanes, bewildering
in their riunitieatioils and interrupted by countless trenches and holes in
the ground, render it impwesihle to obtain any clear idea of the general
plan'. Un the extreme N. edge of the ruins, partly projecting into the
cultivated land, we may detect traces of the ancient principal temple,
which was dedicated to Sobk. This existed as early as the 12th Dyu.,
and was afterwards rebuilt by Ramses 11. Within the rectangular girdle-
wall, Which was built of eun-dried bricks, lie fragments of an architmve
of red granite and isolated blocks of limestone hearing the names of
Ramses u. and other kings. Most of the temple, however. was removed
by the later inhabitants and incorporated in new buildings. Beside the
temple lay originally the sacred pond in which the crocodile of Sohk
was kept.

We now turn to the W. and reach the Balm Tina Canal, on which
are several water-wheels. The large mounds of rubbish at the village of
2Yertshtyet'Abdallah probably also belonged to the ancient city. We return
southwards, skirting the canal and the edge of the cultivated groundt To
the right rises the large mound of Kdm eerulllfyeh ('mound of the Nile
earp0, on the 3. side of which are the walls of an apparently fortriiei1
building, probably dating from the Arab perind. Farther to the s. are
the Kom et-Taydm (see above), and the abosurmentioned Saltpetra Pans,
