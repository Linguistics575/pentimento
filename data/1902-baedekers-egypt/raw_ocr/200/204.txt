I. Approaches to Egypt.

The timc-tahles and handbooks of the various steamship companies
(see below) give full information both as to the direct searrontes from
England and as to the steamers from Mediterranean ports. Particulars
of. the overland routes (see p. 2) from England to the Mediterranean
will be found in Bradshaw‘x Cantinemal Railway Guide (2s0, the advertise-
ment pages ofwhich also contain some shipping information. The W. d: o.'
Co. issues tickets for the seafroute out and the ovcriand route home, or
m'ce esrsd. Heavy baggage should in all cases, if possible, be sent round
by steamer. - Travellers from the United States may sail direct from
New York to Naples " Genoa by German steamer (fivst-eUss only) and
proceed thence by one of the steamers mentioned at pp. Ti,

Travellers whn desire to return from Egypt by one of the larger mail
lines should secure a berth as soon as possible by applying to the ship-
ping ofihus in Cairo (p. 26), us these steamers are apt to be crowded
from February to April inclusive. Information as to available accom-
modation is telegraphed from Aden to Cairo. The days and hours given
below for the arrival and sailing of the steamers are approximate only,
except in the case of the terminal ports. At intermediate ports the steamers
hre sometimes behind itinerary time, and not unfrequently a day or two
in advance. In either case they proceed at once on their voyage.

Alexandria, the chief seaport of Egypt, is regularly visited by British,
French, Austrian, Italian. Russian, Greek, and Egyptian steamers. Port
Sa’fd, an the Suez Canal, is touched at by the vessels of the great
Australian. Asiatic, and East African lines. - Cairo may be reached by
rail in 3V2 hrs. trom Alexandria, and in 7 hrs. from Port Se’id. The rail.
way from Port Se‘id is a narrow»gauge line as far as Isma'iliya, where
carriages must be changed (p. IO; thour‘s halt).

Alexandria is almost 30° E. of Greenwich1 and its time is 1 hr. 59 min.
in advance of Greenwich time; that of Cairo is 2hrs. 5 min. and that
of Port Sa’id 2tsrs. 10 min. in advance of Greenwich. 'Central Europe'
time (observed on German and Italian railways, etc.) is t hr. in advance
of Greenwich.

Owing to the advance in the price of coal, Ib surtax of 10 per cent is
at present charged on seaxpassage fares to Egypt.
