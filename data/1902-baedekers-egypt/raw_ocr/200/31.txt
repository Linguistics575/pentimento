gut, and lastly the Ytd, the lute or maudoline, the oldest of all the

The Egyptians cunsider themselves a highly musical people. The
Egyptian sings when indulging in his 1rilf (p. xxvi], whether sitting un
his heels or stretched out on his mat, when driving his donkey. when
rurrying stones and mortar up a. scafruldiug, when working in the 1usl,rly
and when rowing. Ile sings whether alone or in company, regarding lis
vocal music as a means of lightening his labour and of sweetening his
repose. A peculiarity nf the Egyptian songs, however, is that they have
no tune, though they have a certain rhythm, which is always dependent
ml the text. They are sung through the muse on seven or eight different
notes. on which the perfurmcr wanders up and down. The character
" this sowallcd music is exceedingly monotonous and, to a European ear,
displeasing. The songs (mtvowiV or slmghl) are all of a lyrical description,
must of them are erotic and often pointless and meaningless. Some of
them, however. extol the pleasures of friendshlpand rational enjoyment,
or express derision of an enemy, ur contempt for the rustic fellru.s.

FEMALE SINGERS CAtviiurn , sing. 'Almeh or 'Alimeh; Le.
'learned women') of a good class are now very rare and perform
only in the harems of wealthy natives.

The FEMALE DANCERS, or Ghawdzi (sing. Ghaziyeh)l were for-
merly one of the chief curiosities of Egypt, but for some years past
they have been prohibited from performing in the streets. Really
good dancers are said to he now rare; the performances in the irafés-
nhantants in Cairo are very inferior.

The SNAKE CHARMERS (Rifd‘iyeh, sing. Rifd'i; p. lxvi) exhibit
performances of a very marvellous character, as credible European
residents in Cairo have testifier, but the traveller will rarely come
in contact with them except by lucky accident. The men and boys
who exhibit small snakes in the streets or at the hotels must of
course not be iyoafot1ni1ei1 with the Rifi'tyeh.

The JUGGLEBS (Haw?) of Egypt are similar to those of other
countries. The performances of the BUFFOONS (l.Cuntdiiti or 'Vol.itrb-
hazi) are disgracefully indelicate.

' [9). Baths.

The baths of Egypt, with their hot-airol1ambers, are those com-
monly known as Turkish, but they are neither so clean nor so well
tttted up as some of those in theiatger cities of Europe. A Turkish
bath is particularly refreshing after a long journey, and is an ad-
mirable preventive of colds and rheumatism. The baths are always
cleanest in the early morning. Fridays are to be avoided, as numerous
Muslims bathe early on that day, which is their Sabbath. When a
cloth is hung up at the entrance to the baths, it indicates that
women only are admitted.

The visitor fust enters :1 large vaulted chamber covered with a
mipola (Melt el-lmmmfzm), having a fountain of cold water in the
centre (fas.ktyeli), and the bathing towels hung around on strings.
Having taken off his shoes and given them to the attendant, the
visitor is next conducted to one of the raised lhvtins (Pl. 4) that
