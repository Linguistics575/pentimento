made from the w. bank immediately opposite Tewfilgiyeh.

The route at first skirts the stream, then turns inland towards
the desert, and fiually, gradually ascending, returns to the stream
shortly before the cataract is reached.

The Second Cataract is little inferior in scenic beauty tn the
First Cataract at Assuin, It lies at the N. end of the gorge of the
Batu el-Hagur ('be1ly of stones"), which begins at the island of
Dil, about 90 ll, to the 8., and through which the river descends in
a series of rapids, ever make of graywacke, greenstone, and granite,
forming numerous islands in its course. The best point of view is
the abrupt rocky hilt of Abusir, on the W. bank. At the foot of the
hill, contrasting strongly with the green of the tamarisk-trees. lies
:1 chaos of glistening black boulders, through which the river forces
its way in foaming (antamcts, especially fine at the time of the ht-
undation. In the distance to the N. are the white houses and slen-

and the pylon of the S. temple of Beheni (p. 377) on the W. bank;
