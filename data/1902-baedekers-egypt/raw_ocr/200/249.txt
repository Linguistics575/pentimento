One of the most popular
characters to be metwith in the
streets of Cairo is the Surya,
or Wvimrv-0Astrtrrm, with his goatskin of water, carried either by
himself or by a donkey, who still plies his trade, although the
water-works (p, 63) supply every house in the city, as well as the
public sebils o. clxiii], with water, and though on many of the
houses there are brass tubes through which passers-by may take a
praught from the main pipes.
