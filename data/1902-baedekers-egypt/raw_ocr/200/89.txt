IV. Outline of the History of Egypt.

I. ANCIENT HISTORY.
By Prof. G. Bleittdour.

a. From the Earliest Times to the Macedonian Conquest in 332 3.0.

Exact systems of chronology were as little known to the ancient
Egyptians as to the other peoples of antiquity. The events they
desired to record were dated according to the years of the king
reigning at the time. In order to determine at what period a partic-
ular king had reigned, the priests drew up long lists of monarchs,
fragments of which have survived to the present day [11. 222). The
chronological ep'itumes, moreover, which are all that has been trans-
mitted to us of the 'Egyptian History’, written in Greek by the
priest ILmethoi, were founded on these native registers. Manetho
arranged all the rulers of Egypt, from Menes, the first king, to
Alexand er the Great, in 31 Dynasties, which correspond, generally
speaking, to the various royal houses that held sway in Egypt sue-
cessively or Cat certain periods) contemporaneously. This arrange-
ment has been generally adopted by writers on the subject; but "
the same time, for the sake of 13or1venierure, several dynasties are
frequentlygrouped together under the name of 1'period', 'empire', or
'monarchy'. The lack of any settled chronology renders it, of course,
impossible to assign anything like exact dates for the kings before
Psammetikh I. The dates, tlumrfore, in the following outline are
given as approximate merely, and in the earliest period may some-
times be even centuries out.

l, The Prehistoric Period.

The dark prehistoric period, which later traditions till up with
dynasties of gods and demigods, is illumined by a few scattered
rays of light only. It may be taken as certain that the country did
not originally form one single kingdom, but Was divided into two
states - the 'North Land', corresponding to the Delta, and the
'South', stretching from the neighbourhood of Memphis (Cairo) to
