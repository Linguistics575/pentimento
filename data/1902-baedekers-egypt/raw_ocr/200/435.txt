184 UPPER EGYPT.

Visitors to the temples and tombs of Upper Egypt and Nubia
should be provided with a GENERAL ADMISSION TICKET, which may
be obtained (price £ 1E) at the Museum of Gizeh (p. 78) or at
any of the tourist-agents’ offices in Cairo. Travellers who intend to
visit Luxor only may obtain tickets for IN., valid for the ruins at
Thebes alone.

The ordinary traveller, desiring to visit only the principal points
of interest, may ascend the valley of the Nile either by railway or
by steamboat. By RAILWAY not less than 8 or 10 days are required
for a visit to Abydos, Dendera, Thebes, Edfu, and Asutin. Those
who use the STEAMBOATS, which spend 3 or 4 weeks on the voyage,
enjoy a much more thorough survey of these points; while the
voyage on the Nile has so many attrutions of its own that even the
must harried traveller should make a point of proceeding by river
at least between Luxor and Assuin. All are strongly recommended
to time their Journey so as to arrive at Luxor 3 or 4 days before full
moon; for moonlight adds a peculiar charm to a visit to the ruins
there and at Assuéu. It is as well for the independent traveller to
avoid as far as possible coming into contact with the large parties
organized by the tovrist-ageuts, for circumstances are apt to arise in
which he is pushed to the wall, without any redress.

The most attractive, but also the most expensive, method of
ascending the Nile is by Daausiyra (p.187). Vessels with 4-25
berths may be hired at Cairo. The steam-dahahiyehs or steam-
]aunches are not much slower than the large tourist-stesmers, but
in a sailing dahahiyeh, which has to be towed upstream when the
wind is unfavourable, not less than 2 or 3 months must be allowed
for the voyage to Assuén and back. ,

Railway. Quitting Cairo by the night-express (sleeping-ears),
we reach IMidaeh (pt 217)next morning, and ride thence on donkey-
back to Abydas (p. 218). Provisions for this expedition must be
brought from Cairo. We have stdfiiyient time to explore the ruins
at Abydos before catching the evening-train for Luror (p.233). At
least four days should be devoted to an inspection of the temples
and tombs at Thebes. On leaving Luxor we may either stop over a
train at Edfu (p. 314) or proceed straight through to Assuén (p, 327),
where not less than two days should be spent. Edfu. however, may
equally well be visited on the return-journey, as a night mast in
any case be spent at Luxor. We leave Luxor on our return by the
first morning-train and break the journey at Ifth (p. 225), whence
we ride to the temple of Dendem (p. 226). Provisions must he
brought from Luxor for this expedition. From Keneh we go on to
Cairo by the North express.

The railway may be utilized for other excursions by travellers who
are to some extent familiar with the customs and language of the country‘
The nights may be swam in the station waiting-ruoms (with permiseiun
of the atation-master) or at the houses of the local prefeets (’Omdeh).
Warm rugs, a camp-bed (if possible), and provisions (preserved meals.
