Copts. T HE MODERN EGYPTIANS. xxxix

whole of his spare time is occupied in drawing water- for the irriga-
tion of the land. Notwithstanding his hard lot, however, he is an
entire stranger to any endeavour to better his condition or to im-
prove his system of farming. As soon as he has accomplished the
most necessary tasks he rests and smokes, and trusts that Allah will
do the remainder of his work for him. . The fe11ilp is generally of a
peaceful disposition, kindly and helpful to his neighbour; theft is
less common among the fe1ltrbtn than in the corresponding classes
in Europe. Foreigners can see his best side only by observing his
dealings with his follows; for he regards strangers as merely so
many convenient sources of profit (comp. p. xx).

(2j.0oezs ([ciibt, ‘w'iby. While we have regarded the felléhin as
genuine Egyptians in consequence of their uninterrupted occupation
ofthe soil, the religion of the Copts affords us an additional guarantee
for the purity of their descent. The Copts are undoubtedly the most
direct descendants of the ancient Egyptians, there being no ground
for the assumption that their ancestors were foreign immigrants who
embraced Christianity after the conquest of the country by the
Mohammedans, while on the other hand the obstineey with which
they defended their monophysite Christianity for several centuries
against the inroads of the creed of Byzantium affords another
indication of their Egyptian character. The size of the CJoptiopopuls-
tion ofthe valley of the Nile cannot be very accurately stated.' They
are most numerous in the towns of Northern Egypt, around the
ancient Coptos, at Negédeh, Luxor, Esneh, Dendera, Girgeh, Tahta,
and particularly at Assitlt. and Akhmim. A large proportion of the
population of all these places is Coptic.

The Coptic Patriarch is elected from their own number by the monks
of the five chief monasteries of Egypt. These are the monasteries of St.
Anthony and St. Paul in the western desert (p. IN), the two in the valley
of the Natren Lakes, and the large convent or Maragh (p. ih), near 31ordalt1.t.

Most of the Copts that dwell in towns are engaged in the more
riyf1ned handicrafts (as watelumrkers, goldsmiths, Jewellers, em-
broiderers, tailors, weavers, octhinet-rnakers, tumers, manufacturers
of spurious antiquities, em), or in trade, or as clerks, accountants,
and noteries. Their physique is accordingly materially different
from that of the fellehin and even from that of Coptic peasants.
They are generally of more delicate frame, with small hands and
feet; their necks are longer and their skulls are higher and narrower
than those of the peasantry; and, lastly, their complexion is fairer.
These differences are suffioieutly accounted for by their mode of
life; for, when we compare these Copts who are engaged in rustic
pursuits, or the Coptic Burne,l-driviyrs of Upper Egypt, with the
feliilrir1, we flttd that the two races are not distinguishable from

' The total number- of Oriental Christians in Egypt (Copts, Greeks,
and Armenians) is 645,775, or 6 63 per cent of the entire population. The
total number of all Christians (including Protestants and Roman Catholics)
is 731,235, " 7.51 per cent of the total.
