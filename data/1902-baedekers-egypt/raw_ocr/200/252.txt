frequenters of the bazaars is the dallél, or auctioneer, who carries
on his head or shoulders the goods he is instructed to sell, and
runs up and down the lanes shouting 'liardg, barég', and adding the
amount of the last bid he has received. However great the con-
fusion may be, his practised ear instantly detects each new bid is-
suing from one of the dukkans, and he immediately announces the
lew offer - 'biraehrtn (tirah’, 'bi'ashrtn unux', and so on. The seller
