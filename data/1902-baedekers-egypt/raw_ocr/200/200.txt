XII. Works on Egypt.

The traveller who desires more than a mere sapermOl aequainl-
ance with the land of the Pharaohs should of course before leaving
home read some of the standard works on the subject, and also
select a number of others for reference or entertainment during the
journey. This is all the more necessary if the traveller is entirely
ignorant of the ancient and modern languages of the country, in
which case he will find it difMult, if not impossible, to institute
independent enquiries as to its manners, literature, and. art. From
the appended list, which might easily be extended, the traveller
may make a selection in accordance with his individual taste.

A very complete bibliography of Egypt will he found in Prince Ibra-
him Ililmy‘s Literature of Egypt and the Sondan from the earliest times
to the year 1835 inclusive 2 vols. fol., Lemlon, 1886-87. Among the leading
foreign authorities on pt are TeysosVr'Dert1rmiiler ans tEgypten und
fEthiopieu', Champallion's ‘Monumenta dc l'Egypte et de la Nubie', Roeellim":
Woaumeuti dell' Egitto e della Gubia', and the 'Deseripuon de 1%gypte'
published by the members of the Frvnch expedition.
