as El-Aeaslf, the r0ck-tornbs in which date mostly from the begin-
ning of the Seite period (25th and 26th Dyn.). Various brick-build-
ings end a large arched doorway of unburned bricks are also noticed.
The latter, built by the Theban prince Men-tem-het (26th Dyn.),
belonged to a large building, the bricks of Which were used to build
the Coptic convent at Dér el-b ahri (p. 279). The tombs usually consist
of an open court, reached by a flight of steps, whence a door admits
to a large hall, beyond which are the inner passages and chambersl

The Tomb of Peteemenopé (inaccessibleat present), a high official under
the 26th Dyn., is larger than any of the kings' tombs at Bibén-el-Muhik,
being 862 it, in length and 2660 sq. yde. in area. All the wells are orna-
mented with carefully executed inscriptions and reliefs, now unfortunately
much injured and blackened. These, almost without exeeption, refer to
the fate of the son] after death.

Otf the same court as the above opens also the tomb of Wah-eb-ri.
Among the other tombs of the same epoch may be mentioned that of
Ebé, a little to the N. EhE Was an ofiieial in the reign of Nitocris,
daughter of Psammetikh I. and Shep-im-Weiser. Farther t0 the N. is the
i'me but much injured tomb of Prince Hurum, an omeial of Queen Amen-
ertara, sister of the Ethiopian King Shabako.

6, The Rameeseum.

This temple may be reached from the landing-place on the W. bank
in about U: hr.-, from the Colosei of Memnon in 1/4 hrs, and from )Iedinet
Habu " Dtsr erbayri in about 20 minutes.

The "Ramisssemn, the large temple built by Ramses II. on the
W. bank and dedicated to Ammon, is unfortunately only half
preserved. We may in all probability identify it with the ‘Tomb of
anmundyas’ described by the Augustan historian Diodurus,although
his description does not tally in all points with the extant remains.
Strabo seems to have referred to it briefly as the Memnnnium, or
building of Memnon.

Osymandyasis a corrupt form of Ueer-ma-ré, the praunmen nfRamses II.

We begin our inspection at the great Pylon, which formed the
E. entrance to the temple. This was originally 220 ft. broad, but
its ruined exterior is now more like a quarry than a building. Many
representations on the broad surface of its W. Side, next the first
court, are in fair preservation and easily recognizable with an Dpera-
glass (especially by afternoon-light). They refer to the Syrian
campaigns of Ramses IL, especially to the war with the Hittites in
the 5th year of his reign, which is also commemorated on the pylon
at Luxor (p. 2-10).

On the N. Wing, to the extreme left, we observe the Asiatic fortresses,
taken by Ramses in the 8th year of his reign. Thirteen of the original
eighteen are still recognizable, each with an inscription containing its
name. The captives are led by Egyptian princes. In the Middle, below,
is the Egyptian army on the march, the Infantry and cl1oNoteBrs in two
rows, with traces of an inscription at the foot; above appears the Egyptian
camp, within a rampart of shields, presenting an animated scene, The
rhariots are drawn up in long lines, while the unharnessed horses are
being foddered; close by are the heavy haggage-waggnns with their teams,
unperturbed by the great lion of the king, which reclines before him. The
asses employed in the commiesariat service of the army are conspicuous
