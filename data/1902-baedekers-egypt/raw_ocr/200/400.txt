An interesting excursion may he made to the mosque of Abul
Ma'iiteh, in the suburb of el-Gebéneh, to the N. of the town. The
building appears to date from the period of the old town of Da-
mietta, and has Cutie inscriptions in front. The interior contains
numerous columns, two of which, standing on the same base, are
believed, like those in the Mosque of rAmt at Cairo, to possess
miraculous powers. (Jaundice-patieuts, for example, are said to
