201/2 acres? and contain a variety of rare and beautiful trees and
shrubs. The open spaces, as in all Egyptian gardens, are planted
with the Lippia nodi/tora, to supply the place of grass, which does
not thrive in this dry climate. An artititrial hill with a belvedere
and a pretty grotto, to the right of the entrance opposite the Con-
tinental Hotel, commands thehestview. Among the other attractions
of the piece are several cafés, a summer-theatre (p. 30), a restaurant,
in the NE. part of the garden, etc. An Egyptian band, which
generally performs European music, plays here daily from 5 to
about 8 p.111. , and a British military band plays on two evenings
at week in summer. The gardens afford a delightful promenade at
all periods of the day, and they present a very attractive appearance
by gas-light; but invalids should be careful to leave them before
sundown, after Which the air here is very damp.

Adjoining the Ezbekiyeh on the N.E. is the small square of
1niltsn er-Ehasneddr (Pl. 0, 3; Shiri’a Clot-Bey, see p. 63). The
narrow streets to the N.E. lead to one of the most disreputable
quarters of Cairo. - To the S.E. is the International Tribunal
(Tribunoux Mimics; Pl. C, 3), beyond which is the small 'plaee'
named ‘Annm EL-KHAPRA, the chief point of intersection of the
electrictramways (p. 26), whence the Muski (_p. 41) leadsto the E. To
the S.W of the International Tribunal is the General Post Opiee
(Pl. 0, 3; p. 26), and to the N.W. of the latter, on the S. side of
the Ezbekiyeh, is the Opera House (p. 30). In the Place de l'Ope'm
(Medan el-Teatro; Pl. B, C, 3), between the Opera House and the
Continental Hotel, is an Equestrian Statue of lbrtshtm Pasha. Thence
the Shari'a 'Abdin leads to the S. to the place known as Mimirr
'Am/ur, on the E. side of which lies the Khedivial Palace (Palaia
'NUM; Pl. C, 4).

Westwards from the Ezbekiyeh and the 8hiri'a 'Abdin as far
as the Nile and the Isma"rltyeh Canal extends the Quarter of
Isma'iliyeh. The quarter was begun by the Khedive Isma’il (p. a),
Who desired to rival the modern quarters of Paris, and presented
sites here gratuitously to any one who would undertake to erect on
each a house worth at least 30,000 fr. within eighteen months. Most
of the houses are architecturally uninteresting, but there is a fair
sprinkling of handsome buildings. Several of the principal hotels
are situated in this quarter, also the English Church CPI. B, 3;
p. 30) and the German Protestant Church, the ministerial ofhees,
most of the consulates, and many palaces of Egyptian grandees,
with gardens enclosed by high walls, so that only the roofs arevisihle
to passers-by. Beside the Great Nile Bridge (p. 75) is the huge bar-
rack of Kay en-N?l(1"l. A, 4). Beyond this, at the corner of the
Shari’a W2bilr srl-Miva, is the handsome new building of the
Museum of Egyptian Antiquities (p. 78). Among the other modern
buildings in this neighbourhood are the French Arcliaeoloyioat In..
stitute, in the Shiri'a Fum et- Teraah Ciine library), and the tasteful
