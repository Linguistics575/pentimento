J. N. Quarters. CAIRO. 4. Route. 59

e. The Northern Quarters.

The following section deals principally with the interesting edifices in
the N.E. part of Cairo, to the N. of the Sikkeh eLGedideh, the continua-
tion of the Muski (P- M). The route here described is thus a direct cun-
tinuntiun of that described in Section 2. - The N.W. portion of Cairo
(p. M.) contains little of interest.

From the Sikkeh el-Gedideh (Rue Neuve), opposite the i1tmi'a
el-Ashraf (P1. E, 3; p. 42), we enter the 8litirira el-Khordagiyeh
(PL E, 3), which begins at the Sebil ofShElah MotaMar, dating from
1700. This street, with the Shiri’a en-Nahhftsin to the N., is the
continuation of the great line of thoroughfares which runs from the
Bib ez-zmrtmyh on the S. to the Bath el-FutO (p. 62) on the N.

To the sight lies the entrance to the Khan el-Khalil (p. 42),
nearly opposite which is the 50.1; tt.Wigh ol. Siydgh), or bazaar
of the gold and silver smiths, which consists of several crooked
lanes, barely a yard in width. The occupants of these crowded
alleys keep their wares in glass-cases or under glass shades. Their
stalls present a very poor appearance, but their filigree-work is
sometimes very good. Spurious gold and silver wares are not 1111-
frequently sold as genuine. The silver manufactured at the shops
ought to bear a government stamp,indicating the number of carats.

From this labyrinth of lanes we return to the Shiri'a ei-Khor-
dagiyeh, which is prolonged by the Shdri’a el-t76liergtyels and the
Shriri'a en-Nald.uhhs. The last contains the uninteresting market
of the coppersmiths. Several pipe -makers (shibulcshi) are also
established here. On the left side of this street are the imposing
red and white facades of the mosques of Iftiristdn J.ralthhs, Ma-
rammed ewt-ngir, and Baryil.ctyeh (p. 60), which occupy what was
once the site of a small palace of the Fit.imite sultan Mu'izz.

Opposite is the broader Shdrfa Btt el-l.rth.lt, leading to the B6t
e1-1ai.1t (P1. E, 3), " 'House of the Judge”, originally a. palace of
Emir Mamay, a general of Ttit Bey. In the large court on the
right is an open verandah, resting on columns with early Arabian
capitals. This is the entrance to the building in which the I.rii.lt
holds his court on Sat. (at t p.m. Arab time). This court was
formerly the supreme tribunal of the country, and the appointment
of lpti.lt was made by the government at Constantinople, and was
frequently bestowed upon favourites, as it is a very lucrative post.
Now, however, the .ktu.1i is always an Egyptian, and his jurisdiction
is limited to cases in which the law laid down by the Koran is to
be administered, and particularly to actions between husband and
wire. - We now return to the main street.

The mosque of MaristAn KalAnn (PL E, 3) was once a vast
hospital, the greater part of which is now in a ruinous condition,
and used as a workshop by coppersmiths and tinkers. The tomb of
the founder, however, and the small mosque opposite (recently

restored] are tolerably preserved. The building, begun by Sultan
