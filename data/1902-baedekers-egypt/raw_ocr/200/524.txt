and Greek inscriptions, besides representations of foot-prints, placed here
by pilgrims to the temple,

Adjoining the temple of khons on the S.W. is a Temple of
Osiris, built upon a basis about 12 ft. in height, crowned with a
hollow cornice. The keeper of the temple of KMus will open it on
request. The entrance is on the W. side; on the jambs appears the
king before Osiris and other deities. We enter first a Rectangular
Hall, with a well-preserved ceiling resting upon two columns, with
calyx-capitals and heads of Hathor on the abeci. The grated win-
dows at the top of the S. wall should be noted. To the right lie three
side-rooms with crypts; the door on the left is built up. - We
proceed through the central door into a Second mil, flanked by two
side-rooms, ofwhich that to the left contains a representation of the
dead Osiris upon the bier. We then pass through a door, on the right
jamb of which appears Opet, the hippoputamus-goOess, and enter
the Sanctuary. The representations here show us the king (usually
Fmergetes 11.) before the gods. From the Sanctuary a flight of steps
descends to the chambers in the basement and to the tyxite.doot.

b. Tm; GREAT TEMPLE " AMMoN.

Proceeding through the lanes of Karnak in the direction of the
Nile, we soon reach the first pylon of the great temple of Ammon,
The rectangular terrace in front of this was even in antiquity covered
by the waters of the inundation, as is indicated by marks on its
trout, recording the height of the ir1ur1tiations under the 21st-26th
dynasties. On the terrace rises an Obelisk ofSethoa IL, beside which
is the base of its companion. A row of Kriu-Sphinxes, erected by
Ramses II., extended from this point to the portal of the temple of
Ammon. The fragments of building to the SW. of the right pylon-
tower belong to at Chapel, erected about 390 B.0, by King Akhoris
and his successor Pisammutbis. In the interior Peammuthis appears
offering incense to the boat of Ammon.

The great "Temple of Ammon, the 'Throne of the World' as it
was officially styled, was not built on any single uniform plan, but
owes its present form to the building activity of many successive
rulers of Egypt. From the Middle Empire to the Ptolemaic period
most of the Pharaohs took some share in adding to or adorning this
shrine, rivalling each other in the magnitude of their designs. The
foundation of the temple must be dated not later than the flrst
monarchs of the 12th Dynasty. When Thutmosis I. ascended the
throne and made Thebes his capital, the original modest shrine
seemed no longer worthy of the dignity of the god, and the king
therefore added two colonnades and two pylons (Nos. y and IV) in
front of the temple. In the reign of Makeré alterations and additions
were made in the interior only (on each side of the Sanetuary), and
these were continued under her brother Thutmosis m., when he
became sole monarch. Thutmosis furthermore erected a separate
