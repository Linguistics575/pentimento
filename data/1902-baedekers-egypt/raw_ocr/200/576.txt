with bt1d-mvpitals. The latter (11 of which still stand) were lower
than the former, but upon them Iose a wall, with window-openings,
to the height of the others. Each of the side-aisles had six couples
of columns with bud-capitals; six columns to the left are still erect.
Part of the roof of the central aisle still remains. 0n the smooth
shafts of the columns appears Ramses IL sirerifitring to the gods.

On the S. IIIalf of the E. Wall (Pl. o) the storming of the Hittite for,
tress. of Zapur 1e shown in the lower row. To the left is the Pharaoh dash-
mg in his chariot against the enemy, some of whom are slain, while the
test, home, foot, and chariots, hetake themselves to tlight, T0 the right
.‘s the fortrese, defended by the Hittites, while the Egyptians are attack-
ing it'on sealing-ladders, or push up to the walls under the protection ot
stormiug-shede and shields. The sons of the Pharaoh, the names of whom
are given, distinguish themselves in the battle. In the upper row are
several representations of the king saerifieing tn the, gods. - 011 the
W. Wall, in the lower row (Pl. b, v), appear the arms of the Pharaoh, in
the upper row. above PI, b, is the king before Amman and Khons, with
the liou-headed Sekhmet Wert-hekew behind him, and above Pt. 5, the
king followed by a goddess, in presence of Ammon and Nut.

The First Smell Hypostyle Hall, with four couples of papyrus-
bud columns, has a well-preserved roof decorated with astronomical
representations and scenes of the king before the gods.

The Reur s on the walls are not uninteresting. 0n the II. ll’m/l
(PI. d, e) are p ests bearing the sacred boats of Ammon. Mutt and thms,
each t1e00rsteil with the head of its god. On the N. W. Wall (P1. f) the
king is seated beneath the sacred tree of Heliopolis, on the leaves of
which his names are being written by Atum (seated on a throne to the
left), the goddess 8efkhet-ebui, end Thout (to the right).

Of the following Second Small Hypostyle Ball only the N. half,
with four columns, remains. The sacrifieUl representations here are
of little interest; at P1.9 the king is shown burning incense to
Ptah and the lion-headed Sekhmet. - The other rooms, adjoining
this to the W. and at the sides, are completely ruined.

Behind the Ramesseum especially towards the N.W., (tre the remains
at a number of extensive Ariel: Buildings, some of which Were erected in
the time of Ramses W, as we learn from the stamps rm the bricks. Among
the rest are some weu-rumstrueted vaults, originally euvered by a plat-
form, From the fragments of wiruritrrs and the stoppers found here we
may reasonably conclude that these were storerooms ih connection with
the temple. Adjacent is an altar, resembling that of Der el-htthri (p. 28.2r

About 500 puoes to the N. of the Ramesseum we observe the remains
of an extensive wall built of File bricks. The name of Thumasis 111.
found here on many tiles renders it probable that a temple built by this
king or dedicated to him stood on this site. Between the Ramesseum
and this temple of Thutmnsis lay the Mortuary Temples of Amertayhz‘s I].

discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1896. - Farther to the N.E. the remains pf
the Mortuary Temple of Amenophis I. were discovered by Spiegelherg m

(18th Dyn.), Tlmlmaaia ly., Queers Tewosrel (wife of Si-Ptah, p. ?79), and
King Hercnptah (p. 267), all of which were explored by Flinders Petrie m 1896.
