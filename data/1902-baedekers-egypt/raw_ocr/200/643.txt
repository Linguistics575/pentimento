340 Route 29, PHIL/E. Temple

Pylon I and on the N. by Pylon IL On the E. and W. are edifiees,
each with a colounade on the side next the court. On the W, (left)
is the BmTu House, dedicated to Hathor-Isis and to the memory of
the birth of her son Horus. It is also reached by a doorway in the
W. tower ofPylon I (see p. 339); on the back of the pylon is a relief
of four priests carrying the boat of Isis, preceded by the king offer-

ing incense.

The Birth House is surrounded on all four sides by culonnndes, the
columns of which have floral capitals surmounted hy 11au1o1seapitirls. The
I-ulumns on the w. side are, unfinished. The walla the tolumns, and the
wureen-walls between the columns are adorned with the cunvuntinnal I'L'-
liefs and irtscriptiors, mostly dating from Euergetes 11., Neos Dionysus,
Augustus, and Tmerius. Speciilly noteworthy is the relief (Pl. b), in tht
central row, tn the left: nuto, goddess of the North, playing the harp
before the youthful llorns (nude, wearing the double crown) and his mother
Isis, who Sits behind him; behind Buho is Augustus bearing at shallow vase.
The cow among, marsh-plants, depicted above the vase, is to be taken as
representing the ornamentation within it. To the left of this scene appears
the Pharaoh upening the chapel, in which is seated Icis, suckling Horus.
In the upper row, at P1. c, are two seientilicially impurtant Inm-xptz'um of
Epiphanea, unfortunately injured by reliefs atterwa‘rde carved over them
by Neos Dionysus. These inscriptions are in hieroglyphics and the demotic
character. One of them is a duplicate (wanting the Greek text) of the
inscription on the Rosetta Stone (p. 2th

The 1sTmtruR of the temple is of little interest. On passing through
the Main Entrance Tl. d), behind the great pylon, we enter a culumned
Vnslibule, the mural reliets in which show Tiberius otTering gifts to the
gods. A door, above which is a. window between four heads or llathur
lone now wantingt, leads hence to three rooms lying (me behind the other

rear-wall: Igisw giving birth to llurus in the marshes; Amman and Thuut
accompany her; behind Amman are the goddess of the Nurth and the god
'Wisdum', behind Thout the goddess of the South and the god 'Reason'. On
the lett wall: It goddess uttering her breast lo the child Horus, who stands;
Euergetes IL handing two mirrors to Hathor, who places her hands in
blessing on the head of the child Home

The EAST BUILDING, opposite the Birth House, was occupied by
the priests, partly for sAiyrrtifie purposes. The colonnade of ten plant-
columns is very elegant. The reliefs and inscriptions date from Neos
Dionysos, the votive inscription on the archttl’ave from EuergetesII.

The Firit Roam (P1. e) is nnteworthy, as from it a staircase ascends
to a larger apartment in the upper story and thence to the ruof of the

 

colonnadc. - In the Third Room (P1. g) are rude reliefs of men ton the
left wall), with the related in=uriptious in Ethiopian cursive characters
(1). nix). i The Frflh Room (Pl. o was the library. The tromparatrvely

high reliefs exhibit Tiberius before different gods. 0n the leftwali as we
enter: Tlmut. god of Wisdom‘ between Maat, goddess of truth (with .t
palette), and the lion-headed chnut, behind whom stands Sefkhetehui,
goddess of writing. To the left is areeess (for books), with a seated ibis
above it. - The Sixth Roam (P1. k) shows Tiberius before the Egyptian
gods, on the walls to the right and left. A door in the exterior brick-
well here opens on the main street of the ruined Coptic town (p, 343).
There is another door on the right.

At the N. end of the colonnade is a Door (Pl. o, approached by
~eve1'a1steps, opening upon the inner passage round the temple.
The reliefs upon thiq show Neos Diouysuw before the gods.
