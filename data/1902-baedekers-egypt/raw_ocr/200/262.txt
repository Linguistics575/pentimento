3. The South-Eastern Quarters.

The route described in this section leads vit the Boulevard Me'hémet-
Ali to the Citadel, and thence by a wide curve to the S. back to the
boulevard. Electric Tramway to the Place Rumeleh, see p. 25.

Starting from the Place 'Atabet el-Khaglra (see p. 40), the
Saint; Mor.rasrrrsu 'ALI " Boulevard Méhérnet-Ati (P1. IE, 3-6),
1860 yds. in length, leads to the S.E. straight to the foot of the
citadel. A little more than one-thire of the way down the boulevard
we cross the filled-in bed of the El-Klmtig canal; to the left lies
the Place 3111: el-Khallc, with the Administralion Building (Gouvem-
orati Pl. D, 4), containing thePolice Headquarters o. 26), and the new
building of the Viceregal Library (p. 56). The Sheri'a Bib M-EGU.:
(called farther on Habbaniyeh, p. 58) leads to the right to the
present library o. 56). About 1/4 M. farther on, a side-strcet leads
to the thimi'a el-Melekeh Sofiya (P1. D,IV, entrance by the S. portal),
a Turkish-Arabian mosque of 1611 , with a dome supported by
antique columns, and ornamented in the Byzantir1e-Arabiar1 style.
The pulpit is of marble. A short visit may also be paid to the small
mosque of Et-Burde"ni (Pl. D, 5), built in 1630 and restored in 1885,
lavishly adorned with mosaics, and adjoined by a large and elegant
minaret. - Farther on the boulevard passes the uninteresting and
much altered mosque of Er-Nkstsn Custirs'; Pl. D, m, and ends
near two large mosques. That on the left is the 11niiniisl1ed Bitmira
Rifa’iyeh, named after an order of dervishes (p. Ixvi), and con-
taining the family burial-vault of the Khedive Isma‘il. - 0n the
right rises the -

**eiunra Sultan Hanan (Pl. E, fo, the 'superb mosque’, and the
finest existing monument of Byzantine-Arabian architecture. It was
built in 1356-59 by Sultan Hasan (p. xcvi; tickets of admission
necessary, seep. 30; 1 pies. for the use of shoes). The exterior of this
huge building, which occupies a bush-grown rock below the citadel,
recalls the broad surfaces of the early-Egyptian temples. The massive
“Gateway (Pl. I), 85 ft. high, though its scheme of ornamentation
was never fully carried out, has been more or less closely imitated
in the entrances to many other Egyptian mosques. -AII the faqades
ofthe mosque are crowned by a unique andholdly projecting cornice,
of 'stimuytite' formation and formerly furnished with pinn‘aclea. The
shallow central recess of the N.W. facade displays one large window
and a little ornamentation, while the other recesses are pierced by
windows of unequal size. The outside of the mausoleum is decorated
in the Byzantine-Seljuk style. - The S. Minaret CPI. 11a) is the high-
est minaret in Cairo, measuring 270 ft. from the pavement (that of
El- (lhitrt 213 ft., Jraltrt'm 193 ft., Muaiyad 167 ft., Et-AJar 167 ft.,
Kd'it Bey and Bar.bttl) 164 ft., Tum”. 132 ft., 'Amr 105 ft.). The
corresponding minaret (P1. Ith) on the N. facade was overthrown
by an earthquake, but was afterwards rebuilt on a smaller scale.
