business pursuits. The townspeople profess Islamism, but, in their
youth particularly, they are becoming more and more lax in their
obedience to the Koran Thus the custom of praying in public, out-
side the house-doors and shops, is gradually falling into disuse. The
European dress, moreover, is gradually superseding the Oriental,
though the latter is far more picturesque, and better suited to the
climate. On the whole, however, they are bigoted Muhammedaus,
and share the contempt with which the felléthin regard all other
religions. Their daily intercourse with unbelievers and their dread
of the power of the Christian nations tend, however, to keep their
fanaticism, which otherwise would be unbounded, in check, and has
even induced them to admit strangers to witness the most sacred
ceremonies in their mosques.

(5). BERBRRE. The name Berberi [plan bardbra) is applied to
the Nubian inhabitants of the Nile-valley between the neighbour-
hood ofAssuén and the Fourth Cataract. The Egyptians and Nuhians
are radically difrerent, and the dislike between the two races is
carried to such an extent that Nubians never marry Egyptian wives.
The Nubians are inferior to the Egyptians in industry and energy,
especially in tilling the soil, and in physical (and perhaps also in
intellectual) vigour; and they are more superstitious and fanatical,
as is indicated by the numerous amulets they wear round their
necks and arms. They are, however, superior to the Egyptians in
cleanliness, honesty, and subordination, and possess a more highly
developed sense of honour. The traveller must not expect to find
them very sincerely attached or grateful, any more than the native
Egyptians, but as servants they are certainly preferable. The Nubian
language, which is divided into the three dialects of Kentis, Mahés,
and Dongula, belongs to a special group of the African tongues; and
Dr. Brugsch is of opinion that it may afford a clue to the inter-
pretation of the still undeciphered Ethiopian (Heroitid) inscriptions
of the Nubian part of the Nile-valley.

Those Berbers'who do not learn Arabic grammatically never speak
it thoroughly well ; but it is generally, though imperfectly, understood
in Nubia; The traveller must therefore not expect to learn good Arabia
from his Nubian servants. In their native ouf1ntry the Berbers till
the banks of the Nile, bat their land is of very limited extent and
poorly cultivated; and as their harvests are scanty they are rarely able
to supportlarge families. They accordingly often emigrate at an early
age to the richer lowlands, ohieily to the large towns, in quest of
employment. When the Berber has succeeded in amassing a mod-
erate fortune, he returns to settle in his native country, of which
throughout his whole career he never entirely loses sight, and to
which he frequently remits his hardly earned savings for the benefit
of his relatives. The cold winter-nights in Egypt are very trying to
the poor Barbers, who often have to sleep in the open air outside the
doors, and many of them are attacked by consumption. They are
