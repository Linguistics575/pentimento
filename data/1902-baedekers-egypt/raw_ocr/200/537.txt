Thutmosis 11. Sethos J. restored the reliefs from which Ameno-
phis IV. (p. 203) had removed all allusions to Amman; but he
frequently inserted his own name instead of replacing those of the
ancient kings.

Six colossal seated figures of kings were originally placed before
the S. side of this pylon. The best-preserved of these are: to the W.,
Amenophis L (limestone) and Thutmosis Il. (red hreccia); to the
E., 'l'hutmosis H. Both the figures of Thutmosis retain their lower
part only; an inscription on the back of that to the W. records
that Thutmosis Ill, restored it in the 42nd year of his reign.

The following Pylon IX, built by King Haremheb, has collapsed.
The reliefs and inscriptions (of Haremheb, Ramses IL, Ramses IV.,
and Ramses VI.) are of little interest. On the S. side are the remains
of two colossal statues, which Ramses IL 'usurped'.

Between Pylons IX and X lies a square court, surrounded by a
wall, which is interrupted on the left (E.) side by the ruins ofa
small Temple of Amenophis ll,

In front of the temple is a Gallery, home by lk square. pillars em-
bellished with reliefs. Thence a granite portal admits us to a large Hall,
the roof of which rested on 16 square pillars with concave cnrniees at
the top. On the four sides of each pillar appears Amenuphis II. before
some deity. This hall is tiauked by smaller chambers, two of which
have pillars like those of the main hall. Most of the sculptures on the
walls and pillars are executed in fine low relief, only a few being in
Mink relief. Much of the colouring is in good preservation.

On the E. Wall of the court, to the right (sl) of the temple, are
several important reliefs of Haremheb. At Pl. d we see the king
conducting to the Theban triad a number of captives from the im,.
otynse-yielding land of Punt, who hear sacks of gold and gems and
other gifts. At Pl. e, to the right of the door, the king appears
leading fettered Syrian captives before the Theban triad.
