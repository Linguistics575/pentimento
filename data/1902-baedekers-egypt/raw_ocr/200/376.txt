many instances been pushed on one side, and on the top of SDme
of them the Arabs, for some unexplained reason, have built rude
masses " masonry. MI the sareophagi, when discovered by Mariette,
had been emptied of their contents, with the exception of two,
which still contained. a number of trinkets. Only a few of the
sareophagi bear inscriptions; one hears the name of Amasis, another
that of Cambyses, and a third that othubush, leader of the Egyptians
against the Persians (p. lxxxvi].

Near the E. end of the principal passage we reach a side-passage
(P1. f) diverging to the right, from which another passage leads to
the right, in a direction parallel with the main corridor, but now
built up7 as it was in a dangerous condition. Opposite, we pass
over another sarcophagus by means of steps CPI. g) and thus regain
the door by which we entered the vaults. The temperature in these
subterranean chambers is always about 7WI Fahr.

'I eonfcss‘, says Mariette, in his rcpurt of the discovery, 'that when
1 penetrated for the frrst time, on
12th Nov., 1851, into the Apis vaults,
1 was so profoundly struck with
astonishment that the feeling is
still fresh in my mind, although
tive years have elapsed since then.
Owing tn some chance which it is
r1ffieult to account for, a chamber
which had been walled up in the
thirtieth year of the reign of Ram-
see 11 hai escaped the notice of
the plunderers of the vaults, 1nd
I was so fortunate as to tind it nu-
touel1ed. Although 3700 years had
elapsed since it was elosei1, every-
thing in the chamber seemed to be
precisely in Its original condition.
The f1r1tgera1aclrs of the Egyptian
whn had inserted the last stone
in the wall built to conceal the
doorway were still recognisable
on the lime. There Were also the
marks of naked feet imprinted on
the sand which lay in one corner
of the tnmb-chamhcr. Everything
wae in its original condition in this
tnmb,where the cmbalmed remains
of the bull had Iain undisturbed
for thirty-seven centuries’.

Next to the Apis Tombs the private tombs (Ma.sysas, p.'ex1iii)
are the most interesting points at Salshera, though only a few are
open to the inspection of tourists.

The “Magtaha of Ptahhotep, wl1iol1 lies between the Step Pyr-
amid and Mariette‘s House and has only recently been made MMye88-
ible, dates from the period of the 5th Dym, under which the
deceased held one of the highest offiees of state.

From the entrance CA on the Plan, p. 138), on the N, side, we
enter a Comuuon (R), on the right of which is the PILLARED HALL
