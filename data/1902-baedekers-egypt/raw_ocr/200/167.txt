tâ€˜lvi ALEXANDRIAN ART.

locks presented him as the ruler of the kingdom of the dead and as
the beaetityeat saviour, somewhat as the colossal statue in the Alex-
andria Museum (central figure in 11.11) and the colossal head in the
Gizeh Museum J. XL, No. 306) represent him.

The sculptors of SMALLER WORKS OF ART also were at first
entirely dependent upon the Greek motherland. Thus for terracottas
they borrowed models from Tanagra, so that numerous Egyptian
terracottas have been found absolutely identical with the well-knowu
1unagra figures. The best specimens from the necropoles of Alex-
andria are to be seen in the museum of that city (Room l, Case BB,
lower shelf). But it was just in the, studios of these sculptors that
an independent spirit manifested itself at a very early date. Their
art emancipated itself from the imported forms and motives, and
found a new method of expression for fresh materials supplied
directly from the experiences and environment of the artists. This
pee11liarly Alexa11drian art shows a character in complete contrast
with the above-mentioned ideal school; its basis is the most 11rw0m-
promising Realism. Its favourite subjects, frequently treated in a
humorous or satirical vein, were common scenes from the street
life of the metropolis, which seems in many points to have been
similar to that of the modern Arab quarters of Cairo and Alexandria.
Thus, for example, in a bronze group from the Delta (now in the
Polytechnic at Athens) we see a Nubian tttlit-seller crouching on the
ground and snatching a siesta behind his tastefully arranged wares,
while an ape, seated on his shoulder, carries uuinvestigations in his
master's hair. Another bronze, of similar origin and in the same
collection, represents a slave, with the typical head of the Akka
negroes somewhat caricatured, hastily devouring a stolen piece of
meat. From the same place also comes the basalt figure (now at
Athens) of a Nubian boy carrying a burden on his raised left hand,
while the elbow is supported on the hip, in a manner customary to
this day. These three statuettes are masterpieces, not only in tech-
nique but even more in their keeu conception and reproduction of
racial characteristics. Numerous specimens of similar street-types
will be found among the Greek terracottas in the museums at Cairo
and Alexandria. We can best see what were the favourite subjects
of the Alexandrian sculptors7 and how they were treated, from those
familiar works of humbler art; from the designs on terracotta lamps;
and from the small bronze figures which are found in great numbers
in the Nile Delta. These small works had, of course, their models
in the higher branches; comp. the realistic figure of a woman in the
museum at Alexandria (Room T, Case AA, No. 1401). Many of the
motives would be well adapted for fountain-figures, if executed on
a larger scale, and they were probably originally devised for this
purpose; 43.9., the recumbent figure of a Satyr leaning on his wine-
skin, and causing a jet of water to issue from it (Gizeh Museum at
Cairo). Many subjects again were taken from the theatre and the
