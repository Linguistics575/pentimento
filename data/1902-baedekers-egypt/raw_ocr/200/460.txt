About A M. inland (W.] from R6ia, between the Baht Yr'asuf and the
Nile, near the village of Ashmunén, lie the ruins of the once famous
city of Khmmm ICOytie Shmum, the Hermopoiis of the Greeks, Which
from a very remote period was the chief seat of the worship of Thom,
the god of writing and s‘iBuce. This town was also 1hc ca. ital of the
name of hares. in Upper Egypt, whose princes under the Mi dle Empire
were buried on the E. bank of the Nile at el-Bersheh (see below). Nothing
nnw remains of the extensive temples of the ancient city. The French
Expedition found a hne Portia: of the Ptolemaic period, with two rows
of six columns each. - At Tuna ert7ebet, near Ashmuuén, are the extensive
necropoiis of the ancient city and tsrook-irtseriptiou [much dilapidate‘) of
Anlenophis w. o. 2'03).

Nearly opposite Récla, on the E. bank, amid palms of unusual
size and beauty, lies the village of 8htkh 'Abtuleh, to the E, of which
are the ruins of Antinoupolis, the town erected by Hadrian in
honour of his favourite Antinous. The handsome youth is said to
have drowned himself here, to fulftl the oracle which predicted a
heavy loss to the emperor and so to prevent a more serious disaster.
The remains of a temple of Ramses IL, the relic of an earlier
foundation on this site, may be traced. The vestiges ofpublio
buildings are now exceedingly scanty, though the French Expe-
dition saw a triumphal arch, a theatre, and streets flanked with
columnar The streets and ground-plans 0f the houses, however,
are still recognisable. The rooms were small and the walls were
made mainly of Nile bricks. There are some underground apart-
ments of flat Roman bricks, reached by stone staircases. Near the
ruins of one of the largest buildings lies a marble basin, which
must have had a circumference of' at least 23 ft. Among the palms
in the village lies a fine Corinthian 1rapital.

To the S. of Shékh 'Abivieh we reach (179 M.) Dér Abu Hermie
[Convent of' St. John), called also simply ed-Dér, a village in-
habited by about 2000 Copts. Near it is a ruined town of the
Christian epoch, known as et-3fedtneh. 0n the N. side of a ravine
in the hill behind the village are numerous ancient cave-like quar-
ries, which were fitted up at an early date as Christian chapels or
anelmrites’ dwellings. The largest Chapel, in which divine service
is held, is said to date from the time of the Empress Helena; it
contains paintings of saints and scenes from the New Testament, but
those in one of the side-tshapely (Raining of Lazarus, Marriage at
Game, etc.) are better. - Dér en-Nnkhleh (see below) may be
reached within 1/2 hr. from Dér Mm Henuis.

1811/2 M. Rtramiin, opposite which, on the E. bank, a little
way from the river, lies the Coptic village of Dér en-Nakhleh, the
’convent of the date-palms', also known as el-Bersheh. Beside a
Coptic cemetery to the E. of the latter begins a desert-ravine,
running N.W, and S.W., and named Wtuli en-Nukhleh or Wédi el-
