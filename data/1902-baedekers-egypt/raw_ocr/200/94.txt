HISTORY. 1xxxiii

Ramses IL (RamessE, 1324-1258 13.0.), the most celebrated 0f all
Egyptian kings. He waged tedious wars against the Hittites
[battle of Kadesh, p. 286), finally making a peace with them in
the let year of his reign (p. 252), which left Palestine proper
in the possession of the Egyptians, while N. Syria was acknow-
hedged to be tributary to the Hittites. Ramses developed an
extraordinary building activity in the course of his reign of
157 years. Perhaps one-half of all the extant temples date tYom
this reign; and the name of Ramses is found in nearly every
group of ruins in Egypt. His largest temples were those of Abu
Simbel (p. 370), Karnak (p.245), Luxor, theRamesseum, Abydos
(p. 218j, Memphis (p. 131), and Bubastis. His tomb is at Bibin
el-Multrk (p. 2701; his mummy at Gizeh (p. 80). Ramses n.

'is frequently idetttilled with the 'Phsraoh of the Oppression'
(Exod. i, 11). Of his numerous sons only one survived him, viz. -

Amenephthes (Merenptah), who carried on campaigns against the
Libyans and their allies, the peoples of the Mediterranean. His
mortuary temple is at Thebes (p. 287]; his grave at Bibin e1-
iiraliik o. 267).

Sethos IL was buried atBibéul el-MuhilrO. 270). His short reign was
followed by a period of anarchy, in which various claimants (Si-
Ptah, Amen-mess) foughtfor the throne. Decline ofthe kingdom.

*NX, DYNASTY (1200-1100 13.0.).

Set-nakht succeeded in restoring peace.

Ramses m. (Ramessé) conquered the Libyans and in two great
battles repelled an invasion of barbarians who approached from
Asia Minor by land and by water, threatening Egypt. His reign
of 33 years was thereafter an epoch of peace and quiet, in which
several large buildings (e.g. the temple at Medinet liabu,
p. 299) were erected. The king presented great gifts to the
gods, especially to the Thehau Ammon, who had been richly
endowed by former kings also. The high-priest ofAmmon gradu-
ally became the greatest power in the state. The King's tomb
is at Bibtn1 el-Mulilk (p. 268:); his mummy at Gizeh (p. 80).
His successors --

Ramses XV.-Ramses XII. gradually fell more and more under the
control of the priests of Ammon. Their tombs are at Bibin el-
Muhlk (pp. 264 et seq.) After the death of Ramses XII. ."

7. Period of Foreign Domination C1100-fm 13.0.).
XXI. DYNASTY (TANITES).
The empire now fell to pieces. At Tunis a new dynasty arose (Psa-
Ae'rmes, Arntnemapet), which put an end to the rule of the high-
