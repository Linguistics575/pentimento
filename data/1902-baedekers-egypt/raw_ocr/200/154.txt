HISTORY OF ART. cxliii

to the sky, which was conceived of as a thin flat covering held
above the earth by supports; and it was appropriately adorned with
stars upon a blue ground, while above the middle passage hovered
vultures, protecting the king as he passed along below. Not urt-
frequently, and especially in the temples of the Ptolemaio period,
the ceiling presented a picture of the entire celestial pantheon -
the gods and goddesses of the mouths and days, the planets, various
ooustssllations, end the goddess of the sky herself, on whose body
rested the boat of the sun. Similarly the pavement represented
the earth. Here (Le. on the bottom of the walls) we see flowers
blooming or long processions of the representatives of the names
and other divisions of the country, and of the river and canals,
bringing their characteristic products as offerings to the deities
of the temple. Egypt was traditionally regarded as divided into
two portions - a northern and a southern - and similarly the
entire world as represented in the temple was also regarded as con-
sisting of a N. half (to the right) and a S. halt (to the left). The
representatives of the N. appear on one side, those of the S. on the
other; and even in the ceremonial religious scenes on the wells
this distinction may frequently be traced. The entire temple-pre-
ninets were enclosed by a brick wall, the portal of which (generally
a pylon) was approached by an avenue of sphinxes or (43.9. in Thebes)
0f recumbent rams (krio-sphinxes). Within this wall stood also the
dwellings of the priests, besides storehouses and stables, so that
the temple proper, like an Arab mosque of to-day, stood in the
midst of a oomplexus of domestic buildings.

Owing to the great value of cultivable land in Egypt, Tombs
were not placed in the lower portions of the Nile valley, but in the
more elevated desert-regions, which7 moreover, being beyond the
reach of the inundation, were in any case better adapted for the
preservation of the dead. The most ancient graves were probably
simple holes, in which the mummies were laid, and over which
heaps of stones were piled by way of monument. Under the ANCIENT
EMPIRE these piles of stones were replaced ---in the case of the
tombs of the wealthy at least - by 80-tyalled MuÂ§tabus, which were
strong erections of limestone blocks or of bricks, with a rectangular
ground-plan and sloping walls. These originally consisted of a
single chamber only, regarded as the dwelling of the deceased and
inaccessible from without, A door-shaped stone or Stale, set in a.
shallow recess on the E. side, marked the spot that was regarded
as the entrance to the grave and to the realm of the dead. In front
of this the surviving relatives laid the food, drink, and other Dffeg-
ings to the dead upon the flat 8aerifeial Table, or recited their pray-
ers for the welfare of the departed. Under and after the 4th Dyn.
the chamber was made accessible from without, and the stale was
removed to the W. side. In the time of the 5th Dyn. the inner
chamber was enlarged and a number of additional rooms added. The
