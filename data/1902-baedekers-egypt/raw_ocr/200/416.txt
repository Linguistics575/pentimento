tn Sm. BITTER LAKES. 14. Route. 171

A pleasant walk may be taken along the Jebbek-avsnue, on the
Quai Méhérmyt-A1i, as far as the chateau of the Khedive and the
water-works. - In a public park in the Avenue Victoria (opposite
the former Villa Lesseps) several monuments found at Pithom
(p. 163) are preserved.

Group ofRemsasU. seated betweenthe gods Re and Atum: memorial
stone of Ramses IL, with sculptures and insuriptiuns; recumbent lion with
human head, dedicated by Ramses IL to Atum; naos with the figare of a
similar Iiun (sphinx), dedicated by Ramses II. in the temple of Pithom.

The best way of spending a few leisure hours here is to visit the
Khediuial Chalet, at the influx of the canal into Lake Timséh (near
the Canal Co.’e Hospital) and the hill of El- Bier (p. 170-, 1-2 hrs.;
donkey 1 fit).

CANAL JOURNEY TO SUEZ. After quitting Lake Timseh we pass
the foot of the Gebel Maryam, which an Arabian legend points out
as the place where Miriam, when smitten with leprosy for her dis-
approval of the marriage of Moses with an Ethidpian woman, spent
seven days, beyond the precincts of the camp of the Israelites
(Numbers, xii.), -- At the 85th kilometre is situated Tusfm, which
is easily recognised by the whitewashed dome of the tomb of a shiikh.
Excavations near 1.'usfln have led to the discovery of many interest-
ing fossil-remains of large animals belonging to the meioeene ter-
tiary formation, and pieces of fossil wood have also been found here
(comp. p. 110). - A little farther on (near the 90th kilometre) is
the cutting Which conducts the Canal through the rocky barrier of
the Scrapeum (comp. p. 165).

The Canal now enters the Large Basin of the Bitter Lakes.
Brugseh iileatities the Bitter Lakes with the Marah of the Bible
[Exoi EY. 23). At each end of the large basin rises an iron light-
house, 65 ft. in height. The water is of a bluish-green colour. The
banks are flat and sandy, but a little to the left rises the not un-
pieturesque range of the Gebel Genereh (p.164). The bed of the
Little Bitter Lake, Which we next traverse7 consists entirely of shell-
formations.

Near 8haltf et- Terdbeli (a station on the right, near the 139th
kilometre; see ll. IM) no less than 40,000 cubic yds. of limestone,
coloured red and brown with iron, had to be removed in the course
of the excavation of the Canal. This stone contained teeth and
vertebra, of sharks, bivalve shells, and remains of Bryozoa. In the
layer of sand above the limestone were found crocodiles’ teeth and
the remains of hippopotami and other large quailrupei1s. The
monument of Darius near 8haltaf is mentioned at p. 165.

We f1nal1y reach the Gulf of Suez, which is here so shallow that,
but for the Canal, it might be crossed on foot at low tide. It Jon-
tsins several islands. On the W. bank rise the workshop and
magazines of the Canal Company. Passengers are landed in steam-
launches.
