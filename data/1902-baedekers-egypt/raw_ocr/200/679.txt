371 Route 34. ABU-SIMBELi Great Temple.

Small Hypostyle Bail (P1. CO, which is 30 ft. broad and 25 ft.
deep. The mofis supported by four pillars. 0n the S. wall the king,
followed by his wife Nefret-ere holding two sistra, appears offering
incense before the sacred boat with the shrine of Ammon, which is
carried by priests; and on the N. wall is a similar scene before the
boat of Ré-Harmachis. Three doors lead from this hall into a long
narrow Tnsxsvnxsn CHAMBER. (Pl. D); and thence three other doors
admit to three apartments, thetwo side ones of which are very small.
The central apartment is the Sanctuary Cpl. E), containing an altar,
behind which are seated figures of the four rleities worshipped in
the temple - Ptah, Ammon-M, the deifityrl Ramses, and the hawk-
headed Re-Harmachis.

Immediately to the S. of the great temple is a small Rock Temple,
discovered in 1874 by a party of travellers including Miss Amelia
B. Edwards, the well-known writer, who has described it in her
interesting ‘Thousaud Miles up the Nile'. This is probably a Birth
House, such as are usually found beside temples of the Ptolemaic
period (p. 231). The firstebamber,probably built ofbrick and vault-
ed, has disappeared. The second ehamber, hewn in the rock, is the
Sanctuary, and is embellished with reliefs in excellent preservation.
