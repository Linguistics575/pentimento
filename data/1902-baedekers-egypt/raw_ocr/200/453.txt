198 Route 18. BENIHASAN. From Cam;

Egypt, not only on account aftheir remarkable architectural fea-
tures, but also for the manifold representations of scenes from the
dnmestic life of the early Egyptians.

The tombs, 39 in all, are arranged in a row in the rocket and are
now distinguished by conspicuous red numbers. The best examples are
secured by iron doors against the vandalism " the natives, from which
they had previously suffered. The tombs were most recently carefully
examined and cleared of rubbish by Mr. Percy E. Newherry, at the cost
of the Egypt Exploration Fund. Travellers whose time is limited ma
content themselves with a visit In the four chief tombs (Nos. 17, 15, 3, 2).
