bronze and various metallurgical processes, and perhaps also a
religious system of its own and even the art of writing. The net
result of the whole historical process was Egyptian civilization as it
existed under the Pharaohs.

Tan MODERN Earrrmxs. The population ofEgypt is composed
of the following ten different elements.

" The Fmass"r.ris (sing. felléh), the 'tmers' " 'peasants', with
whom must be reckoned the Coptic, peasants of Upper Egypt, form
the bulk of the population and may be regarded as the sinews of the
national strength. They are generally slightly above the middle
height; their bones, and particularly their skulls, are strong and
massive; and their wrists and ankles are powerful and somewhat
clumsy. In all these respects the follitiin, as well as their domestic
animals, contrast strongly with the inhabitants of the desert, the
feJhill and the Beduin differing from each other precisely in the
same points as their resPentive camels. Notwithstanding this large-
ness of frame, however, the fellith never grows fat. The woman and
girls are particularly remarkable for their slender build. The men
generally keep their 11sytu1s shaved, but the hair of the soldiers and
the long tresses ofthe girls, though always black and thick, is smooth
and wavy, seldom curly. The hair on the faces of the men is scantier
and more curly.

The chief peculiarity of the Egyptians is the remarkable close-
ness of their eyelashes on both lids, forming a dense, double, black
fringe, Which gives so animated an expression to their almond-
shaped eyes. The very ancient and still existing custom " blacken-
iug the edges of the eyelids with antimony Chem”), Which is said
to serve a sanitary purpose, contributes to enhance this natural
expression. The, eyebrows are always straight and smooth, never
bushy. The mouth is wide and thick-lipped, and very different
from that of the Bcduin or inhabitant of the oases. The high 1yheek-
bones,the receding forehead, the lowness of the bridge of the nose,
which is always distinctly separated from the forehead, and the
flatness " the nose itself', are the chief characteristics of the
Egyptian skull; but, as the jaws project less than those of most
of the other African coloured races, it has been assumed that the
skull is Asiatic, and not African in shape. The Egyptian peasantry
have a much darker complexion than their compatriots in the towns,
:uul their colour deepens as we proceed southwards , from the pale
brown of the inhabitant of the Delta to the dark bronze hue of the
Upper Egyptians. There is, however, a difference between the tint
of the Nubians and that of the Upper Egyptians, even where they
live in close cuntiguity, the former being more of a reddish-brown.
1n the ancient representations women are painted yellow and men
red, merely because the former were paler owing to their indoor life,
while the men were browned by labouring in the open air[Virchow).

The dwelling of the fellilt is of a miserably poor description,
