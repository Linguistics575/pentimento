stream. The large temple-buildings, which lay about 11/2 M. to the
N.E., hm e been almost entirely destroyed. - At Rimluit [el-Rezekat;
W. hank), 41/2 M. to the S.W. of Erment, is a necropolis of the
Middle Empire.

On the right bank, facing the curve which the Nile describes at
the village of Sendai and 11/2 M. inland, lies the village of Ttul, the
ancient Tuphium, with the remains of a small temple of the Ptol-
emies, dedicated to Mont, and a Christian basilica. Steles of the
12th and 13th Dyn. (now at Gizeh] were found at Salamiyeh, 2 M.
to the W. of Tim.

0n the W. bank, opposite a large island, rises [181/2 M.) a ridge
with two summits, known as Gebelén, Le. the 'two mountains', on
the higher of which is the tomb of a 8htkh Mam, beside the ruins
ofa temple of the Middle Empire. At the village of Gehelén, at
the W. base of the hill, lie the ruins of the ancient Crotaodilopoti8.

Extensive excavations carried on at this spot by Maspero yielded
sarcophagi of the Middle Empire and also numerous domestiu articles, etc.,
appropriate to persons of comparative poverty. la the vicinity are graves
of crocodiles. In the immediate saeighhuurhood also once stood the ancient
Aphroditespolix, also called Pathyris (House of Rather) from the Egyptian
name or Hathor, the goddess of the town. For some time this town was
the capital or a separate nome.

Beside the village of Dababiyeh (Debubieh), on the E. bank, are
quarries with interesting inscriptions.

20 M. (E. bank) Ma'alla, near which are tombs of the New Em-
pire. Farther on we pass At.ftus eVMaWna (W. bank; rail. station),
with large sugar-faetories, the ancient Atphynis (Egypt: Hcsfen).

The river-banks are pieturesquely clad with extensive groves of
palms, but the smoking chimneys of the sugar-futon'" interfere
with the beauty of the suenery.

36 M. Esneh (W. bank; rail. station, ll. 307), with the adjoining
town of Enyt, was even in antiquity one of the most important places
in Upper Egypt. Its Egyptian name was Te-snEt, whence came
the Coptic 8125 and the Arabic Esneh. The Greeks called it Lato-
polis, after the lawn a kind of fish venerated here. Esneh is now a
district capital with 15,000 inheb. (mostly Cams), and has post and
telegraph offiees, a druggist's shop, and numerous tyofrce-ho11ses.

The small Coptic Church is of no special interest. The old quay
on the bank of the Nile, near the Mutlmyeh, also contains some
fragmentary inscriptions of the Roman imperial epoch. To the N.
of the town lies a small Palace of the Khedive (Kagr Efendina), now
used as a government-school. In the vicinity is a gowerrunent-
hospital. --About 3/4 M. from the steamer-Play, and still to a large
extent buried in debris, is the chief object of interest, vis. the -
