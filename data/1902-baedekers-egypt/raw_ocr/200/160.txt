HISTORY OF ART. Cxlix

the ttgums are Greek in attitude and Egyptian in drapery, eoifture,
and adormneut. However valuable these may be for an appreciation
of Egyptian civilization at a late period, they certainly carry no
satisfaction to the eye intent upon artistic effects.

It is diftieult for the ordinary student to obtain a proper ap-
preciation of Egyptian Beliefs, owing to the peculiar style of draw-
Ing, which arose in prehistoric times and which was religiously
adhered to as a kind of sacred tradition ever afterwards, with but
few exceptions. The principle adopted was that of representing
each part of the body in the clearest and most faithful manner,
ignoring, however, the necessity of combining them harmoniously
as they appear to the eye in a complete figure. Thus we constantly
see reliefs with the faces in profile, but with the eyes drawn from
the front; or the shoulders are shown nearly facing us and the feet
and legs in profile; or, still more peculiarly, the back of the trunk
is drawn in full breadth and the front in profile. These peculiar-
ities recur in the works of other Oriental nations and even in those
of the Greeks of the early period, who, however, soon overcame the
defect. Another rule of Egyptian composition forbade the inter-
section of the figure by an outstretched arm or similar line; thus
in the case of a figure walking or stretching the hand to any ob-
ject it is invariably the foot or hand farthest from the spectator
that is extended. Ignorance of perspective and foreshortening is
also apparent, all the more on account of the evident effort to re-
present every separate object clearly and completely. Thus persons,
animals, eto., supposed to be behind others are depicted in rows above
them, and objects intended to be lying upon tables are depicted
standing above the tables. This primitive method was carried so
far that, in the representations of vessels with interior decoration,
the interior decoration is placed above the vessels. without any at-
tention to perspective. The principal personages in a representation
are indicated by the primitive distinction of being delineated on a
much larger scale than the other figures.

The art of drawing in Egypt was hampered from time immemor-
ial by a number of designs that were mechanically copied again
and again and that no one ventured to alter. Even the accompany-
ing inscriptions were held sacred from all changes, although they
were composed in an old-fashioned language that was almost a dead
tongue in the later periods. Among the subjects thus stereotyped
were scenes relating to the intercourse ot' the king with the gods (in
prayers or susritiees, etc.), those representing the king smiting his
enemies, the deceased receiving oirerihgs from his different estates,
the slaughtering of cattle for sse1ifios, and many others. In the
pictures of these subjects, therefore, we tind the most rigid adherence
to the above-mentioned rules. But beyond these the Egyptian artists
had a considerable tield for the exercise of their invention, and they
often displayed great hrillianey of imagination and observation.
