Tanya, the thriving capital of the province of Gharbtyeh,
which lies between the Rosetta and Damietta arms of the Nile,
with a population estimated at 57,000, possesses large public buildings, bazaars, and an extensive palace of the Khedive.

The Mosque of the Seiyid el-Bedawi is a modern building of 110

Seiyid Ahmed el- Bedawi, probably the most popular saint in Egypt,

obtained through the consular agent (fee 1-2 fix).

The catafalque of the saint is covered with red velvet adorned
with embroidery, and is enclosed by a handsome bronze railing. The
dome is still 11nfinished. One large and two small schools are connected with the mosque. The sebil, or tank, with the small medreseh
