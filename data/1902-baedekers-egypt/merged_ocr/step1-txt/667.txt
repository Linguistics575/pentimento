presentations of footprints, indicating the spots where the worshippers
stood The roof of the central portal may be reached from the W. tower.

No trace now remains of the court between the Pylon and the
vestibule. The facade of the VESTIBULE, or Pronaos (Pl, B), had
two columns with palm
c-'_'_ j -rc. ".frr: y'.". -rr'rr, connected with
' ill" the side-walls by means
of screens. Only the column to the left is now
standing; on the back of it
, E is a representation of the
god Bes, dancing and
playing the harp. On the
I.', walls are representations
of the king before the gods
of Dakkeh. On the E.
side-wall is an interesting picture, representing
the Pharaoh proffering to
the god Them a palette,

I which is borne by Isis
and Nephthys and is,
perhaps, symbolieal of
Osiris. Beliefs of an EthioPian king occur on the
rear-wall (at the top, to
the left). The whole ofthe
walls and the ceiling were
Painted over in Christian
times with sacred subjects, traces of which still
remain, notably on the E. wall (God the Father enthroned) and on
the N. wall (crucifixion). - The doorway in the rear-wall was
originally the main entrance to the temple. On the jambs are a
number of reliefs, one above the other: to the left, Philopator
sacrificing to Re, Khnum, and Isis; to the right, Philopator before
Ammon-mi, Harendotes, and Isis. Within the portal Augustus
offers the figure of Meat to the god Thout of Pnubs and to the lionheaded Tefnut.

CHAMBER C, which we enter next, is almost entirely demolished
and its floor is strewn with ruins. A staircase, on the right, led
hence to the roof of the temple in the imperial period; at the top
is a crypt in the thickness of the wall. - CHAMBER D, built by
Ergamenes, is also much ruined. Of its reliefs only one is interesting (on the right wall): Ergamenes pouring out wine for a god described as'Pharaoh of Senmet' (Bigeh) and for Anuket.'_., A small
door (of later construction) in the W. wall admits to Two CHAMBERS
