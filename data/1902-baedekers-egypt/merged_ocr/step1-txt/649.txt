path, opposite the ruin of the Hydreuma, stands a rock of sandstone
with numerous graffiti in Greek, Coptic, Arabic, Himyaritic, and
Sinaitie characters.

At a distance of about 2hrs. from the Hydreuma the rocks close
in and form a winding pass or gateway named Mutrafc es-Selrim. On
the Gebel Abu hWeh ('father of the elbow'), the rock at the entrance
to the pass, are more graffiti, older than those at Kasr el-Benét;
one of them contains the name of the heretical king Amenophis IV.
We now approach the fine rocky scenery through which the second
part of the Kosf-r route leads. In the distance, to the right, rise the
S. foot-hills of the r.nmmiirmit Mist, while Heater and in front are
the S.W. spurs. From this point onwards the roek-seenery is very
fine, Even the imposing granite cliffs of the Shellal islands and
the quarries of Assuin pale before the rocky mass of the Iianuninrit,
The outliers of the range consist of a yellow sandstone, followed by
the red'Nubian' sandstone, while the great central mass is Mmposed of granite.

Beyond the Mutrah es-Serin the hills again diverge. Among
them, to the N. of the caravan-route, lies a second Roman station,
with a filled-in well. About 2 hrs. farther on the hills of reddishyellow sandstone give place to loftier and almost black hills of
breccia, through the valley of which, now wide and now narrow, the
caravan winds its way. Beginning with the black mountains is the
Wadi Hammamat, the Rehenu Valley of the F. gyptians, who qualried its hard dark stone for statues and coi'iins in the most ancient
times. In 1 hr. more we reach the Bir /Tamrndrntit, a well 10 ft. in
diameter, with a stone coping. Near the well are the remains of n
toman wall, and five unfinished sarcophagi, some completely shattered. The quarries contain numerous Egyptian inscriptions. The
earliest expedition to 1Jarnmirnirt of which we have any knowledge
took place in the reign of King Essé (5th Dyu.) At a later period,
especially under the Middle Empire, the quarries were diligently
worked, and even under the New Empire they were in operation.
We hear of a great undertaking under Ramses IV. for the purpose
of procuring block: for the temple of Ammon at Thebes, in which
no fewer than 8368 workmen and soldiers were employed. The
quarries were worked under Darius, Xerxes, and Artaxerses also.

Just beyond the quarries the route turns from the N.E. to the
S. and passes the ruins of el-FaulklVr, an old mining site. Those
who wish to continue their journey to the Red Sea have still two
short days' marches ahead of them, the route leading through the
Wadi Riyrfe to the 321 et-Bthr (BET el-Inglis) and thence through
the Wadi Ambagi to _

1tottr or Kosseir, on the Arabian Gulf.1 (oser is now an unirnportant town of about 1600 inhab., with a quay, a wooden mole
400 ft. long, two mosques, several bazaars, government buildings,
and a large grain-magazine, belonging to the Egyptian government.
