women with their children (one carrying her children in a basket on her
back). One of the oxen has horns represented as arms, between which
is a negro suing for mercy. In the upper row we see the above-mentioned
tablet placed before the king, while the governor of Ethiopia is being
adorned with chains as a reward; farther on are rings of gold, chairs,
elephants' tusks, weapons, fans, and other articles brought as tribute;
negrues approach with their offerings (cattle, antelopes, a lion, etc.). In the second relief the king appears in his chariot dashing against the
negro foe, followed by Prince Amen-her-wnamf (above) and Prince Kheem-weset (below), each in his chariot. The negroes flet, to their village,
which lies among diimtslrms. A wounded negro is led by two comrades
to his wife and children, while another woman crouches over a life and
rocks a meal.

The reliefs on the right wall refer to the wars against the Syrians
and Libyans.

In the first scene (beginning to the right) the Pharaoh stands upon
two prostrate enemies, grasping three others (Syrians) by the hair, while
a prince leads fettered prisoners before him. - In the second relief the king
appears before a hostile fortress; on the battlements are men and women
suing for mercy (notice the woman holding her child by the arm); the
king seizes one of the enemy by the hair to kill him; below, one of the
royal princes is beating in the doors with an axe. - The third relief
shows the king in his chariot, dashing against the fleeing, Syrians; he has
seized two of the foes by the hair and raises his sword for the fatal stroke,
while two other captives are bound to his chariot. - In the next scene
the king smites a Libyan With a sickle-shaped sword, while his dog seizes
the foe. - In the fifth relief we see King Ramses IL enthroned beneath
a canopy, with his lion at his feet. His son Amen-her-kholjshef leads
three Semitic prisoners to him.

Three doors lead from the vestibule into the HYPOSTYLE HALL,
which was hewn in the rock. The smaller doors to the right and
left, though also dating from the reign of Ramses IL, were obviously
not made until after the wall had been covered with sculptures.
The ceiling of the hall is borne by two tinted columns, each with
four perpendicular faces on which were inscriptions. The mural
reliefs are well executed, but their subjects are of no special interest.
They represent the king before the gods and (on each side of the
side-doors) smiting his enemies (a Syrian and an Ethiopian). The SANCTUARY has similar reliefs. By the rear-wall are three
statues of the gods, now defaced beyond recognition. Both these

roek-eyharnbers also were used as Christian churches.
