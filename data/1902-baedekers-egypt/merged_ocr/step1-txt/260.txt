small bottles into which it is usually put contain only one drop. Then
follow the weavers and tailors.

The shttriea enMartityett is continued to the S. by the Sharia el-FalzMm'n (Pl. E, 3, o, in which is the bazaar for wares from Tunis and
Algiers. We first observe drug-stalla, and then magazines of light-coloured
woollen and other stuns, Arabian rugs, etc.

We now turn sharp to the right, then sharp to the left, and pursuing
the same direction, parallel with the E1-rhllturln street (see below), and
passing a number of shoemakers' stalls (batoiUfitrhi), we come to a broader
covered passage which we follow to the right for a few paces, and then
take the first lane to the left. This lane is continued under the name of
Shari'u er-lf-gritty, and is inhabited chietly by tailors, cloth-merchants,
and dealers in undressed wool. A short abrupt curve of this lane, to the
left, then brings us to the Shdri'a el-U.k.kdd'in.

The ASHRAFiYEH forms the first part of a long line of streets
leading to the S. and farther on taking successively the names of
GHI'JniYEE, Srsiauu EL-'AKKAuiN, and Stnrsrasgtzmr. In the Ghtrtyeh
we observe the medréseh and mausoleum of Sultan e1-t1hiirl (Pl. E,
3, o. The medréseh, to the W., was finished in 1503 and has a
minaret, inappropriately crowned with five modern dwarf cupolas.
The mausoleum, to the E., dating from 1504, has a modern and
tasteless wooden cupola and a restored ceiling (in the oratory). The
sultan, who fell in Syria (p. xeviij, is not buried here. Adjacent is
a well-preserved sebil, with kutttO (p. 37), projecting into the street.

To the E. of the Shura el-'Al.clsitdtn lies the quarter O' 2.Idah Kadam:
In its main street stands the ruinous'aloaas of Gamal ed-Din ez-Zahibl
(Pl. E, th president of the merchants, an interesting building of 1637
(adm, lst ticket as in the mosques, 2 pin.) Through a dilapidated passage
(dir'lceh) we reach the court of the Salamlik, with two well-prrserved
fagades. To the right is the door of the harem; to the left is a flight of
steps leading to the Takhta Bosh (p. clxv). The inscription on the moulding
gives lhe da'e of the building. The small door in the middle of the wall
(bdb es-sir) is the private door of the master of the house, leading to the
harem. Just to the left is a small chamber with Mushrabiyehs (p. elxvi),
whence the ladies of the harem could overlook the court and the Takhtabosh. In front is the Kim, recently restored. The rest of the house is
in ruins.

The Sukkariyeh (Pl. E, 4) forms the bazaar for sugar, dried
fruits (mutt), fish, candles, and similar wares. On the left is the
modern marble Seb'il of Mohammad Mu, and on the right the
Namiu el-Muaiyad (P1. D, E, 4), also known as Gdmi'a
el-Alimar ('the red'), a mosque dating from 1416. It was erected
by Sultan Shélch el-Malimiidi Muaiyad (p. xcvii), of the dynasty of
the Cireassian Mamelukes, who had been defeated in a rebellion
against Sultan Fang (p. 65), and vowed that he would build a
mosque on this site if he were released from prison.

The lately restored sanctuary, the two mausoleums, and the minarets
on the gates of the Bab ez-aneleh (see p. 48), the upper parts of which
were added in 1892, are the only remains of the original structure. The
three massive walls, intended to enclose three new liwisws, were erected
during a restoration in the second half of the 19th century.

The bronze gate at the entrance, the handsomest in Cairo,
originally belonged to the mosque of Sultan Hasan (p. 49), but
was bought for the new mosque for 500 dinars. We first enter a
