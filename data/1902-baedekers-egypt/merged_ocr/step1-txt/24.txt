RAILWAYS. xvii

the police, Payment of the boat-fare should not be made until the
passenger and his luggage are safe on deck. Before the heavier luggage
is lowered into the hold, the passenger should see it properly labelled.
All complaints should be addressed to the captain. On board the
foreign steamers a kind of military precision is affected, and questions
addressed to the officers or crew are apt to be answered very curtly.

Railways. The off1cial time-tables are published in the Indicateur des Chemins de fer de l'Egypte, which is sold for l pias. at the
chief railway-stations, and is also to be seen in the larger hotels.
The railway-carriages resemble those of France or Italy. First-class
passengers are permitted to take a reasonable quantity of small luggage with them into the carriages. The second-class carriages are
comfortable enough for day-journeys on the main routes (Alexandria
to Cairo, Cairo to Mange", Cairo to Suez, Cairo to Assuim), especially
by the express-trains; and their use effects a very considerable
saving in fares. But on branch-lines all travellers should take
first-class tickets. The third-class carriages are quite unsuited for
Europeans. The management of the traffie, except in the case of
express-trains, is not very satisfactory. The process of booking
luggage is especially slow and troublesome. The traveller should
therefore be at the station fully half-an-hour before the hour for
starting, as the ticket-clerks are entitled to close the oftiee ten
minutes before the departure of the train. The personal tickets are
printed in English and Arabic, the 1uggage-tielrets in Arabic only.
The luggage-tariff is somewhat complicated; 551bs. of hand-luggage
are free. - In hot weather the dust, which penetrates the carriages
even when the windows are closed, renders railway travelling in
Egypt exceedingly unpleasant. At the chief stations on the expressroutes there are Railway Buffets in the European style. At other
stations refreshments are brought to the carriage-windows (bargaining necessary; 3-5 oranges 1/2-1 pies.) The water offered for sale
is better abstained from.

Narrow Gauge Railways. The Egyptian Light Railways cover
the Delta and the Fayf1m (p. 174) with a network of lines, which,
though of little importance to the ordinary tourist, enable the explorer and the specialist to reach various remote sites with comparative ease. These lines do not yet appear in the qndieate11r',
but they are mentioned at the appropriate places in our text.

Electric Tramways ply in Alexandria and Cairo. They have
two classes; Europeans invariably patronize the first only.

Cabs have now quite superseded donkeys as the accepted means
of conveyance for Europeans in Cairo and Alexandria. Notwithstanding the official tariffs a special bargain should be made in every
case, especially for drives of any length. Few of the drivers understand any European language or are able to read the names of the
streets, while many of them know the various points only by names
of their own. But Arabs with a smattering of European languages
