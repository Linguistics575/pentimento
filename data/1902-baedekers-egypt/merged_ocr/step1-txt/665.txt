360 Route 32. GERF-HUSENi From Kazabsheh

Rock Temple of Gerf9uyhu The Egyptian name of this temple
was Per-Ptah, the'House of Ptah'. It was founded in the reign of
Ramses II. by Setaw, at that time governor of Ethiopia, and it was
dedicated to Ptah of Memphis and his fellow-gods. In front of
the rock-temple proper lay a
quadrangular COURT (P1. A),
D which was surrounded on
D three sides by covered colonnades. The E. colonnade had
lotus-columns, while the
others were supported by
is pillars, against which stood
colossal figures of Ramses II.
Two ofthe columns and five of
the pillars are still standing.
The W. side of the court is
bounded by the rock-Grade
of the temple, hewn to imitate a pylon and decorated in
a corresponding style. On the
left side of the portal is a relief of Ramses offering fresh
vegetables to Ptah. Passing
through this portal, we enter
a large HALL (P1. Ir), 45 ft.
square, hewn out of the rock.
The ceiling is supported by
six pillars, 28 ft. high, against
which are statues of the king
like those in the court. On
each side of the hall are
four recesses, each with the
king, in the guise of a god
under various titles, standing
between two deities.

king between Ammon-RE and Nut; 2. Between Horus, lord of Beki, and
Horus, 10rd ofBeheni; 3 Between Ptah-Tatenen and the cow-headed Hathor.

king between Khnum and Anukis; 2. between Nefertem and Satet; 3. between Horus, lord of Mem, and Isis; d. between Harmachis and Ews-os.

The reliefs on the walls of the hall, showing the king before various
deities, are unimportant.

The following ANTEROOM (P1. 0), about 36 ft. wide though only
17 ft. deep, is entered by a small door, on the left side of which is
the king before Ptah. The ceiling is supported by two square pillars.
