Temple ofAmmon. THEBES (E. BANK). 22. Route. 251

The columns are not monolithic but are built up out of semi drums.
The material is a reddish sandstone. Each of the twelve columns in the
two central rows is 11% ft. in diameter, and upwards of 33 ft. in circumference, i. e. as large rs Tr an's Column in Rome or the Vend√©me Column
in Paris. It requires six men with outstretched arms to span one of
these huge columns. Their height is 69 ft., that of the Capitals 11 ft.
The remaining 122 columns are each 42% k. in height and 61/2 ft. in
diameter.

The walls of the hall, the shafts of the columns, the abaei, and
the architrave are covered with inscriptions and reliefs, many of
which still retain their ancient colouring. These date from the
reigns of Sethos I. and Ramses 11., the former of whom embellished
the N. half of the hall (as far as the 10th row of columns), the
latter the S. half. Only a single column (the first in the 6th row)
hears the name of Ramses m., Ramses IV., Ramses TI.,
and Ramses X11. have also recorded their names. The scenes on
the columns show the king adoring the gods of Thebes. Those by
Sethos I. are in delicate flat relief, those by Ramses II. in radar
sunk relief.

Among the beautiful Beliefs of Bethe: f. (Walls a, b, c) the finest is that
on the E. half of the N. wall (Pl. c). We here see the king kneeling
before the god Harmachis, who is seated beneath a Canopy, while behind
the king stands the lion-headed goddess Wert-hekaw holding a palm
branch, from which hang various symbols. To the left the king kneels
beneath the sacred tree of Heliopolis, on whose leaves the god Thout is
inscribing his majesty's name.

On the outside of the N. and S. walls of this hall are *HISTORICAL
ReLIBFs of great importance, commemorating the victories of
Sethos 1. and Ramses ll: over the inhabitants of Palestine. There
is an exit-door on eavh side of the great hall (comp. the Plan), but
the visit to the reliefs is more conveniently made from the Central
Court (p. 263). - We first examine the reliefs on the *North Wall,

commemorating the victories of Sethos I.
