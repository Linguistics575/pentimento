rock, on which the midday sun pours its perpendicular rays, and
a gloomy solitude broods over the scene, which is of a sublimity
unmatched elsewhere in the Nile valley. Life seems almost nonexistent; a desert-plant waves here and there; jackals, wolves,
eagles, vultures, owls, bats, snakes, flies, and wasps are the only
inhabitants of the gorge.

After riding for about 3/4 hr. through the valley, we reach a
place where the road forks. The right branch leads to the seldomer
visited W. Valley (p. 277). The left branch leads to the
Bthkn el-Mumk proper. Beyond a small circular open space
we pass through a kind of rocky gateway and enter the E, Valley,
surrounded by massive rocks and the openings of several lateral
ravines. The tombs occur both in the main valley and in its

branches.

The best plan is to visit first the tombs of Suites l. (No. 17) and
Ramses III. Go. li), and then, if suftlcient energy remains, Nos 6, i), & 35
The other temhs are of interest to specialists only. We describe the
tombs in the numerical order.

On the right (WO side of the path:
No. f. Tomb ofRamses X., Yet-Amon, offering nothing of special
interest. A Creek inscription proves that it was known and accessible in Greek times.

No. 2. Tomb of Ramses w. An ancient staircase, with an inclined plane in the centre and low steps at the sides, leads to the
entrance. Above the door are Isis and Nephthys, worshipping the
solar disk, in which stand the ram-headed sun-god and a scarabaeus.
On the right wall, behind the door, are two Copts raising their hands
in prayer; an inscription indicates one of these as'Apa Ammonios,

the martyr'.

To the left,' in Common I, appears the king worshipping the hawkheaded Harmachis. The other, walls of this and the following Common li
are adorned with texts and figures of gods from the'praising of "( p. 263).
CORRIDOR 111 shows texts and pictures of gods and spirits from the'Sun's
Journey in the Underworld' (p. 263). ANTEROOM IV has texts from the
Book of the Dead, the chief being the 125th chapter, which contains the
Justification of the deceased. - Room V, the main chamber, contains the
granite sarcophagus. which is 10 ft. long, 6 ft. broad, and 71/2 ft. high,
and is adorned with inscriptions and designs. On the Left Walls are
shown the first two chapters of the'Book of the Portals' (p. 263). Chapter I
(beginning at the entrance) shows the portal guarded by the serpent Set,
Next follows the first region of the underworld. In the Middle Home the
boat, in which the Ban-god stands beneath a canopy with a coiled serpent
above it; before him kneels the king, presenting to him an image of
Meat. Four inhabitants of the underworld-tow the boat by a cord, while
various gods come to meet it. In the Upper Panel appear the blessed
dead, while in the Lower Panel are the condemned, some lying on the
ground dead, others fettered, while the god Arum watches them, leaning on his staff. Chapter 11 shows the the gate of the second region,
guarded by the serpent Ekehi. In the Middle appears the boat of
the sun-god, towed by 8 men; the cord passes through a hollow beam
with a bull's head at each end, on which rest 7 small figures of gods,
while 8 gods,'the bearers of the gods', carry the beam on their shoulders. In the Upper Panel we see various gods in their dwellings, the
