to Assmt. MA'ABUEH. Its. AI I

220 M. Monfalitt (rail. stat., p. 191) lies on the W. bank close
to the river, which must have made great eneroaehments here since
the end of the 18th century. Between Monfalt1t and Assitlt (26 M.
by river, only 17 M. by land) the Nile makes many curves.

Ma'ahdeh, a small village on the E. bank, lies on a narrow
strip of fertile land between the Nile and the S. end of the rocky
Gebel Abu Féda. The hills to the N.E. of Ma'abdeh contain tombs
of the Early Empire. To the S. is the Gebel Kumeh, with a quarry
exhausted in the reign of Sethos II. (inscription).

About 3% M. to the N.E., on the plateau of the Arabian hills, is
the sn- called Crocodile Grotto, in which a large number of mummies of
crocodiles were found, besides human mummies and a celebrated papyrus
MS. containing fragments of Homer's Iliad. The expedition is not worth
the trouble, as practically nothing is to be seen except the charred remains
of the mummies of crocodiles. - To the S.E. of Ma'abdeh lies the village
of (Arab e1'Agyat with tombs and quarries.

On the E. bank are (227 M.) the three villages of Beni Mo-.
hammad. To the N.E. of these, on the N. verge of a large and
fertile plain that extends S. to almost opposite Assit1t, lies the Coptic
village Dtr el- Gebrai (Gabmwi), containing a Greekinseription (discovered by MLHarris) in the form of a dedication of the Lusitanian
Cohort, which served under Diocletian and Maximian, to Zeus,
Hercules, and Nike (Victoria). In the Gebel Mardg, a ridge about
"/2111. distant, are numerous roek-tombs belonging to princes and
grandees of the home of the'Serpent Mountain'.

These tombs, mostly dating from the close of the Early Empire, are
divided into a N. E. and a S W. group, the former _, 80 tomm
"with inscriptions and representations), the latter about 4O (12 with representations). The most interesting are two of the S. E. group, situated
above the village of Dér el. Gehmi belonging to Thaw and Elm (11th Dyn.),
princes of the home of the Serpent Noantal n and of the meme of Abydos.
Like the graves of Benihasan, these tombs contain interesting representations of hamdieraftrurier1, harv est- ecenes fishing and hunting scenes, ere.

Above Beni Mohammed the Nile makes several great bends and
is divided into two arms by the large island Seilret Behtp. On the
E. arm lies (233 M.) Iilbnith (Abnoub), with 5800inhab. (4800 Gupts)
and fine palm-groves. The mountains on the E. bank now recede,
and the foot-hills of the Libyan chain approach the river, which is
here barred by the Dam of Assit1t (Assiout Barrage) now under
construction, an imposing work intended to regulate the irrigation
of the provinces of Assitat, Minyeh, and Benisuef. It consists of
eight sections, the first and last of which have three arches and a
sluice, while the others have nine arches each. As at the Barrage
below Cairo o. ill), each arch can be shut by an iron door. The
dam is crossed by a carriage-road .---. Immediately above the weir,
on the W. bank, is the efflux of the Ibrahimiyeh Canal, the S. prolongation of the Baht Yt1suf (p. 210).

We land at pit M.) el-Hamm, the palm- -enclosed harbour of
Assiut. Anembanked road, sh'aded by fine trees, leads past the station
and handsome private and public buildings to the town in 1/4 hr.
