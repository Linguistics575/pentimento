temple (the so-called Promenoir) to the E., i.e. behind the main
temple, and surrounded the whole structure with a girdle-wall,
against the inner side of which a number of small chambers were
built. The front ofthe temple was, however, left unaltered until the
reign of Amenophis 111., who raised a new pylon (No. 111) in front
of the pylon (No. IV) of Thutmosis III. All these buildings were
thrown into the shade by the erections under the 19th Dynasty.
Ramses I. raised still another pylon (No. II) and Sethos I. and
Ramses II. created between this fourth pylon and the pylon of
Amenophis III. that gigantic Hypostyle Hall, which has remained
ever since as one of the chief wonders of Egyptian architecture.
Ramses II. also caused a second girdle-wall to be built, outside
the wall of Thutmosis 111. The temple now seemed to have received
its final form. The temples of Sethos II. and Ramses III. were
separate buildings, erected in front of the facade of the great
sanctuary. But the Libyan kings of Bubastis (22nd Dyn.) revived
the traditions of the ancient Pharaohs. A huge colonnaded court,
incorporating half of the temple of Ramses III., was built in front of
the pylon of Ramses I. Taharka, the Ethiopian (25th Dyn.), afterwards reared some colossal columns for some unknown purpose in
this court. The temple was now left unaltered for some time, but
under the Ptolemies it underwent fresh alterations and received its
final great pylon (No. I). Thereafter it gradually fell into ruin; and
the Roman emperors were never tempted to restore the abandoned
and ruinous temple.

The *First Pylon is still 124 yds. wide, with walls 16 ft. thick
and 1421/2 ft. high. This gigantic portal, which dates from the
Ptolemies, was never completed; and portions of the scaffolding,
constructed of crude bricks, remain to this day. A magnificent
view is enjoyed from the top, which is reached by a staircase on
the N. tower. It is useful and interesting to seek to identify, from
this point of vantage, with the aid of the accompanying plan, the
various columns, obelisks, and pillars. This is comparatively easy
as regards the nearer (W) portion of the temple; but the more
distant portions, from among which obelisks tower, are partly out
of sight, and are partly so foreshortened by distance, that they appear to form one confused system of ruins.

Before we enter the great court, an inscription on the door of the
pylon, to our right as we enter, merits notice. This was placed here by
the savants who accompanied the army of Napoleon to Egypt, and records
the latitude and longitude of the chief temples of the Pharaohs as calculated by them. - Opposite the French table an Italian learned society
(Feb. 9, 1841) erected another showing the variation of the compass
(declinazione dell' ago magnetico) as 1056".

The Nrreat Court, built by the rulers of the 22nd Dynasty, is
275 ft. deep and 338 ft. wide, and covers an area of 9755 sq. yds.
