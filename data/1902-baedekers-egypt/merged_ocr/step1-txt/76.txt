DOCTRINES OF EL-ISLAM. m

the promised Paraclete, the Comforter (St. John xiv. 16), the last
and greatest of the prophets; but he does not profess to be entirely
free from minor sins. He eonfirms previous revelations, but his
appearance has superseded them. His whole doctrine is a miracle,
and it therefore does not require to be eonfirmed by special miracles.
After his death, however, a number of miracles were attributed to
him, and a position was assigned to him as the principal mediator
between God and man. The apotheosis of human beings is, moreover, an idea foreign to the Semitic mind, and it was the Persians
who first elevated'Ali and the imams (literally reciters of prayers)
who succeeded him to the rank of supernatural beings.

The KORAN itself was early believed to be of entirely supernatural origin. The name signifies'rehearsal', or'reading', and
the book is divided into chapters called 8iirehs. The first revelation
vouohsafed to the Prophet took place in the'blessed night' in the
year 609. With many interruptions, the'sending down' of the
Koran extended over twenty-three years, until the whole book,
which had already existed on'well-preserved tables' in heaven,
was in the prophet's possession. During the time of the Abbaside
khalifs it was a matter of the keenest controversy whether the Koran
was created or uncreated. (The Oriental Christians have likewise
always manifested a great taste for subtle dogmatic questions, such
as the Procession of the Holy Ghost.) The earlier, or Meooan St1rehs,
which on account of their brevity are placed at the end of the book,
are characterised by great freshness and vigour of style. They arein
rhyme, but only partially poetic in form. In the longer St1rehs ofa
later period the style is more studied and the narrative often
tedious. The Koran is nevertheless regarded as the masterpiece of
Arabic literature. The prayers of the Muslims consist almost exclusively "passages from it, although they are ignorant of its real
meaning. Even by the early commentators much of the Koran was
imperfectly understood, for Mohammed, although extremely proud
of his Arabio Book', was very partial to the use of all kinds of
foreign words. The translation of the Koran being prohibited, Persian, Turkish, and Indian children learn it entirely by rote.

The Koran has been translated into English, French, German, Italian,
and Latin. The best English translations are those of Sale [ 1734; with
a'preliminary discourse" and copious notes), ed. by Rev. E. M. Wherry,
1882-36,'vols., and also published in a cheap form by Messrs Wame a (10.,
London); Radwell (London, 1861:, 2nd ed., 1878) l and Palmer (London, 1880).

(3). FUTURE STATE AND PREDESTINATION. The doctrine of the
resurrection has been grossly corrupted by the Koran and by subsequent tradition; but its main features have doubtless been borrowed from the Christians, as has also the appearance of Antichrist,
and the part to be played by Christ at the Last Day. On that day
Christ will establish El-Islam as the religion of the world. With
him will re-appear El-Mahdi, the twelfth Imim (p. lxxii), and
the beast of the earth o. lxiii), while the peoples of Gog and
