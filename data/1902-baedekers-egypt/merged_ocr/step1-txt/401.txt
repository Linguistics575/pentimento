Zalctisstle, a thriving, semi-European town, lies on a branch of the
Fresh Water Canal (see below) and on the Muta (Moss) Canal (the
ancient Tanite arm of the Nile, p. 156). It is the capital of the E.
province of Sherlityeh and seat of a Mudir, and contains 35,700 inhabitants. The situation of Zalrizils, in the midst of a fertile tract
watered by several canals, and connected with the richest districts
of the Delta, is extremely favourable, and it is a rapidly improving
place. Zalpizilf forms the chief centre of the Egyptian cotton and
grain trade. Many European merchants have offices here, and the
large eotton-faetories give the place an almost European appearance.
An Arab market is held here every Tuesday.

Zaliizils is the junction for braneh-railways to Fuviur (p. 23
and to Abu Eebtr-Mttttlra, etc. (see p. 156). Narrow-gauge railway to J7inbelfiwtn (p. 157).

In the vicinity, near Tell Basta, 1,11 hr. to the s., lie the ruins of
the ancient Bubastis (Egyptian Perrlluxti; the Pibeseth of Ezekiel xxx. 17),
the capital of the Bubastite nome. The remains of the temple of Bastet,
the patron-goddess of the town, were excavated in 1887-89 by the Egyptologist Neville, at the expense of the Egypt Exploration Fund; but they
are in too ruinous a state to repay a visit, The temple, begun by the
pyramid-builders Kheops and Khephren, underwent frequent alterations
at the hands of Ramses II. and other later kings, but owed its final
form to the monarchs of the 22nd Dyn., who resided at Bubastis, and to
Nektanebés (Nekht-rltustrl1tmt). At this period it consisted of four large
halls, of an aggregate length of Boo feet; and in these were celebrated
the joyous and licentious festivals in honour of Bastet.'When the Egyptians travel to Bubastis', says Herodotus,'they do so in this manner. Men
and women sail together, and in each boat there are many persons of
both sexes. Some of the women make a noise with rattles, and some of
the men blow pipes during the whole journey, while the other men and
women sing and clap their hands. If they pass a town on the way, they
lay to, and some of the women land and shout and mock at the women
of the place, while others dance and make a disturbance. They do this
at every town that lies on the Nile; and when they arrive at Bubastis
they begin the festival with great saeriflees, and on this occasion more
wine is consumed than during the whole of the rest of the year. Alt the
people of both sexes, except the children1 make a pilgrimage thither,
about 700,000 persons in all, as the Egyptians assert.'

Beyond the next stations, (541/2 M.) Aim el-Akhdar and (55 M.)
Abu Hammad (p. 157) the railway skirts the Fresh Water or Isma" iltyeh Canal. The fertile tract which we now traverse is part of
the Goshen of the Bible. During the Turkish régime it fell into a
miserable condition, and at the beginning of the century afforded
a very scanty subsistence to barely 4000 Arabs; but the cultivation
was so rapidly improved by means of the fresh-water canal that it
now supports upwards of 12,000 prosperous farmers and peasants.
Beyond the canal, on the right, is a fertile strip, behind which rise
the desert hills.
