C30-40,00WO. But in spite of all its dilapidation, the huge proportions of the building, combined with the masterly execution of
the details, produce an impression of great majesty.

On leaving this mosque, we proceed to the S.E. (right) to the
circular PLACE RUMI'SLEH (P1. E, 6), from which the Mecca pilgrimage
starts (p.111v), and to the Médan Mohammed'Ali or Place Méhémet Ali, about 650 yds. in length. From the middle of the'Place',
opposite the old Helw'an station (Ga1-e de Midan), we enjoy a splendid
*View of the Mosque of Mohammed'Ali (see below).

From the E. side of the Ruméleh a broad carriage-road, passing
two mosques (on the left: the 67rmi'a el-j1fayrnthih/eli, and beyond
it the dei'a Emir Akhtar, with a decaying minaret), and afford-.
ing a view of the Tombs of the Khalifs to the left, ascends in
windings to the Citadel. A shorter and steeper route, which may
be ascended on donkey-back, diverges to the right near the beginning of the carriage-road, passing through the Bdh el-'Asab,
flanked with its huge towers. It was in this narrow and crooked
lane, enclosed by lofty walls, and formerly the chief approach to
the citadel, that the massacre of the Mamelukes took place on 1st
March, 1811, by order of Mohammed'Ali (13. mix). Amin Bey,
the only one who survived, effected his escape by making his horse
leap into the moat, through a gap in the wall.

The Citadel (El-Kal'a; Pl. E, F, B) was erected in 1166 by
Saladin (p. 32), with stones taken, according to Arabian historians, from the small pyramids at Gizeh. Of the original structure,
however, nothing now remains except the outer E. wall aild a few
towers in the interior. Although the fortress commands the city, its
site is unfavourable in respect that it is itself completely commanded by the heights of the Molrat.tam, rising above it immediately to the S.; thus in 1805 Mohammed rAli was enabled, by
means of a battery planted on the Grebe ] (p.108), to compel
Khurshid Pasha to surrender the Citadel.

We enter the inner court of the Citadel by the Bab el-theld
CPI. F, 6;'New Gate' ], and observe on a terrace before us the
Nliunira Mohammed'Ali (P1. E, 6), the'Alabaster Mosque', the
lofty and graceful minarets of which are so conspicuous from a-distance as to form one of the landmarks of Cairo. The building was
begun by Mohammed'Ali, the founder of the present Egyptian
dynasty, 011 the site of a palace which was blown up in 1824; and
in 1857 it was completed in its present form by Sa'id Pasha (p. C).
The architect was the Greek YiisufBoshna of Constantinople, who,
aided by Greek foremen, built it on the model of the Nuri Osmaniyeh mosque at Constantinople. The columns are built, and the
walls incrusted, with yellow alabaster obtained from the quarries
near Beni.surif.

The Entrance (P1. O), near the centre of the N. side, leads
