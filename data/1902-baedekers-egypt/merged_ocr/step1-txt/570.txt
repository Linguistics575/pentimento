Dér el-ba.hri. THEBES (W.BANK). N. Route. 283

while priests offer incense or perform other rites. On the end-wall is represented the door that led into the kingdom of the dead.

In the W. wall of the Upper Court is a series of RECESSES, a1ternately large and small, containing representations of Thutmo818 III. and Makere in presence of the gods. In the middle is the
entrance to the Sanctuary. In the left corner opens the small
Room 7 1n the right the so-called Hall of Ammon, both of which
may be omitted by hurried visitors.

ROOM -.H: The ceiling is well preserved. On the right wall appears
Amyon-Re 1n front of an altar, which replaces the eCaced figure of Makere. Behmel the altar is the queen's guardian spirit. On the rear-wall
are Thutmosis III. and Thctmosis I. (substituted for Makere) offering
clothes to Amman. On the left Thutmosis II. (substituted for Makere)
offers sacred oil to the ithyphallic Ammon.

HALL "Annex. Part of the ceiling, decorated with stars on a blue
ground, still remains. On the left side-wall we observe MakerE pacing
Out the temple-preeinets, before Ammon, before the ithyphallic AmmonW1n, and before the enthroned Ammon. On the right wall is Thutmosis m.
before_ these same gods. On the end-wall is Thutmosis II. (originally
Maker-c) before Ammon. The figures of the gods here were defaced by
Amenophis IV. and were not replaced at the restoration under Ramses II.

A granite Portal, reached by an approach dating from the Ptolemaic period, with balustrades, forms the entrance to the SANCTUARY.
The three chambers (P1. E, F, G) are unfortunately much damaged.
The first two have vaulted ceilings and are adjoined by recesses. The
representations in the Ist Chamber (P1. E) show Makere (sometimes
Thutmosis III.) saerifieing to various deities, among whom figures

the deceased Thutmosis II.

On the upper part of the right wall is a noteworthy scene: Makere,
Thutmosis 111., and the princess Ranofru sacrifice to the boat of Amman, behind which stood Thutmosis I. with his consort Ahmes, and their
little daughter Bitnofru. A similar scene was represented above the
recess (P1. a) on the left wall; the kneeling Thutmosis m. and Princess
Ranofru may still be distinguished.

The 3rd Room (Pl. G) was restored under Euergetes II. The
reliefs and inscriptions of this late period compare very unfavourably with the masterly sculptures of Makere.

In the rocks to the N. of the central court is the tomb of 2r'atru, a
queen of the Middle Empire. The passage, only about 3ft. high, leads
into a sepulchral chamber, covered with inscriptions. This tomb (explored
by Ebers) was probably covered up during the building of the temple. Near the keeper's house (p. 278) is a large shaft-tomb (perhaps of the
Middle Kingdom), excavated by Carter in 1900.

A few yards to the N. of the Lower Court is the square well-shaft,
forming the entrance to the common Tomb of the Theban Priests, which
was discovered in 1891 by Grébaut, and which yielded a rich antiquarian
booty now in the Museum of Gizeh (p. 100).

The Shaft in which the famous discovery of Rings' Mummies was
made in 1881 (p. 101) is now filled up. It lies less than 1/2 M. to the S.
of the temple of Dér el-ballri.

A short distance to the E. of the temple of Der is1-bal.sri, in the
direction of the temple of Ifurna, we reach a valley between the hill
of Shékh'Abd e1-lfurna on the S. and the cliffs of the Dér el-bahri
valley on the N. and E. Here lies the necropolis known by the Arabs
