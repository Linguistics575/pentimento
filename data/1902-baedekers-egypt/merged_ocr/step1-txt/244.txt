5111 Dar. Foreman: Mosques of *Et-Azhar (p. 13) and /rosiin (p £12)
The mosque of El-Azhar should not be visited on a Friday, as there is
no teaching on that day, and the traveller would thus miss one of the
chief attractions. Spare time may be spent in the Bazaars (p. 42). -Afternoon (by carriage or electric tramway }: Island of quia (p. 69) and Old

Cabral el- -ffGira, or Maser el-lrdliira, or simply Maw or Mist is
situated in 300 6' N. latitude, and "26' E. longitude on the
right bank of the Nile, about 12 M. to the S. of the so-called'cow's
belly', the point where the stream divides into the Rosetta and Damietta arms. It has not inaptly been styled'the diamond stud on
the handle of the fan of the Delta'. On the E. side of the city, which
covers an area of about 11 square miles, rise the barren, reddish
cliffs of the Mokattam Hills o. 108 ], about 650 ft. in height, Which
form the commencement of the eastern desert. The city has extended so much towards the west of late years that it now reaches
the bank of the river and has entirely absorbed Bt1lit (p. 75), which
was formerly its harbour.
