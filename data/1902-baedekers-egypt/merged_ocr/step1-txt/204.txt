I. Approaches to Egypt.

The time-iables and handbooks of the various steamship companies
(see below) give full information both as to the direct searrontes from
England and as to the steamers from Mediterranean ports. Particulars
of the overland routes (see p. 2) from England to the Mediterranean
will be found in Bvadshaui's Continental Railway Guide (2s.), the advertisement pages of whieh also contain some shipping information. The'P. & 0.1
Co. issues tickets for the sea-route out and the overland route home, or
vice versd. Heavy baggage should in all cases, if possible, be sent round
by steamer. - Travellers from the United States may sail direct from
New York to Naples "Genoa by German steamer (fhst-elass only) and
proceed thence by one of the steamers mentioned at pp. Ti,

Travellers who desire to return from Egypt by one of the larger mail
lines should secure a berth as soon as possible by applying to the shipping offices in Cairo (p. 26), as these steamers are apt to be crowded
from February to April inclusive. Information as to available accommodation is telegraphed from Aden to Cairo. The days and hours given
below for the arrival and sailing of the steamers are approximate only,
except in the case of the terminal ports. At intermediate ports the steamers
'are sometimes behind itinerary time, and not unfrequently a day or two
in advance. In either case they proceed at once on their voyage.

Alexandria, the chief seaport of Egypt, is regularly visited by British,
French, Austrian, Italian, Russian, Greek, and Egyptian steamers. Port
tla'td, on the Suez Canal, is touched at by the vessels of the great
Australian, Asiatic, and East African lines. - Cairo may be reached by
rail in 31/2 hrs. from Alexandria, and in 7 hrs. from Port Se'id. The railway from Port Sa'id is a narrow-gauge line as far as Isma'iliya, where
carriages must be changed (p. IO; 1 hour's halt).

Alexandria is almost 30Â° E. of Greenwich, and its time is 1 hr. 59 min.
In advance of Greenwich time; that of Cairo is 2hrs. 5 min. and that
of Port 8aetil 2 hrs. 10 min. in advance of Greenwich.'Central Europe'
time (observed on German and Italian railways, ete.) is t hr. in advance
of Greenwich.

Owing to the advance in the price of coal, a surtax of 10 per cent is
at present charged on sea-passage fares to Egypt.
