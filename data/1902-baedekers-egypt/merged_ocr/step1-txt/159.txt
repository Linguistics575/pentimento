oxlviii HISTORY OF ART.

laid upon a faithful reproduction of the face; the rest of the body,
especially the hands and feet, are conventionally and superfieially
treated. The artist frequently imparted a curiously striking effect
to his statue by inserting eyes of quartz, with a silver or copper stud
to represent the pupil. Few STATUES OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE can
stand comparison with the earlier masterpieces. The tendency to
idealize the countenance frequently makes itself apparent (e.g. in
the fine statue of Usertesen I. from Lisht, p. 86). During this period
the custom had again arisen of using hard granite as well as limestone - a custom which at least afforded the artist an opportunity of
exhibiting his technical skill to the best advantage. Masterpieces
of sculpture were, however, not wanting, as is proved, for example
by the tine statue of Amenemhet 111. at Gizeh (p. 85), and by the
statues and sphinxes which were formerly attributed to the Hyksos,
but which probably also represent Amenemhet III. or other kings
of the close of the 12th Dyn. (p. 86).

The comparatively large number of STATUES OF The NEW EMPIRE which have come down to us betray a decline in art, although
most of them, it is true, were intended merely for decorative purposes. In most cases the artists have abandoned the attempt to
produce a faithful portrait, devoting their main efforts to the representation of the coiffure, the ornaments, and the flowing garments then fashionable. At the same time examples of incomparable verisimilitude, worthy to rank with the best productions of
the earlier period, are not wanting. Among these may be mentioned
the fine head of King Haremheb and the head of a queen, both in
the Museum at Gizeh (Nos. 197, 198; p. 88), besides a few other
specimens in European museums.

After the 20th Dyn. art steadily declined, until the reign of the
Ethiopian monarchs, when it again revived under the inspiration of
the models of the Ancient Empire. With the 26th Dyn. began a later
period of bloom, which has justly been styled the period of the
EGYPTIAN RENAISSANCE (p. lxxxv). The prevalent tendency at this
epoch was towards a careful study of portraiture, and it produced
some extraordinarily good work, especially in the portraits of baldheaded priests, in which the characteristic features are indicated
in a masterly manner, while the less significant details are ignored,
The best specimens of this great style of art are now in Berlin, and
there are unfortunately no examples of it in the Gizeh Museum,
where the traveller will find only insipid productions of the Egyptian
Renaissance, imitating without exception the models of an earlier
period - Slight traces of Greek infHenee may be detected in these
realistic works, and under the Ptolemies these traces become more
and more distinct. Side by side with purely Greek works Cirhief1y
in Alexandria) and purely Egyptian works, the sculptors of which
clung anxiously and mechanically to the ancient style, we meet
with specimens of a peculiar hybrid Graeco-Egyptian style, in which
