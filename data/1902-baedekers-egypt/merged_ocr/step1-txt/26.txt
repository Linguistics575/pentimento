POST AND TELEGRAPH OFFICES xix

In other towns the hotels are much interior. The more remote
a place is from the ordinary track of European travellers, the poorer
the inns are according to European ideas; and houses bearing most
pretentious names are often nothing more than miserable inns.

(5). Post and Telegraph Offices.

The Egyptian Postal System (pp. 5, 26) is admirably organised,
not only in all the principal towns but also in the smaller towns of
the Delta and Upper Egypt. The offieials are civil and attentive.
The addresses of letters destined for Egypt should always be written
very distinctly (particularly the initial letters). They had better be
directed to the hotel at which the traveller intends to stay, or the
traveller may leave his local address at the Cairo Post Office and
have his letters forwarded thence. On leaving for Upper Egypt
travellers should notify the postal authorities at Cairo, so that letters may be punctually forwarded; passengers by the Nile steamers
may have their correspondence looked after by the steamboat company. - Registered Letters not addressed to a hotel are not delivered
to the addressee unless he gets a resident or the consular kavass
(p. xx) to testify to his identity; those addressed to a hotel are
delivered on presentation of the otNial notifieation of their arrival,
bearing the stamp of the hotel. - The Postage for letters within
Egypt is 5 mil1iismes; to other countries in the Postal Union 10 milliemes; foreign Post Cards, 4 milliémes. - Parcels not exceeding
11 lbs. in weight may be sent to the countries of the Union for
