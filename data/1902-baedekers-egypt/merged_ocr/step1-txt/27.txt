hX CONSULATES.

(6). Public Safety. Consulates. Courts of Justice.

Public Safety. The authority of the Khedive is so well established throughout the whole of Egypt that travellers are as safe as
in Europe. Weapons for self-defence are an unnecessary encumbrance. - Fowling-pieces may be purchased in Cairo or they may
be had for hire at the principal hotels. Sportsmen who bring their
own guns will find it very troublesome to clear them at the eustomhouse, and cartridges also are contraband (p. xv). Ammunition (ineluding Lefaucheux cartridges) may be bought in Cairo, but not
higher up, where only coarse gun-powder can be obtained.

Consulates. Consuls in the East enjoy the same privilege of
exterritoriality as ambassadors in other countries. On public occasions they are attended by kavasses, or armed consular officers. A
distinction is sometimes made between professional C'eonsules
missi') and commercial consuls; and there are consuls general (who
act also as political agents), consuls, vice-consuls, and consular
agents, possessing various degrees of authority. In all cases of emergency the traveller should apply for advice to the nearest consul
of his country.

Courts of Justice. In place of the exclusive consular jurisdiction to which foreigners were formerly liable, a system of Mixed
Tribunals was established in 1876. The judges consist of natives
and foreigners (the latter generally appointed by the Khedive from
qualified offieials nominated by the Great Powers), who give their
verdicts in accordance with Egyptian law, founded on that ofl'rance
and Italy. Cases in which the Khedive himself and the Egyptian
government are concerned are also tried before this tribunal, which
includes courts of tirst and second instance. The courts of the first
instance are at Cairo, Alexandria, and Msns.tira, and there is a delegation at Port Said. The appeal-court is at Alexandria. Lists of
qualified barristers are exhibited in the anterooms of the courts. Cases between natives, and all criminal cases, are tried by the Native
Courts, established in 1884. Courts of the first instance are situated
at Cairo Alexandria, Benisn√©f Assitlt, and Keneh, and also (with a
more limited jurisdiction) at Tanta and oicr.sii', (Z l zik) The
appeal-court is at Cairo; about half the number of its judges are
Europeans. The procedure is based upon the Code Napoleon.

(7). Intercourse with Orientals. Dragomans.

The average Oriental regards the European traveller as a Croesus
and sometimes too as a madman, - so unintelligible to him are
the objects and pleasures of travelling. Be therefore looks upon him
as fair game, and feels justified in pressing upon him with a perp etual

tempted to give for the sake of affording temporary pleasure at a trifling
