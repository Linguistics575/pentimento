116 Rants s. PYRAMIDS or' M'zrm. Environs

under the Romans and under the Arabs, renewed attempts were
made to penetrate to the treasures supposed to lie in the interior.

The first modern traveller who carefully and successfully examined
the Pyramids was Nicholas Shaw in 1721; but he still entertained the
notion that the Sphinx had a subterranean connection with the Great
Pyramid. He was followed by Norden in 1737; Poeooke in 1743, who
gives a plan and dimensions; Fourmont in 1755; Carsten Niebuhr in
1761; Davison in 1763-, Bruce in 1768; Volney in 1783-, Browne in 1792-98;
Denon. Coutelle, Jomard, and other savants of the French expedition
under Bonaparte in 1709-1801. Jomard in particular has the merit of
having taken very accurate measurements. Hamilton, in 1801, was a
dispassionate and critical observer. In 1817, Caviglia, a bold, but illiterate
and fanciful seaman, was fortunate in eliciting new facts regarding the
interior of the Great Pyramid, and excavated the Sphinx. In 1817, Belzoni
thOroughly explored the interior of the Second Pyramid. Belzoni, an
intelligent explorer and accurate draughtsman, was originally a monk at
Rome, but when the French occupied that city he retired to London,
where he devoted himself to study in spite of many hardships. In 1815 he
arrived in Egypt, where, besides exploring the pyramid, he discovered the
tomb of Sethos L at Thebes, etc. The next eminent explorer was Sir Gardner
Wilkinson in 1831. In 1837 and 1838 Col. Howard Vyse and Mr. Perring
made very thorough investigations and took careful measurements which
will always be considered authoritative. In 1842-45 Prof. Lepsius, the
distinguished German Egyptologist, made several very important discoveries, and furnished us with much valuable information. He found no
fewer than thirty pyramids which had been quite unknown to previous
travellers. G. Maspero opened the small pyramids of 8al.cl.ctra in 1880
and discovered important inscriptions. W. M. Flinders Petrie subjected
the Pyramids of Gizeh to a new and thorough investigation in 1881782.
The Pyramids ofDahst11he were examined in 1804-95 by De Morgan; those
of Lisht in 1895 by Gautier and JÃ©quier.

The pyramids of Gizeh stand upon a plateau, which extends

about 1600 yds. from E. to W. and about 1300 yds. from N. to s.,
the E. and N. margins being very precipitous at places. The pyramids are built exactly facing the four cardinal points. The diagonal
of the largest pyramid from N.E. to sw. is exactly in a line with
the diagonal of the second pyramid.

The ** Great Pyramid is called by the Egyptians'Yekhwet
Khyfu' or the'Glorious Place of Khufu'. No trace is now left of
its original outermost covering, which probably consisted of slabs
of limestone and granite. The length of each side (P1. A A) is now
760 ft., but was formerly (PL B B) about 768 ft.; the present perpendicular height (P1. E C) is 451 ft., while originally (Pl. E E),
including the nucleus of rock (P1. FF) at the bottom, and the apex
(Pl. CE), which has now disappeared, it is said to have been 48211.
The height of each sloping side (A C) is now 568 ft., and was formerly (P1. B E) 610 ft. The angle at which the sides rise is 51050'.
The cubic content of the masonry, deducting the foundation of rock
in the interior, as well as the hollow chambers, was formerly no less
than 3,277,000 cubic yards, and it still amounts to 3,057,000 cubic
yards. In round numbers, the stupendous structure covers an area
of nearly thirteen acres. The material of which it is constructed is
stone from the Mokattam and from Turra, containing numerous
fossils, chiefly nummulites (p. 1081
