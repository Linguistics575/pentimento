church. The ancient approach has disappeared; a ruinous flight of
steps leads up to the entrance. The First Hall contains four papyrus
columns with bud-capitals. The architectural details have been
painted over with Byzantine ornamentation, and the ancient mural
reliefs project from beneath figures of Christian saints. This hall
is adjoined by two side-ehambers and behind it is the sanctuary.

Among the reliefs on the walls of the Hall are the following. On the
left half of the Entrance Wall, Haremheb suckled by Anukis, beside whom
stands the ram-headed Khnum; on the right half of this wall is Haremheb before Thout, On the Ar. Wall, to the left of the door, the king before the ibis-headed Thout and four forms of the hawk-headed Horus
worshipped in Nubia; to the right of the door, Haremheb accompanied
by Set and Horus. - On the s. Wall (to the right of the door) are Christian
paintings of St. Epimachus and other saints on horseback and Coptic inscriptions. On the ceiling are figures of Christ and an Apostle.

On an isolated crag to the S. of the Gebel Addeh rise the ruins
of a Mediaeval Fortress. In the valley are numerous domed brick
tombs, probably Christian. - Farther to the S., in the face of an
isolated cliff opposite the island of Shataui, are several Memorial
Niches. One of these dates from the reign of King Eye (18th Dym),
who here prays to six gods. Another was constructed by an official
named Paser, who was governor of Ethiopia in the reign of King
Haremheb. On the walls we see Paser praying to Ammon-Re and
Re; and Paser's relatives before the deceased.

On the E. bank rise numerous isolated rocks, while the mountains recede from the river. - 11 M. Kusté'l (E. bank). H 171/2 M.

islands; and (331h M.) Aehktt.
