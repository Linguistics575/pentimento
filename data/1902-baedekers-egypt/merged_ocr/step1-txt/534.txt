worthy of that honour. Farther on this path turned off at right
angles to the S. and led to the entrance of the
Great Festal Temple of Thutmosis 111. We first enter a small
chamber in which two sixteen-sided columns are still standing,
and pass thence through another chamber with one column, and a
vestibule, into the Great chtal Hall. This has three aisles and is
144 ft. wide and 32 t't. deep. The roof was supported by 20 columns
in two rows, and 32 square pillars. The peculiar shape of the columns here is quite unique; the shafts taper downwards, and the
capitals are in the form of inverted calyces, the petals of which
point downwards. The pillars, though not so tall as the columns,
were of the same height as the walls, and with the latter supported
the roofing slabs of the side-aisles. The roof of the lot'tier central
aisle was supported partly by the columns and partly by small
pillars with an architrave rising from the roof above the pillars to
the height of the columns. The reliefs on the pillars show Thutmosis III. in presence of the gods.

The rooms adjoining the festal hall, several of which are in ruins,
were adorned with reliels by Thutmosis lil. A door in the partly ruined
rear-wall of the colonnade leads E. to the SANCTUARY, which included
three chambers. Only the lower part of its walls is now left. Adjoining,
on the N., is a SMALL ROOM, with its roof supported by k clustered papyruscolumns with bud-capitals (still in good preservation); on the lower part
of the wall are representations of the plants and animals brought from
Syria to Egypt by Thutmosis III. in the 25th year of his reign. - To the
S. is the ALEXANDER ROOM, built by Thutmosis Ill. and restored by Alexan,
der the Great. The reliefs show Alexander (or in a few isolated cases
Thutmosis), sacrificing to the gods. - Farther on is a HALL, with 8 sixteensided columns, of which, are still erect, and beyond that runs a CORRIDnn, opening off which are two small rooms with columns and seven other
chambers, with reliefs or Thutmosis

In the above-mentioned chamber with one column was found the
famous Kama): Table of the Kings, a list of the Egyptian monarchs from
the earliest times down to the 18th Dyn. (now in the Bibliothisque Nationale in Paris).

The central and E. portions of the Temple of Amman (from
Pylon m onwards) were surrounded by a GIRDLE WALL, the extent remains of which are covered with reliefs of Ramses II. sacrificing to the gods. Close behind the wall Ramses IL built a Colonnade (now completely ruined), embellished with Osiris-statues, and
connected with a Small Temple (ruins uninteresting), built by the
same king.

Still farther to the E. is a well-preserved ancient Gateway, 02 ft.
in height, which was the E. entrance to the temple of Ammon, and
lay MO yds. distant from the first (W.) pylon. It was built by one
of the Ptolemies.

If we turn to the right (8.) outside the gateway, we soon reach a small
building bearing the cartouches of Ramses m. and Ramses IV. - To the
N. of the gateway lies a small Temple of Osiris, dedicated hy Amenertais,
sister of Shabako 1. (25th Dyn.) and mother-in-law of Psammetikh L
hear it are several small chapels of the same period C26'th Dyn J.
