Temple of Hatter. DENDERA. 22. Route. 227

front of this great hall; but perhaps the means to add these were
not forthcoming.

If we compare the temple of Dendera with a similar structure
of the earlier period, such as the temple of Abydos or the great
national sanctuary of Karnak, we find it not less beautiful in its
own way, though of course far from competing with these gigantic
structures in magnificence or extent. Its chief characteristics are a
tine symmetry of proportions and dignified adaptation to its purposes. Neither the tlgures nor the inscriptions sculptured on the
walls compare in masterly execution with those in the tombs of
the ancient kingdom or with those in temples dating from the
reigns of Thutmosis III. and Sethos I.; but we cannot refuse our
admiration even to these products of later Egyptian art.

The rubbish round the temple reaches to the balustrades between the columns in front and nearly to the roof on the E. side;
hence the floor of the temple appears sunken and is reached by a
flight of steps.

We first enter the Great Vestibule, or PronaOs, which has
'24 sistrum-eolumng with heads of Hathor (p. cxxxvii ]. At the top
of the facade is a huge concave cornice, in the middle of which is
the winged sun-disk.

On the upper edge of the cornice is the following Greek inscription

The exterior front of the hall is enclosed by six balustrades be-.
tween the columns in the first row. Between the central pair of
columns is a door, half the height of the columns. The interior
walls of the pronaos are decorated with four rows of representations.
These depict the ruler (in succession the Roman emperors Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero) advancing with votive
offerings for Hathor and the other gods worshipped in the temple. The
reliefs (ehise11ed out) on the balustrades between the columns (Pl. a-fl

refer to the ceremonial entrance of the ruler into the sanctuary.
