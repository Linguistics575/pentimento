"No. 1 ]. Tomb of Ramses III. This imposing tomb, usually
called'Bruee's Tomb' or'The Harper's Tomb', is inferior in size
only to No. 17 and No. M. The style of the sculptures is not the
best, but the variety and richness of the representations are unexcelled. This tomb possesses a unique peculiarity in the ten sidechambers, opening off the first two corridors. The tomb was begun
and finished as far as Room m by Setnakht, father of Ramses 111.;
his cartouches are still to be seen at various places where the later
stucco has fallen off.
