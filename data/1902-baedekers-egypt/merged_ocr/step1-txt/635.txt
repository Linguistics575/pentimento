means of 180 sluiees (140 below, each with an opening of 350 sq. ft.,
and 40 above, each with an opening of 175 sq. ft.).

The plans for this dam, which will be the largest of the kind in the
world, were prepared hy Egyptian government officials. under the direction
of Sir William Garstin, 1Jniler-Seeretary of State. The construction is
entrusted to Messrs. John Aim ] d; Co., of Liverpool; the chief engineer was
Mr Maurice Fitzmcmrice. The foundation-stone was laid on Feb. 2nd, 1899,
by the Duke of Connaught, and the total cost in expected to exceed the
original estimate of 2,000 000t. The reservoir-basin shove the dam will
have a ohie capacity of 231.00% (00 gallons. It has been calculated that
the gain to Egypt from this dam, through the irrigation of lands hitherto
beyond the reach of cultivation, will amount to 2,600,0 (? (h. per annum.
The works would have been still more extensive and the storage basin
still deeper had it not heen apparent that in that case the island of Phila,
would have heen placed under water. - At the W. end of the dam is a
navigation canal, with four locks, 260 n. in length and 32 ft. in breadth. a
Permission to inspect the works is usually readily granted on applie tion
to one of the chief engineers at Shelli ] or at one of the offices of works.

Upwards of 10,000 workmen are engaged on the work; most of
these are Arabs, but there are also many Italians and other Europeans.
An entire village has sprang up here, with woodeubarraoks, canteens,
and shops for the workmen and houses for the offleials.

We now turn to the E., passing a cemetery for Christian workmen,
and regain the desert-route at the tomb of a shekh, near the ancient
brick-wall..

The village of t111e11t1,1 (Challal), where both the railway and the
desert route end, lies on the E. bank of the Nile, opposite Philr.
The beautiful island, surroun ded by clear smooth water and crowned
by its imposing temples and graceful kiosque, presents a striking
contrast to the rugged and barren rocky landscape that environs it.

The Island of Philae.

A comfortable ferry-boat plies to Phil'ae from the E. bank (there and
back 5 pink; more is demanded at first).

Philae, the pearl of Egypt, is 600 yds. in length and 100 yds. in
breadth, and consists of a crystalline granite mixed with hornblende, beneath the alluvial deposits of the Nile. The modern name
is borrowed from the Greeks, and is derived from the ancient Egyptian Pi-tok, or the'island of Lak'. The Copts called it Pilakh,..
'the corner', and the Arabs used to call it Bilak. Now-a-days none
of these names are known to the natives, who call the island Kasaor Gestret Anas el- Wogtd, after the hero of one of the tales in the
Thousand and One Nights, which has its scene transferred to Philae
in the Egyptian version.

The boatmen relate it as follows.'Once upon a time there was a
king, who had a handsome favourite named Aims pl-Wagad, and a vizier,
whose daughter was named Zahr el- Ward, i.e. Flower of the Rose. The
two young people saw and fell in love with each other, and found opportunities of meeting secretly, until they were discovered through the imprudence of the maiden's attendant. The vizier was violently enraged
