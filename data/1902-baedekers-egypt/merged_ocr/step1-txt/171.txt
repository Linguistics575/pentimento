' BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS.

hewn stone was used for portions of the edifiees; the mosque of E1Ahmar, built in 1125, showed the first example of a stone faeade
embellished with stalaetites. The portals began to he placed in
recesses, and small eupolas made their appearance in the interior
of the mosques. The pointed arch, introduced in the mosque of
Jhn Tulfm, gave place to the Persian'keel'-ara. Towards the
close of this period forms began to be adopted, especially in military architecture. that seem to have been copied from the buildings of the Crusaders in Syria and Palestine. The leading eharaeteristic of the EYYUBIDE PERIODwaS the introduction of the ground-plan
of the Persian medreseh, which superseded the previously used
ground-plan of the courts until the first Mameluke period. Large
domes began to be built over the mausolea, which as founders'
tombs were placed near the sanctuaries of the mosques.

To the FIRST MAMELUKE DYNASTY we owe a number of huge
editiees, with ground-plans in both the above-mentioned styles and
exhibiting, especially in the fagades, the influence of the architecture of the Crusaders. Most of these structures date from the
reigns of Bihars and Ealiton, the latter of whom raised the first
minaret of stone. Under Nasir endeavours began to be made to
design facades independent of foreign influence.

Under the SECOND MAMELUKE DYNASTY the mosque-fapade attained its zenith, and from this period date the most elegant
achievements of Arabic architecture in Egypt. The fapades now
assumed a more homogeneous character; the minarets, of enhanced
elegance ever since the days of Kalafm, reached their highest development; the domes, now also built of stone (see below), were
richly adorned with sculpture; and the walls, ceilings, pavements,
and even domestic furniture were sumptuously embellished with
mosaics, panels, carvings, and stalaetites. The first dome built of
stone was that of the mosque of Barly1ls (p. 65).

The use of written characters has played a prominent part in
the decoration of Arabic buildings at all times, and the art did not
deteriorate in the latest period. Under the Tulunides the closely
written Cutie character was employed, while under the Fttimites
and, still more, under the Eyyubides, the letters became taller and
more slender. The letters themselves and the spaces between them
were embellished with arabesque ornamentation. In the later periods the cursive character known as Neskhi was used also; and the
t'riezes of intertwined letters dating from the period of the Mamelukes frequently rise to the dignity of works of art.

We may now proceed to an examination of the special kinds of
buildings, beginning with the mosques.

Mosques are of two kinds, the thimiU, lit. an assembly for
prayer, and Mesgid, the place on which the knee is bent for prayer.
The oldest mosques are very simple in plan (comp. the plan of the
mosque of Ibn Tulttn, p. 53). Around a quadrilateral court (Sum),
