The Northern Colossus is the famous vocal statue of Memnon.

To the left of the king stands his mother Metemwa to the sight his
g. a g

wife Teye; a third figure, between the legs, is destroyed. On each
side of the seat two Nile-gods were represented in sunk relief,

winding the representative plants of Egypt (papyrus and lily) round
the hieroglyph for'to unite', a symbol of the union of Upper and
Lower Egypt.

Attention began to be directed to the Musical Phenomenon connected with the colossus, about the beginning of the Roman empire, after it had been broken. When it became known that the N.
colossus emitted a musical note at sunrise, a new myth was invented to explain the fact. Memnon who had fallen at Troy appeared as a stone image at Thebes and greeted his mother Eos
with a sweet and plaintive note when she appeared at dawn. The
goddess heard the sound and the morning-dews are the tears she
shed upon her beloved child. Stratus, who is the first author to
mention the phenomenon, eXpresses doubt as to its genuineness;
but Pausauias and Juvenal (p. 328) accept it as a fact. By later
observers the sound is compared to that of a stroke upon metal, or
even of a trumpet-blast and of human voices singing. The sound
was heard only at or soon after sunrise, though by no means invariably then, in which case the god was supposed to be angry.
The phenomenon ceased altogether after the time of Septimius
Severus, who caused the restoration of the upper portions, perhaps
with a view to propitiate the angry god. The restoration was not
very skilfully managed, with five courses of sandstone blocks.
Letronue has proved that the resonance of the stone is on no account
to be explained as a mere priestly trick, and in the opinion of
eminent physicists it is perfectly possible that a hard resonant
stone, heated by the warm sunlight suddenly following upon the
cold nights in Egypt, might emit a sound, caused by the splitting
off of minute particles from the surface., A similar phenomenon
has been observed elsewhere.

The numerous Greek and Latin Inscriptions, in prose and verse, inscribed upon the legs of the figure by travellers under the Roman empire,
are peculiarly interesting. These are more numerous on the left than on
the right leg, and none are beyond the reach of a man standing at the
foot of the statue. The earliest were carved in the reign of Nero, the
latest in those of Septimius Severus and Caraealla, and the most numerous (27) in that of Hadrian. Only one Egyptian (who is responsible for
a short demotic inscription) is found among these soribblers. The inscriptions were for the most part the work of men of some eminence, including S governors of Egypt, 3 epistrateges of the Thehaid, 2 procurators,
etc. Many, though not all, are dated. Nearly all of them afford proof that
only the N. colossus emitted the famous sound. The oldest inscription
dates from the 11th year of Nero's reign. - Many of the great officials who
visited the marvels of Thebes were accompanied by their wives. The
colossus was frequently dumb, in which case the visitor usually waited
until a more favourable occasion. Many were so struck with the phenomenon that they were not content till they had heard it three or four times.

Hadrian, who journeyed through Egypt in 130 A.D., spent several days
here along with his wife Sabina and a large retinue. In his reign a perfect
