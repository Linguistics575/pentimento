Junction Railway between the town and the harbour-island (p.173),
in v. hr. (tam 2, 1pias., return-ticket 3, 11/2 pias.), trains hourly all day.

Rowing Boats. A charge of 340 pias. is usually made for a rowing
boat for an hour. The boatmen are apt to be extortionate in their
demands, as travellers on their way to or from Indian and making ashm-t
stay only, are often too lavish in their payments. Comp. pp. 173. 174.

Disposition of Time. The afternoon of the day of arrival may be
devoted to a visit to the Harbour and Canal Entrance, by rowing-boat or
by the junction-railway. The next forenoon (early start necessary; comp.
p. 173) may be spent in an excursion to the Spring: of Moses. A visit to
the Coral Formations (p. 174) practically involves another day's stay at Suez;

Shells and coral from the Red Sea may be bought from the boatmen
at the harbour; bargaining necessary.

Sues lies at the head of the gulf of that name, one of the N.
extremities of the Red Sea, and to the S.W. of the mouth of the.
Suez Canal. Before the construction of the great work of M. de Lesseps, it was a miserable Arabian village, with 1500inhab. at most,
while in 1897 it contained 17,457, including 2774 Europeans. Its
trade, however, in spite of the opening of the canal and the construction of large docks, has not materially increased. Neither the Arabian quarter, with its seven mosques and unimportant bazaar, nor
the European quarter, which contains several buildings and warehouses of considerable size, presents any attraction. The streets
and squares are kept clean, and the climate is excellent.

On a mound of debris to the N. of the town, not far from the
station and the magazines of the'Ehei1ivtyeh Company', is a
kiosque of the Khedive, commanding a fine view of the mountains
of the peninsula of Sinai, the sea, the harbour, and the. town. The
hill is called by the Arabs Kohn el-Kolzum, and was probably the
site of the Ptolemaic fortress Klysma; relics of the period of the
Pharaohs have also been discovered here. Beyond the railway, to
the W., are the mud-huts of an Arab sailors' quarter. The small
eminence to the N.W. is named the Beduins' Hill. - A little
farther to the N. is the mouth of the Fresh Water Canal (p. 162),
the flow of which into the conduits, as well as its discharge into
the sea, is regulated by means of a large look. The level of the
canal is here 61/2 ft. above that of the Red Sea. on its banks, and
