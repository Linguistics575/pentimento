third for his head. The slippers or pattens are then put on, and the
anteehamber re-eutered. When the [ cabgcfibs are removed, cold water
is sprinkled over the feet, fresh towels are then provided, and the
bather at last throws himself down on his divan, wonderfully refreshed, yet glad to enjoy perfect repose for a short time. This
interval of tranquil enjoyment is the favourite Oriental'key' [ i.e.
luxurious idleness ]. Every bath contains a coffee and pipe establishment, Coffee and hot eau sucre'a are the favourite beverages. Before
dressing, the bather is generally provided with two or three more
relays of fresh towels. The whole of these operations need not oooupy much more than an hour, but Orientals often devote a whole
morning to the bath. - Many of the baths are charitable foundations, where the natives pay little or nothing. Europeans are generally
expected to pay 8 piastres or more (including coffee and nargileh ],
and a fee of about 1 pias. is given to the'soap man'.

(10). Egypt as a Health Resort. Medical Hints.

The benefieial influenee of the climate of Egypt has been known
since the Roman period at least, and of late years an increasing
number of visitors have floekei1 to the Nile to enjoy the benefits
of its remarkably dry winter-climate. Phthisis (in certain cases),
asthma, chronic bronchitis, Bright's disease, rheumatoid arthritis,
gout, insomnia, dyspepsia, and mental strain are some of the most

home should consult a physician immediately on arriving in Egypt;
and it is advisable in all cases to secure the advice of the physician
resident at the spot selected.

It is now generally understood that Cairo cannot properly be considered a health-resort. The presence of a large city with its noise
and bustle, its situation, exposed to the influence of a wind coming
from the N. over the broad cultivated Delta, the unhealthy saturation
in the early part of winter of considerable low-lying tracts of the
town composed of old rubbish, and the higher relative humidity, all
combine to compel those who seek health from the climate of Egypt
to look to other stations. There are, however, excellent health-resorts in the immediate vicinity of the capital, vis. Mona House Hotel,
and especially Holman. Luster and Assut'm, in Upper Egypt, offer still
more favourable climatic conditions. There is at least one English
physician at each of these four stations. The hotels at all are ex
