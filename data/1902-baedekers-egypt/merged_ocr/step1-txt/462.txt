S. side of the valley, is a large Quarry, which, according to a now
defaced inscription, yielded stone in the first year of AmenoPhis Ill.
for the temple at Hermnpolis. Farther up the valley are quarries
of the time of Nektanebos.

On the W. bank, 1 M. from the Nile, is the town of Malawi
(Mulbzoui; rail. Farther on, p. 190). Farther on, on the E. bank, at the foot
of the hill of the same name (p. 190), lies Shékh Se'Zd, with tombs
of the Early Empire, belonging to princes and high oft'1cials of the
'hare-nome'.

TELL EL JAMARNA (or, better, Il-' Amama) a name derived from
the Beni Amran or El -'Amarrrs Beduins is the name now given to
the extensive ruins and roek-tornbs which lie near the villages of
Hagg-Kandil on the S. and et-Tell 011 the N., and form the last
relies of the ancient royal city Elchut-Attm, Ithe horizon of the sun'.

When Amenophis IV. (p. lxxxii) became converted to the exclusive worship of the sun and abjured the ancient gods, he quitted
Thebes, the capital until that time, and withdrew with his court to
a new sacred spot. This was situated in the Hermopolitan name in
Central Egypt, on both banks of the Nile, and its boundaries may
be traced to this day by inscriptions chiselled on the rocks near
el-Hawéja (p. 210) and et-. Tell (E. bank) and near Tune ]: and Gildeh
(W. bank). The new royal residenee-town was founder ] 011 the E.
bank and speedily prospered. Temples and palaces sprang up, beside
the imposing royal abode arose the dwellings of the nobles, and lordly
tombs were prepared for the king and his favourites in the hills to
the east. But after the death ot'Amellophis the ancient religion
once more obtained the upper hand, the court returned to Thebes,
and the new town rapidly decayed. Its life had not lasted for more
than 50 years, and the site upon which it stood was never again
occupied. Owing to this circumstance the ancient streets and
ground-plans have remained to this day and may be traned with
little trouble. The religious revolution under AmenoPhis IV. was
accompanied by a revolution in art. The artists who worked in his
reign, probably feeling themselves more independent of ancient
traditions, attempted to lend their creations an expression more in
accordance with nature. In many cases, however, they fell into exaggeration, as, for example, in the representations of the lean form
