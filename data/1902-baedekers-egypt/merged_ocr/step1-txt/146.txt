simple flower-column with bud-eapitels and the same with calyx
capitals; and the clustered column with bud-capitals and the same
with 1salyx-usapitals.

Of the various Lotus Columns, which seem to have been freely
used if we may judge from the numerous pictures of them, comparatively few have been preserved. Clustered columns of this kind
with bud-capitals occur under
the 4rpsient and Middle Empires (in a tomb at Benilusen), but appear to have died out under the New Empire.
The above-mentioned column

'atBenWasan is formed of four
straight stems, rising from a
base resembling a mound of
earth and fastened together
at the top by bands (Fig. IV).
The capital is formed of closed
buds, the green sepa ] s of which
extend quite to the top of the
white petals of the corolla.
Near the top of the shaft
smaller stems are' inserted
between the main stems.
Examples of clustered tlolumns of the Nymphaea lotus
with open (calyx) capitals
(Fig. 111) are freqently represented in tombs of the Ancient
and Middle Empires i but they
oeeurmost frequ ently in buildings of the later period.

The Papyrus Columns are much more numerous. They differ
widely from the 1otus-eo1umns. The stems in the latter are circular
in section, while in the papyrus-columns they are triangular, and
moreover taper rapidly at the base, where they are encircled with a
wreath of pointed leaves - characteristics that are wanting in the
lotus-columns. There is a difference also in the capitals; for the
sepals of the papyrus-flowed are much shorter than those of the lotus
and do not reach to the tips of the petals (see above). The simple papyrus-column with a bud-capital is seen only in paintings and reliefs;
whereas the clustered column is common enough (Fig. Va). The
latter usually consists of eight stems held together by bands at the
top, while between these stems smaller clusters of three, fastened
together by six bands, were inserted. These inserted stems, however,
lost their independent treatment at an early perioiL-Towards the
