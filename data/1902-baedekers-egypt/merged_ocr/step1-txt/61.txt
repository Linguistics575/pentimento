1 THE NILE. River Basin.

white, or rather the'elear' river, whose water descends from clear
lakes and is farther filtered by the vast grassy plains and occasional
floating plants through which it passes. The Blue Nile [ together
with the Atbara) may therefore be regarded-as the sole origin "the
fertility of Egypt, and also as the cause of the inundation, while on
the other hand the regular and steady supply of water afforded by
the White Nile performs the very important office of preventing the
lower part of the river from drying up altogether in summer. The
White Nile is not only much larger than the Blue in average volume,
but is, with its tributaries, more than double the length.

The Valley of the Nile from Kharttun to the Delta, although
from its great length (150 of latitude) necessarily possessing great
varieties of climate, forms one long unbroken tract of country, the
fertilising soil of which is brought down by the Blue Nile from the
Abyssinian mountains.

The breadth of the Valley of the Nile, including the barren land
immediately flanking it, varies from 5 to wh miles in Nubia, and
from 121/2 to 31 miles in Egypt. The banks, of which the eastern is
called the'Arabian', and the western the'Libyan', rise at places
to upwards of 1000 ft., resembling two large eanal-embankments,
between which the river has forced its passage through the plateau
of'Nubian sandstone' (which extends to the Gebel Silsileh), and
through the nummulite limestone of Upper and Central Egypt.
The breadth of the cultivable alluvial soil corresponds with the
above varying width, but nowhere exceeds 10 miles. The soil deposited by the Nile averages 33-38 ft. deep in Egypt, but near
Ifalyt1tr at the head of the Delta it increases to about 50 ft., the
bottom of it being at places below the level of the sea. The bed of
the river is also of considerable depth, and at low water the mudbanks (gef) rise above its surface to a height of 25 ft. in Upper
Egypt, and 14 ft. at Cairo. These are also the depths of the various
irrigation-wells.

The Nile soil is unlike any other in the world in its composition.
According to Regnault it contains 63 per cent of water and sand, 18 per
cent of carbonate of lime, I) per cent of oxide of iron, and, per cent of carbonate of magnesia.

The INUNDATION is more or less favourable according to the
greater or less amount of rain that falls among the Abyssinian mountains, for that which falls in Central Africa is a more constant
quantity, being regulated by the influence of the trade-winds. Like
the waterspouts which descend on equatorial Africa, the overflow
always recurs at the same season of the year, varying in its advent
by a few days only, and in its depth by several yards. At the beginning of June the river slowly begins to swell, and between the
15th and 20th of July the increase becomes very rapid. Towards
the end of September the water ceases to rise, remaining at the same
height for twenty or thirty days, but during the first half of October
