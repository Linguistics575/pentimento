Roman period was one of the chief emporia for the wares of Arabia
and India. The town stood under the protection of the ithyphallic
harvest-god Min (Pan), who was also the patron of travellers in the
desert. During the great rebellion in Upper Egypt under Diocletian (292 A.D.) Koptos was besieged and destroyed, but quickly
recovered from the blow. Down to the time of the Khalifs it remained a populous and thriving trading-town. To the S.E. of the
modern town lay the ancient city, with a temple of Min, the ruins
of which were excavated in 1894 by Flinders Petrie.

At Koptos the great caravan-routes through the Arabian Desert to
the seaports on the Red Sea quitted the Nile valley. The chief goals of
the caravans were the Sinaitic peninsula. and the land of Punt (Pwenet),
situated about the modern Somali Coast, which yielded incense, ivory,
ebony, panther-skins, ete., and was regarded by the Egyptians as a land
of fabulous wonders, like India. Other caravans made for the wad, Wmtndmdt in the desert, which produced a hard stone much prized by the
Egyptians, who used it largely for sculptures (comp. p. 346). At a later
period the tyaravan-trade was diverted to the routes viii litis and finally
to those via Keneh.

where the god Haroeris was worshipped. According to Abulfeda
(d. 1331) this town, now entirely vanished, was second in size only
to Fostat (Cairo), and was the chief centre of the Arabian trade.

A few stones with fragmentary inscriptions have been built into the
houses of the town; and the mosque contains a basin formed of a single
stone, with the name of Ptolemy Philadelphus upon it. A pylon, which
stood here 30 years ago, has now disappeared.

On the W bank, opposite Ift1s, lies Ttskh (et- Talc), inland from
which, on the edge of the desert, are the ruins of Ombos (excavated
