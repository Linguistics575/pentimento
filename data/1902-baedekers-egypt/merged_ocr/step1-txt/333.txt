108 Route 7. MOIiATTAM. Environs

An interesting visit may, however, be made without much
trouble to an Ostrich Farm kept by some Frenchmen, about 1/4 hr.
to the E. of Matariyeh, with about 800 birds (adm. 10 pias.).

The excursion may be extended to the village ofEl-Merg (21/2114; mil.
way-station, see p. 106), with some ruins of the 18th Dynasty, and the once
prosperous, but now ruinous Khdnlcdh, on the outskirts of the desert (81/2131.
from Matariyeh); but this is not recommended.

The Birket el-Hegg, or Lake of the Pilgrims, to the E. of El-Merg,
presents no attraction except during the latter half of the lunar month
of Shawwal, when the great caravan which accompanies the new kisweh,
or cover for the Kama, to Mecca, assembles here to celebrate the so-called
Nahum ] Festival (p. lxxii). A similar scene may, however, be more conveniently viewed at Cairo, where festivities take place at the departure
and arrival of the sacred carpet.

g, The Mokattam Hills.

An excursion to the Molgattam Hills is best made on Donkey-back (p. M).
Including the return, it takes about 3 hrs., bat it may be combined with
the visit to the smaller Petrified Forest in the manner indicated at p. 110.
The View is best at sunset, or in the morning between 8 and 9 o'clock.

The best route to the Mol.ra.t.tarn starts from the Citadel, whence
it ascends almost straight, passing through the BL??? tl- Gebel (Pl. F, 6)
and over the railway-bridge. - The route starting from the Tombs
of the Khalifs should be avoided on account of the intolerable dust.
About 3/4 hr. brings us to the top.

The *Moliattam Hills Cor Gebel GiyiLshi, as the range of hills to
the E. of Cairo is sometimes called after the conspicuous old mosque
situated on the summit) belong to the great range of nummulite
mountains which extend from N .W. Africa, across Egypt and India,
to China. This nummulite formation is one of the Eocene, or oldest
deposits of the tertiary period, and immediately follows the chalk.
It affords a favourite building-stone, and there are numerous quarries on the slopes of the hills.

The nummulite is remarkably rich in fossils, the chief mass of which
consists of millions of nummulites (a kind of snail-shell), or large rhizopods of the polythalamia group. The larger kinds are about one inch
in diameter, and the smaller about 1/3 inch. They are also frequently
seen in the stones of the Pyramids, which are to a great extent constructed of nummulite limestone. The Greeks also noticed these curious
fossils, and Herodotus mentions the smallest kinds as being petrified
lentils, of the sort eaten by the ancient Egyptians.

The quarries in the slopes of the Mohattam and the higher side-valleys
of the range also yield a profusion of sea-urehins (olypeaster, cidaris,
echinolampas, eth, various kinds of oysters, cerithium, ovula, strombus,
nerina, furritella, nautilus, bivalves, sharks' teeth, and bones of the
halicore. Beautiful crystals of isinglass-stone and of strontian also occur.

The *VIEW from the top, especially with its sunset colouring,
is magnificent. The thousand minarets of the city and the picture
esque buildings of the Citadel are then tinted with a delicate rosy
hue. The grandest of all the burial-grounds of the desert forms a
noble foreground, the venerable Nile dotted with its lateen sails
flows below us in its quiet majesty, and to the W., on the borders
of the immeasurable desert, tower the huge and wondrous old Pyr
