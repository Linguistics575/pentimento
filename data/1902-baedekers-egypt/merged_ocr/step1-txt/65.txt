furrowed with numerous ravines, and occasionally nearly 1000 ft. in height.
The different strata of the earlier nummulite formation, as well as those
of the upper chalk, are here exposed to view, and generally contain numerous fossils. The oases, particularly those of Diikhel and Ehiirgeh,
are remarkable for their fossil wealth. The soil of the deep depressions
in which these cases lie, partly below the level of the Nile, consists of
the variegated clayey or sandy strata of the upper chalk. The ground
is strongly impregnated with alum at places. Numerous thermal springs
well up from the upper strata of the chalk, and the soil thus irrigated is
luxuriantly clothed with vegetation, The barrier of Nubian sandstone
which abuts on the valley of the Nile at Silsileh extends far into the
Libyan desert. It forum the southwestern boundary of the oases ofKhitrgeh
and Dakhel, beyond which it stretches for an unknown distance into
the heart of the desert. This formation contains si1ieified wood and iron
and manganese Ores in abundance. About six days' journey to the W.
of the cases begins a complete ocean of sand. As far as the eye can
reach we discover nothing but a vast expanse ofloose yellow sand, which
generally forms itself into ranges of sand-hills, many miles in length,
and occasionally rising to a height ot' 1500 ft. ur upwards above the level of
the plain,

The oasis of Fardfm lies in a recess eroded in the nummulite limestone. To the N. and W. of Farafra extends the eocene limestone plateau
as far as the neighbourhood of Siam, between which oasis and Bahriyeh
it is remarkable for its numerous basin-shaped and sharply defin√©d depressions. The whole of the desert around the Oasis of Ammon consists
of recent tertiary deposits, the fossil wealth of which was once extolled
by Herodotus and Eratosthenes.

d. Agriculture and Vegetation.

I. CAPABILITIES OF THE SOIL. In the time of the Pharaohs the
Egyptian agricultural year was divided into three equal parts,
the period of the inundation (from the end of June to the end of
October), that of the growing of the crops (from the end of oetober to the end of February), and that Of the harvest (from the
end of February to the end of June). At the present day there are
two principal seasons, corresponding to our summer and winter,
besides which there is a short additional season, corresponding with
the late summer or early autumn of the European year. The land
is extremely fertile, but it is not so incapable of exhaustion as it is
sometimes represented to be. Many of the crops, as elsewhere, must
occasionally be followed by a fallow period; others thrive only when
a certain rotation is observed (such as wheat, followed by clover and
beans); and some fields require to be artifieially manured. Occasionally two crops are yielded by the same field in the same season
(wheat and saffron, wheat and clover, etc.) The great extension within the last thirty or forty years of the cultivation of the sugar-cane,
which requires a great deal of moisture, and of the eotton-plant, which
requires extremely little, has necessitated considerable modifieations
in the modes of irrigation and cultivation hitherto in use. As both of
these crops are of a very exhausting character, the land must either
he more frequently left fallow, or must be artifleially manured. The
industry and powers of endurance of the Egyptian peasantry are
thus most severely tried, although the homogeneous soil of the
