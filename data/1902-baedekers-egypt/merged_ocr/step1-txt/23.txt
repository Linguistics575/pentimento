xvi STEAMERS.

"Conveyances.

Steamers. Egypt may be reached from England either: by
steamer direct or by overland route to one of the principal Mediterranean ports and thence by steamer. Particulars ofthe various routes
are given in R. 1. Whether the traveller returns westwards on leaving Egypt, or intends to proceed to Syria or elsewhere, it is important that he should be familiar with the principal steamboat services.
The vessels of the principal lines are nearly on a par with regard to
comfort and speed, the British and German steamers being perhaps
slightly superior, and the Italian steamers slightly inferior to the
others. In autumn and winter vessels bound for Egypt, and in spring

those returning westwards are apt to be crowded.

be obtained in London at 122 Leedenhall St., 13.0., or at Northumberland

The Face, which is included in the first-class fare and usually in
the second also, islalways ahundaut and of good quality. Wine is not
included in the fare except on board the French, Austrian, and Italian

Austrian steamers as being lighter and better suited to the climate than
that of the British vessels. Passengers who are prevented by sickness
from partaking of the regular repasts are supplied with lemonade and
other refreshments gratis.

and family tickets for three or more persons are generally issued at a
reduced rate, but no reduction is made on the charge for food. A child

hunts, for which the charge at all the Italian ports is 1 franc or lira. for
each person, including luggage. Good order is kept at these ports by
