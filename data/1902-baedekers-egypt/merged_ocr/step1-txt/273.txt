60 Route J. CAIRO. J. Northern

in 1293, is the largest monument of its period and is of considerable architectural interest. Many of its details, especially the
windows, recall the Romanesque style of Europe. Originally there
was a separate ward for every known disease, besides lecture-rooms
for students and an orphanage. Now, however, decay and alteration
have so changed the building that only the wards surrounding the
principal court can be eonfidently identified.

The Portal is constructed of black and white marble, and is of
imposing height. The doors still show traces of their former covering
of bronze. The ceiling of the entrance, with its open beams, is also
very effective; the other corridors are vaulted in the Gothic style.
The first door on the left leads into the mosque; the second door on
the right leads to the Vestibule of the Tomb of Kaléa'n. The tomb
itself contains tine granite columns and pillars, which once supported the dome. The prayer-recess, with its mosaics, its beautiful
dwarf-areades, and its shell-shaped ornamentation, is also worthy of
notice. The marble and tortoise-shell ornamentation of the lower
parts of the walls and pillars is the finest inOairo. In the tomb chamber
are still preserved articles of dress which once belonged to Kalaun
and are popularly supposed to possess miraculous healing virtues.

Adjacent to the Mt1risttm, as the second of the three ediflees
mentioned above, is the *Medréseh and Tomb of Mohammed enNasir, dating from about 1303, but now almost a total ruin.

We enter it from the street by a marble portal in the late-Romanesque
style, brought by a brother of Nasir from the church ofAkka, which was
destroyed in 1291. The top of it has been completed in the Arab manner.
The door leads into a corridor, 0n the right side of whichis the tomb of High
(dome in ruins), while to the left is the sanctuary of the medrilseh, with
interesting plaster carvings on the side of the prayer-recess. In front are
the ruins of the main building, now containing workshops and huts of
the poor. The remnants of plaster decorations on the back~walls, like
those in the medreseh and on the interesting minarets, recall in some
respects those of the Alhambra.

The third large building is the'Barlrtilrireh, the medréseh of
Sultan 13ka Ci382-99; p. xcvi), built in 1384, Which also contains the tomb of the daughter of Barlyllp It possesses an interesting marble portal and a bronze-mounted door. The greater part of
it was thoroughly restored a few years ago, and the colouring and
gilding applied to the sanctuary and mausoleum are, unforunately,
much too loud. -.-. Opposite is a modern sebil.

Continuing to follow the busy 8lutrra en-Naliluhtn (p. 59), the
continuation of the lh5hergtyeh, we come to the Sehit'Abd er-Ralimtm, at a fork of the street, one of the prettiest structures of its sort
in Cairo (18th cent. j. On the groundflpori IS the chamber for the distribution of the water, tastefully decorated with fayenee. Upstairs is
the hall of an elementary school, commanding a striking retrospect
of the busy street, with the three red and white mosques and their
minarets to the right. To the left is the huge facade of the palace
of Dc'ir Beshték (Pl. E, 3), erected in the first half of the 14th cent.
