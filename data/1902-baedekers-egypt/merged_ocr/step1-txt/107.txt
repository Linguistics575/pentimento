HISTORY.

Louis IX., the Saint, of France undertook the Sixth Crusade,
marched against Egypt, took Damietta, but was captured
along with his army at Manyha, and was only released
on payment of a heavy ransom (p. 158).

BAr.uul's MAMELUKE SULTANS. The first of these monarchs
was Mu'iss Eibek.

Bibars, one of the ablest of this dynasty, annihilated the iast
remnants of the kingdom of Jerusalem in the course of
four campaigns. He brought to Cairo the last representative of the'Abbaside khalifs, who had been overthrown by
the Mongols and expelled from Bagdid, and permitted him
and his successors nominally to occupy the throne.

1ra1hiin, el-Mansar Kaldan (p. 59), succeeded to the exelusion of a youthful son of Bibars, successfully opposed the
Mongols, and entered into treaties with the Emperor Rudolph and other European princes.

El-Ashraf Khalil captures'Alrka (Acre), the last place in
the Holy Land held by the Christians.

Nasir, Mohammad en-N6.sir ibn Kalrmn (p. 33), succeeded
his brother Khalil at the age of nine years, but owing to
internal dissensions was compelled to retire to Syria.
With the aid ofthe Syrian emits, however, he regained
his throne. Distrust, vindictiveness, and cupidity soon

known also as a historian, succeeded, however, in retaining his master's favour till the time of his death. Towards
the mass of the population Nasir was liberal and condescending, and towards the clergy indulgent. In order to
provide the enormous sums required for the expenses of
his court and his love of building, he appointed Christian
offioials in the custom-house and finanee departments.

Hasan, Melik en-Ntffir Abu'l-j1faZlH.ra8trn ihnlrallifsn (p.49),
the sixth son of Nasir, was still a minor when he ascended
the throne. The lawless independence of the Mamelukes
and emirs was aggravated by a plague in i318-49 which
exterminated whole families, whose property was immediately seized by the government. After having been dethroned in 1351, Hasan regained his sceptre three years
later, but in 1361 he was assassinated

CIRCASSIAN MAMELUKE SULTANS (Borgites). The founder of
this dynasty was
Barking (pp. 33, 60, 63), a Cireassian slave, who succeeded
in raising himself to the throne by setting aside Haggi, a
boy of six years, and great-grandson of Mohammed en
