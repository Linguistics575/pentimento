It may here be remarked that the Egyptian names occurring in
the Handbook are, wherever practicable, written in the traditional
Greek form and not in the native Egyptian; e.g. Sethos instead of
Sti, Kheops (Cheape) instead of Khwfw. For names of which there
are no known Greek transliterations the Egyptian forms are given,
with vowels inserted on the principles explained above. In these
cases, however, the dots under the letters are omitted, so that no difference is made between t and t, z and g, k, and la, or it and h; w is
sometimes represented by u; y by i; I } and li. by kh; s' by "and in
certain cases y is altogether omitted. The apostrophes' and t are
uniformly omitted. In short, the general rules adopted by the
Greeks for the transliteration of Egyptian words are followed. The final e in Egyptian names does not mean that the vowel is long,
but merely that it is to be pronounced as a separate syllable.
