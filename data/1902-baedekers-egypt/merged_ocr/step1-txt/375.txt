a path enclosed by walls, on which stood Greek statues; a few of these
are still On their original site (but now covered with sand), The great
Sphinx Avenue, which led to the W. through the necropolis to the Serapeum, terminated in front of the temple of Nectanebos in a semicircular
space adorned with statues of Greek philosophers. But the remains of
all these monuments are now covered with sand, and only the gallery of
Apis Tombs constructed by Psammetikh is accessible to visitors.

which leads us to the
PRINCIPAL PASSAGE (Pl. A, B),
running parallel with the first, from
E. to W., and penetrating the solid
rock. This passage is flanked with
the side-chambers, about 26 ft. in
height, the pavements and vaulted
ceilings of which are constructed of
excellent Mokattam stone. Twentyfour of the chambers still contain
