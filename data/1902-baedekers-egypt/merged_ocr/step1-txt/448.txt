BENIsUEF. 18. Route. 193

recently by Prof. Flinders Petrie, who discovered on its E. side the small
Temple of Snofru. This, built of blocks of limestone, consists of two,
hare chambers leading to an open court immediately adjoining the pyramid. The numerous inscriptions on the walls were placed there by
later pilgrims to the shrine.

The Mastabas of Meidiim lie to the N. and E. of the pyramid. These
were the tombs of the courtiers and offtMals of Snofru, and are among
the oldest monuments of the kind in the world. The two most important
(to the N.) are those of the judge and vizier Nefermaat and his wife Fetal,
and of Prince Rahotep and his wife Nofret. Their inner chambers, which
were inaccessible in antiquity and have been again built up after exploration, were emhellished with admirably executed representations and inseriptinns. The tomb of Rahotep is decorated with painted has-reliefs,
while in that of Nefermaat some of the scenes are painted upon stucco
(e.g. the geese, now in the Museum at Gizeh, p. 79), while others are engraved in outline and the inner surfaces filled up with colours. Numerous graves of the humbler ranks of society have also been discovered at Meidt1m. In these the bodies were not interred in the usual
manner, at full length, but lying on their left side, facing the E, and
with knees drawn up.

On the right bank, opposite Rililia and about 11/2 M. from the
river, lies the hamlet of At.dil.s, with some mounds of earth and
debris representing the ancient Aphroditopolis, named after HathorAphrodite who was worshipped here.

The Egyptian name of the town was Tep-yé 0r Per Humor nebt Tep-yé,
tle.'House of Hathor, mistress of Tep-ye", whence the shortened Coptic
Petpeh and Arable Afilr. Strabo states that a white cow, sacred to Hathor,
was worshipped here.

In the Christian period (ea. 310 A.D.) Aphroditopolis gained some celehrity from St. Anthony, who fixed his hermitage in the mountains to the
E. of the town, beside a well and a group of palms. So many pilgrims
of every class, age, and sex sought out the holy man, that a regular posting route, with relays of camels, was laid out across the desert. St. An.
thony, however, fled from his admirers and buried himself deeper in the
mountains. But while he thus shook off his earthly visitants, he could
not so easily escape those extraordinary tempters from spirit-land, at which
Callot has taught us to smile, though to St. Anthony himself, as well as
to St. Hilarion and other similarly persecuted anchorites7 the contest was
one of bitter earnest.

Passing a few islands, we reach (W. bank) El-Wasta (rail.
station, see p. 189; branch-line to the Fayt1rn, p. 116; post-office
and Arab telegraph at the rail. station, 1/4 M. from the Nile).

A small canal (el-Magnon), beginning near the village of Zéwiyeh
(W. bank), runs out of the Nile into the Balm Yasuf (p. 189).

On the W. bank the mountains renede a little, but on the E. bank
their steep and lofty Spurs frequently extend down to the river in
rising picturesque forms. None of the Nile-villages before Benisuéf
need be mentioned. 011 the E. bank stands the Coptio convent of
Jhfr Antonius. - About 2 M. inland from Ztttn (W. bank) lies the
village of Bali (Bouche; rail. stat., p. 189), inhabited by Uopts.

711/2 M. Beniy1tsf, on the W. bank (rail. stat., p. 189; stat., 3/4 M.
from the Nile), is a town of 15,000 inhab., pleasantly situated between the railway and the river. It contains a post and telegraph
office and is the capital of a province, which contains 171 villages
and about 314,450 inhabitants. To the left of the rail. station is
