lie a temple and other buildings, and some large columns and Greek
inscriptions have been found in the quarries. About two days' journey farther to the N. is Gebel Dukhkhdn C'srnolre mountain'), the ancient porphyry quarries of which were worked by the Romans. Here
are the ruins of an Ionic temple of the time of Trajan (never completed), some remains of an irregularly built town, and two large
water-reservoirs. We follow the ancient route hence to Abu Sher
el-Kz'bli. The harbour of Myos Hormos has been silted up and is
now useless.

The JOURNEY TO Kosfsn (there and back 10-11 days at least ]
is more interesting. It may also be made from Kuft (p. 231) or
Luxor (comp. p. 3467. The route from Keneh leads first through
the villages of Shékh Rekdb, Domeh, and Etyrn Umrtin, the first on
the left, the other two on the right side of the road. The first night
is generally spent at the oaravanserai of Bit'Ambar, about 31/2 hrs.
from Ifeneh, where the lofty palms and shady sycamores and mimosa:
offer a most inviting halting-place. The large caravanserai was
erected at the expense of an Ibrahim Pasha and comprises several
separate buildings, covered with dome-shaped roofs and surrounded
by courts and colonnades.

On the second day we advance steadily, ascending almost imperceptibly, through a monotonous plain, intersected in all directions
by small undulating heights. All around us extends the interminable yellowish-gray, sun-bleaehed rocks of the desert; not a
trace of organic life is visible, not a single green tree or shrub At
the hill of el-Karn ('the horn'), which rises to the left of the earavan-route, about midway between Bir'Ambar and Lalptta, the road
from Keneh is joined by those from Kuft and Luzon The only
variety is afforded by an occasional Mubwala or Mahatta. The Mabwalas are simply spaces covered. with camel's dung. They occur on
every great caravan route at regular intervals and are of the utmost
importance as sign-posts showing the road. The Mahattas or halting-places arc 71/9-9 M. apart and serve also as measures of distance.
The Kosér caravans usually pass the second night in the village of
Lahéta (et-6r" heta; f) hrs. from Wm. and Btr'Ambar, 121/2 hrs. from
Keneh), which is chiefly inhabited by'Ababdeh (p. 3120). The small
oasis has two wells, five palms, a few mud-huts, and a half-ruined
Arab earavanserai. Mutton, goat's flesh, poultry, pigeons, eggs, etc.,
way be obtained here. Near the chief well are some fragments of a
Greek inscription of the reign of Tiberius Claudius.

The first Roman station, the Hydreuma, now called by the Arabs
Kay el-Bendt ('castle of the maidens'), is 3 hrs, to the S. of Lalpita.
It forms an oblong 125 ft. in length and 101 ft. in breadth. The
wall inelosing the oblong, formed of layers of sandstone without
cement, was 61/2 ft. high. Within the wall lie 20 small chambers
opening on a rectangular inner court, the only exit from which is
on the N. side. No water is now procurable here. To the N. of the
