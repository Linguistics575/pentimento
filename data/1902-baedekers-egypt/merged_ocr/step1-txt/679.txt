Small Hypostyle Ball (P1. CO, which is 36 ft. broad and 25 ft.
deep. The roofis supported by four pillars. On the S. wall the king,
followed by his wife Nefret-erE holding two sistra, appears offering
incense before the sacred boat with the shrine of Ammon, which is
carried by priests; and on the N. wall is a similar scene before the
boat of RE-Harmachis. Three doors lead from this hall into a long
narrow TRANSVERSE CHAMBER (P1. D); and thence three other doors
admit to three apartments, the two side ones of which are very small.
The central apartment is the Sanctuary Cpl. E), containing an altar,
behind which are seated figures of the four deities worshipped in
the temple - Ptah, Ammon-Re, the deified Ramses, and the hawkheaded Ré-Harmachis.

Immediately to the S. of the great temple is a small Rock Temple,
discovered in 1874 by a party of travellers including Miss Amelia
B. Edwards, the well-known writer, who has described it in her
interesting'Thousand Miles up the Nile'. This is probably a Birth
House, such as are usually found beside temples of the Ptolemaic
period (p. 231). The first cb amber, probably built ofbrick and vaulted, has disappeared. The second chamber, hewn in the rock, is the
Sanctuary, and is embellished with reliefs in excellent preservation.

died during the Nile Expedition of 1885. A Marble Tablet on the rock
commemomtes the battle of Toshl.ceh (p. 369) in English and Arabic.
We now return to the great temple and thence follow the good
path leading to the N. along the river-bank, which brings us in a
few minutes to the smaller
*Temple of Hathor. This temple is hewn in a rock separated by
a valley from the great temple. It also was founded by Ramses II.
