of Isis at Behbit (p. 158).
Takhos (Teller) was dethroned, and died at the Persian court.

Nektanebos (NeMté-nebof) was a powerful monarch, in
whose reign large temples (6.9. at Phila, p. 338) were
once more built. He also built a pylon at Karnak. Egypt,

b. The Graeeo-Roman Period (332 B.C.-640 A.D.).

L Alexander the Great and the Ptolemaic Period.

'Under the Ptolemies the lower valley of the Nile became
once more for three centuries the seat of a brilliant kingdom,
at first under gifted rulers of the most prosperous, richest, and
most powerful state in the world, but afterwards condemned to
shameful impotence under their vicious and degenerate posterity

Egyptians were respected by the Ptolemies, who represented
themselves to the native population as the descendants of the
ancient Pharaohs. Large temples were built during this period.

in 323 the Macedonian empire fell to pieces. Egypt
became the satrapy of
Ptolemy I. Soter L, son of Lagus, who carried on the government at first for Philippus Arrhidaeus and Alexander H.,
son of Alexander the Great, and then for the latter alone.
Alexander II. died in 311, and Ptolemy assumed the title
of king in 305. The Museum at Alexandria (p. F) and
Ptolerrum Hemiu (p.217), in Upper Egypt, were founded
in this reign.

Ptolemy II. Philadelphus married first Amino? 1., daughter
of Lysimaehus, then his sister Arsinoii II. Arsinoé II. was

the'Arsinoite nome' in her honour. Under Philadelphus
