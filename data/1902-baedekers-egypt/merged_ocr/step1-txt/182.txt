QUANTITY AND ACCENTUATION' Ol? VOWELS. Vowels with a eireumflex
accent (A) are long; other vowels are short. The accent falls on the last
syllable when that is long (indicated by I), It falls on the third syllable
from the end when that and the penultimate are short and neither vowel
is followed by two consonants. It falls on the penultimate (1) when that
is long or ends in two consonants and (2) when it is short and does not
end in two consonants. but when the preceding syllable ends in two consonants. Diphthongs (at, er", au) must be reckoned as equivalent to long
vowels. There are exceptions to these rules.
