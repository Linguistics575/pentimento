provinces of Lower Egypt are: (i) Kalyub, at the head of the Delta;
(2) sShariylyeh, i.e.'the eastern', with Zahazih as its capital (3)
Dakhaliyeh with Mansit1ra as its capital; (4) aireaiitiveiv; C5joarbiyeh, i. e.'the western', with Tanta as its capital; (6) Behéreh, i.e.
'of the lake', with Damanht1r as its capital. The last includes the
oasis of 6yhmt The following capitals and commercial towns are
presided over by governors (mrh (ifes) of their own, and are independent of the provinci a1 administration: Cairo, Alexandria, the Isthmus
and Suez, El-'Arish, and Damietta. The eight Upper Egyptian
provinces are those of Gizeh, Btmi.suitf, Fayttm, Minyeh, Assia; (with
the oases of Dakhel and e1-KhirgelO, Giryeh, Hench, and Assm'm.

The chief official in every province is the Mudtr. Each mudir
and mohafez is assisted by a council, or'diwtm', of other offieers.
This council in the provinces consists of a Wakil, or vice-governor;
a chief clerk, tax-gatherer, and accountant, who is always a Copt;
a J.rifi, or supreme judge, and the chief authority in spiritual matters; sometimes the president of a chamber of commerce and chief
authority in civil affairs; a superintendent of police; an architect
for the supervision of canals and other public works; and lastly the
chief physician of the province. The provinces are subdivided into
districts, called Marinas, the chief offieials of which (lfa'miir) are
directly subordinate to the mudir and have their offieial residence
in the more important towns. Subordinate to the marrmlr again is
the rOmdeh, or chief magistrate of the Nahiyeh, or commune, which
may be either rural or urban. In the larger communes the'omdeh
is assisted by the Shékh el-beled, or mayor. The larger towns are
divided into quarters each of which has its magistrate; several such
quarters form an urban district under the jurisdiction of a Shékh ettumn, or prefect, corresponding in rank to the governor of a provincial
district.

According to the census of 1897 the PoPizIos of Egypt proper
was 9,734,405, of whom 9,020,404 were settled (as compared with
6,533,261 in 1883), 601,427 were Beduins. and 112,574 were
foreigners. The numbers of males and females were approximately
equal. The settled population was distributed in 3692 towns and
villages and 14,449 hamlets, farms, etc. Taking the cultivable area
of the country into account (see p. xxxi), the above figures show a
population of 750 per square mile, a density unequalled by any
country in Europe (Great Britain 330 per sq. M.; Belgium 520
per sq. MO.
