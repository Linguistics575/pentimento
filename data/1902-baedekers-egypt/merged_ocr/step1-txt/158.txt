H I STORY OF ART. levil

and artistically worthy from the inferior and mechanical; and the
difficulty is increased by the fact that even the best artists were
unable to emancipate themselves from certain traditional peeuliarities of representation. Thus, for example, the head and trunk in
all statues are carved with a strict regard to symmetry, the only
freedom ever taken being in the arrangement of the arms and legs.
But this principle of full-faee symmetry is common to the art of all
primitive races, and even the Greeks did not finally ernaueipate
themselves from it until their plastic art had attained its zenith.

Our unbounded admiration is commanded by the wonderful skill
with which both artizan and artist could work the hardest stone
with comparatively primitive tools. This extraordinary technical
skill is apparent in all the productions of Egyptian sculpture. But
the qualities that differentiate the genuine works of art from the
others are an admirable fidelity in portraiture and a charming sympathy with nature, which is specially apparent in the representation of animals.

We possess specimens of the art of even the EARLIEST PERIOD
of Egyptian history in the shape of figures of men and animals,



















mostly carved in bone, some of which display a high degree of finish.
The statues dating from the end of the 3rd Dyn. are worked in
hard. diorite, and a certain clumsiness that they display is to be
explained by the refractory nature oftheirmaterial. They are mostly
seated figures of moderate size, with a constrained arrangement of
the limbs; the right hand usually rests on the breast, the left hand
upon the thigh. When an inscription occurs it is given in relief.
But the facial features even in these primitive works are already
handled with a portrait-like firmness. About the beginning of the
4th Dyn. artists began to use the more easily worked limestone
and even wood, and their at immediately received an impetus,
which reached its zenith during the 5th Dynasty. The Museum at
Gizeh contains a number of works of this period, of which the best
are indicated on pp. 79, 80. In all these statues the chief stress is
