dancers, jugglers, and showmen of every kind crowd the town. A
number of European merchants are also to be met with.

From Tania to Mehallet Rah Mania, and Damietta, see pp.159,160.

A branch-line runs from Tanta to the S vi2 Shibz'n et-mms, a small
town on this side of the Rosetta, branch of the Nile, to (26 M.) Ment), the
central point of the 3fend.mteh, one of the most fertile regions in the Delta,
and to (381/2 M.) Ashman.

Tanta is also the starting-point of several LIGHT RAILWAYS: - 1. Vit
Berad (p. 22) and Basyan (9000 inhab.; 3 M. to the S. E. of Sin el-Hugar
and the ruins of Sais; comp. p. 22) to Shin (Chine), and thence viii Sakha
and Nemret el- Basal to Mehallet el- Kobra (Mehazlet el- Kebir; p. 159).

2. Via Damn! to Komr, whence it is to be prolonged to Melmllet erhabva
(p. 159). - 3. To Kafr 1iEiiriit (see p. 22).

Beyond Tanta the train traverses a fertile tract, and beyond
(87 MO Birlcet es-flat/a (braneh-line to Zifteh, see p. 159) crosses
a small arm of the Nile. A number of eotton-eleaning mills afford
an indication of the wealth of the country. Beyond Kuesna, near
Benha, on the Damietta arm of the Nile, is a large viceregal palace,
where'Abbis I. died in 1854 (probably by violence). - The train
crosses the Damietta branch of the Nile.

101M. Benha (railway to Zalpizilr and the Suez Canal, see
p.161), or Benha'l-'Asal, Le.'Benha of the honey', is famous for its
blood-oranges and mandarins, which are much esteemed at Cairo.
Excellent grapes are also produced here.

To the NE. of Benha, not far from the town, and intersected by the
railway, are the insignificant ruins of the ancient Athribis, now named
K6") el-Atrib imd Atl'ib "Etrib. Athribis was founded under the Pharaohs,
and appears to have enjoyed its maximum importance in the Grmoo-Roman
period of Egyptian history. - A short branch- line (trains daily) leads to
(7 M.) Mit Ber ah, and a light railway runs to J1fan..sdra and the Barrage
am Nil (see p. 158).

Gear (109 M.) gram the mountains enclosing the Nile higher
up become visible in the distance. The outlines of the pyramids
then begin to loom in the distance on the right. - Stat. Kaha

120% M. 1.ralyt1b (Calioub) is the junction of a branch- line to
Ztryitrt? (p.161) and of another to the (51/2, M. j Barrage du Nit
r 111).

The Libyan chain becomes more distinctly visible, and we
also observe the Mokattam range with the citadel, and the mosque
of Mohammed'Ali with its slender minarets. The scenery now
becomes more pleasing. Gardens and villas come in sight. To the
left lie the site of the ruins of Heliopolis [ the obelisk of which is
not seen from the railway), Matarfyeh with its sycamores, Kubbeh,
the usual residence of the Khedive, and the large barracks of'Ahbtusiyeh, while on the right we perceive the beautiful avenue leading to Shubra (p. 76). About 3/4 hr. after leaving Benha the train
enters the principal station of L129 M.) Cairo (p. 24).
