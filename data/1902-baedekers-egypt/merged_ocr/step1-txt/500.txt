the roof of the pronaos, which commands a beautiful view of the
valley of the Nile and the hills of the desert.

Finally a walk round the outside of the temple will be found
interesting. The exterior walls, which are covered with inscriptions and representations, are still partly concealed by rubbish.
The reliefs on the E. and W. walls date from the reign ofNero and
other Roman emperors. The large scenes on the S. rear-wall show
Ptolemy XVI. Caesar, son of Julius Caesar, and his mother, Cleopatra, in presence of the gods of Dendera. The faces are purely
conventional, and in no sense portraits. The projecting lions' heads
on the sides of the building were probably intended to carry off the
rain-water.

To the right (NE) of the entrance to the temple of Hathor lies
the so- called Birth House, a small temple half buried in debris.
Similar'Birth Houses' were erected beside all large temples of the
Ptolemaic period. They were dedicated to the worship of the sons
of the two deities revered in the main temple, in the present
case to Har-sem-ti (p. 22 (0. This'Birth House' was built by
Augustus and some of its reliefs were added by Trajan and Hadrian.
On the N. and S. sides is a colonnade with lotus-columns, the
abaci of which are adorned with figures of Bes (p. cxxvi).

INTERIOR. We first enter a vestibule, from which open, on the right
a chamber with a flight of steps and a door to the colonnade, and on the
left two other apartments. A door in the middle admits to a wide space, out
of which open three other doors. Those at the sides lead to corridors,
while that in the centre opens into the birth-chamber proper, the mural
reliefs in which represent the birth and nursing of the divine infant.

Buried in rubbish immediately to the S. of the Birth House is
a large Coptic Church.

Behind the temple of Hathor (to the Any.) is a TEMPLE OF
Tsas, consisting of a vestibule and three chambers. The unattractive and uninteresting building, which is partly covered with rubbish, owes its origin to the Emperor Augustus.
