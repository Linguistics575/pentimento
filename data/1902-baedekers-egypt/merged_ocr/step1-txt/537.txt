258 Route 24. THEBES (E. BANK). 2. Karmic:

Thutmosis 11. Sethos I. restored the reliefs from which Amenophis IV. (p. 203) had removed all allusions to Amman; but he
frequently inserted his own name instead of replacing those of the
ancient kings.

N. SIDE. Left Tower (E.). 1. Sethos I. sacrificing to various gods;
farther to the right, 2, Thutmosis II. (originally Maker√©) before the lien:
headed goddess Werthekew and Hathor; behind the king are priests
carrying the sacred boat ot'Ammon; beneath appears Thutmosis I. before
the Theban triad. The inscription in front of this king refers to the
accession of MakerE. - Right Tower (W.), from left to right: 1. Sethos I.
(originally Maker's) before the hawk-headed Mont, who holds before him
the symbol for'life", behind are priests carrying the boat of Ammon;
beneath are two rows representing Ramses III. in presence of various
gods. 2. Thutmosis II. (originally Maker?) before Ammon and Khons;
behind the king are the goddess Wert-hekaw and Thout, the latter writing upon a palm-leaf; beneath, Ramses III. before the gods. - On the Jambs
of the Central Doorway are inscriptions of Thutmosis III. and Thutmosis II.

On each side in the GATEWAY is Ramses n. before various deities.

S. SIDE. Left Tower (W.). Amenophis Il. seizing captured enemies by the
hair and smiting them with his club; before him is Amman (inserted by
Sethos 1. ]. Right Tower (E.), a similar scene. - On the Door Jambs are
inscriptions of Thutmosis U. (left) and Thutmosis Ill, (right). - Leaning
against the right door-post is an inscription on red granite, recording the
Asiatic campaigns of Amenophis II. The lower part is broken off. - 0n
the B. Side of the right (E.) tower are reliefs and inscriptions of highpriests of Ammon in the reign of Sethos II.

Six colossal seated figures of kings were originally placed before
the S. side of this pylon. The best-preserved of these are: to the W.,
Amenophis L (limestone) and Thutmosis II. (red breecia); to the
E., Thutmosis II. Both the figures of Thutmosis retain their lower
part only; an inscription on the back of that to the W. records
that Thutmosis Ill, restored it in the 42nd year of his reign.

The following Pylon IX, built by King Haremheb, has collapsed.
The reliefs and inscriptions (of Haremheb, Ramses IL, Ramses IV.,
and Ramses VI.) are of little interest. On the S. side are the remains
of two colossal statues, which Ramses IL'usurped'.

Between Pylons IX and X lies a square court, surrounded by a
wall, which is interrupted on the left (E.) side by the ruins ofa
small Temple of Amenophis ll,

In front of the temple is a Gallery, home by ld square pillars embellished with reliefs. Thence a granite portal admits us to a large Hall,
the roof of which rested on 16 square pillars with concave cornices at
the top. On the four sides of each pillar appears AmenoPhis II. before
some deity. This hall is flanked by smaller chambers, two of which
have pillars like those of the main hall. Most of the sculptures on the
walls and pillars are executed in fine low relief, only a few being in
sunk relief. Much of the colouring is in good preservation.

On the E. Wall of the court, to the right (s.) of the temple, are
several important reliefs of Haremheb. At Ph d we see the king
conducting to the Theban triad a number of captives from the inoense-yielding land of Punt, who bear sacks of gold and gems and
other gifts. At Pl. e, to the right of the door, the king appears
leading fettered Syrian captives before the Theban triad.
