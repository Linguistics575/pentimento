Temple. ABU-SIMBEL. "Route. 371

W., so that at sunrise the sun's rays penetrate to the innermost sanetuary. Burckhardt first brought to Europe the news of this sanctuary
(1812 ], and in 1817 Betzoni freed it from the sand which had blown
into it from the W. desert. It was again laid bare by Lepsius in 1844
and by Mariette in 1869 (when the Empress Eugenie visited it);
while more recently (in 1892) the fapade was restored and two walls
built to protect the temple from the sand by Capt. Johhstone, R. E.

As we approach the temple, we first reach a Fore Cofirt (Pl. A),
hewn out of the rock, to which a tlight of steps ascends from the
river. At the bark of this space rises the imposing facade of the
temple. The front of this terrace is embellished with rows of captives
and a hollow cornice, and is bounded by a balustrade, bearing inscriptions m honour of Ammou and IlE-Harruaehis. Behind the
balustrade originally stood figures of hawks and small statues of
kings. Here our attention is attracted by the four *Colossi otttamses fl.
[ PL u, b, c, d), hewn out of the cliff against which their backs are
placed, and arranged in pairs on each side of the entrance to the
temple. Each of these figures is over 65 ft. in height, ale. larger than
the Colossi ofMemno11 (p. 305); but in spite of the enormous scale the
workmanship is admirable, and the countenances have a singularly
pleasant and intelligent expression. They are best viewed from the
sand-hill to the N. of the temple or from the river. The mild C011litenance and characteristic nose of Ramses Ir. are best preserved in
the first colossus 0n the S. (Pl. a). The second colossus has unfortunately been deprived of its head and shoulders, which now lie
on the ground before it. The upper part of the third colossus was
patched up under Sethos L, who added the support under the
right arm.

Upon his head the king wears the double crown; his hands rest upon
his knees; and from his neck bangs a ring bearing the name of Ramses IL,
which is also carved upon the upper arm and between the legs. To the
right and left of each colossus and between their legs are smaller flgures
of other members of the royal family. To the left of the first colossus
(PL a) is Princess NebrtewE, to the right, Bent-Anat, between the legs an
unidentified princess. To the left of the seeond colossus (P1. b) is Tu-E,
the mother of Ramses 11., to the right is his wife Nefret-erE, and between
his legs, Prince Amen-her-khoPShef. On each of the thrones of colossi b
and c, on the sides next the entrance, are two Nile-gods, wreathing the
floral emblems (papyrus and lily) of Lower and Upper Egypt round the
hieroglyphic symbol for'to unite' (comp. p. lxxix), while below is a row
of fettered prisoners, those on the right,
S rians.

y Upon the two S. colossi are a number of Greek, Carian, and Phoenician
inscriptions, of considerable philologiea1 and historical interest. These
were carved by soldiers who had penetrated thus far in the course of
military expeditions The most remarkable is a Greek inscription on
the left leg of the injured colossus (P1. b), written by Greek mercenaries
seat by Psammetikh I. from Elephantine to Nubia. They had advanced
to the second cataract and wrote this inscription on their way back. The
English translation runs as follows:
'When King Psammetichus came to Elephantine, they wrote this, who
came with Psammetichus, son of Theooles, and proceeded via Kerkis as
far as the river allowed of it. Potasimto led the foreigners, Amasis the
