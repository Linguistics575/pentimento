The following THREE Room (P1. D, E, F) have well-preserved
reliefs, with vivid colouring, depicting the emperor in presence of
the gods of Talmis and other deities. Stumps of the two columns
that bore the roof of Room E still remain. Small chambers have
been constructed in the S. walls of Rooms D and E. From Room D
we reach the Staircase, which ascends in the thickness of the wall
to the roof of Room F. Thence the higher roofs of the front portions
of the temple are easily reached by steps. Another staircase leads
from the roof of Room E to the top of the external wall. Descending
a few steps to the left, we reach a Chapel formed in the thickness of
the wall. This comprizes two rooms (with a crypt in the second)
and was probably intended for the cult of Osiris.

The INNER PASSAGE (P1. G) round the temple is entered by doors
in the court and vestibule. The unfinished lions' heads on the exterior of the temple proper are water-spouts. On the rear-wall is
a large relief of the emperor before the gods; below are smaller
reliefs. The two representations of Mandulis, on the girdle-wall
opposite these reliefs, were probably originally protected by a small
wooden chapel. At Pl. a, on the S. side, is a dilapidated Nilometer.

The W. part of the girdle-wall of the OUTER PASSAGE (P1. H)
round the temple was built against the rock. The small Chapel
CPI. I) in the S.W. angle was perhaps a Birth House. It includes
an uncovered court enclosed by columns and sereen-wa11s, and a
Rock Chamber (Pl. L), of which only the door has reliefs (the
emperor before the gods). - Another well-preserved Chapel (Pl. K),
in the N.E. angle, probably dates from the Ptolemaic temple.

Outside the temple are Gateways and ruins of a massive wall
of hewn stones. On the W. hill-slope are Quarries, while the
Remains of the Ancient City, the houses and girdle-wall of which
are easily traceable, stretch down into the plain. In the latter are
towers of rough stone.

We now proceed to the N. from the temple of Kal√©bsheh, pass
through the village, turn to the left, and reach the (1/4 hr.)
*Rock Temple of Bet el-WW, situated halfway up a hill, at
the mouth of a side-valley. The temple, founded under Ramses IL,
consists of a vestibule, a colonnaded hall hewn in the rock, and a
small sanctuary, adjoining the latter. The VESTIBULE, of which only
the side-walls so far as they were formed by the rock are now standing, was used as a church in Christian times, being divided into
nave and aisles and provided with a vaulted brick roof. Olir interest
is excited by the animated *Historical Beliefs on the side-walls.
Two scenes on the left wall represent the king's triumph over the
Ethiopians...
