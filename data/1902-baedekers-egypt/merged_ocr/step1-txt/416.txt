to Suez. BITTER LAKES. 14. Route. 171

A pleasant walk may be taken along the lebbek-avenue, on the
Quai Méhémet-Ali, as far as the chateau of the Khedive and the
water-works. - In a public park in the Avenue Victoria (opposite
the former Villa Lesseps) several monuments found at Pithom
(p. 163) are preserved,

Group of Ramses II. seated between the gods RE and Atum: memorial
stone of Ramses IL, with sculptures and inscriptions-, recumbent lion with
human head, dedicated by Ramses IL to Atum; naos with the figure of a
similar lion (sphinx), dedicated by Ramses II. in the temple of Pithom.

The best way of spending a few leisure hours here is to visit the
Khediviai Chalet, at the influx of the canal into Lake Timsah (near
the Canal Co.'s Hospital) and the hill of El- Bier (p. 170-, 1-2 hrs.;
donkey 1 fro.

CANAL JOURNEY TO SUEZ. After quitting Lake TimsU1 we pass
the foot of the Gebel Maryam, which an Arabian legend points out
as the place where Miriam, when smitten with leprosy for her disapproval of the marriage of Moses with an Ethiopian woman, spent
seven days, beyond the precincts of the camp of the Israelites
(Numbers, xii. )--At the 85th kilometre is situated Tusiin, which
is easily recognised by the whitewashed dome of the tomb of a shiikh.
Excavations near Tustan have led to the discovery of many interesting fossil-remains of large animals belonging to the meiocene tertiary formation, and pieces of fossil wood have also been found here
(comp. p. 110). - A little farther on (near the 90th kilometre) is
the cutting which conducts the Canal through the rocky barrier of
the Serapeum (comp. p. 165).

The Canal now enters the Large Basin of the Bitter Lakes.
Brugseh identifies the Bitter Lakes with the Marah of the Bible
CExoil. xv. 23). At each end of the large basin rises an iron lighthouse, 65 ft. in height. The water is of a bluish-green colour. The
banks are flat and sandy, but a little to the left rises the not unpicturesque range of the Gebel (p.164). The bed of the
Little Bitter Lake, which we next traverse, consists entirely of shellformations.

Near 8haltf et- Terdheh (a station on the right, near the 139th
kilometre; see p. 164) no less than 40,000 cubic yds. of limestone,
coloured red and brown with iron, had to be removed in the course
of the excavation of the Canal. This stone contained teeth and
vertebrae of sharks, bivalve shells, and remains of Bryozoa. In the
layer of sand above the limestone were found crocodiles' teeth and
the remains of hippopotami and other large quailrupei1s. The
monument of Darius near Shaltof is mentioned at p. 165.

We finally reach the Gulf of Suez, which is here so shallow that,
but for the Canal, it might be crossed on foot at low tide. It contains several islands. On the W. bank rise the workshop and
magazines of the Canal Company. Passengers are landed in steamlaunches.
