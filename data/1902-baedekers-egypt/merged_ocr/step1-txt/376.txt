of them the Arabs, for some unexplained reason, have built rude
masses of masonry. All the sareophagi, when discovered by Mariette,
had been emptied of their contents, with the exception of two,
which still contained a number of trinkets. Only a few of the
sareopl1agi bear inscriptions; one hears the name of Amasis, another
that of Cambyses, and a third that of Khabash, leader of the Egyptians
against the Persians (p. lxxxvi).

Near the E. end of the principal passage we reach a side-passage

the right, in a direction parallel with the main corridor, but now
built up, as it was in a dangerous condition. Opposite, we pass

of the tomb-chamber. Everything
was in its original condition in this

Next to the Apis Tombs the private tombs (Mastabas, p/cxliii)
