156 Route 11. TANIS.

About 7 M. to the S.E. of Helw'z'm is the Wtuii Gerraui, 2t desert ravine
running E. and W. between abrupt limestone cliffs. Dr. Sehweinfurth
discovered here the remains of a large Weir of masonry, probably erected
under the Early Empire to arrest the water flowing down the ravine in
ra'ny winters and so to provide drinking-water for the workmen employed
in the alabaster quarries, 21/2 M. to the E. The erection consists of an
embankment, 33 ft. high, 200-260 ft. long, and 145 ft. thick, stretching
quite across the ravine, and constructed of solid masonry faced with limestone slabs on the E. side. Remains of the stone-hats of the workmen
were found in the vicinity.

district. 13 M. Nawa. - 191/2 M. Shibin el-Kanetir is the ruined site of
Tall et-Yeh-eh (Hill of the Jews). Ramses 111. erected a temple here,
covered with glazed mosaic tiles, most of which are now in the Gizeh
Museum. These tiles are of special technical interest, as their colouring
is produced partly by variations in the glazing and partly by the use of
separate inlaid pieces of glass. At a later date Onias, the high-priest of
the Jews, aided by Philometor L, erected a temple after the model of
the Temple of Solomon for his countrymen who had been expelled from
Jerusalem by the Syrian party, and had met with a hospitable reception
in Egypt. A visit to the ruins scarcely repays the trouble, as most of
them are again buried in rubbish.
