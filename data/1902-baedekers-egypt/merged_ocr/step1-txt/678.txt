NORTH WALL (right; PL l). The subject on this wall is the
Battle of Kadesh, the culminating event in the Hittite war, with
which we have already become acquainted in the Ramesseum (pp. 284,
285), and at Luxor, Karnak, and Ahydos.

In the Lower Half of the representation we see first the march
of the Egyptian army, which consists of infantry and charioteers;
then (between the doors to Rooms Fand G), the Egyptian camp, with
the shields of the soldiers arranged round it in a kind of stockade.
The bustle of the camp is represented with great vivacity; the unharnessed horses receiving their fodder, the resting soldiers, the
camp-followers, eta; to the right is the royal tent. The third picture
shows the king on his throne, holding a council of war with his
officers. Below two spies are being compelled by blows to yield
their secret. In the last scene (to the right) the chariot; of the
Egyptians and Hittites are already engaged in battle. - The scenes

REAR (W.) WALL. To the right (PI. m) of the central door is
Ramses 11. leading two rows of captured Hittites hefore Harmachis,
his own deified figure, and the lion-headed Wert-hehe to the left
(Pl. n) he leads two rows of negroes hefore Amman, the deified
Ramses, and Mut. - Between the two last (S) pillars is an interesting Stale (P1. y) of the 35th year of Ramses li., on which is a
long inscription recording in florid terms that Ramses erected large
edifie, es for Ptah of Memphis and presented rich gifts to him.

Adjoining this large hall are eight CHAMBERS (P1. F-N), probably
used to store the temple utensils and furniture. Round the walls
of these, which are covered with inferior reliefs, run stone benches.
We now proceed through the door in the haok-wall to the
