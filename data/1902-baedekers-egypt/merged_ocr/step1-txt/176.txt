closed with gratings. (3) The passage (Dirkeh; Pl. I, 3) leading from
the street to the court is built in the form of an angle, to prevent
people from seeing into the court. (d) The door to the Harim
(PI. I, 12) is placed in a separate court or, failing that, in a retired
part of the court of the Salamlik. (5) The reception-rooms of the
master of the house, the servants' quarters, kitchen, mill, and stables
are arranged round the court of the Salamlik.

The principal rooms, which are usually the only rooms with
any decoration, are the following: the Mandara (Pl. I, U with its
Khazneh or cabinet; the Takhta Bash, raised one or two steps above
the level of the court; and the Jlfaljfad (PI, I), placed in a kind
of entresol. The two latter are built somewhat in the style of open
loggias. To these may be added theFaalcfyeh, a summer-eourt paved
with marble and containing a fountain. All these belong to the
