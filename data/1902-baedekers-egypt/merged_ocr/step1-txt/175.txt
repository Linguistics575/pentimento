clxiv BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS.

Of the ancient Palace: nothing but ruins now remains. The lower
stories, built of massive blocks, have barrel-vaults and pointed arches
of hewn stone, the upper stories have similar vaults in lighter
masonry. In one case, is. the Beshtak Palace in the Bén el-Kasserén quarter at Cairo, we observe remains of balconies and of a
projecting, slightly curved cornice supported by wooden consoles;
and traces of richly painted coffered ceilings are also met with.
From an examination of the scanty remains and with the help of
the Arabic writers, whose descriptions, however, are seldom free
from fanciful exaggerations, we may conclude that the palaces resembled in general the houses of the richer private citizens, exceeding them only in size and splendour.

Dwelling Houses rarely have more than two stories; on the
groundfloor is the Salamlik, the men's apartments, and on the first
floor the J.lartm, the women's apartments and family-rooms. The
following rules are generally observed in the construction of a dwelling-house: - (i) The principal rooms look into the court or garden,
if there be one. (2) The windows looking to the street are as few
