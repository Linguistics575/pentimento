(8). Arabian Cafes. Story Tellers. Musicians. Singers, etc.

Arabian Cafes (lcahwa) are frequented by the lower classes exclusively. The front generally consists of woodwork with a few open
arches. Outside the door runs a ma.s.taba, or raised seat of stone or
brick, two or three feet in height and of about the same width,
covered with mats, and there are similar seats on two or three
sides of the interior. Coffee is served by the lcahwegi at 1/4-1 pias.
per cup (fngtrn), and several narfilehs or shishehs and giizehs (waterpipes) are kept in readiness for the use of customers. The tumbtlk,
a kind of Persian tobacco, smoked in the latter is sometimes mixed
with the intoxicating hashish (hemp, Cannabis indica), the strong
and unmistakable smell of which is often perceptible even in the
street. The sale of hashish is now nominally prohibited in Egypt.

Story Tellers (who in private domestic circles are generally
women) still form a characteristic Oriental institution. Wherever
they make their appearance, whether in the public streets or the
coffee-house, in the densely peopled alleys of the large towns, in
the smallest country villages, or among the tents of the wandering
Arabs, they are sure to attract an attentive, easily pleased, and exceedingly grateful crowd. The more sensational the tale, the better,
and the oftener is the narrator applauded with protracted cries of
'hah', or'Allih', 01"Allahu akbarl'.

Most of the story-teller belong to the so-called Shoram (sing.
Sha'ir), literally'singers'. They are also known as'Andtireh (sing.
'Antari) or Ahu-Ztdtyeli, according as their theme consists of tales
and romances from the history of'Antar, a Beduin hero, or from
that of Abu ZÃ©d. Others again are called Moliadditht, the. narrators
of history, their province being the recital in prose of passages from
the history of Sultan Eg-Z'ahir Bibars, who reigned over Egypt in
1260-79 (p. xcvi). The entertainments of the'all' ttteh u ttteh'
[ thousand and one nights) are, however, no longer heard, as popular
superstition has branded this collection of tales as'unlueky'. The
themes of the whole fraternity are too often of an immoral character.

Musicians by profession, called Aldttyeh (sing. Aldt0, are indispensable on every festive occasion. The usual instruments are
the re.kl.? or tambourine with little bells, the naglcdreh or semispherical tambourine, the zemr or hautbois, the tabl beledi or
drum, the gabl shtimi or kettle-drum, and the daraldkeh, a kind
of funnel-shaped drum (generally'made of earthenware, but sometimes of wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl and tortoise-shell, with
a tish-skin stretched over the broad end), which last is accompanied
by the zummcim, a kind of double flute. A better class of instruments, used for chamber music, consists of the, m'ii, a kind of flute,
the kemengeh or two-stringed violin, the body of Which consists of it
cocoa-nut shell, the rebdbeh, or one-stringed violin with a square
wooden body, the .kis'niin, a kind of zither with strings of sheep
