112 Route 7. BARRAGE DU NIL.

for its intended purpose. For nearly twenty years after 1867 the
Barrage lay useless, as a costly failure; but in 1885-90 Sir Colin
wScott-hfoncrief' sueeessfully completed it at a cost of 460,000L, so
that now a depth of water of about 12 ft. can be maintained.

Nearest the station is the Weir on the E. (Damietta) Branch of
the Nile. This look and weir is over 500 yds. in length, and has
68 vertical iron sluices. From the farther end a pretty avenue of
lebbek-trees leads across the isthmus (about 1/2 M. wide) between
the arms, in the middle of which is the Mem2rtyelt Canal, constructed
both for irrigation and for communication with the district of Menafiyeh (p. 23). The Weir on the W. (Rosetta) Branch of the Nile is
about 450 yds. across and has 58 vertical iron sluices. The navigation of the river is carried on by means of spacious basins and locks,
fitted with swing-bridges, at either end of the two weirs and also
on the Mentdtyeh Canal. The superstructures of the works are built
in an effective Norman eastellated style. A junction-canal above
the weirs connects the two branches of the Nile, and is used to
regulate the depth of water in each. When the river is low, the W.
branch receives all its water through this canal.

The island, formerly occupied by fortidisations, is now covered
with attractive and extensive gardens, laid out with flower-beds,
artifieial rocks, eto., by Mr. Draper, an Englishman.
