removes the lock from the shrine of Horus. 2. He opens the door of
the shrine. 3. He stands in a reverential attitude, with pendent
arms, before the god. 4. He offers incense to his deified parents,
Euergetes I. and Berenice. 5. He offers incense before the sacred
boat of Hathor.

The Sanctuary is surrounded by a Coumooa from which ten small
SIDE CHAMBERS (Pl. r-x) open. These, used for various treligious rites and
for storerooms, are adorned with reliefs and are faintly lighted by holes
in the roof. In each of the corner-rooms (Pl. m and VIII) is the entrance
to a crypt, closed by a stone slab.

We now return to the small hypostyle hall and pass through
Room XIX to the Inner Passage between the exterior of the temple
proper and the interior of the girdle-wall. On the outside of the
temple walls are lions' heads as water-spouts and four rows of reliefs
and inscriptions. At the foot of the wall appear the king, the queen,
and a procession of local deities approaching the three chief gods of
Edfu. On the inner side of the E. girdle-wall (m. hh) the king appears before the various gods of Edfu; on the N. wall (PI, gg) are
similar scenes and long hymns to the gods of Edfu. On the W.
wall (Pl. ff) are more important reliefs and inscriptions representing the contests of the god Horus with his enemies who are depicted as crocodiles and hippopotami.

The chief are the following: "t Scene (below, to the right). The king,
standing on shore, attempts to trausfix a hippopotamus, which bends its
head aside. Horus, who is accompanied by his mother Isis, does the same;
in his left hand he holds a chain, and in his right a javelin; beside him
is his mother Isis, and behind, at the helm, is a small Horus. - 2nd Scene.
The king appears on land, before two ships, in each of which are a Home
and an assistant with a boar's head. Horus holds the hippopotamus with
a chain and pierces its head with a javelin. - 5th Scene. The hippopotamus lies on its back, with a chain fastened to its hind-feet. - 7th Scene
(the finest of all). Horus, in a ship with expanded sail, aims a blow with
his right hand at the head of a hippopotamus, the hind-foot of which is
caught in a line held in the god's left hand. Isis kneeling in the bow of the
boat holds the head of the animal by a cord. The king, standing on the
bank with two attendants armed with javelin and knife, seeks to pierce
the skull of the hippopotamus. - Farther to the left (opposite the pylon):
The king, the ram-headed Khnum, the hawk-headed Horns, and the ibisheaded Thout are dragging a net, in which are not only birds, fishes, and
a stag, elm, but also two Asiaties and negroes, the ancestral foes of Egypt.

A subterranean staircase, curving to the E., leads from the E.
part of the passage round the temple to an ancient Nilometer, outside the temple, also reached from without by a spiral staircase. On
the walls of the latter is the scale, with demotic numbers. The subterranean communication with the river has been interrupted.

Finally, an *AscENT TO THE Top or' THE PYLON is recommended.
The doors on the S. side of the Court (to the right and left of Pl. a
and b) lead into dark chambers, from each of which an easy staircase
of 242 steps in 14 flights ascends to the platforms of the towers.
Doors on the landings of the staircase admit to small chambers,
