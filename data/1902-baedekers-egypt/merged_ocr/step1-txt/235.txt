A. Cairo.

PLAN or- CAIRO. The European names of the streets used formerly
to be written up in French only, so far as they were written up at all;
but since the British occupation the Arabic names have been used,
transliterated on a careless and inexact system (p. clxixJ. Our plan follows
this transliteration in general, correcting, however, the more obvious
defects (e.g. the English'ee' is represented, as in the text, by'i'). Some
of the French names have been retained.

a. Railway Station. Hotels and Pensions. Restaurants and Care's.

Railway Stations. 1. PRINCIPAL STATION (P1. B, i), to the N.W. of
the town, beyond the Isma'iliyeh Canal, here crossed by the Eantaret

The hotel-commissionnaires, with their omnibuses, and representatives of the tourist-agents await the arrival of the fast trains and take charge
of luggage. Small baggage may also be entrusted to the Arab porters,
with numbered metal tickets on their arms, who will conduct the traveller
to the hotel-omnibus or procure a cab for him (tariff, see p. 20. Heavy luggage is sent on to the hotel in special vehicles.

Hotels. The leading hotels at Cairo are excellent, and even those of
the second class are well f1tted up, nearly all having electric light, baths,
eta; children and servants pay 1x: th'-price; comp. p. xviii. As all the hotels
frequently are full, especially in Jan., Feb., and March, it is a wise precaution to telegraph for rooms from Alexandria or Port Sa'id.
