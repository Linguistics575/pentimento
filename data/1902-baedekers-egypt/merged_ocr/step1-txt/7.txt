t The contraction'pias.' is used uniformly throughout the Handbook
for the great piastre (hirsh). Travellers should be on [ hair guard against
the tendency of shopkeepers and others to substitute the'small' for the
'great' piastre.

In COPPER there are also pieces of 1/2 and1/4 millieme (called also
2 Para and 2 Para pieces, from the old system), but these are used by
tourists only for bakshish.

The Pound Sterling (théh ingliai) is worth 97 piastres 5 milliemes;
the French Twenty Prune Piece (Bint, derived from Napoleon Bonaparte)
77 pias. 2 mill.; the Turkish Pound (Mejidiyeh) 873/4 piastres. A'purse'
is equivalent to 500 piastres or about 1033.
