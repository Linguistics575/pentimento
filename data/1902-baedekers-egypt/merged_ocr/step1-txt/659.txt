the present ground-level. - To the W. of the temple is the Quarry
which supplied the stone for it. To the N.W. are some early-Egyptian
Tombs, which were used again during the Roman period. - Near
Debit are the remains of a Roman camp, which is mentioned under
the name of Parembole in the qtinerarium Antonini', a list of Roman
military stations.

At Dimri (W. bank) is an ancient wall; and on the E. bank
farther on is the fragment of a quay-wall, with a staircase in the
middle. The island of Merges (Markos), next passed, has some
unimportant ruins, apparently of medieval origin.

171/2 M. Dehmit, on both hanks. - 25 M. Anbarekdb, with
considerable hamlets on both hanks.

To the right (W. hank) next appears the small temple of
Kertassi, an attractive building on a hill, recalling the'kiosk'
at Philae (p. 343). At the entrance, which faces N., only two Hathorcolumns and four other columns (two on each side) are now standing. In the screen-wall on the W. side is a small door. Only a
single e, ross-hearn now rests upon the architraves of this little temple,
which cannot have been more than about 25 ft. square.

To the S. are extensive *Sandstone Quarries, which yielded the
stone for the temples at Philae, and which contain numerous Greek
votive inscriptions (and one demotic) dating from the Roman imperial epoch (Antoninus, Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus,
Caracalla, Gordian). These are addressed to Isis and to the Nuhian
deities Sruptikhis and Pursepmunis. There are also two busts and
an empty niche, with an Egyptian doorway. - At the end of the
quarries (3/4 M. from the temple) is a Roman Fort (perhaps the
ancient Tzitsi), with a girdle-wall of large hewn stones, the inner
core of which has disappeared, leaving only the outer shell. The
gateway on the N. side shows the Egyptian hollow cornice. On
the W. side we may trace the ancient ditch. Within the walls is the
Nubian village of Kertassi.

Farther on the river-valley narrows, and lofty cliffs approach
close to the stream.

Tafeh (W. hank), the ancient Taphis, is prettily situated among
palm-trees. Beneath the umhrageous sycamore trees on the riverbank are the remains/of a small quay, on the S. side of which is a
small Nilometer. At the N. end of the village lies a small Temple
of the Roman period, which was left unfinished and has no mural
reliefs. The entrance faces the S. The facade is supported by two
columns with floral capitals. Its only sculptured ornament is the
winged snn-disk above the central door (walled up). In the interior
of the temple are: four standing columns, with tastefully carved
capitals. - To the N. are the remains of some large structures,
perhaps the relics of a fortified camp. - To the S. of the village lay
a second temple, which, however, was entirely destroyed in the
19th century. To the W. is a Mohammedan cemetery of an early
