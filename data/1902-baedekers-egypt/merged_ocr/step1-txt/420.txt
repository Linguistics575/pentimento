Harbour. SUEZ. f 6. Route. 17 3

also near the British Cemetery, are gardens in which fruit and vegetables flourish luxuriantly. The large buildings to the N. of it are
the former English Naval Hospital and the engine house of the
Water Works. - To the E. of the canal is the large camping-ground
for caravans Numerous pilgrims to Mecca (17,600 in 1901), ehiefly
from Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and Bokhara, pass through Suez.

As the N. extremity of the Gulf of Sun ends in a shoal, which
is dry at low water, the entrance of the Suez Canal and the necessary harbour-works were constructed 2 M. to the s., at the beginning of the deep water. A stone Pier, 50 ft. wide, on which is
the railway mentioned at p. 172, connects the town with these
works, and affords apleasant promenade (donkey 5-8 piss, according
to the time ], commanding beautiful views of the'Atil.rs Mts. on
the W. and the range of the Peninsula of Sinai on the E.

At the end of the pier is an artifieial Island, about 60 acres in
area, constructed of the large quantities of earth dredged from the
canal. To the left, on this island, are the railway-station of TerrePlein, at Port Tewlik, and the Small Dock of the Canal 00. Farther
on is the Avenue Héténe, over 1000 yds. in length, with a lighthouse at the extremity, beside which is a statue erected by M. de
Lesseps to Lieutenant Waghorn (p. 166), an enterprising Englishman, who, after having spent the best years of his life in establishing regular communication between England and India vizi Egypt,
died in London in poverty in 1850. The large basin farther to the s.,
Port Ibrahim, is capable of containing 50 vessels of the largest
size and is divided by massive bulwarks into two parts, one for
vessels of war, and the other for trading vessels. The mouth of
the dock is protected by gates and a massive breakwater. The dry
dock is 135 yds. long, 24 yds. wide, and 23 ft. in depth. - The
situation'of the sand-banks and of the navigable channel is of course
best seen at low tide.

For a visit by Rowing Boat (p. 172) to the docks and canal
entrance, calm weather is desirable. The beautiful clearness of the
green water, with its curious shells and seaweed, and the almost
invariable beauty of the sunsets render a boating-excursion here
unusually attractive.

EXCURSION TO THE SPRINGS 01? Moses (7-8 hrs.). - Boats (p. 172)
and Donkey: (there and back about 20 pias.) should be ordered a day in
advance, and an early morning start should be made (about 8 a m.) Calm
weather is very desirable for this excursion also, not only for Ihe pass: rge
in the boat (by which the donkeys must also be conveyed) but also because the driving sand in the desert is very disagreeable in a high wind.
About 2 hrs. should be allowed for the stay at the springs, including time
for luncheon (brought by the traveller) and for a walk on the beach in
search of shells.

Thtrdistanee from the usual landing-place of the boats, in the
entrance to the Suez Canal (comp. the map), to the Springs is
about 61/2 M. The whole of the route thence by land traverses the
sand of the desert, skirting the sea, Which lies to the right. To
