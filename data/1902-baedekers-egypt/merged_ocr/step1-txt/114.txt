succeeded by his eldest son Abbas II. Eilmi (b. July 14th,
1874), whose accession was confirmed by a firman of the
Porte, dated March 26th, 1892. His independence of action
is controlled by the British plenipotentiary, Lord Grower

force under Sir Herbert Kitchener (now Lord Kitchen er of

is a British Governor-General, who is also Sirdar of the
Egyptian army. Kharttnn was rebuilt as" the centre of
