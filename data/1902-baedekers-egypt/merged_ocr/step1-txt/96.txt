TanutamOn, son of Shabako, succeeded in recovering Egypt
for a brief period, but was finally defeated by the Assyrians and driven back into Upper Egypt. The Assyrian
rule in Egypt was, however, approaching its end.

The absence of the main Assyrian forces, which were
engaged in distant wars in Babylon and Elam, afforded
an opportunity of shaking off the yoke, which was seized
by Peammetikh of Sars, son of N ekho (see p. lxxxiv), with
the help of Gyges, King of Lydia. The foreign garrisons
were expelled; the authority of the small native princes
was gradually curbed; and Egypt was again united. Tanutamon was forced to retire to Ethiopia, which from that
period onwards ceased to belong to Egypt and made no
farther'attempt to invade the lower Nile valley.

the Early Empire and to revive the ancient forms. This reversion
to the ancient times appeared also in other departments, spch as
literature, the spelling of inscriptions, and even the titles of oflieials, so that the period of the 26th Dyn. may be styled the Egyptian Renaissance.
