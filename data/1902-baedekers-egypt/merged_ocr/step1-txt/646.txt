A subterranean staircase to the S. of Hadrian's Gateway leads to a
Nitameter (lights necessary), which has hieratic and demotic scales as well
as the customary Coptic one.

From Hadrian's Gateway we now proceed to the N., and beyond
the ruins of a Temple of Harendotes (p. cxxvi), built by the Emp.
Claudius, we reach a small Coptic Church, with a semicircular apse,
into which have been built blocks with the name of Claudius, from
the temple of Harendotes. Farther on is a ruined Temple of Augustus. built in the 18th year of that emperor's reign. In front of
it is the Foundation in which was discovered the inscription of Cornelius Gallus, now at Gizeh (p. WI). Before the staircase lies a
granite architrave, with a Greek inscription. -.... To the N.W. are
the remains of a Coptic Convent and of a house with a bath.

At the extreme N.E. of the island, and in the axis of the Temple
of Augustus, is a large Roman Town Gate, with three arches, the
side-arches being lower than that in the centre. The N. side-arch
has a domical stone vault in the [ lumen style. This gateway was
probably erected by Diocletian.

The main street of the Coptic town (p. 337) runs to the SE.
from the town-gate to the ruins of a larger Coptic Church, where it
turns to the S.W. In this street, about 50 paces to the E. of the
Temple of Isis, lies the
*Temple of Hathor, dedicated to Hathor-Aphrodite by Philometor and Euergetes IL The Colonnade in front of it (recently
restored) and the Sanctuary (now vanished) were added by Augustus.
The columns in the former were united by screen-walls, on which
Augustus appeared sacrificing to various forms of Hathor. On the
columns themselves are charming representations of flute-players,
harpers, servants with antelopes, figures of Bes playing the tambourine and the harp and dancing, apes playing the lyre, priests
carrying an antelope, ete. The temple proper is in better preservation; in front of it are two plant-eine, which were joined to
the walls by means of screens.

From this teryple we follow the main street as far as a small
chapel. Hence a lane to the left leads to the
WKiosk, the chief decoration and the characteristic symbol of
the island. Its slender and graceful form greets the eyes of travellers
as they approach the island; and rest and luncheon may well be
enjoyed on this beautiful spot. The Kiosk, which dates from the
