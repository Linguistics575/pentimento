ornamented with horns. To the N. (Pl. f) the captured Libyans are
marshalled before the king. Above is a lengthy inscription deseribing the victory. The court is flanked on the right and left by
covered Colonnades. The ceiling of that to the right is borne by
seven square pillars, against which stand colossal statues of the
king as Osiris. The left (8.) colonnade has eight papyrus columns
with ealyx-eapita1s. These last belonged to the facade of a royal
palace, which formerly stood to the S. of the temple and communicated with the first court by three doors and the large window
mentioned below. The scenes on the colonnade-walls represent
the wars, victories, and captives of the king At the end the king
is seen on his way to the feast of Ammon, attended by his fanbearers.

The inscriptions and sculptures on the Second Pylon, bounding
the rear of the court, are still more interesting. 0n the Right Tower
(PLE) is a long inscription recording the triumph won by the king in
the 8th year of his reign over a league of peoples from Asia Minor, who
menaced Egypt by sea and by land from Syria. On the Left Tower
(P1. F) the king leads before Amman and Mut three rows of prisoners, representing the conquered in this campaign. These have
beardless faces and wear curious caps adorned with feathers; their
pointed aprons, decorated with tassels, differ from those of the
Egyptians. The inscription describes them as belonging to the tribes
of the Danauna and Pulasta (perhaps Philistines'0.

The granite gateway of the second pylon, which is approached
by an inclined plane, admits us to the Second Court, Which is 125 ft.
long and 138 ft. broad. In the Christian period it was converted
into a church, the last remains of which were finally cleared away
in 1895. This court is almost an exact reproduction of the second
court of the Ramesseum, even to part of the relief-embellishment
but it is in much better preservation. On all four sides are colonnades. On the N. and S. the colonnades are supported by columns
with bud-capitals; on the E. are square pillars with Osiris-statues,
and on the W. is a terrace with eight Osiris-pillars in front and
eight columns behind. On the columns and pillars the king is
shown sacrificing to the gods. The reliefs on the back-walls of the
colonnades illustrate events in the life of Ramses, some showing
great festivals in which he took part, others the warlike deeds of
himself or his army. - N. and NE. Colonnades. In the upper row
are Hkeno from the Great Festival of the God Min, which was also
celebrated as a Coronation-festival, as we have seen in the Ramesseum (p. 286). First (Pl. 1) appears the Pharaoh, home from his
palace on a richly-decorated litter with a canopy. He is followed
by his sons (names wanting) and numerous courtiers, while he is
preceded by priests carrying censers, a priest who recites, and a
troop of soldiers, each of whom wears two feathers on his head. The
