Private Apartments are seldom to be obtained for a shorter period
than six months, so that an arrangement at a pension or at one of the
less expensive hotels will frequently be found almost as cheap. Information as to rooms may be obtained at the chief shops or from agents whose
addresses may be best learned at the consulates. A sunny aspect should
be chosen, and a detailed written contract invariably drawn up. A
bargain as to food may be made with some neighbouring restaurant;
for only those conversant with the language should attempt to keep house
for themselves with native servants.
