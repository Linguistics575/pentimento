beneath all these rooms and the Sanctuary, but the ceilings and floors have
in many cases fallen in.

To the W. of Vestibule D is a small room CPI. I), embellished
with representations of the king before Isis. A door (P1. n; p. 313)
here affords an exit from the temple. Here also is the approach to
the STAIRCASE, ascending first to a chamber situated above Room VII,

Hadrian's Gateway, a small portal in the ancient girdle-wall
of the temple, adjoined by a much ruined vestibule. This structure
was built by Hadrian and embellished by Marcus Aurelius and
Lucius Verus. On the lintel are two reliefs: Hadrian before Osiris,

The VESTIBULE, which was never completed and is now much ruined,
contains some interesting reliefs. Above the door in the S. wall Wi. o)
