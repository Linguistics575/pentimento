lenism. The earlier illiberal limitation of Greek interests to Greekspeaking countries was exchanged for a cosmopolitan liberality;
classical culture enjoyed a second flowering-tue, which harbingered
the culture of the Roman imperial epoch and indeed that of the
Renaissance also.

The great buildings of the Greek period in Egypt have gradually
disappeared almost without leaving a trace, though some lingered
until last century, for the simple reason that most of them were
built of marble which could be used conveniently as material for
other buildings or for lime-burning. The majestic Alexandrian
Serapeum with its forest of pillars has disappeared, leasing as its
only relics the so-called'Pompey's Pillar' which originally stood in
the middle of the temple-court, the recently excavated foundations,
and a number of isolated blocks of stone scattered throughout the
city. Yet in size and conception this building was one of the greatest
creations of ancient Architecture, and the first achievement of the
new style originated by Deinoerates, the gifted architect of Alexander
the Great, which exhibited a combination of Oriental and ancient
Greek forms. The Serapeum, the common national sanctuary of the
Greeks and Egyptians, was elevated high above the city by means of a
huge substructure cut out of the rock. The platform on the top, reached
in the late-Roman period by a staircase of a hundred steps, formed
a spacious temple-eourt, which was surrounded with colonnades and
adorned at the entrance with propyleea and in the centre with the
above-mentioned huge column, which was probably intended to
have a companion. The temple, with the colossal statue of Serapis,
occupied the background. This colossus and the temple itself were
experiments in the new style of incrustation just introduced from
the East. The statue of Serapis is said to have included six different
metals, besides all kinds of gems, but the exact method of its construction is still uncertain. It was apparently, however, related to
the new style of wall-decoration, which can be minutely traced in
its prototypes, beginning, and progress. The walls of Babylonian
and Persian royal palaces were built of sun-dried bricks and then
laced with slabs of alabaster, glazed tiles, or even with gilded metal
plates; in like manner the brick walls in the buildings of the Ptolemies
were covered - first of all, it is said, in the Serapeum - with slabs
of marble, glass, or metal, and were adorned with friezes, reliefs, or
mosaics. So late as the end of the 16th cent. the Italian traveller
Filippo Pigafetta [ 1533-1604) saw in Alexandria fragments of wall
decoration'of wonderful world, in houses that had survived from
antiquity and were still inhabited; and even in the present day the
heaps of rubbish which have gradually accumulated above the ruins
ufantiquity have been searched through and through for the real and
imitation gems once used in this mural decoration. Extensive
remains of marble incrustation, which was often combined with the
rarest varieties of stone, have recently been found on the coast at
