the garden commands a good survey of the grounds. The large
building to the N. is a house of correction.

The'Abhkstyeh, which lies in a healthy situation on the edge
of the desert, about 11/2 M. to the N.E. of the Bab I.rudntveh
(P1. E, 1; p. (W), is a group of houses and barracks, founded by
'Abbis Pasha in 1849. On the right side of the principal street
stand the Hétel Abbas (p. 25) and the viceregal Mitttmy School and
Barracks, equipped in the European style; ou the left side are the
European and the Austrian Hospitals (p. 28), more Barracks, the
conspicuous Fadawtyeh Mausoleum (end of the 18th cent.), and
the viceregal Observatory (to be removed to Helwen; see p. 155).
- The railway-station of Demirdtuh (p. 106) lies to the W. of
'Atsbs1siyeh; a goods-line thence to ILslwtn passes through the village.

The main road at'Abbigtyeh crosses the embankment of the old
railway to Suez, and, near the station and village of Kubbeh (p.106),
also the railway to Merg. About 11/2 M, from'Abbistyeh, not
quite halfway to Matariyeh, it passes the garden (no admission) of
the winter-residence of the present Khedive (marked Palais Tuuftl.t
on our Maps). - Thence to Mr.tar'iyeh, see p. 106.

The Gebel el-Ahmar, or Red Mountain, rises to the E. ofVAbb2siyeh.
At its base, reached by a eutiagewoad diverging to the right a short
distance outside the Bath Hustaiveh (p. M), is an old Viceregat Chdteau.
The mountain consists of'e very hard miocene conglomerate of sand,
pebbles, and fragments of fossil wood, cemented together by means of
silicic acid, and coloured red or yellowish brown with oxide of iron.
For many centuries the quarries here have yielded excellent and durable
mill-stones, and material for the construction of the roads of Cairo and
Alexandria.

On the left bank of the Nile, opposite the island of Rm », stands
the Palace of Gizeh, just below the now decayed village of Gizeh,
which is mentioned in the middle ages as a summer-residence of the
Mameluke sultans. This palace now contains the great tieeregal collection of Egyptian antiquities. - We cross the Nile by the Great
