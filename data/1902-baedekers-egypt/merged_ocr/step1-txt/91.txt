lxxx HISTORY.

V. DYNASTY.
Egypt now reached the zenith of her civilization; art, in particular,
attained a perfection never again reached. The pyramids of the
kings are mostly near Abusir (p. 129), where also special sanctuaries
were built for the sun-god Rs (p. 129).
Onnos (Unis), the last king of the 5th Dyna, built his pyramid near
Sakkara (p. 134). After his death internal dissensions seem to
have broken out, resulting in the accession of a new dynasty.

VI. DYNASTY.

Under this dynasty the power of the kings was more limited, and
the small principalities recovered some of their independence. In
foreign affairs far-reaehing commercial relations were entered into
with Central Africa, Punt (the S. coast of the Red Sea), Syria, etc.

Towards the end of the 6th Dyn. the monarchy fell and civil
strife broke out. In the N'. independent kings established themselves at Heracleopolis, others at Memphis (VIL-N. Dynasties). In
the S. the chief power was seized by Theban princes (XI. Dynasty),
named Entef and Mentuhotep, who gradually succeeded in reuuiting the whole country. Their small tombs lie near Drath Ahu'l
Negga (p. 262). The first ruler over reunited Egypt was Ameaemhet L, with whom begins
A. The Middle Empire (about 2200-1700 13.0.).
*XII. DYNASTY.

This was Egypt's most prosperous period, and an epoch of great buildings. There is hardly a considerable town in Egypt without some
traces of the building activity of the kings of this dynasty. Literature
and art also flourished. The kingdom was organized as a feudal state.
