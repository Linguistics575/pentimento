exlvi HISTORY OF ART.

halls, the walls of which were occupied by religious inscriptions
and scenes (comp. p. 263). Like the passages within the pyramids,
these were exclusively destined for the reception of the sarcophagus, while the rock itself represented the mass of masonry
originally reared over the grave. Since there was no room among
the mountains for sepulchral temples, the latter were built (usually
on a large scale) on the plain, where their ruins remain to this
day (19. 2.60).

The grandees of the late period followed the example of their
predecessors under the Middle Empire by imitating the tombs of
the Pharaohs in preparing their own private graves. This was the
case in Thebes at least. At Asas'if (p. 284) near Thebes we find in
their tombs a complicated series of corridors and halls, the walls of
which are decorated with nothing but religious texts and represents
tions. Unfortunately none of the royal tombs of the last native
dynasty have as yet been discovered; these must have lain near the
large capitals in the Delta. Even of the larger private tombs of this
epoch few have been found, with the exception of those above
mentioned at Thebes and a few others at Gizeh and Salrlplra, now
buried in rubbish.

The Tomas OF THE HUMBLER CLASSES must, of course, have
largely outnumbered those of the grandees; but beyond the pit
which concealed the bodies, and some gravestone, they have left
no traces. From pictures we know that under the New Empire they
were frequently in the form of small brick-pyramids; but all have
fallen victims to time. The poorer classes were frequently buried
in Common Tombs, consisting of long corridors constructed underground by speculators. In these the corpses were laid in plain eoff1ng
or merely bound to a plank, accompanied by simple gifts for their
use in the future world. But these common graves are now almost
all covered by drift sand, and all trace of them is lost.

11. Sculpture and Painting.

No fair estimate of the achievements of early-Egyptian sculpture or of its masters can be obtained from a study of the ordinary
colossal statues, sphinxes, and temple-reliefs; for these, though
they are now the most conspicuous examples of Egyptian sculpture, were, with few exceptions, intended exclusively for decorative
purposes and were executed accordingly. For such an estimate an
acquaintance must be obtained with works produced by genuine
artists, such as the portrait statues and reliefs now preserved in the
Museum of Gizeh, and the reliefs on the walls of mastabas, of rock
tombs, and of a few special temples (notably the temple of Sethos
at Abydos). Genuine art-works, it is true, are but thinly sown in
Egypt, and, owing to the enormous mass of sculpture that has been
preserved, it is perhaps more difflin1lt in this than in any other
branch of art for any one but an expert to discriminate the good
