Quarters. CAIRO. 4. Route. 63

in 1799. These solidly built gates are, along with the Bib ez-Zuwéleh
(p, 48), the only survivors of the sixty in the Fitimite walls of Cairo
and were erected by the vizier Bedr el-Gameli in the 11th century.
Their plan resembles that of ancient Roman gateways. Both have
an outer and an inner gate, flanked by square or round towers, and
united by means of a vaulted inner court.

In the Mohammedan cemetery outside the Bib en-Nagr is buried Johann Ludwig Burckhardt (d. 1817), known to the Arabs as'Shékh Ibrahim,
the distinguished Oriental traveller, whose works are still of high authority. - The two towers with iron basins, which we observe on the left,
belong to the City Water Works, constructed in 1855- 66 and several times
enlarged. The water is pumped up from the Nile by steam. - From the
Bab en-Naer to the Tombs of the Khalifs, see p. 64

We return from the Bab en-Nasir by the Shdri'a Bill, en-Nair,
passing (right) the Okella of Kai'it Bey (p. 66), one of the most
interesting secular structures in Cairo. Farther on, in the tilMri'a
tl-thrmiillyeh (P1. E, 3, 2), to the left, is the Conventual Mosque of
Sultan szars el- Guehankirf1300, with the tomb of the founder. We
next follow the Sentustyeh to the right to the Shin" a en-NaNytsin
and Khordagiyeh, the Sikkeh el-Gedideh, and the Muski (p.42).

The remaining features of the N. quarters are of little interest.
The principal thoroughfare is the Sharia or Boulevard Clot Bey CPI.
c, B, A), which runs to the N.W. from the N.E. angle of the
Ezbekiyeh (p. 39), to the Ltmtm Bridge and the Railway Stations
o. Q4). - In a side-street to the W. of the Shari'a Clot-Bey lies
the Chief Coptic Church (Pl. C, 2), recently built and dedicated
to St. Mark. The interior is architecturally uninteresting, but it is
well worth while to attend a Coptic service here (p. 71). Adjacent
are schools and the house of the Coptic Patriarch. - The open
'plaee' at the end of the Shiri'a Clot-Bey is known as the Bond
Point de Faggdla or Me" ddrs Bib el-lladid CPI. B, 2). At the end of
the Sheri'a Bib el-Hadid, which also leads hither from the W. side
of the Ezbekiyeh, is the handsome Sebil of the Mother of Iama'ft
Pasha. (P1. B,'O.
