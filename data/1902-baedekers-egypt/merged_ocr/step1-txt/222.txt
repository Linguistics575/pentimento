The fagade of the vestibule is articulated by two Egyptian columns, with elaborate flower-capitals, which bear a frieze adorned
with the winged solar disk and with sparrow-hawks; above this is
the flat arch of the pediment. Inside, in deep niches to the right

white limestone in the Egyptian style. The door in the rear-wall of
the vestibule is surmounted by the Winged sun's disk and a Uraeus
frieze. To the right and left, on pedestals, are two large serpents
with the Egyptian double crown, the caduceus of Hermes, and the
thyrsus of Dionysus. Above are shields with heads of Medusa.
