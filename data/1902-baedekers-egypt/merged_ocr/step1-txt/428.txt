sacred to Sobk, and the Greeks therefore named the city Ce-ocodz'lopolis,
or'crocodile-town'. It never attained to any political importance. Ptolemy II. Philadelphus seems to have converted it into an essentially
Hellenic city by adding new quarters, founding Greek temples and educational institutions, and introducing the Greek language. This monarch
also raised Queen Arsinoii to the dignity of patron-goddess, and the district
became known as the'ArsinoirittNome', and the capital as the'City of
the dwellers in the Arsinoitic Nome', or, more briefly, as Aru'noi At the
time of its greatest prosperity it had over 100,000 inhabitants.

For a visit to the ruins, we.proceed due N. from the mosque of
Kai't Bey, following the trodden path through the extensive modern buriale
place The embankment, like ramparts, to the right and left, are remains of Saltpetre Pam, such as were formerly used to extract the sebakhsalts from the rubbish-heaps of ruined towns. To the N. of that on the
left lies a mound of rubbish known as Ham el-Kharytina, the highest part
of which. es-MPa. encloses the ruins of some large building. During the
last twenty years important discoveries have repeatedly been made here of
papyri, most of which are now in the Archduke Rainer's collection in
Vienna, while others are in the museums of Berlin and other towns. Most
of the popyri are Greek business documents (records, receipts, letters, etc.),
but some literary specimens have also been found, containing fragments
from Homer Euripides, Thucydides, etc. Others are written in Coptic,
Persian, Syriac, or Arabic.

Beyond the railway-embankment, to the left, we now see the highest
mound, the Kdm Fdrig (65 ft.), the top of which commands a survey of
the whole of the Ifayr1m. To the right (W.) are the black mound known
as K6m ms-Nsimshi, and the long Kom et~Tmyairm Where papyri have also
been discovered. More to the N., on the W. verge of the ruins, rises the
1mm et-uryyimeh ('borurrnoand0, which was used in the 5-6th cent. after
Christ as the burial-place of the poorer inhabitants. In the tombs here
numerous toys, well-preserved textile fabrics, etc., have been found.

We follow the path to the N. and presently find ourselves in a section
of the ruins, which, in Dr. Schweinfurth's word,'to this day produces
the impression of a city but recently destroyed. The walls of the houses
still stand far and wide, but the narrow interlacing lanes, bewildering
in their ramifications and interrupted by countless trenches and holes in
the ground, render it impossible to obtain any clear idea of the general
plan'. Un the extreme N. edge of the ruins, partly projecting into the
cultivated land, we may detect traces of the ancient principal temple,
which was dedicated to Sobk. This existed as early as the 12th Dyn.,
and was afterwards rebuilt by Ramses 11. Within the rectangular girdlewall, which was built of sun-dried bricks, lie fragments of an arehitrave
of red granite and isolated blocks of limestone bearing the names of
Ramses u. and other kings. Most of the temple, however, was removed
by the later inhabitants and incorporated in new buildings. Beside the
temple lay originally the sacred pond in which the crocodile of Sobk
was kept.

We now turn to the W. and reach the Balm Tina Canal, on which
are several water-wheels. The large mounds of rubbish at the village of
Menshiyet'Abdallah probably also belonged to the ancient city. We return
southwards, skirting the canal and the edge of the cultivated ground. To
the right rises the large mound of Kdm eerulllfyeh ('mound of the Nile
earp0, on the S. side of which are the walls of an apparently fortified
building, probably dating from the Arab period. Farther to the S. are
the Kom et-Taydm (see above), and the above-mentioned Saltpetre Pans.
