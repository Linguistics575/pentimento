of Memnon. THEBES (W. BANK). N. Route. 307

flood of verses spread over the legs of the colossus, most of them by the
vain eourt-poetess Batbittat One of her effusions (on the left leg) relates
in 16 hexameters, that Memnon greeted Hadrian, as well as he could (uic
auvatovl when he perceived the emperor before sunrise, but that a clearer
note, like that caused by a blow on an instrument of copper, was emitted
at the second hour, and that even a third sound was heard. Hadrian
greeted Memnon as often, and all the world could see how dear the emperor
was to the gods.

Ta1billa, by an inward impulse stirred'
'Has written all she saw and all she heard'.

By far the best verses are those on the front of the pedestal by Asklepiodotus, who calls himself imperial procurator and poet. They may
be translated as follows:
'Sea-born Thetis, learn that Memnon never suffered pangs of dying'.

'Still, where Libyan mountains rise, sounds the voice of his loud crying'
' (Mountains which the Nile-stream, laving, parts from Thebes, the hundred-gated)'
'When he glows, through rays maternal with warm light illuminated'.

'But thy son who, never-sated, dreadful battle still was seeking',

'Dumb in Troy and Thessaly, rests now, never speaking'.

The ruins in the neighbourhood of the colossi are unimportant.
About 3 min. beyond them is another Statue of great size, now,
however, almost completely, covered by arable land. The ruined
temple, in front of which the above-mentioned statues stood, has
left an important memorial in the shape of a conspicuous colossal
Sandstone State, erected by Amenophis m. It is now broken in
two. The hieroglyphics and the representations refer to the dedication of the temple. In the rounded pediment the Pharaoh appears
receiving the symbol of life from Amman on the right, and from
Sokar-Osiris on the left; above are the winged sun-disk and the
name of Amenophis III. Behind the Pharaoh in each case is his
consort Teye. - Still farther to the N.W., at the foot of the Libyan
mountains, two fragments of an ancient briek-bqilding, known as
Ethn el-lrk? 8n, project like huge horns from the ground.

133 M., in 81/2411/2 hrs. The railway is a narrow-gauge single line;
passengers from Cairo change carriages.

The line sometimes skirts the left bank of the Nile, sometimes
the edge of the desert. -13 M. Er nent (Armani). The town (p. 303)
lies on.the left bank of the river, where also the long ridge of Ge..
betta (p. 309), with its sh√©kh's tomb, is visible. In the background
rise the hills of the Libyan Desert. A little farther on, we see on
the opposite bank the extensive palm-groves and smoking ehireneys of (281/2 M.) Ma! iMeli (Asffm el-1iattiaa, p. 309). The railway now skirts the edge of the desert, until just before Esneh, when
it returns to the river-bank.

36 M. Esneh. The town with its slender minarets lies on the
opposite bank of the Nile; the temple (p. 309) is not visible from
the railway. Donkeys (without saddles) meet the trains to convey
passengers to the ferry.
