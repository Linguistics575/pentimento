28 Route d, CAIRO. Physicians.

animals are to be found in great numbers at all the most frequented points;
at night in front of the cafes; and the stranger who wishes to hire a
donkey is sometimes well-nigh overwhelmed by the charge of light cavalry
to meet his wishes. The donkey-boys of Cairo (preferable to older drivers)
often possess a considerable fund of humour, and their good spirits react
upon their donkeys. The traveller should sternly repress the first symptom of the usual cruel goading of the animals to quicken their pace
Galloping is forbidden within the town. The balgshish should be proportionate to the quality of the donkey and the behaviour of the donkey-boy.

Dragomens (comp. p. xxii). Only travellers who are pressed for time
require a Cicerone. The best (5-8 fr. per day) are to be had at the hotels,
where also a list of the guides licensed by the police may be seen. If,
however, the traveller knows a few words of Arabic, and is not in a
hurry, he will soon find his way through every part of the city and the
environs with the aid of his donkey-boy alone.

Cycles may be hired from Marina d. Co., Shgriea Kaer en-Ni ] (RondPoint Snares).
