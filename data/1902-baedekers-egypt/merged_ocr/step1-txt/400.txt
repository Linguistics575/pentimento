most cases very ancient and differ materially in style from the
mushrebiyehs of Cairo. A glance into one of the ancient court-yards
is interesting. The principal street, which is upwards of 1 M,
long, forms the busy and well-stocked bazaar of the place. Damietta
contains four Christian churches.

An interesting excursion may be made to the mosque of Abut
jrfaTrteli, in the suburb of el-thldneh, to the N. of the town. The
building appears to date from the period of the old town of Damietta, and has Cutie inscriptions in front. The interior contains
numerous columns, two of which, standing on the same base, are
believed, like those in the Mosque of (Amt at Cairo, to possess
miraculous powers. (Jaumliee-patientss, for example, are said to
be cured by licking one of them.) The minaret is embellished with
early-Arabian ornamentation.

A trip by boat down to the Mouth of the Nile (B6ghik0 takes 3-31/2 hrs.,
or, if the wind is favourable, 11/2 hr. only (fare there and back 20 pias.).
Numerous dolphins will be observed in the river near its mouth.

and Port Sa'id there are tolerable hotels in the European style, where local
guides may be engaged for the environs.

The excursion to the Suez Canal may be conveniently made on the
way back to Europe (or on the way to Palestine), as the Australian, China,
and Indian mail-steamers much at Suez or Arma" tTipa. For information as
to the arrival of these steamers apply to the offices mentioned on p. 26;
exact particulars as to days and hours are not generally obtainable until a
very short time before the appearance of the steamer. Comp. also pp. 6, 168.

generally more picturesque and diversified than in the W. Delta.
