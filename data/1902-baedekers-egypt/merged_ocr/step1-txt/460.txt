On the W. bank the railway approaches 61er to the river.
176 M. Roda. (railway-station, p. 190; accommodation at the station), a considerable p1ace (5000inhab.) on the W. bank, with post
and telegraph oiNes and a large sugar-factory.

About A M. inland (W.) from Roda1 between the Baht Yr'asuf and the
Nile, near the village of Ashmunén, lie the ruins of the once famous
city of Khmmm ICOytie Shmum, the 27eemopolis of the Greeks, which
from a very remote period was the chief seat of the worship of Thout,
the god of writing and stiecce. This town was also the capital of the
name of hares, in Upper Egypt, whose princes under the Middle Empire
were buried on the E. bank of the Nile at el~Bersheh (see below). Nothing
now remains of the extensive temples of the ancient city. The French
Expedition found a fine Portico of the Ptolemaic period, with two rows
of six columns each. - At Tuna el-trebel, near Ashmunén, are the extensive
necrOpolis of the ancient city and a rock-inscription (much dilapidate') of
Amenophis IV. (p. 5203).

Nearly opposite Roda, on the E. bank, amid palms of unusual
size and beauty, lies the village of Shékh'Ahddeli, to the E. of which
are the ruins of Antinoupolis, the town erected by Hadrian in
honour of his favourite Antinous. The handsome youth is said to
have drowned himself here, to fulfil the oracle which predicted a
heavy loss to the emperor and so to prevent a more serious disaster.
The remains of a temple of Ramses IL, the relic of an earlier
foundation on this site, may be traced. The vestiges of public
buildings are now exceedingly scanty, though the French Expedition saw a triumphal arch, a theatre, and streets flanked with
columnar The streets and ground-plans of the houses, however,
are still recognisable. The rooms were small and the walls were
made mainly of Nile bricks. There are some underground apartments of flat Roman bricks, reached by stone staircases. Near the
ruins of one of the largest buildings lies a marble basin, which
must have had a circumference of at least 23 ft. Among the palms
in the village lies a fine Corinthian capital.

To the S. of Shékh'Abideh we reach (179 M.) Der Abu Hennis
(Convent of St. John), called also simply ed-DY, a village inhabited by about 2000 Copts. Near it is a ruined town of the
Christian epoch, known as eb-hfedtneh. 011 the N. side of a ravine
in the hill behind the village are numerous ancient cave-like quarries, which were fitted up at an early date as Christian chapels or
anehorites' dwellings. The largest Chapel, in which divine service
is held, is said to date from the time of the Empress Helena; it
contains paintings of saints and scenes from the New Testament, but
those in one of the side-chapels (Raising of Lazarus, Marriage at
Game, etc.) are better. - Dér en-Nalrhleh (see below) may be
reached within 1/2 hr. from Dér Abu Henuis.

1811/2 M. Rtramiin, opposite which, on the E. bank, a little
way from the river, lies the Coptic village of Dér en-Nakhleh, the
'convent of the date-palms', also known as el-Bersheh. Beside a
Coptic cemetery to the E. of the latter begins a desert-ravine,
running N.W. and S.W., and named Wtidi en-Nalchteh or Wtdi cl
