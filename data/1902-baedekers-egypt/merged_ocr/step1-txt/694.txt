OMDURMAN. 37. Route. 389

The ramparts round the BAGARA TOWN are strong and massive,
but have no banquette within for the defence. The Mahdi's Tomb
(P1. Ileras destroyed by the British and its contents scattered. The
base (b' ft. thick), vaulting, and dome of this ei1ifiety are said to have
been executed by Neufeld, a German kept in captivity for many years
by the Khalifa. Beside the tomb are an open space in which the derTish army was reviewed, and a Mosque (P1. 2), now used as a messroom by the Egyptian officers. Close by are Abdullahi's House (P1. 3)
and the two-storied House of the Shiloh ed-Dfn (Pl. i), his son. The
latter is the only dervish house with glass windows. Beside it is
the grave of an English war-correspondent, who fell here. Permission must be obtained from the Civil Secretary for a visit to the
treasure-howse Bilt el-Amana or Be" t el.W & (P1. 5), which contains
memorials of Gordon and trophies of weapons. Visits may be paid
to Slatin Pasha's House. now the te1egrapl1-offiee (Pl. 9), and to
Emir Yakub's House (Pl. 6), which was occupied by the governor
until the summer of 1901. The Prison (P1. 12), where many Europeans languished, is situated 500 yds. farther on, at the S. angle
of the town-wall. It is sometimes known as the'Saier Prison' from
the name of the jailer under the Mahdi and Khalifa.

A wide new street, passing the clean quarter of the Greek shopkeepers, leads hence to the N.W. to the (1/4 M.) large *MARKET
PLACE, which presents a busy and variegated scene of African life.
All the articles of consumption of Central Africa are to be seen here
in profusion: curious spices of a hundred different varieties, drugs,
and perfumes; soda, saltpetre, salt; betel, bead-nuts, seeds, and
wood of every kind; glass beads, filigree work, toilet-butter, angaribs (bedsteads). the dried flesh of wild animals, ostrichs, etc.
Skilful smiths, and saddlers dealing with hippopotamus hide, may
be seen at work. Sudanese weapons and curiosities may be purchased
of P. Luisa. Goods intended for importation into Central Africa
may be seen in the covered sheds on the S. side of the market-place.
.The place of execution under the Khalifa was also in the marketplace, and to the E. of it is the pit ('Tomb of the Martyrs') into which
were thrown the heads and limbs of the condemned. - A visit to
the *MÃ©mda, on the bank of the Nile, should not be omitted; here
are the markets for ivory, india-rubber, feathers, and corn. The
slave-market is, of course, a thing of the past. The Sails el-2.Taron,
where women were sold, is now devoted to milk, ornaments, ointments, and basket-work.

The population will on the whole impress the stranger as unfriendly and importunate. The warlike oppression of the last decade, the fanatical enthusiasm for pilgrimages, the desire for
plunder, and the devastation of whole provinces have assembled here
a confused medley of the most diverse races and stocks: Bantus
and grotesque dwarf negroes from the W. Sudan; Semitic and Hamitic tribes from the desert, such as Nubas, Bagara, Kababish,
