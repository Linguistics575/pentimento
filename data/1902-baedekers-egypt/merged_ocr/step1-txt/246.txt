several times subsequently. The town suffered severely in other
ways also, and indeed its whole history, so far as recorded, like
that of the sultans and the Mamelukes themselves, seems to have
presented an almost continuous succession of revolutions, rapine, and
bloodshed. As most of the Mameluke sultans who resided in the
citadel died a violent death, so the reign of almost every new potentate began with bitter and sanguinary contests among the emirs
for the offiee of vizier, while but few reigns were undisturbed by
insurrections in the capital. During the third regime of Mohammed
en-Nis.dr, who had been twice deposed and as often recovered his
throne, a persecution of the Christians took place at Cairo. The
Christians, of whom great numbers resided in Cairo and throughout
the whole of Egypt, were accused by the people of incendiarism. Their
churches were closed or demolished, while they themselves were so
ill-treated and oppressed, especially in the reign of Sultan 561%
1351-54), that many of them are said to have embraced Islamism.
In 1366 and 1367, in the reign of Sultan tillia'litm, sanguinary conflicts took place in the streets of Cairo between hostile parties of
Mamelukes, and in 1377 Sha'ben himself was tortured and strangled
in the citadel. Even greater disorders attended the dethronement
of Sultan Bargain (1389), when the wildest anarchy prevailed at
Cairo, the convicts escaped from their prisons, and in concert with
the populace plundered the houses of the emirs and the public
magazines. The following year another rebellion among the Mamelukes restored Barlttllt to the throne. Scarcely, however, had he
closed his eyes and been succeeded by Farag (1399), when the Mamelukes again revolted, and renewed Bor1fr1ets took place for possession of the citadel, during which the city was partly plundered.
Similar scenes were repeated on almost every change of government.
The turbulence of the Mamelukes, who were always treated with
too much consideration by the sultans, became more and more unbearable; they robbed the people in the markets, assaulted citizens
in the public streets, and grossly insulted respectable women.

On 26th Jan., 1517, the Osman sultan Selim L, after having
gained a victory in the neighbourhood of Heliopolis (p.107), entered the city. Tt1mtrn Bey, the last Mameluke sultan, was taken
prisoner and executed (p. 48). Selim caused the finest marble
columns which adorned the palace in the citadel to be removed to
Constantinople. Thenceforward Cairo became a mere provincial
capital, and its history is almost an entire blank down to the period
of the French expedition. - On 22nd J uly, 1798, after the Battle
of the Pyramids, Cairo was occupied by Bonaparte, who established
his headquarters here for several months, and quelled with sanguinary severity an insurrection which broke out among the populace on 23rd-26th September. At the beginning of the year 1799
Bonaparte started from Cairo on his Syrian expedition, and on his
return to France7 Kleber was left as eornmander-in-ehief of the
