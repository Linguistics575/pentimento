el-Gami'a, 99 yds. square. With the exception of the ceilings, whicl
had to be restored in order to protect the interior, the building hat

altered. The most important renovations were carried out by Lagin
afterwards Sultan Mamitir. It was he who erected the mausoleumlike Dome (PL 6) in the centre of the court, covering an octagona
basin on the site of an old well. The court is surrounded by a double
