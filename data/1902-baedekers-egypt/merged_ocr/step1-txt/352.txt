of Gisela. GREAT PYRAMID, 8. Route. 119
at an angle of 2 (P 41', and is altogether 1061/2 yds. in length. We
follow this passage as far as the point d only, 20 yds. from the
entrance. Here diverges the ascending passage de, the lower end
of which is filled with massive blocks of granite, placed in position
after the interment of the mummy to protect the grave from robbers.
The hardness of the material of which this barrier consists compelled
the Arabian treassure-hunters o. 116 ] to avoid it, and to force a
new passage CPI. d) thro ugh the softer limestone. This is the roughest
and most awkward spot on the whole route. Beyond the granite
blocks we enter a passage CPI. di), 21 yds. in length, with a very
slippery floor, beyond which lies the Great Hall CPI. o.

Before entering the latter, we may pass through a formerly concealed
opening in the pavement tn the horizontal passage e ], which leads to
the so-called Chamber of the Queen (Pl. g). This passage is at ilrst 3 ft.
9 in. only in height, but at a distance of 61/2 yds. from the chamber the
flooring sinks a little, so that the height increases to 5 ft. 8inches. The
N. and S. sides of the chamber are each 17 ft in length, and the E. and
W. sides 18 ft. 10inches. The height is 20 ft. 4 in, including the pointed
roof, which consists of enormous blocks of rock projecting beyond the
sides of the walls to a distance of 51/2 it. into the surrounding masoru-y.

The jointing and polish of the fine-grained Mokattam limestone
in the Great Hall CPI. h ] form an nnsurpassable marvel of skilful
masonry, of which the Arab' historian'Abdellatif accurately remarks,
that neither a needle nor even a hair can be inserted into the joints
of the stones. The Great Hall is 28 ft. high and 155 ft. long. The
lower part is 3 ft. 4 in. in width; and the upper part, beyond the
last of the panels of stone, each of which is l ft. 8 in. thick and
2 ft. high, is 7 ft. in width. The roof is formed of seven courses of
stone projecting one above the other and crowned by horizontal
slabs. The incisions 011 the walls were used to facilitate the introduction of the sareophagus. On the floor are irregularly hewnhollows,
which now serve to prevent the visitor from slipping. At the end of
the Great Hall is a small horizontal passage, 22 ft. long and 3 ft.
8 in. high, expanding about the middle into an Antechamber (PI. o,
which was once closed by four trap-doors of granite. The remains of
one of these slabs, in its pendent position, should be noticed. We
next enter the King's Chamber CPI. k), the most interesting of all.
The N. and s. sides are each 17 ft. in length, the E. and W. sides
341/3 ft, and the height is 10 ft.; the floor of the chamber is
1391/2 ft. above the plateau on which the Pyramid stands. The
chamber is entirely lined with granite, and is roofed with nine
enormous slabs of granite, each 181/2 ft. in length, above which
five chambers have been formed, which may be reached from the Hall

h by means of ladders.

These hollow chambers were by no means necessary to prevent the
roof of the King/s Chamber being crushed by the superincumbent weight.
The over-cautious builders have here made an error in their calculations.
The name of Kheops was found in the two highest chambers (P1. o, p).

The King's Chamber now contains nothing but an empty and
mutilated Sarcophagus of granite, bearing no trace of an inscription,
