IX. Greek (Alexandrian) Art in Egypt.

By jProfessor Theodor Schreiber of' Leipsic.

Early Egyptian Art did not die out with the Pharaohs; both
under the Ptolemies and, later still, under the Roman emperors,
temples in the old style were raised, restored, or enlarged, and were
adorned as before with statues, frescoes, and obelisks, while the
worship of the old national gods was continued in them unchanged.
But the new rulers and the Greeks who immigrated with them
established Hellenic customs, art, and science in Egypt, as they had
been established in the other kingdoms of Alexander's successors.
Alexandria, the mighty creation of Alexander the Great, destined to
be the centre of his empire, became, as the residence of his successors, the Ptolemies, who distinguished themselves as patrons of

supremacy, and Pergamum at a later date also entered the lists.
In the Museum of Alexandria investigations concerned with the
direct observation of men and things, were carried on side by side
with the literary and historical studies of scholars. Poets and artists
gathered in crowds at the brilliant court; and the royal passion for

- mingled there in the closest association, in which the Greeks,
though the dominant element, adapted themselves to many of the
native religious and social customs, and learned to keep their eyes
open to the good qualities of their neighbours. Thus there arose in
Egypt the neo-Greek culture which we are accustomed to call Het
