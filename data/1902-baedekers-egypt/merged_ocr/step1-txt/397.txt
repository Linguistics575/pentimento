HISTORY. lrLansirt, (tie. Lthe victorious') was founded by Sultan Mo,
hammad Kimi ] Ibn'Adil in 1222, as an advantageous substitute for Damietta (comp. p. 160). The first serious attack made on Manyira was by
the Crusaders under Louis IX, of France in 1249. After encountering great
diftleulties they succeeded in crossing the Aghrniln Canal, but in the neighbourhood of Maru.sora they were repeatedly defeated by the young Sultan
el-Mo'aggam Turanshah. Their fleet was destroyed, and'famine-fever'
broke out. When the ill-fated Crusaders attempted to escape they were
intercepted by the vigilant Turks, who thinned their ranks terribly and
captured the king with his brother Charles of Anjou and a number of
knights. On 6th May, 1200, Louis and his barons were released on payment of a heavy ransom, and on surrendering the town of Damietta.

The small mosque of Sanga, near the Russian vice-consulate, contains columns brought from older edifiees, with Byzantine capitals of
Corinthian tendency, bearing Saraeenie arches. The mimbar (pulpit)
and ceiling are still embellished with remains of fine wood-carving,
which was originally painted. - An unfounded tradition points out
an old house of Saladin's time, near the 1i2-Mutm1fiy Mosque, as
the prison of Louis IX. (see above). - The Palace of the Khedive,
a large and unattractive building, is used as a law-wart.

The road to the ruins passes through a luxuriant growth of trees
(lime-trees, silver poplars, and willows, besides the eunt-tree, the
lebbek, the tamarisk, and the bernt1f shrub). A walk of 40 min.
brings us to the ruins of Behblt el-Hager, the ancient
Iseum or Isidis Oppidum of the Romans. The ancient name of
the place was Hebet or Per-ehbit, or'House of the god of Hebet'
(i.e. Horus), of which the modern name is a corruption. Isis also
was worhipped here. Within a still distincly traceable girdle-wall
rises a heap of ruins, known as Huger eb-thirntis (buffalo stone),
which form the remains of the once magnifleent ISIS TEMPLE "
BrurBirr, built by Nekht-Har-ehbét (30th Dyn.) aud Ptolemy lI.
Philadelphus. The ruins of the venerable sanctuary form an imposing and most picturesque mass of blocks: fragments of columns
and architraves, ceiling slabs, and other remains, altogether about
400 paces in circumference. The structure consisted entirely of
beautiful granite, tshiefly grey, but partly red in colour.
