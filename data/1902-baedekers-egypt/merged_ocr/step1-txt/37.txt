(11). Tobacco.

Cigar-smokers will find it very difficult to become accustomed
to the Oriental tobacco, but they will find tolerable cigar-shops at
Alexandria and Cairo, most of which have been established quite
recently. As a general rule smokers are recommended to carry with
them, both in going to and returning from Egypt, as little tobacco
as possible, especially if they travel by the overland route, as a
rigorous search is often made and a heavy duty exacted, both at
the Egyptian, and at the French, Austrian, and Italian frontiers.
Travellers returning to England direct, with their luggage booked
through, are allowed half-a-pound of tobacco or cigars free of English duty, or they may bring three pounds on payment of the duty
th. per 1b.) and a small fine.

Tobacco (dukhklitin) is kept in good condition by covering it with
a moist cloth, with which, however, it must not come in contact.
Strong fldlmi) or mild (bdrid) may be asked for according to taste.
8tamhtlli is a long and fine cut tobacco, the best qualities of which
(U) come from Roumelia and Anatolia, and the inferior from the Greek islands. The Syrian tobacco
(15-20 fr. per ohha ], which is cut less regularly, and contains parts
of the stalk, is considered less drying to the palate than the Turkish.
It is of two kinds, the .ktrthti, or light-brown, and the geheli,
or dark-brown, a mixture of which may be used. The latter, which
derives its colour from being dried in the smoke of resinous woods,
is known in Europe as'Latakia', from the region of N. Syria where
it is chiefly grown (Lidilsiyeh1 but that name is not applied to it
in the East. The native Egyptian tobacco [ dukhkhzin beledi, or
akhdar, green tobacco), now no longer grown, was of very inferior
quality. The natives used often to gather the leaves from the plant,
dry them in the sun, rub them to pieces, and smoke them quite fresh.
Tumbdk, 01' Persian tobacco, is used in a moistened condition in
the long nargUehs or water-pipes only, and is lighted with a particular kind of charcoal. The smoke of these pipes is drawn into
the lungs.
