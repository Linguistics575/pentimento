Interesting relief representing the Homage of an inferior king Entef
before King Na-khru-re Mentuhotep III., and before the king's mother

and quarries.

five doorways, separated from each other by pillars (P1. a-d) at varying distances, and crowned with the astragal and concave cornice.
We enter by the middle door, on the lintel of which are chiselled the
