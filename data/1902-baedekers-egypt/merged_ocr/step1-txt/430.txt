eslr-8lreryi, i.e. river of the East. Skirting the E. bank of the stream
for 1/2 hr. towards the N., we reach the
Pyramid of anara, the tomb of Amenemhét III. This consists
of unburnt bricks of Nile mud mixed with straw, and, when its sides
were perfect, covered an area about 115 yds. square. The limestone
incrustation, however, had disappeared even in the Roman period.
The nucleus of the structure is a natural mass of rock, 39 ft. in
height. The dilapidated summit is easily reached in a few minutes
by a flight of well-worn steps. The entrance to the pyramid, on
the S. side, was discovered in 1889 by Prof. Flinders Petrie. An
intricate series of passages in the interior leads to the tomb- chamber
which is 22 ft. long, 8 ft. Wide and 6 ft. high. Amenemhét Ill.
and his daughter Ptahnofru were interred here.

On the S. the pyramid was adjoined by a large temple, the
main portion of which was probably dedicated to the manes of
Amenemhét. This edifice, however, which served as a quarry for
centuries after the Roman period, has completely vanished, with
the exception of an extensive space strewn with small splinters
of stone and fragments of fine granite columns. Traces of its walls
may also be recognized in the sloping banks of the Bohr Séla. There
is no doubt that this edifiee was the famous Labyrinth, of which
ancient travellers speak with such unbounded admiration.

For the best description we are indebted to Strabo, who visited the
Labyrinth in person. He says:'There is also the Labyrinth here, a work
as important as the Pyramids, adjoining which is the tomb of the king
who built the Labyrinth. After advancing about 30-40 stadia beyond the
first entrance of the canal, there is a table-shaped surface, on Which rise
a small town and a vast palace, consisting of as many royal dwellings
as there were formerly names. There is also an equal number of halls,
bordered with columns and adjoining each other, all being in the same
row, and forming one building, like a long wall having the halls in front
of it. The entrances to the halls are opposite the wall. In front of the
entrances are numerous long covered passages, intersecting each other and
thus forming such a winding path, that the ingress and egress to each
hall is not practicable to a stranger without a guide. It is a marvellous
fact that each of the ceilings of the chambers consists of a single stone,
and also that the passages are covered in the same way with single slabs
of extraordinary size, neither wood nor other building material having
been employed. On ascending the roof, the height of which is inconsiderable, as there is only one story, we observe a stone surface consisting of large slabs. Descending again, and looking into the halls, we may
observe the whole series borne by twenty-seven monolithic columns. The
walls also are constructed of stones of similar size. At the end of this
structure, which is more than a stadium in length, is the tomb, consisting of a square pyramid, each side of which is four plethra (400 ft,) in
length, and of equal height. The deceased, who is buried here, is called
Imandes. It is also asserted that so many palaces were built, because it
was the custom for all the nomes, represented by their magnates, with
their priests and victims, to assemble here to offer gacnriiice and gifts to the
gods, and to deliberate on the most important concerns. Each name
then took possession of the hall destined for it.'

The remains of brick buildings, which still linger on this site and
were erroneously regarded by Lepsius as remains ot the Labyrinth, date
from a village of the Roman period.

To the N. of the pyramid stretches the large neeropolis used since
