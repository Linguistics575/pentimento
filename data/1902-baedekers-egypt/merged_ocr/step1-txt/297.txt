78 Route 6. MUSEUM OF GIZEH.

the Survey Department (Director, Capt. Lyons) and the Mudiriyeh
of the province of Gizeh, and a tine view of the Pyramids. The
tramways halt at the Zoological Gardens (p. 105) and at the lam1ingplaoe for the ferry from Old Cairo (p. 69), about 5 min. walk from
the entrance of the Museum in the palace of Gizeh.

The Palace of Gizeh, a huge rambling edifice, built in a light
and 11ns11bstantial Oriental style, with about 500 saloons and apartments, was erected by the Khedive Isma'tl for his harem at a cost
stated at 120 million francs. In 1889 the Museum of Egyptian
Antiquities, formerly at Bt1lilr, was installed here, but the process
of transferring this valuable collection to a more suitable and safer
edifice, recently completed, has begun (see p. 40).

The "Museum of Egyptian Antiquities is the most valuable
collection of the kind. It was founded by the eminent French Egyptologist Aug. Mariette (d. 1881). The present director is the no less
eminent G. Maspero; the conservator is Emil Brugsch-Bey, assisted
by Ahmed Kamal Bey and G. Daressy .--- The earliest description of
the Museum is Mariette's'Les Principaux Monuments du Musée de
Boutaeq' (1884)', Maspero also published a'Guide du Visitewr auMusée
de Boulacq' (1884). The present detailed Catalogue [ 1894), which
is sold at the entrance, though not perfect, is quite indispensable
for students. The more important and the more recently acquired
objects are provided with full descriptive labels in French. Owing
to the alterations consequent upon the removal to the new building,
the following description does not pretend to accuracy on all points.

The museum is open in winter daily, except Mon. and Frid., from
5330 till 4.30, in summer (thh April to 15th Oct.) from 8.30 to
12; admission 5 piastres, free in summer. Sticks and umbrellas are
given up at the entrance and returned at the exit (no fee).

A special room is reserved for Students; apply to the director or to
one of the conservators. - In the Sale Room (R. 1in duplicates, ete., of the
antiquities may be purchased, at prices fixed by the Museum authorities
and plainly marked on the objects offered. Purchases here made have, of
course, a guarantee of their genuineness (comp. also p. xv). A permit
to export is given with each purchase. - Travellers going on to Upper
Egypt should provide themselves here with a GENERAL ADMISSION TICKET
"f the Service des Antiquite's de TEggpte (f 1 Eu, romp. p. 1811), admitting
them to all monuments.

In the Garden near the entrance is a tall pedestal supporting
a Sphinx in red granite, with the names of the Pharaoh Ramses IL,
added later. On the right of the road to the palace is the top of an
Obelisk, dating from the reign of Queen Makere, whose figure was
replaced by sacrificial tables under Thutmosis IO. On a platform
of masonry in front of the main entrance rests the marble sarcophagus
of Aug. Mariette (see above).
