The exterior of the S. wall is covered with a long inscription, recount.
ing the building of the temple and its endowments.

Near the village of El-8herlieh, about 1/4 M. to the N. of the
Temple of Ramses IL, are the ruins of the ancient city and of a
Shrine of Osiris, dating back to the 12th Dynasty. - To the S. of
the latter are scanty traces of a second temple.

Farther to the W. lies a small fort, surrounded by two walls (the
outer wall the lower), named Shunet es-Zehth, which probably served
as a place of defence against the incursions of the Beduins from
the W.

A Coptic Convent (more like a village) to the N.E. of this point, dating
from the year 1306 of the Coptic era, scarcely repays a visit.

The rubbishunouudg at the foot of the hills, IN. to the S.W. of the
temple of Ramses IL, called by the Arabs Umm el-Ga'ah ('mother of pots'),
contain tombs of kings of the lat and 2nd Egyptian dynasties, including
those of Usaphaz's and Afiehis (Ist Dyn.). They were explored by Amélineau
and Flinders Petrie, but there is now practically nothing to be seen

Near the village of Ghabat, to the S. of Abydos, is an ancient quarry.

65 M. STEAMBOAT upstream in 9 hrs., downstream 6 hrs.

Above Beliineh the course of the Nile lies almost due E. and W.
The Dam Palm (Hyphsena thebaiea) becomes more and more common and increases in size and beauty as we travel southwards (comp.
p.1ix). About t M. from the S.bank lies Samhad, on ancient rubbishmounds. The Arabian Mts. approach close to the river.

28 M. Nag' Hamadi, on the W. bank, a town of 4400 inhab., is
a railway-station (p. 191). A large railway-bridge crosses the river
here (see p. 191).

31 M. Kim (W. bank), at one of the sharpest bends in the stream,
is a large but miserable-looking village. It was the home of Shekh
Selim, who died about 30 years ago, at a very advanced age, after
sitting stark naked for 53 years on the bank of the Nile at the spot
now marked by his tomb. He was regarded by pious Moslems with
great honour and was deemed to possess great powers in helping
navigation. In the neighbourhood are the scanty ruins of the ancient
Diospolis Farm.

34 M. Kagr ertayiul (E. bank), a steamboat- station, is probably
the ancient Khenoboskion. Close to the bank is a steam-engine for

raising water.

About 41/2 M. to the E., near the village of Isba, among the Arabian
hills, are the Tombs of Princes of the Seventh Nome of Upper Egypt under
the 6th Dynasty. Donkeys may be obtained through the Shékh el-beled.

The large tomb situated farthest to the left is that of the nomarch
Zauti. The ceiling was left rough-hewn. Some of the small inscriptions
cut in the living rock near the entrance are in Coptic. The representations
on the .inside of the entrance-wall have been almost wholly destroyed,
bat some ships may be distinguished to the right of the door. On the
right wall are figures bearing funeral gifts and a large tIaerlfieia1 table,
with a list of the gifts. In the rear-wall are two niches. That to the
