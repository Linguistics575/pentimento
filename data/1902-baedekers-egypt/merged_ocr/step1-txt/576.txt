with bud-capitals. The latter (11 of which still stand) were lower
than the former, but upon them rose a wall, with window-openings,
to the height of the others. Each of the side-aisles had six couples
of columns with bud-capitals; six columns to the left are still erect.
Part of the roof of the central aisle still remains. On the smooth
shafts of the columns appears Ramses II. sacrificing to the gods.

On the S. Half of' the E. Wall (P1. a) the storming of the Hittite fortress of Zapur is shown in the lower row. To the left is the Pharaoh dashIng 1n his chariot against the enemy, some of whom are slain, while the
rest, horse, foot, and chariots, hetake themselves to flight. To the right
is the fortress, defended by the Hittites, while the Egyptians are attacking it'on sealing-ladders, or push up to the walls under the protection of
storming-sheds and shields. The sons of the Pharaoh, the names of whom
are given, distinguish themselves in the battle. In the upper row are
several representations of the king sacrificing to the gods. - On the
W. Wall, in the lower row (P1. b, c), appear the sons of the Pharaoh, in
the upper row, above PI, b, is the king before Amman and Khons, with
the lion-headed Sekhmet Wert-hekew behind him, and above Pl. c, the
king followed by a goddess, in presence of Ammon and Nut.

The First Small Hypostyle Hall, with four couples of papyrusbud columns, has a well-preserved roof decorated with astronomical
representations and scenes of the king before the gods.

The BELIEFS on the walls are not uninteresting. On the E. Wall
(PI. d, e) are priests bearing the sacred boats of Ammon. Mutt and Khons,
each decorated with the head of its god. On the Ar. W. Wall (Pl. f) the
king is seated beneath the sacred tree of Heliopolis, on the leaves of
which his names are being written by Atum (seated on a throne to the
left), the goddess Sefkhet-ebui, and Thout (to the right).

Of the following Second Small Hypostyle Ball only the N. half,
with four columns, remains. The sacrificial representations here are
of little interest; at P1. 9 the king is shown burning incense to
Ptah and the lion-headed Sekhmet. - The other rooms, adjoining
this to the W. and at the sides, are completely ruined.

Behind the Ramesseum especially towards the N.W., are the remains
of a number of extensive Brick Buildings, some of which were erected in
the time of Ramses W, as we learn from the stamps on the bricks. Among
the rest are some well-constructed vaults, originally euvered by a platform. From the fragments of wine-jars and the stoppers found here we
may reasonably conclude that these were storerooms in connection with
the temple. Adjacent is an altar, resembling that of Der el-bahri (p. 232).

About 500 paces to the N. of the Ramesseum we observe the remains
of an extensive wall built of File bricks. The name of Thumasis 111.
found here on many tiles renders it probable that a temple built by this
king or dedicated to him stood on this site. Between the Ramesseum
and this temple of Thutmosis lay the Mortuary Temples of' Amtmophis 1 ].
(18th Dyn.) and .31: th (19th Dyno, the scanty remains of which_were
discovered by Flinders Petrie in 1896. - Farther to the ICE. the remains .of
the Mortuary Temple of Amenophis I. were discovered by Spiegelherg m
1896. - To the S. of the Ramesseum were similar temples of Prince Wan na:
(18th Dyn.), Thutmosis IV, Queen Tewosret (wife of Si-Ptah, p. .279, and
King Merenptah (p. 267), all of which were explored by Flinders Petrie m 1896.
