6. Ramesseum. THEBES (W.BANK). N. Route. 285

in the camp; now released from their burdens, they testify satisfaction by
means of movements and attitudes which the artist seems never tired D
drawing. The soldiers are conversing with each other, and one drinks
from a wine-skin. Disputes and quarrels are not wanting, and the campfollowers ply their staves actively on each other. Above, to the right,
the tranquillity of the camp is rudely disturbed by an attack of the Hittites. To the Right the king, seated upon his throne, takes counsel with
his princes who stand before him; close by is the royal chariot. Beneath
captured spies are being beaten, in order to extract information. - The
representation! on the S. Wing of the pylon are even more realistic. The
left half is occupied by the picture of the battle of Kadesh, which we
have already seen on the pylon at Luxor (p. 240). Ramses in his chariot
dashes against the foes, who are either slain by his arrows or flee in wild
confusion and fall into the Orontes. Behind the king are his war-chariots.
To the right, at a distance from the scene of action, is the Hittite prince.
Above is a second, now scarcely distinguishable, representation of the
Hittites fleeing to their fortress. The reliefs on the right half show the
usual presentment of the king, grasping enemies by the hair and smiting
them; farther to the right is the king holding a long "alf, and accompanied by fan-bearers.

On the interior walls of the Portal of this pylon are the usual reliefs
of Ramses sacrificing to various gods. At the top of the Jambs (P1. a, b)
Ramses appears pacing out the precincts of the temple (a rite performed
at the foundation of a temple); at the bottom, various deities.

The First Court is now utterly ruined, and scarcely a trace remains of the colonnades that bounded it on two sides. Fragments,
however, of the lofty wall on the W. side are still standing. In front
of the ancient W. gate lie the remains of the *Colossus of Ramses 11.,
the hugest statue in Egypt. The name offtamses IL appears in wellpreserved hieroglyphics on the upper arm and on the seat of the
statue. The face is unfortunately completely destroyed. The remains (breast, upper arm, one foot, etc.) still testify to the care
with which this gigantic monument was chiselled and polished.

The savants of the French Ex edition carefully measured the various
parts, as follows: length of ear 1/2 ft., surface of face from ear to ear
63/; ft., surface of breast from shOulder to shoulder 231/3 ft., from one
shoulder to the other in a straight line 211/: ft T circumference of the arm
at the elbow 171/2 ft., diameter of the arm between the elbow and shoulder
4% ft., length of the index linger 31/5 ft., length of the nail on the middle
finger 7% inches, breadth of ditto 6 inches, breadth of the foot across
the toes, 41/2 ft. The total height seems to have been 571/2 ft., and its
total weight over two million pounds.

The colossal head of another Statue of Ramses II. was found on the
S. side of the temple farther back, and was conveyed to the Nile by
Belzoni in 1816, and thence to Alexandria. It is now one of the chief
treasures in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum. Other fragments
have been brought to light more recently.

The Second Court is entered through a gap in the wall to the
right of the colossus. It is in much better preservation than the
first court, and is mentioned with its earyatides in Diodorus's description of the tomb of Osymandyas. On all four sides were colonnades, those to the right and left (N. and S.; almost wholly destroyed) having two rows of papyrus-bud columns and those on the
front CE.) and back (W.) square pillars with statues of Osiris and
papyrus-bud columns. The W. colonnade is raised on a kind of
terrace.
