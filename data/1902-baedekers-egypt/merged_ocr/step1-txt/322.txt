and coated with a yellow varnish. In most instances the arms were crossed
upon the breast, the hands of the men being clenched, those of the women

of the dead and their cases, found along with the coffins, date from the
Libyan period.

ROOM LXXXIV. ROYAL MUMMIES AND OBJECTS FOUND WITH THEM.

Towards the close of the New Empire the power of the Egyptian state
gradually declined, until finally not even the last resting-places of the
dead could be secured from robbers. Not only the necropolis at Drah
AbuTNegga (p. 262), but even the secluded tombs in the'Valley of Kings"
(p. 262) were plundered. The authorities recognized their impotence and
contented themselves with rescuing the mummies of the ancient Pharaohs.
The mummy of Ramses II. was therefore transferred from its tomb at
Biban el-Muh'ik (p. 267) to that of Sethos 1., and when that refuge ceased
to be deemed secure, both bodies were removed to the tomb of AmenoPhis 1.
Finally, under the 21st Dym, it was resolved to protect the royal mummies
from farther profanation by interring them all together in a rocky cleft
near Der el-batyf (p. 283), which was artificially widened for the purpose.
The COrpses of the ruling dynasty were also placed here. Thus at last
the remains of the great monarchs of the New Empire - Amosis I.,
Thutmosis m., Sethos L, and Ramses IL - were left in peace until in
1875 the fellahin once more discovered their secret resting-place and the
plundering of the mummies began again. The modern thieves succeeded
in keeping their secret to themselves for a considerable period, but in
1881 they were traced, and the mummies were deposited in the museum
at Cairo to save them from the hands of the robbers.
