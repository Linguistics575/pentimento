441/2 M. Rosetta IHtotel da Nil, kept by Christo) Arabic Reshtd
(a Coptic name), with 14,300 inhab, almost exclusively natives,
lies at the mouth of the Rosetta arm of the Nile (far' el-gharbi), the
ancient Bolbitinie arm (p. Iii). During the middle ages and in
more recent times its commercial prosperity was considerable, until
the construction of the Maltmtiltyeh Canal (pp. 11, 18) diverted its
trade to Alexandria. The streets contain many small but substantial
houses in a peculiar, half-European style, with projecting stories
and windows towards the outside The many gardens yield excellent fruit. Numerous columns from edifiees of the heathen
and Christian periods, some of them of granite and some of marble,
are seen lying in various open Spaces, particularly in one of eonsiderable size near the river, and a number of others are built into
the houses. The spacious Mosque of Sakhmn is also embellished
with many ancient columns. The hill of Abu 3fandor, to the S. of
the town, which commands a fine view, is supposed by some topographers to have been the site of the ancient Bolbitine, but it is
more likely that this lay to the N. of Rosetta. - The fortifications
to the N. of the town are not shown except by permission of the

commandant.

In 1799 M. Bouchard, a French captain of engineers, discovered in Fort
St. Julian the celebrated Rosetta Stone (p. civ), which ofFrded European
scholars a key to the language and writing of the ancient Egyptians, which
had been lost for nearly "centuries.
