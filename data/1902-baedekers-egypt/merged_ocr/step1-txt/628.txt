Ptolemaic Temple. ASSUZXN. 29. Route. 329

divided channel, appears small; but it still preserves its venerable
aspect, for everywhere, even on the rocks by the stream, are inscriptions and numerous memorials of the grand old times.

Among the ruins of the ancient city to the E. of the railwaystation lies a small and not very interesting PTOLEMAIC TEMPLE,
now buried 111 rubbish with the exception of the facade. The key
15 kept by an official uf the Administration des Antiquit√©s. Built
by Energetes I. and Philopator, but never quite completed, the
temple was dedicated to Isis of Syene.

la the centre of the facade is the MAIN PORTAL, crowned with a concave cornice; it IS now closed, the present entrance being by a gap in thc
wail to the left. Left Jamb: above, Eucrgetes presenting an image of Meat
to Ammon; below, Euergetes offering milk to a goddess. Right Jamb:
above, Euergetes before 31inummon, below, Euergetcs sacrificing to
Hathor. Lmtel: to the right, Euergetes sacritieing to Osiris, Isis, and
Harpocrates, and Euergetes before the crocodile-headed Sobk of Syene and
Hathor; to the left, Euergetes presenting an image of Meat to the cataractgods Khhum, Satis, and Anakis, and Euergetes and his wife Berenice
before IMS. - The INTERIOR consists of a hall with two pillars and three
chapels. The two sirle-chapels are f111ed up; the reliefs in the central
chapel show Euergetes (once accompanied by Berenice) before the various
deities of Syene.

Near the temple is a rock-inscription of the reign of Amenophis W.:
to the right is Men, "Superintendent of works', before the figure of Amenophis III.-, to the left is Men" s SOD Bek, chief architect at Tell e1-rA1uarua
(p. 203), before the fip1re (defaced) of Amenophis IV., upon which the
sun's rays descend.

To the S of the railway-station are the bases of several statues
of Roman emperors, with Latin votive inscriptions, perhaps on the
site of the old Praetorium. The new street on which these lie goes
on to the Cataract Hotel, passing the English Church, which was
built in 1800-.1900 by Mr. Somers Clarke in the style of a Coptie,
chapel, with a dome.

A ride (donkey there and back 5 pies.) may be taken to the CAMP
OF THE BISHARIN, situated within an ancient Arab cemetery, 3/4 Al.
to the E. of the town. These Arabs with their families live in
wretched tents covered with mats. Beduins of the'Abtbdeh tribe,
differing both in type and dress from the Bishtrriu, also have tents
here. Both tribes speak a curious language, allied to Egyptian and
other E. African dialects. They support themselves by cattle-rearing
and by trading, especially with senna-leaves, which they collect in
the desert and sell at good prices. The exhibitions and dances (jfantasia') which they perform are simply invented to entertain the
tourist and have nothing national or characteristic about them.
The handsome Bisharin children, with thick curly hair, hawk chains
and other small articles about the town. - A tine *iriew IS commanded by the Tomb of Shtkh Huron, above the camp, to the right.

We may return vit the ancient ARAB CEMETERIES, which are
situated in the desert to the S. of the town. Each grave "marked
by a rectangle of unhewn stones and a slab bearing an inscription.
The tombs of the richer dead are small domed erections.
