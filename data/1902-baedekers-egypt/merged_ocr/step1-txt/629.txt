330 Route 29. Assm'iN. Quarries.

On the summit of the hill to the right of the road are some large
musque-like Cenotaph: of famous saints, such as the Shekh Mirlrrntid, the.
ShEkh'Ali, the Lady (Seyidneh) Zenab, ete, whose memory is celebrated
by festivals on their birthdays, etc.

The Granite Quarries (Arabic Ma'ddt'nj, from which the ancient
Egyptian builders and sculptors drew their supplies (comp. p. 328),
are situated in the hills to the S, and may be reached in 1/4 hr.
either direct from the Bishirin camp or from the town by a route
leading via the Arab cemeteries (p. 329) and then to the E., passing
a grove of tamarisks. Numerous blocks of granite lie where they
were left when the works were given up; 6.9. the huge block (marked
-obelisk' on the Plan) in the N. Quarry, measuring 92 ft. in length
and 101/2 ft. in breadth at the broadest part. A moderately lofty
cliff shows manifold traces of the industry of the ancient stonecutters. The blocks were detached from the cliffs by boring numerous holes along a prescribed line, driving wedges into these, and
then wetting the wedges. By this process tolerably smooth and
even fractures were obtained. Frequently the blocks were finished
on three sides before being finally detached. Statues, sareophagi,
obelisks, ete., were also roughly worked over by the stone-cutters
in the quarries in order to lessen the weight for transport. The hill
above the N. quarry commands a wide prospect, including the convent of St. Simeon (p. 334) in a desert-valley, to the W., beyond
the Nile.

The S. Quarry, 1/2 hr. farther to the s., contains still more
rough-hewn sculptures, ready for removal. The quarry opens to
the E,, facing the desert. On a rock here may be seen an inscription with the name of Amenophis 111., though the name and ftg11re
of the stone-cutter who carved it have been obliterated. Beside it
two trough-shaped sarcophagi have been begun (in the Ptolemaic
or in the Roman period); and in the vicinity are the 11nfir1ished
colossus of a king (covered, except the feet, with sand), and alarge
quadrangular block, perhaps intended for the shrine of a god. Farther on, near the railway, and towards the top of the cliff, is a figure
of Osiris (called Ramses by the natives), about 20 ft. in height.
This point commands a fine view of the desert and in the direction
of Phila.

A massive Embanked Road, by which the huge blocks were
conveyed to the Nile, runs from the quarries to Assuirn and is used
to this day.' If we follow the railway-line we reach the railwaystation of She1ltl (p. 335) in 1/4 hr.

The verdant island of Elephantine, with its luxuriant palmtrees, attracts all travellers. The Arabs call it merely Gezireh, i.e.
'island', or Geziret Assutn. It is reached by small boat Crigiikeh)
in a few min. from the landing-place, and the entire visit takes
barely an hour. There are two villages on Elephantine, whose inhabitants speak Nubian.
