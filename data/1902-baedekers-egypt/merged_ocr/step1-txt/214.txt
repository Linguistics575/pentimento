Alexandria, called Iskanderieh by the Arabs and Turks, the second town of Egypt, and one of the most important commercial cities
on the Mediterranean, is situated at the W. extremity of the Niledelta, on the narrow sandy strip separating Lake Mareotis from the
sea, in E. long. 29°58'30", and N. lat. 3lotfy5". It contains
(1897) a population of 320,000, of whom about 46,000 are Europeans
(Franks), chiefly Greeks and Italians, but including also some
French and Austrians, and a few British, Germans, ete. The Mohammedans live almost exclusively in the N. and W. quarters of the
city, the Europeans in the E. quarter, and at Ramleh (p. 19).

Alexandria has two HARBOURS. The Port Est, or E. harbour,
known in antiquity as the'Great Harbour' and then sheltered by a
massive mole, is now accessible only for fishing-boats. The Port
Guest, or W. harbour (originally named Eunostos after the son-inlaw of Ptolemy 1.), was not freely used until the time of the later
Roman emperors. Under the Arabs it was the chiet'haven, and afterwards came to be called (erroneously) the'Old Harbour'. Since
1871 it has been enlarged by the addition of an Outer Harbour,
about 1800 acres in area. This is protected by a breakwater nearly
2 M. in length, constructed of solid masses of masonry. The broad
horizontal surface is 10 ft. above the level of the water at low tide.
A second pier, or Mole, nearly 1000 yds. in length, protects the
Inner Harbour, which is about 475 acres in area and on an average
27 ft. deep. From the beginning of this pier a series of new quays
extends along the whole E. side of the harbour to the Arsenal o. 14).
The port is entered and cleared annually by upwards of 2000
steamers, more than half of which are under the British flag. The
Muhmadfyeh Canal o. It), which connects Alexandria with the Nile,
enters the inner harbour by several locks (P1. 0, 6). The chief
exports are cotton, grain, ootton-seed, beans, rice, sugar, onions, etc.

1. HISTORY AND TOPOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT ALEXANDRIA.

Alexandria was founded in 13.0. 332 by Alexander the Great,
and forms a magnifieent and lasting memorial of his Egyptian campaign. He conceived the plan of founding a new and splendid seaport town in Egypt, both to facilitate the flow of Egypt's wealth
towards Greece and the Archipelago, and to connect the venerable
