to Edfu. EL-KAB. 26. Route. MI

M M. El-Kib, on the E. bank, the ancient Nekhab, once ranked
among the chief cities of Egypt. Even under the Ptolemies it was
the capital of the third home of Upper Egypt, which was afterwards
named Lat0polites. Its princes for a time were also governors of
Ethiopia. Nekhbet, the goddess of the town, was represented either
as a vulture or a woman with the crown of Upper Egypt; she was
regarded as a protecting deity of Upper Egypt. She also assisted
women in childbirth, and was therefore identified with Eileithyia
by the Greeks, who named the town Eileitlipiaspolis. Half-a-day
s11ffiees for a visit to the chief antiquities.

The *RUINs OF THE ANCIENT TOWN OF NEKHAB, which are surrounded by a massive girdle-wall of san-dried bricks, lie near the
river. The wall, which probably dates from the Middle Empire, is
damaged only on the S.W., by the Nile. It is of immense thickness
(37 ft.) and encloses a rectangle, 620 yds. long by 590 yds. broad,
with gates on the E., N., and S. sides, beside which broad ascents
lead to the top of the wall. The N, wall intersects a necropolis of
the Ancient Empire, excavated by Quibell in 1897. The city itself,
enclosed by another double wall, of which distinct traces are still
to be seen, occupied only about one-fourth of the space within the
girdle-wall. Very scanty ruins now remain of the temple, built
during the 18th Dyn. on the site of an earlier sanctuary and enlarged by Nektanebos and others.

Visitcrs should not omit to ascend to the top of the N. wall, for the
sake of the admirable view: to the E., at the head of a desert valley,
appear the isolated rock with the inscription, the temple of Amenophis yt.,
and a little nearer, the chapel of Ramses II. (comp. below); to the N. is
the hill with the rock-tombs, and a little farther away is a mushroom. Â»
shaped melt, with the quarries that yielded the stone for the city temple.

We follow the route leading due E. from the E. gateway in the
girdle-wall, and cross the dazzlingly white sand, past a small ruined
Sandstone Temple (no inscriptions) close to the wall. In rather more
than 1/2 hr. we reach a Chapel of Ramses 11., known to the Arabs as
el-l.rarntnitm, i.e.'the bath'.

This temple was built in the reign of Ramses H, by Sethw, governor
of Ethiopia represented in the entrance-doorway and on the 1nter10r_walls
on each side of the entrance. Other reliefs show Ramses II. sacrificing
to Thout, Horus, and other deities. 0n the upper part of the rear-wall
(right) are apes, sacred to Thout; below are praying men.

We keep straight on, leaving the larger temple of the Ptolemies
on the left, and soon reach two Rocks projecting from the plain, at
the point where the road turns N. towards the desert.i halfway between el-esrnrmim and the E. temple of Amenophis III. Both
rocks bear numerous inscriptions and figures of animals. Most of
these date from the 6th Dyn. and were placed here by worshippers
in an adjoining temple..

The charming small temple or *OHAPEL or AMENOPHIS III. lies
fully 1/4 hr. to the E. It may be reached direct ie about an hour
from the Nile Tho little temple, which is about 50 ft. deep, was
