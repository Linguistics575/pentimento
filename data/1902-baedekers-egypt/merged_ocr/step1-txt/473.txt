214 Route 19. BUTiG. From Assm;

the tomb of the Nomarch Mesehti, on the hill above the Soldiers' Tomb;
here were found the soldiers now in the Museum at Gizeh (p. 79).

The geological formation of this hill of tombs is very interesting,
especially on account of the numerous specimens of Callianasse nilotica
and other fossils found on its upper part.

About a N. to the S.W. of Assiat, on the slope of the Libyan Mts.,
is the Coptic convent of Der Rifeh, near which are several tombs of the
Middle and New Empires. These belong to princes and grandees of the
neighbouring town of 8has-hotep (Shatb, see below), bat beyond some important inscriptions contain nothing of interest. About 2 M. to the N. of
Dh. ltifeh is Dr'r Drmkeh, with quarries and Coptic burial inscriptions.

19. From Assit1t to Girgeh and Relianeh (Abydos)
by the Nile.

Comp. Map, p. 200.

99 M. The tourist-steamers lay up for the night at Sohag and in ascending the river pass Ber1iineh without stopping.

The voyage from Asshlt to Akhmim leads through an extremely
fertile and well-cultivated district. Well-tilled fields, broader on the
W. than 011 the E., adjoin both banks of the river, and are shaded
by tine palms and Nile acacias, especially near the riverside villages.
Here, as in most of Egypt, large quantities of pigeons are kept by
the peasants, chiefly for the sake of their droppings, which form the
only manure used in the fields, the dung of the cattle being dried
and used as fuel. Large pigeon-houses, not unlike pylons, are
visible in all the villages, and huge floeks of pigeons are seen
wheeling in the air or settling like a dark cloud on the tields. Most
of these pigeons are of the common grey species, and attain a considerable size, but many pretty little reddish-grey turtle-doves are
also seen. The pigeons really consume more than they produce, so
that their encouragement by the fellahiu is rightly regarded as a
serious mistake in their husbandry.

El- Waste lies nearly opposite Assiilt.. In the Gebel Rekhdm, to
the E. of the villages of Natf'eh and Ghomyeb, is an alabaster quarry.

51/2 M. Shaghbeh (Chayhaha), on the W. bank. Shag (Ohotb),
which lies 3 M. inland near the railway, is perhaps the Egyptian
Shas-hotep, the Greek Hypselis, capital of the Hypselite Home. The
chief deity here was the ram-headed Khnum (necropolis, see above).

15 M. Butig or Abutig (rail. stat., p. 191), an agricultural town
on the W. bank with 11,000 inhab. and a small harbour filled with
Nile-boats, lies in the ancient Hypselite nome. The present name
is probably derived from the Greek name of'Amnfrzn (Apotheke),
i.e. Storehouse.

Near the E. bank is Eadari (7850 inhab), an the W. bank follow
the steamboat and railway stations (21 MO Sedfa. and (271/2 M.)
lem.

I 152m- Badari, 21/2 M. from the Nile, are several rude roek-tombs without inscriptions. Farther to the 5., near Rdhineh, are four large quarries
in the hard limestone rock. Near Hamamiyeh, in the steep side of the rocky

hill, are three rock tombs, one above another, containing inscriptions and
representations, belonging to the royal officials Afa and Kakcs.
