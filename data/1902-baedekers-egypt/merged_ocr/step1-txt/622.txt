The GREAT HYPOSTYLE HALL (Pronaos) contains 10 columns with
rich floral and palm-eapitals, on which the roof rested. On the shafts
appears Neos Dionysos sacrificing to the gods. The ceiling of the
two main aisles is embellished with flying vultures 5 while the under
side of the arehitrave supporting this ceiling bears astronomical
designs (star-gods in their boats, etc.) We may observe the lines
dividing the surface into squares to guide the artist in drawing the
figures, and also some older sketches that were not carried to completion. The mural reliefs here are especially beautiful, the finest
being that to the right of the N. portal (on sereen-wall h). We here
see the king (Neos Dionysos), in presence of Haroéris (to the right),
being blessed by a lion-headed Isis and the hawk-headed Harsiésis,
on the right, and by the goddess Newt and the ibis-headed Thout,
on the left.

The remaining mural reliefs may be inspected by those who are not pressed for time. On Screen Wall i: the guardian-goddesses of Upper and Lower
Egypt blessing the king (Neos Dionysos), to the left stand the crocodileheaded Sobk and his companion Hathor. - To the left, above the small
Door k: Neos Dionysus saerrficing to four fabulous mOnsters (including a
winged lion with four heads); the animals have been scratched out. - Opposite, on Wall I, are three rows. Bottom Row: to the right are Euergetes 11.
and Cleopatra (upper parts wanting) in presence of Sobk and his fellowgods Hathor and P-neb-tene; in the middle, the king before the hawkheaded Haroéris and the'good sister", to the left Euergetes presents the
temple of Ombos to Sobk and Halhor. Middle Row: to the right the king
twinning) tyaerifiees to Usiris enthroned, Isis (before whom is her youthful
son), and Nephlhys; in the middle Euergetes presents tlowers to the earthgod Ueb and the sky-goddess Newt; to the left Euergetes offers two jars
of wine to Show and the lion-headed Tefnut. Top Row: to the right, the
king (wanting) before Haroéris, the'good sister', and P-neb-tewe; in the
middle he offers an ornament to Sobk and Khons-Hor; to the left Euergetes
offers milk to Sobk and Hathor. - On Wall m, to the left of the left
entrance to the next room, are three rows of similar scenes.

The SMALL HYPOSTYLE HALL is entered by two doors. Its ceiling, which was lower than that of the great hall, was supported by
10 columns with floral capitals. On each shaft Euergetes II. is
shown saorifieing to a god; the mural reliefs also show him in communion with the gods. The relief on the left (N.) wall should be
noticed: the hawk-headed Haroéris presents the curved sword to
Euergetes II., behind whom are his sister Cleopatra and his wife of
the same name. The sacred crocodile of Ombos is represented at
P1. n, between the doors leading from the great hall.

Between the doors leading hence to the inner rooms of the temple are
reliefs showing Philometor, elder brother of Euergetes 11., saecifieiag to
the hawk-headed Haroéris.

The following three smaller VESTIBULES, each of which lies a
little higher than the preceding, are also embellished with fine
reliefs. Adjoining are a number of side-chambers, which may have
been used as storerooms; those to the left (N.) have almost eompletely disappeared. On the rear-wall of Vestibule 111, between
the doors, is a fine relief: Philometor, clad in a white mantle and
accompanied by Cleopatra, stands before the hawk-headed moon
