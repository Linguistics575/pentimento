Dahabiyehs. - Now that the visit to Upper Egypt is so much
facilitated by the railway and the regular services "tourist-steamers, only those travellers to whom economy of time and money is
no object make the voyage in privately hireddahabiyehs or launches.
In Cairo the best dahabiyehs, comfortably and even luxuriously
fitted up, are those belonging to Messrs. Cook' Son (d ssteam-dahabiyehs, G sailing dahabiyehs) and the Anglo-American Co. (3 large
and 2 small steam-dahabiyehs, several sailing dahabiyehs). The
inclusive charge, e.g., for Cook's excellent steam-dahabiyeh'Nitoeris', is 4006. per month for 4 pets, 5501. for 6, or 6755. for 8. These
prices include not only the hire of the dahabiyeh and its full
equipment and the wages of the re'is or captain and the crew, but
also the services of a dragoman and attendants, and provisions fexeept liquoro), donkeys, saddles, and all the incidental expenses of
excursions (excluding bakshish). The charge for sailing dahabiyehs is, of course, less. In the case of head-winds small steam-ttw
may be hired for 6-8t. per day.

The traveller may also hire a dahabiyeh directly, i.e. independently of the agents, and take the commissariat into his own
hands; but this is not recommended to inexperienced travellers. A
