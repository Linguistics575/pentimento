of the Koran. The procession usually enters the city by the Bdb en- -Nas.r
(p. 62).' In 1'/2-2 hrs. it reaches the Rumeleh (p. 51), the large open
space in front of the citadel, from which last twelve cannon- shots are
fired as a salute. The cortege then sweeps round the Ruméleh, and finally enters the citadel by the Bab el- Wezir (P1. E, 2). The departure of
the pilgrims (p. lxxvii) is attended with similar ceremonies.

The great festival of the 316rnn EN-N1imr, the birthday of the prophet,
is celebrated at the beginning of Itabit el-tttmotel, the third month. The
preparations for it begin on the second day of the month, and the most
important ceremOnies take place on the evening of the eleventh. The
city, and particularly the scene of the festival, is then illuminated by
means of lamps hung on wooden stands made for the purpose. Processions of dervishes (p. Ixx) parade the streets with flags by day, and with
lamps hoisted on poles by night. On this evening the sellers of sweetmeats frequently exclaim -'A grain of salt for the eye of him who will
not bless the Prophet!' The Odseh, or ceremony of riding over the dervishes, also took place on the eleventh of this month. SOme fifty dervishes or more lay close together on the ground, and allowed the shékh
of the Sa'diyeh dervishes on horseback to ride over them.Accide11ts
rarely happened, although the horse trod on every one of the prostrate
figures. During this ceremony the spectators shouted incessantly,'Alhihhi- hi. léh- ltihl' This barbarous custom was forbidden by the Khedive
Tewfik, and the ceremOnies are confined to the procession of the shekh and
the reading of the Koran in the Khedive s tent. At night a great zikr
is performed by the dervishes (p.1xxiJ10n this festival, as on all the
other molids", the jugglers, buffoons, and other ministers of amusement,
ply their calling with great success (comp. p, xxiv).

1n the fourth month, that of Rabi el- Akhiy (et- MM) occurs the peeu1iarly solemn festival of the birthday or mm: of Host?" the prophet's
grandson, the principal scene of which is the mosque of Hosen, where
the head of Hosen is said to be interred. This festival lasts fifteen days
and fourteen nights, the most important day being always a Tuesday (yam
et-tetdta). On this occasion the'flurdniyeh Derm'shes (p. Ixx) sometimes
go through their hideous performance of chewing and swallowing burning
charcoal and broken glass, and their wild dances. On the chief days, and
on their eves, great crowds congregate in and around the mosque On
these occasions the Keran is read aloud to the people, the streets adjoining
the mosque are illuminated the shops are kept open, and story- tellers,
jugglers, and others of the same class attract numerous patrons

In the middle of Regeb, the seventh month, is the Af6lid 0f Seyidch
Jh" mab Cour Lady Zenab J, the granddaughter of the prophet The festival, which lasts fourteen days, the most important being a Tuesday, is
celebrated at the mosque of the Seiyideh Zenab (p. 56) where she is said
to be buried. - On the 27th of this month is the Létet el- Jfi'e ag or night
of the ascension of the prophet, the celebration of which takes place
outside the Bib el-rAdawi, in the N. suburb of Cairo.

On the first, or sometimes on the second Wednesday of Sim bill, the
eighth month, the MMid of Imam 8tuiteti, is commemorated the centre of
attraction being the burial- place of El- Karafeh (p. 68). This festival is
numerously attended as most of the Cairenes belong to the sect of Imam
Shife'i (p.1xx). The ceremonies are the same as at other mulids1

The month of Ramadan (p.1xix), the ninth, is the month of fasting,
which begins as soon as a Muslim declares that he has seen the new
moon. The fast is strictly observed during the day, but the faithful indemnify themselves by eating, drinking, and smoking throughout the
greater part of the night. At dusk the streets begin to be thronged, the
story-tellers at the cares attract large audiences, and many devotees ar
semble at the mosques. The eve of the 27th of the month is considered
peculiarly holy. It is called the Ltlet el- Kadr, or'night of honour', owing
to the tradition that the Koran was sent down to Mohammed On this
night. During this sacred night the angels descend to mortals with blessings and the portals of heaven stand open, affording certain admission to
the prayers of the devout.
