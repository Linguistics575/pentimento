in the second or third year of his reign, how could their sons or
successors, however willing to carry out the plan, have succeeded in
completing so gigantic a task, and in erecting monuments for themselves at the same time? (3) And how comes it that many other
kings did not, like Kheops, boldly anticipate a reign of thirty years
and begin a work of the same kind, the design for which might so
easily have been drawn, and might so readily have been carried
out by his subjects? - To these questions Lepsius, Erbkam, and
Ebers answer.'Each king', says Lepsius in his letters from Egypt,
'began to build his pyramid when he ascended the throne. He began
it on a small scale, in order that, if a short reign should be in store
for him, his tomb might be a complete one. As years rolled on,
however, he continued enlarging it by the addition of outer coatings
of stone, until he felt that his career was drawing to a close. If
he died before the work was completed, the last coating was then
finished, and the size of the monument was accordingly proportioned
to the length of the builder's reign; so that, had the progress of
these structures always been uniform, it would have almost been
possible to ascertain the length of each king's reign from the inorustations of his pyramid, in the same way as the age of a tree is
determined by the number of the concentric rings in its trunk'. This'layer-theory' of the construction of the Pyramids has been
opposed by Flinders Petrie, who has sought to show that the initial
plan of each pyramid practically contemplated the full extent
reached by the completed work. But more recently Borehardt has
demonstrated conclusively that Lepsius's theory of the gradual
growth of each pyramid is essentially correct and requires moditieation in a few details only. According to Borchardt, each pyramid
builder began by planning a monument of moderate size. In many
instances this original small conception was permanently adhered
to; but it not unfrequently happened that kings who enjoyed long
reigns or found themselves in control of more extensive powers,
expanded their original designs and enlarged their buildings either
by mere additions without altering the passages or chambers (as
in the step-pyramid at Salilsira) or by revising the whole original
design, including the chambers, etc.7 on a new and more extensive
scale (as in the third pyramid of Gizeh). 0eeasionally a second
enlargement took place, as in the case of the Great Pyramid.

The Pyramids were opened by saerilegious robbers at a very early
period, probably under tbe20th Dyn., or even earlier. Attempts were
made to force an entrance into the inner chambers, and passages
were laboriously cut through the solid masonry in order to reach
the expected treasures. In the course of this mining and tunnelling
the passages and chambers sustained much damage. Somewhere
about the period of the 25th or 26th Dyn. these injuries were
repaired and the pyramids once more restored. But they seem to
have been again invaded by the Persians; and also at later periods,
