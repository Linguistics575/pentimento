MOHAMMEDAN CUSTOMS. lxxiii

Remarks on Mohammedan Customs.

The birth of a child is celebrated on the seventh day of its life
by a domestic festival, attended by the h√©di or some learned theologian, who dissolves in his mouth a piece of sugar-candy presented
to him by the host and drops a little of his sweetened saliva into
the infant's mouth, as if to give it a sweet foretaste of the world's
gifts, and also for the purpose of'giving it a name out of his mouth'.
Muslims, it is well known, are usually named by their praenomens
only. If a more precise designation is desired, the name of the
father is placed after the praenomen, with or without the word ibn
('sonof) placed between the names. Nicknames, such as'the oneeyed', eta, are also not uncommon.

When the child is forty days old the mother takes it to the bath,
and causes forty bowls of water (thirty-niue if a girl) to be poured
over it. This bath forms the purification of both mother and child.

The rite of circumcision is performed on boys up to the age of
six or seven, or even later, the ceremony being attended with great
pomp. The child is previously conducted through the streets in holiday
attire, the procession being frequently united with some bridal party,
in order to diminish the expense of the proceedings. The boy generally wears a turban of red cashmere, girls' clothes of the richest
possible description, and conspicuous female ornaments, which are
designed to attract attention, and thus avert the evil eye from his
person. He half covers his face with an embroidered handkerchief;
and the barber who performs the operation and a noisy troop of
musicians head the procession. The first personage in the procession
is usually the barber's boy, carrying the'lieml', or barber's sign, a
kind of cupboard made of wood, in the form of a haltueyliader, with
four short legs. The flat front of the hem ] is adorned with pieces
of looking-glass and embossed brass, while the back is covered with
a curtain. Two or more boys are often thus paraded together, being
usually driven in a carriage and attended by music.

Girls are generally married in their 12th or 13th, and sometimes as early as their 10th year. A man in search of a bride
employs the services of a relative, or of a professional female
match-maker, and he never has an opportunity of seeing his bride
until the wedding-day, except when the parties belong to the
lowest classes. When everything is arranged, the affianeed bridegroom has to pay a bridal-portion (main) amounting to about 25 L,
more being paid when the bride is a spinster than if she is a widow.
Generally speaking, about two-thirds of the sum, the amount
of which always forms a subject of lively discussion, is paid
down, while one-third is settled upon the wife, being payable on
the death of the husband, or on his divorcing her against her will.
The marriage-eontraet is now complete. Before the wedding the
bride is conducted in gala attire and with great ceremony to the
bath. This procession is called'Zef'et et Ilammiim'. It is headed
