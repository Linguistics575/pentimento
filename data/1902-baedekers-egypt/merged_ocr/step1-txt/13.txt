vi PREFACE.

The materials for the first edition of the volume on Lower
We, were mainly furnished in 1877 by Professor G. Ebers
of Leipsic. Among the contributions prepared for the
English version were those of the distinguished Egyptologist, Dr, Samuel Birch. The volume on Upper Egypt, originall published in 1891, was founded on material contributed
by Izafessor Ebers and Professor I Ihtmichen of Strassburg.
The present combined edition, like the preceding, has been
completely revised by Professor Gewg 8teindorir of Leipsie,
who devoted a journey to Egypt in 1900 mainly to this object.
The introductory articles bearing their names have also been
specially revised by Frans-Pasha and Dr. Georg 8ehtoeGtdUrth
of Cairo. For other important contributions the Editor is
obliged to Dr. Borchardt of Cairo, to Dr. Leigh Gamay of
Assuan, to Mr. Percy ENewberry of London, to Dr. H. Schafer
of Berlin, to Dr. ll. T hieraeh of Munich, to Prof. Moritz of
Cairo, and to Dr. I David of Khartiim.

The MAPS and PLANS have been the object of the Editor's
special care, and all have been carefully revised by Prof.
Steindorff, with the aid of the most recent publications and
of much valuable unpublished material, kindly placed at his
disposal by Prof. Loret of Lyons, M. G. Legrain of Cairo,
and others. To the present edition have been added entirely new maps of the Fayiim, of the Nile from Cairo to Asstian
(3 sheets; 1:500,000), and of the environs of Assfusn; new
plans of Part Sa'id, Luxor, ete.; and many new ground-plans.
The spelling of the names on the new maps follows the official French system of transliteration adopted in the tReeensement général de I'Egypte du 1 juin 1897', published in 1898.
In all the maps and plans the North is at the top of the page,
except where there is an express indication to the contrary.

Ancient Egyptian names are transliterated on the system
indicated at p. evi. Arabic names have been specially revised
by Professor Socin of Leipsic.

HOTELS, ete., see p. xviii. Hotels which cannot be accurately characterized without exposing the Editor to the risk
of legal proceedings are left unmentioned.

To hotel-proprietors, tradesmen, and others the Editor
begs to intimate that a character for fair dealing and courtesy towards travellers forms the sole passport to his commendation, and that advertisements of every kind are strictly
excluded from his Handbooks. Hotel-keepers are also warned
against persons representing themselves as agents for Bsur.
deker's Handbooks.
