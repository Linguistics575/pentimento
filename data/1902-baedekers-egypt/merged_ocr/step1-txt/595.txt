hue), who are conducted to him in four rows by his sons and other
notabilities. The hands, etc., cut off from the slain are being counted.
The greater part of this wall is occupied by a 75-line inscription,
recording the conquests of the king.

The Rear Wall of the Terrace at the W. side of this second court
has three rows of representations. 1n the two upper rows, Ramses 111. is shown worshipping various deities. In the lowest row
(as in the Ramesseum, p. 286) are royal princes and princesses.
The names beside many of these were added under Ramses TI.

The following chambers are all very dilapidated, and only the
lower parts of the walls and columns remain.

We first enter the Great Hypostyle Hall. The roof was formerly
supported by 24 columns in 4 rows of six, of which the central row
was considerably thicker than the others. On the walls are representations of the king in presence of various deities. An interesting
relief on the S. wall shows the magnificent gold vases presented by
Ramses III. to Ammon, Mut, and Khons.

Three dlrnallerChambem (Pl. G, H, J) follow, two with four couples
of columns, and one with four pillars. In Room H are two groups
of red granite, one (left) representing Ammon and Meat, the other
(right) the king and the ibis-headed Thout. - The other rooms at
the back were dedicated to different deities. From Room G a staircase ascended to those on the upper floor.

The great hypostyle hall is adjoiued also at the sides (N. and S.)
by two series of rooms (Pl. 1-11), of which those to the left formed
the Treasury of the temple.

The Representations on the walls of these treasure-chamhers refer to
the costly objects stored within them. Room J (which was also accessible from the W. terrace of the second court): The king presents Ammon
with papyrus-holders in the form oflions with the king's head or kneeling
figures of the king. Room P: The king presents to Amman costly vessels,
with lids in the shape of the heads of rams, hawks, or kings, and tableequipages shaped like recumbent rams or sphinxes. Room 3.- The king
presents Ammon with sacks of precious stones. Room 4: The king offers
costly table-serviees, ornaments,' golden harps, silver, lead, etc. Room g:

We see the king sacrificing to various deities. In Room 7 the princes and
princesses present gifts to the king and queen. In Room 10 stands a colossal alabaster statue of Ptah (headless).

We now quit the temple and proceed to examine the interesting
Historical Reliefs on the outside of the temple-walls, which commemorate the wars of Ramses 111.

On the W. WALL are scenes from a war with a negro race.
