To Karnak 1 fr. or Is., and as much more when the traveller is called for or
keeps the ass for the day. On the W. side the donkeys, which are much
more heavily worked, are not so good, but they are fairly well saddled.
Charge? fr. per day. The hotels on the E. bank provide donkeys; on
the W. bank they must be ordered beforehand.

Antiquities. The traveller in Thebes is frequently tempted to purchase
antiquities. Half the population of Luxor is engaged in traffie with antiquities, and the practice of fabricating scarabaei and other articles
frequently found in tombs is by no means unknown to the other half.
Many of the articles offered for sale are so skilfully imitated that even
experts are sometimes in doubt as to their genuineness; the ordinary
traveller seldom or never secures an authentic specimen. Travellers are
specially warned against purchasing papyri without expert advice. Purchases
should not be made in presence of the dragomans, as these individuals,
by tacit agreement, receive a percentage from the dealers, which is, of
course, added to the price. Only as many piastres as they ask shillings
should ever be offered to the importunate hawkers of antiquities at the
temples and tombs. Those who desire a genuine memorial of antiquity
should apply to the director of the hotel or to the British or German
consular agents (the latter of whom has a collection of antiquities well
worth seeing). Prices vary greatly; 10-20s, or even more, must be paid
for a good scarabaeus with fine polish. Good and reliable specimens may
be obtained from Mohammed Muhasseb and'Abd eF3fegid.

Photographs. Good photographs are produced by A. Beale in Luzon
but even in 8hepheard's and other hotels in Cairo, excellent photographs
of Egyptian temples are sold at moderate prices. Those by Sébah are
excellent.

Distribution of Time. Travellers by the tourist-steamers are more or
less committed to the prescribed programme (comp. p. 186). Those who
are at liberty to arrange their time for themselves will find the following
programmes convenient.

THREE DAYS' VISIT. lst day. Luxor and Kernel: (E. bank). Though
visitors are sometimes advised to reserve this, the most gigantic of the
monuments, to the last, it is really desirable to visit Karnak first of all,
before fatigue has begun. The traveller who visits Karnak on the first
day proceeds then to view the other lions, with the satisfactory feeling
that Thebes has fulfilled his highest expectations; and he will not fail to
take a later opportunity to return to refresh and eonflrrn his first im.
pression. A visit by moonlight is exceedingly attractive, but travellers
are advised not to make it alone, even although there is nothing to fear
from robbers. - Visitors should ride early to Karnak, while the temple
of Luxor, easily reached in a few minutes from the steamer or hotel,
may be reserved for an afternoon-visit.

2nd day. Cross the river early, visit the Colossi of Memnon, Medinet
Habu, Der e1-Neiltneh, the Ramesseum, and finally some of the Tombs
