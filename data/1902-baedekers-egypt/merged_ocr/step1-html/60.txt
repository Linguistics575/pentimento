own respective countries. It has been asserted that <span style="color: #0000FF;">European<br/>
</span>families settled in Egypt die out in the second or third generation,<br/>
but of this there is no <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>proof, as the European community<br/>
is of very recent origin, and many examples to the contrary might<br/>
be cited. Moreover as the Europeans in Egypt dwell exclusively in<br/>
the large cities, they do not afford very conclusive evidence on the<br/>
general question; for city life, as opposed to country life, is even<br/>
less propitious to human health and vigour in warm countries than<br/>
it is in northern climes. Thus the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes </span>have left no <span style="color: #ff0000;">deseendants </span>in Egypt. The climate of Egypt (comp. p. Ixi) is less enervating than that of most other hot countries, an advantage attributed to the dryness of the air.<br/>

c. The Nile.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile ranks with the Amazon and the Congo as one of the<br/>
three longest rivers in the world <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>about 4000 miles), since its headstream was proved by Dr. 0. Baumann in 1892 to be the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kagem</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'which </span>rises three degrees to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>of the Equator. Throughout<br/>
nearly the whole of its course the river is navigable, with two great<br/>
interruptions only (between Abu Hammed and Barkal and between<br/>
Dongola and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span>Halfa).<br/>
<br/>
The Nile is formed by the confluence of the White and the Blue<br/>
Nile at the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartt1m</span>, from which point to its principal<br/>
mouths at Damietta and Rosetta, a distance of 1350 miles, it<br/>
traverses an absolutely barren country, and receives one tributary<br/>
only, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Athara</span>, on the east side, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">140 </span>miles below <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttum </span>Notwithstanding the immense length of the river, it very rarely<br/>
presents the picturesque appearance of some of the great European<br/>
and other rivers, as its banks are generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>and monotonous,<br/>
and it contains hardly a single island worthy of mention. The broadest parts of this portion of the Nile are a little below <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttom</span>, a<br/>
little above its bifurcation <span style="color: #ff0000;">nearCairo</span>, and also near Minyeh, at each<br/>
of which places it attains a width of about 1100 yds., while the<br/>
White Nile is of greater breadth throughout a long part of its lower<br/>
course. As the river pursues its tortuous course <span style="color: #0000FF;">through </span>thirsty<br/>
land, for a distance of 15 degrees of latitude, much of its water is<br/>
consumed by evaporation and infiltration (a process by which it is<br/>
probable that the Libyan oases are supplied with water from the<br/>
Nubian Nile), and still more by the extensive system of <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial<br/>
</span>canals requisite for the irrigation of a whole kingdom. At the <span style="color: #0000FF;">confluence </span>of the White and Blue Nile their average volumes are in the<br/>
proportion of three to one, but the latter assumes far greater <span style="color: #0000FF;">importance </span>when swollen by the Abyssinian rains. The Blue Nile is<br/>
in fact a species of <span style="color: #0000FF;">mountain-torrent</span>, being liable to rise suddenly<br/>
and sweep away everything it encounters on its rapidly descending<br/>
course. It is therefore called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bohr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Asra.k</span>,. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ale</span>. the blue,<br/>
