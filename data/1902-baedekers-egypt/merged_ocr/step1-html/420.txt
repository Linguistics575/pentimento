</span>also near the British Cemetery, are gardens in which fruit and <span style="color: #0000FF;">vegetables </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flourish </span>luxuriantly. The large buildings to the N. of it are<br/>
the former English Naval Hospital and the engine house of the<br/>
Water Works. - To the E. of the canal is <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">camping-ground<br/>

As the N. extremity of the Gulf of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sun </span>ends in a shoal, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>is dry at low water, the entrance of the Suez Canal and the necessary harbour-works were constructed 2 M. to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s.</span>, at the beginning of the deep water. A stone Pier, 50 ft. wide, on which is<br/>
the railway mentioned at p. 172, connects the town with these<br/>
works, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">apleasant </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">promenade </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey </span>5-8 <span style="color: #0000FF;">piss</span>, according<br/>
to the time ], commanding beautiful views of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Atil.rs </span>Mts. on<br/>
the W. and the range of the Peninsula of Sinai on the E.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the pier is an <span style="color: #ff0000;">artifieial </span>Island, about <span style="color: #ff0000;">60 </span>acres in<br/>
area, constructed of the large quantities of earth dredged from the<br/>
canal. To the left, on this island, are the railway-station of TerrePlein, at Port <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewlik</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Small </span>Dock of the Canal 00. Farther<br/>
on is the Avenue <span style="color: #ff0000;">Héténe</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1000 </span>yds. in length, with a lighthouse at the extremity, beside <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is a statue erected by M. de<br/>
Lesseps to Lieutenant <span style="color: #0000FF;">Waghorn </span>(p. 166), an enterprising Englishman, who, after having spent the best years of his life in establishing regular communication between England and India <span style="color: #ff0000;">vizi </span>Egypt,<br/>
died <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">London </span>in poverty in 1850. The large basin farther to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>,<br/>
Port Ibrahim, is capable of containing 50 vessels of the largest<br/>
size and is divided by massive <span style="color: #0000FF;">bulwarks </span>into two parts, one for<br/>
vessels of war, and the other for trading vessels. The mouth of<br/>
the dock is protected by gates and a massive breakwater. The dry<br/>
dock is 135 yds. long, 24 yds. wide, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">23 </span>ft. in depth. - The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">situation'of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sand-banks </span>and of the navigable channel is of course<br/>
best seen at low tide.<br/>
<br/>
For a visit by Rowing Boat <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>172) to the docks and canal<br/>
entrance, calm <span style="color: #0000FF;">weather </span>is desirable. The beautiful clearness of the<br/>
green water, with its curious shells and seaweed, and the almost<br/>
invariable beauty of the sunsets render a <span style="color: #0000FF;">boating-excursion </span>here<br/>
unusually attractive.<br/>

weather is very desirable <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>excursion also, not only for Ihe <span style="color: #0000FF;">pass</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rge<br/>
</span>in the boat (by which the donkeys must also be <span style="color: #0000FF;">conveyed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>but also because the driving sand in the desert is very <span style="color: #0000FF;">disagreeable </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>a high wind.<br/>
About 2 hrs. should be allowed for the stay at the springs, including <span style="color: #0000FF;">time<br/>

entrance to the Suez Canal (comp. the map), to the Springs is<br/>
about 61/2 M. The whole of the route thence by land traverses the<br/>
