IV. Outline of the History of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>ANCIENT HISTORY.<br/>
By Prof. G. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bleindorf</span>.<br/>

<br/>
Exact systems of chronology were as little known to the ancient<br/>
Egyptians as to the other peoples of antiquity. The events they<br/>
desired to record were dated according to the years of the king<br/>
reigning at the time. In order to determine at what period a <span style="color: #0000FF;">particular </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span>had reigned, the priests drew up long lists of monarchs,<br/>
fragments of which have survived to the present day <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">222</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chronological </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ep'itumes</span>, moreover, which are all that has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">transmitted </span>to us of the'Egyptian History', written in Greek by the<br/>
priest <span style="color: #0000FF;">Manetho </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>, were founded on these native registers. Manetho<br/>
arranged all the rulers of Egypt, from Menes, the first king, to<br/>
Alexand er the Great, in 31 Dynasties, which correspond, generally<br/>
speaking, to the various royal houses that held sway in Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">successively </span>or Cat certain periods) contemporaneously. This arrangement has been generally adopted by writers <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the subject; but <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
</span>the same time, for the sake of <span style="color: #0000FF;">convenience</span>, several dynasties are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">grouped </span>together under the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">a'period</span>','empire', or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'monarchy</span>'. The lack of any settled chronology renders it, of course,<br/>
impossible to assign anything like exact dates for the kings before<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Psammetikh </span>I. The dates, <span style="color: #0000FF;">therefore</span>, in the following outline are<br/>
given as approximate merely, and in the earliest period may sometimes be even centuries out.<br/>
<br/>
l, The Prehistoric Period.<br/>
<br/>
The dark prehistoric period, which later traditions <span style="color: #0000FF;">till </span>up with<br/>
dynasties of gods and demigods, is illumined by a few scattered<br/>
rays of light only. It may be taken as certain that the country did<br/>
not originally form one single kingdom, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>divided into two<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">states </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>the'North Land', corresponding to the Delta, and the<br/>
'South', stretching from the neighbourhood of Memphis (Cairo) to<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Manetho </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebennytos </span>flourished in the reigns of Ptolemy I. <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
