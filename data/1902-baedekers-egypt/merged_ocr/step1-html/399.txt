Damietta, Arabic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Damlfit.</span>, situated between the Damietta<br/>
branch of the Nile and Lake Menzaleh, about 4 M. from the sea,<br/>
contains 43,750 <span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab</span>. (few Europeans). Seen from the railwaystation, situated near the harbour, Damietta presents an imposing<br/>
appearance, with its lofty houses <span style="color: #0000FF;">flanking </span>the river. The interior<br/>
of the town, however, by no means <span style="color: #0000FF;">fulfils </span>the traveller's expectations. On every side lie ruinous old buildings and walls. The<br/>
harbour is considerable, but its entrance is much silted up. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant </span>trade of the place is <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehietly </span>in the hands of native<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">merchants </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabs </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Levantines</span>). The industries to which the<br/>
town <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>indebted for its former prosperity (see below) still exist<br/>
to some extent, and the traveller will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>it interesting to <span style="color: #0000FF;">visit<br/>
</span>one of the streets inhabited by the silk and cotton weavers.<br/>
<br/>
HISTORY. Little or nothing is known of the early history of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damietta</span>.<br/>
During the Arabian era Damietta attained a great reputation on account<br/>
of the resistance it <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the Crusaders; but the town of that period<br/>
stood farther to the N. than its modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">successor </span>(see below). In 1218 it<br/>
was besieged by King John of Jerusalem. With the <span style="color: #0000FF;">aid </span>of an ingenious<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">double </span>boat, constructed and fortified in accordance with a design by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Oliverius</span>, an engineer of Cologne, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frisians</span>, Germans, and others<br/>
of the besiegers succeeded after a fight of <span style="color: #ff0000;">tweastrf'1ve </span>hours in capturing<br/>
the tower to which the chain stretched across the river was attached.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">success </span>of the Christians was, however, considerably marred by the<br/>
interference of the ambitious, <span style="color: #ff0000;">thongh </span>energetic Pelagius <span style="color: #0000FF;">Galvani</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
papal legate, and by the vigilance of the Egyptian prince Melik el-Kamil.<br/>
At length, after <span style="color: #0000FF;">various </span>vicissitudes, the Christians captured the place.<br/>
They obtained valuable spoil, <span style="color: #0000FF;">sold </span>the surviving townspeople <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>slaves,<br/>
and converted the mosques into churches, bat in 1221 they were compelled<br/>
by a treaty to evacuate the town. In 1249, when Louis IX. landed near<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Damietta</span>, it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>abandoned <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>inhabitants. Without striking <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>blow,<br/>
the Crusaders marched into the deserted streets of the fortress, bat in the<br/>
course of the following year they were obliged to restore it to the Saracens<br/>
as part of the ransom of Louis <span style="color: #ff0000;">IX.</span>, who had been taken prisoner at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Many</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vra<br/>
</span>(p. 158). During the same year, by a resolution of the Emirs, the town<br/>
was destroyed, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">re-ereeted </span>on the E. bank of the river, farther <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the S.<br/>
The new town <span style="color: #0000FF;">soon </span>became an important manufacturing and commercial place. Its staple products were leather-wares, cloth, and essence of,<br/>
sesame, for which it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>famous, and its harbour was visited by ships ot<br/>
many different nations. By the construction of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mal1mili1tyeh </span>Canal<br/>
Damietta lost most of its trade, and its decline was farther accelerated<br/>
by the foundation of the ports on the Suez <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canal</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The principal Mosque is a huge, shapeless edifice, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">only<br/>
</span>redeeming features of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are the lofty minarets and the spacious<br/>
dome. All the houses of more stories than one are provided with<br/>
handsomely <span style="color: #0000FF;">carver </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>wooden jutties and <span style="color: #0000FF;">lattice-work</span>, which are in<br/>
