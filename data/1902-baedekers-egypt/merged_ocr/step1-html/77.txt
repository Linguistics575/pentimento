<br/>
</span>Magog will burst the barrier beyond which they were banished by<br/>
Alexander the Great. The end of all things will be ushered in by<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">trumpet-blasts </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>angel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Asrafil</span>; the first of these blasts will<br/>
kill every living being; a second will awaken the dead. Then <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Judgment; the righteous cross to Paradise by a bridge of a<br/>
hair's breadth, while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wicked </span>fall from the bridge into the abyss<br/>
of hell. Some Muslims believe in a kind of limbo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">like </span>that of the<br/>
Hebrews and Greeks, while others maintain that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>souls of the<br/>
dead proceed directly to the gates of Paradise. At the Judgment<br/>
every man is judged according to the books of the recording angels<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>lxiv). The good have the book placed in their right hands,<br/>
but it is placed in the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">hands </span>of the Wicked, bound behind<br/>
their <span style="color: #ff0000;">backs</span>. The scales in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>good and evil deeds are weighed<br/>
play an important part in deciding the soul's fate, a detail Which<br/>
gave rise to the subsequent doctrine of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">effieaey </span>of works. This<br/>
doctrine is carried so far that works of <span style="color: #0000FF;">supererogation </span>are believed<br/>
to be placed to the credit of the believer. The daemons and animals,<br/>
too, must be judged. Hell, as well as heaven, has different regions;<br/>
and there is also <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Purgatory</span>, from which release is possible. Paradise is depicted by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mol1ammeil</span>, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">consonance </span>with his thoroughly<br/>
sensual character, as a place of entirely material delights.<br/>
<br/>
The course of all events, including the salvation or perdition<br/>
of every individual, is, according to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koran</span>, absolutely predestined; although several later sects have <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to modify this<br/>
terrible doctrine. It is these views, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>give rise to<br/>
the pride of the Muslims. By virtue of their faith they regard themselves as certainly elect, and they make no attempt to convert others, as they have no power to alter the irrevocable decrees of God.<br/>
<br/>
In the second place the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>is considered to contain, not only a<br/>
standard of ethics, but also the foundation of a complete code <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflaw</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">MORALITY </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>specially adapted by its founder<br/>
to the character of the Arabs. 0f duties to one's neighbour, charity<br/>
is the most highly praised, and instances of its practice are not<br/>
unfrequent. Hospitality is much practised by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>, and by<br/>
the peasantry also in those districts <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are not overrun with<br/>
travellers. Frugality is another virtue of the Arabs, though too apt<br/>
with them to degenerate into avarice and <span style="color: #ff0000;">oupidity</span>. The law <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">debtor<br/>
</span>and creditor is lenient. Lending money at interest is forbidden by<br/>
the Koran, but is nevertheless largely practised, the lowest rate<br/>
in Syria being 12 per cent. The prohibition against eating unclean<br/>
animals, such as swine, is older than <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Islam</span>. It is impossible<br/>
to decide whether the prohibition of intoxicating drinks is due to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>prevalence of habits of <span style="color: #0000FF;">over-indulgence</span>, such as are depicted by<br/>
the poets before <span style="color: #ff0000;">Molurmmed</span>'s time, or is based on sanitary <span style="color: #0000FF;">Considerations</span>. Wine, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and-even </span>brandy, are largely consumed by<br/>
the upper classes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>among the Turks.<br/>
