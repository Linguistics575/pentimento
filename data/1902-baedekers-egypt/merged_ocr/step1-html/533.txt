the <span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>smallest, also <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>erection of Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, now in<br/>
ruins. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the walls to the right and left of the granite gateway are<br/>
representations in the usual style of the cities and tribes subdued<br/>
by Thutmosis III. (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">248</span>); to the right are the tribes of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">S</span>, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">left'the </span>tribes of the Upper Retenu (<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. Syria), which<br/>
His Majesty took in the wretched town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Megiddo</span>'.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the sixth pylon we enter the <span style="color: #ff0000;">1ihre-0ourt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sanetuary</span>, in which are two large Granite Pillars erected by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thate<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mosis </span>Ill.<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>The S. (right) pillar bears the lily of Upper Egypt, the<br/>
N. pillar the papyrus <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Lower Egypt. Here also are a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Must </span>ofa<br/>
Colossal Statue of Ammon and a headless Statue of the Goddess<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amonet</span>, in reddish sandstone, both dedicated by King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tut-env<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amon</span>, whose name was later replaced by that <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Haremheb, his<br/>
successor.<br/>
<br/>
To the right of the fore-court is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">colnnnade </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus-columns</span>,<br/>
built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thutmusis </span>HL, whence a fine view of the ruins is obtained.<br/>
Behind the entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>reliefs of the time of Sethos II.<br/>
<br/>
The Sanctuary, built by Philip <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arrhidaeus </span>on the site of an<br/>
earlier chamber, is not yet completely exhumed. It is built entirely<br/>
of pink granite, and is divided into two chambers. The front<br/>
chamber, opening to the W., is 19 ft. long, the hinder one, opening to the E., over 25 ft. The roof, which was adorned with<br/>
yellow stars upon a blue ground, has been completely destroyed.<br/>
The walls both outside and inside were covered with reliefs, the<br/>
colouring of which is still in good preservation at some points.<br/>
<br/>
Interior Walls. In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">firgt </span>chamber Philip appears <span style="color: #ff0000;">offering </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">saerittees<br/>
</span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">various </span>forms of Ammon. The figures and inscriptions are picked out<br/>
with bluish-green pigment. The reliefs in the second chamber are larger<br/>
and better executed, but in poorer preservation. Here, to the left, Philip<br/>
is seated at a banquet.<br/>
<br/>
Round the outside of the Sanctuary runs a raised CORRIDOR. Un the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>chamber are 4 rows of reliefs, the lowest of which is<br/>
destroyed: 1. Rites attending the entrance of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sanctuary </span>by the king;<br/>
the goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amonet </span>gives milk <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the king. 2, 3. The sacred boat of<br/>
Ammon on different festal <span style="color: #ff0000;">occasions</span>. On the S. wall of the second<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">cham </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">her </span>are four reliefs, representing the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to various forms<br/>
of Ammon, etc. On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span>wall of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>chamber the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">offers </span>two<br/>
small trees to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ammon-Kametf</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the N. wall of the second chamber<br/>
are reliefs similar to those on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">b</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wall</span>. The opposite wall, as well as<br/>
the back of the Sixth Pylon in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fore-court</span>, is <span style="color: #ff0000;">oeeupied-by </span>inscriptions,<br/>
known as the Annals of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thutmosia111.</span>, detailing the warlike acquisitions<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>that monarch. The relief above the inscription to the right of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">black </span>granite door depicts Thutmosis III. conferring gifts on the temple<br/>
(two <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>, vases, necklaces, chests)..<br/>
<br/>
Opening <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>this corridor are a number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms </span>all <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">less </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins</span>, which were built and embellished with reliefs by Queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Makere</span>.<br/>
As in all other places, the names and <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of the queen have been<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">scratched </span>out and replaced by those of Thutmosis II. or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>III.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing our progress still towards the E. beyond the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sanetuary</span>, we reach a flat open space, strewn with the scanty relics of<br/>
the earliest Temple of the Middle Empire. In front of the chambers<br/>
of Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, which may be recognized on the N. side, ran a<br/>
path, on which the Pharaohs erected statues to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">grandees </span>judged<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
