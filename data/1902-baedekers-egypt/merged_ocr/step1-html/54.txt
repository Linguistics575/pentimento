<br/>
</span>wrapped in a kind of blanket (<span style="color: #ff0000;">mclciya</span>). All <span style="color: #0000FF;">these'EthioPians</span>' are<br/>
remarkable for their fine and almost Caucasian east of features, their<br/>
very dark, <span style="color: #ff0000;">bronze-tlured </span>complexion, and their luxuriant growth<br/>
of hair, shading their heads like a cloud, or hanging down in <span style="color: #0000FF;">numberless </span>plaits over their necks and shoulders. Their figures are<br/>
beautifully symmetrical, and more or less slender in accordance<br/>
with their means of subsistence, and their limbs are gracefully and<br/>
delicately formed. In other respects they resemble all the other<br/>
children of the desert, as in the purity of their complexion, the<br/>
peculiar thinness of their necks, and the premature wrinkling <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the skin of their faces. Compared with their bold and quarrelsome<br/>
neighbours the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bisharin </span>(the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ancient'lehthyophagi</span>'), <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Ababdeh</span>,<br/>
who correspond to the'Troglodytes' of the Greeks, are exceedingly<br/>
gentle and inoffensive.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the Bega, there are numerous <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>who inhabit the<br/>
steppes and deserts belonging to the region of the Nile, but beyond<br/>
the limits of Egypt, and range as far as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfiues </span>of the heathen<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">11egro-raees </span>on the left bank of the Nile, nearly to <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P </span>N. latitude;<br/>
but with these we have not at present to deal. As regards the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduius </span>proper of the N., their common home, the desert, seems<br/>
to have exerted a unifying <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>upon races that were originally<br/>
different, and the peculiar characteristics of each <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>gradually<br/>
disappeared before the uniform environment of all.<br/>
<br/>
There are three important Beduin tribes in the peninsula of<br/>
Mount Sinai: the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Terdbiyin</span>; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tihdya</span>, who occupy the heart of<br/>
the peninsula, between Suez <span style="color: #ff0000;">and'Aliaba</span>; and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sawtrkeh </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">El'Araytgh</span>, to the north of the latter. In Upper Egypt, besides the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Ababdeh</span>, the only <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>who occupy the eastern bank of the<br/>
Nile are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bani </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Weed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Atwihti</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hawéddt</span>, who, however,<br/>
have now settled on both banks of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>Nile valley and <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>gradually blending with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellibin</span>, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mé'azeh</span>, who dwell<br/>
in groups among the limestone mountains between Suez and Keneh,<br/>
where there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">good </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pastures </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">places</span>. Most of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>,<br/>
on the other hand, who belong to Egypt, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoniine </span>themselves to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">western </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bank </span>of the Nile. They occupy the whole of this side of the<br/>
river from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayt1m </span>as far as Abydos near Girgeh, and it is mainly<br/>
with their aid that communication is maintained with the western<br/>
oases, peopled by a totally different race (comp. pp. xlv, <span style="color: #0000FF;">xlvi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, who<br/>
till the ground and possess <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>camels, being probably allied to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Berbers </span>of Northern Africa <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cone </span>of the numerous Libyan tribes<br/>
mentioned in ancient inscriptions).<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>of the North <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inherited </span>with comparative purity<br/>
the fiery blood of the desert-tribes, who achieved such marvellous<br/>
exploits under the banner of the prophet, but the traveller will<br/>
rarely come in contact with them unless he undertakes <span style="color: #ff0000;">ajourney<br/>
</span>across the desert. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>who assist travellers in the ascent<br/>
of the pyramids belong to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nagima </span>tribe. Genuine <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>are<br/>
