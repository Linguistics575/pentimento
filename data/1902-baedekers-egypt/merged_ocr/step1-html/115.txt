Repeated attempts were made during the 17th <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>18th centuries<br/>
to decipher the peculiar picture-writing of the ancient Egyptians,<br/>
the learned Jesuit father Athanasius Kircher <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>1601-80) being<br/>
among the earliest to take up the subject. It was not, however,<br/>
until the beginning of the 19th century that the key was <span style="color: #0000FF;">found</span>,<br/>
though <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saey</span>, a Frenchman, and Akerblad, a Swede, had previously<br/>
attained a certain amount of success in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">efforts </span>to find the clue.<br/>
Dr. Thomas Young, an English <span style="color: #0000FF;">scholar</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Franoois </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Champollion</span>,<br/>
a Frenchman, succeeded about the same date (<span style="color: #0000FF;">vie </span>in 1819 and in<br/>
1822) in discovering the <span style="color: #0000FF;">long-sought </span>alphabet from a careful comparison of royal <span style="color: #ff0000;">eartouehes</span>. Champollion afterwards followed up his<br/>
initial discovery <span style="color: #ff0000;">withsuch </span>success that he may fairly rank as the real<br/>
interpreter of the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>clue was afforded by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">famoils'Rosetia </span>Stone' (now in the<br/>
British Museum), discovered in 1799 in the Fort St. Julien at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rosetta</span>.<br/>
This <span style="color: #ff0000;">tahlet </span>of basalt bears three <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>: <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>in the ancient Egyptian<br/>
language, written in <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">popular </span>language of a<br/>
later period inscribed in <span style="color: #ff0000;">demotio </span>characters, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>third in Greek; hut<br/>
the two last are merely translations of the first. The subject of the triple<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>is a decree of the Egyptian priests issued in <span style="color: #ff0000;">196 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>in honour<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemy </span>V. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Epiphanes</span>. The first step <span style="color: #0000FF;">towards </span>deciphering the hieroglyphics was <span style="color: #ff0000;">made </span>when it was <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascertained </span>that the frequently occurring<br/>
groups <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>signs each enclosed in an oval (<span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouche</span>) were the<br/>
names of kings and that the name of Ptolemy must be found among them.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Champollion </span>and his successors established the phonetic <span style="color: #0000FF;">signification </span>of a large number of hieroglyphic symbols, and it then became possible, from a knowledge of Coptic, the latest form <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>ancient Egyptian language, not only <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>read but also to interpret<br/>
the inscriptions. H. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Brugseh</span>, who led the <span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>to the complete<br/>
interpretation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">demotic </span>texts, was also the first to point out that<br/>
in hieroglyphic writing, as in the Semitic systems of writing, only<br/>
the consonants were inscribed, while the vowels were omitted as<br/>
not essential.<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>form a system of picture-writing,<br/>
in which concrete objects were originally expressed by pictures <span style="color: #0000FF;">representing </span>them; <span style="color: #ff0000;">6.9.<br/>

</span>Abstract ideas and verbs were represented on the same principle<br/>
by the use of pictures of objects suggesting in some sort the idea<br/>
<br/>
to be expressed. Thus the idea'to rule' <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span>' was expressed by the<br/>
