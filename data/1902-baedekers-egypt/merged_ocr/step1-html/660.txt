period, in which Coptic gravestones also occur. On the hill above<br/>
is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">castellated </span>building. - On the opposite CE.) bank lay the Roman<br/>
fort of Contra Taphis, which has left no remains of importance.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond Tafeh the dark shining rocks advance close to the river..<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bank</span>, forming a kind of rocky gateway, known as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">131</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elKaldbsheh</span>. At a few isolated <span style="color: #0000FF;">points </span>a narrow strip of cultivated<br/>
land with palms borders the river; and on the E. bank lies a small<br/>
village. The navigation of this reach is somewhat intricate, owing<br/>
to the frequent bends of the river and the numerous islands. At<br/>
the point where the valley expands again lies a small island, with<br/>
some ruined buildings.<br/>
<br/>
31 M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kaldbsheh </span>forms a large commune on both banks of the<br/>
Nile, <span style="color: #ff0000;">comprizing </span>17 hamlets. - From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khwrmm</span>, a small village on<br/>
the W. bank, a desert-route leads round the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bib </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-lfalihsheh </span>to<br/>
Tafeh (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">3540</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">On </span>this route, about 1/2 M. from the village, is<br/>
a rock-inscription, dating from the 9th year of King Taharka. About<br/>
1 M. farther on, on a small plateau, is the ruined church of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sitteh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kumar</span>, built of rough <span style="color: #0000FF;">stones</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Hard by the river, as we proceed to the s., lie the ruins of the<br/>
ancient town of Talmis. Closely hemmed in by modern houses<br/>
appears the large<br/>
Tempel of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1ra1tosheh</span>, built in the reign of Augustus on the<br/>
site of an earlier <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary</span>, founded by Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>and refounded by one of the Ptolemies. It was never completely adorned<br/>
with reliefs and inscriptions; and those that are finished are very<br/>
crude, while the subjects of the representations are frequently<br/>
misunderstood. The temple was probably dedicated in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>place<br/>
to the god Mandulis (p. 339), to whom are addressed most of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicatory </span>inscriptions on the pylons, the walls of the vestibule,<br/>
and elsewhere. It was converted into a church on the introduction<br/>
of Christianity. The building is in comparatively good <span style="color: #0000FF;">preservation</span>, though all its chambers are strewn with fragments of the roof,<br/>
columns, and sculptures.<br/>
<br/>
The approach to the temple (<span style="color: #0000FF;">camp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the Plan, <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>356) is formed<br/>
by a Terrace, about 100 ft. long and 25 ft. broad, constructed of<br/>
hewn stones and still in excellent preservation. 0n the side next<br/>
the river is a rectangular projection, below which passes <span style="color: #ff0000;">aroad</span>; on<br/>
its landward side a flight of low steps ascends to a long and narrow<br/>
platform immediately in front of the pylon.<br/>
<br/>
The PYLON (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PIA</span>), the principal entrance to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-precincts</span>,<br/>
stands at a slight angle with the main axis of the temple and terrace.<br/>
Only the top of it has been destroyed, but it has no reliefs whatever,<br/>
with the exception of two representations of gods in the doorway.<br/>
Each tower of the pylon has a groove for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flag-staff </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>p. 316).<br/>
<br/>
The COURT (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. B), between the pylon and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">vestlbulez </span>was<br/>
surrounded on three sides by <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>, of which only a single<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">23 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">*<br/>
