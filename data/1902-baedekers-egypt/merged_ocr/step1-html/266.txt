The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gami'a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">galaen </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. F, 6), situated to the N.E. of the Mosque<br/>
of Mohammed'Ali, was erected in 1317 by Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Nasir</span>. Long used<br/>
as a military magazine and storehouse, it has recently been cleared out,<br/>
and is willingly shown by the British military authorities. It exhibits<br/>
traces of the Romanesque taste <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the exterior, particularly <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the portals.<br/>
In the interior are some marble columns with ancient capitals.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately to the SE. of the Mosque of Ibn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ira12i1n </span>is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called<br/>
</span>Well of Joseph (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Birl'tlsuf</span>; <span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>F, 6), a square shaft, <span style="color: #0000FF;">smik </span>in the limestone rock<br/>
to a depth of 290 ft. Within the shaft, at a depth of about 155 ft., is a<br/>
platform on which the oxen stood that brought the water to the surface<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>means of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">salgiyeh</span>. The well formerly provided the citadel with water,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>has lost its importance since the completion of the new water-works<br/>
(p. 63). When the citadel was constructed here in the 12th <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>, the<br/>
builders discovered an ancient shaft <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">sand</span>, which <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saldheddin<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fttsuf </span>(p. 32) caused to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>re-opened and named after <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fc1stfrns</span>, or<br/>
Joseph's, Well. This circumstance gave rise to the tradition, which was<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">current </span>among the Jews, that this was the well into which the<br/>
Joseph of Scripture was put by his brethren.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gami'a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Suléman </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pasha </span>(Pl. F, 6), also called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sciryat</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span>.<br/>
side of the citadel, was erected in 1526 by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sn1iimiin</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke</span>, afterwards Sultan Selim. The architecture is a mixture of Arabian and Turkish.<br/>
The mosque is small, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">carefully </span>executed. It contains <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cutie </span>inscriptions,<br/>
marble mosaics, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>decorated prayer-recess, a pulpit in marble, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">door-mounts</span>.<br/>
<br/>
To the tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs </span>and Mamelukes, see <span style="color: #0000FF;">p.61</span>.<br/>
<br/>
From the <span style="color: #0000FF;">BO </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">21-68621 </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">'monntain-gate0</span>, to the E. of the citadel, a road<br/>
leads straight to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohattam </span>(p. 108). A road diverging to the right a<br/>
little farther on leads to <span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dervish </span>Monastery (visitors admitted), situated<br/>
on a mountain-slope. (The monastery may also be reached from the Place<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Méhémet </span>Ali <span style="color: #0000FF;">via </span>the narrow lanes between the Tombs of the Mamelukes<br/>
and the citadel.) An easy staircase ascends to an attractive court, in<br/>
which are situated the residences of the monks. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coffee </span>is frequently<br/>
offered to travellers, all recompense being declined. From the court a<br/>
dark cave (probably an old quarry) enters the mountain-side, with the<br/>
graves of deceased dervishes. At the end is a chamber containing the tomb<br/>
of the founder of the order of dervishes, where worshippers are frequently<br/>
observed. The remains of a female relative of the Khedive also rest here<br/>
under an elaborate gilt tomb.<br/>
<br/>
We return to the Place <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ruméleh </span>(p. 51) and follow the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shari'a<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed'Ali </span>to its intersection with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bhihia </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et-Irdmtyeh<br/>
</span>(Pl. D, 5, <span style="color: #0000FF;">B</span>; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-drivers </span>know <span style="color: #ff0000;">short-outs </span>hither from the<br/>
citadel). We follow the latter street and its continuation <span style="color: #ff0000;">es-8iyiiftyeV </span>Three minarets soon come into sight, the two most distant<br/>
belonging to the dei'a <span style="color: #ff0000;">8heklitm </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">P1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">D</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">6</span>). At the corner opposite<br/>
the mosque is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebil </span>of the Mother <span style="color: #ff0000;">of'Abbli8 </span>I. (Pl. D, <span style="color: #0000FF;">6</span>), in<br/>
marble, rich and effective in general appearance, but lacking finish<br/>
in its details. The street now takes the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">8Mri'a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er-Rukbtyeh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on</span>. D, 6, <span style="color: #0000FF;">T</span>). We follow it for about 300 yds., and turn down the<br/>
Sharia Ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">Town </span>to the right, in which, after about 70 yds. more,<br/>
we observe on the right a lane leading to the E. entrance of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*aArssirts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tu1tin </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. D, 7; also pronounced <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ta1ihi</span>). This<br/>
mosque, the oldest in Cairo, was erected by Ahmed Ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">Titian</span>, the<br/>
founder of the dynasty of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulunides </span>(p. xciii), in the year 879.<br/>
