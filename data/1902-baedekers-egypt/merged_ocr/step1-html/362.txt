<span>PYRAMIDS <span style="color: #0000FF;">0F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ABUStR</span>. 8<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Route. 129<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">8hohrtment</span>. After about 1 hr. we have the large cemetery of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shobrement </span>on our right. A low mound of rubbish on the summit of the<br/>
desert-plateau marks the site of the stone-pyramid of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ttrural/et<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elJArydn</span>. In 11/2 hr. we reach the rubbish heaps of-<br/>
Abu <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gurtrli</span>, formerly also called the Pyramid <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofRigh</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">exploration </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>which was carried on in 1898-1901, on behalf of Berlin<br/>
Museum, by <span style="color: #0000FF;">DIS</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Borohardt </span>and Schaefer. The building <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a<br/>
Sanctuary of the Sun God, erected by King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra-en-vos</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>(5th Dyn.)<br/>
on the occasion of the jubilee of his accession.<br/>
<br/>
The sanctuary stands <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>an <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>platform and consists of an<br/>
uncovered court, 330 ft. long by 250 ft. broad, with its entrance on the<br/>
E. side, while in the posterior (W.) half of it rose the large Obelisk of the<br/>
Sun<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>From the entrance-gate a covered passage, ornamented with fine<br/>
reliefs, led to the left along the E. and S. sides of the court, and then<br/>
turned to the right (<span style="color: #ff0000;">N.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>to reach the obelisk. The obelisk itself has<br/>
totally vanished, but part of the platform of masonry on which it <span style="color: #0000FF;">stand<br/>
</span>is still <span style="color: #0000FF;">extent</span>; and the top of this, reached by an internal <span style="color: #0000FF;">staircase</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">commands </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>view. In the front half of the court was the place for<br/>
slaughtering the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>bulls; the channels or gutters in the pavement<br/>
empty themselves into nine alabaster basins (originally ten). <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>front of<br/>
the platform of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisk </span>stands the <span style="color: #0000FF;">altar</span>, 19 ft. long, 18 ft. broad, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">4 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>high, built of five massive blocks of alabaster<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the S. side of the<br/>
obelisk is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>ruined chapel, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>embellished with admirable reliefs<br/>
(now partly in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairn</span>, partly in Berlin). <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the N. side of the obelisk<br/>
was another <span style="color: #ff0000;">gaerificia,1 </span>court. The N. side of the court was <span style="color: #0000FF;">flanked </span>by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">treasure-houses</span>, reached from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance-gate </span>by a passage (to the right)<br/>
similar to that described above. - The town connected with the sanctuary<br/>
lay in the valley to the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the hill.<br/>
<br/>
The three largest Pyramids of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abusir</span>, erected by kings of the<br/>
5th Dyn., stand close together about 3/4 M. to the S.W. of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gur'ab</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>masonry of these monuments, having originally been constructed with no great care, is now much damaged,<br/>
and their bases are covered with sand. The entrances are on the N.<br/>
sides, and the interior chambers are almost completely in ruins.<br/>
The northernmost of the pyramids belonged to King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sehmé</span>, and<br/>
was connected by a still traceable path with a building (probably a<br/>
temple) situated in the plain. Its perpendicular height was 1631/2 ft.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>now <span style="color: #0000FF;">118 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft.</span>), its sides <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>2581/2 ft. (now <span style="color: #ff0000;">2171/4 </span>ft.) in length,<br/>
and they were inclined at the angle of <span style="color: #ff0000;">51° </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">d'2/ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">My</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>. The central<br/>
pyramid, to the S. of the last, belonged to King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ra-en-woser<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>5th Dyn.). The builder of the largest pyramid (sides <span style="color: #0000FF;">108</span>, formerly<br/>
1201/2 yds.; perpendicular height 165, formerly 229 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span>), situated<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>little to the S.W., was King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nefer-er-ke-ré </span>(5th Dyn.). The other<br/>
pyramids, some of which were certainly also sanctuaries of the sun,<br/>
are mere heaps of ruins, and one of them (to the S.W. of the largest)<br/>
seems never to have been completed.<br/>
<br/>
A few paces to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>. of the Pyramid of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sehuré </span>is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastaba<br/>
</span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptahshepses </span>(5th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dye</span>), excavated by De Morgan in 1893. It is<br/>
mostly covered up again; the locked chambers are opened by the<br/>
Ghafir <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abusir</span>. We first enter a large hall (not all <span style="color: #0000FF;">accessible</span>)<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
roof of which is supported on twenty square pillars. Thence a door<br/>
