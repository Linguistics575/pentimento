French troops at Cairo, where he was assassinated on 14th June,<br/>
1800. In 1801 the French garrison <span style="color: #0000FF;">under </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Belliard</span>, being hard pressed<br/>
by the grand-vizier, was compelled to <span style="color: #0000FF;">capitulate</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>3rd August,<br/>
1805, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammad'Ali</span>, as the recognised pasha of Egypt, took possession <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the citadel, which for the last time witnessed a bloody<br/>
scene on <span style="color: #ff0000;">1st </span>March, 1811, when the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span>Beys were massacred<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Molyunmed</span>'s order. The insurrection <span style="color: #ff0000;">of'Arabi </span>in 1882 scarcely<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">affected </span>Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">**Street </span>Scenes presented by the city of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">afford<br/>
</span>an inexhaustible fund of amusement and delight, admirably<br/>
illustrating the whole world of Oriental <span style="color: #0000FF;">fiction</span>, and producing an<br/>
indelible impression on the uninitiated denizen of the West. This<br/>
Oriental life seems to feel the atmosphere of the newer quarters<br/>
uncongenial, and it must therefore be sought for in the old Arabian<br/>
quarters, which are still mostly inaccessible for carriages, in spite<br/>
of the many new streets that have been constructed in Cairo of late<br/>
years. Most of the streets in the old part of the town are still <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpaved</span>, and they are too often excessively dirty. Many of them are<br/>
so narrow that there is hardly room for two riders to pass, and the<br/>
projecting balconies of the harems with their gratings often nearly<br/>
meet. The busy <span style="color: #ff0000;">traffie </span>in these streets presents an'interminable,<br/>
ravelled, and twisted string of men, women, and animals, of walkers, riders, and carts of every description. Add to this the cracking<br/>
of the drivers' whips, the jingling of money at the table of the<br/>
changers established at every corner of the street, the rattling <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the brazen vessels of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-carriers</span>, the moaning <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the camels,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">braying </span>of donkeys, and barking of dogs, and you have a perfect<br/>
Pandemonium'. It is not, however, until the traveller has learned<br/>
to distinguish the various individuals who throng the streets, and<br/>
knows their <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>pursuits, that he can thoroughly appreciate<br/>
his walks or rides. We may therefore give a brief description of<br/>
some of the leading characteristics of the different members of the<br/>
community.<br/>
<br/>
From a very early period it has been customary for the Arabs<br/>
to distinguish their different sects, families, and dynasties by the<br/>
colour of their Turbans. And the custom still prevails to a certain<br/>
extent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The'Sherits</span>', or descendants of the prophet, now wear<br/>
white turbans, though originally they wore green, the colour of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>prophet. Green <span style="color: #0000FF;">turban</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>are now frequently worn by the Mecca<br/>
pilgrims. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">llama</span>, or clergy and scholars, <span style="color: #0000FF;">usually </span>wear a very<br/>
wide, evenly folded turban of light colour. The orthodox length of<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">believer</span>'s turban is seven times that of his head, being equivalent<br/>
to the whole length of his body, in order that the turban may <span style="color: #0000FF;">afterwards </span>be used as the wearer's winding sheet, and that this <span style="color: #0000FF;">circumstance </span>may <span style="color: #ff0000;">familiarise </span>him with the thought of death. The<br/>
dress and turbans of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ews</span>, and other <span style="color: #ff0000;">non-Muslim </span>citizens,<br/>
