The Palace of Gizeh, a huge rambling <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>, built in a light<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">11ns11bstantial </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Oriental </span>style, with about 500 saloons and apartments, was erected by the Khedive <span style="color: #ff0000;">Isma'tl </span>for his harem at a cost<br/>
stated at 120 million francs. In 1889 the Museum of Egyptian<br/>
Antiquities, formerly at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bt1lilr</span>, was installed here, but the process<br/>
of transferring this valuable collection to a more suitable and safer<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>, recently completed, has begun (see p. 40).<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Museum </span>of Egyptian Antiquities is the most valuable<br/>
collection of the kind. It was founded by the eminent French Egyptologist Aug. Mariette (d. 1881). The present director is the no less<br/>
eminent G. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maspero</span>; the conservator is Emil Brugsch-Bey, assisted<br/>
by Ahmed Kamal Bey and <span style="color: #0000FF;">G. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Daressy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>- The earliest description of<br/>
