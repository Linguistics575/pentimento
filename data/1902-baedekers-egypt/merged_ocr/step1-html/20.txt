<br/>
PLAN. The facilities for travel in Egypt are now such that the<br/>
intending visitor may make an outline of his tour at home with<br/>
almost as great ease as for most of the countries <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Europe</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>During<br/>
the travelling season, moreover, the weather is always fine (<span style="color: #0000FF;">pomp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>below), and never causes disappointment and derangement <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plans<br/>
</span>as in most other countries. A glimpse of the country may be obtained in four or <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>weeks (exclusive of the journey out) as follows: 2-3 days may be devoted to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>and the journey<br/>
thence to Cairo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">10-12 </span>days may be spent in Cairo and its neighbourhood in the manner suggested at p. 30, 3 days may be given to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayilrtt</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">3-4 </span>days may be occupied by the Suez Canal and excursions from it<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and 14 days may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>devoted to Upper Egypt (railway to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>a few days must be set aside for resting,<br/>
The whole time, however, might very pleasantly be spent at Cairo<br/>
alone, the most interesting point in the tour.<br/>
<br/>
SEASON. The best time for a tour in Egypt is between Nov. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1st<br/>
</span>and May 1st. In Alexandria stormy and rainy weather prevails from<br/>
December to <span style="color: #0000FF;">March</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but in the interior of Egypt, to the S. of a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">linejoining </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Darnanht1r</span>, Tanta, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mans.s1lra</span>, the case is completely<br/>
altered. Even in the Delta, however, marked falls in temperature<br/>
(sometimes to <span style="color: #0000FF;">43Â° </span>Fahr) occur between the end of November and<br/>
the end of <span style="color: #0000FF;">March</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">rain-storms</span>, rendering the roads almost impassable, are not infrequent. December and January are sometimes<br/>
very cold in Cairo, which is the more inconvenient as there are no<br/>
adequate heating-arrangements in the houses; but <span style="color: #0000FF;">Non</span>, Feb., and<br/>
March are very tine, as also usually are <span style="color: #ff0000;">Oot.</span>, April, and May,<br/>
especially for travellers who do not object to alittle heat. In Upper<br/>
Egypt, from the beginning of November till the middle or end of<br/>
April, there are but few days of bad weather (<span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span>. p. xxvi); the<br/>
prevalent temperature is that of a delicious spring or moderate<br/>
summer. The fertilising inundation of the Nile (p. 1) has by this<br/>
time subsided, and the whole face of the country smiles with fresh<br/>
verdure. Those who intend to winter in Egypt should spend Nov.<br/>
in Cairo, move on thence in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dee.</span>, on the approach of cold weather,<br/>
to Upper Egypt (Luxor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>), and return to Cairo in February.<br/>
- In summer prices are naturally much lower.<br/>
<br/>
EXPENSES. The cost of a tour in Egypt, and in Oriental <span style="color: #ff0000;">i3OUntries </span>generally, is greater than that <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>visit to most parts <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Europe</span>,<br/>
and the traveller should estimate his average daily expenditure at<br/>
not less than <span style="color: #0000FF;">25-3</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">%</span>. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Steamboat-fares </span>are of course extra; <span style="color: #ff0000;">pp</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I-C</span>)<br/>
The traveller whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">time </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">1ery </span>limited, or who is accompanied by<br/>
<br/>
