festivals some of them fall into <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">kind </span>of epileptic <span style="color: #0000FF;">convulsion</span>, and foam<br/>
at the mouth; but no notice is taken of them, and they are left to recover without assistance. - The <span style="color: #ff0000;">zikrs </span>of the dancing dervishes <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>formerly <span style="color: #0000FF;">took </span>place in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tekkiyeh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Molawiyeh</span>, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span>. of the Place<br/>
Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hasan </span>(Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">D</span>, 6), are now discontinued.<br/>
<br/>
The WORSHIP <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>SAINTS AND <span style="color: #0000FF;">MARTYRS </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">inculcated </span>in connection with <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam </span>at an early period. The faithful undertook<br/>
pilgrimages to the graves of the departed in the belief that death<br/>
did not interrupt the possibility of communication with them.<br/>
Thus the tomb of Mohammed at Medina, and that of his grandson<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hosén </span>at Kerbela, became particularly famous, and every little<br/>
town soon boasted of the tomb of its particular saint. In many of<br/>
the villages the traveller will observe small <span style="color: #0000FF;">dome-covered </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">buildings </span>with grated windows. These are saints' tombs and are called<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hilhtslthst </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span>. p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Clxiii</span>).<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Shah</span>' also means a chief or old man.<br/>
Shreds of cloth are often seen suspended <span style="color: #0000FF;">fromthe </span>gratings of these<br/>
tombs, or on certain trees <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are considered sacred, having<br/>
been placed there by devout persons. About the end of the 18th<br/>
century a reaction against the abuses of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam </span>sprang up in<br/>
Central Arabia. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">WAHHABITEs</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wahhabees</span>, named after<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">founder'Abd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Wahhab</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to restore the religion<br/>
to its original purity; they destroyed all tombs <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">saints</span>, including<br/>
even those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hosén</span>, as objects of superstitious<br/>
reverence, and sought to restore the primitive simplicity of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Prophet</span>'s code of morals; they even forbade smoking as being <span style="color: #0000FF;">intoxicating</span>. They soon became a great political power, and had not<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed'Ali </span>deemed it his interest to <span style="color: #0000FF;">suppress </span>them, their <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>would have been far more widely extended than it now is.<br/>
<br/>
We have <span style="color: #0000FF;">hitherto </span>spoken of the doctrines of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sunnites </span>(from<br/>
sunna,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'tradition0</span>, who form one great sect <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam</span>. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">all </span>early<br/>
period the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SHi'ITEs </span>(from <span style="color: #0000FF;">sWa</span>,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'sect</span>') seceded from the Sunnites.<br/>
They assigned to <span style="color: #0000FF;">VAli</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">son-in-law </span>of Mohammed, a rank equal<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>even superior to that of the prophet himself; they regarded him<br/>
as an <span style="color: #0000FF;">incarnation </span>of the Deity, and believed in the divine mission<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">imams </span>descended from him. El-Mahdi, the last of these, is<br/>
believed by them not to have died, but to be awaiting in concealment the coming of the last day. The Persians are all <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shi'ites</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">To-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wards </span>the West also <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shi'itism </span>was widely disseminated at an early<br/>
period, particularly in Egypt under the régime of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite<br/>
</span>sovereigns. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shi'ites </span>are extremely fanatical, refusing even to<br/>
eat in the society of persons of a different creed. As to the other<br/>
sects, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eontined </span>to Syria <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Metdwileh</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismatut1ph</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nosairtyeh</span>,<br/>
