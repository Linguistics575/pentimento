<br/>
Public Safety. The authority of the Khedive is so well established throughout the whole of Egypt that travellers are as safe as<br/>
in Europe. Weapons for <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-defence </span>are an unnecessary <span style="color: #0000FF;">encumbrance</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fowling-pieces </span>may be purchased in Cairo or they may<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>had for hire at the principal hotels. Sportsmen who bring their<br/>
own guns will find it very troublesome to clear them at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eustomhouse</span>, and cartridges also are contraband (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>xv). Ammunition (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ineluding </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lefaucheux </span>cartridges) may be bought in Cairo, but not<br/>
higher up, where only <span style="color: #0000FF;">coarse </span>gun-powder can be obtained.<br/>
<br/>
Consulates. Consuls in the East enjoy the same privilege of<br/>
exterritoriality as <span style="color: #0000FF;">ambassadors </span>in other countries. On public <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasions </span>they are attended by <span style="color: #ff0000;">kavasses</span>, or armed consular <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers</span>. A<br/>
distinction is sometimes made between professional <span style="color: #ff0000;">C'eonsules<br/>
</span>missi') and commercial <span style="color: #0000FF;">consuls</span>; and there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">consuls </span>general <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>who<br/>
act also as political agents), <span style="color: #0000FF;">consuls</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vice-consuls</span>, and consular<br/>
agents, possessing various degrees of authority. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>all cases of emergency the traveller should apply for advice to the nearest consul<br/>
of his country.<br/>
<br/>
Courts of Justice. In place of the exclusive consular jurisdiction to which foreigners were formerly liable, a system of Mixed<br/>
Tribunals was established in 1876. The judges consist of natives<br/>
and foreigners (the latter generally appointed by the Khedive from<br/>
qualified <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieials </span>nominated by the Great Powers), who give their<br/>
verdicts in accordance with Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">law</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>founded on that <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofl'rance<br/>
</span>and Italy. Cases in which the Khedive himself and the Egyptian<br/>
government are concerned are also tried before this tribunal, which<br/>
includes courts of <span style="color: #ff0000;">tirst </span>and second instance. The courts of the first<br/>
instance are at Cairo, Alexandria, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Msns.tira</span>, and there is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">delegation </span>at Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Said</span>. The appeal-court is at Alexandria. Lists of<br/>
qualified barristers are exhibited in the anterooms of the courts. Cases between natives, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">criminal </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cases</span>, are tried by the Native<br/>
Courts, established in 1884. Courts of the first instance are situated<br/>
at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo </span>Alexandria, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Benisn√©f </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Assitlt</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Keneh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and also (with a<br/>
more <span style="color: #0000FF;">limited </span>jurisdiction) at Tanta and <span style="color: #0000FF;">oicr.sii</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Z </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">zik</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">appeal-court </span>is at Cairo; about half the number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">judges </span>are<br/>
Europeans. The procedure is based upon the Code <span style="color: #0000FF;">Napoleon</span>.<br/>

<br/>
The average Oriental regards the European traveller as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Croesus<br/>
</span>and sometimes too as a madman, - so unintelligible to him are<br/>
the objects and pleasures of <span style="color: #0000FF;">travelling</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Be therefore looks upon him<br/>
as fair <span style="color: #0000FF;">game</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">feels </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">justified </span>in pressing upon him with <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">perp </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">etual<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">dem </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">bakshish </span>which <span style="color: #ff0000;">simplymeans'a </span>gift'. Travellers are often<br/>
tempted to give for the sake of <span style="color: #0000FF;">affording </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">temporary </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pleasure </span>at a trifling<br/>
