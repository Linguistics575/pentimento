<span>366 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">33.'AMADA</span>. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Korosko<br/>
<br/>
</span>appears the praying figure of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Setaw</span>, who was governor of Ethiopia<br/>
under Ramses II. Beyond the pylon extended originally a court<br/>
enclosed by brick walls, while at the back stood a hall, supported<br/>
by four <span style="color: #0000FF;">proto-Dorie </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cxxxiii</span>) columns. This court was afterwards<br/>
converted by Thutmosis IV. into a covered HYPOSTYLE HALL (still<br/>
in good preservation) by the erection of 12 columns and stone sidewalls. The reliefs on the pillars and walls show Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>in<br/>
intercourse with the gods; and the votive inscriptions on the pillars<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">architraves </span>also date from that king. The columns are embellished with perpendicular bands of inscriptions, containing dedications by Thutmosis III. or Amenophis Il., who are also represented<br/>
on the rear-wall before the gods.<br/>
<br/>
The following <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRANSVERSE </span>CHAMBER <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">241/2 </span>ft. broad and 61/2<br/>
deep. To the right on the inside of the Entrance Wall is Thutmosis III. embraced by Isis, and then Amenophis II. offering <span style="color: #0000FF;">libations </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-RE</span>. On the left Thout and Horus of Edfu pour the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">consecrating </span>water, symbolized by the hieroglyphs for'life', over<br/>
Amenophis II. - Three doors in the back-wall of this room lead<br/>
into other <span style="color: #0000FF;">apartments </span>The central one enters the SANCTUARY, on<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back-wall </span>of which is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">State </span>of great historical importance. At<br/>
the top is a relief of <span style="color: #ff0000;">AmenoPhis </span>II. presenting two vessels of wine<br/>
to Ré-Harmachis and Ammon; beneath is an inscription of 20 lines,<br/>
from the 3rd year of the reign <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>IL, recording the completion of the temple begun by Thutmosis III. and the campaign of<br/>
Amenophis II. in Syria. Among other details the king records that<br/>
he captured seven Syrian princes and hanged six of them on the<br/>
walls of Thebes and the seventh at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Napata </span>(p. 382). - Doors (of<br/>
later construction) to the right and left of the sanctuary each admit<br/>
into two Chambers, also accessible from the above-mentioned transverse chamber. The most interesting reliefs here are those in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>room to the right, representing the ceremonies at the foundation<br/>
of a temple.<br/>
<br/>
Between the temple and the river are the foundations of a small Chapel.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile here describes a curve from E. to W., on the E. bank<br/>
of which are (10 M.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diwdn </span>and<br/>
Derr, one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">handsomest </span>villages in Nubia, prettily situated<br/>
beneath <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores </span>and date-palms. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the river-bank is the ruined<br/>
residence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kashif</span>, who was formerly independent ruler of<br/>
Lower Nubia. In the village is a large mosque, and between the<br/>
village and the hills lies an extensive cemetery with a tasteful<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh</span>'s tomb. Close by, at the foot of the hills, lies the small and<br/>
unfortunately <span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span>injured <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rock </span>Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Derr</span>. This was known<br/>
to the Egyptians as the'Temple of Ramses in the House of <span style="color: #0000FF;">135</span>' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ale</span>.<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis-Derr</span>). It was built by Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">II.</span>, and was dedicated<br/>
to the sun-god <span style="color: #0000FF;">ite-Harmachis</span>. We <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>enter the much ruined<br/>
GREAT HYPOSTYLE HALL, <span style="color: #0000FF;">421/2 </span>ft. deep by 46 ft. broad, the sides of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>were partly formed by the smoothed rocks of the hill. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>
