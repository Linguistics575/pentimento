<br/>
where cultivation ceases. Thence the route, still running to the N.,<br/>
crosses the ancient bed of the lake, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is now overgrown with<br/>
heath and affords pasturage to numerous herds <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">buffaloes</span>. Various<br/>
small <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-courses </span>and canals are traversed; and in 11/2 hr. more<br/>
we reach the banks of the Birket <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karun</span>, which are covered with<br/>
reeds and tamarisk shrubs.<br/>
<br/>
The Birket <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karim</span>, Le<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>'lake of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ILutn</span>' (the <span style="color: #0000FF;">HebreW'Korah </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, also,<br/>
though erroneously, called Birket <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-ls'uran</span>, or'lake of the horns',<br/>
from its shape, is the Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moeris </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span>Greeks. It measures 34 M.<br/>
in length, and, at its broadest part, is about <span style="color: #ff0000;">6</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">% </span>M. wide. It lies<br/>
about 130 ft. below the level of the Mediterranean, and its depth<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">averages </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">13 </span>ft. The greenish water is slightly brackish (scarcely <span style="color: #0000FF;">fit<br/>
</span>for drinking). Numerous pelicans, <span style="color: #0000FF;">wild </span>ducks, and other water-fowl<br/>
frequent the lake. The banks are extremely sterile. The right of<br/>
fishing is let by government, and the whole of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fishermen </span>dwelling<br/>
on the banks of the lake are in the service of the lessee, who receives one-half of the catch.<br/>
<br/>
The boats (merkeb) are very simply constructed, being without<br/>
deck or <span style="color: #0000FF;">west</span>; the traveller must take up his quarters on the flooring<br/>
in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">stern</span>. The lake is crossed in <span style="color: #ff0000;">14</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">% </span>hr., <span style="color: #0000FF;">according </span>to the wind.<br/>
To the E. appears the peninsula of Et- <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gestreh</span>, with rubbish-heaps,<br/>
near which are the scanty <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Et-mmmtm</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the lake are<br/>
two islands of some size; that to the E. is named <span style="color: #ff0000;">et-KeMeh </span>or'the<br/>
chureh', that to the W. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seziiret </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-ffurn</span>, or'island of the horn'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>the N. bank of the lake are barren hills of considerable height. We<br/>
land on the N. bank, immediately to the W. of the peninsula of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Kum</span>. Thence a somewhat steep path ascends to the (13/4 M.)<br/>
ruins and temple of<br/>
Demeh (Dimeh or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dimay</span>). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortified </span>position of this town,<br/>
named in antiquity <span style="color: #ff0000;">Soknopaiou </span>NEsos, i.e.'island of (the good)<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Soknopaios</span>' (a form of Sobk, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayt1rn </span>deity), provided a secure<br/>
point of departure for the caravans trading with the oases in the<br/>
Libyan Desert. The ruins cover an area of about 125 acres. A<br/>
street, 400 yds. in length, formerly embellished with figures of lions,<br/>
leads past well-preserved houses to a platform on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>an important temple once stood. This temple, built under the Ptolemies,<br/>
was dedicated to <span style="color: #ff0000;">SoknoPaios </span>(see above) and the'beautifully enthroned Isis'. The paved court was surrounded by a brick wall, and<br/>
the temple itself contained several apartments, those in the rear<br/>
being lined with well-jointed limestone-blocks, and those in front<br/>
having walls of roughly hewn stone coated with stucco. Very few<br/>
reliefs have been found here; on one appears a Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">praying<br/>
</span>before a ram-headed deity (probably <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>).<br/>
<br/>
At the foot of a steep descent in the Libyan Desert, about 5 M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>the N.W. of Demeh, Dr. Schweinfurth discovered a small temple of limestone masonry, perhaps dating from the Early or the Middle Empire. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">contains </span>seven recesses and several other apartments, but no sculptures<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>inscriptions. In the vicinity are remains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span>quay.<br/>
