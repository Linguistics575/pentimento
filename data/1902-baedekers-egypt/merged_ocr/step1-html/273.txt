<span>60 Route J. CAIRO. <span style="color: #ff0000;">J</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Northern<br/>
<br/>
in 1293, <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>the largest monument of its period and is of <span style="color: #0000FF;">considerable </span>architectural interest. Many of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">details</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>the<br/>
windows, recall the Romanesque style of Europe. Originally there<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a separate ward for every known disease, besides <span style="color: #0000FF;">lecture-rooms<br/>
</span>for students and an orphanage. Now, however, decay and alteration<br/>
have so changed the building that only the wards surrounding the<br/>
principal court can be <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfidently </span>identified.<br/>
<br/>
The Portal is constructed of black and <span style="color: #0000FF;">white </span>marble, and is of<br/>
imposing height. The doors still show traces of their former covering<br/>
of bronze. The ceiling of the entrance, with its open beams, is also<br/>
very effective; the other corridors are vaulted in the Gothic style.<br/>
The first door on the left leads into the mosque; the second door on<br/>
the right leads to the Vestibule of the Tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kaléa'n</span>. The tomb<br/>
itself <span style="color: #0000FF;">contains </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tine </span>granite columns and pillars, which once supported the dome. The prayer-recess, with its mosaics, its beautiful<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dwarf-areades</span>, and its shell-shaped ornamentation, is also worthy of<br/>
notice. The marble and <span style="color: #0000FF;">tortoise-shell </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ornamentation </span>of the lower<br/>
parts <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>walls and <span style="color: #0000FF;">pillars </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>the finest <span style="color: #ff0000;">inOairo</span>. In the tomb chamber<br/>
are still preserved articles of dress which once belonged to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kalaun<br/>
</span>and are popularly supposed to possess <span style="color: #0000FF;">miraculous </span>healing virtues.<br/>
<br/>
Adjacent to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mt1risttm</span>, as the second of the three <span style="color: #ff0000;">ediflees<br/>
</span>mentioned above, is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Medréseh </span>and Tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">enNasir</span>, dating from about 1303, but now almost a <span style="color: #0000FF;">total </span>ruin.<br/>
<br/>
We enter it from the street by a marble portal in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">late-Romanesque<br/>
</span>style, brought by a brother of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nasir </span>from the church <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofAkka</span>, which was<br/>
destroyed in 1291. The top of it has been completed in the Arab <span style="color: #0000FF;">manner</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>The door leads into a corridor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">0n </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">right </span>side <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">whichis </span>the tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">High<br/>
</span>(dome in ruins), while to the left is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">medrilseh</span>, with<br/>
interesting plaster carvings on the side of the prayer-recess. In front are<br/>
the ruins of the main building, now containing workshops and huts of<br/>
the poor. The remnants of plaster decorations on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">back~walls</span>, like<br/>
those in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">medreseh </span>and on the interesting <span style="color: #0000FF;">minarets</span>, recall in some<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">respects </span>those of the Alhambra.<br/>
<br/>
The third large building is <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Barlrtilrireh</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">medréseh </span>of<br/>
Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">13ka </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ci382-99</span>; p. xcvi), built in 1384, Which also contains the tomb of the daughter of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barlyllp </span>It possesses an interesting marble portal and a bronze-mounted door. The greater part of<br/>
it was thoroughly restored a few years ago, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colouring </span>and<br/>
gilding applied to the sanctuary and mausoleum are, <span style="color: #ff0000;">unforunately</span>,<br/>
much too loud. <span style="color: #ff0000;">-.-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Opposite is a modern <span style="color: #ff0000;">sebil</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing to follow the busy <span style="color: #ff0000;">8lutrra </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">en-Naliluhtn </span>(p. 59), the<br/>
continuation of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lh5hergtyeh</span>, we come to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sehit'Abd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er-Ralimtm</span>, at a fork of the street, one of the prettiest structures of its sort<br/>
in Cairo (18th cent<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">j</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On the <span style="color: #ff0000;">groundflpori </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IS </span>the chamber for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">distribution </span>of the water, tastefully decorated with <span style="color: #ff0000;">fayenee</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Upstairs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
</span>the hall of an elementary school, commanding a striking retrospect<br/>
of the busy street, with the three red and white mosques and their<br/>
minarets to the right. To the left is the huge <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade </span>of the palace<br/>
