<span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assiat</span>. TELL <span style="color: #0000FF;">EL-'AMARNA</span>. 18. Route. 205<br/>
<br/>
The Tombs of Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'Amarna </span>are essentially the same in point of<br/>
structure as the tombs of the 18th Dyn. <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Thebes (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">287</span>). Each is immediately <span style="color: #0000FF;">preceded </span>by a Fore Court, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was originally surrounded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>brick wall. Thence a wide door admits to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Main </span>Chamber, hewn in the<br/>
rock, and in many cases with columns <span style="color: #0000FF;">supporting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">roof</span>. The Chamber<br/>
containing the statue of the deceased is next reached, either by another<br/>
door, or by a corridor, passing between two other apartments. Many of<br/>
the tombs are unfinished, in consequence of the early death of Amenophis IV. and the subsequent return of the court to Thebes. - The tombs<br/>
(in both groups) are marked <span style="color: #ff0000;">withhlack </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">numbers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">6-25</span>), running from N, to S.<br/>
<br/>
TOMB 1 belonged to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Buyii</span>, superintendent of the royal harem<br/>
and steward to the queen-mother. In the entrance is the deceased<br/>
praying. The MAIN CHAMBER has two clustered columns, of which,<br/>
however, only that on the left side is standing. Entrance Wall. To<br/>
the right are the king and queen seated at table, below the queen<br/>
are two princesses facing each other, to the right are guards, etc.<br/>
Here, as in all similar representations in the tombs at Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">e1'Amarna</span>, the sun appears above the royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">couple</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">rays </span>ending<br/>
in hands. Below are <span style="color: #0000FF;">musicians</span>, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">banquet-table</span>, bowing servants,<br/>
soldiers, etc. Right End Wall. The temple of the sun is represented<br/>
with the chief altar in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>court and statues; <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the right<br/>
the king leads his mother to her palace, escorted by guards (behind<br/>
and below); above is the sun with the rays ending in hands (see<br/>
above). Rear Wall. This is occupied, on each side of the door, by<br/>
two companion scenes (much injured), showing the king on the<br/>
balcony of the palace. Left <span style="color: #0000FF;">End </span>Wall. The king is being carried in<br/>
a litter to the temple of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">right</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanied </span>by a large<br/>
retinue. Entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wall</span>. To the left, a scene resembling that to the<br/>
right (see above). - <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">both </span>walls of the door to the next room the<br/>
deceased appears in prayer. The following Chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished</span>)<br/>
contains the mummy-shaft, surrounded by a parapet hewn in the<br/>
solid rock. - In the LAST CHAMBER (<span style="color: #ff0000;">serdib</span>; p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">cxliv</span>) is a recess<br/>
with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eolossal </span>seated figure of the deceased, the features of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>have been defaced. On the walls are <span style="color: #0000FF;">mourners</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">-men </span>with <span style="color: #ff0000;">saeritieial<br/>
</span>gifts, a carriage, chairs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
TOMB 2, whose owner is unknown, deserves special attention<br/>
because its construction was still going on under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakere</span>, the sonin-law and <span style="color: #0000FF;">successor </span>of Amenophis IV. The Main Chamber has two<br/>
columns; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-chambers </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished</span>. Among the representations in the former the following may be mentioned. Entrance Wall.<br/>
To the left is the king seated under a <span style="color: #0000FF;">canopy </span>holding the stem of a<br/>
goblet, Which the queen is <span style="color: #ff0000;">tilliug </span>with water; adjacent stand three<br/>
princesses. To the right, the king, in a balcony of the palace, is<br/>
handing down golden ornaments to a woman and a man; behind<br/>
the balcony (<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the right) are the royal chariot and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fan-bearers</span>;<br/>
below, servants with food and drink. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Right </span>Wall<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The king seated<br/>
upon a chair in his palace; interesting representations of wrestlers;<br/>
Libyans <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Syrians bringing tribute.<br/>
<br/>
The other tombs lie 3/4 M. to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.E.</span>, in another <span style="color: #0000FF;">hill-slope</span>.<br/>
