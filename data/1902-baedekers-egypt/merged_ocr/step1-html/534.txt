<br/>
worthy of that honour. Farther on this path turned off at right<br/>
angles to the S. and led to the entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
Great Festal Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>111. We first enter a small<br/>
chamber in which two sixteen-sided columns are still standing,<br/>
and pass thence through another chamber with one column, and a<br/>
vestibule, into the Great <span style="color: #ff0000;">chtal </span>Hall. This has three aisles and is<br/>
144 ft. wide and <span style="color: #0000FF;">32 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t't</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>deep. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>supported by 20 columns<br/>
in two rows, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">32 </span>square pillars. The peculiar shape of the columns here is quite unique; the shafts taper downwards, and the<br/>
capitals are in the form of inverted calyces, the petals of which<br/>
point downwards. The pillars, though not so tall as the columns,<br/>
were of the same height as the walls, and with the latter supported<br/>
the roofing slabs of the side-aisles. The roof of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lot'tier </span>central<br/>
aisle was supported partly by the columns and partly by small<br/>
pillars with an <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave </span>rising from the roof above the pillars to<br/>
the height of the columns. The reliefs on the pillars show Thutmosis III. in presence of the gods.<br/>
<br/>
The rooms adjoining the festal hall, several of which are in ruins,<br/>
were adorned with <span style="color: #ff0000;">reliels </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lil</span>. A door in the partly ruined<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>leads E. to the SANCTUARY, which included<br/>
three <span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers</span>. Only the lower part of its walls is <span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">left</span>. Adjoining,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the N., is a SMALL ROOM, with its <span style="color: #ff0000;">roof </span>supported by <span style="color: #0000FF;">k </span>clustered <span style="color: #ff0000;">papyruscolumns </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>bud-capitals (still in good preservation); on the lower part<br/>
of the wall are <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>of the plants and animals brought <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
</span>Syria to Egypt by Thutmosis III. in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>25th year of his reign. - To the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>is the ALEXANDER <span style="color: #0000FF;">ROOM</span>, built by Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>and restored by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>der the Great. The reliefs show Alexander (or in a few isolated cases<br/>
Thutmosis), <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gods</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>Farther on is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>HALL, with 8 <span style="color: #ff0000;">sixteensided </span>columns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>are still erect, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">beyond </span>that runs a <span style="color: #ff0000;">CORRIDnn</span>, opening off which are two small rooms with columns and seven other<br/>
chambers, with reliefs <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis<br/>
<br/>
</span>In the above-mentioned chamber with <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>column was found the<br/>
famous <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kama</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>: Table of the Kings, a list of the Egyptian monarchs from<br/>
the earliest times down to the 18th Dyn. (now in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bibliothisque </span>Nationale in Paris).<br/>
<br/>
The central and E. portions of the Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>(from<br/>
Pylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>onwards) were surrounded by a GIRDLE <span style="color: #0000FF;">WALL</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">extent </span>remains of which are covered with reliefs of Ramses II. <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to the gods. Close behind the wall Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>built a Colonnade (now completely <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruined</span>), embellished with Osiris-statues, and<br/>
connected with a Small Temple (ruins uninteresting), built by the<br/>
same king.<br/>
<br/>
Still farther to the E. is a well-preserved ancient Gateway, <span style="color: #ff0000;">02 </span>ft.<br/>
in height, which was the E. entrance to the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon</span>, and<br/>
lay <span style="color: #ff0000;">MO </span>yds. distant from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W.</span>) pylon. It was built by one<br/>
of the Ptolemies.<br/>
<br/>
If we turn to the right (<span style="color: #ff0000;">8</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>) outside the gateway, we soon reach a small<br/>
building <span style="color: #0000FF;">bearing </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>and Ramses IV. - To the<br/>
N. of the gateway lies a small Temple of Osiris, dedicated <span style="color: #0000FF;">hy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenertais</span>,<br/>
sister of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shabako </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>. (25th Dyn.) and mother-in-law of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psammetikh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hear </span>it are several small chapels <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the same period <span style="color: #0000FF;">C26'th </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dyn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">J</span>.<br/>
