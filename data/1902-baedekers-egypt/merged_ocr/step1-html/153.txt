Ptolemies that attention was once more directed to the S. These<br/>
monarchs raised many large temples to the gods of the country<br/>
usually on the site of earlier ruined buildings. All these temples<br/>
are built on one uniform plan<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">differing </span>but slightly from the form<br/>
prevalent under the New Empire (comp. the plan of the temple at<br/>
Edfu with that of the Ramesseum). There is a difference in only<br/>
two essential points. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>(or terrace) at the back of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">colonuaded </span>court of the earlier temples has developed into a larger<br/>
Vestibule or Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hypostyle </span>Hall, supported by columns, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>an example had already occurred in the temple of Luxor. The<br/>
columns of the front row are united with each other by means <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>Screen Walls or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Balustrade</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>(over 6 ft. in height) <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>separate<br/>
the court from this <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vestibule </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall</span>, called by the Greeks <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pronaos</span>. Furthermore the Sanctuary, which formerly had a door at each<br/>
end, is now closed at the back and retains only the front entrance.<br/>
Between the vestibule and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary </span>a lesser hypostyle hall and<br/>
two smaller halls are placed, an arrangement, however, which also<br/>
occurs under the New Empire. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-rooms </span>are also numerous<br/>
at this period and among these special mention must be made of a<br/>
small <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mrcrifciat </span>Court situated on the right side (see plan of Edfu,<br/>
p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">314 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>and an elegant Kiosk adjoining it <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oo</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>do not occur<br/>
in any of the older <span style="color: #ff0000;">templesi</span>.<br/>
<br/>
From a very early period all flat surfaces on pylons, interior<br/>
walls, <span style="color: #0000FF;">column-shafts</span>, and ceilings were covered with representations and inscriptions. The external walls, the pylons, and the<br/>
walls of the courts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. those parts of the temple that were exposed to the vulgar eye, commemorated the exploits of the king,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">campaigns</span>, great festivals, or other important events of his reign;<br/>
the representations were intended to keep the power and <span style="color: #0000FF;">nobility<br/>
</span>of the Pharaoh constantly before his people. On the other hand the<br/>
representations in the interior of the temple were exclusively<br/>
devoted to the religious proceedings that took place there. The<br/>
king, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>theoretically was the only mortal <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>might have intercourse with the gods, appears again and again, offering gifts and<br/>
homage to the deities and receiving from them earthly blessings.<br/>
In the late period and especially under the Ptolemies the secular<br/>
representations on the external walls and the walls of the court gave<br/>
place to religious scenes. The variegated battle-scenes of the New<br/>
Empire no longer appear on the pylons, but the typical figure of the<br/>
Pharaoh smiting his enemies in presence of the god; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the<br/>
external walls the <span style="color: #0000FF;">battle-scenes </span>and triumphs of the ruler give place<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">saerifieial </span>and other sacred scenes depicted at tedious length. The temple, moreover, like his house and his tomb, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>in the eyes<br/>
of the Egyptian a type in small of the world. The roof corresponded<br/>

court in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>temples.<br/>
