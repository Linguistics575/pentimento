<span>110 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Route </span>7. SPRING OF MOSES. Environs<br/>
<br/>
This hill stands at the mouth of the narrow, winding valley,'h M.<br/>
in length, through which the path to the Spring of Moses ascends<br/>
over large blocks of stone and rubble. The ravine terminates in a<br/>
lofty amphitheatre of rock. Here is a cleft in the rock from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>trickle a few drops of bitter and brackish water, quite arbitrarily<br/>
named the Spring <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Moses <span style="color: #0000FF;">fAin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Maw</span>). The chief attractions of<br/>
the gorge consist in the numerous desert plants and the fossils it<br/>
contains and in the sense of perfect solitude which it conveys.<br/>
<br/>
In order to reach the smaller Petrified Forest, we return to the<br/>
mouth of the gorge and proceed towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE.</span>, skirting the<br/>
slopes of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam</span>, which are here more precipitous. We first<br/>
pass a black projecting rock, which has a glazed appearance, and<br/>
then a square gap in the rock, beyond which we observe opposite<br/>
to us gently sloping hills, consisting of limestone, marl, and beds<br/>
of fossil oysters. The route ascends, a little to the right, between<br/>
these hills, and soon reaches the plateau of the Gebel el-Khashab,<br/>
where the scattered fragments of fossil wood indicate the beginning of the Little <span style="color: #0000FF;">Petrified </span>Forest. Almost all these trunks and<br/>
fragments have been referred by Unger to an extinct tree, which he<br/>
named the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nicolia </span>Egyptiaca and regarded as akin to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bombacem</span>.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">petrifaction </span>is now generally supposed to have occurred during<br/>
the later tertiary period under the action of <span style="color: #0000FF;">silicious </span>geysers, such<br/>
as are to be seen <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>in the Yellowstone Park of North America.<br/>
The silicated trunks lie in a secondary stratum, the overlying strata<br/>
in which they were originally embedded having disappeared in the<br/>
course of the desert denudation.<br/>
<br/>
Crossing the plateau of the Petrified Forest for about 20 min.<br/>
more towards the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s.</span>, we suddenly reach the S. slopes of the Mokattam, through a gap in which a path descends into the Wadi <span style="color: #ff0000;">etTth</span>, or'valley of <span style="color: #ff0000;">wanderings</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>(more correctly <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Digta</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>This<br/>
valley stretches to the W.N.W. towards the valley of the Nile, and<br/>
begins <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the hills of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gharaht1n</span>, like the parallel <span style="color: #0000FF;">With</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hof </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p.155</span>),<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">debouches </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the N. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helwan</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the S. horizon rise the<br/>
hills of Tuna (p. 155), recognisable by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">old </span>fortress on their right<br/>
spur and by two heights exactly opposite to us, of which that to the<br/>
left somewhat resembles a <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoffin </span>in shape, while that to the right<br/>
is hemispherical. Crossing the bottom of the valley in this direction<br/>
(8.), we perceive in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tune </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hills </span>the entrance to a desert gorge,<br/>
bounded by lofty and precipitous slopes. This valley extends for<br/>
many miles in various windings, communicates with the ravines<br/>
of the desert which begin in the Gebel Hof near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wlwtrn</span>, and is<br/>
abundantly stocked with the plants peculiar to the desert.<br/>
<br/>
We may return to Cairo from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Little </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Petrified </span>Forest <span style="color: #0000FF;">through<br/>
</span>the'Valley of Wanderings', skirting the S. and W. slopes of the<br/>
Mokattam, and passing the Tombs of the Mamelukes. Another interesting return-route leads across the Mokattam hills. If we <span style="color: #0000FF;">cheese<br/>
</span>the latter we quit the Petrified Forest by a hollow to the S.W., and<br/>
<br/>
