<span>ARABIC LANGUAGE. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxix<br/>
<br/>
</span>Nile differs considerably in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>pronunciation of the consonants,<br/>
vocalisation, and accent from the ordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabic </span>dialects of Syria<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">elsewhere</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thus </span>the letter a is pronounced hard in Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>soft in Syria <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxx</span>). The variations, however, are not<br/>
so great as to prevent the Syrians and Egyptians being mutually<br/>
intelligible. There are, moreover, variations in the dialects spoken<br/>
in Egypt; the Arabic of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>is different from that spoken in<br/>
the towns. The following remarks apply <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>to the language<br/>
as spoken in Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The pronunciation of the vowels is apparently liable to variation:<br/>
thus besides the more correct Mimbar the form <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mamtar </span>is also used;<br/>
besides <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maiden</span>, both <span style="color: #0000FF;">MÃ©dan </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mtdtm </span>are heard. A sharply defined<br/>
and exact pronunciation of the consonants is characteristic of Arabic<br/>
and is absolutely essential to any satisfactory use of the language.<br/>
The learner should endeavour at once to master the pronunciation<br/>
<br/>
of the more <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>Arabic consonants, such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">6</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.b</span>, E,<br/>
<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">D</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, so as, for example, to be able to make a distinct difference<br/>
between <span style="color: #0000FF;">bitt </span>(house) and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bty </span>(eggs). Many of the sounds have no<br/>
representatives in English.<br/>
<br/>
The Arabic alphabet was developed from that of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nahatmans</span>,<br/>
who in turn adopted their written characters from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palmyrenes</span>.<br/>
In spite of its external attractions, it is one of the most imperfect<br/>
in existence. In written or printed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabic </span>the short vowels are<br/>
usually omitted and have to be supplied by the reader, a feat which<br/>
demands considerable skill and experience. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran</span>, however,<br/>
the vowels are all indicated by appropriate signs.<br/>
<br/>
Owing to the increasing <span style="color: #0000FF;">intercourse </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>the native Egyptians<br/>
and Europe, the former have of late adopted many words from other<br/>
languages, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>from Italian, French, and English. Many Arabic<br/>
words have, moreover, long since been replaced by Turkish equivalents. The Egyptian dialect also contains some Coptic or ancient<br/>
Egyptian words. Very few Europeans learn to pronounce Arabic<br/>
accurately, even after a residence of many years in the country.<br/>
<br/>
On p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxx </span>we give the Arabic Alphabet, with the sounds<br/>
corresponding to the different letters so far as it is possible to <span style="color: #0000FF;">represent </span>or describe them to the English reader.<br/>
