<br/>
the left, stands the small TEMPLE <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>SETHOS H., built of grey sandstone, except beside the three doors, where a reddish quartzose<br/>
sandstone has been used. The temple has three chapels, of which<br/>
that in the centre, dedicated to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ammoil</span>, and that on the left, <span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicated </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hut</span>, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>with rubbish. The third (right) chapel is<br/>
that of Khons; on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span>the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices </span>to the boat of Khons,<br/>
which is decorated with hawks' heads, and appears before Ammon,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mat</span>, and Khons.<br/>
<br/>
Farther on, in the central axis of the court, are two large<br/>
Pedestals for statues (that on the right retains its base only). Behind<br/>
was a Colonnaded Structure; of the original ten columns there still<br/>
stand five broken shafts <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the left side, and one complete column<br/>
(with calyx-capital and abacus) on the right. This structure had<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">door </span>on each of its four sides; in front of the W. door is a recumbent <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sphinx</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the complete column <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pgarnrnetikh </span>IL, of the 26th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dym</span>, has placed<br/>
his name over that of the Ethiopian Taharka, of the 25th Dyn.; beside<br/>
it is the name of Ptolemy IV. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philopator</span>, which also appears on the<br/>
abacus. The shaft is composed of 36 <span style="color: #0000FF;">courses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">carefully </span>hewn stone, the<br/>
capital of 5 courses. The height is 69 ft.; the greatest breadth of the<br/>
capital 16 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span>, the circumference at the top <span style="color: #ff0000;">49 </span>ft. The columns were united<br/>
by means of <span style="color: #0000FF;">balustrades</span>, dating from the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">PhilopatOr</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A door in the N. walk of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>surrounding the great court<br/>
leads out of the temple. In its vicinity are a number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Krio-Sphinxes<br/>
</span>placed close together, which were stored here in antiquity.<br/>
<br/>
To the right, facing the great court, is the TEMPLE <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>RAMSES <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>,<br/>
which was exhumed and cleared <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rubbish </span>in 1896-97 by the public<br/>
department in charge <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>antiquities. It is dedicated to Amman,<br/>
and is perhaps the best extant specimen of a simple Egyptian<br/>
temple, built throughout on a single homogeneous plan<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Its total<br/>
length is 170 ft.<br/>
<br/>
The Pylon with the entrance-door is much injured, especially at<br/>
the top. On the exterior of the left tower (E.) Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, wearing<br/>
the double crown, holds a band of prisoners by the hair and raises<br/>
his club for a blow. Ammon, standing in front of him, hands him<br/>
the sword of victory, and delivers to him chained together the <span style="color: #0000FF;">representatives </span>of the vanquished peoples, who appear in three rows.<br/>
In the two upper rows are the conquered nations of the south, in<br/>
the third row those of the north. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the right wing are similar<br/>
representations, the king here wearing the crown of Lower Egypt.<br/>
In the doorway, Ramses 111. receives from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>the symbol of<br/>
life, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the pylon is an open Court, surrounded on three sides<br/>
by covered passages. The roofs of the passages at the sides are each<br/>
supported by eight Osiris-pillars (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">cxxxiii</span>), while on the terrace<br/>
at the back are four similar pillars and four columns with <span style="color: #ff0000;">budcapitals</span>. The pillars are united by balustrades adorned with<br/>
reliefs<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the side of the W. pylon-tower facing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">court </span>is a representation<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">OfIRamses </span>III. receiving from a throned <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>the hieroglyphic <span style="color: #0000FF;">for<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
