To the right and left lie two oblong chambers. At the back are<br/>
three chapels, the central and largest of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>the SANCTUARY<br/>
(P1. D). On the walls of this chamber are reliefs. 0n the left wall<br/>
Ramses presents flowers to the boat of Ptah; on the right wall, the<br/>
king before the boat of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>. In the centre of the Sanctuary<br/>
is a pedestal, wrought out of the rock, for the sacred boat. At the<br/>
back is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">recess </span>with four seated figures, representing (from left<br/>
to right) Ptah, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">deiiltyi1 </span>Ramses, Ptah-Tatenen, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>with<br/>
the cow's head.<br/>

Above <span style="color: #ff0000;">Girsheh </span>the scenery relapses <span style="color: #0000FF;">into </span>monotony. - 29 M.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Koshtamneh</span>, a commune on both banks. On the E. bank rises the<br/>
Gebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hayati</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the W. bank is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">brick-built </span>fortress of the Middle<br/>
Empire, known to the natives as Kuri. Extensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">sand-banks </span>and<br/>
granite rocks interrupt the course of the river.<br/>
<br/>
35 <span style="color: #ff0000;">M.'Alcilti</span>, on the E. bank, and Dakkeh, on the W. bank.<br/>
Dakkeh is the ancient Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Per-Selkeft</span>),'House of Selket', the<br/>
Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pselchis</span>, near which the Roman general Petronius defeated<br/>
the Ethiopians in 23 A.D., on his campaign to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Napata</span>. We proceed<br/>
to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.</span>, through the miserable mud-huts of the village, and in a<br/>
few minutes reach the<br/>
Temple of Dakkeh, which has been much damaged within the<br/>
last few years. The present temple (comp. the Plan, p. 362) <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupies </span>the site of an earlier shrine, probably of the New Empire, and<br/>
was dedicated to Thout of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pnubs</span>, an <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ethiopian </span>town. By the<br/>
Greeks this god was called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Paotnuphis</span>. The most ancient part of<br/>
the building dates from the time of the Ethiopian king Ergamenes<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. D) and his contemporary <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philopator </span>(P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span>). Euergetes II,<br/>
added a vestibule (P1. B), and the temple received its <span style="color: #0000FF;">final </span>form<br/>
under the Roman emperors by the addition of the Sanctuary (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PLE</span>)<br/>
and of the Pylon (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. A). The temple, situated in the desert, lies<br/>
with its main axis parallel to the river (<span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span>. running N. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">so</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">contrary </span>to the usual rule in Nubian temples. It stands upon a base<br/>
about 6 ft. in height, now completely exposed by the natives in the<br/>
course of their excavations for <span style="color: #ff0000;">sebbikh </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ii</span>).<br/>
<br/>
A broad path, still flanked on either side by a single course of<br/>
blocks of masonry, leads to the well-preserved PYLON (Pl. A), which<br/>
stood in the outer girdle-wall and formed the entrance to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">templeprecincts</span>. Each <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylon-tower </span>has a groove for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flagstaff</span>; and both<br/>
have <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">few </span>isolated reliefs on the outside and numerous inscriptions,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>Greek, though some, added by visitors to the temple, are<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Demotie </span>and Meroi'tic. Within the central gateway, on the left side,<br/>
is the king making offerings to Thout, Tefnut, and Hathor, while<br/>
<br/>
Isis appears below.<br/>
<br/>
The ASCENT <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>PYLON is attractive. In each tower there is a<br/>
staircase, beginning in a guard-room at the foot and passing three other<br/>
rooms in the successive stories. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the platform at the top of the W.<br/>
tower are numerous inscriptions written by visitors and <span style="color: #0000FF;">also </span>carved <span style="color: #0000FF;">re<br/>
