Horus, before <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hather </span>and Horus,'Uniter of the two lands', and before other gods of Edfu. On the front of the pylon-towers are four<br/>
wide incisions, two on each side of the central portal. These were<br/>
intended to support large <span style="color: #ff0000;">tlag-staffs</span>, which were farther secured<br/>
by means of clamps fastened in the holes still to be seen in the<br/>
masonry directly above. The small rectangular apertures in the<br/>
towers served to admit light and air to the chambers and staircases<br/>
within (see below).<br/>
<br/>
A passage, <span style="color: #0000FF;">6-6 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n. </span>in height, leads, through each <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylon-tower </span>to the<br/>
outside of the stone girdle-wall, which is embellished with colossal reliefs<br/>
(Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">XI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>before the gods of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edfu</span>) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">bears </span>the inscriptions mentioned<br/>
at p. 315. In front of the W. tower lie two <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>hawks in dark<br/>
granite. One is <span style="color: #0000FF;">quite </span>shattered; the other has the figure of a priest in<br/>
<br/>
the costume of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>cent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span>. before it, and bore a crown fastened in<br/>

The Court, between the pylon and the great hypostyle hall, is<br/>
a spacious <span style="color: #0000FF;">enclosure</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>paved with broad flags, and surrounded on<br/>
three sides by a covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>of 32 columns. In this court rose<br/>
the great altar upon which offerings were made to the gods of Edfu<br/>
in presence of the assembled people. The columns supporting the<br/>
roof of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>are embellished with rich floral and palm<br/>
capitals<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The incised reliefs on the shafts show the king before<br/>
Horus and the other gods of Edfu; the name of the king has not<br/>
been inserted in the inscriptions. On the rear-walls of the colonnades are three rows <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>reliefs, showing the Pharaoh (Ptolemy<br/>
Soter II. or Ptolemy Alexander) in communion with the gods or<br/>
triumphing over his foes in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>guise of the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>. The same<br/>
representations occur over and over again in wearisome repetition<br/>
throughout the temple.<br/>
<br/>
On the S. wall (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. a), <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the left of the entrance: <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. The king, wearing the crown of Lower Egypt, quits his palace in order to visit the<br/>
temple; a priest offers incense in front of him. 2 Horus and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thout</span>, at<br/>
the entrance to the temple, pour the water of consecration <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>the king<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>- These scenes are repeated to the right of the entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. b), where,<br/>
however, the king wears the crown of Upper <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
<br/>
</span>The doors to the right and left of a and b lead to the staircases<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">interior </span>of the pylon (ascent, see p. 318). The E. and W.<br/>
exits (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">c</span>) are built up.<br/>
<br/>
The Back of this court is formed by the front of the great hypostyle hall, which is crowned by a concave cornice. On each side of<br/>
the large portal are three balustrades between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span>. Upon<br/>
these, facing the court, are reliefs representing Euergetes II. with<br/>
pendent arms or offering <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>to Hathor of Dendera (on the two<br/>
central balustrades) 01' to the hawk-headed Horus of Edfu (on the<br/>
others).<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vestibule</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pronaos</span>, has 12 columns with elaborate<br/>
floral capitals. The ceiling is covered with astronomical representations, <span style="color: #ff0000;">110w </span>blackened beyond recognition. On the walls are four<br/>
rows <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>incised reliefs, showing Euergetes <span style="color: #ff0000;">saerifieing </span>to the gods<br/>
and performing other religious rites, such as the ceremonies at<br/>
