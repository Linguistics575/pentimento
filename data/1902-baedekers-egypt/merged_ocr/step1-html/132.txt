<br/>
</span>she collected the fragments, and wherever one had been found<br/>
erected a monument on the spot to its memory; and this accounts<br/>
for the numerous tombs of Osiris mentioned as existing in Egypt<br/>
and elsewhere. When Horus grew up he <span style="color: #0000FF;">set </span>out to avenge his<br/>
father's murder, and after terrible contests was at last victorious.<br/>
According to other accounts the combatants were separated by<br/>
Thout, who assigned the S. of Egypt to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns </span>and the N. to Set.<br/>
Osiris was afterwards magically restored to life by Horus and continued to rule the W. land as king of the dead.<br/>
<br/>
The origin of the world, the movements of the heavenly bodies,<br/>
and the alternation of day and night awoke speculation in Egypt at<br/>
a very early date, the result of which was a naive belief that the<br/>
world was created by supernatural beings, who revealed themselves<br/>
in the heavenly bodies and controlled the processes of nature.<br/>
According to a wide-spread belief the earth was a god named Keb,<br/>
the sky a goddess named Newt. Originally these were united, but<br/>
they were afterwards separated by the god Show, who raised the<br/>
sky-goddess aloft in his arms. Another and more materialistic view<br/>
regarded the earth as a huge oval plain, <span style="color: #0000FF;">floating </span>upon the ocean,<br/>
and the sky as a flat slab resting upon the mountains at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">extrem</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>ities of the earth, with the stars hanging from it like lamps. The<br/>
Sun, the principal heavenly body, was in particular the subject ot<br/>
many theories, probably representing the teachings of the different<br/>
colleges of priests throughout the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span>In one place the sun<br/>
god RE was conceived of as sailing across the ocean of heaven in a<br/>
boat; in another the sun was regarded as a brilliantly plumaged<br/>
hawk <span style="color: #0000FF;">flying </span>across the <span style="color: #0000FF;">firmament </span>and driving away the hostile<br/>
clouds; and in a third the sun was a powerful young hero, <span style="color: #0000FF;">newborn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">every </span>morning from the goddess of the sky, and waging a<br/>
ceaseless combat with the powers of darkness. It was also <span style="color: #0000FF;">conceived </span>of under the form of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarabaeus </span>or beetle. The myth of RF,<br/>
seems to have been chiefly developed in Heliopolis, where the sun<br/>
god <span style="color: #ff0000;">RÃ©-Harmaehis </span>was worshipped along with the local deity<br/>
Atum. Orion and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sothis </span>played the leading <span style="color: #0000FF;">roles </span>among the stars;<br/>
and among the other powers of nature a prominent place was filled<br/>
by the Nile God, to whom indeed the country owed its prosperity.<br/>
All these deities received general worship, though none of them<br/>
had particular temples of their own.<br/>
<br/>
When Egypt became a single state, there seems to have been<br/>
felt the need of a deity who should be common to the whole country<br/>
and should be worshipped in all places without reference to the<br/>
local gods. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">RE </span>was selected as the national deity,<br/>
doubtless owing to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">induenee </span>of the priests of Heliopolis. The<br/>
king was regarded as his representative and successor upon earth<br/>
and was therefore styled'Son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">my </span>or'Horus', Horus being <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently </span>regarded as the son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">RE</span>. The coronation ceremonies seem<br/>
to have been completed by the proclamation of the accession in the<br/>
