<br/>
In spite of the numerous religious inscriptions and representations that have come down to us from Egyptian antiquity our<br/>
knowledge of the Egyptian religion is comparatively slight. We are<br/>
indeed acquainted with the names and aspects of many deities and<br/>
we know in what temples they were worshipped, but of the true<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">essence </span>of these deities, of the particular <span style="color: #ff0000;">signitieanee </span>attributed to<br/>
them by priests and people, of the myths attached to the personality<br/>
of each, we know very little. One thing, however, is certain; vis.<br/>
that the Egyptian religion was developed in prehistoric times in<br/>
separate and independent communities. Each town, each village,<br/>
each hamlet had its <span style="color: #0000FF;">own </span>god, its own patron deity, to whom the inhabitants prayed when need or danger threatened, whose favour<br/>
they courted with gifts, and whose anger they sought to avert with<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">saeriilees</span>. The names of these local deities and the aspects assigned<br/>
to them by their various worshippers <span style="color: #0000FF;">differentiate </span>them very markedly. The god of the region of the cataracts, for example, was<br/>
named Khnum, the god of Thebes <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span>or Ammon, and the god of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis </span>Atum. Frequently they possessed no special name, but<br/>
were distinguished only in terms of the town where their worship<br/>
was celebrated, as, e.g., He of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombos</span>, She of <span style="color: #0000FF;">East </span>{ <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis </span>}, etc.<br/>
The actual form also of the deity was affected by the character of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>town and his worshippers. A locality in which the manufacture<br/>
of pottery was the chief industry represented its god as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">great</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>potter, who had formed the entire world out of clay moulded on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">potter</span>'s wheel; in agricultural districts the deities were gods of<br/>
harvest; places inhabited by <span style="color: #0000FF;">fisherfolk </span>worshipped water-gods.<br/>
When a small town increased in power and extended its authority<br/>
over an entire district or province, the jurisdiction of its god was<br/>
likewise extended, and the'town god' became <span style="color: #0000FF;">a'provincial </span>god'.<br/>
It probably often happened also that the inhabitants of a certain<br/>
town emigrated to new settlements; in such cases they doubtless carried their deities with them and erected new temples to<br/>
them in the new home. Sometimes the effective protection and<br/>
abundant benefits bestowed on his worshippers by some local deity<br/>
might attract the attention of less fortunate neighbours and induce<br/>
them also to rear a temple for him and worship him. Thus in various<br/>
ways gods became known in towns to which they were not <span style="color: #0000FF;">indigenous </span>and obtained circles of worshippers side by side with the<br/>
purely local deities.<br/>
<br/>
The extended <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of local deities is, however, not always<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>explained by such merely external considerations. There can<br/>
be no doubt that the nation at the very earliest period had a certain<br/>
number of universally shared religious ideas and that certain super<br/>
