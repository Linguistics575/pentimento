he even took away all; and he took away all the shields of gold <span style="color: #0000FF;">Which<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Solomon </span>had made'. 2nd Chron. <span style="color: #0000FF;">KIL</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2-4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span>9:'And it <span style="color: #ff0000;">came </span>to pass<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>that, in the fifth year of Rehoboam, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shishak </span>king of Egypt <span style="color: #ff0000;">came </span>up<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">against </span>Jerusalem because they had transgressed against the Lord, With<br/>
twelve hundred <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chariots</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">threescore </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thousand </span>horsemen; and the<br/>
people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubim, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sukkiim</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the Ethiopians. And he took the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fenced </span>cities<br/>
which pertained <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Judah</span>, and came to Jerusalem'. Verse 9 is the same<br/>
as the above passage from Kings. Of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name-labels </span>only a few can be<br/>
identified with certainty with otherwise known names of places in Palestine, such as Rabbath (<span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span>ring of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fhrst </span>row), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taanach</span>, Shunem,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Rehob</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haphararm</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahanarm</span>, Gibeon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beth-Horon</span>, Kedemoth, Ajalon<br/>
(in the second row). Several symbols have recently been obliterated by<br/>
the whitewash used to preserve the wall, and some of the name-labels<br/>
have also been <span style="color: #0000FF;">destroyed</span>, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Megiddo </span>at the beginning of the third<br/>
row. The rest of the inscriptions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are couched in the usual <span style="color: #ff0000;">bombastie </span>style, give no farther information as to the campaign.<br/>
<br/>
We return to the great court and <span style="color: #0000FF;">proceed </span>to the Second Pylon of<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, which was built out of the materials of a temple of the<br/>
heretical period (comp. p. 237; isolated blocks <span style="color: #0000FF;">bear </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches<br/>
</span>of Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, Tut-enkh-Amon, and Eye). The left or N. tower<br/>
has fallen and the right or S. tower is sadly damaged. On the S. side<br/>
of the right tower <span style="color: #ff0000;">appears </span>Ramses II. defeating his foes in presence<br/>
of Ammon. In front of this pylon was a kind of small Vestibule,<br/>
the entrance to which was flanked by two statues of Ramses II. The<br/>
figure on the right side still stands and <span style="color: #0000FF;">displays </span>excellent workmanship; beside the left leg is a figure of the Princess Bent-Anat.<br/>
Only the legs of the other figure remain. In the doorway, where<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, Sethos <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, and Ramses II. are found, an<br/>
intervening door <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>erected by Ptolemy VI. Philometor and Ptolemy IX. Euergetes <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, during their joint reign. The lintel and<br/>
upper parts of this doorway are wanting, but the jambs are in good<br/>
preservation, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">eXpressions </span>of homage to Ammon and his <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellowgods</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the inner side (left) of the earlier <span style="color: #0000FF;">doorway</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>at the foot,<br/>
are the sacred boat of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>and the king entering the temple.<br/>
In the second row from the foot appears Ramses II. kneeling before<br/>
Ammon and receiving the symbol of <span style="color: #0000FF;">jubilee</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>indicative of long<br/>
reign. Behind stands the goddess Mut, while Khons, with the moon's<br/>
disk on his head, conducts Philometor to behold the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>.<br/>
Probably the representation is a restoration by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philometor </span>of an<br/>
older work on the same Spot. The other rows exhibit the king in<br/>
presence <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>various deities. - We next enter the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Great </span>Hypostyle <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ball</span>. This imposing hall may certainly<br/>
claim to rank among the wonders of the world. Many <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>columns<br/>
are prostrate, others lean as though on the verge of falling, and<br/>
architrave and roof-slabs have either fallen or seem on the point<br/>
of doing so. The indescribable effect produced by this enormous<br/>
structure is perhaps best appreciated if we place ourselves in the<br/>
wide doorway of the second pylon and look through the double row<br/>
of huge <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx-columns </span>towards the sanctuary, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tie</span>. towards the E.<br/>
The magic <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the place is fully felt in the morning or<br/>
<br/>
