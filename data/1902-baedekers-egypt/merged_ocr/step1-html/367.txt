<span>132 Route 9. MEMPHIS.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Camhyses</span>, the first monarch of the Persian dynasty<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>took the city by<br/>
storm after his victory at Pelusium <span style="color: #0000FF;">03.0</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">525</span>) over <span style="color: #ff0000;">Peammetikh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and<br/>
even after the foundation of Alexandria (<span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span>. 332) it still retained some<br/>
importance. Under Augustus it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a large and populous city, though<br/>
its palaces, elevated on an eminence, lay mined and deserted. Among<br/>
the temples that still existed were those of Ptah, of Apis (p. 135), and<br/>
of a female deity, who was <span style="color: #0000FF;">Identified </span>with the Aphrodite of the Greeks<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>In consequence of the edict of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theodosius </span>(A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">379-395</span>; comp. p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">xcii</span>)<br/>
the temples and statues were destroyed, and under the later Byzantine<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">menarche </span>the heretical <span style="color: #0000FF;">Monophysites </span>(p. xciii) seem to have been very<br/>
numerous here. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Muhauhis</span>, the leader of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ert3</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>established at<br/>
Memphis while negotiating with'Amr Ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-VAs</span>, the general of'Omar<br/>
(p. 32). The Mohammedan conquerors transferred their residence to the<br/>
right bank of the Nile, opposite the northernmost part of Memphis, using<br/>
the well-hewn blocks, which had once composed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">venerable </span>palaces<br/>
and temples of the ancient city of Menes, for the construction of their<br/>
palaces, castles, and mosques at Cairo. Memphis, however, was so vast,<br/>
that it was long before its <span style="color: #0000FF;">plunderers </span>succeeded in entirely destroying it.<br/>
Down to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>late period the ruins of Memphis excited the admiration of<br/>
all visitors. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thus'Abi1ellattf </span>(at the end of the 12th cent.) assures us<br/>
that even in his time the ruins contained a profusion of wonders <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>bewildered the mind and <span style="color: #0000FF;">baffled </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">description </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>After his time the rapidly<br/>
dwindling ruins <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Memphis are rarely mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
The path diverging to the left from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrash√©n </span>embankment,<br/>
and leading through the palm-grove to the village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hit </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rakineh</span>,<br/>
brings us to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Colossal </span>Statues of Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">11.</span>, which once<br/>
marked the entrance to the temple. The first of these, discovered<br/>
in 1888, is made of granite, and lies on its back on a slight eminence,<br/>
so that to see the face it is necessary to climb on to its breast. Its<br/>
length is 25 ft., not including the crown, which is 61/2 ft. in length.<br/>
<br/>
The square hole in the head of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossus </span>was for the insertion of<br/>
the crown, which now lies on the ground beside it. On both shoulders,<br/>
breast, girdle, and bracelet occurs the name of the king; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the<br/>
pillar at the back is an <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription</span>. On the left of the statue is an incised<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">relief </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Princess Bent-Anat. - A stele <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Apries </span>(26th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>) and the upper<br/>
part of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">double </span>statue of Ptah and Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">II</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">f</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>have also <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>found<br/>
on this spot<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rounded </span>pediment of the stele appear Ptah, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the<br/>
left, and the hawk-headed Sokaris, on the right.<br/>
<br/>
A few min. farther on we reach the mud-hut that conceals the<br/>
Second Colossus (adm. 4 <span style="color: #0000FF;">pies</span>. for those without <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>admission<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ticket</span>, see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">130</span>), discovered by Messrs. Caviglia and Sloane<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>116) in 1820. A wooden flight of steps ascends to a platform<br/>
from which the statue is inspected. It consists of remarkably hard<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine-grained </span>limestone, and before it was injured was about<br/>
42 ft. in height, corresponding to the measurement given by Herodotus (30 cubits of 11/2 ft. each). The workmanship is excellent.<br/>
The handsome and gentle features of the king are admirably reproduced. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A11 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">artihial </span>beard is attached to the chin. In the girdle<br/>
is a dagger adorned with two hawk's heads. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the right shoulder,<br/>
the breast, and the girdle appear the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pramomina </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>In front of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hut </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">several </span>fragments of monuments, showing<br/>
the name of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">To </span>the N. of the colossi, near the village that crowns the hill <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ham<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eZ-Khanzir</span>, are the foundations of a temple of Ptah, built by Ramses IL,<br/>
with representations of local deities.<br/>
