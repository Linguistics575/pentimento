<br/>
burned bricks of Nile mud; the roofs were made of slender wooden<br/>
beams, covered with straw <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>reeds and daubed within and without<br/>
with Nile mud; the columns were either of stone, of mud, or of<br/>
wood, and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">palaces </span>were inlaid with coloured stones or glass-paste<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Colour </span>was also extensively used in the interiors; the walls were<br/>
whitewashed and adorned with <span style="color: #0000FF;">bright-coloured </span>rugs or with paintings, and even the pavements were covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">colouring </span>matter.<br/>
<br/>
A considerable number of <span style="color: #ff0000;">FORTIFIBD </span>STRUCTURES have been<br/>
preserved. Amongst these may be mentioned the Nubian castles to<br/>
the S. <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofwadi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Halfa </span>and the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">castles </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">El-kin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ktnn<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Abmar</span>, the most of which probably date from the period of the<br/>
Middle Empire.<br/>
<br/>
As taxes and salaries were paid in kind, large MAGAZINES were<br/>
required for the reception of tribute, not only by the state but also<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">temples</span>. The remains of such storehouses have been found<br/>
beside the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilamesseum </span>(p. 287), at Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Maskhtlta </span>(p. 163), and<br/>
elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Probably in no other country have so many Temples within such<br/>
narrow limits survived from antiquity as in Egypt. Most of these,<br/>
it is true, date from the New Empire and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>epoch, so<br/>
that we have a clear conception of the temples of these periods only.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Few </span>or 110 complete temples have survived from the Ancient or<br/>
Middle Empires <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>from the late-Egyptian period.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Among </span>the TEMPLES <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE ANCIENT EMPIRE the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>is<br/>
held by the Sanctuary <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Sun at Abu <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gurib</span>, erected by King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ran-woser </span>(p. 129), and excavated in 1899 by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Borchardt </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Schaefer</span>.<br/>
This temple resembles those of later periods in having <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>interior<br/>
walls embellished with reliefs and inscriptions. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Practically </span>nothing<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">now </span>remains of the small Temples beside the second and third pyramids at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh</span>, where the <span style="color: #0000FF;">maues </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the kings buried in those pyramids were worshipped; but <span style="color: #0000FF;">Flinders </span>Petrie's discovery of the<br/>
Temple beside the pyramids of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meidt'tm </span>affords us a clear idea of<br/>
such a sanctuary at the earliest period (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">192</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. Here the walls are<br/>
absolutely bare and the architectural forms of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">severest </span>simplicity. It is very questionable whether, as was at one time supposed,<br/>
the Granite Temple, beside the great Sphinx (p.124), and the small<br/>
Temple, near the Birket <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kmart </span>(p. 181), really belong to the period<br/>
of the Ancient Empire.<br/>
<br/>
The remains of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">TEMPLES </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE MIDDLE EMPIRE are even<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">scantier</span>. Large sanctuaries, little inferior in size to those <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>later<br/>
times, <span style="color: #ff0000;">were </span>built <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>period at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luster</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kamak</span>, Koptos, Abydos,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Haw√©m </span>(the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sevcalled </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Labyrinth </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jllalh2n</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medinet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Fayiim</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>, Bubastis, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tunis</span>; but none has left <span style="color: #0000FF;">any </span>considerable<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">times </span>All probably fell into decay during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">troublous </span>times of<br/>
the Hyksos supremacy and were replaced under the 18th Dyn. by<br/>
new buildings, in which the materials of the earlier <span style="color: #ff0000;">ediilees </span>were<br/>
utilized as far as possible. Their inner walls were decorated, <span style="color: #0000FF;">us </span>in<br/>
