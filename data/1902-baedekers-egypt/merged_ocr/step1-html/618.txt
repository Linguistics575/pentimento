<br/>
</span>The narrow cultivable strip is tilled by peasants of a distinctly darker<br/>
complexion than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">felléthin </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebaid</span>. Both land and people<br/>
approach gradually nearer to the Nubian type.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the E. bank lies <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cm</span>. - At the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Miniha </span>(E. bank)<br/>
we enter the E. branch of the stream, which here forms the island<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ManpFipelt</span>, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>village of the same name.<br/>
<br/>
On a hill on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>bank and <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuous </span>from a considerable<br/>
distance appear the ruins of the beautiful temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kom </span>Ombo,<br/>
especially picturesque by the light of the full moon. The islands<br/>
opposite the E. bank were, perhaps, in former times united with the<br/>
mainland, or separated from it only by a narrow channel; but in the<br/>
course of centuries the Nile has gradually extended its channel<br/>
farther and farther to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>and during the 19th cent. alone <span style="color: #ff0000;">abont<br/>
</span>20 ft. have been washed away from the E. bank, along with a large<br/>
portion of the building. An embankment has been constructed to<br/>
prevent farther mischief.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">42 </span>M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kern </span>Ombo, the'Hill of Ombos', <span style="color: #0000FF;">lie </span>about 50 ft. above<br/>
the average surface-level of the Nile. The ancient Egyptian city<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombos </span>probably owes its foundation to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">strategic </span>importance of<br/>
its site, upon a hill commanding both the Nile and the routes from<br/>
Nubia to the Nile valley. Yet the town attained no great prosperity<br/>
until the Ptolemaic era, when it was converted from an ordinary<br/>
provincial town into the capital of the separate <span style="color: #0000FF;">nome </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ombites</span>.<br/>
It was at this era that the mighty temples were built, which excite<br/>
our admiration to-day; the earlier sanctuaries have left scarcely a<br/>
trace. Not content like other towns with one local deity, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombos<br/>
</span>possessed two chief gods - the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crocodile-headed </span>Sobk (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sukhos</span>)<br/>
and the hawk-headed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haroéris</span>. With the former were specially<br/>
associated Hathor and the youthful moon-god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khons-Hor</span>; with<br/>
the latter, the'Good Sister' (<span style="color: #ff0000;">T-seru-myfret</span>, a special form of Hathor) and the'Lord of Both <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lands</span>' (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P-neb-teui</span>). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins </span>of the<br/>
town, now buried in sand, lie in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span>. corner of the plateau.<br/>
In 1893 all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-build'urgs </span>in the S. part of the plateau were<br/>
cleared of rubbish and restored <span style="color: #0000FF;">under </span>the directions of De Morgan<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>A marble tablet on the right door to the great hypostyle hall (p. 325)<br/>
commemorates the fact. At the W. angle of the plateau is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dismantled </span>British fort.<br/>
<br/>
From the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place</span>, to the S. of the hill, a <span style="color: #ff0000;">road </span>skirts the<br/>
river-bank to a modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight </span>of steps, which ascends direct to the<br/>
principal entrance. Tickets of admission should not be forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
The temple-precincts were enclosed by a brick girdle-wall. The<br/>
entrance is formed by a massive Pylon, erected by Ptolemy Neos<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dionysos</span>. Only the right (E.) half is now standing, the other has<br/>
sunk in the river. The reliefs show <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neos </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dionysos </span>presenting various<br/>
offerings to the gods of Ombos. We now <span style="color: #ff0000;">betake </span>ourselves to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*Great </span>Temple of Sobk <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Baroéris</span>. This temple was built on<br/>
a uniform plan in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemaic </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">perior1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span>embellished with re<br/>
