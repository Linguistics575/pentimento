<br/>
</span>its monumental creations, of which scanty <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>only are now extant,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrian </span>sculpture was wonderfully <span style="color: #ff0000;">prolitie </span>in genre <span style="color: #0000FF;">compositions </span>and decorative carvings. The extant sculptures may he easily<br/>
divided into three classes according to their style. The first class<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">comprises </span>the works of native artists affected by Greek influence,<br/>
who adhere in general to the traditional canon, but display <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>purer<br/>
taste in the treatment of the face and in the attitude and modelling<br/>
of the figure. Thus the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statue of a Macedonian king <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>said<br/>
to he <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexander </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, which was found in the temple-precincts at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Karnak </span>and is now in the Museum of Gizeh, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">executed</span>, as regards<br/>
its general arrangement, in conformity with the ancient Egyptian<br/>
scheme of statues, while its <span style="color: #0000FF;">face </span>and hair <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>treated in a freer<br/>
manner. Two other specimens of this art are to be seen in the<br/>
vestibule to the innermost <span style="color: #ff0000;">tomb-ehamber </span>in the great tomb at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kthn<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">esh-Shulyifa </span>(p. 12); another is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>head of a Ptolemy,<br/>
treated in the Egyptian style (K. in Room <span style="color: #ff0000;">y </span>of the Museum at<br/>
Alexandria<span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The Egyptian sculptor of the portrait-statue of a native<br/>
scribe found at Alexandria (No. 294 in the Gizeh Museum, p. 90)<br/>
has gone still further. Not only has he <span style="color: #ff0000;">ahandoned </span>the crouching<br/>
posture traditional for such subjects, but he has also imitated as<br/>
closely as possible the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheek </span>style in the attitude, the shape of the<br/>
head, and the folds of the drapery; though at the same time the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stiffness </span>of the position, and still more the pillar at the back with its<br/>
hieroglyphic inscription, clearly announce the origin of the artist.<br/>
A smaller group of statues and reliefs are apparently the works of<br/>
Greek immigrants, who brought with them, and practised unchanged,<br/>
an art acquired abroad, and mainly inspired by Athenian ideals.<br/>
Examples of this Alexandrian'Ideal <span style="color: #0000FF;">Style</span>' are to be seen in the<br/>
splendid Head ofa Gaul in the Gizeh Museum (Room XL, No. 291),<br/>
which deviates considerably in style from the well-known realistic<br/>
Gauls' heads of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pergamenian </span>school; a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sepulehral </span>Stale in the<br/>
same Museum (Room XL, No. 289); the fine seated Statue of Hercules in the vestibule of the Alexandrian Museum; the Head of<br/>
Hercules (Case J, Room XVI), and numerous other specimens in<br/>
the same museum. A curious weakening of this ideal style, due to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span>material, appears in sculptures carved in limestone quarried<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meks </span>near Alexandria or in the shell-limestone of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam<br/>
</span>hills near Cairo. The most interesting specimen of this is a group<br/>
of a mourning woman and child in the Alexandria Museum (0;<br/>
Room IV). The most important achievement of this school was the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ahove-mentioned </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e0lossus </span>of Serapis in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>at Alexandria,<br/>
the work of a sculptor named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bryaris</span>, who seems to have <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>an<br/>
immigrant from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Carin</span>; and this may still be reconstructed in its<br/>
details with the help <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous </span>larger or smaller copies. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colossus </span>represented the mysterious deity sitting on a throne, with<br/>
Cerberus by his side, and crowned with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eorn-measure</span>, the emblem <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fruitfulness</span>. The grave countenance framed with flowing<br/>
