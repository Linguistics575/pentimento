<span>300 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Route </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">24</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">THEBES </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BANK</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">9</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Temples </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
</span>ornamented with horns. To the N. (Pl. f) the captured <span style="color: #0000FF;">Libyans </span>are<br/>
marshalled before the king. Above is a lengthy inscription <span style="color: #ff0000;">deseribing </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">victory</span>. The court is flanked on the right and left by<br/>
covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnades</span>. The ceiling of that to the right is borne by<br/>
seven square pillars, against which stand colossal statues of the<br/>
king as Osiris. The left (<span style="color: #ff0000;">8</span>.) <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>has eight papyrus columns<br/>
with <span style="color: #ff0000;">ealyx-eapita1s</span>. These last belonged to the facade of a royal<br/>
palace, which formerly stood to the S. of the temple and communicated with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>court by three doors and the large window<br/>
mentioned below. The scenes on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade-walls </span>represent<br/>
the wars, victories, and captives of the king At the end the king<br/>
is seen on his way to the feast of Ammon, attended by his fanbearers.<br/>
<br/>
The inscriptions and sculptures on the Second Pylon, bounding<br/>
the rear of the court, are still more interesting. 0n the Right Tower<br/>
(PLE) is a long <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">recording </span>the triumph won by the king in<br/>
the 8th year of <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reign </span>over a league of <span style="color: #0000FF;">peoples </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>Asia Minor, who<br/>
menaced Egypt by sea and by land from Syria. On the Left Tower<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. F) the king leads before Amman and Mut three rows of prisoners, representing the conquered in this campaign. These have<br/>
beardless faces and wear curious caps adorned with feathers; their<br/>
pointed aprons, decorated with tassels, differ from those of the<br/>
Egyptians. The inscription describes them as belonging to the tribes<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Danauna </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pulasta </span>(perhaps <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philistines'0</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The granite gateway of the second pylon, which is approached<br/>
by an inclined plane, admits us to the Second <span style="color: #0000FF;">Court</span>, Which is 125 ft.<br/>
long and 138 ft. broad. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the Christian period it was converted<br/>
into a church, the last remains of which were finally cleared away<br/>
in 1895. This court is almost an exact reproduction of the second<br/>
court of the Ramesseum, even to part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">relief-embellishment<br/>
</span>but it is in much better preservation. On all four sides are <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the N. and S. the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades </span>are supported by columns<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">bud-capitals</span>; on the E. are square pillars with Osiris-statues,<br/>
and on the W. is a terrace with eight Osiris-pillars in front and<br/>
eight columns behind. On the columns and pillars the king is<br/>
shown sacrificing to the gods. The reliefs on the back-walls of the<br/>
colonnades illustrate events in the life of Ramses, some showing<br/>
great festivals in which he took part, others the warlike deeds of<br/>
himself or his army. - <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnades</span>. In the upper row<br/>
are <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hkeno </span>from the Great Festival of the God Min, which was also<br/>
celebrated as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coronation-festival</span>, as we have seen in the Ramesseum (p. 286). First (Pl. 1) appears the Pharaoh, <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>from his<br/>
palace on a richly-decorated litter with a canopy. He is followed<br/>
by his sons (names wanting) and numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">courtiers</span>, while he is<br/>
preceded by priests carrying censers, a priest who recites, and a<br/>
troop of soldiers, each of whom wears two feathers on his head. The<br/>
trumpeter and drummer at the head of the line in the upper row,<br/>
