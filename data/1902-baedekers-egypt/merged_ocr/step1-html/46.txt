<span>Origin. THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. xxxv<br/>
<br/>
had their original home in Asia. At what period each hived <span style="color: #0000FF;">off<br/>
</span>from the original common stock is veiled in prehistoric darkness.<br/>
But it is clear that Asiatic <span style="color: #ff0000;">influemyes </span>must have affected the dwellers<br/>
on the Nile even before the introduction of the art of tillage, while<br/>
the valley of the Nile in Egypt was still populated by pastoral<br/>
races <span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>a conclusion based mainly on the origin of the domesticated<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ox </span>and of several other domestic animals. 0n the other hand the<br/>
original ancestor of the Egyptian domesticated ass was peculiar to<br/>
Africa, dwelling among the mountains and steppes to the S. of<br/>
Egypt. In this fact we <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>an indication of the route followed by<br/>
the Hamitic invaders of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The beginning of anything like a regular political development<br/>
in Egypt cannot be dated before the introduction of agriculture;<br/>
most probably it began with the cultivation of wheat and barley,<br/>
grains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>have been found among the remains in the most<br/>
ancient Egyptian tombs, dating from before the earliest dynasty.<br/>
The origin of both these cereals is <span style="color: #0000FF;">indisputably </span>Asiatic; their <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>home was in the valley of the Euphrates or in some more central<br/>
region of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pontiueut</span>. Besides these grains the funeral <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>under the earliest dynasties <span style="color: #0000FF;">included </span>also linen, wine, and<br/>
the produce of other cultivated plants, originally indigenous to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">w</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mia</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the earliest ideal conceptions of the proto-Egyptians<br/>
must also have been drawn from Asiatic sources, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, however,<br/>
in this case are to be looked for farther to the S. in that continent.<br/>
Not only the use of incense <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>also the sycamore and the persea,<br/>
the two sacred trees in the Egyptian Pantheon, were known in<br/>
Egypt from the very earliest period. But all these plants are <span style="color: #ff0000;">exolusively </span>indigenous to the mountainous regions of S. Arabia and<br/>
the adjoining coasts of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red </span>Sea; they could have been derived<br/>
from no other source. The use of incense is as ancient as the most<br/>
ancient known religion. The tree called by the Greeks persea, and<br/>
known to modern botanists as mimusops, flourished in the gardens<br/>
of ancient Egypt; and the sycamore, which is now nowhere found<br/>
in a wild state outside the regions mentioned above, is to be seen<br/>
all over Egypt at the present day.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up. The condition of the prehistoric dwellers in the<br/>
Egyptian Nile valley may be described as the result of a union between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">autochthonous </span>inhabitants and the Hamitic tribes <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>,<br/>
advancing from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red </span>Sea, entered the country from regions to<br/>
the S. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.E</span>. of Upper Egypt. After a long interval of time the<br/>
ancient dwellers on the Nile were subjected to new <span style="color: #ff0000;">m0difleati0ns</span>,<br/>
arising from the predatory attacks <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>race that had attained a higher<br/>
level of civilization. This latter race must have started from the<br/>
valley of Euphrates, otherwise it would not have been able to <span style="color: #ff0000;">introduoe </span>into Egypt, as it did, the knowledge of wheat and barley<br/>
and the art of cultivating them with the plough, the knowledge of<br/>
