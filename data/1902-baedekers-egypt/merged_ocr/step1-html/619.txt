<span>324 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">28. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s6rr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oMBO</span>. From Edfu<br/>
<br/>
liefs by Philometor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, and Neos Dionysos. The reliefs<br/>
in the court and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the outer walls, however, were added under the<br/>
Roman emperors, more especially under Tiberius. The Ptolemaic<br/>
reliefs are easily distinguished from those of the emperors, as they<br/>
are in low relief while the latter <span style="color: #0000FF;">are'en </span>creux'. In its general<br/>
arrangements the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombos </span>resembles other temples of the<br/>
same period (at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dendera</span>, Edfu, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>but it differs from<br/>
them in being dedicated to two deities instead of to one only. Each<br/>
of these two deities had his own special worship and festivals, so<br/>
the entire building is bisected longitudinally by an imaginary line,<br/>
each half having its own gateways, doorways, and chapels. The<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S.<br/>
</span>or right half was dedicated to Sobk, the N. or left half to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haroéris</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">PYLON</span>, at the entrance to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">temple-eourt</span>, had two doors.<br/>
The left half has completely vanished; while only the lower part <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the central pillar (between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">doors</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>and of the right wing remain.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the outer side <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>facing the river) of the right wing are the following representations, from left to right: Pl<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sobk</span>, Hathor, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">KhonsHor</span>, the gods worshipped in the right half of the temple. Pl. b. Hieroglyphic text. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>52 lines. <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>c. Emp. Domitian, with the crown of Upper<br/>
Egypt, accompanied by <span style="color: #0000FF;">LI </span>gods and goddesses, <span style="color: #ff0000;">oirering </span>gifts to the above<br/>
mentioned deities.<br/>
<br/>
At the corner to the right (above <span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. c) the upper row of <span style="color: #ff0000;">representations<br/>
</span>also has been preserved: six spirits (the last three with <span style="color: #0000FF;">jackals</span>' heads)<br/>
carrying a (defaced) shrine, followed by images of the gods <span style="color: #0000FF;">bearing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">symbols</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'life0 </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">C'hcppiness0 </span>on long poles; finally <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>large<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the king, preceded by a priest offering incense and followed by<br/>
his guardian spirit (with a king's <span style="color: #0000FF;">head </span>upon a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sceptre</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">COURT</span>, as at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edfu</span>, was surrounded on three sides by <span style="color: #ff0000;">colonHades</span>. Only the lower portions of the 16 columns are now left.<br/>
The reliefs on these, the colouring of which is in places admirably<br/>
preserved, represent Tiberius <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to the gods. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the inner<br/>
side of the right wing of the pylon are two doors, one of which<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. d) admits to a small apartment, the other (P1. e) leads to a<br/>
staircase by <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the roof of the pylon was gained. The square<br/>
basement in the centre of the court was probably an altar; let into<br/>
the ground beside it are two small granite troughs, into which<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">dr0k-offeri11gs </span>may have been poured. In this, as in all the other<br/>
rooms of the temple, the ancient pavement is in excellent preservation. The rear of the court is separated from the adjoining great<br/>
hypostyle hall by screen-walls, in which are two large portals and<br/>
two smaller doorways. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the screen-wall to the right (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. t) is a<br/>
relief of the hawk-headed Horus and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ibis-headed </span>Thout pouring<br/>
the water of consecration upon King Neos Dionysos, to the left of<br/>
whom is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crocodile-headed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sobk</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the lord of the right half of the<br/>
temple. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the left wall (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">g</span>) the same scene takes place before<br/>
the hawk-headed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haroéris</span>, to whom the left half of the temple is<br/>
dedicated. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">screen-wall</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>are crowned with serpents<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>with sun<br/>
disks on their heads.<br/>
