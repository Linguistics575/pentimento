<span>352 LOWER NUBIA.<br/>
<br/>
Ethiopian Pharaohs were forced to give way before the Assyrians,<br/>
and their kingdom was restricted to Nubia, of which the N. border<br/>
then lay near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phila </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Konosso</span>, p. 344).<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptian civilization gradually declined in Nubia. The<br/>
Egyptian hieroglyphic writing became corrupted and a native Ethio,<br/>
pian hieroglyphic and cursive character was developed <span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">six</span>),<br/>
which, about the beginning of the Christian era, began to be used<br/>
for writing the native Nubian language even in official documents.<br/>
About 600 Bi. the royal residence was <span style="color: #0000FF;">transferred </span>from Napata to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mero</span>? (p. 381), which lay farther to the S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Comparatively </span>full<br/>
information has come down to us concerning the earlier kings who<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dwelt </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meme</span>. We know also of the unsuccessful campaign of the<br/>
army of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psammetikh </span>I. against Lower Nubia (about 590 13.0.) to conquer Ethiopia, which<br/>
were foiled mainly by the energetic Ethiopian King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nastesen</span>.<br/>
After that an almost impenetrable veil falls over the history of the<br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
During the PTOLEMAIC AND ROMAN IMPERIAL <span style="color: #0000FF;">EPOCHS </span>the S.<br/>
boundary of Egypt was near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hierasykaminos </span>(p. 363), and it was<br/>
occasionally pushed farther <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>as far as Primis (p. 368)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>On the<br/>
other hand the Nubians sometimes succeeded in extending their<br/>
power as far N. as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philas</span>, and perhaps even occupied part of Upper<br/>
Egypt. When the Romans first came to Egypt Ethiopia was governed by a succession of queens named Candace. One of these<br/>
attacked the Roman province, but was repulsed by the Roman governor Petronius in 23 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. The Ethiopian kingdom seems soon<br/>
afterwards to have fallen into disorder and to have split up into a<br/>
number of small principalities. About this time also, the Blemmyes, a nomadic race of the E. desert, who had previously <span style="color: #0000FF;">acknowledged </span>the suzerainty of Ethiopia, assumed an aggressive attitude.<br/>
Not content with harassing the N. parts of Upper Nubia, they also<br/>
carried their depredations into the Roman territory in <span style="color: #ff0000;">8</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Egypt,<br/>
until finally the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Romans </span>gave way before them. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diocletian </span>(about<br/>
300 <span style="color: #0000FF;">A.D.</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew </span>from Nubia altogether, retiring within the<br/>
bounds of Egypt proper, to the N. of Phila. The Blemmyes, however, in alliance with the Nubians, continued their attacks on Upper<br/>
Egypt; but in 451 A.D. they were defeated by <span style="color: #ff0000;">jlfareianus</span>, who <span style="color: #ff0000;">coneluded </span>a peace with them (p. 337).<br/>
<br/>
Christianity established itself at Phila in the 4th <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>, and<br/>
thence extended throughout Nubia, where the temples were converted into churches. In (W) AD. Egypt and the Upper Nile Valley<br/>
fell into the hands of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammedans</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>'Amr (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">xciii</span>) penetrated<br/>
as far as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dongola </span>and imposed tribute upon Nubia, but no enduring<br/>
subjugation of the country was effected. Shams <span style="color: #0000FF;">ed-Dila</span>, brother<br/>
of Saladin, took possession of the fortress of Ibrim (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">368</span>) in<br/>
1173 and plundered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">church-tre-y</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>but Christianity yielded<br/>
to Islam very gradually, and a Christian kingdom lingered at Soba<br/>
<br/>
