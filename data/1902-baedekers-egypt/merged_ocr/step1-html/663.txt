women with their children (one <span style="color: #0000FF;">carrying </span>her children in a basket on her<br/>
back). One of the oxen <span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span>horns represented as arms, between which<br/>
is a negro <span style="color: #0000FF;">suing </span>for mercy. In the upper row we see the <span style="color: #0000FF;">above-mentioned<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tablet </span>placed before the king, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the governor of Ethiopia is being<br/>
adorned with chains as a reward; farther on <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>rings of gold, chairs,<br/>
elephants' tusks, weapons, fans, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">articles </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">brought </span>as tribute;<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">negrues </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">approach </span>with their offerings (cattle, antelopes, a lion, etc.). In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>relief the king appears in his chariot dashing against the<br/>
negro foe, followed by Prince <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amen-her-wnamf </span>(above) and Prince <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kheem-weset </span>(below), each in his chariot. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flet</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to their village,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>lies among <span style="color: #ff0000;">diimtslrms</span>. A wounded negro is led by two comrades<br/>
to his wife and children, while another woman crouches over a <span style="color: #0000FF;">life </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rocks </span>a meal.<br/>
<br/>
The reliefs on the right wall <span style="color: #0000FF;">refer </span>to the wars against the Syrians<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Libyans.<br/>
<br/>
In the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">scene </span>(beginning to the right) the Pharaoh stands upon<br/>
two prostrate enemies, grasping three others (Syrians) by the hair, while<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>prince <span style="color: #0000FF;">leads </span>fettered prisoners before him. - In the second relief the king<br/>
appears before a hostile fortress; on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">battlements </span>are men and women<br/>
suing for mercy (notice the woman holding her child by the arm); the<br/>
king seizes one of the enemy by the hair <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>kill him; below, one of the<br/>
royal princes is beating in the doors with an axe. - The third relief<br/>
shows the king in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">chariot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>dashing against the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fleeing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Syrians; he has<br/>
seized two of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">foes </span>by the hair and raises his sword for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fatal </span>stroke,<br/>
while two other captives are bound to his chariot. - In the next scene<br/>
the king smites a Libyan <span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sickle-shaped </span>sword, while his dog seizes<br/>
the foe. - In the fifth relief we see King Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">enthroned </span>beneath<br/>
a <span style="color: #ff0000;">canopy</span>, with his lion at his feet. His son <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amen-her-kholjshef </span>leads<br/>
three <span style="color: #0000FF;">Semitic </span>prisoners to him.<br/>
<br/>
Three doors lead from the vestibule into the HYPOSTYLE HALL,<br/>
which was hewn in the rock. The smaller doors to the right and<br/>
left, though also dating from the reign of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, were obviously<br/>
not made until after the wall had been covered with sculptures.<br/>
The ceiling of the hall is borne by two <span style="color: #0000FF;">tinted </span>columns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span>with<br/>
four perpendicular faces on which were <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>. The mural<br/>
reliefs are well executed, but their subjects are of no special interest.<br/>
They represent the king before the gods and (on each side of the<br/>
side-doors) smiting his enemies (a Syrian and an Ethiopian). The SANCTUARY has similar reliefs. By the rear-wall are three<br/>
statues of the gods, now defaced beyond recognition. Both <span style="color: #ff0000;">these<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">roek-eyharnbers </span>also were used as Christian churches.<br/>

district of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kenuz</span>, which is situated in the tropic of Cancer. The<br/>
magnificent constellation of the Southern Cross may be seen from<br/>

chief village Abu mr, the seat of the local authorities, with post<br/>
and telegraph <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices</span>, It is also a steamboat-station. On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rocks<br/>
</span>on the barren W. bank are numerous graffiti of ships and animals<br/>
and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">few </span>inscriptions of the Middle Empire.<br/>
