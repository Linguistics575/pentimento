in the second or third year of his reign, how could their sons or<br/>
successors, however willing to carry out the plan, have succeeded in<br/>
completing so gigantic a task, and in erecting monuments for themselves at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span>time? (3) And how comes it that many other<br/>
kings did not, like Kheops, boldly anticipate a reign of thirty years<br/>
and begin a work of the same kind, the design for which might so<br/>
easily have been drawn, and might so readily have been carried<br/>
out by his subjects? - To these questions Lepsius, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Erbkam</span>, and<br/>
Ebers answer.'Each king', says Lepsius in his letters from Egypt,<br/>
'began to build his pyramid when he ascended the throne. He began<br/>
it on a small scale, in order that, if a short reign should <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>in store<br/>
for him, his tomb might be a complete one. As years rolled on,<br/>
however, he continued enlarging it by the addition of outer coatings<br/>
of stone, until he felt that his career was drawing to a close. If<br/>
he died before the work was completed, the last coating was <span style="color: #ff0000;">then<br/>
</span>finished, and the size of the monument was <span style="color: #0000FF;">accordingly </span>proportioned<br/>
to the length of the builder's reign; so that, had the progress of<br/>
these structures always been uniform, it would have almost been<br/>
possible to ascertain the length of each king's reign from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">inorustations </span>of his pyramid, in the same way as the age of a tree is<br/>
determined by the number of the concentric rings in its trunk'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">This'layer-theory</span>' of the construction of the Pyramids has been<br/>
opposed by Flinders Petrie, who has sought to show that the initial<br/>
plan of each pyramid practically contemplated the full extent<br/>
reached by the completed work. But more recently <span style="color: #ff0000;">Borehardt </span>has<br/>
demonstrated <span style="color: #0000FF;">conclusively </span>that Lepsius's theory of the gradual<br/>
growth of each pyramid is essentially correct and requires <span style="color: #ff0000;">moditieation </span>in a few details only. According to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Borchardt</span>, each pyramid<br/>
builder began by planning a monument of moderate size. In many<br/>
instances this original <span style="color: #0000FF;">small </span>conception was permanently adhered<br/>
to; but it not <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfrequently </span>happened that kings who enjoyed long<br/>
reigns or found themselves in control of more extensive powers,<br/>
expanded their original designs and enlarged their buildings either<br/>
by mere additions without altering <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>passages or chambers (as<br/>
in the step-pyramid at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salilsira</span>) or by revising <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>original<br/>
design, including the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">etc.7 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>a new and more extensive<br/>
scale (as in the third pyramid of Gizeh). <span style="color: #ff0000;">0eeasionally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">second<br/>
</span>enlargement took place, as in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of the Great Pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
The Pyramids were opened by <span style="color: #ff0000;">saerilegious </span>robbers at a very early<br/>
period, <span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span>under <span style="color: #ff0000;">tbe20th </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dyn.</span>, or even earlier. Attempts were<br/>
made to force an entrance into the inner chambers, and passages<br/>
were laboriously cut through the solid masonry in order to reach<br/>
the expected treasures. In the course of this mining and tunnelling<br/>
the passages and chambers sustained much damage. Somewhere<br/>
about the period of the 25th or 26th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dyn</span>. these injuries were<br/>
repaired and the pyramids once more restored. But they seem to<br/>
have been again invaded by the Persians; and also at later periods,<br/>
