the world, and gave its name <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'Pharos</span>' to all <span style="color: #0000FF;">1i </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hthouses </span>afterwards<br/>
erected. Its original height is said to have been <span style="color: #ff0000;">iOO </span>ells (590 ft.), and<br/>
though even in antiquity it threatened more than once to collapse, part<br/>
of the ancient tower still stood erect <span style="color: #0000FF;">after </span>the great earthquakes of 1303<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">13-6</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>This was overwhelmed <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span>later, and the present<br/>
fortifications (<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Fort </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">du </span>Phare' or'Fort <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kirit-Bey</span>') were erected near its<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">site.1n </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">15th </span>century. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heptastadium</span>, a vast embankment seven<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stadia </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">11100 </span>yds.) in length, as its name imports, was constructed by<br/>
Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Soter</span>, or his son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philadelphus</span>. It was pierced by two passages,<br/>
bridged <span style="color: #0000FF;">over</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesar</span>'s time served also as an aqueduct. Having<br/>
since that period been artificially enlarged by <span style="color: #0000FF;">debris </span>from the ancient city,<br/>
thrown into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea</span>, as well as by natural deposits, it has attained <span style="color: #ff0000;">a<br/>
</span>width of more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">1600 </span>yds, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">now </span>forms the site of a great part of<br/>
the modern city.<br/>
<br/>
Among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">PRINCIPAL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">QUARTERS </span>of the ancient city Strabo <span style="color: #0000FF;">particularly </span>mentions the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neeropolis </span>or city of the dead, at the extreme W.<br/>
end,'where there are many gardens, tombs, and establishments for <span style="color: #0000FF;">embalming </span>bodies'; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhakotis</span>,'the quarter of Alexandria situated above the<br/>
ships' magazines<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>, chiefly inhabited <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>Egyptians (comp. p. 8<span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the Royal<br/>
City (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Regia</span>; afterwards called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brucht'um</span>), which was <span style="color: #0000FF;">subsequently </span>walled<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span>, and contained the palaces and public buildings, on the mainland<br/>
between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lochias </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heptastadium</span>; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jews</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>Quarter, situated<br/>
to the E. of the Lochias. Outside the Canopic gate, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E.</span>, lay the<br/>
hippodrome, and farther to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the suburb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nicopolfs </span>(p. 18),<br/>
30 <span style="color: #0000FF;">stadia </span>from Alexandria, which possessed an amphitheatre and a racecourse.<br/>
<br/>
The town was regularly built, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">streets </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">intersecting </span>each other<br/>
at right angles. The main artery of <span style="color: #ff0000;">trafiie </span>seems to have been the long<br/>
street beginning at the Canopic gate (comp. p. 15).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">PRINCIPAL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BUILDINGS </span>of ancient Alexandria the scanty relies<br/>
of only a few can <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">identified </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12</span>). The Paneum is doubtless identical<br/>
with the modern <span style="color: #ff0000;">K6111 </span>ed-Dik (p. 15). The Gymnasium probably lay to<br/>
the W. of this point.<br/>
<br/>
The theatre, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Same</span>, and the Museum were situated in the'Royal<br/>
City' (see above), which <span style="color: #0000FF;">originally </span>occupied a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mets </span>and afterwards a fourth<br/>
or even a third part of the whole extent of the city. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrian<br/>
</span>Theatre lay opposite the island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antirrhodus</span>, so that the spectators<br/>
had a view of the sea in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">background</span>. The Sema was an enclosed<br/>
space, within which were the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs </span>of Alexander the Great and of the<br/>
Ptolemies. Adjoining the tomb of Queen Cleopatra stood a temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">0f1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â» </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span>,<br/>
remains of which have <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>discovered at the intersection <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Rue<br/>
Nabi Daniel and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rue </span>de <span style="color: #ff0000;">rH6pital </span>Grec. This discovery should go far<br/>
to settle the site of the eagerly-sought tomb of Alexander.<br/>
<br/>
The Museum probably stood on a site to the E. of the church of St.<br/>
Athanasius. According to Strabo, it contained'a hall for <span style="color: #0000FF;">walking</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span>for sitting, and a large building with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">refectOry </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">scholars<br/>
</span>residing at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Museum.1 </span>Connected with the Museum <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the famous<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">library</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>which contained <span style="color: #0000FF;">400,000 </span>scrolls as early as the reign<br/>
of Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Philadelphus</span>, while in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesar </span>time, when it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>burned,<br/>
the number had risen to about <span style="color: #0000FF;">900,000</span>. The library lay to the N. of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Museum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>near the harbour. Besides the revenues enjoyed by the Museum<br/>
in its corporate capacity, a yearly salary was paid to each of the members,<br/>
whose number in the time of the first Ptolemies has been estimated at<br/>
one hundred at least.<br/>
<br/>
The site <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum</span>, or great temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serapis</span>, may be approximately determined by the fact that Pompey's Pillar (p. 12) <span style="color: #ff0000;">stood </span>in the<br/>
midst of it. The god to whom it was dedicated <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>introduced by the<br/>
Ptolemies<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and the temple is said to have been surpassed in grandeur by<br/>
no other building in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">world </span>except the Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">Capitol</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>In <span style="color: #0000FF;">An</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>69 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vespasian </span>was proclaimed emperor by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Alexanidriang7 </span>his election having been to a great extent due to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
