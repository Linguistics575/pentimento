<br/>
</span>laid upon <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>faithful reproduction of the face; the rest of the body,<br/>
especially the hands and feet, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">conventionally </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">superfieially<br/>
</span>treated. The artist frequently imparted a curiously striking effect<br/>
to his statue by inserting eyes of quartz, with a silver or copper stud<br/>
to represent the pupil. Few STATUES <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE MIDDLE EMPIRE can<br/>
stand comparison with the earlier masterpieces. The tendency to<br/>
idealize the countenance frequently makes itself apparent (<span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span>. in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>statue of Usertesen I. from Lisht, p. 86). During this period<br/>
the custom had again arisen of using hard granite as well as limestone - a custom <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>at least afforded the artist an opportunity of<br/>
exhibiting his technical skill to the best advantage. Masterpieces<br/>
of sculpture were, however, not wanting, as is proved, for example<br/>
by the tine statue of Amenemhet <span style="color: #0000FF;">111. </span>at Gizeh (p. 85), and by the<br/>
statues and sphinxes which were formerly attributed to the Hyksos,<br/>
but which probably also represent <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenemhet </span>III. <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>other kings<br/>
of the close of the 12th Dyn. (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">86</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The comparatively large number of STATUES OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>NEW <span style="color: #0000FF;">EMPIRE </span>which have come down to us betray a decline in art, although<br/>
most of them, it is true, were intended merely for decorative purposes. In most cases the artists have abandoned the attempt to<br/>
produce a faithful portrait, devoting their main efforts to the representation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coiffure</span>, the ornaments, and the flowing garments then fashionable. At the same time examples of incomparable verisimilitude, worthy to rank with the best productions of<br/>
the earlier period, are not wanting. Among these may be mentioned<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>head of King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Haremheb </span>and the head of a queen, both in<br/>
the Museum at Gizeh (Nos. 197, 198; p. 88), besides a few other<br/>
specimens in European museums.<br/>
<br/>
After the 20th Dyn. art steadily declined, until the reign of the<br/>
Ethiopian monarchs, when it again revived under the inspiration of<br/>
the models of the Ancient Empire. With the 26th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dyn</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">began </span>a later<br/>
period of bloom, which has justly been styled the period of the<br/>
EGYPTIAN RENAISSANCE (p. lxxxv). The prevalent tendency at this<br/>
epoch was towards a careful study of portraiture, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>it produced<br/>
some extraordinarily good work, especially in the portraits of baldheaded priests, in which the characteristic features are <span style="color: #0000FF;">indicated<br/>
</span>in a masterly manner, while the less significant details are ignored<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>The best specimens of this great style of art are now in Berlin, and<br/>
there are unfortunately no examples of it in the Gizeh Museum,<br/>
where the traveller will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>only insipid productions of the Egyptian<br/>
Renaissance, imitating without exception the models of an earlier<br/>
period - Slight traces of Greek <span style="color: #ff0000;">infHenee </span>may be detected in these<br/>
realistic works, and under the Ptolemies these traces become more<br/>
and more distinct. Side by side with purely Greek works <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cirhief1y<br/>
</span>in Alexandria) and purely Egyptian works, the sculptors of which<br/>
clung anxiously and mechanically to the ancient style, we meet<br/>
with specimens of a peculiar hybrid <span style="color: #0000FF;">Graeco-Egyptian </span>style, in which<br/>
