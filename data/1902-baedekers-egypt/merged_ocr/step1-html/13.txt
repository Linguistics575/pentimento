<br/>
The MAPS and PLANS have been the object of the Editor's<br/>
special care, and all have been carefully revised by Prof.<br/>
Steindorff, with the aid of the most recent publications and<br/>
of much valuable unpublished material, kindly placed at his<br/>
disposal by Prof. Loret of Lyons, M. G. Legrain <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo</span>,<br/>
and others. To the present edition have been added entirely new maps of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayiim</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile from Cairo to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asstian<br/>
</span>(3 sheets; <span style="color: #ff0000;">1:500,000</span>), and of the environs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assfusn</span>; new<br/>
plans of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Part </span>Sa'id, Luxor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete</span>.; and many new ground-plans.<br/>
The spelling of the names on the new maps follows the official French system of transliteration adopted in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tReeensement </span>général de <span style="color: #0000FF;">I'Egypte </span>du 1 juin 1897', published in 1898.<br/>

except where there is an express indication to the contrary.<br/>
<br/>
Ancient Egyptian names are transliterated on the system<br/>
indicated at p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">evi</span>. Arabic names have been specially revised<br/>
by Professor Socin of Leipsic.<br/>
<br/>
HOTELS, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete.</span>, see p. xviii. Hotels which cannot be <span style="color: #0000FF;">accurately </span>characterized without exposing the Editor to the risk<br/>
of legal proceedings are left <span style="color: #0000FF;">unmentioned</span>.<br/>
<br/>
To hotel-proprietors, tradesmen, and others the Editor<br/>
begs to intimate that a character for fair dealing and courtesy towards travellers forms the sole passport to his commendation, and that advertisements of every kind are strictly<br/>
excluded from his Handbooks. Hotel-keepers are also warned<br/>
against <span style="color: #0000FF;">persons </span>representing themselves as <span style="color: #0000FF;">agents </span>for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bsur</span>.<br/>
deker's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Handbooks</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
