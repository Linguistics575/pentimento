<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nasir</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">emirs</span>, exasperated by his treachery and <span style="color: #0000FF;">intrigues</span>, dethroned him in 1389; but in 1390 he <span style="color: #ff0000;">trir1mphantly </span>re-entered Cairo. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He </span>fought <span style="color: #0000FF;">successfully </span>against the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mongolians </span>under Timur and the Osmans under Bajazid.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Farag </span>(pp. 33, <span style="color: #ff0000;">65 </span>], his son, had scarcely ascended <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>throne, as a boy of thirteen years of age, before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osmans</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and a little later the Mongols, again began to<br/>
threaten the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">dominions</span>. Farag <span style="color: #ff0000;">proeea1edvietoriously </span>as far as Damascus; but owing to <span style="color: #0000FF;">dissensions </span>among<br/>
his emirs he was obliged to return to Cairo. After the<br/>
defeat of the Turks by the Mongols under Timur at the<br/>
battle of Angora, Farag was <span style="color: #0000FF;">compelled </span>to enter into <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ttegociations </span>with Timur. The latter years of Farag's reign<br/>
were constantly disturbed by the rebellions of his emirs,<br/>
particularly <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Mahmadi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Muaiyad</span>. He was at length compelled by the insurgents to capitulate at Damascus, and<br/>
was executed (May, 1412).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1ilMKalyniidi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Muaiyad </span>(p. 47) succeeded <span style="color: #0000FF;">Farag</span>. His <span style="color: #0000FF;">reign<br/>
</span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>occupied with victorious campaigns against his<br/>
unruly Syrian vassals, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>he was greatly aided by<br/>
the military talents of his son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibrahim</span>.<br/>
<br/>
He exacted heavy contributions from Christians and Jews,<br/>
and he <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-enacted </span>and rigorously enforced the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sumptuary </span>laws<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">of'Omar</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mutawakkil</span>, Hakim, and Mohammed <span style="color: #ff0000;">en-Nasir</span>. Not<br/>
only were the colours to be worn by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christians </span>and Jews<br/>
prescribed <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>the costume <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the former being dark-blue, with<br/>
black turbans, and a wooden cross weighing <span style="color: #0000FF;">51175. </span>hung round<br/>
their necks; that of the latter<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>yellow, with black <span style="color: #0000FF;">turbans</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>black ball hung from their necks); but the fashion <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>their dress and length of their turbans, and even the costume<br/>
of their women, were so regulated as entirely to distinguish<br/>
them from the followers of the prophet.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bursbey </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Berisbai</span>; p. 66), who had for a time been <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vicegerent </span>of an infant sultan, ascended the throne on April<br/>
1st, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1422</span>. He waged successful campaigns against Cyprus<br/>
and the Mongols.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Knit </span>Bey (pp. 55, 66) was one of the last <span style="color: #0000FF;">independent<br/>
</span>Mameluke sultans <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEgypt</span>. Both as a general and a diplomatist he <span style="color: #0000FF;">successfully </span>maintained his position against<br/>
the Turks (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultans </span>Mohammed and Bajazid), and even<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">inflieted </span>serious losses on <span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>but the refractory <span style="color: #ff0000;">Marnelukes </span>obstructed his undertakings and in 1496 compelled<br/>
him to <span style="color: #0000FF;">abdicate </span>in favour of his son <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed</span>, a boy of<br/>
fourteen.<br/>
<br/>
El-Ghuri, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kamuweh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et-0tlri </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>47), once a slave of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kai't<br/>
<br/>
</span>Bey, was upwards of sixty years of age when he ascended<br/>
the throne, but he still possessed <span style="color: #ff0000;">suftieient </span>vigour to keep<br/>
the unruly emirs in check. Already seriously injured by<br/>
the discovery of the Cape route to India by the Portuguese<br/>
