the roof above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">central </span>aisle is usually supported by clustered<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus-troi-s </span>with <span style="color: #ff0000;">oalyx-eapitals</span>, that above the side-aisles by<br/>
similar columns with <span style="color: #0000FF;">bud-capitals</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Beyond </span>this columned hall lie<br/>
three small apartments side by side; the middle one of these, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sanctuary</span>, was the dwelling proper of the god, while the side<br/>
chambers belonged to his wife [ <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>and to his son (Khons). Here<br/>
stood the sacred boats with the images of the gods. Sometimes <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">side-ehambers </span>are omitted, and the sanctuary is in that case<br/>
surrounded by a corridor, as in the peripteros (<span style="color: #0000FF;">e.y</span>. temple of Khons<br/>
at Karnak). Chambers of various sizes used for religious rites or<br/>
for the storage of temple property surrounded the sanctuary; <span style="color: #0000FF;">staircases </span>led to the roof and to various rooms, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>either served as<br/>
dwellings for the temple watchmen and servants or were used in the<br/>
celebration of particular ceremonies, etc.<br/>
<br/>
This form of Egyptian temple, which recurs in most of the larger<br/>
sacred buildings of the New Empire and lingered until after the<br/>
beginning of the Ptolemaic period, closely corresponds with the<br/>
ground-plan of the Egyptian house or palace previously described.<br/>
The open court of the house, accessible to every visitor, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">re<br/>
