<br/>
</span>dragoman is essential (p. xxii). A contract with him must be drawn<br/>
up stipulating <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the price and duration of the voyage, the style of<br/>
living, the maintenance of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabiyeh </span>in a good and <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficient<br/>
</span>condition, and the providing of a small boat to be at all times at<br/>
the disposal of the traveller. A clause should also be <span style="color: #0000FF;">inserted </span>relieving the travellers from all responsibility for any damage to the<br/>
dahabiyeh or its contents, not due to their fault; and finally both<br/>
parties should expressly agree to submit all <span style="color: #ff0000;">disputies </span>as to the carrying out of the contract to the arbitration of the consul in whose<br/>
presence it has been signed.<br/>
<br/>
Experienced travellers will find a very much cheaper mode of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">conveyance </span>than the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabiyeh </span>in one <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>native Sailing Boats <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Felaka</span>, which are used for the transport of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugarcane</span>, cotton, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>,<br/>
and are to be found in all the larger towns, such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Minyeh</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Assid.t</span>, Girgeh, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>, etc. No luxury, of course, must <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>looked<br/>
for, but its absence is compensated by the close relations with the<br/>
land and people into <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the traveller is brought. Woollen coverlets, a mattress, towels, an oil <span style="color: #0000FF;">eooking-stove </span>(obtainable in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cairo </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>,<br/>
tinned meats, a filter (<span style="color: #0000FF;">air</span>), and <span style="color: #0000FF;">insect-powder </span>must not be <span style="color: #0000FF;">forgotten<br/>
</span>A young attendant with some knowledge of cooking may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>obtained<br/>
for 2 or 3 fr. per <span style="color: #0000FF;">day</span>. A written contract must be carefully drawn<br/>
up to include all details.<br/>
