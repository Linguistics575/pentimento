<br/>
Abu Tarfa (W. bank). About 1 M. to the S. is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-cave </span>with<br/>
the tomb of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh</span>. The low rapids here, caused by granite rocks<br/>
in the Nile, are known as the Bab Abu <span style="color: #0000FF;">Her</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">121/2 </span>M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Murwau </span>(on both banks). At the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kubhht1b</span>, on<br/>
the W. bank, are ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">quay-walls </span>with a Nilometer <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>an <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished </span>little <span style="color: #0000FF;">cave-chapel</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>A little to the N. is a curious irrigation arrangement hewn in the rock.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the W. bank, opposite the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dendiir </span>(E. bank), <span style="color: #0000FF;">appears </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">small<br/>
</span>Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dendiir</span>, built by Augustus, and dedicated to various<br/>
gods, including <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pete-iii </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pii-Hir</span>, the sons of Kuper, two local<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">deified </span>heroes. The temple stands upon a platform, immediately at<br/>
the foot <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the mountains, and is preceded by a broad terrace. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">PYLON</span>, which formed the entrance to the temple, <span style="color: #0000FF;">only </span>the stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">doorway </span>remains; the towers, probably built of brick, have disappeared.<br/>
At the top of the portal is the winged sun-disk, and within and<br/>
on the front (<span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span>) and back (W.) is the Pharaoh <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to various<br/>
gods. Beyond the portal we enter an open COURT, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>originally enclosed by brick walls. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade </span>of the TEMPLE is adorned<br/>
with two columns with rich <span style="color: #0000FF;">floral </span>capitals, connected with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">side</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">...<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">screen-walls</span>. The temple <span style="color: #ff0000;">comprizes </span>a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vestibulc </span>and two<br/>
Smaller Chambers. The former is embellished with reliefs of the<br/>
Pharaoh in presence of the gods, which in the Christian period,<br/>
when the hall was used as a church, were covered with stucco, bearing pictures of saints. The smaller rooms have no decoration. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>the rear-wall of the innermost is a shallow Recess, with representation of the local saints <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pete-ese </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pé-Hor </span>praying <span style="color: #ff0000;">tolsis </span>and Osiris.<br/>
In the top <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>this wall also is a deep crypt, which could be closed<br/>
by a large and a small stone. The N. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">8</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Exterior Walls of the<br/>
temple are adorned with interesting reliefs. 0n the N. wall, to the<br/>
left of the door from the vestibule, appears the Pharaoh <span style="color: #0000FF;">ottering </span>a<br/>
piece of cloth to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pé-Hor</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>wall, below, to the left of the<br/>
door, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pete-ése</span>, who is accompanied by a woman<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>probably his wife.<br/>
<br/>
Among the various Inscriptions placed on the walls <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>visitors to the<br/>
temple, is one in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic</span>, in which a certain Presbyter Abraham records<br/>
that he erected a cross here in the church at the command of the Nubian<br/>
King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eispanomé</span>. This appears within the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>side-door <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the vestibule.<br/>
<br/>
Above the temple is a small Rock Chapel, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">door </span>showing the<br/>
hollow <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornice</span>. 1n the <span style="color: #ff0000;">clifls </span>to the N. of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>Quarries.<br/>
The stones lying in <span style="color: #0000FF;">front </span>of these are, perhaps, remains of ancient houses.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond (<span style="color: #ff0000;">181/3 </span>M.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meriyeh</span>, a commune <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>both banks, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">banks<br/>
<br/>
</span>of the Nile become flatter and are partly cultivated.<br/>
<br/>
23 M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Giw'sheh </span>(E. bank), situated in a wide belt of cultivated<br/>
land, lies besides the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins </span>of the ancient Byzantine fortress of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wrhagiira</span>, which stretches up the hill from the river and is enclosed<br/>
by strong walls of masonry.<br/>
<br/>
Opposite, on the W. bank, lie the village <span style="color: #ff0000;">and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
