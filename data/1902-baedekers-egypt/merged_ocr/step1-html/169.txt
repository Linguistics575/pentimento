are also found amongst them <span style="color: #0000FF;">Graeco-Egyptian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">half-breeds</span>, Romans,<br/>
people of Ethiopian descent, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">tolerably </span>large number of Semites<br/>
(Jews and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phamieiansi</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. For reasons which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ebers </span>has more minutely<br/>
explained and which are not merely stylistic, the best of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">paintings </span>cannot be more recent than the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>period, although the<br/>
majority date from the second Christian century or even later. They<br/>
convey a high idea of the keen faculty of observations possessed by<br/>
the painters, and of a usually free and light touch in the use of the<br/>
pencil <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">paint-brush</span>, which places these artists by the side of the<br/>
best masters of modern art. These portraits have, moreover, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiar </span>value in the history of art, as the only extant specimens of the<br/>
remarkable style of work known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Encaustic </span>Painting (wax <span style="color: #0000FF;">painting</span>), which obtained effects not <span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span>inferior to those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern<br/>
</span>oil-painting, and far exceeded <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>in point of durability.<br/>

X. Buildings of the Mohammedans.<br/>
<br/>
By <span style="color: #ff0000;">Franz </span>Pasha.<br/>
<br/>
The Mohammedan style of architecture in the valley of the Nile<br/>
was founded upon the forms of art which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">victorious </span>Arabs<br/>
found in vogue among the Byzantines and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Oopts</span>, and upon those<br/>
of Persian art of the era of the Sassanides. The buildings in Egypt<br/>
exhibit a considerable variety coupled with'a certain finish of style,<br/>
but none of them dates <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>period of Islam dominion;<br/>
for the professors of the new religion were for centuries content<br/>
merely to adapt the religious <span style="color: #ff0000;">edifiees </span>of the conquered countries as<br/>
mosques. This was a process of little <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty</span>, for the ceremonial<br/>
requirements of the new religion were comparatively simple, and<br/>
it took place in all parts of the great empire of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs</span>. From<br/>
casual references by the Arabian chroniclers <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>learn that the<br/>
earliest prayer-houses built by the Arabs were merely enclosed courts,<br/>
along the walls of which ran covered passages, supported by <span style="color: #ff0000;">palmtrunks</span>, in order to shelter the worshippers from sun and rain.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Costly </span>mosques, with marble arcades, began to <span style="color: #0000FF;">appear </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>gradually,<br/>
under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ir1iluence </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>and of the increasing<br/>
wealth flowing from the military successes of the Mohammedans.<br/>
Columns from Greek and Roman temples were freely employed in<br/>
these later mosques, but the early-Egyptian columns were too<br/>
colossal to be used except <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es </span>supports for domes or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mausolea </span>or for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hiblas</span>. This employment of ancient columns<br/>
in the mosques, frequently without any regard to harmony of style<br/>
or size, brings it about that uniformity in the architecture of the<br/>
arcades is observed only when the abacus is reached. No distinct<br/>
Arabian order of columns was thus ever developed in Egypt. Only<br/>
a few Arabian forms of capital, one a curious form <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx-capital</span>,<br/>
another including a wreath of <span style="color: #0000FF;">stalactites </span>as the transition between<br/>
