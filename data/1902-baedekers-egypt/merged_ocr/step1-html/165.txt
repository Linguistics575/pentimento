<span>cliv ALEXAND RIAN ART.<br/>
<br/>
Alexandria near the old Quarantine (<span style="color: #0000FF;">i. </span>e. in the region of the royal<br/>
palaces), and have been examined by the German geologists <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fraas<br/>
</span>and Schneider.<br/>
<br/>
Not much more than the names have come down to us of a<br/>
number of large buildings of the Ptolemies, each of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">doubtless<br/>
</span>represented an architectural advance. Such were the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Same</span>, or<br/>
Mausoleum of Alexander the Great, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">harbour-works </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Heptastadion<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diabathra</span>) which united the city and the island of Pharos, and<br/>
the Alexandrian Temple of Pan, which rose in the form of a hill.<br/>
The last <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Telesterium</span>, a temple built by Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">If</span>.<br/>
outside the E. gate of the city for the celebration of the Eleusinian<br/>
mysteries, were destroyed about the middle of the nineteenth century, before scholars had found time to examine them carefully. All<br/>
that remains of the Greek <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sempeum</span>, in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkara</span>,<br/>
now lies buried again in the sands of the desert, except the sculptures brought to light in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>excavation, some of which are now<br/>
left to disintegrate in the open air (comp. pp. 135 et <span style="color: #0000FF;">seq.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">8uificient </span>attention has not yet been paid to the position in architectural<br/>
history of the technically unique Aqueduct of Alexandria, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">coastal </span>with the foundation of the city, and stretched its subterranean canals along all the principal streets, supplying the<br/>
cisterns which were found in every house and some of which are<br/>
still in existence. Of the palaces and villas of the Ptolemies, of<br/>
the celebrated lighthouse on the island of Pharos, of the Gymnasium<br/>
situated on the Dromos or chief street, and of a few other buildings<br/>
we learn from ancient authors enough at least to justify us in <span style="color: #ff0000;">surmissing </span>that they served as models to the Roman architects for similar <span style="color: #ff0000;">edifiees</span>. The building of Alexandria was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>example on<br/>
a grand scale of the systematic laying out of a city on a homogeneous plan, with its regular network of streets cutting each other<br/>
at right angles and bordered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>, its long vistas, and<br/>
its symmetrically disposed public buildings; and it was imitated in<br/>
innumerable subsequent foundations. The latest <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antinoupolis </span>(p. 201), founded by Hadrian on the Nile, the lingering remnants of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>were not finally destroyed until last century. The<br/>
Rue de la Porte de Rosette in modern Alexandria marks the line of<br/>
the ancient main street, which united the E. and W. gates of the<br/>
fortifications; and numerous remains of the double colonnade with<br/>
which it once was bordered are seen in the fragments of columns in<br/>
the neighbouring houses and gardens.<br/>
<br/>
These comprehensive architectural undertakings were naturally<br/>
accompanied by a corresponding activity in the domain of Sculpture.<br/>
In the time of Alexander the Great, under the Ptolemies, and<br/>
afterwards under the Roman emperors, this art was especially <span style="color: #0000FF;">employed</span>, as it had been under the ancient Pharaohs, in producing<br/>
statues and busts of the royal family. (For portraits of Alexander,<br/>
see Nos. 29 and 35 in Case <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span>, in Room <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>in the Museum.) Besides<br/>
