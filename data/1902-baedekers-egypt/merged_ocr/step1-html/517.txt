<span>242 Route 24. <span style="color: #0000FF;">TH </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mute </span>w. <span style="color: #0000FF;">HANK</span>). 1. Luxor.<br/>
<br/>
now destroyed. One chapel (L) was dedicated to the goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mat</span>,<br/>
the other (M) to the moon-god Khons. - A door in the centre of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall </span>admits to a smaller hall, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>originally had eight<br/>
columns, and was converted into a Church (P1. E) in the Christian<br/>
period. The ancient entrance to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuary-chambers </span>has here<br/>
been altered into a kind of apsidal recess, bounded on the right and<br/>
left by two granite Corinthian columns. At a few points the Christian<br/>
whitewash has peeled off, permitting the'heathen' reliefs of Amenophis III. to become visible again. Adjoining the church are several small rooms (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. H, I, K).<br/>
<br/>
We now <span style="color: #0000FF;">return </span>to the hypostyle hall and quit the temple by a<br/>
door on the E. side (<span style="color: #0000FF;">beside </span>Pl. K), but <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-enter </span>it almost immediately<br/>
to inspect the Birth Room (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. R), the roof of which rests upon<br/>
three clustered columns. The room owes its name to the Beliefs on<br/>
the W. wall, referring to the birth of Amenophis III. The reliefs<br/>
on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s. </span>wall refer to his accession to the throne.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">WEST </span>WALL. Lowest Row (from left to right): 1. The god Khnum moulds<br/>
two infants (Amenophis 111. and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">guardian-spirit</span>) upon the <span style="color: #ff0000;">potter's<br/>
</span>wheel; opposite is seated Isis. 2. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnum </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>. 3. Ammon and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Met-em-wa</span>, mother of <span style="color: #ff0000;">AmenoPhis </span>IH., seated upon the hieroglyphic <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbol </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for'heaven</span>', and supported by the goddesses Selket and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neith</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">4</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon </span>conversing with Thout. 5. Isis (defaced) embracing Queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Met-em-wa</span>;<br/>

Isis and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnum</span>. 4. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Confinement </span>of Net-em-wa; beside and beneath the<br/>
couch <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bes</span>, Toeris, and other genii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">d. </span>Isis (defaced) presents the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">new-horn </span>prince to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>with the child in his arms; beside<br/>
him are Hathor and Nut. - Top <span style="color: #0000FF;">Row </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to distinguish owing to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lowness </span>of the relief): 1. To the left is the queen, with the goddess<br/>
Selket seated behind her; to the right two goddesses suckle the infant<br/>
prince and his <span style="color: #ff0000;">guardian-ppirit</span>; below, the prince and his guardian-spirit<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Buckled </span>by two cows. <span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Nine deities holding the prince. <span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The god<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hekaw </span>(painted blue) carrying the prince and his guardian-spirit; behind<br/>
is the Nile-god. <span style="color: #0000FF;">d. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Home </span>hands the prince and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">guardian-spirit </span>to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>. 5. Khnum and Anubis. 6. The prince and his guardian-spirit<br/>
seated and standing before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">T</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>(in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corner</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Amenophis as <span style="color: #ff0000;">King</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>From the Birth Room we enter Room 0, the roof of which is<br/>
supported by three columns, and thence, glancing at the much<br/>
damaged reliefs, we pass through an arched doorway into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">socalled<br/>
</span>Sanctuary of Alexander the Great (Pl. G). This chamber was<br/>
practically rebuilt by Alexander, who replaced the original four<br/>
supporting columns in the centre by a chapel, in which the sacred<br/>
boat of Ammon was preserved. The reliefs covering both the interior and exterior walls of the chapel represent Alexander before<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>and his fellow-gods. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the walls of the chamber the reliefs<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>111. have been left (the king before the various Theban<br/>
deities). - A gap in the wall on the N. side of the Sanctuary admits us to a small square Hall (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. F), with four clustered <span style="color: #ff0000;">papyruseolumns</span>. The wall-reliefs, which are in three rows, show Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>before Ammon and other Theban deities. The door hence<br/>
to the Sanctuary has been built up.<br/>
