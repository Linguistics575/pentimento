<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>Egypt, as elsewhere, the Pier and the Column are the most<br/>
important of all architectural members. Their absence indicates a<br/>
very elementary stage in the art of building, when artistic development has yet to begin. Their presence breaks the outline of the<br/>
different masses of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">edifiee </span>and affords strength and support.<br/>
<br/>
The simplest form of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">weight-bearing </span>member is the square<br/>
Pier, and this is common even in the tombs of the Ancient Empire.<br/>
<br/>
The lateral surfaces of the piers are frequently<br/>
occupied by reliefs "inscriptions and their<br/>
fronts by other ornamental designs. Thus tall<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus-plants </span>and lilies occur on piers of the<br/>
time of Thutmosis III. at Karnak (p. 255), a<br/>
sistrum (a rattle used by women) with a head<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu-Simbel </span>(p. 375), and <span style="color: #ff0000;">iyolossal </span>figures of Osiris (Fig. I) in the Ramesseum (p. 285) and at Medinet <span style="color: #ff0000;">Habu </span>(p. 300).<br/>
The four-sided pier was converted into an<br/>
octagonal pillar by <span style="color: #0000FF;">bevelling </span>off the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corners</span>,<br/>
part of the pier, however, being left square<br/>
at the top so as to blend with the roof; at the<br/>
foot was a round, <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rushion-like </span>base. The<br/>
next step was to convert, by a similar process,<br/>
the octagonal pillar into one with sixteen<br/>
sides, and in some cases the flat surfaces were<br/>
grooved or fluted, a sharp edge being left between each pair of sides. Polygonal columns<br/>
of this character, which have received the<br/>
name <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Proto-Dario </span>(Fig. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO</span>, occur in tombs<br/>
of the Middle Empire (at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Benihasan </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>) and in temples <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>time of Thutmosis III. (Karnak, p. 255; DÃ©r <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-bahri</span>,<br/>
p. 278). The name was suggested by certain<br/>
points of resemblance to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>columns of<br/>
the Greeks, the chief of which are the marked<br/>
fluting and the tapering; but the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Proto-Doric<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I. </span>Osiris pillar.<br/>
<br/>
differs from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek </span>Dorie in being destitute of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'eehinus</span>', a<br/>
member resembling an overhanging wreath of leaves, forming the<br/>
capital of the true <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>column. The chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">difference</span>, however, is<br/>
that the shaft of the Egyptian column rests upon a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sound</span>, flat base,<br/>
while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Doric </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">column </span>springs immediately from the ground. <span style="color: #0000FF;">An<br/>
