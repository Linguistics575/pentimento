grown in Egypt from a very early period. A bushy tree, which in<br/>
its <span style="color: #ff0000;">half-leal1ess </span>condition attracts the attention of every traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oil<br/>
</span>landing at Alexandria in winter, is the Poinsettia <span style="color: #0000FF;">pulcherrima</span>. The<br/>
insignificant <span style="color: #0000FF;">blossom </span>is surrounded by leaves of the most brilliant<br/>
red, <span style="color: #0000FF;">presenting- </span>a very picturesque and striking appearance. Natural<br/>
forests, or even solitary wild trees, are never met with in the valley<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Nile or in the valleys of the northern deserts.<br/>

e. The Climate of Egypt.<br/>
By Leigh <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canney</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">M.D</span>. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Loni</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">ER</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Met. Soc.<br/>
<br/>
The blue <span style="color: #0000FF;">cloudless </span>sky, the powerful sunlight, and the dry<br/>
warm air are among the first facts that strike the traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>his<br/>
arrival in Egypt; and his surprise increases when he observes that<br/>
the conditions remain uniform day after <span style="color: #0000FF;">day</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and are, in short, so<br/>
entirely the rule that'the weather' ceases to be a topic of conversation. If from the top <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the hills <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cliffs </span>bordering the Nile valley<br/>
to the S. of Cairo he looks out on the boundless deserts on either<br/>
side, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">visitor </span>will realize at once that Egypt is <span style="color: #0000FF;">practically </span>a part<br/>
of the Sahara, a verdant strip of fertile soil, <span style="color: #0000FF;">8A2 </span>M. wide, dependent for its existence <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>the Nile; and that the refreshing purity<br/>
of the atmosphere is essentially due to the proximity of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
The atmosphere of the Libyan Desert, to the W. of the Nile<br/>
valley, is so dry in <span style="color: #0000FF;">winter</span>, that dew is rarely seen even when the<br/>
thermometer falls to <span style="color: #0000FF;">freezing-point</span>; and a shower condensed in<br/>
the upper air is often dissipated before it can reach the earth. The<br/>
daily range of temperature recorded here by Rohlfs was 3Y, which<br/>
is more than is usual in Egypt; the minimum <span style="color: #0000FF;">noted </span>was (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PAP<br/>
</span>below freezing-point and the maximum <span style="color: #0000FF;">1220</span>. During the warm<br/>
season (from about May to October) the hot desert air ascends and<br/>
a current of cold air <span style="color: #0000FF;">streams </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>from the Mediterranean. Thus arises<br/>
a North Wind, the famous'Etesian Wind' of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Herodotus</span>, which<br/>
greatly tempers the heat of summer throughout Egypt, and which<br/>
is more and more <span style="color: #0000FF;">deprived </span>of moisture as it proceeds farther and<br/>
farther to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s. </span>During the remaining <span style="color: #0000FF;">months </span>West Winds prevail,<br/>
which, rising in the N. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">central </span>portions of the Libyan Desert, reach<br/>
Lower Egypt from the S.W. and Upper Egypt from the N.W. In<br/>
winter the W. wind is often <span style="color: #ff0000;">piereiugly </span>cold at Cairo and Alexandria<br/>
and cool in Upper Egypt, owing to the fact that the Libyan Desert<br/>
and Sahara are colder than Cairo by <span style="color: #ff0000;">y </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">4Â°</span>, while Cairo is colder<br/>
in winter than Alexandria by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Y</span>. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">spring</span>, during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty </span>days<br/>
before the summer-solstice, a strong, hot, dry, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sand-laden </span>wind<br/>
from the S.W. blows at irregular intervals for a day or two at a time,<br/>
and is known as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khamsfn </span>(from Arab. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lchzmastn</span>, fifty). The sun<br/>
is then often <span style="color: #0000FF;">obscured</span>, the temperature may be raised to <span style="color: #0000FF;">100-1060</span>,<br/>
and the relative humidity reduced to 10 per cent or less in Cairo and<br/>
