<br/>
showing the facade of the temple of Luxor, with the pylons and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flag-staffs</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statues, and the obelisks, while from the<br/>
right approaches a procession, headed by the princes and followed<br/>
by garlanded animals for <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice</span>. (The scene is continued on the<br/>
W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall</span>.)<br/>
<br/>
The S. half of the court is farther embellished with standing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Colossi </span>of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, placed between the columns in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>row.<br/>
These, with the exception of one in black granite, are wrought in<br/>
red granite and average 23 ft. in height. The finest (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. a) stands<br/>
to the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E.</span>) and is 171/2 ft. high; the crown, carved from a<br/>
separate <span style="color: #0000FF;">block</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>has fallen off; on the pedestal and apron is the<br/>
name <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>On each side of the doorway leading to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>is another colossal figure of the king, seated with the<br/>
queen by his side.<br/>
<br/>
On the S.side this court is adjoined by a Colonnade (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1.B</span>), which<br/>
was originally intended as the beginning of an immense hypostyle<br/>
hall (comp. p. 238). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>is in fairly good preservation<br/>
and contributes essentially to the dignified appearance of the ruins<br/>
of Luxor when viewed from the river. The marvellous play of <span style="color: #0000FF;">colour<br/>
</span>shown by the deep, heavy shadows of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>at sunset is<br/>
nowhere excelled. Seven couples of columns, nearly 42 ft. in height,<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx-capitals</span>, still support a heavy <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave </span>above a lofty<br/>
abacus. The whole was built by Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tut-eV<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen </span>(p. 238), Haremheb, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, and Sethos II.<br/>
have also recorded their names upon it. The walls of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade<br/>
</span>were embellished by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tut-enkh-Amon </span>with reliefs, representing the<br/>
great festival celebrated at Luxor on New Year's Day. On that day<br/>
the sacred boats of the gods were brought by the Nile from Karnak<br/>
to Luxor, borne into the temple at Luxor, and returned to Karnak<br/>
in the evening. The procession is here depicted in all its details,<br/>
though unfortunately a large part of the reliefs has perished with<br/>
the ruined upper part of the walls. The series begins at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">YE</span>.<br/>
corner of the colonnade and ends at the N.W. corner.<br/>
<br/>
The (second) Court of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span>. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span>), which we enter<br/>
next, is 48 yds. long and 55 yds. broad, and had double rows of<br/>
columns on three sides. The columns are clustered papyrus<br/>
columns with bud-capitals; the E. and W. rows, with the architrave, are in excellent preservation, and are specially effective as<br/>
seen from the river-bank.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately adjoining this court is a Hypostyle <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. D),<br/>
the roof of which was borne by 32 clustered papyrus-columns<br/>
arranged in 4 rows of <span style="color: #0000FF;">B</span>. The reliefs on the E. wall show <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111. </span>before the gods of Thebes; at the foot of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">wall </span>are<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">personitieations </span>of the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">names</span>, bearing gifts. To the left<br/>
of the central <span style="color: #0000FF;">axis </span>of the hall stands <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>Altar, dedicated to the<br/>
Emperor Augustus, with a Latin inscription. Adjoining the <span style="color: #ff0000;">rearwall </span>are two small Chapels (P1. L and M) and a staircase (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. N),<br/>
