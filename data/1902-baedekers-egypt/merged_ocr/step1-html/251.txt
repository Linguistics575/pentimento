These schools are maintained by the private enterprise of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolmasters </span>themselves, who exact 1-2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">pies </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tres </span>per week from each pupil. The<br/>
mere reading and recitation of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Verses </span>from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Forth</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>being in itself <span style="color: #0000FF;">considered </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span>meritorious act, the great object of these schools is to teach the<br/>
pupils to recite the <span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Karin </span>by heart. After learning the alphabet, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronunciation </span>and the values of numbers, the pupil is taught the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ninety-nine<br/>
</span>'beautiful' names of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Allah</span>, a knowledge of which is necessary to enable<br/>
him to repeat the ninety-nine prayers of the Mohammedan rosary (sebha).<br/>
The boy is then made to write out the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fcitba</span>, or first chapter (<span style="color: #ff0000;">s1hieh</span>)<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koran</span>, which he reads often enough to impress it perfectly on<br/>
his memory, swaying his body to and fro the while, whereby, as he<br/>
imagines, his memory is rendered more pliant. After learning the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ihat<br/>
</span>chapter, he next proceeds to learn the last, the last but one, and the<br/>
others in the same inverted order, until he reaches the second, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">reason </span>being that the chapters gradually diminish in length from the<br/>
second to the last. Although the language is often <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>and obscure,<br/>
no explanations are given, so that the boy who knows the whole book<br/>
by heart usually understands but little of it. As soon as the boy has<br/>
learned the whole of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>in this way, the completion of his studies<br/>
is commemorated by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">celebration </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khatmeh</span>, a family festival, to<br/>
which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolmaster </span>is invited.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bazaar</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>of Cairo, though inferior to those of Damascus<br/>
and Constantinople, present to the European traveller many novel<br/>
features and many interesting traits of Oriental character. As <span style="color: #ff0000;">i</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
</span>the universal custom in the East, shops of the same kind, with<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">workshops</span>, are congregated together in the same quarter,<br/>
named sometimes after a mosque, but more usually after the wares<br/>
there sold, e.g. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Silk </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">en-NuNitutm </span>bazaar of the coppersmiths, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stile<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Rhordagtyeh</span>, bazaar of the ironmongers. Most of the bazaars <span style="color: #0000FF;">Consist </span>of narrow, and often dirty, lanes, generally covered over with<br/>
an awning to shade them from the sun, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flanked </span>with shops about<br/>
6 ft. wide. These shops (<span style="color: #ff0000;">dtakon</span>) are open towards the street, and<br/>
in front of each is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>or seat on which the customer takes his<br/>
place and on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the shopkeeper <span style="color: #0000FF;">offers </span>his prayers at the appointed<br/>
hours. The inscriptions above and in the shop do not consist of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dealer</span>'s name, but of various pious ejaculations, such as'Oh Allah,<br/>
locker of the gate of gain, oh, all-nourisher','the help of Allah and<br/>
a speedy victory', etc. These lanes usually enclose a massive storehouse of considerable size (<span style="color: #0000FF;">kha'n</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">consisting </span>of two stories. Several<br/>
of these <span style="color: #ff0000;">khims </span>form a quarter of the city (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mra</span>). These were formerly <span style="color: #0000FF;">closed </span>at night by massive, <span style="color: #ff0000;">iron-mounted </span>gates, still in some<br/>
cases preserved, though no longer used.<br/>
<br/>
The principal market-days are Monday and Thursday, when<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">traffie </span>in the narrow streets is so great that it becomes difficult<br/>
or impossible to traverse them. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pedlers </span>are seen forcing their way<br/>
through the crowd, shouting at the top of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">voices</span>, sometimes<br/>
carrying a small table with them, and frequently selling their wares<br/>
by auction. So, too, we observe <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffee-sellers</span>, water-bearers, <span style="color: #ff0000;">nar<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bazar </span>is properly speaking a Persian word, the Arabic equivalent<br/>
for which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">sg</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span>. The magazines of the wholesale merchants, with their<br/>
large courts, are called <span style="color: #ff0000;">wakkdleh</span>, which the Franks have corrupted to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Occateh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Occal</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Okella</span>.<br/>
