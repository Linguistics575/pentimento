<br/>
have been chiselled out here also, and replaced by those of others.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>figures and names of the gods defaced by Amenophis IV. were<br/>
restored under Haremheb and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethos </span>I. The entrance was originally<br/>
on the E. side, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>the later restorations, under Ramses III. and in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>and Roman periods, were so extensive, that little of<br/>
the ancient ground-plan is distinguishable. The reliefs on the outside date from the reign of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.<br/>
<br/>
</span>To the E. of the Pavilion of Ramses is a gate leading into <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>second court. The temple itself, to the left, comprises a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Celia<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. K) surrounded by a Colonnade (added by Thutmosis 111.), and<br/>
six Chambers behind. The Colonnade is enclosed on the outside by<br/>
a parapet upon which rise square pillars, which support the roof<br/>
along with the sixteen-sided columns in the inner row. The representations show Thutmosis III. <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>or performing other<br/>
sacred rites in presence of the gods. In the inner chambers <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>I. and Thutmosis II. also appear in place of the original<br/>
figures of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Makere</span>. The inscriptions on the pillars on each side of<br/>
the entrance refer to the restorations by Haremheb, Sethos <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pinotem</span>. The cella had a door at each end (restored by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Euergetes </span>IL). The last room on the right still contains <span style="color: #0000FF;">a'mum</span>' of red<br/>
granite. - The structures to the N. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>of the anterior colonnade<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>added at a later period. That to the N. was erected with<br/>
blocks taken from earlier edifices, bearing the names of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pinotem</span>, and Hakoris. The small grated windows should be noticed.<br/>
<br/>
We now return to the Second Court, which dates from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saitie<br/>
</span>period. The granite gateway to the E. was built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Peteamenopii</span>, a<br/>
noble living under the 26th Dyn. (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">284</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. On the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>the<br/>
court is bounded by the Second Pylon, 50 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>wide, which was erected<br/>
by Shabako (p. lxxxiv), the Ethiopian, and restored under Soter II.<br/>
On the back of the Pylon appears Taharka (p. lxxxiv), grasping a<br/>
band of enemies by the hair and smiting them. - The adjoining<br/>
Court of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektanebos</span>, 311/2 ft. long and 26 ft. wide, was supported<br/>
on each side by four columns with bud-capitals (only two now<br/>
complete<span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>connected with each by <span style="color: #ff0000;">sereerr-walls</span>. On the E. side<br/>
was a portal<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>- About 13 ft. to the E. of the last rises the large<br/>
First Pylon, which was built in the later <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>epoch, with<br/>
blocks taken from earlier <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">esptyeia11y </span>from the Ramesseum).<br/>
Ptolemy <span style="color: #ff0000;">X. </span>Soter II. and Ptolemy XIII. appear on the central portal,<br/>
worshipping the gods.<br/>
<br/>
On the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>side of the pylon, facing the First Court, which was<br/>
128 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>long and 82 ft. broad, was a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cotonnade</span>, which had columns<br/>
with rich floral capitals, connected with each other by high <span style="color: #ff0000;">screenwalls </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">11nfinisheO </span>Only the two central columns are now left. In<br/>
front of one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">screen-walls </span>is placed a red granite stele <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>III., discovered in the course of the excavations. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gateways<br/>
</span>in the wall surrounding the court are now built up; that on the S.<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">g</span>) is adorned with inscriptions by Antoninus Pius.<br/>
