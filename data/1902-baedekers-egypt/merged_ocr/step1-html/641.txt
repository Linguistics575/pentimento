<span style="color: #0000FF;">better </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">obtain </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">good </span>general impression from the whole, than to examine<br/>
the details minutely. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Luneheot1</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the traveller must bring with<br/>
him, <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>usually taken near the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kiosk </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>343).<br/>
<br/>
From the landing-place we proceed to the S.W. end of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">island </span>to visit the extensive Outer Temple Court, which is bounded<br/>
on the N. by the first pylon of the Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Isis</span>, on the S. by the<br/>
Vestibule of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektanebos</span>, and on the E. and W. by colonnades. This<br/>
court dates from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">late-Ptolemaic </span>period or from the reign of Augustus. Attention should be paid to the strong Quay Wall that perhaps was carried round the greater part <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>island, with flights <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>stone steps at various points. The remains of one such flight may be<br/>
seen on the S. bank, to the E. of the building of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektanebos</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The VESTIBULE <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">NEKTANEBOS </span>was built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektanebos </span>as the<br/>
vestibule for a temple, dedicated to'his mother Isis, revered at Abaton, mistress <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Philae, and to the Hathor of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senmet</span>' (p. 314). The<br/>
temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>swept away by the floods <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile very shortly after its<br/>
completion; but Ptolemy Philadelphus caused the vestibule to be<br/>
thoroughly restored. The elegant little structure was supported by<br/>
14 columns with varying floral capitals, above each of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a<br/>
second capital bearing a head of Hathor. Unfortunately only six of<br/>
the columns are now standing, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">roof </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span>disappeared. Between the columns were <span style="color: #0000FF;">screen-walls</span>, over 6 ft. in height, crowned<br/>
with concave cornices and rows of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Urmus- </span>serpents, and interrupted<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E.</span>, W., and N. by exit-doors. These screens-walls bore<br/>
reliefs showing King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektanebos </span>offering gifts to the gods. Before<br/>
the river-front of the temple two <span style="color: #0000FF;">Obelisks </span>upon chest-shaped bases<br/>
were erected in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>period. These were made <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>sandstone instead of the usual granite. <span style="color: #ff0000;">TheW</span>. obelisk, bearing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek<br/>
</span>and several <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>, is still standing, though it has lost<br/>
its apex; the E. obelisk is represented by its base only.<br/>
<br/>
The WEST Commune, which follows the line of the shore of the<br/>
island, is 100 yds. in length and has a row of 31 (<span style="color: #ff0000;">former1y </span>32) plant<br/>
columns, each <span style="color: #0000FF;">16 </span>ft. high, no two capitals of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are alike. Most<br/>
of the columns have two series of reliefs, showing Tiberius offering<br/>
gifts to the gods. The ceiling, which is partly destroyed, is decorated<br/>
with stars and flying vultures. The rear-wall, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">windows </span>in which<br/>
command a beautiful view of the stream and of the island of Bigeh<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">344 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, is embellished with two horizontal rows of alto-reliefs,<br/>
representing the Pharaoh (usually Augustus or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tiberius</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">offe1'ing<br/>
</span>various gifts to the gods. The relief over the window opposite the<br/>
first two columns (P1. a) is specially noteworthy for its excellently<br/>
preserved colouring and the delicacy of its execution; it represents<br/>
Nero offering two eyes to Horus, Isis'the good sister', and the'lord<br/>
of both lands'. - A subterranean stairway leads outside this <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>to a small Nilometer.<br/>
<br/>
The EAST COLONNADE is <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished</span>; only six <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">if</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">columns<br/>
</span>are completed, the remainder were left merely rough-hewn. The<br/>
