<span>HISTORY OF ART. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cxlix<br/>
<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>are Greek in attitude and Egyptian in drapery, <span style="color: #0000FF;">coiffure</span>,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">adornment</span>. However valuable these may be for an appreciation<br/>
of Egyptian civilization at a late period, they certainly carry no<br/>
satisfaction to the eye intent upon artistic effects.<br/>
<br/>
It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>for the ordinary student to obtain a proper <span style="color: #0000FF;">appreciation </span>of Egyptian Beliefs, owing to the peculiar style of <span style="color: #0000FF;">drawing</span>, which arose in prehistoric times and which was religiously<br/>
adhered to as a kind of sacred tradition ever afterwards, with but<br/>
few exceptions. The principle adopted was that of representing<br/>
each part of the body in the clearest and most faithful manner,<br/>
ignoring, however, the necessity of combining them harmoniously<br/>
as they appear to the eye in a complete figure<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Thus we constantly<br/>
see reliefs with the faces in profile, but with the eyes drawn from<br/>
the front; or the shoulders are shown nearly facing us and the feet<br/>
and legs in profile; or, still more peculiarly, the back of the trunk<br/>
is drawn in full breadth and the front in profile. These peculiarities recur in the works of other Oriental nations and even in those<br/>
of the Greeks of the early period, who, however, soon overcame the<br/>
defect. Another rule of Egyptian composition forbade the intersection of the figure by an outstretched arm or similar line; thus<br/>
in the case of a figure walking or stretching the hand to any object it is invariably the foot or hand farthest from the spectator<br/>
that is extended. Ignorance of perspective and foreshortening is<br/>
also apparent, all the more on account of the evident effort to represent every separate <span style="color: #0000FF;">object </span>clearly and completely. Thus persons,<br/>
animals, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>, supposed to be behind others are depicted in rows above<br/>
them, and objects intended to be lying upon tables are depicted<br/>
standing above the tables. This primitive method was carried so<br/>
far that, in the representations of vessels with interior decoration,<br/>
the interior decoration is placed above the vessels<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>without any attention to perspective. The principal personages in a representation<br/>
are indicated by the primitive distinction of being delineated on a<br/>
much larger scale than the other figures.<br/>
<br/>
The art of drawing in Egypt was hampered from time <span style="color: #0000FF;">immemorial </span>by a number of designs that were mechanically copied again<br/>
and again and that no one ventured to alter. Even the <span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanying </span>inscriptions were held sacred from all changes, although they<br/>
were composed in an old-fashioned language that was almost a dead<br/>
tongue in the later periods. Among the subjects thus stereotyped<br/>
were scenes relating to the intercourse <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the king with the gods (in<br/>
prayers or <span style="color: #ff0000;">saeritiees</span>, etc.), those representing the king smiting his<br/>
enemies, the deceased receiving <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>from his different estates,<br/>
the slaughtering of cattle for <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice</span>, and many others. In the<br/>
pictures of these subjects, therefore, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>the most rigid adherence<br/>
to the above-mentioned rules. But beyond these the Egyptian artists<br/>
had a considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">field </span>for the exercise of their invention, and they<br/>
often displayed great <span style="color: #0000FF;">brilliancy </span>of imagination and observation.<br/>
