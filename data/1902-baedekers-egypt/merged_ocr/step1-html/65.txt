The different strata of the earlier nummulite formation, as well <span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>those<br/>
of the upper chalk, are here exposed to view, and generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">contain </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous </span>fossils. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">oases</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>particularly those of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diikhel </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ehiirgeh</span>,<br/>
are remarkable for their fossil wealth. The soil of the deep depressions<br/>
in which these <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases </span>lie, partly below the level of the Nile, consists of<br/>
the variegated clayey or sandy strata of the upper chalk. The ground<br/>
is strongly impregnated with alum at places. Numerous thermal springs<br/>
well up from the upper strata of the chalk, and the soil thus irrigated is<br/>
luxuriantly clothed with vegetation, The barrier of Nubian sandstone<br/>
which abuts on the valley of the Nile at Silsileh extends far into the<br/>
Libyan desert. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">forum </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">southwestern </span>boundary of the oases <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofKhitrgeh<br/>

the heart of the desert. This formation <span style="color: #ff0000;">contains </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">si1ieified </span>wood and iron<br/>
and manganese <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ores </span>in abundance. About six days' <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey </span>to the W.<br/>
of the cases begins a complete <span style="color: #0000FF;">ocean </span>of sand. As far as the eye can<br/>
reach we discover <span style="color: #0000FF;">nothing </span>but a vast expanse <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofloose </span>yellow sand, which<br/>
generally forms itself into ranges of sand-hills, many miles in length,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>rising to a height <span style="color: #0000FF;">ot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1500 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ur </span>upwards above the level of<br/>

</span>The oasis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fardfm </span>lies in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">recess </span>eroded in the nummulite limestone. To the N. and W. of Farafra extends the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eocene </span>limestone plateau<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>far as the neighbourhood of Siam, between which oasis <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Bahriyeh<br/>

of recent tertiary deposits, the fossil wealth of which was once <span style="color: #0000FF;">extolled<br/>

d. Agriculture and Vegetation.<br/>
<br/>
I. CAPABILITIES OF THE SOIL. In the time of the Pharaohs the<br/>
Egyptian agricultural year was divided into three equal parts,<br/>
the period of the inundation (from the end of June to the end of<br/>
October), that of the growing of the crops (from the end of <span style="color: #ff0000;">oetober </span>to the end of February), and that Of the harvest (from the<br/>
end of February to the end of <span style="color: #0000FF;">June</span>). At the present day there are<br/>
two principal seasons, <span style="color: #0000FF;">corresponding </span>to our summer and winter,<br/>
besides which there is a short additional season, corresponding with<br/>
the late summer or early autumn of the European year. The land<br/>
is extremely fertile, but it is not so incapable of exhaustion as it is<br/>
sometimes represented to be. Many of the crops, as elsewhere, must<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>be <span style="color: #0000FF;">followed </span>by a fallow period; others thrive only when<br/>
a certain rotation is observed (such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">wheat</span>, followed by clover and<br/>
beans); and some fields require to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">artifieially </span>manured. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Occasionally </span>two crops are yielded by the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">field </span>in the same season<br/>
(wheat and <span style="color: #0000FF;">saffron</span>, wheat and clover, etc.) The great extension within the last thirty or forty years of the cultivation of the sugar-cane,<br/>
which requires a great deal <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">moisture</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eotton-plant</span>, which<br/>
requires extremely little, has necessitated considerable modifieations<br/>
in the modes <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">irrigation </span>and cultivation hitherto in use. As both of<br/>
these crops are of a very exhausting character, the land must either<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>more frequently left fallow, or must be <span style="color: #ff0000;">artifleially </span>manured. The<br/>
industry and powers of endurance of the Egyptian peasantry are<br/>
thus most severely tried, although the homogeneous soil of the<br/>
