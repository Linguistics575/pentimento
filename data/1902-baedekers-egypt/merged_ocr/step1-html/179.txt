<br/>
In the period of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulunides</span>, when <span style="color: #0000FF;">Persian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i11f111enee </span>made<br/>
itself felt even in the religious conceptions of Egypt, portraits were<br/>
painted and coloured wooden statues erected in the palaces, and<br/>
there was even a factory for figures of animals in Cairo. But no<br/>
long period elapsed before the prohibition contained in the Sunna<br/>
against the representation of any living being again came into force.<br/>
Representations of this kind are therefore very rare, and are now<br/>
to be found preserved only in the low reliefs carved by Persian<br/>
sculptors of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shi'ite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sect</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Statues and paintings have disappeared<br/>
without leaving a trace. Painting and sculpture in modern Egyptian art have been reserved exclusively for the decoration of <span style="color: #ff0000;">wallsurfaces</span>.<br/>

<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRANSLITERATION </span>of Arabic vocal sounds<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>so intensely different<br/>
from our <span style="color: #0000FF;">own</span>, in the ordinary Latin alphabet is rendered additionally<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">varied </span>international relations of Egypt. In maps and <span style="color: #0000FF;">plans</span>,<br/>
in railway <span style="color: #0000FF;">time-tables</span>, and in other publications we <span style="color: #0000FF;">tind </span>the transliteration<br/>
differing <span style="color: #0000FF;">widely </span>according as the French or the English view has been<br/>
adopted. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">this </span>Handbook we have <span style="color: #0000FF;">transliterated </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">consonantal </span>sounds<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>far as possible according to English usage (<span style="color: #0000FF;">6.9.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>instead of the French<br/>
ch), hut have deemed it advisable to follow the Italian or Continental<br/>
sounds of the vowels (ah, eh, ee, o, oo). Thus: <span style="color: #0000FF;">emir</span>, which is pronounced<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'aymeerr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sh√©kh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>sheikh), <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronounced'shake</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>(with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>guttural k); <span style="color: #ff0000;">ttrrort<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">article </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">unassimilated</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">2.9. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eGt'ds </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">indeed </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">er-Ms </span>(comp.<br/>

<br/>
Arabic belongs to the Semitic group of languages, and has no<br/>
relationship with the tongues of Europe<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A knowledge of Hebrew,<br/>
however, will materially facilitate the learning of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabia </span>The<br/>
golden era of Arabic literature is coeval with the introduction of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1ll-LMrn</span>, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iiorin </span>in the dialect of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jiuredsh </span>(the<br/>
family of Mohammed) is still regarded as an unrivalled model of<br/>
style and language. But by the side of <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">literary </span>Arabic flourished<br/>
also various colloquial dialects, which were carried by the Arabs<br/>
into the various provinces conquered for the Crescent, and there<br/>
developed partly under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the old local tongues. In<br/>
this way arose the vulgar dialects of Arabic, of which that spoken<br/>
in Egypt is one. In writing, however, an attempt was made to<br/>
retain the older forms, and the written language of the present day,<br/>
known as Middle Arabic, occupies a position midway between the<br/>
original classical tongue <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the popular dialects.<br/>
<br/>
'Egypt was conquered by the Arabs in the 19th <span style="color: #ff0000;">year </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hegira </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">640 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">D.</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">A.D.j </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span>language was replaced by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabic</span>. The dialect of the latter developed in the valley of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
