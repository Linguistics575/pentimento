<span>of Cairo. OLD CAIRO. <span style="color: #0000FF;">g</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Route. 71<br/>
<br/>
distinct quarter of the town, almost exclusively inhabited by Copts<br/>
and now known as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kasa- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oli-8liamra</span>. It is built within the<br/>
girdle-wall of the ancient Roman Castle of Babylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>pp. 32, <span style="color: #ff0000;">73 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>.<br/>
Here, enclosed by a dense <span style="color: #0000FF;">mass </span>of houses, is situated the much<br/>
frequented Coptic church of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Abu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sergeh </span>(St. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sergius</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>According to a wide-spread belief<br/>
this church was <span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span>before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedan </span>conquest, but this<br/>
can be true of the crypt only<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>According to tradition, the Virgin<br/>
and Child after their flight to Egypt spent a month in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">crypt</span>.<br/>
<br/>
This <span style="color: #0000FF;">church </span>may be regarded as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">original </span>model of the older<br/>
Egyptian-Byzantine churches in which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Comic </span>Christians now<br/>
worship <span style="color: #0000FF;">b</span>. The basilica consists of a nave and aisles, the latter provided with galleries. The nave and tribune have <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>roofs, that of<br/>
the latter being supported by elliptical beams, and both being<br/>
probably of later date than the <span style="color: #0000FF;">church </span>itself. The lofty side-walls<br/>
of the nave consist of two rows of columns, one above the other, the<br/>
columns of the lower row being separated by <span style="color: #ff0000;">keel-arohes</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>while<br/>
the upper series, supporting the gallery, consists of <span style="color: #0000FF;">alternate </span>groups<br/>
of two <span style="color: #0000FF;">marble </span>columns and one pillar of masonry, connected by<br/>
an architrave. The columns <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>marble originally belonged to ancient<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">edifees</span>, and have been placed here without the least regard to their<br/>
suitability in point <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>diameter, form of capital, or other architectural<br/>
features. Two of the three original entrances are now built up, while<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">i. </span>Coptic Worship. On entering the church, the members of the congregation <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>pay their homage to a number of pictures of saints hanging<br/>
on the walls (the veneration of saints <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>of the Virgin being <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>prominent<br/>
feature of the Coptic system), and then kneel before the <span style="color: #ff0000;">altar </span>and kiss<br/>
the hand of the priest. They then take their stand (for there are no seats)<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the part of the church allotted to them, leaning on crutches which<br/>
they bring for the purpose, as the service often lasts for three hours.<br/>
The service begins with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">reading </span>or chanting of <span style="color: #0000FF;">prayers </span>and passages<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gospels</span>, partly in the Coptic language, and partly in Arabic,<br/>
in which the priest is assisted by a schoolmaster and a choir <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>boys.<br/>
During this <span style="color: #ff0000;">performanee </span>the worshippers, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>few exceptions,<br/>
engage freely in conversation. After a time the burning <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofincense </span>begins.<br/>
The priest, swinging his <span style="color: #0000FF;">censer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>leaves the <span style="color: #ff0000;">h√©kal </span>and joins the <span style="color: #0000FF;">congregation</span>, each member of which he blesses, placing his hand on their<br/>
heads. - The Celebration of the Eucharist is very frequent in the Coptic<br/>
churches, Immediately following the ordinary service. <span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On Palm Sunday<br/>
wreaths of palm are blessed by the priest, which are then worn by the<br/>
Copts under their <span style="color: #ff0000;">tarbtuhes </span>during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>of the following year as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">amulets </span>against every misfortune that can befall body <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">soul</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>- On<br/>

men and boys plunge into the large font or bath Which is to be found<br/>
in most Coptic churches, the water having been first blessed by the priest.<br/>
Or they perform the same ceremony in the Nile, into which they first<br/>
pour some <span style="color: #0000FF;">consecrated </span>water. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the eve of this festival, as well as on<br/>
Holy Thursday and on the festival of the Apostles, the priest washes the<br/>
feet of the whole of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">congregation</span>. - An external form to which the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts </span>attach great weight is the observance <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>fasts, and a Copt who is<br/>
negligent in this respect will rarely be met with. On these occasions all<br/>
