<br/>
</span>Adjoining the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khons </span>on the S.W. is a Temple of<br/>
Osiris, built upon a basis about 12 ft. in height, crowned with a<br/>
hollow cornice. The keeper of the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khons </span>will open it on<br/>
request. The entrance is on the W. side; on the jambs appears the<br/>
king before Osiris and other deities. We enter first a Rectangular<br/>
Hall, with a well-preserved ceiling resting upon two columns, with<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Calyx-capitals </span>and heads of Hathor on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">abaei</span>. The grated windows at the top of the S. wall should be noted. To the right lie three<br/>
side-rooms with crypts; the door on the left is built up. - We<br/>
proceed through the central door into a Second <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hail</span>, flanked by two<br/>
side-rooms, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>that to the left contains a representation of the<br/>
dead Osiris upon the bier. We then pass through a door, on the right<br/>
jamb of which appears Opet, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hippopotamus-goddess</span>, and enter<br/>
the Sanctuary. The representations here show us the king (usually<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span>11.) before the gods. From the Sanctuary a flight of steps<br/>
descends to the chambers in the basement and to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">exit-door</span>.<br/>

<br/>
Proceeding through the lanes of Karnak in the direction of the<br/>
Nile, we soon reach the first pylon of the great temple of Ammon,<br/>
The rectangular terrace in front of this was even in antiquity covered<br/>
by the waters of the inundation, as is indicated by marks on its<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">front</span>, recording the height of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inundations </span>under the 21st-26th<br/>
dynasties. On the terrace rises an Obelisk <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofSethos </span>IL, beside which<br/>
is the base of its companion. A row of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Krio-Sphinxes</span>, erected by<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, extended from this point to the portal of the temple of<br/>
Ammon. The fragments of building to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>of the right <span style="color: #ff0000;">pylontower </span>belong to <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>Chapel, erected about 390 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.0</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>by King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Akhoris<br/>
</span>and his successor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Psammuthis</span>. In the interior <span style="color: #0000FF;">Psammuthis </span>appears<br/>
offering incense to the boat of Ammon.<br/>
<br/>
The great <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Temple </span>of Ammon, the'Throne of the World' as it<br/>
was officially styled, was not built on any single uniform plan, but<br/>
owes its present form to the building activity of many successive<br/>
rulers of Egypt. From the Middle Empire to the Ptolemaic period<br/>
most of the Pharaohs took some share in adding to or adorning this<br/>
shrine, rivalling each other in the magnitude of their designs. The<br/>
foundation of the temple must be dated not later than the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>monarchs of the 12th Dynasty. When Thutmosis I. ascended the<br/>
throne and made Thebes his capital, the original modest shrine<br/>
seemed no longer worthy of the dignity of the god, and the king<br/>
therefore added two colonnades and two pylons (Nos. y and IV) in<br/>
front of the temple. In the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maker√© </span>alterations and additions<br/>
were made in the interior only (on each side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sanctuary</span>), and<br/>
these were continued under her brother Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, when he<br/>
became sole monarch. Thutmosis furthermore erected a separate<br/>
