to supersede the ancient law, and to introduce a <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>European<br/>
system <span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">xi</span>).<br/>
<br/>
With regard to theological, legal, and still more to ritualistic<br/>
questions, <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Islam </span>has not always been free from dissension. There<br/>
are in the first place four Orthodox sects, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">J.1aneftes</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Share'ites</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Malekites</span>, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hambalites</span>, named after their founders.<br/>
In addition to these must be mentioned the schools of Free <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thinkers</span>, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">sprang </span>up at an early period, partly owing to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence<br/>
</span>of Greek philosophy. The orthodox party, however, triumphed, not<br/>
only over these heretics, but also in its struggle against the voluptuousness and luxury of the most glorious period of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">khalifs</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ascetism </span>and fanaticism were also largely developed among<br/>
professors of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-hom</span>, and another phase of religious thought <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>pure MYSTICISM, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">arose </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el1ieflyinPersia</span>. The mystics (<span style="color: #ff0000;">y1fi</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">interpret </span>many texts of the Koran allegorically, and their system therefore frequently degenerated into Pantheism. It was by mystics who<br/>
still remained within the pale of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>such as the famous <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ibn<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e1-'Arabi</span>, born in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1164</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>that the Orders of Dervishes were founded.<br/>
<br/>
Dervishes (<span style="color: #ff0000;">dartoith</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">plur</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">dardwish</span>). That earthly life is worthless, that<br/>
it is a delusion, and at best a period of probation, are sentiments of<br/>
frequent recurrence in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fortud </span>This pessimist view of life has been<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmed </span>by Mohammed's conception of the Supreme Being, on whose<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">awe-inspiring </span>attributes he has <span style="color: #ff0000;">chiefly </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ilwelt</span>, thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">filling </span>his adherents<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a profound dread of their Creator. The result of this doctrine was<br/>
to induce devout persons to retire altogether from the wicked world, the<br/>
scene of vanity and disappointment, and to devote themselves to the practice of ascetic exercises, with a view to ensure their happiness in <span style="color: #ff0000;">aiuture<br/>
</span>state. The fundamental aim of this asceticism was to strive after a<br/>
knowledge of God by cultivating a kind of <span style="color: #ff0000;">half-oonseious </span>and ecstatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">exaltation </span>of mind. A mystic love of <span style="color: #0000FF;">God </span>was deemed the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">passport<br/>
</span>which enabled the worshipper to fall into this ecstatic trance, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>to lose<br/>
himself so <span style="color: #0000FF;">completely </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">contemplatiOn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>to destroy his own individuality<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">fund</span>) and blend it with <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>of the Deity (<span style="color: #ff0000;">ittiluid</span>). <span style="color: #ff0000;">As </span>in Europe the<br/>
monastic system and the mendicant <span style="color: #0000FF;">orders </span>sprang from the example of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">penitents </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">hermits </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>had renounced the world, so in the Mohammedan<br/>
world asceticism was rapidly developed into an organised system <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofmendieaney</span>. At an early period many noble thinkers (such as the Persians<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'di </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wdlz</span>) and talented poets enrolled themselves in the ranks of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ascetics</span>, but the dervishes <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the present day have entirely lost the spirit<br/>
of their prototypes, and have retained nothing <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>the mere physical capacity for throwing themselves into a mechanical <span style="color: #0000FF;">state </span>of ecstasy and <span style="color: #0000FF;">rendering </span>themselves proof against external sensations..<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>following are the principal orders of dervishes <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">garilrat </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ed-dardwish</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>

blue <span style="color: #0000FF;">turbans</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">best-known </span>sects of this order are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Utdd'Ilwdn</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">or'lluuiniyeh </span>Dervishes, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'diyeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dervishes</span>. The former are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">noted </span>for their extraordinary performances at festivals, such as thrusting<br/>
iron nails into their eyes and arms, breaking large stones against their<br/>
chests, as they lie on their backs on the ground, and swallowing burning<br/>
charcoal and fragments of glass. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sa'iltyeh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>usually carry<br/>
green flags, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">snake-charmers </span>(p. xxiv), and on the Friday on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>the birthday of the prophet is celebrated used to allow their <span style="color: #ff0000;">sh√©kh </span>to<br/>
