<br/>
existence of these is due to modifieations of the original plan or to<br/>
later <span style="color: #0000FF;">alterations </span>(p. 115). The recess or the <span style="color: #0000FF;">room </span>in which <span style="color: #0000FF;">streets<br/>
</span>were offered to the dead in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastabas </span>was represented in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case<br/>
</span>of the pyramids by a small detached temple on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>side, remains<br/>
of which have been discovered in various instances (p. 120).<br/>
<br/>
The custom of placing their tombs beside that of the monarch<br/>
was gradually abandoned by the nobles at the close of the Ancient<br/>
Empire; they preferred to be buried near their own homes. Like<br/>
the Pharaohs they built for themselves small <span style="color: #0000FF;">briek-pyramids </span>upon<br/>
square or <span style="color: #0000FF;">rectangular </span>bases. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The.tomb-eharnber </span>was formed in the<br/>
thickness of the wall and a tombstone was placed on the outside,<br/>
before which the survivors recited their prayers or presented their<br/>
offerings. But the high and steep <span style="color: #ff0000;">ileelivity </span>of the desert-plateau<br/>
did <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>always offer space enough for such <span style="color: #0000FF;">free-standing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>and<br/>
at various points <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ag</span>. Benihasan, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assimi</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>, etc.) graves were<br/>
hewn in the rock, a practice of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>there were isolated examples<br/>
even under the Ancient Empire <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>. 128). In accordance with the<br/>
fundamental conception of the tomb as the House <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Dead, each<br/>
grave must contain the <span style="color: #0000FF;">three </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">principal </span>divisions of the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt.ian </span>dwelling-house - the open <span style="color: #0000FF;">court</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the broad hall, and the deep<br/>
and narrow eating-room. Thus a Fore Court, surrounded with a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">brick-wall</span>, was provided in the open air in front of the tomb,<br/>
generally ending in a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>with two pillars or columns<br/>
hewn in the solid rock. Beyond this was a large Chamber with<br/>
columns, followed by a small Chamber or Recess, which contained<br/>
the statue of the deceased, frequently accompanied by that of his<br/>
wife, hewn out of the rock, and thus corresponded to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">serdab </span>of<br/>
the old mastabas.<br/>
<br/>
This dwelling-house arrangement is most distinctly seen in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">roek-tombs </span>of Benihasan and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan </span>(comp. pp. 197, <span style="color: #ff0000;">332 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">inner </span>walls are covered with inscriptions and representations, which,<br/>
though more varied in subject than those of the earlier tombs, agree<br/>
with them in being intended to provide for the enjoyment of the<br/>
deceased. The unembellished <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus-chamber </span>was reached<br/>
by a perpendicular shaft hewn in the rock from the first hall.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOMBS </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE NEW EMPIRE coincide in their general <span style="color: #0000FF;">features </span>with those of the Middle Empire. At this date also <span style="color: #ff0000;">bothfreestanding </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-hewn </span>tombs occur, according to the nature of the<br/>
site at <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>places. The former variety of tomb is now, however,<br/>
represented by very scanty remains. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-tombs </span>a narrow<br/>
corridor is frequently found between the first hall and the inner<br/>
chamber with the statues; for their general arrangement and decoration, see the remarks <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p.262</span>. About the middle of the 18th Dyn.<br/>
the Pharaohs also ceased to build pyramids as their last resting<br/>
places, and prepared their tombs in the slopes of a sequestered<br/>
mountain-valley on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span>bank of the Nile near Thebes. These<br/>
ROYAL <span style="color: #0000FF;">ToMBs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE NEW EMPIRE comprised long corridors and<br/>
