brilliant colours (Fig. NI <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>. The low square abacus, which under the<br/>
New <span style="color: #0000FF;">Empire </span>was covered with inscriptions only, was at the same<br/>
time developed into a cubical block and somewhat inappropriately<br/>
decorated with representations of the gods, figures of Bes, or heads<br/>
of Hathor.<br/>
<br/>
Besides those <span style="color: #0000FF;">plant-eral-s </span>other varieties occur. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sistrum </span>Columns have round shafts crowned on four sides<br/>
with the head of the goddess Hathor (with cows' <span style="color: #0000FF;">ears</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, above which<br/>
was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-like </span>addition. These are exclusively <span style="color: #0000FF;">confined </span>to<br/>
temples of female deities, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>most numerous in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemaie<br/>
</span>period; they are doubtless reproductions <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>sistrum, the peculiar<br/>
rattle used by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Women </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cxxxiii </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Columns </span>with<br/>
inverted Calyx Capitals, occurring in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>ill.<br/>
at Karnak, are quite unique, and are probably imitations of the<br/>
<br/>
shape of the old wooden <span style="color: #0000FF;">supports</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Comparatively </span>few of the ancient Egyptian Secular Buildings<br/>
have been preserved. The number of ruined towns is not, indeed,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant</span>; but the remains of the earlier houses are almost invariably concealed by those of later date and are thus very <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to examine. The remains of earlier houses have come down to<br/>
us directly in only a few exceptional instances, as at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kahiln </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">180 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]<br/>
</span>and Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'Amarna </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>203). These, in connection <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>representations preserved <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the monuments, afford us some knowledge<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">structure </span>and interior arrangements of Egyptian PRIVATE<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">HOUSES</span>, which in many respects were identical with the Arab<br/>
houses of modern Egypt (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">clxiv</span>). The house of the humble<br/>
farmer or <span style="color: #ff0000;">artizan </span>was as simple then as it is to-day. An open court,<br/>
in which the family spent the day, was adjoined by a few dark<br/>
sleeping-rooms and stables for <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>cattle, while a staircase led from<br/>
the court to the flat roof, upon which a few smaller apartments<br/>
were often found. The houses of the more <span style="color: #0000FF;">prosperous </span>Egyptians<br/>
also had a court as their central point, at the back of which was a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>vestibule of light columns, open in front, <span style="color: #0000FF;">affording<br/>
</span>protection from the sun. Thence a door led to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>wide hall, the roof<br/>
of which rested on columns, and beyond that was a narrow and larger<br/>
hall, also with <span style="color: #ff0000;">calumne7 </span>probably used as the eating-room. Beyond<br/>
that again were other apartments <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bedrooms</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>for the master of the<br/>
house and his <span style="color: #ff0000;">grown-up </span>sons. On one side of the three principal<br/>
divisions of the house (court, broad hall, narrow <span style="color: #ff0000;">hall</span>) were the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Women </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>apartments, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">harim </span>(harem), the middle point of which<br/>
was another open <span style="color: #ff0000;">court</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>side were the slaves' <span style="color: #0000FF;">apartments</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">store-rooms</span>, the kitchens, and the stables This <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrangement </span>of the Egyptian dwelling-house was probably the same<br/>
in essential details at all periods, and even in the ROYAL PALACES<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span>. at Tell er-'Amarna) the three principal divisions occur in the<br/>
same order. The walls of the houses and palaces were built of un<br/>
