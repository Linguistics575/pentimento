<span>Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>ABYDOS. 20<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Route<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>223<br/>
<br/>
with seven columns, which was never completed. The sculptures<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphies </span>were sketched in colour under Sethos, and only a<br/>
few of them were afterwards finished as reliefs'en <span style="color: #ff0000;">oreux</span>'. They<br/>
represent Sethos <span style="color: #ff0000;">saeritieing</span>. The scenes in the lower row depict the<br/>
slaughter and cutting up of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>animals. The screens were<br/>
intended to veil the proceedings in the court from <span style="color: #0000FF;">theRings</span>' Gallery.<br/>
<br/>
Adjoining this court are four <span style="color: #ff0000;">unflnished </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. A, B, C, D)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In<br/>
the three <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>the designs on the walls are merely sketched in; in D they<br/>
have been completed in colour. - Rooms E-I lie one story higher and<br/>
can <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>entered only from the outside. <span style="color: #0000FF;">H </span>and I are <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>with rubbish,<br/>
E-G contain unfinished representations dating from the reign <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Merenptah</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Returning now to the second hypostyle hall, we may pay a brief<br/>
visit to the Chamber which adjoins it on the left and was dedicated<br/>
to Ptah-Sokaris, god of the dead at Memphis. The roof is supported<br/>
by three simple columns without capitals (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">220 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. The fine reliefs<br/>
show Sethos revering <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sokaris</span>, Nefertem, and other gods.<br/>
<br/>
Opening <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>this chamber are two small <span style="color: #0000FF;">vaulted </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pels</span>; that to the<br/>
right dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sokaris</span>, that to the left to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neferte</span>. On the left wall<br/>
of the former is a relief of Horus and Isis by the bier of Osiris, on Whose<br/>
mummy sits a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sparrow-hawk </span>(Isis); <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the right wall are Isis and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hy </span>the bier of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sokaris-Osiris</span>, whose left hand is raised to his brow.<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes to the N. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Temple of Sethos I. lies the<br/>
Temple of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, which also was <span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicated </span>to Osiris. It is in<br/>
a very ruinous state, but still presents many features of interest.<br/>
The scanty traces of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">spacious </span>court may be made out in front of<br/>
the present <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance</span>. Within, the ground-plan of a peristyle court<br/>
(decorated with Osiris-columns like the Ramesseum, p. 284), two<br/>
halls, the sanctuaries beyond them, and various other rooms can still<br/>
be traced; but the average height of the remaining walls is only<br/>
5-6 ft. To judge by the extant remains, this temple was a much<br/>
more sumptuous and more carefully built structure <span style="color: #ff0000;">than </span>any of the<br/>
other buildings of Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">11. </span>known to us. Not only fine-grained<br/>
limestone, but also red and <span style="color: #0000FF;">black </span>granite (for the doors), sandstone<br/>
(for <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>columns), and alabaster [ for the innermost shrine) were used<br/>
in its construction. The still brilliantly coloured mural decorations<br/>
in the rear-rooms are executed in delicate low relief recalling the<br/>
admirable <span style="color: #0000FF;">sculptures </span>under Sethos <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rude</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>reliefs'en <span style="color: #0000FF;">creux'<br/>
</span>make their appearance only in the court and the first hall, with the<br/>
adjoining rooms. The reliefs in the first court represent a grand<br/>
procession.<br/>
<br/>
On the right (<span style="color: #ff0000;">N.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>wall peasants are shown bringing oxen, <span style="color: #0000FF;">antelopes</span>,<br/>
geese, and other animals to four priests, of whom the first records the<br/>
gifts, while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>offers incense; farther to the right, the animals are<br/>
being slaughtered. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the left (E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span>S.) walls are similar scenes. To the<br/>
left as we enter are persons with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baerificia1 </span>gifts, who are met <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">procession </span>of priests, soldiers, the royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">war-chariot</span>, captive negroes and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Asiatics</span>, etc. The colouring of the figures is surprisingly well preserved.<br/>
In the rooms behind are much damaged religious representations.<br/>
<br/>
On the outside of the temple, <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>side, is an inscription relating to<br/>
the war waged by Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">ll</span>, against the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hittites</span>; unfortunately <span style="color: #0000FF;">only </span>the<br/>
lower parts of lines are preserved. Adjacent are representations of <span style="color: #0000FF;">events<br/>
</span>in the war, similar to those of the Ramesseum at Thebes (pp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">284</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>285).<br/>
