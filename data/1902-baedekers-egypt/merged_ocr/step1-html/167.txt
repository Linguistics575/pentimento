locks presented him as the ruler of the kingdom of the dead and as<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">benedeent </span>saviour, somewhat as the colossal statue in the Alexandria Museum (central figure in <span style="color: #ff0000;">R. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">11</span>) and the colossal head in the<br/>
Gizeh Museum <span style="color: #0000FF;">J. </span>XL, No. 306) represent him.<br/>
<br/>
The sculptors of SMALLER WORKS OF ART also were at first<br/>
entirely dependent upon the Greek motherland. Thus for terracottas<br/>
they borrowed models from Tanagra, so that numerous Egyptian<br/>
terracottas have been found absolutely identical with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-known<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tanagra </span>figures. The best specimens from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropoles </span>of Alexandria are to be seen in the museum of that city (Room <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, Case BB,<br/>
lower shelf). But it was just in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>studios of these sculptors that<br/>
an independent spirit manifested itself at a very early date. Their<br/>
art emancipated itself from the imported forms and motives, and<br/>
found a new method of expression for fresh materials supplied<br/>
directly from the experiences and environment of the artists. This<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiarly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrian </span>art shows a character in complete <span style="color: #0000FF;">contrast<br/>
</span>with the above-mentioned ideal school; its basis is the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncompromising </span>Realism. Its favourite subjects, frequently treated in a<br/>
humorous or satirical vein, were common scenes from the street<br/>
life of the metropolis, which seems in many points to have been<br/>
similar to that of the modern Arab quarters of Cairo and Alexandria.<br/>
Thus, for example, in a bronze group from the Delta (now in the<br/>
Polytechnic at Athens) we see a Nubian <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruit-seller </span>crouching on the<br/>
ground and snatching a siesta behind his tastefully arranged wares,<br/>
while an ape, seated on his shoulder, carries <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">investigations </span>in his<br/>
master's hair. Another bronze, of similar origin and in the same<br/>
collection, represents a slave, with the typical head of the Akka<br/>
negroes somewhat <span style="color: #0000FF;">caricatured</span>, hastily devouring a stolen piece of<br/>
meat. From the same place also comes the basalt figure (now at<br/>
Athens) of a Nubian boy carrying a burden on his raised left hand,<br/>
while the elbow is supported on the hip, in a manner customary to<br/>
this day. These three statuettes are masterpieces, not only in technique but even more in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">keen </span>conception and reproduction of<br/>
racial characteristics. Numerous specimens of similar <span style="color: #ff0000;">street-tis<br/>
</span>will be found among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek </span>terracottas in the museums at Cairo<br/>
and Alexandria. We can best see what were the favourite subjects<br/>
of the Alexandrian <span style="color: #0000FF;">sculptors</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and how they were treated, from those<br/>
familiar works of humbler art; from the designs on terracotta lamps;<br/>
and from the small bronze figures which are found in great numbers<br/>
in the Nile Delta. These small works had, of course, their models<br/>
in the higher branches; comp. the realistic figure of a woman in the<br/>
museum at Alexandria (Room <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, Case AA, No. 1401). Many of the<br/>
motives would be well adapted for fountain-figures, if executed on<br/>
a larger scale, and they were probably originally devised for this<br/>
purpose; <span style="color: #ff0000;">6.9.</span>, the recumbent figure of a Satyr leaning on his wineskin, and causing a jet of water to issue from it (Gizeh Museum at<br/>
Cairo). Many subjects again were taken from the theatre and the<br/>
