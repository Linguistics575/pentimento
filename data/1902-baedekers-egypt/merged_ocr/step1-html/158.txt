<br/>
</span>and artistically worthy from the inferior and mechanical; and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>is increased by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fact </span>that even the best artists were<br/>
unable to <span style="color: #0000FF;">emancipate </span>themselves from certain traditional <span style="color: #ff0000;">peeuliarities </span>of representation. Thus, for example, the head <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>trunk in<br/>
all statues are carved with a strict regard to symmetry, the only<br/>
freedom ever taken being in the arrangement of the arms and legs.<br/>
But this principle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">full-faee </span>symmetry is common to the art of all<br/>
primitive races, and even the Greeks did not finally <span style="color: #ff0000;">ernaueipate<br/>
</span>themselves from it until their plastic art had attained its zenith.<br/>
<br/>
Our unbounded admiration is commanded by the wonderful skill<br/>
with which both <span style="color: #ff0000;">artizan </span>and artist could work the hardest stone<br/>
with comparatively primitive tools. This extraordinary technical<br/>
skill is apparent in all the productions of Egyptian sculpture. But<br/>
the qualities that differentiate the genuine works of art from the<br/>
others are an admirable <span style="color: #0000FF;">fidelity </span>in portraiture and a charming sympathy with nature, which is specially apparent in the representation of animals.<br/>
<br/>
We possess specimens of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">art </span>of even the EARLIEST <span style="color: #0000FF;">PERIOD<br/>
</span>of Egyptian history in the shape of figures of men and animals<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

The statues dating from the end of the 3rd Dyn. are worked in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hard</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">diorite</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>a certain clumsiness that they <span style="color: #0000FF;">display </span>is to be<br/>
explained by the refractory nature <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftheirmaterial</span>. They are mostly<br/>
seated figures of moderate size, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">constrained </span>arrangement <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the limbs; the right hand usually rests <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the breast, the left hand<br/>
upon the thigh. When an inscription occurs it is given in relief.<br/>
But the facial features even in these primitive works are already<br/>
handled with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">portrait-like </span>firmness. About the beginning of the<br/>
4th Dyn. artists began to use the more easily worked limestone<br/>
and even wood, and their <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>immediately received an impetus,<br/>
which reached its zenith during the 5th Dynasty. The Museum at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh </span>contains a number of works of this period, of which the best<br/>
are indicated <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>pp. 79, 80<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In all these statues the chief stress <span style="color: #ff0000;">is<br/>
