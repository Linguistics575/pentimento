<br/>
back as the time <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>IV. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">ea</span>. B.C. 1380) and were again<br/>
made available for sanatory purposes in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1871-72</span>, have a temperature<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">91° </span>Fahr. and resemble those of Harrogate, Aix in Savoy, and<br/>
Hercules-Bad in Hungary in their ingredients. They are <span style="color: #ff0000;">efficaeious<br/>
</span>in cases of rheumatism, skin diseases, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">catarrhs</span>. The Viceregal<br/>
Bath Establishment, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the Moorish style, opened by the Khedive<br/>
in 1899, is excellently equipped, and compares well with the best<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>baths. It contains immersion-baths for fresh, salt, and<br/>
sulphur water, electric baths, hot-air baths, vapour baths, radiant<br/>
heat baths, etc. There are two swimming baths (120 and 90 ft.<br/>
long), filled with running sulphurated and salt water, <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>reserved<br/>
for ladies, the other for gentlemen. There are arrangements also<br/>
for inhalation, massage, and sun and air baths. The interior of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ehedive</span>'s private bath-house may be inspected<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Viceregal Observatory (see p. 77) is being removed from<br/>
Cairo to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helwan</span>, with the addition of many new instruments.<br/>
<br/>
The dry and warm climate is specially adapted for rheumatic,<br/>
pulmonary, and kidney diseases, and for all cases in which cold<br/>
and damp should be avoided (comp. also p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">xxvii</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. Between Nov.<br/>
and Feb. rain falls for a few hours only, and even during the<br/>
inundation, when the lower-lying river-valley is covered with mist<br/>
in the morning and evening, the atmosphere at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helwan </span>is free<br/>
from all perceptible moisture. The mean temperature in winter<br/>
is 610 <span style="color: #ff0000;">5'Fahr.</span>, with a daily range <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">21° </span>(from 51 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">72</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>). The<br/>
amount of daily sunshine averages 8 hrs., and the fall of temperature after sunset is very slight. In consequence of the rocky<br/>
soil and the powerful rays of the sun, the air is extraordinarily<br/>
pure, <span style="color: #0000FF;">dustless</span>, and bracing.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Helwan </span>is within easy reach of Cairo. Excursions may be made<br/>
to the gorge-like valleys of the desert, and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakhara</span>, while the<br/>
banks of the Nile afford good wild-fowl shooting, but the desert<br/>
game is shy and not easily reached.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">quarries </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ma'gnra </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tuna </span>are reached from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Helwan </span>in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">11/2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ride </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dies </span>and matches <span style="color: #0000FF;">should </span>not be forgotten. These quarries,<br/>
which are <span style="color: #0000FF;">still </span>worked, yielded some of the stone used in the construction<br/>
of the Pyramids and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mastahas </span>and other ancient buildings down to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>period. The stone is transported to the bank of the Nile by<br/>
means of tramways, carts, camels, and mules. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabs </span>of the present<br/>
day quarry the stone on the outside of the rocky slopes only, while the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">quarrymen </span>of the Pharaohs penetrated into the interior of the mountain<br/>
and excavated large <span style="color: #ff0000;">chamhers</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>when they came to serviceable <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone</span>. These<br/>
apparently endless <span style="color: #0000FF;">dark </span>rocky halls can <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarcely </span>be trodden without <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>feeling of awe. The roofs are supported by pillars of rock. A few inscriptions, recording the opening of new halls in the quarries, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Borne </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">demotie </span>inscriptions, and reliefs (Kings <span style="color: #ff0000;">AmenemhiU</span>, Amosis, Amenophis <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIL</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekht-Har-ehbét</span>) are still preserved. The Egyptians named these the<br/>
quarries of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ropes </span>(or <span style="color: #0000FF;">f'-roya</span>), which the Greeks corrupted into <span style="color: #ff0000;">Troja</span>, while<br/>
Strabo relates that the village beside the quarries <span style="color: #ff0000;">was'an </span>ancient residence<br/>
of captive Trojans who had followed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menelaus </span>to Egypt and remained there'.<br/>
<br/>
From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helwan </span>an interesting visit may he paid to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wedian </span>(donkey in 1/2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">hr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">provisions </span>and water should be taken), with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fossils<br/>
