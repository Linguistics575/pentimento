<br/>
enclosed sanctuary, within the large temple. We see here first a<br/>
small storeroom, connected by a Corridor (Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>with the W. staircase (p. 230). Thence we enter an open Court, beyond <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>charming <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kiosque</span>, supported by two <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hathor-eolumns </span>and approached<br/>
by seven steps. Here the preliminary celebration for the chief <span style="color: #ff0000;">f11mytion </span>at Dendera, the great new year's festival, was conducted with<br/>
great splendour by the priests of Hathor. The walls of the kiosque<br/>
are embellished with three rows of representations, showing the king<br/>
and various deities in presence of the gods of Dendera. Just above<br/>
the floor is a procession of local deities <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1.</span>, those of Lower Egypt,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">r.</span>, those of Upper Egypt) bearing gifts. On the ceiling the sky<br/>
goddess Newt is depicted with the sun rising from her lap and<br/>
shining upon a head of Hathor that typifies the temple of Dendera.<br/>
<br/>
We now return to the second <span style="color: #ff0000;">autechamber </span>in order to visit<br/>
thence the innermost part of the temple,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'the </span>hidden secret chambers', as they are called in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The central door leads to the profoundly dark Sanctuary, in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the sacred boats with the images of the gods formerly stood.<br/>
The king alone, or his <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacerdotal </span>representative, might enter this<br/>
sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">precinct </span>and in solitude commune with the deity. Only<br/>
once a year was this permitted even to him, at the great festival of<br/>
the New Year. The reliefs on the walls depict the rites which the<br/>
king had to perform on entering the sanctuary, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">saerifiees<br/>
</span>which he had to offer.<br/>
<br/>
There are three rows of BELIEFS, but only the lowest can be <span style="color: #0000FF;">distinctly<br/>
</span>seen even with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">aid </span>of a candle or <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>magnesium lamp. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">reliefs<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>so arranged that each scene on the Left Wall (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. k), beginning at<br/>
the entrance<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>is followed in historical sequence by the corresponding scene<br/>
on the Right <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wall </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1.1</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>1 (left) The king <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascend</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>the steps to the shrine<br/>
of the gods; 2 (right) removes the band <span style="color: #0000FF;">fastening </span>the door<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>3 (1.) <span style="color: #0000FF;">breaks<br/>
</span>the seals on the door; 4 <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>) opens the door; <span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span>1.) gazes upon the goddess; 6 (<span style="color: #0000FF;">In</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">prays </span>to her with his arms hanging <span style="color: #0000FF;">down</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">q </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>1.) offers incense<br/>
before the sacred boats of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Horus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Edfu</span>; and (<span style="color: #0000FF;">N</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>m). To the left,<br/>
the king, before whom is the youthful son of Hathor with <span style="color: #0000FF;">sistrum </span>and<br/>
rattle, presents an image of the goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meat </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Humor </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>; to<br/>
the left, the same ceremony before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Har-sem-tew-ii</span>,<br/>
<br/>
The Sanctuary is surrounded by a Corridor, lighted by apertures in the side-walls and in the ceiling, and entered from the<br/>
second <span style="color: #0000FF;">antechamber </span>by means of two side-doors. Opening off this<br/>
corridor are 11 Small Chambers (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. i-xi), which were used as storerooms and for various rites. Room I, which is embellished with<br/>
reliefs like those in the Sanctuary, contained a shrine with an image<br/>
of Hathor.<br/>
<br/>
Before ascending to the roof of the temple, we should visit the<br/>
subterranean chambers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Crypts, which claim attention not only<br/>
for their remarkable construction but also for the fresh tints of their<br/>
paintings. The temple contains no fewer than 12 Crypts (<span style="color: #ff0000;">or14<br/>
</span>if we reckon separately the parts of <span style="color: #ff0000;">those </span>that are divided), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Collstructed </span>in the thickness of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-wells </span>in different stories,<br/>
