off, and the reddish tint which enlivened the face has almost disappeared. A fragment of the beard lies on the ground beside the<br/>
Sphinx. But in spite of <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">injuries</span>, it preserves an impressive<br/>
expression of strength <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>majesty: the eyes have a thoughtful, faraway <span style="color: #0000FF;">expression</span>, the lips wear a half-smile, and the whole face, as<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">even'Alodellatif </span>remarked, is of graceful and beautiful type. The<br/>
entire height of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monument</span>, from the crown <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the head to the<br/>
pavement on which the fore-legs of the lion <span style="color: #0000FF;">reit</span>, is said to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>66 ft.<br/>
The ear, according to Mariette, is 41/2 ft., the nose 5 ft. 7 in., and<br/>
the mouth 7ft. 7 in. in length; and the extreme breadth of the<br/>
face is 13 ft. 8 inches. If the traveller stands on the upper part<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ear</span>, he cannot stretch his hand as far as the crown of the<br/>
head. There is a hollow in the head.<br/>
<br/>
The Excavation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Sphinx, so far as is now <span style="color: #0000FF;">known</span>, was first undertaken by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>IV. (see below)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>During the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>and Roman<br/>
periods the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossus </span>was several times restored, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>highly admired<br/>
and revered, as numerous inscriptions upon it testify. It is all the more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">curious</span>, therefore, that the Sphinx is mentioned neither by Herodotus nor<br/>
by any later Greek traveller. The mutilations which now <span style="color: #0000FF;">disfigure </span>it date<br/>
from the Arab domination. In 1380 it fell a victim to the iconoclastic zeal<br/>
of a fanatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">shekh</span>, and it was afterwards used as a target by the barbarous<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>In the present century, the Sphinx was first <span style="color: #0000FF;">completely<br/>
</span>excavated by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cavigh'a </span>(p. 116), at the cost (<span style="color: #ff0000;">3505</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>) of an English society.<br/>
He discovered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight </span>of steps which ascended to the stupendous monument, and also found between the paws of the lion a carefully laid<br/>
pavement, at the end of which next to the breast of the Sphinx rose a<br/>
kind of open temple. The latter was enclosed by two partitions, through<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>ran a passage, in the middle of which was a small <span style="color: #ff0000;">fig11re </span>of a recumbent lion, facing the Sphinx. In the background and at each side were<br/>
memorial stones erected by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>IV. and Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">U</span>. (see below). The<br/>
Sphinx has also been excavated by Mariette, and in 1883 by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maspero</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Between the paws of the Sphinx, which are concealed by blocks<br/>
of limestone, stands an Altar, and in front of the breast of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colossus </span>is the Memorial Stone of Thutmosis IV., both of red granite.<br/>
<br/>
On the upper part of the latter, to the right and left, appears Thutmosis IV., <span style="color: #ff0000;">sacaOeing </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>, who is represented <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sphinx </span>The inscription below relates that the Pharaoh while <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">prince<br/>
</span>hunting lions fell asleep one day in the shadow of the Sphinx, and that<br/>
the god appeared and <span style="color: #0000FF;">commanded </span>the prince to'free him from the desert<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sand </span>that encumbered him'. As soon as Thutmosis ascended the throne,<br/>
he <span style="color: #0000FF;">remembered </span>his dream and caused the Sphinx to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>excavated.<br/>
<br/>
About 50 yds. to the S.E. of the Sphinx is situated the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Granite<br/>
</span>Temple, erroneously called Temple of the Sphinx, but in reality the<br/>
sanctuary <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>god <span style="color: #ff0000;">8oharis- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Osiris</span>. This large building constructed<br/>
of granite and alabaster, discovered by Mariette in 1803, is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine<br/>
</span>example of the simple and majestic architecture of a period when<br/>
the art of working the hardest kinds of stone had already attained<br/>
perfection. The exterior of the temple is still concealed by rubbish,<br/>
but the interior has been partly excavated.<br/>
<br/>
Descending by a modern Passage (P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ea</span>) in steps, protected by<br/>
walls against the encroachment of the sand, we pass through a door<br/>
into a Passage <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cor</span>) descending towards the E., <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">8in</span>. in width<br/>
