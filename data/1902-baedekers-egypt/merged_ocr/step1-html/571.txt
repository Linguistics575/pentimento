<br/>
as <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Asasif</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">roek-tombs </span>in which date mostly from the beginning of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seite </span>period (25th and 26th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dyn</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>Various brick-buildings <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>a large arched doorway of unburned bricks are also noticed.<br/>
The latter, built by the Theban prince <span style="color: #ff0000;">Men-tem-lm </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">28th </span>Dyn.),<br/>
belonged to a large building, the bricks of Which were used to build<br/>
the Coptic convent at Dér el-b ahri (p. 279). The tombs usually consist<br/>
of an open court, reached by a flight of steps, whence a door admits<br/>
to a large hall, beyond which are the inner passages and <span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Peteamenopé </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">inaccessibleat </span>present), a high official under<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nth </span>Dyn., is larger than any of the kings' tombs at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bttytrrt-el-Mult1k</span>,<br/>
being 862 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in length and 2660 sq. <span style="color: #ff0000;">yds</span>. in area. All the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span>are ornamented with carefully executed inscriptions and reliefs, now unfortunately<br/>
much injured and blackened. These, almost without <span style="color: #0000FF;">exception</span>, refer to<br/>
the fate of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">soul </span>after death.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Off </span>the same court as the above opens also the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wah-eh-ri</span>.<br/>
Among the other tombs of the same epoch may be mentioned that of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ebé</span>, a little to the N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">EhE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Was </span>an <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>in the reign of Nitocris,<br/>

6, The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum</span>.<br/>
<br/>
This temple may be reached from the landing-place on the W. bank<br/>
in about <span style="color: #0000FF;">U</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>hr.-, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet<br/>
</span>Habu <span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dér </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-hehri </span>in about 20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
The "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum</span>, the large temple built by Ramses II. on the<br/>
W. bank and dedicated to Ammon, is unfortunately only half<br/>
preserved. We may in all probability identify it with the'Tomb of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">anmundyas</span>' described by the Augustan historian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus</span>, although<br/>
his description does not tally in all points with the extant remains.<br/>
Strabo seems to have referred to it briefly as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnonium</span>, or<br/>
building of Memnon.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Osymandyas </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>a corrupt form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">User-ma-ré</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pranomen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramses </span>II.<br/>
<br/>
We begin our inspection at the great Pylon, which formed the<br/>
E. entrance to the temple. This was originally 220 ft. broad, but<br/>
its ruined exterior is now more like a quarry than a building. Many<br/>
representations on the broad surface of its W. Side, next the first<br/>
court, are in fair preservation and easily recognizable with an <span style="color: #ff0000;">operaglass </span>(especially by afternoon-light). They refer to the Syrian<br/>
campaigns of Ramses IL, especially to the war with the Hittites in<br/>
the 5th year of his reign, which is also commemorated on the pylon<br/>
at Luxor (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">240</span>).<br/>
<br/>
On the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ar</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Wing, to the extreme left, we observe the Asiatic fortresses,<br/>
taken by Ramses in the 8th year of his reign. Thirteen of the original<br/>
eighteen are still recognizable, each with an <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>containing its<br/>
name. The captives are led by Egyptian princes. In the Middle, below,<br/>
is the Egyptian army on the march, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">infantry </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">charioteers </span>in two<br/>
rows, with traces of an inscription at the foot; above appears the Egyptian<br/>
camp, within a rampart of shields, presenting an animated scene<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chariots </span>are drawn up in long lines, while the unharnessed horses are<br/>
being foddered; close by are the heavy <span style="color: #ff0000;">baggege-waggons </span>with their teams<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>unperturbed by the great lion of the king, which reclines before him. The<br/>
asses employed in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">commissariat </span>service of the army are conspicuous<br/>
