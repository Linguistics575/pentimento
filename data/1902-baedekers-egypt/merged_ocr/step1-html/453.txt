<br/>
</span>Egypt, not only on account <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftheir </span>remarkable architectural features, but also for the manifold representations of scenes from the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">domestic </span>life of the early Egyptians.<br/>
<br/>
The tombs, 39 in all, are arranged in a row in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rocket </span>and are<br/>
now distinguished by conspicuous red numbers. The best examples are<br/>
secured by iron doors against the vandalism <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the natives, from which<br/>
they had previously suffered. The tombs were most recently carefully<br/>
examined and cleared of rubbish by Mr. Percy E. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Newherry</span>, at the cost<br/>
of the Egypt Exploration Fund. Travellers whose time is limited <span style="color: #0000FF;">may<br/>
</span>content themselves with a visit <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>the four chief tombs (Nos. 17, 15, 3, 2).<br/>
For remarks on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>of the tombs, see pp. 287, <span style="color: #ff0000;">288<br/>
