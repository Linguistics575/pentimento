<br/>
by an unadorned doorway<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>while neither minaret nor dome rose<br/>
above the long straight walls. It was not until the Egyptians beheld<br/>
the buildings of the Crusaders in Syria and Palestine that they began to elaborate the <span style="color: #0000FF;">facades </span>of their mosques. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Irtherto </span>smooth<br/>
walls were now interrupted by <span style="color: #0000FF;">panels </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>fields, receding about 8 <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>10 inches, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">age </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n </span>brought forward to the level of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade </span>by<br/>
smooth slanting surfaces immediately below the unobtrusive battlemented main cornice. In these panels were placed the windows<br/>
(rectangular or arched), frequently arranged in pairs with a smaller<br/>
circular or <span style="color: #0000FF;">star-shaped </span>window above, usually closed with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kumarfyeh<br/>
</span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">olxvi</span>). The main portal was a deep rectangular recess, with a<br/>
stone bench on either side, and terminating at the top in a halfdome, embellished with stalactites. The doorway at the inner end<br/>
of the recess was surmounted by an architrave <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>a relieving <span style="color: #0000FF;">arch</span>,<br/>
often in fantastically waved or broken-arch forms. The door itself,<br/>
often richly panelled, is usually embellished on one side with <span style="color: #ff0000;">emb0ssed </span>or chased bronze decorations<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The threshold generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">consisted </span>of an ancient block of granite. The low railing here (or on<br/>
the steps below) marks the bound <span style="color: #0000FF;">my </span>to which the visitor may<br/>
penetrate without removing his shoes or sandals.<br/>
<br/>
The sanctuary is frequently adjoined by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Turha </span>or Mortuary<br/>
Chapel of the founder. This is usually a square chamber, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Containing </span>a catafalque above the vaulted tombs in which the deceased<br/>
are placed with due attention to the separation of the sexes. The<br/>
chapel is covered by a dome, the transition to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>from the<br/>
square ground-plan is effected by means of a delicately articulated<br/>
intermediate construction, tapering gradually to an octagon. In<br/>
the examples dating from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite </span>period, the pendentives<br/>
corresponding to the four bevelled angles of the intermediate structure retain the large spherical niches borrowed from Roman and<br/>
Byzantine models. These were replaced, under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eyyuhides7 </span>by<br/>
several rows of prism-shaped niches, and finally, under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>, by more or less complicated arrangements of <span style="color: #0000FF;">stalactite-pendentives</span>. These last are formed by a system of gradually projecting<br/>
courses of stone, embellished by dwarf domes and niches exhibiting<br/>
a very great variety of <span style="color: #0000FF;">profile-outline</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest mosques seem to have had <span style="color: #0000FF;">110 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Minarets</span>. The earlier<br/>
examples of these towers were square throughout, tapering upwards, and were covered by a simple conical roof. The later<br/>
examples are square <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the base but assume a cylindrical or polygonal form in the upper stories, and are embellished with galleries<br/>
supported by <span style="color: #0000FF;">stalactite-cornices </span>and with balconies; the top story<br/>
is formed <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>columns or pilasters <span style="color: #0000FF;">bearing </span>a roof consisting of a<br/>
dome-shaped protuberance. The minarets contain winding staircases, two being sometimes arranged round the same newel for the<br/>
convenience of the blind men who are preferred as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mueddins </span>or summoners to prayer. The wooden rods and hooks on the galleries and<br/>
