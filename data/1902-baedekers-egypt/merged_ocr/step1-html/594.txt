Route<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>301<br/>
<br/>
and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ea</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tanet-players </span>in the lower row, should be noticed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>the next scene (2) the king is shown <span style="color: #ff0000;">saeritieing </span>and offering <span style="color: #0000FF;">incense<br/>
</span>before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ithyphallic </span>image of Min. The following scene (3),<br/>
continued on the N.E. wall, exhibits the sacred procession. The<br/>
image of Min is borne on a litter by priests, while <span style="color: #0000FF;">fan-bearers </span>walk<br/>
by the side and priests carrying the sacred caskets follow. In front<br/>
marches the king, who in turn is preceded by a white bull (the<br/>
sacred animal of Min), priests, the queen, and a long procession of<br/>
priests in two rows, carrying standards, temple utensils, and images<br/>
of the king and his ancestors. To the right is the king awaiting the<br/>
procession, with two emblems in front of him<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Priests allow four<br/>
birds to escape (comp. p. 286). Farther to the right (4) the Pharaoh<br/>
cuts with his sickle the sheaf of corn handed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">him </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>a priest (as<br/>
in the Ramesseum, p. 286). Behind him stands the reciting priest,<br/>
who intones a hymn to Min, while another priest presents the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sheaf<br/>
</span>to the god. The queen (above) is also present at this ceremony.<br/>
The white bull again appears in front of the king, and beneath is a<br/>
series of images of the royal ancestors. Finally (5) the king is<br/>
shown offering incense to the god Min standing under a canopy.<br/>
<br/>
The lower series of representations on the N. and N.E. walls are less<br/>
interesting. To the left (under No. I, above) are the sacred boats of Khons,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Milt</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the king sacrifices, to the right (under <span style="color: #0000FF;">No</span>. 2,<br/>
above) priests bear the <span style="color: #0000FF;">boats </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>of the temple, while the king, before<br/>
whom is a fourth boat, approaches to meet them.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S.E</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnades</span>. In the upper rows in these a Festival<br/>
of Ptah-Sokaris is displayed. It begins to the left of the door (Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">6</span>)<br/>
with a train of priests of various forms, bearing sacred boats, images of the gods, standards, and temple utensils. Next appear the<br/>
king and his dignitaries, succeeded (P1. 7) by a colossal symbol of<br/>
the god Nefertem, son of Ptah, borne by eighteen priests. After the<br/>
king (8) come sixteen exalted personages, including the king's sons,<br/>
holding a cord which reaches to the hands of the king. Two priests<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>incense before the king. Then follow sixteen priests (9)<br/>
bearing the boat of Sokaris, followed by the king. The king (10)<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices </span>before the sacred boat; and finally the king before the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ram-headed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnum </span>and two other gods, and before the hawk-headed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sokaris-Osiris</span>, to whom he <span style="color: #ff0000;">offeriy </span>a platter with bread<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>More interesting than these festal representations are the Warlike<br/>
Beliefs, in the lower division on the S. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>. walls. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ist </span>Scene<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. 6) on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>. wall depicts the king attacking the Libyans with<br/>
his charioteers and shooting with his bow. The infantry <span style="color: #0000FF;">fight </span>in<br/>
wild confusion. The Egyptians are assisted by the Shardana <span style="color: #ff0000;">merVceuaries </span>(in the lower row; p. 299). The 2nd Scene shows the return<br/>
of the king from the battle. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He </span>drives in his chariot, with three<br/>
rows of fettered Libyans in front of him, and two fan-bearers behind<br/>
him. 3rd Scene. The king leads the Libyan captives before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon<br/>
</span>and Mut. On the S. wall is a relief <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">7</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>showing the king turning<br/>
round in his chariot to receive the Libyan captives <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">light-red </span>in<br/>
