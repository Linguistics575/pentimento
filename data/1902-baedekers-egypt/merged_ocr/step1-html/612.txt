<br/>
the foundation of the temple, etc. Above are a row of <span style="color: #0000FF;">astronomical<br/>
</span>representations and a frieze consisting of the names of the king<br/>
guarded by two hawks. Close to the pavement we see <span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span>and<br/>
his wife Cleopatra, and a long procession of local deities bringing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>gifts to the three chief gods of Edfu. - To the right and<br/>
left of the entrance are two small Chapels. One (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. d) is <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Con-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">secration </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Chamber</span>', as is indicated by the relief on the rear-wall,<br/>
representing Horus (right) and Thout (left) pouring the consecrated<br/>
water upon the king. The chapel to the right (Pl. e) was the library;<br/>
upon its walls is a catalogue <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>books preserved here. On the left<br/>
wall <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sefkhet</span>, goddess of literature, appears writing upon a palmleaf. - A side-door (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pl</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bl</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>wall of the hall admits to the<br/>
inner passage <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>318) round the temple. <span style="color: #ff0000;">F</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Above the door in the<br/>
N. wall of the vestibule is a curious representation. The sun appears<br/>
with the figure of a winged beetle ascending from the horizon in a<br/>
boat guided by two figures of the hawk-headed Horus. Next the sun,<br/>
on the left, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thouts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0n </span>the right Neith, and also <span style="color: #0000FF;">Welt-wat </span>(as a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">jackal</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meet</span>, and Hathor. In an attitude of worship, at the sides,<br/>
are Four <span style="color: #0000FF;">Senses</span>; to the right sight and hearing, to the left taste<br/>
(symbolized by a tongue) and reason. In front of the last is Ptolemy<br/>
Philopator. To the right stands an altar of dark granite, indicated<br/>
by an inscription as the votive gift of a citizen to Horus of Edfu.<br/>
<br/>
Next follows the Hypostyle Ball, the roof of which is borne<br/>
by 12 columns with rich floral capitals, farther embellished by socalled <span style="color: #0000FF;">heads </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span>. Apertures near the top of the walls and<br/>
square openings in the ceiling admit light to this hall. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>on the walls resemble those of the preceding great vestibule.<br/>
Adjoining are <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">side-chambers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>two of which (P1. XVIII and <span style="color: #ff0000;">aux</span>)<br/>
served as Passage Rooms to the inner passage round the temple, one<br/>
(P1. <span style="color: #ff0000;">XVII</span>) was a Laboratory, while from another (P1. xx) the great E.<br/>
staircase led up to the roof of the temple.<br/>
<br/>
On each side of the adjoining <span style="color: #0000FF;">VESTIBULE </span>I. is an approach to one<br/>
of the Staircases leading to the temple-roof<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The mural reliefs <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the staircases resemble the corresponding reliefs at Dendera (p.219).<br/>
On that on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>(P1. XVI) is a procession of priests ascending,<br/>
headed by the king; on that 011 the W. (P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">arm</span>) is the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">descending</span>. The corridors and chambers on the roof contain nothing<br/>
of interest<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The roof of VESTIBULE II has fallen <span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>To the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>Vestibule Il we enter a small open Court, in which is an elegant little<br/>
Pavilion, open in front, with two columns with floral capitals supporting the roof. Upon the roof is Newt, goddess of the sky, beneath<br/>
whom appear various forms of the sun in boats. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>To the left of<br/>
Vestibule II is a Room (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">X1</span>) dedicated to the god Min.<br/>
<br/>
A door in Vestibule II admits to the Sanctuary, originally <span style="color: #ff0000;">pitchdark</span>, though now the daylight streams in through the broken roof.<br/>
Within stands a granite shrine (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, with a pointed roof, dedicated<br/>
to Horus by King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekht-Har-ehbiit</span>. This also stood in the original<br/>
<br/>
