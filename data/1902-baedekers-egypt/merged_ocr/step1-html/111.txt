HISTORY.<br/>
<br/>
career, however, was terminated by the intervention of<br/>
Russia and France. Syria was secured to Mohammed by<br/>
the peace of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kutdhyeh</span>, but he was obliged to recognise the<br/>
suzerainty of the Porte. At the instigation of the British,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sultan </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mal1mf1d </span>renewed hostilities with Egypt, but he<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>decisively defeated by Ibrahim at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nisibi </span>on 24th <span style="color: #0000FF;">June</span>,<br/>
1839. In consequence of the armed intervention of England and Austria, however, Ibrahim was compelled to<br/>
quit Syria entirely, and Mohammed <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>obliged to yield<br/>
to the Porte a second time. By the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-gallery </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tirmin </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">investiture </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1841 </span>Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abdu'l- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Medjid </span>secured the hereditary sovereignty of Egypt to the family of Mohammed<br/>
'Ali, the pasha <span style="color: #ff0000;">reno11neing </span>his provinces of Syria, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Candie</span>,<br/>
and the Hijaz, and binding himself to pay an annual tribute of 60,000 purses (about <span style="color: #ff0000;">306,000C</span>) to the Porte and<br/>
to reduce his army to 18,000 men. During the last years<br/>
of his life <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammad </span>fell into a state of imbecility. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He<br/>
</span>died on 2nd Aug., 1849, in his palace at Shubra.<br/>
<br/>
Ibrahim, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAli</span>'s adopted son, had already taken<br/>
the reins of government, in consequence of Mohammed's<br/>
incapacity, in Jan., 1848, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>he died in November of<br/>
the same year, and before his adoptive father.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Abbas </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, a son <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tustin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">xcix</span>), had all the dislike of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">true<br/>
</span>son of the desert for European innovations. He, however,<br/>
maintained the strictest discipline among his <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieials</span>, and<br/>
the public security in Egypt was never greater than during his reign. His death is attributed to assassination.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id</span>, his successor, was Mohammed'Ali's fourth son. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Be<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">equalised </span>the incidence of taxation, abolished monopolies,<br/>
improved the canals, completed the railways from Cairo<br/>
to Alexandria and <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>Suez, and, above all, zealously supported the scheme of M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ferdinand </span>de Lesseps for <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructing </span>a canal through the Isthmus of Suez, which was<br/>
opened in 1869 under his successor. During the Crimean<br/>
war he was obliged to send an auxiliary army and <span style="color: #0000FF;">considerable </span>sums of money to the aid of the Porte. He <span style="color: #0000FF;">died<br/>
</span>on 18th Jan., <span style="color: #ff0000;">1803</span>, and was succeeded by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma'il</span>, the second son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibrahim </span>Pasha, who was born on<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">31st </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dee.</span>, 1830. He had received the greater part of his<br/>
education in <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rance </span>and had there acquired the strong <span style="color: #0000FF;">pre</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ference </span>for European institutions which characterised him<br/>
throughout his reign. Most of his innovations, however,<br/>
such as the foundation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">manufactories </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">construetion </span>of canals, railways, bridges, and telegraphs, were<br/>
planned mainly in his own interest, though of course the<br/>
country shared in the advantage, while even in the es<br/>
