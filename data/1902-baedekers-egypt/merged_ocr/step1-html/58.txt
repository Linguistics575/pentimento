<br/>
members of the various Mediterranean races, especially Syrians and<br/>
Greeks, known as Levantines, who have been settled here for several<br/>
generations, and form no <span style="color: #0000FF;">inconsiderable </span>element in the population<br/>
of the larger towns. Most of them profess the Latin form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christianity</span>, and Arabic has now become their mother <span style="color: #0000FF;">tongue</span>, although<br/>
they still speak their old national dialects. They are apt linguists,<br/>
learning the European languages <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>great rapidity, and good men<br/>
of business, and owing to these qualities they are often employed<br/>
as <span style="color: #ff0000;">shoPmen </span>and clerks. Their services have also become <span style="color: #0000FF;">indispensable </span>at the consulates and in several of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">government-offices</span>. A<br/>
large proportion of them are wealthy. The Egyptian press is almost<br/>
exclusively in the hands of Syrians.<br/>

about as numerous as the last, and in some respects contrasts<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">favourably </span>with it. The Armenians generally possess excellent<br/>
abilities, and a singular aptitude for learning both Oriental and<br/>
European languages, which they often acquire with great grammatical<br/>
accuracy. Many of them are wealthy goldsmiths and <span style="color: #ff0000;">jewellers</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ews </span>are met with only in Cairo and Alexandria. They are<br/>
often distinguishable by their red hair from the native Egyptians,<br/>
as well as by other characteristics. Most of them are from Palestine,<br/>
though of Spanish origin, but many have recently immigrated from<br/>
Roumania. The latter are popularly <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ehleohti</span>" <span style="color: #ff0000;">/Hn </span>reference<br/>

are Jews, and notwithstanding the popular prejudice entertained<br/>
against them, owing as is alleged to their disregard of cleanliness,<br/>
they now form one of the most highly respected sections of the<br/>
community.<br/>

visitors in Egypt was 112,574 in 1897, inclusive of the British army<br/>
of occupation. The Greeks are most numerously represented, then<br/>
the Italians, English (including Indians and Maltese), French, Austrians (including many Dalmatians), and Germans. The numerous<br/>
Swiss residents in Egypt, who are not represented by a consul<br/>
of their own, are distributed among the above leading classes<br/>
(French, Italian, German). Beside these nationalities, there are<br/>
also a few representatives of Russia, America, Belgium, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seandinavia</span>, and other countries. Each of the above leading nationalities shows a preference for one or more particular occupations, in which they sometimes enjoy a complete monopoly. The<br/>
Greeks of all classes are generally traders. They constitute the <span style="color: #0000FF;">aristocracy </span>of Alexandria, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">vietual-dealers </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">ba.k.MI</span>) in all the<br/>
other towns are mostly Greeks. They are the proprietors of the<br/>
small steam-mills that abound in the villages, and of the numerous<br/>
