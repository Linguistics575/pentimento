<br/>
consisting generally of four low walls formed of crude bricks <span style="color: #ff0000;">ot'<br/>
</span>Nile mud, and thatched with a roof of durra straw, on Which the<br/>
poultry <span style="color: #0000FF;">most</span>. In the interior are a few mats, a sheepskin, several<br/>
baskets. made of matting, a <span style="color: #ff0000;">cepper </span>kettle, and a few earthenware<br/>
pots and wooden dishes. But the railway-traveller, passing through<br/>
the Delta for the first time, must not suppose that the miserable,<br/>
ruinous huts that meet his eye are typical of all peasants' dwellings<br/>
in Egypt. In Central and Upper Egypt he will obtain a much more<br/>
favourable impression. The fact is, that beneath an Egyptian sky,<br/>
houses are not of the same paramount importance as in more northern<br/>
regions, all that is wanted being shelter for the night. The day is<br/>
spent in the open air, on the court in front of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hut</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>shaded by<br/>
acacia trees, among whose branches the pigeons <span style="color: #0000FF;">BOO</span>. Here the fellah<br/>
spends his leisure, chatting with his neighbours and spinning wool<br/>
from a spindle that he turns in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
The poorer <span style="color: #0000FF;">peasant</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>mode of life is frugal in the extreme.<br/>
The staple of his food consists of a peculiar kind of bread made of<br/>
sorghum flour in Upper Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>of maize in the Delta, Wheaten<br/>
bread being eaten by the wealthier only. This poor kind of bread<br/>
often has <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">greenish </span>colour, owing to an admixture of flour made from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">anum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Graecum </span>(see below). Next in importance in'the bill of fare<br/>
are broad beans (fat). For supper, however, even the poorest cause a<br/>
hot repast to be prepared. This usually consists of a highly salted<br/>
sauce made of onions and butter, or in the poorer houses of onions<br/>
and linseed or sesame oil. Into this sauce, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>in summer<br/>
acquires a gelatinous consistency by the addition of the universal<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">btunia </span>(the capsular fruit of the Hibiscus) and various herbs, each<br/>
member of the family dips pieces of bread held in the fingers.<br/>
Both in town and country, goats', sheep's, or buffaloes<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>milk also<br/>
forms a daily article of food, but always in a sour condition or half<br/>
converted into cheese, and in very moderate quantities only. In<br/>
the height of summer the consumption of fruit of the cucumber<br/>
and pumpkin <span style="color: #0000FF;">species</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the land yields in abundance, is<br/>
enormous. In spring large quantities of lettuce, <span style="color: #0000FF;">radish-leaves</span>, and<br/>
similar green vegetables are eaten; and the lower classes consume,<br/>
for medical purposes during the same season, considerable amounts<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">anum </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Graseum</span>, a clover-like plant <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>somewhat disagreeable<br/>
odour (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1vii</span>). In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">month </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramadan </span>alone <span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxvi</span>), when a<br/>
rigorous fast is observed during the day, and on the three days of<br/>
the great <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beiram </span>festival (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Igorban </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Beiram</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">even </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>poorest members<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>community indulge in meat, and it is customary to distribute<br/>
that rare luxury to beggars at these seasons.<br/>
<br/>
The dress of the Egyptian peasant calls for little remark, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>as he usually works in the fields divested of everything. The<br/>
chief articles of his wardrobe at other times are an indigo-dyed <span style="color: #0000FF;">eot-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ton </span>shirt (<span style="color: #ff0000;">loamtg</span>), a pair of short and wide cotton <span style="color: #ff0000;">breeehes</span>, a kind<br/>
of cloak of brown, home-spun goats' wool (<span style="color: #0000FF;">m'bat</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'ahityeh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'aba</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
