</span>business pursuits. The townspeople profess Islamism, but, in their<br/>
youth particularly, they are becoming more and more lax in their<br/>
obedience to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>Thus the custom of praying in public, outside the house-doors and shops, is gradually falling into disuse. The<br/>
European dress, moreover, is gradually superseding the Oriental,<br/>
though the latter is far more picturesque, and better suited to the<br/>
climate. On the whole, however, they are bigoted <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedans</span>,<br/>
and share the contempt with which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin </span>regard all other<br/>
religions. Their daily intercourse with unbelievers and their dread<br/>
of the power of the Christian nations tend, however, to keep their<br/>
fanaticism, which otherwise would be unbounded, in check, and has<br/>
even induced them to admit strangers to witness the most sacred<br/>
ceremonies in their mosques.<br/>
<br/>
(5). <span style="color: #0000FF;">BERBERS</span>. The name <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berberi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plan </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">bardbra</span>) is applied to<br/>
the Nubian inhabitants of the Nile-valley between the neighbourhood <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan </span>and the Fourth Cataract. The Egyptians and <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ubians<br/>
</span>are radically <span style="color: #0000FF;">different</span>, and the dislike between the two races is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">carried </span>to such an extent that Nubians never marry Egyptian wives.<br/>
The Nubians are inferior to the Egyptians in industry and energy,<br/>
especially in tilling the soil, and in physical (and perhaps also in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">intellectual</span>) vigour; and they are more superstitious and fanatical,<br/>
as is indicated by the numerous amulets they wear round their<br/>
necks and arms. They are, however, superior to the Egyptians in<br/>
cleanliness, honesty, and subordination, and possess a more highly<br/>
developed sense of honour. The traveller must not expect to find<br/>
them very sincerely attached or grateful, any more than the native<br/>
Egyptians, but as servants they are certainly preferable. The Nubian<br/>
language, which is divided into the three dialects of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kent.is</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahas</span>,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dongola</span>, belongs to a special group of the African tongues; and<br/>
Dr. Brugsch is of opinion that it may afford a clue to the interpretation of the still undeciphered Ethiopian (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mero'itic</span>) inscriptions<br/>
of the Nubian part of the Nile-valley.<br/>
<br/>
Those <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berbers'who </span>do not learn Arabic grammatically never speak<br/>
it thoroughly well; but it is generally, though imperfectly, understood<br/>
in Nubia<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The traveller must therefore not expect to learn good <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabic<br/>
</span>from his Nubian servants. In their native <span style="color: #ff0000;">cofmtry </span>the Berbers till<br/>
the banks of the Nile, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>their land is of very limited extent and<br/>
poorly cultivated; and as their harvests are scanty they are rarely able<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">support </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>families. They accordingly often emigrate at an early<br/>
age to the richer lowlands, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ohieily </span>to the large towns, in quest of<br/>
employment. When the Berber has succeeded in amassing a moderate fortune, he returns to settle in his native country, of which<br/>
throughout his whole career he never entirely loses sight, and to<br/>
which he frequently remits his hardly earned savings for the benefit<br/>
of his relatives. The cold winter-nights in Egypt are very trying to<br/>
the poor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Barbers</span>, who often have to sleep in the open air outside the<br/>
doors, and many of them are attacked by consumption. They are<br/>
