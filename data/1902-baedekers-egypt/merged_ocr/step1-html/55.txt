<span>xliv THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Town </span>Arabs.<br/>
<br/>
to be found nowhere except in their desert home, where <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>a great<br/>
extent they still retain the spirit of independence, the courage, and<br/>
the restlessness of their ancestors. As in the time of Herodotus, the<br/>
tent of the Beduin is still his home. Where it is pitched is a matter<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">indifference </span>to him, if only the pegs <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>secure it be <span style="color: #0000FF;">firmly<br/>
</span>driven into the earth, if it shelter his wife and child from the<br/>
burning sunshine and the chilly night-air, and if pasturage-ground<br/>
and a spring be within reach. At Ramleh on the coast, near<br/>
Alexandria, the traveller will have an opportunity of seeing a whole<br/>
colony of the poorest class <span style="color: #0000FF;">encamped </span>in their tents, where they<br/>
live in the most frugal possible manner, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few miserable goats<br/>
and the fowls which subsist on the rubbish in their neighbourhood.<br/>
Though professors of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Islam</span>, they are considerably less strict in<br/>
their Observances than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellilyin </span>of the valley of the Nile, who<br/>
are themselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>lax, and above all they sadly neglect<br/>
the religious duty of cleanliness. They do not observe the practice<br/>
of praying five times a day, and they are as a rule but slightly <span style="color: #0000FF;">acquainted </span>with the Koran. Relies of their old star-worship can still<br/>
be traced among their customs.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller will occasionally observe <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>in the bazaars<br/>
of the armourers and <span style="color: #0000FF;">leather-merchants</span>, and will be struck with<br/>
the proud and <span style="color: #0000FF;">manly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bearing </span>of these bronzed children of the desert,<br/>
whose sharp, bearded features and steady gaze betoken firmness and<br/>
resolution. In Egypt the traveller need not fear their predatory<br/>
propensities.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">ARABIAN </span>DWELLERS <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>TOWNS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Those </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabs </span>with whom the<br/>
traveller usually comes in contact in towns are shopkeepers, <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieials</span>,<br/>
servants, <span style="color: #0000FF;">coachmen</span>, and donkey-attendants, or perhaps these last<br/>
only, as most of the best shops are kept by Europeans, while in <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieial </span>and legal matters his intercourse with the natives is carried<br/>
on through the medium of his consul. These Arabs are generally<br/>
of a much more mixed origin than the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin</span>. It thus happens<br/>
that the citizens of the Egyptian towns consist of persons of every<br/>
complexion from dark brown to white, with the features of the<br/>
worshippers of Osiris or the sharp profile of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>, and with<br/>
the slender figure of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah </span>or the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corpulence </span>of the Turk.<br/>
Among the lower classes frequent intermarriage with negro-women<br/>
has darkened the complexion and thickened the features of their<br/>
offspring; while the higher ranks, being descended from white<br/>
slaves <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Turkish mothers, more nearly resemble the European type.<br/>
As the inhabitants of the towns could not be so much oppressed by<br/>
their rulers as the peasantry, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>that they exhibit a more independent spirit, greater enterprise, and a more cheerful disposition<br/>
than the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>At the same time they are not free from the<br/>
dreamy character peculiar to Orientals, nor from a tinge of the apathy<br/>
of fatalism; and their indolence <span style="color: #ff0000;">contraSts </span>strongly with the industry<br/>
of their European rivals in political, <span style="color: #ff0000;">seientitie</span>, artistic, and all<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
