<br/>
The Sanctuary is surrounded by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Coumooa </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ten </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">small<br/>
</span>SIDE CHAMBERS (Pl. r-x) open. These, used for various <span style="color: #ff0000;">treligious </span>rites and<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">storerooms</span>, are adorned with reliefs and are faintly lighted by holes<br/>
in the roof. In each of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corner-rooms </span>(Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>and VIII) is the entrance<br/>
to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">crypt</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">closed </span>by a stone slab.<br/>
<br/>
We now return to the small hypostyle hall and pass through<br/>
Room XIX to the Inner Passage between the exterior of the temple<br/>
proper and the interior of the girdle-wall. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the outside of the<br/>
temple walls are lions' heads as <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-spouts </span>and four rows of reliefs<br/>
and inscriptions. At the foot of the wall appear the king, the queen<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>and a procession of local deities <span style="color: #0000FF;">approaching </span>the three chief gods of<br/>
Edfu. On the inner side of the E. girdle-wall (<span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>hh) the king appears before the various gods of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu</span>; on the N. wall (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>gg) are<br/>
similar scenes and long hymns to the gods of Edfu. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the W.<br/>
wall (Pl. ff) are more important reliefs and inscriptions <span style="color: #0000FF;">representing </span>the contests of the god Horus with his enemies who are <span style="color: #0000FF;">depicted </span>as crocodiles and hippopotami.<br/>
<br/>
The chief are the following: <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>Scene (below, to the right). The king,<br/>
standing on shore, attempts to <span style="color: #ff0000;">trausfix </span>a hippopotamus<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>which bends its<br/>
head aside. Horus, who is accompanied by his mother <span style="color: #ff0000;">Isis</span>, does the same;<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>left hand he holds a chain, and in his right a <span style="color: #0000FF;">javelin</span>; beside him<br/>
is his mother Isis, and behind, at the helm, is a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus</span>. - 2nd <span style="color: #0000FF;">Scene</span>.<br/>
The king appears on land, before two ships, in each <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home<br/>
</span>and an assistant with a boar's head. Horus holds the hippopotamus with<br/>
a chain and pierces its head with a javelin. - <span style="color: #ff0000;">5th </span>Scene. The hippopotamus lies on its <span style="color: #0000FF;">back</span>, with a chain fastened to its hind-feet. - 7th Scene<br/>
(the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>of all). Horus, in a ship with expanded sail, aims <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">blow </span>with<br/>
his right hand at the head of a hippopotamus, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hind-foot </span>of which is<br/>
caught in a line held in the god's left hand. Isis kneeling in the bow of the<br/>
boat holds the head of the animal by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">cord</span>. The king, standing on the<br/>
bank with two attendants armed with javelin and knife, seeks to pierce<br/>
the skull of the hippopotamus. - Farther to the left (opposite the pylon):<br/>
The king, the ram-headed Khnum, the hawk-headed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ibisheaded </span>Thout are dragging a net, in which are not only birds, <span style="color: #0000FF;">fishes</span>, and<br/>
a stag, <span style="color: #0000FF;">elm</span>, but also two <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asiaties </span>and negroes, the ancestral foes of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
A subterranean staircase, curving to the E., leads from the E.<br/>
part of the passage round the temple to an ancient Nilometer, <span style="color: #0000FF;">outside </span>the temple, also reached from without by a spiral staircase. On<br/>
the walls of the latter is the scale, with demotic numbers. The subterranean communication with the river has been interrupted.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, an <span style="color: #ff0000;">*AscENT </span>TO THE Top <span style="color: #0000FF;">or</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>THE PYLON is recommended.<br/>
The doors on the S. side of the Court (to the right and left of Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>and b) lead into dark chambers, from each of which an easy staircase<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">242 </span>steps in 14 flights ascends to the platforms of the towers.<br/>
Doors on the landings of the staircase admit to small <span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers</span>,<br/>
