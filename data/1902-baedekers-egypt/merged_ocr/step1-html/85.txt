<br/>
by several musicians <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>hautbois and drums; these are followed<br/>
by several married friends and relations of the bride in pairs, and<br/>
after these come a number of young girls. The bride is entirely concealed by the clothing she wears, being usually enveloped from <span style="color: #0000FF;">head<br/>
</span>to foot in a cashmere shawl, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">wearing </span>on her head a small cap, or<br/>
crown, of pasteboard. The procession <span style="color: #0000FF;">moves </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>slowly, and another<br/>
body of musicians brings up the rear. The shrieks of joy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Which<br/>
</span>women of the lower classes utter on the occurrence of any sensational<br/>
event are called <span style="color: #ff0000;">saghthtt </span>(sing. <span style="color: #ff0000;">saghrayi</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The bride is afterwards<br/>
conducted with the same formalities <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the house of her husband.<br/>
<br/>
The ceremonies observed at funerals are not less remarkable<br/>
than those which attend weddings If the death occurs in the morning, the funeral takes place the same day; but if in the evening,<br/>
it is postponed till next day. The body is washed and mourned<br/>
over by the family and the professional mourning women (<span style="color: #ff0000;">nedddbehs</span>); the <span style="color: #ff0000;">filith</span>, or schoolmaster, reads several <span style="color: #ff0000;">St1rehs </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran<br/>
</span>by its side; after this, it is wrapped in its winding sheet, placed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the bier, covered with a red or green cloth, and then carried<br/>
forth in solemn procession. The foremost persons in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eort√©ge </span>are<br/>
usually six or more poor, and generally blind, men, who walk in<br/>
twos or threes at a slow pace, chanting the <span style="color: #0000FF;">oreed-'There </span>is no<br/>
God but God; Mohammed is the ambassador of God; God be <span style="color: #0000FF;">gracious </span>to him and <span style="color: #0000FF;">preserve </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">him</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>These are followed by several<br/>
male relatives of the deceased, and sometimes by a number of<br/>
dervishes with the flags of their order, and then by three or more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolboys</span>, one of whom carries a copy of the Koran, or of parts of<br/>
it, on a stand made of <span style="color: #ff0000;">palm-branohes</span>, covered with a cloth. The<br/>
boys usually chant in a loud and shrill voice several passages from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">the'tltrshrtys</span>', a poem describing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">judgment</span>. The bier,<br/>
with the head of the deceased foremost, comes next, being borne<br/>
by three or four of his friends, who are relieved from time to time<br/>
by others. After the bier come the female relatives, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">dishevelled </span>hair, sobbing aloud, and frequently accompanied by professional<br/>
mourning women, whose business it is to extol the merits of the<br/>
deceased. If the deceased <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the husband or father of the family,<br/>
one of the cries is:<span style="color: #ff0000;">'O </span>thou camel of my house', the camel being<br/>
the emblem of the bread-winner of the household.<br/>
<br/>
The body is first carried into that mosque for whose patron<br/>
saints the relatives entertain the greatest veneration, and prayers<br/>
are there <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>on its behalf. After the bier has been placed in<br/>
front of the tomb of the saint, and prayers and chants have again<br/>
been recited, the procession is formed anew and moves towards the<br/>
cemetery, where the body is laid in the tomb in such a position<br/>
that its <span style="color: #0000FF;">face </span>is turned towards Mecca. Among the women are the<br/>
relatives and friends of the deceased, distinguished by a strip<br/>
[ usually blue) of linen, cotton, or muslin bound round the head,<br/>
with the end hanging down behind. They usually also carry <span style="color: #ff0000;">ablue<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
