<span>HELIOPOLIS. 7. Route. 107<br/>
<br/>
while that of all the others, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">percolates </span>through the ground<br/>
from the Nile, is usually brackish.<br/>
<br/>
About 3/4 M. beyond the garden are situated the ruins of the<br/>
famous ancient Heliopolis, or city of the sun, called On by the<br/>
Egyptians. The latter name frequently occurs in the Bible. Thus,<br/>
in Genesis (<span style="color: #ff0000;">111i</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>), we are informed that Pharaoh gave Joseph'to<br/>
wife Asenath, the daughter of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Potipherah </span>(Egypt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Petepré</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he<br/>
</span>whom the sun-god Re has given'), priest of On'.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jleliopotirths </span>was one of the most ancient Egyptian cities and was<br/>
the chief town of a separate province, included in Lower Egypt. The<br/>
deities <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the place were the hawk-headed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ité-Harmachis </span>(the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>whence the Greek name Heliopolis) and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">human-headed </span>Atum, who<br/>
was incarnated in the sacred Mnevis Bull. To these was dedicated the<br/>
famous temple,'the House of <span style="color: #0000FF;">RE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, built on the site of an earlier edifice<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemhét </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span>, first king of the 12th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dyn.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>in front of which his <span style="color: #ff0000;">8011<br/>
</span>and successor Usertesen <span style="color: #ff0000;">f. </span>erected two great obelisks (see below) in <span style="color: #0000FF;">celebration </span>of an important anniversary. A large section of the Egyptian<br/>
religious literature was due to the priests of Heliopolis, and their doctrines<br/>
were widely disseminated throughout the country at a very early period,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ré-Ha1anaehis </span>was one of the most highly venerated deities in<br/>
Egypt. - Even during the Greek period these priests enjoyed a high<br/>
reputation for wisdom; Herodotus <span style="color: #0000FF;">conversed </span>with them and Plato is said<br/>
to have spent thirteen years with them, in order to learn <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>at least<br/>
of their doctrines. - Under the New Empire the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Be1iopo1is<br/>
</span>was the largest and most richly endowed in all Egypt, next to the temple<br/>
of Ammon at Thebes. - When <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">b. </span>about 60 <span style="color: #ff0000;">RC</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>visited Egypt,<br/>
the city had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">destroyed</span>, but the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>still intact, except for some<br/>
minor injuries attributed to Cambyses; even the houses of the priests<br/>
and the apartments of Plato and his friend Eudoxus were shown to the<br/>
traveller. The priestly school<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>however, had ceased to exist, and only a<br/>
few <span style="color: #0000FF;">officiating </span>priests and guides for foreigners resided there.<br/>
<br/>
The outer walls are now the only vestiges of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">city</span>, while of<br/>
the temple nothing is left but a few scanty ruins and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*OBELISK</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The latter, the oldest Egyptian obelisk known, is of red granite<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Syene </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Assutu0</span>, and is 66 ft. high; but the ground on which it<br/>
stands has been so raised by deposits of mud, that a great part of the<br/>
obelisk is now buried. Each of the four sides bears the same inscription in bold hieroglyphics; that on the N. side, the only one<br/>
entirely legible, records that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Usertesen </span>L, King of Upper and<br/>
Lower Egypt, lord of the diadems and son of the sun, whom the<br/>
(divine) spirits of On (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>love, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete.</span>, founded the obelisk<br/>
on the first festival of Set (a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">jubilee </span>celebration). The inscriptions on the other three sides are more or less covered by the<br/>
cells of wild bees, besides being otherwise damaged. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">pyramidium </span>at the top and the hawks which begin the inscriptions on<br/>
each side were once covered with metal. The companion obelisk<br/>
(for these monuments were always erected in pairs) stood down to<br/>
the 12th century.<br/>
<br/>
To the W. of the obelisk the remains of the temple may be recognized in a few blocks of granite, bearing inscriptions by Ramses II. On<br/>
one Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>appears <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">libation </span>to Atum. - The necropolis of<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>, where <span style="color: #ff0000;">cofflns </span>and tombstones of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>late period have recently<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">found</span>, does not repay a visit.<br/>
