<br/>
XIII. and XIV. DYNASTIES.<br/>
<br/>
The monarchs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ISM </span>Dynasty, most of whom were named<br/>
Sebekhotep, maintained Egypt at the height of her power for some<br/>
time, but a period of decline afterwards set in. There is no period<br/>
of Egyptian history at <span style="color: #ff0000;">whieh </span>kings were more numerous, most of<br/>
them reigning but a short time. The South was probably ruled by<br/>
the descendants of the ancient Theban kings, while in the town of<br/>
Xois, in the W. Delta, another family raised themselves to power,<br/>
forming the 14th Dynasty.<br/>
<br/>
ii. Hyksos Period (<span style="color: #ff0000;">ea</span>. 1700-1575 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C.</span>).<br/>
XV. and XVI. DYNASTIES.<br/>
<br/>
Egypt was now conquered by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Semitio </span>people, known as Hyksos,<br/>
<br/>
i.e.'Shepherd Kings' or, perhaps more correctly,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'princes </span>ot' the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shosu</span>' or Syrian Bed uins. Few of their monuments have been pre<br/>
served (statue of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kheyan</span>, see p. 86); but it is evident that they<br/>
conformed to the ancient culture of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
6. The New Empire <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1600-1100 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C.</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Egypt became a great power during this period. At first the culture of<br/>
the New Empire differed little from that of the Middle Empire, but<br/>
under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IH</span>. political and social life as well as the art of Egypt<br/>
underwent a radical change, <span style="color: #0000FF;">owing </span>to the new relations with W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aim<br/>
</span>The tribute paid by foreign states caused an <span style="color: #0000FF;">enormous </span>flood of wealth<br/>
to pour <span style="color: #0000FF;">into </span>Egypt, and especially into Thebes, the capital. The earlier<br/>
buildings, that had fallen into disrepair, were now replaced <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">imposing<br/>
</span>monuments, such as the temples at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak</span>, Luxor, etc.<br/>
<br/>
XVII. DYNASTY (ea. 1600-1545).<br/>
<br/>
While the Hyksos kings maintained themselves in the N., the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.<br/>
</span>was ruled by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>princes, who were at first vassals of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">foreign<br/>
<br/>
</span>intruders. The tombs of these princes lie near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Drah </span>Abu'l <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">egga</span>.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sekenyen-Ré </span>1., <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>The mummy of one of these was found<br/>
at Dir <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-bahri </span>(p. 278).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kemosé</span>. His queen was perhaps Ahhotep, whose jewels are now in<br/>
the Museum <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Gizeh (p. 83 ].<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amosis </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Alimosii</span>, 1580-1555 B.O.) conquered <span style="color: #ff0000;">Auaris</span>, the chief fortress of the Hyksos, and expelled the intruders from Egypt,<br/>
which was reunited under one <span style="color: #ff0000;">soeptre</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenhotep</span>, 1555-1545 13.0.). This king and his<br/>
mother <span style="color: #0000FF;">Netret-er</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e</span>' were afterwards regarded as the patron-gods of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eoropolis </span>of Thebes.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*XVIII</span>. DYNASTY <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1545-1350 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C.</span>)<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">T</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Thutmosé</span>, 1545-1515 <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.O</span>.) re-conquered Nubia. His<br/>
tomb at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bibtut </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-MuWr </span>(p. 277) was the first royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-tomb<br/>
</span>constructed under the Pharaohs. During his lifetime his children<br/>
fought for the succession.<br/>
