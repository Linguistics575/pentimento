<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">x </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ii </span>THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduim</span>.<br/>
<br/>
is also named Cyrillos. To the Romanists is partly due the <span style="color: #0000FF;">preservation </span>of the old <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ceptie </span>language, into which they caused the Gospels<br/>
to be translated by the most learned scholars of the day for circulation in Egypt. Notwithstanding the serious defects to which we<br/>
have alluded, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span>community boasts of a number of highly<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">respectable </span>members, and in spite of the frequent heavy contributions levied from the sect by previous governments, it contains several wealthy land-owners and merchants.<br/>
<br/>
3. <span style="color: #ff0000;">BEDUINS</span>. Bedu (sing. bedawi) is the name applied to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">nomadic </span>Arabs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and'Arab </span>to those who immigrated at a later period and settled in the valley of the Nile. They both differ <span style="color: #0000FF;">materially </span>from the dwellers in towns and from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin</span>. The subdivisions of the Beduin tribes are called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kab'ilch </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>whence the name<br/>
Kabyles, applied to some of the Algerian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>). Though <span style="color: #0000FF;">dif-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ering </span>greatly in origin and language, the wandering tribes of Egypt<br/>
all profess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedanism</span>. Again, while some <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>them have <span style="color: #0000FF;">immigrated </span>from Arabia or Syria, partly in very ancient, and partly<br/>
in modern times, and while others are supposed to be the aboriginal<br/>
inhabitants of the territories claimed by them (as the Berbers of<br/>
N. Africa and the Ethiopians and Blemmyes of Nubia), or former<br/>
dwellers on the Nile expelled from their homes by foreign invaders,<br/>
they all differ greatly from the stationary Egyptian population; and<br/>
this contrast is accounted for by the radical difference between the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">influenees </span>of the desert and those of the Nile valley.<br/>
<br/>
According to the census <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1897 </span>there were 601,427 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins<br/>
</span>within the limits of Egypt, of whom <span style="color: #0000FF;">530,955 </span>were <span style="color: #0000FF;">settle'l </span>in towns<br/>
and villages.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>may be divided into two leading groups<span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins<br/>
</span>in the narrower sense, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabie-speaking </span>tribes, most of whom<br/>
have probably immigrated from Arabia or Syria, and who occupy<br/>
the deserts adjoining Central and Northern Egypt; (<span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">?</span>'Bega', who<br/>
range over the regions of Upper Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Nubia situated between<br/>
the Nile and the Red Sea, and extending to the frontiers of the<br/>
Abyssinian mountains. These are the descendants <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the ancient<br/>
Blemmyes (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">352</span>; their territory being known <span style="color: #ff0000;">as'Ei1toai0</span>. The<br/>
three principal races of the second group, with whom alone we have<br/>
to deal as inhabitants of Egypt, are the Hadendoa, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bislidrtn</span>,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rAhitluleh</span>. They are widely scattered in the valleys of the<br/>
desert (pp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">344-348</span>), between the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tropies </span>and the latitude of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ifeneh<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bioyir</span>, and lead a poverty-stricken life with their very scanty<br/>
stock of camels and goats. Though closely resembling the other<br/>
Bega tribes in appearance, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Abibdeh </span>(sing<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abidi</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gebadei<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pliny</span>) possess an original language of their own (<span style="color: #ff0000;">/tybedyawtyeh0</span>,<br/>
which, however, they have long since exchanged for bad Arabic.<br/>
They have also adopted the costume of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin</span>, while the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bishirin </span>and Hadendoa tend their large <span style="color: #ff0000;">floekg </span>of sheep and herds of<br/>
camels in a half-naked condition, <span style="color: #0000FF;">girded </span>with a leathern apron and<br/>
