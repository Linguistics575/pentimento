<span>FRUIT TREES. <span style="color: #0000FF;">lin<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">quently </span>seen by the wayside and in the villages. The Acacia<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Farnesiana </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">futneh</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>with blossoms of delicious perfume. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sycamore </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">gemméa</span>), anciently considered sacred. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">zizyphus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>Christ's <span style="color: #0000FF;">thorn-tree </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">neb.k</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Tamarisks (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ail</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>not to be confounded<br/>
with tamarinds). The Parkinsonia (<span style="color: #ff0000;">ptuehdn</span>, a name also applied<br/>
to the wild Sesbania shrub). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mulberry-trees </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">tat</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">7 </span>in Lower Egypt<br/>
only. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Carob-trees</span>, or bread of St. John (<span style="color: #0000FF;">kha'rmb</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Among the FRUIT TREES the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">important </span>is the date-palm<br/>
(Phoenix <span style="color: #ff0000;">daetylifera</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">nakhleh</span>; the date, <span style="color: #0000FF;">halal </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span>; the rib of the leaf,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">gertd</span>; the leaf, <span style="color: #0000FF;">W</span>; the points of the leaf, <span style="color: #ff0000;">tdai</span>; the crown, <span style="color: #ff0000;">gummtr</span>). The date-palms blossom in March and April, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruit<br/>
</span>ripens in August and September. Fresh dates are rough in <span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance</span>, blood-red or pale yellow in colour, and harsh and astringent<br/>
in taste. Like the medlar, they become more palatable after fermentation has set in. There are no fewer than <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-seven </span>kinds<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>date commonly offered for sale. The largest attain a length of<br/>
three <span style="color: #0000FF;">inches</span>, and are called <span style="color: #ff0000;">ibrtmi</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">suklu5ti</span>, as they come from<br/>
N. Nubia. The most delicately <span style="color: #0000FF;">flavoured </span>are the dark-brown ones<br/>
from Alexandria, known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">amlidt</span>, which are eaten fresh. The<br/>
value of the dates exported annually amounts to about one million<br/>
francs only, as they realise too high a price in the country itself to<br/>
remunerate the exporter. - The dum-palm <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hyphama </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tliehaiea</span>)<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">occurs </span>principally in Upper <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>and Nubia. It may be seen on<br/>
the Nile above <span style="color: #ff0000;">Belianeh </span>(p. 224). It is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">broad-leafed </span>palm <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>medium height, and its timber and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bast </span>are of considerable value.<br/>
The large nuts contain a soft and fibrous pulp, which is edible and<br/>
has a sweetish taste; while various objects are made out of the<br/>
hard rind.<br/>
<br/>
The vine thrives admirably in Egypt, and grapes (<span style="color: #ff0000;">'oenab</span>) abound<br/>
from July to September. Wine was extensively made from them<br/>
in ancient times, and this might still easily be done<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>were it not<br/>
that Egypt is already amply supplied with cheap and excellent<br/>
wines from every part of the Mediterranean. The vine blossoms in<br/>
March and April, like the palm, and the grapes ripen in June and<br/>
July. Oranges (<span style="color: #ff0000;">burtulcén</span>) are abundant and cheap (the harvest<br/>
beginning in September), and so also are mandarins and lemons<br/>
(the small and juicy fruit of the Citrus <span style="color: #ff0000;">limonium</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>; citrons and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cedros </span>are of less frequent occurrence. Among other fruit-trees we<br/>
may also mention the pomegranate (<span style="color: #ff0000;">rummdn</span>), which is specially<br/>
cultivated for the benefit of the Turks, who are very partial to it,<br/>
and which yields a handsome return. The common European fruits<br/>
also abound, but their flavour is generally very inferior. Figs (tin)<br/>
are very common in summer.<br/>
<br/>
The principal DECORATIVE PLANTS <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>roses (ward; of which<br/>
the Rosa <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damascena </span>moschata and the sempervirens are specially<br/>
cultivated for the manufacture of otto of <span style="color: #0000FF;">roses</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, oleanders of astonishing height, carnations, and geraniums, all of which have been<br/>
