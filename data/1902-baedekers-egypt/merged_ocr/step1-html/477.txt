</span>20. Abydos.<br/>
<br/>
The ordinary traveller, especially when he has at his disposal only<br/>
the 8 hrs. allowed by the steamer, will <span style="color: #0000FF;">confine </span>himself to the Temple of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethos </span>I. and the sadly dilapidated Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">If.</span>, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">possihly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>visit to the old fortress of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shilnet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ez-Zebib</span>. The other antiquities are<br/>
uninteresting. - Fair donkeys, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>saddles, may he <span style="color: #ff0000;">ohtained<br/>
</span>at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">railway-station </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">BeliL1eh </span>(p. 191; <span style="color: #0000FF;">3-45.</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Abydos lies about 81/2 M. from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beliineh</span>, a ride of 11/2 hr. The<br/>
track crosses several canals, passes through the hamlet of <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Hers</span>,<br/>
traverses a fertile district dotted with numerous villages, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally<br/>
</span>leads over part of the Libyan Desert. Fine view of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mountainehain </span>running towards the Nile. The ancient Abydos, the sacred<br/>
city of the Egyptians, lay on the verge of the arable land, and extended <span style="color: #ff0000;">from'Artha </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or'Arthat </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-uadfilneli </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span>i.e.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'buried'Ariba</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ei-KI-bell </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>224).<br/>
<br/>
Abydos (Egypt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abutu</span>) was One of the most ancient cities in Egypt and<br/>
played an important <span style="color: #0000FF;">role </span>in the religion of the country. For here <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">famous </span>grave of Osiris, in which the head of the god was traditionally<br/>
believed <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>be buried in a casket. Just as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shi'ite </span>Mohammedan<br/>
cherishes <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">dearer </span>wish than to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>buried near the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">IJosten </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kerhela </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">i2</span>), so the pious Egyptian, from the days of the Ancient Empire,<br/>
desired <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">better </span>fortune than to have his corpse carried to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahydos</span>, there<br/>
to find its last abode beside the tomb of Osiris. Those who <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unable<br/>
</span>to do this, or who had <span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span>tombs elsewhere, often caused their mummies<br/>
to he <span style="color: #0000FF;">brought </span>temporarily to Abydos, to receive the desired consecration<br/>
and to spend some time at least with Osiris. Many contented themselves<br/>
with merely erecting a memorial stone in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">thereby </span>assuring<br/>
to themselves the <span style="color: #0000FF;">favour </span>of Osiris, the lord of the underworld. - The<br/>
chief god of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahydos </span>was of course Osiris; hut his wife Isis, his son Horns,<br/>
and, under the New Empire, Ptah, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, with other<br/>
deities, were also worshipped there. - <span style="color: #ff0000;">Straho </span>gives an interesting account<br/>
of Abydos<span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span>'Above it (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemais</span>) lies <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahydos</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>site of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnonium</span>,<br/>
a wonderful palace of stone, built in the manner of the Labyrinth, only<br/>
somewhat less <span style="color: #0000FF;">elaborate </span>in its complexity. Below the Memnonium is a<br/>
spring<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>reached <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>passages with low vaults consisting of a single stone<br/>
and distinguished for their extent and mode of construction. This spring<br/>
is connected with the Nile hy a canal, which flows through a grove of<br/>
Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">thiorsraeacias</span>, sacred to Apollo. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahydos </span>seems once to have been<br/>
a large city, second only to Thebes, but now it is a small place, etc.<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>This spring may perhaps have been a Nilometer. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ammianus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hIaree11im1s<br/>
</span>speaks of the oracle of the god Bes, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourished </span>here.<br/>
<br/>
The most important part of ancient Abydos was its extensive<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Neeropolie</span>, situated in the desert. Four distinct sections are clearly<br/>
traceable. In the southernmost, <span style="color: #0000FF;">beside'Araba</span>, are tombs of the New<br/>
Empire and the temples of Sethos and Ramses. To the N. of this<br/>
rises a hill, with graves dating from the close <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Ancient Empire.<br/>
Still farther to the N., between the shrine of Osiris and the fortress<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sininet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ez-Zehib </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>224), are the tombs of the Middle Empire,<br/>
many in the form of small <span style="color: #0000FF;">brick-pyramids</span>. Here also are found<br/>
graves of the 18-20th Dyn. and of the later period. Finally, in the<br/>
hill of Umm <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-61a'ib</span>, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W.</span>, are the tombs of the kings of the<br/>
earliest dynasties. - The chief centre of interest is the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*Temple </span>of Sethos L, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnonium </span>of Strabo. This wonderful structure, built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sethosl</span>. and completed by Ramses IL, was<br/>
