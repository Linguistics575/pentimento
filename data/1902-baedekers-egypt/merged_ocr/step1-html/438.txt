Holders of Cook's tickets may break their journey at Luxor or<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin </span>either on the way up <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the way down (after previous <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrangement </span>with Cook's manager in Cairo), and proceed by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">subsequent </span>steamer, if there are vacant berths. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">mail-Steamers</span>,<br/>
usually less crowded than the <span style="color: #0000FF;">others</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>may be used in descending<br/>
the stream. In all these deviations from the usual tours, very strict<br/>
adherence to the terms of the special <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrangement </span>is exacted.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahabiyehs</span>. - Now that the visit to Upper Egypt is so much<br/>
facilitated by the railway and the regular services <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tourist-steamers</span>, only those travellers to whom economy of time and money is<br/>
no object make the voyage in privately <span style="color: #ff0000;">hireddahabiyehs </span>or launches.<br/>
In Cairo the best <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyehs</span>, comfortably and even luxuriously<br/>
fitted up, are those belonging to Messrs. Cook' Son <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">d </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ssteam-dahabiyehs</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">G </span>sailing <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyehs</span>) and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Anglo-American </span>Co. (3 large<br/>
and 2 small <span style="color: #ff0000;">steam-dahabiyehs</span>, several sailing <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyehs</span>). The<br/>
inclusive charge, <span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g.</span>, for Cook's excellent <span style="color: #ff0000;">steam-dahabiyeh'Nitoeris</span>', is <span style="color: #0000FF;">4006. </span>per month for 4 <span style="color: #0000FF;">pets</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">5501. </span>for 6, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">6755. </span>for 8. These<br/>
prices include not only the hire of the dahabiyeh and its full<br/>
equipment and the wages of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">re'is </span>or captain and the crew, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span>also the services of a dragoman and attendants, and provisions <span style="color: #ff0000;">fexeept </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">liquoro</span>), donkeys, saddles, and all the incidental expenses of<br/>
excursions (excluding <span style="color: #ff0000;">bakshish</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. The charge for sailing <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyehs </span>is, of course, less. In the case of head-winds small <span style="color: #0000FF;">steam-ttw<br/>
</span>may be hired for <span style="color: #0000FF;">6-8t</span>. per day.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller may also hire a dahabiyeh directly, i.e. independently of the agents, and take the <span style="color: #0000FF;">commissariat </span>into his own<br/>
hands; but this is not recommended to inexperienced travellers. A<br/>
