<span>288 Route 24. THEBES (w. BANK). <span style="color: #ff0000;">7</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span>Tombs of<br/>
<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>roof frequently borne by pillars or columns, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Corridor, beginning opposite the <span style="color: #ff0000;">entranee-door </span>and ending in a recess, in which the<br/>
statues of the deceased and his favourite relatives were erected. Not <span style="color: #0000FF;">my<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently </span>there is a small chamber on each side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corridor</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Opposite<br/>
</span>the entrance-door <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fore-wart</span>, where <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>were made<br/>
to the dead. The representations in the hall depict the deceased in his<br/>
earthly circumstances and duties, and thus shed a flood of light upon<br/>
Egyptian life at the beginning of the New Empire. The end-walls (<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the<br/>
right and left) of the vestibules are shaped like huge gravestones; that to<br/>
the right usually bears prayers for the dead, while on the other is recorded<br/>
the biography of the deceased. The representations on the walls of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">corridors </span>illustrate the various funeral <span style="color: #0000FF;">rites</span>. As the limestone of the hill<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shékh'Ahd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eHryrna </span>is of poor quality, ill-adapted for sculpture, the<br/>
walls of most of the tombs were covered with clay<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>then whitewashed,<br/>
and adorned with paintings.<br/>
<br/>
The more important tombs were recently explored by Newberry and<br/>
provided with doors. The keys may he obtained from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Insgeetor </span>General at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet-Hahu</span>. Many of the tombs are inhabited by <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin</span>, while<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fore-courts </span>serve for their livestock. In front of most of these <span style="color: #ff0000;">cavedwellings </span>stand covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">cylinders </span>like gigantic mushrooms, of Nile mud<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">straw </span>kneaded together. These are the primitive granaries <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the inhabitants of'Abd <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-liurna</span>, several of whom are <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-to-do</span>, with houses<br/>
of Nile bricks, conspicuous <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>a distance. - The tombs are marked in<br/>
black <span style="color: #ff0000;">f1gures </span>(1-27), which are shown in the adjoining <span style="color: #0000FF;">small </span>plan. It time<br/>
is limited, it will be <span style="color: #ff0000;">B11fiieient </span>to visit the tombs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramose</span>, Nakht,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Rekhmeré</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemheb</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sen-nofer</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Enné</span>.<br/>
<br/>
From the Ramesseum we proceed to the E., in the direction of<br/>
the mountains, and soon reach the important tombs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramosé </span>and<br/>
Nakht, both situated on the hillside.<br/>
<br/>
No. 118 is the Tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramosé</span>, a vizier, who flourished in<br/>
the reign of the heretical king, Amenophis IV. (p. lxxxii). When<br/>
Amenophis transferred his residence from Thebes to Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-'Amarna<br/>
</span>(p. 203), he was followed by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramosé</span>, who left his <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>tomb<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished</span>. As one of the few monuments dating from the beginning of the reign of Amenophis <span style="color: #ff0000;">1V.</span>, the period at which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">transition </span>from the ancient religion to pure sun-worship was accomplished,<br/>
this tomb is of great historical importance and a visit to it is especially recommended to travellers who have not seen Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-'Amarna</span>.<br/>
The tomb, which was discovered by Villiers Stuart, comprises two<br/>
chambers. On the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">well </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">FIRST </span>CHAMBER (largely filled with<br/>
rubbish) the deceased and his sister Merit-Ptah appear before a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">defaced </span>god (Osiris); to the left are a <span style="color: #ff0000;">saeritiee </span>to Hathor and <span style="color: #ff0000;">fur<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hera </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>rites. On the left half of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">AmenoPhis </span>IV., still<br/>
represented in the old conventional manner, seated below a canopy<br/>
with Meat, goddess of truth, while <span style="color: #ff0000;">Itamosé </span>is represented twice;<br/>
on the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">half </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>king and his consort are shown on a balcony<br/>
of the palace, watching <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramose </span>being adorned with the golden<br/>
chains they have thrown down to him. The unattractive features<br/>
of the king are here reproduced with great fidelity to nature; the<br/>
figure of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramose </span>is merely sketched in. Above are the sun and its<br/>
beams; behind, the royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">body-guard</span>. Farther to the right is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rs.mosE </span>leaving the palace with his decorations and receiving the congratulations of the populace. In the Doorway to the next chamber<br/>
