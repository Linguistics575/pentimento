<br/>
The ramparts round the <span style="color: #0000FF;">BAGARA </span>TOWN are strong and massive,<br/>
but have no banquette within for the defence. The Mahdi's Tomb<br/>
(P1. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ileras </span>destroyed by the British and its contents scattered. The<br/>
base (b' ft. thick), vaulting, and dome of this <span style="color: #ff0000;">ei1ifiety </span>are said to have<br/>
been executed by Neufeld, a German kept in captivity for many years<br/>
by the Khalifa. Beside the tomb are an open space in which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">derTish </span>army was reviewed, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mosque </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. 2), now used as <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>messroom by the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers</span>. Close by are Abdullahi's House (P1. 3)<br/>
and the two-storied House of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shiloh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ed-Dfn </span>(Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>), his son. The<br/>
latter is the only dervish house with glass windows. Beside it is<br/>
the grave of an English <span style="color: #0000FF;">war-correspondent</span>, who fell here. Permission must be obtained from the Civil Secretary for a visit to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">treasure-howse </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bilt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Amana </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Be</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el.W </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. 5), which contains<br/>
memorials of Gordon and trophies of weapons. Visits may be paid<br/>
to Slatin Pasha's <span style="color: #0000FF;">House</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>now the <span style="color: #ff0000;">te1egrapl1-offiee </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. 9), and to<br/>
Emir Yakub's House (Pl. 6), which was occupied by the governor<br/>
until the summer of 1901. The Prison (P1. 12), where many <span style="color: #0000FF;">Europeans </span>languished, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">situated </span>500 yds. farther on, at the S. angle<br/>
of the town-wall. It is sometimes known as the'Saier Prison' from<br/>
the name of the jailer under the Mahdi and Khalifa.<br/>
<br/>
A wide new street, passing the clean quarter of the Greek shopkeepers, leads hence to the N.W. to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>1/4 M.) large <span style="color: #ff0000;">*MARKET<br/>
</span>PLACE, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>presents a busy and variegated scene of African life.<br/>
All the articles of consumption of Central Africa are to be seen here<br/>
in profusion: curious spices of a hundred different varieties, drugs,<br/>
and perfumes; soda, saltpetre, salt; betel, bead-nuts, seeds, and<br/>
wood of every kind; glass beads, <span style="color: #0000FF;">filigree </span>work, <span style="color: #0000FF;">toilet-butter</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">angaribs </span>(bedsteads). the dried <span style="color: #0000FF;">flesh </span>of wild animals, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ostrichs</span>, etc.<br/>
Skilful smiths, and saddlers dealing with hippopotamus hide, may<br/>
be seen at work. Sudanese weapons and curiosities may be purchased<br/>
of P. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luisa</span>. Goods intended for importation into Central Africa<br/>
may be seen in the covered sheds on the S. side of the market-place.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">.The </span>place of execution under the Khalifa was also in the marketplace, and to the E. of it is the pit ('Tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Martyrs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>into which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>thrown the heads and limbs of the condemned. - A visit to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*MÃ©mda</span>, on the bank of the Nile, should not be omitted; here<br/>
are the markets for ivory, india-rubber, feathers, and corn. The<br/>
slave-market is, of course, a thing of the past. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sails </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-2.Taron</span>,<br/>
where women were sold, is now devoted to milk, ornaments, ointments, and basket-work.<br/>
<br/>
The population will on the whole impress the stranger <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>unfriendly and importunate. The warlike oppression of the last decade, the fanatical enthusiasm for pilgrimages, the desire for<br/>
plunder, and the devastation of whole provinces have assembled here<br/>
a confused medley of the most diverse races and stocks: <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bantus<br/>
</span>and grotesque dwarf negroes from the W. Sudan; Semitic and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamitic </span>tribes from the desert, such as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nubas</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bagara</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kababish</span>,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
