<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Inundation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">NIL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B. </span>li<br/>
<br/>
it rises again and attains its highest level (comp. p. 69). After<br/>
having begun to <span style="color: #0000FF;">subside</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it generally rises again for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>short time,<br/>
sometimes regaining and even passing its <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>culminating point.<br/>
At length it begins to subside steadily, and after a time the <span style="color: #0000FF;">decrease </span>becomes more and more rapid. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">January</span>, February, and<br/>
March the fields from which the water has receded gradually dry<br/>
up, and in April, May, and the first few days of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jane </span>the river is<br/>
at its lowest. When the river is low the water covers 7 ells <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">129/5 </span>ft.)<br/>
of the Nilometer at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Roda </span>(p. 69); when it reaches <span style="color: #ff0000;">152/3 </span>ells<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>273/4 ft.) the inundation has attained the height most favourable<br/>
for agriculture at the present day.<br/>
<br/>
Egypt is now no longer a vast lake during the inundation as<br/>
it formerly was, nor does the overflow of the fields take place in a<br/>
direct manner as is commonly supposed. In Upper Egypt the water<br/>
is conducted into a vast network of reservoirs and canals, and distributed as required, and special engineers are appointed for their<br/>
supervision. The whole of the cultivable land is divided into huge<br/>
basins (Md), in which the water introduced by the canals is maintained at a certain height until it has <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>saturated the soil<br/>
and deposited the requisite quantity of mud. After the water in the<br/>
river has subsided, that in the basins may either be discharged into<br/>
the river or into the canals, or it may be used for filling other basins lying at a lower level. During these operations many of the<br/>
villages are connected by means of <span style="color: #ff0000;">embaakrnertts </span>only, while others<br/>
can only be reached by boat, and the whole country presents a<br/>
very peculiar and picturesque appearance. With the help of the<br/>
great Barrage (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>), the Delta is irrigated all the year round by<br/>
means of a network of canals. The principal CANALS in Upper Egypt<br/>
are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sohag'iyeh </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">iSoahagieli</span>), which quits the river at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sohag </span>(p.191<span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ihrahimtyeli</span>, which begins below <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assifit </span>and ends to the N. of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Beuitsa√©f</span>; and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Balm </span>Yusuf, which serves the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayfim</span>. In Lower<br/>
Egypt the chief canals are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">MaljmiMtyeh </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khatatbeh</span>, in the<br/>
W. Delta; the Balm <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shib'z'n</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Es-son</span>, in the<br/>
Central Delta; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewfiltlych</span>, with its <span style="color: #ff0000;">continuatious </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ManMhfyeh </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baht </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ea-Sughair</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Balm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bulityeh</span>, the Balir Mu'iss,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismi'Wyelt </span>Canal, in the E. Delta.<br/>
<br/>
If the river and the system of canals connected with it are in<br/>
any way neglected the consequences are very disastrous, as was<br/>
notably the case during the latter part of the Byzantine supremacy<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">disgraceful </span>sway of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>, when the fertile<br/>
soil <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>yielded less than <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-half </span>of its average produce. The<br/>
mean difference between the highest and the lowest <span style="color: #0000FF;">state </span>of the<br/>
river is about 25 ft. at Cairo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">38 </span>ft. at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>.<br/>
Even in March and April the traveller will have an opportunity of<br/>
observing how powerful and rapid the flow of the river still is,<br/>
although its fall from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan </span>(by the first cataract) to Cairo is<br/>
299 ft. only, or about seven inches per mile. The rapidity of the<br/>
