<br/>
whole of his spare time is occupied in drawing <span style="color: #0000FF;">water </span>for the irrigation of the land. Notwithstanding his hard lot, however, he is an<br/>
entire stranger to any endeavour to better his condition or to improve his system of farming. As soon as he has accomplished the<br/>
most necessary tasks he rests and smokes, and trusts that Allah will<br/>
do the remainder of his work for <span style="color: #0000FF;">him</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">..The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah </span>is generally of a<br/>
peaceful disposition, kindly and helpful to his neighbour; theft is<br/>
less common among the <span style="color: #ff0000;">felWptn </span>than in the corresponding classes<br/>
in Europe. Foreigners can see his best side only by observing his<br/>
dealings with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows</span>; for he regards strangers as merely so<br/>
many convenient sources of profit (comp. p. xx)<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">2</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Come </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">faiibt</span>,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'w'iby</span>. While we have regarded the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin </span>as<br/>
genuine Egyptians in consequence of their uninterrupted occupation<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>soil, the religion of the Copts affords us an additional guarantee<br/>
for the purity of their descent. The Copts are undoubtedly the most<br/>
direct descendants of the ancient Egyptians, there being no ground<br/>
for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">assumption </span>that their ancestors were foreign immigrants who<br/>
embraced Christianity after the conquest of the country by the<br/>
Mohammedans, while on the other hand the <span style="color: #ff0000;">obstinaey </span>with which<br/>
they defended their monophysite Christianity for several centuries<br/>
against the inroads of the creed of Byzantium affords another<br/>
indication of their Egyptian character. The size of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">population </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>valley of the Nile cannot be very accurately <span style="color: #ff0000;">stated.+ </span>They<br/>
are most numerous in the towns of Northern Egypt, around the<br/>
ancient Coptos, at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Negadeh</span>, Luxor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>, Dendera, Girgeh, Tahta,<br/>
and particularly at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assitt </span>and Akhmim. A large proportion of the<br/>
population of all these places is Coptic.<br/>
<br/>
The Coptic Patriarch is elected from their own number by the monks<br/>
of the five chief monasteries of Egypt. These are the monasteries of St.<br/>
Anthony and St. Paul in the western desert (p. IN), the two in the valley<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Natron </span>Lakes, and the large convent <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Maragh (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">191</span>), near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Monfa1it.t</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the Copts that dwell in towns are engaged in the more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">refined </span>handicrafts (as <span style="color: #0000FF;">watchmakers</span>, goldsmiths, <span style="color: #ff0000;">jewellers</span>, embroiderers, tailors, weavers, <span style="color: #ff0000;">oabinet-makers</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">turners</span>, manufacturers<br/>
of spurious antiquities, <span style="color: #0000FF;">em</span>), or in trade, or as clerks, accountants,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">notaries</span>. Their physique is accordingly materially different<br/>
from that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin </span>and even from that of Coptic peasants.<br/>
They are generally of more delicate frame, with small hands and<br/>
feet; their necks are longer and their skulls are higher and narrower<br/>
than those of the peasantry; and, lastly, their complexion is fairer.<br/>
These differences are <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>accounted for by their mode of<br/>
life; for, when we compare <span style="color: #ff0000;">those </span>Copts who are engaged in <span style="color: #0000FF;">rustic<br/>
</span>pursuits, or the Coptic <span style="color: #ff0000;">eamel-drivers </span>of Upper Egypt, with the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fellil1in</span>, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">tlad </span>that the two races are not distinguishable from<br/>
<br/>
' The total <span style="color: #0000FF;">number </span>of Oriental Christians in Egypt (Copts, Greeks,<br/>
and Armenians) is 645,775, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>63 per cent of the entire population. The<br/>
total number of all Christians (including Protestants and Roman Catholics)<br/>
is 731,235, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>7.51 per cent of the total.<br/>
