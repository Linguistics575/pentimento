<br/>
</span>cloth, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they sometimes hold aloft and sometimes wrap <span style="color: #0000FF;">round<br/>
</span>their head or face with both hands. Men wear <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>mourning clothes.<br/>
The women, especially in the country, frequently put dust on their<br/>
brows and breasts, or stain their hands and forearms blue. These<br/>
practices, though forbidden by the Prophet, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>survivals from<br/>
antiquity,, as may be seen on comparing the representations of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span>funerals at Thebes and elsewhere. The mourning women<br/>
occasionally interrupt their lamentations to rest on the ground and<br/>
smoke. Rich men, or pious <span style="color: #ff0000;">shekhs </span>and'ulama are buried with<br/>
greater pomp, to which religious fraternities and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dervishes </span>with<br/>
their flags contribute; water is distributed; and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">riding-horse<br/>
</span>and a buffalo are led in the procession. The buffalo is slaughtered<br/>
at the tomb and its flesh distributed among the poor.<br/>
<br/>
Another custom peculiar to the Muslims is the separation of<br/>
the sexes even after death. In family-vaults one side is set apart<br/>
for the men, the other for the women. Between these vaults is the<br/>
entrance to the tomb, usually covered with a single large slab. The<br/>
vaults are high enough to admit of the deceased sitting upright in<br/>
them when he is being examined by the angels Munkar and Nekir<br/>
on the first night after his interment (see <span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1xiv</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Religious and Popular Festivals of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedans</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The dates of these festivals, which may all be seen to the best advantage <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Cairo, cannot easily be given according to the European computation of time, owing to the variable character of the Arabian <span style="color: #ff0000;">lunaryear </span>(comp.<br/>
p. lxix). Calendars reducing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedan </span>and Coptic reckoning of<br/>
time to the European system may, however, be obtained at any <span style="color: #ff0000;">bookse1ler</span>'s.<br/>
<br/>
The first month <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the Arabian year is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moharrem</span>, the first ten<br/>
days of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">{</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'ashr</span>), and particularly the 10th <span style="color: #ff0000;">fy6m'ushdrw</span>, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">considered </span>holy. On these days <span style="color: #0000FF;">alms </span>are distributed<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and amulets purchased.<br/>
Mothers, even of the upper classes, carry their children on their <span style="color: #0000FF;">shoulders</span>, or cause them to be carried, through the streets, and sew into the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">children</span>'s caps the copper coins presented to them by <span style="color: #0000FF;">passers-by</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
10th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moharrem</span>, the highly <span style="color: #ff0000;">revered'Aghha </span>day, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>which Adam and Eve<br/>
are said first to have met <span style="color: #0000FF;">after </span>their expulsion from Paradise, on which<br/>
Noah is said to have left the ark, and on which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hosea</span>, the grandson of<br/>
the Prophet, fell as a martyr to his religion at the battle of Kerbela<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gilmira </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Hosén </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">42</span>) is visited by a vast concourse of religious devotees, whose riotous proceedings had better not be inspected except from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>carriage. Troops of Persians in long white robes parade the streets,<br/>
cutting themselves with swords in the forehead until the blood streams<br/>
down and stains their snowy garments<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Two boys, representing Hasan<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eosén</span>, are also led through the streets on horseback, with bloodstained clothes.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Safar</span>, the second month, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>at the beginning of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ralyit<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">et-awwet</span>, the third, the MECCA CARAVAN (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lxix</span>) returns home, its approach being announced by outriders. Some of the faithful who go to<br/>
meet the procession proceed as far as three days' journey, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>most of<br/>
them await its arrival at the Birket <span style="color: #0000FF;">21- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1019</span>, or pilgrims' lake.<br/>
Detached groups of pilgrims <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>return before the rest of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cavalcade</span>, and their arrival is always <span style="color: #ff0000;">signalised </span>by the blowing of <span style="color: #0000FF;">trumpets </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">beating </span>of drums. A pyramidal wooden erection, called the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Malynal</span>, hung with beautifully embroidered <span style="color: #0000FF;">stuffs</span>, and carried by a<br/>
camel, <span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanies </span>the procession as a symbol of royalty<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The interior<br/>
of the Mahmal is empty, and to the outside of it are attached two copies<br/>
