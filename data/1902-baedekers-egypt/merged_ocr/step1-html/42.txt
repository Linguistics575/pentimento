II. Geographical and Political Notice.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>. Area and Subdivisions of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
EGYPT proper, the country between the mouth of the Nile and<br/>
the First Cataract (comp. p. 335), is a small region with well-defined<br/>
natural boundaries on three sides. On <span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span>. is the Mediterranean<br/>
Sea, on the E. the Arabian Desert and the Red Sea, and on the W.<br/>
the Libyan Desert. The S. boundary is not marked by any natural<br/>
feature, and has therefore at all ages been liable to alteration. Its<br/>
fluctuations, sometimes to the N., sometimes to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>, form a kind<br/>
of standard of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fluctuating </span>political power of Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>causes<br/>
of the variations involve a great part of Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">history</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the<br/>
most ancient times down to the present day.<br/>
<br/>
When Mohammad'Ali, the founder of the modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">vessel </span>kingdom of Egypt (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">xoix</span>), died in 1849, he bequeathed to his<br/>
successor a power extending far to the S. of the First Cataract, and<br/>
including not only the Nubian Valley of the Nile, with the Nubian<br/>
desert-regions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>also .the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>Egyptian Sudan (Beled <span style="color: #0000FF;">es-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sudan'land </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">blaeks</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, consisting of the districts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Takes</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">iiiiriilr</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kordofan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The Khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">il </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>c) pushed his<br/>
boundaries towards the S. until they comprised the whole course of<br/>
the White Nile and the greater part of the river-region of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bohr<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Oaztd</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span>extended to about <span style="color: #ff0000;">20 </span>N. latitude. But these<br/>
territories were lost again even more rapidly than they had been<br/>
won. The rebellion of the Arab tribes that broke out in 1883 under<br/>
the Mahdi (pp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxii</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eii</span>) not only utterly destroyed the new <span style="color: #ff0000;">E </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">gyptian<br/>
</span>power on the White Nile, but also wrested the entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sudan </span>as far<br/>
as Lower Nubia from the Khedive. The campaigns of 1896-98 and<br/>
the capture of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Omdurman </span>(p. 388), however, finally united the Sudan<br/>
with Egypt, though under totally altered conditions. Thus Egypt<br/>
strictly so called now includes the valley of the Nile up to a point<br/>
25 M. to the N. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©di </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Halfa</span>, the desert-strip along the Red Sea,<br/>
the coast to the W. of Alexandria as far as the Gulf of Solun, the<br/>
great Libyan Desert with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>Oases, the greater part of the Sinai<br/>
Peninsula, and the region of El-'Arish (comp. Baedeker's Palestine,<br/>
p. 143). Its area, exclusive of the deserts, may be estimated at<br/>
about 12,970 sq. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M.</span>, of which about 9160 sq. M. are cultivable. The<br/>
Sudan, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>begins on the Nile a little to the N. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Haifa<br/>
</span>and on the Red <span style="color: #0000FF;">See </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">220 </span>N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IM.</span>, is under a <span style="color: #0000FF;">special </span>Anglo-Egyptian<br/>
administration (comp. p. 380).<br/>
<br/>
From the earliest times Egypt has been divided into two parts<br/>
of very unequal size, known as Lower and Upper Egypt. The<br/>
boundary between these is still, as in antiquity, to the S. of Cairo.<br/>
Upper Egypt, known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">tia'td</span>, formerly extended to the First <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cataract </span>only, but is now prolonged to the S. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">We'idi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Halfa</span>. Politically,<br/>
Egypt is no divided into fourteen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pnovmons </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mudtrtyeh</span>. The<br/>
