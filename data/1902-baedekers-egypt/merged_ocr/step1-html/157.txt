halls, the walls of which were occupied by religious inscriptions<br/>
and scenes <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">263</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. Like the passages within the pyramids,<br/>
these were exclusively destined for the reception of the sarcophagus, while the rock itself represented the mass of masonry<br/>
originally reared over the grave. Since there was no room among<br/>
the mountains for <span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulchral </span>temples, the latter were built (usually<br/>
on a large scale) on the plain, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>their ruins remain to this<br/>
day (<span style="color: #ff0000;">19</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>2.60).<br/>
<br/>
The grandees of the late period followed the example of their<br/>
predecessors under the Middle Empire by imitating the tombs of<br/>
the Pharaohs in preparing their own private graves. This was the<br/>
case in Thebes at least. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Asas'if </span>(p. 284) near Thebes we find in<br/>
their tombs a complicated series of corridors and halls, the walls of<br/>
which are decorated with nothing but religious texts and <span style="color: #ff0000;">represents<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tions</span>. Unfortunately none of the royal tombs of the last native<br/>
dynasty have as yet been discovered; these must have lain near the<br/>
large capitals in the Delta. Even of the larger private tombs of this<br/>
epoch few have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">found</span>, with the exception of those above<br/>
mentioned at Thebes and a few others at Gizeh and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salrlplra</span>, now<br/>
buried in rubbish.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomas OF THE HUMBLER <span style="color: #0000FF;">CLASSES </span>must, of course, have<br/>
largely outnumbered those of the grandees; but beyond the pit<br/>
which concealed the bodies, and some <span style="color: #0000FF;">gravestone</span>, they have left<br/>
no traces. From pictures we know that under the New Empire they<br/>
were frequently in the form of small brick-pyramids; but all have<br/>
fallen victims to time. The poorer classes were frequently buried<br/>
in Common Tombs, consisting of long corridors constructed underground by speculators. In these the corpses were laid in plain <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoff1ng<br/>
</span>or merely bound to a plank, accompanied by simple gifts for their<br/>
use in the future world. But these common graves are now almost<br/>
all covered by drift sand, and all trace of them is lost.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>. Sculpture and Painting.<br/>
<br/>
No fair estimate of the achievements of early-Egyptian sculpture or of its masters can be obtained from a study of the ordinary<br/>
colossal statues, sphinxes, and temple-reliefs; for these, though<br/>
they are now the most conspicuous examples of Egyptian sculpture, were, with few exceptions, intended exclusively for decorative<br/>
purposes and were <span style="color: #0000FF;">executed </span>accordingly. For such an estimate an<br/>
acquaintance must be obtained with works produced by genuine<br/>
artists, such as the portrait statues and reliefs now preserved in the<br/>
Museum of Gizeh, and the reliefs on the walls of <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastabas</span>, of rock<br/>
tombs, and of a few special temples <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>notably the temple of Sethos<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abydos</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. Genuine art-works, it is true, are but thinly sown in<br/>
Egypt, and, owing to the enormous mass of sculpture that has been<br/>
preserved, it is perhaps more <span style="color: #ff0000;">difflin1lt </span>in this than in any other<br/>
branch of art for any one but an expert to discriminate the good<br/>
