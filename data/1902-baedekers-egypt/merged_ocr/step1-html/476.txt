very few houses of a better class. It occupies the site of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptotemdis<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hermiu</span>, a town founded and endowed with great privileges by<br/>
Ptolemy Soter <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. Its Egyptian name was Pso'i. Strabo described it<br/>
as'the largest town in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebaid </span>and not inferior in size to<br/>
Memphis; with a constitution drawn up in the Hellenic manner'<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>About <span style="color: #0000FF;">71/2 </span>M. to the W. of Menshiyeh, beside the village of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kawz'imil</span>, are large cemeteries of the most remote period.<br/>
<br/>
Beside the village <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I2-Al.utitva</span>, on the E. bank, are other <span style="color: #0000FF;">burial-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">places </span>of the Ancient and the New Empire. On the hill, close to a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">shtskh</span>'s tomb, are the ruins of an Egyptian brick fortress. - On<br/>
the W. bank is the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Ahaiwa </span>el- <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gharbiyeh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Gebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Titkh</span>, on the Arabian bank, approaches close to the<br/>
stream, about 3 M. below Menshiyeh. Extensive quarries (with<br/>
Greek, Latin, and Demotic inscriptions) exist here, especially<br/>
near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shékh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fifiisa</span>; these yielded building material for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolema</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">%<br/>
<br/>
</span>88 M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">tlirgeh </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">thrergaJ</span>, on the W. bank, is a railway-station (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p.191</span>)<br/>
and has post and telegraph <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftiees</span>. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>formerly the capital of<br/>
the province of Girgeh (comp. p. 215), and contains over 17,000<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab.</span>, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom </span>4800 are Copts. Many of the houses in the town<br/>
are built <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">burnt </span>brick and decorated with glazed tiles. The bazaar<br/>
resembles those of other Nile towns. Outside the town lies a Roman<br/>
Catholic convent, which is probably the oldest but one in Egypt;<br/>
the abbot is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>member of the Fraternity of the Holy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sepulchre</span>.<br/>
The town looks very picturesque as seen from the river. The Nile<br/>
makes a sharp bend here, and the effect is as if the W. bank, on<br/>
which the town stands, was at right angles to the E. bank. The<br/>
Arabian mountains rise like walls, and the four tall minarets of the<br/>
town, on the opposite bank of the Nile, seem to vie with them in<br/>
height. A picturesque group on the river-brink is formed by an old<br/>
and dilapidated mosque and a tall minaret beside it.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meshaikh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the E. bank, opposite Girgeh, scholars will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span>remains of a temple built by Ramses II. and restored by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Merenptah</span>.<br/>

the large cemetery of which is still used by the Christian inhabitants<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Girgeh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The Arabian mountains, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>approach close to the river<br/>
beyond the village, contain numerous tombs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">four </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which._ </span>at a considerable elevation, deserve special attention as being the <span style="color: #0000FF;">resting-places<br/>

bank, is a railway and mail station and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">starting-point </span>for the<br/>
