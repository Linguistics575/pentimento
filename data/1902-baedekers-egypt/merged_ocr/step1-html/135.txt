<br/>
a picture of the life of the ancient Egyptians. Under the ancient<br/>
empire the grandees alone were allowed to build themselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs</span>,<br/>
and that probably only by favour of the king. The ordinary citizens<br/>
had to content themselves with simple graves in which the necessaries for the future life were buried with the bodies. But at a<br/>
later period even the lower ranks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">society </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">huilt'everlasting </span>houses'<br/>
for themselves, at least so far as they possessed the means to do so.<br/>
The dead were under the protection of the local deities, and in some<br/>
instances also under special gods of the dead. Thus at Memphis<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultan</span>'s was the god of the dead and provided for their support, while<br/>
these functions were discharged at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assitit</span>. hy Wep-wat and at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahydos<br/>
</span>by the'Lord of the West'. But even at an early date these local gods<br/>
retired in favour of Osiris, who was originally the local deity of<br/>
Busiris in the Delta, where he ruled the dead in the fruitful fields.<br/>
The death which Osiris suffered <span style="color: #0000FF;">according </span>to the legend (p. cxx)<br/>
was the common lot of mortals; hut just as Osiris rose again, so a<br/>
man also could begin a new life, provided that the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">formulae<br/>
</span>were pronounced for him by some faithful son; he went to Osiris,<br/>
became united with the slain god, in fact was himself Osiris. Admission to the realm of Osiris depended upon the recitation of<br/>
magical formulas and <span style="color: #0000FF;">incantations</span>, a knowledge of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>he<br/>
communicated to the deceased. At the same time a virtuous life<br/>
upon earth was required to assure the deceased eternal happiness,<br/>
and he had therefore to undergo <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>trial <span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>Osiris and to prove<br/>
before forty-two <span style="color: #ff0000;">judges </span>that he was free from mortal sin. Before<br/>
this took place, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">hefore </span>his heart had <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>weighed hy Thout<br/>
in the scales of righteousness and found perfect, he might not enter<br/>
the future land. Opinions differed as to the place of abode of the<br/>
blessed dead. Their dwelling was usually located in the West, among<br/>
the mountains, and in the desert where the sun set. Some believed<br/>
that they inhabited the fertile fields of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Earu</span>, a fruitful country<br/>
where ploughing and reaping were carried on as upon earth, and<br/>
where the corn grew to the height of seven ells, forming a veritable<br/>
paradise for the Egyptian peasant. As the labour in this future land<br/>
might often be too great for the strength of the deceased, it <span style="color: #ff0000;">hecame<br/>
</span>the custom at the period of the Middle Empire to place Ushabtis in<br/>
the tomb along with him. These were little figures of men, which<br/>
were imbued with life by a magic spell written upon them, and<br/>
assisted the deceased in his labours.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Another </span>doctrine sought to unite the different conceptions of the<br/>
future life and placed the abodes of the blessed in Twat, the underworld. This was the country through which the sun passed at night. It<br/>
was believed to lie under the earth, to be roofed like the earth by a<br/>
sky, and to be traversed by a river. It was divided into twelve parts,<br/>
corresponding to the twelve hours of night, and, according to a<br/>
<br/>
certain view, separated <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>each other by massive doors (comp.<br/>
