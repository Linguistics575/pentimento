(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">203</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>affected Thebes <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>slightly. Its ruined temples were <span style="color: #0000FF;">rebuilt </span>under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Haremheb</span>, Sethos 1., and Ramses IL, and the wealth of<br/>
the god became greater than ever. An idea of the endowments of<br/>
the temple of Ammon may be gleaned from the fact that 3/4 of the<br/>
gifts lavished by Ramses m. upon the <span style="color: #ff0000;">godsof </span>Egypt fell to the share<br/>
of Ammon, so that, for <span style="color: #0000FF;">example</span>, of 113,433 slaves, no fewer than<br/>
86,486 were presented to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>deity. Under these <span style="color: #ff0000;">cirbumstances </span>it was natural that the arch-priests of Ammon should gradually grow to regard themselves as the chief persons in the state;<br/>
and they finally succeeded in usurping the throne and in uniting<br/>
for a time the royal title with the priestly office. But the sun of<br/>
Thebes began to set when the royal residence was transferred to<br/>
the Delta under the princes of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gist </span>Dynasty. In the 7th cent.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>the armies of the Assyrians penetrated as far as Thebes <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>plundered it; the Ethiopians planted their rule here and honoured<br/>
Ammon with buildings and inscriptions; the princes of the 26th<br/>
Dyn. did for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'is </span>what the princes of the 18th and 19th Dyn. had<br/>
done for the city <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofAmmon</span>, but they also paid their homage to the<br/>
great god of Thebes by erecting smaller buildings there. The invading army of Cambyses ascended as far as Upper Egypt, but seems<br/>
to have done little or no damage at Thebes. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektanebes</span>, one of<br/>
the native Egyptian princes who maintained themselves against the<br/>
Persians, found time and means to add a handsome pylon to the<br/>
temple of Ammon. Alexander the Great and the princes of the<br/>
house of the Lagidae probably found Thebes still a great though<br/>
decadent city, and they assisted to embellish it, as many buildings<br/>
dating from the period of the Ptolemies still attest. The town of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemars </span>(p. 217), founded and endowed with many privileges by<br/>
Ptolemy L, soon became the capital of Upper Egypt, and rapidly<br/>
proved a dangerous rival to the ancient metropolis. For a brief<br/>
interval Thebes, though politically and economically weakened, recovered its independence under native princes, by putting itself<br/>
at the head of the revolt in Upper Egypt against the Macedonian<br/>
domination under Epiphanes. But the rebellion was <span style="color: #0000FF;">speedily<br/>
</span>crushed and Thebes once more reduced to the rank of a prov <span style="color: #ff0000;">incial<br/>
</span>town. Its decline steadily continued and the great city gradually<br/>
became a mere <span style="color: #0000FF;">congeries </span>of villages. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lnder </span>Ptolemy X. Soter II.<br/>
it again rebelled, but after a siege of three years was captured and<br/>
destroyed. In spite of its evil fate it once more revolted, taking<br/>
part in the Upper Egyptian insurrection in 30-29 B.C. against the<br/>
oppressive taxation of the Romans. Cornelius Gallus, the prefect<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">xc</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;">overthrew </span>the rebels and utterly destroyed the ancient town.<br/>
Thenceforward Thebes is only mentioned as a goal <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inquisitive<br/>
</span>travellers, who under the Roman emperors were attracted to the Nile<br/>
by two monuments in particular - the pyramids and the musical<br/>
colossus <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnon </span>on the W. bank at Thebes.<br/>
