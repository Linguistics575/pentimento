<span>1 THE NILE. River Basin.<br/>
<br/>
white, or rather <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'elear</span>' river, whose water descends from clear<br/>
lakes and is farther filtered by the vast grassy plains and occasional<br/>
floating plants through which it passes. The Blue Nile [ together<br/>
with the Atbara) may <span style="color: #0000FF;">therefore </span>be <span style="color: #0000FF;">regarded-as </span>the sole origin "the<br/>
fertility of Egypt, and also as the cause of the inundation, while on<br/>
the other hand the regular and steady supply of water afforded by<br/>
the White Nile performs the very important office of preventing the<br/>
lower part of the river from <span style="color: #0000FF;">drying </span>up altogether in summer. The<br/>
White Nile is not only much larger than the Blue in average volume,<br/>
but is, with its tributaries, more than double the length.<br/>
<br/>
The Valley of the Nile from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttun </span>to the Delta, although<br/>
from its great length (<span style="color: #0000FF;">150 </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">latitude</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>necessarily possessing great<br/>
varieties of climate, forms one long unbroken tract of country, the<br/>
fertilising soil <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is brought down by the Blue Nile from the<br/>
Abyssinian mountains.<br/>
<br/>
The breadth of the Valley of the Nile, including the barren land<br/>
immediately flanking it, varies from 5 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">wh </span>miles in Nubia, and<br/>
from 121/2 to 31 miles in Egypt. The banks, of which the eastern is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span>the'Arabian', and the western <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Libyan</span>', rise at places<br/>
to upwards of 1000 ft., resembling two large <span style="color: #ff0000;">eanal-embankments</span>,<br/>
between which the river has forced its passage through the plateau<br/>
of'Nubian sandstone' (which extends to the Gebel Silsileh), and<br/>
through the nummulite limestone of Upper and Central Egypt.<br/>
The breadth of the cultivable alluvial soil <span style="color: #0000FF;">corresponds </span>with the<br/>
above varying width, but nowhere exceeds 10 miles. The soil deposited by the Nile averages <span style="color: #0000FF;">33-38 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span>deep in Egypt, but near<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ifalyt1tr </span>at the head of the Delta it increases to about 50 ft., the<br/>
bottom of it being at places below the level of the sea. The bed of<br/>
the river is also of considerable depth, and at low water the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mudbanks </span>(gef) rise above its surface to a height of 25 ft. in Upper<br/>
Egypt, and 14 ft. at Cairo. These are also the depths of the various<br/>
irrigation-wells.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile soil is unlike <span style="color: #0000FF;">any </span>other in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>world in its composition.<br/>
According to Regnault it <span style="color: #0000FF;">contains </span>63 per cent of water and sand, 18 per<br/>
cent of carbonate of lime, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>) per cent of oxide of <span style="color: #0000FF;">iron</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>per cent of carbonate of magnesia.<br/>
<br/>
The INUNDATION is more <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>less favourable according to the<br/>
greater or less amount <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rain </span>that falls among the Abyssinian mountains, for that <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>falls in Central Africa is a more constant<br/>
quantity, being regulated by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">trade-winds</span>. Like<br/>
the waterspouts which descend on equatorial Africa, the overflow<br/>
always recurs at the same season of the year, varying in its advent<br/>
by a few days only, and in its depth by several yards. At the beginning of <span style="color: #0000FF;">June </span>the river slowly begins to swell, and between the<br/>
15th and 20th of July the increase becomes very rapid. Towards<br/>
the end of September the water ceases to rise, <span style="color: #0000FF;">remaining </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the same<br/>
height for twenty or thirty days, but during the first half of October<br/>
