<br/>
</span>registering the amount of grain; brewing; weaving (much defaced).<br/>
A vaulted corridor leads hence to a second Hall with pillars, at<br/>
the back of which is a recess. From this tomb we may descend<br/>
direct to the river-bank. - Several smaller tombs have been found<br/>
on a lower platform. - Higher up than the tombs are the remains<br/>
of a Coptic convent.<br/>
<br/>
The summit of the hill, which, however, is not reached without<br/>
some <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty</span>, is crowned by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ifubbet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et-hawa</span>, the small tomb<br/>
of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh</span>. It commands <span style="color: #ff0000;">a- </span>very fine view of the Nile valley, the<br/>
district of the cataracts, and the desert. - From this point <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>may<br/>
reach the convent of St. Simeon in <span style="color: #0000FF;">/ </span>hr., by a route following the<br/>
telegraph-poles.<br/>
<br/>
The Convent of "Simeon (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dér </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Anba </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sama'tm</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>is situated on<br/>
a hill in the desert on the W. bank of the Nile. Landing opposite<br/>
the S. end of Elephantine, we follow a desert-valley, passing several<br/>
rock-tombs, and in 20 min. reach our goal<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>This is one of the<br/>
largest and best preserved Coptic <span style="color: #0000FF;">convents</span>, though it has been<br/>
abandoned by the monks since the 13th century. Nothing certain<br/>
is known as to the date of its origin. It stands surrounded by a<br/>
wall, over 20 ft. high, the lower part of which is built of hewn<br/>
stone, the upper part <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bricks </span>of Nile-mud. The two-storied <span style="color: #0000FF;">MAIN<br/>
</span>BUILDING lies to the N. The lower story contains a large central<br/>
vaulted corridor, with cells opening off it on each side. On the E.<br/>
wall of the corridor is a painting (only half preserved) of Christ<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">onthroned</span>, with the Archangel Michael and six Apostles beside him.<br/>
Each of the small cells contained six or eight beds, some of which<br/>
still remain. At the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. angle is the refectory. The staircase is<br/>
continued in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>angle to the next story, which is similarly<br/>
arranged, and thence to the roof. - Below the main building are<br/>
several <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-hewn </span>cells and a <span style="color: #ff0000;">roek-ehapel</span>, with a tastefully painted<br/>
ceiling and pictures of saints.<br/>
<br/>
To the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>. of the main building, between it and the girdle<br/>
wall, is the CHURCH, comprising nave and aisles and a choir with<br/>
sacristies on each side. The roof was vaulted throughout. In the<br/>
semi-dome of the choir is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>painting of Christ enthroned, <span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>four angels. At the W. end of the nave, opposite the <span style="color: #0000FF;">choir</span>,<br/>
is a domed recess with a fresco of Christ with two angels bowing<br/>
<br/>
before him. There are numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span>inscriptions in the sacristies.<br/>
On the rocky plateau <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the S. of the convent lie considerable quantities of iron <span style="color: #0000FF;">dross</span>.<br/>

Excursion to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Most </span>travellers to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philaz </span>avail themselves (for the outward journey at<br/>
least) of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">MILITARY </span>RAILWAY, which performs the journey from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assu'im<br/>
</span>in 1 hr. (fares 10 pias., 3 <span style="color: #0000FF;">pias.</span>, 1 <span style="color: #0000FF;">pies</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. But the <span style="color: #0000FF;">DESERT </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ROUTE </span>is preferable (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hrs</span>, donkey 5 <span style="color: #0000FF;">pias</span>, there and back <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>pies)<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>whether we follow it throughout <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>diverge from it to follow the riverbank for part of the way. In the latter case we may, on the return,<br/>
