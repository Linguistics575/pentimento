<br/>
produces an imposing effect. The columns, all of marble of various<br/>
kinds, were once 366 in number. Their heterogeneous nature is<br/>
accounted for by the fact that they were brought from Roman and<br/>
Byzantine buildings in Cairo and were adapted to their new <span style="color: #0000FF;">functions </span>by rude Procrustean methods of lengthening or shortening.<br/>
<br/>
The facades of the Court (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Salm</span>) have no pretensions to <span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquity</span>; the arches (many defective) are of a curious shape, which<br/>
it is <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieult </span>to classify either as pointed, round, or horseshoe<br/>
shaped. The court itself is now planted with trees. In the centre<br/>
is a fountain, beside a palm-tree. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">South-Eastern </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lhvtn </span>is<br/>
the sanctuary. In front of the pulpit is a column of grey marble,<br/>
on which, by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">freak </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">nature</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the names of Allah, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suleiman </span>in Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">characters</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the outline of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">prophet's'kurbatslf </span>appear in veins of a lighter colour. This column<br/>
is believed by the Muslims to have been transported miraculously<br/>
from Mecca to Cairo by the Khalif'Omar. In the N.E. corner is<br/>
the Tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheikh'Abdallah</span>, son of "Amr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>,<br/>
which consisted of a single row of columns only, a Pair <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Columns<br/>
</span>alone remains. They are placed very close together<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">said<br/>
</span>that none but honest men could squeeze themselves between them.<br/>
<br/>
This <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosque </span>is almost disused. On the last Friday in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">month </span>of<br/>
fasting, however, a solemn service is annually held here, in which the<br/>
Khedive and bis <span style="color: #0000FF;">grandee</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>take part. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the remaining <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fridays </span>throughout<br/>
fhe year a handful of <span style="color: #0000FF;">poor </span>Muslims, <span style="color: #0000FF;">mostly </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">working </span>classes, assemble<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tor </span>worship in the venerable but poorly preserved sanctuary. - In 1808<br/>
this <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosque </span>witnessed a very remarkable scene. The whole of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mehammedan </span>priesthood, the Christian clergy of every sect, and the Jewish<br/>
rabbis. with <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">accord</span>, assembled in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosque </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofiAmr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>pray for the<br/>
rise of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">File</span>, which had delayed beyond the usual period.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>it not uninteresting to visit one of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kulleh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ncmufrtetories </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>and S. sides of the mosque <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cbalrshtsh</span>,<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">l'ew </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">copper </span>coins). The porous water-jars (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabie </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kultehi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>used<br/>
throughout the whole of Egypt are <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>manufactured at <span style="color: #ff0000;">fieneh<br/>
</span>in Upper Egypt of light-grey clay of very equal consistency. The<br/>
remarkably uniform and delicate porosity of the vessels is produced<br/>
by mixing the clay with ashes. The rapid evaporation caused by<br/>
the porosity of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">kulleh </span>cools the liquid within to a temperature<br/>
of 12-140 lower than that of the surrounding air.<br/>
<br/>
A visit to the Tombs of the Mamelukes (p. 68) may be conveniently made <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>this point. Continuing to follow the road<br/>
across the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rubbish-hills </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fost√©t</span>, we observe on our right a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mar</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lim </span>burial-ground, and at a <span style="color: #0000FF;">short </span>distance in front of us the old<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">aqueduct </span>(p. 69). A little to the right, on an eminence, rises an<br/>
old ruined mosque <span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gami'a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">AM </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Su'ad</span>), beyond it is the Citadel<br/>
with the mosque of Mohammed'Ali, and farther distant are the<br/>
hills of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">am </span>with the mosque of (<span style="color: #ff0000;">r1y11shi </span>(p. 108). This<br/>
view is very <span style="color: #0000FF;">striking </span>towards sunset. The road, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>becomes <span style="color: #0000FF;">bad<br/>
</span>beyond this point, leads round the ruined mosque <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ascends<br/>
<br/>
