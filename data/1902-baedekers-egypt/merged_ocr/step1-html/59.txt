small banks which lend money on good security, <span style="color: #0000FF;">both </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">peasantry<br/>
</span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">government-officials</span>, at a rate <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">interest </span>sometimes amounting to 6 per cent monthly, the maximum permitted <span style="color: #0000FF;">bY </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">law</span>. The<br/>
Greeks are the only Europeans who have established themselves<br/>
permanently as merchants beyond the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfineg </span>of Egypt proper. The<br/>
entire trade with the Sudan is now in their hands. The Greeks also<br/>
have the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unenviable </span>notoriety of committing numerous murders,<br/>
thefts, and other crimes, but it must be borne in mind that they are<br/>
by far the most numerous section of the European community (38,200<br/>
from Greece alone, besides about as many who are Turkish <span style="color: #ff0000;">subjeetsl</span>, and that some 30,000 of them belong to the lowest class of<br/>
immigrants. The superiority of the Greeks to the Orientals is nowhere so strikingly manifested as in Egypt, where it affords a <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern<br/>
</span>reflex of their ancient, world-renowned <span style="color: #0000FF;">supremacy</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Italian residents, 24,454 in number, consist <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>of traders of a humble <span style="color: #ff0000;">class</span>, advocates, and musicians, from the operatic<br/>
singer down to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Calabrian </span>itinerant. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>French nationality<br/>
(14,172) are all the artizans of the higher class, who are generally<br/>
noted for their skill, trustworthiness, and sobriety, and indeed<br/>
form the most respectable stratum of the European community.<br/>
Most of the better shops are kept by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frenchmen</span>, and the chief<br/>
European <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>of the government, including several architects<br/>
and engineers, are French. The British settlers numbered 6118 in<br/>
1882 and in 1897 about 14,654, exclusive of the troops, of which<br/>
there were 4909. Until recently their specialities were the manufacture of machinery and the construction of railways and harbours;<br/>
but <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">late </span>they have also almost monopolised the chief posts in<br/>
those branches of the administration (army, post and <span style="color: #ff0000;">telegraphoffiee</span>,<br/>
railways, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ustom-house</span>) that have been remodelled after the<br/>
European pattern. A large majority of the residents who enjoy the<br/>
protection of the British consulate are Maltese (6481) and to them<br/>
apply even more forcibly most of the remarks already <span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">regarding<br/>
</span>the Greeks. It has been ascertained that the Maltese settlers in<br/>
foreign countries are more numerous than those resident in their two<br/>
small native islands, and of these a considerable proportion <span style="color: #0000FF;">belongs </span>to Egypt. At home, under the discipline of British institutions, they form a pattern little nation of their own, but in Egypt,<br/>
where they are freed from the restraint of these <span style="color: #ff0000;">influenees</span>, they<br/>
are very apt to degenerate and to swell unduly the ranks of the<br/>
criminal class. Many of the Maltese, however, are enterprising<br/>
tradesmen and industrious artizans, such as shoemakers <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">joiners</span>.<br/>
To the Austrian (7115) and German (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1281</span>) community belong a<br/>
number of merchants of the best class, many physicians and <span style="color: #ff0000;">teaehers</span>, inn-keepers, musicians, and lastly humble <span style="color: #ff0000;">handicraftsmen</span>.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to the capability of Europeans of becoming <span style="color: #ff0000;">aoclimatised </span>in Egypt, there are <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">number </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">widely </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">diverge11t0pi11ions</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Much, of course, must depend on the nature <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>climate of their<br/>
<br/>
