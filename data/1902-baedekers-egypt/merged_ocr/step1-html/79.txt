<br/>
reverberates <span style="color: #0000FF;">thrillingly </span>through the stillness of night, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">incite<br/>
</span>to devotion the <span style="color: #0000FF;">faithful </span>who are still awake. - The duty of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">washing </span>before prayer is a sanitary institution, and tanks are provided for the purpose in the court of every mosque. In the desert<br/>
the faithful are permitted to use sand for this religious <span style="color: #0000FF;">ablution</span>.<br/>
The person praying must remove his shoes or sandals and <span style="color: #0000FF;">tu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>his thee towards Mecca, as the Jews and some <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Christian sects<br/>
turn towards Jerusalem or towards the East. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">worshipper </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">begins<br/>
</span>by putting his hands to the lobes of his ears, and then holds them<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little below his girdle; and he intersperses his recitations from<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koren </span>with certain prostrations performed in a given order. On<br/>
Fridays the midday recital of prayer takes place three quarters of an<br/>
hour earlier than usual, and is followed by a sermon. Friday is not,<br/>
however, regarded as a day of rest, business being transacted. It has,<br/>
however, of late <span style="color: #0000FF;">become </span>customary to close the courts of justice in<br/>
imitation of the Christian practice of keeping Sunday. - The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mus..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lims </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently </span>recite as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>prayer the first <span style="color: #ff0000;">S1ireh </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koran</span>, one<br/>
of the shortest, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is used as <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>employ the Lord's prayer. It is<br/>
called <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-tttlla </span>('the <span style="color: #0000FF;">commencing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, and is to the following <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect'.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'In </span>the name of God, the merciful and gracious. Praise be to God,<br/>
the Lord of creatures, the merciful and gracious, the Prince of the<br/>
day of judgment; we serve Thee, and we pray to Thee for help;<br/>
lead us in the right way of those to whom thou hast shown mercy,<br/>
upon whom no <span style="color: #0000FF;">wrath </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">resteth</span>, and who go not astray. Amen'.<br/>
Another important duty of the believer is to observe the FAST of<br/>
the month Ramadan (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxvi</span>). From daybreak to sunset throughout<br/>
the month eating <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>drinking are absolutely prohibited, and the<br/>
devout even scrupulously avoid swallowing their saliva. The fast<br/>
