<span>120 Route 8. SECOND PYRAMID. Pyramids<br/>
<br/>
the lid of which had disappeared before the time of the French<br/>
expedition (p. 116). Length <span style="color: #0000FF;">772 </span>ft., width 3 ft. <span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">in.</span>, height 3 ft.<br/>
4 inches. The very massive sides ring with a clear tone when struck.<br/>
Curiously enough, the King's Chamber does not lie exactly in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">line<br/>
</span>with the diagonal of the Pyramid, but is 16 ft. 4 in. to the S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Air Shafts (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">G</span>, H), the ends of which are seen about<br/>
3 ft. above the floor of the chamber, were perhaps constructed from<br/>
religious motives. They are about 6 in. in height <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>8 in. in width<br/>
only, expanding by a few inches at the outer extremities. The N,<br/>
shaft is <span style="color: #ff0000;">234 </span>ft., and the S. shaft 174 ft. long.<br/>
<br/>
We now retrace our steps, and, on emerging from these <span style="color: #ff0000;">aweinspiring </span>recesses, hail the light and air with no little satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>
The other chambers in the interior of the Great Pyramid as yet <span style="color: #0000FF;">discovered </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">inaccessible</span>. The first passage <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>, b, <span style="color: #0000FF;">v</span>, which is blocked at b,<br/>
leads downwards in a straight line, 293 ft. in <span style="color: #0000FF;">length</span>, and terminates in a<br/>
horizontal corridor, 27 ft. in length, <span style="color: #ff0000;">3ft</span>. in height, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span>in width,<br/>
which leads to the unfinished subterranean chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span>, hewn in the rock.<br/>
The E. and W. sides of this chamber are each <span style="color: #0000FF;">46 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>length, the N.<br/>
and S. sides 27 ft., and the height <span style="color: #0000FF;">101,12 </span>ft. It does not lie in a line<br/>
with the diagonal of the Pyramid, and its floor <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1011/2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">below </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">level </span>on which the Pyramid is built. The subterranean horizontal <span style="color: #0000FF;">passage </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">80 </span>ft. long, ends in a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cul-de-sac</span>. The statement of Herodotus that<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">suhterranean </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">chamher </span>planned by <span style="color: #ff0000;">thops </span>for the reception of his<br/>
body was surrounded by a canal <span style="color: #0000FF;">conducted </span>hither from the Nile, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">erroneous</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>the chamber lies above the highest level of the overflow of<br/>
the river, and it has, moreover, been ascertained that no channel from the<br/>
river ever led in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">direction</span>. - From the lower end of the Great Hall<br/>
a shaft, discovered hy Davison in 1763, descends to the lower passage,<br/>
and is erroneously known as the'Well'. The enterprising <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caviglia </span>found<br/>
that it terminated in the passage leading to the subterranean chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">r</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>.<br/>
To <span style="color: #ff0000;">all </span>appearance it was bored through the masonry after the latter had<br/>
been finished.<br/>
<br/>
The Second Pyramid, called by the Egyptians <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wer- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khafr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?<br/>
</span>('Great is <span style="color: #ff0000;">KhafrrE</span>'), was erected by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khafre</span>, who was called Khephren<br/>
by the Greeks (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxix</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, but his name has not been discovered on<br/>
any part of the structure. Owing to the greater height of the rocky<br/>
plateau on which it stands, it appears higher than its larger neigh:<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hour</span>. The perpendicular height of this Pyramid is now <span style="color: #ff0000;">4471/3 </span>ft.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>formerly 454 ft.), each side of the base measures <span style="color: #ff0000;">6901/2 </span>ft. (originally 7073/4 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the height of each sloping side is <span style="color: #ff0000;">5631/2 </span>ft.<br/>
(originally 5721/2 ft.), while the sides rise at an angle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">52Â°20</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>.<br/>
The solid content of the masonry is now 2,156,960 cubic yds., equivalent to 4,883,000 tons in weight (originally 2,426,710 cub. yds.,<br/>
equivalent to 5,309,000 tons)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>As the rocky site rises towards the<br/>
W. and N., a considerable part of it required to be removed in order that a level surface might be obtained. The levelled space surrounding the base of the Pyramid was paved with blocks of limestone (see p. 126). To the E. are remains of the temple erected for<br/>
the worshippers of the deceased Pharaoh, a structure of the kind<br/>
which probably adjoined all pyramids (<span style="color: #ff0000;">pp.124</span>, 127). The <span style="color: #ff0000;">inchtation </span>of the Pyramid, which must have been preserved almost intact<br/>
