<span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stands </span>in the shape of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>beetle with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>ram's head, and is worshipped by two human-headed birds, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">souls </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Khepere <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Atum.<br/>

throne at the end of the 19th Dyn. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1xxxiii</span>). His mother <span style="color: #0000FF;">Takhat<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">called'Bruee</span>'s Tomb' or'The Harper's Tomb', is inferior in size<br/>
only to No. 17 and No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>The style of the sculptures is not the<br/>
best, but the variety and richness of the representations are unexcelled. This tomb possesses a unique peculiarity in the ten <span style="color: #ff0000;">sidechambers</span>, opening off the first two corridors. The tomb was begun<br/>
and finished as far as Room <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Setnakht</span>, father <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>;<br/>
