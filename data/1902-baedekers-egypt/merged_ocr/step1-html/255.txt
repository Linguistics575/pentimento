<span>42 Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">J. </span>CAIRO. <span style="color: #0000FF;">P. </span>The Muski and<br/>
<br/>
features of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">traffie </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>) that surges up and down the street<br/>
from morning till night are still unchanged. - We ascend the Muski<br/>
to the small Rond-Point (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. D, 3), and thence follow the <span style="color: #ff0000;">SIKKEH<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">EL-GBDiDEH </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rust </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">News</span>) to the insignificant <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gtrmira </span>(mosque)<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Ashrtff</span>, built by Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bursbey </span>in 1422. Here we turn to the<br/>
left into the long line of thoroughfare beginning with the Shari'a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Khordagiyeh</span>, and at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cross-street </span>on the right we enter<br/>
a large covered bazaar, known as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan </span>el-Khalil.<br/>
<br/>
The Khan el-Khalil (P1. E, 3), which was once the centre of<br/>
the commercial <span style="color: #ff0000;">traffle </span>of Cairo, is said to have been founded as<br/>
early as the end of the 13th cent. on the site of ruined tombs of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs </span>by the Mameluke Sultan El-Ashrif Khalil. It forms a<br/>
distinct quarter of the city, and is intersected by a main street<br/>
and numerous cross-lanes, formed by long rows of stalls of tradesmen<br/>
and artizans, all covered over. Here are the headquarters of the<br/>
silk and carpet merchants and the vendors <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">trinkets</span>. We follow the<br/>
main avenue, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Srmrwr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">EL-BADISTAN</span>, which contains two graceful<br/>
Arab gateways. In the first lane on the left is the Bazaar ofthe<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoemakert</span>, in which the pretty red shoes of the Arabs may be<br/>
purchased. Farther on, to the right of the main street, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">some<br/>
</span>large Carpet Bazaars (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Asadolla </span>Irani, Hagg Ali <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khabestari</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The prices of Carpets, like those of other Oriental goods, are liable<br/>
to great <span style="color: #ff0000;">flnetuation</span>. Those of Baghdad and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Brussa </span>(in Asia Minor) <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>the most sought after. As soon as a purchaser <span style="color: #0000FF;">appears </span>the dealers spread<br/>
their <span style="color: #ff0000;">wares </span>over the whole court for his inspection. If the traveller is<br/>
pressed for time he had better not attempt to make a purchase<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>as several<br/>
hours must not unfrequently be spent in negotiation before a satisfactory<br/>
bargain is concluded. The usual price of a light <span style="color: #ff0000;">1asdrigeh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span>shawl for the<br/>
head) is about 50 pies, and of one <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">heavier </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">uality</span>, with red and yellow<br/>
stripes and interwoven with gold thread, 8 <span style="color: #0000FF;">400 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pies</span>. The fringes are<br/>
generally loosened and adjusted after the completion of the purchase.<br/>
Many of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>Damascene silks<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and particularly the lighter<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">kufftyehs </span>in pleasing colours, are manufactured at Lyons and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Crefeld</span>.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">tabIe-covers </span>of red, blue, or black cloth, embroidered with coloured<br/>
silk (<span style="color: #ff0000;">£13 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ive-Q</span>, are well worthy of notice. The letters with which they<br/>
are adorned rarely have any meaning.<br/>
<br/>
Taking the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">cross-lane </span>on the right and passing through<br/>
an interesting Arab Gateway, with stalactite vaulting, inscriptions,<br/>
serpentine ornamentation, and a few mosaics<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>we enter the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brass<br/>
</span>Bazaar, in which many travellers are tempted to purchase. Opposite the end of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sikket </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Btdistin </span>is the entrance of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosque<br/>
</span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seyidua </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hosén</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Gimi'a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Seyidna </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1.rostm </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. E, <span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>is the mosque of the<br/>
youthful <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hosén</span>, who fell at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kerbela </span>in 680 <span style="color: #0000FF;">AD</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in battle against<br/>
the enemies of his father'Ali, <span style="color: #0000FF;">son-in-law </span>of the prophet, who was<br/>
slain in 661. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eosén </span>is still highly venerated by Shi'ite Mohammedans (p. lxviii), particularly in Persia. The mosque is of no <span style="color: #0000FF;">architectural </span>importance, while it has been almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">completely </span>modernized, even to the introduction of gas-lighting. The chief attraction,<br/>
quite inaccessible to all but Muslims, is the mausoleum which is<br/>
<br/>
