<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">204 </span>Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">16</span>. TELL <span style="color: #ff0000;">EL-1AMARNA</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">From </span>Cairo<br/>
<br/>
of the king. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Tombs </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-'Amarna </span>contain the best examples<br/>
of this realistic tendency and are, therefore, of great importance in<br/>
the history of art.<br/>
<br/>
About <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/2 </span>M. to the N. of the landing-place at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hagg-Kandii<br/>
</span>are the ruins of the city. The position of the PALACE <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">AMENOPHIS </span>IV. is indicated by a house (known to the Arabs as <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Ken'iseh</span>)<br/>
erected by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Prof. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Flinders </span>Petrie to protect the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sumptuously </span>painted<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*Stucco </span>Pavements, which he discovered in the course of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">ex-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cavations </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1691-92</span>. There are four pavements, two in each room<br/>
of the protective house. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">let </span>Pavement (in the first room),<br/>
which originally decorated a hall of the harem borne by <span style="color: #ff0000;">twelye<br/>
</span>columns, is divided into two sections by a -1 -shaped band of captive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Asiatics </span>and negroes and bows <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>emblematic of the so-called<br/>
'nine nations of archers', the hereditary foes of Egypt ], which the<br/>
king thus trod under foot as he passed through the hall. In the<br/>
centre of each section is a rectangular pond with water-plants and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fishes</span>, surrounded by a thicket of <span style="color: #0000FF;">marsh-plants</span>, representing the<br/>
banks of the pond, enlivened with birds and animals. This thicket<br/>
was interrupted by the columns, the traces of which are quite<br/>
distinct. The entire pavement was surrounded with a border of<br/>
painted vases and bouquets of flowers. - The 2nd Pavement, in<br/>
the same room, is in poor preservation, though ornamental vases<br/>
and bouquets may be distinguished. - The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*3rd </span>Pavement (in the<br/>
second room) is the finest. It also is divided into two symmetrical<br/>
halves by a central band of bows and captives. On each side, in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">centre</span>, is a pond surrounded by a border of marsh-plants and<br/>
animals (interrupted by the columns), while at the sides (beyond<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>is a second similar border. The whole pavement,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">like </span>No. 1, is surrounded with a border of vases and nosegays. The<br/>
calves frisking in the marshy thicket are admirably drawn and<br/>
highly lifelike in their movements. The hall to which this <span style="color: #0000FF;">pavement </span>belonged had sixteen columns, the bases of three of which<br/>
are <span style="color: #0000FF;">still </span>in position. - The <span style="color: #ff0000;">dth </span>Pavement resembles the others in<br/>
arrangement but is in inferior preservation.<br/>
<br/>
The second room of this house contains also a few architectural fragments found among the ruins of the palace, including a portion <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>palm-column; three fine <span style="color: #0000FF;">alabaster </span>reliefs'en <span style="color: #0000FF;">creux</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>of captives; a fragment<br/>
of a relief of the king worshipping the sun, etc.<br/>
<br/>
To the S. of the protective house are remains of large <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades<br/>
</span>belonging to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">palace</span>. - To the E. lay the Library, in which the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">celebrated </span>tablets of Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">e1-'Amama </span>with cuneiform inscriptions<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">94</span>) were found.<br/>
<br/>
To the N.E. was the Great Temple, now almost completely<br/>
ruined; the square brick pillars of one of the large halls may still<br/>
be clearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">seen<br/>
<br/>
</span>The N. Group of Tombs <span style="color: #0000FF;">lies </span>about 11/2 M. to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span>. of the<br/>
palace<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
