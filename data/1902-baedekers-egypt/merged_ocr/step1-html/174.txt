<span>BUILDINGS OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>MOHAMMEDANS. <span style="color: #ff0000;">olxiii<br/>
<br/>
</span>top stories are used for hanging up the lamps during the fasting<br/>
month of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramadan</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Since the days of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahrite </span>Mameluke sultans <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1260 </span>AD.)<br/>
every mosque has possessed a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sybil</span>. or public fountain, except in cases<br/>
when a separate building is erected for this. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">sebils </span>are rooms<br/>
with bronze railings at which <span style="color: #0000FF;">passers-by </span>may obtain water, which is<br/>
supplied from cisterns placed beneath. The upper story of the sebil<br/>
is a kind of loggia, supported by columns and <span style="color: #0000FF;">covered </span>with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">tentfoot</span>, frequently in elegant <span style="color: #ff0000;">tirnber-arehiteeture</span>. This is the Maktab,<br/>
or elementary school. The detached columns that frequently embellish the exterior of these buildings <span style="color: #0000FF;">differentiate </span>them from all<br/>
the other parts of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mosque-fapade</span>, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>columns appear<br/>
only built into the angles or immured in the masonry.<br/>
<br/>
Tombs. - The tombs of sultans and emirs and of their families<br/>
are invariably built in connection with mosques (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxii</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
other hand the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shikh </span>Tombs, or tombs of saints, which are found<br/>
in all parts of the country, are independent structures, usually built<br/>
on the spot on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the revered deceased ended his <span style="color: #0000FF;">days</span>. These<br/>
closely resemble the mortuary chapels of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosques </span>and are, like<br/>
them, covered with domes. The ordinary tombs of the Muslims are<br/>
generally situated on high ground, beyond the <span style="color: #ff0000;">influenee </span>of the<br/>
moisture of the river, and preferably in the desert. The subterranean<br/>
vaulted chambers are generally large enough for four or more bodies,<br/>
and are destitute of decoration<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The corpse, wrapped in white<br/>
cotton cloth, is placed upon a bed of sand, with the face turned<br/>
towards Mecca. When both sexes are interred in the same vault a<br/>
partition-wall is erected to separate them. Above the vault stands a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cenotaph </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tarkibeh</span>) resting on a more or less decorated pedestal,<br/>
and bearing two upright columns of marble <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>other stone, one of<br/>
which, placed immediately over the head of the deceased, bears his<br/>
name and age, with texts from the Koran. At the top is represented<br/>
the turban of the deceased, the form of which indicates his rank.<br/>
Over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cenotaphs </span>of persons of distinction are frequently erected<br/>
canopies, resting on four columns or pilasters. Wealthy families<br/>
surrounded the tombs of their ancestors with extensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">building's<br/>
</span>(known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hash</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">including </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms </span>for mourners, sebil, school, stables,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eustodian</span>'s residence, etc. The tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs </span>and Mamelukes<br/>
at Cairo include many <span style="color: #0000FF;">erections </span>of this kind, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>lend the cemeteries the appearance of small half-deserted towns.<br/>
<br/>
The secular buildings are on the whole less interesting. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fortification</span>, of the citadel of Cairo, dating from the time of<br/>
Saladin, recall the <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>castles of Europe. Some of the numerous gates in the walls of Cairo date from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite </span>period;<br/>
they were probably built after Roman models and are distinguished<br/>
for the skill with which they are constructed, especially for accuracy<br/>
in the jointing of the stones.<br/>
