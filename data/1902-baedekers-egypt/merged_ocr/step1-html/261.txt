<span>48 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">d. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CAIRO</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>2. The Muski.<br/>
<br/>
vestibule and then the sanctuary, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>apartment with<br/>
lofty stilted arches. The decoration is simple. The lower part<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the wall with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prayer-niche </span>is, however, tastefully adorned<br/>
with gilded panels and coloured marbles, while the middle part<br/>
displays a rich mosaic of coloured marbles, terminating below in<br/>
charming dwarf arcades with colonnettes of blue glass. The upper<br/>
part of the wall bears inscriptions in bold black letters, interspersed<br/>
with gilded <span style="color: #0000FF;">arabesques </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>rosettes in marble medallions. The<br/>
coloured wooden <span style="color: #0000FF;">ceiling </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and'the </span>inlaid ornamentation of the pulpit<br/>
and doors also deserve notice. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the left is the mausoleum of<br/>
the sultan, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>on the right that of his family. The Liwin is<br/>
separated by a modern iron railing from the court, which is planted<br/>
with trees.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately adjoining the mosque is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">town-gate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bab </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ez-Zuwéleh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. E, l), at the end of the street. This is built of solid<br/>
blocks of stone and resembles the two other gates of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fi.timite<br/>
</span>period, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bab </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Futt11y </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bib-sn-Nay </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">62</span>). It was<br/>
erected at the end of the 11th cent. by Greek builders from Edessa.<br/>
The S. side consists of two huge towers; by that to the W. are a<br/>
number of stone and wooden balls, probably dating from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span>period. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tt1rrrL1 </span>Bey, the last of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Giroassiau </span>sultans of Egypt,<br/>
was hanged outside this gate by Sultan Selim <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, on 15th April,<br/>
1517 (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">33</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. This gate is also called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bab </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-j1fitwelli</span>, from the<br/>
old tradition that the most highly revered saint Kutb <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Mitwelli<br/>
</span>has his abode behind the western gate, where he sometimes makes<br/>
his presence known by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>gleam of light. From the inner <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span>) gate<br/>
hang bunches of hair, teeth, flowers, shreds of clothing, and other<br/>
votive <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings</span>, placed here by sick persons who hope thereby to be<br/>
cured of their diseases. Opposite the outside of the gate is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sebil<br/>
</span>of Sultan Farag, by the large grated window of which executions by<br/>
strangulation took place down to the middle of the 19th century.<br/>
<br/>
From the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zuwéleh </span>Gate the <span style="color: #0000FF;">DERB </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">EL-AIgMAR </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. E, 4) leads<br/>
towards the E. About 200 yds. from the gate is the recently restored<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*Mosque </span>of the Emir <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kismas </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e1aslpklri</span>, a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>handsome<br/>
building, erected in 1481 in the style of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kait </span>Bey. The mausoleum,<br/>
which is large in proportion to the mosque, long remained empty,<br/>
as Emir <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kismés </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Ishéki</span>, master of the horse to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kart </span>Bey, died<br/>
and was buried in Syria. In 1851, however, the pious <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shekh </span>Abu<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hariba </span>was interred <span style="color: #0000FF;">here</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>In the same street, farther on named<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">SHARl'A </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ez-TABB2Nms </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1.E,4,5</span>), lies the restored <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gami'a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Altun<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bogha </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-MerMni</span>, built by Emir <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Merdani</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tsup-bearer </span>of Sultan<br/>
Mohammed <span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Nasir</span>, and finished in 1332. The new concrete dome<br/>
in front of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prayer-niche </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>by superb ancient Egyptian<br/>
granite columns. The tasteful ornamentation of the ceiling and the<br/>
elaborate mosaic of the prayer-niche also demand attention.<br/>
