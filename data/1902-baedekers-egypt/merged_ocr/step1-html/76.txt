<span>DOCTRINES OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">EL-ISLAM</span>. m<br/>
<br/>
the promised <span style="color: #0000FF;">Paraclete</span>, the Comforter (St. John xiv<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>16), the last<br/>
and greatest of the prophets; but he does not profess to be entirely<br/>
free from minor sins. He <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfirms </span>previous revelations, but his<br/>
appearance has superseded them. His whole doctrine is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">miracle</span>,<br/>
and it therefore does not require to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfirmed </span>by special miracles.<br/>
After his death, however, a number of miracles were attributed to<br/>
him, and a position was assigned to him as the principal mediator<br/>
between God and man. The apotheosis of human beings is, moreover, an idea foreign to the Semitic mind, and it was the Persians<br/>
who first elevated'Ali and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">imams </span>(literally <span style="color: #0000FF;">reciters </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">prayers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
</span>who succeeded him to the rank of supernatural beings.<br/>
<br/>
The KORAN itself was early believed to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>of entirely supernatural origin. The name signifies'rehearsal', or'reading', and<br/>
the book is divided into chapters called <span style="color: #ff0000;">8iirehs</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>revelation<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">vouohsafed </span>to the Prophet took place in the'blessed <span style="color: #0000FF;">night</span>' in the<br/>
year 609. With many interruptions, the'sending <span style="color: #0000FF;">down</span>' of the<br/>
Koran extended over <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-three </span>years, until the whole book,<br/>
which had already existed on'well-preserved <span style="color: #0000FF;">tables</span>' in <span style="color: #0000FF;">heaven</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>was in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prophet</span>'s possession. During the time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abbaside<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">khalifs </span>it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">matter </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">keenest </span>controversy whether the Koran<br/>
was created or <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncreated</span>. (The Oriental Christians have likewise<br/>
always manifested a great taste for subtle dogmatic questions, such<br/>
as the Procession <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Holy Ghost.) The earlier, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meooan </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">St1rehs</span>,<br/>
which on account of their brevity are placed at the end of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">book</span>,<br/>
are characterised by great freshness and vigour of style. They <span style="color: #ff0000;">arein<br/>
</span>rhyme, but only partially poetic in form. In the longer <span style="color: #ff0000;">St1rehs </span>ofa<br/>
later period the style is more studied and the narrative often<br/>
tedious. The Koran is nevertheless regarded as the masterpiece of<br/>
Arabic literature. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">prayers </span>of the Muslims consist almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">exclusively </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>passages from it, although they are ignorant of its real<br/>
meaning. Even by the early commentators much of the Koran was<br/>
imperfectly understood, for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed</span>, although extremely proud<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabio </span>Book', was very partial to the use of all kinds of<br/>
foreign words<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The translation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">being </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">prohibited</span>, Persian, Turkish, and Indian children learn it entirely <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>rote.<br/>

(3). FUTURE STATE AND <span style="color: #0000FF;">PREDESTINATION</span>. The doctrine of the<br/>
resurrection has been grossly corrupted by the Koran <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">subsequent </span>tradition; but its main features have doubtless been borrowed from the Christians, as has also the appearance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Antichrist</span>,<br/>
and the part to be played by Christ at the Last Day. On that day<br/>
Christ will establish El-Islam as the religion of the world. With<br/>
