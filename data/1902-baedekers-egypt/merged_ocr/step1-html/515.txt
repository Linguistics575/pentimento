<span>240 Route 24. THEBES (E. BANK). <span style="color: #ff0000;">J. </span>Temple<br/>
<br/>
The exterior walls of the pylons are adorned with representations<br/>
referring to the campaign against the Hittites, which Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">If</span>.<br/>
carried on in Syria in the 5th year of his reign. The Beliefs <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>crew<br/>
have suffered severely from the hand of time and at several places<br/>
are almost obliterated. On the Right (W.) Tower we see the life and<br/>
business of the Egyptian camp; to the left the king on his throne<br/>
holds a council of war with his princes, in the middle is the camp,<br/>
fortified by the shields of the soldiers arranged side by side, to the<br/>
right the king in his chariot dashes into the fray. The scenes on<br/>
the Left (E) Tower plunge us into the battle; the king in his chariot<br/>
dashes against his foes who have surrounded him, and launches his<br/>
arrows against them. The field is covered with dead and wounded,<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I<br/>
</span>while the Hittites flee in wild confusion to the fortress of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kadesh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>whence fresh troops <span style="color: #0000FF;">issue</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Farther to the left Kadesh, <span style="color: #0000FF;">gin </span>with<br/>
water, appears, with the defenders on the battlements. Remote<br/>
from the battle-field, to the extreme left, the prince of the Hittites<br/>
stands in his chariot, surrounded by his guards, and'fears before<br/>
his majesty'.<br/>
<br/>
Below the reliefs on the W. tower is a long poetical description<br/>
of the battle of Kadesh, inscribed in vertical lines. This is now<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">generally.known </span>as <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wpie </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pentaur</span>'. It is continued <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the E.<br/>
tower, where, however, the text is still partly concealed by rubbish.<br/>
<br/>
On the front of each tower of the pylon are two large vertical<br/>
grooves for the reception of flag-staffs, and above them are large<br/>
square apertures, which served both to receive the braces securing<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flag-staffs </span>and to admit light and air to the interior.<br/>
<br/>
The portal between the towers is in a very ruinous condition.<br/>
The reliefs represent Ramses II. in presence of the chief deities of<br/>
the temple. The carvings, in tolerably high relief, in the doorway<br/>
date from the reign of the Ethiopian king <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shabako</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the principal pylon (though <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>accessible from this<br/>
side) lies the great Court of Ramses II. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pi</span>. A), which was entirely<br/>
surrounded by a double row of <span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus-columns </span>(74 in all), with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bud-capitals </span>and smooth shafts. It measures 185 ft. in length and<br/>
167 ft. in breadth, but owing to the presence of a mosque (p. 238),<br/>
only the W. side has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">laid </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">here</span>. In the N.W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">corner</span>, adjoining<br/>
the W. tower of the pylon, lies an ancient Chapel (Pl. Th), built<br/>
by Thutmosis <span style="color: #ff0000;">III</span>. and restored by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>. It is raised upon a<br/>
platform above the pavement of the court, and contains three<br/>
chambers, of which that in the centre <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>dedicated to Ammon,<br/>
that on the W. to Mut, and that on the E. to Khons. On the side<br/>
facing the court it had a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>of four clustered <span style="color: #ff0000;">papyruscolumns </span>in red granite.<br/>
<br/>
The Walls of the court are covered with reliefs and inscriptions,<br/>
including <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>scenes, hymns to the gods, representations of<br/>
conquered nations, <span style="color: #0000FF;">em</span>, most of which date from the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramses </span>II. Specially interesting is a relief on the S.W. wall <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. Y),<br/>
