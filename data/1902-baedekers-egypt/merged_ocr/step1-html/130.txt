<span>RELIGION. <span style="color: #0000FF;">cxix<br/>
<br/>
</span>human powers were worshipped without any reference to special<br/>
localities. Among these universally recognized deities were RE, the<br/>
sun, Horus, the sun-god, and Thout, the moon-god. Moreover, the<br/>
belief that an evil spirit dwelt in the water and revealed itself to<br/>
human eyes as a crocodile seems to have been by no means <span style="color: #0000FF;">contined </span>to special districts. But these primaeval gods were frequently<br/>
worshipped also as local deities, as the patrons of <span style="color: #0000FF;">special </span>towns and<br/>
districts, where they were supposed to have taken a more limited<br/>
section of humanity under their special protection.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the local gods there was also a considerable number of<br/>
lesser deities, daemons, and spirits, who exercised <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>over<br/>
human beings, helping or harming at particular <span style="color: #ff0000;">junet11res</span>, and<br/>
who therefore must be propitiated. Among these rank, for example,<br/>
the different goddesses of childbirth, who assisted women and could<br/>
either cut short or <span style="color: #0000FF;">protract </span>their pangs; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bes</span>, the god of the toilet, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>a few cases unusually distinguished mortals, revered after death<br/>
as saints, gradually came to be included among the gods, as, e.g.,<br/>
Imhotep of Memphis, Amenhotep, the son of Hapu, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The ancient Egyptians originally represented these deities to<br/>
themselves under very crude forms, which recall the fetishism still<br/>
prevailing among <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncivilized </span>African tribes at the present day.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ihus </span>Osiris of Tetu was believed to dwell in a post; a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sycamore</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ree </span>was believed to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>the abode of Hathor, and a nameless deity<br/>
was believed to dwell in an olive-tree. <span style="color: #0000FF;">But </span>the belief that gods chose<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">mimals </span>as their abode and revealed themselves in the form of animals was much more generally spread; <span style="color: #0000FF;">cows</span>, bulls, rams, <span style="color: #0000FF;">crocodiles</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eats</span>, lions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ichneumons</span>, frogs, certain kinds of fishes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ibises</span>,<br/>
hawks, falcons were all believed to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>thus chosen by one or other<br/>
god. The sacred animal<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>in which the god inhered, was frequently<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1istinguished </span>by special markings; it was kept in the temple,<br/>
worshipped as divine, and after its death was interred with all<br/>
honour, while its place in the temple was taken by another. The<br/>
best known example of this worship is afforded by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Apis</span>, the<br/>
sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">bull </span>of Ptah, worshipped at Memphis. The Apis was black<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>white spots; <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the forehead it bore a white triangle and on<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>right <span style="color: #0000FF;">flank </span>a crescent. Similarly a <span style="color: #ff0000;">light-eoloured </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">bull </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mnevis</span>)<br/>
was sacred to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Atum </span>of Heliopolis, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">jackal </span>to Anubis, god of the<br/>
lead, the ibis to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thout</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sparrow-hawk </span>to Horus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete</span>. At a later<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">period</span>, as the religion became less and less a living reality and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">nore </span>and more dependent upon external ceremonies, the worship<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>sacred animals was carried farther. Not only was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">individual<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">animal </span>preserved in the temple revered as holy, but all animals of<br/>
: he same kind were regarded as divine; they might not be killed<br/>
within the region sacred to them, and when they died they were<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Iolemnly </span>interred in special cemeteries. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">eat-eemeteries </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Berrihayu1</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eroeodile-graves </span>of Ombos, the ibis<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">graves </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ashmun√©n</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>, date from this late <span style="color: #0000FF;">epoch </span>of exaggerated<br/>
