presented by the great <span style="color: #ff0000;">temple-eourt</span>; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>[ hypostyle ]<br/>
hall of the temple corresponds to the broad hall of the dwelling;<br/>
and the deep and large hall in which the master of the house spent<br/>
his time <span style="color: #0000FF;">finds </span>its analogue in the sanctuary, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dwelling-plaoe </span>of<br/>
the god. And Just as these apartments in the dwelling-house were<br/>
adjoined by chambers and rooms for various purposes, so the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sanetuary </span>in the temple was adjoined by a series of small apartments,<br/>
store-rooms, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eto</span>. Thus the temple was literally what the Egyptians<br/>
called it, the House of the God.<br/>
<br/>
In many temples the <span style="color: #ff0000;">oolonnaded </span>hall is further separated from<br/>
the sanctuary by one or more Smaller Halls (with or without <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span>) of narrower proportions and diminishing in height. <span style="color: #0000FF;">li're-</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">quently </span>also the sanctuary is followed by several other halls and<br/>
chambers; and not <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfrequently </span>the great hall is preceded by two<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eolonnaded </span>courts instead of by one, while in these the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade<br/>
</span>on the rear-side is placed on a <span style="color: #0000FF;">terrace-like </span>structure above the level<br/>
of the pavement. The particular purposes of all these various rooms<br/>
are hard to determine; with the exception of the open court they<br/>
were probably all closed to the general public and accessible to the<br/>
priests alone. Only the king or his representative, the high-priest,<br/>
might enter the inner sanctuary and there'gaze upon the god'.<br/>
<br/>
Though many temples, such as the temple at Luxor and the<br/>
great temple of Ammon at Karnak, exhibit a much more <span style="color: #0000FF;">complicated </span>form than that just described, the explanation is that they<br/>
were not built <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>one uniform plan but owe their construction to<br/>
various builders. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the descriptions of the particular temples <span style="color: #ff0000;">130n-cerned </span>this matter is treated with due attention to detail.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">0eeasionally </span>the nature of the site compelled farther deviations<br/>
from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">above-desoribed </span>form. In Lower Nubia the sandstone<br/>
rocks approach so close to the bank of the Nile that the temple<br/>
must be partly or wholly constructed in the rock, the necessary<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms </span>being hewn out. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">haf-ilu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">MO</span>) the court is built<br/>
as usual, while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>hall and the sanctuary are hewn out<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the rock. The larger temple of Abu Simbel is entirely a <span style="color: #ff0000;">rockbuilding</span>, the pylon and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eolossi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">included</span>. At Abydos the <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieulty<br/>
</span>of excavating the rock was avoided by placing the part of the temple<br/>
containing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">slaughter-wt </span>and other <span style="color: #ff0000;">offiees </span>at right angles to<br/>
the main edifice, so that the whole now presents the form of a "<span style="color: #0000FF;">It<br/>

Nearly all the kings of that period resided in the Delta, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">therefore </span>markedly favoured the N. in erecting their monuments. There<br/>
the sanctuaries were built of limestone, and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">mediaeval </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>times the blocks have either found their way into lime-kilns,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or</span>, since the Delta itself yields but scanty building materials, have<br/>
been utilized for new buildings, usually leaving only the less easily<br/>
worked blocks of granite behind. It was not until the days of the<br/>
