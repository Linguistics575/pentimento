<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">clxvi </span>BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS.<br/>
<br/>
The ordinary streets of Oriental towns are very narrow, so<br/>
that no very satisfactory view is to be had of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">facades </span>and<br/>
grated balconies of the houses. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">groundfloor </span>is built of solid<br/>
masonry and its rooms are frequently vaulted. The upper stories<br/>
usually overhang and are supported, together with their balconies<br/>
or oriel-windows, by stone consoles of peculiar construction. An<br/>
agreeable and effective contrast to the broad, <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>surfaces of the<br/>
house-front is offered by the elegantly shaped <span style="color: #ff0000;">oriel-windows </span>and<br/>
by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mushrthtyeh</span>, or wooden balcony-gratings, carved to resemble<br/>
interlaced strings of beads. The deep door-recesses (like those of<br/>
the mosques) also serve to break the level uniformity of the facades.<br/>
The massive wooden doors are strengthened with iron bands or<br/>
(less frequently) studded with nails arranged in intricate interlaced patterns.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance-passage </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Dirkeli</span>) admits to the Hash or court<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. I, <span style="color: #0000FF;">d</span>), which corresponds to the atrium of Roman houses and<br/>
has no columns around it. Off this open the rooms of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salamltk</span>,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mandate</span>, Takhta <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bosh</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mak'ad</span>. At the back is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Btsh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Hartm </span>(Pl. I, 12), or door to the staircase to the upper floor, before<br/>
which hangs a brightly coloured <span style="color: #0000FF;">curtain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The staircase is usually<br/>
narrow and without ornament, though sometimes the ceiling and<br/>
string-boards are embellished with ablack and white mosaic pattern.<br/>
At the top is the vestibule of the Ktga (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">clxv</span>), the drawing-room<br/>
of the harim. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kira </span>is usually a long and narrow room with a<br/>
lofty ceiling, and, strictly speaking, consists of three connected<br/>
portions, differentiated in shape and height of ceiling. The square<br/>
central portion, known as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Durkh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span>, lies one step lower than the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">IAMns </span>on each side. These <span style="color: #0000FF;">liwans </span>are not always on the same<br/>
level; the broader one is regarded as the place of honour by the<br/>
ceremonious Orientals. The ceiling of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">durka'a</span>, always <span style="color: #ff0000;">loftier<br/>
</span>than those of the liwans, is provided with a cupola or lantern, with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured-glass </span>windows of the kind known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kamartyehs</span>. These<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">kamariyehs </span>are plaster-disks, about 11/4 in thickness, perforated,<br/>
while still soft, with patterns representing vases of flowers, houses,<br/>
geometrical figures, writing characters, etc., the openings being<br/>
afterwards filled in with coloured glass. Owing to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">abovementioned </span>difference in the height of the ceilings, two of the walls<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">durlptra </span>rest <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>supports which are based upon massive<br/>
brackets reaching far down on the main side-walls. This arrangement results in a curious kind of flat <span style="color: #0000FF;">arch</span>, against which some of<br/>
the beams of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lissrsin-eeiling </span>lean. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">durka'a </span>is paved with<br/>
coloured marbles and frequently has a fountain in the centre. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Itwins </span>are paved with ordinary stone slabs, which are concealed by<br/>
rugs or carpets. On one wall of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">durka'a </span>there is always a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Safe</span>,<br/>
a kind of stand on which are placed the dishes used in entertaining<br/>
guests. The walls of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Itwins </span>are panelled to the height of 6 or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bit</span>, and against them are placed divans, above which is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">broad<br/>
<br/>
