<br/>
as that of an owl. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">hieratie </span>writing we possess literary works of<br/>
almost every kind except dramas. - Farther abbreviations and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">amalgamations </span>of letters developed another cursive style from the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic</span>, viz. the Demotic, which was the ordinary character <span style="color: #0000FF;">fem-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ployed </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hear-Roman </span>period. The sign of the owl, for example, was curtailed to <span style="color: #ff0000;">b</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>This writing was <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiei1y </span>used for<br/>
contracts, accounts, letters, and similar documents, whence it was<br/>
sometimes termed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Epi8tolographie</span>, or'letter <span style="color: #0000FF;">character</span>', by the<br/>
Greeks<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>During the second century after <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span>magical <span style="color: #0000FF;">formulae<br/>
</span>were frequently written in Greek characters; and after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">introduction </span>of Christianity it became the universal custom to write the<br/>
Egyptian translations of the Scriptures in the simpler Greek letters<br/>
instead of in the inconvenient <span style="color: #ff0000;">hieroglyphios</span>, which were at the<br/>
same time more <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffuyult </span>to learn. But as the Greek alphabet was<br/>
not adequate to represent all the Egyptian sounds (<span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>sh, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc</span>.)<br/>
seven supplementary <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbols</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>were borrowed from the demotic.<br/>
Thus arose the Coptic Writing of the Egyptian Christians.<br/>
<br/>
The use of hieroglyphics extended beyond the borders of Egypt,<br/>
especially into Nubia, where they were employed in the temples<br/>
built by the Pharaohs. And even after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubian-Ethiopian<br/>
</span>kingdom became <span style="color: #0000FF;">independent </span>of Egypt in the 8th cent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.O.</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>still continued to be used there. <span style="color: #0000FF;">At </span>first, however,<br/>
only inscriptions in the Egyptian language were thus written; some<br/>
time elapsed before hieroglyphics were adapted to the native <span style="color: #ff0000;">lvlguage</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was allied to the modern Nubian tongue. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the<br/>
course of this adaptation various formal <span style="color: #0000FF;">modifications </span>took place,<br/>
resulting in an Ethiopian Hieroglyphic System, which has not as<br/>
yet been fully deciphered. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">post-Christian </span>era an Ethiopian<br/>
Cursive Style, apparently based on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">demotic</span>, was also developed.<br/>
This also has not yet been deciphered.<br/>
<br/>
The following hints Will <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>of service to those who may try to<br/>
decipher any of the kings' names with the aid of the lists given<br/>
above<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>consulting first the list of phonetic symbols, then that of<br/>
the verbal symbols. The Egyptian kings frequently had several<br/>
names, all of which are enclosed within the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouche</span>. The name<br/>
<br/>
proper is preceded by various titles; <span style="color: #0000FF;">eggs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ar </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">se</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rev</span>,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'son<br/>
