including the W. bank, was known also as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ato'cmhg</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'eity </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zeus'<br/>
</span>(Ammon), also called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diospolis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">h</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>megale or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diospolis </span>Mayne to distinguish it from Diospolis Parva or <span style="color: #ff0000;">H6u </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>224). <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wéset </span>was the<br/>
capital of a nome, and it was ruled by princes of its own, whose<br/>
tombs (6th Dyn.) were discovered at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Drah </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Abu'l </span>Negga. The local<br/>
deity was the hawk-headed Mont, a god of war, who was also <span style="color: #0000FF;">worshipped </span>in the neighbouring town of Hermonthis. Several other<br/>
places lay near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Waset </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the E. bank; among these were <span style="color: #ff0000;">EpetEsowet </span>(the modern <span style="color: #ff0000;">Karnak</span>) and South Opel (modern Luxor), which<br/>
were afterwards incorporated with the great'city' and subjected to<br/>
the same rulers.<br/>
<br/>
When the Theban princes assumed the royal dignity during<br/>
the Middle Empire, Thebes rose to a more commanding position.<br/>
The city was adorned with temples, amongst which the large shrines<br/>
raised in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Epet-Esowet </span>and South Opet to their local deity <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman<br/>
</span>were conspicuous. But the greatness of Thebes dates only from the<br/>
beginning of the New Empire. The liberation of the country from<br/>
the Hyksos and the reunion <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>empire was directed <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>Thebes,<br/>
and that city continued for centuries to be the favourite seat ofthe<br/>
Pharaohs, and the reservoir into which flowed the untold treasures<br/>
exacted as tribute or brought as booty from conquered nations. A<br/>
large share of this wealth was bestowed upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>. The magnificent and gigantic temple, erected at this period to the god, is<br/>
still one of the chief sights of Thebes. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">grandees </span>of the kingdom<br/>
esteemed it an honour to become priests of Ammon, the schools beside his temples flourished, and the kings offered their richest gifts<br/>
to this god, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom </span>they expected a surer <span style="color: #0000FF;">fulfilment </span>of their<br/>
petitions than from any other. The fame of the huge city early<br/>
reached the ears even of the Greeks. In a possibly interpolated passage of the Iliad <span style="color: #0000FF;">LIX</span>, 379-384), Achilles, enraged with Agamemnon, assures Ulysses that he will never more unite in council or in<br/>
deed with the great Atrides:<br/>
"Ten times as much, and twenty times were vain; the high pil'd store<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>rich Mycenae, and if he ransack wide earth for more,<br/>
<br/>
Search old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Orchomenus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>gold, and by the fertile stream<br/>

</span>The epithet <span style="color: #ff0000;">éaardpmculog</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.'hundred-gated', here used <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span>Homer, was also applied by later classical authors to Thebes. Diodorus,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>, Pliny, and Stephanus of Byzantium all make use of it, <span style="color: #0000FF;">referring </span>to the gates of the town, as symbols <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>size and power. The<br/>
