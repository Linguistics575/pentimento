<span>xxii DRAGOMANS.<br/>
<br/>
generally have the effect of dispersing the assailants. Charity should<br/>
be given only to the sick or the aged. A beggar may be silenced<br/>
with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">words'Allrih </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">yaTW </span>(may God give thee <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller should take care to be amply supplied with small<br/>
CHANGE <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>all times, and especially before taking an excursion into<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Country </span>(comp. pp. xv, 26).<br/>
<br/>
Travellers about to make a tour of any length may avoid all the<br/>
petty annoyances incident to direct dealings with the natives by<br/>
placing themselves under the care of a Dragoman (Arab. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Turgenuidj</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>is also appropriated to themselves by the ordinary<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eo1nmissionmdres </span>in Cairo, Alexandria, Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'til</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Luxor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuim</span>,<br/>
etc. Most of them speak <span style="color: #0000FF;">English</span>, French, and Italian. Charges, see<br/>
p. 28. Dragomans proper, who generally consider it beneath their<br/>
dignity to escort their employers through the streets of towns, are<br/>
usually employed for the longer tours only, such as the voyage up<br/>
the Nile (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">184</span>), the journey to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Faytlm </span>(p. 174), and a visit to<br/>
the less frequented towns in the Delta. Before engaging a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman</span>, the traveller should carefully enquire into his record at the<br/>
hotel and the consulate. For a fixed price per day the dragoman <span style="color: #0000FF;">contracts </span>to supply the necessary riding animals and boats and to defray<br/>
the entire cost of lodging and provisioning the party, including all<br/>
hotel-bills. The contract, which must be signed at the consulate,<br/>
should expressly determine all details as far as possible, including<br/>
the duration of the journey, with due provision for prolonging it if<br/>
desired<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It is usual to pay the dragoman one-half of the total stipulated sum before starting, and the remainder on the return, or onethird before starting, one-third during the journey, and the remaining third on its conclusion. Both parties to the contract should<br/>
bind themselves to submit disputes or differences to the arbitration<br/>
of the consul.<br/>
<br/>
The dragomans are inclined to assume a <span style="color: #ff0000;">patronising </span>manner<br/>
towards their employers, while they generally treat their own countrymen with an air of vast superiority. The sooner this <span style="color: #0000FF;">impertinence </span>is checked, the more satisfactory will be the traveller's subsequent relations with his guide. Above all, travellers should never<br/>
permit their dragoman <span style="color: #ff0000;">to'explain</span>' the monuments. These men are<br/>
without exception quite uneducated, without the least knowledge<br/>
of the historic or aesthetic significance of the monuments; and their<br/>
"explanations' are merely garbled versions of what they have picked<br/>
up <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>guide-books or from the remarks of previous travellers.<br/>
<br/>
On the successful termination of the journey travellers are too<br/>
apt from motives of good nature to <span style="color: #0000FF;">write </span>a more favourable <span style="color: #0000FF;">testimonial </span>for their dragoman than he really deserves; but this is truly<br/>
an act of injustice to his subsequent employers, and tends to confirm him in his faults. The testimonial therefore should not omit<br/>
to mention any serious cause for dissatisfaction.<br/>
