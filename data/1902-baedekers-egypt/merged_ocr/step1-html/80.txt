<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">DOCTRINES </span>OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">EL-ISLAM</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ixix<br/>
<br/>
</span>is for the most part rigorously observed, but prolonged repasts during the night afford some compensation. Many shops and <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflices </span>are<br/>
entirely closed during this month. As the Arabic year is lunar, and<br/>
therefore eleven days shorter than ours, the fast of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramagian </span>runs<br/>
through all the seasons in the course of thirty-three years, and its<br/>
observance is most severely felt in summer, when much suffering is<br/>
caused by thirst.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">PILGRIMAGE </span>TO MECCA, Which every Muslim is bound to<br/>
undertake once in his life, is also deserving of mention<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Most of<br/>
the pilgrims now perform the greater part of the distance by water.<br/>
On approaching Mecca the pilgrims undress, laying aside even<br/>
their headgear, and put on aprons and a piece of cloth over the<br/>
left shoulder. They then perform the circuit of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ka'ba</span>, kiss<br/>
the black stone, hear the sermon <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>Mt<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'Arafat </span>near Mecca, pelt<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Satanwith </span>stones in the valley of Mina, and conclude their pilgrimage with a great <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>feast. On the day when this takes<br/>
place at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mecca</span>, sheep are slaughtered and a festival called the Great<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Beiram </span>(el-nd <span style="color: #ff0000;">et-kebir</span>) observed throughout the whole of the Mohammedan countries. (The'Lesser <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beiram</span>', Arab. <span style="color: #0000FF;">et-nd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ey-.sughaiyar</span>,<br/>
follows Ramadan.) The month of the pilgrimage is called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dhilhiggeh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">that'of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>pilgrimage<span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>and forms the close of the Muslim<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">year.t </span>The conduct of the caravan, with the gifts presented to the<br/>
town of Mecca, the escort, and other items, costs the Egyptian government more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">50,0005. </span>annually. For an account of the feast in<br/>
connection with the pilgrimage, see <span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1xxvii</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the Arabic LITERATURE is connected with the Koran.<br/>
Commentaries were written at an early period to explain the obscure passages in it, and there gradually sprang up a series of <span style="color: #ff0000;">exegetieal </span>writings dwelling with elaborate <span style="color: #0000FF;">minuteness </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>every<br/>
possible shade of interpretation. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Grammar</span>, too, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>studied<br/>
solely in connection with the Koran, and a prodigious mass of<br/>
legal literature was founded exclusively upon the sacred volume<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">13w</span>). Of late years, however, some attempts have been made<br/>
<br/>
, <span style="color: #0000FF;">MOHAMMEDAN </span>CALENDAR. The Mohammedan era begins with July 16th<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">lat </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mnharreml </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0f </span>the year 622 A. D., being the day of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moliammed</span>'s flight<br/>
(Hegira) from Mecca to Medina (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lxii</span>). The Mohammedan year is purely<br/>
lunar and has no reference or relation to the sun; it contains 354 days,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>355 in leap-years, eleven of which occur in each cycle of 30 years.<br/>
There <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span>months, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>third, etc., <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>have 29 days each, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">second</span>, fourth, etc., 30 days; these are named <span style="color: #ff0000;">ilfoltarrem</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rubi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elauwel</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rabi'el-dkhir</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gemdd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-auwel</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gemdd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-dkhir</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Regreb</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shaman</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rama'da</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shauwcil</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">DhiHctdeh</span>, DMZ- { <span style="color: #ff0000;">liageln<br/>

</span>In order approximately to <span style="color: #0000FF;">convert </span>a year of <span style="color: #0000FF;">our </span>era into one of the<br/>
Muslim era, subtract 622, divide the remainder by 33, and add the quotient<br/>
to the dividend. Conversely, a year of the Mohammedan <span style="color: #0000FF;">era </span>is converted<br/>
into <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>of the Christian <span style="color: #0000FF;">era </span>by dividing it by 33. subtracting the quotient<br/>
from it, and adding 622 to the remainder. On 20th April, 1901, began the<br/>
Muslim year 1319.<br/>
<br/>
The Gregorian calendar <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>introduced into Egypt in 1875, but is<br/>
observed by government in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance </span>department only.<br/>
