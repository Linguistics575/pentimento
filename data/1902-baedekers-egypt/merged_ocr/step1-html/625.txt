<br/>
HISTORY. The district round the modern <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assutin</span>, including the island<br/>
of Elephantine, bore in antiquity the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ébu</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'Elephant </span>Land',<br/>
probably because the Egyptians here <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>saw the African elephant. At<br/>
a later date that <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>was restricted to the island and town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine</span>. From antiquity down to the present day <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine </span>has marked<br/>
the limit of Egypt proper in the direction of Nubia. From the erection<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pyramids </span>to the Roman period the ancient Egyptians found material<br/>
for their great temples and statues in the quarries <span style="color: #ff0000;">otyEbuttiyeneh </span>which<br/>
yielded <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured </span>granite, containing a large proportion of translucent<br/>
quartz and of yellow, brownish, pink, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>black <span style="color: #0000FF;">mica</span>. Curiously enough,<br/>
however, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">term'syenite</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Was </span>used by Pliny, is now applied<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">geologists </span>to a different variety of stone, containing a much larger proportion <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofhornblende</span>. Strategically<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yébu </span>commanded the Nile cataracts<br/>
and the channels that fostered <span style="color: #ff0000;">communicatiun </span>by water between Egypt<br/>
and Nubia. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>was also the starting-point <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the great caravan-routes<br/>
leading to Nubia and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sudan</span>, along which passed the earliest commercial and military expeditions of the Egyptians, and it thus became<br/>
an important <span style="color: #0000FF;">depOt </span>for the trade with the interior of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Africa </span>The ancient<br/>
capital of the province was also named <span style="color: #0000FF;">YEbu </span>and lay on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>side of the<br/>
island (p. 331).<br/>
<br/>
Another town, named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Swinet</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyena </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greeks</span>, was situated on<br/>
the E. bank of the Nile, but appears not to have attained any great importance until a late <span style="color: #ff0000;">Deriud</span>. Large mounds of rubbish near the railwaystation still indicate the former size of this town. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Juvenal</span>, the Latin satiric<br/>
poet, was appointed prefect of the garrison at Syene, or, in other words,<br/>
was banished to the most remote <span style="color: #0000FF;">frontier </span>of the empire, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">punishment<br/>
</span>for his biting attacks <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the court. A <span style="color: #ff0000;">famuus </span>curiosity of ancient Syene<br/>
was a well, into which the sun's rays descended perpendicularly, casting<br/>
no <span style="color: #0000FF;">shadow</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>at midday during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">summer-solstice</span>, thus proving that<br/>
Syene was situated under the tropic (which, however, has now shifted<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">somewhat </span>to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. The report <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>its existence led the learned Athenian<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Eratosthenes </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">2</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">6-19d </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">B.U</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>), attached to the Museum at Alexandria, to the<br/>
discovery of the method of measuring the size of the earth that <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>still<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">employed </span>The place <span style="color: #ff0000;">guifered </span>greatly at the hands of the Blemmyes (p. 352),<br/>
but became the seat of a Christian bishop, and appears to have rapidly regained its prosperity under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khalit</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span>. Arab <span style="color: #0000FF;">authors </span>record that nu fewer<br/>
than 20,000 inhabitants died of the plague at one time, a fact that points<br/>
to a very large total population. After the close of the 12th cent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuiin<br/>
</span>suffered severely from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">incursiOns </span>of plundering Arab tribes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally<br/>
</span>put a stop to by a Turkish garrison stationed here by the sultan Selim,<br/>
after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">conquest </span>of Egypt in 1517.<br/>
<br/>
The broad and clean street skirting the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river </span>presents an almost<br/>
European appearance, with its whitewashed houses. To the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>of<br/>
the landing-place'a <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruined </span>building, for which stones of earlier<br/>
buildings have been used, projects into the river. This, known to<br/>
the Arabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">es </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Idl-yarnrnc</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ttn </span>(the bath), probably dates from the<br/>
Roman period and seems to have been a lock or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">tite-de-Pont</span>.<br/>
Near it rises the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuim </span>Hotel; farther down are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">governmentbuildings</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Café </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédivial</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cook</span>'s bureau, and the Post <span style="color: #0000FF;">Office</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>and upstream are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Commissariat </span>Store, the Cataract Hotel, and<br/>
the palm-shaded railway-station (p. 327). Farther to the S. are<br/>
the ruins of a building (probably a convent) on a hill and Fort<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tagug</span>. On the island of Elephantine the Savoy Hotel is <span style="color: #ff0000;">conspiruous</span>. Across the river appears the hill with the roek-tombs and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kubhet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-hawa </span>(p. 334) on the highest point. The Nile, with its<br/>
