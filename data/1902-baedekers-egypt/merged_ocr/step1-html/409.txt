nearly the same, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lepére </span>estimated that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span>Sea to be nearly<br/>
33 ft. higher than that of the Mediterranean.<br/>
<br/>
In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1836 </span>Ferdinand de Lesseps (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1805-94</span>) came to Cairo as a<br/>
young consular <span style="color: #ff0000;">éléve</span>, and there had his attention called to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lepbre's<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mémoire </span>regarding the scheme of connecting the two seas, which<br/>
led him to consider its great importance, although <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lepére </span>himself<br/>
doubted its feasibility. In 1838 he made the acquaintance of Lieut.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Waghorn</span>, an Englishman (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">173 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, whose zealous advocacy of the<br/>
construction of a route between Europe and India via Egypt stimulated his zeal for a similar project. In 1841 and 1847 Linant<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bey</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">vieeroy</span>'s engineer of water-works, and Messrs. Stephenson,<br/>
Negrelli, and Bourdaloue, demonstrated the inaccuracy of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lep'ere's<br/>
</span>calculations, and proved that the level of the two seas was nearly<br/>
the same, so that the construction of a canal between them was<br/>
possible. In 1854 M. de Lesseps, having matured his plan, laid it<br/>
before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sail </span>Pasha, who was then <span style="color: #0000FF;">Viceroy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and who determined to<br/>
carry it out. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diffieulties </span>were thrown in the way of the enterprise<br/>
by the English government during Lord Palmerston's ministry,<br/>
but on 5th Jan., 1856, permission to begin the work was formally<br/>
granted by the Viceroy. A considerable time, however, elapsed before the necessary capital was raised, and it was not till <span style="color: #ff0000;">22nd </span>April,<br/>
1859, that the work was actually begun. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Viceroy </span>undertook to<br/>
pay many of the current expenses, and provided 25,000 workmen,<br/>
who were to be paid and fed by the company at an inexpensive rate,<br/>
and were to be relieved every three months. In order to provide<br/>
these workmen with water, 4000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-casks </span>suitable for being<br/>
carried by camels had to be constructed, and 1600 of these animals<br/>
were daily employed in bringing them supplies, at a cost of 8000 fr,<br/>
per day. On 29th Dee., 1863, the fresh-water canal <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>162) was<br/>
completed, so that the company was thenceforth relieved of the<br/>
enormous expense of supplying the workpeople with water. The<br/>
hands now employed, among whom were a number of Europeans,<br/>
were less numerous, and much of the work was done by machinery,<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">22,000 </span>horse-power in all.<br/>
<br/>
011 18th March, 1869, the water of the Mediterranean was at<br/>
length allowed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">flow </span>into the nearly dry, <span style="color: #0000FF;">salt-encrusted </span>basins of<br/>
the Bitter Lakes, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>parts of <span style="color: #ff0000;">whichlay </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">26-310 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>below the<br/>
level of the Mediterranean, while the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s. </span>parts required extensive<br/>
dredging operations. The opening of the Suez Canal was inaugurated<br/>
on <span style="color: #ff0000;">16th </span>Nov., 1869, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnifieent </span>festivities which took place<br/>
on the occasion are said to have cost the Khedive no less than<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">4,200,000l</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The cost of constructing the canal amounted to about 19 million<br/>
pounds sterling, of which 12,800,000 was paid by the shareholders,<br/>
while the rest of the sum was almost entirely contributed by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive</span>. In 1875, however, the British Government acquired<br/>
177,000 of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive</span>'s shares for a sum <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">4,000,0001</span>. The Suez<br/>
