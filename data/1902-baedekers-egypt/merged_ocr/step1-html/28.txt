<br/>
cost, forgetting that the seeds of insatiable <span style="color: #0000FF;">cupidity </span>are thereby sown,<br/>
to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">infinite </span>annoyance of their successors and the demoralisation<br/>
of the recipients themselves. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bakshish </span>should never be given except<br/>
for services rendered, and every attempt at extortion should be firmly<br/>
resisted, as compliance only makes the applicants for <span style="color: #ff0000;">bakshtsh<br/>
</span>doubly <span style="color: #0000FF;">clamorous</span>. Payment should never be made until the service<br/>
stipulated for has been rendered, after which an absolutely <span style="color: #0000FF;">deaf </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ear<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">should </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>turned to the protestations and entreaties which almost<br/>
invariably follow. Thanks, it need hardly be said, must never be expected from such recipients. Even <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>an express bargain has<br/>
been made, and more than the stipulated sum paid, they are almost<br/>
sure to pester the traveller in the way indicated. When no bargain<br/>
has been made, the fees and prices mentioned in the Handbook,<br/>
all of which are ample, should be paid without remark; and if<br/>
the attacks which ensue are not silenced by an air of calm <span style="color: #0000FF;">indiference </span>the traveller may use the word <span style="color: #0000FF;">rat</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">imshi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>in<br/>
a quiet but decided and imperative tone. At the same time it<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>be admitted that the increasing number of visitors to Egypt<br/>
tends to raise prices during the chief travelling season, so that a<br/>
larger bakshish than is mentioned in the Handbook may sometimes<br/>
be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
While much caution and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ftrrnnegs </span>are desirable in dealing with<br/>
the people, it need hardly be added that the traveller should avoid<br/>
being too exacting <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>suspicious. He should bear in mind that<br/>
many of the natives with <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom </span>he comes in contact are <span style="color: #0000FF;">mere<br/>
</span>children, whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">waywardness </span>should excite compassion rather than<br/>
anger, and who often display a touching simplicity and kindliness<br/>
of disposition. The native communities hold together with remarkable faithfulness, and the bond of a common religion, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>takes<br/>
the place of'party' in other countries, and requires its adherents<br/>
to address each other <span style="color: #0000FF;">as'yd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">akhilya</span>' (my brother), is far more than<br/>
a mere name. On the other hand, intimate acquaintance with Orientals is to be avoided, disinterested friendship being still rarer in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">East </span>than elsewhere. The traveller, however, should on his side<br/>
do his utmost to sustain the <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-established </span>reputation of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'kitmeh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fremityeh</span>', the'word of a Frank', in which Orientals are<br/>
wont to place implicit <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfidenee</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Notwithstanding all the suggestions we have ventured to offer,<br/>
the traveller will to some extent have to buy his experience. In<br/>
most cases the overcharges to which he will be exposed will be<br/>
comparatively trifling; but if extortion is attempted on a larger<br/>
scale, he had better refer the matter to his consul.<br/>
<br/>
BEGGARS are exceedingly numerous in Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">country-districts</span>. In every village ragged children pursue the traveller with their ceaseless cry <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'bakshish</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">baksWh</span>, yd <span style="color: #ff0000;">khawageh'<br/>
