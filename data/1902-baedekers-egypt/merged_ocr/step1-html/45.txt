<span>xxxiv THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Origin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>is maintained only by means <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reinforcements </span>from abroad. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Another<br/>
</span>proof of the transforming <span style="color: #ff0000;">influemses </span>of the Egyptian climate <span style="color: #0000FF;">IS<br/>
</span>afforded by the uniform character of the domestic animals. The<br/>
oxen, in particular (which, however, are gradually being replaced<br/>
by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">buffalo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, though they have <span style="color: #0000FF;">often </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>repeatedly <span style="color: #ff0000;">extermillated<br/>
</span>in a single century by <span style="color: #0000FF;">murrain</span>, and have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded </span>by foreign<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">race</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>from every quarter of the globe, invariably after a few generations assume the well-known Egyptian type with which the representations on the ancient temples render us so familiar.<br/>
<br/>
There have been many hypotheses as to the origin of the Egyptians. In all probability the rise and development of that people<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">followed </span>essentially the same course as those of other great races,<br/>
whose geographical positions exposed them to a similar variety of<br/>
external <span style="color: #ff0000;">ir1fluenees</span>. In the course of its history this people attained<br/>
a characteristic development of its own; but we have to enquire as<br/>
to the nature of the original prehistoric stock. In classical antiquity<br/>
the Egyptians were considered to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">African </span>origin, and Diodorus<br/>
has given expression to this view by quoting a tradition of the<br/>
Ethiopians, according to which the Egyptians were originally an<br/>
Ethiopian colony, <span style="color: #0000FF;">just </span>as their country itself is <span style="color: #ff0000;">aproduct </span>of the<br/>
Nile. But the Greeks and Romans knew little of Central Africa,<br/>
and, more <span style="color: #0000FF;">eSpecially</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>they were acquainted with none of the peoples<br/>
of the Nile district except those whom we now distinguish as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hamitie</span>. When these peoples began to <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>their way from Asia across<br/>
the Red Sea into Africa, they no doubt pushed down the Nile, after<br/>
subduing the primeval inhabitants of the river-valley. The Ethiopian tradition thus agrees with the Biblical, which describes Ham<br/>
as the father of Mizraim and Cush - names under which the ancient<br/>
Hebrews used to personify Egypt and Ethiopia. But since the days<br/>
of Lepsius (1810-84) the term Hamites or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamitic </span>races has been<br/>
used to distinguish that great ethnographic group of peoples which<br/>
has, in the course of ages, altered the population of half Africa,<br/>
ever pressing from E. to W., in a course as determined as that of<br/>
the heavenly bodies, and driving out the primeval population before<br/>
them. The final stages of this migration, which, like those of the<br/>
horse and <span style="color: #0000FF;">camel</span>, falls partly within the historic period, were reached<br/>
when the Hamites <span style="color: #ff0000;">came </span>in contact with the Semitic races.<br/>
<br/>
The civilization and culture of the Egyptians have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">successively </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">affected </span>by every race that has played a prominent part<br/>
in W. Asia, from the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Babylonians </span>to the modern Arabs and<br/>
Turks. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maspero </span>argues for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>gradual infiltration from Libya also<br/>
in the earlier epochs. But the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Libyans </span>were themselves Hamitic,<br/>
no less than the Ethiopians who <span style="color: #ff0000;">overtook </span>them in their advance<br/>
westwards. Recent philologists [ such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Reinisch</span>) classify the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamites </span>from their linguistic characteristics as the prototype of the<br/>
Semitic family, distinguished by more elementary, more <span style="color: #0000FF;">primitive<br/>
</span>forms. It is universally assumed that both Hamites <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Semites<br/>
<br/>
