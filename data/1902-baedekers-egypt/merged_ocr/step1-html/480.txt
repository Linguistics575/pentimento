<span>ABYDOS. 20. Route. 219<br/>
<br/>
almost completely excavated in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1859 </span>by Mariette, at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">expense<br/>
</span>of the Viceroy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Said</span>. The walls consist of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine-grained </span>limestone,<br/>
while a harder variety has been selected for the columns, architraves, door-posts, and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">burden-bearing </span>portions. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Reliefs</span>,<br/>
dating from the reign of Sethos <span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, are among the finest productions<br/>
of Egyptian sculpture of any age.<br/>
<br/>
The ground-plan differs materially from that of other great Egyptian<br/>
temples. Instead of one sanctuary, it has seven, dedicated <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>Osiris, Isis,<br/>
Horus, Ptah, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Harmaehis</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deified </span>king; and as each of<br/>
these had a special cult, the entire front portion of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple </span>is divided<br/>
into seven parts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>its separate gateway and portals. The chambers<br/>
behind the sanctuaries are not arranged behind each other <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>in other<br/>
temples, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>side by side. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Another </span>remarkable peculiarity consists in the<br/>
Wing<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>containing various halls, chambers, etc., which stands at right<br/>
angles with the main building (p. 222).<br/>
<br/>
We enter the temple from the N.E. The first pylon is in ruins<br/>
and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>court is <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupied </span>by modern huts. The Second Court,<br/>
which opens to the S. on the temple proper, is in better preservation.<br/>
The sons and daughters of Ramses II. were represented on the wall<br/>
on the inner side of the pylon, but the figures and inscriptions have<br/>
been almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">effaced</span>. On the right and left walls appears <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II.</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">saerifieing </span>to different gods; on each side are steles of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>.<br/>
At the back of the court a shallow flight of steps ascends to the<br/>
original vestibule of the temple proper, which is supported by <span style="color: #ff0000;">12<br/>
</span>columns of limestone and originally had seven doors in its rear-wall.<br/>
0n the wall, to the left of the main entrance, is a Large Inscription<br/>
in 95 vertical lines, in which Ramses II. describes in florid language<br/>
the completion of the temple and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">filial </span>piety towards Sethos.<br/>
In the adjoining relief Ramses is shown presenting an image of the<br/>
goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meat </span>to a triad consisting of Osiris, Isis, and his father<br/>
Sethos <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, who takes the place of Horus. On the wall are other representations of Ramses in presence of the gods. - The seven original doors <span style="color: #0000FF;">corresponded </span>to the seven sanctuaries of the temple.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Processions </span>in honour of the king seem to have entered by the door<br/>
to the extreme left; the next served for processions to Ptah, the third<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>, the fourth for Ammon, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifth </span>for Osiris, the.sixth<br/>
for Isis, and the seventh for Horus. Ramses, however, walled up<br/>
six of these doors, leaving the central one alone as the main entrance<br/>
to the temple.<br/>
<br/>
The present entrance is by the door to the right of the ancient<br/>
main entrance. We <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>enter the First Hypostyle Hall, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is<br/>
about 54 yds. wide by 12 deep. The roof, part of which has fallen <span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>is<br/>
supported by <span style="color: #0000FF;">24 </span>columns, with capitals <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the form <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus </span>buds.<br/>
The columns are so arranged that two pairs stand on <span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span>side of<br/>
the five central <span style="color: #0000FF;">processional </span>aisles, while the two outermost aisles<br/>
are each <span style="color: #0000FF;">flanked </span>on one side by the walls of the temple. The representations on the shafts of the columns represent the king before<br/>
the deity to whom the aisle led, sometimes accompanied by other<br/>
deities. Thus in the Ammon aisle we see Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>before Ammon,<br/>
<br/>
