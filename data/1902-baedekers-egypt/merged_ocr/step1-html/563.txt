<span>278 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">24</span>. THEBES (<span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>BANK). 5<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Temple of<br/>
<br/>
5. From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Blbkn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e1-Nuldk </span>to Dér <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-bahri </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Asasif</span>.<br/>
<br/>
To return <span style="color: #0000FF;">frnm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Biban </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Muli'zk </span>to the plain we should take the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mountain-path </span>viii <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dér </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bahri</span>. It is possible to ride to the top of the hill,<br/>
but better to go <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>foot all the way. Riding down the hill is by no<br/>
means to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>recommended. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-boys </span>usually lead the animals by<br/>
a narrow path over the ridge, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">await </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">travellers </span>at the foot. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">afternoon </span>is the best time to visit the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">BET </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-haliri</span>, for during<br/>
the hotter hours of the day the oppressive rays of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun </span>are <span style="color: #ff0000;">refleeied<br/>
</span>from the rocks here with peculiar intensity.<br/>
<br/>
The path begins at Tomb 16, ascends the hill separating <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biban<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-1n1tsk </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Der </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-bal.1ri </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">EI-Assassin </span>and descends in zigzags.<br/>
It is fatiguing but safe, and is easily accomplished <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3/4 </span>hr. The<br/>
* View is most remarkable: first into the desolate valley of the Tombs<br/>
of the Kings, then from the summit and as we descend into <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiar<br/>
</span>ravine of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Der </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-balpi</span>; we see the steep projecting mountain-side<br/>
with its tombs, and buildings old and new, with the rich green of<br/>
the fertile plain below spread out <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>both sides of the Nile, and<br/>
here and there its groups of palms and gigantic temples, as far as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kernel</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span>Luxor <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the E. bank. The situation of the temple of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dér </span>el-bahri is remarkably fine; on the W. and N. it is framed by<br/>
precipitous rocks of a light-brown and golden colour, against which<br/>
the dazzling white walls of the temple stand out in magnificent <span style="color: #0000FF;">relief</span>. - Below the temple lies the house of the Egypt Exploration<br/>
Fund, where the keeper of the ruins lives. Opposite is the Chalet<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hatam</span>, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">luncheon-room </span>open only to cook's patrons.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Temple </span>of Dér el-bahri, named by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptians'Zoeersoeru</span>', or Wost splendid of <span style="color: #0000FF;">all</span>', was built and adorned with reliefs<br/>
and inscriptions, at the beginning of the New <span style="color: #0000FF;">Empire</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>by Queen<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Makere </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatshepsowet</span>, the sister, wife, and co-regent of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The construction of the temple shared the chequered fortunes of its foundress (p. lxxxii). When <span style="color: #0000FF;">Makere </span>was expelled from<br/>
the throne by her brother and husband after a <span style="color: #ff0000;">briefreign</span>, the building operations came to a halt, and Thutmosis caused the names and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of his sister to be obliterated in all the finished sculptures<br/>
and inscriptions at Dér <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-balm</span>' as well as elsewhere throughout the<br/>
country. Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, who succeeded his brother, continued the<br/>
work of destruction by inserting his own name in place of that of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Makere</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>When Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>died, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Makers </span>once more regained the throne, and the building was resumed. Operations were not<br/>
carried on with any remarkable activity, for when the queen's long<br/>
reign came to an end, the temple was still unfinished. Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, once more on the throne<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>so far from supplying what<br/>
was still wanting, resumed his former tactics, destroying all allusions<br/>
to his sister and sometimes inserting his own name and figure in<br/>
place of hers.<br/>
<br/>
The splendid temple was thus never finished. Amenophis IV.<br/>
carefully destroyed all reference to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, and the inscriptions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
