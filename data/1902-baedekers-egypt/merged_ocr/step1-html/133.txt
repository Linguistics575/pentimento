temple at Heliopolis, and there too the goddess <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sefkhet-ebui </span>inscribed the years of the coming reign on the leaves of the sacred<br/>
tree. The exalted position thus accorded to the sun-god naturally<br/>
gave a wide currency to the doctrines taught by the priests of Heliopolis concerning him. The local <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-gods </span>were promptly identified<br/>
with Re and were <span style="color: #0000FF;">thenceforth </span>regarded as special forms of the<br/>
national deity. The same thing happened even with other gods<br/>
who were not sun-gods at all, such as the water-god <span style="color: #ff0000;">Styblt </span>and the<br/>
harvest-god Amman, and they were invested with the symbol of RE,<br/>
viz. the sun-disk with the poisonous royal serpent (<span style="color: #0000FF;">uraeus</span>) coiled<br/>
round it. This amalgamation of local deities with Re, which began<br/>
under the Middle Empire and was carried to great lengths under<br/>
the New Empire, was a fertile source of confusion in the Egyptian<br/>
religion. Attempts indeed were made to draw a distinction among<br/>
the various forms <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofRé</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khepré </span>for example being regarded as the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">morning-sun </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Atum </span>as the evening-sun, but nothing like a<br/>
systematic scheme was ever achieved.<br/>
<br/>
In the same way a number of female local deities were converted into goddesses of the sky, in so far as they were not so already. Thus the goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>of Dendera, who revealed herself<br/>
as a cow, was considered to stand over the earth in the shape of<br/>
that animal, supporting the sun-god on her back. - This tendency<br/>
to amalgamate different deities, especially when they had similar<br/>
characteristics, prevailed in other cases from a comparatively early<br/>
period. Thus Hathor <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>identified with Isis, Ammon <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes<br/>
</span>with Min of <span style="color: #ff0000;">KoPtos</span>, Bastet with Sekhmet and Pakhet, Sekhmet<br/>
with Mut, etc. That this added to the confusion is obvious.<br/>
<br/>
When after the 12th Dyn. the centre of the empire was carried<br/>
farther to the S. and Thebes became the capital in place of Memphis, the importance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, the local god of Thebes, steadily<br/>
increased. At the beginning of the New Empire he was the head<br/>
of the Egyptian pantheon. The great campaigns against Nubia and<br/>
Asia were waged in his name by the Theban kings, temples were<br/>
erected to him in the conquered lands, and the lion's share of the<br/>
spoil fell to his shrines in Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>to the temple at<br/>
Thebes. Ammon, in short, became the national god, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">BI1eeeyyful </span>rival of his predecessor <span style="color: #ff0000;">BE-Harrnaellis</span>. It was not to be expected that the priests of Heliopolis should tamely submit to this<br/>
weakening of their <span style="color: #ff0000;">influenee</span>. They therefore eagerly seized the<br/>
first opportunity of overthrowing <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>and of restoring the sun<br/>
god to his former <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>dignity. When Amenophis IV. succeeded<br/>
to the throne, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god </span>of Heliopolis <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Harmaohis</span>) regained the<br/>
position of supreme deity, and shortly afterwards the sun itself<br/>
(Egypt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aton </span>] was announced as the one and only god. This revolution was doubtless to some extent prompted by the king's<br/>
desire to put a stop to the prevailing religious confusion at a blow,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>make practice square with theory, for theoretically all the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
