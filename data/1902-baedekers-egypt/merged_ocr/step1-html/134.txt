<span>RELIGION. <span style="color: #ff0000;">cxxiii<br/>
<br/>
</span>numerous deities had long been explained <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>in reality one with<br/>
the great sun-god (comp. p. 203). The representations and names<br/>
of Ammon and his fellow-gods were everywhere obliterated. But<br/>
after the death of Amenophis the <span style="color: #ff0000;">partizans </span>of Ammon speedily<br/>
regained the upper hand; the new religion was abolished, and the<br/>
earlier creed restored. The Egyptian religion remained in its former<br/>
confusion; the process of amalgamating different gods became more<br/>
and more common; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">religious </span>belief gradually lost all living<br/>
reality. Men clung anxiously to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>ancient traditions, and the<br/>
superstitious belief in amulets and magic as the only protection<br/>
against harmful <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>gained <span style="color: #0000FF;">universal </span>sway. But no fresh<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">religious </span>conceptions are to be found in the innumerable texts inscribed upon the temples, tombs, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>later period.<br/>
A few Egyptian deities, however, such as Isis, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Harpoerates</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapis </span>(who was introduced into Egypt under the Ptolemies),<br/>
retained <span style="color: #ff0000;">sr1ffieient </span>influence to find their way into the Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">pantheon</span>, and to gather round them a considerable crowd of worshippers in the Roman empire. The old religion of Egypt was gradually<br/>
vanquished only by the power of Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
The Future Life. A considerable diversity of doctrine as to the<br/>
fate of man after death prevailed amongst the Egyptians. Different<br/>
localities held different views as to the future state and the life<br/>
there led, and these various views were never reduced to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>single<br/>
authoritative creed. The only point that was common to the whole<br/>
people was the firm conviction that the life of man did not end at<br/>
death, but that on the contrary men continued to live just as they<br/>
had lived upon earth, provided that the necessaries of existence<br/>
were assured to them. It thus seemed <span style="color: #0000FF;">specially </span>necessary that the<br/>
body should be carefully interred and protected from decay. The<br/>
next step was to build a house for the deceased, after the pattern<br/>
of his earthly abode, in which he might dwell, and which, according<br/>
to the popular belief, he could quit at pleasure during the day.<br/>
Statues, erected in a special room for the purpose, represented the<br/>
owner of the house, his family, and his domestics. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saerifieial </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">offerings </span>provided the deceased with food, and pious endowments<br/>
ensured him against hunger and thirst even in the distant future.<br/>
Nor was this all; representations of food, <span style="color: #0000FF;">utensils</span>, etc. were painted<br/>
or carved <span style="color: #ff0000;">11p011 </span>the walls of the tomb or the sides of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus</span>,<br/>
and it was believed that through magic these representations could<br/>
serve the deceased in place of the real things<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Ornaments, clothing, etc., also were placed in the tomb or depicted on the walls for<br/>
the same purpose. The occupations that engrossed the deceased<br/>
while on earth, the pleasures that he delighted in, the dignities<br/>
that he enjoyed, awaited him beyond the tomb, and these too were<br/>
represented on the walls in order that he might really possess them.<br/>
To this belief we owe <span style="color: #0000FF;">those </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulchral </span>paintings that give us so <span style="color: #0000FF;">exact<br/>
