<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">JO</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Colossiofmrnnon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>THEBES (W.BANK). 24.Route. 305<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span>. angle of the great girdle-wall, near the <span style="color: #0000FF;">small </span>temple, lies<br/>
the Sacred Lake, a basin ahout <span style="color: #0000FF;">60ft </span>square, with two <span style="color: #0000FF;">flights </span>of steps. <span style="color: #0000FF;">About </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>yds. to the N.W. of it is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nilometer</span>. A doorway, bearing the<br/>
name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektanebos</span>, admits to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>chamber beyond which is a corridor,<br/>
whence the <span style="color: #0000FF;">staircase </span>of the Nilometer descends to a depth of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>ft.<br/>
<br/>
About 200 paces to the S. of the pavilion of Ramses III. (p. 297) is<br/>
a small <span style="color: #ff0000;">ar1fsnished </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemaiu </span>Temple, now known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kasr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et-UiNa</span>, erected<br/>
by Euergetes II. to the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thout</span>. It consists of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>wide vestibule and three<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms</span>, one behind another. On the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance-wall </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>room<br/>
we see the king <span style="color: #ff0000;">saeriheing </span>to Thout, Imhotep, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">deitled </span>sage <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenhotep</span>; the lower row of reliefs alone is <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished</span>, the others are merely<br/>
sketched out. - Still farther to the S. stood a small Temple of the Roman<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Period</span>, dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">leis</span>. It was erected by Hadrian <span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Antoninus </span>Pius,<br/>
while the ruined pylon bears the names of Vespasian, Domitian, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Otho</span>,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span>of exceedingly rare occurrence owing to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">emperor</span>'s short reign<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">69 </span>A.D.). The temple consists of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">cella </span>surrounded by apartments. A<br/>
staircase leads to the roof from a room to the extreme left of the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Between these two small temples traces of a town may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>made out.<br/>
These include remains of a Palace of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>111., which in structure<br/>
and embellishments resembled that of Amenophis IV. at Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">elJAmame<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>204). The site, completely <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruined </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>plundered, is known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Malyala</span>.<br/>
<br/>
10. The Colossi of Memnon.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Colossi </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mormon</span>, about 1/2 M. to the N.E. of Medinet Hahn and about the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">distance </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the S.W. of the Ramesseum, are visible from a great distance on all sides. These two<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statues have suffered severely from the hand of time and<br/>
have lost their artistic value, but they still exert all their old<br/>
attraction in virtue of the innumerable associations that cling to<br/>
them. They are surpassed in size and in beauty of material only<br/>
by the shattered colossus in the Ramesseum. The two immense<br/>
figures and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cubical </span>thrones on which they are seated are carved<br/>
out of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pebbly </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">quartzose </span>sandstone-conglomerate, of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">yellowish-brown </span>colour and very <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to work. Both represent<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">AmenoPhis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">m. </span>and they originally stood in front of a temple erected<br/>
by that monarch, of which only the <span style="color: #ff0000;">seantiest </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">relies </span>are now left. In<br/>
the Roman imperial epoch they were taken for statues of Memnon,<br/>
son of Eos and Tithonus, who slew <span style="color: #0000FF;">Antilochus</span>, the brave son of<br/>
Nestor, during the Trojan war, for which he was himself slain by<br/>
Achilles.<br/>
<br/>
The S. Colossus is in better preservation than the N. one, bat<br/>
there is <span style="color: #ff0000;">little </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">differenee </span>between them in point of size. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">dimensions </span>of the former, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the original form is more easily seen,<br/>
are as follows: height of the figure, 52 ft., height of the pedestal on<br/>
which the feet rest, 13 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span>, height of the entire monument, 65 ft.<br/>
But when the figure was adorned with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">long-sinee </span>vanished<br/>
.crown, the original height may have reached 69 ft. The legs from<br/>
the sole to the knee measure 191/2 ft., and each foot is 101/2 ft,<br/>
long. The breadth of the shoulders is <span style="color: #0000FF;">193/4 </span>ft.; the middle finger<br/>
on one hand is 41/2 ft. long; and the arm from the tip of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">finger </span>to the elbow measures 151/2 ft.<br/>
