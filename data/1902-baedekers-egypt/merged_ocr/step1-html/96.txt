<span style="color: #0000FF;">TanutamOn</span>, son of Shabako, <span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded </span>in recovering Egypt<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>brief period, but was finally defeated by the Assyrians and driven back into Upper Egypt. The Assyrian<br/>
rule in Egypt was, however, approaching its end.<br/>
<br/>
The absence of the main Assyrian forces, which were<br/>
engaged in distant wars in Babylon and Elam, afforded<br/>
an opportunity of shaking off the yoke, which was seized<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Peammetikh </span>of Sars, son of <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ekho </span>(see p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lxxxiv</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, with<br/>
the help of Gyges, King of Lydia. The foreign garrisons<br/>
were expelled; the authority of the small native princes<br/>
was gradually curbed; and Egypt was again united. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tanutamon </span>was forced to retire to Ethiopia, which from that<br/>
period onwards ceased to belong to Egypt and made <span style="color: #0000FF;">no<br/>

<br/>
Egypt now enjoyed another period of prosperity. Trade began to<br/>
flourish owing to the new relations with Greece. Art also received<br/>
a fresh impetus; even under the Ethiopian kings artists had begun<br/>
to imitate the models of the classic period <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Egyptian art under<br/>
the Early Empire and to revive the ancient forms. This reversion<br/>
to the ancient times appeared also in other departments, <span style="color: #ff0000;">spch </span>as<br/>
literature, the spelling of inscriptions, and even the titles of <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflieials</span>, so that the period of the 26th Dyn. may be styled the Egyptian Renaissance.<br/>

deadly contest with the Babylonians and Medes, Nekho<br/>
