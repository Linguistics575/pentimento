<span>Temple of Ammon. THEBES (E. BANK). <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>Route. 253<br/>
<br/>
its Vestibule still projects. On the rear of the S. tower (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>is a<br/>
long inscription (unfortunately imperfect at the top), recording the<br/>
gifts of Amenophis III. to the god Ammon; <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>on the rear of the<br/>
N. tower (Pl. m) are seen the last remnants of a larger representation of a festal voyage, in the shape of a sacred bark of Ammon<br/>
with the king on board and another fully manned ship.<br/>
<br/>
On passing through the third pylon into the Central <span style="color: #0000FF;">Court<br/>
</span>we come first upon an <span style="color: #0000FF;">OBELISK </span>the last survivor of four, erected <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>pairs by Thutmosis I. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">Is </span>76 ft. high and stands upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>base <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>ft.<br/>
square. On each face of the obelisk are three <span style="color: #0000FF;">vertical </span>inscriptions,<br/>
the central one being the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicatory </span>inscription of Thutmosis L,<br/>
and the other two additions by Ramses IV. and Ramses VI. The<br/>
bases of the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span>are adjacent. The obelisks marked the<br/>
entrance to the temple in the reign of Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">L<br/>
<br/>
</span>A deviation <span style="color: #0000FF;">may </span>here be made to inspect the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Historical </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Retiefs </span>on the<br/>
exterior walls of the great hypostyle hall (comp. p. 251<span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Next <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows </span>Pylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">W</span>, in a most ruinous condition, beyond<br/>
which are the scanty remains of the First Colonnade, originally<br/>
embellished with columns and <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statues of Osiris. Within<br/>
this <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>rose the two great OBELISKS of Queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Makere</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, made<br/>
of tine pink granite from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuan</span>, and covered at the apex with<br/>
electrum (a mixture of gold and silver). The Right Obelisk has been<br/>
overthrown, and the top has fallen some distance to the N. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*cht </span>Obelisk, still standing, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">97</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>high and its diameter at<br/>
the base is 81/2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span>; it is the tallest obelisk known, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">exception </span>of that in the piazza in front <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Lateran at Rome, which is<br/>
105 ft. high. The inscriptions record that the obelisks were made<br/>
in 7 months. Originally there was only the customary single vertical inscription on each face; but afterwards, on the upper parts<br/>
reliefs were added, showing <span style="color: #0000FF;">Makere</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, and Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>. The names and figures of Ammon were obliterated by Amenophis IV., but restored by Sethos I.<br/>
<br/>
This Colonnade underwent various <span style="color: #0000FF;">transformations </span>under the 18th Dynasty. When <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>I. built it originally it had two rows with <span style="color: #0000FF;">five<br/>
</span>columns <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>each to the left, and two with six columns in each to the<br/>
right, supporting roofs. When <span style="color: #0000FF;">Makers </span>erected the <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span>in the 16th<br/>
year of her reign, the columns to the right and two pairs of those to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">left </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>removed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>III. surrounded the <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span>with a sandstone structure which concealed more than half of them, and portions of<br/>
which still remain. Finally <span style="color: #0000FF;">under </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the right half of the colonnade was restored and six pairs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus-columns </span>were erected, of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, however, only the stumps are now left.<br/>
<br/>
As we proceed towards the E., we pass the Fifth Pylon, also<br/>
erected by Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, which forms the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back-wall </span>of the colonnade<br/>
just described, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">enter </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Second Colonnade, another erection<br/>
of Thutmosis I. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>had <span style="color: #0000FF;">sixteen-sided </span>columns <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>is<br/>
now much ruined. On each side of the central passage Thutmosis III.<br/>
constructed two <span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers</span>, with a granite gateway (restored by<br/>
Sethos <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>) between. Beyond this gateway rises the Sixth Pylon<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
