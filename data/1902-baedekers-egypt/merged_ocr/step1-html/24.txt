the police<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Payment of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">boat-fare </span>should not be made until the<br/>
passenger and his luggage are safe on deck. Before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">heavier </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">luggage<br/>
</span>is lowered into the hold, the passenger should see it properly labelled.<br/>
All complaints should be addressed to the captain. On board the<br/>
foreign steamers a kind of military precision is affected, and questions<br/>
addressed to the officers or crew are apt to be answered very <span style="color: #0000FF;">curtly</span>.<br/>

</span>Railways. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">off1cial </span>time-tables are published in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Indicateur </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">des </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Chemins </span>de fer de l'Egypte, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is sold for <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>pias. at the<br/>
chief railway-stations, and is also to be seen in the larger hotels.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">railway-carriages </span>resemble those of France or Italy. <span style="color: #0000FF;">First-class<br/>
</span>passengers are permitted to take a reasonable quantity of small luggage with them into the carriages. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">second-class </span>carriages are<br/>
comfortable enough for day-journeys on the main routes (Alexandria<br/>
to Cairo, Cairo to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mange</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, Cairo to Suez, Cairo <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuim</span>), especially<br/>
by the express-trains; and their use effects a very considerable<br/>
saving in fares. But on branch-lines all travellers should take<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first-class </span>tickets. The third-class carriages are quite unsuited for<br/>
Europeans. The management of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">traffie</span>, except in the case of<br/>
express-trains, is not very satisfactory. The process of booking<br/>
luggage is especially slow and troublesome. The traveller should<br/>
therefore be at the station fully half-an-hour before the hour for<br/>
starting, as the ticket-clerks are entitled to close the <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftiee </span>ten<br/>
minutes before the departure of the train. The personal tickets are<br/>
printed in English and Arabic, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">1uggage-tielrets </span>in Arabic only.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">luggage-tariff </span>is somewhat complicated; <span style="color: #ff0000;">551bs</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hand-luggage<br/>
</span>are free. - In hot weather the dust, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>penetrates the carriages<br/>
even when the windows are closed, renders railway travelling in<br/>
Egypt exceedingly unpleasant. At the chief stations on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">expressroutes </span>there are Railway Buffets in the European style. At other<br/>
stations refreshments are brought to the carriage-windows (bargaining necessary; 3-5 oranges <span style="color: #0000FF;">1/2-1 </span>pies.) The water offered for sale<br/>
is better abstained from.<br/>
<br/>
Narrow Gauge Railways. The Egyptian Light Railways cover<br/>
the Delta and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayf1m </span>(p. 174) with a network of lines, which,<br/>
though of little importance to the ordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">tourist</span>, enable the explorer and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">specialist </span>to reach various remote sites with comparative ease. These lines do not yet appear in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">qndieate11r</span>',<br/>
but they are mentioned at the appropriate places in our text.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Electric </span>Tramways ply in Alexandria and Cairo. They have<br/>
two classes; Europeans invariably patronize the first only.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cabs </span>have now quite superseded donkeys as the accepted means<br/>
of conveyance for Europeans in Cairo and Alexandria. Notwithstanding the <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>tariffs a special bargain should be made in every<br/>
case, especially for drives of any length. Few of the drivers understand any European language or are able to read the names of the<br/>
streets, while many of them know the various points only by names<br/>
of their own. <span style="color: #0000FF;">But </span>Arabs with a smattering of European languages<br/>
