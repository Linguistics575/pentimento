several times subsequently. The town suffered severely in other<br/>
ways also, and indeed its whole history, so far as recorded, like<br/>
that of the sultans and the Mamelukes themselves, seems to have<br/>
presented an almost continuous succession of revolutions, rapine, and<br/>
bloodshed. As most of the Mameluke <span style="color: #ff0000;">sultans </span>who resided in the<br/>
citadel died a violent death, so the reign of almost every new potentate began with <span style="color: #0000FF;">bitter </span>and sanguinary contests among the emirs<br/>
for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">offiee </span>of vizier, while <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>few reigns were undisturbed <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">insurrections </span>in the capital. During the third <span style="color: #0000FF;">regime </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">en-Nis.dr</span>, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>been twice deposed and as often recovered his<br/>
throne, a persecution of the Christians took place at Cairo. The<br/>
Christians, of whom great numbers resided in Cairo and throughout<br/>
the whole of Egypt, were accused by the people of incendiarism. Their<br/>
churches were closed or demolished, while they themselves were so<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ill-treated </span>and oppressed, especially in the reign of Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">561</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">%<br/>
</span>1351-54), that many of them are said to have embraced Islamism.<br/>
In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1366 </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1367</span>, in the reign of Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">tillia'litm</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanguinary </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">conflicts </span>took place in the streets of Cairo between hostile parties of<br/>
Mamelukes, and in 1377 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sha'ben </span>himself was tortured and strangled<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">citadel</span>. Even greater disorders attended the dethronement<br/>
of Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bargain </span>(1389), when the wildest anarchy prevailed at<br/>
Cairo, the convicts escaped from their prisons, and in concert with<br/>
the populace plundered the houses of the emirs and the public<br/>
magazines. The following year another rebellion among the Mamelukes restored <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barlttllt </span>to the throne. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Scarcely</span>, however, had he<br/>
closed his eyes and been succeeded by Farag (1399), when the Mamelukes again revolted, and renewed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bor1fr1ets </span>took place for possession of the citadel, during which the city was partly plundered.<br/>
Similar scenes were repeated on almost every change of government.<br/>
The turbulence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>, who were always treated with<br/>
too much consideration by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sultans</span>, became more and more unbearable; they robbed the people in the markets, assaulted citizens<br/>
in the public streets, and grossly insulted respectable women.<br/>
<br/>
On 26th Jan., 1517, the Osman sultan Selim <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, after having<br/>
gained a victory in the neighbourhood of Heliopolis (p.107), entered the city. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tt1mtrn </span>Bey, the last Mameluke sultan, was taken<br/>
prisoner and executed (p. 48). Selim caused the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>marble<br/>
columns which adorned the palace in the citadel to be removed to<br/>
Constantinople. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thenceforward </span>Cairo became <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>mere provincial<br/>
capital, and its history is almost an entire blank down to the period<br/>
of the French expedition. - On 22nd <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">uly</span>, 1798, after the Battle<br/>
of the Pyramids, Cairo was occupied by Bonaparte, who established<br/>
his headquarters here for several months, and quelled with sanguinary severity an insurrection which broke <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>among the populace on <span style="color: #0000FF;">23rd-26th </span>September. At the beginning of the year 1799<br/>
Bonaparte started from Cairo on his Syrian expedition, and on his<br/>
return to <span style="color: #ff0000;">France7 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Kleber </span>was left as <span style="color: #ff0000;">eornmander-in-ehief </span>of the<br/>
