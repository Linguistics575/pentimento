are frequently of a dark colour, but in many cases are scarcely<br/>
distinguishable from those of orthodox believers.<br/>
<br/>
The Women of the poorer and rustic classes wear nothing but<br/>
a blue gown and a veil. Their ornaments consist of silver, copper,<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">head </span>bracelets, earrings, and ankle-rings,<br/>
while their chins, arms, and chests are often<br/>
tatooed with blue marks. Similar tatooing<br/>
is also common among the men. In Upper<br/>
Egypt nose-rings are also frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">seen<br/>
</span>The women of the upper classes are never<br/>
so handsomely dressed in the streets as at<br/>
home. When equipped for riding or walking, they wear a silk cloak, with very wide<br/>
sleeves (<span style="color: #ff0000;">to'b </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">sableh</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">,0yer </span>their home attire.<br/>
They also don the <span style="color: #0000FF;">buried</span>, or veil, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>consists of a long strip of muslin, covering the<br/>
whole of the face except the eyes, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">reaching </span>nearly to the feet. Lastly they put on<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">babam</span>, a kind of mantle, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>in<br/>
the case of married women consists of two<br/>
breadths of glossy black silk. Thus disguised,<br/>
they look unnaturally <span style="color: #0000FF;">broad </span>and unwieldy,<br/>
and not unlike bats. Young girls usually wear a white mantle.<br/>
The wealthier ladies, who drive in their carriages attended by <span style="color: #0000FF;">eunuchs</span>, usually veil their faces up to their eyes with thin white<br/>
gauze in <span style="color: #0000FF;">accordance </span>with the fashion of Constantinople. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures<br/>
</span>of Egyptian women, in early life, are generally upright and <span style="color: #0000FF;">graceful</span>. They <span style="color: #0000FF;">colour </span>their eyelashes and eyelids<br/>
dark, and their <span style="color: #0000FF;">finger </span>and toe-nails with<br/>
henna, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>gives them a brownish-yellow<br/>
tint. Among other customs we may also<br/>
mention the peculiar'mode in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">WOman </span>carries her child, either astride her<br/>
shoulder, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>resting on her hip. With <span style="color: #0000FF;">regard<br/>
</span>to circumcision, weddings, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">funerals</span>, see<br/>

Amid this busy throng of men and animals<br/>
resound the warning shouts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">outrunners<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">siis</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">coachmen</span>, donkey- attendants, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">camel-drivers</span>, The words most commonly<br/>
heard are <span style="color: #ff0000;">-'riglak</span>',<span style="color: #ff0000;">'ahemtrlak</span>',<span style="color: #ff0000;">'verntnak</span>',<br/>
Wd, <span style="color: #0000FF;">war</span>. As a rule, these warnings are<br/>
accompanied by some <span style="color: #ff0000;">partieularizing </span>title.<br/>
