<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">xviii </span>HOTELS.<br/>
<br/>
are usually to be found standing about near the hotels and one of<br/>
these may be employed as interpreter (though offers of farther service<br/>
should be firmly declined). The traveller should keep his eye on<br/>
the direction taken by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eats</span>, as sometimes the <span style="color: #ff0000;">oabman </span>drives<br/>
straight ahead in complete ignorance of the way, and requires to be<br/>
guided, <span style="color: #ff0000;">6.9. </span>by being touched with a stick on the right or left arm<br/>
according to the turning, or with the words <span style="color: #ff0000;">yemfnalc </span>(to the right),<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">shemdlak </span>(to the left), <span style="color: #ff0000;">dughri </span>(straight on). The cabs usually drive<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rapidly</span>, so that their use saves time and strength.<br/>
<br/>
Donkeys (Arab. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zaomdr</span>) still form the best means of conveyance,<br/>
not only in the smaller towns and on the bridle-paths in the country,<br/>
but also in the environs of Cairo, as they can go anywhere and are<br/>
not <span style="color: #ff0000;">eontined </span>to the dusty carriage-roads. Egyptian donkeys are of a<br/>
much finer, swifter, and more spirited race than the European, and<br/>
are at the same time patient and persevering. Those in the towns are<br/>
generally well saddled and bridled in Oriental style. In the country<br/>
both the donkeys and equipment are inferior; saddles, stirrups, and<br/>
even bridles are occasionally <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuous </span>by their absence. As the<br/>
gait of some of the donkeys is very uneasy when they break into<br/>
a trot, care should be taken not to engage one with this defect for<br/>
an excursion of any length. The best method of guiding the donkey<br/>
is to strike it lightly on the head with a stick. The donkey-boys<br/>
(Arab. <span style="color: #ff0000;">hammc'ir</span>) are fond of showing off the pace of their beasts,<br/>
and often drive them unpleasantly fast, though galloping is <span style="color: #0000FF;">forbidden </span>in the towns. The rider who prefers a slower pace shouts<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'ala </span>mahlak or'ala <span style="color: #ff0000;">mahlakum</span>; if a quicker pace is wanted, yalla,<br/>
yalla, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">miisht</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">safe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-hom/ir</span>; if a halt is to be made, <span style="color: #ff0000;">oybur</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>the English word'stop'. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-boys </span>(especially at Cairo) are<br/>
usually active and intelligent, though occasionally <span style="color: #0000FF;">mischievous </span>and<br/>
impudent. At some of the most frequented tourist-resorts the traveller has to protect himself from the charge of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">importunate </span>light<br/>
cavalry by threatening to use his stick.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">dj</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hotels<br/>
<br/>
</span>The large hotels in Cairo and its environs <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>among the best in<br/>
the world, combining western comfort with eastern luxury. Almost<br/>
as much may be said for the leading houses at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Luxor </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assufm<br/>
</span>(comp. pp. 233, 327), while there are very fair hotels at Alexandria,<br/>
Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Said</span>, and a few other places. They are managed mainly on the<br/>
American system, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>sum daily <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'21</span>) being paid for lodging<br/>
and board, the latter consisting of breakfast, <span style="color: #0000FF;">luncheon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and dinner.<br/>
Wine, beer, and other liquors, which are extras, are dear, the<br/>
cheapest wine costing 10-15 pias. per bottle, and British and <span style="color: #0000FF;">German </span>beer about the same. The waiter's fee should be calculated<br/>
at about 5 per cent of the bill. Clothing given out to wash is <span style="color: #0000FF;">charged<br/>
</span>at the rate of 21/2-3 fr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">per </span>dozen articles for gentlemen's garments<br/>
4-5 fr. per dozen for ladies' garments, quite irrespective of <span style="color: #0000FF;">size</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t<br/>
