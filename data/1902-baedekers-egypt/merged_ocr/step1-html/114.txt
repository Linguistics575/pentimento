The British reached the Nile at Gubat, <span style="color: #0000FF;">just </span>above <span style="color: #ff0000;">Metemmeh</span>, on the evening of Jan. <span style="color: #ff0000;">19th</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>Jan. 24th a<br/>
small body <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span>under Sir Chas. Wilson set out <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Klum</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ttun </span>in two <span style="color: #0000FF;">steamboats </span>which Gordon had sent to meet<br/>
them. Sir Charles reached <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttm </span>on the 28th, but<br/>
found that it had already fallen <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the 26th, apparently<br/>
through <span style="color: #0000FF;">treachery</span>, and that Gordon had perished.<br/>
<br/>
The project of <span style="color: #ff0000;">reeonquering </span>the Egyptian Sudan from the<br/>
Mahdists was temporarily abandoned, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span>Halfa <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilemained </span>the S. limit of the Khedive's dominions (p. xxxi).<br/>
Though <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suakin </span>became the basis<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>of more or less desultory<br/>
operations against Osman Digna, the British devoted their<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*chief </span>attention to developing and improving the <span style="color: #0000FF;">administration </span>of Egypt proper. Negotiations on the part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Porte</span>,<br/>
instigated by France and Russia, to bring the British <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupation </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt'to </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">close</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>have hitherto proved fruitless.<br/>
A loan of <span style="color: #0000FF;">9,000,0001</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>was raised by the British for the<br/>
purpose of regulating the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">finances</span>. In 1887 a<br/>
convention with France established the unconditional neutrality of the Suez Canal.<br/>
<br/>
The Khedive Tewfik died on January <span style="color: #ff0000;">7th,1892</span>, and was<br/>
succeeded by his eldest son Abbas II. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eilmi </span>(b. <span style="color: #0000FF;">July </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">14th</span>,<br/>
1874), whose accession was confirmed by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">firman </span>of the<br/>
Porte, dated March 26th, 1892. His independence of action<br/>
is controlled by the British plenipotentiary, Lord <span style="color: #0000FF;">Grower<br/>
</span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">26</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. In the spring of 1896 a British-Egyptian military<br/>
force under Sir Herbert Kitchener (now Lord <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kitchen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ehartihn</span>) commenced operations against the Mahdists to<br/>
the S. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span>Halfa. On Sept. 2nd, 1898, the Mahdist<br/>
army was defeated in a decisive engagement, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Omdurmin</span>, their capital, situated on the left bank of the Nile,<br/>
opposite <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttim</span>, was taken. Since then the Egyptian<br/>
Sudan, reunited to Egypt, has been under <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">special </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">AngloEgyptian </span>administration (see p. 380), at the head of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>is a British Governor-General, who is also <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sirdar </span>of the<br/>
Egyptian army. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttnn </span>was rebuilt <span style="color: #ff0000;">as</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>the centre of<br/>
