<span style="color: #ff0000;">tablishment </span>of schools<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the reorganisation of the system<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">justice </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">sk</span>), and the like, he acted rather with an<br/>
eye to produce an impression in Europe than from real<br/>
concern for the needs of his subjects. As time went on he<br/>
succeeded in appropriating for his own use about <span style="color: #ff0000;">onefifth </span>of the cultivable land of Egypt. In 1866, in consideration of a large sum of money, he obtained the sanction of the Porte to a new order of succession based on the<br/>
law of <span style="color: #ff0000;">pri1r1ogeniture</span>, and in 1867 he was raised to the<br/>
rank of Khedive, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Viceroy, having previously borne the<br/>
title of <span style="color: #ff0000;">tvifli</span>, or governor of a province only. In 1873 the<br/>
Khedive obtained a new <span style="color: #ff0000;">tirrntm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oontirming </span>and extending<br/>
his privileges <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>independence of administration and judiciaries; right <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">concluding </span>treaties with foreign countries;<br/>
right of coining money; right of borrowing money; permission to increase his army and navy). The annual tribute<br/>
payable to the Porte was at the same time raised to <span style="color: #0000FF;">133,635<br/>
</span>purses (about <span style="color: #ff0000;">68l,53810</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The warlike <span style="color: #0000FF;">successes </span>of the<br/>
Khedive resulted in the extension of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">dominions </span>to<br/>
the borders of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abyssinia </span>and, on the S., to the 2nd parallel <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>latitude. - The burden of the public debt had<br/>
now increased to upwards of 100 million pounds, one<br/>
loan after another having been negotiated. The Powers<br/>
brought such a pressure to bear on the Khedive that he<br/>
was compelled to resign his private and family estates to<br/>
the state and to accept a ministry under the presidency<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubar </span>Pasha, with the portfolio of public works entrusted to M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bligni√©res </span>and that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance </span>to Mr. Rivers<br/>
Wilson. This coalition, however, soon proved unworkable;<br/>
and early in 1879 the whole cabinet was replaced by a native ministry under Sherif Pasha. The patience of the<br/>
Great Powers was now at an end; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the initiative of<br/>
Germany they demanded from the Porte the deposition<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Isma'il</span>, which accordingly took <span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>on <span style="color: #0000FF;">June </span>26th<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Isma'il was succeeded by his son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfik </span>(pronounced <span style="color: #0000FF;">Teofik</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
<br/>
</span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Taufilg</span>, under whom the government was carried <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>in<br/>
a more rational spirit. The debts were regulated, an international commission of liquidation was appointed, and<br/>
an extensive scheme of reform was undertaken. In Sept.,<br/>
1881, however, a military revolution broke out in Cairo,<br/>
which had for its objects the dismissal of the ministry, the<br/>
grant of a constitution, and above all the emancipation of<br/>
Egypt from European <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences</span>. The Khedive was besieged<br/>
in his palace and had to yield; he appointed Sherif president of a new ministry and arranged for an election of<br/>
Notables, or representatives. As the latter espoused the<br/>
'national' cause, Sherif resigned in Feb., 1882, and Malt<br/>
