<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">DOCTRINES </span>OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">EL-ISLAM</span>. lxvii<br/>
<br/>
Although POLYGAMY is sanctioned, every Muslim being permitted to have four <span style="color: #ff0000;">wives </span>at a time, yet among the bulk of the population monogamy is far more frequent, owing to the difficulty of<br/>
providing for several wives and families at once<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The wives, moreover, are very apt to quarrel, to the utter destruction of domestic<br/>
peace, unless the husband can afford to assign them separate houses.<br/>
Few men remain unmarried. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">treatment </span>of women as mere chattels, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is of very remote Oriental origin, constitutes the greatest<br/>
defect of the system of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islas</span>, although the position <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>female<br/>
sex among the Oriental Christians and Jews is little better than<br/>
among the Muslims. It is probably owing to this low estimate of<br/>
women that the Muslims generally dislike to see them praying or<br/>
occupying themselves with religion. The practice of wearing veils<br/>
dates from very remote times (Genesis xxiv, <span style="color: #0000FF;">65</span>; Isaiah iii, 23), though<br/>
it is doubtful whether it was customary among the ancient Egyptians,<br/>
as veiled women never appear upon the monuments. A Muslim is<br/>
not permitted to see any women unveiled except his wife and slaves<br/>
and his blood-relations; when there are lady visitors in the harem,<br/>
he must announce his approach before entering, so as to afford them<br/>
an opportunity of retiring. An Oriental lady would, indeed, regard<br/>
it as an affront to be permitted to mingle in society with the same<br/>
freedom as European ladies. Even in the Christian churches (except the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Protestant </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>the place for <span style="color: #ff0000;">women </span>is often separated from<br/>
the men's seats by a railing. The peasant and Beduin women, 011<br/>
the other hand, are often seen unveiled. The ease with which <span style="color: #ff0000;">ElIslthn </span>permits divorce is due to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed</span>'s personal <span style="color: #0000FF;">proclivities</span>.<br/>
A single word from the husband <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffices </span>to banish the wife from his<br/>
house, but she retains the marriage-portion <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>she has received<br/>
from her husband. The children are brought up'in great subjection<br/>
to their parents, often showing more fear than love for them.<br/>
<br/>
The repetition of PRAYERS (<span style="color: #0000FF;">gala</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>times daily is one of<br/>
the chief duties of faithful Muslims. The hours of prayer (<span style="color: #ff0000;">adén</span>)<br/>
are proclaimed by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mueddins </span>(or muezzins) from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">minarets </span>of<br/>
the mosques: (1) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maghrib</span>, a little after sunset; (2<span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">muh</span>, nightfall, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>% hour after sunset; (3) Subh, daybreak; (4) <span style="color: #ff0000;">pulir</span>,<br/>
midday; (5)<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Ay</span>, afternoon, about 3 hours after midday. These<br/>
periods of prayer also serve to mark the divisions of the day. The<br/>
day is also divided into two periods of 12 hours each, beginning<br/>
from sunset, so that where clocks and watches are used they require<br/>
to be set daily. Most people however content themselves with the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sonorous </span>call of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mueddin</span>: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Alléhu </span>akbar (three times); <span style="color: #ff0000;">ashhadu<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Allc'ihu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">akbar </span>(twice), <span style="color: #ff0000;">td </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ildha </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ill'alldh</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Allah </span>is great; I<br/>
testify that there is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is the prophet of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Allah</span>; come to prayer; come to worship; Allah is great;<br/>
there is no God but <span style="color: #0000FF;">Artie</span>'. This call to prayer sometimes also<br/>
