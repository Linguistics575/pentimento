stream, however, which averages 3 miles an <span style="color: #0000FF;">hour</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>is not <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>serious<br/>
an impediment to the navigation as the frequent changes <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>take place in the formation of its channel, sometimes <span style="color: #ff0000;">oeeasioning<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">difiieulties </span>which the most careful of captains is unable to foresee<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>This remarkable river has exercised a unique <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>on the<br/>
history of civilisation. The necessity <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">controlling </span>its <span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span>and<br/>
utilising its water taught the ancient Egyptians the art of <span style="color: #ff0000;">riverengineering </span>and the kindred science of <span style="color: #0000FF;">land-surveying</span>, while in the<br/>
starry heavens they beheld the eternal calendar which regulated the<br/>
approach and the departure of the inundation, so that the river may<br/>
perhaps have given the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">impulse </span>to the study of astronomy. As<br/>
the annual overflow of the water obliterated all landmarks, it was<br/>
necessary annually to measure the land anew, and to keep a register<br/>
of the area belonging to each proprietor; and above all it became<br/>
an important duty of the rulers of the people to impress them with<br/>
a strong sense of the sacredness of property. Every succeeding year,<br/>
however, there arose new disputes, and these showed the necessity<br/>
of establishing settled laws and enforcing judicial decisions. The<br/>
Nile thus led to the foundation of social, legal, and political order<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Subsequently, when the engineers and architects, in the service<br/>
of the state or in the cause of religion, erected those colossal <span style="color: #0000FF;">structures </span>with which we are about to become acquainted, it was the<br/>
Nile which materially facilitated the transport of their materials,<br/>
and enabled the builders of the pyramids and the other ancient<br/>
Egyptians to employ the granite of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan </span>for the structures of<br/>
Memphis, and even for those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tania</span>, on the coast of the Mediterranean. As the river, moreover, not only afforded a convenient<br/>
route for the transport of these building-materials, but also an admirable commercial highway, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">tInd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>acquired<br/>
considerable skill at a very early period in constructing <span style="color: #ff0000;">vessels<br/>
</span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">cars</span>, masts, sails, and even cabins and other appliances<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>From the earliest historical period down to the present time the<br/>
course of the Nile, from the cataracts down to its bifurcation to the north<br/>
of Cairo, has undergone very little change. This, however, is not the<br/>
case with its <span style="color: #ff0000;">EsusuurJuuurssi </span>for, while ancient writers mention seven<br/>
(the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusiac</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tanitic</span>, the Mendesian, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bucolic </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phatnitic</span>, the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sebennytie</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bolbitinic</span>, and the Canopic), there are now practically<br/>
two channels only through which the river is discharged into the sea.<br/>
These are the mouths at Rosetta (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rashid</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>and Damietta <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dumyat</span>), situated near the middle of the Delta, while the Pelusiac and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canopic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mouths</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>the most Important in ancient times, lay at the extreme east <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>west<br/>

Alexandria the traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>observe the massive blocks of stone from<br/>
the quarries of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meks </span>(p. 18) of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">quays </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructed</span>. They consist of recent tertiary, light-coloured, sandy limestone, composed <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>of<br/>
innumerable broken fragments of <span style="color: #0000FF;">conchylia</span>, a kind of <span style="color: #ff0000;">rock </span>which extends<br/>
far to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">west </span>of Alexandria<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and probably constitutes the greater part of<br/>
the lofty <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cyreneean </span>plain. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock </span>supplies forms the <span style="color: #ff0000;">buildine-stone<br/>
</span>generally used at Alexandria, and is <span style="color: #0000FF;">also </span>employed in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">harhomr-straetures </span>of Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fla'id.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
