<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">F</span>), adorned with reliefs. On the back-wall of the second are<br/>
two lions sitting face to face; above them is a baboon (Thout)<br/>
worshipping the goddess Tefnut (in the form of a lioness); higher<br/>
up are two ibises.<br/>
<br/>
. The SANCTUARY (P1. E), in which fragments of the granite shrine<br/>
still lie on the ground, is embellished with reliefs by an <span style="color: #ff0000;">11nidentified<br/>
</span>emperor, who appears in them before various deities. In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">rearwall </span>are a door (of later construction ] and two windows, surmounted<br/>
by the winged sun-disk. On the outside of this wall was a large<br/>
door-shaped recess, containing a relief of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thout </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pnubs</span>.<br/>
<br/>
On the E. bank, nearly opposite Dakkeh, lies the village of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Euhban</span>, with the ruins of a Fortress of the Middle Empire. This<br/>
was enclosed by a lofty wall of sun-dried bricks, mats, and wooden<br/>
logs, and was defended by a ditch. Within the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'angle </span>of the<br/>
wall lay a small temple. - Adjacent are two almost completely<br/>
demolished Temples, one to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>, the other to the N. of the village.<br/>
Near the former is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cistemhewn </span>in the rock, to the E. of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>several tombs of the Middle Empire, excavated in the ground.<br/>
<br/>
From <span style="color: #ff0000;">1.rubbiin </span>a route led through the extensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">dei'Aut.ki </span>to the<br/>
numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">gold-mines </span>there, which were worked until the middle ages<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Granite mortars and mills and other apparatus used in the search for gold<br/>
are still to be seen, especially in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wddi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khawamib</span>.<br/>
<br/>
At (38 M.) Kurteh, on the W. bank, are the ruins of a small<br/>
temple, dedicated to Isis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the site of an earlier shrine of the<br/>
Middle Empire. - In the river lies the large and <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-cultivated<br/>
</span>island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Derdr</span>, known also as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Geziret </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ffurteh</span>. Opposite the S. end<br/>
of this island, and to the S. of the hamlets of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ofedutneh </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Birbeh</span>,<br/>
lies the Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ofeduineh</span>, also called Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maharalga</span>. This<br/>
marks the site of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span>town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hiertrsykatttinoe</span>, which lay on<br/>
the extreme boundary of the Egyptian kingdom under the Ptolemies<br/>
and the Romans. The now <span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ruined </span>temple dates from the<br/>
Roman period, but it was left unfinished and never fully decorated<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">reliefs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>it was dedicated to Isis and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapis</span>. The only <span style="color: #0000FF;">remains<br/>
</span>now left are those of a rectangular court, which was surrounded<br/>
on three sides by covered colonnades. The main axis of the court<br/>
runs E. and W.; the entrance is on the E. side. No columns are now<br/>
standing except five on the S. side, once connected with each other<br/>
by screen-walls. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ICE</span>, corner is a remarkable spiral staircase<br/>
of masonry, which led to the roof of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>. - About 16 ft.<br/>
to the E. of this court are the ruins of another building, of which<br/>
only the rear-wall is now <span style="color: #0000FF;">erect</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the outer side of this are several<br/>
reliefs and inscriptions, notably a relief in the Greek style representing Isis recumbent beneath the sacred fig-tree. Upon the tree<br/>
perches a hawk, while another hovers above; a man, bearing the lock<br/>
of youth, presents a vessel to the goddess, and above to the left<br/>
appear Min, Isis, and Serapis. The same scene is repeated on a<br/>
smaller scale, below, to the right. On the ground near the temple<br/>
are heaps of <span style="color: #0000FF;">potsherds </span>of the Byzantine period.<br/>
