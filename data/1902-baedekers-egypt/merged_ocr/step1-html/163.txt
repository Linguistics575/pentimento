frequently worn as an amulet. The symbol signifies union. It is<br/>
<br/>
frequently observed at the base of statues, entwined with lilies and<br/>
papyrus-plants, where it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbolical </span>of the union of Upper and<br/>
Lower Egypt, and is equivalent to the national arms of Egypt.<br/>

IX. Greek (Alexandrian) Art in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">By </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">jProfessor </span>Theodor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Schreiber </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Leipsic</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Early Egyptian Art did not die out with the Pharaohs; both<br/>
under the Ptolemies and, later still, under the Roman emperors,<br/>
temples in the old style were raised, restored, or enlarged, and were<br/>
adorned as before with statues, <span style="color: #0000FF;">frescoes</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>, while the<br/>
worship of the old national gods was continued in them unchanged.<br/>
But the new rulers and the Greeks who immigrated with them<br/>
established Hellenic customs, art, and science in Egypt, as they had<br/>
been established in the other kingdoms of Alexander's successors.<br/>
Alexandria, the mighty creation of Alexander the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Great</span>, destined to<br/>
be the centre of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">empire</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>became, as the residence of his successors, the Ptolemies, who distinguished themselves as patrons of<br/>
learning, the central point of the intellectual interests of the Hellenic world, though Athens, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">course</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>still retained some of her old<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">supremacy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and Pergamum at a later date also entered the lists.<br/>
In the Museum of Alexandria investigations concerned with the<br/>
direct observation of men and things, were carried on side by side<br/>
with the literary and historical studies of scholars. Poets and artists<br/>
gathered in crowds at the brilliant court; and the royal passion for<br/>
building undertook tasks undreamt of by earlier Greek art, and<br/>
which, indeed, with its limited resources, that art could never have<br/>
achieved. East and West met in Egypt, and the most diverse peoples<br/>
- <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greeks</span>, Egyptians, <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ews</span>, Negroes from the interior of Africa, etc.<br/>
- mingled there in the closest association, in which the Greeks,<br/>
though the dominant element, adapted themselves to many of the<br/>
native religious and social <span style="color: #0000FF;">customs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and learned to keep their eyes<br/>
open to the good qualities of their neighbours. Thus there arose in<br/>
Egypt the neo-Greek culture which we are accustomed to call Het<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
