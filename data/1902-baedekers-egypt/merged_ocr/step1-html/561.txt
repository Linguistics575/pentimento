Nos. <span style="color: #0000FF;">22-25 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lie </span>in the West Valley of the Tombs of the Kings<br/>
(p. 278).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nos</span>. 26-31 are <span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant</span>.<br/>
<br/>
No. 32, probably a royal tomb of the 18th Dyn., has not yet been<br/>
fully explored.<br/>
<br/>
No. 33, a small tomb with two empty rooms, reached by a flight<br/>
of steps, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">discovered </span>by Loret.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*No</span>. 34. The Tomb of Thutmosis m., discovered by Loret in<br/>
1899, lies in an abrupt and narrow rocky ravine, about 275 yds. to<br/>
the S. of the Tomb of Ramses Ill. The entrance, reached by a steep<br/>
flight of steps, is closed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>iron door. A sloping corridor descends<br/>
hence to a staircase, with broad niches to the right and left, beyond<br/>
which another corridor leads to a rectangular shaft, about 20 ft. deep,<br/>
probably intended as a protection against grave-robbers but now<br/>
crossed by a hand-bridge. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">ceiling </span>is adorned with white stars<br/>
on a blue ground.<br/>
<br/>
Farther on we <span style="color: #0000FF;">enter </span>a room borne by two <span style="color: #0000FF;">unadorned </span>pillars. The<br/>
ceiling is decorated with stars, and the walls bear the names of 741<br/>
different gods and daemons. - <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the left corner of the rear-wall is<br/>
a staircase leading to the TOMB CHAMBER, with has the form of an<br/>
oval king's ring. Two square pillars bear the ceiling, with its yellow<br/>
stars <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>a blue background. The walls are covered with excellently<br/>
preserved scenes and citations from the'Book of the Underworld'.<br/>
The representations on the pillars are of Special interest. On one<br/>
face of the first pillar stands a long religious inscription; on the<br/>
second face are Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>and the Queen-Mother Isis in a<br/>
boat (at the top), the king suckled by Isis in the form of a tree<br/>
(below), and the king followed by his wives <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meryt-Re</span>, Ah-sat,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nebtkhrow</span>, and the Princess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nofret-ere</span>; on the third face are<br/>
daemons. The second pillar has daemons and another long inscription.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Smcommus </span>is of red sandstone, and its scenes and inscriptions are in red paint; it was empty when the tomb was opened,<br/>
and the mummy of the king was found at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-bahri </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">283 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>.<br/>
The objects found in the four small adjoining rooms are now in<br/>
Gizeh Museum (p. 103).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*No</span>. 35. Tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">AmenoPhis </span>IL, discovered by Loret in 1898,<br/>
about <span style="color: #ff0000;">200 </span>yds. to the W. of the Tomb of Ramses III. Part of its<br/>
contents has been left on the spot (comp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">101</span>). From the entrance<br/>
steep flights of steps and sloping corridors descend to a shaft (now<br/>
bridged), in the depth of which is the opening to a small chamber,<br/>
and on to a room, the walls and pillars of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are quite <span style="color: #0000FF;">unadorned</span>.<br/>
Here lies the mummy of a woman, on a boat bearing the name of<br/>
Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>. From the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-corner </span>of this apartment a staircase descends to a sloping corridor and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>room borne by six<br/>
pillars. At the back of this is a kind of crypt. On the pillars Amenophis ll, is represented before the gods of death. The blue ceiling<br/>
