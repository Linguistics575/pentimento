the Gebel Silsileh, and afterwards to the First Cataract. Each of<br/>
these states was subdivided into a number of small principalities,<br/>
originally independent but afterwards dependent, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>still existed<br/>
in historic times as'nomes' or provinces. The two Egyptian kingdoms were for <span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>time hostile to each other. Their union seems to<br/>
have been operated from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Upper </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>and was subsequently ascribed<br/>
to King Menes. The memory of the division subsisted beyond the<br/>
dawn of the historic period; the arms of the united empire were<br/>
formed by the union of the lily and the papyrus, the symbolical<br/>
plants of Upper and Lower Egypt; the king styled himself'king<br/>
of Upper and Lower Egypt' or'Lord of both Lands', and wore the<br/>
<br/>
double <span style="color: #0000FF;">tiara </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>consisting of the white crown (<span style="color: #0000FF;">if</span>) of the S.<br/>
<br/>
and the red crown y of the N.; <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>at the base <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the temple<br/>
walls were represented on one side the provinces of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>, and on<br/>
the other the provinces of the N. Even in matters of administration<br/>
respect was paid to this distinction, which was farther emphasized<br/>
by the physical <span style="color: #ff0000;">iliffterenees </span>of the two regions.<br/>
