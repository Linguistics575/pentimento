<span>184 UPPER EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
Visitors to the temples and tombs of Upper Egypt and Nubia<br/>
should be provided with a GENERAL ADMISSION TICKET, which may<br/>
be obtained (price <span style="color: #0000FF;">£ </span>1E) at the Museum of Gizeh (p. 78) or at<br/>
any of the tourist-agents' offices in Cairo. Travellers who intend to<br/>
visit Luxor only may obtain tickets for <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN.</span>, valid for the ruins at<br/>
Thebes alone.<br/>
<br/>
The ordinary traveller, desiring to visit only the principal points<br/>
of interest, may ascend the valley of the Nile either by railway or<br/>
by steamboat. By RAILWAY not less than 8 or <span style="color: #0000FF;">10 </span>days are required<br/>
for a visit to Abydos, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dendera</span>, Thebes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aswan</span>. Those<br/>
who use the <span style="color: #0000FF;">STEAMBOATS</span>, which spend 3 or 4 weeks on the voyage,<br/>
enjoy a much more thorough survey of these points; while the<br/>
voyage on the Nile has so many <span style="color: #0000FF;">attractions </span>of its own that even the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hurried </span>traveller should make a point of proceeding by river<br/>
at least between Luxor and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin</span>. All are strongly recommended<br/>
to time their <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey </span>so as to arrive at Luxor 3 or 4 days before full<br/>
moon; for moonlight adds a peculiar charm to a visit to the ruins<br/>
there and at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin</span>. It is as well for the independent traveller to<br/>
avoid as far as possible coming into contact with the large parties<br/>
organized by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tourist-agents</span>, for circumstances are apt to arise in<br/>
which he is pushed to the wall, without any redress.<br/>
<br/>
The most attractive, but also the most expensive, method of<br/>
ascending the Nile is by <span style="color: #0000FF;">DAHABiYEH </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">187</span>). Vessels with 4-25<br/>
berths may be hired at Cairo. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">steam-dahabiyehs </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">steamlaunches </span>are not much slower than the large <span style="color: #0000FF;">tourist-steamers</span>, but<br/>
in a sailing <span style="color: #0000FF;">dab </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">abiyeh</span>, which has to be towed upstream when the<br/>
wind is <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable</span>, not less than 2 or 3 months must be allowed<br/>
for the voyage to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">back</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i<br/>
<br/>
</span>Railway. Quitting Cairo by the night-express (<span style="color: #ff0000;">sleeping-cars</span>),<br/>
we reach <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beliéneh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>217) next morning, and ride thence on donkeyback to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos </span>(p. 218). Provisions for this expedition must be<br/>
brought from Cairo. We have <span style="color: #ff0000;">suffi0ient </span>time to explore the ruins<br/>
at Abydos before catching the evening-train for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luror </span>(p.233). At<br/>
least four days should be devoted to an inspection of the temples<br/>
and tombs at Thebes. On leaving Luxor we may either stop over a<br/>
train at Edfu (p. 314) or proceed straight through to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aswan </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>327),<br/>
where not less than two days should be spent. Edfu<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>however, may<br/>
equally well be visited on the return-journey, as a night <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>in<br/>
any case be spent at Luxor. We leave Luxor on our return by the<br/>
first morning-train and break the journey at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Keneh </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">226</span>), whence<br/>
we ride to the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dendem </span>(p. 226). Provisions must <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>brought from Luxor for this expedition. From Keneh we go on to<br/>
Cairo by the North express.<br/>
<br/>
The railway may be utilized for other <span style="color: #0000FF;">excursions </span>by travellers who<br/>
are to some extent familiar with the customs and language of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">country</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The nights may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">spent </span>in the station <span style="color: #0000FF;">waiting-rooms </span>(with <span style="color: #0000FF;">permission<br/>
<br/>
</span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">station-master</span>) or at the houses of the local <span style="color: #0000FF;">prefects </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cthndel0</span>.<br/>
Warm rugs, a camp-bed (if possible), and provisions (preserved <span style="color: #ff0000;">meats</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
