The rear-wall of this great vestibule forms the facade of the<br/>
temple proper; it is surmounted by a hollow cornice and a round<br/>
moulding. In the centre is a door leading to the<br/>
Hypostyle Ball, the roof of which is supported by six columns,<br/>
with elaborate foliage -capitals on which heads of Hathor also<br/>
appear. The base and lowest two drums of each column are of<br/>
granite, the remainder of sandstone. Eight square apertures in the<br/>
ceiling admit the light. Four rows of reliefs on the walls exhibit<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">isacrifieing </span>to the gods of Dendera or celebrating sacred<br/>
rites. In this and all the following rooms of the temple, with the<br/>
exception of the second storeroom to the left of this hall and the<br/>
Crypts (p. 229), the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>of the king are left empty, probably<br/>
because the priests were in doubt as to which ruler should be<br/>
selected for honour in the unsettled times during which the temple<br/>
was built.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the Beliefs in the lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">rdw</span>, representing the ceremonies<br/>
performed <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the king at the foundation of a temple, deserve notice. To<br/>
the right of the Entrance (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. tr): the king, wearing the crown of Lower<br/>
Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>quits his palace, preceded by <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>priest offering <span style="color: #0000FF;">incense</span>; to the left<br/>
the king cleaves the earth with a hoe on the site of the temple - turns<br/>
the first sod, as we should express <span style="color: #ff0000;">it</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">front </span>of him is the goddess<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Haihor</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>To the left of the Entrance (P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">O</span>: the king, with the crown<br/>
of Upper Egypt, quits his palace (as above); to the right he presents<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>with bricks, representing the <span style="color: #ff0000;">huilding-material </span>for the new temple.<br/>
<br/>
On each side of this hall are three Chambers, used as laboratory,<br/>
treasury, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">storerooms </span>for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>incense, etc. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>and representations show the Pharaoh in presence of<br/>
Hathor, the lion-headed Horus of Dendera, and other gods.<br/>
<br/>
We next enter the FIRST <span style="color: #0000FF;">ANTECHAMBER</span>, which is lighted by<br/>
apertures in the roof and walls, and is decorated with four rows of<br/>
mural reliefs. The latter represent the king worshipping, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc</span>.<br/>
in presence of Hathor and the other deities of Dendera. To the<br/>
right and left are passages<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>leading to the staircases which ascend<br/>
to the roof of the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>230). On the left also is a small<br/>
chamber probably used for some religious rite.<br/>
<br/>
The SECOND <span style="color: #0000FF;">ANTECHAMBER</span>, which we next enter, is lighted<br/>
by means of apertures in the side-walls, and has four rows of representations on the walls. A door to the left opens into a room<br/>
used as a Wardrobe, in which perfumes were preserved as well as<br/>
the sacred wreaths and garments with which the images of the gods<br/>
were embellished at festivals.<br/>
<br/>
The corresponding door on the right side of the hall leads to<br/>
three connected Rooms, which to a certain extent form a special<br/>
<br/>
