<span>332 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">yo</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ASS </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I'AN</span>. Rec ]: Tombs.<br/>
<br/>
On the W. bank, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine</span>, rises <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hill</span>, crowned<br/>
with the tomb of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shekh</span>, in which are excavated the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Rock </span>Tombs<br/>
of the princes and grandees of Elephantine. These, most of which<br/>
were opened in 1885-86 by Sir <span style="color: #0000FF;">F. </span>Grenfell, date from the close of<br/>
the Ancient Empire and from the Middle Empire and are <span style="color: #ff0000;">therefore</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>contemporary with the tombs at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Benihasan</span>, which they resemble<br/>
both in construction and decoration. The more important tombs<br/>
are now kept closed. Tickets should not be <span style="color: #0000FF;">forgotten</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We cross the river in a small boat (there and back, 5 pias. each<br/>
person). From the landing-place we ascend a sandy path, which<br/>
reaches the top at Tomb 31. The ancient staircase, hewn in the<br/>
rock and consisting of two parallel <span style="color: #0000FF;">flights </span>of about 85 steps, with an<br/>
inclined plane between them up which the sarcophagi were drawn,<br/>
is now covered by the sand. The view from the tombs is <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We begin with Tomb No. 25, belonging to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mekhu</span>. This dates<br/>
from the 6th Dyn.; and both its construction and decoration are<br/>
somewhat <span style="color: #0000FF;">article </span>It contains 18 somewhat roughly worked columns<br/>
in 3 rows. Between two columns opposite the entrance is a stone<br/>
table with three legs, which was perhaps used as an altar. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
rear-wall, opposite the entrance, is a door-shaped stole, within a<br/>
recess approached by steps and closed by a screen-wall. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Te-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">presentations </span>on the walls and columns show the deceased receiving<br/>
various votive gifts. To the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>entrance offerings are being<br/>
made to the deceased; to the left of this are agricultural scenes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>ploughing; harvest; asses bringing home the harvest). - <span style="color: #0000FF;">Adjoining<br/>
</span>is Tomb No. 26, belonging to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sabni</span>, son of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mekhu</span>. The remarkable entrance is divided by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">cross-beam </span>into two parts - the<br/>
door proper and a window above it<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The tomb chamber, with<br/>
14 square pillars, is of little interest. A relief on the Rear Walt<br/>
represents the deceased in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>boat, accompanied by his daughters,<br/>
hunting in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">marshes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>to the left he appears holding the <span style="color: #ff0000;">javeliu<br/>
</span>in his right hand and the slain birds in his left; to the right he<br/>
appears harpooning two <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish </span>at a blow; in the middle is <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">papyrusthicket </span>with birds hovering about it.<br/>
<br/>
Climbing up to the right (N) from this tomb, we pass several<br/>
others (Nos. 27, 29, 30) <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are sanded <span style="color: #0000FF;">up</span>, and reach<br/>
No. 28, that <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Heka-yeb </span>(locked). In the small chamber is a<br/>
representation of the deceased as a negro, with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dark-brown </span>skin.<br/>
- Farther <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*No</span>. 31, the fine tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bi-renpowet</span>, son of Satet-hotep, and a<br/>
prince under <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemh√©t </span>II. Beyond a narrow Passage follow a Hall<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>square columns (without decoration) and then <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Corridor<br/>
(locked) with three recesses on each side. Each of these recesses<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">contains </span>a statue of the deceased in the guise <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Osiris mummy.<br/>
Before the first on the left side appears the deceased followed by<br/>
his son. At the end of the corridor is a small Hall, with four pillars, on each of which "<span style="color: #0000FF;">TIES </span>dividing the<br/>
<br/>
