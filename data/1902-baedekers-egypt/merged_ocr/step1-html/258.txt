Barbers' (P1. a), because the students used to have their heads shaved<br/>
here. To the right of this gateway is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mesgid </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ta'ibarsiyeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">T</span>),<br/>
with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mihrab</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">prayer-reoess</span>, of 1309, and to the<br/>
left are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">offiee </span>of the steward <span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">J</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, in a restored mausoleum,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ziiwiyet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eL-0tisrlgwtyee </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, now used as a library.<br/>
<br/>
The long archway, ending in a portal added by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kim </span>Bey (by<br/>
whom the adjacent minaret was also built), leads directly into the<br/>
large Salm el- <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gdmi'a</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosque-court</span>, enclosed by an arcade<br/>
(restored), with Persian <span style="color: #0000FF;">keel-arches</span>, niches, medallions, and openwork pinnacles.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sanctuary</span>, with its nine aisles, now forming the principal<br/>
hall of instruction, has 140 marble columns <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">100 </span>antique) and covers<br/>
an area of about 3600 sq. yds. The front <span style="color: #0000FF;">aud-older </span>part is low in<br/>
the ceiling. The part at the back, to Which we ascend by a few<br/>
steps, has considerably higher arcades, restored a few years ago.<br/>
The hall is imperfectly lighted. A staircase to the right of'Abd<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">er-Rahmtm</span>'s pulpit (<span style="color: #0000FF;">mimbar</span>) ascends to an upper story, Which is<br/>
assigned to students from Mecca and Yemen. On the S. side is the<br/>
Tomb of'Abd <span style="color: #0000FF;">er-Ral.untm </span>(Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F</span>). The N. side is bounded by the<br/>
very elegant little mosque of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ztrwiyet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gthargtyeh </span>(Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">9</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, recently<br/>
restored.<br/>
<br/>
The ceilings of the Northern and of the Southern <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ltunn </span>are<br/>
supported by double <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>. The N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Liwan </span>is adjoined by the<br/>
Court of Ablutions (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It</span>), with a square basin in the centre.<br/>
<br/>
The Lateral <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iittoiine </span>and many of the subsidiary buildings of<br/>
the mosque are divided by partitions or railings into <span style="color: #ff0000;">Riwzika</span>, or<br/>
separate chambers (literally, <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. Each <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>these is set apart<br/>
for the use of the natives of a particular country, or of a particular<br/>
province of Egypt (comp. the Plan and its reference numbers 12-22,<br/>
p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">44 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. Most of the students are natives of Egypt, so that the<br/>
Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">riwahs </span>(Upper Egypt, Lower Egypt, Eastern <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>are<br/>
the largest, each having several hundred students. About twenty<br/>
years ago the total number of students was 7600-7700, taught by<br/>
230 professors; but since the British occupation the numbers have<br/>
sensibly diminished, especially as no students now come from the<br/>
former equatorial provinces of Egypt. The university of Cairo is,<br/>
however, still the largest in the domain of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and at the last<br/>
census the mosque was occupied by 6923 souls. - The nationality<br/>
of the various groups of students'may be learned from the guide.<br/>
This being one of the fountain-heads of Mohammedan fanaticism,<br/>
the traveller should, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">course</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>throughout <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>visit, be careful <span style="color: #0000FF;">not<br/>
</span>to indulge openly in any gestures of amusement or contempt.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">STUDENTS </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mugdm'rin</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">usually </span>remain three, and sometimes from<br/>
four to six years in the mosque. They pay no fees, but each <span style="color: #ff0000;">riwalg </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">supported </span>by an annual subsidy from the endowments of the mosque. There<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">also </span>a separate <span style="color: #ff0000;">riwalg</span>, called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zdwiyet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wr0mpiin</span>, for blind students,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>whose maintenance a portion of the funds is set apart. - The <span style="color: #0000FF;">PROFESSORS</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shims</span>, receive no salary, either from the mosque or from<br/>
government, but support themselves by teaching in private houses, by<br/>
