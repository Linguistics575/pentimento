the synagogues and expelled the Jews <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the city; and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">41.5<br/>
</span>the learned and beautiful pagan Hypatia, daughter of the mathematician Theon, was cruelly murdered by an infuriated crowd.<br/>
Under Justinian (527-565) all the still existing heathen schools<br/>
were <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span>closed.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>619 Alexandria was captured by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chosroes</span>, King <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Persia,<br/>
but the Christians were left <span style="color: #0000FF;">unmolested</span>. Ten years later <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heraclius<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded </span>in recovering possession of Egypt, but the troops of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Khalif'Omar </span>soon afterwards invaded the country and <span style="color: #ff0000;">tookAlexaydria </span>after a prolonged siege. In December, <span style="color: #0000FF;">641</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amr </span>Ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-N</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Omar</span>'s general, entered the city; but by order of his master, he<br/>
treated the inhabitants with moderation. The decline of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>now became rapid in the same proportion as the growing<br/>
prosperity of the newly-founded capital on the Nile, the modern<br/>
Cairo, and its commerce received a death-blow by the discovery<br/>
of America and of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-route </span>to India round the Cape of Good<br/>
Hope.<br/>
<br/>
The decay of the once powerful seaport, which contained only<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">5000inhaty</span>. in 1800, was at length effectually arrested by the<br/>
vigorous hand of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammad </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Uti </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">xcix</span>), who improved the <span style="color: #0000FF;">harbours </span>and constructed several canals. The chief benefit he <span style="color: #0000FF;">con-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ferred </span>on Alexandria was the construction of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Afaljmildtyeh<br/>
</span>Canal (begun in 1819), which was so named after <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>reigning<br/>
Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mabrnt1d</span>. By means of this channel the adjoining <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields<br/>
</span>were irrigated anew, and Alexandria was again connected with the<br/>
Nile and the rest of Egypt, the products of which had long found<br/>
their only outlets through the Rosetta and Damietta mouths of the<br/>
river. The subsequent <span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroys </span>also made great efforts to improve<br/>
the position of the to <span style="color: #0000FF;">HI</span>. The town suffered severely during Arabi's<br/>
rising in <span style="color: #0000FF;">18820. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cii</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, and a great part of the European quarter<br/>
was laid in ashes; but the traces of this misfortune have disappeared, and the town is distinctly prosperous in spite of the recent<br/>
rivalry of Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id </span>(comp. p. 168)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

</span>2. MODERN ALEXANDRIA.<br/>
<br/>
The great centre of European life is the Place <span style="color: #ff0000;">Méhémet </span>Ali<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. F, <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, about 575 paces long and 100 paces broad, which is<br/>
embellished with trees. In the centre rises the Equestrian Statue of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">M </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oliammed'Ali </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i </span>see above), <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">founder </span>of the reigning dynasty<br/>
of Egypt, designed by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jaquemart</span>, and cast in Paris. The statue is<br/>
16 ft. in height, and stands on a pedestal of Tuscan marble 20 ft.<br/>
in height. This square was the principal scene of destruction in<br/>
1882. It is once more surrounded by handsome new buildings. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>the N.E. side stands the English Church, adjoined by <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>Mark's<br/>
Building, belonging to the British community and used as a school<br/>
and for <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>purposes; on the E. side is the Exchange, on the<br/>
