to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">left </span>and runs mostly along the edge of ditches, frequented, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially<br/>
</span>in December, by wild fowl.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">IEedamirt</span>, dedicated to the war-god Mont, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>situated<br/>
in the N. suburb of Thebes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mate</span>. The erection of this temple dates<br/>
from the time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, of the 18th Dynasty. His name occurs<br/>
on the large granite pillars <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are still standing and which probably<br/>
formed part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sanctuary</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">letter </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>adjoined by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tsi1ifiee</span>,<br/>
lying approximately from E. to <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>Much <span style="color: #0000FF;">farther </span>to the W. was a Pylon,<br/>
facing the river, but now destroyed; it was built by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethos </span>I. and Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL<br/>
</span>Under the Ptolemies an addition was made to the earlier temple, including<br/>
the five columns, which are now the most conspicuous and most interesting feature of the ruins. These belonged to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span>covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>. Between<br/>
the two clustered columns with <span style="color: #ff0000;">ea1yweapitals </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>a door, with inscriptions<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and Neos Dionysus. The two clustered columns with <span style="color: #0000FF;">bud..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">capitals </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifth </span>isolated column probably belonged to the original<br/>
temple of the Middle Empire and were afterwards incorporated in the<br/>
rebuilding during the Ptolemaic period.<br/>
<br/>
B. THE WEST BANK AT THEBES.<br/>
<br/>
An early start should be made. Guides, Donkeys, <span style="color: #0000FF;">us</span>, see p. 233. Luncheon should be taken. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">ferry-boat </span>plies from the two chief hotels at<br/>
Luxor to the W. bank (there and back <span style="color: #0000FF;">Iso</span>. Donkeys are usually found<br/>
on the W. bank, but a large party is recommended to order them the<br/>
night before.<br/>
<br/>
On the West Bank lay the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis</span>, or City of the Dead, and<br/>
also a large number <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">temples</span>. These latter, dating mostly from<br/>
the New Empire, were dedicated to Ammon, the principal deity of<br/>
Thebes, and were also used in the worship of deceased kings<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>They<br/>
were adjoined by dwellings for the priests, libraries, and sometimes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">schools</span>. In the vicinity were groves and lakes, besides granaries,<br/>
stables for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ssaerifieial </span>animals, barracks for the guards, prisons,<br/>
etc. Close by lay villages inhabited by the numerous workmen<br/>
who found employment in connection with the cemeteries: masons,<br/>
painters, builders, and above all <span style="color: #0000FF;">embalmers</span>, to whose care <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bodies<br/>
</span>were <span style="color: #0000FF;">Committed</span>. Gradually a whole city arose here, like the quarters<br/>
beside the tombs of the Mamelukes at Cairo. Under the New Empire its management was placed in the hands of a special <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieial</span>,<br/>
known <span style="color: #0000FF;">as'prince </span>of the West and director of the workers at the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Neeropolis</span>'.<br/>
<br/>
3. The Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kurna</span>.<br/>
<br/>
From the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place </span>of the boat on the W. bank we ride first<br/>
in a westerly, then in a northerly direction, and in 3/4 hr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">reach<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Temple </span>of Sethos L, the front of which with its columns is<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
