<span>HISTORY OF ART. <span style="color: #0000FF;">cxliii<br/>

</span>to the sky, which was conceived of as a thin flat covering held<br/>
above the earth by supports; and it was appropriately adorned with<br/>
stars upon a blue ground, while above the middle passage hovered<br/>
vultures, protecting the king as he passed along below. Not <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfrequently</span>, and especially in the temples of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemaio </span>period,<br/>
the ceiling presented a picture of the entire celestial pantheon the gods and goddesses of the mouths and days, the planets, various<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">constellations</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the goddess of the sky herself, on whose body<br/>
rested the boat of the sun. Similarly the pavement represented<br/>
the earth. Here (<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. on the bottom of the walls) we see flowers<br/>
blooming or long processions of the representatives of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">names<br/>
</span>and other divisions of the country, and of the river and <span style="color: #0000FF;">canals</span>,<br/>
bringing their characteristic products as offerings to the deities<br/>
of the temple. Egypt was traditionally regarded as divided into<br/>
two portions - a northern and a southern - and similarly the<br/>
entire world as represented in the temple was also regarded as consisting of a N. half (to the right) and a S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">half </span>(to the left). The<br/>
representatives of the N. appear on one side, those of the S. on the<br/>
other; and even in the ceremonial religious scenes on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls<br/>
</span>this distinction may frequently be traced. The entire <span style="color: #ff0000;">temple-precinots </span>were enclosed by a brick wall, the portal of which (generally<br/>
a pylon) was approached by an avenue of sphinxes or (<span style="color: #ff0000;">e.g</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>in Thebes)<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>recumbent rams (krio-sphinxes). Within this wall stood also the<br/>
dwellings of the priests, besides storehouses and stables, so that<br/>
the temple proper, like an Arab mosque of to-day, stood in the<br/>
midst of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">complexus </span>of domestic buildings.<br/>
<br/>
Owing to the great value of cultivable land in Egypt, Tombs<br/>
were not placed in the lower portions of the Nile valley, but in the<br/>
more elevated desert-regions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>moreover, being beyond the<br/>
reach of the inundation, were in any case better adapted for the<br/>
preservation of the dead. The most ancient graves were probably<br/>
simple holes, in which the mummies were laid, and over which<br/>
heaps of stones were piled by way of monument. Under the ANCIENT<br/>
EMPIRE these piles of stones were <span style="color: #0000FF;">replaced </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the case of the<br/>
tombs of the wealthy at least - by <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Maslabas</span>, which were<br/>
strong erections of limestone blocks or of bricks, with a rectangular<br/>
ground-plan and sloping walls. These originally consisted of a<br/>
single chamber only, regarded as the dwelling of the deceased and<br/>
inaccessible from without<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A door-shaped stone or Stale, set in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>shallow recess on the E. side, marked the spot that was regarded<br/>
as the entrance to the grave and to the realm of the dead. In front<br/>
of this the surviving relatives laid the food, drink, and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>to the dead upon the flat <span style="color: #ff0000;">flaeriiieiat </span>Table, or recited their prayers for the welfare of the departed. Under and after the 4th Dyn.<br/>
the chamber was made accessible from without, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stele </span>was<br/>
removed to the W. side. In the time of the 5th Dyn. the inner<br/>
chamber was enlarged and a number of additional rooms added. The<br/>
