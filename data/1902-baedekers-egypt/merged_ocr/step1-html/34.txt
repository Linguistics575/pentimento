demands of modern science as a sanatorium in regard to site, construction, ventilation, and other requirements.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Menu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Home </span>Hotel (p. 25), <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>M. to the W. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo</span>, stands <span style="color: #0000FF;">neat<br/>
</span>the N. side of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, on the verge of the<br/>
Libyan Desert. The mean maximum temperature is <span style="color: #0000FF;">690 </span>in Dec.,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">MP </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jam</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">720 </span>in Feb., <span style="color: #0000FF;">740 </span>in March, and 800 in April. The<br/>
mean minimum for the four months <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dee</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>to April is <span style="color: #0000FF;">500</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The<br/>
relative humidity (<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. the amount of moisture, in relation to the<br/>
temperature at the time, that the air holds out of a possible 100 per<br/>
cent) from Dee. to March is 58 per cent by day (8 a. m. to 6 <span style="color: #ff0000;">p</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">In</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>)<br/>
and 80 per cent at night (8 p. m. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>a. m.). Dew falls in winter<br/>
on about two nights out of three. At both Mena House and Helwan<br/>
the prevailing winds and the amount of <span style="color: #ff0000;">rtin </span>are probably <span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>same as in Cairo. The purity of the air at both places is <span style="color: #0000FF;">marked</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_<br/>
</span>The medical and sanitary arrangements are excellent; and there is a<br/>
resident nurse under the orders of the physician who resides there.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Helwdn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IM</span>), 15 M. to the S. of Cairo and 11/2 M. from the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cultivated </span>land, is <span style="color: #ff0000;">115ft</span>. above the river. The mean maximum<br/>
temperature is <span style="color: #0000FF;">700 </span>in Dec., <span style="color: #0000FF;">670 </span>in Jan., <span style="color: #0000FF;">73</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>in Feb., and <span style="color: #ff0000;">76° </span>in<br/>
March. The mean minimum for these four months is 50°. The<br/>
daily range of temperature is <span style="color: #0000FF;">2C</span>. Dew rarely falls. The relative<br/>
humidity from Dee. to March is <span style="color: #0000FF;">47 </span>per cent by day, 66 per cent at<br/>
night. - Helwan has the advantage of being in the desert in a pure<br/>
atmosphere. It also has warm natural springs of three kinds: viz.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sulphureted</span>, carbonated iron, and saline water, each of <span style="color: #ff0000;">which </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">is<br/>
</span>richer in natural constituents than the corresponding springs at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aixles-Bains</span>, Harrogate, Buxton, etc. The cases suitable for the baths<br/>
here are such as would derive benefit from <span style="color: #0000FF;">hydrotherapeutic </span>treatment as carried on at Harrogate, Bath, Aix, etc. A large <span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span>Bath<br/>
Establishment has been erected. Two English physicians and a<br/>
trained English nurse are resident at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helwan</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Luxor (p. 233) is situated about 450 M. to the S. of Cairo, in<br/>
the Theban plain and on the right bank of the river. The prevailing<br/>
winds are <span style="color: #ff0000;">N.W- </span>and N., but the force of the wind is probably less<br/>
than at any of the other stations in Egypt. The mean maximum<br/>
temperature is <span style="color: #ff0000;">76° </span>in Dec., <span style="color: #0000FF;">74° </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Jam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">780 </span>in Feb., and <span style="color: #0000FF;">850 </span>in<br/>
March. The mean minimum for these four months is <span style="color: #0000FF;">50°</span>. The<br/>
relative humidity is 41 per cent by day, 64 per cent at night. Dew<br/>
falls about every third night in Jan.; it rarely falls in other months.<br/>
In the W. Desert near Luxor dew very rarely falls, and the mean of<br/>
the relative humidity for the four months is 43 per cent only, day<br/>
and night. - In addition to the advantage of its warm and dry <span style="color: #ff0000;">elimate</span>, with less wind than other stations, Luxor has an almost inexhaustible interest in its numerous antiquities, temples, and tombs<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
