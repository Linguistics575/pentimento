<span>Copts. THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. <span style="color: #ff0000;">xli<br/>
<br/>
</span>hopes, however, were doomed to bitter disappointment, and their<br/>
national pride to utter humiliation. Their conquerors succeeded in<br/>
maintaining their position, and though apparently at first inclined<br/>
to moderation, were at length driven by the conduct and the previous<br/>
example of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">00pts </span>themselves to persecute and oppress them to<br/>
the uttermost.<br/>
<br/>
In spite, however, of all these disasters, a numerous community<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gspts </span>has always existed in Egypt, a fact <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is mainly to be<br/>
accounted for by the remarkable tenacity and constancy of the<br/>
Egyptian character. Owing, however, to the continual <span style="color: #0000FF;">oppression </span>and contempt to which they have been subjected, the grave<br/>
disposition of the subjects of the Pharaohs has degenerated into<br/>
sullen gloom, and their industry into cupidity. The rancour Which<br/>
they have so long cherished has embittered their character, while<br/>
the persecutions they have suffered have taught them to be at one<br/>
time cringing, and at another arrogant and overbearing. They are<br/>
in very few respects superior to their Mohammedan countrymen.<br/>
They generally possess a hereditary aptitude for mathematical<br/>
science, and are therefore in great request as book-keepers and<br/>
accountants, but on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hand </span>they are entirely destitute of the<br/>
generous and dignified disposition of the Arabs. They obey their<br/>
law which forbids polygamy, but constantly abuse that which permits them to indulge in spirituous liquors, drunkards being <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently </span>met with, even among their priests. Their divine worship<br/>
will strike the traveller as strange, and anything but edifying <span style="color: #0000FF;">01'<br/>
</span>elevating (comp. p. 71).<br/>
<br/>
The traveller may distinguish the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabs </span>by their<br/>
dark turbans, which are generally blue or <span style="color: #0000FF;">black</span>, and their <span style="color: #ff0000;">darkcoloured </span>clothes. This costume was originally prescribed by their<br/>
oppressors, and they still take a pride in it as a mark of their origin,<br/>
though now permitted to dress as they please. A practised eye will<br/>
also frequently detect among them the ancient Egyptian cast of<br/>
features. Towards strangers the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Copt </span>is externally obliging, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>anxious to secure their favour he not unfrequently appeals to<br/>
his Christian creed as a bond of union. Many <span style="color: #ff0000;">00pts </span>have recently<br/>
been converted to Protestantism by American missionaries, <span style="color: #ff0000;">partieularly </span>in Upper Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>through the foundation of good<br/>
schools and the distribution of cheap Arabic Bibles. Even the<br/>
orthodox Copts have a great reverence for the sacred volume, and it<br/>
is not uncommon to meet with members of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">seat </span>who know the<br/>
whole of the Gospels by heart. The Roman propaganda, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>begun by Franciscans at the end of the 17th and beginning of the<br/>
18th <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>, has been less successful among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts</span>. There are,<br/>
however, a few small Roman Catholic communities in Upper Egypt<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Girgeh, Akhmim, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nufule10</span>, forming <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thureh </span>of the<br/>
Catholic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gspts</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span>patriarch at Alexandria, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cyrillos </span>IL, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bonsecrated </span>in 1899, is a native <span style="color: #ff0000;">Capt</span>.
