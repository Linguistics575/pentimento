may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>obtained, when we learn that, <span style="color: #0000FF;">according </span>to Prof. Flinders<br/>
Petrie's calculation, about 2,300,000 separate blocks of stone, each<br/>
containing 40 cubic ft., were required for the Pyramid of Kheops,<br/>
and that nearly all were quarried on the E. bank of the Nile and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>to be conveyed through the plain to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">desert-plateau</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Construction </span>of the Pyramids has been admirably described<br/>
by Herodotus, the earliest writer on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">subject</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>who visited Egypt<br/>
<br/>
about <span style="color: #0000FF;">170-h60 </span>BA).<br/>
<br/>
Herodotus states (<span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>125) that'there were about 100,000 men employed<br/>
annually for three months in constructing the Great Pyramid of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheops </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">f.<br/>
</span>They first made the <span style="color: #0000FF;">road </span>for the transport of the stones from the Nile<br/>
to the Libyan Mts.; <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the length of the road <span style="color: #0000FF;">amounts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>five stadia<br/>
(1017 yds.), its breadth is ten <span style="color: #0000FF;">fathoms </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">ro </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>), and its height, at the<br/>
highest <span style="color: #0000FF;">places</span>, is eight fathoms (48 ft.), and it is constructed entirely of<br/>
polished stone with figures engraved on <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>H. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ten </span>years were thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">consumed </span>in making this road and the subterranean <span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers </span>(for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins</span>).<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>of the Pyramid itself <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupied </span>twenty years. Each <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the four sides measures eight <span style="color: #0000FF;">plethra </span>(820 ft.), and the height is the<br/>
same. It is covered with polished stones, well jointed, none of which is<br/>
less than thirty feet long. This pyramid was first built in the form ofa<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">flight </span>of steps. After the workmen <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>completed the pyramid in this<br/>
form<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>they raised the other stones (used for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation</span>) by means<br/>
of machines, made of <span style="color: #0000FF;">short </span>beams, from the ground of the first tier of<br/>
steps; and after the stone was placed there it was raised to the second<br/>
tier by another machine; <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>there were as many machines as there were<br/>
tiers of steps; or perhaps the same machine, if it was easily moved, was<br/>
raised from one tier to the other, as it was required <span style="color: #ff0000;">forlifting </span>the stones.<br/>
The highest part of the pyramid was thus finished first <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>by smoothing),<br/>
the parts adjoining it were taken next, and the lowest part, next to the<br/>
earth, was completed last. It was recorded on the pyramid, in Egyptian<br/>
writing, how many <span style="color: #0000FF;">radishes</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">unions</span>, and roots of garlic had been distributed <span style="color: #0000FF;">among </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">workmen</span>, and ifl rightly remember what the interpreter<br/>
who read the <span style="color: #0000FF;">writing </span>told <span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fft</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">muney </span>they cost amounted <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sixteen </span>hundred talents of silver (upwards of <span style="color: #0000FF;">350</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">COOL</span>). If this was really<br/>
the case, how much <span style="color: #0000FF;">mere </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>then have <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>spent on the iron with<br/>
which they worked, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>on the food and clothing of the workmen<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>'<br/>
<br/>
In modern times many eager discussions have been held as to<br/>
the mode in which the Pyramids were erected and the meaning of<br/>
the account given by Herodotus<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The most important questions<br/>
seem to be: <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">f</span>) How could Kheops, when he ascended the throne<br/>
and chose an area of 82,000 sq. yards for his monument, know<br/>
that his reign would be so unusually long as to enable him to complete it? <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>2) If one of the builders of the great pyramids had died<br/>
<br/>
+ <span style="color: #0000FF;">According </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>Prof. Flinders Petrie, these three months fell during the<br/>
inundation, when field-work was at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stand-still </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>services <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">100,000<br/>
</span>men for <span style="color: #0000FF;">transporting </span>the stones could be easily <span style="color: #0000FF;">enough </span>obtained. The<br/>
stone cutters and masons were <span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span>engaged all the year round in<br/>
the quarries and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the pyramid itself.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>This route is still <span style="color: #0000FF;">traceable</span>. It terminated on the E. side of the<br/>
Pyramid of Kheops (see Plan and p. 127).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fff </span>It is unlikely that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>interpreters<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>who attended <span style="color: #0000FF;">travellers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">like </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dragomans </span>of the present day, were able to read <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span>. They<br/>
probably repeated mere popular traditions regarding the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pyramids </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>other <span style="color: #0000FF;">monuments</span>, with embellishments <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">exaggerations </span>of their own.<br/>
