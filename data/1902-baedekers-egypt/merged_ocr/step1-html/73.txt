<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Islam </span>is the most widely spread religion in the world, and<br/>
has not yet ceased to spread.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mol1arnmedi</span>, as a religious teacher, took <span style="color: #0000FF;">up </span>a position hostile<br/>
to the'age of ignorance and folly', as he called heathenism. The<br/>
revelation which he believed it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>his mission to impart was,<br/>
<br/>
+ Mohammed ('the praised', or'to be praised') was a scion on the<br/>
paternal side of the family of Hashim, a less important branch of the<br/>
noble family <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kureish</span>, who were settled at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mecca</span>, and were custodians<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ka'ba</span>. His father'Abdallah died shortly before his birth (about<br/>
570). In his sixth year his mother <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amine</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>took him on ajourney to<br/>
Medina, but died on her way home. The boy was then educated by his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">grandfather </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rAbd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Nuttall</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, and, after the death of the latter two years<br/>
later, by his uncle Abu <span style="color: #0000FF;">Talib</span>. For several years Mohammed tended<br/>
sheep. He afterwards undertook commercial journeys, at first in company<br/>
with his uncle, and then<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>when about <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>years of age, in the<br/>
service of the widow Khadija, who became his first wife. On one of these<br/>
journeys he is said to have become acquainted with the Christian monk<br/>
Bahira at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bosra</span>.<br/>
<br/>
About that period a reaction in the religious life of the Arabs had<br/>
set in, and when Mohammed was about forty years of age he too was<br/>
struck with the vanity of idolatry. He suffered <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>epilepsy, and during<br/>
his attacks imagined he received revelations from heaven. He can scarcely,<br/>
therefore, be called an impostor in the ordinary sense. A dream which<br/>
he had on Mt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hint</span>, near Mecca, gave him the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>impulse, and he soon<br/>
began with ardent enthusiasm to promulgate <span style="color: #0000FF;">monotheism</span>, and to warn<br/>
his hearers against incurring the pains of hell. It is uncertain whether<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammad </span>himself could read and write. His new doctrine was called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Islam</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>subjection to God. At first he made converts in his own family<br/>
only, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Muslims</span>' were persecuted by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Meccans</span>. Many of them,<br/>
and at length <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohemmed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">himself </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>622), accordingly emigrated to Medina,<br/>
where the new religion made great progress. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alter </span>the death of Khadija,<br/>
Mohammed took several other wives, partly from political motives.<br/>
<br/>
He now <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to stir up the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meeeans</span>, and war broke out in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">consequence</span>. He was victorious at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beth</span>, but lost the battle of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uhud</span>.<br/>
His military campaigns were thenceforth incessant. He obtained great<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>over the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>, and succeeded in uniting them politically.<br/>
In 630 the Muslims at length captured the town of Mecca, and the idols<br/>
in it were destroyed. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moltammed</span>'s health, however, had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">completely<br/>
</span>undermined by his unremitting exertions for about twenty-four years;<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>died on 8th June, 632, at Medina, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>interred there.<br/>
