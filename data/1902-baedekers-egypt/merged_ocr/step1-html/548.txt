<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">WALLS </span>of the tombs, from the entrance to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">final </span>chamber,<br/>
were covered with sacred pictures and texts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>knowledge of which was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">essentiel </span>for the deceased in the future life. The prevailing conception<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Biban <span style="color: #0000FF;">e1-Mul1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1k </span>was that the deceased king, accompanied by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun </span><span style="color: #0000FF;"><<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">god </span>(or rather absorbed in the sun-god), sailed through the underworld<br/>
at night in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">boat</span>; thus those scenes and texts were preferred which<br/>
described this voyage and instructed the deceased as to the exact route.<br/>
These texts <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>taken from two books, closely related to each other.<br/>
One was called'The Book of that which is in the Underworld'. According<br/>
to this, the underworld (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Twat</span>; <span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>cxxiv) is divided into 12 regions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cor<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">responding </span>to the 12 hours of night; and the descriptions in the book<br/>
were therefore likewise in 12 chapters. In each of these the river with<br/>
the boat of the sun <span style="color: #0000FF;">floating </span>on it is represented in the middle; in the<br/>
boat stands the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mun-headed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god</span>, surrounded by his retinue, and<br/>
bringing for a short time light and life to the regions he traverses. Above<br/>
and below are shown the two banks of the river, thronged by all manner<br/>
of spirits, <span style="color: #0000FF;">daemons</span>, and monsters, which greet the sun and ward <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>his<br/>
enemies.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>book, known as the'Book <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Portals', reproduces the<br/>
same conceptions. The nocturnal journey of the sun through the 12 <span style="color: #0000FF;">regions </span>of the underworld is again represented, and, as in the first book,<br/>
these regions are conceived of as provinces or <span style="color: #0000FF;">names</span>. Massive gates,<br/>
guarded by gigantic serpents, separate one region from another; each gate<br/>
hears a name known to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god</span>, and the deceased must know it also.<br/>
Two gods and two <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mis-spitting</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>snakes guard the approach and greet the<br/>
sun- od.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>third work, which may he called'The Sun's Journey in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Underworld</span>', contains still more gloomy and unattractive representations. The<br/>
sun-god has arrived in the underworld and addresses a speech to the<br/>
spirits and monsters, which are carefully depicted in long rows.<br/>
<br/>
Recourse was had to other works also for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">decoration </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>king's<br/>
tombs. The chief of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the'praising </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">RE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and'The </span>Book <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Opening </span>of the Mouth'. The former, which was used in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>corridors, contains a long-winded hymn to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god</span>, to be recited in the<br/>
evening as the sun entered the underworld. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span>of the hymn<br/>
the god is invoked <span style="color: #0000FF;">under'75 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>names and is depicted in as many<br/>
forms. - The <span style="color: #0000FF;">text </span>and illustrations in the second of these works teach<br/>
the multifarious ceremonies which had to be performed before the statue<br/>
of the deceased king in order to <span style="color: #0000FF;">indue </span>it with life and ensure it the use<br/>
of its Organs, so as to enable it to eat and drink in the tomb.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Expedition </span>mention H, while at present <span style="color: #0000FF;">41 </span>are accessible, on the entrances<br/>
of which their numbers are inscribed. Pausanias, Elian, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliodorus</span>,<br/>
Ammianus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Marcellinus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and other ancient authors refer to them as the<br/>
Syringes (<span style="color: #0000FF;">auty </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tee</span>) of Thebes, which name also <span style="color: #0000FF;">tenure </span>in the Greek inscriptions wit in the tombs. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">word'Syrrisc</span>' meant <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>a shepherd's<br/>
pipe formed of longish reeds, then it came to <span style="color: #0000FF;">mean </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hollow </span>passage,<br/>
and thus was applied to the long rock-hewn passages of Biban <span style="color: #ff0000;">iyl-JKu1iik</span>.<br/>
<br/>
There are two routes from the Temple of Sethos at Kuma to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Biban </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">et-Mult1k </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>donkey-ride of 3/4 hr.). The lower of these is<br/>
described below. The mountain-track <span style="color: #0000FF;">via </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Asasif </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">DÃ©r </span>el-bahri,<br/>
more fatiguing though shorter, is better followed on the return<br/>
(comp. p. 278).<br/>
<br/>
The lower route passes the spring to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>of the Temple of<br/>
Sethos, leaves the necropolis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Drah </span>Abu'l Negga (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>262) to the<br/>
left, and winds through the valley (Wadi), <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>to the N.W., then to<br/>
the W. The gorge gradually <span style="color: #0000FF;">contracts</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>between walls <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">naked </span>yellow<br/>
