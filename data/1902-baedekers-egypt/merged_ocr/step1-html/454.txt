<br/>
The VESTIBULE which formerly stood behind an open court, is<br/>
borne by two columns <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>sixteen edges and tapering <span style="color: #0000FF;">towards<br/>
</span>the top. The cornice projects considerably above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave<br/>
</span>and is ostensibly supported by <span style="color: #ff0000;">flne </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">laths </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hewn</span>, like all the rest of<br/>
the structure, out of the living rock. The resemblance of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">laths<br/>
</span>to the mutules of the Dorie order is worthy of mention.<br/>
<br/>
The TOMB CHAMBER was divided by two pairs of columns into<br/>
three slightly vaulted sections. Most of the scenes were painted on<br/>
a thin layer of stucco, with which the limestone walls were coated.<br/>
At the foot is a long inscription cut in the rock, in lines of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>greenish<br/>
colour, 21/2 ft. high, containing the above interesting excerpt from<br/>
Egyptian provincial history. In 1890 the <span style="color: #0000FF;">royal </span>names were cut out<br/>
of the rock by some vandal hand and the paintings have also <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfortunately </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s11trered </span>so much in the last 30 or <span style="color: #0000FF;">40 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">years </span>that the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">subjects </span>of some of them are now almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">indistinguishable<br/>
<br/>
</span>Entrance Wall (<span style="color: #0000FF;">W.</span>). Over the door we see the statue of the deceased<br/>
being <span style="color: #0000FF;">transported </span>to the temple, preceded by dancers in curious attitudes;<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span>into the barns, while scribes seated in a colonnaded hall register<br/>
the amounts. The next two rows show the operations of ploughing, harvesting, and threshing. Still lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">down </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-boat</span>, bearing the mummy<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deceased</span>, as the inscription <span style="color: #0000FF;">informs </span>us, to Abydos (the grave <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Osiris).<br/>
In the fifth <span style="color: #0000FF;">row </span>is a representation of the vintage and of the gathering of<br/>
figs and vegetables. The cattle in the water and the fishing scene (at the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">foot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>depict life by the river. - <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ar</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wall </span>(to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lett </span>on entering).
