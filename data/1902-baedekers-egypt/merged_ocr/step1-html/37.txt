<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cigar-smokers </span>will find it <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to become accustomed<br/>
to the Oriental tobacco, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>tolerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">cigar-shops </span>at<br/>
Alexandria and Cairo, most of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>have been established quite<br/>
recently. As a general rule smokers are recommended to carry with<br/>
them, both in going to and returning from Egypt, as little tobacco<br/>
as possible, especially if they travel by the overland route, as a<br/>
rigorous search is often made and a heavy duty exacted, both at<br/>
the Egyptian, and at the French, Austrian, and Italian frontiers.<br/>
Travellers returning to England direct, with their luggage booked<br/>
through, are allowed half-a-pound of tobacco <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>cigars free <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">English </span>duty, or they may bring three pounds on payment of the duty<br/>

Tobacco (<span style="color: #ff0000;">dukhklitin</span>) is kept in good condition by covering it with<br/>
a moist cloth, with which, however, it must not come in contact.<br/>
Strong <span style="color: #ff0000;">fldlmi</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>mild (<span style="color: #ff0000;">bdrid</span>) may be asked for according to taste.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">8tamhtlli </span>is a long and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>cut tobacco, the best qualities of which<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">U</span>) come from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roumelia </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Anatolia</span>, and the inferior from the Greek islands. The Syrian tobacco<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the stalk, is considered less drying to the palate than the Turkish.<br/>
It is of two kinds, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">.ktrthti</span>, or light-brown, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">geheli</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>or dark-brown, a mixture of which may be used. The latter, which<br/>
derives its colour from being dried in the smoke of resinous woods,<br/>
is known in Europe as'Latakia', from the region of N. Syria where<br/>
it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>grown (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Lidilsiyeh1 </span>but that name is not applied to it<br/>
in the East. The native Egyptian tobacco <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">dukhkhzin </span>beledi, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">akhdar</span>, green tobacco), now no longer grown, was of very inferior<br/>
quality. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">natives </span>used often to gather the leaves from the plant,<br/>
dry them in the sun, rub them to pieces, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>smoke them quite fresh.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tumbdk</span>, 01' Persian tobacco, is used in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>moistened condition in<br/>
the long <span style="color: #ff0000;">nargUehs </span>or water-pipes only, and is lighted with a particular kind of charcoal. The smoke of these pipes is drawn into<br/>
the lungs.<br/>
