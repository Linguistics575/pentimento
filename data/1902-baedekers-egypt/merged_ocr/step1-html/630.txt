By far the most interesting object on the island is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Nilometer</span>, beside a <span style="color: #ff0000;">stldyeh </span>on the E. side facing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assutn</span>, known to<br/>
the Arabs as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Miltyt'ts</span>. After more than a thousand years of neglect<br/>
it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>repaired and restored to use in 1870 in the reign of the<br/>
Khedive Isma'il, as is recorded by French and Arabic inscriptions.<br/>
At the top of the staircase is an inscribed block of granite. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
walls of the staircase are damaged Greek inscriptions of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">imperial </span>epoch, giving the water-levels. The scales date from the<br/>
later imperial epoch, and the ells are marked in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>and also in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Demotic</span>) characters. The new scale is inscribed on marble tablets.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>'s accurate description of this nilometer is not yet antiquated:<br/>
'The Nilometer is a well built of regular hewn stones, on the bank<br/>
of the Nile, in which is recorded the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rise </span>of the stream, not only the<br/>
maximum but also the minimum and average rise, for the water in the<br/>
well rises and falls with the stream. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the side of the well are marks,<br/>
measuring the height <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>for the irrigation and the other <span style="color: #ff0000;">waterlevels</span>. These are observed and published for general information....<br/>
This is of importance to the peasants for the management of the water,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">embankments</span>, the canals, etc., and to the officials on account of the<br/>
taxes. For the higher the rise of water, the higher are the taxes'.<br/>
<br/>
Farther to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.</span>, opposite the Cataract Hotel, lies a massive<br/>
Ancient Structure. Many of the blocks used were taken from earlier<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">edifietys </span>and are covered with inscriptions of different dates. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">roek-inscriptions </span>close to the stream should also <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>noticed.<br/>
<br/>
The entire S. part of the island is covered with great mounds<br/>
of rubbish formed by the ruins <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ancient </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Town </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1illephantine</span>,<br/>
Among some brick walls a few paces to the W. of the quay we may<br/>
distinguish the foundations of a small temple, constructed with<br/>
stones brought from earlier <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices</span>, including the drums of columns<br/>
and blocks with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>of Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IIL</span>, and<br/>
other monarchs. From the solitary stump of a column now standing we learn that Trajan was the builder. Close by is the top of a<br/>
Greek altar in red granite, with the inscription,'To the great god<br/>
Ammon'. About <span style="color: #0000FF;">50 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">paces </span>to the E. a granite portal, once the entrance<br/>
to some large temple, dominates all this part of the island. The<br/>
reliefs upon it show Alexander, the son of Alexander the Great<br/>
(comp. p. lxxxvii), <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ram-headed </span>Khnum and other<br/>
deities of Elephantine. Inscribed blocks and sculptured fragments<br/>
lie around in all directions. Various other buildings, seen and <span style="color: #0000FF;">described </span>by the savants of the French Expedition, were pulled down<br/>
about the beginning <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>19th century. Among these were temples<br/>
built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ameuophis </span>III. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>III.<br/>
<br/>
The higher parts of the island, especially a granite promontory<br/>
on the W. bank, command a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">*View </span>of the black and brown,<br/>
<br/>
rough and smooth rocks of the cataract, among which the Nile flows.<br/>
<br/>
A row round the island is recommended (1/2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">him</span>). - The islet <span style="color: #ff0000;">of<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ihrdinarti </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirdat</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">% </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Island</span>, between Elephantine <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the W. bank of<br/>
the Nile, belongs to Lord Kitchener.<br/>
