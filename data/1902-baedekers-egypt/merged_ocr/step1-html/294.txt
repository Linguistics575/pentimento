left leads back to the town, from the houses of which the Mosque<br/>
of Sultan Hasan (p. 49) stands out conspicuously. The road, first<br/>
in a straight direction, afterwards inclining to the right, leads to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis </span>known as Imam <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shtde'i </span>(p. 68).<br/>

the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Isma'iliyeh </span>Canal, is reached from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezbekiyeh </span>via the Sharia<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Balms </span>and the bridge of Abu <span style="color: #0000FF;">LEleh </span>(P1. A, B, 3; electric tramway,<br/>
p. 27). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Its </span>narrow streets present a very busy scene, <span style="color: #0000FF;">affording </span>a<br/>
more characteristic picture of Oriental life than the capital. Goods<br/>
are conveyed hither from Upper Egypt, from Nubia, and from the<br/>
fertile Delta. The principal quay, nearly opposite the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh<br/>
</span>Palace Hotel (p. 76), is most frequented between October and <span style="color: #0000FF;">December</span>, when the rapids of the river are most easily navigated.<br/>
<br/>
At the N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span>of the town is situated the Arsenal, founded in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">1835</span>, with a manufactory of weapons attached to it. Machinery for<br/>
Egyptian manufactories arriving from Europe is put together at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bela </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>before being sent to its <span style="color: #0000FF;">final </span>destination, and all repairs of<br/>
machinery are executed here. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Btartlr </span>also boasts of a large Iron<br/>
Foundry, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedivial </span>Technical School, a Paper <span style="color: #0000FF;">Manufactory</span>, a<br/>
House of Correction for Women, a Lunatic Asylum, and the Government Printing <span style="color: #0000FF;">omee</span>, none of which establishments will interest<br/>
ordinary travellers<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

</span>The island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gestreh </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gestret </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Btltf.k</span>) lies in the Nile opposite<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ihllilr</span>. Travellers cross in a few minutes by <span style="color: #0000FF;">motor-launch </span>(in<br/>
winter only) or by <span style="color: #0000FF;">rowing-boat</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">road </span>thither crosses the handsome Great Nile Bridge adjoining the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Futr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Mt </span>(P1. A, 5, p. 40),<br/>
the extensive barracks of Cairo. The bridge, about 420 yds. in<br/>
length, was built by a French iron company. The buttresses, which<br/>
were constructed with the aid of <span style="color: #ff0000;">air-tight'eaissons</span>', are of solid<br/>
stone, and are 55 yds. apart. The bottom of the foundations is<br/>
about 45 ft. below the level of the river when at its lowest. At a<br/>
very early hour in the morning an interesting and picturesque crowd<br/>
of peasantry may be seen congregated here for the purpose of paying<br/>
duty on the wares they are bringing to market. The Nile bridge<br/>
is opened for the passage of vessels through it for an hour in the<br/>
morning and another in the afternoon (announced on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">noticeboards</span>), and is then impassable for foot-passengers and carriages.<br/>
<br/>
The starting-place of the electric tramways to the Museum and<br/>
Pyramids of Gizeh is situated on the Island of Gezireh, immediately<br/>
beside the bridge (comp. pp. 77, 112). The S. part of the island,<br/>
to the right of the road (<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the tramway follows), is adorned<br/>
with a beautiful avenue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">lebbek-trees</span>, which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">thronged </span>with<br/>
<br/>
