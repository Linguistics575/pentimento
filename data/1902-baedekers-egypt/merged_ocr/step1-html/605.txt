<span>312 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">26. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mi-ntw</span>. From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lurcor<br/>
<br/>
</span>dedicated to Nekhbet,'mistress of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Re-yant</span>' (i.e. of the entrance to<br/>
the desert-valley)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It consists of a ruined <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vcstibule </span>of the Ptolemaic<br/>
period, with papyrus-columns (the capitals of which strew the<br/>
ground), and of a Chamber, the roof of which was <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>by four <span style="color: #ff0000;">six<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">teen-sided </span>columns embellished with heads of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The names of the king, Ammon, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nekhbet</span>, several representations<br/>
of the gods, and the face of the king were defaced under Amenophis IV.<br/>
and restored under Sethos I. - On the Entrance Door of the chamber are a<br/>
votive inscription and a representation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>The exterior<br/>
walls have no reliefs, but inscriptions and paintings (ships) were placed<br/>
upon them at a later date<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>to the right of the door is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khtrem-wtwst</span>, in<br/>
presence of Ramses IL, his father, in commemoration of the king's <span style="color: #ff0000;">tifth<br/>
</span>jubilee, in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dist </span>year of his reign. Another hieroglyphic inscription<br/>
here is certainly the latest found in Egypt:'In the 13th year of his majesty,<br/>
lord of the world, Napoleon <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ill.</span>' On the pavement outside the chapel<br/>
representations of foot-prints have been scratched <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>pilgrims (p. 311).<br/>
<br/>
The representations within the Chamber have retained their colouring<br/>
in good condition. On each side of the entrance, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and his<br/>
father Thutmosis IV. seated at <span style="color: #ff0000;">bunquet-tssNes </span>Left Wall. Amenophis III.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to the sacred boat, which is decorated with <span style="color: #0000FF;">hawks</span>' heads<br/>
added at a later period; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>III. presenting incense and water to<br/>
Nekhbet; Ammon (blue) embracing the king and holding the hieroglyph<br/>
for'life' before the king's <span style="color: #0000FF;">face</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rear </span>Wall. On each side of the recess,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>sacrificing to Nekhbet. Right Wall. The hawk-headed Horus<br/>
handing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyph </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for'life</span>' to the king who stands before him; the<br/>
king presenting two wine-jars to Nekhbet; the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to the<br/>
sacred boat. Adjacent are <span style="color: #0000FF;">demotic </span>inscriptions in red, written by visitors<br/>
to the chapel<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rlhe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">names </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenuphis </span>alternating with heads <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor<br/>
</span>are arranged as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>frieze in this hall and as an embellishment on the<br/>
architrave; at the base of the walls are bulls in a marsh.<br/>
<br/>
At this little temple we turn, direct our steps towards the Nile,<br/>
and in 1/4 hr. reach the ROCK TEMPLE, on the right side of the valley, recognizable from a distance by the Stair leading up to it. The<br/>
latter consists of 41 steps hewn in the rock, with a massive <span style="color: #0000FF;">balustrade </span>on each side. The temple was constructed under Ptolemy IX.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span>. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Physkon</span>), and provided with reliefs and <span style="color: #ff0000;">inscriptions<br/>
<br/>
</span>by him and by Ptolemy X. Soter II.<br/>
<br/>
On reaching the platform at the top of the stair, we pass through a<br/>
doorway to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vestibule</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>not quite 33 ft. wide, which was supported by<br/>
columns with elaborate floral capitals, while the exterior sides were<br/>
bounded by low walls built between columns. Thence another <span style="color: #0000FF;">door </span>the<br/>
right half of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is still standing, leads into a smaller Hall (only <span style="color: #ff0000;">19ft</span>.<br/>
wide), <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>also was bounded by low walls between columns. The floor<br/>
is covered with ruins. The door leading to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ROCK </span>CHAMBER opened at<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>of this hall. This chamber, which was originally a tomb<br/>
chamber dating from the New Empire, has a vaulted ceiling, with vultures<br/>
hovering in the centre. At the top of the walls is a frieze made of the<br/>
name of Ptolemy X. between heads of <span style="color: #0000FF;">HathOr</span>. Below are inscriptions<br/>
and much injured representations of the king and queen before various<br/>
deities. This sanctuary also was especially dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nekhbet</span>.<br/>
<br/>
On an isolated hill, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>from the steamboat landing-place,<br/>
are a number of <span style="color: #ff0000;">*ROCK </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tomas</span>, placed side by side on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>slope.<br/>
Most of these date from the end of the Middle Empire or from the<br/>
beginning of the New Empire. There are 31 tombs in all, but only<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>repay a visit.<br/>
<br/>
These tombs, hewn side by side in the rock, are, like all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monuments </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">e1-Kkb</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Small </span>dimensions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>their distinct pictures of an<br/>
