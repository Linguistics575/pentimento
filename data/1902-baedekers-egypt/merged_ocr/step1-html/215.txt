<br/>
kingdom of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharaohs </span>with that widely extended Greek empire which it was his great ambition to found. The site chosen<br/>
was opposite the island of Pharos, near the ancient Egyptian village<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhakotis</span>, between the Mediterranean Sea and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mareotic </span>Lake<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">21</span>), which was connected with the Nile by several navigable<br/>
channels. The choice was both judicious and <span style="color: #0000FF;">far-seeing</span>. For the<br/>
older, and apparently more <span style="color: #ff0000;">favourably </span>situated, harbours at the E.<br/>
end of the Delta, close to the Red Sea, were exposed to the danger<br/>
of being choked by the Nile mud, owing to a current in the Mediterranean, beginning at the Strait of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gibraltar1 </span>which washes the whole<br/>
of the N. African coast. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Deinocrates</span>, the architect, was entrusted<br/>
with the planning and building of the new city. After Alexander's<br/>
death, when his empire was divided among his generals, Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">f.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sober </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">323-286 </span>B.C.) came into possession of Egypt. During his<br/>
wise and upright reign Alexandria became a great resort of artists<br/>
and scholars, including Demetrius Phalereus, the orator, who suggested the foundation of the famous library, Apelles and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Antiphilus</span>,<br/>
the painters, Euclid, the mathematician, and Erasistratus and<br/>
Herophilus, the physicians. A history of Alexander the Great<br/>
written by Ptolemy himself has unfortunately been lost. This Ptol-.<br/>
emy also founded the Museum (p. 9), a splendid pile dedicated to<br/>
science and poetry, in which scholars dwelt as well as studied and<br/>
taught. Comp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1xxxvii</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Notwithstanding the continual <span style="color: #0000FF;">dissensions </span>among the Ptolemies<br/>
with regard to the succession to the throne (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lxxxvii </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, which<br/>
seriously disturbed the peace of the city, the fame of Alexandria,<br/>
as the greatest centre of <span style="color: #0000FF;">commerce </span>in the world and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span>seat of<br/>
Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">learning</span>, steadily increased, and in B.C. <span style="color: #0000FF;">48</span>, when the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">omens </span>interfered in the quarrels of Cleopatra and her husband<br/>
and brother Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">KIT'.</span>, had reached its zenith. After the murder<br/>
of Pompey at Pelusium, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesar </span>entered Alexandria in triumph<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cvij</span>, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>attacked by the citizens and the army of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemy </span>XIV., and had considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>in maintaining himself<br/>
in the Regia (see p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">9 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Case</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>was afterwards conquered by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">charms </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span>queen, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>Antony fell more fatally into her<br/>
toils, and spent years of revelry with her at Alexandria <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>42-30 ].<br/>
Augustus enlarged the city by the addition of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the-suburb </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nicopolis </span>(p. 18). At this prosperous period Alexandria is said to have<br/>
numbered more than <span style="color: #ff0000;">Guuf-mitior1 </span>inhabitants. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek </span>element<br/>
predominated, <span style="color: #0000FF;">next </span>in importance to which was the Egyptian, while<br/>
a numerous, but exclusive, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jewish </span>community was settled <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>as<br/>
early as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">4th </span>cent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Greek scholar and traveller Strabo (<span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">66-24</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>describes Alexandria as it was in the decades immediately before the beginning <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">our </span>era,<br/>
in the 17th Book of his Geography. The former island <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharos </span>had been<br/>
united to the mainland by an embankment known as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heptastadium<br/>
</span>(see p. 9), and on the E. extremity of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">island </span>rose the famous light<br/>
house built by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sostratos</span>, the Cnidian, in the reign of Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ir</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Phila- <span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">delphus</span>, which was regarded <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the ancients <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">onu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the wonders of<br/>
