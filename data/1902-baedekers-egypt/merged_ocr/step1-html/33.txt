third for his head. The slippers or pattens are then put on, and the<br/>

is sprinkled over the feet, fresh towels are then provided, and the<br/>
bather at last throws himself down on his divan, wonderfully refreshed, yet glad to enjoy perfect repose for a short <span style="color: #0000FF;">time</span>. This<br/>
interval of tranquil enjoyment is the favourite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oriental'key</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.<br/>

dressing, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bather </span>is generally provided with two or three more<br/>
relays of fresh towels. The whole of these operations need not <span style="color: #ff0000;">oooupy </span>much more than an hour, but Orientals often devote a whole<br/>
morning to the bath. - Many of the baths are charitable <span style="color: #0000FF;">foundations</span>, where the natives pay little or nothing. Europeans are <span style="color: #0000FF;">generally<br/>

(10). Egypt as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Health Resort. Medical Hints.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">benefieial </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">influenee </span>of the climate of Egypt has been known<br/>
since the Roman period at least, and of late years <span style="color: #ff0000;">an </span>increasing<br/>
number of visitors have <span style="color: #ff0000;">floekei1 </span>to the Nile to enjoy the benefits<br/>
of its remarkably dry <span style="color: #0000FF;">winter-climate</span>. Phthisis (in certain <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases</span>),<br/>
asthma, chronic bronchitis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bright</span>'s disease, rheumatoid arthritis,<br/>
gout, insomnia, <span style="color: #0000FF;">dyspepsia</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and mental strain are some of the most<br/>
important ailments that are at least alleviated by a visit to Egypt.<br/>
In deciding which <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>health-resorts in Egypt a given case should<br/>
be sent to, the physician must of course consider whether or not<br/>
warmth must be <span style="color: #0000FF;">secured </span>along with dryness of air, whether purity<br/>
of air alone or also a bright stimulating climate is to be specially<br/>
sought, and whether cold winds are harmful or not. Invalids who<br/>
have not been ordered to a particular health-resort before leaving<br/>
home should consult a physician immediately on arriving in Egypt;<br/>
and it is advisable in all cases to secure the advice of the physician<br/>
resident at the spot selected.<br/>
<br/>
It is now generally understood that Cairo cannot properly be <span style="color: #0000FF;">considered </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>health-resort. The presence of a large city with its noise<br/>
and bustle, its situation, exposed to the influence of a wind coming<br/>
from the N. over the broad cultivated Delta, the unhealthy saturation<br/>
in the early part of winter of considerable low-lying tracts of the<br/>
town composed of old rubbish, and the higher relative humidity, all<br/>
combine to compel those who seek health from the climate of Egypt<br/>
to look to other stations. There are, however, excellent health-resorts in the immediate vicinity of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">capital</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>vis. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mona </span>House Hotel,<br/>
and especially <span style="color: #0000FF;">Holman</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luster </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assut</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'m</span>, in Upper <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>still<br/>
more favourable climatic conditions. There is at least one English<br/>
physician <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>each of these four stations. The hotels at all are ex<br/>
