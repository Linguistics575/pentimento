</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lenism</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">earlier </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">illiberal </span>limitation of Greek interests to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Greekspeaking </span>countries was exchanged for a cosmopolitan <span style="color: #0000FF;">liberality</span>;<br/>
classical culture enjoyed a second <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowering-tue</span>, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">harbingered<br/>
</span>the culture of the Roman imperial epoch <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>indeed that of the<br/>
Renaissance also.<br/>
<br/>
The great buildings of the Greek period in Egypt have gradually<br/>
disappeared almost without leaving a trace, though some lingered<br/>
until last century, for the simple reason that most of them were<br/>
built of marble which could be used conveniently as material for<br/>
other buildings or for lime-burning. The majestic <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrian<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>with its forest of pillars has disappeared, leasing as its<br/>
only <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called'Pompey</span>'s Pillar' which originally stood in<br/>
the middle of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-court</span>, the recently excavated foundations,<br/>
and a number of isolated blocks of stone scattered throughout the<br/>
city. Yet in size and conception this building was one of the greatest<br/>
creations of ancient Architecture, and the first achievement of the<br/>
new style originated by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Deinoerates</span>, the gifted architect of Alexander<br/>
the Great, which exhibited a combination of Oriental and ancient<br/>
Greek forms<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum</span>, the common national sanctuary of the<br/>
Greeks and Egyptians, was elevated high above the city by means of a<br/>
huge substructure cut <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>of the rock. The platform on the top, <span style="color: #0000FF;">reached<br/>
</span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">late-Roman </span>period by a staircase of a hundred steps, formed<br/>
a spacious <span style="color: #ff0000;">temple-eourt</span>, which was surrounded with colonnades and<br/>
adorned at the entrance with <span style="color: #ff0000;">propyleea </span>and in the centre with the<br/>
above-mentioned huge column, which was probably intended to<br/>
have a companion. The temple, with the colossal statue of Serapis,<br/>
occupied the background. This colossus and the temple itself were<br/>
experiments in the new style of <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">just </span>introduced from<br/>
the East. The statue of Serapis is said to have included six different<br/>
metals, besides all kinds of gems, but the exact method of its construction is still uncertain. It was apparently, however, related to<br/>
the new style of <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall-decoration</span>, which can be minutely traced in<br/>
its prototypes, beginning, and progress. The walls of Babylonian<br/>
and Persian royal palaces were built of sun-dried bricks and then<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">laced </span>with slabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>alabaster, glazed tiles, or even with gilded metal<br/>
plates; in like manner the brick walls in the buildings of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies<br/>
</span>were covered - first of all, it is said, in the Serapeum - with slabs<br/>
of marble, glass, or metal, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>adorned with friezes, reliefs, or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mosaics</span>. So late as <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>end of the 16th cent. the Italian traveller<br/>
Filippo <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pigafetta </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>1533-1604) saw in Alexandria fragments of wall<br/>
decoration'of wonderful <span style="color: #0000FF;">world</span>, in houses that had survived from<br/>
antiquity and were still inhabited; and even in the present day the<br/>
heaps of rubbish which have gradually accumulated above the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ruins<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ufantiquity </span>have been searched through and through for the real and<br/>
imitation gems once used in this mural decoration. Extensive<br/>
remains of marble <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation</span>, which was often combined with the<br/>
rarest varieties of stone, have recently been found on the coast at<br/>
<br/>
