<br/>
hewn stone was used for portions of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">edifiees</span>; the mosque of <span style="color: #ff0000;">E1Ahmar</span>, built in 1125, showed the first example of a stone <span style="color: #ff0000;">faeade<br/>
</span>embellished with <span style="color: #ff0000;">stalaetites</span>. The portals began to he placed in<br/>
recesses, and small <span style="color: #ff0000;">eupolas </span>made their appearance in the interior<br/>
of the mosques. The pointed arch, introduced in the mosque of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jhn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulfm</span>, gave place to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Persian'keel'-ara</span>. Towards the<br/>
close of this period forms began to be adopted, especially in military <span style="color: #0000FF;">architecture</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>that seem to have been copied from the buildings of the Crusaders in Syria and Palestine. The leading <span style="color: #ff0000;">eharaeteristic </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">EYYUBIDE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">PERIODwaS </span>the introduction of the ground-plan<br/>
of the Persian medreseh, which superseded the previously used<br/>
ground-plan of the courts until the first Mameluke period. Large<br/>
domes began to be built over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mausolea</span>, which as founders'<br/>
tombs were placed near the sanctuaries of the mosques.<br/>
<br/>
To the FIRST MAMELUKE DYNASTY we owe a number of huge<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">editiees</span>, with ground-plans in both the above-mentioned styles and<br/>
exhibiting, especially in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fagades</span>, the influence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architecture </span>of the Crusaders. Most of these structures date from the<br/>
reigns of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bihars </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ealiton</span>, the latter of whom raised the first<br/>
minaret of stone. Under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nasir </span>endeavours began to be made to<br/>
design <span style="color: #0000FF;">facades </span>independent of foreign <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Under the SECOND <span style="color: #0000FF;">MAMELUKE </span>DYNASTY the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mosque-fapade </span>attained its zenith, and from this period date the most elegant<br/>
achievements of Arabic architecture in Egypt. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">fapades </span>now<br/>
assumed a more homogeneous character; the minarets, of enhanced<br/>
elegance ever <span style="color: #0000FF;">since </span>the days of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kalafm</span>, reached their highest development; the domes, now also built of stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see below), were<br/>
richly adorned with sculpture; and the walls, ceilings, pavements,<br/>
and even domestic furniture were sumptuously embellished with<br/>
mosaics, panels, carvings, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">stalaetites</span>. The first dome built of<br/>
stone was that of the mosque of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barly1ls </span>(p. 65).<br/>
<br/>
The use of written characters has played a prominent part in<br/>
the decoration of Arabic buildings at all times, and the art did not<br/>
deteriorate in the latest period. Under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulunides </span>the closely<br/>
written <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cutie </span>character was employed, while under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fttimites<br/>
</span>and, still more, under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eyyubides</span>, the letters became taller and<br/>
more slender. The letters themselves and the spaces between them<br/>
were embellished with <span style="color: #0000FF;">arabesque </span>ornamentation. In the later <span style="color: #0000FF;">periods </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cursive </span>character known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neskhi </span>was used also; and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">t'riezes </span>of intertwined letters dating from the period of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes </span>frequently rise to the dignity of works of art.<br/>
<br/>
We may now proceed to an examination of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">special </span>kinds of<br/>
buildings, beginning with the mosques.<br/>
<br/>
Mosques are of two kinds, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">thimiU</span>, lit. an assembly for<br/>
prayer, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mesgid</span>, the place on which the knee is bent for prayer.<br/>
The oldest <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosques </span>are very simple in <span style="color: #0000FF;">plan </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span>. the plan <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
mosque of Ibn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulttn</span>, p. 53). Around a quadrilateral court (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sum</span>),<br/>
