<span>262 Route 24. <span style="color: #0000FF;">THEBES </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">w. </span>BANK). 3. Temple <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflfuma</span>.<br/>
<br/>
of this part are of the time of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, and far inferior to those<br/>
of the central building and left-hand portion of the sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
We re-enter the colonnade through Door c, and proceed through<br/>
Door fl to visit the LEFT DIVISION <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>temple. In the small CHAPEL<br/>
0F RAMSES I. (with two papyrus-bud <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span>), are high reliefs,<br/>
which were <span style="color: #ff0000;">probably'usurped</span>' by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>to the right the king<br/>
kneeling before Ammori, Khons, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deified </span>Sethos, while<br/>
behind him is Mut. - Adjoining are three CHAMBERS (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PLA</span>, B, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cy<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the side-walls <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the central chamber (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. A) Sethos I. offers<br/>
incense to the boat of Ammon. On the rear-wall is a door-shaped<br/>
stele to Ramses II. The two other rooms (P1. B and C) were built<br/>
by Ramses II. and contain rather rude reliefs (the king before the<br/>
gods). - A side-door (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>leads from the Chapel of Ramses I. to<br/>
a narrow Corridor, the left wall of which is now represented by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>single course of masonry. Thence we enter (to the right) ROOM D,<br/>
with sunk reliefs dating from Ramses 11., showing that king and his<br/>
father Sethos <span style="color: #ff0000;">sacrifioing </span>before various deities. - A small Door<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. m) at the end of the corridor brings us <span style="color: #0000FF;">owe </span>more into the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A little to the N. of the temple is a spring with a water-wheel<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">S </span>& <span style="color: #ff0000;">lljipeli</span>) and some <span style="color: #0000FF;">sunt </span>trees, used as a watering-place for cattle.<br/>
Farther to the N., among the spurs of the Libyan mountains, is the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Neeropolis </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Drab </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu't </span>Negga.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Drah </span>Abu'l Negga is <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>of the oldest cemeteries <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span>, and the<br/>
treasures discovered here by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mariette</span>'s excavations were of extraordinary<br/>
value. Tombs of the 11th, 13th, and 17th Dynasties were discovered here,<br/>
but they have all been destroyed. The Rock Tombs <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the hill-slope of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Drall </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu'l </span>Negga are more interesting. Immediately behind the last<br/>
houses in the village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kurne </span>is the Tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Web-a1mors</span>, dating from the<br/>
beginning of the New Empire, with tasteful stucco reliefs of vintage and<br/>
funeral scenes. A hole in this tomb is the only access to the adjacent<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomb </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jfent-aersghopshef</span>, royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">fan-bearer</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>the two chambers here<br/>
one has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>up by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>landslip. The very fine reliefs of the other<br/>
<br/>
represent <span style="color: #0000FF;">burial-scenes </span>and funeral <span style="color: #ff0000;">saerifiees</span>. - Farther to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>is the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished </span>Tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramos√©</span>, an architect.<br/>
<br/>
4. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Biben </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e1-Mu1tA</span>. Tombs of the Kings.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomes </span>OF THE KINGS AT <span style="color: #0000FF;">BIBAN </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">EL-Nm/i</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>belong to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">18-20th </span>Dynasties, and, in contrast to the pyramids that mark the graves of kings<br/>
up to the beginning of the New Empire, consist of series of passages and<br/>
chambers hewn in the rock. Like the corridors within the pyramids they<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>intended only for the reception of the sarcophagus; the temples<br/>
dedicated to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">manes </span>of the deceased, in which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>to the dead<br/>
were made, were built in the plain.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">STRUCTURE </span>of the tombs is <span style="color: #0000FF;">practically </span>the same in all. Three<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Corridors</span>, placed one beyond the <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>led into the innermost <span style="color: #0000FF;">recesses</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Small </span>side-chambers sometimes opened <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>the first corridor; oblong recesses<br/>
were made at the top of the sides of the second; and small recesses for<br/>
the reception of the furniture of the dead were provided at the end of<br/>
the third<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A door led from the third corridor into an <span style="color: #0000FF;">Anteroom</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">beyond<br/>
</span>which lay the Main <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall</span>, where, in a hollow in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor</span>, the heavy<br/>
granite <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus </span>was deposited. The main hall, the roof of which<br/>
