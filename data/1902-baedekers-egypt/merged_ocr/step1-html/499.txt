<br/>
and entered by narrow flights of steps or by openings concealed<br/>
by movable stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">slabs</span>. Their elaborate mural reliefs date from<br/>
the reign of Ptolemy XIII. Neos <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dionysos</span>, and are therefore the<br/>
oldest as well as the best executed decorations in the temple. The<br/>
arrangement and entrances of the crypts are shown in the small<br/>
Plans <span style="color: #0000FF;">li</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1v</span>. Magnesium wire or a lamp will be found<br/>
useful in examining the painted walls.<br/>
<br/>
In Crypt No. 4, which we <span style="color: #0000FF;">enter </span>through a square opening in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pavement</span>, are several narrow chambers, on the walls of which are depicted<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>vessels, ornaments, and images of the gods that were preserved here. The colouring of the admirably executed reliefs is remarkably fresh. On the right wall of the second room to the right is an<br/>
interesting relief of King Pepi (6th Dyn) kneeling and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>a golden<br/>
statuette of the god Ehi to four images <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofHathor</span>. On the walls of Crypt<br/>
No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span>(entered through an opening in the pavement of the small <span style="color: #ff0000;">sacriiieial </span>court), Ptolemy XIII. appears presenting gifts (<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>ornaments) to<br/>
various gods. - Crypts <span style="color: #0000FF;">Not</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">2'e </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2.</span>, arranged above each other in two<br/>
stories, are also <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>they are most conveniently accessible from<br/>
Room <span style="color: #ff0000;">VII</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We now return to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">flrst </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">antechamber</span>, and ascend one of<br/>
the Staircases (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">2128</span>), which lead hence to the roof <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>temple.<br/>
<br/>
The EAST <span style="color: #0000FF;">STAIRCASE</span>, which ascends straight to the roof with easy<br/>
steps, is dark, being lighted only by a single opening in the wall. The<br/>
WEST <span style="color: #0000FF;">STAIRCASE </span>is a kind of spiral staircase, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>ten rectangular bends<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the right, lighted by several windows, with tasteful <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbolical </span>representations of the sun shining through them. The walls of both staircases are embellished with reliefs of the ceremonial <span style="color: #0000FF;">procession </span>of the<br/>
priests with the images <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Hathor and her fellow-gods at <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>great New<br/>
Year's Festival. The left wall presents us with <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>view of the procession<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ascending </span>from the lower rooms of the temple, the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall </span>shows it<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">descending</span>. The priests are headed by the king; some of them wear<br/>
masks representing the lesser deities. After completing the circuit of the<br/>
lower rooms, the procession ascended to the roof of the temple, in order<br/>
that'the goddess Hathor might be united with the beams of her father<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">RE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>(the sun-god). - The W. staircase passes <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>small room (situated <span style="color: #ff0000;">aheve<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">storeruom </span>adjoining the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">antechamber</span>), with three windows<br/>
looking into the court. Higher up is a small court with two rooms opening<br/>
off it, <span style="color: #0000FF;">corresponding </span>to the chambers for the cult of Osiris <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the E. side<br/>
of the terrace (see below).<br/>
<br/>
We now reach the Temple Roof, which has various levels, the<br/>
highest being above the great vestibule or <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronaos </span>(p. 229). At<br/>
the S.W. angle of the lower terrace, which we reach first, stands a<br/>
small open Pavilion, supported by 12 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor-columns</span>. Adjoining<br/>
the terrace on the N. are three rooms, situated above the chambers<br/>
to the left of the smaller hypostyle hall. These were used in the<br/>
worship of the slain and risen Osiris, as curious representations<br/>
and numerous inscriptions indicate. The second room, separated<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mst </span>by pillars, formerly contained the famous Zodiac of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Dendera </span>(now <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Biblioth√©que </span>Nationale at Paris), the only<br/>
circular representation of the heavens found in Egypt. The remaining portion of the ceiling still shows two figures of the goddess<br/>
of heaven. - A flight of steps ascends from the N.W. of the terrace<br/>
to the roof of the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">antechamber </span>and thence to the still higher<br/>
roof of the hypostyle hall. Thence a <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>iron staircase leads to<br/>
