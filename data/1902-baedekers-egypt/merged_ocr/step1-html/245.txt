<br/>
HISTORY OF CAIRO. At a very remote period a city lay on the<br/>
E. bank of the Nile, opposite the great pyramids, and was called by<br/>
the Egyptians <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khere-ohe</span>, or'place of <span style="color: #0000FF;">combat</span>', because Horus and Set<br/>
were said to have contended here (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">CXX</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Greeks named it <span style="color: #0000FF;">Babylon</span>, probably in imitation of some Egyptian name of similar sound.<br/>
The citadel of this town (p. 71) was fortified by the Romans, and<br/>
under Augustus became the headquarters <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>one of the three legions<br/>
stationed in Egypt. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">AD</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>(W) Babylon was captured by'Amr <span style="color: #ff0000;">ihn<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elvA.s</span>, the general <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khalif </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Omar</span>, who subsequently established<br/>
the new capital of the country here, in opposition to Alexandria<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>), which was not so free from the disturbing Christian element.<br/>
A mosque was built on the site of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">conqueror</span>'s tent, and the<br/>
Arabic word for tent (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fos.tli.t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">became </span>the name of the new city. The<br/>
latter gradually expanded towards the N., and was extended to the<br/>
N.E. as far as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">base </span>of the citadel by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Armed </span>ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tuhin</span>, who<br/>
erected the new quarter of <span style="color: #0000FF;">et-late</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span>". Ahmed's splendour-loving<br/>
son <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jfhumdriiyeh </span>embellished the town with lavish <span style="color: #ff0000;">magnifieenee</span>.<br/>
The modern city of Cairo was founded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">GOar</span>, the general of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">timite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khalif </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mut'zz</span>, after the conquest of Egypt in 969 A.D,<br/>
He erected a residence for the Khalif and barracks <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the soldiers<br/>
commanded by him to the N. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-1.Gti'i</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>At the hour when the<br/>
foundation of the walls was laid, the planet Mars, which the Arabs<br/>
call <span style="color: #0000FF;">1.Ghir</span>, or'the <span style="color: #ff0000;">vietorious</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">crossed </span>the meridian of the new city;<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mui'zz </span>accordingly named the place <span style="color: #ff0000;">Masr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-lrtthira</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">K </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">him</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mast</span>, the ancient Semitic name of Egypt, was also applied to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fast </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span>,<br/>
the form <span style="color: #ff0000;">Masr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-'Attlca </span>(Old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo</span>) being only introduced at a later<br/>
date for the sake of <span style="color: #ff0000;">elearness</span>. The new town extended rapidly.<br/>
Bricks were easily made of the Nile mud, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam </span>hills afforded<br/>
excellent stone, while the gigantic ruins of the ancient Memphis<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the opposite bank of the river were also used as a quarry. In<br/>
973 Mui'zz took up his permanent residence in the new city of<br/>
Cairo. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1106 </span>the citadel which still commands the city was erected<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Falh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eddtn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ythufihn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Eyptsh </span>(Saladin) <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the slope of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohattam </span>hills; and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span>sultan caused the whole town, together<br/>
with the citadel itself, to be enclosed by a wall, 29,000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ens </span>in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">length </span>Under his luxurious and extravagant <span style="color: #ff0000;">Successors </span>Cairo was<br/>
greatly extended and <span style="color: #ff0000;">magnitieently </span>embellished. At that period,<br/>
however, Cairo was fearfully devastated by the plague, as it had<br/>
been on two former occasions (in 1067 and 1295), and was also<br/>
