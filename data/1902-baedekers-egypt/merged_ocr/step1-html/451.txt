<span>196 Route 18. MINYEH. From Cairo<br/>
<br/>
The group to the N. belongs to <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Graeeo-Roman </span>period<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>that to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>to the ancient kingdom. Near the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs </span>of the time of the Ptolemies<br/>
are several Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>One sepulchral chapel, containing some<br/>
representations <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a late date, is interesting. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>Greek or Roman grandee<br/>
is here shown <span style="color: #ff0000;">saerifining </span>to a number of Egyptian deities. The only inscriptions extant are <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the inner side of the door. Higher up on the<br/>
rock-walls are two horses in the Roman style, held by men. Farther to<br/>
the S. is a colossal image, carved out of the rock, of Ramses III. <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing<br/>
</span>to the god Sobk. - The <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>ancient group of tombs to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.</span>, the inscriptions on which are in very bad preservation, are believed to belong<br/>
to the necropolis of the town of Akoris, mentioned by Ptolemy alone<br/>
and belonging to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cynopolis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Mounds mark the site of the<br/>
ancient town.<br/>
<br/>
152 M. Minyeh <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ofinia</span>) lies on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>bank of the Nile, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>is here over 1/2 M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">broad</span>. At the railway-station (p. 190) is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">huffet<br/>
</span>with good bedrooms <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">211</span>.) and in the town are three hotels kept<br/>
by Greeks. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">well-huilt </span>and handsome town, with 20,400 <span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab.</span>, is the seat of the Mudir of a district containing <span style="color: #0000FF;">267 </span>towns<br/>
and villages and <span style="color: #0000FF;">548,600 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">inhahitants</span>. There is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">telegraph-offiee<br/>
</span>at the railway-station, and adjacent is the post-office. The town<br/>
possesses a hospital and several mosques. Parts of the street running<br/>
along the river are planted with trees. A handsome bridge, with<br/>
locks, spans the canal. To the N. of the town is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">lightly-huilt<br/>
</span>chateau, with a large fruit-garden (many <span style="color: #0000FF;">apple-trees</span>). The large<br/>
sugar-factory is the oldest in Egypt, and a visit to it during the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar-harvest </span>is of great interest; most of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>are French<br/>
and very <span style="color: #0000FF;">obliging</span>. Market-day in Minyeh presents a very gay and<br/>
characteristic picture of Oriental life.<br/>
<br/>
Opposite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Minyeh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span>bank, lies <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jrtwn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Kefara</span>, with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs </span>of the Middle Empire.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ztuviyet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-3ftttn </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Zthvipet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Amultt</span>) is situated on the E.<br/>
bank, 41/2 M. above Minyeh. - To the S. of the village lies the<br/>
fine cemetery of the citizens of Minyeh, with its numerous domed<br/>
tombs and chapels. Faithful to the custom of their ancestors under<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Pharaohs, the inhabitants still ferry their dead across the river<br/>
and bury them near the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes' walk towards the S. brings us to the large<br/>
mound of <span style="color: #ff0000;">rubhish </span>known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rtsm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Alynar </span>('the red mound'),<br/>
Which runs parallel with the Nile. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Climbing </span>over this, we reach<br/>
the ancient Rock Tombs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are situated in a row among the<br/>
Arabian hills, with their gates towards the river.<br/>
<br/>
The tombs, nineteen in all, are those of princes and <span style="color: #0000FF;">grandee</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hebenu</span>, and nearly all date <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the close of the Early Empire. They are<br/>
unfortunately in bad <span style="color: #0000FF;">preservation</span>. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>of them have been destroyed<br/>
by violence, the stones being removed for use in building. The most interesting are those of Khunes and of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arefer-sekherts</span>, superintendent <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">storehouses </span>of Upper and Lower Egypt, under the New Empire<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>107 <span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Benihusun</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">011 </span>the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">bank</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
