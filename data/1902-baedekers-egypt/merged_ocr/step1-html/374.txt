adorned with religious inscriptions and containing a large and a<br/>
small sarcophagus; adjoining is a smaller chamber.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the Step Pyramid, as we continue on our way to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mariette'g </span>House, a striking view <span style="color: #ff0000;">Opens </span>towards the N. In the foreground lies the green valley of the Nile, bordered by palm-trees,<br/>
and framed on both sides with the yellowish-grey desert; and we<br/>
also observe the alabaster mosque of Mohammed'Ali at Cairo. On<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>left tower the three pyramids of Gizeh, and the three nearer<br/>
pyramids of Abusir. The path turns to the right beyond the next<br/>
heap of rubbish (N.W<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, crosses the hollow, and soon reaches<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lirariette'g </span>House. Mariette, the famous French Egyptologist,<br/>
first rose into notice by his discovery of the Apis Tombs in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1851</span>',<br/>
and from 1858 till his death in 1881 was director of the official<br/>
excavations in Egypt. No charge is made for admission to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">terrace</span>,<br/>
but it is usual to give a fee of <span style="color: #ff0000;">21/2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">pias</span>. or more, according to the<br/>
number of the party, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">haftrs</span>' who take charge of the house.<br/>
A guide to the tombs must be taken at Mariette's House, as visitors<br/>
are not admitted to them unattended.<br/>
<br/>
A trodden path leads from Mariette's <span style="color: #0000FF;">House</span>, to the W., in a<br/>
few min., to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Apis </span>Tombs, the subterranean part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
</span>ian Serapeum, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Apis, the sacred bull of the god Ptah (p. 132), which was worshipped<br/>
in a special temple at Memphis<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>was after death embalmed like a human<br/>
being and interred with great pomp in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">necrOpnlis </span>of Memphis. As<br/>
early as the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, and probably still earlier, the Apis<br/>
tombs consisted of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>subterranean tomb-chamber, reached by a sloping<br/>
shaft, over which a chapel was erected in honour of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ball</span>. Under<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>a large common grave was prepared for the Apis bulls by<br/>
Prince <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kha-em-weset</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>a subterranean gallery, over <span style="color: #ff0000;">iOOyds</span>. in length,<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock </span>and flanked with chambers, which were walled up<br/>
after receiving the wooden coffin containing the sacred remains. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psammetikh </span>I. caused a similar gallery <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>side-vaults to be constructed at<br/>
right angles to the first one. These vaults, which were added to at intervals down to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>period, were much <span style="color: #0000FF;">larger </span>and more carefully<br/>
constructed than the previous series. They have an aggregate length of<br/>
about 380 yds. and are about 10 ft. in width and 171/2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft </span>in height. Above<br/>
them rose a <span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>temple for the cult of the dead god. - The ancient<br/>
Egyptians believed that like the soul of men (p. cxxiii) the spirit of the<br/>
deceased bull was united with Osiris, and became <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'0siris-Apig</span>' (Egypt.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Osn-hapi</span>; Gr. Osorapis). He thus became a kind of god of the dead and<br/>
was called, like Osiris<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>'Lord of the western <span style="color: #ff0000;">land'.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>pilgrims crowded to<br/>
the tomb to pay their devotions and to present votive offerings. The last<br/>
were usually small memorial tablets, which were inserted in the walls<br/>
of the subterranean galleries. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">worship </span>of the foreign god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seraph </span>or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sarapis</span>, introduced under Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, rapidly spread in Egypt, and it is<br/>
easy to understand how the new <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seraph </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">confounded </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osorapis<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>worshipped along with the latter in the ancient temple in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">necropelis </span>of Memphis. The temple itself came to be commonly known as the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>or Sarapeum. Within the extensive chambers of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum<br/>
</span>there was <span style="color: #0000FF;">established </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">colony </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hermits</span>, who lived in the strictest <span style="color: #0000FF;">seclusion </span>in small cells, receiving even their food through narrow windows<br/>
or air-holes. There is no doubt that these were the prototypes of the<br/>
Christian monks and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascetics </span>of a later period. - A second temple of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Osorapis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektanchos</span>, once stood opposite the temple covering<br/>
the Apis tombs (W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mariette</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>house). These temples were connected <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
