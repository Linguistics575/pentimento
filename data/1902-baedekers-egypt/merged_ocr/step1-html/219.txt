<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">influenee </span>of the philosophers then resident at the Museum. In<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Trajan</span>'s reign (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p8-trr</span>) the Jews, who constituted one-third of<br/>
the whole population, caused sanguinary riots. Hadrian (<span style="color: #0000FF;">117-138</span>),<br/>
who visited the city twice, held public disputations with the professors at the Museum. Marcus Aurelius (<span style="color: #0000FF;">0 </span>attended the<br/>
lectures of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">grammariaus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Athenaus</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harpocration</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bephastion</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ulius </span>Pollux, and others. Lucian also lived at Alexandria at this<br/>
period, in the capacity of secretary to the prefect of Egypt. In<br/>
199 Severus (193-211) visited Alexandria, and established a new<br/>
municipal constitution. A disastrous visit was that of Caracalla<br/>
(211-217), who revenged himself for the derision of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">citizens </span>by<br/>
a bloody massacre and also caused the academy to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">closed</span>. Still<br/>
more disastrous were the contests between the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palmyrenes </span>and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Imperialists </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>xci), in which a large part of the population was<br/>
swept away by the sword, pestilence, and famine.<br/>
<br/>
Christianity early found its way to Alexandria. According to<br/>
tradition, the Gospel was first preached to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrians </span>by St,<br/>
Mark (<span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span>bones were removed to Venice in 828). The first<br/>
great persecution of the Christians, which took place in the reign<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Decius </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">250</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a terrible blow to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Alexandriaus</span>. The city<br/>
had for a considerable time been the seat of a bishop, and had<br/>
since 190 possessed a <span style="color: #0000FF;">theological </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">school</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>presided over by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pantaenus<br/>
</span>and Clement of Alexandria, who <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to combine <span style="color: #ff0000;">ChriSLianity </span>with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Neo-Platonism </span>which sprang up about this period<br/>
at Alexandria and was taught by Ammonius <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saeeas</span>, Herennius,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Plotinus</span>, and others. A second persecution took place in 257,<br/>
during the reign of Valerian; and shortly afterwards, in the<br/>
reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gallienus</span>, the plague carried <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>a large portion of the<br/>
population.<br/>
<br/>
Christianity, however, still <span style="color: #0000FF;">continued </span>to gain ground, and Alexandria was even regarded as the chief seat of Christian erudition<br/>
and of the orthodox faith under Athanasius. Alexandria was <span style="color: #0000FF;">meanwhile </span>soon obliged to yield to Constantinople its proud position as<br/>
the centre of Greek thought and science. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanguinary </span>quarrels<br/>
between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Athanasian </span>party and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Adams </span>under their unworthy<br/>
bishop Georgius further contributed to the rapid decline of the city.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the accession of Julian the Apostate (361-363) the pagans of<br/>
Alexandria again instituted a persecution of the Christians. In the<br/>
reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theodosius </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">379-390</span>), however, paganism received its<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Math-blow</span>, and Theophilus, the patriarch of Alexandria, displayed<br/>
the utmost zeal in destroying the heathen temples and monuments.<br/>
The famous statue of Serapis was burned and most of the temples<br/>
were converted into churches. The material prosperity of the city<br/>
also fell off so greatly that the municipality was no longer able to<br/>
defray the cost of cleansing the Nile and <span style="color: #0000FF;">keeping </span>the canals open.<br/>
The revenues of Alexandria were still farther diminished by the<br/>
proceedings of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>patriarch <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ovril</span>. who led the armed mob against<br/>
<br/>
