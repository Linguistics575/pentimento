<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">6</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum</span>. THEBES (<span style="color: #ff0000;">W.BANK</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>Route. 285<br/>
<br/>
in the camp; now released from their burdens, they testify satisfaction by<br/>
means of movements and attitudes which the artist seems never tired <span style="color: #0000FF;">D<br/>
</span>drawing. The soldiers are conversing with each other, and one drinks<br/>
from a wine-skin. Disputes <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>quarrels are not wanting, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">campfollowers </span>ply their <span style="color: #0000FF;">staves </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">actively </span>on each other. Above, to the right,<br/>
the tranquillity of the camp is rudely disturbed by an attack of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hittites</span>. To the Right the king, seated upon his throne, takes counsel with<br/>
his princes who stand before him; close by is the royal chariot. Beneath<br/>
captured spies are being beaten, in order to extract information. - The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">representation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>Wing of the pylon are even more realistic. The<br/>
left half is occupied <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the picture of the battle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kadesh</span>, which we<br/>
have already seen on the pylon at Luxor (p. 240). Ramses in his chariot<br/>
dashes against the foes, who are either slain by his arrows <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>flee in wild<br/>
confusion and <span style="color: #ff0000;">fall </span>into the Orontes. Behind the king are his <span style="color: #0000FF;">war-chariots</span>.<br/>
To the right, at a distance from the scene of action, is the Hittite prince.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Above </span>is a second, now scarcely <span style="color: #0000FF;">distinguishable</span>, representation of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hittites </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fleeing </span>to their fortress. The reliefs on the right half show the<br/>
usual presentment of the king, grasping enemies by the hair and <span style="color: #0000FF;">smiting<br/>
</span>them; <span style="color: #0000FF;">farther </span>to the right is the king holding a long <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">alf</span>, and accompanied by <span style="color: #0000FF;">fan-bearers</span>.<br/>
<br/>
On the interior walls of the Portal of this pylon are the usual reliefs<br/>
of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to various gods. At the top of the Jambs (P1. a, b)<br/>
Ramses appears pacing out the precincts of the temple (a rite performed<br/>
at the foundation of a temple); <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the bottom, various deities.<br/>
<br/>
The First Court is now utterly <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruined</span>, and scarcely a trace remains of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades </span>that bounded it on two sides. Fragments,<br/>
however, of the lofty wall on the W. side are still standing. In front<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>gate lie the remains of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Colossus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span>11.,<br/>
the hugest statue in Egypt. The name <span style="color: #ff0000;">offtamses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>appears in <span style="color: #ff0000;">wellpreserved </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>on the upper arm and on the seat of the<br/>
statue<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The face is unfortunately completely destroyed. The remains (breast, upper arm, one foot, etc.) still testify to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">care<br/>
</span>with which this gigantic monument was chiselled and polished.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">savants </span>of the French Ex edition carefully measured the various<br/>
parts, as follows: length of ear <span style="color: #ff0000;">1/2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>surface of face from ear to ear<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">63/</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>ft., surface of breast from <span style="color: #ff0000;">shOulder </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>shoulder <span style="color: #ff0000;">231/3 </span>ft., from one<br/>
shoulder to the other in a straight line <span style="color: #0000FF;">211/</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">T </span>circumference of the arm<br/>
at the elbow 171/2 ft., diameter of the arm between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">elbow </span>and shoulder<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">4</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">% </span>ft., length of the index <span style="color: #0000FF;">linger </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">31/5 </span>ft., length of the nail <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the middle<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">finger </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">7</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>inches, breadth of ditto 6 inches, breadth of the foot across<br/>
the toes, 41/2 ft<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The total height seems to have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">571/2 </span>ft., and its<br/>
total weight over two million pounds.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>head of another Statue of Ramses II. was found on the<br/>
S. side of the temple farther back, and was conveyed to the Nile by<br/>
Belzoni in 1816, and thence to Alexandria. It is now one of the chief<br/>
treasures in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum. Other fragments<br/>
have been brought to light more recently.<br/>
<br/>
The Second Court is entered through a gap in the wall to the<br/>
right of the colossus. It is in much better preservation than the<br/>
first court, and is mentioned with its <span style="color: #ff0000;">earyatides </span>in Diodorus's description of the tomb of Osymandyas. On all four sides were colonnades, those to the right and left (N. and S.; almost wholly <span style="color: #0000FF;">destroyed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>having two rows of papyrus-bud columns and those on the<br/>
front <span style="color: #0000FF;">CE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>) and back (W.) square pillars with statues of Osiris and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus-bud </span>columns. The W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>is raised on a kind of<br/>
terrace.<br/>
