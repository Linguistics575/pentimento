still less in Upper Egypt. The change of the wind to the N.W. or W.<br/>
is abrupt, with cool weather for frequently 10-20 days before another<br/>
Khamsin blows. The effect is stimulating to the individual. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">name'Khamsin</span>' is also applied by Europeans, though erroneously,<br/>
to a similar but much more gentle wind in winter. About 50 per<br/>
cent of the days of the year are calm <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">windless</span>) in the Libyan<br/>
Desert; and these calms extend in winter to Upper Egypt also, less<br/>
often to Lower Egypt-The <span style="color: #ff0000;">intluenee </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span>or Arabian Desert<br/>
and the Red Sea upon the climate of the Nile valley is very slight.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the Mediterranean Sea and the Libyan Desert a<br/>
third factor <span style="color: #ff0000;">influeneing </span>the climate of Egypt is found in the extent<br/>
of cultivated land. Alexandria, owing to the prevailing winds, is<br/>
under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">influenee </span>of both <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea </span>and desert in winter, but from May<br/>
to October under that of the sea alone. Cairo, at the apex of the<br/>
Delta, is partly affected by the desert in winter, but from May to<br/>
October it is wholly under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the Delta and its cultivated<br/>
land. Upper Egypt is much less affected by this third factor than<br/>
Lower Egypt, for the bends of the Nile valley and the very limited<br/>
cultivation permit the N. and N.W. winds to pass over large tracts<br/>
of desert before it reaches Upper Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The mean TEMPERATURE in winter at Cairo and in the greater<br/>
part of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Deltais </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">56째Fahr</span>.<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temperature </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lowest </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the latter<br/>
half of Jan., being then about that of London or Berlin at the end<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">September</span>. In spring the mean is 78", in summer <span style="color: #0000FF;">830 </span>(maximum<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">95째</span>, or during the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rhamstn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">115째</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, in autumn <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">XP</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Alexandria is<br/>
more <span style="color: #ff0000;">inf1ueneeil </span>by the sea, and it is therefore warmer in winter<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooler </span>in summer than Cairo. The mean winter temperature is<br/>
MP (minimum M"). In Upper Egypt, where the desert climate<br/>
prevails almost exclusively, the mean winter temperature is 66"<br/>
(minimum 37째), and in summer the heat sometimes rises to 1220<br/>
in the shade. Throughout the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>of Egypt the temperature<br/>
reaches the minimum <span style="color: #0000FF;">just </span>before sunrise, when it is very cold, rises<br/>
quickly until <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>a. m., then more slowly till it touches the maximum <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>2 or 3 p. 111., after which it gradually falls again. There<br/>
is 110 sudden fall of temperature at sunset, except in the cultivated<br/>
land. The temperature at night is considerably affected by <span style="color: #0000FF;">vegetation</span>. Observations made with automatic recording instruments in<br/>
the neighbourhood of Cairo and at Luxor have demonstrated that<br/>
when the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crops </span>are high the nocturnal temperature sinks much lower<br/>
in the cultivated land than in the towns or in the desert.<br/>
<br/>
The temperatures mentioned above will probably seem high to<br/>
any Northern traveller; but as a matter of fact they are not felt to<br/>
be oppressive owing to the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">DRYNESS </span>of the Egyptian climate,<br/>
which has a drying power thrice as great as that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">air </span>in the<br/>
Engadine and thus rapidly absorbs all moisture generated at the<br/>
surface of the body. Rain is a rare phenomenon in Upper Egypt.<br/>
Even at Cairo the clouds are seldom condensed into a continuous<br/>
