<span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>of interest as <span style="color: #0000FF;">illustrating </span>the method in which these <span style="color: #ff0000;">rocktombs </span>were <span style="color: #0000FF;">hollowed </span>out. - <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tom</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lt </span>belonged to a'military commander<br/>

been carefully obliterated; while contrary to the usual rule in these tombs,<br/>
the names of the king and queen have been left uninjured. The tomb<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">portion </span>of the entrance-wall are preliminary<br/>
sketches in black of <span style="color: #0000FF;">various </span>objects (ships, a garden, a house with columns). - <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOMB </span>15 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ot'Suti </span>had just been <span style="color: #0000FF;">begun </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span>.

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tome </span>23, belonging to Eni, a royal <span style="color: #ff0000;">tlouse-steward </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">scribe</span>, differs<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>tombs in its arrangement<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A flight of limestone steps <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascends </span>to the entrance, which is crowned with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>concave cornice, and in<br/>
front of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eolonnade </span>was intended to be erected. On each side of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span>, lintel are the king and queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>three princesses praying to the sun;<br/>
on the left side in the entrance is the deceased praying, with the text<br/>
of his prayer in front of him, on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>right side he appears with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">staff<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">nosegay </span>(painted on stucco). The walls <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">MAIN </span>CHAMBER are<br/>
coated with <span style="color: #0000FF;">stucco</span>, but with the exception of the concave <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornice </span>at the<br/>
top are unpainted. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">RECESS </span>is a colossal statue of the deceased. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>the right wall are the deceased and his wife seated before a worshipper,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the left wall, the deceased seated at table and receiving <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowers </span>from<br/>
a priest. These scenes also are <span style="color: #0000FF;">painted </span>on stucco but are much faded.<br/>
<br/>
TOMB 25, the farthest to the S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>this group, belonged to the<br/>
priest and fan-bearer at the king's right hand Eye, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">favourite </span>of<br/>
Amenophis IV. and his successor on the throne (p. lxxxii). This<br/>
tomb, like so many of the others, was left <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished</span>, because the<br/>
king died during its construction, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">court </span>was soon afterwards removed <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>to Thebes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>Eye caused a new tomb to be<br/>
made for himself (p. 277). On the Door Posts, to the right and<br/>
left, are Eye and his wife, kneeling below inscriptions. In the<br/>
ENTRANCE, to the left, are the king and <span style="color: #0000FF;">queen</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>followed by the<br/>
princesses and the court, praying to the sun, which directs its <span style="color: #ff0000;">armshaped </span>rays towards the altar; below are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eye </span>and Ti, his wife, in<br/>
prayer. To the right are Eye, in his <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftieial </span>costume, and his wife<br/>
praying, their prayers being inscribed beside them. - The <span style="color: #0000FF;">MAIN<br/>
</span>CHAMBER was designed to be supported by 24 papyrus-columns<br/>
with closed bud-capitals, but only 15 have been hewn out, and of<br/>
these only 4 are <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished</span>. The remainder (to the S.) have only<br/>
been begun in the living rock at the top. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>three of the columns<br/>
appear the deceased and his wife, adoring the names of the sun and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the king and queen. In the centre <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the rear-wall is an <span style="color: #ff0000;">untinished </span>door-shaped stele; <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.E</span>. angle is a flight of steps<br/>
leading to the not yet begun <span style="color: #ff0000;">sarcophagus-ehamber</span>; and in the N.W.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">angle </span>is an unfinished door-shaped stele. The representation on the<br/>
left portion of the Entrance Wall, the only one <span style="color: #ff0000;">fi11ished</span>, deserves<br/>
notice. To the left are the king and queen at a window of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">palace </span>throwing down decorations to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eye </span>and his wife (upper parts<br/>
