<span>LOWER NUBIA. 351<br/>
<br/>
consisted, as it does to-day, of a number of separate districts (<span style="color: #ff0000;">e.g</span>.<br/>
the land of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wewet</span>). The present inhabitants of Nubia are more<br/>
faithful to their ancient manners and customs than the Egyptians.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">History</span>. Lower Nubia, whence the Egyptians drew their supplies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">incense</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">mentioned </span>in some of the earliest Egyptian inscriptions<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Its relations with Egypt were still <span style="color: #ff0000;">eloser </span>under the kings<br/>
of the 6th Dyn., who there enlisted negro mercenaries, while the<br/>
princes of Elephantine dispatched great trading expeditions to the<br/>
lands of the Upper Nile. But it was not until the period of the<br/>
12th Dyn. that the conquest of Nubia was undertaken and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">borders </span>of Egypt advanced to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Semneh </span>(p. 379). In order to guard the<br/>
newly acquired possessions against the attacks of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes </span>a<br/>
chain of forts was erected in the rocky valley of Bath <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Wgar<br/>
</span>(p. 378), with its numerous cataracts<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Halfa </span>and<br/>
Semneh. From this base the Pharaohs of the 18th Dyn. penetrated<br/>
still farther to the S. and made themselves masters of the land of<br/>
Kosh as far as Napata (p. 382), which then became the southernmost<br/>
city of the empire. The conquered regions were incorporated with<br/>
the southernmost department <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>proper, which began at <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-fob<br/>
</span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mi</span>), and the whole of the great province thus formed was placed<br/>
under an <span style="color: #ff0000;">off1eial </span>who bore the title of'Prince of Kosh and Governor<br/>
of the Southern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lauds</span>'. Under the established rule of Egypt Nubia<br/>
rapidly prospered; new towns were founded, and beautiful temples,<br/>
little inferior in size and embellishment to those of the motherland,<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>arose in profusion, especially on the W. bank of the Nile, which<br/>
was safe <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the attacks of the E. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>. Most of these temples<br/>
were dedicated to the great Egyptian gods, Ammon, <span style="color: #ff0000;">RE-Birrmiwhis</span>,<br/>
and Ptah; but in some of them other deities were also worshipped,<br/>
such as Isis and others of the Egyptian gods, the local Nubian god<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tetun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the deceased King Usertesen <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, who united the roles of<br/>
first conqueror and patron-saint of Nubia, and occasionally also the<br/>
reigning king and queen (pp. 360, <span style="color: #ff0000;">364</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">370</span>, 374). The <span style="color: #ff0000;">templeinseriptions </span>were composed in the Egyptian language and written<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">character</span>, and Egyptian became the <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieial </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ianguage</span>, although the great mass of the people adhered to their native<br/>
Nubian tongue.<br/>
<br/>
Nubia <span style="color: #0000FF;">continued </span>to be a dependency of the Pharaohs until about<br/>
1100 B.C. But when the power <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>waned under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">21st </span>Dyn.<br/>
(p. lxxxiii), Nubia shook off her allegiance and a native <span style="color: #0000FF;">ETHIOPIAN<br/>
</span>MONARCHY was established, with Napata as its capital. But the<br/>
civilization of this kingdom continued to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>Egyptian; and its<br/>
monarchs, who were dependent on the priests, regarded <span style="color: #ff0000;">therhselves<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>the true protectors of the Egyptian religion and l? the <span style="color: #0000FF;">legitimate<br/>
</span>rulers of Egypt. In 775 <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.O</span>. the Ethiopian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Piankhe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1xrrx1jr</span>) temporarily <span style="color: #0000FF;">over'ran </span>all Egypt, and shortly afterwards an <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ethiopian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ciyd<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nasty </span>(the 25th; p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxxiv</span>) established itself firmly oh the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian<br/>
</span>throne. But in little more than a century (about <span style="color: #0000FF;">064 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bi</span>.) these<br/>
