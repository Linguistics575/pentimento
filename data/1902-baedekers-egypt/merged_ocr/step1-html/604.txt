</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>M. El-Kib, on the E. bank, the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekhab</span>, once ranked<br/>
among the chief cities of Egypt. Even under the Ptolemies it was<br/>
the capital of the third <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>of Upper Egypt, which was afterwards<br/>
named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lat0polites</span>. Its princes for a time were also governors <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>Ethiopia. Nekhbet, the goddess of the town, was represented either<br/>
as a vulture or a woman with the crown of Upper Egypt; she was<br/>
regarded as a protecting deity of Upper Egypt. She also assisted<br/>
women in childbirth, and was therefore identified with Eileithyia<br/>
by the Greeks, who named the town <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eileitlipiaspolis</span>. Half-a-day<br/>

<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*RUINs </span>OF THE ANCIENT TOWN <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">NEKHAB</span>, which are surrounded by a massive girdle-wall of <span style="color: #0000FF;">san-dried </span>bricks, lie near the<br/>
river. The wall, which probably dates from the Middle Empire, is<br/>
damaged only on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W.</span>, by the Nile. It is of immense thickness<br/>
(37 ft.) and encloses a rectangle, 620 yds. long by 590 yds. broad,<br/>
with gates <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the E., N., and S. sides, beside which broad ascents<br/>
lead to the top of the wall. The N, wall intersects a necropolis of<br/>
the Ancient Empire, excavated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Quibell </span>in 1897. The city itself,<br/>
enclosed by another double wall, of which distinct traces are still<br/>
to be seen, occupied only about one-fourth of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">space </span>within the<br/>
girdle-wall. Very scanty ruins now remain of the temple, built<br/>
during the 18th Dyn. on the site of an earlier sanctuary and enlarged by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nektanebos </span>and others.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Visitcrs </span>should not omit to ascend to the top of the N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall</span>, for the<br/>
sake of the admirable view: to the E., at the head of a desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">valley</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">appear </span>the isolated rock with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yt.</span>,<br/>
and a little nearer, the chapel of Ramses II. (comp. below); to the N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
</span>the hill with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-tombs</span>, and a little farther away is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mushroom</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shaped </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">melt</span>, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">quarries </span>that yielded the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone </span>for the city temple.<br/>
<br/>
We follow the route leading due E. from the E. gateway in the<br/>
girdle-wall, and cross the dazzlingly white sand, past a small ruined<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sandstone </span>Temple (no inscriptions) close to the wall. In rather more<br/>
than 1/2 hr. we reach <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>Chapel of Ramses 11., known to the Arabs as<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">el-l.rarntnitm</span>, i.e.'the bath'.<br/>
<br/>
This temple was built in the reign of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethw</span>, governor<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ethiopia </span>represented in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance-doorway </span>and on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">1nter10r_walls<br/>
</span>on each <span style="color: #0000FF;">side </span>of the entrance. Other reliefs show Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing<br/>
</span>to Thout, Horus, and other deities. 0n the upper part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall<br/>
</span>(right) are apes, sacred to Thout; below are <span style="color: #0000FF;">praying </span>men.<br/>
<br/>
We keep straight on, leaving the larger temple of the Ptolemies<br/>
on the left, and soon reach two <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rocks </span>projecting from the plain, at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>point where the road turns N. towards the <span style="color: #ff0000;">desert.i </span>halfway between <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-esrnrmim </span>and the E. temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>III. Both<br/>
rocks bear numerous inscriptions and figures of animals. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Most </span>of<br/>
these date from the 6th Dyn. and were placed here by worshippers<br/>
in an adjoining temple..<br/>
<br/>
The charming small temple or <span style="color: #ff0000;">*OHAPEL </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">AMENOPHIS </span>III. lies<br/>
fully 1/4 hr. to the E. It may be reached direct <span style="color: #0000FF;">ie </span>about an hour<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tho </span>little temple, which is about <span style="color: #ff0000;">50 </span>ft. deep, was<br/>
