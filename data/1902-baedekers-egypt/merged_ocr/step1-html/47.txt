<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>MODERN <span style="color: #0000FF;">EGYPTIANS</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">pop11lation </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt </span>is composed<br/>
of the following ten different elements.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">FELLlir-riN </span>(sing. <span style="color: #ff0000;">fell√©h</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'tillers</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'peasants</span>', with<br/>
whom must be reckoned the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span>peasants of Upper Egypt, form<br/>
the bulk of the population and may be regarded as the sinews of the<br/>
national strength. They are generally slightly above the middle<br/>
height; their bones, and particularly their skulls, are strong and<br/>
massive; and their wrists and ankles are powerful and somewhat<br/>
clumsy. In all these respects the <span style="color: #ff0000;">felltOtn</span>, as well as their domestic<br/>
animals, contrast strongly with the inhabitants of the desert, the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">feJhill </span>and the Beduin differing from each other precisely in the<br/>
same points as their <span style="color: #0000FF;">respective </span>camels. Notwithstanding this largeness of frame, however, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah </span>never grows fat. The woman and<br/>
girls are particularly remarkable for their slender build. The men<br/>
generally keep their <span style="color: #0000FF;">heads </span>shaved, but the hair of the soldiers and<br/>
the long tresses <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>girls, though <span style="color: #0000FF;">always </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">black </span>and thick, is smooth<br/>
and wavy, seldom curly. The hair on the faces of the men is <span style="color: #ff0000;">scantier<br/>
</span>and more curly.<br/>
<br/>
The chief peculiarity of the Egyptians is the remarkable closeness of their eyelashes on both lids, forming a dense, double, black<br/>
fringe, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>gives <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>animated an expression to their <span style="color: #ff0000;">almondshaped </span>eyes. The very ancient and still existing custom <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">blackening </span>the edges of the eyelids with <span style="color: #0000FF;">antimony </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Chem</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is said<br/>
to serve a sanitary <span style="color: #0000FF;">purpose</span>, contributes to enhance this natural<br/>
expression. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>eyebrows are always straight and smooth, never<br/>
bushy. The mouth is wide and thick-lipped, and very different<br/>
from that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beduin </span>or inhabitant of the oases. The high <span style="color: #ff0000;">cheekhones</span>, the receding forehead, the lowness of the bridge of the nose,<br/>
which is always distinctly separated from the forehead, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flatness </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the nose itself, are the chief characteristics of the<br/>
Egyptian skull; but, as the jaws project less than those of most<br/>
of the other African coloured races, it has been assumed that the<br/>
skull is Asiatic, and not African in shape. The Egyptian peasantry<br/>
have a much darker complexion than their <span style="color: #0000FF;">compatriots </span>in the towns,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>their colour deepens as we proceed southwards, from the pale<br/>
brown of the inhabitant of the Delta to the dark bronze hue of the<br/>
Upper Egyptians. There is, however, a difference between the tint<br/>
of the Nubians and that of the Upper Egyptians, even where they<br/>
live in close <span style="color: #0000FF;">contiguity</span>, the former being more of a reddish-brown.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the ancient representations women are painted yellow and men<br/>
red, merely because the former were paler owing to <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">indoor </span>life,<br/>
while the men were browned by labouring in the open air <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Virchow</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The dwelling of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah </span>is of a miserably poor description,<br/>
