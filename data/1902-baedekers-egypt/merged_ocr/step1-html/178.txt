<span>BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS. <span style="color: #ff0000;">clxvii<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eorniee-shelf</span>, on which are arranged porcelain, chased <span style="color: #ff0000;">metal-work</span>,<br/>
and similar ornaments. Instead of panelling, the walls <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">durkira<br/>
</span>have coloured marble mosaics. The upper part of the walls is usually<br/>
covered with smooth plaster, or, in exceptional cases, with plaques<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>coloured fayence. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">expanse </span>of white wall is usually broken by<br/>
a grated recess intended for female singers and accessible by a short<br/>
flight of steps from without. At the very top of the wall is a broad<br/>
concave frieze, embellished with <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">stalactites</span>, and forming the transition to the usually elaborate ceiling-decorations. Light<br/>
and air are admitted to the room from one of the ends<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">where </span>mushrebiyehs are inserted in the lower part of the wall and <span style="color: #ff0000;">kamariyehs </span>in<br/>
the upper part.<br/>
<br/>
The Public Baths, usually of quite unpretending exterior, are<br/>
frequently very large erections in which marble is not spared,<br/>
though few have any claims to artistic importance. A visit to one<br/>
of these simple <span style="color: #0000FF;">vapour </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">maths </span>is not uninteresting (comp. p. xxiv).<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Okellas</span>' (p. 38) were important <span style="color: #ff0000;">edifiees </span>when the caravan<br/>
trade, especially the caravan-trade with the Red Sea, flourished.<br/>
Their often extensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">facades </span>exhibit peculiar carvings. The portals<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">resemble </span>those of the mosques, and the locks and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fastenings </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
outer shops are sometimes carved. The central <span style="color: #ff0000;">hypathral </span>court <span style="color: #0000FF;">accommodated </span>the caravan, the goods brought by which were deposited<br/>
in vaulted chambers on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">groundfloor</span>, while the rooms in the<br/>
upper stories. opening "galleries, <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>used as lodgings by the<br/>
merchants. The centre of the court was probably invariably occupied by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mosalla</span>.<br/>
<br/>
When we come to analyse the impressions produced by a study<br/>
of Arabic buildings in Egypt, we find that our admiration of the<br/>
harmonious and tasteful ornamentation, unsurpassed by any school<br/>
of architecture, is counterbalanced by a certain feeling of aesthetic<br/>
dissatisfaction, prompted by the numerous incongruities arising<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">unsystematic </span>and unskilful treatment <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>architectonic details.<br/>
Part of this dissatisfaction is doubtless to be placed to the account<br/>
of the dilapidated <span style="color: #0000FF;">condition </span>of most of the buildings. But the real<br/>
reason why Arabian art failed to reach a high level in technical<br/>
ability as well as in ornamentation must <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>looked for in the early<br/>
collapse of the great empire of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs</span>; in the uncertain and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">vacillating </span>political circumstances of the period that followed; in<br/>
climatic and geological conditions; in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of superstition;<br/>
and in the characteristic Oriental tendency to adhere with obstinate<br/>
fidelity to ancient forms and to leave unaltered anything that has<br/>
once been accomplished. However much admiration the arabesque<br/>
may excite, however great an <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>it may exert on industrial<br/>
art, we still miss in it the reproduction of living beings, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">0011templation </span>of which invites, as it were, an intelligent and active<br/>
sympathy.<br/>
