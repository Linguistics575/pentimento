<span>RELIGION. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cxxv<br/>
<br/>
</span>In flat contradiction to these doctrines was the popular belief<br/>
that man possessed not only a body but also a soul (<span style="color: #0000FF;">bet</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>spirit<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">akin</span>), which lived after death. This was originally conceived of in<br/>
the shape of a bird; at a later period as a bird with a human head.<br/>
It was believed that the spirit left the body at death and flew freely<br/>
about, but could return to the body at pleasure, provided, of course,<br/>
that the latter remained whole and did not fall a prey to decay.<br/>
Thus from ancient times everything was done in Egypt to prevent<br/>
the destruction of the body, and this object was so completely<br/>
attained by embalming that the features of numerous mummies<br/>
have remained perfectly recognizable to this day. Under the Ancient<br/>
Empire human bodies were preserved with the aid of bitumen and<br/>
rolled in linen bandages and wrappings. The process of <span style="color: #0000FF;">embalming<br/>
</span>was more elaborate at later times. The brains were first removed<br/>
through the nostrils by means of an iron hook; the stomach was then<br/>
opened with a flint knife and the viscera removed (Herodotus II,<br/>
86) and placed in four jars, known as Canopi. These were usually<br/>
closed with lids, bearing the heads of the four sons of Osiris, to<br/>
whose protection the intestines were committed. The heart also<br/>
was removed from the body, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">replaced </span>by a stone <span style="color: #ff0000;">searabasus</span>,<br/>
placed upon the breast of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deceased</span>, beneath the wrappings.<br/>
Herodotus states that at a later period there were three <span style="color: #0000FF;">method</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>of<br/>
embalming, differing according to the expense involved.<br/>
<br/>
A prominent place in the belief of the ancient Egyptians was<br/>
also taken by another immaterial part of mortals, distinct from the<br/>
soul. This was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fra</span>, a kind of guardian-spirit or genius, which<br/>
was born with the individual and accompanied him through life as<br/>
a'double'. The Ka did not expire with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">protege </span>but continued<br/>
to live in order to protect the deceased against enemies in the<br/>
future world.<br/>

List of the Chief Egyptian Deities and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sacred </span>Animals.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">AMMON </span>or AMON (Fig. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, the god of Thebes, was made a sun-god<br/>
under the name <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amon-Ri</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and became the national god under<br/>
the Middle Empire. For his persecution by Amenophis IV., see<br/>
p. 203. His sacred animal was the ram.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, one of the four guardian-deities of the dead, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>protected<br/>
them from hunger and thirst, and to whom therefore the viscera<br/>
of the deceased were dedicated. The other three gods were <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hopi</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thoe-meth </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">irehh-snewf</span>.<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Atrtnns </span>(Fig. 2), a god of the dead, whose function was connected<br/>
with the interment. A later myth makes him a brother of Osiris.<br/>
