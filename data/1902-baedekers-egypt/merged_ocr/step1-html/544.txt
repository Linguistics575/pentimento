<span>Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Sethos I. THEBES (w. BANK). <span style="color: #0000FF;">24</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Route</span>. 261<br/>
<br/>
is visible at a considerable distance. This temple was founded in<br/>
honour of Ammon by Sethos <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, and at the same time was devoted<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>worship of the king's father, Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">I. </span>Sethos left it <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished </span>and Ramses II.'renewed' it, i.e. added the reliefs and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>that were wanting. The beautiful execution of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>and reliefs vividly recall the <span style="color: #0000FF;">contemporary </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sculpPres</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the great temple at Abydos (p. 218). The original <span style="color: #ff0000;">build1ng </span>(see the annexed plan) was 518 ft. in length, but of this only<br/>
the actual sanctuary with its halls and chambers, 153 <span style="color: #0000FF;">n. </span>in depth,<br/>
remains, while there are only scanty relies of the former courts<br/>
and pylons.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">COLONNADE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the front of the temple originally displayed<br/>
10 clustered <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span>with papyrus-bud capitals, but only 8 are<br/>
now left. On the architrave is the dedicatory inscription <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofRamses </span>II.<br/>
In its inner wall are three doors (P1. a, b, c), which lead into the<br/>
three divisions of the temple. On this wall, to the left of Pl<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">b</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>representations of the provinces of Upper Egypt (a man and woman<br/>
alternately), bearing flower-decked dishes with cakes and wine; to<br/>
the right, similar <span style="color: #0000FF;">reliefs </span>of the provinces of Lower Egypt. The<br/>
former have lilies on their heads, the latter papyri - the floral<br/>
emblems of the two regions. Above the former the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">offers<br/>
</span>incense to the bark of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>carried by priests; above the latter<br/>
the king appears before various deities.<br/>
<br/>
Passing through the middle door (P1. o, we enter a <span style="color: #0000FF;">HYPOSTYLE<br/>
</span>HALL with <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>papyrus-bud columns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">flanked </span>on each side by three<br/>
chambers (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">d-i</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. On the slabs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the middle aisle appear<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">winged </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-disc</span>, flying vultures, and the names of Sethos 1.,<br/>
between two vertical rows of <span style="color: #ff0000;">hicroglyphics</span>. The low reliefs on the<br/>
walls show Sethos I. and Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>before various deities. Those<br/>
at Pl, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>and at Pl. B represent respectively Mut and Hathor of<br/>
Dendera nourishing Sethos. - SIDE CHAMBERS. Chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">g </span>is ruined<br/>
and inaccessible; the ceilings in Chambers d, f, and h are in good<br/>
condition. The finely executed reliefs in Chambers e, f, h, <span style="color: #ff0000;">andi<br/>
</span>depict Sethos <span style="color: #ff0000;">I. </span>offering incense or performing sacred ceremonies<br/>
in presence of various deities. In Chamber i: on the left wall, Thout<br/>
before the sacred bark of the king; on the right wall, the king seated<br/>
at the banquet; on the rear-wall, the king as the god Osiris, seated<br/>
in a chapel, surrounded by other gods. In Chamber d are sunk<br/>
reliefs of Ramses IL, showing (right) the king entering the temple<br/>
before Ammon and Amonet, and (left) the king offering incense to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, Khons, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>The SANCTUARY has four unadorned<br/>
square pillars. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the right and left walls Sethos appears offering<br/>
incense before the boat of Ammon.<br/>
<br/>
We now turn to the RIGHT DIVISION of the temple, which is in a<br/>
very ruinous condition. It consisted of the long HALL <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">RAMSES </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>,<br/>
with 10 <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>longer standing), and of several rooms behind<br/>
and beside it, and originally separated from it. The sunk <span style="color: #0000FF;">reliefs<br/>
