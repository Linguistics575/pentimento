</span>The Northern Colossus is the famous vocal statue of Memnon<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>To the left of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span>stands his mother <span style="color: #ff0000;">Metemwa </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sight </span>his<br/>

</span>wife <span style="color: #0000FF;">Teye</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>a third figure, between the legs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>destroyed. On <span style="color: #0000FF;">each<br/>
</span>side of the seat two Nile-gods were represented in sunk relief<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>winding the representative plants of Egypt (papyrus and lily) <span style="color: #0000FF;">round<br/>
</span>the hieroglyph for'to unite', a symbol of the union of Upper <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>Lower Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Attention began to be directed to the Musical Phenomenon <span style="color: #0000FF;">connected </span>with the colossus, about the beginning of the Roman empire, after it had been broken. When it became known that the N.<br/>
colossus emitted a musical note at sunrise, a new myth was invented to <span style="color: #0000FF;">explain </span>the fact. Memnon who had fallen at Troy appeared as a stone image at Thebes and greeted his mother Eos<br/>
with a sweet and plaintive note when she appeared at dawn. The<br/>
goddess heard the sound and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">morning-dews </span>are the tears she<br/>
shed upon her beloved child. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stratus</span>, who is the first author to<br/>
mention the phenomenon, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eXpresses </span>doubt as to its genuineness;<br/>
but <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pausauias </span>and Juvenal (p. 328) accept it as a fact. By later<br/>
observers the sound is compared to that of a stroke upon metal, or<br/>
even of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">trumpet-blast </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>of human voices singing. The sound<br/>
was heard only at or soon after sunrise, though by no means <span style="color: #0000FF;">invariably </span>then, in which case the god was supposed to be angry.<br/>
The phenomenon ceased altogether after the time of Septimius<br/>
Severus, who caused the restoration of the upper portions, perhaps<br/>
with a view to <span style="color: #0000FF;">propitiate </span>the angry god. The restoration was not<br/>
very <span style="color: #ff0000;">skilfully </span>managed, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>courses of sandstone blocks.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Letronue </span>has proved that the resonance of the stone is on no account<br/>
to be explained as a mere priestly trick, and in the opinion of<br/>
eminent physicists it is perfectly possible that a <span style="color: #ff0000;">hard </span>resonant<br/>
stone, heated by the warm sunlight suddenly following upon the<br/>
cold nights in Egypt, might emit a sound, caused by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">splitting<br/>
</span>off of minute particles from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">surface.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>A similar phenomenon<br/>
has been observed elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
The numerous Greek and Latin <span style="color: #0000FF;">Inscriptions</span>, in prose and verse, <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscribed </span>upon the legs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>by travellers under the Roman empire,<br/>
are peculiarly interesting. These are more numerous on the left <span style="color: #ff0000;">than </span>on<br/>
the right leg, and none are beyond the reach of a man standing at the<br/>
foot of the statue. The earliest were carved in the reign of Nero, the<br/>
latest in those of Septimius Severus and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Caraealla</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous </span>(27) in that of Hadrian. Only one Egyptian (who is responsible for<br/>
a short <span style="color: #0000FF;">demotic </span>inscription) is found among these <span style="color: #ff0000;">soribblers</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>were for the most part the work of men of some eminence, including <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>governors of Egypt, 3 <span style="color: #ff0000;">epistrateges </span>of the Thehaid, 2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">procurators</span>,<br/>
etc. Many, though not all, are dated. Nearly all of them afford <span style="color: #0000FF;">proof </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that<br/>
</span>only the N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossus </span>emitted the famous sound. The oldest inscription<br/>
dates <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the 11th year of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nero</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>reign. - Many of the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>who<br/>
visited the marvels of Thebes were accompanied <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>their wives. The<br/>
colossus was frequently dumb, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>case the visitor usually waited<br/>
until a more favourable occasion. Many were so struck with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">phenomenon </span>that they were not <span style="color: #0000FF;">content </span>till they had heard it three or four times<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Hadrian, who journeyed through Egypt in 130 A.D., spent several days<br/>
here along with his wife Sabina <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">retinue</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>In his reign a perfect<br/>
