<br/>
During the season, however (from the middle of Dec. to the middle<br/>
of March), a government-steamer starts every Monday from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shellal<br/>
</span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span>Halfa and back, taking 6 days for the trip and allowing a<br/>
short time at the most important points. The fare is f E 15, including food. Additional particulars on application at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">offiees </span>of<br/>
the Anglo-American Nile Steamer <span style="color: #ff0000;">Co. </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">185</span>) or at Cook's (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">185</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The itinerary of the last-mentioned trip is as follows:<br/>
Ist Day. Start from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shellal </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>2 p.111. and ascend to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dendhr</span>.<br/>
<br/>
2nd Day. Via Dakkeh (inspection of the temple) to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Korosko</span>.<br/>
<br/>
3rd Day. In the morning ascent of the Awas <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Guarani</span>. The<br/>
steamer starts at f) <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>for'Amida (inspection of the temple) and<br/>
Abu-Simbel.<br/>
<br/>
4th Day. Inspection of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-temples </span>at Abu-Simbel; then<br/>
upstream to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span>Halfa. After an afternoon-visit to the Second<br/>
Cataract, the return-voyage is begun in the evening.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">5th </span>and 6th Days. Return-voyage, with a short halt at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kal√©bsheh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahabiyehs</span>. - The voyage by <span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabiyeh </span>(p. 187) requires from<br/>
4 to 6 weeks, according to the wind, and is now only undertaken by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">travellers </span>with special aims, such as archaeologists and painters. The<br/>
scenery of Nubia is much more monotonous than that between Cairo<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assmin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and its monuments, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">exception </span>of the temples<br/>
of Abu-Simbel, are inferior in grandeur to those of Upper Egypt,<br/>
so that the ordinary tourist who uses a dahabiyeh is not <span style="color: #ff0000;">repaid </span>for<br/>
the additional cost of time and money. Fairly good <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyehs </span>may<br/>
be hired at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shell'al </span>for about <span style="color: #ff0000;">gift </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">E </span>20 per month, including the crew;<br/>
but provisions and bedding have to be furnished by the hirer.<br/>
Additional information may be obtained in the hotels at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>Pending the <span style="color: #0000FF;">completion </span>of the navigation canal (p. 336), <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyehs </span>cannot at present be towed up the First Cataract.<br/>

<br/>
Land and People. - Nubia extends from the First Cataract to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1fharttsm</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ale</span>. to MP N. latitude. It is divided into Lower Nubia<br/>
(from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span>Halfa) and Upper Nubia <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Halfe </span>southwards). Politically, the portion to the N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Faras (p. 376) belongs<br/>
to the Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">mudiriyeh </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assain</span>, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>it forms the districts<br/>
of Abu <span style="color: #0000FF;">Her </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Korosko</span>. The rest of Lower Nubia and the whole<br/>
of Upper Nubia has, since its <span style="color: #0000FF;">reconquest </span>in 1898 (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ciii</span>), been<br/>
placed under the administration of the Anglo-Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sudan</span>.<br/>
Even in Lower Nubia the cultivable area is seldom more than a<br/>
few hundred yards in width; and at not a few points, especially<br/>
on the W. bank, the desert advances clear up to the river-brink.<br/>
The population is in consequence very scanty, <span style="color: #0000FF;">vis</span>. 96,500 in 1897.<br/>
Comp. p. xlv. - All the countries on the Upper Nile, from the<br/>
borders of Egypt southwards, were included by the ancient Egyptians under the single name of Kosh, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cash </span>of the Bible. The<br/>
Greeks and Romans called them Ethiopia. Lower Nubia was more<br/>
particularly known to the Egyptians as the'Frontier Land' and<br/>
