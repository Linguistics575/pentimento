<br/>
foot of the Libyan hills. The dark openings of the tombs and caves<br/>
are conspicuous at a distance in the abrupt sides of the mountain.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">At </span>the foot of the hill, beside the neat <span style="color: #0000FF;">slaughterhouse</span>, we dismount<br/>
and follow the good path which leads to the most interesting tombs.<br/>
The tombs are closed with iron gates; the keeper lives beside the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">slaughter-house</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We first reach a Large Rock Tomb, which belonged to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hapsefat</span>, prince of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>in the reign of Usertesen I. The Arabs<br/>
call <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Stabl'Antur</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>or the stable of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antar</span>, a hero of tradition<br/>
(comp. their name for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Speos </span>Artemidos at Benihasan, p. 197).<br/>
<br/>
Entering the tomb we first <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>ourselves in a vaulted PASSAGE, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the left wall of <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hich </span>is the deceased, with a long and now scarcely<br/>
legible inscription in front of him. A doorway, with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the<br/>
deceased holding a staff, on each side, leads hence to the MAIN CHAMBER.<br/>
On the right half of the Entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wall </span>is a long inscription containing<br/>
the text of Ten Contracts concluded between the deceased and various<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">priesthood</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>of his native city to <span style="color: #0000FF;">secure </span>the proper <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>to<br/>
himself and to his statues in his tomb and in the temple, and to provide<br/>
for the performance of other ceremonies. The corresponding inscription<br/>
on the left side of the same wall contains addresses to visitors to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb<br/>
</span>and an account of the merits of the deceased. A door between two<br/>
recesses in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall </span>admits us to a second vaulted <span style="color: #0000FF;">passage</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>leading<br/>
to a SECOND <span style="color: #ff0000;">Roou </span>with three recesses. On the rear-wall of the central<br/>
recess appears the deceased, with three women carrying <span style="color: #0000FF;">lotus-flowers<br/>
</span>before him; on the sidewall he is shown at table, while three rows of<br/>
priests and servants bring gifts to him or perform sacred ceremonies.<br/>
The left recess leads to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mummy-shaft</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*View </span>from this tomb is very <span style="color: #ff0000;">fine</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The fertile land and<br/>
the Nile enclosed by the limestone hills of Libya and the Arabian<br/>
mountains in the distance form a quiet but by no means monotonous setting for the beautiful town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assi1U</span>, with its eleven minarets and its environment of palm-gardens. The view is still grander<br/>
from the higher tombs. Here there is a row of three tombs close to<br/>
each other, dating from the obscure period before the Middle Empire. The northernmost has been destroyed. The second is the<br/>
Kahf <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-rAstikir</span>, or Soldiers' Tomb, so named from the rows of<br/>
warriors armed with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Spears </span>and large shields on its S. wall. On<br/>
the right side of the vestibule appear <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheti</span>, the owner of the tomb,<br/>
and his wife Tef-yeb, with a long and partly <span style="color: #ff0000;">eifaced </span>inscription,<br/>
referring to the otherwise <span style="color: #0000FF;">little-known </span>King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meri-ke-rg</span>. Only a<br/>
single column is left standing in the Main Chamber, in the rear<br/>
wall of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is a recess for the statue of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deceased</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- A passage<br/>
has been made from this tomb to that adjoining it on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>, which<br/>
belonged to Tef-yeb, a prince of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The large Arab Cemetery, which stretches across the plain to<br/>
the N. of the hill of tombs, contains tasteful modern tombs, and<br/>
with its palms presents a <span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span>less gloomy impression than most<br/>
other bare Egyptian cemeteries.<br/>
<br/>
At the foot of the hill, behind the <span style="color: #0000FF;">slaughterhouse</span>, is the tomb of<br/>
another <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hapzqfai</span>, unfortunately much destroyed. It contains some <span style="color: #0000FF;">ceiling<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ornaments </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">tasteful </span>paintings of <span style="color: #0000FF;">harvest-scenes</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">em</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>stucco. Beside it is a small tomb without inscriptions. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>Finally we may mention<br/>
