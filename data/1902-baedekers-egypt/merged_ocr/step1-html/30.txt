Arabian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cafes </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">lcahwa</span>) are frequented by the lower classes exclusively. The front generally consists of woodwork with a few open<br/>
arches. Outside the door runs a <span style="color: #0000FF;">ma.s.taba</span>, or raised seat of stone or<br/>
brick, two or three feet in height and of about the same width,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">covered </span>with mats, and there are similar seats on two or three<br/>
sides of the interior. Coffee is served by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lcahwegi </span>at 1/4-1 pias.<br/>
per cup (<span style="color: #ff0000;">fngtrn</span>), and several <span style="color: #ff0000;">narfilehs </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">shishehs </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">giizehs </span>(waterpipes) are kept in readiness for the use of customers. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">tumbtlk</span>,<br/>
a kind of Persian tobacco, smoked in the latter is sometimes mixed<br/>
with the intoxicating hashish (hemp, Cannabis <span style="color: #0000FF;">indica</span>), the strong<br/>
and unmistakable smell of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is often perceptible even in the<br/>
street. The sale of hashish is now nominally prohibited in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Story Tellers (who in private domestic circles are generally<br/>
women) still form a characteristic Oriental institution. Wherever<br/>
they make their appearance, whether in the public streets or the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">coffee-house</span>, in the densely peopled alleys of the large towns, in<br/>
the smallest country villages, or among the tents of the wandering<br/>
Arabs, they are sure to attract an attentive, easily pleased, and exceedingly grateful crowd. The more sensational the tale, the better,<br/>
and the oftener is the narrator applauded with protracted cries of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'hah</span>', <span style="color: #ff0000;">or'Allih</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Allahu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">akbarl</span>'.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">story-teller </span>belong to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Shoram </span>(sing.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sha'ir</span>), literally'singers'. They are also known <span style="color: #ff0000;">as'Andtireh </span>(sing.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Antari</span>) or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahu-Ztdtyeli</span>, according as their theme consists of tales<br/>
and romances from the history <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'Antar</span>, a Beduin hero, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>from<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ZÃ©d</span>. Others again are called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moliadditht</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span>. narrators<br/>
of history, their province being the recital in prose <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">passages </span>from<br/>
the history of Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eg-Z'ahir </span>Bibars, who reigned over Egypt in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">1260-79 </span>(p. xcvi). The entertainments of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'all</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ttteh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">u </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ttteh'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span>thousand and one <span style="color: #0000FF;">nights</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>are, however, no longer heard, as popular<br/>
superstition has branded this collection of tales <span style="color: #ff0000;">as'unlueky</span>'. The<br/>
themes of the whole fraternity are too often of an immoral character.<br/>
<br/>
Musicians by profession, called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aldttyeh </span>(sing. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aldt0</span>, are indispensable on every festive occasion. The usual instruments are<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">re.kl.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>or tambourine with little bells, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">naglcdreh </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">semispherical </span>tambourine, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">zemr </span>or hautbois, the tabl <span style="color: #0000FF;">beledi </span>or<br/>

of funnel-shaped drum (<span style="color: #ff0000;">generally'made </span>of earthenware, but sometimes of wood inlaid with mother-of-pearl and tortoise-shell, with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>tish-skin stretched over the broad <span style="color: #0000FF;">end</span>), which last is accompanied<br/>
by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">zummcim</span>, a kind of double flute. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>better class of instruments, used for chamber music, consists of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m'ii</span>, a kind of flute,<br/>
