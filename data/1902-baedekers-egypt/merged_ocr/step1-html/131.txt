<br/>
animal-worship. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>was probably only this excessive expansion of<br/>
animal-worship that struck the Greeks in Egypt as remarkable. For<br/>
traces of a similar worship were <span style="color: #0000FF;">common </span>to various Oriental peoples,<br/>
and even among the Greeks and Romans themselves certain animals<br/>
were regarded as sacred to the gods, as, <span style="color: #ff0000;">8.9.</span>, the lions of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cybele</span>, the<br/>
owl of Athena, and the eagle of Zeus.<br/>
<br/>
A stage beyond fetishism was reached when the Egyptians began<br/>
to form an <span style="color: #0000FF;">anthropomorphic </span>conception of their deities. The gods<br/>
had human forms and wore clothing like human beings. Like princes, they wore on their heads helmets or crowns, and, like the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">primaeval </span>rulers, they had lions' tails fastened to the back of their<br/>
aprons. They bore the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sceptre </span>or the <span style="color: #0000FF;">commanders </span>baton as the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">symbol </span>of their might. The deities that were conceived of as animals<br/>
now received human figures, with the heads of the animals sacred<br/>
to them. Thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sable </span>appears as a man with a crocodile's head,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khnum </span>as a man with a goat's head, the ibis-headed Thout and the<br/>
ram-headed Amman have human bodies, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete</span>. Though such a device<br/>
cannot but appear both strange and <span style="color: #0000FF;">repellent </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">us </span>as it did to the<br/>
Greeks, it <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>be confessed that the Egyptian artists in their reliefs<br/>
and statues of those animal-headed gods managed the transition from<br/>
the animal's head to the human body with remarkable skill. The<br/>
god frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>a wife and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">son</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and in that case this <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called<br/>
</span>Triad dwelt and was worshipped in one temple. Divine families<br/>
of this kind are exemplified in Ptah, god of Memphis, with his wife<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sekhmet </span>and his son Nefertem, and by Osiris, Isis, and Horus.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Atum</span>, the local deity of Heliopolis, had as many as eight <span style="color: #0000FF;">companions </span>assigned to him; and the worship of the nine gods became<br/>
so popular that it was adopted in many different localities, the<br/>
place of Atum being taken by the local god in each.<br/>
<br/>
Human passions and virtues were attributed to the gods; and<br/>
numerous tales were told by the faithful of the divine exploits and<br/>
adventures. Unfortunately most of these myths have perished; <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the few that have come down to us the best known is the story of<br/>
Osiris, which in antiquity also was one of the most widely spread.<br/>
Osiris ruled as king over Egypt and the country enjoyed the blessings of prosperity. But Set, his wicked brother, <span style="color: #ff0000;">consPired </span>against<br/>
him, and at a banquet persuaded him to enter a cunningly wrought<br/>
chest, which he and his seventy-two accomplices then closed and<br/>
threw into the Nile. The river carried the chest down to the sea,<br/>
and the waves at length washed it ashore near the Phoenician Byblos. Meanwhile Isis roamed in distress throughout the country,<br/>
seeking her lost husband; and she at length succeeded in discovering<br/>
his <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoffin</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>she carried to a sequestered spot and concealed.<br/>
She then set out to visit her son Horus, who was being educated at<br/>
Buto. During her absence Set, while engaged in a boar-hunt, found<br/>
the body of his brother, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cut </span>it into fourteen pieces, and scattered<br/>
them in every direction. As soon as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">learned </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">what </span>had happened,<br/>
