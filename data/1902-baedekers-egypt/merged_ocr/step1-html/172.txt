<span>BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Clxi<br/>
<br/>
</span>corresponding to the atrium of a Byzantine basilica, lie four <span style="color: #ff0000;">flatroofed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">llwan</span>), used for <span style="color: #0000FF;">prayers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The Chief <span style="color: #ff0000;">Liw6n </span>or<br/>
Sanctuary, placed on the side next Mecca, has usually four or five<br/>
aisles, the others never more than two. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">CRUCIFORM </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MOSQUE</span>,<br/>
a new form invented in Persia, was introduced into Egypt about the<br/>
end of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>12th cent. by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eyyubide </span>Saladin. This was developed<br/>
from the previous simple form by the construction of additional<br/>
chambers at the four corners of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">liwans</span>, in such a way that the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">liwans</span>, now covered with massive waggon-vaults, formed the four<br/>
arms of a cross. Comp. the plan of the mosque of Sultan Hasan<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">50</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. These <span style="color: #0000FF;">liwans </span>were used as <span style="color: #0000FF;">school-rooms</span>, whence arose<br/>
the name <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medreseh</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">or'sehool-mosque</span>'. - Towards the close of<br/>
the Mameluke supremacy still another form arose, used, however,<br/>
only for small mosques. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-liwans </span>were shortened and the<br/>
central court so contracted that it could be roofed over and lighted<br/>
from the top. The four arms of the cross were covered with flat<br/>
roofs, like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades </span>in the original form of mosque, while the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">waggon-vaulting </span>was represented merely by <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>transverse rib on the<br/>
side next the court (pomp<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>plan of the mosque of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fim-Bey</span>, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">67</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>.<br/>
<br/>
With the conquest of Egypt by the Turks under Selim <span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, the<br/>
Turkish-Byzantine style of architecture also made its appearance in<br/>
that country. The four <span style="color: #0000FF;">liwans </span>were superseded by a single <span style="color: #ff0000;">sanetuary</span>, consisting of a main building covered with domes and usually<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">preceded </span>by a second <span style="color: #ff0000;">court..<br/>
<br/>
</span>The smaller prayer-rooms, frequently added to private houses<br/>
and not unlike the Christian chapels, were known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">ZÃ©wiyeh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We now turn to inspect the Internal Equipment of the mosque.<br/>
The centre of the court was originally occupied by a fountain, bee<br/>
neath a <span style="color: #0000FF;">canopy </span>supported upon columns. This was intended for<br/>
ornament only, for the prescribed ablutions were performed at a<br/>
special basin (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mh.la</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>an adjoining court. Under Turkish rule<br/>
the fountain was frequently replaced by an apparatus provided<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">taps </span>and known as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haneffyeh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The sanctuary contains the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kibla </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Milmib</span>, the prayer-niche<br/>
turned towards Mecca. Here also we observe: <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>) the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mimbar</span>, or<br/>
pulpit, to the right of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kibla</span>, usually embellished with ornamental panels and <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">7</span>) the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kursi </span>(p1. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kertisij</span>, the<br/>
seat of the Imam, together with a desk, on which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>(which<br/>
is kept at other times in a cabinet of its own) lies open during<br/>
divine service; <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dikkeh</span>, a podium borne by columns, and<br/>
surrounded by a low railing, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moballain </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span>assistants<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Khatib) repeat the words of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran</span>, which is read at the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kibla</span>, for the benefit of the people at a distance; (<span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span>) the various<br/>
lamps and lanterns (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tamir</span>, large chandelier; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thoraiya</span>, lit.'seven<br/>
stars', <span style="color: #0000FF;">small </span>chandelier; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ftsttiis</span>, lamp; Kandil, small oil-lamp).<br/>
<br/>
The Exterior of the earliest mosques was absolutely plain. The<br/>
court was enclosed by a simple <span style="color: #0000FF;">battlemented </span>wall and was entered<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'___</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>1<br/>
