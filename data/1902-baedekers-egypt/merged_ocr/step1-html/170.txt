<span>BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS. Clix<br/>
<br/>
the shaft and the abacus, are the only evidence of any effort towards<br/>
originality in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">direction</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The most prominent characteristic peculiarities <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">arehitecture </span>are the following:<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>. The introduction of the pointed arch as the dominating<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">aesthetic </span>characteristic (Mosque of Ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tou</span>) and the employment<br/>
of the Byzantine stilted round <span style="color: #0000FF;">arch</span>, as well as of the round and<br/>
pointed horseshoe arch, the scalloped arch, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">clover-leaf </span>arch, and<br/>
the'keel' arch. These (with the exception of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scolloped </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">clover-leaf </span>arches) were accompanied by <span style="color: #0000FF;">corresponding </span>forms of<br/>
domes.<br/>
<br/>
2. The development of the form of tower known as the minaret.<br/>
<br/>
3. The refining of various forms of pinnacles that occur also in<br/>
early Egypt, Assyria, Phoenicia, and Persia.<br/>
<br/>
4. The employment in facades of two colours, by alternate<br/>
courses of red and white limestone or (in later examples) of black<br/>
and white marble.<br/>
<br/>
5. The invention of the elegant wooden balconies and the<br/>
system of closing window-openings with wooden gratings (mushrebiyehs) or with plaster or stone gratings in Arabian patterns<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">hamariyehs</span>).<br/>
<br/>
6. The development of <span style="color: #0000FF;">surface </span>ornaments into geometrical<br/>
patterns of every kind (<span style="color: #0000FF;">entrelacs</span>) or <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonventionalized </span>foliage (arabesques strictly <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called</span>); the use of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabic </span>ornamental inscriptions<br/>
on friezes and medallions; and the treatment of <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall-surfaces </span>and<br/>
ceilings in rich polychrome hues, whether by painting, <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation</span>,<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosaic</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The chief monuments of Arabian architecture in Egypt are the<br/>
religious <span style="color: #ff0000;">edifiees </span>(mosques) and the tombs.<br/>
<br/>
The period within which these were built extends from the<br/>
accession of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulunide </span>sultans to the conquest of Egypt by the<br/>
Turks. The earlier mosques have disappeared, leaving hardly a<br/>
trace behind, and our knowledge of them depends upon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">obviously </span>exaggerated and often confused descriptions of the Arabic<br/>
writers. The later mosques are of little artistic value. Some <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>them display a union of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Turlrishiabie </span>architectural forms with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian-Arabic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ornamentation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The only existing building dating from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">TULUNIDE </span>PERIOD<br/>
is the mosque of Ahmed Ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tuhin </span>(p. 53). The oldest plaster decorations in this mosque display a system of ornamentation, the<br/>
various elements in which remain, as in the antique, separate and<br/>
distinct, though some of them are so unusual in form as to defy<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ts1asisifieation </span>under any known style.<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">FETIMITE </span>PERIOD that followed<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the characteristic intertwined geometrical patterns, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">spaces </span>filled up by Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">ornamentation </span>showing a tendency to the Byzantine style, begin to<br/>
appear. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bricks </span>ceased to he the exclusive building material and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
