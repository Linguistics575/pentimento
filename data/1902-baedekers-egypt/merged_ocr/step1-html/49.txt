or simply a blanket of sheep's wool (<span style="color: #ff0000;">lyrdm</span>), and lastly a <span style="color: #ff0000;">closefitting </span>felt <span style="color: #0000FF;">skull-cap </span>(libdeh). He is generally barefooted, but <span style="color: #ff0000;">oeoasionally </span>wears pointed red <span style="color: #ff0000;">fserlnn</span>), or broad yellow shoes (<span style="color: #0000FF;">balgha</span>).<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékhs </span>and wealthier peasants wear wide, black <span style="color: #ff0000;">woollen </span>cloaks<br/>
and the thick <span style="color: #0000FF;">red </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tunisian</span>' fez (<span style="color: #ff0000;">tarbzish</span>) with a blue silk tassel,<br/>
round which they coil a white or red turban <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'immeh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. In their hands<br/>
they usually carry a long and thick stick <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ntdrikt</span>), made of ash imported from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caramania</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">All </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">watchmen </span>carry similar sticks as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">bad </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ge<br/>

<br/>
The sole wealth of Egypt is derived from its agriculture, and to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin </span>alone is committed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">importanttask </span>of tilling the soil.<br/>
They are, indeed, neither <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitted </span>nor inclined for other work, a circumstance which proves how completely the stationary character of the<br/>
ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptia </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ns </span>has predominated over the restless Arabian blood,<br/>
which has been largely infused into the native population ever since<br/>
the valley <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile was conquered by the armies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam</span>. The<br/>
ancient Egyptian racial type has been preserved in extraordinary<br/>
purity in many fella ]; families, especially in Upper Egypt. This is<br/>
particularly evident in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of the children and <span style="color: #0000FF;">women</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>whose<br/>
features are not concealed and distorted by veils (which the ancient<br/>
Egyptians <span style="color: #0000FF;">despised</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>Even among the Berbers (p. xlv)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>between<br/>
the first and second cataracts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">feces </span>occur that might almost lead us<br/>
to think that some of the pictures of the period of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">old </span>Pharaohs<br/>
had come <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>life, and stood before us in flesh and blood. The modern<br/>
Egyptians, moreover, resemble the ancient in the lot to Which they<br/>
are condemned. In ancient times the <span style="color: #ff0000;">felléh</span>, pressed into the service<br/>
of the priests and the princes, was compelled to yield up to them<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fruits </span>of his toil, and his position is nearly the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>present<br/>
day, save that the names of his masters are changed, and he has<br/>
obtained some relief owing to the almost entire abolition of compulsory work.<br/>
<br/>
In early life the Egyptian peasant is remarkably docile, active,<br/>
and intelligent, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>at a later period this freshness and buoyancy are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">crushed </span>out of him by care and poverty and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">never-ceasing </span>task<br/>
of filling the pitcher of the Dana'ides. He ploughs and reaps, toils<br/>
and amasses, but he cannot with certainty regard his crops as his<br/>
own, and the hardly earned piastre is too frequently wrested from<br/>
him. His character, therefore, becomes like that <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>gifted child,<br/>
who has been harshly used and brought up to <span style="color: #0000FF;">domestic </span>slavery, but<br/>
at length perceives that he has been treated with injustice, and<br/>
whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">amiability </span>and intelligence are then superseded by <span style="color: #ff0000;">snllenness<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">obstinacy</span>. Thus down to a few years ago, as in the time of<br/>
Ammianus Marcellinus, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah </span>would often suffer the most cruel<br/>
blows in dogged silence rather than pay the taxes demanded of him.<br/>
<br/>
In his own <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>industrious labourer, and his<br/>
work is more continuous than that of the peasant of more northern<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">countries </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>enjoys no period of repose during the winter, and the<br/>
<br/>
