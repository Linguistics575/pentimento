</span>c. THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">NORTHERN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BUILDINGS</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The ruins to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>of the Temple of Ammon are in such bad <span style="color: #0000FF;">preservation </span>that the traveller who has little time at his disposal may content<br/>
himself with a glance at the great N. girdle-wall of Nile-bricks, and at<br/>
the N. gateway.<br/>
<br/>
Beginning at the E, gateway (see p. 255), we skirt the <span style="color: #ff0000;">girdlewall </span>of the great temple of Ammon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and then to the W.<br/>
(left), until we see upon the right or <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>side of our path another<br/>
girdle-wall of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-bricks</span>. Passing through a gateway in the latter,<br/>
adorned with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouche </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekht-Har-ehbét </span>(p. lxxxvii), we<br/>
reach the<br/>
Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mont</span>, which, though not inferior in size to the temple<br/>
of Khons (p. 243), is now so ruined that its ground-plan can scarcely<br/>
be made out. The temple was built for the war-god Mont or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mentu<br/>
</span>by Amenophis III. (18th Dyn.), though it was subsequently several<br/>
times enlarged between the reign of Ramses II. and the epoch of the<br/>
Ptolemies, especially by Euergetes <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. The temple stood upon a <span style="color: #ff0000;">platform </span>of masonry, traces of which still remain<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The earlier sculptures<br/>
and architectural fragments are of great beauty; and columns with<br/>
Hathor capitals were also employed. Two <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span>of red granite<br/>
once stood in front of the N. entrance, upon bases that are still in situ.<br/>
The N. gateway, built of granite, dates from Ptolemy Philadelphos.<br/>
<br/>
From the granite gateway we proceed to the S.W., passing the<br/>
remains of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>Temple, of which the staircase is still to<br/>
be seen, to Six Small Chapels, each of which is entered by a sandstone gateway (without inscription) in the girdle-wall<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Only the two<br/>
chapels farthest to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>have left any considerable remains. The<br/>
second from the W. contains the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenertais</span>, with that of<br/>
her brother Shabako. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>alabaster statue of the queen, now<br/>
in the museum at Gizeh (p. 87), was found here.<br/>
<br/>
Re-entering the precinct of the temple of Ammon by a gateway<br/>
in its S. girdle-wall, we notice immediately to our left a Temple<br/>
of Ptah, patron-god of Memphis. It was built by Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill.<br/>
</span>and enlarged and restored by Shabako the Ethiopian and by <span style="color: #0000FF;">several<br/>
</span>of the Ptolemies.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">As </span>we approach from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">w.</span>, we reach five successive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gateway</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, of<br/>
which the second and fourth (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. a and b) were built by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shabako</span>, whose<br/>
names have been scratched out, the others by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Ptolemy. Farther on is a<br/>
Corridor, running between two <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span>(with rich foliage capitals) connected by a balustrade. The Pylon at the end of the corridor has a portal<br/>
bearing the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thutmesis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11L</span>, restored in the Ptolemaic period.<br/>
This admits to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Court </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span>), embellished at the back with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">portieo<br/>
</span>supported by two sixteen-sided columns. Two <span style="color: #0000FF;">altars </span>stand here, dedicated<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemhét </span>I. and Thutmosis m. In the walls are ancient recesses.<br/>
A staircase ascends to the upper story. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">doorway </span>(with restored reliefs<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span>.), in the main axis of the temple, leads into the Sanctuary,<br/>
which retains the original reliefs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thuimosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">HL </span>To the right is a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">room </span>with a statue of the lion-headed goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sekhmet-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to the left, another<br/>
with a well-preserved ceiling and ancient reliefs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- It<br/>
is instructive to observe the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difference </span>in style between the ancient and<br/>
the restored reliefs.<br/>
