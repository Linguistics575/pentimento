<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">SEMNEH</span>. 35. Route. 379<br/>
<br/>
one of <span style="color: #0000FF;">these</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s.</span>, are the ruins of an Arab castle. Alternately<br/>
skirting the river and traversing the desert for another hour, we<br/>
next reach Shalfak, with a well-preserved fortress of the Middle<br/>
Empire.<br/>
<br/>
The third day's route also leads through the desert, from the<br/>
heights in which we have occasional glimpses of the river-valley.<br/>
In 2 hrs. we <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>ourselves opposite the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rocky </span>island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uronarti<br/>
</span>('king's island<span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, on the N. end of which are the ruins of a fortress<br/>
of the Middle Empire and of a chapel built by Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>. On<br/>
the W. side of the island are considerable rapids. In 2 hrs. more<br/>
we reach Semneh, which marked the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s. </span>limit of Egypt under the<br/>
Middle Empire. On the top of the hill are massive fortifications,<br/>
with well-preserved girdle-walls. Within the latter is a temple,<br/>
built by Thutmosis III. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatshepsowet </span>and dedicated to the<br/>
Nubian deity Tetun. The river, here flowing between granite cliffs,<br/>
forms numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">rapids..</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the E. bank, opposite Semneh, lies<br/>
the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kummeh</span>, to which the traveller is ferried on a raft.<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kummeh </span>are a ruined fortress of the Middle Empire and a<br/>
temple of the same date as that <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Semneh. The numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>on both banks of the stream are interesting, especially those<br/>
of the end of the 12th and of the 13th Dyn. with flood-marks, from<br/>
which it would appear that the Nile used to rise about 23 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>higher<br/>
than it does <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>present. The explanation probably is that the river<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>that <span style="color: #0000FF;">epo.eh </span>retarded by some natural barriers a little lower<br/>
down, which it afterwards succeeded in sweeping away.<br/>
