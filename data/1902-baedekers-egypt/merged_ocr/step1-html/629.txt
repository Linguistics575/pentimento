<span>330 Route 29. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assm'iN</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Quarries</span>.<br/>
<br/>
On the summit of the hill to the right of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">road </span>are some large<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">musque-like </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cenotaph</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of famous saints, such as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shekh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mirlrrntid</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ShEkh'Ali</span>, the Lady (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Seyidneh</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zenab</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ete</span>, whose memory is celebrated<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>festivals on their birthdays, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Granite Quarries (Arabic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ma'ddt'nj</span>, from which the ancient<br/>
Egyptian builders and sculptors drew their supplies (comp. p. 328),<br/>
are situated in the hills to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S</span>, and may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>reached in 1/4 hr.<br/>
either direct from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bishirin </span>camp or from the town by a route<br/>
leading <span style="color: #0000FF;">via </span>the Arab cemeteries (p. 329) and then to the E., passing<br/>
a grove of tamarisks. Numerous blocks of granite lie where they<br/>
were left when the works were given <span style="color: #0000FF;">up</span>; <span style="color: #ff0000;">6.9. </span>the huge <span style="color: #ff0000;">block </span>(marked<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-obelisk</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the Plan) in the N. Quarry, measuring 92 ft. in length<br/>
and 101/2 ft. in breadth at the broadest part. A moderately lofty<br/>
cliff shows manifold traces of the industry of the ancient stonecutters. The blocks were detached from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliffs </span>by boring numerous holes along a prescribed line, driving wedges into these, and<br/>
then wetting the wedges. By this process <span style="color: #0000FF;">tolerably </span>smooth and<br/>
even fractures were obtained. Frequently the blocks were finished<br/>
on three sides before being finally detached. Statues, <span style="color: #ff0000;">sareophagi</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete.</span>, were also roughly worked over by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone-cutters<br/>
</span>in the quarries in order to lessen the weight for transport. The hill<br/>
above the N. quarry commands a wide prospect, including the convent of St. Simeon (p. 334) in a desert-valley, to the W., beyond<br/>
the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
The S. Quarry, 1/2 hr. farther to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s.</span>, contains still more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rough-hewn </span>sculptures, ready for removal. The quarry opens to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>, facing the desert. On a rock here may be seen an <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>with the name of Amenophis 111., though the name and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ftg11re<br/>
</span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone-cutter </span>who carved it have been obliterated. Beside it<br/>
two trough-shaped sarcophagi have been begun (in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic<br/>
</span>or in the Roman period); and in the vicinity are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">11nfir1ished<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">colossus </span>of a king (covered, except the feet, with sand), and <span style="color: #ff0000;">alarge<br/>
</span>quadrangular block, perhaps intended for the shrine of a god. Farther on, near the railway, and towards the top of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliff</span>, is a figure<br/>
of Osiris (called Ramses by the natives), about 20 ft. in height.<br/>
This point commands a fine view of the desert and in the direction<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Phila.<br/>
<br/>
A massive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Embanked </span>Road, by which the huge blocks were<br/>
conveyed to the Nile, runs from the quarries to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuirn </span>and is used<br/>
to this day<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>If we follow the railway-line we reach the railwaystation of <span style="color: #ff0000;">She1ltl </span>(p. 335) in 1/4 hr<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The verdant island <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Elephantine, with its luxuriant <span style="color: #ff0000;">palmtrees</span>, attracts all travellers. The Arabs call it merely <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gezireh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>'island', or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Geziret </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Assutn</span>. It is reached by small boat <span style="color: #ff0000;">Crigiikeh</span>)<br/>
in a few min. from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place</span>, and the entire visit takes<br/>
barely an hour. There are two villages on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine</span>, whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">inhabitants </span>speak Nubian.<br/>
