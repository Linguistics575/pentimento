</span>wrestling-ring, and still more from the popular pleasure-resorts in<br/>
the streets; for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrians</span>, notorious for their love <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>pleasure<br/>
and enjoyment of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ridicule</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>took peculiar delight in jugglers <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mountebanks </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>all kinds, and in dwarfs and cripples, etc. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caricatures</span>, sometimes of the most doubtful character. thus form a<br/>
considerable fraction among the productions of this art. At the same<br/>
time the artists preserved also a certain strain of idealism, shown in<br/>
their inclination to present these genre motives in mythological setting, as when they represent Satyrs and Cupids in all kinds of genre<br/>
situations, Aphrodite beating the mischievous Cupid, Hercules staggering home intoxicated from the banquet, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Talent for decorative art is apparent even in these creations. But<br/>
it achieves higher things in the mural frescoes and in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">reliefs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
most developed form of which, the pictorial relief with landscape<br/>
background, also took its <span style="color: #0000FF;">rise </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">under </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of Ptolemaic art.<br/>
Numerous mural paintings in the Greek style have recently come to<br/>
light in the ancient cemeteries of Alexandria, and many of these<br/>
are, <span style="color: #0000FF;">significantly</span>, found beside <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>beneath frescoes in the revived<br/>
Egyptian style<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>When the graves were used a second time the Greek<br/>
paintings were covered with whitewash and the Egyptian frescoes<br/>
were painted on the top. Examples of both styles may <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>seen in the<br/>
museum at Alexandria (Room XI, No. 8). The technical delicacy<br/>
and freshness of conception which <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>still characteristic of Alexandrian painting <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the imperial epoch are apparent in the Portraits<br/>
attached to the heads of mummies, painted on thin wooden tablets,<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">tempera</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>or in encaustic colours<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>or in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>style uniting both these<br/>
methods. The practice of furnishing the mummy-covering with a<br/>
portrait reproducing the features <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the deceased dates from early<br/>
Egyptian times. In the Hellenistic period masks modelled in stucco<br/>
and coloured, or paintings upon wood were chosen for this purpose,<br/>
in order that the features <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the deceased might be portrayed as those<br/>
of a living person. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>cases <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>fact, even in portraits of the<br/>
rudest make, the lifelike expression is surprising. They look as<br/>
though they were executed from the living model, so that the theory<br/>
that they were posthumous portraits is not very probable. At the<br/>
back of some of these portraits a layer of mortar, about an inch in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">thickness</span>, has been found, and in others there are holes, which<br/>
seem to have been meant for nails to fasten the picture to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">wall</span>;<br/>
and from these circumstances we may conclude that portraits of this<br/>
kind used to be painted as ornaments for rooms during the lifetime<br/>
of the persons represented, and that they were removed from the<br/>
wall and placed on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mummy-covering </span>after death, except when<br/>
it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>preferred to substitute <span style="color: #ff0000;">cepies </span>of the originals. From the <span style="color: #0000FF;">investigations </span>which Prof. Georg Ebers has devoted to this class <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>portraits, it would seem that most, if <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>all, of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">specimens </span>yet<br/>
known come from the cemeteries of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayf1m</span>. The persons <span style="color: #0000FF;">18.<br/>
</span>presented are mostly Hellenistic Egyptians of Greek origin, but there<br/>
