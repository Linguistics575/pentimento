<span>PREFACE.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since the attention of the civilized world was redirected to Egypt at the beginning of the 19th century, the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">seientifie </span>investigation of its innumerable monuments has<br/>
pointed with ever-growing certainty to the valley of the Nile<br/>
as the cradle of history and of human culture. At the same<br/>
time Egypt, like other Eastern countries, possesses high natural attractions, in the peculiar charms of its Oriental <span style="color: #ff0000;">elimate</span>, the singularly clear atmosphere, the wonderful <span style="color: #0000FF;">colouring </span>and effects of light and shade, the exuberant fertility<br/>
of the cultivated districts contrasted with the solemn, <span style="color: #ff0000;">aweinspiring </span>desert, and the manners, customs, and appearance<br/>
of a most interesting and most diversified population.<br/>
<br/>
The present fifth edition of the HANDBOOK TO EGYPT<br/>
comprises in its scope the regions previously treated of in<br/>
separate volumes devoted to Lower Egypt and Upper Egypt<br/>
respectively. Though the text has thus been curtailed by at<br/>
least one-third, the Editor believes, that by <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfining </span>himself<br/>
to essential points and by carefully arranging his material,<br/>
he has succeeded in rendering the present edition <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>less<br/>
useful than the previous ones in supplying the traveller with<br/>
the necessary information regarding the country and the<br/>
people he is about to visit, in protecting him against extortion and in rendering him, as far as the nature of the ease<br/>
permits, independent of outside assistance. An attempt has<br/>
been made to indicate clearly the most important among the<br/>
bewildering multiplicity of the monuments of antiquity; and<br/>
the descriptions of these have been so arranged that, assuming the traveller to have previously read at his leisure our<br/>
account of the origin, history, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">signifieanee </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">partieular </span>temple, or tomb, ete., he will find adequate guidance<br/>
on the spot in that portion of our description that is printed<br/>
in larger type, while those who have time and inclination for<br/>
a more thorough examination, will find additional particulars<br/>
in small type. A first visit to the Temple of Dendera, for<br/>
example, may in this manner be accomplished in about an<br/>
hour, which is approximately the time allowed to passengers<br/>
by mail-steamer.<br/>
