<span>HISTORY OF ART. <span style="color: #0000FF;">011<br/>
<br/>
</span>in the representations of the crowds of warriors in these battle<br/>
reliefs, while the actual combats are frequently mere confused<br/>
assemblages of standing and recumbent <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of men and animals,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>all the same we cannot withhold admiration from the keen <span style="color: #ff0000;">faeulty </span>of observation displayed by the artists. And perhaps a good<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">deal </span>of the apparent confusion would disappear if we could see the<br/>
reliefs with all their original colouring. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the SA'iTE <span style="color: #0000FF;">PERIOD </span>the<br/>
works of the Ancient Empire were again selected as models for <span style="color: #ff0000;">sinllptures </span>in this branch of the plastic art, though no attempt was made<br/>
to rival the ancient masters with actual <span style="color: #0000FF;">copies</span>. But all the same<br/>
the reliefs of this period offer <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pleasing </span>contrast to the rude <span style="color: #ff0000;">produetions </span>of the reign of Ramses IL, in their delicate and exact "<span style="color: #ff0000;">tyelltion</span>, and in a certain elegance and a charming softness of form.<br/>
Art under the PTOLEMIES was at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>content to follow in the track<br/>
of the Saite artists; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>it gradually grew more and more crude,<br/>
and the temple-walls were <span style="color: #ff0000;">overladen </span>with rows of tasteless reliefs.<br/>
The figures of men <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>gods in these became heavy and shapeless,<br/>
so that their features and limbs have a swollen appearance. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Unfortunately </span>the reliefs of this late period of Egyptian art are the most<br/>
numerous and most conspicuous in Upper Egypt, and thus it is that<br/>
the traveller is inclined to assign to Egyptian sculpture a much<br/>
lower rank than even its mediocre productions deserve.<br/>
<br/>
In the practice of the Artistic Handicrafts Egypt was <span style="color: #0000FF;">perfect<br/>
</span>The goldsmiths and workers in metal in particular had attained the<br/>
most <span style="color: #0000FF;">complete </span>mastery of their craft; they thoroughly understood<br/>
all its ancillary arts, such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">enamelling </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damascene </span>work, and<br/>
they were thus able to produce works of a degree of finish such as<br/>
a highly civilised nation alone could execute and appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller should note the <span style="color: #0000FF;">signifieation </span>of some of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SYM-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BOLS </span>and SIGNS most commonly used in the ornamentation of the<br/>
<br/>
columns and other parts of the Egyptian temples. Thus, is the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">creek </span>or shepherd's <span style="color: #0000FF;">staff</span>, the emblem of the leader or monarch<span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>a scourge, the symbol of kingly power. Then, the symbol<br/>
of life<span style="color: #0000FF;">;</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>342), the symbol of <span style="color: #0000FF;">steadfastness</span>; the red<br/>
crown of Lower Egypt; (the white crown of Upper Egypt;<br/>
<br/>
the united crown of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt; the blue<br/>
crown of the king; and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uraeus </span>or royal serpent, represented<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>diadems and suns by <span style="color: #0000FF;">105</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Its function was to avert hostile <span style="color: #ff0000;">influenees</span>, just as <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Uraeus </span>serpent had once destroyed with its poison<br/>
the enemies of the sun-god. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">winged </span>sun-disk, <span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span>, the emblem<br/>
