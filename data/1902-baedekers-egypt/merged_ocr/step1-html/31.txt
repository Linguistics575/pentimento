<br/>
The Egyptians <span style="color: #0000FF;">consider </span>themselves a highly musical people. The<br/>
Egyptian sings when indulging in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">kef </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">xxvi</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, whether sitting <span style="color: #0000FF;">un<br/>
</span>his heels or stretched out on his mat, when driving his donkey<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>when<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">carrying </span>stones and mortar up <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">scaffolding</span>, when working in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fiel.dy<br/>
</span>and when rowing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>sings whether alone or in company, regarding <span style="color: #0000FF;">his<br/>
</span>vocal music as a means of lightening his labour and of sweetening his<br/>
repose. A peculiarity <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Egyptian songs, however, is that they have<br/>
no tune, though they have a certain rhythm, which is always dependent<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the text. They are <span style="color: #0000FF;">sang </span>through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nose </span>on seven or eight different<br/>
notes<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>on which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">performer </span>wanders up and down. The character<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>this <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>music is exceedingly monotonous and, to a European ear,<br/>
displeasing. The songs (<span style="color: #ff0000;">mawwdl </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">shzrghl</span>) are all of a lyrical description,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">most </span>of them are erotic and often pointless and meaningless. Some of<br/>
them, however<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>extol the pleasures of <span style="color: #0000FF;">friendship </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>rational enjoyment,<br/>
or express derision of an enemy, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>contempt for the rustic <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah</span>.<br/>

The FEMALE DANCERS, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghauodsi </span>(sing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ghaziyeh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>were formerly one of the chief curiosities of Egypt, but for some years past<br/>
they have been prohibited from performing in the streets. Really<br/>
good dancers are said to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>now rare; the performances in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">caf√©sohantants </span>in Cairo are very inferior.<br/>

performances of a very marvellous character, as credible European<br/>
residents in Cairo have <span style="color: #0000FF;">testifier</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but the traveller will rarely come<br/>
in contact with them except by lucky accident. The men and boys<br/>
who exhibit small snakes in the streets or at the hotels must of<br/>
course not be <span style="color: #0000FF;">confounded </span>with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rifi'tyeh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">JUGGLEns </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Haw</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span>) of Egypt are similar to those of other<br/>
countries. The performances of the BUFFOONS (<span style="color: #ff0000;">lrurtuMti </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohab<br/>

<br/>
The baths of Egypt, with their <span style="color: #0000FF;">hot-air </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers</span>, are those commonly known as Turkish, but they are neither so clean nor so well<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fitted </span>up as some of those in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">larger </span>cities of Europe. A Turkish<br/>
bath is particularly refreshing after a long journey, and is an admirable preventive of colds and rheumatism. The baths are always<br/>
cleanest in the early morning. Fridays are to be avoided, as numerous<br/>
Muslims bathe early on that day, which is their Sabbath. When a<br/>
cloth is hung up at the entrance to the baths, it indicates that<br/>
women only are admitted.<br/>
