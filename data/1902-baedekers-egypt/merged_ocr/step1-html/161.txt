<span>cl HISTORY OF ART.<br/>
<br/>
Egyptian reliefs are either <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bar-Beliefs</span>, the earliest <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-at </span>all<br/>
periods the <span style="color: #ff0000;">commonest </span>form, or Incised Beliefs ('reliefs en creux'),<br/>
to which the design is sunk <span style="color: #ff0000;">helow </span>the surface<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Painting occurs in<br/>
Egypt only as an accompaniment of or as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">suhstitute </span>for sculpture.<br/>
Statues and reliefs were almost invariably painted, and even stones<br/>
that are naturally <span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured</span>, such as granite, basalt, ete., appear to<br/>
have been subjected to this general rule of <span style="color: #0000FF;">polychromatic </span>embellishment. When painting was used instead of sculpture (as, 6.9., in<br/>
the tombs of the 18th Dyn.), it was so either in order to save expense or because the available stone was not suitable for carvings.<br/>
That the same rules of drawing applied to paintings as applied to<br/>
reliefs needs scarcely be stated.<br/>
<br/>
Egyptian relief, like Egyptian statuary, attained its highest<br/>
point under the 5th Dyn. (p. lxxx). The high level of technical <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>artistic skill attained at that period is best illustrated in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastab </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
</span>of Ti and Ptahhotep at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakhara </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">137,139j</span>. Under the 6th Dyn. and<br/>
during the Middle Empire both carving and <span style="color: #0000FF;">composition </span>had <span style="color: #ff0000;">hegun<br/>
</span>to decline, though it must he admitted that the artists of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Benihasan<br/>
</span>(p. 197) added a valuable series of new motives <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>military scenes,<br/>
provincial life, funeral scenes) to the previous list of <span style="color: #0000FF;">subjects</span>. The<br/>
free and naturalistic tendency received a fresh impetus in the middle<br/>
of the 18th Dyn., when the new political relations of Egypt with<br/>
Asia Minor opened up a new horizon to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">artist</span>, and the strange<br/>
importations from foreign countries supplied him with novel suggestions. In particular, the wonderfully faithful representations of<br/>
animal-life during this period may challenge comparison with the<br/>
best achievements of other nations in this direction. The traveller<br/>
will find the finest specimens of these works in the tombs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shf-kh<br/>
</span>Abd <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Kurna </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>288).<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, however, this naturalistic tendency soon ran into<br/>
exaggeration. In the reign of Amenophis IV., doubtless in connection with the religious reformation of that time (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1xxxiO</span>, it found<br/>
its way into the official art of the court and <span style="color: #ff0000;">inf1ueneed </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">representstions </span>of the king and the court, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>it there quickly degenerated<br/>
into mannerism. Reaction was the natural consequence, and a<br/>
return was soon made to the ancient style, hampered as it was with<br/>
its strict rules of composition. But in spite of all traditional stiffness<br/>
of composition and grouping, this reactionary art attained a high<br/>
level once more under Sethos <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, from whose reign date the delicate<br/>
and graceful reliefs in the temple at Abydos. But a rapid decline<br/>
set in under Ramses IL, probably in consequence of the too lavish<br/>
demands made upon artistic resources for the decoration of the numerous new temples. - Although the reaction against the art of<br/>
Amenophis IV. expunged a number of subjects from the list of those<br/>
available in <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>representations, the warlike exploits of the<br/>
monarchs of the 19th and 20th Dyn. provided new material in<br/>
compensation. No advance towards lucidity of grouping is shown<br/>
