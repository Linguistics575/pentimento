22. Dendera.<br/>
<br/>
A hasty visit to the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dendera</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>may be accomplished in 3 hrs.<br/>
Well-equipped donkeys stand in readiness on the bank opposite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Keneh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>there and back 4 <span style="color: #0000FF;">piss.</span>, fee 1 <span style="color: #0000FF;">pias.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The visitor should not <span style="color: #0000FF;">fail </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>be<br/>
provided with candles or (better still) a magnesium lamp for exploring the<br/>
crypts and other parts of the temple.<br/>
<br/>
The distance from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place </span>to the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">21/231</span>.)<br/>
is easily accomplished on donkey-back in 1/2 hr. The route follows<br/>
the Nile to the N. through palm-trees, then proceeds to the W.<br/>
through well-tilled fields to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuous </span>mound of rubbish,<br/>
marking the site of the ruins.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Dendera</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tentyra </span>of the Greeks, is one of the most ancient<br/>
and most famous cities of Egypt, and was the capital of the sixth<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>of Upper Egypt. Its ancient name was Enet, or in its fuller<br/>
form, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Enet-te-nto'ré</span>,'Enet of the Goddess<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. of Hathor), of which<br/>
the Greek and modern Arabic names are <span style="color: #ff0000;">oorruptions</span>. Enet was the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span>seat of the worship of Hathor (the Egyptian Aphrodite), <span style="color: #0000FF;">god-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dess </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">love </span>and joy. Along with her husband, the hawk-headed<br/>
Horus of Edfu, and her son, the youthful Ehi or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Har-sem-tewé<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oras</span>, uniter of both lands'; Gr. Harsomtus), she was worshipped<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnifieent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">temple</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>which remains here to this day. Her<br/>
chief <span style="color: #0000FF;">festival </span>synchronized with the great Feast of the New Year.<br/>
<br/>
The gate, to which our road leads and where the cards of admission (see p. 184) are shown, forms the N. termination of the<br/>
wall of Nile bricks enclosing the temple. The total enclosure is<br/>
317 yds. long and 306 yds. wide, and besides the large Temple<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather </span>contains a small Sanctuary of Isis and a <span style="color: #ff0000;">so-oalled </span>Birth<br/>
House (p. 231). The <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>Gate was built under the Emp. Domitian,<br/>
who is here named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Germanieus</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the side next the temple<br/>
appear the names of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nerve </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Trajanus</span>, also with the epithet of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Germanieus </span>(Trajan is here also called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Daoieus</span>). There is another<br/>
similar gate on the E. side; while beyond the <span style="color: #ff0000;">temple-preeinets</span>, also<br/>
to the E., is a third gate, dating from the Roman imperial epoch.<br/>
<br/>
From the N. gate a passage between modern brick walls leads<br/>
to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Temple </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span>, which, though now deeply sunk in the<br/>
accumulated rubbish of centuries, is in better preservation than<br/>
any other large ancient Egyptian temple except those of Edfu and<br/>
Philae. It was built in the first century <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. during the reigns of<br/>
the later <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies </span>and of Augustus; but it occupies the site of an<br/>
older edifice, going back traditionally to the earliest period of Egyptian history, and added to or altered not only by the kings of the<br/>
12th Dyn., but also by the great monarchs of the New Empire,<br/>
such as Thutmosis <span style="color: #ff0000;">lil.</span>, Ramses IL, and Ramses III. The decoration<br/>
of the temple-walls with reliefs took place at a still more recent<br/>
date. In accordance with the plan of other temples (comp. Pl. of<br/>
Edfu, p. 314), a colonnade and two large pylons should stand in<br/>
<br/>
