<span>its Side Streets. <span style="color: #0000FF;">CAIRU</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">d. </span>Route. 43<br/>
<br/>
said to contain the head of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hos√©n</span>. The head is said to have been<br/>
brought to Cairo in a green silk bag. This tomb-mosque is <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly<br/>
</span>frequented by men on Thursdays, and by women on Saturdays.<br/>
<br/>
On leaving the mosque we turn into the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mashdad </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Rest</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P1</span>. E, 3), cross the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sikkeh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Gedideh </span>(p. 42) obliquely, and enter<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SHABI'A </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">EL-T-ss</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3</span>), which is mainly occupied by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>score or more stalls of the Booksellers.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the booksellers are also scholars, and their shops are the resort<br/>
of the learned world of Cairo. As the prices of books vary greatly in<br/>
accordance with the demand and other circumstances and there is no<br/>
such thing as a fixed publishing price, purchasers should always <span style="color: #0000FF;">endeavour </span>to ascertain beforehand the true value of any work they <span style="color: #0000FF;">wish </span>to<br/>
buy. As in the case of many other <span style="color: #ff0000;">wares</span>, the line between new and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">selyoni1-hand </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">books </span>is not <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>strictly drawn in the East as in Europe.<br/>
The booksellers generally keep catalogues, several feet in length, to<br/>
refresh their memories regarding the state of their stock. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran</span>,<br/>
which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">shown </span>very reluctantly to <span style="color: #0000FF;">non-Muslims</span>, is kept separate <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
</span>the other books. The books are not arranged side hy side as in <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>shops, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>piled up in a very <span style="color: #0000FF;">inconvenient </span>fashion. Many of them<br/>
are sold in <span style="color: #0000FF;">loose </span>sheets, in which case the purchaser should see that<br/>
the work is complete, as gaps are of frequent occurrence. The bindings<br/>
usually consist of leather <span style="color: #0000FF;">0r </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pasteboard</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Valuable <span style="color: #0000FF;">books </span>are often kept<br/>
in cases of red sheepskin, <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>of which they are drawn by means of a<br/>
loop. - The workmanship of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bookbinders</span>, who, like other Oriental<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">artisans</span>, work in the open street, is far inferior to European <span style="color: #0000FF;">productions<br/>
</span>Red is their favourite colour.<br/>
<br/>
We now proceed to the left to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>entrance of the Mosque<br/>
of Azhar.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">amussi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eI-Azhar </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">P </span>E, 3, 4), the'blooming', the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mostimportant </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">monument </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite </span>period, was completed <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">973 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A.D.<br/>
</span>by Gohar, the vizier <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite </span>Sultan Mu'izz, and was converted<br/>
into a University in <span style="color: #ff0000;">988 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">by </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rhattt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-uzis </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">xciv</span>). The rectangular<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ground-plan </span>of the original building is easily recognizable, but<br/>
it has been so frequently restored that no part of it can <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>said<br/>
to date actually from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite </span>period except the central part<br/>
of the sanctuary, with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">cupolas</span>. Everything outside this rectangle<br/>
is known positively to be of later date. The characteristic old<br/>
ornamentation of the arcades and cupolas deserves special attention;<br/>
that of the walls has been for the most part renewed after vanished<br/>
patterns. The arcades of the court (<span style="color: #0000FF;">salm</span>) were rebuilt under the<br/>
Khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tewfig </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">scrupulous </span>reproduction of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">old </span>style and<br/>
the retention of the old <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span>- The successive rulers <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
</span>have emulated each other in maintaining and <span style="color: #0000FF;">enlarging </span>this venerable<br/>
building. In the 18th cent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">thdwealthy'Abd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er-Rahman </span>added four<br/>
aisles to the sanctury, and in more recent days <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id </span>Pasha and the<br/>
Khedives <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewttlr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and'Abbts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>have been notable benefactors of<br/>
the mosque.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Abbas </span>II. erected a new building in place of the<br/>
dilapidated N.W. side of the mosque, and his <span style="color: #ff0000;">neo-Arab </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fapade<br/>
</span>is practically the only one the mosque boasts, the other sides being<br/>
all quite unpretentious and concealed in narrow lanes.<br/>
<br/>
The principal entrance (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, where strangers receive a guide,<br/>
is on the N.W. side, and is called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bdh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-hfumsyintn</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'Gate </span>of the<br/>
