Remarks on Mohammedan Customs.<br/>
<br/>
The birth of a child is celebrated on the seventh day of its life<br/>
by a domestic festival, attended by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">h√©di </span>or some learned theologian, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>dissolves in his mouth a piece of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar-candy </span>presented<br/>
to him by the host and drops a little of his sweetened saliva into<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">infant</span>'s mouth, as if to give it a sweet foretaste of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">world's<br/>
</span>gifts, and also for the purpose of'giving it a name out of his mouth'.<br/>
Muslims, it is well known, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>usually named by their <span style="color: #0000FF;">praenomens<br/>
</span>only. If a more precise designation is desired, the name of the<br/>
father is placed after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">praenomen</span>, with or without the word ibn<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">'sonof</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">placed </span>between the names. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nicknames</span>, such as'the <span style="color: #0000FF;">oneeyed</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>, are also not uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
When the child is forty days old the mother takes it to the bath,<br/>
and causes forty bowls of water <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty-niue </span>if a girl) to be poured<br/>
over it. This bath forms the <span style="color: #0000FF;">purification </span>of both mother and child.<br/>
<br/>
The rite of circumcision is performed on boys up to the age of<br/>
six <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>seven, or even later, the ceremony being attended with great<br/>
pomp. The child is previously <span style="color: #0000FF;">conducted </span>through the streets in holiday<br/>
attire, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">procession </span>being frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">united </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>some bridal party,<br/>
in order to diminish the expense of the proceedings. The boy <span style="color: #0000FF;">generally </span>wears a turban of red <span style="color: #0000FF;">cashmere</span>, girls' clothes of the richest<br/>
possible description, and conspicuous female ornaments, which are<br/>
designed to attract attention, and thus avert the evil eye from his<br/>
person. He half covers his face with an embroidered handkerchief;<br/>
and the barber who performs the operation and a noisy troop of<br/>
musicians head the procession. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>personage <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the procession<br/>
is usually the barber's boy, carrying <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'lieml</span>', or barber's sign, a<br/>
kind of cupboard made of wood, in the form <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a <span style="color: #ff0000;">haltueyliader</span>, with<br/>
four short legs. The flat front of the hem ] is adorned with pieces<br/>
of looking-glass and embossed brass, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the back is covered with<br/>
a curtain. Two or more boys are often thus paraded together, being<br/>
usually driven in a carriage and attended by music.<br/>
<br/>
Girls are generally married in their 12th or 13th, and sometimes as early as their 10th year. A man in search of a bride<br/>
employs the services of a relative, or of a professional female<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">match-maker</span>, and he never has an opportunity of seeing his bride<br/>
until the wedding-day, except when the parties belong to the<br/>
lowest classes. When everything is arranged, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">affianeed </span>bridegroom has to pay a <span style="color: #0000FF;">bridal-portion </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">main</span>) amounting to about 25 <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>,<br/>
more being paid when the bride is a spinster than if she is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">widow</span>.<br/>
Generally speaking, about two-thirds of the sum, the amount<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>always forms a subject of lively discussion, is paid<br/>
down, while <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-third </span>is settled upon the wife, being payable on<br/>
the death of the husband, or on his divorcing her against her will.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">marriage-eontraet </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>complete. Before the wedding the<br/>
bride is conducted in gala attire and with great ceremony to the<br/>
bath. This procession is <span style="color: #ff0000;">called'Zef'et </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilammiim</span>'. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">headed<br/>
