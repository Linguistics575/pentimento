<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dram</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>THE SPHINX. 8. Route. 123<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">12</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>ft. broad, and, owing to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unevenness </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the rock from which the<br/>
pavement has been removed, varies from 13 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>to 13 ft. <span style="color: #0000FF;">bin</span>. in height.<br/>
<br/>
In the pavement of the chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mouth </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">former1y </span>covered) of<br/>
a shaft 30 ft. in length, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span>a fine granite lining at its upper end<br/>
and could be closed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">trap-door </span>at its lower end. It is continued by<br/>
a horizontal shaft, 10 ft. in length, to the Tomb Chamber (P1. i). Immediately before the latter is reached, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight </span>of seven steps leads to the<br/>
right to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>chamber with recesses 0n the right and back walls. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb<br/>
</span>chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>paved with blocks of granite, <span style="color: #ff0000;">21/2 </span>ft. in thickness, and its<br/>
ceiling has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">formed </span>by placing the stones against <span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span>other at an<br/>
angle so as to resemble <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ruef</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and then hollowing them out on the inside<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">form </span>of a Gothic arch. The richly decorated <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menkewrii </span>was found here by Col. Vyse in a good state of preservation. It<br/>
was externally 2 ft. 7 in. high. The lid was gone. Fragments of the inner<br/>
wooden coffin and of the royal mummy (now in the British Museum)<br/>
were found in the chamber <span style="color: #ff0000;">e. </span>The vessel in which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus </span>was<br/>
being <span style="color: #0000FF;">conveyed </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">England </span>was unfortunately lost off the coast of Spain.<br/>
<br/>
The original intention of the builder was to construct a pyramid on<br/>
a small scale, containing only the sloping corridor <span style="color: #ff0000;">JK</span>, leading to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber </span>at e, smaller than that now existing. Bat when a larger pyramid was<br/>
projected, the corridor <span style="color: #0000FF;">ab </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>formed, leading first to an <span style="color: #0000FF;">antechamber<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>then to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chamber </span>at e, enlarged by deepening the earlier<br/>
chamber at <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>point. Under the New Empire the interior <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the pyramid<br/>
was ruined by the forcible entry of <span style="color: #0000FF;">treasure-seekers</span>; but probably <span style="color: #0000FF;">during<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suite </span>period a restoration took place. To this restoration are due the<br/>
sloping shaft <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the granite chamber in which <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>sarcophagus of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menkewr7i </span>was concealed, as well as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lower-lying </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rOOm </span>with the recesses.<br/>
<br/>
The Second and Third Pyramids are most conveniently visited in<br/>
the course of the circuit of the Pyramid plateau mentioned on p. 126.<br/>
After inspecting the Great Pyramid visitors usually proceed to the<br/>
Sphinx, which rises from amidst the sand <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>desert about <span style="color: #0000FF;">350 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yds</span>.<br/>
to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>. The path thither leads between the so-called'mortar<br/>
pits' (P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>) and three Small Pyramids of no interest. That in the<br/>
centre (Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, according to Herodotus, was the tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>daughter of<br/>
Kheops; that to the s., according to an inscription preserved in the<br/>
Museum of Gizeh, belonged to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Henwetsen</span>, another daughter of the<br/>
same king.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sphinx </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>which, next to the Pyramids <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves</span>, is the<br/>
most famous monument in this vast burial-ground, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>out of<br/>
the natural rock, and, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>aid from added blocks of stone, has<br/>
been moulded into the shape of a recumbent lion with the head of a<br/>
man. It represents the king, probably <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemh√©t </span>III. (12th Dyn.),<br/>
by whom it may be supposed to have been<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>erected; afterwards it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>taken for the sun-god <span style="color: #ff0000;">J.Tar-ern-Ekhwet </span>('Horus on the horizon'),<br/>
known to the Greeks as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>. In front of the breast originally<br/>
appeared an image of a god, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">weatherworn </span>remains of which<br/>
may still be made out. The head, wearing the royal head-cloth,<br/>
which was originally adorned with the royal serpent, was most<br/>
carefully executed. Now, however, it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">deplorable </span>mutilated<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the<br/>
neck has become too thin, the nose and beard have been broken<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>The Egyptian Sphinx, being of the masculine gender, is represented<br/>
with the head of a ram or of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">man</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>rarely with that of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">woman</span>.<br/>
which is ascribed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>in the Greek myths<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
