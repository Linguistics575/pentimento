were followed by the destruction of many pagan statues and the<br/>
obliteration of many pagan inscriptions. The Nile, which annually<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">overflowed </span>as far as the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Karnak</span>, and the saline <span style="color: #ff0000;">exudatinns<br/>
</span>of the soil, wrought harm; jackals and other animals sought shelter<br/>
in the subterranean chambers; many tombs, at first occupied by<br/>
Christian hermits, were converted into peasants' dwellings; Christian<br/>
churches were erected in the temple-halls, and houses were built<br/>
between the columns of the temple at Luxor. Carefully hewn blocks<br/>
and slabs were removed from the monuments, which were used as<br/>
quarries, and many limestone details were thrown into the furnace<br/>
and reduced to lime. Whither the enormous population of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hundred-gated </span>Thebes <span style="color: #ff0000;">betook </span>itself is unknown. A few widely<br/>
scattered villages alone now represent the giant city.<br/>

The main entrance to the temple by the great pylon (p. 239) is now<br/>
closed. We therefore leave the pylon to the last and proceed from the<br/>
road on the bank of the river to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">court </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span>III<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">244</span>) and<br/>
thence through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eelonnade </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">244</span>) to the court of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">u</span>. (p. 240),<br/>
where we begin our inspection ofthe various chambers. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Admission-tickets<br/>
</span>(p. 184) must not be forgotten. In the following description<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>however, the<br/>
pylon is mentioned first. A'Notice <span style="color: #0000FF;">explicative </span>des <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ruines </span>du Temple de<br/>

<br/>
To the S<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>of the town and close to the bank <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile rises<br/>
the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*Temple </span>of Luxor (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. A, B, 3, 4). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">mediaeval </span>and later<br/>
buildings which once encumbered it have been cleared away, though<br/>
the little mosque of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu'l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Haggag </span>still stands within its N. part.<br/>
The temple was built by Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>(18th Dyn.) <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the site of<br/>
an older sanctuary of sandstone, and was dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, his<br/>
wife <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mat</span>, and their son, the moon-god Khons. Like all Egyptian<br/>
temples, it included the sanctuaries with their adjoining rooms and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">anteehambers</span>, a large hypostyle hall, and an open peristyle court.<br/>
The last was to have been preceded by a large hypostyle hall with<br/>
three aisles, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>only the central row of columns was erected at the<br/>
death of the king. The temple was then 207 yds. in length, while<br/>
its greatest breadth was 60 yds. Opposite the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple </span>was a granite<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chapel </span>(p. 240), <span style="color: #0000FF;">erected </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>During the religious<br/>
revolution under Amenophis IV. (p. 203) the representations and<br/>
name of Ammon were <span style="color: #0000FF;">obliterated</span>, and a sanctuary of the'Sun' was<br/>
built beside the temple. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tut-eukh-Amon </span>(p. lxxxii) transferred the<br/>
royal residence back to Thebes, and caused the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished </span>great<br/>
hypostyle hall to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>hastily completed and the walls to be decorated<br/>
with reliefs (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">MI</span>), in which Haremheb afterwards substituted<br/>
his own name for that of his predecessor. The'Temple of the Sun'<br/>
was destroyed, and in the reign of Sethos the <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of Ammon<br/>
