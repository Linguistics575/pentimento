<br/>
Between this temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptah </span>and the great hypostyle hall of the<br/>
temple of Ammon are the remains of three small Chapels of the Late<br/>
Period, all entered from the E.<br/>
<br/>
The southernmost and largest was built <span style="color: #0000FF;">towards </span>the close of the<br/>
26th Dyn. by the majordomo <span style="color: #ff0000;">Peteneit</span>. In the doorway we see <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psammetikh </span>III. and the Queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Enkh-nes-nefer-eb-ré </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>and<br/>
other gods. Beyond is a hall built <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofbrielr</span>, with four <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone </span>columns. To<br/>
the right of the entrance to the Sanctuary is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nitocris</span>, wife of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psemmetikh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, to the left is Amasis. - The central chapel was erected by an<br/>
otherwise unknown <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheshonk </span>in the reign of Amasis, who is <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented<br/>
</span>on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">left </span>jamb of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance-door</span>. On the right <span style="color: #ff0000;">jarnh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">is </span>Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iilnkhnes-nefer-eb-rE</span>, to whose household Sheshonk belonged. The walls of this<br/>
temple are of brick, with the exception of the sanctuary, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is of stone.<br/>
- The N. chapel, the oldest, was built in the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taharka </span>(25th Dyn.),<br/>
who, along with the princess Shepenwepet, appears on the walls,<br/>
<br/>
d. THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">SOUTHERN </span>BUILDINGS.<br/>
<br/>
Situated to the S. of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IT</span>.'s girdle-wall (p. 255) is the<br/>
Sacred Lake, named by the Arabs Birket <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-jlftrtZlia </span>or Lake of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Salt </span>Pit, as the water has become saline and <span style="color: #ff0000;">undrinkable </span>through<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">infiltration</span>. The banks were anciently faced with hewn stones, and<br/>
traces of these are still to be seen on the W., <span style="color: #ff0000;">s.</span>, and especially on<br/>
the N. side.<br/>
<br/>
Between this lake and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">girdle-wall </span>are <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>few <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-ruined </span>chambers<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>partly constructed of alabaster. The ruins nearest the lake date from the<br/>
reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>IIT., <span style="color: #ff0000;">those </span>immediately adjoining the temple-wall from<br/>
the reign of the Ethiopian Taharka.<br/>
<br/>
We now proceed to visit the Connecting Buildings between the<br/>
Temple of Ammon and the Temple of Mut, which were begun by<br/>
Queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Makere </span>but were probably <span style="color: #ff0000;">never </span>completed. Quitting the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cen.tral </span>Court of the Temple of Ammon, we enter a court enclosed on<br/>
two sides by <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span>and on the rear by Pylon VIL, all of which are<br/>
in rains. On the exterior of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>wall was inscribed the famous<br/>
treaty made by Ramses II. with the Hittites (p. 252). On the E. wall<br/>
is a long inscription (P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>), describing the contests of King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Merenptah </span>with the Libyans and the peoples of the Mediterranean (Etruscans, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Achseans</span>, etc.); and farther on is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">triumphal </span>relief (Pl. b) of<br/>
Merenptah in the presence of Ammon grasping a group of enemies<br/>
by the hair and smiting them with his club.<br/>
<br/>
Pylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">WI </span>was built by Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, whose victories are <span style="color: #0000FF;">celebrated </span>on both sides of it. In front of the S. side are the remains<br/>
of two <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statues of Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, in red granite.<br/>
<br/>
Beside the easternmost of the two walls which unite Pylon VII<br/>
with Pylon VIII lies (to the left) a small Chapel, dating from the<br/>
reign <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>111. Round the Sanctuary runs a gallery supported<br/>
by pillars connected with each other by balustrades. Farther on, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the same wall, is a representation (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>) of Ramses II. sacrificing.<br/>
<br/>
Pylon VIII is in comparatively good preservation, although it<br/>
was built by Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Makeré</span>, and is thus the most ancient part of the<br/>
entire building. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Makeré</span>'s names were removed from the reliefs by<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">BAEDEKER'H </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">191an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5th </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Eil</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>17<br/>
