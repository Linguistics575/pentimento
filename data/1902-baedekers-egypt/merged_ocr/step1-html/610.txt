<span>EDFU. 27. Route. 315<br/>
<br/>
The Greeks called it Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Apollonopolis</span>, after its chief god <span style="color: #ff0000;">HorusApollo</span>. It was the capital of the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>of Upper Egypt, the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Apollon0polites </span>of Graco-Roman times. Horus, who according to<br/>
the myth here waged one of his great combats with Set (comp.<br/>
pp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ray</span>, 215), was surnamed'he of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tebhet</span>', <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tebhet </span>being probably<br/>
a district of ancient Edfu; he was represented as a flying hawk, as<br/>
a man with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hawk</span>'s head, or as the sun with <span style="color: #0000FF;">outspread </span>plumes.<br/>
<br/>
The way to the (20 min.) Temple of Horus leads almost due <span style="color: #ff0000;">W.<br/>
</span>from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place</span>, then, turning to the N. (right), skirts the<br/>
Canal of Edfu and crosses it by a good new bridge. It then proceeds<br/>
to the W. through several streets and finally turns N. again for a<br/>
short distance. - Another route leads straight on from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">landingplace</span>, bends to the right through fields, and then traverses the streets<br/>
of the town without crossing the canal.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Temple </span>of Horus was freed by Mariette under the auspices<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Viceroy Sa'id from the accumulated rubbish that is now piled<br/>
up high all around it; and the edifice is now seen in wonderful,<br/>
almost perfect preservation, exceeding that of any other Egyptian<br/>
temple or even of any antique building in the world, in spite of the<br/>
2000 years that have passed over it. Unfortunately the faces of the<br/>
kings and gods in the reliefs all over the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>scratched out<br/>
in the Christian period. The present temple occupies the site of an<br/>
earlier sanctuary and was dedicated to the sun-god Horus, Hathor of<br/>
Dendera, and the youthful Horus,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Uniter </span>of the Two Lands' (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Harscm-tewE</span>, Harsomtus). The history of its construction and a description of the entire structure are detailed in lengthy inscriptions<br/>
on the exterior of the girdle-wall (<span style="color: #0000FF;">st </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span>i and k). The temple proper<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e. </span>the two hypostyle halls and the smaller apartments beside and<br/>
behind these) was begun in 237 <span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0. </span>by Ptolemy III. Euergetes <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>,<br/>
and completed, so far as the masonry was concerned, by his <span style="color: #ff0000;">MICcessor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">PhiloPator </span>in 212 <span style="color: #ff0000;">BA</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. The decoration of the walls with<br/>
reliefs and inscriptions, postponed by the death of Philopator and<br/>
the disturbed reign of Epiphanes his successor, was resumed in<br/>
176 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.0</span>. under Philometor and completed in 147 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C. </span>(under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>.), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ce</span>. 95 years after the laying of the foundation-stone.<br/>
Euergetes <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>built the great hypostyle hall (completed 122 <span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0</span>.)<br/>
and embellished it with reliefs, and under Soter <span style="color: #0000FF;">li</span>. and Ptolemy XI.<br/>
Alexander I. the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eolonnadei1 </span>court, the girdle-wall, and the pylon<br/>
were added, though the reliefs on the latter date from Neos Dionysos. The final touch was given in 57 <span style="color: #0000FF;">BAD</span>. The building-material<br/>
is sandstone.<br/>
<br/>
The great Pylon, to which a flight of steps descends, is covered<br/>
on all sides with reliefs and inscriptions. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the front of each of<br/>
the towers the colossal <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the King Neos <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dienyeos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>conspicuous, smiting his foes, whom he holds by the hair, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>presence<br/>
of the hawk-headed Horus of Edfu and Hathor of Dendera. In two<br/>
rows, above, the king appears praying and offering sacrifices before<br/>
