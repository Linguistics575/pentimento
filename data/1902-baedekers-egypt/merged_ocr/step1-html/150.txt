</span>the case of later temples, with reliefs showing the king in communion with the gods; the ceilings of their halls were supported<br/>
by columns (which at Bubastis had <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor-capitals </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>; and in front<br/>
of their entrances rose tall obelisks (p. 107) and colossal statues of<br/>
the Pharaohs. In other points of construction also they seem to<br/>
have closely resembled later sanctuaries, and many temples of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">New </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Empire </span>were probably built on the plans of the earlier ones.<br/>
<br/>
However different from each other the TEMPLES <span style="color: #ff0000;">OF </span>THE NEW<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">EMPIRE </span>appear at first sight, there is but little <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieulty </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">referring </span>them all to two general fundamental forms. One of these,<br/>
vividly, but probably quite accidentally, recalling the Greek Peripteros <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>temple surrounded <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>a colonnade, occurs only during the<br/>
18th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dyn.</span>, the age of Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>and his successors. The<br/>
rectangular <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cella </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cor </span>Sanctuary), containing the sacred boat with<br/>
the image of the god and provided with doors at each end, rose upon<br/>
a basement of masonry. crowned with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>concave cornice and <span style="color: #0000FF;">approached </span>by a flight of steps. On all four sides it was surrounded<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oolonnade</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof </span>of which rested upon square pillars and<br/>
columns (usually <span style="color: #ff0000;">Proto-Doric</span>). Occasionally, as (e.g.) at Medinet<br/>
Habu, this main structure was <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjoined </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>several smaller<br/>
apartments, also used for religious rites. Curiously enough this form<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">peripteros </span>was revived in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>period, though with various<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">modifications</span>, being used in the so-called Birth Houses, which stood<br/>
beside the principal temples and were dedicated to the worship of<br/>
the maternal deity (Isis or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hathor</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>and her child. The inner <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctuaries </span>in these birth-houses also were surrounded with <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">roofs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, however, were borne by remarkable plant-columns,<br/>
crowned with heads of Hathor or with figures of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bes</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The second fundamental form of the Egyptian temple is most<br/>
simply and clearly illustrated in the small temple built by Ramses III. at Karnak in honour of the Theban triad (see special plan<br/>
of the great temple of Ammon at Karnak, p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">245</span>). The approach<br/>
to the temple is formed <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the Pylon, two large towers of masonry<br/>
flanking the <span style="color: #ff0000;">entranee-dort </span>These towers are shaped like very<br/>
steep truncated pyramids; the slightly inclining walls are framed<br/>
with round mouldings and offer the greatest available space for<br/>
reliefs. The towers were imposing from their sheer size, and this<br/>
impression was <span style="color: #0000FF;">heightened </span>(from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Middle </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Empire </span>onwards) by the<br/>
obelisks and colossal statues <span style="color: #0000FF;">placed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>front of them, and by the lofty<br/>
flag-staffs which were fastened at the foot in the masonry of the<br/>
towers and higher up by huge clamps. Beyond the pylon we enter a<br/>
broad open Court, surrounded on three sides <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>. In<br/>
the centre stood the great altar, round <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the people assembled on<br/>
festivals. Beyond this again was a Hall, the roof of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>rested upon<br/>
columns. In most of the larger temples <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>e.g the Ramesseum and the<br/>
temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>at Karnak) this hall consisted of nave and aisles,<br/>
the latter being considerably lower than the former. In these cases<br/>
