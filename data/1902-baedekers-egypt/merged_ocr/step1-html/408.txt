<span>THE SUEZ CANAL. <span style="color: #0000FF;">14</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Route</span>. 165<br/>
<br/>
attempt to connect the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red </span>Sea with the Nile (and thereby with<br/>
the Mediterranean) was made by Nekho (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1xxxv</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>plan was to<br/>
extend towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>, from Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Timsah </span>to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Red </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sea</span>, an earlier<br/>
canal, in existence even under Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IT.</span>, which diverged from<br/>
the Nile near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis </span>and flowed through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wirdi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tt1mtltt<br/>
</span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">163 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. Herodotus informs us that no fewer than 120,000 Egyptians perished while engaged in the work, and the king afterwards<br/>
abandoned the undertaking, as he was informed by the oracle that<br/>
the barbarians (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ace</span>. the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Persians</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>alone would profit by it. The<br/>
canal was completed a century later by Darius. Its course roughly<br/>
corresponded to that of the present Fresh Water Canal. It was wide<br/>
enough to permit two triremes to row abreast, and it was four days'<br/>
journey in length. Darius commemorated the completion <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>great<br/>
work by various monuments on its banks, of which the remains have<br/>
been found at different spots <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to the S. of Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Maskhlita</span>;<br/>
to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>of the Serapeum station; to the N. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jihalt1f </span>near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kabret</span>;<br/>
and to the N. of Suez). - Under the Ptolemies the canal system<br/>
was extended, and locks were erected at its efflux into the Red <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sea<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Canal fell into disrepair during the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christian </span>century,<br/>
and Trajan (<span style="color: #0000FF;">98-it7 </span>A.D.) seems to have restored it. At all events,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>canal, beginning near Cairo, and terminating in the Gulf of Suez,<br/>
the precise course of which, <span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span>following the earlier channel,<br/>
is nowhere described, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span>the Amnis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Trajanus</span>.<br/>
<br/>
After the Arabs had conquered Egypt, they must have been<br/>
desirous of connecting the Lower Egyptian part <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile as<br/>
directly as possible with the Red Sea<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">iba </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-rAts </span>(p. xciii)<br/>
accordingly restored the ancient canal (of which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khalig </span>at Cairo<br/>
is said to be a portion), and used it for the transport of grain from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fostat </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">32</span>) to Kolzum (Suez), whence it was exported by the<br/>
Red Sea to Arabia. The bed of the ancient canal is said to have<br/>
been pointed out <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amr </span>by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Copt</span>. The canal again became <span style="color: #0000FF;">unserviceable </span>after the 8th century. At a later period the Venetians<br/>
frequently thought of constructing a canal through the Isthmus<br/>
with a view to recover the trade which they had lost owing to the<br/>
discovery of the route round the Cape of Good Hope, and several<br/>
travellers advocated the scheme; but no one seriously attempted<br/>
to carry it out. Leibnitz, too, in his proposal regarding an <span style="color: #0000FF;">expedition </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>, made in 1671 to Louis XIV., the greatest monarch<br/>
of his age, strongly recommends the construction of such a canal.<br/>
Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mustafa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IIL</span>, the admirer of Frederick the Great,'Ali Bey,<br/>
the enterprising Mameluke prince, and Bonaparte all revived the<br/>
scheme, and the latter on his expedition to Egypt in 1798 <span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cxi</span>)<br/>
even caused the preliminary works to be undertaken, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>the actual<br/>
execution of the project seemed almost as distant as ever. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lep√©re</span>,<br/>
Bonaparte's chief road engineer, surveyed the ground, but owing<br/>
to a serious <span style="color: #0000FF;">miscalculation </span>he threw great doubt on the feasibility<br/>
of the undertaking. While in reality the level of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">two </span>seas is<br/>
