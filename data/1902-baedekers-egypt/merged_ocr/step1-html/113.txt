</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mild </span>Pasha formed a new ministry, the soul of which was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabi </span>Bey, the energetic minister of war. This cabinet at<br/>
once proceeded, without receiving the consent of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive</span>, to pass several measures intended to diminish the<br/>
European influence in the political and <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>administration of the country. The Khedive, to whom both<br/>
France and England had promised protection, declared that<br/>
he would offer a determined resistance to the measures of<br/>
the cabinet. At the end of May the British and French<br/>
fleets made their appearance before Alexandria. In the<br/>
middle of June serious disturbances broke out in that<br/>
town, in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span>of which many Europeans were killed,<br/>
while the others found refuge on board the ships. On<br/>
July 11th and 12th Alexandria was bombarded by the<br/>
British fleet, and on Sept. 13th the fortified camp <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabi<br/>
</span>at Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-lie</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>was stormed by a British force under Sir<br/>
Garnet Wolseley. Arabi and his associates were captured<br/>
and sent as exiles to Ceylon. Since these events British<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>has been paramount in Egypt. In the autumn<br/>
of 1883 a widespread rebellion broke out among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubian </span>tribes of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sudan </span>under the leadership of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>Ahmed, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">so </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>called'Mahdi' (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lxv</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, which proved fatal to the Egyptian supremacy in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sud'an</span>. An<br/>
Egyptian army <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofH0,000 </span>men under an Englishman named<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hicks </span>Pasha was <span style="color: #0000FF;">annihilated </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nam</span>, 1883, by the Mahdi's<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">forces</span>, and a second expedition of 3500 regular troops of<br/>
the Egyptian army, led by Baker Pasha, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>also completely<br/>
defeated at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tokar </span>in February, 1884. On the 18th of the<br/>
same month General Gordon, who had been Governor<br/>
General of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Stodin </span>in 1877-79, after a perilous ride<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">across </span>the desert, entered <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttom</span>, which he had <span style="color: #ff0000;">untertaken </span>to save from the Mahdi; while on Mar. lst <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mar</span>.<br/>
13th the rebel tribes under the Mahdi's lieutenant Osman<br/>
Digna were defeated at El-Teb and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tamanieb </span>by the<br/>
British troops under Graham. The Mahdi himself, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, still maintained his position near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttun</span>, and towards<br/>
the close of the year a second British expedition <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>of 7000<br/>
men) was sent out under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wolseley </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">rescue </span>Gordon.<br/>
Wolseley selected the tedious and laborious Nile route for<br/>
this expedition in preference to the shorter but more <span style="color: #0000FF;">dangerous </span>desert route from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suakin </span>to Berber. An advanced<br/>
brigade under General Stewart was, however, sent on from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Korti </span>at the beginning of 1885, which accomplished its<br/>
march across the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bay0da </span>Desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see Map, p. xxx) with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">complete </span>success, gaining severely contested victories over<br/>
large bodies of the Mahdi's followers at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abt </span>Ktea (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jan</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
