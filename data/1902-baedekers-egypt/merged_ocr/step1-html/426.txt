RAILWAY from Cairo to Medinet <span style="color: #ff0000;">erFay6m</span>, 75 M., in about <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>hrs. The<br/>
trains (two daily in each direction) are often <span style="color: #0000FF;">late</span>. - From Medinet <span style="color: #ff0000;">e1Faphn </span>the line goes on to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abuksa </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">AbouxahJ</span>, but for a visit to the Birket<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1fariin </span>horses must be brought from Medineh (comp. p. 181).<br/>
<br/>
Situation and History of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fayl'im</span>. In the great plateau of the<br/>
Libyan Desert, which rises 300-400 ft. above the sea-level, is situated the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">grovince </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">FArtjsr </span>(from the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptian'Phiorn</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span>. lake), the<br/>
<br/>
rst of the oases, which is usually considered to belong to the valley of<br/>
the Nile, and is justly celebrated for its <span style="color: #0000FF;">extraordinary </span>fertility. This<br/>
tract is in the form of an oval basin and is enclosed by the Libyan<br/>
hills, which are here of moderate height, and lies about <span style="color: #0000FF;">three-fifths </span>of a<br/>
degree to the S. of Cairo. It enjoys a remarkably fine climate. <span style="color: #0000FF;">This'land<br/>
</span>of roses' is still one of the most beautiful parts of Egypt. The oranges<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">mandarin</span>, peaches, olives, <span style="color: #0000FF;">figs</span>, cactus fruit, pomegranates, and grapes<br/>
grown here are much esteemed, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields</span>, which are watered by means<br/>
of wheels of peculiar construction, yield rice, sugar, cotton, flax, and hemp,<br/>
besides the usual cereals. The beginning of November is probably the<br/>
season at <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the traveller will obtain the most distinct idea of the<br/>
fertile character of the district<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Even at the period <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pto1ernies </span>and<br/>
the Romans the products of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Faydm </span>were much extolled.'The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoite<br/>
</span>Nome', says <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>,'is the most remarkable of all, both on account of<br/>
its scenery and its fertility and cultivation. For it alone is planted with<br/>
large and richly productive <span style="color: #0000FF;">olive-trees</span>, and the oil is good when the olives<br/>
are <span style="color: #0000FF;">carefully </span>gathered; those who are neglectful may indeed obtain oil in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">abundance</span>, but it has a bad smell. In the rest of Egypt the olive-tree<br/>
is never seen, except in the gardens of Alexandria, where under favourable circumstances it yields olives, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but</span>, no oil<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Vines, corn, padded<br/>
plants, and many other products also thrive in this district in no small<br/>
abundance'. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayiim </span>is entirely indebted for its fertility to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ballr<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Yasuf </span>('Canal of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Joseph</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, a channel 207 M. in length, which diverges from<br/>
the Nile to the N. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assiii.t</span>, and flows through a narrow opening in the<br/>
Libyan chain into the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayilm</span>, where it divides into numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">ramifications</span>,<br/>
abundantly watering the whole district. At the point where the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barr<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yiisuf </span>enters the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayihn</span>, the district forms a plateau of moderate height,<br/>
descending towards the W. in three gradations towards the Birket <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karon<br/>
</span>(p. 181). Method of irrigation, see p.1v..<br/>
<br/>
In antiquity the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayilm </span>was known as Te-she <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'lake-land</span>' (Gr. Limne,<br/>
the lake), from the great inland lake frequently mentioned and described by<br/>
Greek travellers and geographers under the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luke </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Moan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>from<br/>
Egypt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mern-wit</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">muir</span>, great canal), of which the last <span style="color: #0000FF;">trace </span>must be <span style="color: #0000FF;">recognized </span>in the present Birket <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koran</span>. At the <span style="color: #ff0000;">most </span>remote period the lake<br/>
had a circumference of about <span style="color: #0000FF;">1110 </span>M. (Herodotus says 3600 stadia, i.e. 335 <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>),<br/>
with an area of about 770 sq. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M.</span>, and lay, according to recent calculations,<br/>
70ft. above the level of the Mediterranean; whereas the present lake is<br/>
140 ft. below sea-level. The ancient Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maris </span>thus occupied almost the<br/>
entire basin of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayt1m</span>, leaving uncovered only a narrow strip of fertile<br/>
land on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>, known as the'Lake-land', on which stood the capital<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Shem </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Crocodilopolis</span>, p. 176), protected by embankments against inundation.<br/>
Of the actual boundaries of the lake we can only say that on the N. it<br/>
stretched <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>far <span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>the eminence with the desert temple discovered <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ly<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sehweinfurth</span>, while on the S. the waters probably reached the neighbourhood of Edwa, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bihamu</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fidmin</span>. As early as the Greek period,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>in the reign of Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philadelphus</span>, the lake-area was reduced<br/>
by means of embankments, until its total size approximated to that of the<br/>
modern Birket <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fartn</span>. Attempts were made to reclaim land for agricultural<br/>
purposes by draining the marshes; and the success that has attended<br/>
these efforts is attested by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fertile </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fse1ds </span>and prosperous villages that<br/>
have occupied for two centuries the erstwhile site <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofLake </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Moaris</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo<br/>
</span>describes the lake in the following terms:'Owing to its size and depth<br/>
Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moeris </span>is capable of receiving the <span style="color: #0000FF;">superabundance </span>of water during<br/>
the inundation without overflowing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">habitations </span>and crops; but later,<br/>
when the water <span style="color: #ff0000;">suhsides</span>, and after the lake has given up its excess<br/>
