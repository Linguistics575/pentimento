<span>DOCTRINES OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">ELJSLAM</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lxiii<br/>
<br/>
</span>as he declared, nothing new. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>religion was of the most remote<br/>
antiquity, all men being supposed by him to be born Muslims,<br/>
though surrounding circumstances might subsequently cause them<br/>
to fall away from the true religion. So far as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span>was <span style="color: #ff0000;">aoquainted </span>with <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">udaism </span>and Christianity, he disapproved of the rigour<br/>
of their ethics, which were apt to degenerate into a body of mere<br/>
empty forms, while he also rejected their dogmatic teaching as<br/>
utterly false. Above all he repudiated whatever seemed to him to<br/>
savour of polytheism, including the doctrine of the Trinity, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as'assigning </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">partners</span>' to the one and only God. Every human being he<br/>
considered bound to accept the new revelation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Isl'am</span>, and<br/>
every Muslim is bound to promulgate this faith. Practically, however, this stringency was afterwards relaxed, as the Muslims found<br/>
themselves obliged to enter into <span style="color: #ff0000;">paeifle </span>treaties with nations beyond<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonflneg </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabia</span>. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">distinction </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>also drawn between peoples<br/>
who were already in possession of a revelation, such as <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ews</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christians</span>, and Sabians, and idolaters, the last of whom were to be rigorously persecuted.<br/>
<br/>
The Muslim creed is embodied in the words:'There is no God<br/>
but God <span style="color: #ff0000;">CAllishf</span>), and Mohammed is the prophet of God' (ld <span style="color: #ff0000;">itttha<br/>
</span>ill' Allah<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'wa </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">f1fuliammedar-rtit0lu'lMl0</span>. This formula, however,<br/>
contains the most important doctrine only; for the Muslim is bound<br/>
to believe in three cardinal points: <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>) God and the angels, <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span>)<br/>
written revelation and the prophets, and (3) the resurrection, judgment, eternal life, and predestination.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gon </span>AND THE ANGELS. According to comparatively modern<br/>
inscriptions it would appear that the emphatic assertion of the unity<br/>
of God is by no means peculiar to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedanism</span>. As God is a<br/>
Spirit, embracing all perfection within Himself (comp. p. 46),<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ninety-nine </span>of his different attributes were afterwards gathered<br/>
from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koran</span>, each of which is represented by a bead of the Muslim rosary. Great importance is also attached to the fact that the<br/>
creation of the world was effected by a simple effort of the divine<br/>
will. (God said'Let there be', and there was.)<br/>
<br/>
The story of the creation in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koran </span>is taken from the Bible,<br/>
with variations from Rabbinical, Persian, and other sources. God<br/>
first created his throne; beneath the throne there was water; the<br/>
earth <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>then formed. In order to keep the earth steady, God<br/>
caused it to be supported by an angel, placed on a huge rock, which<br/>
in its turn rests on the back and <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>of the bull of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Simultaneous with the creation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">firmament </span>was that of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ginn </span>(daemons), beings occupying a middle rank between men and<br/>
angels, some of them believing, others unbelieving. When the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ginn<br/>
</span>became arrogant, an angel was ordered to banish them, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ac<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Allah is also the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">God </span>used by the Jews and Christians<br/>
who speak Arabic.<br/>
