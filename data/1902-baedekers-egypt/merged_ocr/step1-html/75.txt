<span>lxiv DOCTRINES OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">ELJSLAM</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cordingly </span>drove them to the mountains of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kitt </span>by which the earth<br/>
is surrounded, whence they <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>make incursions. Adam<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>then created, on the evening of the sixth day, and the Muslims<br/>
on that account observe Friday as their Sabbath. After the <span style="color: #0000FF;">creatiOn<br/>
</span>of Adam came the fall of the angel who conquered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ginn</span>. As he<br/>
refused to bow down before Adam he was exiled, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">thenceforward<br/>
</span>called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Iblis</span>, or the devil. After this, Adam himself fell, and became a solitary wanderer, but was afterwards <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-united </span>to Eve at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">M </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ecca</span>, where the sacred stone in the Ka'ba derives its black colour<br/>
from Adam's <span style="color: #0000FF;">tears</span>. Adam is regarded as the first orthodox Muslim.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the creative activity of God, his maintaining power is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">specially </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">emphasised</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>being constantly employed for the preservation of the world. His instruments for this purpose are the<br/>
Angels. They are the bearers of God's throne, and execute his<br/>
commands. They also act as mediators between God and men,<br/>
being the constant attendants of the latter. When a Muslim prays<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Which </span>he does after the supposed fashion of the angels in heaven),<br/>
it will be observed that he turns his face at the conclusion <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">over<br/>
</span>his right and then over his left shoulder. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>thereby greets the<br/>
recording angels who stand on each side of every believer, one on<br/>
the right to record his good, and one on the left to record his evil<br/>
deeds. The traveller will also observe the two stones placed over<br/>
every grave <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">aMuslim </span>burial-ground. By these sit the two angels<br/>
who examine the deceased (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxv</span>), and in order that the creed may<br/>
not escape his memory it is incessantly chanted by the conductor<br/>
of the funeral.<br/>
<br/>
While there are legions of good angels, who differ in form, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span>are purely ethereal in substance, there are also innumerable satellites of Satan, who seduce men to error and teach them sorcery.<br/>
They endeavour to pry into the secrets of heaven, to prevent which<br/>
they are pelted with falling stars by the good angels. (This last is<br/>
a notion of very great antiquity.)<br/>

(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pi</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">WRITTEN </span>REVELATION AND THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">PROPHETS</span>. The earliest<br/>
men were all believers, but they afterwards fell away from the true<br/>
faith. A revelation therefore became necessary, and it is attained<br/>
partly by meditation, and partly by direct communication. The prophets are very numerous, amounting in all, it is said, to 124,000;<br/>
but their ranks are very various. Some of them have been sent to<br/>
found new forms of religion, others to maintain those already existing. The prophets are <span style="color: #ff0000;">free </span>from all gross sins and endowed by God<br/>
with power to work miracles, which power forms their credentials;<br/>
nevertheless they are generally derided and <span style="color: #0000FF;">disbelieved</span>. The greater<br/>
prophets are Adam, Noah, Abraham, Jesus, and Mohammed.<br/>
<br/>
The only other matter of interest connected with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Molpunmed's<br/>
</span>religious system is the position which he himself occupies in it.<br/>
Moses and Christ prophesied his advent, but the passages <span style="color: #0000FF;">concerning </span>him in the Thorah and Gospels have been suppressed. He is<br/>
