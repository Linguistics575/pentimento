of the temple-obelisks; ships and soldiers hastening to a festival. <span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. d.<br/>
Two <span style="color: #0000FF;">shim </span>bringing the obelisks from the quarries of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuttn </span>to Thebes.<br/>
<br/>
Within the S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>, at intervals <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>about 10 ft., are holes hewn<br/>
in the rock, which were <span style="color: #ff0000;">forrperly </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">filled </span>with Nile mud and used for plants.<br/>
Remains of palms, vines, and the like are still extant.<br/>
<br/>
We now ascend the approach to the Central Court, on the S.<br/>
side of which we can best observe the careful workmanship of the<br/>
retaining walls, intended to obviate any movement of the soil. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Th </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ey<br/>
</span>consist of finely polished blocks of limestone, with simple but<br/>
effective ornamentation. Broad pilasters, only 3 inches in depth,<br/>
and placed at wide intervals, project from the wall. Above each<br/>
are a gigantic hawk and a serpent. The W. side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">court </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">isbounded </span>by a terrace bearing two <span style="color: #ff0000;">eolonnades</span>, that to the right<br/>
named the Birth Colonnade, that to the left the Punt Colonnade.<br/>
<br/>
The BIRTH COLONNADE contains It pairs of square pillars supporting the roof. On all four sides of the pillars is the same scene:<br/>
Ammon (a later addition) laying his hand in blessing upon the<br/>
shoulder of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Makere </span>(figure defaced throughout) or Thutmosis III.<br/>
The inscriptions and representations on the walls of the colonnade<br/>
refer to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">procreation </span>and birth of the queen (P1. e). Among<br/>
these are two <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>figures of the queen-mother <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ahmes</span>, once in<br/>
presence of the ram-headed Khnum and the frog-headed Heket,<br/>
and once in presence of the ibis-headed Thout. - Two steps at the<br/>
N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>of this colonnade descend to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vestibule </span>with 12 <span style="color: #ff0000;">sixteensided </span>columns in three rows. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the walls are fine reliefs.<br/>
<br/>
In the 8. Wall is a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">Recess </span>with representations of the queen (<span style="color: #0000FF;">effaced</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">hefore </span>various deities; above appears the queen (again scratched<br/>
out) before Osiris. To the left of the recess is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Anubis </span>with the queen<br/>
standing behind him; to the right are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nekhbet </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>, between<br/>
whom were the names of the queen. - In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">w. </span>Wall is a similar Recess.<br/>
Above it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>III. making a wine-offering to the hawk-headed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sokaris</span>, god of the dead; to the right, Anubis and the queen (<span style="color: #ff0000;">seoatehed<br/>
</span>out); to the left, the queen (scratched out) standing in a chapel before the<br/>
fetish of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eme-wet</span>. - <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the W. (rear) Wall, the queen (<span style="color: #0000FF;">scratched </span>out) <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacri<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fieing </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>(to the left) and to Anubis (<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the right), with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sacrifiisiat </span>gifts heaped up before each god.<br/>
<br/>
Three steps at the hack of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">anteehamber </span>lead to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">CHAPEL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Annexe</span>,<br/>
which has three chambers with pointed vaulting. The colouring of the<br/>
mural decorations is admirably preserved, though the figure of the queen<br/>
is invariably <span style="color: #0000FF;">scratched </span>out. They represent <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maker√© </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span>Thutmosis occurs<br/>
once on the E. wall of the second chamber) before various deities, especially Anubis.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the N. side of this court is another COLONNADE, the roof of<br/>
which is supported by 15 sixteen-sided columns. It is <span style="color: #ff0000;">ur1finished<br/>
</span>and the walls were never decorated. Behind it are four chambers<br/>
(now walled up), the walls of which were also left <span style="color: #0000FF;">undecorated</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We now turn to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">COLONNADE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>PUNT, on the S. side of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>terrace, exactly corresponding with the Birth Colonnade. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*Scenes </span>on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">walls</span>, unfortunately much damaged, commemorate <span style="color: #0000FF;">an<br/>
</span>Expedition to Punt (p. 232), undertaken during the queen's reign.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>Wall we see a village in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Punt </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. f). The houses are<br/>
