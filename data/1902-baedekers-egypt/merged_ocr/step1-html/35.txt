<span>xxviii HEALTH RESORTS.<br/>
<br/>
It has three or four hotels, two European physicians, and a resident<br/>
nurse. - The cooking and invalid cooking at the Luxor Hotel are<br/>
very good<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The Grand Hotel is pleasantly situated, its rooms are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">spacious</span>, and its sanitary arrangements good, while the Karnak Hotel<br/>
is also well adapted for <span style="color: #0000FF;">invalids</span>. The temperature is 6-80 warmer<br/>
than at Mena House and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helwan</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Aswan </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">3270 </span>is situated at the First Cataract, also on the<br/>
right bank of the river. The prevailing winds are, as at Luxor,<br/>
NW. and N. in winter. The mean maximum temperature is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ttio </span>in<br/>
Dec. and Jan., 820 <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Feb</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">91</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>March. The mean minimum<br/>
for these four months is <span style="color: #0000FF;">55</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>; and the relative humidity is <span style="color: #ff0000;">35 </span>per<br/>
cent by day, <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>) per cent at night. Dew does not fall at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assutu</span>.<br/>
- <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin </span>is more under the immediate influence of the desert,<br/>
but it is exposed to a rather stronger wind than Luxor. The air is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bracing</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">although </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">io </span>warmer than at Luxor, and it is purer than the<br/>
air of any other Egyptian resort. The importance of the extra<br/>
warmth of Upper Egypt must not be lost sight of, in cases where it<br/>
is imperative that the action of the skin should be at its highest<br/>
level - especially as with this warmth a bracing effect is obtained<br/>
from the dryness of the air. The relative humidity is low, partly<br/>
on <span style="color: #ff0000;">account </span>of the higher temperature and partly because the air is<br/>
absolutely drier than that of other resorts. The beauty of the surroundings and the interest of the Cataract lend a peculiar charm to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Asswin</span>. - The accommodation for invalids is very good. Invalid<br/>
cooking is specially attended to and the sanitary arrangements are<br/>
good. An English physician is in residence at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin </span>in winter.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Invalids </span>who have decided to visit Egypt should remember that<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>stay of six weeks, even in Upper Egypt, can hardly be expected<br/>
to make a permanent improvement in their health; they should<br/>
resolve to spend the whole winter there. The best time to arrive in<br/>
Egypt is the beginning of November, for those bound for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helwan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mena </span>House, and about Nov. 10th for those going straight to Luxor<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Assutm</span>. The descent of the Nile before the middle of March is<br/>
not recommended, for the N. wind is very cold and in some cases<br/>
the patient <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>remain in the cabin or go down by train. An<br/>
English physician can be consulted on the larger steamers.<br/>
<br/>
Patients should not leave Egypt until the third week in April<br/>
at the earliest. They will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>at Beyrout, Athens, Corfu, Sicily,<br/>
Capri and other points near Naples admirable <span style="color: #0000FF;">transition-stations</span>,<br/>
with beautiful weather in spring<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Medical Hints. As regards clothing, invalids <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">remember </span>that<br/>
flannel <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>woollen materials are desirable, as it is often very cold in<br/>
Egypt. A fur coat or similar garment is of use. The morning is colder<br/>
than the evening, and it is easier to get a chill in the morning than<br/>
at night (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lxi</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. Warmer clothing or a cloak are useful till<br/>
11 a. m., then lighter clothing till <span style="color: #0000FF;">nearly </span>sunset, when the cloak<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
