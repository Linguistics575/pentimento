<span>286 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Route24</span>. THEBES (w. BANK). <span style="color: #ff0000;">6</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramesseum</span>.<br/>
<br/>
On the shafts of the columns and the sides of the pillars are representations of Ramses II. <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to the gods. The figures of Osiris, most<br/>
of which are headless, represent Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">u</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>The S. wing of the wall between the first and second courts is<br/>
now level with the ground, but the N. wing is still partly standing,<br/>
and its surface, especially that facing the second court, is in good<br/>
preservation. Upon it are two rows of interesting representations.<br/>
Those in the Lower Row once more refer to the Hittite war and<br/>
commemorate Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">HHS </span>great exploits at the Battle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kadesh</span>.<br/>
The king, much larger than the other warriors, dashes along in his<br/>
chariot. The Hittites, pierced by arrows or trodden down by the<br/>
horses, fall in confused heaps; crowds of them are hurled into the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Orontes</span>, where numbers perish. Farther to the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">appears </span>the<br/>
battlemented fortress <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Kadesh</span>, round which the river flows. Beside<br/>
it, on the other side of the river, are Hittite troops that have had<br/>
no share in the battle; some of them hold out helping hands to their<br/>
drowning comrades. The Upper Row (well seen with an opera-glass)<br/>
contains scenes from the Festival of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Min </span>(the harvest-god), which<br/>
was celebrated when the <span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span>ascended the throne (p. 300). To the<br/>
left <span style="color: #0000FF;">stands </span>the king, awaiting the procession which is headed by<br/>
priests carrying the images of the royal ancestors. Two tall poles<br/>
erected in front of the king <span style="color: #ff0000;">bear </span>the gods headdress. Adjacent are<br/>
priests letting fly four birds, for the purpose of carrying tidings to<br/>
the four quarters<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>of the globe that the Pharaoh has attained the<br/>
crown. Farther to the right the king appears cutting a sheaf with<br/>
a sickle for presentation to the god, thus discharging the second<br/>
ceremony usual at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">festival</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>This second court also contained<br/>
colossal statues of the king. Fragments of one of these (in black<br/>
granite) lie <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>the ground; the head is of great beauty (nose<br/>
broken). On the throne are the names of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, beside which<br/>
that of Belzoni the explorer (p. 116) has been placed.<br/>
<br/>
The TERRACE bounding the second court on the W. was reached<br/>
by three flights of steps, of which that to the N. is in excellent<br/>
preservation. Ascending these we turn to the S. part of the Rear<br/>
Wall (P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">u</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, on which are three rows of representations. In the<br/>
bottom row are eleven sons of the king; in the middle row, to the<br/>
left, is the king conducted by Atum and the hawk-headed Mont,<br/>
who holds the hieroglyph for'life' before the king's face; to the<br/>
right is the king kneeling before the Theban triad, while Thout,<br/>
behind him, writes the king's name on a palm-leaf; in the top row<br/>
the king is shown <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to Ptah, to the left, and offering <span style="color: #0000FF;">incense </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ithyphallic </span>Min and a goddess, to the right.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond this terrace is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Great </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hypostyle </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ball</span>, which had three<br/>
entrances, corresponding to the above-mentioned flights of steps.<br/>
This hall, like the great hall at Karnak (p. 249), had three aisles,<br/>
of which that in the centre was higher than the others. The central<br/>
aisle has six couples of columns with <span style="color: #ff0000;">ealyx-capitals </span>and six couples<br/>
<br/>
