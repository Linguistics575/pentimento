sarcophagus of the king, containing a mummy-shaped <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoffin </span>with<br/>
the body of Amenophis IL, wrapped in its shroud and still adorned<br/>
with garlands. On each side <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the crypt are two small chambers.<br/>
In the first to the right lie three mummies. The second to the right,<br/>
also found walled up when the tomb was opened, contained nine<br/>
royal mummies, probably placed here for concealment by <span style="color: #0000FF;">graverobbers</span>. Among them were the mummies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span>IV., Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>(18th Dyn.), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Si-Ptah</span>, and Sethos II.

No. 38. Tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, the earliest royal tomb in the<br/>
Valley of the Kings, discovered by Loret in 1899, lies in the abrupt<br/>
side of the valley, between Tombs 14 and 15. It is accessible only<br/>
by special permission from the Inspector General at Medinet-Habu.<br/>
<br/>
A steep flight of steps descends to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">square </span>room, whence another<br/>
flight leads to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>roughly hewn <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOMB </span>CHAMBER, the ceiling of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was<br/>
supported by a column (now broken). The <span style="color: #ff0000;">walls </span>were covered with<br/>
painted stucco, but this has disappeared from the fact that the grave was<br/>
sometimes under water. The handsome red sandstone sarcophagus is<br/>
adorned with representations of Isis (foot), Nephthys (head), the gods of<br/>
the dead (sides), and Newt, the goddess of Heaven (inside). - To the<br/>
left is another small room.<br/>

The keys of the tombs are kept by the Inspector General at Medinet<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Habu </span>(p. 297).<br/>
<br/>
The first tomb here (No. 22) is that <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, found by<br/>
the French Expedition. We enter from the W.; the tomb soon bends<br/>
towards the N., but finally resumes its original direction.<br/>
<br/>
The three first passages penetrated the rock at an angle. The way to<br/>
the fourth crosses a deep shaft, which is not easily crossed without <span style="color: #ff0000;">a.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ladder</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It contains several representations of the reception of the king<br/>
by the gods. Some of the pictures have been only sketched in, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">field </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">divided </span>into squares. The sarcophagus has been broken. The Astronomical Ceiling Paintings in the chamber with the sarcophagus are noteworthy.<br/>
The chambers <span style="color: #0000FF;">beyond </span>this room have no inscriptions.<br/>
<br/>
The second tomb (No. 23), called by the Arabs <span style="color: #ff0000;">Turbetel-fruriid<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Tomb of the Apes), is in a very retired spot. It belongs to King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eye</span>.<br/>
