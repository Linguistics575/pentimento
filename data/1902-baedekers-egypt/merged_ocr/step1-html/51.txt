<br/>
Few nations in the East embraced the Gospel more zealously<br/>
than the dwellers on the Nile. Accustomed as they had long been<br/>
to regard life as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>pilgrimage to death, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>a school of preparation for<br/>
another world, and weary of their motley and confused Pantheon<br/>
of divinities, whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-seeking </span>priesthood designedly disguised<br/>
the truth, they eagerly welcomed the simple doctrines of Christianity,<br/>
which appeared so well adapted to their condition and promised<br/>
them succour and redemption. Like Eutyches, they revered the<br/>
divine nature of the Saviour only, in which they held that every<br/>
human element was absorbed; and when the Council of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chalcedon<br/>
</span>in 451 sanctioned the doctrine that Christ combined a human with<br/>
a divine nature, the Egyptians, with their characteristic tenacity<br/>
adhered to their old views, and formed a sect termed Eutychians, or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">MonoPhysites</span>, to which the Copts of the present day still belong.<br/>
<br/>
The name of the Copts is an ethnical one, being simply an Arabic corruption of the Greek name of Egyptians. The theory is now exploded that<br/>
they derive their name from a certain itinerant preacher named <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jacobus</span>,<br/>
who according to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahrizi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">was </span>termed <span style="color: #ff0000;">E1-BerLli'i</span>, or'blanket-bearer', from<br/>
the old <span style="color: #0000FF;">horse-cloth </span>worn by him when he went about <span style="color: #0000FF;">prea</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hing</span>. This<br/>
Jacobus promulgated the monophysite doctrine of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eutyches</span>, which had<br/>
found its most zealous <span style="color: #0000FF;">supporter </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dioscurus</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>bishop of Alexandria,<br/>
who was declared a heretic and banished after the Council <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Chalcedon</span>;<br/>
and his disciples were sometimes called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jacobites</span>. If this name had ever<br/>
been abbreviated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cobit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Cobt</span>, it would probably have occurred<br/>
frequently in the writings of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Monophysites</span>; but there we find no trace<br/>
of it. It is, on the other hand, quite intelligible that the word Copt,<br/>
though originally synonymous with Egyptian, should gradually have come<br/>
to denote a particular religious sect; for, at the period when the valley<br/>
of the Nile was conquered by'Amr, the native Egyptians, who almost<br/>
exclusively held the monophysite creed, <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>distinguished by<br/>
their religion from their invaders, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">brought </span>a new religious system<br/>
from the East.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">TheseEgyptian </span>Christians strenuously <span style="color: #0000FF;">opposed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>resolutions of<br/>
the Council of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chalcedon</span>, and thousands of them <span style="color: #ff0000;">saerifieed </span>their<br/>
lives or their welfare in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">items </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sanguinary </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eonfliets </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">8th </span>century, the causes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>were imperfectly understood by<br/>
the great majority of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">belligereuts</span>. The subtle dogmatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">differences </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Which </span>gave rise to these wars aroused such hatred among<br/>
these professors of the religion of love, that the defeated Monophysites readily welcomed the invading armies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam</span>, or perhaps<br/>
even invited them to their country.<br/>
<br/>
After the conquest of Egypt by the Arabs (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">32</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>the Copts were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>first treated with lenity, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>were even appointed to the highest<br/>
government <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftiees</span>; but they were soon doomed to suffer persecutions<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">privations </span>of every description. These persecutions were mainly<br/>
due to their unbounded arrogance and their perpetual conspiracies<br/>
against their new masters, and their Mohammedan contemporaries<br/>
even attributed to them the disastrous <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonf1agratious </span>from which the<br/>
new capital of the country so frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffered </span>(p. 33). Their<br/>
