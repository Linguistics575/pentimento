should be resumed. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">flannel </span>waist-belt permanently worn, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>an<br/>
extra garment to take its place after exercise or when the air is<br/>
cooling, will be found a safeguard against chills. Most invalids<br/>
should <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">leave </span>the hotel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cor</span>, in certain cases, their <span style="color: #0000FF;">bedrooms</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>before<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">10 </span>a. m., and then only to <span style="color: #ff0000;">betake </span>themselves to some sunny corner.<br/>
The hour for coming into the hotel varies with the place and the<br/>
month, being earliest in Jan. and latest in March and April. If the<br/>
patient be guided by the relative humidity, it would be earliest at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Menu </span>House, say about sunset; <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>little later at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helwan</span>; at Luxor<br/>
still later, <span style="color: #0000FF;">f</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">m</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>(except in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jan</span>), and 8 p. m. in March; and<br/>
latest of all at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>, - it being always understood that precautions as to extra clothing have been taken.--Those who are not<br/>
invalids, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>even in some cases <span style="color: #0000FF;">invalids </span>also, may sleep with the<br/>
windows open with safety.<br/>
<br/>
If a cold is caught it is apt to result in fever or in <span style="color: #0000FF;">diarrhea</span>,<br/>
which may turn to dysentery. There are good chemists at Alexandria, Cairo, Luxor, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>, from whom small <span style="color: #ff0000;">medicinechests </span>adapted for the climate may <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>purchased. The advice of<br/>
the traveller's physician at home will be useful in stocking such a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">medicine-chest</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>serious cases of illness a European doctor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">when<br/>
</span>procurable, should always be consulted, as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller</span>'s own <span style="color: #ff0000;">ex<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">perience </span>acquired at home is of little avail in the climate of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Fits of shivering are the usual <span style="color: #0000FF;">prelude </span>to an attack of fever. Quinine is the best remedy, of which <span style="color: #ff0000;">1-3 </span>doses should be taken on the days<br/>
when the patient is free from fever. Rest and copious perspiration will<br/>
also afford relief.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Diarrhea</span>, which is apt to turn to dysentery, is a very common complaint in this climate, and is generally the result of eating unripe fruit<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>of catching cold. The patient <span style="color: #0000FF;">should </span>first take a slight <span style="color: #0000FF;">aperient</span>, and<br/>
afterwards tincture of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Opium </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>concentrated <span style="color: #0000FF;">tincture </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">camphor</span>. A<br/>
simple <span style="color: #0000FF;">farinaceous </span>diet (such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-boiled </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rice</span>), with <span style="color: #0000FF;">tea </span>or well<br/>
matured, <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfortif1ed</span>, and unsweetened red wine, will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">beneficial</span>, while<br/>
fruit, meat, and fatty substances should be avoided. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">bases </span>both of<br/>
diarrhoea and fever all remedies are sometimes unavailing except change<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>climate, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>if the patient is in a marshy or unhealthy locality.<br/>
<br/>
Sprains, which often result from exploring ruins and caverns, are<br/>
most <span style="color: #0000FF;">effectually </span>treated <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>cold <span style="color: #0000FF;">compresses</span>, while the injured limb<br/>
should be tightly bandaged and allowed perfect rest.<br/>
<br/>
The sting of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>scorpion (seldom dangerous) or bite of a snake is<br/>
usually treated with ammonia.<br/>
<br/>
Sunstroke is <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>common in Egypt, even in spring when the air is<br/>
still cool. The head and neck should therefore always be carefully<br/>
shielded in one of the ways indicated at p. xiv. The usual remedies are<br/>
rest and shade, cold compresses, and warm baths with cold <span style="color: #0000FF;">douches<br/>
</span>applied to the head and neck. Syringing the ears with cold <span style="color: #ff0000;">salt- </span>andwater is one of the best remedies.<br/>
<br/>
Grey (better than blue) spectacles or veils may be used with advantage when the eyes <span style="color: #0000FF;">mifer </span>from the glare of bright weather. Zine <span style="color: #0000FF;">eyewash</span>, or some other innocuous lotion, should be used in <span style="color: #0000FF;">such </span>cases.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sticking-plaster</span>, lint, as well as all <span style="color: #0000FF;">effervescing </span>powders, and other<br/>
medicines should be carefully kept from exposure to moisture.<br/>
