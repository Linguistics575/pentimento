. SOUTH WALL (left; Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Is</span>). At the top are five reliefs: 1. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>a ram-headed god and a lion-headed goddess; 2. The<br/>

king in his chariot, followed hy three princes, at the storm of a<br/>
Syrian fortress. The defenders on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hattlements </span>are pierced with<br/>
his arrows and sue for mercy. Beneath, a herdsman flees with his<br/>
herd towards the town. 2. The king on foot, treading upon a prostrate enemy, and piercing a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Libyan </span>with a lance so that his <span style="color: #0000FF;">blood<br/>
<br/>
</span>gushes forth. 3. The triumphal return of the king from <span style="color: #0000FF;">battle </span>with<br/>

<br/>
NORTH WALL (right; <span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span>l). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">subject </span>on this wall is the<br/>
Battle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kadesh</span>, the culminating event in the Hittite war, with<br/>
which we have already become acquainted in the Ramesseum (pp. 284,<br/>
285), and at Luxor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Karnak</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahydos</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the Lower Half of the representation we see first the march<br/>
of the Egyptian army, which consists of infantry and <span style="color: #0000FF;">charioteers</span>;<br/>
then (between the doors to Rooms Fand <span style="color: #0000FF;">G</span>), the Egyptian camp, with<br/>
the shields of the soldiers arranged round it in a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">stockade</span>.<br/>
The bustle of the camp is represented with great vivacity; the unharnessed horses receiving their fodder, the resting soldiers, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">camp-followers</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>; to the right is the royal tent. The third picture<br/>
shows the king on his throne, holding a council of war with his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">officers</span>. Below two spies are being compelled <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>blows to yield<br/>
their secret. In the last scene (to the right) the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chariot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>of the<br/>
Egyptians and Hittites are <span style="color: #0000FF;">already </span>engaged in battle. - The scenes<br/>
in the Upper Half transport us to the midst of the flight. To the left<br/>
the king dashes in his chariot against his enemies, who have surrounded him in their chariots; he launches his arrows against them.<br/>
In the centre is the fortress of Kadesh, surrounded hy the Orontes.<br/>
Its defenders watch the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fight </span>from the battlements. To the extreme<br/>
right is the king in his chariot, inspecting his officers, who count<br/>
the severed hands of the enemy and bring fettered prisoners.<br/>
<br/>
REAR (W.) WALL. To the right (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. m) <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the central door is<br/>
Ramses 11. leading two rows of captured Hittites <span style="color: #ff0000;">hefore </span>Harmachis,<br/>
his own deified figure, and the lion-headed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wert-hehe </span>to the left<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. n) he leads two rows of negroes <span style="color: #ff0000;">hefore </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deified<br/>
</span>Ramses, and Mut. - Between the two last (<span style="color: #0000FF;">S</span>) pillars is an interesting Stale (P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">y</span>) of the 35th year of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">li.</span>, on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is a<br/>
long inscription recording in <span style="color: #0000FF;">florid </span>terms that Ramses erected large<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">edifie</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es </span>for Ptah of Memphis and presented rich gifts to him.<br/>
<br/>
Adjoining this large hall are eight CHAMBERS (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. F-N), <span style="color: #0000FF;">probably<br/>
</span>used to store the temple utensils and furniture. Round the walls<br/>
of these, which are covered with inferior reliefs, run stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">benches</span>.<br/>
We now proceed through the door in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">haok-wall </span>to the<br/>
<br/>
