</span>hill on the W. bank, about 11/4 M. to the S. of the temple, stands<br/>
the Byzantine Fortress of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mehmdi</span>. This is surrounded by a thick<br/>
wall strengthened with towers, except on the side next the river,<br/>
where the steepness of the hill was considered protection enough.<br/>
From the main entrance, on the S. side, a street leads to a church<br/>
of some size and thence to an open space. The houses, built of<br/>
brick and stone, have vaulted roofs and are in good <span style="color: #ff0000;">presertation</span>.<br/>

<br/>
The village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ee-Sehu'e</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>consists of two parts, one on each bank<br/>
of the Nile<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'Beside </span>that on the W. bank lies the TEMPLE 0F <span style="color: #ff0000;">EsSEmla </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">8eba'a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>the lions), called by the Egyptians Per-Amon<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">'House </span>of Ammon'). This temple was dedicated to Ammon and<br/>
Re-Harmachis by Ramses IL, and is constructed on the same plan<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>the temple at <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Jed-Tryin </span>(p. 360). Ramses himself was also<br/>
worshipped here as a god. The present name of the place is apparently derived from the avenue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sphinxes </span>leading to the temple.<br/>
Most of these are now covered with sand. Beside the two first are<br/>
two colossal statues of Ramses II. Statues of the king also stood in<br/>
front of the PYLON, which is 32 ft. high and 42 ft. broad. The sadly<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">weatherworn </span>reliefs on the front of the pylon-towers represent the<br/>
king smiting his foes, in presence of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ré-Harmachis </span>(N. tower) and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-RE </span>(S. tower). The reliefs embellishing the jambs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>central doorway show the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to various deities. The<br/>
large COURT, which we now enter, is 65 ft. square. To the right and<br/>
left are colonnades, each with 5 square pillars, against which stand<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>figures of the king. The reliefs on the walls, representing<br/>
the king in the usual scenes <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">intercourse </span>with the gods, are poorly<br/>
executed and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>no Special interest.<br/>
<br/>
The following GREAT HALL begins the <span style="color: #ff0000;">roek-hewn </span>portion of the temple.<br/>
The ceiling of this is supported by 12 square pillars<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>of which six are adjoined by <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The following <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRANSVERSE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Room </span>is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">adj </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oined </span>by two side-chambers and three other chambers in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back-wall</span>.<br/>
On the walls of the first three we see Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">lI</span>. worshipping and presenting<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>to various deities, among whom the deified king himself appears.<br/>
The central chamber behind is here, as at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gerf </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">trusén</span>, the SANCTUARY.<br/>
On the right wall the king offers <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowers </span>before the sacred boat of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">decorated </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">hawks</span>' heads. On the left wall he offers<br/>
incense and <span style="color: #0000FF;">libation </span>before the boat of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon</span>, which is adorned with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rams</span>' heads. On the rear-wall appears the <span style="color: #0000FF;">boat </span>of the sun, in which the<br/>
ram-headed <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">RE-Harmachis </span>sits beneath a <span style="color: #0000FF;">canopy</span>, worshipped by<br/>
the king (on the left) and three apes (on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. Beneath is a recess,<br/>
in which the outlines of statues of three gods of the temple (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>,<br/>
Ramses IL, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rii-Harmaehisl </span>may still be made out, although a <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure<br/>
</span>of St. Peter, with a halo and a large key, has been painted over that <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
<br/>
</span>the centre. The king appears <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the right and left of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">recess</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flowers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
