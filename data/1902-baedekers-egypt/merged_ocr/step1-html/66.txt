<br/>
</span>valley of the Nile requires less careful tilling and ploughing than<br/>
ours. As the dung of the domestic animals is used as fuel throughout Egypt, where wood is very scarce, that of pigeons is almost<br/>
the only kind available for agricultural purposes. An abundant<br/>
source of manure is afforded by the ruins of ancient towns, which<br/>
were once built of unbaked clay, but now consist of mounds of earth,<br/>
recognisable only as masses of ruins by the fragments <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pottery </span>they<br/>
contain. Out of these mounds, which conceal the rubbish of thousands of years, is dug a kind of earth, known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sebhtskh</span>, sometimes<br/>
containing as much as 12 per <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent </span>of saltpetre, soda, ammonia, and<br/>
other salts.<br/>
<br/>
II. IRRIGATION. The whole of the cultivable soil of Egypt is<br/>
divided into two classes in accordance with its relative height<br/>
above the surface <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>) The'Rai', or fields which retain<br/>
their moisture after the subsidence of the overflow long enough (or<br/>
nearly long <span style="color: #0000FF;">enough</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>to admit of the ripening of the crop without<br/>
additional irrigation; (2) <span style="color: #ff0000;">The'iSliarttl.ti</span>', or those which always<br/>
require <span style="color: #ff0000;">artifi0ial </span>irrigation. The irrigation is effected by means of:<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W6.kiveh</span>', or large wheels (rarely exceeding 30 ft. in diameter), turned by cattle or <span style="color: #0000FF;">buffaloes</span>, and sometimes by camels or<br/>
asses, and fitted with scoops of wood or clay, resembling a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dredging-machine</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">The'8hddof</span>', an apparatus resembling that of<br/>
an ordinary well, set in motion by one person only, and drawing the<br/>
water in buckets resembling baskets in appearance; as a substitute<br/>
for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sahiyeh </span>several <span style="color: #ff0000;">sl1idilfs </span>are sometimes arranged one above<br/>
the other. (3) When it is possible to store the water in reservoirs<br/>
above the level of the land to be watered, it is allowed to overflow<br/>
the fields whenever required. This is the only method available in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">oases</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>fortunately the water rises from the springs with<br/>
such force as to admit of its being easily dammed up at a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>high level. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>Pumps driven by steam are also used, particularly when a large supply of water is required, as in the case<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sugarplantations </span>on <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Gefs</span>' of the Nile in Northern Egypt,<br/>
where they are seen in great numbers. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The'Tdbdt</span>', a peculiar,<br/>
very light, and easily moved wooden wheel, which raises the water<br/>
by means of numerous fans, is used in the Lower Delta only and<br/>
in places where the level of the water in the canals remains nearly<br/>
the same. Archimedean screws also are found in the Delta, and in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">aytun </span>there are water-wheels of peculiar construction, so contrived as to be turned by the weight of the water. Occasionally<br/>
irrigation is effected by means of a basket slung on a rope between<br/>
two labourers. In order to distribute the water equally over flat<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fields</span>, they are sometimes divided into a number of small squares<br/>
by means of embankments of earth, <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>ft. in height, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, owing to<br/>
the great plasticity of the Nile mud, are easily opened or <span style="color: #0000FF;">closed </span>so<br/>
as to regulate the height of the water within them. The agrarian<br/>
measures of the Egyptian government are all directed towards the<br/>
<br/>
