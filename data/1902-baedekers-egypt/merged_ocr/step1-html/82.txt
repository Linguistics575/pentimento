(2) The <span style="color: #ff0000;">i.rddit'tyeh </span>(sing<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.kddivi</span>), an order founded by the celebrated<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Seiyid'Abd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ei-kiidir </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e1-Gtlttrii</span>, have white banners and white turbans.<br/>
Most of them spend their time in fishing, and in their processions they<br/>
carry nets of different colours, <span style="color: #0000FF;">fishing-rods</span>, and other insignia of their<br/>
chief pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">8enusiyeh</span>, founded by the Algerian Mohammad ben-'Ali <span style="color: #ff0000;">ee-Semlax<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">d.1\59</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, have spread over Arabia and the entire N. of Africa, especially<br/>
in the Egyptian oases of the Libyan desert. The residence of the chief<br/>
of the order was <span style="color: #0000FF;">recently </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">removed </span>from the oasis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gaghabilb </span>to the<br/>
oasis of Kufr. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">teaching </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sendai</span>" <span style="color: #ff0000;">ust </span>was directed towards a return to<br/>
the original <span style="color: #0000FF;">strictness </span>of Islam and to its emancipation from the dominion<br/>
of Europeans and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">heretics</span>. The members of the order abstain from<br/>
music, singing, dancing<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>tobacco, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffee</span>.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">k</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sammdniyeh</span>, established at the end of the 18th cent. by <span style="color: #ff0000;">8hikh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sammdn</span>, practise extreme <span style="color: #ff0000;">aseetieism</span>, seeking seclusion for the purpose<br/>
in cells, caves, deserts, and even in the sea. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>Ahmed, the mahdi<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1fhartilm </span>(p. cii), who appeared at El-Obeid in 1880 as <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'summoned<br/>
</span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">God</span>', joined this order.<br/>
<br/>
(5) The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Al.imediyeh </span>(sing. <span style="color: #ff0000;">altmedi</span>), the order of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seiyid </span>Ahmed <span style="color: #ff0000;">e1Bedawi</span>, are recognised by their red banners and red turbans. This order<br/>
is very numerous and is <span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span>respected. It is divided into many <span style="color: #ff0000;">sects</span>,<br/>
but of these the two most important only need be mentioned. One of these<br/>
is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shinndmiyeh</span>, who play an important part in the ceremonies at the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seiyid </span>Ahmed at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tan.ta </span>(p. 22). The other seat is that of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Uldd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nab</span>, who are generally young men, wearing high pointed caps with<br/>
a plume of strips of coloured cloth<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and a number of small balls strung<br/>
across their breasts, and carrying wooden swords and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>kind of whip<br/>
made of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>thick <span style="color: #0000FF;">plait </span>of rope.<br/>
<br/>
There are also many other orders which it is unnecessary to enumerate.<br/>
The ceremony of the admission of members to all these orders is <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>very<br/>
simple matter. The candidate (<span style="color: #ff0000;">zlwmid</span>) performs the <span style="color: #0000FF;">customary </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ablutious</span>,<br/>
sits down on the ground beside the superior (<span style="color: #ff0000;">gl-muvshid</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>spiritual,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">leader</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, gives him his hand, and repeats after him a set form of words,<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>he expresses penitence <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>his sins and his determination to<br/>
reform, and calls Allah to witness that he will never quit the order. The<br/>
ceremony terminates with three recitals of the confession of faith by the<br/>
murid<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">joint </span>repetition of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fatter</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">lxviii</span>), and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>kissing of hands.<br/>
<br/>
The religious exercises of all the dervishes consist <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>in the<br/>
performance of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zikrs </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">tie</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>pious devotions, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">invocations </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Allah</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>see<br/>
below). Almost all the dervishes in Egypt are small tradesmen, <span style="color: #0000FF;">artisans</span>,<br/>
or peasants. Most of them are married men, and they take part in the<br/>
ceremonies peculiar to their order at stated seasons only. Some of<br/>
them, however, make it their business to attend festivals and funerals<br/>
for the purpose of exhibiting their <span style="color: #ff0000;">zikrs</span>. These last are called <span style="color: #ff0000;">fulcara<br/>
</span>(sing. <span style="color: #ff0000;">fulgim</span>, i. e.'poor men'. Others again support themselves by drawing<br/>
water <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hemulh </span>see p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">37</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. Those who lead a vagrant life and subsist 0n<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">alms </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">comparatively </span>few <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>number. The dervishes of this class<br/>
usually wear a kind of gown (<span style="color: #0000FF;">dint</span>) composed of shreds of rags of various<br/>
colours sewn together, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>shaggy coat of skins, and carry a stick<br/>
with strips of cloth of various colours <span style="color: #0000FF;">attached </span>to the upper end. A<br/>
considerable number of them are insane, in which case they are highly<br/>
revered by the people, and are regarded as specially favoured by God,<br/>
who has taken their spirits to heaven, while he has left their earthly<br/>
tabernacle behind.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zikvt </span>of the Dancing and the Howling <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dervish</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>are the best<br/>
known.<br/>
<br/>
The howling or shouting dervishes perform their zikr at Cairo on<br/>
Frid. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1.80-2.30 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>in the little mosque beside the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Irate </span>el-'Ain (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>).<br/>
The dervishes assume a kneeling <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>crouching posture, with their heads<br/>
and chests bent downwards. In this attitude they sometimes remain for<br/>
hours, incessantly shouting the Muslim confession of faith -'It <span style="color: #0000FF;">ilitha</span>',<br/>
etc., until they at length attain the ecstatic condition, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">frnish </span>by<br/>
repeating the word ha, tie.'he' (God) alone. On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasion </span>of great<br/>
