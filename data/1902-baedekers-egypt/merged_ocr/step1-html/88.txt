<span>POPULAR FESTIVALS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxvii<br/>
<br/>
</span>The month <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramadan </span>is succeeded by that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shawwrth </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">three </span>days of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is celebrated the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>minor festival of rejoicing,<br/>
called by the Arabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ei-mi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eg- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">thtithayyiv </span>(the lesser feast), but better<br/>
known by its Turkish name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beirut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">»</span>. The object of the festival is to<br/>
give expression to the general rejoicing at the termination of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fast</span>;<br/>
and, as at our Christmas, parents give presents to their children, and<br/>
masters to their servants at this festive season. Friends embrace each<br/>
other on meeting, and visits of ceremony are exchanged. During this festival the Khedive also receives his principal <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>, ambassadors, etc.<br/>
<br/>
At this season the traveller may also pay a <span style="color: #0000FF;">visit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the cemetery by<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bath </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-Nas.r</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>of the others, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairenes </span>assemble<br/>
to place <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-branches </span>or basilicum (<span style="color: #0000FF;">rain</span>) on the graves of their deceased<br/>
relatives, and to distribute dates, bread, and other gifts among the poor.<br/>
<br/>
A few days after the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beirém </span>the pieces of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kisweh </span>or covering<br/>
manufactured at Constantinople, at the cost of the Sultan, for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ka'ba<br/>
</span>(the most sacred sanctuary in the interior of the temple at Mecca), whither<br/>
it is annually carried by the pilgrims, are conveyed in procession to<br/>
the citadel, where they are sewn together and lined. The ceremonies<br/>
which take place on this occasion are repeated on a grander scale towards<br/>
the end of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">month </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Skawwdl </span>(generally the 23rd), when there is a<br/>
gay procession of the escort which accompanies the pilgrimage caravan to<br/>
Mecca, and also takes charge of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahmal </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxvi</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>this occasion<br/>
every true believer in the prophet, if he possibly can, spends the whole day<br/>
in the streets. The women don their smartest <span style="color: #0000FF;">attire</span>. Many of the harem<br/>
windows are opened, and the veiled inmates gaze into the streets. The<br/>
chief scene of the ceremonies is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ruméleh </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. F, <span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, where a sumptuous<br/>
tent of red velvet and gold is pitched for the reception of the dignitaries.<br/>
The procession is headed by soldiers, who are followed by camels adorned<br/>
with gaily coloured trappings, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">hearing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>their humps bunches of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-branches </span>with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Oranges </span>attached. Each section of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cavalcade </span>is<br/>
preceded by an Arabian band of music, the largest section being that which<br/>
accompanies the Takht <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rawdn</span>, or litter of the Emir <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Iangg</span>, and the<br/>
next in order that of the Dem <span style="color: #ff0000;">et-Eagg</span>, or leader of the pilgrims, with his<br/>
attendants. Next follow various detachments of pilgrims and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dervishes </span>with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">banners </span>and lastly the Mahmal (see <span style="color: #ff0000;">p.1xxvi</span>). A picturesque appearance<br/>
is presented by the camp of the assembled <span style="color: #0000FF;">pilgrims </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Haggi</span>) at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Birket<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Hagg </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">108</span>), whence the caravan finally starts for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mecca<br/>
<br/>
</span>On the 10th of <span style="color: #ff0000;">DhiHviggeh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the twelfth month, begins the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">festival </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Od </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Kebir</span>, which resembles the lesser feast (<span style="color: #0000FF;">el-nd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">es-sughayyir</span>) already mentioned. On this day, if <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>no other throughout the<br/>
year, every faithful Muslim eats a piece of meat in memory of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sacrifiee </span>of Abraham, and the poor are presented with meat by the rich.<br/>
<br/>
With the <span style="color: #0000FF;">RISING </span>OF THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">NILE </span>there are also connected several <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span>festivals, closely resembling those of the ancient period of the<br/>
Pharaohs, which even the Christian epoch was unable entirely to obliterate. As, however, they take place in summer, few travellers will<br/>
have an opportunity of witnessing them. As these festivals have <span style="color: #0000FF;">reference </span>to a regularly recurring phenomenon of nature, their dates are necessarily <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>in accordance with the Coptic solar reckoning <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>time, instead of the variable Arabian lunar year. - The night of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">11th </span>of the<br/>
Coptic month <span style="color: #ff0000;">BaT1na </span>(17th June) is called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lélet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">en-Nuleta</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. the'night<br/>
of the drop', as it is believed that <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>drop from heaven <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>a tear of Isis,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">according </span>to the ancient Egyptian myth) falls into the Nile on this night<br/>
and causes its rise. The astrologers profess to calculate precisely the<br/>
hour of the fall of the sacred drop. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairenes </span>spend this night on<br/>
the banks of the Nile, either in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>air, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">in </span>the houses of friends<br/>
near the river, and practise all <span style="color: #0000FF;">kinds </span>of superstitious customs. One of<br/>
these consists in the placing of a piece of dough by each member of a<br/>
family on the roof of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">house</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>if the dough rises, happiness is in store<br/>
for the person who placed it there, while its <span style="color: #0000FF;">failure </span>to rise is regarded<br/>
as a bad <span style="color: #0000FF;">omen</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>let June the river begins slowly to rise (comp.<br/>
p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>). On the 27th of the Coptic month <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ba</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unit </span>(3rd July) the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Manda</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en-NU</span>, or Nile-crier, is frequently heard in the morning, announcing <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
