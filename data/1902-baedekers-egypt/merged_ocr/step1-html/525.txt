<br/>
temple (the so-called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Promenoir</span>) to the E., <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. behind the main<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">temple</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and surrounded the whole structure with a girdle-wall,<br/>
against the inner side of which a number of small chambers were<br/>
built. The front ofthe temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">was</span>, however, left unaltered until the<br/>
reign <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenophis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, who raised a new pylon (<span style="color: #0000FF;">No</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>) in front<br/>
of the pylon (<span style="color: #0000FF;">No</span>. IV) of Thutmosis III. All these buildings were<br/>
thrown into the shade by the erections under the 19th Dynasty.<br/>
Ramses I. raised still another pylon (No. II) and Sethos I. and<br/>
Ramses II. created between this fourth pylon and the pylon of<br/>
Amenophis III. that <span style="color: #0000FF;">gigantic </span>Hypostyle Hall, which has remained<br/>
ever since as one of the chief wonders of Egyptian architecture.<br/>
Ramses II. also caused a second girdle-wall to be built, outside<br/>
the wall <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thutmosis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The temple now seemed to have received<br/>
its final form. The temples of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sethos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and Ramses III. were<br/>
separate buildings, erected in front of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade </span>of the great<br/>
sanctuary. But the Libyan kings of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis </span>(22nd Dyn.) revived<br/>
the traditions of the ancient Pharaohs. A huge <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>court,<br/>
incorporating half of the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III.</span>, was built in <span style="color: #0000FF;">front </span>of<br/>
the pylon of Ramses I. Taharka, the Ethiopian (25th Dyn.), afterwards reared some <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>columns for some unknown purpose in<br/>
this court. The temple was now left unaltered for some time, but<br/>
under the Ptolemies it underwent <span style="color: #0000FF;">fresh </span>alterations and received its<br/>
final great pylon (<span style="color: #ff0000;">No</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span>). Thereafter it gradually fell into ruin; and<br/>
the Roman emperors were never tempted to restore the abandoned<br/>
and ruinous temple.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*First </span>Pylon is still 124 yds. wide, with walls 16 ft. thick<br/>
and 1421/2 ft. high. This gigantic portal, which dates <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the<br/>
Ptolemies, was never completed; and portions of the scaffolding,<br/>
constructed of crude bricks, remain to this day. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent<br/>
</span>view is enjoyed from the top, which is reached by a staircase on<br/>
the N. tower. It is useful and interesting to seek to identify, from<br/>
this point of <span style="color: #0000FF;">vantage</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>with the aid of the accompanying plan, the<br/>
various columns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>, and pillars. This is comparatively easy<br/>
as regards the nearer <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W</span>) portion of the temple; but the more<br/>
distant portions, from among which obelisks tower, are partly out<br/>
of sight, and are partly so foreshortened by distance, that they appear to form one confused system of ruins.<br/>
<br/>
Before we enter the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">court</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>inscription on the door of the<br/>
pylon, to our right as we enter, merits <span style="color: #0000FF;">notice</span>. This was placed here by<br/>
the savants who accompanied the army of Napoleon to Egypt, and records<br/>
the latitude and longitude of the chief temples of the Pharaohs as calculated by them. - Opposite the French table an Italian learned society<br/>
(Feb. 9, 1841) erected another showing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">variation </span>of the compass<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">declinazione </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">dell</span>' ago magnetico) as 1056"<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nrreat </span>Court, built by the rulers of the 22nd Dynasty, is<br/>
275 ft. deep and 338 ft. wide, and covers an area of 9755 sq. yds.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>each side is a row of columns, that on the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S.</span>) being <span style="color: #0000FF;">interrupted </span>by the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">liamses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IU</span>. { see D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">2471</span>.
