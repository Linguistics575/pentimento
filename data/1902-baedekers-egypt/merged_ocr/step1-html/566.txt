<br/>
and reliefs were left thus mutilated until the reign of Ramses IL,<br/>
who restored them, though with inferior workmanship. For <span style="color: #0000FF;">Centuries </span>afterwards the temple remained unaltered; but under <span style="color: #ff0000;">Euergetes </span>II. a few slight restorations were <span style="color: #ff0000;">untiertaken </span>and some unimportant additions were <span style="color: #0000FF;">made</span>, without, however, affecting the original<br/>
plan. On the introduction of Christianity a community of monks<br/>
established themselves in the temple, and founded <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">convent</span>, known<br/>
to the Arabs as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dt'r </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">d-bayri</span>, or the'Northern Convent', which they<br/>
built with bricks brought from an <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice </span>of the 26th Dyn. at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asasif<br/>
</span>(p. 283). The chambers of the temple were converted into chapels<br/>
and the'heathen' representations <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the walls were barbarously<br/>
defaced. Mariette made a few excavations here, but finally in <span style="color: #0000FF;">189496 </span>the entire temple was exhumed at the cost of the Egypt Exploration Fund under the skilful directions of M. Eduard <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aville</span>, while<br/>
Mr. Somers Clarke, the architect, has roofed in the colonnades to<br/>
protect the reliefs and made other acceptable restorations.<br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Makere </span>in her <span style="color: #0000FF;">capacity </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>ruler of Egypt is<br/>
uniformly represented with the traditional attributes <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">kingship</span>, viz. the<br/>
short apron and elaborate <span style="color: #0000FF;">beard</span>, though these, of course, are properly<br/>
appropriate to men only.<br/>
<br/>
The temple was dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>; but the goddess Hathor<br/>
and Anubis, god of the dead, also had chapels here, and several<br/>
chambers were devoted to the worship of the queen (who was probably buried in close <span style="color: #0000FF;">proximity</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>and of her parents.<br/>
<br/>
The plan of this temple is remarkable, and is quite different<br/>
from all others in Egypt. It occupies three courts or terraces,<br/>
rising one above the other from the level ground; these are connected with each other by inclined planes, which divide the whole<br/>
into a N. half, to the right, and a S. half, to the left. At the W. side<br/>
of each court is a raised platform, supporting a covered colonnade.<br/>
The stages were cut out of the E. slope of the mountain, and support was given to the outer and inner walls by means of blocks of<br/>
the finest sandstone.<br/>
<br/>
An Avenue of Sphinxes led from the plain to the temple, ending at the gateway forming the entrance to the temple-precincts.<br/>
In front of the gate, in square enclosures of masonry, stood two<br/>
Persea trees (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mimusops </span>Schimperi), the stumps of which are still<br/>
extant.<br/>
<br/>
We first enter the Lower Court. This is in a very dilapidated<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">condition</span>, but its two Colonnades have lately been restored. Each<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>consisted <span style="color: #0000FF;">ot'22 </span>columns arranged in a double row. The<br/>
columns in the back row were sixteen-sided, while the others<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>square in front and seven-sided behind<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Little now remains<br/>
<br/>
of the reliefs and inscriptions that once <span style="color: #0000FF;">adorned </span>the walls.<br/>
<br/>
On the rear-wall of the Ar<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnade</span>, at P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span>, are traces of the representation of a pond, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>which water-fowl are being <span style="color: #0000FF;">caught </span>with nets.<br/>
- On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall </span>of the S. Colonnade <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>from right <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>left). Pl<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>b. The<br/>
