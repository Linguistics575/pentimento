<span>118 Route 8. GREAT PYRAMID. Pyramids<br/>
<br/>
to avoid the discomfort of arriving breathless and heated at the<br/>
summit. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">space </span>at the top at present is about <span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yds</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>square,<br/>
so that there is abundant room for a large party of visitors.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">**Vrmv </span>is remarkably interesting and striking. There is<br/>
perhaps no other <span style="color: #ff0000;">prospeet </span>in the world in which life and death,<br/>
fertility and desolation, are seen in so close juxtaposition and in<br/>
such marked contrast. To the W. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">MW</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>) extend yellowish<br/>
brown and glaring tracts of sand, interspersed with barren cliffs.<br/>
The huge and colourless monuments erected here by the hand of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">man </span>remind the spectator, like <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>desert itself, of death and<br/>
eternity. On a bare plateau of rock stand the other pyramids and<br/>
the Sphinx, rearing its head from the sand, like some monster suffocated by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dust</span>. To the s., in the distance, rise the pyramids<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abusir</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakhara</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dal1sld1ri </span>to the N. stretch <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>in<br/>
the valley <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Nile. Towards the E., on the other hand, glitters<br/>
the river, on each bank of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>stretches a tract <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofrich </span>arable<br/>
land, luxuriantly clothed with blue-green vegetation, and varying<br/>
in breadth. The fields <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>intersected in every direction by canals,<br/>
on the banks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>rise stately palms, waving their <span style="color: #0000FF;">flexible </span>fanlike leaves, and interlacing their shadows over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah </span>villages<br/>
perched like <span style="color: #0000FF;">ant-hills </span>on embankments and mounds. In the direction<br/>
of Cairo runs the long straight <span style="color: #0000FF;">carriage-road</span>. Immediately before<br/>
us rises the Citadel with its striking <span style="color: #0000FF;">minarets</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam<br/>
</span>hills, which form the chief mass of colour in the landscape, gleam<br/>
in the morning with a pale golden tint, and in the evening with a<br/>
violet hue.<br/>
<br/>
The descent of the Great Pyramid is more rapidly accomplished<br/>
than the ascent, but is hardly less fatiguing. Persons liable to<br/>
giddiness may find it a little trying, but the help of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins<br/>
</span>removes all danger.<br/>
<br/>
INTERIOR (comp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Plan</span>, p. 117). A visit to the interior of the<br/>
Great Pyramid is comparatively uninteresting to the ordinary tourist.<br/>
It will be found fatiguing, and an interval of rest between the ascent<br/>
and this expedition is recommended. Travellers who are in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>slightest degree predisposed to <span style="color: #ff0000;">apopleetio </span>or fainting fits and ladies<br/>
travelling alone should not attempt to penetrate into these <span style="color: #ff0000;">stiiling<br/>
</span>recesses. The explorer has to crawl and <span style="color: #0000FF;">clamber </span>through low and<br/>
narrow passages, which, at places, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>near the entrance, are<br/>
not above 31/2 ft. high and <span style="color: #0000FF;">kit</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>wide. The stones on the floor are<br/>
often extremely slippery, and the close air smells strongly of <span style="color: #0000FF;">bats</span>.<br/>
The temperature <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the interior is <span style="color: #0000FF;">79Â° </span>Fahr. The attempts of the<br/>
guides to <span style="color: #0000FF;">goad </span>the visitor into inconvenient hurry should be <span style="color: #0000FF;">disregarded</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Entrance (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">i</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>is on the N. side (as in all pyramids), on<br/>
the thirteenth tier of stones, at a perpendicular height <span style="color: #0000FF;">01548 </span>ft. from<br/>
the ground. The long passage a r, which is now only 3 ft. 4 in. in<br/>
width and 3 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ll </span>in. in height, <span style="color: #0000FF;">descends </span>in a straight direction<br/>
