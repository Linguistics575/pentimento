<span>MEMPHIS. 9. Route. 131<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wo </span>M.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrashén </span>visitors bound for Memphis and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakhara<br/>
</span>leave the train, which goes on to Upper Egypt. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">station </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lies </span>to<br/>
the right of the line. We ride along the railway, turn to the right,<br/>
cross a bridge, and follow the embankment towards the village of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrashén </span>and a conspicuous grove of palms on the W. We pass<br/>
through the bazaar of the village, where candles may be bought at a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Greek'balslrtil</span>'. On each side of the embankment lie green fields in<br/>
spring and summer, and large <span style="color: #0000FF;">expanses </span>of water in autumn and<br/>
the first half of winter<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The embankment ends near the first trees<br/>
of the palm-groves, 20 min<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>from the station. The large mounds <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>rubbish before <span style="color: #0000FF;">us</span>, shaded by palms, and strewn with blocks <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>granite, broken pottery, and fragments <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">brick</span>, mark the ancient<br/>
Site <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Memphis.<br/>
<br/>
Were it not for the vast <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis </span>to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>of the ancient<br/>
city, no one would imagine that one of the most famous and populous capitals of antiquity had once stood here. The Egyptians,<br/>
from the earliest period down to the Roman imperial epoch, built<br/>
their <span style="color: #ff0000;">edifiees</span>, with the exception of palaces and <span style="color: #0000FF;">temples</span>, of large<br/>
sun-dried bricks of Nile-mud; but even the public buildings of<br/>
Memphis have entirely disappeared, as the stones <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>carried off in<br/>
former centuries to build other <span style="color: #ff0000;">editiees </span>on the right bank of the<br/>
Nile. The narrow streets, which are said to have been half-aday's <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey </span>in length even down to the 12th <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>, extended<br/>
between the Nile and the Girzeh <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canal</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to the N. as far as Gizeh,<br/>
and to the S. about as far as the latitude of the Pyramids of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahsht1r</span>.<br/>
The most important quarters and buildings of the city appear to <span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span>stood in the fields of the villages of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrashén </span>and Mit <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rahineh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
HISTORY. Memphis, the capital of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>of'the White Wall',<br/>
belonged to Lower Egypt and from a very early period played an <span style="color: #0000FF;">important </span>strategic and political <span style="color: #0000FF;">rele</span>, owing to its position on the borders<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>the two ancient kingdoms of the'North' and the'South' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxv</span>).<br/>
A later tradition ascribes its foundation to Menes, the first historical ruler<br/>
in Egypt, who is said to have built also the temple of Ptah (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hephaestos</span>),<br/>
the patron-god of the city. Memphis consisted of several quarters, the<br/>
most important of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>were the'White Wall' (in later times the citadel)<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>the'South Wall', with a temple of Ptah, and the'House of the Spirit of<br/>
Ptah', or great <span style="color: #ff0000;">temple-preeinets </span>of that god. Under the 6th Dyn. a new<br/>
quarter was founded, in which King Pepi <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>the residence of his court<br/>
and near which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sepx1lchrtyl </span>pyramid of the ruler was situated. This<br/>
quarter, and also the pyramid, were called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mevirirmewmofer</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span>. King<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Meriré </span>(Pepi) remains beautiful', and this name <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>in the later form <span style="color: #0000FF;">Men </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>in Greek Memphis) was afterwards applied to the whole city. Memphis<br/>
attained its greatest prosperity under the monarchs of the Ancient Empire,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>resided here or in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">vicinity </span>(near Gizeh). When Thebes became<br/>
the centre of Egypt and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>Ammon the most revered among<br/>
the gods, under the Middle and New Empires, Memphis appears to have<br/>
retrograded. <span style="color: #0000FF;">But </span>even in the time of the 20th Dyn. the temple of Ptah<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the largest in the country <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>two. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span>of the contests<br/>
for the possession <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEgypt</span>, which raged after the 22nd Dyn., the city was<br/>
captured by the Ethiopian Piankhi and by the Assyrians, and on several<br/>
other occasions.<br/>
