ladies, will also require the services of a guide, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'dragoman</span>', as<br/>
they prefer to style themselves (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P-dos</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>per day).<br/>
<br/>
MONEY. A small sum of money for the early part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey<br/>
</span>may be taken in English or French gold, or in English banknotes<br/>
(these usually at a discount <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I/r-l </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">per </span>cent<span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but large sums should<br/>
always be in the form of circular notes. These notes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Which </span>if kept<br/>
separate from the'letter of <span style="color: #ff0000;">indieation</span>' cannot be cashed by a thief<br/>
or a dishonest finder, are issued by the principal London banks<br/>
and by Messrs. Thos. Cook & Son. Fresh supplies may be forwarded<br/>
from England by <span style="color: #ff0000;">post-offiee </span>order, in sums not exceeding 500 fr.<br/>
European bankers in Alexandria and Cairo, see pp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">B</span>, 26.<br/>
<br/>
EQUIPMENT. For all ordinary purposes a couple of light tweed<br/>
suits, a few flannel and soft cotton shirts, a supply of thin woollen<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">socks</span>, one pair of light and easy boots, one of shoes, and one of<br/>
slippers, a moderately warm ulster or long travelling cloak, a pithhelmet and a soft felt hat, together with the most necessary articles<br/>
of the toilet, will amply <span style="color: #ff0000;">suffiee</span>. It is advisable, for the prevention<br/>
of colds and chills, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">wear </span>a woollen fabric next the skin; but<br/>
light <span style="color: #0000FF;">underclothing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>with an Oxford <span style="color: #0000FF;">shirt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>will be found more<br/>
suitable to the climate than a heavy <span style="color: #0000FF;">flannel </span>shirt. Evening dress is<br/>
usually worn at dinner at the principal hotels. A light silken <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cor<br/>
</span>muslin) cloth tied round the hat and allowed to fall over the back<br/>
of the neck and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ens </span>is an indispensable protection against the sun.<br/>
In prolonged riding tours a sun-shade is a fatiguing encumbrance.<br/>
All articles should be new and <span style="color: #0000FF;">strongly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">made</span>, as it is often <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieult<br/>
</span>to get repairs properly executed in Egypt. Few travellers walk in<br/>
Egypt, except for very short distances, but sportsmen should add a<br/>
stout pair of waterproof shooting-boots to their equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Among the most important extras to be brought from Europe are a<br/>
drinking cup of leather or metal, a flask, a strong <span style="color: #0000FF;">pocket-knife</span>, a thermometer, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pocket-compass </span>of medium size, and an acetylene lamp for lighting <span style="color: #0000FF;">caverns </span>and dark <span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>- Photographic materials, dry-plates,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">f1hns</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">etc</span>, can be obtained in Cairo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>it is preferable to bring a good<br/>
stock carefully packed from home, taking care to attend the customs<br/>
examination in person. The plates should not be more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>by 10 inches<br/>
at the largest.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">COMPANIONS</span>. The traveller can <span style="color: #0000FF;">hardly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>recommended to start<br/>
alone for a tour in a country whose customs and language are so<br/>
entirely different from his own. Travelling as a member of a party<br/>
is, moreover, much less expensive than travelling alone, many of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">items </span>being the same for a single traveller as for several together. - In spring and <span style="color: #0000FF;">autumn </span>TOURIST PARTIES are organized for<br/>
a visit to Egypt and the East by the tourist-agents Messrs. Thos.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">CookérSorn </span>(Ludgate Circus, London) and Messrs. Henry <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gaze </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">irélons<br/>

information, may be obtained on application. Travellers who join<br/>
such parties are enabled to inspect the principal points of interest<br/>
with the minimum expenditure of time and trouble, but must<br/>
