</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">vellous </span>uniformity. As Egypt is said to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'gift </span>of the Nile', so<br/>
has the character of its inhabitants been apparently moulded by the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">inf1uenees </span>of that river. No country in the world is so dependent<br/>
on a river <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>traverses it as Egypt, and no river presents physical<br/>
characteristics so exceptional as the Nile; so, too, there exists no race<br/>
of people which possesses so marked and unchanging an individuality as the Egyptians. It is therefore most probable that this <span style="color: #0000FF;">unvarying </span>type is the product of the soil <span style="color: #0000FF;">itself</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and that the character of<br/>
the peoples who settled at different periods on the bank of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nils</span>,<br/>
whatever it may originally have been, has in due course of time<br/>
been moulded to the same constant form by the mysterious <span style="color: #ff0000;">influeneeg </span>of the river. In all countries, indeed, national <span style="color: #ff0000;">characteristies </span>are justly regarded as the natural outcome of soil and <span style="color: #0000FF;">climate</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>and of this connection no country affords <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>strong an illustration<br/>
as Egypt, with its sharply <span style="color: #0000FF;">defined </span>boundaries of sea and desert, and<br/>
in its complete isolation from the rest of the world. This fidelity to<br/>
type, which doubtless many other Oriental races share with the<br/>
Egyptians, is by no means in accordance with common theories as<br/>
to the decline and degeneration of the Orient. These races seem to<br/>
possess an innate capacity that is absent from Western nations <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>the capacity, namely, of permanently preserving the original type<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>In Egypt this tendency may be partly assisted by the universal<br/>
practice of early marriages, by <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the succession of generations<br/>
is accelerated, while many children are born of parents still <span style="color: #0000FF;">unaffected </span>by any physical deterioration. Although the country has<br/>
been at various periods overrun by Hyksos, Ethiopians, Assyrians,<br/>
Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Turks, and although the people<br/>
were <span style="color: #ff0000;">tyrannised </span>over, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ill-treated</span>, and in most cases compelled <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">intermarry </span>with these <span style="color: #0000FF;">foreigners</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the Egyptians have for thousands of<br/>
years retained the same unvarying physical types, while their <span style="color: #0000FF;">character </span>has been but slightly <span style="color: #0000FF;">modified </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">introduction </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Christianity<br/>
</span>and Mohammedanism. If it now <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>in mind that these foreigners generally invaded the country in the form of an army, that<br/>
they formed but a small body compared with the bulk of the population, and that they either married native women <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>sought wives<br/>
in other countries, it is obvious that they would either continue to<br/>
exist for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>time as a foreign caste, a condition apparently repugnant<br/>
to nature and necessarily transient, or that they would gradually<br/>
succumb to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">never-failing </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">inf1uenetys </span>of the soil and <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>absorbed<br/>
in the great mass of the aboriginal inhabitants. An excellent <span style="color: #0000FF;">illustration </span>of this process is afforded by the Arabian invasion, with<br/>
the circumstances <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>results of which we are better acquainted<br/>
than with the history of the other foreign <span style="color: #0000FF;">immigrations</span>; for, disregarding the Beduin tribes, who are entirely distinct from the<br/>
Egyptian population, we now meet with genuine Arabs in the towns<br/>
only, where the merchants<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>pilgrims, and other members of that<br/>
people form a class entirely distinct from the natives, and one that<br/>
