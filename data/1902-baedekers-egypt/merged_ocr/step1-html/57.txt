<span>xlvi <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>MODERN EGYPTIANS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Negroes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">commonly </span>employed as doorkeepers (<span style="color: #ff0000;">bawwdb</span>), as house-servants<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">klurddiirn</span>), as grooms and runners (<span style="color: #0000FF;">3653</span>), for which their swiftness<br/>
renders them unrivalled, as <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoaehmen </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">'arbagi</span>), and as cooks (<span style="color: #0000FF;">.tabbali</span>).<br/>
Each of these five classes is admirably organised as a kind of guild,<br/>
with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh </span>of its own, who levies a tax from each member, and<br/>
guarantees the character and abilities of members when hired. Thefts<br/>
are very rarely committed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubians</span>, but in cases of the kind the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh </span>compels the whole of his <span style="color: #ff0000;">Subjects </span>to contribute to repair the<br/>
loss, and cases have been known in which several hundred pounds<br/>
have been recovered in this way. The result is that there is a<br/>
strict mutual system of supervision, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">suspected </span>characters are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unceremoniously </span>excluded from the fraternity. Nubian women are<br/>
seldom seen in Egypt except as slaves.<br/>
<br/>
(6.) SUDAN NEGROES. Like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Barbers</span>, most of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes </span>in<br/>
Egypt are professors of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islip </span>to the easily intelligible doctrines<br/>
of which they readily and zealously attach themselves. Most of the<br/>
older <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>negresses with whom the traveller meets have<br/>
originally been brought to Egypt as slaves, and belong to natives,<br/>
by whom they are treated more like members of the family than<br/>
like servants. Although every slave <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>desires to be emancipated<br/>
may now with the aid of government sever the ties which bind him<br/>
to his master, most of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes </span>prefer to remain on the old footing with the family <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>supports them and relieves them of the<br/>
anxiety of providing for themselves. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">eunuchs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>who also belong<br/>
almost exclusively to the negro races, but are rapidly becoming<br/>
rarer, very seldom avail themselves of this opportunity of regaining<br/>
their liberty, as their emancipation would necessarily terminate the<br/>
life of ease and luxury in which they delight. Under the present<br/>
government slavery is very rapidly approaching complete extinction<br/>
in Egypt, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>in consequence of changes in the mode of living,<br/>
and the growing preference of the wealthy for paid servants. - The<br/>
negroes who voluntarily settle in Egypt, constituting a body of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Coit-siderable </span>size, form the dregs of the people and are employed in the<br/>
most menial <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the negro- races of Central Africa to the N. of the<br/>
equator are represented at Cairo, particularly in the rank and file of<br/>
the negro regiments.<br/>
<br/>
(7). <span style="color: #0000FF;">TURKS</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Although the dynasty of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroys </span>of Egypt is<br/>
of Turkish origin (see p. xcviii), a comparatively small section of the<br/>
community belongs to that nation. According to the census of 1897<br/>
there are 40,126 Turks in Egypt, but among these are reckoned<br/>
Turkish subjects from every part of the Ottoman empire. Only a<br/>
few are genuine Osmanlis. The Turks of Egypt are <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>found<br/>
in the towns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>most of them are government <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieials</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">soldiers</span>,<br/>
and merchants. The Turkish language is little understood in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
[ 8). LEVANTINES. A link between the various classes of dwellers<br/>
in Egypt and the visitors to the banks of the Nile is formed by the<br/>
<br/>
