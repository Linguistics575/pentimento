</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eslr-8lreryi</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. river of the East. Skirting <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>bank of the stream<br/>
for 1/2 hr. towards the N., we reach the<br/>
Pyramid of <span style="color: #0000FF;">anara</span>, the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemhét </span>III. This consists<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">unburnt </span>bricks of Nile mud mixed with straw, and, when its sides<br/>
were perfect, covered an area about 115 yds. square. The limestone<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation</span>, however, had disappeared even in the Roman period.<br/>
The nucleus of the structure is a natural mass of rock, 39 ft. in<br/>
height. The dilapidated summit is easily reached in a few minutes<br/>
by a flight of <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-worn </span>steps. The entrance to the pyramid, on<br/>
the S. side, was discovered in 1889 by Prof. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Flinders </span>Petrie. An<br/>
intricate series <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">passages </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the interior leads to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber<br/>
</span>which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">22 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">long</span>, 8 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wide </span>and 6 ft. high. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemhét </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill.<br/>
</span>and his daughter <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptahnofru </span>were interred here.<br/>
<br/>
On the S. the pyramid was adjoined by <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>large temple, the<br/>
main portion of which was probably dedicated to the manes of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemhét</span>. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>, however, which served as a quarry for<br/>
centuries after the Roman period, has completely vanished, with<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">exception </span>of an extensive space strewn with small splinters<br/>
of stone and fragments of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>granite columns. Traces of its walls<br/>
may also <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>recognized in the sloping banks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bohr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Séla</span>. There<br/>
is no doubt that this <span style="color: #ff0000;">edifiee </span>was the famous Labyrinth, of which<br/>
ancient travellers speak with <span style="color: #0000FF;">such </span>unbounded admiration.<br/>
<br/>
For the best description we are indebted to Strabo, who visited the<br/>
Labyrinth in person. He says:'There is also the Labyrinth here, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">work<br/>
</span>as important as the Pyramids, adjoining which is the tomb of the king<br/>
who built the Labyrinth. After advancing about <span style="color: #0000FF;">30-40 </span>stadia beyond the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>entrance of the canal, there is a table-shaped surface, on Which rise<br/>
a small town and a vast palace, consisting of as many royal dwellings<br/>
as there were formerly <span style="color: #0000FF;">names</span>. There is also an equal number of halls,<br/>
bordered with columns and adjoining each other, all being in the same<br/>
row, and forming one building<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>like a long wall having the halls in front<br/>
of it. The entrances to the halls are opposite the wall. In front of the<br/>
entrances are numerous long covered passages, intersecting each other and<br/>
thus forming such a winding path, that the ingress and egress to each<br/>
hall is not practicable to a stranger without a guide. It is a marvellous<br/>
fact that each of the ceilings of the chambers consists of a single stone,<br/>
and also that the passages are covered in the same way with single slabs<br/>
of extraordinary size, neither wood nor other building material having<br/>
been employed. On ascending the roof, the height of which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">inconsiderable</span>, as there is only one story, we observe a stone surface <span style="color: #0000FF;">consisting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>slabs. Descending again, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>looking into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">halls</span>, we may<br/>
observe the whole series borne by twenty-seven monolithic columns. The<br/>
walls also are constructed of stones of similar size. At the end of this<br/>
structure, which is more than a stadium in length, is the tomb<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>consisting of a square pyramid, each side of which is four <span style="color: #0000FF;">plethra </span>(400 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>) in<br/>
length, and of equal height. The deceased, who is buried here, is called<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Imandes</span>. It is also asserted that so many palaces were built, because it<br/>
was the custom for all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nomes</span>, represented by their magnates<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>with<br/>
their priests <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>victims, to assemble here to <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">gacnriiice </span>and gifts to the<br/>
gods, and to deliberate on the most important <span style="color: #0000FF;">concerns</span>. Each <span style="color: #0000FF;">name<br/>
</span>then took possession of the hall destined for it.'<br/>
<br/>
The remains of brick buildings, which still linger on this site and<br/>
were erroneously regarded by Lepsius as remains ot the Labyrinth, date<br/>
from a village of the Roman period.<br/>
