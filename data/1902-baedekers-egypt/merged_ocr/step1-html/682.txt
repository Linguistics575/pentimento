<span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">dei </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Halfa</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">WADI </span>HALFA. 35<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Route. 377<br/>
<br/>
It contains a post and telegraph office, a small bazaar, and a pretty<br/>
mosque, and, including the Nubian village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dabrosa </span>on the N.,<br/>
has 2675 inhabitants. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewfikiyeh </span>is the starting-point of the military railways to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kermeh </span>(New Dongola, p. 382) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khsrrttm<br/>
</span>(p. 385). The station is near the hotel.<br/>
<br/>
About <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>to the S. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewfilstyeh </span>is the British Camp (called<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">GÃ©ger </span>by the natives), the base for the campaign against the<br/>
Mahdists (donkeys obtainable at the hotel). It has lost much of its<br/>
military importance, but is still useful as a station on the way to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sudan</span>. It is surrounded by walls and forts and contains the<br/>
residence of the commandant, large workshops, a railway, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete.</span>,<br/>
besides the partly disused barracks and stores. The mudir, who<br/>
issues the licences to carry <span style="color: #ff0000;">tire-arms </span>(comp. p. 381), also lives here,<br/>
about 200 yds. to the W. of the military railway-station. - About<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">11/4 </span>M. farther to the S. is the insignificant village of Wadi <span style="color: #0000FF;">Haifa</span>.<br/>
<br/>
On the W. bank, opposite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wtdi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Halfa1 </span>a little to the N. of a<br/>
large and conspicuous sycamore -tree, lay the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span>town of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Beheni</span>, the site of which may be reached by boat from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewfilsiyeh<br/>
</span>in 1-2 hrs. (according to the wind). The remains of two temples are<br/>
still <span style="color: #0000FF;">extent</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">NORTH </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">TEMPLE</span>, dating from the beginning of the<br/>
12th Dyn., was built of brick, with the exception of the pillars in<br/>
the first hall and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">jambs </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance-door</span>. It is much damaged and sanded up. The SOUTH TEMPLE, about <span style="color: #ff0000;">60 </span>yds. distant, was<br/>
exhumed in 1887 by Col. Smith, but is again largely covered with<br/>
sand. It is in better preservation than the other, its sandstone walls<br/>
and pillars still rising to the height of <span style="color: #0000FF;">5-6 </span>ft. This S. temple was<br/>
built by Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatshepsowet </span>and dedicated to Horus<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beheni</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>and figures <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatshepsowet </span>have been<br/>
systematically defaced or converted into those of Thutmosis II.<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">lxxxii</span>). The temple stands from E. to W. Close to the riverbank, where traces of a quay may be made out, is a brick Pylon,<br/>
the tower of which rises like a massive pillar. Behind is a large<br/>
Hall<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the present form of which is due to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">reconstruction</span>, probably<br/>
at the beginning of the 20th Dynasty. The pillars and columns on<br/>
which the roof rested bear not only the original reliefs and <span style="color: #ff0000;">inseriptions </span>of Thutmosis <span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span>but also numerous hieroglyphic inscriptions<br/>
added by officials of the Middle Empire. There are also Greek,<br/>
Carian, and Ethiopian inscriptions. On one pillar is a long and<br/>
pompous inscription celebrating the deeds of Thutmosis m. Behind<br/>
this hall stood the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Temple </span>Proper, the back of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjoined </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>cliff,<br/>
while on the other three sides were <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with'proto-Dorie'<br/>
</span>columns. Within were <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Transverse <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall</span>, communicating with<br/>
the Sanctuary, and several other chambers. The admirable mural<br/>
reliefs, many of which retain their colouring, represent the Pharaoh<br/>
in presence of the gods. - Beside the temples lie the ruins of the<br/>
ancient town, and on a rock to the W. are inscriptions of the Middle<br/>
Empire<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the ground close by are ancient graves.<br/>
