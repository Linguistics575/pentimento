the sublime peaks of Mount 8erbiil.

The village of Feirén, the mediaeval Pharan, was once
an episcopal see. These mountains were then filled with
hermits, and a flourishing monastery maintained. The ruins
still stand on almost every height, but the modern village
consists of ugly and cumfortless mud huts. Numerous
capitals and broken shafts, elm, are all that remain of the
once important church.

In the beautiful Oasis of Feirén one or two days may be
well spent. In addition to the natural charms of the valley,
and the interest attaching to the ruins of the old episcopal
city, there are several attractions in the neighbourhood. The
ascent of Mount Serbia! is a good day's work, and should
not be attempted by those totally inexperienced in mountain
climbing. The summit consists of several peaks of almost
uniform height, rising from a ridge three miles in length,
and 4,000 feet above the valleys at its base. The highest
peak is 6,734 feet above the sea. The attempt of some to
identify Mount Serbil with the Biblical Mount Sinai is now
generally considered to be refuted. Mount Sinai must have
an adjacent plain, and there is none such at Serbél. On the
edge of a precipice not far from the summit of Serbél are
the remains of an ancient beacon-tower. The view from the
top is extensive and very varied.

The Jebei-ei-Tahooneh, opposite the hill of El
Maharrad, is the traditional scene of the uplifting of the
hands of Moses by Aaron and Hur, whilst the battle between
Amalek and Israel raged below. There are remains of a
chapel once commemorative of this event at the top of the
hill, and also remains of station chapels on the sides, show..
ing the reverence with which the spot was regarded in the
early ages of Christianity. The Jehel-el-Moneijah
