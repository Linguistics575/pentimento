1 10 EGYPT.

tribunal of prayer; and the mehrab, or niche towards Mecca.
The north and south sides of the court are bounded by two
piazzas, with two rows of columns. The whole building is
in a very dilapidated condition, and several portions, especi-
ally the minarets, are evidently of later date than the original
edifice, being probably the additions and restorations made
by Sultans Kala6n and Baybérs. The columns are 249 in
number, chiefly monoliths of granite, porphyry, and ciproline.
These columns were in most cases brought from the ruins
of Memphis, those with Corinthian columns were probably
from Heliopolis. This important monument of Arabian art
is now abandoned to desolation. The last Viceroy projected
its restoration, and it is said that the present Khédive in-
tends to carry out his predecessor's plans when circumstances
permit.

Formerly the entire Kur-én was inscribed in letters of
gold on the walls of this Mosque. The fountain in the
centre was embowereql in trees,' fair gardens filled the area
of the court, and the long galleries were lit by 1500 lamps
suspended between the columns. The edifice was known to
the Arabs as "The Crown of Mosques," and still, though
abandoned, is held in great veneration. Here at the Khédive's
invitation, the ministers of all religions tolerated in Cairo
assemble jointly to invoke the favour of heaven whenever a
tardy rising of the Nile threatens Egypt with dearth and
calamity.

The other attractions of Old Cairo are the remains of the
Roman Fortress of Babylon, and several enclosed and often
fortified convents called Dayrs, including small towns in
their boundaries, and frequently ancient Greek and Coptic
churches of very great interest to those who can spare time
for their examination. The Roman fortress just named
forms one of these dayrs, with four or five churches. The
