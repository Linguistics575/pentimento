I I 6 EGYPT.

six centuries before.

The Third Pyramid, that of Mycerinus, is only 203
feet in height, its base line being 333 feet. A wooden
mummy case and mummy from this Pyramid are now in the
British Museum. A sarcophagus, also found here, was lost
at sea with the vessel that was transporting it. The ancient
story of the fair Egyptian princess, who was said to have
reared this Pyramid with the fortunes of her lovers, and whose
voluptuous life was celebrated by Sappho, and also the story
of Rhodope, related by Strabo, are, of course, not to be

of. her slippers, but let it fall over Memphis. It was seen
by Pharaoh, the owner was sought out, and, as the story
goes, she became Queen of Egypt, and was buried in this
Pyramid.

There are several smaller Pyramids, of up special inte.

at Abooroésh, about five miles north of the Great Pyramid,
which, from its elevated site, affords a fine view of the
Ghizeh Pyramids. At Abooséér, between Ghizeh and Sak-

In the vicinity of the Pyramids of Ghizeh are many
tombs belonging to the ancient Memphian Necropolis. Some
of these are chambers excavated in the solid rock; others
are buildings erected on the surface, with deep pits leading
to the subterranean sepulchres in which the mummies were
deposited. The upper chamber, commonly called the Mas..
tabah, is usually adorned with pictures of immense historic
