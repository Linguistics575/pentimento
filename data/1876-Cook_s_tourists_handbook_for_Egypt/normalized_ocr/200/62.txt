MOSQUES. 45

Mosque building about a century after the Hegira, and gra-
dually the Saracenic style of architecture predominated
throughout the Mahomedan world. The chief Egyptian
Mosques are Saracenic.

Islamism is an enemy to plastic art; in the Mosques are
found no pictures, no statues, no representations of living
creatures. Inscriptions from the Kur-Ã©n, a single reading-
chair, a pulpit, and numerous praying mats, are all that

except the worshippers, and none of the paintings or sculp-

admitted that the Muslim artist does all he can to attain
elegance of form and harmony of colour, without infringing
his religious scruple. The subject is well commented on
in the following passage from Mr. Ruskin's Stones of
Tenioe, -

any animal form into his ornament; bat although all the
radiance of colour, all the refinemeqts of proportion, and all
the intricacies of geometrical design were open to him, he
could not produce any noble work without an abstraction of

. the forms of leafage, to be used in his capitals, and made the
ground plan of his chased ornaments. But I have above
noted that colouring is an entirely distinct and independent
art; and in the'Seven Lamps' we saw that this art had
most power when practised in arrangements of simple geo-
metrical form l the Arab, therefore, lay under no disadvantage
in colouring, and he had all the noble elements of construc-
tive and proportional beauty at his command; he might not
imitate the sea-shell, bat he could build the dome. The
