REPHIDIM. 255

Wa' dy Mukatteb, or "Written Valley," is reached by
continuing along the Seih Sidreh from the point where the
wfuly Igne joins it. The cliffs are in terraces, and on the
lower sandstone strata are clusters of inscriptions once sup-

supplied, and then the enemy is attacked, defeated, and
driven from the valley. Israel then advances to the oasis,
and encamps.

At the Oasis of Feirén, mighty c1iffs, rising to the
height of a thousand or fifteen hundred feet, look down on
the broad valley that for several miles IS filled with groves of
palm and tamarisk and apple trees, with small plots of wheat
and barley. The source of all this life aud. beauty is the
