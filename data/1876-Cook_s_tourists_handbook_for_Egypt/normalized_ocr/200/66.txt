DYNASTIES. 4 9

V. (3951 mc.) to X. (3249 mc.) Of these dynasties
little beyond the reputed names of the kings is known.

XI. (3064 me.) Thebes is now the capital. Rude monu-
ments of this period remain, attesting the second infancy
of civilization with which the Middle Empire commences.

XII. The Osirtasens were the most noted Pharaohs of
this epoch; the dynasty ended with Queen Amenemha.
At this time Egypt had again reached a high degree of
cultivation and prosperity. Lake Moeris, the Obelisk of
Heliopolis, Tombs of Beni-Hassan, Labyrinth, and many
other great works, date from the kings of this line.

XIII. (2851 a.c.) Under this dynasty the visit of
Abraham to Egypt is considered to have taken place.

XIV. (2398 n.c.) Xoite, chief city.

XV. (2ar4 a.c.) XVI., XVII. Hyksos dynasties.
Joseph was Grand Vizier of Egypt under one of the
Pharaohs of this race. Egypt was now the granary of
the nations, and enjoyed a great caravan trade with the
East.

XVIII. (1703 mc.) This dynasty, and also the New
Empire, was founded by Amosis of Thebes, who expelled
the Hyksos, and reunited the whole country. For about
250 years a time of great power and splendour for Egypt
set in. The most magnificent monuments of Thebes date
from this epoch. Several of the kings named Thothmes,
and others successively called Amunoph, were of this
dynasty. Thothmes m. was the terror of Western Asia.

XIX. (s462 B.c.) Thebes was still the capital. Ram-
eses I. Sethi I., who left many monuments, and connected
the Red Sea and Nile with a canal. Rameses Il., often
called Sesostris, one of the most warlike monarchs of ancient
Egypt, and his wars were carried on in many distant nations.
His exploits are pictured on the Theban monuments.
