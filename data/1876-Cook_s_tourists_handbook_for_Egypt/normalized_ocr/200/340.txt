of about six hours. Contrive, if possible, to spend Sunday at this deeply
interesting, historical village, where ancient sites are the subjects of con-
tention between Greek and Latin Christians, and where a beautiful edifice
has been erected for Protestant worship.

Tenth Day. -Travel from Nazareth to Carmel, crossing the riverKishon,
and passing near to the place of saerifice. Caifa, at foot of Mount Carmel,
is being rapidly brought under cultivation by acolony of Germans, who
have built an hotel and a number of cottages. Here a day or two may be
pleasantly spent if the travelling and steamer arrangements are carefully
calculated. The Austrian Lloyds steamers call at Caifa on their passage
both ways between Alexandria and Constantinople. The tour should be
arranged to harmonize with the steamboat service, which is fortnightly
both ways.

SIXTH ITIN ERARY.

Embracing Bil of the Fifrh as far as Caifa. and including
the Coast Route by Tyre and Sidon to Beyrout.

After the ten days of travel described in the Fifth Itinerary, the Sixth
Tour may be accomplished by faur additional days, as shown below F-

and encamp at Achzilr-not a heavy day if the weather is favourable. F ive
or six hours in the saddle.

Twelfth Dar-Ascend the ladder of Tyre-a rough and difficult way,

more certainty of embarking than at Jaffa.

SEVENTH ITINERARY.
The Beaten Track of a Thirty Days' Tour in Palestine.

This itinerary has been frequently described in the programmes of our
Personally-conducted Tours In the late autumn we prefer to travel from
north to south, thus going with the season. In the spring the contmry way
is preferable, as the way of the Lebanon and Mount Hermon is frequently
mowed up in the early part of the year.

Seven travelling days are shown in the Fifth Itinerary to Jenin, and
from that point we travel on the

Eighth Dar-To Nazareth, crossing the Plain of Esdmelon by Jezreel.
Gideon's Fountain, Shunem, leaving to the right Nain, Endor. Mount
