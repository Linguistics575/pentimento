shaphat togerusalem. The stay at Jerusalem can be regulated by the time
of sailing om Jaffa, The tour may occn y from ten to fourteen days.
The return journey from Jaffa may be eitherhy the direct road, via Ku-jath.
Jearim and Ramleh, or by Mizpah (Neby Samwil), Gibeon, Upper and Lower
Bethhoron, Gimzo, Lydda, and direct over plains of Sharon, or round by
Ramleh to Jaffa, The Bethhoron road will occupy two days of moderate
travel. The journey the direct way can be made in a day, either by carriage or
by tolembly good riders on horseback. The descent of nearly 3000 feet from
Jerusalem to the sea is favourable to the rider in that direction, whether by
carriage or in the saddle. At Jaffa, the returning traveller is subject to the
caprice of winds, waves, and irregular steamboat sailings, which frequently
render embarkntion a matter of great uncertainty. N evertheless it is neces-
sary to be there at the time appointed for sailing, and if the steamer is seen
to go past in the distance, wait patiently for the next.
