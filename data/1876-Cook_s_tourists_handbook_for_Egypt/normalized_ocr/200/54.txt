RAI LWAYS IN EGYPT.

The first railway was opened in Egypt about twenty

Suez soon followed; this had to be abandoned in consequence
of the difficulty of supplying intermediate stations with
water.

A new line was constructed, following the course of the
Fresh Water Canal, which conveys the Nile water to Ismai-
lia and Suez, and also supplies Port Said by pipes fifty miles
in length. The railway is connected with the main line at
Beuha, so that Peninsular and Oriental through passengers
cross to Suez without going to Cairo. The Suez Canal is,

Tantah to Damietta. Another line leads to Dessook, on
