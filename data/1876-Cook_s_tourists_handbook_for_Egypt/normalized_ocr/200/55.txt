the Rosetta branch of the Nile. A railway from Rosetta to
Alexandria is in construction, also a direct line to Port Said
from the Alexandria-Suez line. When these projects are
completed no part of the Delta will be more than 20 miles
from a railway.

The Upper Egypt railway is complete as far as Asyoot.
There is a twentyuive mile branch to Medeeneh, capital of
the Fayo6m.

A small railway is now being worked round the First
Cataract, at Assouan, and saves several days in the transport
of goods, etc., between Egypt and the Soudan.

A railway is in course of construction from WÃ©dy-
Halfa, following the Nile, through Nubia to Edabbe, ahd
then crossing the Bayuda desert to a terminus near the
junction of the White and Blue Niles, about eighty miles
from Khartoum. This railway will be 523 miles in length;
the gradients are very easy, and the cost of construction
will not be great. Wells of water are numerous along the
proposed route.

There is also a project on foot fur eventually continuing
the above line to Khartoum, and then along the northern
base of the Abyssinian Highlands to the Red Sea. It is
believed that if this railway system is completed,'passengers

andria to Massowah, to save three or four days' time, and
avoid the temperature of the Red Sea, so much dreaded by
most passengers to India.
