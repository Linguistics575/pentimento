masonry reaches 28; feet down. The other well is f feet in
diameter and 42 feet deep to the water. The action of the
ropes for so many centuries has worn deep grooves in the
kerb-stones round the wells, so that they "look as if frilled
or fh1ted all round." In the bed of the WÃ©dy is a group of
five smaller wells. The foundations and ruins of a moderately-
sized town are scattered over some low hills to the north of
the two principal wells, The vicinity is quite bare of either
trees or shrubs.

Beersheba, or Beershaba, as it is called in the earlier
records, is mentioned again in connection with Isaac, who
tarried here after digging the wells in the valley of Gerar
made by his father, which the Philistines had stopped up.
Here God renewed the Promise, and here a fresh treaty was

Simeon; see also I Chron. iv. 28. The sons of Samuel
"were judges in Beersheba "( 1 Samuel viii. 2). The expres-

the whole of the Land of Israel; as in after times, when the
ten tribes had revolted, "from Geba to Beersheba," as in
2 Kings xxiii. 8, etc., or "from Beersheba to Mount
