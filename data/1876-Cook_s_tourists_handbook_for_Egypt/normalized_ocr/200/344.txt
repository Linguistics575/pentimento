ELEVENTH ITINERARY.

instead of repeating any of the routes leading to Damascus.

and the river Awaj.

Second Dar-From Bunk to Dama via El Mismiyeh (Phaene), Shai-
rah, and Samma, seven and a half hours.

Mount Tel Amatah to view the Land of Bashan), eight hours' ride.

To make this tour, a fortnight would have to be added to a Palestine
tour which would include Damascus.

TOURS TO PALMYBA
Can be made from Damascus in twelve days for the double journey, but
Palmyra is under the power of mpadous sheikhs, and great care has to be
observed in arranging for a tour to that city of grand nuns.

TWELFTH ITINERARY.
Tour to the Great Desert and Palestine.

We conclude the series of Itineraries by indicating the general route
from Egypt to Sinai, Petra, Mount Her, and Palestine.

F arty days are required for the journey from Cairo to Sinai, Petra, and
by Mount Hor to Hebron and Jerusalem. We have not at command the
details of the tours made through the Desert by parties travelling under our
arrangements in the last two seasons. One of these parties was headed by
Dr. Strong, of Drew Semin, and consisted of ten or eleven energetic
and enthusiastic explorers. Ri, arty had with them a photographer, who
took home a tine collection of photogra hs, which were exhibited in the
Photographic Hall of the Centennial Ex ibition. An extensive map has
also been prepared by two gentlemen of the party, and other educational
results of their great tours maybe antici med. Without attempting to
define the course of these and other't'2vclli'l//s' for whom we have had the

honour to arrange, we may say here hrieily that we can take engagements
