LUXOR AND KARNAK. I77

and Alexander, are inscribed as having additionally adorned
the fabric.

Luxor is a market town, deriving its name from words
signifying "The Palaces." A great trade is carried on here
in antiquities, more or less ancient. Extreme caution is
necessary in purchasing these, even from vendors of official
position and undoubted respectability.

The road from Luxor to Karnak lies over a grassy plain,
sprinkled with scanty remnants of the ancient city. "We
rode," says the author of The Crescent and the Cross, "along
a wide plain covered with coarse grass, and varied by some
gloomy little lakes and acacia shrubs, when, at the end of an
hour, our guide mined in his horse, and pointed with his
spear towards the south. There lay Karnak-darkening a
whole horizon with portals, and pyramids, and palaces. We
passed under a noble archway, and entered a long avenue of
sphinxes" all their heads were broken off, but their pedestals
remained unmoved since the time of Joseph. It must have
been a noble sight in the palmy days of Thebes -that avenue
of two hundred enormous statues, terminated by that temple.
Yet this was only one of many; at least seven others, with
similar porticoes and archways, led from this stupendous
edifice. We rode through half-a-mile of sphinxes, and then
arrived at the temple, the splendour of which no words can
describe.

"A glorious portal opened into a vast court, crowded
with a perfect forest of the most magnificent columns, thirty-
six feet in circumference, covered with hieroglyphics, and
surmounted by capitals - all of ditferent patterns and
richly painted. No two persons agree on the number
of these apparently countless columns-some make it
amount to I 34, others to 160; the central ones measure

66 feet in height, exclusive of the pedestals and abacus.
