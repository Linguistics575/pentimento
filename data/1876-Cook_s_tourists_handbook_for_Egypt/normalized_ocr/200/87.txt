7o EGYPT.

PRINCIPAL SIGHTS.

Pompey's Pillar-The name of this celebrated
column is "really a misnomer," as intimated in Horace
Smith's well known "Address to the Mummy." It stands
on a high piece of ground, probably the _loftiest site in the
ancient city. The elegant shaft is of polished red granite,
the capital and pedestal are of inferior workmanship. The
total height is nearly 100 feet. The shaft is considered to
have formed part of an ancient temple, utilized in the erec-
tion of the present column in honour of Diocletian, after
his eight months' siege of Alexandria in 296 A.D., and san-
guinary suppression of the rebellion of Achilleus. A statue
once adorned the summit.

The Mahomedan Cemetery is very near Pom..
pey's Pillar. It is a wilderness of stones, without fence or
rail, or anything of the sort, to seclude it from the common
roadway. Many of the stones have a turban roughly carved
on the top; some are painted green, showing that the de,
ceased in his day made the pilgrimage to Mecca, or was a
descendant of the Prophet. "A group of women,"'says
one visitor to this spot, "Were sitting round an open grave,
rocking themselves to and fro, and wailing for the dead.
We had no need to draw near to hear the lamentations they
made, for the low mournful dirge with which they began
soon increased to a loud howl, and this continued nearly all
the time we remained in the neighbourhood; but it scarcely
impressed us with solemnity, certainly not with any desireto
shed sympathetic tears; for as these women are paid so
much for the job, and are constantly at it, it was a dead
certainty that they felt but little the ceremony in which they
were engaged." There is a characteristic filthy Egyptian
village overlooking the cemetery.
