154 THE NILE.

Keneh (395 miles from Cairo) is an important place
on the east bank of the Nile; ancient Crenopolis occupied
the site. It has long been noted for its dates and its danc-

in connection with this adoration. "Nothing can be more
rich," says Warburton, "than the carvings and hieroglyphics
that adorn the massive pillars crowned with heads of Isis.
The ceilings are covered with the celebrated astronomical
paintings, and the next most popular representation through-
