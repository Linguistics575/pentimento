ITINERARY TQ FIRST CATARACT. "

SE00 N D DAY.

The excursion to Sakk√©rah and the Serapeum is made, start-
ing early in the morning. An opportunity may occur on returning,
and after having visited the site where Memphis stood, to wit-
ness an important fair, held every Wednesday, at a village on
our way. Back at about noon to the steamer, which starts im-
mediately. In the afternoon pass on the right the curtailed
Pyramid, called "El Kedsib," or False Pyramid. Towards
evening reach Wasta, a village of no importance, where the
steamer generally stops for the night, unless the night be clear
and moon-lit, in which case the steamer continues its course for

on deck to ask for backsheesh. * In the afternoon pass in suc-
cession the splendid sugar factories of BibSFeshne, Maghhgha,
Ben-in-2aar, Samaloot, etc.

Towards evening Minieh is reached. it contains a fine
palace belonging to the Viceroy, who generally spends a few
weeks here in the winter; and a most extensive sugar manu-.
factory, employing about 2,000 people. A visit to this establish-
ment will well repay the trouble, and every attention is shown,
to visitors. The works generally commence in the beginning of
January, and, when in activity, the evening is the usual time to
admit visitors.

FOURTH DAY.

In two hours the boat reaches Beni-Hassan, another halting-
place for sight-seeing. Swarms of beggars, and miserable
donkeys without saddles or bridles--the worst all along the
N ile--await the arrival of the steamer. The Rock Tombs of
