ABYDOS. 153

tuary as venerated by the ancient Egyptians as the Holy
Sepulchre by Christians" In this enclosure is a mound
called the Korn-es-Sultan, formed of the débris of myriads
of tombs through successive ages. M. Mariette hopes to
find, through the excavations now in progress, the tomb of
Osiris beneath this mound. "The rich and powerful of the
Egyptians," says Plutarch, "are desirous of'being buried at
Abydos, in order to be, as it were, in the same grave with
Osiris himself." It is conjectured that it is the graves of these
worthies that have gradually formed the mound just described.

The Necropolis, from which four-fifths of the stelae
in the Boulék Museum, and many other objects, were
derived, is so completely altered and overturned as to present
little of interest to the general visitor. The tombs are chiefly
of the sixth dynasty (3700 mc.), the twelfth dynasty (3000
mc.), and the thirteenth dynasty (2800 mc.) Those of the
latter epoch are mostly in the form of a pyramid of crude
brick, the interior being hollowed out into a cupola. But
amongst the earliest tombs (sixth dynasty) in this Necropolis,
a vaulted roof with a true arch, with bricks specially formed
for its construction, is not unfrequent.

Farshoot (368 miles from Cairo) contains another of the
Khédive's sugar factories. This district is inhabited by
descendants of the once powerful Howéra Arabs.

From Girgeh to Keneh the scenery is in many parts very,
fine. Theban palms, dates, and acacias are' abundant; Indian
corn, sugar-cane, and various leguminous herbs, are flourish..
ing luxuriantly over the fertile land that delights the eye
with its perpetual greenness. N umerous small places are
passed-amongst them Bajoora (W.), How (W., anciently
Diospolis Parva), Kasr es Sydd, the ancient Chenoboscion,
formerly celebrated for its geese and now the largest depth of
turkeys on the Nile, Dishnelt (W.) and Fow (E.)
