no humanlips; and from the bold bluff of Sufs√©feh the voice
of God pronounced those Ten Words which are the final
summary of all human duty."

Jebel Moosa was for ages the traditional Sinai. The
ascent is by a grand ravine behind the Convent. The stones
have been adjusted to form rude steps. The beautiful spring
called "the, Fountain of Moses," shaded by a huge
rock, is reached after half-an.hour's climbing. Here Moses
is said to have watered the flocks of Jethro.

A Chapel of the Virgin, commemorative of delivers
ance from a famine, is next passed, with the usual ornaments,
and some paintings. According to another statement, this
chapel was built in memory of the extirpation of fleas in the
adjacent convent. After climbing some distance farther,
the two gateways are passed under, at which, formerly,
pilgrims confessed to St. Stephanos and his successors, and
were shriven before ascending to the holy heights. The
rude Chapels of Elijah and Elisha, with their common
court, now a refuge for goats and ibexes, stand on a little
plateau, with a beautiful cypress, seventy-five feet high, and a
spring of water close at hand. Monkish tradition locates
here the sublime scene in I Kings xix. 9, 10, when Elijah,
fleeing from the wrath of Jezebel, sought a refuge in "the
Mount of God," and after wind and earthquake and fire had
passed by, heard "the still small voice "speaking words of
comfort and promise. Half-arrhour's ascent by a steep
rugged path, conducts to the summit. The asserted print
of Mahomed's camel's foot, made in his famous night ride
from Mecca to Sinai and back., may be viewed in passing.

The summit of Jebel Moosa is about 7000 ft. above
the sea level and 2000 above the Convent. A Chapel
(still used), a Mosque (only used for an annual sacrifice),
and some ruins, occupy a small level space of solid rock.
