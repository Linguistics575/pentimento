Fifth Dar-From the Jordan, crossing the river above its outlet into
the Dead Sea, and making the journey of about seven hours to Heshbon.

Heshbon.

Seventh Dar-From Heshbon to Rabbath Ammon, w'a Elealeh,
seven hours' journey.

Eighth and N inth Days-r-From Rabbath Ammon to Jerash (Gerasa)

Deducting the two days allowed for the journey from Jaff'a to Jerusalem,
this tour to Moab will be accom lished in ten days of actual travel, taking
the circuitous route from Jerusa em to Mar Saba and the Dead Sea. A
longer route is given in the next itinerary.

TENTH ITINERARY.
A More Extended Tour East of the Jordan.

Taking the course described in the N inth Itinerary as far as Rabbath-
Amman, seven days of travel from Jaffa or five days from Jerusalem, from
which point we take our calculation, and begin on the

Sixth Day.-From Rahbatlr.Arnmon to Es-Salt (Ramoth Gilead).

Seventh Dar-From Jerash to Wédy Zabeis (Jabesh Gilead), via Suf
A'Glun to Helaweh, a journey of seven hours.

N a htali, seven and a half hours.

hirteenth Dar-lions Mes-el-Jabel to Bilniils (Caesarea Philippa) via
Beth Rehob and Dan, about six hours..

From Biinists to Damascus, the route has been already described in a
journey of two days, halting for a night at Kefr Hauwar. Three days
more from Damascus to Baalbec, and two days from Baalbec to Beyrout.
A Tour of twenty days of actual travel from Jerusalem, and with necessary
stoppages such a Tour ought to have forty days allotted to it, though with
hard work it might be got over in thirty days.

These Tours to the east of the Jordan would require the special Pro-
tection of the local sheikhs, and wouWinvolve costs for this protection,
varying in amount in proportion to the number of the parties. This would
have to be arranged by s ecial contract at the time, as no fixed charges can
be satisfactorily arranged? Mr. Floyd is as capable as any man to handle
these blackmail exaetions. 4
