grand army; but every battalion of the gabbling, shrieking
host seemed to be disciplined, orderly, and distinct."

The modern village of Sais is a wretched little fishing
village-a mere collection of huts. Efforts were made many
years ago to establish nitre works here, but the attempt
was a failure. Hard by are the ruins of the city of Sais,
anciently Tanis, and called in the Bible history Zoan.

Here lies, bare and gaunt, in stark and silent devas-
tation, one of the grandest and oldest ruins in the world. It
is deep in the middle of an enclosing amphitheatre of mounds,
all of them absolutely bare, and all dark-red from the
millions of potsherds that defy the winds of time, and the
dew, and the sun alike, to stir them, or even to melt away
their sharp-edged fragments.

"M. Mariette, of Cairo, lately had these ruins uncovered
(by forced labour I was told) of 500 men at a time. They
are widespread, varied, and gigantic. Here you see about
a dozen obelisks, all fallen, all broken, - twenty or thirty
great statues, all monoliths of porphyry and granite, red and
grey; a huge sarcophagus (as it seemed to me) was of softer
stone; and enormous pillars, lintel, and wall stones are piled
in heaps one over the other, most of them still buried in the
earth. The polished statues are of various sizes, and of
beautiful workmanship. Some sit with half the body over
the ground, others with only a leg in the air. One leads its
great bulk sideways, covered up to the ear; another lies with
its chair and legs appearing, but the head is buried deep out
of sight in the mud.

"The building seemed to have formed a temple, with
three outlying edifices. Some of the obelisks must have
fallen long before the dust and refuse of ages had filled the
courtly halls, then tenantless. Others fell on this new stra-
tum, and there now lie, say, ten feet higher than the floor
