and very clean, and the interior of the town is somewhat
better than usual, boasting even of a bath. The view from
Minieh is also very beautiful.".

Minieh. contains several mosques, in one of which are
columns of Roman workmanship; there are also nume-
rous baths. At a little distance various handsome buildings
are seen, apparently intermingled with the surrounding
