216 THE DESERT.

The stations at Belbeis and Bordein are successively
passed. Near the latter are the remains of the ancient
Bubastis.

"The young men of Aven and of Pi-Beseth, shall fall
by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity." So
prophesied Ezekiel (chap. xxx. 17). By Pi-Beseth is meant
Bubastis, in Coptic Poubaste. Here in ancient times the
goddess Baste, Pesht or Pasht, whom the Greeks identified
with Artemis, was worshipped. The festival annually held
at Bubastis in honour of this goddess, was the most import-

"Other temples may be grander, and may have cost more in
the building, but there is none so pleasant to the eye as this

round it, on artificial mounds. The water from the Nile
was led by a canal bordered by trees, all round the building.
And the enclosure was furthermore surrounded by a sculp-
tured wall. Only at one place a narrow passage led under a
lofty gateway to the interior. From Sir Gardner Wilkinson's
explorations it'appears that the ruins corroborate the state-

granite.

The palmy days of the city were long anterior to the
time of Herodotus, when Shishak, having conquered Thebes,
made his native town of Bubastis the capital of Egypt. The
names of Rameses II., Osorkon I., and Amyrtaeus are found
sculptured on the ruins; also the name and emblem of the
lion-headed goddess Pasht. The first mention of Bubastis
in Egyptian annals is the statement of Manetho that under
