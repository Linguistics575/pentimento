which each carries, a little above the level of the bank, from
this elevation what is dredged up is run down on an incline
(or through a long tube) to the point on the bank where it
is to be deposited, and there shot out--they are called mud-
h0ppers. They are hideous-looking objects--of all the works
of man the most unsightly, but they are what you here see
most of."

The Cutting 0f Chalouf, three miles in length, is the
. next portion of the Canal entered. This is a cutting through
a rocky plateau in which many fossil remains were found.

The Bitter Lakes are 2 5 miles across. Previous to
the flooding of this region in 1869 the lakes were simply an
extensive depression in thedesert soil about 2 5 miles long,
and varying from a quarter of a mile to six miles in width.
In the deepest parts a thick saline deposit covered the soil-
in fact, the so-called lakes were a kind of salt-water marsh.
It is considered by some, that anciently these marshes formed
the head of the Red Sea, and that it was here that the
Israelites made their miraculous passage. Marine shells are
common. -

As the lowest parts of this depression were only two or
three yards above the intended bottom of the Great Canal,
more embanking than excavating had here to be accomplished.
The channel of the Canal across these lakes is marked out
by buoys; and two lighthouses, 6 5 feet high, are placed at
important points. The traveller is, for a part of the voyage,
almost out of sight of land. A glass will show the shores
sprinkled with tamarisk trees. Many of these trees were
submerged in filling the lake, so that to a vessel, leaving the
mid-channel, snagging might occur..

Leaving the Bitter Lakes, the Canal crosses a low plain
for two miles, and then passes through the cuttings of Sera-
peum and Toussoum, six miles in length. This vicinity
