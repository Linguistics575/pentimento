slaughtered comrades, and sprang upon the battlements. It
was a dizzy height, but the next moment he was in the air 5
' another, and he was disengaging himself from his crushed
and dying horse, amidst a shower of bullets. He escaped,
and found shelter' in the sanctuary of a Mosque, and ulti-

On this occasion, 450 of the Memlooks, with their
leader, Ibrahim Bey, were killed in the Citadel, and nearly
800 more in the city.

The Citadel is built in three portions, each having its
walls and towers. The fortifications were commenced by
Saladin in I 166, the materials being brought from some small
demolished Pyramids at Ghizeh. This prince also built a
Mosque and a Palace here, which were, however, destroyed
by an explosion of gunpowder in 1823. New ones were
erected by Mahomed Ali.

The Palace of the Kh√©dive presents nothing worthy
of admiration on the outside. Inside there are some hand-
some rooms, with good views from the windows. Much of
the ornamentation is in very questionable taste. This Palace
is now used for State Receptions. The administrative
Government offices have been removed to the Esbekeeyah.

The Mosque 0f Mahomed Ali was built in 1829,
after the Constantinopolitan model; so that, although of
very costly materials, it is less interesting than the Saracenic'
Mosques of Cairo. Its ceiling is a vast cupola, surrounded
by four demi-cupolas, and four small domes at the corners.
There are two elongated minarets, a spacious court, and
pretty Cloister. The whole of the interior is lined with
Oriental alabaster, except the upper part of the columns, which
are painted to imitate that material. The decorations of the
interior are not in first-rate taste; the lanterns and lustres
have a tawdry effect.
