93 EGYPT.

what we never before suspected--that the glory of Egyptian
art belongs to the age of Cheops, and only its decadence t0
the age of Rameses 11. Not only the art, but the culture,
the religion, the political organization of Egypt are carried
back to the third dynasty (4.4 50 B.C.), and Menes, the first
historic king, dawns upon our knowledge not as a primitive
barbarian, but as the result of a long stage of unrecorded
development. I do not hesitate to say that since Champollion
discovered the key to the hieroglyphics, no scholar has thrown
such a broad and clear light upon Egyptian life and history
as Mariette."
