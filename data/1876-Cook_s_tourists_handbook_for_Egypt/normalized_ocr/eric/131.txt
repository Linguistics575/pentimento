114 EGYPT.

Beyond is the King's Chamber, the chief chamber
of the Pyramid, 34. feet 3 inches in length, 17 feet I inch
broad, and 19 feet I inch in height. It contains the remains
of a lidless sarcophagus of red granite. If the mummy of
King Cheops ever rested in it, and the Pyramid was really
built to guard that mummy, it cannot be said that the idea
has been successfully worked out. The Pyramid is there, but
the great king's remains have disappeared--how or when,
none can say..

Piazzi Smith, and others who unite in his views, assert
that the'so-called sarcophagus is really a "coffer," designed
to perpetuate a standard measure of capacity to all time, and
exactly equivalent to the laver of the Hebrews, or four quar-
ters of English measure.'

Above the King's Chamber are two or three other rooms,
apparently only constructed to lessen the immense weight of _
' the upper part of the Pyramid.

What the Pyramids really were intended for, and who
built them, are questions over which there has been an
immense amount of argument and conjecture. Egyptolo-
gists are generally agreed that they are royal tombs, reared
by successive stages, as above described, in the lifetime of
the monarch, and at his death cased over with polished
stone, and closed up. The Great Pyramid is assigned to
Cheops by Herodotus, who tells a long story about the
making of the causeway for the transfer of materials in
ten years, and the building of the Pyramid in twenty more,
100,000 men being employed, and relieved at intervals of
three months. Diodorus, Pliny, and others tell similar
stories, but all written record of the Great Pyramid is, to
say the least, doubtful. Cheops is considered to be identical
with Shoofoo, third monarch of the fourth dynasty, who
reigned over Egypt between twenty-four and forty-two cen-
