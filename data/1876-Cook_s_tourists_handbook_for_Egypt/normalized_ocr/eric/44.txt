ITINERARY'ro SECOND CATARACT. 27

over a steep path full of volcanic remains. The journey will
repay the fatigue, the view from that spot being splendid, com-
manding on one side the Nile Valley, and on the other the
desert road winding its course amid rocky hills, and close to
the village and the road itself numberless caravans lying at
.rest, or preparing for departure.

FIFTH DAY.

Stop at A'mada, about 8 miles from Korosko, and there visit
.a very interesting little temple.'

Then proceed to Derr, only 5 miles further, a large town,
the capital of lower Nubia. It is famous for its dates. Here
the steamer remains four hours, thus affording ample oppor-
'tunity for a walk through the straggling streets of the town,
which, like all other towns and villages in Nubia, consists of
mud hutS hatched with reed and palm leaves. It contains also'
a temple which may be visited, although it is not in a good state
Â« of preservation.

The same day the boat travels on to Ibrim, or Ibreem, I 5
miles from Derr. In addition to two small temples or tombs,
cut out in the rock, there is a castle built by the Romans, whence
-a fine view is to be had of the Nile and the surrounding hills.

SIXTH DAY.

Arrive at Ipsambool, or Aboo-Simbel (32 miles). The monu-
ments here are the greatest attractions Nubia has to offer to the
antiquarian student. They are hewn out of the solid rock, and are
rendered specially imposing by four gigantic figures of Rameses
II., each 66 feet high. The temple is partly choked with sand,
.and somewhat difficult of access, but the interior well repays the
texertion. It is divided into fourfcompartments, and is 185 feet
deep. The paintings and sculptures exceed in beauty and
grandeur any which the tourist has hitherto seen on the Nile.
The smaller temple, 84 feet in depth, is dedicated to Athor;
the facade is ornamented with six colossal statues of Rameses,
his wife and children. Another temple has recently been dis-
covered here (p. 203). A whole day is devoted to the exami-
nation of these temples.
