20 INTRODUCTORY.

Close by are the Priests' Tombs, the largest of which may be
visited by those who are not easily frightened by bats and rather
rough and dangerous passages.

After making a second stay at the Memnonium, the return
to Luxor is effected. If still early, a walk through Luxor and
an exploration of the Temple, mostly hidden by Arab dwellings
and stables, will finish the day.

ELEVENTH DAY.

At Luxor. The day will be entirely devoted to Karnak.
Lunch may be taken out, or passengers may return on board to
that meal, the Temple being only about a mile and a half dis-
tant. All around Thebes visitors are continually pursued by
dealers in fantiquities, mostly poor imitations; and the Consuls
themselves, who all deal in these articles, are not much better
than the rest. Be careful not to offer more than a shilling for. an
object for which ,6 I is asked, for you may be sure to get it!

TWELFTH DAY.

Starting early from Luxor, Esneh is reached at about I I a.m.,
and after visiting its Temple the journey is continued up stream,
arriving the same evening at Edfou.

THIRTEENTH DAY.

The splendid Temple of Edfou, the most complete and best
preserved monument in Egypt, and giving the best idea of the
early Egyptian architecture, is kept in custody by a government
officer, and is the only place where beggars are not allowed to
bother you for backsheesh; but they are the more ravenous
when you emerge again from the stronghold. Half a day is
devoted to this place, and it can be visited either now or on
returning; this must depend entirely on the time of arrival. If
the visit is postponed, and the steamer leaves in the morning
early, the quarries of Gebel-el-Silsileh come in view after about
five hours' sail. It is hardly worth while to go ashore, since the
few grottoes and chapels can just as well be seen from aboard;
