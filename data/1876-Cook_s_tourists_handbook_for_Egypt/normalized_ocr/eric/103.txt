86 EGYPT.

the same vicinity we read of the Egyptian town of Loui-
Tkeshromi, and at a later date of the Arab towns of El
Maks and El Kuttaéea. When Amer-ebn-el-As, the
victorious general of the Caliph Omar, subdued Egypt (see
' p. 52), he built on the site of his camp a city called Fostzit
(from Fostdt, a tent). The suburb of old Cairo marks the
site of F ostat and the western part of Bablioun.

In the tenth century the F atimites, who had been ruling
at Kayrawan in the state now known as Tunis, invaded
Egypt (see p.94), and Djauhar or Gowher, their general,
built a city as a capital for the new dynasty. It took five
years in building, was erected with all due astrological ob-

Kahir or Mars. Hence the new town was named El-Kéhera
(the victorious), known to Europeans as Cairo.

Saladin, in 1176, replaced the original brick walls
of Kéherah with stone ones, considerably extended the
city, built the Citadel (p. 90) and Aqueduct (p. 93), and
permitted Christians to settle in the city. Hence originated
the Frank Quarter of Mooskee. At the downfall of the Mem-
look rulers in 1517, and transfer of the Caliphate (p. 91),
Cairo became simply the capital of a Turkish province.
Nothing of particular importance occurred till the capture of
the city by the French after the Battle of the Pyramids (p.
74). The army of Napoleon entered the city in July,
1798. A few months afterwards goo French were massacred
in a revolt. Napoleon suppressed the revolt with his usual
relentless severity, and took more than tenfold vengeance,
more than 4000 insurgents being slain. The French occu-
pancy was of short duration. In the troublous time that
succeeded, as described in our chapter on the History of
Egypt, Mahomed Ali rose to power. Under that prince and
his successors Cairo has increased and flourished, and now
