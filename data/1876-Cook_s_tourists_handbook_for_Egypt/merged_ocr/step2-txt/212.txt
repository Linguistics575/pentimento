PHILIE. l 93

especially Ptolemy Ill. and Euergates. On the exterior
walls are many sculptures dating from the reigns of the
Roman Emperors Augustus, Tiberius, Domitian, Trajan, etc.

The temple, and other buildings in connection with it,
must once have covered the greater part of the island, around
which ran a smooth stone quay. Only portions of the quay
now remain, and desolate gaps, with piles of broken stones
intervene between the portions of the temple still in existence. There is a great want of uniformity in the plan of
the temple, which appears to disgust some visitors, and
enchant others. Some have complained that "the effect
is sadly spoiled by the perverse irregularity and unsymmetrical arrangement of all Egyptian architecture, which is nowhere shown more broadly than at Philae." Fergusson,
taking an opposite view, says, "No Gothic architect in his
wildest moments ever played so freely with his lines and
dimensions, and none, it must be added, ever produced anything so beautifully picturesque as this. It contains all the
play of light and shade, all the variety of Gothic art, with
the massiveness and grandeur of the Egyptian style, and as
it is still tolerably entire, and retains much of its colour,
there is no building out of Thebes that gives so favourable
an impression of Egyptian art as this. It is true it is far
less sublime than many, but hardly one can be quoted as
more beautiful."

The temple is approached by a colonnade commencing
at the southern end of the island, and principally erected by
Tiberius; the line of columns following the curves of the
shore. Many of the columns were never completed, the
capitals being still uncarved. Passing mounds of ruins and
fragments of an enormous lion, the massive propylon is
reached (60 ft. high and 120 broad). Figures of the god
N ilus, and emblems of various Egyptian towns are sculptured
