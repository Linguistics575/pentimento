boundary of Dongola. The first portion, for about seventy
miles, is the WÃ©dy-el-Kunfiz, then follows the Waidy N ubah
to the Second Cataract. In this part of the valley the
average width is about a quarter of a mile. A glaring reddish desert, studded with black, pointed rocks, and with
narrow strips of green and palm trees by the side, make up
scenery which is more beautiful and diversified than in
Egypt. The climate is even more perfect than north of
Assouan.

The inhabitants are a handsome mulatto race, of dark
brown complexion, bold, frank, and cheerful. In manners
they are more simple and less corrupt than their neighbours
in the Egyptian portion of the Nile Valley; they are in great
request as porters and domestic servants in the cities of
Egypt. The population of the whole country does not probably exceed 150,000.

The inhabitants are very poor, the date palm is their
great resource; they irrigate their land with sakias, whose
creaking is ceaselessly heard throughout Nubia; the castoroil plant is largely grown, and rudely extracted-with this
oil the N ubians lubricate their skins and saturate their hair.
Education of a limited character is said to be more widely
diffused amongst the poorer classes than in Egypt.

The district south of Egypt is in the Bible spoken of as
Cash, a term frequently translated as Ethiopia in our version.
The natives were evidently black, as Jeremiah (xiii. 2 3) asks
"Can the Ethiopian change his skin?" Isaiah (xlv. I4)
Speaks of the inhabitants as "men of stature." From the
first verse of the twelfth chapter of Numbers we find that the
marriage of Moses with a Cushite woman was the occasion
of murmuring on the part of Aaron and Miriam. In Psalm
lxviii. 31, Isaiah xviii. So, Jeremiah xlvi. 9, xliii. 3, are other
references to this district or its inhabitants.
