BENI-HASSAN. 141

and very clean, and the interior of the town is somewhat
better than usual, boasting even of a bath. The view from
Minieh is also very beautiful.".

Minieh. contains several mosques, in one of which are
columns of Roman workmanship; there are also numerous baths. At a little distance various handsome buildings
are seen, apparently intermingled with the surrounding

. groves of date palm; there is also a fine palace belonging to
the Khédive, built on a beautiful site about ten years ago.
The Khédive's sugar factories at this town, five in number,
are unrivalled in the world for their substantial character
and perfection of appliances; the chimneys tower to a
height of zoo feet. Here also, in spite of Mahomedan law,
his Highness annually produces several thousand gallons of
ram. The people are compelled to work in these factories
and receive a shilling a day as wages.

The boatmen of the Nile assert that the white Muslim
tomb, previously mentioned, is death to crocodiles; if one
dares to pass it he turns wrong side up and floats, a corpse,
down the river.

Passing Sooddee (E.), with its sugar plantations and a few
grottoes and mounds, the steamer next reaches Zowyet-elMyiteén (E.), where is the cemetery of Minieh, to which
the dead are ferried with funeral rites strongly reminding
the eye-witness of scenes pictured on the ancient tombs.
The custom of burying the dead on the opposite side of the
river to the city in which they dwelt is of very high antiquity in Egypt. Kom Ahmar (E.), Metcihara, (E.), and
Shanira (W.) are next passed, each with interesting caves or
grottoes, etc., for the inspection of the leisurely traveller.

Beni-Hassan is 171 miles from Cairo. From hence
to Manfaloot, especial care must be taken to guard against
the thieving propensities of the inhabitants. Some years ago
