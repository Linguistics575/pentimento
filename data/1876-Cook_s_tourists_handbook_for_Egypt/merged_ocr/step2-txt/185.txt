166 THE NILE.

an immense amount of disgraceful mutilation has been
effected, and an irreparable wrong done to science.

As soon as the visitor steps into this tomb he finds
himself, as it were, in a new world; no longer does he
behold the scenes of domestic and rural life, so pleasingly
pourtrayed at Sakkarah and Beni-hassan; all is fantastic and
chimerical; the gods are present in strange forms, long
serpents glide here and there, the judgment of the soul and
its admission to happiness are pictured forth, and inscriptions run along the walls which are hymns to the divinity
supposed to be uttered by the spirit of the dead.

A beautiful alabaster sarcophagus was found by Belzoni
in this tomb; it is now in Sir John Soane's museum in
London.

The visitor to this tomb descends by a staircase to a
passage, then by a second staircase to an oblong chamber
twelve feet by fourteen, where Belzoni found a deep pit
apparently placed to mislead explorers-this pit has been
filled up. Breaking through the walls of this chamber where
the pit was discovered, a hall was reached about twenty-five
feet square, with its walls and four supporting columns
covered with beautiful sculptures. Through a second hall,
two more passages, and a small chamber, the grand hall,
twenty-seven feet square and supported by six columns, is
reached 5 beyond this is a vaulted chamber from which the
sarcophagus, above alluded to, was taken. There is an
enclosed passage extending 150 feet further into the solid
rock, on arriving at the end of which the visitor is 470 feet
from the entrance horizontally, and 180 feet lower perpendicularly.

The Tomb of Rameses III. (No. II) commonly
called Bruce's Tomb, is much inferior in its artistic work to
that of Sethi.
