plete even than that at Denderah. The magnificent pylon
and wall of enclosure are quite unique.

Not many years ago the modern village of Edfou covered
the whole of the temple except the propylon; even the terraces of the roof were concealed by houses, and the interior
was choked with rubbish to the very ceilings. Now, thanks
to the energetic labours carried on by Mariette Bey, under
direction of the Kh√©dive, the temple, in all its completeness,
is accessible to the visitor.

The entire length of this magnificent temple is 450 feet;
the propylon is nearly 2 Jo feet in breadth, the Towers
are I feet in height, and can be ascended by 250 steps;
from the summit there is a fine view of the Nile Valley. It
is best to make this ascent before entering the temple, as in
that way a good general idea is obtained of the arrangement of the building before examining its details more
minutely. These lofty towers forming a monumental entry
to the temple seen at a great distance, used to be adorned
with immense flags. In the facade may be noticed the
aperture: in which the masts supporting these banners were
inserted.

The Temple of Edfou was founded by Ptolemy IV.
(Philopator), the sanctuary and adjoining chambers being the
work of that prince; the decoration of the central halls is
due to Ptolemy w. (Philometer), succeeding princes of the
same house continued the work of construction and decoration till the reign of Ptolemy XIII. (Dionysius), who constructed, or at least decorated the pylon. The temple was
dedicated to Her-Hat and his mother Athor, the Egyptian
Venus. In the inscriptions Her-Hat is described as "lord
of the heavens, son of Osiris, king of the kings of Lower
and Upper Egypt, master of gods and goddesses."
