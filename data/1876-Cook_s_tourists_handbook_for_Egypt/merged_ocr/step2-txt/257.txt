the former is spanned by seventy-two arches and the latter
by sixty-two, each of sixteen feet span. This great scheme
of Mahomed Ali's has never been of practical utility, as it is
considered that any attempt to darn up the Nile at high
flood would sweep the entire Barrage down the stream.

It is the right, or eastern, branch of the Nile that flows
from this point to Damietta; the western branch has been
alluded to at p. "in describing the water-route from Alexandria to Cairo. The largest of lateen sails are seen in passing along the streams of the Delta-some of the yards are
150 feet in length.

"The Damietta branch of the N ile," says a modern traveller, "has all the grandeur of a noble river. It is wider
than the Thames at Gravesend, and neither rocks nor rapids
break the stately flow. The banks are high, and they are
partly artificial, the foliage of green underwood often shades
the water; sometimes the shores are really beautiful with
splendid trees and wide spread park-like spaces, carpeted
with richest grass. The current is quickened where the banks
close in, and the Thames above Richmond Bridge was
brought to my recollection by several turns of the Nile. In
very few places is the scenery positively tame, and no two
bends of the river are alike."

Bershom, famous for figs, is passed, and the mouths of
several of the Delta canals. Benha (see p. 80) is famous
for honey. The mounds, marking the ruins of Athribis, are
seen to the north. Benha is on the railway from Alexandria
to Cairo, and there is also a branch line to Zagazig (p. 217),
by which through passengers to India cross to the Suez railway without going round by Cairo.

At Zifteh there is a station on one of the Delta railways
running to Semenhood, Talkah, and Damietta. At Al'ooser
are seen the mounds of.ancient Busirus.
