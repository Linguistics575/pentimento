SUEZ TO PORT SAID. 223

from Trieste, thirty-seven. The rate at which steamers are
allowed to pass through is from five to six knots per hour.

Considerable labour must be expended on the Canal,
especially as regards widening the deep central channel,
before a full and entire success can be considered to be
attained. The present practice of waiting in sidings, to allow
other vessels to pass is, of course, a great obstruction to the
rapidity of transit so desirable at the present day. It is, at the
present, only seventy-two feet wide at the bottom, and twentysix feet deep.

SUEZ TO PORT SAID.

(By Maritime Canal, 100 miles.)

The broad mouth of the Suez Canal (900 feet in width)
is protected by a long mole built of stone from Gebel
Att√©kah.

The Plain of Suez is cut through by the first part of
the Canal for twelve miles; the plain is low and marshy, and
the dredging machines need to be constantly at work.

"To one who is on the look out for beautiful scenery and
stirring life," says F. B. Zincke, "the two days' steaming
from Suez to Port Said will not give much pleasure. As long
as you are on the actual Canal you pass along a straight
waterway between two high hills of sand, the sky overhead is
the only additional object in Nature. There is no vegetation,
there are but few birds, there is no animal on the banks or
insect in the air. At long intervals there are small wooden
shanties for watering stations. A great many dredging
machines bare passed. They are large floating structures,
moved and worked by steam; each of them costs between
five and six thousand pounds 5 their business is to dredge up
the mud or sand from the bottom of the Canal to a lofty stage
