I 2 INTRODUCTORY.

through Lower Egypt to Ismailia and Port Said, and thence to
Jaffa. Return from Jaffa, or Caifa, to Alexandria, and then to
Naples, and by railway to Rome, Florence, Bologna, Turin, or
round by Venice and Milan to Turin en route for Paris. This
is the cheapest and most popular route to Palestine. But this
can be modified, extended or abridged in many ways. It
can be reversed through Italy, and other lines of steamers can
be taken from French or Italian ports. In all cases of personallyconducted tours it is necessary to define the route the conductor
will take, and those who keep with him will fare the best, as all
baggage, omnibus and other incidental charges are paid by him;
but if any leave him it is not possible to control these expenses,
and the travellers must then take their own course and pay the
extras. Tickets can be provided for travelling by any line of
railway or steamboat.

ROUTES FROM AMERICA TO THE EAST.

All the very best routes are under the arrangement of
Messrs. T. COOK & SON. There is not a line of steamships
crossing the Atlantic by which they cannot secure passages.
The managers of the best lines are their firmest friends, and
from both Liverpool and Glasgow they have connection with the
best railroad service of the United Kingdom. They can offer to
American travellers Pullman cars by day or night, or the best
class of select compartment carriages.

If Americans wish to go to the East by the Western Route,
tickets can be issued either by San Francisco, Japan, China and
India to Egypt, or by the route of New Zealand, Australia,
Ceylon and India.

Tickets to return to America by the south course of the
Atlantic, from Gibraltar direct to New York, without returning
through Europe can be issued; or arrangements made for
visiting Scandinavia either before or after the Palestine tour.
Spain is also re-opening to travellers since the cessation of the
war.
