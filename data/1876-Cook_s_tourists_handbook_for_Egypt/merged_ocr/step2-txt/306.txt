KERAK. 235

described: "A lofty brow pushes forward to the west, with
a flattened space on its crest-a sort of head behind which
the neck at the south-east contracts, and gives it the form of
a peninsula, at the same that the isthmus, if I may so call it,
rapidly slopes down before rising to join the loftier hill to the
east. The platform of Kerak stands 3720 feet above the sea,
yet on all sides it is commanded, some of the neighbouring
heights being over 4000 feet. It is severed except at the
neck, and at a less degree at the south-west angle from the
encircling range." On the north and south the platform
(which is triangular in shape, and measures above a thousand yards each way) is flanked by precipitous valleys, a
thousand feet deep. Strong fortifications once hemmed in
the town i of these a half-ruinous wall and seven towers still
remain. Anciently the town could only be approached by
two tunnels, each a hundred feet in length, through the
solid rock. The massive Citadel, of Crusading origin, with
its roughly-frescoed church, is on the western side of the site
of the ancient city.

Kerak is in the Bible called Kir Moab, Kir Haraseth,
Kir Haresh, or Kir Heres. When Jehoram, with the
Kings of Judah and Edom, waned against Moab, as detailed
in T Kings iii., we read that Kir-haraseth was the only
city left, "Howbeit the slingers went about it and smote it."
There, in sight of the surrounding armies, the King of Moab
offered his son to Chemosh on the city walls, and the belligerent hosts withdrew in amazed horror. The Crusaders
took this city and fortified it, and in error called it Petra,
and moreover established here a Bishopric of Petra, of which
the title is still retained in the Greek Church.

"Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence,"
says the prophet Isaiah in chap. xv. I 5 and again, "for the
foundations of Kir-haraseth shall ye mourn," (chap. xvi. 7,
