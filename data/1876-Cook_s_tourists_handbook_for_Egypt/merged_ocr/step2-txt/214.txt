PHILE. 1 95

for the punishment of those who offended the majesty of
the priesthood."

The whole area of the ancient temple was 43 f ft. long
by 135 broad, according to some measurements, but it is difficult to say how much of the surrounding ruins were adjuncts
of the temple, or separate structures.

In after times, when the Christians were in the ascendant
in Nubia, the sculptures were defaced with hammers, and
the paintings daubed with mud. In 577 A.D. the interior
of the temple became, under Bishop Theodorus, the church
of St. Stephen, and at a yet later period, a Coptic church
was built up out of the ruins.

Taken as a whole, the ruined Temple of Isis at Philae is
an elegant example of the lighter architecture of the Ptolemaic era, and does not present the aspect of colossal grandeur
seen in the Theban ruins.

There is a staircase leading to the top of the propylon.
The view is very fine, and has been thus described:
"Beneath lies the verdant and flowery islet, strewn with
marble wrought into every beautiful form known to ancient
art; over that pile of prostrate pillars, a grove of palms is
waving, from between the columns of yon small temple,
the acacia's foliage seems to gush, and its blossoms stream.
Round all the island flows the clear, bright river, and
opposite lies the old Temple of Osiris, now called Pharaoh's
Bed. Beyond the river are gleams of green, shooting across
drifts of desert sands, palms, rocks, villages, and wastes;
and over all, darkly encircling this paradise, rises the rugged
chain of the Hemaceuta, or golden mountains.

Of other ruins on the island of Philae, the principal are
as follows:
Temple of Esculapius, in front of the Temple of
Isis, near the beginning of the eastern corridor.
