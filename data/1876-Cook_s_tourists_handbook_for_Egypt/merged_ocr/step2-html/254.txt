<br/>
</span>that amount of business which inevitably would have become<br/>
fine by degrees and beautifully <span style="color: #0000FF;">less-until </span>totally lost to view.<br/>
The enormous amount of cargo carried by the steamers<br/>
trading to the East only suit large markets, and to an appreciable amount even glut them at times, and small steamers<br/>
for long voyages are <span style="color: #0000FF;">unprofitable </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3 </span>but Port Said, under the<br/>
altered circumstances, now presents a point of radiation for<br/>
the stocking of the Mediterranean seaports with the small<br/>
amounts of cargoes suitable for their requirements, and at<br/>
much less expense than roundabout sources of supply.<br/>
<br/>
"Such is the great value we put on the step taken by her<br/>
Majesty's Government, but there is one impediment in the<br/>
way, and we beg to invite the attention of the British<br/>
Government to it. Port Said ought to be made a free port,<br/>
for if the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive</span>'s Government levy a duty on all produce<br/>
landed and warehoused at Port Said in transitu for other<br/>
places and not for Egyptian consumption, such duty would<br/>
restrict commercial operations. The mere fact of taking<br/>
duties even if they were wholly remitted on export, requires<br/>
additional capital and clerical labour, and this being costly is<br/>
added to the price of the goods, raising them much above<br/>
what it would <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>were no duties collected on such goods at<br/>
all. We, therefore, trust that her Majesty's Government<br/>
will go a step further, and not consider their work finished<br/>
at its present stage, but complete the act by having Port Said<br/>
made a free port."<br/>

THE OASES<br/>
The principal <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oases </span>in the Libyan Desert to the west of<br/>
the Nile Valley, are the Oasis of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, the Great Oasis,<br/>
the Little Oasis, and the Oasis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dakhleh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>they are reached<br/>
by long desert journeys, involving considerable time <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
