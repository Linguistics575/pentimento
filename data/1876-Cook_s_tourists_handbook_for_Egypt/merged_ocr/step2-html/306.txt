<span>KERAK. <span style="color: #ff0000;">235<br/>
<br/>
</span>described: "A lofty brow pushes forward to the west, with<br/>
a flattened space on its <span style="color: #0000FF;">crest-a </span>sort of head behind which<br/>
the neck at the south-east contracts, and gives it the form of<br/>
a peninsula, at the same that the isthmus, if I may so call it,<br/>
rapidly slopes down before rising to join the <span style="color: #ff0000;">loftier </span>hill to the<br/>
east. The platform of Kerak stands 3720 feet above the sea,<br/>
yet on all sides it is commanded, some of the neighbouring<br/>
heights being over 4000 feet. It is severed except at the<br/>
neck, and at a less degree at the south-west angle from the<br/>
encircling range." On the north and south the platform<br/>
(which is triangular in shape, and measures above a thousand yards each way) is flanked by precipitous valleys, a<br/>
thousand feet deep. Strong fortifications once hemmed in<br/>
the town <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>these a half-ruinous wall and seven towers still<br/>
remain. Anciently the town could only be approached by<br/>
two tunnels, each a hundred feet in length, through the<br/>
solid rock. The massive Citadel, of Crusading origin, with<br/>
its roughly-frescoed church, is on the western side of the site<br/>
of the ancient city.<br/>
<br/>
Kerak is in the Bible called Kir Moab, Kir <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haraseth</span>,<br/>
Kir Haresh, or Kir Heres. When Jehoram, with the<br/>
Kings of Judah and Edom, <span style="color: #0000FF;">waned </span>against Moab, as detailed<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">T </span>Kings iii., we read that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kir-haraseth </span>was the only<br/>
city <span style="color: #0000FF;">left</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>"Howbeit the slingers went about it and smote it."<br/>
There, in sight of the surrounding armies, the King of Moab<br/>
offered his son to Chemosh on the city walls, and the belligerent hosts <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew </span>in amazed horror. The Crusaders<br/>
took this city and fortified it, and in error called it Petra,<br/>
and moreover established here a Bishopric of Petra, of which<br/>
the title is still retained in the Greek Church.<br/>
<br/>
"Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence,"<br/>
says the prophet Isaiah in chap. xv. I 5 and again, "for the<br/>
foundations of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kir-haraseth </span>shall ye mourn," (chap. xvi. 7<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
