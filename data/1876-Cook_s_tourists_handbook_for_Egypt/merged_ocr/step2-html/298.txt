<span>MOUNT HOR. 277<br/>
<br/>
imperishable monument to the aged priest who caught a<br/>
glimpse of the Promised Land, and then laid down to<br/>
die<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The descent from Mount Hor is very long and difficult.<br/>
Rough and steep ravines are crossed for the best part of a<br/>
day to reach the'Arabah. This wonderful valley commences<br/>
near Antioch, in Syria; through it <span style="color: #ff0000;">flows </span>the Jordan; it<br/>
contains also the Dead Sea, and the broad valley lying between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of'Akabah. The part of<br/>
the valley now entered is from ten to fifteen miles wide.<br/>
The sandstone mountains of Edom bound it on the east,<br/>
and the limestone mountains of the Tih wilderness on the<br/>
west. There are frequent areas of grass and flowers, and<br/>
acacias, and junipers abound. Most of it, however, is a<br/>
gravelly surface like the desert of Sinai. The traveller is<br/>
now entering the "wilderness of Zin," where the tribes of<br/>
Israel wandered, and with every part of which they must<br/>
have been familiar.<br/>
<br/>
'Ain <span style="color: #0000FF;">el </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Weibeh</span>, about a day and a half from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mount<br/>
</span>Hor, is the supposed Kadesh Barnea. It is on the<br/>
western side of the'Arabah, where the hills begin to slope<br/>
up towards Palestine. The whole immediate vicinity is<br/>
moist and overgrown with reeds, flags, and bushes. There<br/>
are several springs, of which four are especially conspicuous<br/>
--one of them is strongly sulphurous.<br/>
<br/>
Next to Sinai, Kadesh was the most important point in<br/>
the wilderness life of Israel. But it was a well-known place<br/>
long before. In the fourteenth chapter of Genesis we find<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Chederlaomer </span>and his associate kings coming to En-mishpat<br/>
which is Kadesh, in the course of that fierce war, the tide of<br/>
which was turned by the intervention of the great Sheikh<br/>
Abraham. Kadesh was the farthest point to which <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Israelites </span>reached in their direct journey to Palestine. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hence<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
