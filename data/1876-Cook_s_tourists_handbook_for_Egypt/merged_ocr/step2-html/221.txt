<span>202 THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
Valley on one side, and the Desert road on the other, winding its course amid rocky hills. Close to the village and<br/>
along the road numberless caravans may be seen. A traveller<br/>
in 1876 saw over 2000 camels in one immense group.<br/>
<br/>
Passing numerous rocky shoals and a considerable bend<br/>
in the river, A'mada is next reached. Here, out on the plain<br/>
of the desert, lies an elegant little temple half-buried in the<br/>
sand. The interior, though of great beauty, is in utter ruin.<br/>
Of the principal hall only a few columns remain. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>very<br/>
diminutive edifice. The shrine is ten feet square. Some of the<br/>
side chambers are only five feet square, and some five by ten.<br/>
It is, however, replete with beautifully-executed hieroglyphics<br/>
and sculpture, <span style="color: #0000FF;">vivid </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">paintings </span>of very spirited and life-like design.<br/>
<br/>
Derr (<span style="color: #0000FF;">123 </span>miles from Philae), the capital of Lower Nubia,<br/>
is simply a collection of mud huts, surrounded by <span style="color: #ff0000;">palmgroves </span>and gardens of cucumbers and melons. It contains<br/>
some three hundred inhabitants. There is an inferior temple<br/>
of the time of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>here. Crocodiles abound in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>in this vicinity.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ibreem </span>(E.) is the supposed site of Primis Parva. It is<br/>
loftily situated, well commanding the road and also the river.<br/>
Here Petronius, the lieutenant of Julius Caesar, fought<br/>
against the warriors of Queen Candace. The neighbourhood is famous for its dates, which have the reputation of<br/>
being the best in the world. As the rocks hereabouts come<br/>
down to the water's edge, bold and sharp, there is some<br/>
grand river scenery. Here, too, are the remains of a castle,<br/>
built by the Romans to hold the turbulent Ethiopians in<br/>
wholesome awe of their conquerors. In later times, Sultan<br/>
Selim followed the Roman example, and placed a garrison<br/>
here to hold the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ubians </span>in check. The descendants of this<br/>
Turkish garrison were only expelled from the place in 1811<br/>
by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks</span>. There are one or two interesting<br/>
grottoes and tombs at no great distance from I breem<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
