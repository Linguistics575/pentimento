CAIRO TO THE NATRON LAKES AND<br/>
MONASTERIES<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>This excursion is more particularly adapted for those<br/>
interested in ecclesiastical antiquities. Tents are not essential, but provisions must be taken.<br/>
<br/>
To reach the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Natrodn</span>, or Nitria, where, in the<br/>
lakes, and on the adjacent plains, the natron is gathered, the<br/>
Nile Valley must be left at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Teraneh</span>, called also <span style="color: #ff0000;">BeniSalameh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Desert of Nitria was the first place to which the<br/>
Christian hermits retired from a <span style="color: #0000FF;">corrupt </span>world in the earliest<br/>
ages of the Church. In A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">150</span>, Fronto and several<br/>
brethren retired to the valleys of the Natron Lakes. The<br/>
most famous saint of the district was St. Macarius, of<br/>
Alexandria, revered by both Latins and Greeks. He died<br/>
in A.D. 394, after sixty years of austerity and devotion in<br/>
different deserts. After thirty-eight years in the Thebaid,<br/>
he came to the Natron Lakes in A.D. 373. Of this monk<br/>
it is told, how, on receiving a bunch of grapes from a traveller, he sent it to another, and he to a third, and so it<br/>
travelled through the hands of hundreds of self-denying<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">anchorites</span>, and got back to St. Macarius himself, who rejoiced at his brethren's abstinence, but would not eat it.<br/>
The same worthy, for killing a gnat that bit him<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>gave himself for six months to the flies in the marshes of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Scete</span>, and<br/>
got stung out of all recognition by his brethren, except by<br/>
his voice. In the Lives <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Saints, and various. pictures, etc., the acts and miracles of this good father are duly<br/>
set forth. It is said that at one period the number of converts in this district was fifty, and the number of devotees<br/>
five thousand.<span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
