<span>KOROSKO. 20 I<br/>
<br/>
Egyptian fortifications are seen on the opposite side of the<br/>
river. Dakkeh was the head-quarters of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">renowned<br/>
</span>Ethiopian magi.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Koortee </span>(W.) A few ruins are discernible here.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Maharraker </span>(W.) has a picturesque little temple. All is<br/>
overthrown except two rows of columns.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mirsfdy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sahodah/ </span>or Valley of the Lions, so-called<br/>
from the dromos of sphinxes once leading up-to a temple of<br/>
Rameses, constructed of granite, with the sanctuary excavated in the solid rock. The avenue has almost entirely disappeared. Of the temple, the two towers of the pylon, the<br/>
Osiride columns of the area, and the interior chambers, still<br/>
remain. Here the Arabic language ceases to be spoken, and<br/>
the Nubian only is in use.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Korosko </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span>), though a considerable place of traffic, is<br/>
scarcely even a village. There are a few scattered huts along<br/>
the foot of the mountain, in a green oasis of a valley.<br/>
Black, frowning precipices enclose the gorge through <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>lies the desert route to Shendy and Sennaar. This is a starting-point for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khartoum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The route, 200 miles in length, is<br/>
one of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">worstjn </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">desert-water </span>being only procurable<br/>
at one stopping-place, and wild Bedouins very troublesome.<br/>
The mountain is of a most curious shape, and is of volcanic<br/>
origin. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">peak'f </span>Awes-el-Guarany "is held sacred by<br/>
the natives, and is a point of pilgrimage as being the tomb<br/>
of the saint from whom the mountain derives its name.<br/>
There are innumerable tablets and inscriptions here recording the names of pilgrims. Sometimes those of one family<br/>
through many generations. The steamer <span style="color: #ff0000;">stOps </span>long enough<br/>
to allow for the ascent of the peak to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">made-rather </span>a<br/>
difficult task, as the steep path is strewn with <span style="color: #0000FF;">volcanic </span>remains. The journey will however well repay the fatigue,<br/>
more especially if sunrise or sunset can be seen at the same<br/>
time. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">View </span>is magnificent, comprehending the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
