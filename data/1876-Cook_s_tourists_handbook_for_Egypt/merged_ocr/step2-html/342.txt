<span>TOURS IN EGYPT, PALESTINE, ETC. vii<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From Beyrout the usual course is to take steamer along the coast to<br/>
Cyprus, Rhodes, Smyrna, and Constantinople; from thence to Syra and<br/>
Athens, and back to Italy and Austria. But of the routes to and from<br/>
Palestine we shall speak when we have done with this series of itineraries.<br/>
<br/>
EIGHTH ITINERARY.<br/>
<br/>
Combining all that is included in the Seventh, with the<br/>
addition of the Coast Route by Sidon. Tyre, and<br/>
Carmel to <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ths</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Forty days are required to do justice to this extended tour, which should<br/>
commence at Beyrout, and be taken in the following routine to Jaffa, from<br/>
which point the whole of the Seventh Itinerary may be taken, as given<br/>
above <span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--<br/>
</span>First <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dar-Start </span>with the camp from Beyrout, cross a sandy plain, and<br/>
get to the coast as soon as practicable, continuing near to the sea to Sidon.<br/>
Seven to eight hours will be required for this section.<br/>
<br/>
Second Day .--<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pass </span>the little village or "city of Sarepta," as described<br/>
of old, to Tyre, and stop there a night. Six or seven hours in the saddle.<br/>
<br/>
Third <span style="color: #0000FF;">Day</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-Descend </span>the Tyrian Ladder to the Valley of the Kishon,<br/>
halting for a night at Acre. A day's ride of about six hours.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dar-Pursue </span>the course from Acre to the foot of Mount<br/>
Carmel, and encamp there. It will be interesting to visit the monastery,<br/>
and get the commanding view which its position affords of the "great sea"<br/>
and the Carmel range, which are full of interesting Scripture memories.<br/>
<br/>
Fifth and Sixth Days should suffice for the journey by the coast, past<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Caesarea</span>, the seat of Roman power and magnificence, and the scene of<br/>
various events and incidents recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. There<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>not much left to indicate the magnificence of the palace that existed<br/>
t ere.<br/>
<br/>
As indicated above, having arrived at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jaffa</span>, the route already described<br/>
may be taken just as it stands in the Seventh Itinerary, or deviations may<br/>
be made at discretion. Either way, by Kirjath-Jearim or Bethhoron, may<br/>
be taken to Jerusalem, or it would be practicable to go southward to<br/>
Philistia, reversing one or other of the itineraries already given, round by<br/>
Gaza or Gath to Hebron, and thence to Jerusalem. In forty days this<br/>
might be accomplished.<br/>
<br/>
The foregoing eight itineraries cover the chief districts of interest west<br/>
of the Jordan and in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lebanon </span>We now propose to cross the Jordan,<br/>
and show a couple of practicable routes in the Land of Moab, and one in<br/>
the Hauran to the east of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damascus<br/>
<br/>
</span>NINTH ITINERARY.<br/>
First Tour to Moab.<br/>
<br/>
Jaffa to Jerusalem, as already described, by carriage or saddle horses in<br/>
one day or <span style="color: #0000FF;">two</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>allowing two days for the journey, we begin on the<br/>
<br/>
Third <span style="color: #0000FF;">Day-And </span>take trip, already described, by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Solomon</span>'s Pools and<br/>
Bethlehem to Mar Saba.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dar-From </span>Mar Saba to the Dead Sea and the Jordan, encamping on the bank of the river after a journey of about seven hours<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
