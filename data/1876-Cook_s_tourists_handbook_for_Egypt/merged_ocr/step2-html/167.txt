hundred feet, perhaps a little more. About two miles<br/>
further north the ridge ends, and from that point we could<br/>
see as far as the eye could reach, the yellow brown sand of<br/>
the Libyan desert, following the thin strip of green on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>edge of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>. Just here the cultivated land for a considerable distance northward did not look more than a mile<br/>
and a half or two miles in breadth, and it was like a long<br/>
green ribbon following the course of the river, with the<br/>
yellow desert beyond. On the eastern bank the line of<br/>
green is much thinner, up to this point the fertile strip<br/>
between the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>and the Arabian desert has scarcely ever<br/>
been more than a mile broad, and for many miles the limestone rocks of the desert have come right down to the river.<br/>
It was impossible not to remember the famous passage in<br/>
Ezekiel,' These waters issue out towards the East country,<br/>
and go down into the desert.... and everything shall <span style="color: #0000FF;">live<br/>
</span>whither the river cometh.' "<span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>

College, opposite the landing place. The professors are always<br/>
willing to have the boys examined by visitors.<br/>

El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mudmur</span>, with more acacias, "a whole realm of trees, a<br/>
billowy bank of golden green on which the sunbeams sleep<br/>
at noon,.. and populous with doves, hoopoes, and birds<br/>
of every bright plumage." These trees are considered to<br/>
represent one of the classic groves of Acanthus. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sherg<br/>
