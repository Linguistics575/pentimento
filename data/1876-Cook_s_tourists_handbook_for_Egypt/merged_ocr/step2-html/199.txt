can be done by the rapid tourist is to get correct general<br/>
impressions, and fill in the details at leisure. The author<br/>
last quoted says, "From the desert or the river, from within<br/>
or from without, by sunshine or by <span style="color: #0000FF;">moonlight-however<br/>
</span>you contemplate <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak-appears </span>the very aspect in which<br/>
it shows to most advantage. And when this was all perfect,<br/>
when its avenues opened in vistas upon the noble temples<br/>
and palaces of Sesostris, upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goumou</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-Haboo</span>, and<br/>
Luxor<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>when its courts were paced by gorgeous priestly<br/>
pageants, and busy life swarmed on a river flowing between<br/>
banks of palaces, like those of Venice magnified a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hundredfold-when </span>all this was in its prime, no wonder that its fame<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">spread </span>even over the barbarian world, and found immortality<br/>
in Homer's song.<br/>
<br/>
"For many a day after I had seen it, and even to this<br/>
hour, glimpses of Thebes mingle with my reveries and blend<br/>
them with my dreams, as if that vision had daguerreotyped<br/>
itself upon the brain and left'its impress there for ever."<br/>

The next place to notice, after leaving Luxor, is Erment,<br/>
where more sugar making is going forward on a very extensive scale; here are some ruins of the town of Hermonthis,<br/>
consisting chiefly of a small Ptolemaic temple containing<br/>
what is considered the authentic portrait of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cleopatra</span>. Tuot<br/>
(E.), the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gebelayen </span>Ridge (W.), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mutant </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>(W.), and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tojh√©es </span>(W.), site of ancient Aphroditopolis, offer nothing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">specially </span>worthy of notice..<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>miles from Luxor), pop. 7000, is a place<br/>
of considerable trade, with bazaars, a well-stocked market,<br/>
and a colony of the dancing girls; it is considered the most<br/>
healthy town in Egypt, and has been called "the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most<br/>
