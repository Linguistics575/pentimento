of persons of all nationalities are seen seated at the open-air<br/>

</span>"The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbékyeh </span>may stand for the Champs Elysées. Towards two o'clock, when the heat begins to diminish, one<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bears </span>in Cairo a vague sound, joyful as the warbling or chirping of birds at morn. The siesta is finished, the town is<br/>
rousing <span style="color: #0000FF;">itself</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the European and Arab orchestras instal themselves in the cafés of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekeeyah</span>, and the crowd <span style="color: #0000FF;">responds<br/>
</span>to their summons. All nationalities gather together, and<br/>
mingle or group themselves in the various cafés..<br/>
In the variegated crowd are seen the antiquity-merchants,<br/>
with articles from Syria or Soudan, circulating amongst the<br/>
groups till night, and puffing their <span style="color: #ff0000;">wares</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">snake..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">charmers</span>, with collars and girdles of serpents; the jugglers,<br/>
agitating strange marionettes by moving the knee<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Franks</span>,<br/>
..... <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>the Greeks and the Jews<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the merchants<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">cucumbers</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the flower-girls, loaded with flowers<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>lastly,<br/>
the rich ladies, Levantines on asses or mules, silver caparisoned, and occasionally the wife of a cadi, or other great personage, surrounded by servants and eunuchs."<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mooskee </span>is a fine street running from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekeeyah </span>through the very heart of the city. It forms the Frank<br/>
Quarter, and is' well <span style="color: #0000FF;">provided </span>with shops. At places there<br/>
are covered galleries.<br/>
<br/>
