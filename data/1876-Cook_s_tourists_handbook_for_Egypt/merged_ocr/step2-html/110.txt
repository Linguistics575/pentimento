<span>CAIRO. 93<br/>
<br/>
On the left of the entry a golden grill encloses the tomb<br/>
of Mahomed Ali, with the lamps perpetually burning. In<br/>
the court there is a pavilion in the gallery facing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fours</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tain </span>of Ablutions, containing a clock presented to Mahomed<br/>
Ali by Louis Philippe. From above this pavilion there is a<br/>
splendid prospect of Cairo and Lower Egypt, which some<br/>
have asserted to be the finest view in the world. At the foot<br/>
of the Citadel, stretching northward, lies Cairo, with its<br/>
innumerable domes and minarets; beyond stretches the<br/>
verdant Delta. On the right are seen the Tombs of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks</span>, and the Obelisk of Heliopolis; on the left are<br/>
Old Cairo and the well-wooded Island of Roda, more domes<br/>
and minarets and palaces, the grand Aqueduct, and the river<br/>
Nile, and beyond these the Pyramids of Ghizeh and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah</span>, and the Great Desert of Libya. Turning to the<br/>
south, Mount Mokattam is seen, with its rugged steeps, its<br/>
quarries, and its ruins. Anyone staying at Cairo should<br/>
endeavour to see this view <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">least </span>two <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>three times at<br/>
different periods of the day.<br/>
<br/>
Joseph's Well is another of the curiosities of the<br/>
Citadel. It has nothing to do with the Patriarch, as popularly asserted, but owes its origin to Saladin, whose Arabic<br/>
name was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Youssoof </span>(Joseph), and was sunk for the military<br/>
necessities of the fortress. According to another account,<br/>
Saladin utilized an ancient Egyptian well discovered by him<br/>
in sinking for foundations. It is fifteen feet in diameter,<br/>
and reaches the Nile level at a depth of 290 feet. A winding staircase conducts to the bottom, where the donkeys are<br/>
seen at work raising the water to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">top </span>by means of an<br/>
endless chain, with vessels attached to it. There is also an<br/>
Aqueduct, bringing Nile water from Old Cairo to the<br/>
Citadel.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the above-mentioned buildings, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Citadel<br/>
