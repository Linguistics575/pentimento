The Churches in Cairo present no particular attraction<br/>
for mere sight-seers. The Coptic Church of El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moalléke<br/>
</span>(the Suspended) is curious. It is so called from its being<br/>
at a considerable height above the ground, and approached by<br/>
a flight of'stairs.<br/>

Consulate. The Palace of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gezeereh </span>stands on an island<br/>
formed by a branch of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, and was built by the present<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>, Ismail Pasha. The Empress Eugénie and the<br/>
Emperor of Austria have been entertained here. .The ballroom, reception-rooms, hall, and staircase are very fine.<br/>

African birds and beasts.<br/>

Mosques. Free use of the library is permitted on every day<br/>
except Friday. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Schools </span>of Cairo are numerous.<br/>
