played in the sculptures, the magnificence of Karnak greatly<br/>
increased. Monarch after monarch whom it were needless<br/>
to name here took a pride in adding to the glory of the<br/>
Theban temples and palaces. Rameses II., of whom we<br/>
have heard at Abydus, did much memorable work here also,<br/>
as will be pointed out in describing the monuments. A few<br/>
kings of lesser note succeeded, and then Rameses III.,<br/>
builder of the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-Haboo</span>, finished the record<br/>
of Theban powers and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Splendour</span>. Weak kings succeeded;<br/>
foreign possessions slipped from their <span style="color: #0000FF;">grasp</span>; and Thebes<br/>
became merely a vassal province to the new dynasties of<br/>
Bubastis and Tanis, in the Delta. Its fall is as obscure as<br/>
its origin.<br/>
<br/>
When the dynasties of Lower Egypt were terminated by<br/>
Persian conquest, the great General Cambyses marched<br/>
southward to conquer Ethiopia. Turned back from the<br/>
intended exploit by famine, and irritated by the loss in the<br/>
desert sands of 50,000 men whom he had sent to conquer<br/>
the oases, he madly wreaked his vengeance on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>After burning and destroying the temples and palaces, he<br/>
plundered the tombs, and left the city in a ruined condition,<br/>
from which, however, it largely recovered. Theban commerce was utterly lost by the rapid growth of Alexandria<br/>
under the Ptolemies. These princes made some considerable<br/>
additions to the temples, etc<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>in these additions the<br/>
influence of Greek art is, of course, very perceptible.<br/>
<br/>
"The reign of Ptolemy Lathyrus," says the author just<br/>
quoted, "is remarkable for the rebellion of Thebes, and for<br/>
the final consummation of her ruin. It had long been falling in trade and wealth, and had lost its superiority in arms;<br/>
but its temples, like so many citadels, its obelisks, its<br/>
colossal statues, and the tombs of its great kings, yet<br/>
remained, and with them the memory of its bygone glory<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
