and very clean, and the interior of the town is somewhat<br/>
better than usual, boasting even of a bath. The view from<br/>
Minieh is also very beautiful.".<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Minieh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>contains several mosques, in one of which are<br/>
columns of Roman workmanship; there are also numerous baths. At a little distance various handsome buildings<br/>
are seen, apparently intermingled with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">surrounding<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>groves of date palm; there is also a fine palace belonging to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>, built on a beautiful site about ten years ago.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>'s sugar factories at this town, five in number,<br/>
are unrivalled in the world for their substantial character<br/>
and perfection of appliances; the chimneys tower to a<br/>
height of zoo feet. Here also, in spite of Mahomedan law,<br/>
his Highness annually produces several thousand gallons of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ram</span>. The people are compelled to work in these factories<br/>
and receive a shilling a day as wages.<br/>

The boatmen of the Nile assert that the white Muslim<br/>
tomb, previously mentioned, is death to crocodiles; if one<br/>
dares <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pass </span>it he turns wrong side up and floats, a corpse,<br/>
down the river.<br/>
<br/>
Passing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sooddee </span>(E.), with its sugar plantations and a few<br/>
grottoes and mounds, the steamer next reaches <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zowyet-elMyiteén </span>(E.), where is the cemetery of Minieh, to which<br/>
the dead are ferried with funeral rites strongly reminding<br/>
the eye-witness of scenes pictured on the ancient tombs.<br/>
The custom of burying the dead on the opposite side of the<br/>
river to the city in which they dwelt is of very high antiquity in Egypt. Kom Ahmar (E.), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Metcihara</span>, (E.), and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Shanira </span>(W.) are next passed, each with interesting caves or<br/>
grottoes, etc., for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inspection </span>of the leisurely <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Beni-Hassan is 171 miles from Cairo. From hence<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Manfaloot</span>, especial care must be taken to guard against<br/>
the thieving propensities of the inhabitants. Some years <span style="color: #0000FF;">ago<br/>
