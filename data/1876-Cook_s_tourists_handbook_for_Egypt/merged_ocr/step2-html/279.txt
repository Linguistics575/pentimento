Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Katereena</span>, the highest peak of them all, but also<br/>
hidden from the plain by other peaks of its own range.<br/>
<br/>
"It is a view," says Captain H. S. Palmer, "which once<br/>
seen is not likely to be forgotten. Indeed, the whole prospect from this point is so beautiful and sublime that no<br/>
beholder can fail to be impressed by it. It is indeed unrivalled <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>there is nothing else like it in this or any other<br/>
part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">peninsula-the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">long</span>, wide plain sloping down to<br/>
the mount, the grand outlines of the surrounding hills, and<br/>
the stately cliffs of the R215 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sufséfeh</span>, the' brow' of Sinai,<br/>
or Jebel Moosa, overlooking and seen from every point of<br/>
the plain below, the most conspicuous and imposing feature<br/>

the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy-ed-Dayr</span>, where the camp is often pitched during<br/>
a visit to the Convent and the exploration of the vicinity.<br/>

<br/>
Visitors to the Convent of St. Catherine, if arriving with<br/>
proper <span style="color: #ff0000;">letters'of </span>introduction from the branch convent at<br/>
Cairo, are not now hoisted up thirty feet to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">postern </span>in<br/>
the wall, as formerly. The heavy iron gates are opened,<br/>
