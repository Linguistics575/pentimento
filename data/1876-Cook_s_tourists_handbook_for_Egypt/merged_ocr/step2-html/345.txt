and supply all necessary camp <span style="color: #0000FF;">equipment</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>for tours through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Desert</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>and in every engagement of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">kind </span>we will employ none but the most<br/>
trustworthy dragomans, who will do justice to the travellers as well as to<br/>
ourselves. A graduated scale of charges, according to the number of party,<br/>
is adopted; and we can take engagements for Desert travelling nearly as<br/>
cheap as for Palestine. But the details and conditions of such tours are<br/>
best settled by private negotiation, and we are ready to go into them as<br/>
soon as required.<br/>

<br/>
NILE TOURS TO THE FIRST <span style="color: #ff0000;">& </span>SECOND <span style="color: #ff0000;">GATARAGTS</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Our reference to these tours in connection with this series of itineraries<br/>
will be very brief. For eight years the agency for Nile tours has been<br/>
committed to us by the Khedivie Administration. During that time constant <span style="color: #0000FF;">improvements </span>have been made in the service; steamers have been<br/>
fitted <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>deck saloons, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sleepin </span>berths greatly improved.<br/>
The food supplies have been under our <span style="color: #0000FF;">contra </span>to a great extent, and will be<br/>
emphatically so in the future, as we intend to exercise more rigid regulations<br/>
for the interest and comfort of voyagers. Contractors, dragomans, and<br/>
servants of every grade will be most vigilantly watched and rigidly dealt<br/>
with if any incivility or inattention is shown to <span style="color: #0000FF;">passen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ers</span>. Last <span style="color: #0000FF;">season's<br/>
</span>extension of arrangements for the Second Cataract will be improved, and<br/>
we ho e ere long to see a class of steamers on the Nile that will ensure a<br/>
large <span style="color: #ff0000;">assenger </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">semce </span>of steamers commences in November, and Nile trips <span style="color: #ff0000;">may<br/>
</span>precede or follow tours to Palestine as most convenient to the travellers who<br/>
wish to embrace the two objects in one visit to the East. The trips to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">First </span>Cataract and back occupy twenty days, and fifteen more are allowed<br/>
for trips to the Second Cataract.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">DAHABEAHS </span>can also be secured on the best terms for all who desire<br/>
them, and dragomans and other necessary servants and <span style="color: #0000FF;">food </span>supplies can be<br/>
arranged <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>us on the best terms. Our <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>at Cairo, on the grounds of<br/>
Shepheard <span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>Hotel, affords excellent facilities for the management of this<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">business</span>. Early application is necessary to secure the best boats and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">best </span>men.<br/>

<br/>
PERSONALLY-CONDUCTED PARTIES<br/>
<br/>
Are arranged for several tours to the Nile and Palestine, or for Palestine<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">without </span>the Nile. These parties leave London at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">latter </span>end of Se <span style="color: #ff0000;">tember</span>, or in October, for Autumnal Tours. These arrangements <span style="color: #0000FF;">will<br/>
</span>followed by others throughout the winter and early spring. We have<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">generally </span>at least three parties under personal escort for the months <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
