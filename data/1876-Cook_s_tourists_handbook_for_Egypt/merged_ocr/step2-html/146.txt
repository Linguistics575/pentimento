<span>SAKKARAH. 129<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Tih and the Tomb of Phtah-hotep<br/>
are the two best examples for the tourist to examine, of<br/>
the ancient Empire tombs previously described.<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">neighbourhood </span>of Cairo, if time allows, several<br/>
other interesting spots may be visited besides those we have<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>described. There are the Tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks</span>,<br/>
about a mile from Cairo, beautiful examples of Saracenic<br/>
mausoleums, now almost entirely given over to wild dogs<br/>
and outcast Arabs. The Petrified Forest is about five<br/>
miles further from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">city-a </span>desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">space </span>covered with<br/>
fragments of sycamore and palm, apparently turned to stone.<br/>
It is worth while, if it can be managed, to extend this trip<br/>
to the summit of the Mokattam Mountains, where<br/>
much more of the petrified wood will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">seen-some </span>of it<br/>
in the actual position it occupied in growing. This petrified<br/>
timber has no connection with <span style="color: #0000FF;">any </span>living vegetation of<br/>
Egypt at the present day.<br/>
<br/>
Tourists interested in hydraulics may like to visit the<br/>
Barrage, a grand undertaking commenced by Mahomed<br/>
Ali in 1847, intended to keep back the Nile waters during<br/>
the eight months of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ebb-tide </span>after the inundations. It has<br/>
never been completed, and now simply obstructs navigation<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9-235</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>
</span>It may not be uninteresting to some readers if a portion<br/>
of a letter written to the Editor were inserted here, bearing<br/>
upon the pleasures of Cairo life, and the beneficial effect of<br/>
the climate on health.<br/>
<br/>
"I was given up at home, or I never should have come<br/>
here. As you know, I was a martyr to almost everything,<br/>
and everybody kindly prophesied that I <span style="color: #ff0000;">should'go </span>off in a<br/>
rapid consumption.' But twice I <span style="color: #0000FF;">spent </span>a month here, and<br/>
twice I returned <span style="color: #0000FF;">home-as </span>I heard it <span style="color: #0000FF;">whispered</span>,'to die.'<br/>
But I am here now, for my third winter, and I have no doubt<br/>
<br/>
