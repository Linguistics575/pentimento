On their Sabbath-day <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahomedans </span>may transact worldly<br/>
affairs in the intervals of prayer. On that day the <span style="color: #ff0000;">readingchair </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pulpit </span>are brought into use. Portions of the Kur-Ã©n<br/>
are read or recited, and a sermon preached by an Imaum,<br/>
who sits on the top step of the pulpit stairs.<br/>
<br/>
Almsgiving is the second duty of Muslim faith. Certain<br/>
alms are compulsory, others voluntary, but highly meritorious.<br/>
The third duty, fasting, is chiefly in the month of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramadan</span>, when with cruel severity the practice is carried out from<br/>
sunrise to sunset. The fourth great duty is the pilgrimage<br/>
to Mecca and Mount Arafat, which all good <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahomedans<br/>
</span>should accomplish once in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
The Caravan of Pilgrims bound for Mecca starts from<br/>
Cairo annually with great <span style="color: #0000FF;">display </span>of ceremonial and rejoicing (p. 107). For the principal <span style="color: #ff0000;">Muslim </span>Festivals, see p. 84.<br/>
<br/>
THE MOSQUES<br/>
<br/>
are the buildings, as before mentioned, in which the Muslim<br/>
rites of worship are conducted. Some of the principal are<br/>
described in the account of Cairo (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">94</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>) The first Mosque<br/>
was built at Medina, Mahomed assisting in the work with<br/>
his own hands. It was situated in a graveyard, planted with<br/>
date-trees, and was a square, capacious structure, with brick<br/>
and earthen walls, the trunks of the palms forming columns<br/>
to support the roof, and a thatch of palm-leaves covering<br/>
the whole. It had three doors. A portion of the edifice was<br/>
given to the houseless poor. Here Mahomed was buried.<br/>
The first building was long ago replaced by a larger edifice,<br/>
but it is still called Mesjid-en-nebi ("The Mosque of the<br/>
Prophet "), and has been the model for all Muslim temples<br/>
throughout the world. But the Arabian simple elegance<br/>
became in Spain highly ornate, in Turkey florid, in India<br/>
effeminate. The cupola and minaret became adopted <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
