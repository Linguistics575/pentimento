CATARACT.<br/>
<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">FIRST </span>DAY.<br/>
<br/>
At Philae, <span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>miles from Assouan. Having now left the confines of Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">proper</span>, Nubia is entered. The steamer by which<br/>
the voyage is continued will be in readiness, and the baggage<br/>
transferred from the other steamer. The starting takes place<br/>
soon after getting on board.<br/>
<br/>
An <span style="color: #0000FF;">hour-and-a-half</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>course, and Debod, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dabod</span>, a small<br/>
village on the west side of the river, is reached. Here is a ruin,<br/>
in a good state of preservation, of a temple commenced by the<br/>
Ethiopian King, Ashar-Amun. The steamer stops here for<br/>
the night, and, according to the time of arrival, the excursion is<br/>
made the same day or the following morning.<br/>
<br/>
SECON D DAY.<br/>
<br/>
The distances between the places of interest on the Upper<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>are very short, and, with few exceptions, they all lie within<br/>
a few minutes from the steamer, so that although ample time is<br/>
allowed for sight-seeing, several may be visited in the same day.<br/>
<br/>
In two hours Kardash or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gertassee </span>is reached, 15 miles from<br/>
Debod, which possesses the remnant of a temple and a quarry.<br/>
<br/>
In a few hours more the narrow part of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, called<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Kalabsheh </span>"or Strait of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalabsheh</span>, is passed. For a<br/>
distance of four or five miles the granite mountains enclose the<br/>
river on either side, offering at every curve varied views of<br/>
most grand and wild scenery. When in the broad stream<br/>
again, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalabsheh </span>is soon reached. The steamer stops here four<br/>
hours and passengers visit the ruins, which are of some size and<br/>
beauty, and consists of the remains of two temples; one, the<br/>
largest temple in Nubia, must have been, when perfect, a magnificent pile. In some chambers to which access can be <span style="color: #ff0000;">gained<br/>
