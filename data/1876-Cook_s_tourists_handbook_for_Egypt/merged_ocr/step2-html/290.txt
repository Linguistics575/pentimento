edge of the water. Several bold headlands scarcely leave<br/>
room to pass in single file, and sometimes a <span style="color: #0000FF;">de'tour </span>must be<br/>
made in consequence of the shore path being closed.<br/>
Myriads of curious and beautiful shells in endless variety,<br/>
and some of them very rich, lie on this wild shore.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Akabah </span>is an Arab village at the north east end of the<br/>
gulf. About forty soldiers keep guard in its sixteenth<br/>
century castle. It derives its importance as a station on the<br/>
great pilgrim route from Egypt to Mecca. A vessel comes<br/>
annually with supplies from Suez.<br/>
<br/>
'Akabah is in itself fitted to be a great place. It stands<br/>
on a convenient plain surrounding the head of the bay, at<br/>
the mouth of the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">WLly'Arabah</span>. Facing the sea is a<br/>
grove of palms half a mile long. The climate is delicious<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but in spite of many favourable circumstances the town<br/>
seems utterly barren of all activity and resources. Next<br/>
to nothing is done to develop a commerce, either from the<br/>
land or sea<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>a few dirty figs, dates, and raisins are the sole<br/>
products. The Arabs catch a few fish by wading out breast<br/>
deep and throwing a hook or light net.<br/>
<br/>
The ancient Elath, or Eloth, was probably at the northeastern head of the gulf, and hence this portion of the Red<br/>
Sea was often termed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Elanitic </span>Gulf. The town is first<br/>
mentioned in the wanderings of the Israelites (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Dent</span>. ii. 8).<br/>
When (2 Sam. xviii. 14) David conquered Edom, and<br/>
"throughout all Edom put he garrisons," Elath probably<br/>
came into his possession. Hence in Solomon's reign it was<br/>
a Jewish port of entry for the wealth of the unknown lands<br/>
beyond<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>through its gates flowed to Jerusalem the gold and<br/>
silver, and precious stones and other treasures, till copper<br/>
became as iron, and gold as silver in the streets of the holy<br/>
city (see <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>Kings ix. 26, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">2 </span>Chron. viii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It</span>). When<br/>
Edom rebelled against Judah, Elath was lost for a time (<span style="color: #0000FF;">s<br/>
