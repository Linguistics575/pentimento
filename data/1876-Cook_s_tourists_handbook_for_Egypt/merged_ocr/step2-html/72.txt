BIBLE ASSOCIATIONS.<br/>

The land of Egypt is of course rendered specially memorable to every believer in the inspired volume, as being the<br/>
scene of the captivity of the Israelites, and the events connected therewith, as detailed in the last fourteen chapters of<br/>
the Book of Exodus; also of that marvellous deliverance,<br/>
accompanied by miracles, set forth in the first fourteen chapters of the Book of Exodus. A portion of the New Testament narrative is also connected with this country, for to<br/>
Egypt the Holy Family fled from the wrath of Herod (Matt.<br/>
ii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">13-zo</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The earliest scriptural event recorded in connection with<br/>
Egypt is the journey of Abraham to that country at the<br/>
time of a famine in Canaan (Gen. xii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">10</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20</span>). The annual<br/>
inundation of the Nile would often plentifully supply Egypt<br/>
when other countries were suffering from scarcity of rain.<br/>
<br/>
The wonderful history of Joseph commences in Gen.<br/>
xxxvii. The events of the next 500 years need no recounting here. The high office to which Joseph succeeded in the<br/>
land, the settlement of the Israelites in Goshen, and the<br/>
change in their treatment under the new dynasty that knew<br/>
not Joseph, and their escape from cruel thraldom by a series<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">miracles-all </span>this is of course familiar to every traveller<br/>
in Egypt, and the Bible itself will be the best handbook<br/>
from which to refresh his memory on these important<br/>
historical <span style="color: #0000FF;">associations</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Between the Egyptians and Jews a frequent intercourse<br/>
seems to have been maintained. In Deut. xxiii. 7 the<br/>
Israelites were told, "Thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
