six centuries before.<br/>

The Third Pyramid, that of Mycerinus, is only 203<br/>
feet in height, its base line being 333 feet. A wooden<br/>
mummy case and mummy from this Pyramid are now in the<br/>
British Museum. A sarcophagus, also found here, was lost<br/>
at sea with the vessel that was transporting it. The ancient<br/>
story of the fair Egyptian princess, who was said to have<br/>
reared this Pyramid with the fortunes of her lovers, and whose<br/>
voluptuous life was celebrated by Sappho, and also the story<br/>
of Rhodope, related by Strabo, are, of course, not to be<br/>
taken as historic truth. Rhodope was a beautiful Greek<br/>
girl, who, whilst bathing in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, attracted the very birds<br/>
of the air with her beauty. An eagle flew away with one<br/>
of. her slippers, but let it fall over Memphis. It was seen<br/>
by Pharaoh, the owner was sought out, and, as the story<br/>
goes, she became Queen of Egypt, and was buried in this<br/>
Pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
There are several smaller Pyramids, of no special interest to the ordinary traveller, on the same rocky plateau above<br/>
described (see p. 109). There is also <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>ancient Pyramid<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abooroash</span>, about five miles north of the Great Pyramid,<br/>
which, from its elevated site, affords a fine view of the<br/>
Ghizeh Pyramids. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aboos√©er</span>, between Ghizeh and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah</span>, there are four Pyramids, which do not, however, offer<br/>
any <span style="color: #0000FF;">special </span>attractions to invite a visit.<br/>
<br/>
In the vicinity of the Pyramids of Ghizeh are many<br/>
tombs belonging to the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memphian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis</span>. Some<br/>
of these are chambers excavated in the solid rock; others<br/>
are buildings erected on the surface, with deep pits leading<br/>
to the subterranean sepulchres in which the mummies were<br/>
deposited. The upper chamber, commonly called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mastabah</span>, is usually adorned with pictures of immense <span style="color: #0000FF;">historic<br/>
