<br/>
are remains of a temple, rich in hieroglyphics and sculptures<br/>
of the time of Augustus.<br/>
<br/>
Gerf <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hossayn </span>(W.) has a temple of the time of<br/>
Rameses, dedicated to the god Phtah.<br/>
<br/>
"We passed through some corn fields," says a traveller<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>"then came a strip of desert, then a tall cliff, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>it the<br/>
enormous propylon of the temple. This, though built by<br/>
human hands, stands out from the face of the mountain as if<br/>
it had formed part of it from creation; four giant statues<br/>
leaning against stone pillars support its massive entablature.<br/>
The vista of this colossal portico leads to a portal in the<br/>
living rock some twenty feet in height, and this is the<br/>
entrance to the temple. The coup <span style="color: #ff0000;">d'reil </span>as we entered was<br/>
very imposing. A group of swarthy Arabs were waving<br/>
blazing torches, and looked like officiating demon-priests to<br/>
the tall, awful, gigantic idols that towered above us; the<br/>
temple seemed full of these grim statues, though there are<br/>
only two rows, containing four in each. The massive<br/>
pedestals on which they stand are but ten feet apart, which<br/>
adds considerably to the effect of their enormous size.<br/>
Hence we passed into the lesser hall, and then into the<br/>
adytum. The numerous torches here gleamed upon walls<br/>
shadowily giving out pictured battles, and kneeling priests,<br/>
and stern deities; and in the centre of the'shrine was a rude<br/>
altar, beyond which sat four gigantic idols, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">strangelooking </span>crowns upon their heads, and mysterious emblems<br/>
in their hands.<br/>
<br/>
"There were many other chambers, and everywhere pillar<br/>
and entablature were thickly encrusted with reliefs."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kostamneh </span>(W.) At this place it is said that the Nile<br/>
can be forded in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mouth </span>of May.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Dakkeh </span>(W.) Here there isa temple in honour of Hermes<br/>
Trismegistus, built in the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus by<br/>
Ergamenes, king of Ethiopia. The pylons are perfect. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Some<br/>
