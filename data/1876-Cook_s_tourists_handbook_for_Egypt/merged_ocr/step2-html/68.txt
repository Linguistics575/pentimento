XXIX. and XXX. These were the last two dynasties of<br/>
Egyptian kings who were constantly struggling against Persian supremacy. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>native rule ended when <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nectanebo </span>II.<br/>
fled in 3.0. 340.<br/>
<br/>
The Persians in turn were conquered by the Macedonians. At the death of Alexander the Great, the Greek<br/>
dynasty of the Ptolemies was established in Egypt, and<br/>
maintained its sway for 300 years. Ptolemy Soter, Ptolemy<br/>
Philadelphus, and Ptolemy Euergetes raised the power of<br/>
Egypt to its highest pitch. Alexandria became celebrated<br/>
as a great seat of commerce, arts, and learning (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">6 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>).<br/>
Gradually a fresh decline set in, which had reached its lowest<br/>
ebb when Cleopatra used other means than the sword of<br/>
her ancestors to conquer the generals of mighty Rome. At<br/>
her death in 30 <span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span>. Egypt was reduced by Augustus to a<br/>
Roman Province.<br/>
<br/>
Egypt was governed by a Prefect as a Province of Rome<br/>
from the time of Augustus till the death of Theodosius in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">39 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>A.D., a period of <span style="color: #ff0000;">425 </span>years. The great event of this<br/>
period was the introduction of Christianity, and the subsequent peopling of the solitude of the Thebaid with devout<br/>
hermits. The new temples, and the old for a considerable<br/>
period, both attracted their votaries, and hieroglyphic inscriptions of as late a date as the third century are still found.<br/>
The total ruin of ancient Egyptian culture dates from the<br/>
overthrow of the Serapeum in 389 A.D. by Theodosius. Then<br/>
not only Egypt's old religion, but Egypt's hieroglyphic<br/>
lore, passed into oblivion, till again rescued in our own<br/>
times.<br/>
