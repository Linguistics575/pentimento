below <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground-appears </span>to have been assigned to each of the<br/>
twenty-seven departments of the kingdom. Each of these<br/>
chambers was roofed with a single stone slab. <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0 </span>material<br/>
but stone had been used throughout the structure. The<br/>
pillars were monoliths of red granite, and of a limestone so<br/>
white as to have been mistaken for Parian marble, and of so<br/>
compact a texture as to have received a good polish. The<br/>
sculptures of the courts and chambers were singularly bold<br/>
and good. Those of each court and the connected chambers<br/>
had reference to the history, the peculiarities, and the religion<br/>
of the department to which it had been assigned. Beside<br/>
the chambers were numerous halls, porticoes, and passages.<br/>
The area of the roof composed of the enormous slabs just<br/>
mentioned, may have formed the actual place of assembly for<br/>
the collected deputies of the departments. On the north<br/>
side stood the Pyramid in which was buried <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>,<br/>
who, if he had not originally designed the Labyrinth, had,<br/>
at all events, been <span style="color: #0000FF;">its'chief </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">constructor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>for his escutcheon<br/>
is frequently found in the existing remains. The Pyramid<br/>
was cased in the white limestone used in the Labyrinth itself."<br/>
<br/>
When Herodotus saw this edifice, it had been partially<br/>
restored by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dodecarehs</span>, after a decay of some twenty<br/>
centuries. It was once the grandest existing building in the<br/>
world, the glory of the old monarchy, and the province<br/>
which had been artificially created by the Bahr Yoosef,<br/>
as Egypt itself is naturally created by the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">eris </span>was a vast reservoir of dammed-up<br/>
waters, thirty miles in extent, which also awoke the astonishment of Herodotus. The site only is to be found. In this<br/>
lake dwelt the sacred crocodiles. It also abounded in fish,<br/>
from the pickling and salting of which a considerable<br/>
revenue was derived, and assigned as pin-money to the<br/>
Queens of Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
