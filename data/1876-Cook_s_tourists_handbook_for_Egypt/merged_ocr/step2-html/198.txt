<br/>
a fellow obelisk is no longer standing<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the one seen in <span style="color: #0000FF;">sin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>is the obelisk of the celebrated Queen-Regent <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasou</span>, who<br/>
played an important part in the history of the eighteenth<br/>
dynasty. From an inscription on the obelisk we learn that<br/>
it was surmounted by a small pyramid of pure gold, that the<br/>
whole column was gilded from top to bottom, and that the<br/>
time spent in erecting the column in this place, including<br/>
its transportation from the quarries of Assouan, was only<br/>
seven months.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond this court the ruined sanctuary, and various<br/>
other chambers, the columns of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osirtasen </span>I. (3064 <span style="color: #ff0000;">13.0</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>),<br/>
marking the oldest portion of the edifice, the columnar hall<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thothmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, the Hall of Ancestors, and some other<br/>
chambers, etc., can be visited.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">bas-reliefs </span>on the exterior wall of the Great Hall<br/>
demand notice.<br/>
<br/>
On the North Wall are the most valuable records of the<br/>
reign of Sethi in existence; they represent the wars of that<br/>
monarch against the Assyrians, Armenians of the desert,<br/>
etc. In one extraordinary symbolical scene the king, with<br/>
numerous arms, seizes his enemies by the hair and proceeds<br/>
to immolate them before the God of Thebes.<br/>
<br/>
On the South Wall, commencing near the gateway at the<br/>
western end, are sculptures commemorating the victories of<br/>
Shishak. On a projecting wall farther east is written in<br/>
hieroglyphics the famous poem of "Pen-ta-our," in which<br/>
the story of a feat of arms of Rameses II. in his wars against<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khetas </span>is handed down to posterity. Near this is a<br/>
copy of a treaty of peace concluded by the same great<br/>
monarch, also some battle pieces commemorating his victories.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it would be impossible to pretend really to<br/>
catalogue the curiosities and marvels of Karnak. All <span style="color: #0000FF;">that<br/>
