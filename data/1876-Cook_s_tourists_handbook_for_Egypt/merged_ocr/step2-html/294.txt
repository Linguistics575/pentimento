<span>EL <span style="color: #ff0000;">KHUZNEH </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">FARAON</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">273<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">consists </span>of six Corinthian columns; the upper is in three<br/>
parts, of which the centre is a circular colonnade. The<br/>
whole is surmounted by a pillared dome, crowned by an <span style="color: #0000FF;">urn<br/>
</span>believed by the natives to contain great treasures. The effect<br/>
of the edifice in that grand ravine, bursting on the traveller<br/>
as he emerges from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sik</span>, is very fine. The building can<br/>
be explored. A fine vestibule conducts to three insignificant,<br/>
plain rock chambers.<br/>
<br/>
Proceeding along the valley, sculptured temples, palaces,<br/>
and tombs are seen high up on each side. The colours are a<br/>
rude blending of brown, red, purple, and lighter shades.<br/>
<br/>
The valley, now turning to the right, leads on to the<br/>
Amphitheatre, with seats and aisles still existing, cut from<br/>
the solid rock. In this building, which stood in the midst<br/>
of magnificent <span style="color: #0000FF;">facades</span>, and temples, and palaces, chiefly of<br/>
Roman origin, four thousand persons could be seated. From<br/>
the uppermost steps of the theatre, the visitor can see into<br/>
another deep valley<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>Descending from the Theatre, and continuing the course<br/>
along the valley, innumerable remains of fine buildings are<br/>
seen. The hill-sides are everywhere honeycombed with<br/>
deep chambers. Fragments of ruined bridges, and heaps of<br/>
broken columns and cut stones fill the open spaces. The<br/>
first impression with some travellers is that there would not<br/>
have been enough open <span style="color: #0000FF;">space </span>for a city, and that the tombs<br/>
must have been largely utilized as dwellings; but on<br/>
examining more closely the area of open space, it is seen<br/>
that, considering the narrowness of the streets, and the height<br/>
and closeness of the houses in ancient cities, there might<br/>
have been ample space for a great city. The ground was<br/>
rigidly economized, as is shown by the broken terraces rising<br/>
one above another. But of those buildings erected <span style="color: #0000FF;">where<br/>
</span>the busy people traded, or the luxurious merchants <span style="color: #ff0000;">lived<br/>
