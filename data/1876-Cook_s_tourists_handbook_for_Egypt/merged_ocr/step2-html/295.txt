<br/>
in voluptuousness, none remain; all lie in a promiscuous<br/>
heap of ruins. There are one or two public edifices <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>preserved to show what they were. The Triumphal<br/>
Arch, the abutments of which stand in the heart of the<br/>
place. Not far from it the so-called Palace of Pharaoh,<br/>
about one hundred feet square, with broken columns in front,<br/>
and having in the interior a vestibule and one principal<br/>
chamber, with an elevation for a throne. Some good<br/>
sculpture, and fragments of stucco work, can be seen on the<br/>
cornices, and about the walls. To the south of this stands<br/>
a lone pillar, and beyond this pillar, on the crown of a conical<br/>
hill, is what is <span style="color: #0000FF;">supposed </span>to have been the <span style="color: #ff0000;">AcrOpolis</span>. Still<br/>
beyond are the remains of an old rock fortress, which commanded the pass from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Windy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghurundel</span>.<br/>
<br/>
El Deir, which is considered the grandest monument<br/>
of the old city, is approached by climbing up a steep ravine.<br/>
It <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>very conspicuous structure cut in the cliff facing Mount<br/>
Hor. It measures <span style="color: #ff0000;">150 </span>ft. in height and the same in breadth.<br/>
The facade is of two stories, with Corinthian columns.<br/>
The urn, which once surmounted a pillared dome, has<br/>
broken through the frontal of the upper story. The capitals<br/>
are rude blocks in an unfinished condition. Inside is a<br/>
large room, forty-five feet square, with a raised altar niche,<br/>
and a cross on the wall. The edifice was no doubt utilized<br/>
as a Christian church at a later period, whence its present<br/>
name. On the rocks opposite El Deir are traces of a very<br/>
large temple, about a thousand feet above the valley<br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
Petra, anciently Sela or Selah, is alluded to as "the<br/>
rock," in Judges i. 36, 2 Chronicles xxv. 12, and Obadiah iii.<br/>
In <span style="color: #0000FF;">B </span>Kings xiv. 7 it is called Selah; also in Isaiah xvi. I.<br/>
The original inhabitants of the city were Horites--<span style="color: #0000FF;">cai<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dwellers</span>. The Edomites were also so called, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole<br/>
