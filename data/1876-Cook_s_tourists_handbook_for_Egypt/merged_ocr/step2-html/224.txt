MacCallum in February, 1874, and cleared at his own expense. It was filled with sand which had drifted in from the<br/>
top, and which poured out in a stream when the door was<br/>
burst open. There is a basement of a pylon, crude brick,<br/>
and a very curious staircase, the bottom of which is paved<br/>
with cone-shaped lumps of earth. On the top of the staircase he discovered an earthenware vase and a skeleton, both<br/>
modern or mediaeval<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the courtyard of crude brick, round<br/>
the door of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">specs </span>is very interesting. The chamber is<br/>
about <span style="color: #0000FF;">14 </span>feet by 20 feet, and 12 feet high (these measurements are from memory). The Temple is situated on the<br/>
rocks on the left of the Great Temple when facing it.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>At Aboo Simbel all tourist interest ceases, the remainder<br/>
of the journey being decidedly tame. A strong wind is<br/>
always blowing <span style="color: #0000FF;">here-the </span>coolest on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-notwithstanding </span>its tropical situation.<br/>
<br/>
Opposite Aboo Simbel, at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Feréyg</span>, is a small temple<br/>
with Egyptian sculptures, also containing pictures dating<br/>
from the times when it was used as a Christian church.<br/>
The Saviour and the Virgin are seen in glowing colours in<br/>
curious juxtaposition to the memorials of idol worship.<br/>
<br/>
Passing the "Hill of the Sun "on the east, with some<br/>
ancient remains of grotto, tomb, tablets, etc., and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Farms </span>(W.),<br/>
with blocks and columns probably of Roman origin, and the<br/>
well-preserved Castle of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Addeh</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy-Halfa</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">210 </span>miles<br/>
from Assouan, is soon reached.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Niriitiy-Halfa </span>is so called from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">haffa </span>or coarse<br/>
grass which springs up outside the irrigated portions of land.<br/>
The town is somewhat picturesque. "The huts of the inhabitants are scattered at intervals, now in clusters, now<br/>
singly, beneath the deep shadow of quite a forest of <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>palm trees<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>most of these huts are enclosed within<br/>
mud walls, and they stand at the distance of some hundreds<br/>
of yards from the water's edge, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>when the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
