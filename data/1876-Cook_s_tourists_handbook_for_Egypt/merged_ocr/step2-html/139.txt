<span>I 22 EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive </span>and the ladies of his harem, down to the<br/>
equivalent of a costermonger's cart; and every style of<br/>
person, from the ministers of state to the poorest fellah;<br/>
and every description of "mount," from the pure blood Arab<br/>
to the most jaded of sore-backed <span style="color: #ff0000;">donkeys</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and every variety<br/>
of costume, from the costly embroideries of Damascus to<br/>
the simplest calico fold around the waist, are to be seen<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
The palace of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoobra </span>has nothing particular to distinguish<br/>
it from other Oriental palaces, but the gardens are very pretty<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>orange, lemon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">citron</span>, and pepper trees abound, and among<br/>
the flowers the <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours </span>are intoxicating and the colours<br/>
dazzling. But the chief attraction is the Summer Palace,<br/>
having in the centre a large open basin, quite a miniature<br/>
lake, surrounded by a covered corridor of Carrara marble<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">la<br/>
</span>the midst of the lake is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>marble island, supported on the<br/>
backs of crocodiles. Everywhere there are elegant lounges<br/>
spread abroad, and everywhere fountains are sending forth<br/>
their plashing waters. Coming from the glare and heat of<br/>
the sun into the midst of this paradise of waters is like<br/>
realizing a fairy tale. In the four corners of the corridors<br/>
are divans elegantly fitted up with costly furniture and<br/>
massive curtains and hangings, the Turkish and European<br/>
styles being blended with considerable effect. The drawingroom is gold and white satin; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">1adielroom </span>green satin<br/>
and velvet; the billiard-room is a study on account of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">elegance </span>of its details, every cue being of wood inlaid with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>costly materials, and of a curious device.<br/>
<br/>
HELIOPOLIS.<br/>
<br/>
From Cairo to the site of Heliopolis is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">five-miles</span>' drive,<br/>
for the most part shaded by plane trees and sycamores, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
