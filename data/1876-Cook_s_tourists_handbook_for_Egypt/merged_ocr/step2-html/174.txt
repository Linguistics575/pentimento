</span>out this edifice seems to be that of serpents; these appear<br/>
in every variety of form and attitude, some are walking on<br/>
human legs, and some <span style="color: #0000FF;">spinning </span>erect upon their tails like<br/>
corkscrews, while they present strange offerings to deities<br/>
equally preposterous."<br/>

The great hall, or portico, with its twenty-four columns<br/>
is first entered. The two side entrances are for priests and<br/>
attendants. The main entrance was used by the king<br/>
alone, at this portal the monarch presented himself, in long<br/>
robe, sceptre in hand, and with sandalled feet; on entering<br/>
he is recognized by the gods as King of High and Low<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt-first </span>receiving purification from Thoth and Horus,<br/>
and then the two crowns from Wat'i and Suvan. Then<br/>
Maut of Thebes and Toom of Heliopolis take the king by<br/>
the hand and lead him into the presence of the goddess<br/>
Athor. Such is the story as shown in the surrounding<br/>
pictures, symbolising the preparatory ceremonies performed<br/>
by the king in this great hall before passing into the temple<br/>
proper. The ceiling has a representation of the zodiac,<br/>
once imagined to be ancient Egyptian, but now proved to<br/>
date from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>times.<br/>

The learned author of the Itin√©raire gives details of the<br/>
uses of the numerous chambers of the temple. To one group<br/>
of rooms he assigns the assembling of the priests and preparation for the festivals; these latter, of which a sort of<br/>
calendar is given on the walls of the second hall, consisted<br/>
chiefly of grand processions which circulated through the<br/>
temple, mounted to the terraces, and redescended to perform<br/>
certain rites in the exterior enclosure. In this group also<br/>
were chambers for the preparation or consecration of the<br/>
offerings, the guardianship of the sacred emblems, and the<br/>
preparation of the sacred oils and essences, also the treasury<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">depth </span>for vestments<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
