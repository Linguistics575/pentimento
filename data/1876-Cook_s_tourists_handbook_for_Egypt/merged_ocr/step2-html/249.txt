<span>228 THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
Ruins in every direction tell of the ancient importance of<br/>
this place. It was a frontier city of Egypt on entering the<br/>
field of Zoan. Its name was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mésés</span>, and it was celebrated<br/>
as the birthplace of Orus, the oldest Egyptian deity, typical,<br/>
like the Greek Apollo, of the Sun. This place must have<br/>
been one of the most ancient in the world. It was the spot<br/>
at which the Asian tribes must have entered to people<br/>
Egypt. Ten miles west of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kantarah </span>are some mounds<br/>
marking the site of Daphne, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tahpannes </span>of the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
Lake Menzaleh (p. 240) is next crossed, affording<br/>
an almost limitless view of lake and morass, and numerous<br/>
islets. Water-fowls abound in vast <span style="color: #0000FF;">variety-geese</span>, ducks,<br/>
and herons, and also pelicans and flamingoes, are innumerable.<br/>
<br/>
Crossing the Pelusiac branch of the Nile at Kil, and<br/>
passing Ras-el-Ech (on an island), the islands of Termes<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Toonah</span>, with a few ruins to the left, and in sight of the<br/>
remains of ancient Pelusium to the right, a low bank of<br/>
yellow sand is crossed, and the terminus of the Canal reached<br/>
in the harbour of Port Said.<br/>
<br/>
The banks of the Canal (as it crosses Lake Menzaleh)<br/>
are formed of the dredgings of sand and clay brought up<br/>
from the bottom. At the Port, these dredgings, mixed with<br/>
lime, have been hardened into the stone piers forming the<br/>
arms of the harbour. The banks formed of this material,<br/>
and stretching for many miles beside the Canal, are firm and<br/>
regular throughout the line.<br/>
