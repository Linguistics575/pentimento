<span>THEBES. <span style="color: #ff0000;">163<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Thebans had borne for two centuries and a half, under<br/>
their Greek masters, political servitude, heavy taxes, habitual<br/>
annoyance, and occasional cruelty. Under the government<br/>
of Cleopatra <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cocce </span>the measure of their injuries overflowed,<br/>
and taking advantage of the revolutions in Alexandria, a<br/>
large part of Upper Egypt rose in rebellion. When Lathyrus<br/>
returned to Egypt, Thebes refused obedience. For three<br/>
years the brave Copts, intrenched within their temples,<br/>
everyone of which was a castle, withstood his armies; but<br/>
the bows, the hatchets, and the chariots could do little<br/>
against Greek arms; while the overthrow of the massive<br/>
temple walls and the utter ruin of the city prove how slowly<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yielded </span>to greater skill and numbers, and mark the conquerors' distrust lest the temples should again be so made use<br/>
of... The wide acres of Theban ruin prove alike the<br/>
greatness of the city, and the force with which it was overthrown; and this is the last time that Egyptian Thebes is<br/>
met with in the pages of history. The habitations of the<br/>
city were swept away, but the temples, miles apart, form the<br/>
nuclei of different scattered hamlets, whose inhabitants till<br/>
the plain, once covered with the living millions of the ancient<br/>
city. The Christians, under the Greek Emperors, raised<br/>
their puny structures amidst the colossal courts of <span style="color: #ff0000;">MedeenetHaboo</span>, * but fled on the conquest by the Arabs, whose<br/>
degenerate successors make their habitations amongst the<br/>
tombs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gorna</span>, and gain a precarious subsistence by<br/>
rifling their contents, and dragging from their repositories<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span>mummied remains of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">tenants</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>"But the ruined temples still stand to call forth the<br/>
wonder of the traveller. They have seen the whole portion<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The Hon. R. Curzon, in his Monasteries of the Levant, gives <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
<br/>
</span>curious account of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>night visit to a tomb to inspect the <span style="color: #ff0000;">M53</span>. once<br/>
belonging to the Theban monastery<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
