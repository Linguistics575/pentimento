OLD CAIRO.<br/>
<br/>
Old Cairo represents the city of the victorious Amer<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>built in 638 A.D., and then called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fost√©t </span>(see p. 86). It<br/>
was superseded by the new Fatimite city built by Gowher in<br/>
974 A.D. In 1168 A.D., in order to prevent the Christians<br/>
from becoming masters of Old Cairo, it was burnt by the<br/>
Saracens, and ever since mounds of rubbish have covered<br/>
the greater part of the site of the ancient city.<br/>
<br/>
There are still some objects of great interest in Old Cairo.<br/>
Amongst these the Mosque of Amer, or Amrou, is preeminent. It was founded by the General whose name it bears<br/>
in 642, and is modelled after the Kaaba at Mecca. The visitor<br/>
enters by an immense oblong court, the east end of which<br/>
is a gallery with rows of columns, enclosing the sanctuary<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A<br/>
</span>with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">maubar</span>, or chair of the preacher; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">khateb</span>, or<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
