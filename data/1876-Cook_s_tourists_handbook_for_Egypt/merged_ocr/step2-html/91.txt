ALEXANDRIA TO CAIRO.<br/>
I. By Road.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller can proceed to Cairo either by road, by<br/>
water, or by rail; the latter being of course the principal<br/>
. tourist route.<br/>
<br/>
By Road (<span style="color: #0000FF;">110 </span>miles) the course is in proximity to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahmoodeah </span>Canal to Damanhoor, and thence across the<br/>
plain to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zowyet-el-Bahr</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zowyet-eLBahr </span>the traveller<br/>
may cross the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, and continue by way of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menoof </span>to<br/>
Cairo, or follow the western bank of the Nile to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Emb√©beh</span>,<br/>
and then cross the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Boulak </span>and Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Embabeh </span>is the site of the Battle of the Pyramids.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">II</span>. By Water.<br/>
<br/>
BY Water the route is by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahmoodeah </span>Canal to<br/>
Atfeh, and thence up the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>to Cairo, a journey of nearly<br/>
170 miles<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_</span>.<br/>
<br/>
This route offers few attractions<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>it is followed by those<br/>
who hire a dahabeah at Alexandria, and there commence the<br/>
water journey to the Cataracts. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahmoodeah </span>Canal (see<br/>
p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">71</span>) is 42 miles in length and about 20 ft. broad. The suburban villas of Alexandria are soon left behind, and then there<br/>
is a dreary journey past Birket and other inconsiderable places<br/>
to Atfeh, on the Rosetta branch of the Nile. To this<br/>
wretched village sportsmen often repair during the season for<br/>
the snipe shooting in the neighbourhood.<br/>
<br/>
From Atfeh the up-river course to Cairo passes <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fouah</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
