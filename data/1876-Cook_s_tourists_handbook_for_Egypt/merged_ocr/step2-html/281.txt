boxes of bones from distant places, being the remains'of<br/>
persons who have desired the privilege of resting at Mount<br/>
Sinai. Amongst them is the skeleton of St. Stephanos, in a<br/>
gaudy dress.<br/>
<br/>
The Convent Gardens are extensive, and abound with<br/>
orange, lemon, almond, apricot, and many other fruit-trees.<br/>
The shops where the monks manufacture oil from the olives,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">attack </span>from the dates, <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>interest some visitors.<br/>
<br/>
The Library will form to many the chief interest of<br/>
the convent. The story of Tischendorf's discovery of a<br/>
complete MS. copy of the Bible in this library is well known.<br/>
It was with much difficulty that he got access to it. The<br/>
Emperor of Russia, at Tischendorf's instigation, demanded<br/>
it of the monks, and they reluctantly gave it up, and were<br/>
pacified by the presentation of a new casket for the bones of<br/>
St. Catherine, and a fac-simile copy of the precious MS.<br/>
The MS. is now at St. Petersburg, and is known throughout<br/>
the learned world as the "Codex Sinaiticus." Two very rare<br/>
books are shown in the Archbishop's Room. One is a<br/>
superbly-executed <span style="color: #0000FF;">copy </span>of the four <span style="color: #ff0000;">GOSpels</span>, called the<br/>
"Codex Aureus." It is elegantly written in Greek, preceded by pen pictures in gold of the Twelve Apostles, dating<br/>
as far back as the fifth century, and transcribed by Theodorus. There is also a copy of the Psalms, in Greek, written on six leaves, each measuring <span style="color: #0000FF;">5</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>by 3% inches. It is<br/>
said to be the work of St. Thecla<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>and the writing is so small<br/>
that it can only be read with a magnifying-glass. In the<br/>
Library are a number of Greek printed books, Arabic MSS.,<br/>
etc. There is also an admirably-executed MS. of the Acts<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Apostles..<br/>

mountain towering in immense majesty on an immense plain<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
