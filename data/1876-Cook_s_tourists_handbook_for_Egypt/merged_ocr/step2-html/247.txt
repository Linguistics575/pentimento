<span>226 THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Now </span>there are good stone houses, macadamized roads, and<br/>
beautiful-flower gardens in full growth.<br/>
<br/>
The foundation of Ismailia dates from 1862, it has now<br/>
5000 inhabitants divided amongst the French, Greek, and<br/>
Arab Quarters. The harbour was a grand sight when<br/>
all nations met at the inauguration of the Canal. The<br/>
waterworks connected with the Fresh-Water Canal, with<br/>
pumping engines, cascades, reservoirs, etc., are very interesting. The town contains a fair hotel, a French bazaar, a<br/>
promenade, a villa of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>, good sea-bathing accommodation, etc. The heights of El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Guisr </span>are worth visiting<br/>
for the view, if the opportunity occurs. A botanist, sportsman, or Egyptologist would find this place an enjoyable<br/>
stopping place for a short time. Pelusium, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoé</span>, Pithom,<br/>
Rameses, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heroopolis</span>, are (whatever is left of them)<br/>
within easy distance. "Persians, Greeks, and Romans<br/>
alike left their marks on this district. Here, too, was the<br/>
Goshen of the land of Israel. It would be interesting also<br/>
to ascertain how far, into what is now desert, reached the<br/>
land that was then cultivated."<br/>
<br/>
The author of The Rob Roy on the Nile, says, "Ismailia<br/>
is like a hothouse without the glass, and all the life in it is<br/>
exotic. The sun's heat and the N ile's cool water force the<br/>
arid sand into a tropical verdure. Embosomed in this are<br/>
French <span style="color: #0000FF;">cafés </span>and billards, with Arab huts and camels; the<br/>
signboards on booths in Greek, Turkish, Spanish, and<br/>
American; <span style="color: #0000FF;">ate'lz'ers </span>resounding with hammer and <span style="color: #0000FF;">cogwheel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3<br/>
</span>and tents full of half-dressed savages chaffering uproariously<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>and boulevards thronged by the second rate fashion of a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>town, planted, and growing fast too, in the veritable<br/>
desert. Beside it lie the shores of the Lake Timsah, the<br/>
'Crocodile Lake,' which had a few pools when the Canal<br/>
was begun, but now is filled with brackish water<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
