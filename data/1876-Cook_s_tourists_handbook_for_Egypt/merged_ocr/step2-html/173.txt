<span>154 THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
Keneh (395 miles from Cairo) is an important place<br/>
on the east bank of the Nile; ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Caenopolis </span>occupied<br/>
the site. It has long been noted for its dates and its dancing girls, also for its manufacture of porous jugs and filtering bottles. It is interesting to watch the process of making<br/>
these articles by hand with extreme rapidity.<br/>
<br/>
There is a three days' desert route from Keneh to Kosseir<br/>
on the shore of the Red Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly opposite Keneh, on the west bank of the Nile,<br/>
stands the celebrated Temple <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>Denderah.<br/>
<br/>
This beautiful, well-preserved ruin dates from the period<br/>
when Egyptian architecture under the Ptolemies and Caesars<br/>
had greatly declined from its ancient grandeur, and shows a<br/>
considerable admixture of Greek and Roman with Egyptian<br/>
ideas. Like all the Egyptian temples, it stands in the<br/>
midst of a vast enclosure formed of crude bricks, and completely shutting out the sights and sounds of the outer<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
This temple was commenced under Ptolemy XII., its<br/>
construction was completed under Tiberius, and its decoration under <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ero</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>so that this edifice was being constructed<br/>
whilst our Saviour was dwelling at Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
The immense profusion of inscriptions, bas-reliefs, etc.,<br/>
with which the walls are covered, will forcibly strike the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">attention-ceilings</span>, walls, portals, basements are all ornamented in this way. In many of these pictures the subject<br/>
is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same-the </span>royal founder adoring the divinities of the<br/>
temple--others show the ceremonies observed by the king<br/>
in connection with this adoration. "Nothing can be more<br/>
rich," says Warburton, "than the carvings and hieroglyphics<br/>
that adorn the massive pillars crowned with <span style="color: #0000FF;">heads </span>of Isis.<br/>
The ceilings are covered with the celebrated astronomical<br/>
paintings<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and the next most popular representation <span style="color: #0000FF;">through<br/>
