<span>LAKE MENZALEH. 24 I<br/>
<br/>
branch of the Nile<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>on the south it receives many branches<br/>
from the same river, such as the Canals of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Achmour</span>, of<br/>
Moez, etc., and the Pelusian branch of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>. The<br/>
adjacent villages of <span style="color: #ff0000;">reed-huts</span>, many of which are built on<br/>
small islands, contain a population of about 15,000, who live<br/>
very miserably on the products of the fisheries, to which they<br/>
exclusively devote <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves </span>The lake is famous for its<br/>
innumerable aquatic birds. It is very shallow, and fed<br/>
principally by the Nile, during the inundations of which<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">i </span>the great Pelusian plain, to the east of the Maritime Canal<br/>
becomes completely flooded. The broad shining expanse of<br/>
Lake Menzaleh, dotted here and there with the sails of<br/>
Egyptian vessels, is in some places covered with flocks of<br/>
pelicans, storks, and other wading birds, who thrive and<br/>
fatten on the immense quantities of fish contained in the lake.<br/>
"Four miles of a winding course brought me gradually<br/>
down to the west limb of the lake," says the author of The<br/>
Rob Roy on the Nile, "where a very fresh <span style="color: #0000FF;">breeze </span>was blowing, and quite a new scene awaited my arrival. We had been<br/>
told of the enormous flocks of wild-fowls to be seen on this<br/>
lake, and especially in winter. I had seen <span style="color: #0000FF;">thousands-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">myriads </span>of these, and wondered at the multitude in the air.<br/>
But I never expected to see birds so numerous, and so close<br/>
together that their compact mass formed living islands<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>the water, and when the wind now took me swiftly to<br/>
these, and a whole island rose <span style="color: #0000FF;">up </span>with a loud and thrilling<br/>
din, to become a feathered cloud in the air, the impression<br/>
was one of vastness and innumerable teeming life, which it<br/>
is entirely impossible to convey in words. The larger<br/>
pelicans, and geese, and swans floated like ships at anchor.<br/>
The long-legged flamingoes, and other waders, traced out the<br/>
shape of the shallows by their standing in the water. Small<br/>
ducks were scattered in regiments of skirmishers about the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">16<br/>
