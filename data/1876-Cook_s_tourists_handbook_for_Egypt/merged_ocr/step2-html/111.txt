THE MOSQUES.'<br/>
<br/>
The Mosques of Cairo are in number between <span style="color: #0000FF;">400 </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">500</span>. Many of them are in a very ruinous condition<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>There<br/>
is no difficulty about admission to the most celebrated, on<br/>
payment of a small fee.<br/>
<br/>
For information as to the general arrangements of<br/>
Mosques, their officials, services, etc., see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">44 </span>in the<br/>
Introduction.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest Mosque in Cairo is that of T <span style="color: #ff0000;">ooloon</span>. It was<br/>
built by Ahmed Ebn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Touloun</span>, a century before Gowher<br/>
built Cairo (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>), and stood outside the city till Saladin<br/>
included it within his walls. It took three years in building,<br/>
at a cost of <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">72,000</span>. It is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">copy </span>of the Kaaba at Mecca,<br/>
and a true type of the earliest Mosques. At one time there<br/>
was a College in this building, with nine Professors.<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Ihe<br/>
</span>Mosque stands on a hill, which Muslim tradition asserts is<br/>
the hill on which the ark rested after the flood, and subsequently the spot where Abraham was about to offer Ishmael<br/>
(not Isaac) when a ram was sent to be offered instead.<br/>
<br/>
M. Aug. de <span style="color: #0000FF;">Couffon </span>de <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kerdellech</span>, in the Revue Contemporaine, says of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mosque </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span>--" One only arrives at it<br/>
after innumerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">de'tours</span>. At length, however, the guide<br/>
stops before a great gateway, whose miserable aspect well<br/>
harmonizes with the neighbourhood. The door is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Opened</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
