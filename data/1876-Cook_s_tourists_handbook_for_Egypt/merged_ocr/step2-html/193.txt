<br/>
</span>To sum up this brief description of the palace-temple of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-Haboo</span>, the whole edifice was evidently designed<br/>
as a lasting monument of the life and achievements of<br/>
Rameses III. It is his autobiography in stone. All available genius and skill were enlisted for the perpetuation of one<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">idea-and </span>that idea was Rameses <span style="color: #ff0000;">III</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>In the vicinity of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-Haboo</span>, are a small Ptolemaic<br/>
temple, the site of the lake called Birket Aboo, and a small<br/>
Roman temple with the names of Adrian and Antoninus<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pius</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dayr-el-Medeeneh</span>, so called from its having<br/>
been utilized by the early Christians, is a small temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">built<br/>
