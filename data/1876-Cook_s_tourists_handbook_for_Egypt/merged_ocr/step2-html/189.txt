ceased after it had been roughly repaired by rebuilding the<br/>
upper portion with sandstone, as seen to this day. Some<br/>
philosophers assign these sounds to expansion of fissured<br/>
portions under the influence of the sun's rays. Others say<br/>
that a priest hid himself in the interior and struck the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bellsounding </span>stone still existing in the lap of the statue. In<br/>
his Nile Notes of a Howadji, Curtis thus refers to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">legend </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p</span>"Looking into the morning mists of history and poetry,<br/>
we find that Homer mentions Memnon as a son of Aurora<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tithe</span>, King of Ethiopia, and brother of Priam, the most<br/>
beautiful of warriors, who hastened with myriads of men to<br/>
assist uncle Priam against the Greeks. Achilles slew Memnon under the walls of Troy, and the morning after his<br/>
death, as Aurora put aside the darkness and looked vaguely<br/>
and wan along the world, the first level look that touched<br/>
the lips of the hitherto silent statue on the plain, evoked<br/>
mysterious music. There were birds too, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memnonides</span>, who<br/>
arose from out the funeral pyre of Memnon, and as he<br/>
burned, fought fiercely in the air, so that more than half<br/>
fell offerings to his manes. Every year they return to renew<br/>
the combat, and every year with low wailings they dip their<br/>
wings in the river water and carefully cleanse the statue.<br/>
Dew-diamonded cobwebs, fascinating fable, <span style="color: #0000FF;">O</span>! history! "<br/>
<br/>
The mysterious music was heard, or heard of, by poets,<br/>
historians, and emperors. Strabo says he heard it, but the<br/>
statue was then broken, and the historian was doubtful as to<br/>
whether the sound came from the statue or from some one<br/>
in the crowd. This is the first mention of the phenomenon.<br/>
For two hundred years the music was heard by many.<br/>
Hadrian heard it. Severus repaired the statue and the<br/>
mysterious melody ceased.<br/>
