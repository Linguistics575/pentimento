<span>166 THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
an immense amount of disgraceful mutilation has been<br/>
effected, and an irreparable wrong done to science.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the visitor steps into this tomb he finds<br/>
himself, as it were, in a new world; no longer does he<br/>
behold the scenes of domestic and rural life, so pleasingly<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">pourtrayed </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beni-hassan</span>; all is fantastic and<br/>
chimerical; the gods are present in strange forms, long<br/>
serpents glide here and there, the judgment of the soul and<br/>
its admission to happiness are pictured forth, and inscriptions run along the walls which are hymns to the divinity<br/>
supposed to be uttered by the spirit of the dead.<br/>
<br/>
A beautiful alabaster sarcophagus was found by Belzoni<br/>
in this tomb; it is now in Sir John Soane's museum in<br/>
London.<br/>
<br/>
The visitor to this tomb descends by a staircase to a<br/>
passage, then by a second staircase to an oblong chamber<br/>
twelve feet by fourteen, where Belzoni found a deep pit<br/>
apparently placed to mislead <span style="color: #0000FF;">explorers-this </span>pit has been<br/>
filled up. Breaking through the walls of this chamber where<br/>
the pit was discovered, a hall was reached about <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five<br/>
</span>feet square, with its walls and four supporting columns<br/>
covered with beautiful sculptures. Through a second hall,<br/>
two more passages, and a small chamber, the grand hall,<br/>
twenty-seven feet square and supported by six columns, is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">reached </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>beyond this is a vaulted chamber from which the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus</span>, above alluded to, was taken. There is an<br/>
enclosed passage extending <span style="color: #ff0000;">150 </span>feet further into the solid<br/>
rock, on arriving at the end of which the visitor is <span style="color: #ff0000;">470 </span>feet<br/>
from the entrance horizontally, and 180 feet lower perpendicularly.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb of Rameses III. (No. II) commonly<br/>
called Bruce's Tomb, is much inferior in its artistic work to<br/>
that of Sethi<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
