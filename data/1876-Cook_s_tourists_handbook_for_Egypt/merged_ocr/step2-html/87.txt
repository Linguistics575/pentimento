PRINCIPAL SIGHTS.<br/>
<br/>
Pompey's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pillar-The </span>name of this celebrated<br/>
column is "really a misnomer," as intimated in Horace<br/>
Smith's well known "Address to the Mummy." It stands<br/>
on a high piece of ground, probably the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Joftiest </span>site in the<br/>
ancient city. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>elegant shaft is of polished red granite,<br/>
the capital and pedestal are of inferior workmanship. The<br/>
total height is nearly 100 feet. The shaft is considered to<br/>
have formed part of an ancient temple, utilized in the erection of the present column in honour of Diocletian, after<br/>
his eight months' siege of Alexandria in 296 A.D., and sanguinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">suppression </span>of the rebellion of Achilleus. A statue<br/>
once adorned the summit.<br/>
<br/>
The Mahomedan Cemetery is very near Pompey's Pillar. It is a wilderness of stones, without fence or<br/>
rail, or anything of the sort, to seclude it from the common<br/>
roadway. Many of the stones have a turban roughly carved<br/>
on the top; some are painted green, showing that the deceased in his day made the pilgrimage to Mecca, or was a<br/>
descendant of the Prophet. "A group of women,"'says<br/>
one visitor to this spot, "were sitting round an <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>grave,<br/>
rocking themselves to and fro, and wailing for the dead.<br/>
We had no need to draw near to hear the lamentations they<br/>
made, for the low mournful dirge with which they began<br/>
soon increased to a loud howl, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>this continued nearly all<br/>
the time we remained in the neighbourhood; but it scarcely<br/>
impressed us with solemnity, certainly not with any desire to<br/>
shed sympathetic tears<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>for as these women are paid so<br/>
much for the job, and are constantly at it, it was a dead<br/>
certainty that they felt but little the ceremony in which they<br/>
were engaged." There is a characteristic filthy Egyptian<br/>
village overlooking the cemetery<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
