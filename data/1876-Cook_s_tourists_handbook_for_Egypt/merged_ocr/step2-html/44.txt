<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ITINERARY </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">TO </span>SECOND CATARACT. 27<br/>
<br/>
over a steep path full of volcanic remains. The journey will<br/>
repay the fatigue, the view from that spot being splendid, commanding on one side the Nile Valley, and on the other the<br/>
desert road winding its course amid rocky hills, and close to<br/>
the village and the road itself numberless caravans lying at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rest</span>, or preparing for departure.<br/>
<br/>
FIFTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Stop at A'mada, about 8 miles from Korosko, and there visit<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>very interesting little temple<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>Then proceed to Derr, only 5 miles further, a large town,<br/>
the capital of lower Nubia. It is famous for its dates. Here<br/>
the steamer remains four hours, thus affording ample <span style="color: #0000FF;">opportunity </span>for a walk through the straggling streets of the town,<br/>
which, like all other towns and villages in Nubia, consists of<br/>
mud <span style="color: #ff0000;">hutS </span>hatched with reed and palm leaves. It contains <span style="color: #0000FF;">also<br/>
</span>a temple which may be visited, although it is not in a good state<br/>
of preservation.<br/>
<br/>
The same day the boat travels on to Ibrim, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ibreem</span>, I <span style="color: #0000FF;">f<br/>
</span>miles from Derr. In addition to two small temples or tombs,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cut </span>out in the rock, there is a castle built by the Romans, whence<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fine view is to be had of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>and the surrounding hills.<br/>
<br/>
SIXTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Arrive at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ipsambool</span>, or Aboo-Simbel (32 miles). The monuments here are the greatest attractions Nubia has to offer to the<br/>
antiquarian student. They are hewn out of the solid rock, and are<br/>
rendered specially imposing by four gigantic figures of Rameses<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">II </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>each 66 feet high. The temple is partly choked with sand,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>somewhat difficult of access, but the interior well repays the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">exertion</span>. It is divided into <span style="color: #0000FF;">four</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">compartments</span>, and is 185 feet<br/>
deep. The paintings and sculptures exceed in beauty and<br/>
grandeur any which the tourist has hitherto seen on the Nile.<br/>
The smaller temple, 84 feet in depth, is dedicated to Athor;<br/>
the facade is ornamented with six colossal statues of Rameses,<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">wife </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>children. Another temple has recently been discovered here (p. 203). A whole day is devoted to the examination of these temples<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
