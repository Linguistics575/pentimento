funereal character of this monumental pile;'for these<br/>
statues are those of the king himself, with the attributes<br/>
of Osiris. On the other side of the court are eight<br/>
elegant columns, with papyrus capitals. After examining<br/>
from this point of view the various tableaux on the surrounding walls, commemorating the warlike achievements<br/>
of the king, the visitor passes through the granite portals of<br/>
the second pylon, which is surrounded by a row of apes,<br/>
emblems of Thoth, into the finest inner court found in any<br/>
of the Egyptian temples.<br/>
<br/>
This splendid area measures 123 ft. by I 33 ft., and its<br/>
height to the cornice is nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">40 </span>ft. Corridors covered<br/>
with sculptures brilliantly coloured surround the four sides,<br/>
in front of which is an inner peristyle, supported on the<br/>
north and south by Osiride pillars, and on the east and west<br/>
by massive columns with capitals representing the flower<br/>
of the lotus closed. In the centre of the court are remains<br/>
of columns once forming part of the Christian cathedral<br/>
erected here when <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-Haboo </span>was a Coptic settlement.<br/>
<br/>
The tableaux covering the corridors of this court are of<br/>
great interest. The lower register chiefly consists of battle<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">scenes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-the </span>upper register are chiefly a series of representations of the ceremonies attendant on the dedication<br/>
of this palace-temple of Rameses.<br/>
<br/>
The western portion of the building was till recently<br/>
completely buried in Coptic ruins. Considerable labour<br/>
has been expended, with but little result beyond the<br/>
discovery of broken columns, empty chambers, religious<br/>
inscriptions, of no <span style="color: #0000FF;">special </span>interest, and about a thousand<br/>
mutilated statuettes of Osiris.<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving the glorious pile of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet- </span>Haboo, there<br/>
remains to notice the remarkable series of historical tableaux<br/>
on the exterior north wall of the temple. These are ten <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
