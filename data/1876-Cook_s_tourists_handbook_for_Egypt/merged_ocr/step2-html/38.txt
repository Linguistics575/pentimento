<span>ITINERARY TO FIRST CATARACT. 21<br/>
<br/>
two hours more and the ruins of Kom-Ombo are reached, where<br/>
the steamer stops for the night.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">FOURTEENTH </span>DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Assouan, the limit of Upper Egypt and an important town,<br/>
is reached early in the morning. As soon as the steamer stops, a<br/>
swarm of N ubians come to offer ostrich feathers, eggs, and other<br/>
articles, for sale.<br/>
<br/>
Opposite to Assouan is the Island Elephantine and its Nilometer, which is generally visited at once. The remainder of<br/>
that day is devoted to Assouan and its bazaars.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">FIFTEENTH </span>DAY.<br/>
<br/>
After an early breakfast, donkeys and camels, at choice, are<br/>
waiting to convey travellers through the town and bazaar of<br/>
Assouan and the cemetery, to the desert road leading towards<br/>
Philae. About a mile from the town, on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hills </span>to the left, are<br/>
the celebrated granite quarries where the obelisks were procured, and where one may be seen partly cut out of the rock.<br/>
Continuing about one hour the river is reached, where a boat<br/>
must be obtained to convey the traveller to Philae. After exploring this enchanting place in every part, and lunching in the<br/>
small temple amid the pillars overlooking the Nile, passengers<br/>
bound to <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dy-Halfa </span>cross the river here, and go on board the<br/>
Second Cataract steamer, which is anchored <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>front of the<br/>
temple on the opposite side. Those who do not intend to go<br/>
further up the Nile return to the boat or Dahabeah, and, instead<br/>
of crossing the river back to the place where they embarked<br/>
coming from Assouan, float down the river and stop a little<br/>
above the Cataract. Landing here, in a few minutes an eminence<br/>
is reached, whence the finest view of the Cataract is obtained,<br/>
and the Nubian boys are seen dexterously shooting the Cataract<br/>
on logs of wood. Then embark again and the boat will proceed<br/>
across the river through small rapids to the village Mahattah. Donkeys and camels are not wanted, and the return to<br/>
Assouan is made by another road, striking to the left of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
