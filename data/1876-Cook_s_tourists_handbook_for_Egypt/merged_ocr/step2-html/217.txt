<br/>
ASSOUAN TO <span style="color: #0000FF;">WADY-HALFA</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Assouan (as described at p. 190) the <span style="color: #0000FF;">steamer<br/>
</span>passes on its way towards the south. Philae is soon left<br/>
behind, and the onward course is between low <span style="color: #ff0000;">granitemountains </span>that hem in the river on both sides, leaving only a<br/>
narrow cultivated <span style="color: #0000FF;">strip</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>tombs are frequent, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>on the<br/>
western bank. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakias </span>are everywhere, each paying a<br/>
tax of zoo piastres to the Government.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #0000FF;">DalAd </span>(W.) is a temple of Isis, built by Atar-Amun,<br/>
king of Ethiopia, about the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus.<br/>
<br/>
Before arriving at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gertéssee </span>the scenery of the river is<br/>
very <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine-granite </span>rocks and verdant banks, and occasional<br/>
villages and palm groves are picturesquely mingled.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gertcissee </span>(W.) are a few columns of a ruined temple,<br/>
beautifully situated on the rocks, <span style="color: #0000FF;">unlike </span>most Egyptian<br/>
temples, which are generally on the level plain. There is a<br/>
quarry near at hand, with many inscriptions and busts, etc.,<br/>
chiefly of the times of the Roman Emperors.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Téfah </span>(W.) Here <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>the remains of two temples. The<br/>
gazelle is said to be occasionally met <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>with in the desert<br/>
ravines of the neighbourhood.<br/>
<br/>
A little to the south of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Téfah </span>the "Gates of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalébsheh</span>,"<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">El </span>Bab are passed<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>this is a narrow part of the river where<br/>
the adjacent mountains bend inward on both sides of the<br/>
river and confine its channel between huge cliffs; a number<br/>
of slight rapids are formed here by the rocks.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalabsheh </span>(W.), whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">inhabitants </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>long been<br/>
noted for their fierce courage, are the ruins of the largest of<br/>
the Nubian <span style="color: #0000FF;">temples</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the steps which formerly led up to it<br/>
from the river are gone, though the parapets <span style="color: #0000FF;">remain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>hence a paved area, another flight of steps, and a stone<br/>
causeway lead to the grand terrace on which the ruins stand<span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
<br/>
