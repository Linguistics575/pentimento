The Nile, called by the Romans Nilus, and by the<br/>
Greeks <span style="color: #0000FF;">News</span>, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lhbs </span>(new mud), is the renowned<br/>
river of Egypt, so celebrated in ancient story, and whose<br/>
mysterious source has so long been a magnet of attraction<br/>
to adventurous souls.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile is formed by the junction, at about 15°<br/>
north of the Equator, of the Bahr-el-Azrek (anc. Astapus),<br/>
or Blue River, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bahr-el-Abiad</span>, or White River. The<br/>
sources of the former were visited by Paez in 1618, and<br/>
subsequently by Bruce.<br/>
<br/>
The Bahr-el-Abiad is the true Nile, though not the<br/>
<br/>
branch which supplies the "new mud," which, by gradual<br/>
deposit, has formed so large a part of the land of Egypt.<br/>
Of the explorations in connection with the Bahr-el-Abiad by<br/>
Grant, Speke, and Baker, etc., it is unnecessary here <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">speak</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>The united stream receives its last tributary, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tacazzé</span>,<br/>
in latitude <span style="color: #ff0000;">17° </span>North, near the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Addamer</span>, and then<br/>
flows on <span style="color: #ff0000;">1,3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50 </span>miles, without a single affluent, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fact, as Humboldt points out, without a parallel in the<br/>
physical geography of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">world</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>At Abn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Harned</span>, what is called the Great Bend of the<br/>
Nile occurs, the river flowing thence in a westerly course to<br/>
Edab, in Dongola, through a narrow valley. Lower N <span style="color: #ff0000;">ubia'<br/>
</span>is entered by the river at the Third Cataract, in latitude<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">19° </span>40'. The Second Cataract is that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy-Halfa </span>(p. 205)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
