<br/>
the hills. A considerable change in the situation of the bed<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>is evident here.<br/>
<br/>
On the low wooded shore to the east, close under the<br/>
mountain at the southern end of the former channel of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, are the ruins of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antinoé</span>, or Antinopolis. Some fragments of a Roman theatre and hippodrome are amongst the<br/>
chief remains. It was a Roman rather than Egyptian city,<br/>
owing its foundation to the Emperor Hadrian, who, when<br/>
visiting Egypt, was accompanied by his beautiful favourite<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Antinoiis</span>, whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">effigy </span>in marble is so familiar an object in<br/>
museums of antiquities. The Egyptian oracles had declared<br/>
that only by sacrificing what was most dear to him, could<br/>
the Emperor ensure his prosperity and the welfare of his<br/>
empire. To secure this boon for his master, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antinoiis<br/>
</span>drowned himself in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>near Beza. In memory of his<br/>
devoted friend, Hadrian built Antinopolis, according to some<br/>
on the site of Ansina the city of Pharaoh's magicians.<br/>
<br/>
In the persecution of Diocletian many Christian martyrs<br/>
perished here, and the ancient tombs in the adjacent rocks<br/>
are full of signs of Christian use as places of worship and<br/>
sepulture. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antinoé </span>was the metropolis of Upper Egypt<br/>
previous to the Saracenic invasion. There are no monuments,<br/>
only a few ruins, the limestone having been carried away<br/>
and utilized elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
At Roda (W.), a railway station, 182 miles from Cairo,<br/>
is a costly palace of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>, and a large sugar factory<br/>
employing several hundred persons. The Coptic village of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Byadeeyah </span>(W.), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeeneh </span>(E.), with numerous Christian<br/>
tombs and painted chapels of very ancient date, are next passed.<br/>
In one Egyptian grotto, near Ed Dayr en Nakhl (E.), is a<br/>
picture showing the Transport of a Colossus on a<br/>
sledge dragged with ropes, illustrating the ancient method<br/>
of dealing with these huge monuments. Probably <span style="color: #0000FF;">many<br/>
