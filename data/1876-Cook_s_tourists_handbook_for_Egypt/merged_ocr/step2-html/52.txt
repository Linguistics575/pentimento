slowly ascended it before the Etesian wind, we heard the.<br/>
thundering fall of some mud-bank, and saw by the rush of<br/>
all animated Nature to the spot, that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>had overleaped<br/>
another obstruction, and that its boundary waters were diffusing life and joy through another desert. There are few<br/>
impressions I have ever received, upon the remembrance of<br/>
which I dwell with more pleasure, than that of seeing the<br/>
first burst of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>into one of the channels of its annual<br/>
overflow. All Nature shouts for joy. The men, the children, the buffaloes gambol in its refreshing waters, the broad<br/>
waves sparkle with shoals of fish, and fowls of every wing<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">flutter </span>over them in clouds. Nor is this jubilee of Nature<br/>
confined to the higher orders of creation. The moment the<br/>
sand becomes moistened by the approach of the fertilizing<br/>
waters, it is literally alive with insects innumerable. It is<br/>
impossible to stand beside one of these noble streams, to see<br/>
it every moment sweeping away some obstruction to its<br/>
majestic course, and widening as it flows, without feeling<br/>
the heart to expand with love and joy and confidence in the<br/>
great Author of this annual miracle of mercy."<br/>

Immediately after the inundation wheat, barley, beans,<br/>
peas, lentils, vetches, lupins, clover, flax, lettuce, hemp,<br/>
coriander, poppies, tobacco, water-melons, and cucumbers<br/>
are sown, and in about four months or less are harvested. In<br/>
the summer season artificial irrigation is used for the following <span style="color: #0000FF;">crops-doura</span>, maize, onions, henna, sugar-cane, cotton,<br/>
coffee, indigo, and madder<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>Much fruit is produced in Egypt. Besides the grapes,<br/>
which are abundant, the following are also <span style="color: #0000FF;">common-dates</span>,<br/>
pomegranates, figs, apricots, peaches, oranges, lemons,<br/>
citrons, bananas, mulberries, and olives<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
