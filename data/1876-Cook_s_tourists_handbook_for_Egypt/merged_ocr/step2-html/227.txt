<span>208 THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
There are now only four monasteries in the Natron<br/>
Valley, but the ruins of many others can be traced.<br/>
<br/>
The Dayr Macarius is reached by a dreary desert<br/>
ride. It is strongly defended against Arab attacks, and<br/>
great precaution is used in admitting strangers. In the<br/>
church are relics of the saint, and some ancient paintings.<br/>
<br/>
The Dayr <span style="color: #ff0000;">Suriéni </span>is an interesting edifice<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>From<br/>
the convent wall the <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>is very striking of the desert<br/>
wastes on the outside, and the beautiful garden within the<br/>
walls, watered from a well, from which a horse or mule is<br/>
always drawing up <span style="color: #0000FF;">water</span>. In the monastery very curious<br/>
illuminated MSS. have been discovered, the best of which<br/>
are now in English libraries. There are three churches<br/>
here. One of them is adorned with some very fine wood<br/>
and ivory work.<br/>
<br/>
The Dayr Amba <span style="color: #ff0000;">BiShOi </span>contains three churches<br/>
with some relics. The desert view from this building is<br/>
perhaps its most striking feature<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Dayr <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baramoos </span>is of high antiquity, as it is<br/>
said to date from the third century of the Christian era. A<br/>
high stone wall encloses about an acre of ground. <span style="color: #ff0000;">There </span>is<br/>
a large square entrance tower, a good-sized church, and some<br/>
ruined buildings. In the church are several lamps of coloured<br/>
glass, with Arabic sentences in blue on a white ground. It<br/>
is doubtful whether they are of Venetian or Syrian manufacture, as in early times Venetian manufactories supplied the<br/>
East with goods to suit Oriental tastes. These lamps are<br/>
probably some of the oldest existing specimens of ornamental glass-work produced since classic times.<br/>
<br/>
CAIRO TO THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">FYOOM</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fyoém </span>is a province of Central Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">consisting </span>of an oval valley about 40 miles long by 30 broad<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
