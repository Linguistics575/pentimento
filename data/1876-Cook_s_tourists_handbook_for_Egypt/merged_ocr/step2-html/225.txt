low. But on either bank of the river there is an emporium<br/>
on a large scale; tents are pitched on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sand </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.piles </span>of<br/>
bales and boxes and bags of merchandise are ranged in a<br/>
ring or square; and in the midst, among camel furniture,<br/>
saddles, rugs, and cooking utensils, the owners and their<br/>
families and followers sedately squat.... Then on<br/>
the outside lie the camels, resting on the sands, and donkeys<br/>
are picketed, and big savage dogs with threatening eyes are<br/>
the sentinels keeping guard over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>fires for cooking<br/>
blaze in every such encampment as evening draws <span style="color: #0000FF;">on</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and<br/>
the men, who are black as ebony, come forward as we ride<br/>
by and offer assegais and spears <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sale</span>."<br/>
<br/>
Except when enlivened by the encampment of traders,<br/>
the scenery of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wfdy-Halfa </span>is somewhat dreary.<br/>
<br/>
The Rock Of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abooseer</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">300 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">feet </span>high, is about six<br/>
miles from <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dy- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Halfa</span>, on the West Bank. It affords a fine<br/>
view of the Second Cataract, which is about seven miles<br/>
in length, along which <span style="color: #0000FF;">space </span>the river dashes amongst and<br/>
over innumerable rocky islets; some only large stones, others<br/>
rocks of considerable size, whilst some are really islands,<br/>
with layers of sand on the surface of the rocks. Around<br/>
these islands, several of them having trees, and five being<br/>
inhabited, the waters foam ceaselessly. Far in the south<br/>
the mountains of Dongola are seen like a dark blue cloud.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rock </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abooseer </span>rises up, a sheer precipice, on the<br/>
side next the cataract, whilst on the desert side it is a succession of craggy rocks. It is customary at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abooseer </span>for<br/>
visitors to carve their names, and here the practice is harmless and has become interesting. The names of Burckhardt,<br/>
Belzoni, Lord Lindsay, Warburton, and others known to<br/>
fame, may be seen<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i<br/>
<br/>
</span>This is the usual return point for European travellers.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>Few go farther south. Beyond the Second Cataract the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile<br/>
</span>is scarcely navigable for a considerable distance<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
