<br/>
</span>affording pleasing scenery. The last part of the drive is<br/>
amongst broad meadows and <span style="color: #0000FF;">.corn-fields</span>, where flocks of<br/>
the white ibis are seen hovering.<br/>
<br/>
The busy military station of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbaseeyah</span>, where Abbas<br/>
Pasha hid himself in constant dread of <span style="color: #0000FF;">assassination </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>and the<br/>
plain where Selim extinguished the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlook </span>dynasty in<br/>
1517, and where also Kleber defeated the Turks in 1800,<br/>
are passed on the way; also the so-called Virgin's Tree,<br/>
a sycamore, under which it is said the Holy Family <span style="color: #0000FF;">rested.alt<br/>
<br/>
</span>This is really a magnificent tree, in itself worth the<br/>
excursion from Cairo to see. It is railed round to preserve<br/>
it from the hacking and carving of visitors. As a compromise,<br/>
a knife is kept and lent to any who burn to cut their names<br/>
somewhere, so that it may be done on the palings.<br/>
<br/>
The village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matareeah </span>marks the site of the gardens to which Cleopatra transplanted the balsams of Judea,<br/>
which produced the celebrated Balm of Gilead. These gardens were long famous for this precious drug.<br/>
<br/>
Here also is the Miraculous Fountain, which is<br/>
alleged once to have been salt, but has been soft and excellent ever since the Virgin <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mary </span>bathed her infant in its waters.<br/>
<br/>
At a short distance from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matareeah </span>is all that is left of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>.<br/>
<br/>
"In <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>, the Oxford of Old Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>stood the<br/>
great Temple of the Sun. Here the beautiful and the wise<br/>
studied love and logic 4000 years ago. Here Joseph was<br/>
married to the fair Asenath. Here Plato and Herodotus<br/>
pursued <span style="color: #0000FF;">philosophy </span>and history <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>and here the darkness that<br/>
veiled the great sacrifice on Calvary was observed by the<br/>
heathen astronomer, Dionysius the Areopagite."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>This Coptic miraculous tree is repudiated by the Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">Catholic<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Peres </span>Cordeliers, who say that the real tree died in 1656, and that they<br/>
have its last fragments in their convent at Cairo<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
