On the eastern bank are situated the Temples of Luxor and<br/>
Karnak.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Koorneh </span>is situated at the entrance<br/>
of the gorge leading to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Molook</span>. It was reared to<br/>
the memory of Rameses I. by his son Sethi, and is indeed<br/>
a cenotaph<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it belongs to the same era as the temple at<br/>
Abydos (p. 151), and is similar in the style and finish of its<br/>
artistic decorations. Entering by the central portal into the<br/>
Hall of the Six Columns and penetrating to the third<br/>
chamber on the right, there is an admirable head of Sethi,<br/>
scarcely yielding the palm to the finest of those on the walls<br/>
of Abydos. When Sethi died the temple was incomplete,<br/>
and it was finished by his son Rameses IL, who consecrated<br/>
it to the memory of his father as well as to Rameses I., to<br/>
whom it was originally dedicated.<br/>
<br/>
The Tombs <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">King</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>are in the desolate valley of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab-el-Molook</span>, which has been called the St. Denis of the<br/>
nineteenth and twentieth dynasties. In an adjacent valley,<br/>
not generally visited, lie the monarchs of the eighteenth<br/>
dynasty.<br/>
<br/>
All the tombs in this valley are excavated in the solid<br/>
rock, and were originally so built up and covered over as to<br/>
afford no trace of the spot where the royal mummy was<br/>
deposited. Twenty-five tombs have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">opened-not </span>all<br/>
kings however, princes and public functionaries are amongst<br/>
them--three of these tombs should be visited.<br/>
<br/>
The Tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Sethi I<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>(No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">17</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">commonly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">called<br/>
</span>Belzoni's tomb) is the most magnificent, grand and profusely adorned with sculptures. Belzoni found it had been<br/>
already opened when he discovered it half a century ago;<br/>
but every <span style="color: #0000FF;">bas-relief </span>was then perfect, and every painting<br/>
as fresh as on the day of its production. Now, through<br/>
the ravages of <span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquity-vendors </span>and unscrupulous tourists<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
