<span>ALEXANDRIA TO ROSETTA. 73<br/>
<br/>
At the western extremity of the Peninsula of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ras-etTeen </span>(once Island of Pharos) are the Arsenal, Palace of<br/>
the Viceroy, and the Eunostus Point, with its lighthouse. The<br/>
Palace can be inspected, for which a permit (easily obtained)<br/>
is necessary. The view from the balcony, the surrounding<br/>
gardens, the Carrara marble staircase, and the circular audience chamber, are the chief attractions.<br/>
<br/>
A pleasant excursion can be made from Alexandria either<br/>
by the short railway. or by road to Ramleh, where Alexandrian merchants go for fresh air and a change from the<br/>
noise and bustle of the city. The Roman Camp is passed<br/>
on the way, where the partisans of Antony were defeated by<br/>
Augustus <span style="color: #ff0000;">8.0</span>. 30, and where, in 1801, the French were<br/>
defeated by the English forces under Sir Ralph Abercromby,<br/>
who was killed in the engagement.<br/>

ALEXAN DRIA <span style="color: #0000FF;">TO </span>ROSETTA.<br/>
<br/>
This is a tedious journey of about forty-six miles by road.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Caesar</span>'s Camp and Ramleh (see above), the site of ancient<br/>
Canopus, a watering-place of infamous notoriety in<br/>
the Ptolemaic times, and Aboukir Bay, are passed en<br/>
route. The latter place lives in history as the scene of the<br/>
celebrated Battle of the Nile, where Nelson defeated the<br/>
French under Admiral Brueys. A railway <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>Rosetta is in<br/>
progress.<br/>
<br/>
Rosetta, dating from the ninth century, was once a<br/>
very important place. It has declined as Alexandria has<br/>
risen, and now contains 14,000 inhabitants, being about half<br/>
its population at the commencement of the present century.<br/>
It is a healthy and well-built town, with very pleasant environs. Here was found the famous Rosetta Stone, with an<br/>
inscription in three languages, which first led to the decipherment of the hieroglyphics of Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
