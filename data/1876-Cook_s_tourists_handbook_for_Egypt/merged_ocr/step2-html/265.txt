<span>244 EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
architecture is in the best style of Egyptian art, the beautiful<br/>
lotus and palm capitals of the columns have often been<br/>
commented on.<br/>
<br/>
Phtah, Amnon, and other deities were worshipped in<br/>
this temple, also some Assyrian deities introduced by the<br/>
Hyksos, of whom some interesting memorials have been<br/>
found in Sais. The ovals of various other kings, besides<br/>
the most frequently recurring one of Rameses, are found<br/>
here. Under the twenty-first dynasty Tanis was the capital<br/>
of the kingdom. Two black statutes and a granite Sphinx,<br/>
with numerous blocks of hewn and sculptured granite, are<br/>
amongst the noticeable objects in this desolate spot.<br/>
<br/>
As Sais and Memphis rose into importance, Tanis probably declined, yet twenty years before the Christian era it<br/>
is described by Strabo as a large town, and it did not become<br/>
insignificant for another century. It was probably long<br/>
sustained by its linen manufactures. Flax was very successfully cultivated on the marshy ground in the vicinity, and<br/>
Pliny <span style="color: #ff0000;">Speaks </span>of the Tanitic linen as the finest in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Matareeah </span>is a village about twelve miles from Sais,<br/>
where all life, subsistence, commerce, recreation, everything,<br/>
seem centred exclusively in fish. In the marshy vicinity<br/>
the sportsman may sometimes find <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>boar amongst the tamarisk bushes and reeds, and at any time can exercise his skill<br/>
on the water-fowl that congregate in the vicinity in the most<br/>
amazing abundance.<br/>
