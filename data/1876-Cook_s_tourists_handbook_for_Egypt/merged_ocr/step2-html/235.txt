<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">216 </span>THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
The stations at Belbeis and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bordein </span>are successively<br/>
passed. Near the latter are the remains of the ancient<br/>
Bubastis.<br/>
<br/>
"The young men of Aven and of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pi-Beseth</span>, shall fall<br/>
by the sword: and these cities shall go into captivity." So<br/>
prophesied Ezekiel (chap. xxx. 17). By <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pi-Beseth </span>is meant<br/>
Bubastis, in Coptic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Poubaste</span>. Here in ancient times the<br/>
goddess Baste, Pesht or Pasht, whom the Greeks identified<br/>
with Artemis, was worshipped. The festival annually held<br/>
at Bubastis in honour of this goddess, was the most important and most popular of the festivals of Old Egypt, and was a<br/>
scene of great licence.<br/>
<br/>
Bubastis was situate on the west bank of the Pelusian<br/>
mouth of the Nile, about forty miles from Memphis. Herodotus much admired the temple of the goddess. He says,<br/>
"Other temples may be grander, and may have cost more in<br/>
the building, but there is none so pleasant to the eye as this<br/>
of Bubastis." It was encircled by the city, which was built<br/>
round it, on artificial mounds. The water from the Nile<br/>
was led by a canal bordered by trees, all round the building.<br/>
And the enclosure was furthermore surrounded by a sculptured wall. Only at one place a narrow passage led under a<br/>
lofty gateway to the interior. <span style="color: #ff0000;">From </span>Sir Gardner Wilkinson's<br/>
explorations <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">appears </span>that the ruins corroborate the statements of Herodotus. The building was of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>finest red<br/>
granite.<br/>
<br/>
The palmy days of the city were long anterior to the<br/>
time of Herodotus, when Shishak, having conquered Thebes,<br/>
made his native town of Bubastis the capital of Egypt. The<br/>
names of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, Osorkon <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, and Amyrtaeus are found<br/>
sculptured on the ruins; also the name and emblem of the<br/>
lion-headed goddess Pasht. The first mention of Bubastis<br/>
in Egyptian annals is the statement of Manetho that <span style="color: #0000FF;">under<br/>
