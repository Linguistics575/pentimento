<br/>
is really the case. It is probably an unfinished Pyramid,<br/>
commenced by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senefroo</span>, the monarch who preceded Cheops,<br/>
and shows great regularity and even beauty of construction, so far as the work has gone. Adjacent to this Pyramid<br/>
is a Necropolis of the same high antiquity. In one of the<br/>
tombs were discovered, in 1872, the two beautiful statues<br/>
exhibited in the Salle des Bijoux at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boul√©k </span>Museum.<br/>
The scenery through which the steamer is now passing<br/>
is very <span style="color: #0000FF;">pleasing-an </span>agreeable mingling of verdant crops and<br/>
palm-groves. Water-fowl are abundant on the sand-bank.<br/>
"The scenery is simple and grand," says the author of<br/>
Under Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Palms.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>" Each day unrolls to you a panorama of wide, waving fields, green with corn, and maize,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sugar-cane</span>, rich and golden with the yellow-blossoming<br/>
cotton, tobacco, and lupin, and wooded with mimosa and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">date-a </span>broad belt of verdure, where, like to islands in a<br/>
sunny sea, little clustering villages uprise, clear of the<br/>
summer inundations, and mosques sheltered with thickets<br/>
of palm; a pastoral country where the sound of murmuring<br/>
water comes to you at every turn, and creaking, oxen-turned<br/>
sakies are hidden under ever-spreading sycamores<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>where,<br/>
in open meadow or thick wood shade by the water's edge,<br/>
half-naked men and women halt in their lazy working, and<br/>
stare at you; and, lastly, where, on either bank of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">calm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flowing </span>river, colossal ruins and silent cities of the dead<br/>
confront you with memories of a lost empire, and solemn<br/>
temples here and there are mirrored in the stream."<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Atfeeyah </span>(E.) is near the site of ancient Aphroditopolis,<br/>
or city of Athor, the Venus of Egypt. There are no<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">remains</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>only mounds tell of the long-perished city.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Zowyeh </span>(W., <span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>miles from Cairo), is near the site of<br/>
