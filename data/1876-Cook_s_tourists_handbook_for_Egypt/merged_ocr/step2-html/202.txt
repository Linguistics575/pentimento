<span style="color: #ff0000;">plete </span>even than that at Denderah. The magnificent <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylon<br/>
</span>and wall of enclosure are quite unique.<br/>
<br/>
Not many years ago the <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>village of Edfou covered<br/>
the whole of the temple except the propylon; even the terraces of the roof were concealed by houses, and the interior<br/>
was choked with rubbish to the very ceilings. Now, thanks<br/>
to the energetic labours carried on by Mariette Bey, under<br/>
direction of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive</span>, the temple, in all its completeness,<br/>
is accessible to the visitor.<br/>
<br/>
The entire length of this magnificent temple is 450 feet;<br/>
the propylon is nearly 2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jo </span>feet in breadth<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the Towers<br/>
are <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>feet in height, and can be ascended by 250 steps;<br/>
from the summit there is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>view of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>Valley. It<br/>
is best to make this ascent before entering the temple, as in<br/>
that way a good general idea is obtained of the arrangement of the building before examining its details more<br/>
minutely. These lofty towers forming a monumental entry<br/>
to the temple seen at a great distance, used to be adorned<br/>
with immense flags. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade </span>may be noticed the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">aperture</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>in which the masts <span style="color: #0000FF;">supporting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>banners were<br/>
inserted.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple of Edfou was founded by Ptolemy IV.<br/>
(Philopator), the sanctuary and adjoining chambers being the<br/>
work of that prince; the decoration of the central halls is<br/>
due to Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span>(Philometer)<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>succeeding princes of the<br/>
same house continued the work of construction and decoration till the reign of Ptolemy XIII. (Dionysius), who constructed, or at least decorated the pylon. The temple was<br/>
dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Her-Hat </span>and his mother Athor, the Egyptian<br/>
Venus. In the inscriptions <span style="color: #0000FF;">Her-Hat </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">described </span>as "lord<br/>
of the heavens, son of Osiris, king of the kings of Lower<br/>
and Upper Egypt, master of gods and goddesses."<br/>
<br/>
Very interesting sculptures and inscriptions abound <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
