PETRA TO HEBRON. BY KERAK AND THE<br/>
DEAD SEA.<br/>
<br/>
M'aan, five hours from Petra by crossing the eastern<br/>
ridge of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edom</span>, is a station on the Syrian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haj </span>Road. Here<br/>
probably dwelt the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maonites</span>, mentioned by Joshua in <span style="color: #0000FF;">his<br/>
</span>address to the repentant Israelites, as having leagued with<br/>
the Amalekites in war against them (Judges x. 12). <span style="color: #0000FF;">A<br/>
</span>castle of the time of the Caliphate, in partial ruin, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>only<br/>
object of interest.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shobek</span>, in all probability the Mons Regalis of the<br/>
Crusaders, is a strong castle six miles north of Petra, reached<br/>
after seven hours' journey from <span style="color: #ff0000;">M'a√©n </span>amongst the mountains of Edom. Some four hundred Arabs inhabit the<br/>
interior of this fortress. On the adjacent ruins of an old<br/>
church is an inscription in Latin, dating from the time of<br/>
the Christian kingdom of Jerusalem. There are fine views<br/>
from the castle walls<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>Proceeding northwards, an ancient road is met with,<br/>
where Roman milestones and portions of Roman pavement<br/>
still remain.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghurundel </span>is reached in six hours; the hill-side is<br/>
covered with extensive ruins, a few columns still remaining<br/>
erect. Though now entirely deserted, it was, in the early<br/>
centuries of the Christian era, a flourishing city and bishop's<br/>
see.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Busiereh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Little </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Busrah</span>") is three hours farther<br/>
north-west. It is probably the site of Bozrah, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
