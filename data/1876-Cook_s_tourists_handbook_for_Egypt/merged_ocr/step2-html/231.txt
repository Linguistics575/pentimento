<br/>
the inhabitants and the traders have a remarkable simplicity<br/>
about them. Soldiers in uniform mingle with the crowd<br/>
and rather <span style="color: #0000FF;">spoil </span>the picturesque effect produced by the<br/>
fellahs, each clad in a long single robe of blue material,<br/>
gathered at the waist by a girdle, and wearing a white<br/>
turban, and a simple cap of brown or white felt..... The<br/>
women of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeeneh </span>are more pretty and less uncouth than<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">those'in </span>other parts of the province. Many of them dispense with the traditional veil, which ought to leave only<br/>
their eyes visible, and dress their hair tastefully and coquettishly, besides adding to their customary blue robe, silken<br/>
scarves of various brilliant shades, and ornaments in gold and<br/>
silver of the finest workmanship."<br/>
<br/>
The inhabitants of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeeneh</span>, and, indeed, of the towns<br/>
in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">yodm </span>generally are, to a large extent, Copts.<br/>
There is a school here in connection with the American<br/>
Mission at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senoris </span>(p. 214).<br/>

The shapeless mounds which show the site of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsino√©<br/>
</span>or Crocodilopolis, are to the north of the town. Here<br/>
dwelt the worshippers of the sacred crocodiles of Lake<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Maxis</span>, in perpetual feud with the people of the neighbouring city of Heracleopolis, where dwelt the worshippers of<br/>
the Ichneumon. _<br/>
<br/>
Of the famous Labyrinth little but the site now<br/>
remains. To visit this object of interest (over six miles)<br/>
a guide is requisite. Broken columns, and fragments of<br/>
granite sculpture, whisper of the former glory of this renowned pile. The buildings formerly extended 1150 ft.<br/>
by 8 <span style="color: #0000FF;">So </span>ft., surrounding an open area 600 ft. by <span style="color: #0000FF;">500 </span>ft.<br/>

"Its primary conception," says F. B. Zincke, "had<br/>
been that of a place of assembly for the parliaments of old<br/>
Egypt. At that time one of the courts, to which were<br/>
attached 250 <span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers-half </span>being above ground and <span style="color: #0000FF;">half<br/>
