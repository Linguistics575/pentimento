<span>PHILE. 1 <span style="color: #ff0000;">95<br/>
<br/>
</span>for the punishment of those who offended the majesty of<br/>
the priesthood."<br/>
<br/>
The whole area of the ancient temple was <span style="color: #0000FF;">43 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">f </span>ft. long<br/>
by 135 broad, according to some measurements, but it is difficult to say how much of the surrounding ruins were adjuncts<br/>
of the temple, or separate structures.<br/>
<br/>
In after times, when the Christians were in the ascendant<br/>
in Nubia, the sculptures were defaced with hammers, and<br/>
the paintings daubed with mud. In 577 A.D. the interior<br/>
of the temple became, under Bishop Theodorus, the church<br/>
of St. Stephen, and at a yet later period, a Coptic church<br/>
was built up out of the ruins.<br/>
<br/>
Taken as a whole, the ruined Temple of Isis at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>is<br/>
an elegant example of the lighter architecture of the Ptolemaic era, and does not present the <span style="color: #0000FF;">aspect </span>of colossal grandeur<br/>
seen in the Theban ruins.<br/>
<br/>
There is a staircase leading to the top of the propylon.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>is very fine, and has been thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">described</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>"Beneath lies the verdant and flowery islet, strewn with<br/>
marble wrought into every beautiful form known to ancient<br/>
art; over that pile of prostrate pillars, a grove of palms is<br/>
waving<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>from between the columns of yon small temple,<br/>
the acacia's foliage seems to gush, and its blossoms stream.<br/>
Round all the island flows the clear, bright river, and<br/>
opposite lies the old Temple of Osiris, now called Pharaoh's<br/>
Bed. Beyond the river are gleams of green, shooting across<br/>
drifts of desert sands, palms, rocks, villages, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">wastes</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>and over all, darkly encircling this paradise, rises the rugged<br/>
chain of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hemaceuta</span>, or golden mountains.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>other ruins on the island of Philae, the principal are<br/>
as <span style="color: #ff0000;">follows</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
</span>Temple of Esculapius, in front of the Temple of<br/>
Isis, near the beginning of the eastern corridor<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
