Many other buildings might be enumerated, but as the tourist<br/>
would look in vain for any sign of their former existence,<br/>
this brief description will suffice to give some notion of the<br/>
former grandeur of Alexandria.<br/>
<br/>
When, in 640 A.D., Amer, the general of the Caliph<br/>
Omar, subdued Egypt, Alexandria had considerably declined,<br/>
but was still a great city. "I have taken the great city of<br/>
the West," he says, in writing to the Caliph. "It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">impossible </span>for me to enumerate the variety of its richness and<br/>
beauty, and I shall content myself with observing that it contains 4000 palaces, 400 baths, 400 theatres or places of<br/>
amusement, 12,000 shops for the sale of vegetables, and<br/>
40,000 tributary Jews."<br/>

Passing over a dozen centuries, during which Alexandria<br/>
had gradually declined under the successive rule of the<br/>
Caliphs, Sultans, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks</span>, we find the city at the<br/>
time of the French invasion had become small, <span style="color: #ff0000;">povertystricken</span>, and insignificant.<br/>

author of The Crescent and the Cross, "his clear intellect at once<br/>
comprehended the importance of the ancient emporium.<br/>
Alexandria was then become a mere harbour for <span style="color: #0000FF;">pirates-the<br/>
</span>desert and the sea were gradually encroaching on its <span style="color: #0000FF;">boundaries</span>. But the Pasha ordered the desert to bring forth corn<br/>
and the sea to <span style="color: #0000FF;">retire</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and the mandate of this Eastern<br/>
