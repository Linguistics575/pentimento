</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">...<br/>
<br/>
</span>journey from Jenin to Nazareth in less than seven to eight hours. Again<br/>
we advise the spending of Sunday at this place of sacred memories.<br/>
<br/>
Ninth <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dar-The </span>journey from Nazareth to the Sea of Galilee, by<br/>
Kenna, or Cana, occupies about six hours in the saddle, or more if the<br/>
camp is stationed at the head of the lake. If possible two days should be<br/>
appropriated to this locality, so rich as it is in historical reminiscences, in<br/>
addition to its pleasant natural attractions.<br/>
<br/>
Tenth <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dar-Two </span>ways present themselves from the head of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lake-the </span>site of the ancient Chorazin and Capernaum, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Btniils-Casarea<br/>
</span>Philip i. The way by the Waters of Merom occupy two days, and that<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Safed </span>and Naphtali takes three days. The latter is the most interesting, and is free from the swamps and damp of the lower road. The<br/>
choice of these two ways is generally left to the travellers, who may be<br/>
guided by the state of the weather and the time at their disposal. Assuming<br/>
that the high road is preferred, three days will be consumed between the<br/>
Sea of Galilee and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bannis</span>, and to that section of the itinerary we allot the<br/>
<br/>
Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Days of travel, arriving at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ba</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nia</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>on<br/>
the Thirteenth Day of actual travel, not including the time spent at Jerusalem and the Sunday at Nazareth, to attain which the start <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Jerusalem<br/>
</span>should be not later than Wednesday morning.<br/>
<br/>
Fourteenth <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dar-Starting </span>from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Banifis</span>, there is a pretty sharp rise up<br/>
the slopes of Hermon until an elevation of about 5000 feet from the sea<br/>
level is reached. It is a rough way at best, and in stormy weather the<br/>
most disagreeable part of the journey, often blocked with snow, and then<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to discern the outlines of the track. Eight hours of uninterrupted<br/>
travel bring the riders to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kefr </span>Hawar, a camping-ground still too elevated<br/>
and exposed to the rude blasts from Hermon to be very agreeable. It is<br/>
always pleasant to get safely on the way to the great plain on which<br/>
Damascus is located, and the<br/>
<br/>
Fifteenth Day is generally a pleasant ride of about six hours to Damascus, where a Sunday and about a couple more days are required to get<br/>
a good view of the peculiarities of the city.<br/>
<br/>
Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Days are spent in traversing<br/>
the heights and depths of the Anti-Lebanon, following for a day or more<br/>
the course of the Barada (the Abana of Scripture), which is crossed and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">re-crossed </span>at several points. The ride altogether is very fine in good<br/>
weather, and the day's work not very heavy. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>generally get into Baalbec<br/>
a little after midday, on the third day out from Damascus, and a long<br/>
afternoon and evening, and pleasant early morning, are consumed amid the<br/>
ruins of the famed group of demolished temples, which still present features<br/>
of great artistic beauty and strength.<br/>
<br/>
Nineteenth <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dar-A </span>comparatively easy ride of about eight hours down<br/>
the fertile valley of the Lebanon brings the traveller to a convenient camping-ground, adjacent to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">diligence </span>road from Beyrout to Damascus. It<br/>
is interesting to deviate a little <span style="color: #ff0000;">mm </span>the beaten track, and pass through the<br/>
Christian village of Zahleh, where the good effects of Christian education<br/>
are seen in the marked decorum of an apparently thriving population.<br/>
<br/>
Twentieth <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dar-The </span>journey to Beyrout is continued over an excellent<br/>
coach road rising to an elevation of 5000 feet, and then descending by<br/>
winding <span style="color: #0000FF;">slopes</span>, with magnificent scenery on either hand, to the best-built<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">an</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span>most prosperous city in Syria. At Beyrout the itinerary termina es<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
