broad<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>its population <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>about 8000. Dates are abundant, also<br/>
the usual cereals. There are some sulphurous springs, a salt<br/>
lake, many ruins of temples, a necropolis, and other remains.<br/>
At Om Baydah are the remains of the Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aman</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Neph</span>, where the priests proclaimed Alexander the son of<br/>
their god. This temple is said to have been built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekhther-Hebi</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectabes </span>I. The Fountain of the Sun is<br/>

points, as Abydos, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Farshoot</span>, etc. The most convenient route is by way of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p.146</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The Great Oasis consists of a portion of the land lying<br/>
