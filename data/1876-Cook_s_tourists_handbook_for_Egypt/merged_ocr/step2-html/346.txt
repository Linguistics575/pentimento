ROUTES FROM LONDON TO THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
In connection with Palestine Tours the routes from London may be<br/>
classified under two heads, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>FIRST, ROUTES OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">PERSON </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ALLY-CONDUCTED </span>TOURS.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>) For long tours the usual course is to cross the English Channel by<br/>
either the Calais route (the shortest sea passage), or by Dieppe (the shortest<br/>
distance to Paris). From Paris go direct to Turin by the Mont Cenis<br/>
Tunnel, and from Turin by Bologna and Ancona to Brindisi; thence by<br/>
steamer to Corfu, and then to Alexandria; after visiting Lower Egypt or<br/>
going up the Nile, cross the land of Goshen to Ismailia, and there take<br/>
steamer on Suez Canal for Port Said<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>from Port Said sail to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jaffa </span>and land<br/>
there<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>make the tour of the country, and re-embark on steamer at Beyrout<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Constantinople </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>thence to Athens, and complete the tour of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medi</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">terranean </span>and Adriatic by landing at Trieste; return through Italy by<br/>
Venice, Milan, and Turin, and back to Paris and London<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Whilst this is the general course of the conductors, many modifications,<br/>
extensions, or abridgments may be made to suit the convenience and meet<br/>
the wishes of the travellers, who may go through Italy and meet the conductor at Brindisi, or may go round by Nice, Mentone, etc., and meet the<br/>
party at <span style="color: #0000FF;">any'practical </span>point. The route from Palestine may be varied by<br/>
going direct <span style="color: #0000FF;">om </span>Smyrna to Athens, then to Constantinople, and up the<br/>
Danube to Vienna; or from Trieste, parties can go direct to Vienna.<br/>
<br/>
From other ports of northern Italy the Alps can be crossed, so as to<br/>
return by Bavaria or Switzerland and the Rhine, or some other deviations<br/>
from the beaten track can be provided for if desired.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>) The route for short tours to Lower Egypt and two or three weeks<br/>
in Palestine, is usually from London to Turin, as described above, then to<br/>
Genoa, and take steamer there for Alexandria, calling at Leghorn, Naples,<br/>
and Messina. Proceed through Lower Egypt to Ismailia and Port Said,<br/>
and thence to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jaffa</span>. Return from Jaffa or Caifa to Alexandria, and thence<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Naples</span>, and by railway to Rome, Florence, Bologna, Turin, or round by<br/>
Venice and Milan to Turin en route for Paris. This is the cheapest and<br/>
most popular route to Palestine. The whole may be covered from New<br/>
York and back for <span style="color: #0000FF;">500 </span>dols. to 600 dols. first class, or 400 dols. to<br/>
500 <span style="color: #0000FF;">dots</span>. second class, hotels included. But this route can be modified,<br/>
extended, or abridged in many ways. It can be reversed through Italy,<br/>
and other lines of steamers can be taken from French or Italian ports. In<br/>
all cases of personally-conducted tours it is necessary to define the route<br/>
the conductor will take, and those who keep with him will fare the best, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>baggage, omnibus, and other incidental charges are paid by him<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>but if<br/>
any leave him it is not possible to control these expenses, and the travellers.<br/>
must then take their own course and pay the extras. But tickets can <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span>provided for travelling by any conceivable line of railway or steamboat<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
