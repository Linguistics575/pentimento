Skirting the Red Sea the base of Jebel Usdum is reached<br/>
in five hours. A range of hills is passed, about five miles in<br/>
length, and consisting of mineral salt. Here probably was<br/>
the "Valley of Salt," where the Edomites were vanquished<br/>
by David and Amaziah. The range is called Jebel<br/>
Usdum, probably from Sodom, which was situate a little<br/>
to the north, where now are the waters of the Dead Sea.<br/>
