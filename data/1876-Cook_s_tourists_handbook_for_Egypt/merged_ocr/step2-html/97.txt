that the land which the Israelites should possess "is not as<br/>
the land of Egypt, where thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">sowedst </span>thy seed, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">wateredst<br/>
</span>it with thy foot, but is a land of hills and valleys, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">drinketh<br/>
</span>water of the rain of <span style="color: #0000FF;">heaven</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dent</span>. xi. 10-12).<br/>
<br/>
Not less interesting is it to watch the ploughing<br/>
with the quaint old plough, with which everyone is<br/>
familiar in illustrated scriptural books<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and not infrequently<br/>
it is drawn by camel and buffalo<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>"unequally yoked" together.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>is a large town, boasting the finest station passed<br/>
on the journey. Branch lines run from this place to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dessook<br/>
</span>(pp. 37, <span style="color: #ff0000;">7 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>), 46% miles, to Shebeen-el-Kom, 18% miles, to<br/>
Damietta, by Talka (near Mansoorah), 72 miles (p. 37),<br/>
and to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zifté</span>, by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahallet </span>Rokh junction, <span style="color: #0000FF;">331 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">miles</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>is celebrated for its <span style="color: #ff0000;">fétes </span>or festivals. They are<br/>
held in January, April, and August, lasting eight days on<br/>
each occasion. These Observances are in honour of the<br/>
Seyyid <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahmed-el-Bedawee</span>, a Muslim saint, invested with<br/>
divine power, to whom an invocation in the midst of impending accident or catastrophe is guaranteed to bring strength to<br/>
the faithful. These <span style="color: #ff0000;">fétes</span>, which are attended by two or<br/>
three hundred thousand people, are the most interesting to be<br/>
seen in Egypt. Every phase of Egyptian life may be seen<br/>
here, and the revelries are enjoyed by all classes of society,<br/>
from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>, who has a palace here for the purpose,<br/>
down to the poorest fellah.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Birket-es-Sah </span>the Damietta branch of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>is<br/>
crossed by another handsome new bridge. The palace of<br/>
Abbas Pasha is seen, and then Benha is reached (p. 2 36).<br/>
This is a junction for either Mansoorah or Ismailia, both vid<br/>
Zagazig. Benha is a decayed town, once noted for its honey,<br/>
afterwards, for a time, an important seat of the cotton trade.<br/>
Close at hand are the ruins of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Athritis</span>, of Greek, Roman<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
