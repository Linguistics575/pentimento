<br/>
whole face of the country is becoming changed. Everywhere<br/>
along the line of the Canal herbage of various kinds is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">springing </span>up. It is, of course, known to everyone that the<br/>
water of the Canal is salt; but as it filtrates through the<br/>
sand it becomes capable of affording nourishment to vegetation. Then the large influx of water into the desert has<br/>
affected the <span style="color: #0000FF;">atmosphere</span>. The rapid evaporation which takes<br/>
place during the day descends in thick dews at night. Captains of Suez Canal steamers declare that even in the case of<br/>
such a rarity as rain, the rainfall is every year markedly increasing. The new verdure of portions of the desert itself<br/>
attracts the clouds according to a well-known natural phenomenon. It is also asserted that more and more each year<br/>
the climate of the northern portion of the Gulf of Suez is<br/>
becoming assimilated to that of the Mediterranean. This is<br/>
owing to that very steady, though gentle current which is<br/>
known to flow through the Canal in the direction of the Red<br/>
Sea, where, as is natural, evaporation goes on at a greater<br/>
pace than in the Mediterranean. It has been tested and<br/>
found true that the water of the Canal at the Suez mouth,<br/>
notwithstanding that it has passed through ninety miles of<br/>
burning desert, is cooler than that of the Red Sea ten miles<br/>
or so south of Suez. Since the Canal was opened there has<br/>
been threefold more water in the Bitter Lakes. This<br/>
summer, especially, a change for the cooler has been noticed<br/>
by numbers of observers <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the desert which <span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span>' "<br/>
