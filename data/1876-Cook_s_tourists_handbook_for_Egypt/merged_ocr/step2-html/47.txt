<span>With the exception of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>Valley and the Delta, the<br/>
country is mostly desert. There are a few oases in the<br/>
Western Desert, the largest of which is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Séewah</span>, formerly<br/>
Ammonium, where the Temple of Jupiter Ammon once stood.<br/>
This oasis has an area of about <span style="color: #0000FF;">BO </span>square miles, and is about<br/>
ten days' journey from Cairo (p. 2 34). Between the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>and<br/>
Red Sea are mountains rising to a height of 6000 feet.<br/>
Along the coast of the Mediterranean are several lagoons, of<br/>
which the principal are Lake Menzaleh, 50 miles (p. 240);<br/>
Lake Mareotis, 40 miles (p. 76) <span style="color: #0000FF;">J </span>and Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boorlos</span>, 30<br/>
miles. About <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jo </span>miles south of Mareotis are the<br/>
curious Natron Lakes (p. 207), which dry up in summer,<br/>
leaving a crust of natron, or carbonate of soda, on the ground.<br/>
About 50 miles further south is the most noted lake in<br/>
Egypt, the Birket-el-Korn (p. 209), about 30 miles in length<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">} </span>broad.<br/>

The geological features of Egypt are plainly marked.<br/>
There is the alluvial soil, covering Lower Egypt to the depth<br/>
of 30 or 40 feet, and clothing with fertility the long valley<br/>
of the Nile. This valley is enclosed by rocks of limestone<br/>
as far as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>. Of this stone the Pyramids of Ghizeh are<br/>
built, and stand upon one of the plateaux frequent in the<br/>
limestone districts. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>to Assouan the mountains<br/>
are of sandstone, a durable, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">-yet </span>easily worked, stone,<br/>
which was quarried to a large extent by the ancient Egyptians, and furnished the materials for most of the great<br/>
temples, etc. Thebes was built of sandstone. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuaén<br/>
</span>comes a belt of granite, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and'from </span>this region the stone was<br/>
brought for the obelisks, and colossal statues reared by the<br/>
ancient Egyptians, and also for the temples of the Delta,<br/>
where the effects of a damper climate had to be provided.<br/>
