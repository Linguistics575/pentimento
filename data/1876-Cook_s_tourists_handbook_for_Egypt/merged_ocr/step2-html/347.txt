<br/>
Independent travellers, in small or large parties, can be provided for<br/>
over any route they choose to select, either from America, London, Paris,<br/>
Brussels, Berlin, Switzerland, the South of France, or Italy. Travellers<br/>
from any point can have tickets to travel when they please and how they<br/>
please, with or without coupons for days, weeks, or months.<br/>
<br/>
We have already intimated that we can provide passages from America<br/>
by any line of Atlantic <span style="color: #ff0000;">steamers</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and taking London as the starting-point<br/>
for the East, the following, amongst other routes, can be provided <span style="color: #0000FF;">for</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>

<br/>

Bale, and over the Splugen or St. Gotthard to Milan<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>or from the Rhine<br/>
to Munich, and over the Brenner to Verona, and through Italy.<br/>
<br/>
Italy may be traversed in going out or in returning, and travellers may<br/>
tarry as long as they like in any Italian city.<br/>
<br/>
All steamers from France or Italy are available. From Marseilles, the<br/>
Messageries Maritimes, which also take up at Naples. From Genoa,<br/>
Leghorn, or Naples, the Rubattino steamers to either Alexandria or Port<br/>
Said. From Venice, Ancona, or Brindisi, the Mail Steamers of the Peninsula and Oriental line to Alexandria, which line is also available from<br/>
Southampton to Port Said or Suez. From Venice, Trieste, Brindisi, or<br/>
Corfu, the Austrian Lloyds, which encompass the circle of the Levant, and<br/>
the steamers of which line are most practicable for Palestine <span style="color: #0000FF;">tours </span>All<br/>
our personally-conducted tours go by that line because it is the best adapted<br/>
for our purposes.<br/>
<br/>
On the Syrian Coast we offer a choice of Austrian, French, Russian, or<br/>
Egyptian steamers. We thus command the entire steamboat accommodations of Italy, <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rance</span>, and the Levant, and we can also give tickets to<br/>
go through Algiers, Sicily, and other islands of the Mediterranean, in<br/>
connection with Palestine, Egypt, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, and the Desert. We can<br/>
furnish tickets to return to America by the south course of the Atlantic,<br/>
from Gibraltar direct to New York, without returning through Europe;<br/>
or we can arrange for visiting Scandinavia either before or after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pales<br/>
<br/>
</span>tine tour.<br/>

<br/>
In face of such variety of routes it is almost impossible to quote fares<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">independent </span>travel until it is known exactly what applicants desire.<br/>
We <span style="color: #0000FF;">prefer </span>that Passengers should make out their own programmes, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">name<br/>
</span>the places they wish to visit, and the time they wish to spend abroad, and<br/>
we can then give them quotations.<br/>
