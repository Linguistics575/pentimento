The Rameseum or Memnonium. The proper<br/>
appellation of this wonderful edifice, without a rival <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>Egypt<br/>
for elegant sculpture and symmetrical architecture, is the<br/>
Rameseum. It was built by Rameses <span style="color: #ff0000;">11.</span>, whose cartouche<br/>
appears on each of the walls, to perpetuate his own memory,<br/>
in fact, to serve as his own cenotaph, and be the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lasting<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">memorial </span>of his greatness and glory.<br/>
<br/>
In front of the first court are two pylons more or less<br/>
demolished. One of these structures (the West) looks as<br/>
if it only remained standing by a miracle of equilibrium,<br/>
but as it is described in the same way by the French savant<br/>
four score years ago, its immediate fall need not perhaps<br/>
be expected. Both the towers are adorned with sculptures<br/>
representing battle scenes, etc., from the campaign of<br/>
Rameses, otherwise known as Sesostris. The king is<br/>
represented in these scenes as fighting <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the thick of the<br/>
combat and changing expected defeat to victory by deeds<br/>
of personal valour.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the large court, against the columns surrounding it are seen large figures of Rameses, with the attributes<br/>
of Osiris. In this court once sat, with hands reposing on<br/>
the knees in Egyptian fashion, the most gigantic statue ever<br/>
carved in Egypt from a solid block of granite. It measured<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>met. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jo </span>cent. in height, and is calculated to have weighed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">387 </span>tons.<br/>
<br/>
"By some extraordinary catastrophe this granite statue<br/>
of Rameses has been thrown down, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabrhave<br/>
</span>scooped their millstones out of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">face</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but you can see<br/>
what he was, the largest statue in the world. Far and wide<br/>
his enormous head must have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">seen-eyes</span>, nose, and<br/>
ears. Far and wide you must have seen his hands resting<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
