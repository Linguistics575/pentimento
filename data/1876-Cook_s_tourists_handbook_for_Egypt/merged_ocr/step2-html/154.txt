Helwan (E.) marks the site of a Nilometer of older<br/>
date (say some) than that at Roda; some of its columns<br/>
still remain. Here also are some sulphur springs, around<br/>
which a <span style="color: #0000FF;">watering-place</span>, frequented both by Franks and<br/>
Egyptians, has sprung up. These springs were of great<br/>
repute in ancient times. To them it is supposed King<br/>
Amenophis sent "the leprous and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">careless </span>persons,<br/>
in order to separate them from the rest of the Egyptians."<br/>
For a long period of time these <span style="color: #ff0000;">Springs </span>have fallen into<br/>
disuse, but it has quite recently become the fashion for residents of Cairo to resort there. The springs have been found<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>beneficial in various forms of disease to which<br/>
residents in so hot a climate are subject. Many who suffer<br/>
from irritation of the skin and other effects of the climate<br/>
find benefit from taking a course of these baths. There is<br/>
no doubt, that from their advantageous proximity to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshayn </span>Railway Station, on the Upper Egypt line, and from<br/>
the increasing <span style="color: #0000FF;">popularity </span>of the place, great improvements<br/>
will be made in order to render the present inadequate<br/>
arrangements better suited to the requirements of residents<br/>
and visitors.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshayn </span>(15 miles from Cairo) is a Railway<br/>
Station. Memphis (p. 125), the Serapeum (p. 128), the<br/>
Pyramids of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkérah </span>(p. 128) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dashéor </span>(p. 126), can<br/>
now be visited whilst the steamer halts, if not previously<br/>
seen by excursion from Cairo (pp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">125-128</span>). The steamers<br/>
arrive in the evening, and donkeys are sent from Cairo to<br/>
enable passengers to visit Memphis and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>early in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">morning</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Rigga (W.) is about four miles from the curious object conspicuous for some time from the steamer, and called by the<br/>
Arabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">Haram-el-Keda'b</span>, or False Pyramid, from the idea that<br/>
the base was a rock, instead of the whole being built up, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
<br/>
