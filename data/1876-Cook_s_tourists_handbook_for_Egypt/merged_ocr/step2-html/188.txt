</span>on his elephantine knees. You sit on his breast and <span style="color: #ff0000;">look<br/>
</span>at the Osiride statues which support the portico of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>temple, and they seem pigmies before him. Nothing that<br/>
now exists in the world can give any notion of what the<br/>
effect must have been when he was erect. Nero towering<br/>
above the Colosseum may have been something like it; but<br/>
he was of brass, and Rameses of solid granite. Rameses<br/>
also was resting in awful majesty after the conquest of the<br/>
whole known world. No one who entered the temple<br/>
could have thought of anything else but that stupendous<br/>
being who had thus raised himself up above the whole <span style="color: #0000FF;">world<br/>
</span>of gods and <span style="color: #0000FF;">men</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-Dr. </span>Stanley (Sinai and Palestine).<br/>

Numerous scenes from the history of the wars of Sesos<br/>
tris are sculptured on the walls of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">court-chiefly </span>battles<br/>
with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khetas </span>on the banks of the Orontes. In other<br/>
parts of the temple there are religious scenes representing<br/>
Rameses worshipping the Theban gods <span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>long lists of princes<br/>
and princesses of the royal family, and an astronomical<br/>
picture of some note which reveals the date of the building<br/>
1322 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C</span>. The hall conducting to the ceremonial chambers<br/>
of the edifice has graceful columns, with capitals of <span style="color: #0000FF;">opening<br/>
</span>flowers.<br/>
. The Colossi, both representing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amunoph </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, once<br/>
stood before the pylon of the temple of that <span style="color: #0000FF;">monarch-a<br/>
</span>temple which has disappeared to the very foundations. They<br/>
once with their pedestals stood sixty feet above the sand,<br/>
but the deposition of vegetable soil round their base has<br/>
taken a few feet from their apparent altitude.<br/>
<br/>
The northernmost of these statues was long known <span style="color: #ff0000;">asthe<br/>
</span>vocal Memnon, and was celebrated for the musical sounds<br/>
said to issue from it when the first rays of morning fell on<br/>
the statue. Strange to say, this<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>only happened after the<br/>
statue had <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">partially </span>destroyed by an earthquake, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
