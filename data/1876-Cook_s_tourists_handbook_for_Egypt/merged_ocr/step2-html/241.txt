project of facilitating this route by a canal. In 1854. Said<br/>
Pasha invited M. Lesseps to Egypt, and granted certain<br/>
rights. After incessant labour with governments, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">commissions</span>, and functionaries, and against obstacles without<br/>
number, a Company was started in 1858, in which 21,000<br/>
Frenchmen, headed by Prince Jerome, took shares. In two<br/>
months the whole capital of 200,000,000 francs was subscribed, and in 1859 the work commenced. On November<br/>
18, 1862, Lake Timsah was flooded with the waters of the<br/>
Mediterranean in the presence of a diplomatic gathering.<br/>
On August <span style="color: #ff0000;">15</span>, 1865, communication. was opened between<br/>
the two seas by the passage of boats to Ismailia, and then<br/>
by the Fresh-Water Canal to Suez. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">spring'of </span>1869 the<br/>
Bitter Lakes were flooded, and the union of the Red Sea and<br/>
Mediterranean was complete. In November, 1869, the Canal<br/>
was opened with great festivities under the auspices of the<br/>
Empress Eugénie, the Emperor of Austria, the Crown Prince<br/>
of Prussia, and many other illustrious guests of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>'s.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">f </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Forebodings</span>, falsehoods, and mishaps to the contrary, M.<br/>
de Lesseps has reason to congratulate himself on an unquestionably grand success." The Times, which had been somewhat hostile from the commencement, acknowledged that<br/>
"A work like this, successfully accomplished in the face of<br/>
so many obstacles, does ".<br/>
<br/>
The great advantage of the Suez Canal is, of course, the<br/>
great decrease in the distance to be travelled between Europe<br/>
and India. It is about <span style="color: #ff0000;">11,200 </span>miles from London or Hamburgh, by the Cape of Good <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hope </span>to Bombay. By Suez it<br/>
is only <span style="color: #ff0000;">6332</span>. This reduces the voyage by twenty-four days.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">i </span>From Marseilles or Genoa a saving of thirty days is effected<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
