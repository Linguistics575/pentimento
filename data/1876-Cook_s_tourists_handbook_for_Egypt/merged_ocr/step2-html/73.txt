<span>56 EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
because thou wast a stranger in his land." From I Kings<br/>
iii. I, we learn that "Solomon made <span style="color: #0000FF;">affinity </span>with Pharaoh,<br/>
King of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought<br/>
her into the city of David." Solomon also received assistance from the same monarch in subduing the Canaanites<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>Kings ix. 16). There is reason to believe <span style="color: #ff0000;">thatintermarriage<br/>
</span>with the Egyptians was permitted to the Israelites.<br/>
<br/>
Shishak, or Sheshonk, of the twenty-second dynasty<br/>
(reigning in Bubastis) sheltered Jeroboam, and also invaded<br/>
Judah, taking from Jerusalem the treasures and shields of<br/>
gold (<span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>Kings xiv. 25, 26).<br/>
<br/>
Egypt is in several passages alluded to as a source from<br/>
which were introduced idolatrous practices into Israel, also as<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">power </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which'the </span>Jews often sinfully depended for aid<br/>
instead of only trusting in Divine protection. See <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially<br/>
</span>the denunciation of Jeremiah against the rebellious band who<br/>
followed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Johanan</span>, the son of Kareah. "The sword which<br/>
you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt,<br/>
and the famine, whereof ye are afraid, shall follow close<br/>
after you there in Egypt, and there shall ye die "( Jer. xlii.,<br/>
xliii.) Not long after Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>slew all the Jews who had taken refuge there without distinction as to age or sex.<br/>

The prophecies concerning Egypt in the pages of Isaiah,<br/>
Jeremiah, Ezekiel, <span style="color: #0000FF;">etc</span>, are very numerous. The following<br/>
may be specially <span style="color: #0000FF;">noted-Isaiah </span>xix., <span style="color: #0000FF;">xx</span>, xlv. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I4</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Jeremiah <span style="color: #0000FF;">xliii </span>8--<span style="color: #0000FF;">13</span>, xliv. <span style="color: #0000FF;">30</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">xlvi.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezekiel </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">xxix </span>.<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">xxxii</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

the actual condition of the country, and the remains of past<br/>
greatness, the intelligent traveller cannot fail to see <span style="color: #0000FF;">how<br/>
</span>much is literally fulfilled<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
