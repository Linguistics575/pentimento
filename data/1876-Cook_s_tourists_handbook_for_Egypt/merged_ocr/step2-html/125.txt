<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Old Canal is performed annually by the Governor<br/>
of Cairo with military pomp, a sort of fair being held near<br/>
the mouth of the Canal on the day of the ceremony. This<br/>
operation is performed about the middle of August, as soon<br/>
as the Nile has risen sufficiently high to flood the canal and<br/>
its tributaries.<br/>
<br/>
THE PYRAMIDS OF GHIZEH.<br/>
<br/>
The journey to the foot of the Pyramids can now be<br/>
performed in carriages in an hour and a half, along a good<br/>
road, constructed by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive </span>for the use of the Prince<br/>
of Wales and party in 1868. The former donkey route<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>owing to collections of water from the annual inundations,<br/>
was more than twice as long a journey.<br/>
<br/>
The route is through the new quarter of Cairo, called<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismaileeyah</span>, to the bridge known as the Kasr-el-Nil. Hence<br/>
the road leads under a long avenue of acacias, with rows of<br/>
towering palms, past a mud village of Arabs, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kbédive</span>'s fine Summer Palace of Ghizeh, not accessible to<br/>
visitors.<br/>
<br/>
Ghizeh was once a fortified place, a city of busy markets, gay palaces, and gorgeous mosques<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>But the glory has<br/>
departed, and scattered ruins tell of former greatness. There<br/>
is a large establishment here where the artificial hatching of<br/>
eggs can be inspected. Hens will not hatch in Egypt, so the<br/>
people bring their eggs to these institutions, receiving back<br/>
one chicken for every two eggs.<br/>
<br/>
From Ghizeh the road runs straight to the Pyramids on a<br/>
broad, firm embankment, crossing the bright green cultivated<br/>
land annually flooded by the fertilizing Nile waters. On the<br/>
right and left the <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-naked </span>peasants are seen working on<br/>
the land, with their primitive-looking implements, irrigating<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
