Another group consists of the chapel court, two halls<br/>
and a staircase on the north side, and two halls and a<br/>
staircase on the south side, and the little temple on the<br/>
terraced roof<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>this assemblage of rooms was especially<br/>
dedicated to the feast of the New Year, regulated by the<br/>
appearance of Sirius. The details of this grand ceremonial<br/>
are pictured on the walls of the two staircases.<br/>
<br/>
The remaining chambers<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>those farthest to the west,<br/>
formed the most sacred portion of the edifice. Into the<br/>
small chamber at the extreme west of the axis of the building the king alone could enter; there, in profound secrecy,<br/>
was preserved the mysterious emblem of the worship of<br/>
Athor the Life-giver, the golden sistrum. The adjacent<br/>
chambers were consecrated to the worship of Isis, Osiris,<br/>
Pasht, Horus, etc. In the walls of the temple are concealed<br/>
crypts, wherein the most valuable gold statues and other<br/>
sacred treasures were stored. On the terrace, or roof of the<br/>
building, is a small temple dedicated to Osiris.<br/>
<br/>
"The temple," accordingly, "was not, like our<br/>
churches, a place of assembly for the faithful. One finds<br/>
in it neither habitations for priests nor places of initiation,<br/>
and no traces of divination or the consultation of oracles,<br/>
and there is no reason to imagine that beyond the king and<br/>
priests anything like a public congregation was admitted.<br/>
The temple is a place of <span style="color: #0000FF;">depth</span>, preparation, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">consecration</span>. In the interior certain festivals are celebrated, processions organized, and the objects of worship stored. And, if<br/>
all was sombre, if in these halls and chambers, where<br/>
there is no indication of torches having been used, almost<br/>
darkness must have prevailed, the mystery of the ceremonies was thereby only enhanced....... As to the<br/>
principal festivals, of which the temple was the centre,<br/>
they consisted chiefly of processions which expanded <span style="color: #0000FF;">out<br/>
<br/>
