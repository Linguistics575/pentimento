142 THE NILE.

Ibrahim Pasha destroyed the villages of Beni-Hassan to cure
the inhabitants of stealing, but it seems they are still incorrigible.

The Rock Tombs of Beni-Hassan, about half an hour's
ride from the river, are justly celebrated for the light they
shed on the manners and customs of ancient Egypt. They
are excavated in the rocks above the N ile Valley, are exceedingly ancient, and from the resemblance in the style of their
porticoes to the Grecian Doric, are unique in Egypt. The
Northern tombs are the most interesting. The interior is
marked by elegant simplicity of architecture, a low wood
ceiling is supported by a central avenue of Doric columns.
Sir Gardner Wilkinson suggests that they were copied
from the stone arches of yet earlier constructions. This,
however, is reversing the general idea of the cavern suggesting the arched roof.

The inside walls of these tombs are covered with well
preserved coloured pictures in inexhaustible variety, representing the daily life of Egypt four thousand years ago. The most
northern tomb is that of Am√©ni-Amenemha, the next is that
of N oom-hotep, both governors of the province of Sah. In
the latter tomb is a picture that was thought might represent the arrival of Joseph's brethren, and attempts have
been made to identify Noom-hotep with the patriarch
Joseph. But there is evidence that the tombs were excavated long before his time under the Osirtasens of the
twelfth dynasty.

"The famous grottoes of Beni-Hassan,' says Hopley,
"are a terrace of tombs high on the shelving Arabian ridge,
overlooking a two miles' breadth of fertile land between
mountain and river. In these, as in some vast gallery-hall after hall painted in graphic wall picturings, and glowing in yet unfaded tints-you may wander at will and study
