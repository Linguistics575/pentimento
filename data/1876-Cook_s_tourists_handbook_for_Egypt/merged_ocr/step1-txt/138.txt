ENVIRONS OF CAIRO. 121

Church of Aboo Sirgeh is over the subterranean Church of
Sitt Mariam, in which are shown two niches, said to have

of the Nile and its banks, and the motley scene of busy life
at the ferry. The celebrated Nilometer is on the south of
the island, consisting of a graduated column marking the
gradual rise of the N ile as the time of the annual inundation
draws near. The 16th cubit is called the Sultan's Water, as
the land tax is not levied unless this height is attained.

would do great mischief.

The erection of this Nilometer is ascribed to the Caliph
el-Mamoon, but earlier arrangements for measuring the rise
of the river existed long before. Deodorus and Herodotus
both refer to the practice.
