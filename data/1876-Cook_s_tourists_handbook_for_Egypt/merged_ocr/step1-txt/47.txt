With the exception of the N ile Valley and the Delta, the
country is mostly desert. There are a few oases in the
Western Desert, the largest of which is Séewah, formerly
Ammonium, where the Temple of Jupiter Ammon once stood.
This oasis has an area of about BO square miles, and is about
ten days' journey from Cairo (p. 2 34). Between the N ile and
Red Sea are mountains rising to a height of 6000 feet.
Along the coast of the Mediterranean are several lagoons, of
which the principal are Lake Menzaleh, 50 miles (p. 240);
Lake Mareotis, 40 miles (p. 76) J and Lake Boorlos, 30
miles. About Jo miles south of Mareotis are the
curious Natron Lakes (p. 207), which dry up in summer,
leaving a crust of natron, or carbonate of soda, on the ground.
About 50 miles further south is the most noted lake in
Egypt, the Birket-el-Korn (p. 209), about 30 miles in length
and "broad.

G EO LOGY.

The geological features of Egypt are plainly marked.
There is the alluvial soil, covering Lower Egypt to the depth
of 30 or 40 feet, and clothing with fertility the long valley
of the Nile. This valley is enclosed by rocks of limestone
as far as Esneh. Of this stone the Pyramids of Ghizeh are
built, and stand upon one of the plateaux frequent in the
limestone districts. F rom Esneh to Assouan the mountains
are of sandstone, a durable, and Tet. easily worked, stone,
which was quarried to a large extent by the ancient Egyptians, and furnished the materials for most of the great
temples, etc. Thebes was built of sandstone. At Assuaén
comes a belt of granite, and "from this region the stone was
brought for the obelisks, and colossal statues reared by the
ancient Egyptians, and also for the temples of the Delta,
where the effects of a damper climate had to be provided.
