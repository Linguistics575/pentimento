226 THE DESERT.

N ow there are good stone houses, macadamized roads, and
beautiful-flower gardens in full growth.

The foundation of Ismailia dates from 1862, it has now
5000 inhabitants divided amongst the French, Greek, and
Arab Quarters. The harbour was a grand sight when
all nations met at the inauguration of the Canal. The
waterworks connected with the Fresh-Water Canal, with
pumping engines, cascades, reservoirs, etc., are very interesting. The town contains a fair hotel, a French bazaar, a
promenade, a villa of the Khédive, good sea-bathing accommodation, etc. The heights of El Guisr are worth visiting
for the view, if the opportunity occurs. A botanist, sportsman, or Egyptologist would find this place an enjoyable
stopping place for a short time. Pelusium, Arsinoii, Pithom,
Rameses, and Hero6polis, are (whatever is left of them)
within easy distance. "Persians, Greeks, and Romans
alike left their marks on this district. Here, too, was the
Goshen of the land of Israel. It would be interesting also
to ascertain how far, into what is now desert, reached the
land that was then cultivated."

The author of The Rob Roy on the Nile, says, "Ismailia
is like a hothouse without the glass, and all the life in it is
exotic. The sun's heat and the N ile's cool water force the
arid sand into a tropical verdure. Embosomed in this are
French cafés and billards, with Arab huts and camels; the
signboards on booths in Greek, Turkish, Spanish, and
American; ate'lz'ers resounding with hammer and cogwheel,
and tents full of half-dressed savages chaffering uproariously,
and boulevards thronged by the second rate fashion of a
F rench town, planted, and growing fast too, in the veritable
desert. Beside it lie the shores of the Lake Timsah, the
'Crocodile Lake,' which had a few pools when the Canal
was begun, but now is filled with brackish water.
