from Jaffa. It is a town of very recent growth, containing
some 10,000 inhabitants. It is regularly laid out on foundations consisting chiefly of materials excavated from the canal.
It stands where the canal pierces the low sandbank separating

more precise, in that belt of land, 90 miles or so long by
some 30 broad, which, extending between Suez and Port
Said, is directly influenced by the water of the Suez Canal.

Lakes and round about the Oasis of Ismailia. But now the
