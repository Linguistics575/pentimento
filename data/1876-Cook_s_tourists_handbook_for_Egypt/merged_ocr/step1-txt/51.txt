34 EGYPT.

The vegetable productions of Egypt depend so completely
upon the annual inundation of the country by the waters of
the N ile, that it may be well here to give an account of that
phenomenon.

It is this inundation which annually renews the richness
of the Egyptian soil by depositing upon the land a coating of
mud, thus rendering the use of any other manure entirely
unnecessary. In many places no ploughing is needed, it is
only necessary to scatter the seed, and then turn loose the
oxen or sheep or goats to trample in the grain. In other
parts agriculture is most carefully and laboriously attended
to, and artificial irrigation kept up in the intervals between
the inundations.

The rise of the N ile can be seen at Gondokooroo, lat. f,
in February, at Khartoom in March, at Dongola in May, and
commences in Egypt about the end of June. It reaches its
greatest height towards the end of September, remaining for
about fifteen days at about 24 ft. above the low water level,
after which a gradual subsidence takes place. If it rises to
30 ft. great damage ensues, if less than 18ft. famine results
in many parts. The following description of this remarkable phenomenon is from Osburn's Monumental History
of Egypt c-
"Perhaps there is not in nature amore exhilarating sight
or one more strongly exciting to confidence in God, than the
rise of the Nile. Day by day and night by night its turbid
tide sweeps onward majestically over the parched sands of
the waste, howling wilderness. Almost hourly, as we

tration of the minute accuracy of Scripture phraseology, to find that
they served the further purpose of guarding the land against the raids
of the Bedouin horsemen, who then, as now, infested the desert, and
whose depredations were checked by these canals."
