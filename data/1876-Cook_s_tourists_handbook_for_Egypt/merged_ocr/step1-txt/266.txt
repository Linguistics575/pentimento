CAIRO TO SYRIA. 245

site of ancient Pharbaethus. The French Commission
found some remains of Egyptian statuary here. Nothing
now remains but one or two broken columns. El Booka;
Aboo Shekooh. Hence fish from Lake Menzaleh is sent by
rail to Cairo and elsewhere. Semlzellawein.

Mansoorah (see p. 238).

The river must now be crossed by ferry to Talkah.
The stations passed before reaching Damietta are Shirbeen
and Kafr Terrash.

Damietta (see p. 238).

Another route is by Cairo to Tantah, on the line to
Alexandria (see p. 80), and thence by the branch line to
Talkah, and forward to Damietta, as in route above. This
route is only 126% miles, and saves the inconvenience of
ferrying across the river at Talkah.

ALEXANDRIA TO DAMIETTA.
Alexandria to Tantah (see p. 80).
Tantah via Talkah to Damietta (see above).
Damietta (see p. 238).

CAIRO TO SYRIA BY MOUNT SINAI,
'AKABAH, AND PETRA.

(The Long Desert Route.)

From Cairo to Suez by railway (see p. 215). Those who
wish to get as much desert as possible can engage camels at
Cairo, and travel eighty-two miles among the WÃ©dies and
sandhills, occupying four extra days at a considerable increase of expense. This route crosses the elevated plain of
El Muggreh, and threads the defile of El Mfslrtala. It is
an uninteresting journey, and water is very scarce.
