SOUHAG. 149

Near Gow (E.), are the ruins of Antaeopolis. In the
early part of last century, columns, etc., of great interest
were standing. N ow there is little more than a confused
heap of stones. The whole village of Gow was carried
away in 182 3 by the waters of the N ile. F

are manufactured here, also earthenware. The town con
