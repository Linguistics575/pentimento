a man, whose best garment is an untanned sheepskin, will
wear a sword, or shoulder a gun, or both, at least two of
every three of the Alewi have slung on their backs flint.lock
guns of very long barrel, often in such a condition that a
discharge, however well aimed, would be more dangerous to
the man who fires than to him who is fired at; these they
carry with them everywhere. Yet they are apparently a
cheerful, contented race, very much like the American
Negroes in their simplicity, thoughtlessness, and good
humour. Their bread is a coarse, dark, barley cake; their
dwellings are simple, low tents made of goats' hair, which
shelter from rain but in other respects, are quite uncomfortable; hence, in cold weather, they resort, if possible, to
caves. N one of them fail to understand the word backsheesh'
it is the first word the young child learns, the last the old
man utters."

At Wiitiy-ed-Dehse11 the traveller feels that he
is really traversing the desert,. nothing breaks the monotony
of the level stretch of sand. It is in this neighbourhood that
the Khamseen wind and sand storm have so frequently been
encountered. "Soon the Red Sea and all," says Dean
Stanley, "were lost in a sand storm which lasted the whole
day. Imagine all distant objects entirely lost to view-the
sheets of sand fleeting along the surface of the desert like
streams of water; the whole air filled, though invisibly, with
a tempest of sand driving in your face like sleet; imagine
the caravan toiling against this-the Bedouins, each with his
shawl thrown completely over his head, half the riders sitting
backwards-the camels, meanwhile, thus virtually left without guidance, though from time to time throwing their long
necks sideways to avoid the blast, yet moving straight onwards with a painful sense of duty truly edifying to
behold."
