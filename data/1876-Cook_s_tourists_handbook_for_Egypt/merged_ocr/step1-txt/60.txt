MAHOMEDANISM. 43

joys of heaven contained in the Kuruiim Admission to
Paradise is asserted to be won, not by merit, but by the mercy
of God, and also by his absolute decree. Predestination,
however, is differently taught by different schools of Mahomedans, as by different schools of Christians; all Muslims,
however, hold that there are some elected to eternal happiness, called welees.

"Influenced by their belief in predestination," says Mr.
Lane, "the men display, in times of distressing uncertainty,
an exemplary patience, and, after any afflicting event, a
remarkable degree of resignation and fortitude, approaching
nearly to apathy, generally exhibiting their sorrow only by a
sigh, and the exclamation, "God is bountiful! "

The Muslim officers of religion attached to the Mosques
are, first, the Warden (Na'sir), who is the trustee of all the
endowments of the Mosque, and appoints all the other
officers. Two ministers (Imaum) are employed to keep up
the Mahomedan services. The Kateeb publicly prays and
preaches on Fridays (the Mahomedan Sabbath) i the Ra'tib
recites certain prayers at stated times daily. The call to
these prayers is chanted from the galleries of the minarets by
officials called Muezzins.

Prayer, almsgiving, fasting, and pilgrimage, and also
frequent purifications by washing, are scrupulously enjoined
upon the followers of Mahomed.

Prayer must always be preceded by washing, as from a
person not clean prayer is not accepted. The dress should
also be clean, and it is proper to cover the ground with a
piece of carpet.

On entering a Mosque, the Muslim leaves his shoes with
the door-keeper (bow'wab), performs his ablutions at the
tank, if not already purified, and then, turning towards
Mecca, goes through his various orisons and prostrations.
