<span>164. THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
of time, of which history keeps the reckoning, roll before<br/>
them<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>they have seen kingdoms and nations rise and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fall-the </span>Babylonians, the Jews, the Persians, the Greeks, and the<br/>
Romans. They have seen the childhood of all that we call<br/>
ancient, and they seem likely to stand to tell their tale to<br/>
those who will hereafter call us the ancients."<br/>
<br/>
Under the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">No-Ammon</span>, Thebes is several<br/>
times referred to by the sacred writers. "I will punish the<br/>
multitude of <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span>," is the denunciation of Jeremiah (xlvi. <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>).<br/>
"I will execute judgments in No."... "I will cut off the<br/>
multitude of No."... "No shall be rent asunder," are<br/>
part of the burden of Ezekiel in the 14th, 15th, and 16th<br/>
verses of chap. xxx. In Nahum iii. 8, the Prophet Nahum,<br/>
addressing Nineveh, asks, "Art thou better than populous<br/>
No, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters<br/>
round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall<br/>
was from the sea? "See also following verses. How<br/>
severely No, or Thebes, has been "rent asunder," and<br/>
suffered from judgments of various kinds, must be apparent to every observer.<br/>
<br/>
In Jer. xlvi., the phrase, "multitude of <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span>," should be<br/>
"Ammon of No," referring to the divinity Ammon-ra, <span style="color: #0000FF;">worshipped </span>in this city.<br/>
<br/>
TH E <span style="color: #0000FF;">THEBAN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MONUMENTS<br/>
</span>The principal monuments of Thebes are, on the western<br/>
bank of the Nile, the Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Foorneh</span>, the Temple of<br/>
the Dayr-el-Bahree, the Rameseum (commonly called the<br/>
Memnonium), the Temple of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dayr-el-Medeeneh</span>, the<br/>
Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-Haboo</span>, the Necropolises of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Drah<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Abo'lnegga </span>and El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assasseef</span>, and farther in the desert the<br/>
Tombs of the Kings, in the desolate valley of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab.el-Molook</span>.<br/>
