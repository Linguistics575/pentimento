</span>2 INTRODUCTORY.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ferent </span>from anything to which the European traveller has been<br/>
accustomed; the modes of travelling are novel, and the difficulties<br/>
to be encountered greater than in any part of Europe. Of course<br/>
these difficulties are not insurmountable even if persons go alone,<br/>
or with perchance only another; but there is no doubt that the<br/>
pleasure of a tour is enhanced by being associated with a party<br/>
of friends and acquaintances, or even of strangers with no<br/>
other bond than that of being fellow tourists in strange and<br/>
novel scenes. There must of necessity be some little monotony<br/>
in a journey of from three to five weeks, as the case may be, on<br/>
the Nile, and this cannot be more pleasurably relieved than by<br/>
cheerful social intercourse. Moreover, as a question of expense,<br/>
it will often happen that certain costs which would have to be<br/>
borne by a single traveller would not be any greater for a party.<br/>
<br/>
MONEY.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Any money deposited at the offices of THOMAS COOK and<br/>
SON, will be <span style="color: #ff0000;">repaid </span>to the traveller in the currency of the<br/>
countries, as required. English gold or French gold is better<br/>
than paper in the East. Their circular notes of <span style="color: #ff0000;">g </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>or Â£10 are<br/>
better than Bank of England notes-safer and less liable to<br/>
depreciation.<br/>
<br/>
The Arabs on the Nile like the large Egyptian and Turkish<br/>
coins, and it will be well for the traveller to provide himself<br/>
with some at Cairo for backsheesh.<br/>
