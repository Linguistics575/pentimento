<span>ALEXANDRIA TO CAIRO. <span style="color: #0000FF;">81<br/>
<br/>
</span>and early Egyptian interest, but with nothing to show now<br/>
but cinders and rubbish.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tookh </span>station is passed, and the first sight of the<br/>
Pyramids is soon obtained. The next station is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalioob</span>.<br/>
The blazing desert and the Libyan hills are soon seen. The<br/>
Pyramids, as it were, seem to grow on the traveller<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>every<br/>
mile of nearer approach increases his wonder at their enormous <span style="color: #0000FF;">size</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Looking out of the windows on the left, the Mokattam<br/>
hills and the minarets of the city are seen; and after rushing<br/>
through some of the most charming scenery of the whole<br/>
route, the terminus of the railway is reached at Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
Before the train stops at the platform it is surrounded<br/>
by Arabs, clamorous for the passengers' luggage; but passengers are advised not to allow anybody to touch an article<br/>
of luggage, except the representative of Messrs. <span style="color: #0000FF;">THos</span>. Coon<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">SON</span>, or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">commissionaire </span>from one of the hotels.<br/>
<br/>
Any adventurous passenger emerging from the railway<br/>
station, baggage in hand, will find himself surrounded by<br/>
fifty donkey-boys, and a corresponding number of donkeys,<br/>
and deluged with a shower of broken English, as these<br/>
amusing little fellows cluster round, crying, "You very good<br/>
man. Try my donkey, Mr. Gladstone." "Me speak<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Englees</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>my donkey speak <span style="color: #ff0000;">Englees</span>." "What you have,<br/>
sare. This donkey, The Cure; this donkey, Mr. Plimsoll<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>this donkey, Yankee Doodle," etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller will, of course, have determined in his mind<br/>
at which hotel he will stay in Cairo. The following notes<br/>
by an old traveller may be of use <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.-<br/>
</span>"Shepheard's Hotel at Cairo realizes, as nearly as possible,<br/>
my ideal. It is a quadrangular building, with a garden <span style="color: #0000FF;">inside </span>and another outside. There is no need or opportunity<br/>
<br/>
to climb a dozen flights of stairs to your bed-room, a large<br/>
