The Oasis <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>Ammon is reached from Cairo by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Teréneh</span>, the Natron Valley (p. 207), El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Méghra</span>, El Ebah,<br/>
and El Gara to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Séewah </span>in eleven days. It can also be<br/>
reached from Alexandria, via <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baratoon</span>, by the route used by<br/>
Alexander the Great, in fifteen days; or from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">yoém</span>, by<br/>
the Little Oasis, in ten days.<br/>
<br/>
The Oasis of Ammon is about nine miles long by. two<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">broad</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>its population is about 8000. Dates are abundant, also<br/>
the usual cereals. There are some <span style="color: #0000FF;">sulphurous </span>springs, a salt<br/>
lake, many ruins of temples, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis</span>, and other remains.<br/>
At Om Baydah are the remains of the Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aman</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Neph</span>, where the priests proclaimed Alexander the son of<br/>
their god. This temple is said to have been built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekhther-Hebi</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectabes </span>I. The Fountain of the Sun is<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Séewah </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shargieh</span>. It is a pool of considerable size<br/>
and depth, in which the water is constantly steaming and<br/>
bubbling, and is warmer by night than by day.<br/>
<br/>
The Little Oasis is reached either from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fyoém<br/>
</span>(p. 208) or from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Behnesa </span>(p. 138) in about three days'<br/>
journey. It has a few monuments, but none anterior to<br/>
Roman times; the principal objects of interest are a <span style="color: #0000FF;">triumphal </span>arch, some subterraneous and other aqueducts, several<br/>
hot springs, a necropolis, and a Christian church. There are<br/>
some smaller oases in the vicinity.<br/>
<br/>
The Great Oasis can be reached from either of several<br/>
points, as Abydos, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Farshoot</span>, etc. The most convenient route is by way of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot </span>(p.146).<br/>
<br/>
The Great Oasis consists of a portion of the land lying<br/>
lower than the surrounding desert, well watered by a stream<br/>
which rises at one side of the Oasis, flows across it, and then<br/>
disappears in the sand. Palms and acacias abound, and green<br/>
