<br/>
Keneh (395 miles from Cairo) is an important place<br/>
on the east bank of the Nile; ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Crenopolis </span>occupied<br/>
the site. It has long been noted for its dates and its dancing girls, also for its manufacture of porous jugs and <span style="color: #0000FF;">filtering </span>bottles. It is interesting to watch the process of making<br/>
these articles by hand with extreme rapidity.<br/>
<br/>
There is a three days' desert route from Keneh to Kosseir<br/>
on the shore of the Red Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly opposite Keneh, on the west bank of the Nile,<br/>
stands the celebrated Temple <span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span>Denderah.<br/>
<br/>
This beautiful, well-preserved ruin dates from the period<br/>
when Egyptian architecture under the Ptolemies and Caesars<br/>
had greatly declined from its ancient grandeur, and shows a<br/>
considerable admixture of Greek and Roman with Egyptian<br/>
ideas. Like all the Egyptian temples, it stands in the<br/>
midst of a vast enclosure formed of crude bricks, and completely shutting out the sights and sounds of the outer<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
This temple was commenced under Ptolemy XII., its<br/>
construction was completed under Tiberius, and its decoration under <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ero</span>, so that this edifice was being constructed<br/>
whilst our Saviour was dwelling at Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
The immense profusion of inscriptions, bas-reliefs, etc.,<br/>
with which the walls are covered, will forcibly strike the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">attention-ceilings</span>, walls, portals, basements are all <span style="color: #0000FF;">ornamented </span>in this way. In many of these pictures the subject<br/>
is the same-the royal founder adoring the divinities of the<br/>
temple--others show the ceremonies observed by the king<br/>
in connection with this adoration. "Nothing can be more<br/>
rich," says Warburton, "than the carvings and hieroglyphics<br/>
that adorn the massive pillars crowned with heads of Isis.<br/>
The ceilings are covered with the celebrated astronomical<br/>
paintings, and the next most popular representation through<br/>
