while a few of the latter columns lasted perhaps for another<br/>
thousand years, and then they toppled over on the lonely<br/>
plain with a crash unheard <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>regardless world. The sand<br/>
soon buried them there, and even the memory of Zoan<br/>
faded away.<br/>

Tanis was a city of<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>high antiquity, and is of considerable<br/>
Scripture interest. It was built only seven years after<br/>
Hebron, which was a city in the time of Abraham (Numb.<br/>
xiii. 22). In Isaiah xix. the prophet associates Zoan with<br/>
Noph (Memphis) to express the grandeur of Egypt, and<br/>
prophesy its downfall. In Psalm lxxviii. the field of Zoan,<br/>
that is to say, the alluvial plain round the city, is described as<br/>
the scene of the miracles by which Israel was freed from<br/>
Egyptian bondage (v. 12 and 43). <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>I will set fire in Zoan,"<br/>
is the prophecy of Ezekiel (xxx. <span style="color: #0000FF;">14</span>). This prophecy has<br/>
been fulfilled. "The' field' is now a barren waste, a canal<br/>
passes through it without being able to fertilize the soil<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>fire<br/>
has been set in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Zoan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>and the royal city is now the habitation of fishermen, the resort of wild beasts, and infested by<br/>
reptiles and malignant fevers." The area, covered by the<br/>
mounds of pottery, etc., is about a mile in length, by about<br/>
three-quarters of a mile in breadth.<br/>
<br/>
The area of the sacred enclosure surrounding the temple<br/>
is some 1500 feet by 1250. The gateway, formed of granite<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">from-Upper </span>Egypt, bears the name of the founder, Rameses<br/>
the Great. The fragments <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>walls, columns, and fallen<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>, are in a very ruinous condition, but bear witness to<br/>
the former splendour of the building of which they formed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">part</span>. No other Egyptian temple has so many obelisks-here there are ten or twelve all brought by Rameses. The<br/>
