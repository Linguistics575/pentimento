<span>MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 41<br/>
<br/>
It is an error to suppose that Eastern women live in<br/>
prison-like seclusion. They are less under restraint in Egypt<br/>
than <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>any other Mahomedan country, and go out freely so<br/>
long as the face is kept veiled. Muslim law forbids a<br/>
woman's face to be seen by men, except only by husbands,<br/>
fathers, or sons. A stranger, entering a small house, where<br/>
there is no reception-room, shouts out <span style="color: #ff0000;">des/oar </span>(permission), or<br/>
something similar, to give females time to veil or retire.<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptian ladies <span style="color: #0000FF;">smoke </span>nearly as <span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span>as the men,<br/>
use cosmetics and perfumes abundantly, and are chiefly<br/>
occupied in the care of their children, and in needlework<br/>
and embroidery. Visiting, gossiping, and story-telling<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">occhpy </span>much of their time. In going abroad they usually<br/>
ride on asses, attended by a servant, and it is considered<br/>
etiquette to turn away the head on meeting them.<br/>
<br/>
Men may marry four wives if they like-one is generally<br/>
thought <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>but not to marry at all is disreputable.<br/>
Marriage is a bargain, a matter cf dowry and purchase. The<br/>
wedding is a time of great festivity and ceremonial-attended,<br/>
when means allow, with music and dancing, illuminations,<br/>
processions, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The Amusements of the Egyptians are limited in<br/>
number and variety. Chess, draughts, and other sedentary<br/>
games are popular. The coffee-houses are a great attraction,<br/>
where the Oriental seems never weary of sipping coffee,<br/>
smoking, and listening to music or story-telling.<br/>
<br/>
The Bath, with whose complicated ablutions and shampooings Englishmen have been to some extent familiarized<br/>
in their own country, is a great institution in Oriental lands.<br/>
It is a recreative enjoyment, as well as a salutary and <span style="color: #ff0000;">healthgiving </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">process</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>It is strange that Egypt has no ruins of a theatre, as in<br/>
other nations where Grecian manners for a time were domi<br/>
<br/>
