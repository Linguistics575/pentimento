As the train proceeds on its way, the blunt Pyramid of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Illahoon</span>, and the Pyramid of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hawérah</span>, rise into view. After<br/>
a time stunted trees and grass in tufts are again reached, and<br/>
at the borders of the cultivated land the train stops at El<br/>
Edwa. Here in the proper season the sportsman may pitch<br/>
his tent, and bag innumerable geese, ducks, snipe, and<br/>
quail<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>From El Edwa, a five mile run along a level plain,<br/>
amongst cultivated fields, and gardens, and villages, brings<br/>
the traveller to <span style="color: #ff0000;">vMedeeneh</span>, otherwise called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-elF </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">yoém</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">MedeenebeLFiires </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">/City </span>of the Knight). This<br/>
town, of about 8000 inhabitants, is situated on a branch of<br/>
the Bahr Yoosef (Joseph's River), so called from a<br/>
tradition (alluded to by Josephus) that it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>constructed<br/>
by order of the patriarch Joseph. But it was really a<br/>
thousand years old at his time, though possibly some enlargement, or reconstruction under his viziership, may have<br/>
originated the tradition. This canal, looking like a natural<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>river, washes the walls of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeeneh</span>, and winds along under<br/>
the palms and acacias, bearing numerous laden barges and<br/>
wherries on its bosom.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeeneh </span>is not Cairo," writes the F <span style="color: #0000FF;">reach </span>artist, Paul<br/>
Lenoir, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>its <span style="color: #0000FF;">incalculable </span>variety of buildings and<br/>
costumes; it is a large provincial town, where there are few<br/>
loungers, but where there is plenty of animation in the<br/>
streets among the buyers and sellers of the cereals, and<br/>
grasses of the country. An interminable bazaar, almost<br/>
parallel with the canal, extends throughout the whole length<br/>
of the town, and in it we recognize the crowding, and the<br/>
variety of the shops at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairn</span>, on a reduced scale. But both<br/>
