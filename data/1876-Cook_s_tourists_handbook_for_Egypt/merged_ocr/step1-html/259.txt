<br/>
Mansoorah is a great cotton town. "Cotton thrusts<br/>
forth on all sides. Children are plucking it in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields</span>, and<br/>
singing as they gather the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fleecy </span>pods into their little blue<br/>
dresses, tucked up for pockets. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span>country plantations<br/>
you see camels in a long string stalk over the plain, all cotton<br/>
laden. Boats full of it are tracked along the sleepy lagoons<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, and the countless canals which intersect the<br/>
ancient land of Goshen."<br/>
<br/>
Mansoorah (pop. 16,000) is the capital of the province<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dakaleeyah</span>. There is railway communication by Zagazig with Cairo or Suez. From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tallaah</span>, on the opposite side<br/>
of the Nile, are lines to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>and Damietta. The town of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mansoorah </span>has no <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins</span>, and is only of Arab creation.<br/>

the Crusaders encamped in that abortive expedition is shown,<br/>

<br/>
Damietta (in Arabic, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dimiah</span>) is a town of 30,000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">inhabitants</span>, standing at the mouth of that branch of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile<br/>
</span>which <span style="color: #ff0000;">bears </span>its name. There is a Coptic bishop resident<br/>
here, and some foreign consuls. It was long the principal<br/>
emporium of the Egyptian commerce with Greece and Syria,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>as Alexandria rose Damietta fell. It is still, however,<br/>
the centre of considerable commerce. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span>the interior <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
