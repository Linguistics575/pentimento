boundary of Dongola. The first portion, for about seventy<br/>
miles, is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">1hrsidy-el-Kuruiz</span>, then follows the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ubah<br/>
</span>to the Second Cataract. In this part of the valley the<br/>
average width is about a quarter of a mile. A glaring reddish desert, studded with black, pointed rocks, and with<br/>
narrow strips of green and palm trees by the side, make up<br/>
scenery which is more beautiful and diversified than in<br/>
Egypt. The climate is even more perfect than north of<br/>
Assouan.<br/>
<br/>
The inhabitants are a handsome mulatto race, of dark<br/>
brown complexion, bold, frank, and cheerful. In manners<br/>
they are more simple and less corrupt than their neighbours<br/>
in the Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">portipn </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>Valley; they are in great<br/>
request as porters and domestic servants in the cities of<br/>
Egypt. The population of the whole country does not probably exceed <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50,000</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The inhabitants are very poor, the date palm is their<br/>
great resource<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>they irrigate their land with <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakias</span>, whose<br/>
creaking is ceaselessly heard throughout <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubia</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the castoroil plant is largely grown, and rudely extracted-with this<br/>
oil the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ubians </span>lubricate their skins and saturate their hair.<br/>
Education of a limited character is said to be more widely<br/>
diffused amongst the poorer classes than in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The district south of Egypt is in the Bible spoken of as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cash</span>, a term frequently translated as Ethiopia in our version.<br/>
The natives were evidently black, as Jeremiah (xiii. <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span>) asks<br/>
"Can the Ethiopian change his skin?" Isaiah (xlv. r4)<br/>
speaks of the inhabitants as "men of stature." From the<br/>
first verse of the twelfth chapter of Numbers we find that the<br/>
marriage of Moses with a Cushite woman was the occasion<br/>
of murmuring on the part of Aaron and Miriam. In Psalm<br/>
lxviii. 31, Isaiah xviii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">So</span>, Jeremiah xlvi. 9, xliii. 3, are other<br/>
references to this district or its inhabitants.<br/>
