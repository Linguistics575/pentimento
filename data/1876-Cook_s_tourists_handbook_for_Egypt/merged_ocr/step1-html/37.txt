<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>INTRODUCTORY.<br/>
<br/>
Close by are the Priests' Tombs, the largest of which may be<br/>
visited by those who are not easily frightened by bats and rather<br/>
rough and dangerous passages.<br/>
<br/>
After making a second stay at the Memnonium, the return<br/>
to Luxor is effected. If still early, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">walk </span>through Luxor and<br/>
an exploration of the Temple, mostly hidden by Arab dwellings<br/>
and stables, will finish the day.<br/>
<br/>
ELEVENTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
At Luxor. The day will be entirely devoted to Karnak.<br/>
Lunch may be taken out, or passengers may return on board to<br/>
that meal, the Temple being only about a mile and a half distant. All around Thebes visitors are continually pursued by<br/>
dealers <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquities</span>, mostly poor imitations; and the Consuls<br/>
themselves, who all deal in these articles, are not much better<br/>
than the rest. Be careful not to offer more than a shilling <span style="color: #0000FF;">for</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>an<br/>
object for which <span style="color: #0000FF;">2 </span>I is asked, for you may be sure to get <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>TWELFTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Starting early from Luxor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>is reached at about <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">am.</span>,<br/>
and after visiting its Temple the journey is continued up stream,<br/>
arriving the same evening at Edfou.<br/>
<br/>
THIRTEENTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
The splendid Temple of Edfou, the most complete and best<br/>
preserved monument in Egypt, and giving the best idea of the<br/>
early Egyptian architecture, is kept in custody by a government<br/>
officer, and is the only place where beggars are not allowed to<br/>
bother you for backsheesh; but they are the more ravenous<br/>
when you emerge again from the stronghold. Half a day is<br/>
devoted to this place, and it can be visited either now or on<br/>
returning; this must depend entirely on the time of arrival. If<br/>
the visit is postponed, and the steamer leaves in the morning<br/>
early, the quarries of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel-el-Silsileh </span>come in view after about<br/>
five hours' sail. It is hardly worth while to go ashore, since the<br/>
few grottoes and chapels can just as well be seen from aboard<span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
