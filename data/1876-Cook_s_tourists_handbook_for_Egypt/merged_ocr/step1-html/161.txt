<span>142 THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
Ibrahim Pasha destroyed the villages of Beni-Hassan to cure<br/>
the inhabitants of stealing, but it seems they are still <span style="color: #0000FF;">incorrigible</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Rock Tombs of Beni-Hassan, about half an hour's<br/>
ride from the river, are justly celebrated for the light they<br/>
shed on the manners and customs of ancient Egypt. They<br/>
are excavated in the rocks above the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>Valley, are exceedingly ancient, and from the resemblance in the style of their<br/>
porticoes to the Grecian Doric, are unique in Egypt. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Northern </span>tombs are the most interesting. The interior is<br/>
marked by elegant simplicity of architecture, a low wood<br/>
ceiling is supported by a central avenue of Doric columns.<br/>
Sir Gardner Wilkinson suggests that they were copied<br/>
from the stone arches of yet earlier constructions. This,<br/>
however, is reversing the general idea of the cavern suggesting the arched roof.<br/>
<br/>
The inside walls of these tombs are covered with well<br/>
preserved coloured pictures in inexhaustible variety, representing the daily life of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">four </span>thousand years ago. The most<br/>
northern tomb is that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Am√©ni-Amenemha</span>, the next is that<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oom-hotep</span>, both governors of the province of Sah. In<br/>
the latter tomb is a picture that was thought might represent the arrival of Joseph's brethren, and attempts have<br/>
been made to identify Noom-hotep with the patriarch<br/>
Joseph. But there is evidence that the tombs were excavated long before his time under the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osirtasens </span>of the<br/>
twelfth dynasty.<br/>
<br/>
"The famous grottoes of Beni-Hassan,<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>says Hopley,<br/>
"are a terrace of tombs high on the shelving Arabian ridge,<br/>
overlooking a two miles' breadth of fertile land between<br/>
mountain and river. In these, as in some vast <span style="color: #ff0000;">gallery-hall </span>after hall painted in graphic wall picturings, and glowing in yet unfaded tints-you may wander at will and <span style="color: #0000FF;">study<br/>
<br/>
