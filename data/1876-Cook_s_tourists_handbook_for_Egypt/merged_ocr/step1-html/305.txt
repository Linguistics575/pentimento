<span>284 THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
capital of Edom. The traveller will, of course, be reminded<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">text-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Who </span>is he that cometh from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edom</span>, with<br/>
dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his<br/>
apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength?" (Isa.<br/>
lxiii. r). A strong fort, protecting a cluster of miserable<br/>
huts, is all that is to be seen. There are no ancient remains.<br/>
<br/>
Bozrah is first mentioned in Gen. xxxvi. 33, as the birthplace of Jobab, the son of Zerah, one of the kings "that<br/>
reigned in the land of Edom before <span style="color: #ff0000;">there </span>reigned any king<br/>
over the land of Israel." (See also I Chron. i. 44.) Besides<br/>
the prophecy previously quoted, Bozrah is also mentioned in<br/>
Isa. xxxiv. <span style="color: #ff0000;">tr</span>--" The Lord hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a<br/>
great slaughter in the land of I <span style="color: #ff0000;">dumea</span>." Jeremiah declares<br/>
(xlix. <span style="color: #0000FF;">13</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>-" Bozrah shall become a desolation, a wasting,<br/>
a reproach, and a curse." (See also verse <span style="color: #ff0000;">22</span>.) The message<br/>
in Amos i. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IT </span>is, "I will send a fire upon Teman, which<br/>
shall devour the palaces of Bozrah." "The sheep of<br/>
Bozrah "are incidentally mentioned in Micah <span style="color: #0000FF;">ii</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'rur11eh </span>is three hours farther north. It stands on the<br/>
mountain side above the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tufileh</span>, into which its<br/>
numerous fountains flow, and unitedly run down to the<br/>
Jordan valley. The village is large for these parts, as it<br/>
contains about 600 houses, and its sheikh is nominal chief<br/>
of the district of Jebel. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tufileh </span>is the site of Tophel<br/>
(Deut i. s).<br/>
<br/>
Kerak, or Kir Moab, has a population of about<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>3000. It is twelve hours' journey from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tufileh</span>. Some<br/>
unimportant villages are passed on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">way/Aimeh</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khanzireh</span>,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Orak</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ketherabba</span>, etc. Kerak has a very bad repute<br/>
amongst travellers<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Burckhardt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tristram</span>, and others have<br/>
been shamefully plundered at this place. The inhabitants<br/>
are fanatical and extortionate.<br/>
