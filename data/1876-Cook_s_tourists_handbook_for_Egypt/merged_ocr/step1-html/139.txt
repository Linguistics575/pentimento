<span>I <span style="color: #ff0000;">22 </span>EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive </span>and the ladies of his harem, down to the<br/>
equivalent of a costermonger's cart<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and every style of<br/>
person, from the ministers of state to the poorest fellah;<br/>
and every description of "mount," from the pure blood Arab<br/>
to the most jaded of <span style="color: #ff0000;">sore-backed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">donkeys </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>and every variety<br/>
of costume, from the costly embroideries of Damascus to<br/>
the simplest <span style="color: #0000FF;">calico </span>fold around the waist, are to be seen<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
The palace of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoobra </span>has nothing particular to distinguish<br/>
it from other Oriental palaces, but the gardens are very pretty,<br/>
orange, lemon, Citron, and pepper trees abound, and among<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowers </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours </span>are intoxicating and the colours<br/>
dazzling. But the chief attraction is the Summer Palace,<br/>
having in the centre a large open basin<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>quite a miniature<br/>
lake, surrounded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">covered </span>corridor of Carrara marble<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">la<br/>
</span>the midst of the lake is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>marble island, supported on the<br/>
backs of crocodiles. Everywhere there are elegant lounges<br/>
spread abroad, and everywhere fountains are sending forth<br/>
their plashing waters. Coming from the glare and heat of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>sun into the midst of <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">paradise </span>of waters is like<br/>
realizing a fairy tale. In the four corners of the corridors<br/>
are divans elegantly fitted up with costly furniture and<br/>
massive curtains and hangings, the Turkish and European<br/>
styles being blended with considerable effect. The drawingroom is gold and white satin; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">1adielroom </span>green satin<br/>
and velvet; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">billiard-room </span>is a study on account of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">elegance </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>its details, every cue being of wood inlaid <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>costly materials, and of a curious device.<br/>
<br/>
HELIOPOLIS.<br/>
<br/>
From Cairo to the site of Heliopolis is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">five..miles</span>' drive,<br/>
for the most part shaded by plane trees and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores</span>, and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
