<br/>
TOUR TO THE GREAT DESERT AND<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">PALESTI </span>N E'<br/>
<br/>
The general route is from Egypt <span style="color: #ff0000;">tolSinai</span>, Petra, Mount <span style="color: #0000FF;">Her</span>,<br/>
and Palestine.<br/>
<br/>
Forty days are required for the journey from Cairo to Sinai,<br/>
Petra, and by Mount <span style="color: #0000FF;">Her</span>, to Hebron and Jerusalem. Without<br/>
attempting here to mark out the various routes that may be taken,<br/>
or to <span style="color: #0000FF;">define </span>exact itineraries, it may be said generally and briefly<br/>
that all necessary camp equipments for Tours through the desert<br/>
can be supplied; and in every engagement of this kind none but<br/>
the most trustworthy dragomans will be employed, who will<br/>
do justice to the travellers as well as to the firm of COOK and<br/>
SON. A graduated scale of charges according to the number<br/>
of party is adopted, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">engagements </span>can be made for Desert<br/>
travelling at nearly as cheap a rate as for Palestine. But the<br/>
details and conditions of such tours are best settled by private<br/>
negotiation (p. 9).<br/>
<br/>
Having shown how to reach Egypt, it will be useful for the<br/>
traveller to have placed before him an itinerary of the Nile<br/>
Journey. Before doing so, however, it will be well to call his<br/>
attention to the two modes of making the Nile trip, and we quote<br/>
the following comparison between the relative advantages of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">STEAMBOAT </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">versus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">DAHABEAH</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">published </span>in All the World Over.<br/>
<br/>
DAHABEAH. <span style="color: #0000FF;">STEAMER</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Much of the scenery is unquestion- You <span style="color: #0000FF;">go </span>on' at a uniform <span style="color: #0000FF;">rate</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">indeably </span>very tame. But the slow pendently of wind or stream.<br/>
progress and the frequent long<br/>
waitings for wind must be borne,<br/>
be the scenery never so <span style="color: #0000FF;">tmin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">teresting</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>If becalmed, there you must stay, You never are <span style="color: #0000FF;">becalmed</span>, and you<br/>
unless you would encourage don't encourage slavery.<br/>
