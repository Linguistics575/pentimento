<br/>
weather is often experienced here. The tourist may perhaps<br/>
see his first crocodile on the mud-banks below the cliffs.<br/>
<br/>
Passing El <span style="color: #ff0000;">HareU </span>(E.), with its ancient repositories of<br/>
dog and cat mummies, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koosayah</span>, site of ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chusis</span>,<br/>
the City of the Sacred Cow, <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbolizing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Egyptian Venus,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dayr-el-Bakkara </span>(E.), and various raids, the cool green<br/>
reaches of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Manfaloot </span>are entered. The first sight of the<br/>
town is very pleasing. A sudden bend of the river brings<br/>
into full view its fretted domes and crested minarets, palm<br/>
trees and mingled mass of buildings. Picturesque terraces<br/>
and gardens line the water-side Part of the town has<br/>
been washed away by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, but measures have been<br/>
recently taken to prevent further damage. It is the capital<br/>
of a province and residence of a governor, and contains a<br/>
public bath and bazaar, and numerous mosques. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>Sundays a market is held here.<br/>
<br/>
On the opposite side of the N ile, at the top of the rocks<br/>
of the Gebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aboufaydah</span>, are the celebrated Crocodile<br/>
Mummy Pits of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maabdeh</span>. These reptiles were here in<br/>
thousands. Much difficulty and some danger has been experienced in visiting these caverns. Caution is requisite in<br/>
visiting them, as some lives have been lost by suffocation in<br/>
these caverns, and there is not now anything to be seen to<br/>
repay for a long and toilsome journey.<br/>
<br/>
Beni Ali (W.) is the starting-point of the desert track<br/>
to the oasis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dékhleh</span>. Near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Boon </span>(E.) are some<br/>
painted grottoes, a Roman fortress, and a Convent of Maria<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Boktee</span>, dating from the time of Diocletian. Steaming along<br/>
the now winding river, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mungabat </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mankabsit</span>, "place of<br/>
pots," is passed, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot </span>is reached, 250 miles from Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot</span>, the Coptic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siéout</span>, is the successor of the ancient<br/>
Lycopolis, City of Wolves, a place devoted to the worship of<br/>
those animals, of which only a few mounds and buried<br/>
