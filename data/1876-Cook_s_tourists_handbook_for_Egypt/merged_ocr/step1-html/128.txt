<br/>
distinctly, as far as the eye can reach, as the coast line of<br/>
Devon and Cornwall can be traced by anyone who stands<br/>
on the Eddystone lighthouse. Along the line of this sea of<br/>
sand, stretching into the far distance, a number of minor<br/>
Pyramids are seen, past Old Cairo, and the site of Heliopolis,<br/>
the' city of the sun,' the city called On in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sth </span>verse of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">4Ist </span>chapter of Genesis. Yonder stands <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>Cairo,<br/>
with its domes and minarets, and veiled and turbaned <span style="color: #0000FF;">population </span>of 121,000 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahomedans </span>and 60,000 Copts, the representatives of ancient Egyptian Christianity. There sweeps<br/>
the broad, majestic old <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, that the ancient and idolatrous<br/>
people of this land worshipped as a god. And can we wonder that they worshipped the river<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>for did it not periodically<br/>
spread its fructifying arms, and fill their valleys with <span style="color: #0000FF;">abundance</span>, so that their country became the granary of the world,<br/>
and, in the darkness of their idolatry and superstition, they<br/>
could not look <span style="color: #0000FF;">from</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>nature up to nature's God<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l </span>Visions<br/>
of ages pass before the mind's eye; cities flourish and<br/>
decay, palaces, <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>, temples, towers, and tombs alike<br/>
crumble into dust. Mighty kings and rulers, and great men<br/>
whose praise fame sounded with her loudest <span style="color: #0000FF;">blast</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>but the<br/>
echoes have died away into silence, and old Time with faded<br/>
memory has forgotten their names-they too pass before us.<br/>
Another vision rises before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mind-a </span>band of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ishmaelitish </span>traders, with their long line of' camels bearing spices,<br/>
balm, and myrrh,' come into the land, and, exchanging their<br/>
spices for corn, they return, leaving a young man <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>a slave<br/>
behind <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>and then a procession passes along of ten young<br/>
men, not with camels, but with asses<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>they return, and come<br/>
again with their families, carrying a silvery-haired patriarch<br/>
in their midst, and they settle down in that fruitful valley<br/>
near to that palace on our right, and within sight of this<br/>
Pyramid. And now a dense population grows up, a mixture<br/>
