<span>SELAH. 275<br/>
<br/>
surrounding country is full of chambers in the rocks, still<br/>
used as dwellings in the winter by the Bedouin.<br/>
<br/>
The city of Sela was taken by Amaziah, and its name<br/>
changed by him to Joktheel, "God-subdued." According<br/>
to the record (2 Kings xiv. 7, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">B </span>Chron. xxv. <span style="color: #ff0000;">sr-ss</span>)<br/>
ten thousand Edomites were slain in the battle, and ten<br/>
thousand more were hurled down from the rocks above their<br/>
city.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the fourth century before the Christian<br/>
era, Sela was the head-quarters of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nabotheans</span>, who<br/>
successfully resisted the attacks of Antigonus. About<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">70 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0. </span>the Arab princes named Aretas are found residing at<br/>
Petra. It was reduced into subjection to the Roman Empire<br/>
by Trajan. As the Romans gradually opened out direct<br/>
communication from Suez to the East, the importance of<br/>
Petra as a trading station declined. In the sixth century<br/>
this city disappears from history. For <span style="color: #0000FF;">moo </span>years its very<br/>
site was unknown, till Burckhardt entered the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dy </span>Moosa<br/>
in 1815.<br/>
<br/>
"This is the ancient Selah of Scripture,<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>says a recent<br/>
writer, "the famous rock city of Edom. It is now silent<br/>
as the tomb, except as the Bedouin now and then pitch their<br/>
tents in the desolate valleys, or retreat in the winter to the<br/>
rock-chambers for shelter. The elements are gradually<br/>
wearing away this soft sandstone, and effacing many of these<br/>
sculptured forms of beauty<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">This </span>silent city of rock,<br/>
standing entrenched in these mountain fortresses, and, approached through this narrow, wonderful cleft, has no<br/>
parallel on earth. Here <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edom </span>in boastful security lifted up<br/>
her head against God, and persecuted His chosen people.<br/>
It seemed as if no human power could reach her there. But<br/>
the prophecy of Jeremiah is fulfilled (chap. xlix. 16),'Thy<br/>
terribleness has deceived thee, and the pride of thy heart,<br/>
<br/>
