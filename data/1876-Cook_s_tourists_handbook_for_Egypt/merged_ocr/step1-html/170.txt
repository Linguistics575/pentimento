<span style="color: #ff0000;">.The </span>Temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>Sethi, called by Strabo the Memnonium, and so celebrated for its magnificent decoration, was<br/>
built by Sethi I., father of Rameses II. As in all the work<br/>
undertaken by order of Sethi, the art displayed wins universal admiration, unlike the sculptures of the reign of<br/>
Rameses, which are not first-rate, and indeed are often negligently executed.<br/>
<br/>
"The bas-reliefs are the most beautiful in Egypt," says<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Viscountess </span>Strangford <span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>"indeed, there is nothing equal to<br/>
them in Egyptian art, except the paintings in the tomb of<br/>
this same King Sethi at Thebes. In earlier periods art was<br/>
far more <span style="color: #0000FF;">naturalistic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">J </span>but what we may call Egyptian art<br/>
proper was, in the reign of Sethi, the most perfect of all. It<br/>
is beautiful, vivid, and highly picturesque, although completely subject to the arbitrary rules imposed by the priests<br/>
on the artists, in accordance with the elaborate theocratic<br/>
system of government that extended through all the minutiae<br/>
of life."<br/>
<br/>
This temple was dedicated to seven gods, and has seven<br/>
vaulted naves lying east and west, ending in seven sanctuaries, and communicating with two immense halls running<br/>
north and south. There are also some other smaller<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Everywhere </span>are highly-finished sculptures and<br/>
hieroglyphics.<br/>
<br/>
The roof of this temple is the only one of its kind in<br/>
Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Immense stones were laid, not on their faces, but<br/>
on their sides, across from one architrave to the other; then<br/>
an arch was cut through this mass of stone, and adorned<br/>
with hieroglyphics and sculptures.<br/>
<br/>
M. Mariette, by whose recent excavations these wonderful buildings have been largely brought to light from the<br/>
sand which enveloped them, points out that from the presence everywhere of Sethi and Rameses together in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
