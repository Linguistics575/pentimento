<span style="color: #ff0000;">siastics</span>. Having climbed up about 120 feet we emerged,<br/>
in a fine perspiration, upon a narrow ledge of the rock in<br/>
front of the precipice, which had an unpleasant slope towards<br/>
the Nile." Hence, after some more climbing and scrambling<br/>
the summit was gained.<br/>
<br/>
The Convent is of great antiquity, originally of Roman<br/>
workmanship in the time of the Empress Helena, to<br/>
whom the erection of the church is ascribed. This church,<br/>
says Curzon, "is half a <span style="color: #0000FF;">catacomb </span>or cave, and one of the<br/>
earliest Christian buildings which has preserved its originality." It is in the form of a Latin Basilica. From the<br/>
terrace on the roof there are extensive views of a very<br/>
striking character.'<br/>
<br/>
Continuing the Nile journey some remains of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gisr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Agaos </span>are seen a few miles beyond the Convent. This<br/>
wall was probably a similar construction to the Picts' Wall<br/>
between England and Scotland, built to prevent the incursions of wild <span style="color: #0000FF;">tribes </span>into the cultivated region. Diodorus<br/>
says that Sesostris built such a wall from Pelusium to<br/>
Heliopolis. Several portions of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gisr-el-Agoos </span>are seen<br/>
at different points of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>at one place the Arab<br/>
tradition runs, that it was built by an Egyptian Queen to<br/>
guard her son from the crocodiles.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Te'hneh </span>(E.), and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tdha </span>(W.), and numerous mounds,<br/>
grottoes, and other remains of ancient towns, etc., are<br/>
passed rapidly by, and then Minieh is reached, 156 miles<br/>
from Cairo. This is the capital of an extensive province;<br/>
there are post and telegraph offices, and a Sunday market.<br/>
"It is considered decidedly the prettiest looking town on the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>," says Bartlett, "there is an old white tomb under a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sycamore </span>at one end of the place, and the range of buildings<br/>
along the water interspersed with date-groves, has a very<br/>
pleasing effect<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>many of the edifices are large, respectable,<br/>
