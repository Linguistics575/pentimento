<br/>
is really the case. It is probably an unfinished Pyramid,<br/>
commenced by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senefroo</span>, the monarch who preceded Cheops,<br/>
and shows great regularity and even beauty of <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction</span>, so far as the work has gone. Adjacent to this Pyramid<br/>
is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis </span>of the same high antiquity. In one of the<br/>
tombs were discovered, in 1872, the two beautiful statues<br/>
exhibited <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the Salle des Bijoux at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boul√©k </span>Museum.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">scenery </span>through which the steamer is now passing<br/>
is very pleasing-an agreeable mingling of verdant crops and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-groves</span>. Water-fowl are abundant <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the sand-bank.<br/>
"The scenery is simple and grand," says the author of<br/>
Under Egyptian Palms. <span style="color: #ff0000;">_</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>Each day <span style="color: #0000FF;">unrolls </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">you </span>a panorama of wide, waving fields, green with <span style="color: #0000FF;">corn</span>, and maize,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sugar-cane</span>, rich and golden with the yellow-blossoming<br/>
cotton, tobacco, and lupin, and wooded with mimosa and<br/>
date-a broad belt of verdure, where, like to islands in a<br/>
sunny sea, little clustering villages uprise, clear of the<br/>
summer <span style="color: #0000FF;">inundations</span>, and mosques sheltered with thickets<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>a pastoral country where the sound of murmuring<br/>
water comes to you at every turn, and creaking, <span style="color: #0000FF;">oxen-turned<br/>
</span>sakies are hidden under ever-spreading <span style="color: #0000FF;">sycamores</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>where,<br/>
in open meadow or thick wood shade by the water's edge,<br/>
half-naked men and women halt in their lazy working, and<br/>
stare at you; and, lastly, where, on either bank of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">calm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flowing </span>river, colossal ruins and silent cities of the dead<br/>
confront you with memories of a lost empire, and solemn<br/>
temples here and there are mirrored in the stream."<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Atfeeyah </span>(E.) is near the site of ancient Aphroditopolis,<br/>
or city of Athor, the Venus of Egypt. There are no<br/>
remains, only mounds tell of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">long-perished </span>city.<br/>
