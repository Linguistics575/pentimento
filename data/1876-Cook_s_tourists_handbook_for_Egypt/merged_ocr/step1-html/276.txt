<span>REPHIDIM. 255<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">wi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>dy Mukatteb, or "Written Valley," is reached by<br/>
continuing along the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seih </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sidreh </span>from the point where the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span>Igne joins it. The cliffs are in terraces, and on the<br/>
lower sandstone strata are clusters of inscriptions once <span style="color: #0000FF;">supposed </span>to be of high antiquity, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>now acknowledged to<br/>
have been made by pilgrims and hermits in the fourth century or later. A fine view is obtained on reaching the watershed of this valley. Hence the <span style="color: #0000FF;">road </span>descends to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wddy<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Feiriin</span>, and rejoins the route of the Israelites. At the mouth<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nisreen</span>, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">cairns </span>in which human bones and<br/>
various ornaments, etc., have been discovered. All through<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Feirén </span>the scenery is wild and striking<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
forms of the rocks often singularly grotesque. "<span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>is as if<br/>
nature, after finishing the construction of the habitable world<br/>
had piled the unused material on this Sinaitic peninsula,<br/>
and had then left wind and water to play their wildest<br/>
pranks <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>making chaos."<br/>
<br/>
Ascending the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span>Feiran, the spot said by the Arabs<br/>
to be the site of Rephidim where Moses smote the rock,<br/>
is reached. It is called by the Arabs <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hesy-el- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">kiLaic2</span>',<br/>
and its claim to be Rephidim is upheld by many. The<br/>
weary people would be marching up the broad valley, con.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fidently </span>expecting abundant water at the fountains of F <span style="color: #ff0000;">eirén<br/>
</span>just before them. But the Amalekites occupy that position,<br/>
and bar the passage. A supply of water is miraculously<br/>
supplied, and then the enemy is attacked, defeated, and<br/>
driven from the valley. Israel then advances to the oasis,<br/>
and encamps.<br/>
<br/>
At the Oasis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Feiriin</span>, mighty <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliffs</span>, rising to the<br/>
height of a thousand or fifteen hundred feet, look down on<br/>
the broad valley that for several miles IS filled with groves of<br/>
palm and tamarisk and apple trees, with small plots of wheat<br/>
and barley. The source of all this life <span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span>. beauty is the<br/>
<br/>
