picturesque and amusing city on the Upper N ile." It stands<br/>
on mounds, the accumulated heaps of the ancient city of<br/>
Latopolis. Any person wishing to purchase an Egyptian<br/>
donkey should remember that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>is the best place on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">river </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>which to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>is the palace built by Mahomed Ali, <span style="color: #0000FF;">standing </span>in beautiful grounds. That prince, when staying here<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1842</span>, had the portico of the Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>in the<br/>
middle of the town cleared from the rubbish, etc., which<br/>
enveloped it. It is said that the remainder of the temple<br/>
still exists under the adjacent houses. The portico, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>entrance-hall, which is the only portion visible, contains<br/>
twenty-four columns, nineteen feet in circumference and<br/>
sixty-five feet high, the capitals being imitations of the<br/>
doom-palm, vine, papyrus, etc. There is some reason for<br/>
believing that the inner temple, not yet explored, dates from<br/>
the time of Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, but the facade and columns of<br/>
this portico are of the Roman epoch. Several cartouches of<br/>
the Caesars are seen-Claudius, Domitian, Commodus, Caracalla, etc. The sculptures in relief representing princes<br/>
making offerings to the deities, and the hieroglyphics', are<br/>
very poorly executed-in these arts Egypt rapidly declined<br/>
under Greek and Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence</span>. The columns and<br/>
capitals are very graceful-for in architecture, which was<br/>
less trammelled by traditional conventionalities and priestly<br/>
rules, Greek grace and freedom asserted its supremacy.<br/>
<br/>
Above <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>, game on the river becomes increasingly<br/>
plentiful-Pelican<span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>abound. The sandstone region is soon<br/>
entered, and the appearance of the hills totally changes.<br/>
They slope away from the banks, leaving the sides and<br/>
bases covered with immense boulders. The strip of habitable country becomes narrower, and cultivation becomes more<br/>
arduous and precarious.<br/>
