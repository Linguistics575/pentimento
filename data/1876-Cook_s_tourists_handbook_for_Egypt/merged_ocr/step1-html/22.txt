mended; beef is seldom so good as mutton. The fish of the<br/>
N ile are very poor, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bultih </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">chisker </span>are the best.<br/>
Healthy persons can sometimes bathe in the Nile morning<br/>
or evening; crocodiles below <span style="color: #ff0000;">Manfaloot </span>being never to be feared,<br/>
and further on only near sand-banks. The vapour bath, which<br/>
is to be had almost in every town, leaves a most delightful sensation, but one must be careful of draughts, and dress accordingly, especially in winter, after enjoying it.<br/>
<br/>
ILLNESS is very little known in Egypt. The dry air, and<br/>
mild winter, which is like a fine German spring, are peculiarly<br/>
favourable to persons suffering from weakness of the lungs.<br/>
At midnight it is very cold, and one must arrange accordingly.<br/>
Fever seldom appears, except in Alexandria, and other places<br/>
on the coast of the Delta. Dyspepsia, diarrhoea, and dysentery<br/>
are the only illnesses to which strangers are subject.<br/>
<br/>
The most simple remedy for the first of these maladies is to<br/>
drink a glass of <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>water fasting. If this produces no relief,<br/>
abstain from red wine at dinner. In obstinate cases take Epsom<br/>
salts, which may be had at the apothecaries' shops in Alexandria<br/>
and Cairo, under the name <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofsale </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">amaraf<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">DIARRHQEA </span>may sometimes be guarded against by keeping<br/>
the abdomen warm; the usual remedies applied at home may<br/>
be resorted to here; concentrated tincture of camphor, arrowroot, rice-water, etc., may be taken, while fruit, meat, and all<br/>
fatty substances should be abstained from.<br/>
<br/>
HEADACHE is generally the result of exposure to the glaring<br/>
sun. A warm bath, and then cold compresses, are the best<br/>
remedies. It is always well in the East to protect the neck and<br/>
head with a good broad-brimmed hat, and flowing <span style="color: #ff0000;">puggerie</span>, as<br/>
sunstrokes are not uncommon.<br/>
<br/>
OPHTHALMIA is exceedingly prevalent in Egypt. Some<br/>
consider that it is produced by the fine dust-sand <span style="color: #0000FF;">waited </span>from<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>European physicians may be found in Alexandria and Cairo, and on<br/>
board <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile steamers. According to a recent decision of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive</span>,<br/>
European physicians belonging to the sanitary staff accompany each<br/>
passenger ship.<br/>
