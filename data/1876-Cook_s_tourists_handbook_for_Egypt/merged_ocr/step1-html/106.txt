</span>"The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbékyeh </span>may stand for the Champs Elysées. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Towards </span>two o'clock, when the heat begins to diminish, one<br/>
hears in Cairo a vague sound, joyful as the warbling or chirping of birds at morn. The siesta is <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished</span>, the town is<br/>
rousing itself; the European and Arab orchestras instal themselves in the cafés of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekeeyah</span>, and the crowd responds<br/>
to their summons. All nationalities gather together, and<br/>
mingle or group themselves in the various cafés..<br/>
In the variegated crowd are seen the antiquity-merchants,<br/>
with articles from Syria or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Soudan</span>, circulating amongst the<br/>
groups till night, and puffing their <span style="color: #ff0000;">wares </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>the snake..<br/>
