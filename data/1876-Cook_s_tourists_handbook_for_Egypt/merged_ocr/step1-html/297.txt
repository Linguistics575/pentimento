<span>276 THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
O thou that <span style="color: #ff0000;">dwellest </span>in the cleft of the rock, that <span style="color: #0000FF;">boldest<br/>
</span>the height of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hill</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>though thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">shouldest </span>make thy nest<br/>
as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence,<br/>
saith the Lord. Also Edom shall be a desolation, every one<br/>
that goeth by it shall be astonished;... no man shall abide<br/>
there, neither shall a son of man dwell in it.' "<br/>
<br/>
From the hostility of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bedouins</span>, who imagine that<br/>
death and misfortune are <span style="color: #0000FF;">foreboded </span>by the entry of strangers<br/>
into this city, many travellers have failed in attempting to<br/>
visit Petra. A fee of fifty dollars for each person is <span style="color: #0000FF;">demanded </span>by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sheikhs </span>of the district. Even after this and<br/>
other precautions have been duly observed, visitors to Petra<br/>
have been insulted and robbed.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Petra, and crossing the plains of Aaron, the path<br/>
is still amongst sculptured tombs and caves.<br/>
<br/>
At the foot of Mount Hor, or Jebel Haroun, the<br/>
camels, etc., are left, and a rugged ascent conducts in about<br/>
an hour to the highest of the two summits, which is about<br/>
4300 feet above the sea. It is crowned by a mosque, partly<br/>
built with the remains of a more ancient structure. In the<br/>
columned room which forms the interior is a simple <span style="color: #0000FF;">cenotaph</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>with ostrich eggs hung over it. Beneath are steps leading to a<br/>
small <span style="color: #0000FF;">room</span>, which is regarded as the true tomb of Aaron.<br/>
Without vouching for the identity of the grave, this mountain top is probably the very spot where Moses, Aaron, and<br/>
Eleazer stood, and the first Hebrew High Priest died,<br/>
<br/>
The view is very grand. To the west lies the great plain<br/>
of the'Arabah, and beyond it the mountains of the wilder..<br/>
ness of Tih. On the north the'Arabah valley stretches to<br/>
the Dead Sea, which, with its peninsula and the mountains<br/>
of Judaea, is in <span style="color: #0000FF;">full </span>sight. The mountains of Edom lie to<br/>
the east and south. This spot is one of the most undoubted<br/>
localities of sacred history, and the mountain stands as an<br/>
<br/>
