<span>KANTARAH TO GAZA.. 28 I<br/>
<br/>
David was approaching Carmel from the wilderness of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pawn</span>, the region near the Dead Sea, where he had protected<br/>
Nabal's flocks from the raids of the Bedouins, when Abigail<br/>
met him and appeased his anger. Such was, doubtless, the<br/>
chief work of David and his band <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the long period of<br/>
his persecution by Saul; he defended the frontier shepherds<br/>
and husbandmen of Israel from the marauding, devastating<br/>
Bedouins, who then, as now, by swift incursions swept off<br/>
the harvests and herds."<br/>
<br/>
After winding along a succession of rocky but not sterile<br/>
hills, suddenly, from an elevation, the minarets of Hebron<br/>
and the beautiful adjacent valley come into view. For miles<br/>
above and below the city stretches the Valley of Eshcol,<br/>
with its fig and olive orchards, vineyards and <span style="color: #0000FF;">corn-fields</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>bright hues of luxurious vegetation enhanced by contrast with the bare rocky hills surrounding the Valley.<br/>

CAIRO TO SYRIA, BY THE SHORT DESERT<br/>
ROUTE.<br/>
<br/>
(Kantarah to Gaza, 148 miles.)<br/>
<br/>
This was at one time a favourite route between Egypt<br/>
and Syria, as being shorter and easier than the route by<br/>
Sinai<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but few travellers now make use of it. If any now<br/>
prefer this <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey </span>to the steamboat voyage between Alexandria<br/>
or Port Said and Jaffa, there is still no need to commence<br/>
the desert journey at Cairo, Kantarah (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">227</span>) can be readily<br/>
reached by railway and canal, and then the camels used<br/>
from that place forward.<br/>
