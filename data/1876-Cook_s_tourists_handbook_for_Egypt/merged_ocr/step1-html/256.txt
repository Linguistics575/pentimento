<br/>
grass clothes the surface of the ground. There are many<br/>
springs, perennial but warm, and in some cases sulphurous, in<br/>
this Oasis.<br/>
<br/>
The chief ruins are about seven miles from the capital,<br/>
El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khérgeh</span>, and are rendered picturesque by their surroundings of wood and water. Scattered remains of broken<br/>
columns, once forming an avenue, lead up to the Great<br/>
Temple, dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aman-ra</span>. Hieroglyphics and colossal<br/>
figures profusely adorn the <span style="color: #0000FF;">facades </span>a doorway, with fine<br/>
sculptures, leads to the grand columned hall, sixty feet by fiftyfour feet; the Adytum and other usual chambers are richly<br/>
decorated with carvings.<br/>
<br/>
There are three interesting gateways near by. On one<br/>
Darius is shown adoring <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amun-ra</span>, Osiris, and Isis; on<br/>
another an edict of Galba is inscribed. There are about two<br/>
hundred tombs in the adjacent necropolis of very obscure<br/>
origin, Christian and Egyptian symbols are both plentiful.<br/>
<br/>
The inhabitants of the Cases are very bigoted <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahomedans</span>; amongst them are found the fanatical sect who<br/>
wish to roll back the tide of progress, abolish all the<br/>
Frankish ideas and customs, which have lately gained ground<br/>
in Egypt, and make Islam once more an intolerant foe to<br/>
every belief except its own.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoobra</span>, etc., are passed, and the head of the Delta reached<br/>
sixteen miles from Cairo.<br/>
