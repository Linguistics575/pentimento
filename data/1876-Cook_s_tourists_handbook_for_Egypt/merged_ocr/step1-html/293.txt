<span>272 THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
terraces, now mostly broken, and ruins of ancient aqueducts<br/>
and edifices are seen.<br/>
<br/>
The Sik, or Cleft, which forms the entrance to Petra, is<br/>
reached somewhat suddenly. It is a narrow ravine, with<br/>
rocks of red sandstone, from one hundred to three hundred<br/>
feet in height, rising perpendicularly on each side. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Anarrow<br/>
</span>line <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sky </span>is mostly seen between, but at places the passage is<br/>
completely overarched. The Arab tradition asserts that this<br/>
was the cleft caused by the stroke of Moses' rod when the<br/>
Israelites were miraculously supplied at Kadesh.<br/>
<br/>
Dean Stanley identifies Petra with Kadesh <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barnea</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Near the entrance to the Sik are two temples with large<br/>
chambers, excavated in the solid rock, and ornamented with<br/>
columns and pyramidal towers. Chambers variously adorned<br/>
fill the rocks on either side the valley. Several immense<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">monoliths </span>in the form of sarcophagi, evidently intended for<br/>
tombs, are carved out of the rock, and adorned with cornices<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">bas-reliefs..<br/>
<br/>
</span>Entering the Sik, the traveller soon passes under a <span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful </span>Roman arch, <span style="color: #ff0000;">7 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>feet in height, which formerly supported an aqueduct. Yew trees and creeping <span style="color: #0000FF;">vines </span>in<br/>
festoons clothe the recesses of the rocks. Along the cleft<br/>
flows a stream, and here and there fragments of the old<br/>
Roman <span style="color: #0000FF;">toad </span>are perceptible. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Niches</span>, once filled with<br/>
statues, are seen on either side; and whenever a widening<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Stk </span>gives space, ruins of temples can be observed.<br/>
For a mile and a half the traveller journeys through this<br/>
wonderful ravine, and then emerges on the wider valley,<br/>
called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span>Moosa.<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span>Moosa, just opposite the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Stk</span>, stands the<br/>
edifice called by the Arabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">El </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khuzneh </span>Faraon, or<br/>
Treasury of Pharaoh. It is a temple or sepulchre, cut in<br/>
the rock, with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade </span>of two stories. The lower story<br/>
