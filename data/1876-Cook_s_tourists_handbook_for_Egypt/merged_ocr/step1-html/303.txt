<span>282 THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
monotonous level hitherto passed through. Here anciently<br/>
stood the town of Rhinocolura, a penal settlement where, in<br/>
the days of the Pharaohs, criminals were allowed to live, but<br/>
were deprived of their noses-whence the name of this place.<br/>
Quails abound in this vicinity at certain seasons.<br/>
<br/>
Hard by is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">WMy-el-Arish</span>, which is considered to be<br/>
the "river of Egypt "mentioned in <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ambers </span>xxxiv. <span style="color: #0000FF;">f</span>,<br/>
amongst the borders of the Promised Land, also amongst the<br/>
borders of Judah in Joshua xv. There are also allusions to<br/>
this river in I Kings viii. <span style="color: #ff0000;">tit</span>, where Solomon's kingdom is<br/>
seen extending "from the entering in of Hamath unto the<br/>
river of Egypt." (See also 2 Kings xxiv. 7 and Isa. xxvii.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">12</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>) The bed of the torrent occupies the centre of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">WMy</span>.<br/>
As is usual in the desert valleys the stream is only flowing<br/>
after rains.<br/>
<br/>
About <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mile </span>beyond El Arish a chain of small hills is<br/>
reached on the frontiers of Syria. Here is a guard-house.<br/>
The road continues near the sea coast the whole way to<br/>
Gaza.<br/>
<br/>
At the tomb of Sheikh Abu <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tunid </span>are two columns<br/>
erected by Mahomed Ali to mark the boundary between Asia<br/>
and Africa.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Refhah </span>is the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rhaphia</span>, which according to<br/>
Josephus was the first halting-place of Titus when on his<br/>
way to the siege of Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
Khan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Yummy</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Yop'nex</span>, is the first Syrian village, and was<br/>
long notorious for the wretched stone building, encircled by<br/>
morass, where travellers by this route used to spend five<br/>
weary days in quarantine. The theory which <span style="color: #0000FF;">identifies </span>this<br/>
place with the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jenysus</span>, and also the interpretation of<br/>
the name of the place as the "resting-place of Jonas," are<br/>
doubtful points.<br/>
