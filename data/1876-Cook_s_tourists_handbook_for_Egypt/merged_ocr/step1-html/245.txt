which each carries, a little above the level of the bank, from<br/>
this elevation what is dredged up is run down on an incline<br/>
(or through a long tube) to the point on the bank where it<br/>
is to be deposited, and there shot out-they are called mudhoppers. They are hideous-looking objects-of all the works<br/>

The Cutting of Chalouf, three miles in length, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>

a rocky plateau in which many fossil remains were found.<br/>
<br/>
The Bitter Lakes are <span style="color: #0000FF;">B </span>5 miles across. Previous to<br/>
the flooding of this region in 1869 the lakes were simply an<br/>
extensive depression in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">desert </span>soil about 25 miles long,<br/>
and varying from a quarter of a mile to six miles in width.<br/>
In the deepest parts a thick saline deposit covered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">soil-in </span>fact, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>lakes were a kind of salt-water marsh.<br/>
It is considered by some, that anciently these marshes formed<br/>
the head of the Red Sea, and that it was here that the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Israelites </span>made <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>miraculous passage. Marine shells are<br/>
common<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">P<br/>
<br/>
</span>As the lowest parts of this depression were only two or<br/>
three yards above the intended bottom of the Great Canal,<br/>
more embanking than excavating had here to be accomplished.<br/>
The channel of the Canal across these lakes is marked out<br/>
by buoys, and two lighthouses, <span style="color: #ff0000;">6 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span>feet high, are placed at<br/>
important points. The traveller is, for a part of the voyage,<br/>
almost out of sight of land. A glass will show the shores<br/>
sprinkled with tamarisk trees. Many of these trees were<br/>
submerged in filling the lake, so that to a vessel, leaving the<br/>
mid-channel, snagging might <span style="color: #0000FF;">occur</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Leaving the Bitter Lakes, the Canal crosses a low plain<br/>
for two miles, and then passes through the cuttings of Serapeum and Toussoum, six miles in length. This vicinity<br/>
