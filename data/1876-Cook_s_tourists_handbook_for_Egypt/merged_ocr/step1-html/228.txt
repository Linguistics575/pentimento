lying to the west of the Libyan ridge. It is reached by a<br/>
depression in the ridge about 12 miles north-west <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Benisoéef</span>. West and south it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">cut </span>off from the Libyan Desert<br/>
by low hills. <span style="color: #0000FF;">North</span>, lies the Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Birket-eldforn</span>, bounded<br/>
by a ridge of bare rocks. Through the gap in the Libyan<br/>
Hills flows the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yo6sef</span>, or Great Canal, which crosses<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fyoém </span>to Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Birket-el-Parm </span>and irrigates the district<br/>
by its various artificial <span style="color: #0000FF;">ramifications </span>Only about half the<br/>
450 square miles of cultivatable land in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fyoém </span>are at<br/>
present utilized, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>villages represent the 300 of ancient<br/>
days. It is, nevertheless, at the present time, the most<br/>
fertile province of Egypt, the most varied in its products, and<br/>
contains the best villages. The rose-water, so much in<br/>
demand amongst wealthy Egyptians, is distilled from the<br/>
roses of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fyoém</span>. Apricots, figs, grapes, olives, and<br/>
other fruits thrive better here than in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>Valley. The corn,<br/>
cotton, and other usual Egyptian crops are very good. The<br/>
finest Egyptian sheep come from this province. Recently<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive </span>has introduced the cultivation of the sugar-cane<br/>
and the manufacture of sugar.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fyoém </span>was anciently the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoite </span>nome, or province,<br/>
famous for the city of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoii</span>, or Crocodilopolis, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maris</span>, and the marvellous Labyrinth, which<br/>
even in its partially-restored state so astonished the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Father </span>of<br/>
History.<br/>
<br/>
The trip to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fyodm </span>is accomplished by taking the<br/>
train on the Upper Egypt railway to El Wasta, and then<br/>
the branch line to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-el-Fares</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Cairo the train is entered at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boeldkuhzkrour<br/>
</span>station, on the other side of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>. The tourist must not<br/>
be impatient about starting at any precise time--<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>train<br/>
will set off when all is ready. Ghizeh is first passed. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Then<br/>
</span>amongst the wheat-fields and palm-groves, the train <span style="color: #ff0000;">speeds<br/>
