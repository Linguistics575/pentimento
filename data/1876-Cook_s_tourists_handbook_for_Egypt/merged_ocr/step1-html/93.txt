<br/>
Soon after leaving Alexandria, Lake Mareotis, whose<br/>
waters once washed the city walls, is skirted to the right.<br/>
Early in the year the waters are abundant, and the lake<br/>
appears of vast extent, but it is very shallow, as may be seen<br/>
by birds standing in it a mile or two off. As the summer<br/>
advances the waters diminish, and there is a broad expanse<br/>
of ugly and miasmatic swamp. Thousands of birds are seen<br/>
on the shores of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lake-ducks</span>, pelicans, and every description of waterfowl<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and from time to time, as the approach<br/>
of the train disturbs them, they fly up in clouds, presenting a<br/>
most tempting appearance to the sportsman. Whilst passing<br/>
the lake there is a good view to the left of the villas on the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahmoodeah </span>Canal, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pompey</span>'s Pillar and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">well..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">known </span>objects in the background.<br/>
<br/>
As Alexandria is speedily left behind, the tourist finds<br/>
himself brought more and more into contact with scenes<br/>
thoroughly Eastern.<br/>
<br/>
"At one place," says Mr. Hodder, "we saw a large<br/>
Bedouin encampment, with the low, <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat-topped </span>tents of<br/>
coarse camel's hair, the same in pattern and style as they<br/>
doubtless were when the world was in its infancy. Round<br/>
about were horses, camels, mules, and dromedaries, while the<br/>
sons of the desert in their picturesque dresses watched, in<br/>
graceful attitudes, the passing of the train. Some stood leaning on their guns, others lay on the ground smoking the<br/>
chibouk or <span style="color: #ff0000;">narghili</span>, while a group of naked children raised<br/>
a cheer as hearty as our street Arabs can raise on holidays.<br/>
Lovers of antiquity expatiate much on the impressions made<br/>
on their minds as they stand before some architectural work<br/>
of a remote period, and truly there are many emotions to be<br/>
stirred when <span style="color: #0000FF;">coming </span>in contact with some famous memorials<br/>
of a dead past; but to my mind there is something <span style="color: #0000FF;">infinitely<br/>
</span>more impressive in gazing upon such a scene as I <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>just<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
