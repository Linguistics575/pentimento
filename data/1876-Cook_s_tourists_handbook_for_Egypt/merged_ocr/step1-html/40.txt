</span>The captains and crews of the Nile steamers are of course<br/>
all natives, and belong to the regular navy<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>discipline, however,<br/>
is not very strict on board, nor have the captains, who only<br/>
speak Arabic, any authority over their passengers, which is<br/>
sometimes greatly to be regretted. They are, however, all very<br/>
modest and obliging men, and very much afraid of complaints<br/>
being <span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span>against them on return<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>for this reason, towards<br/>
the end of the Tour, they manage to get a certificate signed by<br/>
all the passengers, expressing their satisfaction. If such a<br/>
testimonial cannot be produced, or complaints are made against<br/>
them, they are fined, and part of their pay, which is already poor<br/>
enough, is withheld.<br/>
<br/>
The doctors on board the steamers were formerly all natives,<br/>
but since last season, according to a decision of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dive</span>,<br/>
European physicians belonging to the Sanitary Staff accompany<br/>
the steamers.<br/>
<br/>
Should any passenger desire to return to Cairo a day or two<br/>
sooner, he can be put down at any of the railway stations between Roda and Ghizeh; but as there is only one train a day,<br/>
<br/>
he must be careful not to miss it, or he might go without bed<br/>
and food<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
