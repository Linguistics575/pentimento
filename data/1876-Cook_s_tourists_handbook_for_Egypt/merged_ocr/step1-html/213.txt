on the walls. Under the principal entrance is an inscription recording the advance of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>General Dessaix<br/>
and his troops to this point, when in pursuit of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlooks</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the propylon, the court is reached, with a chapel<br/>
to the left, dedicated to Horus, on the outer wall of which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>copy of the inscription on the famous Rosetta stone,<br/>
but without the Greek version. The corridor on the<br/>
opposite side of the court is richly ornamented. Another<br/>
pylon is passed, on which are sculptures representing the<br/>
king slaying hostile nations. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">portion</span>, which is next<br/>
reached, sometimes called the "ten-columned court," is<br/>
by some considered the gem of Philae. It is of great beauty.<br/>
The colours in this hall, and some of the adjacent rooms,<br/>
are of marvellous freshness. The capitals are of vivid blue<br/>
and green, picked out with red, crimson, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">orange</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The<br/>
roof is bright blue, with golden stars, and there is an orb<br/>
with wings, elaborately delineated, representing the sun.<br/>
Several other chambers, and an adytum, with its monolithic<br/>
shrine and walls, covered with mythological <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span>,<br/>
are next visited. On the western side is a small temple of<br/>
the god of the Nile. The decorations comprise lotus,<br/>
papyrus, and other water plants, neatly executed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ear </span>the<br/>
top of the staircase leading to the terrace, is a small room<br/>
containing interesting sculptures describing the death and<br/>
resurrection of Osiris. These inner portions of the temple<br/>
beyond the portico are in thick darkness, and of course<br/>
artificial lights must be carried to explore them. Near the<br/>
adytum, or sanctuary, are some small dark rooms, to which<br/>
a staircase leads from the front of that chamber. "They<br/>
have the <span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance</span>," says Wilkinson, "of being intended<br/>
either for concealing the sacred treasures of the temple, or<br/>
for some artifice connected with superstition, and, perhaps,<br/>
