<span>2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
The enjoyment of otherwise of this part of the journey will<br/>
much depend upon what wind is blowing. A khamseen<br/>
wind or a fresh sea breeze (the latter usually prevalent in the<br/>
afternoon) will make all the difference.<br/>
<br/>
It <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>usual after crossing the plain of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Markhah</span>, to ascend<br/>
by the narrow pass of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seih </span>Bab'a into the mountains. The<br/>
Israelites no doubt continued by the shore for ten miles<br/>
further on, crossing the wilderness of Sin to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Whdy<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Feiriin</span>, and passing up that valley to Sinai.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seih </span>Bah'a is a narrow limestone valley, from<br/>
which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Waidy </span>Shellal opens but. Up this <span style="color: #0000FF;">valley</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>through fine scenery, the road conducts to the sandstone<br/>
cliff of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hugh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Buderah</span>. A steep path, practicable for<br/>
camels, leads up the face of the cliff to a small plain at the<br/>
top. Hence the road passes on to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W'ady </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nugb </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Buderah</span>, and then along the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seih </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sidreh</span>. Here the red<br/>
sandstone of the Sinaitic peninsula is first met with. To.<br/>
wards the upper end of the narrow part of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seih </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sidreh<br/>
</span>the mouth of a small valley called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span>Igne is seen.<br/>
It is most probable that an encampment will be made near<br/>
this spot, and if so, the opportunity should be taken before<br/>
pursuing the journey to ascend the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy</span>, and devote a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fed<br/>
</span>hours to the exploration of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wsidy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Magharah</span>, containing the extensive excavations made by the ancient Egyptians in mining for turquoises. Numerous inscriptions are<br/>
seen; on tablets of beautiful hieroglyphics are the names of<br/>
kings as far back as the time of Abraham. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senefroo</span>, first<br/>
king of the fourth dynasty, Cheops, builder of the Great<br/>
Pyramid, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha</span>, Thothmes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>, figure in these rock<br/>
records. Immense must have been the labour to cut out<br/>
these caves so far up the mountain side. Swarms of Monks<br/>
tenanted the disused excavations in the early centuries of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Christianity</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
