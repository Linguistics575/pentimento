masonry reaches 28<span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>feet down. The other well is <span style="color: #0000FF;">f </span>feet in<br/>
diameter and 42 feet deep to the water. The action of the<br/>
ropes for so many centuries has worn deep grooves in the<br/>
kerb-stones round the wells, so that they "look as if frilled<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">fluted </span>all round." In the bed of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dy </span>is a group of<br/>
five smaller wells. The foundations and ruins of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">moderatelysized </span>town are scattered over some low hills to the north of<br/>
the two principal wells<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The vicinity is quite bare of either<br/>
trees or shrubs.<br/>
<br/>
Beersheba, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beershaba</span>, as it is called in the earlier<br/>
records, is mentioned again in connection with Isaac, who<br/>
tarried here after digging the wells in the valley of Gerar<br/>
made by his father, which the Philistines had stopped up.<br/>
Here God renewed the Promise, and here a fresh treaty was<br/>
made with Abimelech, king of the Philistines (Gen. xxvi.)<br/>
The place is <span style="color: #0000FF;">again </span>mentioned in connection with Jacob, who<br/>
tarried here on his way down to Egypt. The Divine Promise was again renewed on this spot (Gen. <span style="color: #0000FF;">shi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s-w</span>), and<br/>
hence the patriarch set forth with his sons, "and their little<br/>
ones, and their wives, in the waggons which Pharaoh had<br/>
sent to carry him." Beersheba is next mentioned as one of<br/>
the towns on the southern boundary of the tribe of Judah<br/>
(Joshua xv. 28). In xix. 2 it is given to the tribe of<br/>
Simeon; see also I Chron. iv. 28. The sons of Samuel<br/>
"were judges in Beersheba "( 1 Samuel viii. 2). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">expression</span>, "from Dan to Beersheba," as in Judges xx. 1, and in<br/>
other <span style="color: #ff0000;">passages-or </span>"from Beersheba to Dan," as in <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>Chron.<br/>
xxi. 2, and elsewhere-became a familiar mode of signifying<br/>
the whole of the Land of Israel; as in after times, when the<br/>
ten tribes had revolted, "from Geba to Beersheba," as in<br/>
2 Kings xxiii. 8, etc., or "from Beersheba to Mount<br/>
Ephraim," as in, Chron. xix. 4, etc., signified the extent of<br/>
the kingdom <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofJudah</span>. After the Captivity, a more limited<br/>
