ever-shifting sands of the desert. Breccia, porphyry, alabaster,<br/>

<br/>
During the greater part of the year the climate of Egypt<br/>
is very healthy. In April and May the hot south wind<br/>
called the Khamseen is oppressive and insalubrious. After<br/>
the inundation in autumn, dysentery and ophthalmia <span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>other complaints often result from the exhalations from the<br/>
soil. The heat of summer is not often oppressive, as the<br/>
atmosphere is exceedingly dry, and there is generally a refreshing breeze from the north. Upper Egypt, though<br/>
hotter, is more healthy than the Delta. Lower Egypt has<br/>
rain occasionally, but Upper Egypt is an almost totally rainless district.<br/>
<br/>
The average temperature of Lower Egypt ranges between<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">80° </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">po</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>in summer, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">50° </span>and 60° in winter, and that<br/>
of Upper Egypt between <span style="color: #ff0000;">90° </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">100° </span>in summer and <span style="color: #ff0000;">tfoo<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">70° </span>in winter.<br/>

The plague was once a terrible scourge in Egypt, as in<br/>
other Eastern countries, but owing to the precautions taken<br/>
by the Government, it has not made its appearance since<br/>
1843.<br/>

<br/>
The palm groves surrounding the Egyptian villages are<br/>
the nearest approach to anything like forest scenery in Egypt,<br/>
and the wild beasts are consequently few.in number. The<br/>
principal species are the wolf, fox, <span style="color: #0000FF;">jachal</span>, hyaena, ichneumon,<br/>
jerboa, wild ass, and several varieties of antelope. Camels,<br/>
horses, asses, horned cattle, and sheep are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">principal<br/>
