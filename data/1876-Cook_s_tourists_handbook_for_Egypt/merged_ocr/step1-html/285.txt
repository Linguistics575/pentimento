<br/>
they said to Moses, Speak thou to us, and we will <span style="color: #0000FF;">hear</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bat<br/>
</span>let not God speak to us, lest we die."<br/>
<br/>
On returning, the Convent is reached by a precipitous<br/>
gorge from near the Plain of the Willow. It was probably<br/>
whilst descending this ravine that Moses and Joshua heard<br/>
the noise of the people shouting, but could not understand<br/>
the reason till, on reaching a farther point, the Golden Calf<br/>
was seen; and then, in sign of the broken covenant, the<br/>
Tables of the Law were shattered at the foot of the mountain (Exod. xxxii. <span style="color: #ff0000;">15-2o</span>). In descending this ravine, a<br/>
grotto is passed, from which issues a spring <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ice.cold </span>water.<br/>
This is the Cave of St. Callistratus.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wiidy </span>el <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lej </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span>, another locality easily visited from<br/>
the Convent, is a deep, narrow gorge, running between the<br/>
range of Sinai and the Jebel Abu. Here is another of the<br/>
alleged sites of the striking of the rock by Moses. This<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dy </span>conducts to the ruined "Convent of the Forty,"<br/>
the oldest in Sinai. It was erected to commemorate the<br/>
slaughter of forty monks by Arabs. It is now inhabited by<br/>
the Arabs who till the beautiful <span style="color: #0000FF;">gardens </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">surrounding </span>it at the<br/>
foot of Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Katereena</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Jebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Katereena</span>, 8536 feet, affords a splendid<br/>
view of the Sinaitic peninsula<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the two arms of the Red Sea<br/>
can be traced almost to the point of union. Various sites<br/>
chosen by the monks for Bible scenes are passed on the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">war-the </span>Burial-place of the Tables of the Law, the Mould<br/>
of the Calf, the Cave of Korah, Dathan, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abiram</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>also the Stone of Moses, which he is said to have <span style="color: #ff0000;">severed<br/>
<br/>
</span>with his sword<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>SINAI TO SUEZ<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The traveller, after <span style="color: #0000FF;">exploring </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mount </span>Sinai and its surrounding attractions, can, if he shrinks from the sixteen or<br/>
seventeen days' journey <span style="color: #ff0000;">by'Ahabah </span>and Petra, or has reason<br/>
