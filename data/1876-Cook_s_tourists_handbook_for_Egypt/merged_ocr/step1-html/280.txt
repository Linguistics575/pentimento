<span>CONVENT OF ST. CATHERINE. <span style="color: #ff0000;">259<br/>
<br/>
</span>the Muslims swept all before them in the East, St. Catherine<br/>
was saved by the erection of a mosque within the walls.<br/>
This mosque, now unused, still exists.<br/>
<br/>
The Convent is now barely self-sustaining, its brotherhood being reduced to about thirty members lay and clerical,<br/>
and the whole premises show signs of general decay. <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>is<br/>
a large rectangular enclosure, built much like a <span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval<br/>
</span>castle, the rooms ranging round an interior court, in which<br/>
stand the church and the mosque. It is of venerable age,<br/>
the original structure being everywhere retained, with such<br/>
modern additions as sheer necessity has demanded.<br/>
<br/>
The Church of the Transfiguration is a small<br/>
building, with a handsome belfry and a musical chime of bells.<br/>
The curiously-carved, massive, wooden door is of high <span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquity</span>. The edifice is in the usual form of a Greek church;<br/>
granite columns support a nave and two aisles flanked with side<br/>
chapels. The pictures, mostly mere <span style="color: #0000FF;">daubs</span>, are very numerous,<br/>
one of them representing St. John dictating to a youth, is<br/>
rather striking. In the apse within the altar-screen are two<br/>
massive silver sarcophagi, containing the relics of St. Catherine. One of these sarcophagi is richly gilt, and is said to<br/>
be eight hundred years old. The Chapel of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Burning </span>Bush is <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjacent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>all visitors must take off their<br/>
shoes on entering. The traditional site of the bush is<br/>
marked by a large gilded plate. In the church may be<br/>
noticed a good deal of wood-carving, some excellent mosaics,<br/>
especially on the oval-shaped ceiling behind the altar; and<br/>
also some beautiful wood-work inlaid with ivory. The<br/>
Cemetery of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monks'is </span>a very singular place. A door<br/>
about three feet in height conducts to this subterranean<br/>
home of the dead. The bones of past monks are here properly <span style="color: #0000FF;">sorted </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>in one place is a pile of skulls, then a pile of<br/>
arm and leg bones, and so on. In an adjoining room are<br/>
