<span style="color: #0000FF;">GEOGRAPH </span>ICAL FEATU RES.<br/>
<br/>
EGYPT is bounded by the Mediterranean on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">north </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>by<br/>
the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea on the east; and<br/>
by the great Libyan Desert on the west. The area of Egypt<br/>
was officially stated in 1870 as 216,000 square miles. But<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive </span>also rules over Soudan and the Red Sea coasts<br/>
down to Massowah, in latitude 15° 34' N. In 1872 the<br/>
Egyptian territory had reached a total of 730,000 square<br/>
miles, and more recently Sir Samuel Baker has added immense districts, stretching south to the Equator.<br/>
<br/>
Egypt proper is really the valley of the Nile owing<br/>
its existence and fertility to that wonderful river. The<br/>
valley of Egypt proper commences at the First Cataract,<br/>
near Assouan (p. 186), the ancient Syene. From this point for<br/>
600 miles the valley, varying from two to ten miles in width,<br/>
is enclosed by mountains on each side, with occasional defiles<br/>
leading westward to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oases</span>, and eastward to the Red<br/>
Sea. This valley forms the Said, or Upper Egypt, anciently<br/>
called the Thebaid. Lower Egypt consists of the Delta of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, and the level plains adjacent. Central Egypt is<br/>
rather a geographical expression than a clearly defined <span style="color: #0000FF;">district</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>including the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fyo6m</span>, and country round Cairo, from<br/>
the issuing of the Nile from its narrow <span style="color: #0000FF;">mountain-girt </span>valley<br/>
till its separation into the channels by which it reaches the<br/>
Mediterranean.<br/>
