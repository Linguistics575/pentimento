MODERN CAIRO<br/>
<br/>
is situated about twenty miles from the .Delta on the east<br/>
bank of the Nile, and contains a population of about 360,000.<br/>
Less exclusively Oriental than Damascus, and far less Euro.<br/>
pean than Alexandria, it possesses a character of its own<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and at every step the traveller is entertained by the aspect of<br/>
the streets he passes through, and the wonderful medley of<br/>
human life pouring along the (mostly narrow) thoroughfares.<br/>
Cairo, however, is still the city of Arabian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nights</span>, and all<br/>
who are well up in those veracious chronicles will find themselves perpetually localizing the scenes and individualizing<br/>
the characters of which Scheherazade <span style="color: #0000FF;">shattered </span>so well and<br/>
to such <span style="color: #0000FF;">good </span>purpose.<br/>
<br/>
The following description of the general aspect of Cairo<br/>
is by the French painter Marilhat <span style="color: #0000FF;">t-<br/>
</span>"The city lies before you like the thousand little turrets<br/>
of a Gothic edifice, at the foot of a steep whitish mountain,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flanked </span>by a citadel of towers and white domes, in the<br/>
Turkish taste. On one side, towards the mountain, is the<br/>
desert, in all its aridity and desolation-its loneliness increased by the City of the Tombs, with its streets and houses,<br/>
and quarters, and palaces, but no living inhabitants except<br/>
reptiles and solitary birds-immense vultures <span style="color: #0000FF;">perching </span>on<br/>
the minarets like the vedettes of this melancholy population.<br/>
On the other side, towards the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, are fields covered with<br/>
brilliant verdure, and at certain periods with charming pieces<br/>
of water, the remains of the annual inundation, sparkling<br/>
like mirrors in the midst of the greenness. Between these<br/>
two contrasting scenes stands the city, perfectly in harmony<br/>
with this singular landscape, an immense assemblage of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
