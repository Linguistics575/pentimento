<span>126 EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
of Memphis (the Pyramids, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abouseer</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salrksirah</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dasho6r</span>) are still in being, and instruct us concerning the<br/>
history of this city during the diverse periods of its existence.<br/>
Already founded under the most ancient kings <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded </span>to the throne of Menes, flourishing under the<br/>
great <span style="color: #ff0000;">pyramid-bpilding </span>fourth dynasty, and also under the<br/>
fifth and sixth, neglected and abandoned under the eleventh,<br/>
twelfth, and thirteenth dynasties, Memphis, like Egypt<br/>
itself, arose to new life when the kings of the eighteenth<br/>
dynasty succeeded in clearing the soil of Egypt of its invaders.<br/>
Taken and re-taken by turns, under Assyrian, Ethiopian,<br/>
and Persian dynasties, Memphis still preserved, under the<br/>
Greeks, a portion of its ancient splendour, although when<br/>
Strabo came, it was already deserted. But the time was<br/>
approaching when of Memphis nothing but ruins should<br/>
remain, and when the sombre menaces of Jeremiah should<br/>
be fulfilled to the letter: "o daughter of Egypt, make ready<br/>
that which can serve thee in thy captivity, because Memphis<br/>
shall become a desert; she shall be forsaken and become<br/>
uninhabitable." Long mounds where only the date-palm<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flourishes</span>, here and there a fragment of wall, a shaft of a<br/>
broken column, some mutilated statues half-buried in the<br/>
soil or prostrate in the mud, such is, in fact, all that remains<br/>
to our day of the city that for ages exercised so <span style="color: #0000FF;">vast </span>an<br/>
influence over the affairs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">world. </span>"<br/>
<br/>
Memphis, except in Hosea <span style="color: #ff0000;">1x</span>. 6, <span style="color: #ff0000;">i </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IS </span>called in the Scriptures Moph or Noph, probably contractions of one of the<br/>
Egyptian names of the city <span style="color: #ff0000;">Men-Nefru </span>(Pyramid-city). It<br/>
was the capital of Lower Egypt at the time of the patriarchs.<br/>
The declaration of Jeremiah (xlvi. <span style="color: #0000FF;">19</span>), that "Noph shall be<br/>
waste and desolate, without an inhabitant," has been most<br/>
literally fulfilled. The "princes of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Noph </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>are mentioned<br/>
in Isa. xix. I3, and in Jer. ii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">16</span>, xlvi. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I4</span>; and in Ezek.<br/>
