<span>I 2 INTRODUCTORY.<br/>
<br/>
through Lower' Egypt to Ismailia and Port Said, and thence to<br/>
Jaffa. Return from Jaffa, or Caifa, to Alexandria, and then to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aples</span>, and by railway to Rome, Florence, Bologna, Turin, or<br/>
round by Venice and Milan to Turin en route for Paris. This<br/>
is the cheapest and most popular route to Palestine. But this<br/>
can be modified, extended or abridged in many ways. It<br/>
can be reversed through Italy, and other lines of steamers can<br/>
be taken from French <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Italian ports. In all cases of <span style="color: #ff0000;">personallyconducted </span>tours it is necessary to define the route the conductor<br/>
will take, and those who keep with him will fare the best, as all<br/>
baggage, omnibus and other incidental charges are paid by him;<br/>
but if any leave him it is not possible to control these expenses,<br/>
and the travellers must then take their own course and pay the<br/>
extras. Tickets can be provided for travelling by any line of<br/>
railway or steamboat.<br/>
<br/>
ROUTES FROM AMERICA TO THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
All the very best routes are under the arrangement of<br/>
Messrs. T. COOK & SON. There is not a line of steamships<br/>
crossing the Atlantic by which they cannot secure passages.<br/>
The managers of the best lines are their <span style="color: #ff0000;">firmest </span>friends, and<br/>
from both Liverpool and Glasgow they have connection with the<br/>
best railroad service of the United Kingdom<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>They can offer to<br/>
American travellers Pullman cars by day or night, or the best<br/>
class of select compartment carriages.<br/>
<br/>
If Americans wish to go to the East by the Western Route,<br/>
tickets can be issued either by San Francisco, Japan, China and<br/>
India to Egypt, or by the route of New Zealand, Australia,<br/>
Ceylon and India.<br/>
<br/>
Tickets to return to America by the south course of the<br/>
Atlantic, from Gibraltar direct to New York, without returning<br/>
through Europe can be issued; or arrangements made for<br/>
visiting Scandinavia either <span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>or after the Palestine tour.<br/>
Spain is also re-opening to travellers since the cessation of the<br/>
war.<br/>
