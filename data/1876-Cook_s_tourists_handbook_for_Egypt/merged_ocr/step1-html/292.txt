<span>PETRA. 27 <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>'AKABAH TO PETRA.<br/>
(Four days' journey.)<br/>
<br/>
After <span style="color: #0000FF;">leaving'Akabah</span>, and ascending the'Arabah about<br/>
two hours, travellers <span style="color: #0000FF;">turn </span>eastward and enter the gorge of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nirtidy-e1-1thrn</span>. At the entrance to the gorge is the<br/>
mountain Jebel-et-Nuin, the near summit of which, Jebel<br/>
Gingeh, is identified by Dr. Beke as Mount Sinai. This<br/>
view is not generally received, and it is difficult to harmonize<br/>
it with the Biblical narrative of events and itinerary of travel.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The traveller is now on the ancient caravan route from,<br/>
Petra to the Red Sea. Traces of the old Roman road and<br/>
remains of towers and fortresses are frequently found. The<br/>
Israelites, when refused a passage through Edom, descended<br/>
from Mount Hor down the'Arabah to the sea, and then for<br/>
some distance along the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Ithm </span>till they reached a<br/>
valley which led them further eastward. The scenery of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wsidy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Ithm </span>is less sterile than in the peninsula. The valley<br/>
widens into a plain often covered with green. The rocks<br/>
around are of soft sandstone, and are often very beautiful<br/>
in form, rising like huge cathedrals, crowned with domes,<br/>
cone-like towers, and minarets.<br/>
<br/>
Petra is situated in the midst of wild and magnificent<br/>
scenery which bursts suddenly upon the traveller. Whilst<br/>
skirting the lofty <span style="color: #ff0000;">mountain-chain </span>that encloses it on the east,<br/>
the wilderness of rocky peaks is seen beneath, intersected by<br/>
deep ravines, and coloured with the richest hues. Mount<br/>
Hor rises in lone majesty directly opposite; beyond it lies<br/>
the'Arabah like a lake of gold, with the Mountains of the<br/>
Tih wilderness for a background in the far distance. On<br/>
approaching the city the country gives constant evidence of<br/>
former cultivation. High up the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mountain-sides </span>rise the<br/>
<br/>
