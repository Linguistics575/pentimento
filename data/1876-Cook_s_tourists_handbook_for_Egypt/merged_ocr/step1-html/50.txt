corded amongst the Mosaic plagues are still most <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpleasantly </span>numerous in the Egyptian land.<br/>
<br/>
Amongst the trees and plants of Egypt many European<br/>
varieties flourish. Date palms, doom palms, sycamores,<br/>
tamarisks, acacias, etc., are the most noticeable. The lotus,<br/>
or water-lily of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, conspicuous in the ornamentation<br/>
of the old temples and tombs, and used for making a sort of<br/>
bread now, as in the days of Herodotus, is a noticeable object<br/>
in the Delta, when the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>is at full height. The papyrus,<br/>
from whose delicate white pith the ancients made paper, has<br/>
become scarce, and according to some extinct. There are<br/>
very doubtful rumours of its existence in some <span style="color: #0000FF;">out-of-the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>spots<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>

</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">* </span>"The lotus and papyrus," says Dr. Samuel Manning, in his<br/>
Land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Pharaohs, "were formerly the most common of its<br/>
products, insomuch that they formed the symbols of Upper and Lower<br/>
Egypt<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The papyrus was used not only for making paper, to which it<br/>
gave its name, but for the construction of boats, baskets, and innumerable other articles<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>as in the Upper Jordan <span style="color: #ff0000;">V </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">alley</span>, where it still<br/>
grows abundantly, even cottages were built with it. No religious<br/>
service, no state ceremonial, no domestic festival is found without the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lotus-flower</span>. It forms part of every offering to the gods. The guests<br/>
at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>banquet all held one in their hands. It is, perhaps, the object of<br/>
all others most constantly represented on the monuments. Yet both<br/>
the lotus and papyrus have disappeared from Egypt. No trace of either.<br/>
can be found. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Unaccountable </span>as is the disappearance of these plants,<br/>
it was yet foretold by the Prophet Isaiah, as a part of the Divine <span style="color: #0000FF;">judgment </span>upon <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>The brooks of defence shall be emptied <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>dried<br/>
up t the reeds and flags shall wither. The paper reeds by' the <span style="color: #ff0000;">broiirs<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">d </span>and everything sown by the brooks, shall wither, be <span style="color: #0000FF;">driven'away</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>and be no more' (Isa. xix. 6, 7). The phrase,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'bropks </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">defence</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>in this passage, has greatly perplexed commentators. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Broeks</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>the<br/>
proper sense of the term, there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">none </span>in Egypt. Of <span style="color: #ff0000;">cdurse</span>' the<br/>
reference is to the canals with which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span>is intersected<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>But<br/>
why' brooks of defence'? It has been commonly supposed that they<br/>
were constructed simply for irrigation. But it affords a striking <span style="color: #0000FF;">illus<br/>
