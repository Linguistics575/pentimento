Jebel Moosa was for ages the traditional Sinai. The<br/>
ascent is by a grand ravine behind the Convent. The stones<br/>
have been adjusted to form rude steps. The beautiful spring<br/>
called "the, Fountain of Moses," shaded by a huge<br/>
rock, is reached after half-an.hour's climbing. Here Moses<br/>
is said to have watered the flocks of Jethro.<br/>
<br/>
A Chapel of the Virgin, commemorative of <span style="color: #0000FF;">deliver</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>ance from a famine, is next passed, with the usual ornaments,<br/>
and some paintings. According to another statement, this<br/>
chapel was built in memory of the extirpation of fleas in the<br/>
adjacent convent. After climbing some distance farther,<br/>
the two gateways are passed under, at which, formerly,<br/>
pilgrims confessed to St. Stephanos and his successors, and<br/>
were shriven before ascending to the holy heights. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rude </span>Chapels of Elijah and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elisha</span>, with their common<br/>
court, now a refuge for goats and ibexes, stand on a little<br/>
plateau, with a beautiful cypress, seventy-five feet high, and a<br/>
spring of water close at hand. Monkish tradition locates<br/>
here the sublime scene in I Kings xix. 9, 10, when Elijah,<br/>
fleeing from the wrath of Jezebel, sought a refuge in "the<br/>
Mount of God," and after wind and earthquake and fire had<br/>
passed by, heard "the still small voice "speaking words of<br/>
comfort and promise. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Half-arrhour</span>'s ascent by a steep<br/>
rugged path, conducts to the summit. The asserted print<br/>
of Mahomed's camel's foot, made in his famous night ride<br/>
from Mecca to Sinai and <span style="color: #0000FF;">back</span>, may be viewed in passing.<br/>
<br/>
The summit of Jebel Moosa is about 7000 ft. above<br/>
the sea level and 2000 above the Convent. A Chapel<br/>
(still used), a Mosque (only used for an annual sacrifice),<br/>
and some ruins, occupy a small level space of solid rock.<br/>
