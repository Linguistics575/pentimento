<span>ABOO SIMBEL. 203<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tosko</span>, a weir is formed by the rocks running down<br/>
into the river, and hence the journey is through complete<br/>
desert scenery to Aboo Simbel. Some of the rocks are very<br/>
singular in form. One rises from the level sand reminding<br/>
the visitor of the Pyramid of Cheops; another has been<br/>
compared to the Sphinx.<br/>
<br/>
Aboo Simbel, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ipsambool </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">170 </span>miles S. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philae</span>, and<br/>
46 from the Second Cataract), contains the most interesting monuments to be found in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubia</span>, and perhaps to most<br/>
tourists the only ones specially demanding their notice.<br/>
W. C. Prime, in his Boat Life in Egypt and Nubia, says the<br/>
Great Temple "is the most impressive of the monuments of Egyptian grandeur. I say the most impressive,<br/>
because here is all that can impress the heart. Here are the<br/>
remains of ancient wealth, splendour, and taste united.<br/>
Here the sublime idea of the great Sesostris stands graven<br/>
on the rock, and the men of the nineteenth century after<br/>
Christ respond with their hearts to the call which the man<br/>
of the fourteenth before Christ utters from the face of the<br/>
mountain."<br/>
<br/>
The exterior of the Great Temple is in a niche cat in<br/>
the face of the mountain. Three of the most splendid of<br/>
Egyptian Colossi sit on thrones carved out of the face of the<br/>
rock. There is another throne, tenantless, for the Colossus<br/>
who once sat there has fallen to ruins. A frieze of little<br/>
monkeys runs across near the summit of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade</span>. The<br/>
desert sand has drifted across the foot of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple</span>, so that<br/>
of one Colossus only the head and neck are seen. These<br/>
immense statues measure 66 feet in height; the forefinger<br/>
of each being a yard long. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade </span>of the temple is<br/>
nearly 100 feet in height.<br/>
<br/>
Over the ridge of sand thirty feet high, the doorway <span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>the two centre statues can be entered, and the interior<br/>
of the temple explored. Candles must be provided to<br/>
