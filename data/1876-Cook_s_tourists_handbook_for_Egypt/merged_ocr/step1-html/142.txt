</span>the stones of Cairo could speak, they could reveal wondrous<br/>
tales of life in the City of the Sun forty centuries ago.<br/>

The celebrated Obelisk is a monolith, and the most<br/>
ancient of the obelisks of Egypt. It bears the name <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osirtasen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the founder of the twelfth dynasty, and stands 68 ft.<br/>
in height above the pavement. In the time of the Arab<br/>
historian, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abd-el-Lateef</span>, a second obelisk lay on the ground,<br/>
broken in two pieces, but of this no vestige now remains.<br/>
<br/>
One might think that a monument like the Obelisk of<br/>
Heliopolis, that was old when Abraham came down to Egypt<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-that </span>must often have been seen by Joseph, and in after<br/>
years by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Israelitish </span>bondmen as they lifted their eyes<br/>
from their weary toil-might be spared by travelling Vandals. But even here a party of English ladies and gentlemen (<span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span>) have been seen hacking at its base with a large sledge<br/>
hammer, hailing with delight the pieces that fell, which they<br/>
scrambled to steal.<br/>

SAKKARAH.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkérah</span>, and the site of ancient Memphis en route,<br/>
may be visited by taking carriage to the station at Ghizeh,<br/>
on the Upper Egypt Railway, then proceeding by train to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshayn</span>, and thence by donkeys (sometimes brought<br/>
on in the train or sent forward over night) to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkérah</span>.<br/>
It can be visited from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshayn </span>by passengers on the<br/>
Nile steamers (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">135</span>).<br/>
<br/>
From Ghizeh to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshayn </span>the railway runs through<br/>
groves of palms. Leaving <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshayn</span>, a wretched <span style="color: #0000FF;">mud</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span>village, the visitor next reaches <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mitrahenny</span>, the site<br/>
of ancient Memphis, once the capital of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
"The history of Memphis," says Mariette Bey, "is to a<br/>
great extent the history of Heliopolis. Moreover, we find<br/>
here an aid that Heliopolis has denied us. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolises<br/>
