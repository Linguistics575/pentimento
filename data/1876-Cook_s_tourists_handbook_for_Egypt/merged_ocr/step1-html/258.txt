</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Semenhood </span>is a station on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Talkah </span>line.<br/>
The town has bazaars, and the usual Oriental scenes. It is<br/>
famous for its potteries, and marks the site of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebennytus</span>,<br/>
the city of Sem, the Egyptian Hercules. "An hour was<br/>
spent to see the potters at their work, near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Semenhood</span>, the<br/>
town being celebrated for this ancient art. Among the<br/>
tombs, in low clay huts, the nimble-fingered and <span style="color: #ff0000;">prehensiletoed </span>successors of old Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">potters </span>were plying the busy<br/>
wheels. The wheel that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mes </span>round by that man's naked<br/>
foot is the same as when Amenophis died, and the vase<br/>
that is now spinning swiftly, is of the shape that Sesostris<br/>
drank from-for'why should they change<span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">u-that </span>is what<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bebayt-el-Hagar </span>presents the remains of a city where<br/>
Isis was the great tutelary god. The place was called by the<br/>
Greeks <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iseon</span>, in consequence. "Here," says Zincke, "are<br/>
the ruins of a most stately temple, every stone in the walls<br/>
and roof of which was an enormous block of granite. <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0<br/>
</span>other material had been used. So regardless had been its<br/>
builders of cost, that throughout the greater part of the<br/>
structure they had sculptured this intractable adamant in<br/>
unusually high relief. But though it had been thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">massively </span>constructed of imperishable materials, and decorated<br/>
with such lavish expenditure, it was so completely wrecked,<br/>
that now the traveller finds in its place merely a heap of<br/>
stones. What had been the temple is there, but not one<br/>
stone has been left standing on another."<br/>
<br/>
The temple was erected by Ptolemy Philadelphus, and<br/>
measured 400 ft. by <span style="color: #0000FF;">BOO </span>ft. It was surrounded by groves,<br/>
and stood in an extensive area measuring 1500 ft. by 1000 ft.<br/>
Isis, Osiris, Anubis, Savak, and other deities figure in the<br/>
sculptures on the overturned and broken stones. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">battle<br/>
