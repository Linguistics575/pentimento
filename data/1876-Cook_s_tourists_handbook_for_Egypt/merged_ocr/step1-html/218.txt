<br/>
</span>this terrace is ascended by a third flight of steps, and the front<br/>
of the propylon is before the visitor.<br/>
<br/>
This propylon--<span style="color: #ff0000;">ur2 </span>feet long, <span style="color: #0000FF;">60 </span>feet high, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">GO </span>feet<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ttlick-was </span>never completed, and looks like a bare <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the<br/>
usual ornamented doorway conducts to a dromos covered with<br/>
broken columns, and cornices, and blocks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the<br/>
pronaos has twelve columns, with elegant capitals of palm<br/>
and vine leaves; the adytum, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hall </span>and various other rooms<br/>
can be explored, and are covered with sculptures not in the<br/>
best style of Egyptian art. This temple dates from the<br/>
time of Augustus-the extensive ruins excite wonder, for it<br/>
seems as if the edifice was overthrown before its completion. Some of the additions date from the reigns of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caligula</span>, Trajan and Severus.<br/>
<br/>
At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Btrysel-Welly </span>(W.) is a smaller temple dedicated to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Amunre</span>, Kneph, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Anof1kts </span>by Rameses II. The victories of that monarch are sculptured on the exterior<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>inside<br/>
also there are much admirable painting and sculpture, the<br/>
colouring of which is very fresh and vivid; on each side of<br/>
the hall of entrance is a recess containing three sitting<br/>
deities. "It is, however, on the outside approach to this<br/>
hall," says the Rev. A. M. Smith, "that I found the objects<br/>
which interested me most<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>consisting of representations of<br/>
various animals from the interior of Africa, conducted by<br/>
Ethiopians of true Negro type of figure. I copied the greater<br/>
part of these figures, the more prominent of which are the<br/>
giraffe, bull, lion, gazelle, monkey, and ostrich, and no artist<br/>
of the present day (not even Landseer or Wolff) could depict<br/>
more graphically in outline the true proportions and characteristics of these several creatures than those drawn on the<br/>
wall by some talented draughtsman thirty-two centuries<br/>
since."<br/>

Through some bare and desolate scenery, and the rapids<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Aboo Hor, the steamer now passes on to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dendoo'r</span>. Here<br/>
