<br/>
THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">SPHINX</span>.<br/>
<br/>
About a quarter of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mile </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the Great Pyramid stands<br/>
that colossal mystery the Sphinx,<br/>
<br/>
"Staring right on, with calm eternal eyes,"<br/>
<br/>
and called by the Arabs, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Aboo.e1-hN</span>," the Father of Terror<br/>
or Immensity. The Sphinx, as an emblem of sovereign<br/>
power-intellect joined with strength-is common enough<br/>
among the monuments of Egypt, but, as regards magnitude<br/>
of proportion, this Sphinx stands unique, and is the Sphinx.<br/>
Its body is the natural rock, here and there adapted by a<br/>
little carving or the addition of masonry, and is 140 feet in<br/>
length. The paws, Jo feet in length, are built up of huge<br/>
hewn stones. The head is carved out of the solid rock, and<br/>
measures 30 feet from brow to chin, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>feet across. Its<br/>
features are now hopelessly mutilated, but are said to have<br/>
once worn "an expression of the softest beauty and most<br/>
winning grace." From a sanctuary between the lion-like<br/>
paws of this colossal image, sacrifices were offered to the<br/>
divinity it was supposed to represent. The Sphinx is of<br/>
immense antiquity. It was at one time ascribed to Thothmes<br/>
IV. (of the eighteenth dynasty), but subsequent research has<br/>
removed its origin many ages <span style="color: #ff0000;">farther </span>back. When Cheops<br/>
or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoofoo </span>reared the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx was in<br/>
existence. This is proved by the stone discovered by<br/>
Mariette Bey, No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">581 </span>in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boul√©k </span>Museum (see p. 97).<br/>
<br/>
"Laugh and mock if you will at the worship of stone<br/>
idols," says Kinglake, "<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>mark ye this, ye breakers of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
