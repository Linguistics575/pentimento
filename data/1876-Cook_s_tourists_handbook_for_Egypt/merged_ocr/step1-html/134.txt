are, however, to be found at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakk√©rah</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Causeways by which the materials were brought<br/>
for the construction of the First and Third Pyramids still<br/>
exist, though in diminished proportions. That leading to<br/>
the Great Pyramid is 85 feet in height and 32 feet broad.<br/>
It was by these causeways, the smooth stones <span style="color: #ff0000;">formin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">g </span>the<br/>
outer casing of the Pyramids, were retransported by the<br/>
Caliphs and Sultans in order to erect their Mosques and<br/>
Palaces.<br/>
<br/>
We extract from Dean Stanley's Sinai and Palestine<br/>
the following graphic description of the Pyramids as they<br/>
were in their glory <span style="color: #ff0000;">..-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>" The smooth casing of part of the<br/>
top of the second Pyramid, and the magnificent granite<br/>
blocks which form the lower stages of the third, serve to<br/>
show what they <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>have been all from top to bottom<span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>the first and second brilliant white or yellow limestone,<br/>
smooth from top to bottom, instead of those rude disjointed<br/>
masses which their stripped sides now present, the third, all<br/>

it is, they have the barbarous look of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stonehenge </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>but then<br/>
they must have shone with the polish of an age already rich<br/>
in civilization, and that the more remarkable when it is<br/>
remembered that these granite blocks which furnish the<br/>
outside of the third and the inside of the first, must have<br/>
come all the way from the First Cataract. It also seems,<br/>
from Herodotus and others, that these smooth outsides were<br/>
covered with sculptures. Then you must build up or uncover<br/>
the massive tombs, now broken or choked with sand, so as<br/>
to restore the aspect of vast streets of tombs, like those on<br/>
the Appian Way, out of which the Great Pyramid would<br/>
rise, like a cathedral above smaller churches. Lastly, you<br/>
