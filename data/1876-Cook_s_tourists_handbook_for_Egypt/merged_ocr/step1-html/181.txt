played in the sculptures, the magnificence of Karnak greatly<br/>
increased. Monarch after monarch whom it were needless<br/>
to name here took a pride in adding to the glory of the<br/>
Theban temples and palaces. Rameses II., of whom we<br/>
have heard at Abydus, did much memorable work here also,<br/>
as will be pointed out in describing the monuments. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">few<br/>
</span>kings of lesser note succeeded, and then Rameses <span style="color: #ff0000;">III.</span>,<br/>
builder of the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeienet-Haboo</span>, finished the record<br/>
of Theban powers and splendour. Weak kings <span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>foreign possessions slipped from their grasp; and Thebes<br/>
became merely a vassal province to the new dynasties of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis </span>and Tanis, in the Delta. Its fall is as obscure as<br/>
its origin.<br/>
<br/>
When the dynasties of Lower Egypt were terminated by<br/>
Persian conquest, the great General Cambyses marched<br/>
southward to conquer Ethiopia. Turned back from the<br/>
intended exploit by famine, and irritated by the loss in the<br/>
desert sands of 50,000 men whom he had sent to conquer<br/>
the oases, he madly wreaked his vengeance on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>After burning and destroying the temples and palaces, he<br/>
plundered the tombs, and left the city in a ruined condition,<br/>
from which, however, it largely recovered. Theban commerce was utterly lost by the rapid growth of Alexandria<br/>
under the Ptolemies. These princes made some considerable<br/>
additions to the temples, <span style="color: #0000FF;">etc</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>in these additions the<br/>
influence of Greek art is, of course, very perceptible.<br/>
<br/>
"The reign of Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lathyrus</span>," says the author just<br/>
quoted, "is remarkable for the rebellion of Thebes, and for<br/>
the final consummation of her ruin. It had long been falling in trade and wealth, and had lost its superiority in arms;<br/>
but its temples, like so many citadels, its obelisks, its<br/>
colossal statues, and the tombs of its great kings, yet<br/>
remained, and with them the memory of its bygone glory.<br/>
