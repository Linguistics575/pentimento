<span>ITINERARY TO FIRST CATARACT. 19<br/>
<br/>
EIGHTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
In the morning passengers are conveyed in boats across the<br/>
river, where donkeys are waiting to take them to the Temple of<br/>
Denderah, about an hour's ride. This is the first monument of<br/>
the kind met with, and the impression it produces is never to<br/>
be forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
If the visit to Denderah is finished by noon, the boat may<br/>
reach Luxor the same evening, and anchor opposite the Temple<br/>
of Luxor. The portico of the temple is occupied by the office<br/>
of Mustapha Aga, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-known </span>and frequently-mentioned<br/>
English consul. He speaks English fluently, is always willing<br/>
and ready to oblige, and at once sends his servant on board<br/>
to welcome new arrivals and invite them to his house, where<br/>
coffee is always ready, and Fantasias may be organized.<br/>
