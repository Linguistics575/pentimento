<br/>
this temple: some display the warlike achievements of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span>, many are of the usual religious character.<br/>
From some have been derived valuable geographical facts as<br/>
to Ancient Egypt. There are some curious inscriptions on<br/>
the basement of the exterior of great importance; they<br/>
describe in detail the various chambers of this temple,<br/>
giving the dimensions, so that a means for accurately comparing ancient and modern measures is thus afforded. The<br/>
name of the architect is given as Ei-em-hotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oer-si-Phtah<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Imouthes</span>, grandson of Phtah). Another inscription states<br/>
that, with interruptions from war, the building took <span style="color: #ff0000;">ninetyfive </span>years to complete; this must refer to the actual construction of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">building-as </span>from the names of kings <span style="color: #0000FF;">mentioned </span>above, the buildings and decorations were not finished<br/>
in less than 170 years.<br/>
<br/>
The Great Court is first entered, about 140 feet by<br/>
I <span style="color: #0000FF;">50 </span>feet, and surrounded on three sides by thirty-two dissimilar <span style="color: #ff0000;">columns/ </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">PronaOS</span>, next entered, stretches<br/>
across the building, and contains immense pillars covered<br/>
with hieroglyphics. The Adytum contains twelve peculiar<br/>
columns bulging excessively at the centre; on each side are<br/>
four small rooms-one has a staircase leading to the terrace.<br/>
Several other courts and chambers are visited, and at the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">eXtreme </span>end of the building is the N aos, or sanctuary. The<br/>
place of deposit of the sacred emblem was not, as at<br/>
Denderah, a niche in the wall, but the grey granite monolith<br/>
now lying in one corner of the apartment; this was the<br/>
repository of the sacred hawk, emblem of Hor-Hat; the<br/>
monolith was made by Nectanebo <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, of the thirtieth dynasty,<br/>
for an older temple to which the present edifice succeeded.<br/>
There is an exquisite little chapel covered with very perfect<br/>
bas-reliefs on the north side of the building<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>this sanctuary<br/>
was connected with the New Year Ceremonies.<br/>
