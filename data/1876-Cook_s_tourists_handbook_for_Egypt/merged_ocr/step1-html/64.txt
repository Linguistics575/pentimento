<span>DYNASTIES. 47<br/>
<br/>
All asserted facts in the early history of Egypt must be<br/>
taken as, to a great extent, <span style="color: #0000FF;">conjectural </span>and uncertain. From<br/>
the brief records of Scripture, and the works of Herodotus,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus</span>, Eratosthenes, and especially the historical fragments of Manetho, joined to a laborious investigation of<br/>
the monuments and papyrus records, a history of Egypt<br/>
has been developed, although on many points, especially as<br/>
regards chronology, Egyptologists hold very diverse views.<br/>
<br/>
In describing the monuments of Egypt in subsequent<br/>
pages of this work, it will sometimes be necessary to refer<br/>
to some or other of the various dynasties of Egyptian<br/>
kings. It will therefore be desirable now, as briefly as possible, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">epitomise </span>these. It should be observed that the<br/>
epithet Pharaoh, applied in Scripture to any King of Egypt,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a generic name, similar to Caesar or Augustus, probably<br/>
from the Egyptian word Phra, the Sun.<br/>
<br/>
DYNASTI ES.<br/>
<br/>
I. Founded by Menes, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">5004 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span>. His capital was<br/>
This (Abydos), in Upper Egypt. There are no monuments of<br/>
this dynasty. Tetu, the second king, wrote on surgery, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hespu</span>, the fifth king, wrote sacred books.<br/>
<br/>
II. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">47 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">51 </span>mc.) Includes nine kings, who have left some<br/>
rude remains of their work. No. 2, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kekeu</span>, built the oldest<br/>
Pyramid in Egypt, that at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakk√©rah </span>(p. 125), and introduced<br/>
the symbolic worship of Apis. <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span>. 8, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sesocris</span>, is described<br/>
as a giant.<br/>
<br/>
III. (4449 mc.) Memphis was now the capital. Tombs,<br/>
dating from Snefru, the last king but one in this dynasty,<br/>
are adorned with pictures, and prove a high degree of<br/>
civilization.<br/>
<br/>
IV. (4235 <span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0</span>.) Memphis capital. Numerous monuments<br/>
<br/>
