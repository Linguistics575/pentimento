<br/>
Beyond is the King's Chamber, the chief chamber<br/>
of the Pyramid, 34 feet 3 inches in length, I7 feet I inch<br/>
broad, and 19 feet I inch in height. It contains the remains<br/>
of a lidless sarcophagus of red granite. If the mummy of<br/>
King Cheops ever rested <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>it, and the Pyramid was really<br/>
built to guard that mummy, it cannot be said that the idea<br/>
has been successfully worked out. The Pyramid is there, but<br/>
the great king's remains <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>disappeared-how or when,<br/>
none can <span style="color: #0000FF;">say</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Piazzi Smith, and others who unite in his views, assert<br/>
that <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'so-called </span>sarcophagus <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>really a "<span style="color: #0000FF;">coffer</span>," designed<br/>
to perpetuate a standard measure of capacity to all time, and<br/>
exactly equivalent to the laver of the Hebrews, or four quarters of English measure.<br/>
<br/>
Above the King<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s </span>Chamber are two or three other rooms,<br/>
apparently only constructed to lessen the immense weight <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the upper part of the Pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
What the Pyramids really were intended for, and who<br/>
built them, are questions over which there has been an<br/>
immense amount of argument and conjecture. Egyptologists are generally agreed that they are royal tombs, reared<br/>
by successive stages, as above described, in the lifetime of<br/>
the monarch, and at his death cased over with polished<br/>
stone, and closed up. The Great Pyramid is assigned to<br/>
Cheops by Herodotus, who tells a long story about the<br/>
making <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the causeway for the transfer of materials in<br/>
ten years, and the building of the Pyramid in twenty more,<br/>
100,000 men being employed, and relieved at intervals of<br/>
three months. Diodorus, Pliny, and others tell similar<br/>
stories, but all written record of the Great Pyramid is, to<br/>
say the least, doubtful. Cheops is considered to be identical<br/>
with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoofoo</span>, third monarch of the fourth dynasty, who<br/>
reigned over Egypt between twenty-four and forty-two <span style="color: #ff0000;">cen<br/>
