<br/>
N ow there are good stone houses, macadamized roads, and<br/>
beautiful-flower gardens in full growth.<br/>
<br/>
The foundation of Ismailia dates from <span style="color: #0000FF;">1862</span>, it has now<br/>
5000 inhabitants divided amongst the French, Greek, and<br/>
Arab Quarters. The harbour was a grand sight when<br/>
all nations met at the inauguration of the Canal. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">waterworks </span>connected with the Fresh-Water Canal, with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pumping </span>engines, cascades, reservoirs, etc., are very interesting. The town contains a fair hotel, a French bazaar, a<br/>
promenade, a villa of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>, good sea-bathing accommodation, etc. The heights of El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Guisr </span>are worth visiting<br/>
for the view, if the opportunity occurs. A botanist, sportsman, or Egyptologist would find this place an enjoyable<br/>
stopping place for a short time. Pelusium, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoii</span>, Pithom,<br/>
Rameses, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hero6polis</span>, are (whatever is left of them)<br/>
within easy distance. "Persians, Greeks, and Romans<br/>
alike left their marks on this district. Here, too, was the<br/>
Goshen of the land of Israel. It would be interesting also<br/>
to ascertain how far, into what is now desert, reached the<br/>
land that was then cultivated."<br/>
<br/>
The author of The Rob Roy on the Nile, says, "Ismailia<br/>
is like a hothouse without the glass, and all the life in it is<br/>
exotic. The sun's heat and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>'s cool water force the<br/>
arid sand into <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tropical </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">verdure</span>. Embosomed in this are<br/>
French <span style="color: #0000FF;">cafés </span>and billards, with Arab huts and camels; the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">signboards </span>on booths in Greek, Turkish, Spanish, and<br/>
American; <span style="color: #0000FF;">ate'lz'ers </span>resounding with hammer and <span style="color: #ff0000;">cogwheel</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>and tents full of <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-dressed </span>savages <span style="color: #0000FF;">chaffering </span>uproariously<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>and boulevards thronged by the second rate fashion of a<br/>
F rench town, planted, and growing fast too, in the veritable<br/>
desert. Beside it lie the shores of the Lake Timsah, the<br/>
'Crocodile Lake,' which had a few pools when the Canal<br/>
was begun, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>now is filled with brackish water<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
