<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>32 THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>enters Egypt at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">w</span>), near which is<br/>
the First Cataract (p. 189), that of Assouan, which many travellers make the boundary of their Egyptian explorations.<br/>
<br/>
From this point, the Nile is generally a tranquil, winding river, giving life to a strip of land often not more than<br/>
ten miles wide, hemmed in by scorching deserts and barren<br/>
mountains, yet glowing with beauty and fertility, and replete<br/>
with the most magnificent ruins on the face of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Anciently, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>reached the sea by seven mouths;<br/>
all are now closed except those of Rosetta and Damietta.<br/>
The western (Rosetta) mouth is 1,800 feet wide, and about<br/>
five feet deep in dry seasons; the eastern mouth is only half<br/>
as wide, but is generally two or three feet deeper. The<br/>
Delta of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>commences a little N. of Cairo, about 90<br/>
miles from the sea, and is about 85 miles wide at its<br/>
broadest <span style="color: #0000FF;">part</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>'The Annual Rise and Subsidence of the Waters of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>has been already alluded to (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The greatest breadth of the Nile is about 2,000 feet, and<br/>
its average current about three miles per hour. <span style="color: #0000FF;">From<br/>
</span>Assouan to Cairo, <span style="color: #ff0000;">580 </span>miles, the banks are completely<br/>
covered with all sorts of vegetables raised by the ceaseless<br/>
industry of the inhabitants.<br/>

BIBLE ASSOCIATIONS.<br/>
<br/>
The river <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>is frequently mentioned in Scripture by<br/>
various descriptive names, as the river, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flood</span>, etc. It is<br/>
sometimes called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sihor</span>, meaning the black or turbid river.<br/>
In the margin of this stream floated the fragile ark wherein<br/>
the babe Moses lay-its waters were turned into blood when<br/>
Pharaoh's heart was hardened-and by its banks the infant<br/>
Saviour may have dwelt. Ezekiel denounces Pharaoh as<br/>
