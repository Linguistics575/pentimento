<span style="color: #ff0000;">A. </span>Statues.<br/>
<br/>
"In the main vestibule, crowded with precious relics, I<br/>
can only notice those extraordinary specimens of the oldest<br/>
Egyptian art, which are to be seen nowhere else in the world.<br/>
The eye is at once drawn to two life-sized statues of painted<br/>
limestone, which from their pedestals seem to overlook and<br/>
guard the later remains. They are nude, save a cloth, folded<br/>
in front like an apron, which falls from the hips to the knees.<br/>
The arms and legs are rather <span style="color: #0000FF;">stithy </span>modelled, but quite free<br/>
from the conventional rigidity of Egyptian statues. Indeed,<br/>
the hands, feet, and joints show a careful study, not only of<br/>
nature, but also of the individual. The trunks are excellently<br/>
rendered in their main masses, like the half-finished clay<br/>
model of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>modern sculptor. But the heads are simply<br/>
amazing in their correct embodiment of life and character.<br/>
In them there is no prescribed solidity of expression, in<br/>
closed lips, steadfast eyes, and hands resting flatly on the<br/>
knees, as in the statues chiselled ten thousand years later.<br/>
They beam with a frank, free, naive apprehension of nature,<br/>
and exhibit the activity of an art which is just about to overcome the last stubborn resistance of the material. There is<br/>
no representation of motion, as in the crowning <span style="color: #0000FF;">days </span>of<br/>
Greek sculpture; the figures stand or sit, but you feel that a<br/>
slight effort <span style="color: #0000FF;">would </span>enable them to rise or walk."<br/>
