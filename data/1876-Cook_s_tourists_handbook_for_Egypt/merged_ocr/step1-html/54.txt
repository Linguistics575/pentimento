The chief pursuit of the people of Egypt is agriculture,<br/>
and it is this which furnishes the chief exports. The total<br/>
value of the exports for <span style="color: #0000FF;">1871 </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">810,400,000</span>. Cotton<br/>
and wheat are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">two </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span>articles of export; beans, peas,<br/>
lentils, barley, and dates are also of considerable importance.<br/>
Sugar is an increasing production of Egypt, and is gradually<br/>
taking a higher rank among the exports of the country.<br/>
Great Britain takes about <span style="color: #ff0000;">lf </span>per cent. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>goods sent out<br/>
from Egypt. There is a considerable caravan trade with the<br/>
interior of Africa; there are considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufactories </span>for<br/>
firearms, and cotton, silk, and woollen goods, mostly founded<br/>
and directed by the Government.<br/>

RAI <span style="color: #ff0000;">LWAYS </span>IN EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
The first railway was opened in Egypt about twenty<br/>
years ago, from Alexandria to Cairo. A line from Cairo to<br/>
Suez soon followed; this had to be abandoned in consequence<br/>
of the difficulty of supplying intermediate stations with<br/>
water.<br/>
<br/>
A new line was constructed, following the course of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">resh </span>Water Canal, which conveys the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>water to Ismailia and Suez, and also supplies Port Said by pipes fifty miles<br/>
in length. The railway is connected with the main line at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Benha</span>, so that Peninsular and Oriental through passengers<br/>
cross to Suez without going to Cairo. The Suez Canal is,<br/>
however, decreasing the patronage of the through railway<br/>
route.<br/>
<br/>
The Delta is now a network of railways as well as canals.<br/>
From Zagazig <span style="color: #0000FF;">there </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>a branch to Mansoorah, and then<br/>
from the adjacent <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taikah </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damietta</span>, also another from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tantah </span>to Damietta. Another line leads to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dessook</span>, on<br/>
