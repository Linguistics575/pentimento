Luxor is a market town, deriving its name from words<br/>
signifying "The Palaces." A great trade is carried on here<br/>
in antiquities, more or less ancient. Extreme caution is<br/>
necessary in purchasing these, even from vendors of official<br/>
position <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">undoubted </span>respectability.<br/>
<br/>
The road from Luxor to Karnak lies over a grassy plain,<br/>
sprinkled with scanty remnants of the ancient city. "We<br/>
rode," says the author of The Crescent and the Cross, "along<br/>
a wide plain covered with coarse grass, and varied by some<br/>
gloomy little lakes and acacia shrubs, when, at the end of an<br/>
hour, our guide <span style="color: #ff0000;">reined </span>in his horse, and pointed with his<br/>
spear towards the south. There lay Karnak-darkening a<br/>
whole horizon with portals, and pyramids, and palaces. We<br/>
passed under a noble archway, and entered a long avenue of<br/>
sphinxes<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>all their heads were broken off, but their pedestals<br/>
remained unmoved since the time of Joseph. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>have<br/>
been a noble sight in the palmy days of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-that </span>avenue<br/>
of two hundred enormous statues, terminated by that temple.<br/>
Yet this was only one of many<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>at least seven others, with<br/>
similar porticoes and archways, led from this stupendous<br/>
edifice. We rode through half-a-mile of sphinxes, and then<br/>
arrived at the temple, the splendour of which no words can<br/>
describe.<br/>
<br/>
"A glorious portal opened into a vast court, crowded<br/>
with a perfect forest of the most magnificent columns, <span style="color: #ff0000;">thirtysix </span>feet in circumference, covered with hieroglyphics, and<br/>
surmounted by <span style="color: #ff0000;">capitals- </span>all of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ditferent </span>patterns and<br/>
richly painted. <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o </span>two persons agree on the number<br/>
of these apparently countless columns-some make it<br/>
amount to <span style="color: #ff0000;">134</span>, others to <span style="color: #0000FF;">160</span>; the central ones measure<br/>
<br/>
66 feet in height, exclusive of the pedestals and <span style="color: #0000FF;">abacus.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
