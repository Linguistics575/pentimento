<br/>
miles from Cairo and <span style="color: #ff0000;">f </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">30 </span>from the coast of the Mediterranean. It is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-built </span>town, and a walk through the<br/>
bazaar is very interesting, and the scene on the quay<br/>
is usually very lively.<br/>
<br/>
Assouan was formerly known as Syene. Few traces of<br/>
its early Egyptian history are recognizable. From the<br/>
granite quarries of the neighbourhood, the obelisks and other<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">monolith</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of the cities of Upper Egypt were procured. In<br/>
one quarry there is an obelisk with one side still adhering to<br/>
its native rocks. A Ptolemaic temple has been recently<br/>
discovered. But though Syene was a notable garrison town<br/>
in Greek and Roman times, even of that epoch scarcely<br/>
anything remains. The ruins at Assouan, and also in<br/>
the adjacent island of Elephantine, are mostly Saracenic.<br/>
<br/>
Syene was celebrated amongst Greek and Roman geographers and philosophers as being a place where, at the<br/>
summer solstice, the sun shone perpendicularly, and some of<br/>
the measurements of the earth, by Eratosthenes and others,<br/>
were based on this supposed fact. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Modern </span>observation<br/>
proves either that these philosophers were wrong in their<br/>
facts, or else that the position of the earth, and consequently<br/>
the boundary of the tropics, has altered since their time<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>Juvenal lived at Syene for a time, being banished hither by<br/>
the Emperor Domitian.<br/>
<br/>
In the prophecies of the downfall of Egypt the Prophet<br/>
speaks of the "tower of Syene" as marking the southern<br/>
limit of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">kingdom-has</span>, "from Migdol to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Syene </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>was<br/>
a similar expression to the customary Hebrew phrase, "from<br/>
Dan to Beersheba." (See Ezek. xxix. <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>and xxx. 6, taking<br/>
the marginal reading in both cases.)<br/>
<br/>
In the vicinity of Assouan may be seen several remains<br/>
of Saracenic walls, and numerous tombs of sheikhs and<br/>
saints.<br/>
