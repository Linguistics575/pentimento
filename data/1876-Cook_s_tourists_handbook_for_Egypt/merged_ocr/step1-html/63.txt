imitation of radiance by the variegated voussoir, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">expression </span>of the sweep of the desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the barred red line upon the<br/>
wall, the starred <span style="color: #ff0000;">inshedding </span>of light through his vaulted<br/>
roof, and all the endless fantasy of abstract line, were still<br/>
in the power of his ardent and fantastic spirit. Mu'ch he<br/>
achieved<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and yet, in the effort of his over-taxed invention,<br/>
restrained from its proper food, he made his architecture a<br/>
glittering vacillation of undisciplined enchantment, and left<br/>
the lustre of its edifices to wither like a startling dream,<br/>
whose beauty we may indeed feel, and whose instruction we<br/>
may receive, but must smile at its inconsistency, and mourn<br/>
over its evanescence."<br/>

H <span style="color: #ff0000;">ISTORY</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The foundation of the ancient kingdom of Egypt is lost<br/>
in the mists of remote antiquity. It was undoubtedly one<br/>
of the most early civilized of the nations of the earth, and<br/>
perhaps the first to acquire a fixed social and political system.<br/>
<br/>
The History of Egypt naturally divides itself into Six<br/>
Periods-the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharaonic</span>, or native Egyptian, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Persian</span>, the period of the Ptolemies, the Roman, the<br/>
Arabian, and the Turkish.<br/>
<br/>
The Pharaonic Period is.also subdivided into <span style="color: #0000FF;">Three </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Em</span>.<br/>
pires. The Ancient Empire lasted from the foundation<br/>
of the kingdom by Memes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3004 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">me</span>. (according to<br/>
Mariette) to the end of the Tenth Dynasty, a period of<br/>
nineteen centuries.<br/>
<br/>
The Middle Empire includes from the Eleventh to<br/>
the Seventeenth Dynasty, a period of <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">361 </span>years, terminating with the expulsion of the Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings.<br/>
<br/>
The New Empire comprises a period of about <span style="color: #0000FF;">1400<br/>
</span>years, from the re-establishment of the native monarchy by<br/>
Amosis to the conquest of Egypt by Persia in <span style="color: #0000FF;">350 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span>.<br/>
