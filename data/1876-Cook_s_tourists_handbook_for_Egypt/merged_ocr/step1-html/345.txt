<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">every </span>engagement of this kind we will employ none <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>the most<br/>
trustworthy dragomans, who will do justice to the travellers as well as to<br/>
ourselves. A graduated scale of charges, according to the number of party,<br/>
is adopted<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and we can take engagements for Desert travelling nearly as<br/>
cheap as for Palestine. But the details <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">conditions </span>of such tours are<br/>
best settled by private negotiation, and we are ready to go into them <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>

<br/>
Our reference to these tours in connection with this series of itineraries<br/>
will be very brief. For eight years the agency for Nile tours has been<br/>
committed to us by the Khedivie Administration. During that time constant improvements have been made in the service; steamers have been<br/>
fitted with deck saloons, and the sleepi berths greatly improved.<br/>
The food supplies have been under our contra to a great extent, and will be<br/>
emphatically so in the future, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>intend to exercise more rigid regulations<br/>
for the interest and comfort of voyagers. Contractors, dragomans, and<br/>
servants of every grade will be most vigilantly watched and rigidly dealt<br/>
with if <span style="color: #ff0000;">any </span>incivility or inattention is shown to <span style="color: #0000FF;">passen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ers</span>. Last <span style="color: #ff0000;">seasou's<br/>
</span>extension of <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrangements </span>for the Second Cataract <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>be improved, and<br/>
we <span style="color: #ff0000;">ho </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e </span>ere long to see a class of steamers on the Nile that will ensure <span style="color: #ff0000;">a<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">large </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">assenger </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">servtce </span>of steamers commences in November, and Nile trips <span style="color: #0000FF;">my<br/>
</span>precede or follow tours to Palestine as most convenient to the travellers who<br/>
wish to embrace the two objects in one visit to the East. The trips to the<br/>
F irst Cataract and back occupy twenty days, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen </span>more are allowed<br/>
for trips to the Second <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cataract</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>DAHABEAHS can also be secured on the best terms for all who desire<br/>
them, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragomans </span>and other necessary servants and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bod </span>supplies can be<br/>
arranged <span style="color: #0000FF;">b </span>us on the best terms. Our <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>at Cairo, on the grounds of<br/>
Shepheard s Hotel, <span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span>excellent facilities for the management of this<br/>
business. Early application is necessary to secure the best boats and the<br/>
best men.<br/>
