it shows to most advantage. And when this was all perfect,<br/>
when its avenues opened in vistas upon the noble temples<br/>
and palaces of Sesostris, upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goumou</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medeenet-Haboo</span>, and<br/>
Luxor<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>when its courts were paced by gorgeous priestly<br/>
pageants, and busy life swarmed on a river flowing between<br/>
banks of palaces, like those of Venice magnified a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hundredfold-when </span>all this was in its prime, no wonder that its fame<br/>
spread even over the barbarian world, and found immortality<br/>

</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>miles from Luxor), pop. 7000, is a place<br/>
