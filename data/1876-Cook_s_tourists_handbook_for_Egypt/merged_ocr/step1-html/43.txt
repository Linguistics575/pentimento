<span>26 INTRODUCTORY.<br/>
<br/>
are paintings of the highest finish, in colours as vivid as on the<br/>
day on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which'they </span>were executed. The smaller temple, called<br/>
"Bayt-el-Welly," or "House of the Saint," lies against a rocky<br/>
hill to the right, and is partly cut out of the rock. Although<br/>
difficult of access, it is worth while to attempt the ascent, as the<br/>
temple contains excellent paintings, and the sculptures, recording<br/>
the battles of Rameses, are perfect.<br/>
<br/>
THIRD DAY.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller will pass and visit successively Dendoor, 12<br/>
miles from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kaltibsheh</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kirscheh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>miles further, which<br/>
have cavern temples of some magnitude<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>The same day Dakkeh is reached, where there is a temple<br/>
supposed to have been built by the Ethiopian King, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ergamuns<br/>
</span>a part of it is in a very good state of preservation. The sculptures and hieroglyphics are extremely good, and in admirable<br/>
condition.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>steamer proceeds for some time yet, and possibly<br/>
reaches Maharraka, nine miles from Dakkeh; here is a small<br/>
temple of which but two rows of columns remain entire.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">FOURTH </span>DAY.<br/>
<br/>
(20 miles.) Arrive at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saboa </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wady-Sabdah</span>, "the Valley<br/>
of the Lions." It has little to indicate its former splendour.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>temple of Rameses II. is nearly buried in the sand. Two<br/>
statues, however, remain in sight, which may induce a short<br/>
visit.<br/>
<br/>
Arrive at Korosko, 12 miles further, and about 100 miles<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>. It is from here that the great high road stretches<br/>
across the Desert to Shendy and Sennaar. Most of the caravans<br/>
for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartoom </span>start from Korosko. Behind the village is a peak<br/>
called "Awes-el-Guarany," the top of which is held sacred by<br/>
the natives, and is a point of pilgrimage, as being the tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of<br/>
</span>the Saint from whom the mountain derives its name. The<br/>
steamer remains at Korosko all night, to enable the passengers<br/>
to accomplish the ascent of this peak, a rather difficult task,<br/>
<br/>
