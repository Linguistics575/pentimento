<span>182 THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
Passing El Helleh (E.) and the mounds of Kom Ayr<br/>
(W.), the last Pyramid within the limits of Egypt is seen,<br/>
that of El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kodla </span>(W.)<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>it is a limestone structure about<br/>
sixty feet square, and is now in a very ruinous <span style="color: #0000FF;">condition-what </span>remains is under forty feet in height. El Kom-el-Ahmar<br/>
(W.) is the site of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hieraconopolis</span>, the City of the Hawks,<br/>
dating from' the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osirtasen </span>I.<br/>
<br/>
El Kab (<span style="color: #0000FF;">52 </span>miles from Luxor) is celebrated for its<br/>
grottoes and other remains of the ancient City of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eileithyias</span>,<br/>
the City of Lucina<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>these <span style="color: #0000FF;">grottoes </span>are covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">paintings </span>in colours still vivid-there are excellent delineation, of<br/>
scenes of domestic life, agricultural labour and sports, banquets, fishing, fowling, and funeral processions. The domestic<br/>
life and rural economy of the ancient Egyptians can be well<br/>
studied here. There are also two or three temples<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>one<br/>
built by Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, another of Ptolemaic origin, consecrated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lucena </span>by Euergates II., with some additions<br/>
by Cleopatra; and a third dedicated to the same goddess<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amunoph </span>m., the decorative pictures in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">latter<br/>
</span>temple are good. Natron (sub-carbonate of soda), an<br/>
Egyptian article of commerce, is found in the vicinity.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Eileithyias </span>was a fortress guarding the entrance of a<br/>
gorge from which wild Arab tribes used to descend upon<br/>
the Nile Valley. Remains of ramparts, .dating from the<br/>
Ancient Empire, are still visible.<br/>
<br/>
Edfou (W.) is a short distance from the river side. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>the middle <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the village of Edfou stands its noted<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Temple..<br/>
<br/>
</span>In general plan <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>arrangement this temple is very<br/>
similar to that at Denderah, and the uses to which the<br/>
various portions of the building were applied would seem to<br/>
have been the same. But the temple at Edfou is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most<br/>
</span>perfect specimen of an Egyptian temple <span style="color: #ff0000;">extant </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-more </span>com<br/>
