<br/>
</span>Egyptian fortifications are seen on the opposite side of the<br/>
river. Dakkeh was the head-quarters of the renowned<br/>
Ethiopian magi.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Koortee </span>(W.) A few ruins are discernible here.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Maharraker </span>(W.) has a picturesque little temple. All is<br/>
overthrown except two rows of columns.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mirsfdy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sahodah/ </span>or Valley of the Lions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called<br/>
</span>from the dromos of sphinxes once leading <span style="color: #ff0000;">up-to </span>a temple of<br/>
Rameses, constructed of granite, with the sanctuary excavated in the solid rock. The avenue has almost entirely <span style="color: #0000FF;">disappeared</span>. Of the temple, the two towers of the pylon, the<br/>
Osiride columns of the area, and the interior chambers, still<br/>
remain. Here the Arabic language ceases to be spoken, and<br/>
the Nubian only is in use.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Korosko </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span>), though a considerable place of traffic, is<br/>
scarcely even a village. There are a few scattered huts along<br/>
the foot of the mountain, in a green oasis of a valley.<br/>
Black, frowning precipices enclose the gorge through <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>lies the desert route to Shendy and Sennaar. This is a starting-point for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khartoum</span>. The route, 200 miles in length, is<br/>
one of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">worst_in </span>the desert-water being only procurable<br/>
at one stopping-place, and wild Bedouins very troublesome.<br/>
The mountain is of a most curious shape, and is of volcanic<br/>
origin. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">peak </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Awes-el-Guarany </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>is held sacred by<br/>
the natives, and is a point of pilgrimage as being the tomb<br/>
of the saint from whom the mountain derives its name.<br/>
There are innumerable tablets and inscriptions here <span style="color: #0000FF;">recording </span>the names of pilgrims. Sometimes those of one family<br/>
through many generations. The steamer stops long enough<br/>
to allow for the ascent of the peak to be made-rather a<br/>
difficult task, as the steep path is strewn with <span style="color: #0000FF;">volcanic </span>remains. The journey will however well repay the fatigue,<br/>
more especially if sunrise or sunset can be seen at the same<br/>
time. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">VieW </span>is magnificent, comprehending the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile<br/>
