<br/>
Zagazig is a junction station. There is a branch line<br/>
from here to Benha (p. 80), on the Alexandria and Cairo<br/>
Railway ,--passing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mineh-el-Ganah</span>, a growing commercial<br/>
town, with extensive steam mills, and lofty chimneys in the<br/>
midst of an important cotton district.<br/>
<br/>
Here also is the junction for the railway to Mansoorah<br/>
and Damietta (see p. 238).<br/>
<br/>
"Zagazig is a place of great commercial interest<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
country around occupying the eastern shoulder of the Nile<br/>
Delta, and watered by the Pelusian branch of that river, is<br/>
one vast plain of cotton and edra (maize), intersected with<br/>
canals, and interspersed with groves of acacia, above which<br/>
waved the date tree and its massive bunches of yellow fruit.<br/>
Besides a quantity of seed and corn, Zagazig produced in one<br/>
year over <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50,000 </span>bales of cotton, and owns thirty steam<br/>
power cleaning and pressing cotton <span style="color: #0000FF;">mills</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in fact, the place<br/>
seems fully occupied with industrious people."<br/>
<br/>
At Zagazig there is usually a stoppage of half an <span style="color: #0000FF;">hour </span>or<br/>
so, which can be well employed in the adjacent restaurant.<br/>
The population of the town is 38,000. Several Europeans<br/>
reside here. There is nothing to detain the traveller unless<br/>
he wishes to make it his head-quarters during an exploration<br/>
of Bubastis (ro miles <span style="color: #ff0000;">so</span>, or whilst shooting in the marshes<br/>
at a short distance from the town.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Zagazig the railway follows the course of the<br/>
Sweet-Water Canal, which supplies the stations and<br/>
towns on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>Canal with drinking water. Along the<br/>
banks of this canal cultivation is re-establishing itself as it did<br/>
of old, when the Bubastis Canal was in existence. The grit<br/>
or siliceous sand of the desert contains a large quantity of<br/>
argillaceous matter, which only requires a sufficiency of<br/>
<br/>
