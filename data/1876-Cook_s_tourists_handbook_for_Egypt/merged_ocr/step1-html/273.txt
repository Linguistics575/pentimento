<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">052 </span>THE DESERT<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Of the three routes leading from <span style="color: #ff0000;">WMy-ed-Dehseh </span>to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghurundel</span>, the central route is mostly chosen, through<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wardtin</span>, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wtidy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Amérah</span>.<br/>
In the latter valley are seen the group of rocks called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hagarel-Rekkab</span>, or Stone of the Rider.<br/>
<br/>
Ain <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hawarah </span>(the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fountain </span>of Destruction) is usually<br/>
identified with Marah, where the bitter waters were made<br/>
sweet; a few stunted palms and tamarisks surround a stone<br/>
well, filled with drifted sand, but still containing water.<br/>
The small cultivated plot called the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Engee-el-Fool </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C </span>the<br/>
Bean F <span style="color: #ff0000;">ield</span>") is passed, and soon afterwards the traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">enters<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Niriidy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghurundel</span>, which has a beautiful stream<br/>
running <span style="color: #0000FF;">through </span>it. Compared with the desolate scenery<br/>
round, this valley seems a marvel of beauty. A fresh supply<br/>
of sweet water is procured for the caravan <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>this place,<br/>
which is doubtless the Elim of which the Bible narrative<br/>
states that "there were twelve wells of water, and threescore<br/>
and ten palm-trees, and they encamped there by the waters."<br/>
The acacia or shittim-wood of the Bible grows here, and is<br/>
often met with in pursuing the journey. It is a tough<br/>
gnarled and thorny tree, adapting itself to various situations,<br/>
low and flat on the open desert, and more outspread in <span style="color: #0000FF;">sheltered </span>spots.<br/>
<br/>
The Baths of Pharaoh, at the mouth of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghurundel</span>, near the sea, are some hot sulphur springs said<br/>
by Arab traditions to arise from the watery grave of Pharaoh<br/>
and his host. Above the hot springs towers the mountain<br/>
Jebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hammém </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharoon</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500 </span>feet high.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Waidy </span>Useit, which is reached after crossing the<br/>
plain of El Gargal, has a fountain, and palm trees are<br/>
numerous. The rocks are very fine, some exactly resemble<br/>
fortresses and battlements. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Witdy </span>Ethal and the<br/>
mouth of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shebeikah </span>are next passed. Here a<br/>
