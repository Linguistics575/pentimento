<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">18 </span>INTRODUCTORY.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Beni-Hassan </span>are reached in half an hour. The northern grottoes<br/>
are high up on a hill to the left, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Speos </span>Artemidos<br/>
straight on in a valley eastward-both ought to be visited.<br/>
Towards noon the excursion is ended, and the steamer starts<br/>
again. A few hours' course brings in sight the mountain<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel-abou-faydah</span>," and towards evening <span style="color: #ff0000;">Manfaloot</span>, a little<br/>
town of some importance, is reached.<br/>
<br/>
FIFTH DAY<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Some time before mid-day, arrive at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asyoot</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assioot</span>, the<br/>
residence of a Pasha, the Inspector-General to Upper Egypt, of<br/>
which <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assioot </span>is the capital. The remainder of the day is<br/>
devoted to a visit to the large bazaar, and the hills behind the<br/>
town, which afford a splendid view of the Nile Valley. A very<br/>
important market is held at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assioot</span>. Before the abolition of<br/>
slavery, it was the principal slave market; but, minus this peculiarity, it offers still, at the present time, interesting features for<br/>
the observer.<br/>
<br/>
SIXTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
If necessary the ship is coaled at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sooh√©g</span>, and Girgeh is<br/>
generally reached in the evening; there is nothing of interest in<br/>
this place, one of the dirtiest on the Nile. Girgeh, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bellianeh</span>,<br/>
a small town about ten miles higher up<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>is the starting point for<br/>
visiting Abydos. This visit, however, is better postponed, and<br/>
made on the return journey, starting from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bellianeh</span>. These<br/>
ruins are so grand and magnificent that they cannot lose any of<br/>
their charm and novelty, even after <span style="color: #ff0000;">Karnak </span>has been seen.<br/>
<br/>
SEVENTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the visit to Abydos for the return journey, Keneh is<br/>
reached towards evening, and if still early enough, this important<br/>
place may be visited before the night. The best porous jugs<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">gargoulets </span>for filtering the N ile water are made <span style="color: #ff0000;">here'<br/>
</span>Keneh is also celebrated for its dates, and was once noted for<br/>
its dancing girls. The latter, it appears, have now removed to<br/>
Luxor, a place of greater attraction to visitors<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
