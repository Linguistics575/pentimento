columns of Roman workmanship; there are also numerous baths. At a little distance various handsome buildings<br/>

the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>, built on a beautiful site about ten years ago.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive</span>'s sugar factories at this town, five in number,<br/>
are unrivalled in the world for their substantial character<br/>
and perfection of <span style="color: #0000FF;">appliances</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the chimneys tower to a<br/>
