<span>domestic animals. The hippopotamus, once the most remarkable of Egyptian animals, is now only seen in the<br/>
more southern districts of the Nile, in which locality the<br/>
giraffe is also occasionally met with.<br/>
<br/>
Of vultures, which are common, there are three <span style="color: #0000FF;">species </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i<br/>
</span>one kind often measures as much as 15 feet across the<br/>
wings. Eagles, falcons, hawks, buzzards, kites, crows, larks,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">linnets</span>, and sparrows are all found in Egypt. The ibis was<br/>
held sacred by the ancient Egyptians, and has given occasion for several legends. The ostrich is occasionally to be<br/>
seen in the desert parts of the country. Pigeons and poultry<br/>
abound.<br/>
<br/>
Of Egyptian reptiles there are several kinds, the most<br/>
famous is the celebrated crocodile of the Nile. This scaly<br/>
monster has abandoned the lower portions of the river, and<br/>
even in Upper Egypt is becoming more and more rare.<br/>
The smaller saurians, called monitors, are very abundant,<br/>
and are often pointed out as crocodiles to ingenuous visitors.<br/>
Lizards and tortoises may be seen in plenty <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>also snakes, of<br/>
which latter the cerastes and the asp are really to be dreaded<br/>
for their venomous properties.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fish </span>are plentiful in the Nile and in the Egyptian lakes,<br/>
and are much used as an article of food. Some travellers<br/>
who have fished in the Nile report that the fish were exceedingly ugly, and equally unpalatable. The chief varieties<br/>
-are <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>binny, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>barbel <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>the latus, a species of perch<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
bayad, <span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span>siluris; the Chromis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nilotica</span>, and the Mormyrus<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Oxyrhynchus</span>.<br/>
