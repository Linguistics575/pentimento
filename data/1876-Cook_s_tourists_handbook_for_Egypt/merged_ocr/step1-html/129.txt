<span>I "EGYPT.<br/>
<br/>
of strange people is seen<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>acts of cruelty and suffering are<br/>
wrought, and the groans of an enslaved people rise on every<br/>
hand. But from yonder Island of Roda, by the side of<br/>
which sweeps that ancient river, there rises amidst this chorus<br/>
of sorrowful groans the wail of a helpless infant lying in<br/>
his ark of <span style="color: #0000FF;">bulrushes</span>, who shall lead forth these bondmen<br/>
from their prison-house. And now the day of deliverance<br/>
dawns<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the purposes of God are being accomplished, pride<br/>
is being humbled, prophecy is being fulfilled, and the sounds<br/>
of fleeing fugitives and chasing armies fill the air; then a<br/>
space of silence, succeeded by the noise of meeting waters<br/>
and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">death-shrieks </span>of drowning thousands. And now<br/>
the wail of that infant has changed into the strong voice of<br/>
that mighty leader; and the groans of those slaves have<br/>
changed into that song of triumph,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'I </span>will sing unto the<br/>
Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and the<br/>
rider He hath thrown into the sea.' And now visions of<br/>
Persian hordes, Macedonian armies, Roman legions, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">turbaned </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Turks </span>pass along; the tramp of mighty armies<br/>
beats upon the ear, the roar of a thousand battles thrills the<br/>
soul<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the prophecy is <span style="color: #0000FF;">fulfilled</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>There shall be no more a<br/>
prince in Egypt, neither shall it exalt itself any more above<br/>
the nations; for I will diminish them, that they shall no<br/>
more rule over the nations.' And thus the vision from the<br/>
Pyramid vanishes, one's poetic dream ends at the sound of<br/>
' backsheesh,' spoken in an undertone by the squatting<br/>
Arabs who are by our side, and who dream of nothing but<br/>
' backsheesh.' <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Interior of the Great Pyramid was forcibly Opened<br/>
to view by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Caliirh-el-Mamoon</span>, a thousand years ago, in<br/>
820 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Am</span>. He was the son of the well-known friend of our<br/>
schooldays, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haroun-el-Raschid</span>, and was incited by the hope<br/>
of discovering treasure. The passage made by his workmen<br/>
