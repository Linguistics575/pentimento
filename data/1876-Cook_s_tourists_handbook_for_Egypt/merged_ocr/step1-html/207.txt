<br/>
The Island of Elephantine faces Assouan. One<br/>
of its Arabic names signifies "Island of Flowers." Whilst<br/>
at Assouan the Egyptian element predominates in the<br/>
population, at Elephantine the traveller finds himself<br/>
surrounded by Nubians.<br/>
<br/>
"The Nubians," says Bartlett, "are tall and slender<br/>
in person-far less massive in build than the Theban Arabs.<br/>
There is something of elegance in their general appearance,<br/>
and the cast of their features is rather intellectual. They<br/>
are of a soft dusky black or bronze tint, with a very fine skin,<br/>
and they delight to oil their bodies, and to load their sable<br/>
ringlets with unguents anything but odoriferous to the<br/>
European nose. Their women have often elicited the <span style="color: #ff0000;">rap </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">r<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">turous </span>remarks of travellers, in whose eyes they move about<br/>
like so many sable Venuses, realizing the description of our<br/>
Mother Eve, as being, when' <span style="color: #0000FF;">unadorned</span>, adorned the most,'<br/>
their sole costume, in this serene and glowing climate, being<br/>
an apron round the middle, and somewhat of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">slenderest</span>,<br/>
too, composed of loose thongs of leather, decorated with<br/>
small shells."<br/>
<br/>
Elephantine is now a picturesque island of mingled palm<br/>
groves and mounds of ruins, with very few remains of its<br/>
former importance and grandeur. Pharaonic, Persian, Greek,<br/>
Roman splendour-all is gone. About seventy years ago,<br/>
when the Egyptian Commission visited the island, there was<br/>
a <span style="color: #ff0000;">half-demolisbed </span>edifice, called the Temple of the North,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>another admirably proportioned building called the<br/>
Temple of the South, built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amunoph </span>III. The stone<br/>
of these two temples was used by the Governor of<br/>
Assouan in 1822, to build a palace, and all that remains now<br/>
is a badly-executed statue of Osiris, bearing the name of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Menephthah </span>(son of Rameses <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>.), of the nineteenth dynasty.<br/>
This forms a part of the facade of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amunoph</span>'s temple. A<br/>
