Malta are imported. The greater part of the imports are <span style="color: #ff0000;">reexported </span>from Damietta, together with rice (considered the<br/>
best in Egypt), grain, hemp, and tallow, leather and fish.<br/>
There is no port, properly speaking, but the town offers<br/>
sufficient shelter for vessels entering or leaving the N ile.<br/>
<br/>
Damietta is one of the healthiest and best-built cities of<br/>
Egypt. It contains spacious bazaars, numerous mosques<br/>
(some of which are celebrated for their fine proportions),<br/>
baths<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>where marble is seen in every direction, and Oriental<br/>
luxury reigns supreme.<br/>
<br/>
In history this city has often been conspicuous. The<br/>
ancient town, which was called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thamiatis </span>(long preserved in<br/>
the Coptic appellation <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tamiati</span>), was situated nearer to the<br/>
mouth of the Nile. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thamiatis </span>rose as Pelusium fell, and<br/>
gradually acquired the commerce of the Eastern Delta.<br/>
Ancient fragments of ruins and broken columns <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>been<br/>
used in building the modern town, as is frequently perceptible. In the mosque of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aboolata </span>is an <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span>block of<br/>
stone, placed where the Muslim ablutions are performed. On<br/>
this block is a Greek inscription, with the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Temnesus</span>.<br/>
The Byzantines seized Damietta in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mo</span>, but soon lost<br/>
it. In 866 the Sultan El <span style="color: #ff0000;">Metounkel </span>fortified the city, which<br/>
however did not prevent Roger of Sicily from seizing it in<br/>
1165. Saladin repulsed the Christians, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">years<br/>
</span>afterwards vainly attacked it with a fleet of twelve hundred<br/>
vessels. In 1217, the Christians became masters of Damietta,<br/>
notwithstanding an obstinate resistance from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahomedans</span>; but the latter soon afterwards besieged the place, and<br/>
the Christians ceded the city to save their own lives and<br/>
liberties. Thirty-one years afterwards, in 1248, St. Louis<br/>
disembarked at Damietta, and seized the city without having<br/>
to strike a blow. But the triumph of the French was<br/>
of brief duration. The disasters in which this ill-starred<br/>
