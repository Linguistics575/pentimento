The Nile, called by the Romans Nilus, and by the<br/>
Greeks News, from Aa <span style="color: #0000FF;">lhbs </span>(new mud), is the renowned<br/>
river of Egypt, so celebrated in ancient story, and whose<br/>
mysterious source has so long been a magnet of attraction<br/>
to adventurous souls.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile is formed by the junction, at about 15°<br/>
north of the Equator, of the Bahr-el-Azrek (anc. Astapus),<br/>
or Blue River, and the Bahr-el-Abiad, or White River. The<br/>
sources of the former were visited by Paez in 1618, and<br/>
subsequently by Bruce.<br/>
<br/>
The Bahr-el-Abiad is the true Nile, though not the<br/>
<br/>
branch which supplies the "new mud," which, by gradual<br/>
deposit, has formed so large a part of the land of Egypt.<br/>
Of the explorations in connection with the Bahr-el-Abiad by<br/>
Grant, Speke, and Baker, etc., it is unnecessary here to<br/>
speak.<br/>

At Abn Hamed, what is called the Great Bend of the<br/>
Nile occurs, the river flowing thence in a westerly course to<br/>
Edab, in Dongola, through a narrow valley. Lower N <span style="color: #ff0000;">ubia'<br/>
