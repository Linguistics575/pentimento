<span>ALEXANDRIA. <span style="color: #ff0000;">7 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>Cleopatra's Needles-These are two obelisks of<br/>
red granite, one standing erect, and the other lying prostrate,<br/>
almost buried in earth and rubbish. The upright column is<br/>
seventy-one feet <span style="color: #0000FF;">high</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>on one side the hieroglyphics are<br/>
almost worn out, on the other side they are sharp <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>distinct. These columns bear the names of Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">IIL</span>,<br/>
Rameses II., and Sethi II. The first of these monarchs, in<br/>
whose reign the stone for these immense obelisks was<br/>
quarried, reigned over Egypt in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1495 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">512.</span>; so that in gazing<br/>
at these memorials, we are taken back through nearly <span style="color: #ff0000;">thirtyfour </span>centuries of the world's history. They originally stood<br/>
in front of the Temple of Neptune at Heliopolis, and were<br/>
subsequently removed to the Caesarium at Alexandria<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but<br/>
whether by Cleopatra, whose name they bear, or at a later<br/>
date, is uncertain. The fallen column was offered as a gift<br/>
to the English nation by Mahomed Ali, but it appears never<br/>
to have been deemed worth the cost of removal, and it is<br/>
now so worn and dilapidated that its transmission to England<br/>
is less probable than ever it was.<br/>
<br/>
On the banks of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahmoodeah </span>Canal are the<br/>
residences of some of the grandees of Alexandria-large,<br/>
cool houses, standing in parched and dusty grounds. This<br/>
canal was formed by Mahomed Ali in <span style="color: #ff0000;">18s9</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">zo</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">quarter<br/>
</span>of a million of men were forced to aid in its construction,<br/>
and there was an awful sacrifice of human life by sickness<br/>
and privation before it was completed. It is cut from<br/>
Alexandria to Atfeh, on the Rosetta branch of the Nile.<br/>
On the right bank, near Alexandria, is the fashionable promenade of the city. Close at hand are the beautiful gardens<br/>
of the Viceroy, which are open to the public. A band plays<br/>
on Sundays and Fridays. Here streams of water flow,<br/>
and everything looks beautifully fresh, green, and novel.<br/>
The visitor is surrounded by many kinds of <span style="color: #0000FF;">tree-range</span>,<br/>
