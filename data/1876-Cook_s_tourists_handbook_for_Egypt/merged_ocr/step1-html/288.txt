left. Ragged garments presented by the Arabs as offerings<br/>
hang from the wooden rack above the grave. A three days'<br/>
festival is held here annually. The palm embowered <span style="color: #0000FF;">fours<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tain </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Suweirah </span>is a captal halting place for <span style="color: #0000FF;">refreshment</span>. Crossing some rough hills, the watershed between the two gulfs of'Akabah and Suez is reached.<br/>
<br/>
The Fer'a range is entered by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WÃ©dy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sa'hl</span>. This is<br/>
mostly a narrow gorge between lofty mountains of greenstone, very beautiful in its golden hues-it is green inside<br/>
when broken. The valley abounds in acacia trees and<br/>
juniper bushes. Of the latter, charcoal is made by the<br/>
Arabs; allusion to which is made in the text referring to<br/>
"coals of juniper."<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Debbet </span>er Ramleh, or the Sandy Plain, is an exception to the ordinary hard gravel or rock in the neighbourhood of Sinai. Here the <span style="color: #0000FF;">El </span>Tih mountains are full in<br/>
view, spanning the Peninsula from Suez to'Akabah; looking<br/>
backward the peaks of Sinai are seen rising in majestic grandeur from a wilderness of mountains.<br/>
<br/>
A steep pass conducts to the romantic glen of'Ain<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Huderah</span>, probably the Hazeroth of the Bible. This is a<br/>
deep ravine, nearly a mile long, and perhaps a third of a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mile </span>wide, completely shut in by mountains, except a narrow<br/>
path at each end. The spring is at the north-east end,<br/>
marked by a beautiful grove of palms and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores</span>, and a<br/>
few small plots of grain. There is an abundance of sweet<br/>
water. From the upper pass the view is very fine. The<br/>
rocks all around are richly coloured; at the further<br/>
end nestles the little green oasis. On the summit of a<br/>
mountain in the distance is seen a mass of rock which is<br/>
considered to <span style="color: #0000FF;">bear </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>striking resemblance to the Capitol at<br/>
Washington.<br/>
<br/>
Hitherto the traveller has pretty closely followed the<br/>
