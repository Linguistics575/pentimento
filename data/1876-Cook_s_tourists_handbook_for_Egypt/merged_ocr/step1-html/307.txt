<br/>
The Land of Moab, of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kit </span>of Moab and Ar of<br/>
Moab were the principal cities, was peopled by Moab, the<br/>
son of Lot, and the brother of Ammon. The Moabites<br/>
refused permission to Israel to pass through their lands to<br/>
Canaan. In after years they were at times the tributary<br/>
allies, and at others the determined foes of the Israelites.<br/>
They were evidently a wealthy and civilized pastoral race.<br/>
Their cities were numerous, and famous for the cruel rites<br/>
of Chemosh and Molech, the lascivious worship of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baal..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Peor</span>. The denunciations of the prophets against this land<br/>
are numerous. Of its language nothing is known, and of<br/>
its manners and customs the prophetic allusions give only<br/>
passing glimpses. The country is for the most part an undulating plateau scattered over with an extraordinary number<br/>
of ruins.<br/>
<br/>
Zoar is probably marked by the mounds of ruins, four<br/>
and a-half hours from Kerak at the south-east extremity of the<br/>
Dead Sea. It was one of the most ancient cities of Palestine,<br/>
and was originally called Bela. Though in close connection<br/>
and alliance with the Cities of the Plain (Gen. xiii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">lo</span>; and<br/>
Gen. xiv. <span style="color: #0000FF;">B</span>, 8), it was spared as a refuge for Lot at the time<br/>
of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. xix. 22).<br/>
In the account of the death of Moses, Zoar is mentioned as<br/>
one of the boundaries of the prospect from Pisgah. In<br/>
Isaiah xv. 5, it is declared that the fugitives from Moab<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">shall </span>flee unto <span style="color: #0000FF;">Zoa'r</span>"; the town is also mentioned by<br/>
Jeremiah (chap. xlviii. 34). In the time of the Crusaders<br/>
