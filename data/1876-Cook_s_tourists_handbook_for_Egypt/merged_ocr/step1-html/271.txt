scene with the conviction that he is in the locality where<br/>
Jehovah led his people through the depths of the sea and<br/>
overwhelmed their proud foes in the returning floods.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Ain Moosa, the track is by the well-beaten<br/>
camel route from Egypt to Sinai, trodden probably by<br/>
Midianites and Amalekites before the Exodus, as by the<br/>
tribes of the desert in <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>ages since,. to the left rises the<br/>
limestone range of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Réhah</span>, about ten miles from the sea<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
</span>the prominent object in the distance is the peak of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tttset-es</span>.<br/>
Sadr, the Cap of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sadr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>to the right stretches the blue sea,<br/>
beyond which is seen the range of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Attékah</span>, and the Arabian<br/>
range bounding the horizon; the route is across a gravelly<br/>
plain with occasional ridges of sand from twenty to <span style="color: #ff0000;">twentyfwe </span>feet high. The scattered inhabitants of the desert<br/>
regions about to be traversed are thus described by the Rev.<br/>

"The people who live in the desert have always been a<br/>
favourite subject of romance and poetry, but a very short<br/>
experience is sufficient to dissipate youthful delusions. The<br/>
Bedouins, at least such <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>them as are found between Egypt<br/>
and Palestine, are of a very prosaic <span style="color: #0000FF;">character </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3 </span>rude, ignorant, lazy, and greedy, they offer no points of attraction<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>one<br/>
of the richer sheikhs indeed will impress any beholder with<br/>
his imposing appearance and conscious dignity, but the<br/>
ordinary Arabs are destitute alike of grace and strength;<br/>
their clothing is ragged, their feet are never furnished with<br/>
shoes, and only occasionally with very rude sandals, and their<br/>
hands and faces show very plainly that water is scarce. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Towérahs </span>earn a scanty livelihood by burning charcoal for the<br/>
Cairo market, and the Alewi feed a few flocks of sheep or<br/>
goats, and cultivate small patches of ground, but both are<br/>
alike ignorant and careless of the advantages of civilized<br/>
life<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>they constantly carry arms if they can obtain them;<br/>
