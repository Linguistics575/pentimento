tribunal of prayer; and the mehrab, or niche towards Mecca.<br/>
The north and south sides of the court are bounded by two<br/>
piazzas, with two rows of columns. The whole building is<br/>
in a very dilapidated condition, and several portions, especially the minarets, are evidently of later date than the original<br/>
edifice, being probably the additions and restorations made<br/>
by Sultans <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kala6n </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baybérs</span>. The columns are 249 in<br/>
number, chiefly monoliths of granite, porphyry, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ciproline</span>.<br/>
These columns were in most cases brought from the ruins<br/>
of Memphis<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>those with Corinthian columns were probably<br/>
from Heliopolis. This important monument of Arabian art<br/>
is now abandoned to desolation. The last Viceroy projected<br/>
its restoration, and it is said that the present <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">intends </span>to carry out his predecessor's plans when circumstances<br/>
permit.<br/>
<br/>
Formerly the entire Kur-én was inscribed in letters of<br/>
gold on the walls of this Mosque. The fountain in the<br/>
centre was <span style="color: #0000FF;">embowered </span>in trees<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>fair gardens filled the area<br/>
of the court, and the long galleries were lit by <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">500 </span>lamps<br/>
suspended between the columns. The edifice was known to<br/>
the Arabs as "The Crown of Mosques," and still, though<br/>
abandoned, is held in great veneration. Here at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khédive's<br/>
</span>invitation, the ministers of all religions tolerated in Cairo<br/>
assemble jointly to invoke the favour of heaven whenever a<br/>
tardy rising of the Nile threatens Egypt with dearth and<br/>
calamity.<br/>
<br/>
The other attractions of Old Cairo are the remains of the<br/>
Roman Fortress of Babylon, and several enclosed and often<br/>
fortified convents called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dayrs</span>, including small towns in<br/>
their boundaries, and frequently ancient Greek and Coptic<br/>
churches of very great interest to those who can spare time<br/>
for their examination. The Roman fortress just named<br/>
forms one of these <span style="color: #ff0000;">dayrs</span>, with four or five churches. The<br/>
