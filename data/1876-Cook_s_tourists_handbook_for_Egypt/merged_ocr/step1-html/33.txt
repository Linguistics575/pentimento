<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>6 INTRODUCTORY.<br/>
<br/>
Dahabeahs can only be preferable to steamers for invalids or<br/>
families wishing to pass the winter on the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
The writer says he could add a dozen or two more points to<br/>
those already enumerated; and states that the question of<br/>
expense needs no discussion, the fact being patent that the<br/>
rates by Steamer are much lower than those by Dahabeah.<br/>
<br/>
Messrs. COOK & SON are quite prepared to book travellers<br/>
either Steamer or Dahabeah, and to make the best arrangements possible to be made by either mode of transit.<br/>

<br/>
The starting place is now from above the new iron bridge<br/>
"Kasr-el-Nil," which leads to the Pyramids of Ghizeh. The<br/>
steamer generally leaves at 3 p.m., and arrives same evening at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshayn </span>(railway station, and starting point to visit the site<br/>
of Memphis, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum</span>, and the Pyramids of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakk√©rah<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dashdor</span>). Donkeys sent from Cairo overnight will be<br/>
waiting at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedreshayn </span>to take the passengers to Memphis, the<br/>
Serapeum, etc., before the departure of the steamer the following<br/>
morning. These places, being so near to Cairo, and easily<br/>
accessible <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rail</span>, are generally visited from Cairo, donkeys<br/>
being sent on during the night, or taken along in the trains; but<br/>
steamers on their way up the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>now allow time for sightseeing at this place.<br/>
