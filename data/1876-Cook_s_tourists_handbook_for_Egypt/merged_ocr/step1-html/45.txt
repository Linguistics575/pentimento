<span>28 <span style="color: #0000FF;">INTRODUCTORY</span>.<br/>
<br/>
SEVENTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
Arrive at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wsidy-Halfa </span>(46 miles from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aboo-Simbel</span>, and<br/>
about 210 miles from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philae</span>), the terminal point of the voyage.<br/>
The Second Cataract is 7 or 8 miles further south, and consists<br/>
of rapids, which, extending for about 5 miles, thoroughly impede<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">navigation </span>of the river; indeed, for nearly 100 miles the<br/>
bed of the river is a succession of sunken rocks. A good view<br/>
of the Second Cataract and the surrounding country is obtained<br/>
by ascending the cliff called Aboo-Seer, and to afford the opportunity of doing so the steamer remains at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wddy-Halfa </span>a whole<br/>
day before returning.<br/>
<br/>
EIGHTH DAY<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The excursion to Aboo-Seer is better made very early in the<br/>
morning, as it is quite two hours' ride on the opposite bank of<br/>
<br/>
the river, where donkeys have already been passed by ferry-boat<br/>
in readiness.<br/>
<br/>
NINTH, TENTH, AND ELEVENTH DAYS<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Make the return journey, which is continued without stoppages of importance.<br/>
<br/>
Arrive at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>in the evening of the eleventh day, or in the<br/>
morning of the twelfth.<br/>
<br/>
TWELFTH DAY.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Visit </span>to the Cataract in a boat, and the remaining two days<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">bespent </span>at leisure, until we effect our change on the down<br/>
river steamer at Assouan, and continue to Cairo as per First<br/>
Cataract itinerary.<br/>
