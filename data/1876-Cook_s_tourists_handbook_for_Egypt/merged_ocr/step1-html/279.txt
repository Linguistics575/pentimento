Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Katereena</span>, the highest peak of them all<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>but also<br/>
hidden from the plain by other peaks of its own range.<br/>
<br/>
"It is a view," says Captain H. S. Palmer, "which once<br/>
seen is not likely to be forgotten. Indeed, the whole prospect from this point is so beautiful and sublime that no<br/>
beholder can fail to be impressed by it. It is indeed unrivalled i there is nothing else like it in this or any other<br/>
part of the peninsula-the long, wide plain sloping down to<br/>
the mount, the grand outlines of the surrounding hills, and<br/>
the stately cliffs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">R215 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Suiskfeh</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">brow</span>' of Sinai,<br/>
or Jebel Moosa, overlooking and seen from every point of<br/>
the plain below, the most conspicuous and imposing feature<br/>
in a landscape where all is grand."<br/>

the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wiidy-ed-Dayr</span>, where the camp is often pitched during<br/>
a visit to the Convent and the exploration of the vicinity.<br/>

Visitors to the Convent of St. Catherine, if arriving with<br/>
proper <span style="color: #ff0000;">letters </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.of </span>introduction from the branch convent at<br/>
Cairo, are not now hoisted up thirty feet to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">postem </span>in<br/>
the wall, as formerly. The heavy iron gates are opened,<br/>

From the earliest ages of the Church, Christian hermits<br/>
