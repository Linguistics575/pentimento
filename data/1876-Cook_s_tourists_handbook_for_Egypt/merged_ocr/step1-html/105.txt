<br/>
edifices with flat untiled roofs, blackened by smoke and<br/>
covered with dust; here and there a new edifice, white and<br/>
sparkling, upsprings amidst the mass of grey houses, and the<br/>
narrow dark streets, where the dirty, though brilliant and<br/>
many-hued, crowd are ceaselessly stirring. From the dust<br/>
and the blue smoke <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>thousand minarets rise into the free air,<br/>
like the palm trees from the gardens, covered with airy<br/>
Arabic ornaments, and encircled by their three galleries. It<br/>
is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>spectacle, that may well excite a painter's enthusiasm."<br/>
<br/>
Cairo, as already stated, is a walled town, and possesses<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">gates</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>but the town has so increased since Saladin built<br/>
the walls, that many of the gates are far in the city. The<br/>
most important gates are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bsib-el-Fotooh</span>, or Gate of<br/>
Victory; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Béb-el-Nasr</span>, or Gate of Conquest; and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab4Tooloou</span>. By a staircase at the Béb-el-Nasr, the<br/>
visitor can ascend the wall, and walk along it to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Béb-elFotooh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>There are four large open spaces in Cairo, where <span style="color: #ff0000;">out-door<br/>
<br/>
</span>Cairene life can be very advantageously studied. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekeeyah</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Birket-el-fil</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rumeyleh</span>, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Karameidan</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Karameidan</span>, close by the Citadel<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>is now known<br/>
as the Place <span style="color: #ff0000;">Méhémet </span>Ali. It is about three <span style="color: #0000FF;">furlongs </span>in<br/>
length, and is the great market for camels and donkeys.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rumeyleh </span>is close by, formerly a very low place<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but<br/>
made quite respectable by recent improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Phe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekeeyah </span>is the most important public place in<br/>
Cairo, adjacent to several public or official buildings-the<br/>
Opera House, the Palace, and the chief banks and hotels.<br/>
It is.the centre of European life, and the chief place of <span style="color: #0000FF;">social</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">261111102</span>. There is a large garden in the centre, surrounded<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">y </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">tine </span>avenue, with alleys of <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">trees </span>radiating from the<br/>
