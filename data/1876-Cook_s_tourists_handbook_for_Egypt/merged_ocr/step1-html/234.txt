more reeds and rushes than one finds on the borders of the<br/>
N ile. One valley which we crossed was surprisingly<br/>
picturesque. Its broad winding bed lay a hundred feet<br/>
below the level of the plateau. Half-way down there was a<br/>
sheikh's tomb, beside a grove of immense tamarisk trees.<br/>
After crossing the water, the path climbed along the edge of<br/>
clay buffs, and gained a height whence the great plains to<br/>
the north, and the glimmer of the lake, became visible."<br/>

The author just quoted asserts that "the <span style="color: #0000FF;">word'back</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

<br/>
The Glen of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiddimeen </span>is very beautiful. It is a deep<br/>
winding valley, along which the waters leap and sparkle.<br/>
Orange gardens, and palm groves, and vineyards on either<br/>
hand delight the eye and make the air fragrant. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fiddimeen<br/>
</span>itself is a very picturesque half-Muslim, half-Coptic, town.<br/>

There are some <span style="color: #0000FF;">Saracenic </span>ruins, and large mounds of earlier<br/>
remains. The tall chimney of the sugar refinery at <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">erleh<br/>

CAIRO TO SUEZ.<br/>
(By Railway, <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jo </span>miles.)<br/>
<br/>
The original railway, direct from Cairo to Suez, has been<br/>
abandoned<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>the expense of working the steep inclines in<br/>
crossing the high ground, and the difficulty of procuring<br/>
sufficient supplies of water, necessitated this step.<br/>
<br/>
The route is now by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalioob</span>, Zagazig, and Ismailia; the<br/>
main line <span style="color: #0000FF;">tci </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>is left at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalioab </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">80</span>. Crossing a<br/>
well cultivated district <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shibeen-el-Kanater </span>is reached;<br/>
near this village are the ruins of the ancient city of Onion,<br/>
which can be easily visited as an excursion while staying at<br/>
Cairo.<br/>
