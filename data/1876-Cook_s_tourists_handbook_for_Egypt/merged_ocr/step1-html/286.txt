<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">SINAI </span>TO SUEZ. 265<br/>
<br/>
to consider a visit to <span style="color: #0000FF;">those </span>places undesirable, choose either<br/>
of two modes of reaching Syria which still remain open to<br/>
him. The journey by Petra should not be persisted in unless<br/>
intelligence is received from'Akabah that all is well. From<br/>
Mount Sinai, Hebron can be reached via <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nahkl </span>in eleven days,<br/>
but the route is very uninteresting to most, and it is far preferable to return to Suez, proceed by the canal to Port Said,<br/>
and then take the steamer to Jaffa. (See Cook's Tourists'<br/>
Handbook to Palestine and Syria.)<br/>
<br/>
In returning from Sinai to Suez a variation is made in<br/>
the route, which will now be briefly described.<br/>
<br/>
Crossing the plain of Er <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rahéh</span>, a parting view is taken of<br/>
the Sinai group and its surroundings, and then by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Windy<br/>
</span>Aboo <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seileh</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nugb </span>Hawa is reached, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wfdy<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Soleif </span>as in coming. From the head of this valley the<br/>
traveller passes by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Soleif </span>into the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy-eshSheykh</span>, along which poured the hosts of Israel in their<br/>
march to Sinai. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Soleif </span>then conducts to the<br/>
plain of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Erweis-el-Erheirig</span>. A narrow gorge between<br/>
two gigantic cliffs of red <span style="color: #ff0000;">grapite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">conducts </span>to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wiidy<br/>
</span>Berrah, with Sinaitic inscriptions on the rock called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hajarel-Laghweh</span>. The road next crosses a plain with some signs<br/>
of vegetation, and then passes into the broad <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wsidy<br/>
</span>Labweh, in which is seen a cleft in the rock with a spring<br/>
of water, called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shageelr4'Ajooz</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mirifdy </span>Bark is<br/>
long and broad, enclosed by steep rocks of gneiss; a group<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hive.like </span>stone houses already described are seen soon<br/>
after entering the valley, and subsequently some rude attempts<br/>
at fortification erected by the Arabs against the soldiers of<br/>
Mahomed Ali. The plain of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Debébat </span>Sheykh Ahmed<br/>
is so named from the tomb of a sheykh beside the road<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>other<br/>
tombs and more of the hive houses (called <span style="color: #ff0000;">mawdmees</span>) are<br/>
seen in the vicinity.<br/>
