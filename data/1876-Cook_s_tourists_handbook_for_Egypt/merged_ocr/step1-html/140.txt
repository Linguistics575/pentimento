<span>ENVIRONS <span style="color: #ff0000;">OF </span>CAIRO. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">23<br/>
<br/>
</span>affording pleasing scenery. The last part of the drive is<br/>
amongst broad meadows and <span style="color: #0000FF;">.cura-fields</span>, where flocks of<br/>
the white ibis are seen hovering.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">busy </span>military station of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbaseeyah</span>, where Abbas<br/>
Pasha hid himself in constant dread of assassination<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and the<br/>
plain where Selim extinguished the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memlook </span>dynasty in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">1517</span>, and where also Kleber defeated the Turks in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1800</span>,<br/>
are passed on the way; also the so-called Virgin's Tree,<br/>
a sycamore, under which it is said the Holy Family rested."<br/>
<br/>
This is really a magnificent tree, in itself worth the<br/>
excursion from Cairo to see. It is railed round to preserve<br/>
it from the hacking and carving of visitors. As a compromise,<br/>
a knife is kept and lent to any who <span style="color: #0000FF;">burn </span>to cut their names<br/>
somewhere, so that it may be done on the palings.<br/>
<br/>
The village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matareeah </span>marks the site of the gardens to which Cleopatra transplanted the balsams of Judea,<br/>
which produced the celebrated Balm of Gilead. These gardens were long famous for this precious drug.<br/>
<br/>
Here also is the Miraculous Fountain, which is<br/>
alleged once to have been salt, but has been soft and excellent ever since the Virgin M ary bathed her infant in its waters.<br/>
<br/>
At a short distance from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matareeah </span>is all that is left of<br/>
Heliopolis.<br/>
<br/>
"In Heliopolis, the Oxford of Old Egypt, stood the<br/>
great Temple of the Sun. Here the beautiful and the wise<br/>
studied love and logic 4000 years ago. Here Joseph was<br/>
married to the fair Asenath. Here Plato and Herodotus<br/>
pursued philosophy and history <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>and here the darkness that<br/>
veiled the great sacrifice on Calvary was observed by the<br/>
heathen astronomer, Dionysius the Areopagite."<br/>
<br/>
. This Coptic miraculous tree is repudiated by the Roman Catholic<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Peres </span>Cordeliers, who say that the real tree died in 1656, and that they<br/>
have its last fragments in their convent at Cairo.<br/>
