On approaching Alexandria from the sea, the earliest<br/>
object seen is Pompey's Pillar, first descried as a speck on<br/>
the horizon, and gradually assuming the appearance of a tall<br/>
column against the sky. The coast is so low that little else<br/>
can be seen till the town is neared. Numerous <span style="color: #ff0000;">windmills'<br/>
</span>next rise into view, then the Pasha's palace, and some other<br/>
buildings, with long rows of white houses, and gleaming<br/>
sandbanks gradually come into sight. The approach to the<br/>
harbour is very roundabout, passing the long breakwater<br/>
formed of about 20,000 immense blocks of concrete, each<br/>
block weighing about <span style="color: #0000FF;">BO </span>tons.<br/>

<br/>
As soon as the steamer is safely moored in the harbour,<br/>
it is surrounded by small boats, out of which exceptional<br/>
specimens of every nation, kindred, people, and tongue<br/>
(with the Arab element largely prevailing), crawl and<br/>
scramble up on to the deck to take possession of the strangers<br/>
and their baggage. Passengers booked under the arrangements of Messrs. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taos</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coax </span>& <span style="color: #0000FF;">SON </span>have only to look out<br/>
for the boats of the firm which meet every steamer to convey<br/>
the passengers and luggage ashore and through the Custom<br/>
House free of charge. Let the tourist place himself immediately in charge of Messrs. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tmos</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Coos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">SON</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'S </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">repre<br/>
