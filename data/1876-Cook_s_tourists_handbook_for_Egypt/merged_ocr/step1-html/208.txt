<span>ASSOUAN. <span style="color: #ff0000;">139<br/>
<br/>
</span>nilometer that once stood here has almost totally gone.<br/>
There are a quay of Roman origin, built up with remains of<br/>
numberless more ancient edifices, and a granite portal, with<br/>
cartouches of Alexander III. still in existence<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and this is<br/>
about all there is to show for the hundreds and hundreds of<br/>
years during which in Elephantine "men reigned and women<br/>
loved, and kings and priests and princes lived and died, till<br/>
the change came, and time trod on them and crushed the<br/>
palaces, and the avenging angel swept his wing over them,<br/>
and their very dust went away on the wind. Elephantine<br/>
lay in the Nile, and other nations took the place of Egypt in<br/>
the roll of time. There is, perhaps, no place in Egypt that,<br/>
could it have a voice, would utter more strange and splendid<br/>
histories of men and kings than this island."<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine </span>lies in the river," says W. C. Prime,<br/>
"from the foot of the cataract stretching down in front of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Assouan </span>about a mile, and is nearly half-a-mile in breadth.<br/>
Its surface is a mass of ruins, shapeless and hideous. Ruin<br/>
sits triumphant here. Not even the ploughshare of ancient<br/>
history, which has run over so many ruins, could prevail<br/>
here to penetrate the mass. A small part of the island is<br/>
cultivated, but a large portion still remains in the condition<br/>
I have described, and so will remain so long as the world<br/>
stands. Fragments of statues, a gateway of the time of the<br/>
mighty son of Philip, an altar whose fire was long ago<br/>
extinguished in the blood of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">worshippers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C </span>these and<br/>
similar relics remain; but nothing to indicate the shape,<br/>
extent, or date of any of the buildings that formerly covered<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">island</span>."<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">First </span>Cataract of the Nile is about three miles<br/>
above Assouan. Ancient travellers and geographers speak of<br/>
the noise as being so prodigious as to deafen those within<br/>
earshot. If this was ever the case it is vastly different now.<br/>
