With regard to the future of British commerce in connection with the development of Port Said and the Suez<br/>
Canal, the Planters' Gazette, Dec. 1, 187 5, speaks as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">follows</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>"Port Said is geographically so <span style="color: #ff0000;">favourably </span>situated, that<br/>
while it is a point of radiation whose lines terminate <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the<br/>
various Mediterranean seaports, it is also the converging<br/>
point for the whole of the Eastern products. But while<br/>
Great Britain had no locus standi there-while the Suez<br/>
Canal was viewed merely as a road and belonging to others<br/>
-while the commercial position was deemed to be vague and<br/>
insecure, the foregoing valuable aspect of its position laid<br/>
latent. Now <span style="color: #ff0000;">thaLthe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">British </span>Government is committed to<br/>
the welfare of Egypt, capital will doubtless be largely<br/>
attracted, and under its safe shelter warehouses on an extensive scale will spring up, and Port Said will, we fully believe,<br/>
become a vast <span style="color: #ff0000;">dep6t </span>for Eastern produce, to the extent say<br/>
of half the European demands, and that half which now is<br/>
fast slipping out of our bands<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The British merchant then,<br/>
by means of the telegraph, will fulfil the bulk of the European orders from Port Said, and the various European<br/>
markets will then be supplied either from England or Port<br/>
Said as found the cheapest, and thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">regain </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>another way all<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
