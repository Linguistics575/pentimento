nant. Perhaps its amusements were always <span style="color: #0000FF;">alfresco</span>, as mostly<br/>
at the present day. There are many public performers,<br/>
wandering comedians, who act a rude farce; male and female<br/>
musicians; female singers, or Almeh; reciters of romances;<br/>
the public female dancers, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghawdzee</span>, whose improper<br/>
performances are, as a matter of fact, under Government<br/>

magicians, whose skill seems, indeed, very remarkable. All<br/>
these assist in breaking the monotony of Eastern life.<br/>

MAHOMEDANISM AND ITS CUSTOMS.<br/>
<br/>
The religion of Mahomed, or El Islam, as it is termed by<br/>
the faithful, is based on two fundamental principles, "There<br/>
is but one God, and Mahomed is his Prophet." The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahomedans </span>in Egypt are divided into four sects, differing on minor<br/>
points, but all acknowledging each other as orthodox in<br/>
important matters.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahomedans </span>believe that God sent six great prophets<br/>
into the world, viz., Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus,<br/>
and Mahomed. Of these they consider Mahomed as the last<br/>
and greatest. They hold that each of these prophets represented the will of God for a certain dispensation, each in<br/>
turn being superseded. Therefore the Jews, they acknowledge, were true believers in the time from Moses to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jesgs</span>.<br/>
They deny the existing versions of the books of Moses,<br/>
Psalms, Gospels, etc., to be authentic. Only the Kur-Ã©n has<br/>
come down unaltered from its first composition.<br/>
<br/>
Muslims accept the doctrines of the immortality of the<br/>
soul and future rewards and punishments, and do not deny<br/>
that women have souls. The more enlightened among them<br/>
receive in a figurative sense the poetical descriptions of the<br/>
