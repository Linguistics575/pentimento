<span>288 THE DESERT.<br/>
<br/>
Carmel is the next stage, which, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">route<br/>
</span>thence to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kirjeth-Arba </span>or Hebron, is described at p. 280.<br/>
<br/>
For description of Hebron, and route thence to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jerusalem</span>, see Cook's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tourists</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">Handbook </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>Palestine and Syria.<br/>
<br/>
SINAI TO HEBRON BY BEERSHEBA.<br/>
<br/>
This route is not often travelled, as most shrink from the<br/>
monotonous Wilderness of Et Tih.<br/>
<br/>
From Sinai the pass of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mureiky </span>in Jebel-et-Tih is<br/>
reached in two days.<br/>
<br/>
"One lovely morning, after an arduous climb," says Dr.<br/>
Wallace, "we got to the lofty plateau of Et Tih, the<br/>
Wilderness of the Wanderings, and were struck with<br/>
astonishment at the almost complete change in the scenery.<br/>
Great stretches of hard yellow sand made us think, in<br/>
respect of colour, of the harvest-fields of our own country<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>low stunted shrubs, completely dried up and withered, and<br/>
all with a tinge of dark green and blue, like the leaves of<br/>
green <span style="color: #0000FF;">tea </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>to the right immense cliffs of limestone rock,<br/>
with buttresses like the steps of a stair, and sloping inward<br/>
from the base<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>in many places these curious formations had<br/>
the appearance of waterfalls, and, such was the influence of<br/>
imagination that, in that clear atmosphere, we actually<br/>
thought we heard the sound of rushing water. Sometimes<br/>
this rock formation spreads over a large surface in broken<br/>
waves or hummocks like the Mer de <span style="color: #0000FF;">Glace</span>. No one has<br/>
any reason to complain of the monotony of this part of the<br/>
desert<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>for hours you pass cliffs of limestone as white as<br/>
the driven snow; here and there large detached masses<br/>
have been left standing in utter isolation, like immense<br/>
solitary sphinxes, round which the storm has been <span style="color: #ff0000;">_raging<br/>
</span>for countless ages.... One long line of <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall </span>like an<br/>
embankment, stretches far away into the distance, and ends<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
