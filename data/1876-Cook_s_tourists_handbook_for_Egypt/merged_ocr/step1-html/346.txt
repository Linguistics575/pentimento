ROUTES FROM LONDON TO THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
In connection with Palestine Tours the routes from London <span style="color: #ff0000;">may </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>classified under two heads, as follows <span style="color: #0000FF;">c<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">FIRST</span>, ROUTES OF PERSONALLY-CONDUCTED TOURS.<br/>
<br/>
(r.) For long tours the usual course is to cross the English Channel by<br/>
either the Calais route (the shortest sea passage), or by Dieppe (the shortest<br/>
distance to Paris). From Paris go direct to Turin by the Mont Cenis<br/>
Tunnel, and from Turin by Bologna and Ancona to Brindisi; thence by<br/>
steamer to Corfu, and then to Alexandria; after visiting Lower Egypt or<br/>
going up the Nile, cross the land of Goshen to Ismailia, and there take<br/>
steamer <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>Suez Canal for Port Said, from Port Said sail to Jaffa and land<br/>
there<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>make the tour of the country, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">re-embark </span>on steamer at Beyrout<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Constantinople </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>thence to Athens, and complete the tour of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medi.terranean </span>and Adriatic by <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing </span>at Trieste; return through Italy by<br/>
Venice, Milan, and Turin, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>to Paris and London<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>Whilst this is the general course of the conductors, many modifications,<br/>
extensions, or abridgments may be made to suit the convenience and meet<br/>
the wishes of the travellers, who may go through Italy and meet the conductor at Brindisi, or may go round by Nice, Mentone, etc., and meet the<br/>
party at <span style="color: #0000FF;">any'practical </span>point. The route from Palestine may be varied by<br/>
going direct <span style="color: #0000FF;">om </span>Smyrna to Athens, then to Constantinople, and up the<br/>
Danube to Vienna; or from Trieste, parties can go direct to Vienna.<br/>
<br/>
From other ports of northern Italy the Alps can be crossed, so as to<br/>
return by Bavaria or Switzerland and the Rhine, or some other deviations<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the beaten track can be provided for if desired.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>) The route for short tours to Lower Egypt and two or three <span style="color: #0000FF;">weeks<br/>
</span>in Palestine, is usually from London to Turin, as described above, then <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>Genoa, and take steamer there for Alexandria, calling at Leghorn, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Naples</span>,<br/>
and Messina<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Proceed through Lower <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt </span>to Ismailia and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Port </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Said</span>,<br/>
and thence to Jaffa<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Return from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jaffa </span>or Caifa to Alexandria, and thence<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aples</span>, and by railway to Rome, Florence, Bologna, Turin, or round by<br/>
Venice and Milan to Turin en route for Paris. This is the cheapest and<br/>
most popular route to Palestine. The whole may be covered from New<br/>
York and back for Soo dols. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">600 </span>dols. first class, or 400 dols. to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">500 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dots</span>. second class, hotels included. But this route can be modified,<br/>
extended, or abridged in many ways. It can be reversed through Italy,<br/>
and other lines of steamers can be taken from French or Italian ports. In<br/>
all <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases </span>of personally-conducted tours it is necessary to define the <span style="color: #0000FF;">route<br/>
</span>the conductor will take, and those who keep with him will fare the best, as<br/>
all baggage, omnibus, and other incidental charges are paid by him<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>but if<br/>
any leave him it is not possible to control these expenses, and the travellers.<br/>
must then take their own course and pay the extras. But tickets can <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span>provided for travelling by any conceivable line of railway or steamboat.<br/>
