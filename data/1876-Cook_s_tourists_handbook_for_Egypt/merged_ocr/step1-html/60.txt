<span>MAHOMEDANISM. 43<br/>
<br/>
joys of heaven contained in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kuruiim </span>Admission to<br/>
Paradise is asserted to be won, not by merit, but by the mercy<br/>
of God, and also by his absolute decree. Predestination,<br/>
however, is differently taught by different schools of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahomedans</span>, as by different schools of Christians; all Muslims,<br/>
however, hold that there are some elected to eternal happiness, called <span style="color: #ff0000;">welees</span>.<br/>
<br/>
"Influenced by their belief in predestination," says Mr.<br/>
Lane, "the men display, in times of distressing uncertainty,<br/>
an exemplary patience, and, after any afflicting event, a<br/>
remarkable degree of resignation and fortitude, approaching<br/>
nearly to apathy, generally exhibiting their sorrow only by a<br/>
sigh, and the exclamation, "God is bountiful! "<br/>
<br/>
The Muslim officers of religion attached to the Mosques<br/>
are, first<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the Warden (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Na'sir</span>), who is the trustee of all the<br/>
endowments of the Mosque, and appoints all the other<br/>
officers. Two ministers (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Imaum</span>) are employed to keep up<br/>
the Mahomedan services. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kateeb </span>publicly prays and<br/>
preaches on Fridays (the Mahomedan Sabbath) <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>the Ra'tib<br/>
recites certain prayers at stated times daily. The call to<br/>
these prayers is chanted from the galleries of the minarets by<br/>
officials called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muezzins</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Prayer, <span style="color: #0000FF;">almsgiving</span>, fasting, and pilgrimage, and also<br/>
frequent <span style="color: #0000FF;">purifications </span>by washing, are scrupulously enjoined<br/>
upon the followers of Mahomed.<br/>
<br/>
Prayer must always be preceded by washing, as from a<br/>
person not clean prayer is not accepted. The dress should<br/>
also be clean, and it is proper to cover the ground with a<br/>
piece of carpet.<br/>
<br/>
On entering a Mosque, the Muslim leaves his shoes with<br/>
the door-keeper (<span style="color: #0000FF;">bow'wab</span>), performs his <span style="color: #0000FF;">ablutions </span>at the<br/>
tank, if not already purified, and then, turning towards<br/>
Mecca, goes through his various orisons and <span style="color: #0000FF;">prostrations</span>.<br/>
