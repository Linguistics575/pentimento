MOUNT SINAI. 26 I

It forms a portion of a considerable district of varied and
lofty elevation. Mountains and intervening Wiidies, or
valleys, are, as before stated, the prevailing characteristics of
the Sinaitic peninsula. Hence the force of the texts--" For
mischief did he bring them, to slay them in the mountains "
(Exod. xxxii. 12) , and " a great and strong wind rent the
mountains" (r Kings xix. 2).

"Right in the heart of this large group of mountains,
and near its watershed, tradition has placed the Summit for
ever consecrated as the scene of the giving of the law. And
it has chosen wisely. Just in front of Er Rahéh, the largest
plain in the region, stands a huge granite block, about two
miles long and a half-mile broad. The northern end of this
block rises directly from the plain, and is broken into three
or four peaks, one of which is called Rsis Sufstifeh, from
which there is a clear and distinct view of the plain, and of
the attendant Wédies. Here, doubtless, is " the nether part
of the mount " (Exod. xix. I 7), where the elders accompanied
Moses, and here the law was proclaimed to the people
assembled below. That there was room enough for them
has been proved by calculations made from actual measure-
ments. The southern portion of the block, Jebel Moosa,
which rises 500 ft. higher than Sufsifeh, is doubtless that
portion of the mount in which Moses was alone with God.
Between these two peaks, the vast mass is hollowed in the
shape of a cup, filled with huge boulders of purple, and green,
and yellow granite, and supplied with several springs which
give sustenance, here and there, to a willow or cypress, or an
acacia. The walk through this basin is trying to most
persons, but a grander scene is rarely to be found. In these
bleak and lofty solitudes, Moses communed with his Maker.
Around their summits thunders roared and lightnings flashed ;
from their recesses rang out the notes of a trumpet blown by
