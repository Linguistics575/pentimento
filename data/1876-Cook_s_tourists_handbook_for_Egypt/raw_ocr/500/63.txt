46 - EGYPT.

imitation of radiance by the variegated voussoir, the expres-
sion of the sweep of the desert by the barred red line upon the
wall, the starred inshedding of light through his vaulted
roof, and all the endless fantasy of abstract line, were still
in the power of his ardent and fantastic spirit. Mu'ch he
achieved , and yet, in the effort of his over-taxed invention,
restrained from its proper food, he made his architecture a
glittering vacillation of undisciplined enchantment, and left
the lustre of its edifices to wither like a startling dream,
whose beauty we may indeed feel, and whose instruction we
may receive, but must smile at its inconsistency, and mourn
over its evanescence.' '

H ISTORY.

The foundation of the ancient kingdom of Egypt is lost
in the mists of remote antiquity. It was undoubtedly one
of the most early civilized of the nations of the earth, and
perhaps the first to acquire a fixed social and political system.

The History of Egypt naturally divides itself into Six
Periods-the Pharaonic, or native Egyptian, the Per-
sian, the period of the Ptolemies, the Roman, the
Arabian, and the Turkish.

The Pharaonic Period is.also subdivided into Three. Errr.
pires. The Ancient Empire lasted from the foundation
of the kingdom by Memes, in. 5004. mc. (according to
Mariette) to the end of the Tenth Dynasty, a period of
nineteen centuries.

The Middle Empire includes from the Eleventh to
the Seventeenth Dynasty, a period of I 361 years, terminat-
ing with the expulsion of the Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings.

The New Empire comprises a period of about 1400
years, from the re-establishment of the native monarchy by
Amosis to the conquest of Egypt by Persia in 3 50 mc.
