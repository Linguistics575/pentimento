Of the three routes leading from WMy-ed-Dehseh to the
Wédy Ghurundel, the central route is mostly chosen, through
the Wiidy Sadur, the Wédy Wardtin, and the Wtidy Amérah.
In the latter valley are seen the group of rocks called Hagar-
el-Rekkab, or Stone of the Rider.

Ain Hawarah (the F ountain of Destruction) is usually
identified with Marah,where the bitter waters were made
