ABOO SIMBEL. 203

At Toslzo, a weir is formed by the rocks running down
into the river, and hence the journey is through complete
desert scenery to Aboo Simbel. Some of the rocks are very
singular in form. One rises from the level sand reminding
the visitor of the Pyramid of Cheops; another has been
compared to the Sphinx.

Aboo Simbel, or Ipsambool (170 miles S. of Philae, and
46 from the Second Cataract), contains the most interest-
ing monuments to be found in N ubia, and perhaps to most
tourists the only ones specially demanding their notice.
W. C. Prime, in his Boat Life in Egypt and Nubia, says the
Great Temple " is the most impressive of the monu-
ments of Egyptian grandeur. I say the most impressive,
because here is all that can impress the heart. Here are the
remains of ancient wealth, splendour, and taste united.
Here the sublime idea of the great Sesostris stands graven
on the rock, and the men of the nineteenth century after
Christ respond with their hearts to the call which the man
of the fourteenth before Christ utters from the face of the
mountain."

The exterior of the Great Temple is in a niche cat in
the face of the mountain. Three of the most splendid of
Egyptian Colossi sit on thrones carved out of the face of the
rock. There is another throne, tenantless, for the Colossus
who once sat there has fallen to ruins. A frieze of little
monkeys runs across near the summit of the fagade. The
desert sand has drifted across the foot of the temple, so that
of one Colossus only the head and neck are seen. These
immense statues measure 66 feet in height; the forefinger
of each being a yard long. The fapade of the temple is
nearly 100 feet in height.

Over the ridge of sand thirty feet high, the doorway be-
tween the two centre statues can be entered, and the interior
of the temple explored. Candles must be provided to
