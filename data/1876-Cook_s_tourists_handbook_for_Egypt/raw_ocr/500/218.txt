BAYT-EL-WELLY. I 99

this terrace is ascended by a third flight of steps, and the front
of the propylon is before the visitor.

This propylon--ur2 feet long, 60 feet high, and 20 feet
tl.1ick-was never completed, and looks like a bare wall 5 the
usual ornamented doorway conducts to a dromos covered with
broken columns, and cornices, and blocks of stone 3 the
pronaos has twelve columns, with elegant capitals of palm
and vine leaves; the adytum, hall and various other rooms
can be explored, and are covered with sculptures not in the
best style of Egyptian art. This temple dates from the
time of Augustus-the extensive ruins excite wonder, for it
seems as if the edifice was overthrown before its comple-
tion. Some of the additions date from the reigns of Cali-
gula, Trajan and Severus.

At 2hryt-el-Welly (W.) is a smaller temple dedicated to
Amunre, Kneph, and Anof1kts by Rameses II. The vic-
tories of that monarch are sculptured on the exterior , inside
also there are much admirable painting and sculpture, the
colouring of which is very fresh and vivid; on each side of
the hall of entrance is a recess containing three sitting
deities. " It is, however, on the outside approach to this
hall," says the Rev. A. M. Smith, " that I found the objects
which interested me most, consisting of representations of
various animals from the interior of Africa, conducted by
Ethiopians of true Negro type of figure. I copied the greater
part of these figures, the more prominent of which are the
giraffe, bull, lion, gazelle, monkey, and ostrich , and no artist
of the present day (not even Landseer or Wolff) could depict
more graphically in outline the true proportions and charac-
teristics of these several creatures than those drawn on the
wall by some talented draughtsman thirty-two centuries
since."

Through some bare and desolate scenery, and the rapids
of Aboo Hor, the steamer now passes on to Dendoo'r. Here
