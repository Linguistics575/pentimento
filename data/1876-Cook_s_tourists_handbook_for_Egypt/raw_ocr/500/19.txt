2 INTRODUCTORY.

ferent from anything to which the European traveller has been
accustomed ; the modes of travelling are novel, and the difficulties
to be encountered greater than in any part of Europe. Of course
these difficulties are not insurmountable even if persons go alone,
or with perchance only another ; but there is no doubt that the
pleasure of a tour is enhanced by being associated with a party
of friends and acquaintances, or even of strangers with no
other bond than that of being fellow tourists in strange and
novel scenes. There must of necessity be some little monotony
in a journey of from three to five weeks, as the case may be, on
the Nile, and this cannot be more pleasurably relieved than by
cheerful social intercourse. Moreover, as a question of expense,
“it will often happen that certain costs which would have to be
borne by a single traveller would not be any greater for a party.

MONEY.

, Any money deposited at the offices of THOMAS COOK and
SON, will be repaid to the traveller in the currency of the
countries, as required. English gold or French gold is better
than paper in the East. Their circular notes of g 5 or £10 are
better than Bank of England notes-safer and less liable to
depreciation.

The Arabs on the Nile like the large Egyptian and Turkish
coins, and it will be well for the traveller to provide himself
with some at Cairo for backsheesh.
