THE MOUNT OF THE LAW, 257

(" Hill of the Conference 'O, with its numerous inscriptions,
the various caves of the hermits, and remains of tombs and
ancient monastic buildings, affords further objects of interest
to inspect, if time allows. .

Leaving Feirén, in three or four miles vegetation again
ceases. Passing some banks gradually deposited by floods,
the Gate of Niriidy Feiriin is passed through into the
Wédy Soléf.

In the Mrtidy Soléf, a number of the ancient stone
houses, shaped like beehives, and attributed by the Arabs to
the Israelites, are passed. From this Wédy the Israelitish
host are supposed to have passed to the Valley of Rest by
the MiGdy-esh-Shearkh, but there is a shorter and more
magnificent pass further on, called the Nugb Hawa, or
Pass of the Wind, through which visitors can proceed on
horseback while the camels go round by the Wédy-esh-
Sheykh. This is one of the grandest passes on earth,.and
forms a fitting gateway to the awful heights of Sinai. It is
a narrow and at times precipitous passage through lofty
granite mountains rising to the height of 1,500 feet; while
large masses of rock on either side seem ready to fall on the
adventurous traveller.

Emerging from the Pass into the Valley of Rahah,
or Valley of Rest, the sacred mountains of Sinai are seen in
full view. To the left stands Jehered-Deyr, the Mount
of the Convent, at the foot of which runs the Valley of
Jethro, where stands the Greek Convent. On the right of
this rises Rits Sufséfeh, the Mount of the Law, command-
in g the whole plain and the valleys leading into it, and forming
the fitting height from which God spoke in audible voice to
man. Jebel Moosa, the trylitional Sinai, lies directly behind
this, in the same range, but not visible from the plain;
while on the extreme right, beyond the Wédy-el-Lejé, stands
