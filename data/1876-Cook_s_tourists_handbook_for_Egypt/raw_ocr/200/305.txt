capital of Edom. The traveller will, of course, be reminded
of the text-"Who is he that cometh from Edam, with
dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his
apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength?" (Isa.
lxiii. r). A strong fort, protecting a cluster of miserable

shall devour the palaces of Bozrah." "The sheep of
Bozrah " are incidentally mentioned in Micah ii. 12.

Kerak, or Kir Moab, has a population of about

zireh, 'Orék, Ketherabba, etc. Kerak has a very bad repute
amongst travellers; Burckhardt, Tristram, and others have
been shamefully plundered at this place. The inhabitants
are fanatical and extortionate.
