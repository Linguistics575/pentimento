ALEXANDRIA TO ROSETTA. 73

At the western extremity of the Peninsula of Ras-et-
Teen (once Island of Pharos) are the Arsenal, Palace of
the Viceroy, and the Eunostus Point, with its lighthouse. The
Palace can be inspected, for which a permit (easily obtained)
is necessary. The view from the balcony, the surrounding
gardens, the Carrara marble staircase, and the circular audi-
ence chamber, are the chief attractions.

A pleasant excursion can be made from Alexandria either
by the short railway. or by road to Ramleh, where Alex.
andrian merchants go for fresh air and a change from the
noise and bustle of the city. The Roman Camp is passed
on the way, where the partisans of Antony were defeated by
Augustus 3.0. 30, and where, in ISO], the French were
defeated by the English forces under Sir Ralph Abercromby,
who was killed in the engagement.

ALEXANDRIA TO ROSETTA.

This is a tedious journey of about forty-six miles by road.
Cassar's Camp and Ramleh (see above), the site of ancient
Canopus, a watering-place of infamous notoriety in
the Ptolemaic times, and Aboukir Bay, are passed en
route. The latter place lives in history as the scene of the
celebrated Battle of the Nile, where Nelson defeated the
French under Admiral Brueys. A railway to Rosetta is in
progress.

Rosetta, dating from the ninth century, was once a
very important place. It has declined as Alexandria has
risen, and now contains 14,000 inhabitants, being about half
its population at the commencement of the present century.
It is a healthy and well-built town, with very pleasant envi.
rons. Here was found the famous Rosetta Stone, with an
inscription in three languages, which first led to the decipher-
ment of the hieroglyphics of Egypt.
