BEBAYT-EL-HAGAR. 137

Semenhood is a station on the Tantah and Talkah line.
The town has bazaars, and the usual Oriental scenes. It is
famous for its potteries, and marks the site of Sebenuytus,
the city of Sem, the Egyptian Hercules. "An hour was

town being celebrated for this ancient art. Among the
tombs, in low clay huts, the nimble-fingered and prehensile-

builders of cost, that throughout the greater part of the
structure they had sculptured this intractable adamant in
unusually high relief. But though it had been thus mas.
sively constructed of imperishable materials, and decorated
with such lavish expenditure, it was so completely wrecked,
that now the traveller finds in its place merely a heap of
stones. What had been the temple is there, but not one
stone has been left standing on another."

The temple was erected by Ptolemy Philadelphus, and
measured 400 ft. by BOO ft. It was surrounded by groves,
and stood in an extensive area measuring 1500 ft. by 1000 ft.
Isis, Osiris, Anubis, Savak, and other deities figure in the
sculptures on the overturned and broken stones. The battle
