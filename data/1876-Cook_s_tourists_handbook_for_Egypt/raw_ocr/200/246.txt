ISMAILIA. 225

is very interesting through the remains of ancient canals
and cuttings discovered here. There are also the remains
of atemple attributed to Serapis. Serapis was a comparatively
modem Egyptian god, uniting the functions oi Apis and
Osiris. He was regarded as Pluto, and his worship was
first introduced from Sinop√© in the time of the Ptolemies.
The extensive village of Serapeum forms a pretty oasis, with
its gardens and fields watered by a branch of the Sweet.
Water Canal, in close proximity to desert wastes and sands.

" Lake Timsah is a large natural basin in the very
centre of the Isthmus. As its area is much less than the
Bitter Lakes, while its shores are higher and more irregulir,
it possesses an approach to something like a kind of
picturesqueness you might not have been expecting. In
this midland harbour we found a fleet of large vessels, some
of them men-of-war, some of them even ironclads. A sense
of surprise comes over you at seeing, not only a pleasing
expanse of water in the thirsty, scorching waste (how one
wishes it were fresh water), bat in addition a fleet of mighty
ships in the mid desert."

Lake Timsah is five miles in length, the Canal skirting
the eastern shore. Till lately the lake was only partially
covered by water, received at the annual inundation from a
branch of the Nile. It is now an inland sea nine miles in
circumference. A little south of the lake is a valley com-
manded by a hilly plateau called Gebel Mariam. Here, it is
said, Mary rested when she fled with the young child into
Egypt. The hills rise like an amphitheatre on the north
and east sides of the lake.

Ismailia stands by the shore of Lake Timsah. It is
a thriving town of about 5000 persons; very healthy as
combining the desert air with the sea-shore advantages. A
few years ago no breathing animal could have lived here.
