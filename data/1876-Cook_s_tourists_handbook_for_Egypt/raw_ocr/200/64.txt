DYNASTIES. 47

All asserted facts in the early history of Egypt must be
taken as, to a great extent, conjectured and uncertain. From
the brief records of Scripture, and the works of Herodotus,
Diodoms, Eratosthenes, and especially the historical frag-
ments of Manetho, joined to a laborious investigation of
the monuments and papyrus records, a history of Egypt
has been developed, although on many points,especially as
regards chronology, Egyptologists hold very diverse views.

In describing the monuments of Egypt in subsequent
pages of this work, it will sometimes be necessary to refer
to some or other of the various dynasties of Egyptian
kings. It will therefore be desirable now, as briefly as pos-
sible, to epitomise these. It should be observed that the
epithet Pharaoh, applied in Scripture to any King of Egypt,
was a generic name, similar to Caesar or Augustus, probably
from the Egyptian word Phra, the Sun.

DYNASTI ES.

I. Founded by Menes, about 5004 3.0. His capital was
This (Abydos), in Upper Egypt. There are no monuments of
this dynasty. Tetu, the second king, wrote on surgery, and
Hespu, the fifth king, wrote sacred books.

II. (4751 mc.) Includes nine kings, who have left some
rude remains of their work. No. 2, Kekeu, built the oldest
Pyramid in Egypt, that at Sakkérah (p. 125), and introduced
the symbolic worship of Apis. No. 8, Sesocri.s, is described
as a giant.

III. (4449 mc.) Memphis was now the capital. Tombs,
dating from Snefru, the last king but one in this dynasty,
are adorned with pictures, and prove a high degree of
civilization.

IV. (4235 13.0.) Memphis capital. Numerous monuments
