26 INTRODUCTORY.

are paintings of the highest finish, in colours as vivid as on the
day on whic1fthey were executed. The smaller temple, called
" Bayt-el-Welly," or " House of the Saint," lies against a rocky
hill to the right, and is partly cut out of the rock. Although
difficult of access, it is worth while to attempt the ascent, as the
temple contains excellent paintings, and the sculptures, recording
the battles of Rameses, are perfect.

THIRD DAY.

The traveller will pass and visit successively Dendoor, 12
miles from Kalfbsheh, and Kirscheh, 10 miles further, which
have cavern temples of some magnitude.

The same day Dakkeh is reached, where there is a temple
supposed to have been built by the Ethiopian King, Ergamun;
a part of it is in a very good state of preservation. The sculp-
tures and hieroglyphics are extremely good, and in admirable
condition.

The steamer proceeds for some time yet, and possibly
reaches Maharraka, nine miles from Dakkeh; here is a small
temple of which but two rows of columns remain entire.

FOURTH DAY.

(20 miles.) Arrive at Saboa or Wady-Sab6ah, " the Valley
of the Lions." It has little to indicate its former splendour.
The temple of Rameses II. is nearly buried in the sand. Two
statues, however, remain in sight, which may induce a short
visit.

Arrive at Korosko, 12 miles further, and about 100 miles
from Philat. It is from here that the great high road stretches
across the Desert to Shendy and Sennaar. Most of the caravans
for Khartoom start from Korosko. Behind the village is a peak
called "Awes-el-Guarany," the top of which is held sacred by
the natives, and is a point of pilgrimage, as being the tomb Of
the Saint from whom the mountain derives its name. The
steamer remains at Korosko all night, to enable the passengers
to accomplish the ascent of this peak, a rather difficult task,
