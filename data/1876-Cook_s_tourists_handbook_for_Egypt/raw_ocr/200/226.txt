CAIRO TO THE NATRON LAKES. 207

CAIRO TO THE NATRON LAKES AND
MONASTERIES.

This excursion is more particularly adapted for those
interested in ecclesiastical antiquities. Tents are not essen-
tial, but provisions must be taken.

To reach the Wédy Natroén, or Nitria, where, in the
lakes, and on the adjacent plains, the natron is gathered, the
Nile Valley must be left at Teraneh, called also Beni-
Salémeh.

The Desert of Nitria was the first place to which the
Christian hermits retired from a cornipt world in the earliest
ages of the Church. In A.D. 150, Fronto and several
brethren retired to the valleys of the Natron Lakes. The
most famous saint of the district was St. Macarius,of
Alexandria, revered by both Latins and Greeks. He died
in A.D. 394, after sixty years of austerity and devotion in
different deserts. After thirty-eight years in the Thehaid,
he came to the Natron Lakes in A.D. 373. Of this monk
it is told, how, on receiving a bunch of grapes from a tra,
veller, he sent it to another, and he to a third, and so it
travelled through the hands of hundreds of self-denying
auchorites, and got back to St. Macarius himself, who re-
joiced at his brethren's abstinence, but would not eat it.
The same worthy, for killing a gnat that bit him, gave him-
self for six months to the flies in the marshes of Scete, and
got stung out of all recognition by his brethren, except by
his voice. In the Lives 9/ the Saints, and various. pic-
tures, etc., the acts and miracles of this good father are duly
set forth. It is said that at one period the number of con-
verts in this district was fifty, and the number of devotees
five thousand. '
