DYNASTHS. 5 I

Saite, who at last succeeded in revolting from the Persian
yoke in 406 3.c. His splendid green breccia'sarcophagus is

XXIX. and XXX. T hese were the last two dynasties of
Egyptian kings who were constantly struggling against Per.
sian supremacy. This native rule ended when Nectanebo II.
fled in 3.0. 340.

The Persians in turn were conquered by the Mace-
donians. At the death of Alexander the Great, the Greek
dynasty of the Ptolemies was established in Egypt, and
maintained its sway for 300 years. Ptolemy Soter, Ptolemy
Philadelphus, and Ptolemy Euergetes raised the power of
Egypt to its highest pitch. Alexandria became celebrated
as a great seat of commerce, arts, and learning (p. tit).
Gradually a fresh decline set in, which had reached its lowest
ebb when Cleopatra used other means than the sword of
her ancestors to conquer the generals of mighty Rome. At
her death in 30 mc. Egypt was reduced by Augustus to a
Roman Province.

Egypt was governed by a Prefect as a Province of Rome
from the time of Augustus till the death of Theodosius in
395 A.D., a period of 42 5 years. The great event of this
period was the introduction of Christianity, and the subse-
quent peopling of the solitude of the Thebaid with devout
hermits. The new temples, and the old for a considerable
period, both attracted their votaries, and hieroglyphic inscrip-
tions of as late a date as the third century are still found.
The total ruin of ancient Egyptian culture dates from the
overthrow of the Serapeum in 389 A.D. by Theodosius. Then
not only Egypt's old religion, but Egyptâ€™s hieroglyphic
lore, passed into oblivion, till again rescued in our own
times.
