iv ' PREFACE:

goals of travel they once were. Year by year the tide of
Tourists to these and other Eastern localities increases; and
to assist these in their necessarily brief and rapid survey, the
'present Volume is prepared, which aims at being comprehen-
siile though not voluminous, accurate though not tedious.

From a great variety of works of travel and research,
the principal of which are named at p. 292, the Editor has
supplemented his own personal observations. Whenever it
has been his impression that a graphic piece of description
or suggestive note by some well-known writer would add
interest to any scene, by being read at the locality to which it
refers, it has been extracted and given as a quotation in the
following pages.

The Editor will be grateful for any information derived
from the personal observation of Tourists, which may serve
to correct errors or supply deficiencies in this Handbook.
Any communications on such subjects should be addressed,
" Editor of the Tourists' Handbooks, Messrs. Cook lk Son,
Ludgate Circus, E.C."

LONDON, October Ist, 1876.
