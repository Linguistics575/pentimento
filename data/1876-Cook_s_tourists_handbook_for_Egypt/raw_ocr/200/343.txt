journey of two days, halting for a night at Keir Hanwar. Three days
more from Damascus to Baalbec, and two days from Baalbec to Beyrmlt.

stoppages such a Tour ought to have forty days allotted to it, though with
hard work it might be got over in thirty days.

These Tours to the east of the Jordan would require the special po"
tection of the local sheikhs, and would involve costs for this protection,
varying in amount in proportion to the number of the parties. This would
have to be arranged by s cial contract at the time, as no fixed chats an
be satisfactorily arranger Mr. Floyd is as capable as my man to handle
these bllck-mail exactions.
