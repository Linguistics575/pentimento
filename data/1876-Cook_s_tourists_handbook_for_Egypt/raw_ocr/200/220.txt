KOROSKO. Rot

Egyptian fortifications are seen on the opposite side of the
river. Dakkeh was the head-quarters of the renowned
Ethiopian magi.

Koortee (W.) A few ruins are discernible here.

Maharmker (W.) has a picturesque little temple. All is
overthrown except two rows of columns.

Wsfdy Sahodah/ or Valley of the Lions, so.called
from the dromos of sphinxes once leading up. to a temple of
Rameses, constructed of granite, with the sanctuary exca-
vated in the solid rock. The avenue has almost entirely dis.
appeared. Of the temple, the two towers of the pylon, the
Osiride columns of the area, and the interior chambers, still
remain. Here the Arabic language ceases to be spoken, and
the Nubian only is in use.

Korosko (E), though a considerable place of traffic, is
scarcely even a village. There are a few scattered huts along
the foot of the mountain, in a green oasis of a valley.
Black, frowning precipices enclose the gorge through which
lies the desert route to Shendy and Sennaar. This is a start-
ing-point for Khartoum. The route, 200 miles in length, is
one of the worst/m the desert-water being only procurable
at one stopping-place, and wild Bedouins very troublesome.
The mountain is of a most curious shape, and is of volcanic
origin. The peak 'fAwes-el-Guarany" is held sacred by
the natives, and is a point of pilgrimage as being the tomb
of the saint from whom the mountain derives its name.
There are innumerable tablets and inscriptions here record-
ing the names of pilgrims. Sometimes those of one family
through many generations. The steamer stops long enough
to allow for the ascent of the peak to be made-rather a
difficult task, as the steep path is strewn with volcanic re-
mains. The journey will however well repay the fatigue,
more especially if sunrise or sunset can be seen at the same
time. The View is magnificent, comprehending the Nile
