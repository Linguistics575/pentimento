(2) ROUTES OF PERS0NALLY-C0NDUCTED TOURS.

For long tours the usual course is to cross the English
Channel by either the Calais route, (the shortest sea passage,)
or by Dieppe, (the shortest distance to Paris). From Paris
direct to Turin by the Mont Cenis Tunnel, and from Turin by
Bologna and Ancona to Brindisi; thence by steamer to Corfu,
and then to Alexandria; after visiting Lower Egypt or going up
the Nile, cross the Land of Goshen to Ismailia, and there take
steamer on Suez Canal for Port Said; from Port Said sail to
Jaffa and land there; make the tour of the country, and re-
embark on steamer at Beyrout for Constantinople; thence to
Athens, and complete the tour of the Mediterranean and Adriatic
by landing at Trieste; returning through Italy by Venice, Milan
and Turin, and back to Paris and London.

Whilst this is the general course of the conductors, many
modifications, extensions or abridgments may be made to suit
the convenience and meet the wishes of the travellers, who may
go through Italy and meet the conductor at Brindisi, or may go
round by Nice, Mentone, etc., and meet the party " any prac-.
ticable point. The route from Palestine may be varied by going
direct from Smyrna to Athens, then to Constantinople and up
the Danube to Vienna, or from Trieste; any who choose can go
direct to Vienna.

From other parts of Northern Italy the Alps can be crossed,
so as to return by Bavaria or Switzerland and the Rhine, or
other deviations from the beaten track can be provided for if
desired.

The route for short tours to Lower Egypt and two or thee
weeks in Palestine, is usually from London to Turin, as de-
scribed above, then to Genoa and take steamer there for
Alexandria, calling at Leghorn, Naples and Messina. Proceed
