of the Nile is evident here.

On the low wooded shore to the east, close under the
mountain at the southern end of the former channel of the
Nile, are the ruins of Antinoé, or Antinopolis. Some frag-
ments of a Roman theatre and hippodrome are amongst the
chief remains. It was a Roman rather than Egyptian city,

visiting Egypt, was accompanied by his beautiful favourite

sepulture. Antinoé was the metropolis of Upper Egypt
previous to the Saracenic invasion. There are no monuments,

employing several hundred persons. The Coptic village of
Byadeeyah (W.), Medeeneh (E.), with numerous Christian
tombs and painted chapels of very ancient date, are next passed.
In one Egyptian grotto, near Ed Dayr en Nakhl (E.), is a
picture showing the Transport of a Colossus on a
sledge dragged with ropes, illustrating the ancient method
of dealing with these huge monuments. Probably many
