TOUR TO THE GREAT DESERT AND
PA LE STI N E .

The general route is from Egypt to!Sinai, Petra, Mount Hor,
and Palestine.

”Forty days are required for the journey from Cairo to Sinai,
Petra, and by Mount Hor, to Hebron and Jerusalem. Without
attempting here to mark out the various routes that may be' taken,
or to deﬁne exact itineraries, it may be said generally and brieﬂy
that all necessary camp equipments for Tours through the desert
can be supplied; and in every engagement of this kind none but
the most trustworthy dragomans will be employed, who will
do justice to the travellers as well as to the ﬁrm of COOK and
SON. A graduated scale of charges according to the number
of party is adopted, and engagements can be made for Desert
travelling at nearly as cheap aerate as for Palestine. But the
details and conditions of such tours are best settled by private
negotiation (p. 9).

Having shown how to reach Egypt, it will be useful for the
traveller to have placed before him an itinerary of the Nile
Journey. Before doing so, however, it will be well to call his
attention to the two modes of making the Nile trip, and we quote
the following comparison between the relative advantages of
STEAMBOAT versus DAHABEAH,published in A [I the World Over.

DAHABEAH. STEAMER.

Much of the scenery is unquestion- You go. on' at a uniform rate, inde-
ably very tame. But the slow pendently of wind or stream.
progress and the frequent long
waitings for wind must be borne,
be the scenery never so unin-
teresting.

If becalmed, there you must stay, You never are becalmed, and you
unless you would encourage don’t encourage slavery.
