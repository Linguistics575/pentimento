PYRAMIDS 0F GHIZEH. 1 1 1

distinctly, as far as the eye can reach, as the coast line of
Devon and Cornwall can be traced by anyone who stands
on the Eddystone lighthouse. Along the line of this sea of
sand, stretching into the far distance, a number of minor
Pyramids are seen, past Old Cairo, and the site of Heliopolis,
the ‘ city of the sun,’ the city called On in the .45th verse of

men, not with camels, but with asses; they return, and come
again with their families, carrying a silvery-haired patriarch
in their midst, and they settle down in that fruitful valley
near to that palace on our right, and within sight of this
Pyramid. And now a dense population grows up, a mixture
