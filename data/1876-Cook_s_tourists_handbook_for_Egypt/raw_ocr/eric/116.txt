III. GRAND VESTIBULE.
A. Statues.

“In the main vestibule, crowded with precious relics, I
can only notice those extraordinary specimens of the oldest
Egyptian art, which are to be seen nowhere else in the world.
The eye is at once drawn to two life-sized statues of painted
limestone, which from their pedestals seem to overlook and
guard the later remains. They are nude, save a cloth, folded
in front like an apron, which falls from the hips to the knees.
The arms and legs are rather stiﬁly modelled, but quite free
from the conventional rigidity of Egyptian statues. Indeed,
the hands, feet, and joints show a careful study, not only of
nature, but also of the individual. The trunks are excellently
rendered in their main masses, like the half-ﬁnished clay
model of a ,modern sculptor. But the heads are simply
amazing in their correct embodiment of life and character.
In them there is no prescribed solidity of expression, in
closed lips, steadfast eyes, and hands resting ﬂatly on the
knees, as in the statues chiselled ten thousand years later.
They beam with a frank, free, naive apprehension of nature,
and exhibit the activity of an art which is just about to over-
come the last stubborn resistance of the material. There is
no representation of motion, as in the crowning ‘days of
Greek sculpture; the ﬁgures stand or sit, but you feel that a
slight effort would enable them to rise or walk.”
