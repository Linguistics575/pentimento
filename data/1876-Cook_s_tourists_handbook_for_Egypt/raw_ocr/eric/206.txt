ASSOUAN. 1 87

miles from Cairo and 7 30 from the coast of the Mediter-
ranean. It is a well-built town, and a walk through the
bazaar is very interesting, and the scene on the quay
is usually very lively.

Assouan was formerly known as Syene. Few traces of
its early Egyptian history are recognizable. From the
granite quarries of the neighbourhood, the obelisks and other
monoliths of the cities of Upper Egypt were procured. In
one quarry there is an obelisk with one side still adhering to
its native rocks. A Ptolemaic temple has been recently
discovered. But though Syene was a notable garrison town
in Greek and Roman times, even of that epoch scarcely
anything remains. The ruins at Assouan, and also in
the adjacent island of Elephantine, are mostly Saracenic.

Syene was celebrated amongst Greek and Roman geo-
graphers and philosophers as being a place where, at the
summer solstice, the sun shone perpendicularly, and some of
the measurements of the earth, by Eratosthenes and others,
were based on this supposed fact. Modern observation
proves either that these philosophers were wrong in their
facts, or else that the position of the earth, and consequently
the boundary of the tropics, has altered since their time.
Juvenal lived at Syene for a time, being banished hither by
the Emperor Domitian.

In the prophecies of the downfall of Egypt the Prophet
speaks of the “ tower of Syene” as marking the southern
limit of the kingdom—thus, “from Migdol to Syene ” was
a similar expression to the customary Hebrew phrase, “from
Dan to Beersheba.” (See Ezek. xxix. IO and xxx. 6, taking
the marginal reading in both cases.)

In the vicinity of Assouan may be seen several remains
of Saracenic walls, and numerous tombs of sheikhs and
saints.
