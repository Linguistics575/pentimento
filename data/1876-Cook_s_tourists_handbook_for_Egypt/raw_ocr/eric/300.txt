MOLADAH. 279

world.

The N egeb, or South Country of Judaea, which was given
to the tribes of Judah and Simeon, is now entered. The
desert journey is over, and cultivation smiles on every hand.
Fields covered with ﬂowers take the place of the long
stretches of gravel and rock, and the palm and acacias are

luxuriance. Here and there Bedouin tents dot the valleys,
