'2 4.6 THE DESERT.

THE PENINSULA OF MOUNT SINAI

is bounded by the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of ’Akabah,
and by a line drawn across the northern extremities of those
two gulfs. Entering at the north-west, for two days the
journey is across a hard gravel formation, .on which the
caravan track is distinctly visible. At Waidy Ghurundel
(p. 252) the scene changes, and the journey is amongst low
hills in very varied combination. The term Wédy, of in-
cessant recurrence in the Sinaitic journey, expresses a water-
course, either with or without water. It is a very compre-
hensive term, and may mean a mere depression two inches
deep, or a gorge hemmed in by mountains. At the end
of the fourth day the plains of Markhah, by the Red
Sea, are reached. Turning from these, eastward at any
point, the mountain district is immediately entered. Now
on every hand are. huge limestone and sandstone cliffs, at the
base of which lie boulders large and small, of every variety
and colour of granite, evidently swept down by ﬂoods at
periods more or less remote. But though mostly ascending,
the ease of the progress is very striking. At the Convent of
St. Catherine (p. 258) the visitor will have attained a height
of 5000 feet above the sea-level, and yet only in two or three
instances will any very obvious ascent have been accom-
plished in the progress thither. It is said, indeed, that a
railroad of easy grades could be laid down along the Wédies
from end to end of the Peninsula at comparatively small

cost. Although deep, the mountain Wédies are generally
level, often as smooth as a ﬂoor. They vary in width from
a quarter of a mile to a hundred yards or so, but are seldom

a mile, and often not a quarter of a mile in the same direc-

tion. The Sinaitic peninsula is not a series of consecutive

mountain ranges, but a conglomeration of mountain Spurs
