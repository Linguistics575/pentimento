270 THE DESERT.

Kings viii. 20). But in 2 Kings xiv. 22, we read that
Amaziah “ built Elath and restored it to Judah.” But it was
not long before “Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to
Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath” (2 Kings xvi. 6).
It remained for a long period probably an outpost of the
Kings of Syria, but we do not again hear of the town till
Roman times, when it is mentioned as a frontier town of
the South. It subsequently became the seat of a Christian
Bishopric. Under Roman rule it had dwindled into insig-
niﬁcance, through the development of Roman commerce by
way of Suez, but it attained to some note in early Maho-
medan times. All that now remains to tell of the former
importance of ’Akabah and its environs are the picturesque
ruins of a mediaeval fortress on the rocky island of
Kureiyeh. ,

Ezion-Geber so frequently mentioned in connection
with Elath, is supposed to be represented by Ain-el-Ghudyﬁn,
about ten miles up the now dry bed of the Wédy ’Arabah.
It is supposed that the Gulf of ’Akabah once extended con-
siderably farther northward than at the present day. In
Numbers xxxiii. 3 5, 36, Ezion-geber is spoken of as the last
place in which they tarried before entering the Wilderness of
Zin. In I Kings ix. 26 we read that “ King Solomon made
a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on
the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.” In chap.
xxii. 48, we read that “ Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish
to go to Ophir for gold; but they went not, for the ships
were broken at Ezion-geber.” A visit to the place by
Solomon to start off an expedition to Ophir, manned jointly
by his own people and the people of Hiram, king of Tyre,
is recorded in 2 Chron. viii. I7, 18. ,
