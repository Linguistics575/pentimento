series of steps were added to the outside, till the requisite
dimensions were obtained. Then the steps were ﬁlled up
with smooth polished stone, covered with sculptures and

used on the occasion of the sepulture of the illustrious
builder, and the entrance hermetically sealed. From most
of the Pyramids the outer polished stones have been removed,
to furnish materials for the ediﬁces of the Mahomedan epoch.
