that the worship of the Sun is possibly referred to as a char-

The Land of Moab, of which Kir of Moab and Ar of
Moab were the principal cities, was pe0pled by Moab, the

Dead Sea. It was one of the most ancient cities of Palestine,

Isaiah xv. 5, it is declared that the fugitives from Moab
“shall' ﬂee unto Zoar”; the town is also mentioned by
Jeremiah (chap. xlviii. 34). In the time of the Crusaders
