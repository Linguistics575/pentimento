273 THE DESERT.

the spies went up to view the Promised Land, and hither
they returned with grapes of Eshcol, and other proofs of
abundant plenty, but also with tales of terrible warriors and
giants. Israel murmured, and at this place received the sen-
tence of forty years’ wandering in the desert (Numb. xiii.
xiv.) Here, when determined to invade the land in their
own strength, the Israelites were defeated by the Arnmonites,
and driven to Mount Seir (Deut. i. 44.). Thirty-eight years

important place, but now shows nothing but its clumps of
palm and rushes, and its wells of water.

It was at this pass that Israel was defeated, when after
their rebellion and condemnation, “they. presumed to go up
unto the hill-top,” to force their entrance into Canaan,
“ and the Amalekites came down and the Canaanites which
dwelt in that hill, and smote them.” And no wonder,
