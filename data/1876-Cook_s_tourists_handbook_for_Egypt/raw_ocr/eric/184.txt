. THEBES. 165

On the eastern bank are situated the Temples of Luxor and
Karnak.

The Temple Of Koorneh is situated at the entrance
of the gorge leading to Bab-el-Molook. It was reared to
the memory of Rameses I. by his son Sethi, and is indeed
a cenotaph; it belongs to the same era as the temple at
Abydos (p. 151), and is similar in the style and ﬁnish of its
artistic decorations. Entering by the central portal into the
Hall of the Six Columns and penetrating to the third
chamber on the right, there is an admirable head of Sethi,
scarcely yielding the palm to the ﬁnest of those on the walls
of Abydos. When Sethi died the temple was incomplete,
and it was ﬁnished by his son Rameses IL, who consecrated
it to the memory of his father as well as to Rameses I., to
whom it was originally dedicated.

The Tombs 0f the King‘s are in the desolate valley of
Bab-el-Molook, which has been called the St. Denis of the
nineteenth and twentieth dynasties. In an adjacent valley,
not generally visited, lie the monarchs of the eighteenth
dynasty.

All the tombs in this valley are excavated in the solid
rock, and were originally so built up and covered over as to
afford no trace of the spot where the royal mummy was
deposited. Twenty-ﬁve tombs have been opened—not all
kings however, princes and public functionaries are amongst
them—three of these tombs should be visited.

The Tomb Of Sethi I. (No. 17, {commonly called
Belzoni’s tomb) is the most magniﬁcent, grand and pro-
fusely adorned with sculptures. Belzoni found it had been
already opened when he discovered it half a century ago;
but every has-relief was then perfect, and every painting
as fresh as on the day of its production. Now, through
the ravages of antiquity-vendors and unscrupulous tourists,
