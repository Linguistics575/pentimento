HAGAR-SILSILEH. ‘ 135

There is a small and very dilapidated temple, built by
Ptolemy Physcon, close at hand. West of Edfou are marshes
where wild geese congregate.

Leaving Edfou, the tourist passes the ruins of the
fortiﬁed Arabian town of Booa’yb (on the E.), also the vil-
lage of Silureh on the same side. On the west bank the
ravine of Shut-el-Ragel is passed, in which some dis-
coveries of value to Egyptologists have been made. On
the same side, farther on, are the hills Gebel Aboo Ghabah,
in passing which gusty weather is often encountered.

Hégar—Silsileh, or Gebel Silsileh, the Mountain
of the Chain, is 92 miles from Luxor. Arab tradition
afﬁrms that at this point the navigation of the river was
stopped by a jealous king, who stretched a chain across the
narrow channel, which is little more than a thousand feet
broad at this point. On both sides of the river are quarries
from which the ancient kings procured the materials for
many of the Nile valley cities and monuments. The ancient
Silsilis stood on the east bank. The quarries and grottoes
on the west bank are the most interesting; the principal ,
grotto contains a much admired tableau of a goddess suck-
ling the infant Horus; the Triumph of Horus, the last
king of the eighteenth dynasty, is represented in another
striking bas-relief.

Speaking of the quarries of Hagar-Silsileh, Dr. Olin says,
“The mountain, for an extent of several miles, is cut into
yawning chasms and high threatening precipices, that, in
their dimensions and variety of forms, mimic the sublime
workmanship of nature. As the stone immediately on this
bank of the river was porous, and less adapted to architectural
purposes, passages were cut through these useless masses
into the heart of the mountain. I did not measure these
avenues, but am sure that several of them are nearly half
