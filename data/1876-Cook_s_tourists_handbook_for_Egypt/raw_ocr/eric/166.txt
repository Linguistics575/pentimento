ASYOOT. 147

foundations remain. Asyoot (pop. 25,000) is the capital of
Upper Egypt, and residence of the governor. It is a
considerable town, with some ﬁne mosques, bazaars, baths,
etc. The city lies more than a mile from the river, near
the foot of the mountain, and is really on an island formed
by a branch of the river. The latter is crossed by an
arched stone bridge, beyond which commences the ascent
of the mountain ﬁlled with tombs and grottoes. On
approaching the town, ﬁfteen minarets can be counted rising
from amongst the groves of palm and acacia. A

El Hamra, on the Nile bank, is the port of Asyoot.
From hence to the city there is a beautiful curving road

at the time of the annual inundation. The bazaars of this
city are very good; the private houses better than in most

cloth, earthenware, woollen, and opium. The pipe bowls
of Asyoot are the best in the East, and large numbers are
sent to the bazaars at Cairo and elsewhere. The caravans for
Nubia and Darfur usually start from, and return to, this place.

view is very ﬁne, comprising “ about a hundred miles of the
valley of the N ile—a vast level panorama, bounded by the
chains of the Arabian and Libyan hills, diversiﬁed by every
shade of green, and watered by the N ile." The innumerable
tombs, of which the Stab! Autar is the principal, are inter-
esting from their Egyptian remains, and also from their
Christian associations, as being tenanted by monks and
hermits at a time when society seemed so h0pelessly rotten
that almost all “the salt of the earth ” was in voluntary exile
in the deserts and caves of Africa and Syria.

“ From the top of the ridge," says the Rev. W. Dale,
“ the view is indeed very striking. The height is about four
