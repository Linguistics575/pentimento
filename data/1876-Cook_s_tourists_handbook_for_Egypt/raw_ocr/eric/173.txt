154 THE NILE.

Keneh (395 miles from Cairo) is an important place
on the east bank of the Nile; ancient Caenopolis occupied
the site. It has long been noted for its dates and its danc-

in connection with this adoration. “ Nothing can be more

that adorn the massive pillars crowned with beads of Isis.
The ceilings are covered with the celebrated astronomical
paintings ; and the next most popular representation through-
