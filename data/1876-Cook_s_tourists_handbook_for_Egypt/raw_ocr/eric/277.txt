the sublime peaks of Mount Serbél.

The village of Feirén, the mediaeval Pharan, was once
an episcopal see. These mountains were then ﬁlled with
hermits, and a ﬂourishing monastery maintained. The ruins
still stand on almost every height, but the modern village
consists of ugly and comfortless mud huts. Numerous
capitals and broken shafts, etc., are all that remain of the
once important church.

In the beautiful Oasis of Feirén one or two days may be
well spent. In addition to the natural charms of the valley,
and the interest attaching to the ruins of the old episcopal
city, there are several attractions in the neighbourhood. The

an adjacent plain, and there is none such at Serbél. On the
edge of a precipice not far from the summit of Serbél are
the remains of an ancient beacon-tower. The view from the
top is extensive and very varied.

The Jebel-e1-Tahooneh, opposite the hill of El
Maharrad, is the traditional scene of the uplifting of the
hands of Moses by Aaron and Hur, whilst the battle between
Amalek and Israel raged below. There are remains of a

hill, and also remains of station chapels on the sides, show-

early ages of Christianity. The Jebel-el-Moneij ah
