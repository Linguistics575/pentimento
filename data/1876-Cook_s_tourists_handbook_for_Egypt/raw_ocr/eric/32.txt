STEAMBOATS AND DAHABEAHS.

DAHABEAH.

This is a private conveyance, and
you must have your own party,
or else make up one, when you
must put up with intimacy with
people who may prove very ob-
jectionable.

A select party may be formed for a
dahabeah.

Dahabeahs are private speculations
designed to make large proﬁts.

Charges are not strictly inclu-
‘sive.

Long, tedious, and doubtful bar-
gains have to be made.

Travel all night, and therefore much
of the scenery is lost to the tra-
veller.

May be, and often are, weeks
overdue, so that arrangements
for continuation of a. tour are
frustrated.

Great loss of time before embark-
ing in selection of Dahabeah,
preparing contract, etc.

You rush past all the glorious stop-
ping places, because the great
object is to get up stream ; and
you stop to visit on the return
journey, when the edge of the
interest is taken off.

Never know where you are to stop.

STEAMER.

A public conveyance, where every
one is independent, if he wishes
to be so.

80 may it for a special steamer,
without greater cost, as fourteen
or. ﬁfteen ﬁrst-class passengers
will charter one.

Steamers are provided by the State,
and not worked specially for

proﬁt.
Charges are strictly inclusive.

None are necessary as all expenses
are included in the fares, which
are ﬁxed by the KédiVic adminisr
tration.

Only travel by day, so that every
inch of the way is seen.

Steamers are punctual.

You have only to pay the tariff and
step on board.

As you see the places going up, so
you stop and examine them when
the interest is fresh. Then you
review them in the downward
journey.

Always know where you are to
st0p, so that telegrams can be
received.
