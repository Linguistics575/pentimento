1 32 THE NILE.

The Nile enters Egypt at Philae (p. 191), near which is
the First Cataract (p. 189), that of Assouan, which many tra-
vellers make the boundary of their Egyptian explorations.

From this point, the Nile is generally a tranquil, wind-

ten miles wide, hemmed in by scorching deserts and barren
mountains, yet glowing with beauty and fertility, and replete

all are now closed except those of Rosetta and Damietta.
The western (Rosetta) mouth is 1,800 feet wide, and about

broadest part. I

The greatest breadth of the Nile is about 2,000 feet, and
its average current about three miles per hour. From
Assouan to Cairo, 580 miles, the banks are completely
covered with all sorts of vegetables raised by the ceaseless
industry of the inhabitants.
