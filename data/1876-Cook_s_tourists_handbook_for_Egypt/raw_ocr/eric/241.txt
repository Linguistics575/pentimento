project of facilitating this route by a canal. In 1854. Said
Pasha invited M. Lesseps to Egypt, and granted certain
rights. After incessant labour with governments, and corn-
missions, and functionaries, and against obstacles without
number, a Company was started in 1858, in which 21,000
Frenchmen, headed by Prince Jerome, took shares. In two
months the whole capital of 200,000,000 francs was sub-
scribed, and in 1859 the work commenced. On November
18, 1862, Lake Timsah was ﬂooded with the waters of the
Mediterranean in the presence of a diplomatic gathering.
On August 15, 1865, communication. was opened between
the two seas by the passage of boats to Ismailia, and then
by the Fresh-Water Canal to Suez. In the springiof 1869 the
Bitter Lakes were ﬂooded, and the union of the Red Sea and
Mediterranean was complete. In November, 1869, the Canal
was opened with great festivities under the auspices of the
Empress Eugénie, the Emperor of Austria, the Crown Prince
of Prussia, and many other illustrious guests of the Khé-
dive’s.

The Pall Mall Gazette of December 11, 1869, says,

de Lesseps has reason to congratulate himself on an unques-
tionably grand success.” The Times, which had been some-
what hostile from the commencement, acknowledged that
“A work like this, successfully accomplished in the face of
so many obstacles, does honour to the French and the pro-
gress of modern science.” .

The great advantage of the Suez Canal is, of course, the
great decrease in the distance to be travelled between Europe
and India. It is about 11,200 miles from London or Ham-
burgh, by the Cape of Good H0pe to Bombay. By Suez it
is only 6332. This reduces the voyage by twenty-four days.
i From Marseilles or Genoa a saving of thirty days is effected,
