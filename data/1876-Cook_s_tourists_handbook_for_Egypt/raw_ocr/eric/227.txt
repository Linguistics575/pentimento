208 THE DESERT.

There are now only four monasteries in the Natron
Valley, but the ruins of many others can be traced.

The Dayr Macarius is reached by a dreary desert
ride. It is strongly defended against Arab attacks, and
great precaution is used in admitting strangers. In the
church are relics of the saint, and some ancient paintings.

The Dayr Suriéni is an interesting edifice. From
the convent wall the view‘ is very striking of the desert
wastes on the outside, and the beautiful garden within the
walls, watered from a well, from which a horse or mule is
always drawing up water. In the monastery very curious
illuminated MSS. have been discovered, the best of which
are now in English libraries. There are three churches
here. One of them is adorned with some very ﬁne wood
and ivory work.

The Dayr Amba BiShOi contains three churches
with some relics. The desert view from this building is
perhaps its most striking feature. _

The Dayr Baramoos is of high antiquity, as it is
said to date from the third century of the Christian era. A
high stone wall encloses about an acre of ground. There is
a large square entrance tower, a good-sized church, and some
ruined buildings. In the church are several lamps of coloured
glass, with Arabic sentences in blue on a white ground. It
is doubtful whether they are of Venetian or Syrian manufac-
ture, as in early times Venetian manufactories supplied the
East with goods to suit Oriental tastes. These lamps are
probably some of the oldest existing specimens of orna-
mental glass-work produced since classic times.
