,3 INTRODUCTORY.

Beni-Hassan are reached in half an hour. The northern grottoes
are high up on a hill to the left, and the Speos Artemidos
straight on in a valley eastward—both ought to be visited.
Towards noon the excursion is ended, and the steamer starts
again. A few hours’ course brings in sight the mountain
“ Gebel-abou-faydah,” and towards evening Manfaloot, a little
town of some importance, is reached.

FIFTH DAY.

Some time before mid-day, arrive at Asyoot, or Assioot, the
residence of a Pasha, the Inspector-General to Upper Egypt, of
which Assioot is the capital. The remainder of the day is
devoted to a visit to the large bazaar, and the hills behind the
town, which afford a splendid view of the Nile Valley. A very
important market is held at Assioot. Before the abolition of
slavery, it was the principal slave market ; but, minus this pecu-
liarity, it offers still, at the present time, interesting features for
the observer.

SIXTH DAY.

If necessary the ship is coaled at Soohag, and Girgeh is
generally reached in the evening; there is nothing of interest in
this place, one of the dirtiest on the Nile. Girgeh, or Bellianeh,
a small town about ten miles higher up, is the starting point for
visiting Abydos. This visit, however, is better postponed, and
made on the return journey, starting from Bellianeh. These
ruins are so grand and magniﬁcent that they cannot lose any of
their charm and novelty, even after Kamak has been seen.

SEVENTH DAY.

Leaving the visit to Abydos for the return journey, Keneh is
reached towards evening, and if still early enough, this important
place may be visited before the night. The best porous jugs
and gargoulets for ﬁltering the Nile water are made here ;
Keneh is also celebrated for its dates, and was once noted for
its dancing girls. The latter, it appears, have now removed to
Luxor, a place of greater attraction to visitors.
