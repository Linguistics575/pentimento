LUXOR AND KARNAK. ‘ ’ 179

a fellow obelisk is no longer standing ; the one seen in sin:
is the obelisk of the celebrated Queen-Regent Hatasou, who
played an important part in the history of the eighteenth
dynasty. From an inscription on the obelisk we learn that
it was surmounted by a small pyramid of pure gold, that the
whole column was gilded from top to bottom, and that the

its transportation from the quarries of Assouan, was only

chambers, etc., can be visited.

The has-reliefs on the exterior wall of the Great Hall

On the North Wall are the most valuable records of the

monarch against the Assyrians, Armenians of the desert,
etc. In one extraordinary symbolical scene the king, with
numerous arms, seizes his enemies by the hair and proceeds
to immolate them before the God of Thebes.

On the South Wall, commencing near the gateway at the
western end, are sculptures commemorating the victories of
Shishak. On a projecting wall farther east is written in
hieroglyphics the famous poem of “Pen-ta-our,” in which
the story of a feat of arms of Rameses II. in his wars against
the Khetas is handed down to posterity. Near this is a
copy of a treaty of peace concluded by the same great
monarch, also some battle pieces commemorating his vic-

catalogue the curiosities and marvels of Karnak. All that
