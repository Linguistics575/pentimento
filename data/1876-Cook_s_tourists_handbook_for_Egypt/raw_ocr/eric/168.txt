SOUHAG. 14.9

Near Gow (E.), are the ruins of Antaaopolis. In the
early part of last century, columns, etc., of great interest
were standing. Now there is little more than a confused
heap of stones. The whole village of Gow was carried
away in 182 3 by the waters of the Nile. ‘

The western mountains take a wide sweep from Gow to
Tahtah, enclosing a rich and well-cultivated plain.

Passing Mishte (W.), Shabeka (W.), and other unim-

motives, under the protection of the Muslim Saint Abou
Shenoodeh. It has been ruined and sacked several times,
lastly in 1812, by the Memlooks, who, however, could not

basilica. The exterior was built in the Egyptian style, by the
Empress Helena, at the edge of the Libyan desert, where it
stands desolate and alone amongst the sand. The Red
Monastery is, perhaps, the more ancient of the two.

Ekhmeeln (E.) is a tolerably well-built town of wide
streets, and a considerable corn and poultry town. Coarse
cottons, especially the fringed shawls of the Nile boatmen,

are manufactured here; also earthenware. The town con-
