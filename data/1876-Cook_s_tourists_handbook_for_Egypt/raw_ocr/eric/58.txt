MANNERS AND CUSTOMS. 41

It is an error to suppose that Eastern women live in
prison-like seclusion. They are less under restraint in Egypt
than in any other Mahomedan country, and go out freely so
long as the face is kept veiled. Muslim law forbids a
woman’s face to be seen by men, except only by husbands,
fathers, or sons. A stranger, entering a small house, where
there is no reception-room, shouts out desfoor (permission), or

It is a recreative enjoyment, as well as a salutary and health-
