262 THE DESERT.

no human lips; and from the bold bluff of Sufséfeh the voice
of God pronounced those Ten Words which are the ﬁnal
summary of all human duty."

Jebel Moosa was for ages the traditional Sinai. The
ascent is by a grand ravine behind the Convent. The stones
have been adjusted to form rude steps. The beautiful Spring
called “the, Fountain of Moses,” shaded by a huge
rock, is reached after half-an-hour’s climbing. Here Moses
is said to have watered the ﬂocks of Jethro.

A Chapel of the Virgin, commemorative of deliver-
ance from a famine, is next passed, with the usual ornaments,
and some paintings. According to another statement, this
chapel was built in memory of the extirpation of ﬂeas in the
adjacent convent. After climbing some distance farther,
the two gateways are passed under, at which, formerly,
pilgrims confessed to St. Stephanos and his successors, and
were shriven before ascending to the holy heights. The
'rude Chapels of Elijah and Elisha, with their common
court, now a refuge for goats and ibexes, stand on a little
plateau, with a beautiful cypress, seventy-ﬁve feet high, and a
Spring of water close at hand. Monkish tradition locates
here the sublime scene in I Kings xix. 9, 10, when Elijah,
ﬂeeing from the wrath of Jezebel, sought a refuge in “the
Mount of God,” and after wind and earthquake and ﬁre had
passed by, heard “ the still small voice ” speaking words of
comfort and promise. Half-an-hour's ascent by a steep
rugged path, conducts to the summit. The asserted print
of Mahomed’s camel’s foot, made in his famous night ride
from Mecca to Sinai and back, may be viewed 1n passing.

The summit of Jebel Moosa IS about 7000 ft. above
the sea level and 2000 above the Convent. A Chapel
(still used), a Mosque (only used for an annual sacriﬁce),
and some ruins, occupy a small level space of solid rock.
