room to pass in single ﬁle, and sometimes a de’tour must be
made in consequence of the shore path being closed.
Myriads of curious and beautiful shells in endless variety,
and some of them very rich, lie on this wild shore.

’Akabah is an Arab village at the north east end of the
gulf. About forty soldiers keep guard in its sixteenth
century castle. It derives its importance as a station on the
great pilgrim route from Egypt to Mecca. A vessel comes
annually with supplies from Suez.

’Akabah is in itself ﬁtted to be a great place. It stands
on a convenient plain surrounding the head of the bay, at

silver, and precious stones and other treasures, till copper
became as iron, and gold as silver in the streets of the holy
city (see 1 Kings ix. 26, and 2. Chron. viii. 17). When
Edom rebelled against Judah, Elath was lost for a time (2
