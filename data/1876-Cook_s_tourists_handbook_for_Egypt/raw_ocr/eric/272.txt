a man, whose best garment is an untanned sheepskin, will
wear a sword, or shoulder a gun, or both; at least two of
every three of the Alewi have slung on their backs ﬂint-lock
guns of very long barrel, often in such a condition that a
discharge, however well aimed, would be more dangerous to
the man who ﬁres than to him who is ﬁred at; these they
carry with them everywhere. Yet they are apparently a
cheerful, contented race, very much like the American
Negroes in their simplicity, thoughtlessness, and good
humour. Their bread is a coarse, dark, barley cake , their
dwellings are simple, low tents made of goats' hair, which
shelter from rain but in other respects‘are quite uncomfort-
able 5 hence, in cold weather, they resort, if possible, to
caves. None of them fail to understand the word backsheesh 5
it is the ﬁrst word the young child learns, the last the old
man utters.”

At Wédy-ed—Dehseh the traveller feels that he
is really traversing the desert; nothing breaks the monotony
of the level stretch of sand. It is in this neighbourhood that
the Khamseen wind and sand storm have so frequently been
encountered. “ Soon the Red Sea and all,” says Dean
Stanley, “ were lost in a sand storm which lasted the whole
day. Imagine all distant objects entirely lost to view—the
sheets of sand ﬂeeting along the surface of the desert like
streams of water; the whole air ﬁlled, though invisibly, with
a tempest of sand driving in your face like sleet; imagine
the caravan toiling against this—the Bedouins, each with his
shawl thrown completely over his head, half the riders sitting
backwards—the camels, meanwhile, thus virtually left with-
out guidance, though from time to time throwing their long
necks sideways to avoid the blast, yet moving straight on-
wards with a painful sense of duty truly edifying to
behold.”
