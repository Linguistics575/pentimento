long before Egypt was ever heard of—the builders, the
storms of the desert; the materials with which they were

Nukhl is thirty hours’ journey farther, where the terri-
tory of the Tawarah Arabs terminates. Here Tiyahah Arabs
are in possession, and the traveller must change his escort,
unless no Tiyﬁhahs are forthcoming. In that case the

of Rehoboth (Gen. xxvi. 22).

From this Wédy, Gaza (Ghuzzeh) (see p. 282) can be
reached in thirteen hours. ‘
