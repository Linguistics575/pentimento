188 THE NILE.

The Island of Elephantine faces Assouan. One
of its Arabic names signiﬁes “Island of Flowers.” Whilst
at Assouan the Egyptian element predominates in the
population, at Elephantine the traveller ﬁnds himself
surrounded by N ubians.

“ The N ubians,” says Bartlett, “are tall and slender
in person—far less massive in build than the Theban Arabs.
There is something of elegance in their general appearance,
and the cast of their features is rather intellectual. They
are of a soft dusky black or bronze tint, with a very ﬁne skin,
and they delight to oil their bodies, and to load their sable
ringlets with unguents anything but odoriferous to the
European nose. Their women have often elicited the rap :
turous remarks of travellers, in whose eyes they move about
like so many sable Venuses, realizing the description of our
Mother Eve, as being, when ‘ unadorned, adorned the most:
their sole costume, in this serene and glowing climate, being
an apron round the middle, and somewhat of the slenderest,

small shells.”

Elephantine is now a picturesque island of mingled palm
groves and mounds of ruins, with very few remains of its
former importance and grandeur. Pharaonic, Persian, Greek,
Roman splendour—all is gone. About seventy years ago,
when the Egyptian Commission visited the island, there was
a half-demolished ediﬁce, called the Temple of the North,
and . another admirably proportioned building called the
Temple of the South, built by Amunoph III. The stone'
of these two temples was used by the Governor of
Assouan in 1822, to build a palace, and all that remains now
is a badly-executed statue of Osiris, bearing the name of
Menephthah (son of Rameses II.), of the nineteenth dynasty.
This forms a part of the fagade of Amunoph’s temple. A
