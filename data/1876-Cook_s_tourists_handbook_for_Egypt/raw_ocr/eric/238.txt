. SUEZ. 219

Suez, at the north-west head of the gulf of the same
name, is nearly. seventy miles east of Cairo. It is a walled
town on three sides, open to the sea on the north-east. The
houses are in general poorly built. There are several khans
built round large courts, and many open spaces. There is the
usual Eastern bazaar, and some European shops. - Suez has
always been of importance as a place of transit for the
merchandise and productions of the East from the Red Sea
to the Nile. The modern town of Suez only dates from the
sixteenth century, when Selim I. and Solyman II. had ﬂeets
on the Red Sea. It was preceded anciently by the cities of
Arsinoé and Clysma. As a station on the pilgrimage route
to Mecca, and also in connection with the Overland route to
India, the town has maintained its importance, though chieﬂy
as a place of transit. The scarcity of water has always been
a hardship. Since the construction of the Fresh-Water Canal
this grievance has been remedied. During the progress of
the works for the Ship Canal the population rose to 14,000.
Since the completion of these works there has been a decline.
“ Suez,” says F. B. Zincke, “is in a state of rapid decay.
Many houses are untenanted. This has been caused by the
diversion of the trafﬁc. What formerly passed through the
town now passes by it on the Canal." Still, the important
position of the place must always insure a certain amount of
life and prosperity.

It is a capital place at which to observe the two great
tides of life ﬂowing from England to India, and from India
to England.

“’The mail train to-day," says J. MacGregor, “ has ﬁlled
all the corridors of our hotel with passengers straight from
England, the faces of many blooming with youth, and others
freshened up for another spell of service by a year’s leave at
home. Their talk is of the latest London news and the
