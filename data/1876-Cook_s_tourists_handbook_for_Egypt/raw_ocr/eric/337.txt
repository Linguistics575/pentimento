PALESTINE ITINERARIES-

We commence with the shortest of our tours, and extend the arrangements
to the longest, embracing the Desert and the country east of the Jordan.

FIRST ITINERARY.

For a. Ten Days’ Tour in Judea.

Land at Jaﬂ'a, and after stopping a day there, go by carriages or riding
horses to Jerusalem, crossing the plains of Sharon by Yﬁsur, Beit Dejan, to
Ramleh, Valley of Ajalon, Kirjath-Jearim, Kolonieh (the traditional
Emmaus), ten hours to Jerusalem by carriage in one day ; twelve hours on
horseback in two days. For all possible journeys carriages will be provided
at the yerumlem Hotel, Jaﬁ'a. Jerusalem to Mar Saba, seven hours’ riding,
by Rachel’s Tomb, Solomon’s Pools, Bethlehem, She herds’ Field, and
over the hills of the Wilderness of Judea ; encamp in t e Kedron Valley,
near by the convent of Mar Saba. Second Day from Jerusalem, ride over
the hills of Judea to the plain of the Dead Sea, tarry there about an hour,
giving time to bathe, and then ride to the Jordan, lunch on its banks, bathe
in its stream, and then ride across the plain to the site of Jericho, and
encamp near the Fountain of Elisha, at foot of the Mountain of Tempta-
tion : eight hours in the saddle. On the Third Day travel back to Jerusalem,
ascending the hilly road by the brook Cherith, Enshemesh, Bethany, Mount
of Olives, and by the site of Gethsemane, and across the Valley of Jeho-
shaphat to Jerusalem. The stay at Jerusalem can be regulated by the time
of sailing from Jatfa. The tour may occupy from ten to fourteen days.
The return journey from Jaffa may be either by the direct road, via Kirjath-
Jearim and Ramleh, or by Mizpah (Neby Samwil),Gibeon, Upper and Lower
Bethhoron, Gimzo, Lydda, and direct over plains of Sharon, or round by
Ramleh to Jaﬂ'a. The Bethhoron road will occupy two days of moderate
travel. The journey the direct way can be made in a day, either by carriage or
by tolerably good riders on horseback. The descent of nearly 3000 feet from
Jerusalem to the sea is favourable to the rider in that direction, whether by
carriage or in the saddle. At Jatfa, the returning traveller is subject to the
caprice of winds, waves, and irregular steamboat sailings, which frequently
render embarkation a matter of great uncertainty. Nevertheless it is neces-
sary to be there at the time appointed for sailing, and if the steamer is seen
to go past in the distance, wait patiently for the next.
