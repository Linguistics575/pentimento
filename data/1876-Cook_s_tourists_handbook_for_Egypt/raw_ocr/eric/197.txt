I 78 THE NILE.

Endless it would be to enter into details of this marvellous
pile; sufﬁce it to say that the temple is about one mile and
three quarters in circumference, the walls eighty feet high
and twenty-ﬁve feet thick.”

The visitor enters the temple by the enormous propylon,
370 feet in breadth, and with one tower standing 140 feet in
height; this tower can be ascended, and a good view
of the plan of the ruins Obtained. Through a court
surrounded by corridors, and with a small temple built by
Rameses III., another immense propylon is reached with
statues of Rameses III. in red granite, and the Grand Hall
is then entered, whose columns are alluded to in the extract
given above. The most ancient cartouches in this hall are
those of Sethi I. (1450 13.0.), but there is reason to infer
that Sethi was not the constructor of this hall, but that to
Amunoph III. is due the honour of its erection. Originally
the hall was completely roofed in—daylight only came in by
the grilled Windows, of which traces are still visible; the
hall would therefore be pervaded, as M. Mariette points out,
by a sort of “dim religious light” very favourable to the
general effect by softening the crudity of the paintings on
the columns and ceilings.

Through another pr0pylon, much dilapidated, anarrow
court running across the building is entered 3 here once
stood two obelisks of red granite, only one is now standing.
The names of Thothmes I. and Rameses II. are inscribed.

A smaller propylon conducts to a court surrounded by
Osiride pillars,* in which is standing the largest obelisk
known, being ninety-twofeet in height and eight feet square,

"‘ By this term is described the columns frequent in Egyptian
arhitecture, in which a ﬁgure of Osiris is “ adossé ” (as the French
say) to the column.
