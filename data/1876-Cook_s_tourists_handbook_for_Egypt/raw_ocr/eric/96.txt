ALEXANDRIA ‘TO CAIRO. 79

best possible terms, notwithstanding the difference in their
size and habits. Beautiful little sac sacs (lapwings) fly about
like butterﬂies, while enormous cranes pull the feathers out of
their own necks with slow patience. The dromedaries and
buffaloes, which constantly meet each other on the road parallel
to the railway, look on tranquilly as the trains pass, with the
impassible serenity of Normandy cows, not to be disturbed
by steam whistles or engines.”

The tourist will be interested in watching the various in-
dustries of the people, as seen from the railway. Watering
the land seems to be one of the chief, and this is done by the
most old-fashioned appliances. The shadoqf and the sakieh
are both seen in frequent operation ; and as these are notable
Egyptian institutions, which will everywhere meet the tra-
veller’s eye as long as he journeys in the land, it would be
better once for all to describe them.

The shadoqf is the arrangement most in vogue. It con-

pivot, at the other end a bucket, or large water-tight basket,
which is lowered to the water and ﬁlled, and, as theheavy
end of the pole goes down, turns out its contents into a little
gutter, whence it is worked by the foot into the appointed
channels. Sometimes this is superseded by the sakieh, which
is a water-mill of cogged wheels, turned by a buﬂ'alo, or per-
chance a camel, each revolution of the wheel working up a
series of earthen pitchers, which empty themselves into a
trough or pool. More primitive still is the practice, in fre-

trivance.. Two men stand in the stream or canal with a
waterproof basket between them, which they swing as regu-
larly as clockwork, and throw the water on to the bank, where
another stands ready to divert it into its proper place. It was
in contrast to this style of work, that it was said in Scripture
