PYRAMIDS OF GHIZEH. 1 13

through the solid masonry, and leading to the true entrance
to the Pyramid, is now choked up with rubbish.

At the present day the visitor enters at about forty feet
from the base of the northern side, and descends by a
massive vaulted gallery to a subterranean chamber,
347 feet from the entrance, and about 90 feet below the base
of the Pyramid. This chamber measures 46 feet by 27 feet,
and is about 11 feet in height. Mariette Bey argues that
the builders of the Pyramid intended this chamber to be
mistaken for the principal chamber of the Pyramid, and so
serve to conceal the real resting-place of the royal mummy.

At rather more than sixty feet from the entrance, an
upward passage, once carefully closed with an immense
block of stone, leads towards the centre of the Pyramid.
At a distance of 125 feet, it reaches what is called the Great
Gallery.

At this point is the opening to what is called the
Well, 191 ft. deep (communicating with the subterranean
chamber above described), which was probably used for
communication with various parts by the workmen in con-
structing the Pyramid.

Before ascending the Great Gallery, a horizontal passage
is seen, 110 feet in length, leading to a chamber 18 feet by
17 feet, and 20 feet high, known as the Queen’s Cham—
ber. Mariette Bey supposes that the entrance to the Great
Gallery was once hermetically sealed; so that if successful
in reaching the chamber now under notice, explorers might
be led to suppose that the whole secret of the Pyramid was
revealed. .

But the Great Gallery, 151 feet long, 7 feet wide, and
28 feet high, with a surface of smooth polished stone, leads
upwards to a vestibule once closed with immense granite

portcullises.
