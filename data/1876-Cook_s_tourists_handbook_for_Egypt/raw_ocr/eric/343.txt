Fifth Day.—From the Jordan, crossing the river above its outlet into
the Dead Sea, and making the journey of about seven hours to Heshbon.

Sixth Day. ——To Mount N ebo and back, the camp remaining at
Heshbon.

Seventh Day. -—From Heshbon to Rabbath Ammon, via Elealeh,
seven hours’ journey.

Eighth and Ninth Days—From Rabbath Ammon to Jerash (Gerasa)
by the course of the river Jabbok. This journey will require two days of
about seven hours each, the camp to be ﬁxed where most convenient for water.

to E5 Salt (or Ramoth Gilead). .

Eleventh Day.—--Es Salt to Jericho, nine hours.

Twelfth Day.—Jericho to Jerusalem by the road already described.
Deducting the two days allowed for the journey from Jafi'a to Jerusalem,
this tour to Moab will be accomplished in ten days of actual travel, taking
the circuitous route t‘t'om Jerusa em to Mar Saba and the Dead Sea. A
longer route is given in the next itinerary.

TENTH ITINERARY.
A More Extended Tour East. of the Jordan.

Taking the course described in the Ninth Itinerary as far as Rabbath-
Ammon, seven days of travel from Jaﬂ'a or ﬁve days from Jerusalem, from
which point we take our calculation, and begin on the

Sixth Day.——From Rabbath-Ammon to Es-Salt (Ramoth Gilead).

Seventh Day—Front Jerash to Wédy Zabeis (J abesh Gilead), via Suf
A’Glun to Helaweh, a journey of seven hours.

hirteenth Day. —From Mes-el-Jabel to Baniﬁs (Caesarea Philippa) via

From Baniz‘is to Damascus, the route has been already described in a
journey of two days, halting for a night at Kefr Hauwar. Three days
more from Damascus to Baalbec, and two days from Baalbec to Beyrout.
A Tour of twenty days of actual travel from Jerusalem, and with necessary
stoppages such a Tour ought to have forty days allotted to it, though with
hard work it might be got over in thirty days.

These Tours to the east of the Jordan would require the special pro-
tection of the local sheikhs, and would‘involve costs for this protection,
varying in amount in proportion to the number of the parties. This would
have to be arranged by special contract at the time, as no ﬁxed charges can
be satisfactorily arra ed. Mr. Floyd is as capable as any man to handle
these black-mail exactions. ,
