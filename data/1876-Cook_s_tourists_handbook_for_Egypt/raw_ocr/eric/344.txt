ELEVENTH ITINERARY.

instead of repeating any of the routes leading to Damascus.

and the river Awaj.

Second Day.—From Burak to Dama via El Mismiyeh (Phaene), Shai-
rah, and Samma, seven and a half hours.

Sabineh, six hours.

To make this tour, a fortnight would have to be added to a Palestine
tour which would include Damascus.

TOURS 'I'O PALMY BA

Can be made from Damascus in twelve days for the double journey, but
Palmyra is under the power of rapacious sheikhs, and eat care has to be
observed in arranging for a tour to that city of grand ruins.

TWELFTH ITINERARY.
Tour to the Great Desert and Palestine.

We conclude the series of Itineraries by indicating the general route
from Egypt to Sinai, Petra, Mount Hor, and Palestine.

Forty days are required for the journey from Cairo to Sinai, Petra, and
by Mount Hor to Hebron and Jerusalem. We have not at command the
details of the tours made through the Desert by parties travelling under our
arrangements in the last two seasons. One of these parties was headed by
Dr. Strong, of Drew Seminary, and consisted of ten or. eleven energetic
and enthusiastic explorers. The party had with them a photographer, who
took home a fine collection of photographs, which were exhibited in the
Photographic Hall of the Centennial Exhibition. An extensive map has
also been prepared by two gentlemen of the party, and other educational
results of their great tours may be antici ated. Without attempting to
deﬁne the course of these and other traveilers for whom we have had the

honour to arrange, we may say here brieﬂy that we can take engagements
non-r. b
