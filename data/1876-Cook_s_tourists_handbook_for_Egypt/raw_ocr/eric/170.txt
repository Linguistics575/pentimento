.The Temple of Sethi, called by Strabo the Mem-
nonium, and so celebrated for its magniﬁcent decoration, was
built by Sethi I., father of Rameses II. As in all the work
undertaken by order of Sethi, the art displayed wins uni-
versal admiration, unlike the sculptures of the reign of
Rameses, which are not ﬁrst-rate, and indeed are often negli-
gently executed.

“ The bas-reliefs are the most beautiful in Egypt,” says
Viscountess Strangford ; “indeed, there is nothing equal to
them in Egyptian art, except the paintings in the tomb of
this same King Sethi at Thebes. In earlier periods art was
far more naturalistic; but what we may call Egyptian art
proper was, in the reign of Sethi, the most perfect of all. It
is beautiful, vivid, and highly picturesque, although com-
pletely subject to the arbitrary rules imposed by the priests
on the artists, in accordance with the elaborate theocratic
system of government that extended through all the minutiae
of life."

This temple was dedicated to seven gods, and has seven
vaulted naves lying east and west, ending in seven sanc-
tuaries, and communicating with two immense halls running
north and south. There are also some other smaller
chambers. Everywhere are highly-ﬁnished sculptures and
hieroglyphics.

The roof of this temple is the only one of its kind in
Egypt. Immense stones were laid, not on their faces, but
on their sides, across from one architrave to the other; then
an arch was cut through this mass of stone, and adorned
with hieroglyphics and sculptures.

M. Mariette, by whose recent excavations these wonder-
ful buildings have been largely brought to light from the
sand which enveloped them, points out that from the pre-
sence everywhere of Sethi and Rameses together in the.
