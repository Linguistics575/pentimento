“Thus, saith the Lord, I will destroy the idols, and I
will cause their images to cease out of Noph (Memphis, p.
12 5) 5 and there shall be no more a prince of the land of
Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt. And I
will make Pathros (a district of Thebes extending from the
Delta on the north to Philoe on the south) desolate, and will
set ﬁre in Zoan (Tom's, p. 243), and will execute judgments
in No (Thebes, p. 164.). And I will pour my fury upon
Sin (Pelusium), the strength of Egypt; and I will cut oﬁ the
multitude of No. The young men of Aven (Heliopolz's,
p. 124) and of Pi-beseth (Bulvastz's, p. 216) shall fall by the
sword, etc.” (Ezek. xxx. 13—17). Other interesting
allusions will be found at Ps. lxxviii. 12, lxxxi. 5; Zech. x.
10 3 Ezek. xxix.—xxxii.; Joel iii. 19, etc., etc. '
