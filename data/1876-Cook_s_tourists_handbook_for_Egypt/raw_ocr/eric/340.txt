of about six hours. Contrive, if possible, to spend Sunday at this deeply
interesting, historical village, where ancient sites are the subjects of con-
tention between Greek and Latin Christians, and where a beautiful ediﬁce
has been erected for Protestant worship.

Tenth Day. -—Travel from Nazareth to Carmel, crossing the riverKishon,
and passing near to the place of sacriﬁce. Caifa, at foot of Mount Carmel,
is being rapidly brought under cultivation by acolony of Germans, who
have built an hotel and a number of cottages. Here a day or two may be
pleasantly spent if the travelling and steamer arrangements are carefully
calculated. The Austrian Lloyds steamers call at Caifa on their passage
both ways between Alexandria and Constantinople. The tour should be
arranged to harmonize with the steamboat service, which is fortnightly
both ways.

SIXTH ITINERARY.

Embracing all of the Fifth as far as Caifa, and including
the Coast Route by Tyre and Sidon to Beyrout.

After the ten days of travel described in the Fifth Itinerary, the Sixth
Tour may be accomplished by four additional days, as shown below :—

Eleventh Day.—Travel from Caifa to Acre, visit the ancient fortress,
and encamp at Achzib—not a heavy day if the weather is favourable. Five
or six hours in the saddle.

Twelfth Day.—Ascend the ladder of Tyre—a rough and difﬁcult way,
greatly improved—to the city of Tyre. Ancient fountains, the reputed
,tomb of Hiram, King of Tyre, and submerged ruins, engage the attention
of travellers here, where the camp will be stationed for a night, after a ride
of perhaps six to seven hours.

Thirteenth Day.—Travel by Sarepta to Sidon, another moderate riding
day of six or seven hours, to the camping-ground at Sidon, the city so
frequently associated in the sacred history with Tyre.

Fourteenth Day.—From Sidon to Beyrout is a coast journey of seven to
eight hours, and this day completes our Sixth Itinerary. Beyrout is a
delightful place to rest in after a journey through Palestine and there is
more certainty of embarking than at Jaﬂ'a.

SEVENTH ITINERARY.
The Beaten Track of a Thirty Days’ Tour in Palestine.

This itinerary has been frequently described in the programmes of our
Personally-conducted Tours. In the late autumn we prefer to travel from
north to south, thus going with the season. In the spring the contrary way
is preferable, as the way of the Lebanon and Mount Hermon is frequently
snowed up in the early part of the year.

Seven travelling days are shown in the Fifth Itinerary to Jenin, and
from that point we travel on the

Eighth Day—To Nazareth, crossing the Plain of Esdraelon by Jezreel,
Gideon’s Fountain, Shunem, leaving to the right Nain, Endor. Mount
Tabor, etc., and going by Shunem, across the plain to the foot of the
Galilean Hills, the ascent of which to Nazareth requires great care, it being
very precipitous, and moderate riders must not expect to accomplish the
