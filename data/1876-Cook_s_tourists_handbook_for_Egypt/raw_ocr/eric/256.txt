grass clothes the surface of the ground. There are many
Springs, perennial but warm, and in some cases sulphurous, in
this Oasis.

The chief ruins are about seven miles from the capital,
El Kbérgeh, and are rendered picturesque by their surround-

columns, once forming an avenue, lead up to the Great
Temple, dedicated to Amun-ra. Hieroglyphics and colossal
ﬁgures profusely adorn the facade; a doorway, with ﬁne

decorated with carvings.

There are three interesting gateways near by. On one
Darius is shown adoring Amun-ra, Osiris, and Isis; on
another an edict of Galba is inscribed. There are about two
hundred tombs in the adjacent necropolis of very obscure
origin, Christian and Egyptian symbols are both plentiful.

The inhabitants of the Oases are very bigoted Maho-

wish to roll back the tide of progress, abolish all the
Frankish ideas and customs, which have lately gained ground
in Egypt, and make Islam once more an intolerant foe to
every belief except its own.

just above their junction, measuring about 600 yards across
the Damietta branch and 500 across the Rosetta branch;
