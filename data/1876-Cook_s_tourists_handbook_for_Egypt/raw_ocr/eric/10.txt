PREFACE.

THE present volume is intended as a Handbook for Tourists,
and does not pretend to guide those who need a work to
assist them in elaborate research or scientiﬁc investigation.
So far as it has been deemed desirable to enter into minute
details, accuracy has been aimed at as the great essential;
but the object of this Handbook is rather to point out what-
ever is most worthy of special notice, and to intensify and
ﬁx general impressions, than to enter minutely into matters
of study for which the Tourist, as a rule, has little Oppor—
tunity. '

For the same reason, “ Egyptology ” has only been
touched upon when absolutely necessary to a rational com-
prehension of the monuments described. Those who, as a
result of their Tour, are incited to make wider and deeper
investigations, will ﬁnd no difﬁculty, on their return, in sup-
plementing their general impressions with profounder know-
ledge from the pages of Wilkinson, Bunsen, Lane, Mariette
Bey, and others.

Thanks to the extraordinary deve10pment of modern
travel, the Second Cataract of the Nile, or the peaks of
Mount Sinai are no longer the shadowy and. mysteriou.»
