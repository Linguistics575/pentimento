and supply all necessary camp equipments for tours through the Desert ;
and in every engagement of this kmd we will employ none but the most
trustworthy dragomans, who will do justice to the travellers as well as to
ourselves. A graduated scale of charges, according to the number of party,
is adopted; and we can take engagements for Desert travelling nearly as
cheap as for Palestine. But the details and conditions of such tours are
best settled by private negotiation, and we are ready to go into them as
soon as required.

 

NILE TOURS TO THE FIRST & SECOND GATARAGTS.

Our reference to these tours in connection with this series of itineraries
will be very brief. For eight years the agency for Nile tours has been
committed to us by the Khedivie Administration. During that time con-
stant im rovements have been made in the service; steamers have been
ﬁtted w1th deck saloons, and the sleepin berths greatly improved.
The food supplies have been under our contro to a great extent, and will be
emphatically so in the future, as we intend to exercise more rigid regulations
for the interest and comfort of voyagers. Contractors, dragomans, and
servants of every grade will be most vigilantly watched and rigidly dealt
with if any incivility or inattention is shown to passengers. Last season’s
extension of arrangements for the Second Cataract will be improved, and
we ho e ere long to see a class of steamers on the Nile that will ensure a
large assenger traﬂic.

The semce of steamers commences in November, and Nile trips may
precede or follow tours to Palestine as most convenient to the travellers who
wish to embrace the two objects in one visit to the East. The trips to the
First Cataract and back occupy twenty days, and ﬁfteen more are allowed
for trips to the Second Cataract.

DAHJmEAHs can also be secured on the best terms for all who desire
them, and dragomans and other necessary servants and food supplies can be
arranged by us on the best terms. Our omce at Cairo, on the grounds of
Shepheard 5 Hotel, affords excellent facilities for the management of this
miness. Early application is necessary to secure the best boats and the

t men.

generally at least three parties under personal escort for the months of
