GEBEL ABOUFAYDAH. 1 4,5

tourists will call to mind one of the many copies of this
picture in books on Egypt, the two hundred men toiling at
the ropes, the huge statue on the sledge, the man on the
pedestal easing the passage of the sledge with oil, and the
man on the statue heating time that all may pull together 3
doubtless all is quite familiar, and the tourist as he steams
past Ed Dayr may be interested in remembering that the
original is underground behind that village.

Rammoon (W.), is near the site of the ancient Shmoun,
called by the Greelts Herm0polis Magna, as being dedicated
to Thoth the Egyptian Hermes. The remains cover four
miles of ground. Ibeum, where the ibis mummies from
Hermopolis were buried, was at the foot of the Libyan
hills.

Several places of no great importance are next passed.
Amongst them are Daro’ot Oshmdon (W.), Mellawee (W.),
Isbciyda (E.), Hadji Kandeel (with its eighteenth dynasty
grottoes of Tel-el-Amérna), Howarte (E.), Daro’ot es/z
Sheréef (W.), near which the Bahr Yoosqf, or Canal Joseph,
leaves the Nile and runs along at the foot of the Libyan
hills past Behnesa to the Fyoom, and the Christian town
of Ed Dayr—el-Kossayr (E.) ‘ During this portion of the
journey the ﬁrst wild specimens of the Theban Palm, or
dOm-tree, will be seen. The whole district teems with
Egyptian grottoes and ruins; all the hills along the eastern
shore are full of square holes, marking deserted tombs.

Passing yep/wean on the west, the tremendous rocks of
Dj ebel, or Gebel Aboufaydah, are reached. These
extend ten or twelve miles along the eastern shore of the
Nile. Far up among the clefts of these grand cliffs are seen
the caverns where dwelt the celebrated ascetics of Upper
Egypt, and where Athanasius for a time sought shelter.
Innumerable tombs line the terraces of these rocks. Rough
