masonry reaches 28% feet down. The other well is 5 feet in
diameter and 4.2 feet deep to the water. The action of the
ropes for so many centuries has worn deep grooves in the
kerb-stones round the wells, so that they “look as if frilled
or ﬂuted all round.” In the bed of the Wédy is a group of
ﬁve smaller wells. The foundations and ruins of a moderately-
sized town are scattered over some low hills to the north of
the two principal wells. The vicinity is quite bare of either
trees or shrubs.

Beersheba, or Beershaba, as it is called in the earlier
records, is mentioned again in connection with Isaac, who
tarried here after digging the wells in the valley of Gerar
made by his father, which the Philistines had stopped up.
Here God renewed the Promise, and here a fresh treaty was
made with Abimelech, king of the Philistines (Gen. xxvi.)

hence the patriarch set forth with his sons, “ and their little
ones, and their wives, in the waggons which Pharaoh had
sent to carry him.” Beersheba is next mentioned as one of
the towns on the southern boundary of the tribe of Judah
(Joshua xv. 28). In xix. 2 it is given to the tribe of
Simeon; see also I Chron. iv. 28. The sons of Samuel
“were judges in Beersheba ” (1 Samuel viii. 2). The expresm
sion, “from Dan to Beersheba," as in Judges xx. 1, and in
other passages—or “from Beersheba to Dan,” as in I Chron.
xxi. 2, and elsewhere—became a familiar mode of signifying
the whole of the Land of Israel; as in after times, when the
ten tribes had revolted, “from Geba to Beersheba," as in
2 Kings xxiii. 8, etc., or “from Beersheba to Mount
Ephraim,” as in 2' Chron. xix. 4, etc., signiﬁed the extent of
