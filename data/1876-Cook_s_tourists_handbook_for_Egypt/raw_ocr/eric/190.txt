smaller statues not far from the principal ones just de-
scribed.

The so-called Temple of Medeenet—Haboo consists
of the ruins of two temples, one of Thothmes III. and
another of Rameses III. In these ruins, under the Empire,
3 Coptic cathedral was found, and around it clustered a
Coptic village, called Medeenet-Haboo. Hence the name
generally given to the ruins.

The Temple of Thothmes III. is the smaller of
the two. The court (80 ft. by 125 ft.), by the ﬂowered
capitals of its columns and the style of its sculptures and
hieroglyphics, belongs to the Roman epoch. It also bears
the names of Titus, Adrian, Antoninus, etc.

Beyond this court, which is a Ptolemaic addition, is
another smaller court, with cartouches of Tirhakeh (twenty-
ﬁfth dynasty), and Nectanebo (thirtieth dynasty). The
Temple itself is more ancient still, being erected and
adorned by Thothmes II. and Thothmes III.

The Temple of Rameses III. was erected by him
in the immediate vicinity of the smaller ediﬁce just described.
This grand building is of great historical importance, and
by its style and general effect and variety of decoration,
makes a profound and laSIing impression on all visitors.

The ediﬁce consists of a Palace and a Temple,
separated by a court, forming together a structure second
only to Karnak in grandeur of architecture and gorgeousness
of decoration—a labyrinth of immense courts, innumerable
pillars, and superb colonnades. Many parts are still perfect,
but all around, columns bright and vivid with every colour of
the rainbow lie scattered in countless profusion.

The Palace, though probably intended as a grand
‘monument of military architecture rather than as an actual
habitation, has all the characteristics of. a royal residence.
