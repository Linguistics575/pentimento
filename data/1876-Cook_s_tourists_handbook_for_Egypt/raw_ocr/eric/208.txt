ASSOUAN. 139

nilometer that once stood here has almost totally gone.
There are a quay of Roman origin, built up with remains of
numberless more ancient ediﬁces, and a granite portal, with
cartouches of Alexander III. still in existence; and this is
about all there is to show for the hundreds and hundreds of
years during which in Elephantine “ men reigned and women
loved, and kings and priests and princes lived and died, till
the change came, and time trod on them and crushed the
palaces, and the avenging angel swept his wing over them,
and their very dust went away on the wind. Elephantine
lay in the Nile, and other nations took the place of Egypt in
the roll of time. There is, perhaps, no place in Egypt that,
could it have a voice, would utter more strange and splendid
histories of men and kings than this island.”

“ Elephantine lies in the river,” says W. C. Prime,
“from the foot of the cataract stretching down in front of
Assouan about a mile, and is nearly half-a-mile in breadth.
Its surface is a mass of ruins, shapeless and hideous. Ruin
sits triumphant here. Not even the ploughshare of ancient
history, which has run over so many ruins, could prevail
here to penetrate the mass. A small part of the island is
cultivated, but a large portion still remains in the condition
I have described, and so will remain so long as the world
stands. Fragments of statues, a gateway of the time of the
mighty son of Philip, an altar whose ﬁre was long ago
extinguished in the blood of its worshippers: these and
similar relics remain; but nothing to indicate the shape,
extent, or date of any of the buildings that formerly covered
the island.”

The First Cataract of the Nile is about three miles
above Assouan. Ancient travellers and geographers Speak of
the noise as being so prodigious as to deafen those within
earshot. If this was ever the case it is vastly different now.
