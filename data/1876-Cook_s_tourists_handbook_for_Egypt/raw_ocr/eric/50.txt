NATURAL PRODUCTIONS. 3 3

corded amongst the Mosaic plagues are still most unplea-
santly numerous in the Egyptian land.

Amongst the trees and plants of Egypt many European
varieties ﬂourish. Date palms, doom palms, sycamores,
tamarisks, acacias, etc., are the most noticeable. The lotus,
or water-lily of the Nile, conspicuous in the ornamentation
of the old temples and tombs, and used for making a sort of
bread now, as in the days of Herodotus, is a noticeable object
in the Delta, when the Nile is at full height. The papyrus,
from whose delicate white pith the ancients made paper, has
become scarce, and according to some extinct. There are
very doubtful rumours of its existence in some out-of-the-
way spots.*

* “The lotus and papyrus,” says Dr. Samuel Manning, in his
Land of tile Pﬁarao/zs, “ were formerly the most common of its
products, insomuch that they formed the symbols of Upper and Lower
Egypt. The papyrus was used not only for making paper, to which it
gave its name, but for the construction of boats, baskets, and innu-
merable other articles; as in the Upper Jordan Valley, where it still
g rows abundantly, even cottages were built with it. No religious
service, no state ceremonial, no domestic festival is found without the
lotus-ﬂower. It forms part of every offering to the gods. The guests
at a banquet all held one in their hands. It is, perhaps, the object of
all others most constantly represented on the monuments. Yet both
the lotus and papyrus have disappeared from Egypt. No trace of either '
can be found. Unaccountable as is the disappearance of these plants,
it was yet foretold by the Prophet Isaiah, as a part of the Divine judg:
ment upon Egypt : ‘ The brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried
up : the reeds and ﬂags shall wither. The paper reeds by‘ the broéks

. . and everything sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven‘away,
and be no more’ (Isa. xix. 6, 7). The phrase, ‘brooks: of «__defence,’-
in this passage, has greatly perplexed commentators. Brooks, iri the
proper sense of the term, there are none in Egypt. Of course the
reference is to the canals with which the country is intersected. * But
why ‘ brooks of defence '? It has been commonly supposed that they
were constructed simply for irrigation. But it affords a striking illus-
