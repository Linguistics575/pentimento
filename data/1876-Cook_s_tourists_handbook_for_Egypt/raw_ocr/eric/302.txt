KANTARAH T0 GAZA. ' 28 1

David was approaching Carmel from the wilderness of
Paran, the region near the Dead Sea, where he had protected
Nabal’s ﬂocks from the raids of the Bedouins, when Abigail
met him and appeased his anger. Such was, doubtless, the
chief work of David and his hand during the long period of
his persecution by Saul; he defended the frontier shepherds
and husbandmen of Israel from the marauding, devastating
Bedouins, who then, as now, by swift incursions swept off
the harvests and herds.” _

and the beautiful adjacent valley come into view. For miles
above and below the city stretches the Valley Of Eshcol,
with its ﬁg and olive orchards, vineyards and corn-ﬁelds—
the bright hues of luxurious vegetation enhanced by con-
trast with the bare rocky hills surrounding the Valley.

CAIRO TO SYRIA, BY THE SHORT DESERT
ROUTE.

(Kantarah to Gaza, 148 miles.)

This was at one time a favourite route between Egypt
and Syria, as being shorter and easier than the route by
Sinai; but few travellers now make use of it. If any now

or Port Said and Jaffa, there is still no need to commence
the desert journey at Cairo ; Kantarah (p. 227) can be readily
reached by railway and canal, and then the camels used
from that place forward.
