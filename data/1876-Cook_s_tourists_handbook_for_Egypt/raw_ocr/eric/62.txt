MOSQUES. 45

Mosque building about a century after the Hegira, and gra-
dually the Saracenic style of architecture predominated
throughout the Mahomedan world. The chief Egyptian
Mosques are Saracenic.

Islamism is an enemy to plastic art; in the Mosques are
found no pictures, no statues, no representations of living

any animal form into his ornament; but although all the
radiance of colour, all the reﬁnements of proportion, and all

most power when practised in arrangements of simple geo-
metrical form ; the Arab, therefore, lay under no disadvantage
in colouring, and he had all the noble elements of construc-
tive and proportional beauty at his command; he might not
imitate the sea-shell, but he could build the dome. The
