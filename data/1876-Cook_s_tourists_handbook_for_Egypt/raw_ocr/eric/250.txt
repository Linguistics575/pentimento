PORT SAID. 229

from Jaffa. It is a town of very recent growth, containing
some 10,000 inhabitants. It is regularly laid out on foun-
dations consisting chieﬂy of materials excavated from the canal.
It stands where the canal pierces the low sandbank separating
Lake Menzaleh from the Mediterranean Sea. The Port com-
prises a quay, a basin of I37 acres, and a dry dock nearly 4.50
ft. in length. The roadstead lies outside these, between two
breakwaters stretching out, one 7000 and the other 6000 ft.
These moles are twice as far apart at the shore ends as at the
ends nearest the sea, where they are only 800 yards apart. The
moles, 17 ft. wide at top, are formed of an artiﬁcial concrete,
formed of the Canal dredgings, lime from Theil, near
Marseilles, and salt water. An electric light ﬂashes out
from the lighthouse, which is 180 ft. in height, and formed
of solid concrete.

Port Said is supplied with water in pipes from the
Sweet-Water Canal at Ismailia. A three-days’ supply is
kept in reservoirs. This place was chosen as the head of
the Canal because of the nearness of deep water to the shore.
There is nothing particular to see in the town; but some
visitors will be interested in noticing the Dockyard, Work-
shop, Transit Basin, Commercial Basin, Dockyard Basin,
Engine- House Basin, etc.

In the Globe newspaper of Aug. 11, 1876, a striking
result of the Suez Canal is thus described :—

“Year after year a vast climactic change is gradually
more and more observable in Eastern Egypt, or rather, to be
more precise, in that belt of land, 90 miles or so long by
some 30 broad, which, extending between Suez and Port
Said, is directly inﬂuenced by the water of the Suez Canal.
Before the Canal was opened up there was scarcely a blade
of grass in the region, except on the borders of the Bitter
Lakes and round about the Oasis of Ismailia. But now the
