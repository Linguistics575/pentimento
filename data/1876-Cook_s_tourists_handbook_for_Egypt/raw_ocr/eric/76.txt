BIBLE ASSOCIATIONS. 59

“where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy
foot as a garden of herbs.”

Of the commerce of ancient Egypt we get a glimpse
when, in Gen. xxxvii. 25, Joseph’s brethren encounter the
Ishmaelites with their “ camels bearing Spicery and balm -
and myrrh.” In I Kings x. 28, 29, Solomon is found buy-
ing horses and chariots and linen yarn, and in Ezekiel xxvii.
7, the “ﬁne linen with broidered work from Egypt,” is
Spoken of as one of the luxuries of Tyre.

The learning of the Magi was celebrated through all the
adjacent countries. In Gen. xli. 8, Exodus vii. II, I Kings
iv. 30, and Acts vii. 22, this Egyptian wisdom is referred to.
Some interesting referencesto the Egyptian priests, the king's
property in the land, the practice of embalmment, the Egyp-
tian abhorrencef of shepherds, etc., will be noticed in per-
using the narrative of the Israelitish sojourn in Egypt.

Many .interesting references to Egypt of a more general
character will be found in the Psalms and in other parts of
the Scriptures. The story of Israel in Egypt, so full of
typical events, and of moral lessons for all ages of the world,
is referred to again and again in the sacred writings, and
will be perused with interest by the traveller in that ancient
land. Everywhere, too, he will see how the predictions,
made in far off ages of the world, have literally come true 5
and the land which was once noted above all others for its
wisdom and prosPerity, has sunk to be the “basest of
kingdoms.” And he will see, too, how the judgments
pronounced have been carried out to the letter; and this will
aid him, perchance, to believe that prophecies unfulﬁlled are
even now in process of accomplishment. One remarkable
passage, which minutely describes the destruction to befall
certain Speciﬁed towns and districts, will be read with
interest as the sites of former grandeur are visited.
