In addition to the mention of On (or Heliopolis) in
Gen. xli. 45, as being the place where Poti-pherah (whose
daughter Asenath was married to Joseph) was priest—some
other notices occur in the Scriptures. In Jer. xliii. I 3, this
city is called Beth-shemesh, a term of similar meaning to
Heliopolis, City of the Sun. The passage referred to is,
“ He shall break all the images of Beth-shemesh that is in
the land of Egypt, and the house of the gods of the Egyp-
tians shall He burn with ﬁre." In Ezek. xxx. 17, the place
is called Aven, and the destruction of its young men by the
sword foretold. Josephus says that On was the city given
for a residence to the family of Jacob on their ﬁrst arrival in
Egypt-

North-east of Heliopolis are the ruins of Aboo-Kesheyd,
where are three ﬁgures out on the granite rock— one a

Greek name has perpetuated. Already existing under the
ancient Empire, and ﬂourishing long after as a great sacer-
dotal city, to whose colleges Greek philosoPhers came to
learn wisdom from Egyptian priests, the story of its deca-
dence is unknown. Strabo came here, and found only ruins
and desert. To-day all that remains of Heliopolis is the en-
closure of the Temple and the wonderful Obelisk. Within
the enclosure referred to are ruins of houses, but these are
not the remains of the ancient city. They show how in the
Christian era a Coptic settlement used the walls of the
ancient Temple as an enclosure for a new town. Heliopolis
itself has disappeared to its very foundations, but doubtless if
