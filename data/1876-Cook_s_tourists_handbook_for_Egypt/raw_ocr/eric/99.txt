without being gaunt and grand. The situation is in the
midst of the most fashionable part of the town, and from the

“ Hotel charges in Cairo are arranged in this wise: so

and dinner; and the traveller who takes only one meal or
two, or all the meals but not the bed-room accommodation,
has to pay the full tariff notwithstanding.”——-( E. H.)
