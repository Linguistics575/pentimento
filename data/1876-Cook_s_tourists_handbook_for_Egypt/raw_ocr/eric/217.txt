1 98 THE NILE.

ASSOUAN TO WADY—HALFA.

Leaving Assouan (as described at p. 190) the steamer
passes on its way towards the south. Philae is soon left
behind, and the onward course is between low granite-
mountains that hem in the river on both sides, leaving only a
narrow cultivated strip ; tombs are frequent, eSpecially on the
western bank. The sakias are everywhere, each paying a
tax of zoo piastres to the Government.

At Dabé'd (W.) is a temple of Isis, built by Atar-Amun,
king of Ethiopia, about the time of Ptolemy Philadelphus.

Before arriving at Gertéssee the scenery of the river is
very ﬁne—granite rocks and verdant banks, and occasional
villages and palm groves are picturesquely mingled.

At Gertcissee (W.) are a few columns of a ruined temple,
beautifully situated on the rocks, .unlike most Egyptian
temples, which are generally on the level plain. There is a
quarry near at hand, with many inscriptions and busts, etc.,
chieﬂy of the times of the Roman Emperors.

Téfah (W.) Here are. the remains of two temples. The
gazelle is said to be occasionally met I with in the desert
ravines of the neighbourhood.

A little to the south of Téfah the “ Gates of Kalébsheh,”
or E1 Bab are passed; this is a narrow part of the river where
the adjacent mountains bend inward on both sides of the
river and conﬁne its channel between huge cliffs; a number
of slight rapids are formed here by the rocks.

At Kalabsheh (W .), whose inhabitantshave long been
noted for their ﬁerce courage, are the ruins of the largest of
the Nubian temples 3 the steps which formerly led up to it
from the river are gone, though the parapets remain 5
hence a paved area, another ﬂight of steps, and a stone
causeway lead to the grand terrace on which the ruins stand ;
