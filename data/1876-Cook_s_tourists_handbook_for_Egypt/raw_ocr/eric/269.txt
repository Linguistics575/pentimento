glow with rosy tints as beautiful to see as they are difﬁcult
to describe. Barren and uninviting as the region is, it has

grouse, and the quail, are met with. Near the Red Sea teal
and duck and other water-fowl are occasionally found. The
climate is intensely dry, and very healthy. The old hermits
asserted that the desert air was so life-giving, that man
scarcely needed either sustenance or repose.
