a kind of tired sleep, which has left it an easy
prey alike to the conquerors of yesterday and
to the exploiters of to-day.

Another trait which, side by side with their
patience, prevails amongst these true-blooded
Egyptians of the countryside is their attachment

in which later on they will sleep. To possess
land, to forestall at any price the smallest por-

moreover, which they till with the oldest plough
invented by man, the exact design of which may
be seen carved on the walls of the tombs at
Memphis.

And this same people, which was the first of
any to conceive magnificence, whose gods and
kings were formerly surrounded with an over-
powering splendour, contrives to live to-day,
pell-mell with its sheep and goats, in humble,
low-roofed cabins made out of sunbaked mud!
