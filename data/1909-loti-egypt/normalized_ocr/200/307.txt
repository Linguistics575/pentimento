In the Temple of the Ogress 269

devour men; and none of them would willingly
venture near her dwelling at this late hour. But
instead of returning to Luxor, like the good
people whose carriages have just departed, I
rather choose to pay her a visit.

Her dwelling is some distance away, and I
shall not reach it till the dead of night.

First of all I have to retrace my steps, to
return along the whole avenue of rams, to pass
again by the feet of the white giant, who has
already assumed his phantomlike appearance,
while the violet waves that bathed the town-
mummy thicken and turn to a greyish-blue.
And then, leaving behind me the pylons guarded
by the broken giants, I thread my way among
the palaces of the centre.

It is among these palaces that I encounter for
good and all the night, with the first cries of the
owls and ospreys. It is still warm there, on
account of the heat stored by the stones during
the day, but one feels nevertheless that the air is
freezing.

At a crossing a tall human figure looms up,
draped in black and armed with a baton. It is
a roving Bedouin, one of the guards, and this
more or less is the dialogue exchanged between
us (freely and succinctly translated)'.

"Your permit, sir."

"Here it is."
