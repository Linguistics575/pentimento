64. Egypt

their summits are elaborately ornamented and
crowned with battlements, which show in profile
against the sky a long series of dentieulated
stonework. And over this sort of reddish fret-
work of the top, which seems as if it were there
as a frame to the deep blue vault above us, we
see rising up distractedly all the minarets of the
neighbourhood; and these minarets are red-
coloured too, redder even than the jealous walls,
and are decorated with arabesques, pierced
by the daylight and complicated with aerial
galleries. Some of them are a little distance
away; others, startlingly close, seem to scale the
zenith; and all are ravishing and strange, with
their shining crescents and outstretched shafts
of wood that call to the great birds of space.
Spite of ourselves we raise our heads, fascinated
by all the beauty that is in the air; but there
is only this square of marvellous sky, a sort
of limpid sapphire, set in the battlements
of El-Azhar and fringed by those audacious
slender towers. We are in the religious East
of olden days and we feel how the mystery
of this magnificent eourt--whose architectural
ornament consists merely in geometrical de-
signs repeated to infinity, and does not com-
mence till quite high up on the battlements,
where the minarets point into the eternal blue
-must cast its spell upon the imagination
