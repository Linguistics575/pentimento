CHAPTER XIX
A TOWN PROMPTLY EMBELLISHED

EIGHT years and a line of railway have suffieed
to accomplish its metamorphosis. Once in
Upper Egypt, on the borders of Nubia, there
was a little humble town, rarely visited, and
wanting, it must be owned, in elegance and even
in comfort.

Not that it was without picturesqueness and
historical interest. Quite the contrary. The
Nile, charged with the waters of equatorial
Africa, flung itself close by from the height of a
mass of black granite, in a majestic cataract;
and then, before the little Arab houses, became
suddenly calm again, and flowed between islets
of fresh verdure where clusters of palm-trees
swayed their plumes in the wind.

And around were a number of temples, of
hypogea, of Roman ruins, of ruins of churches
dating from the first centuries of Christianity.
The ground was full of souvenirs of the great
primitive civilisations. For the place, abandoned
for ages and lulled in the folds of Islam under
the guardianship of its white mosque, was once
one of the centres of the life of the world.
