ings, that sound like the mewings of kittens.

Surely not. If, in our Western lands, certain
ceremonies seem to me anti-Christian-as, for

in the over-pompous Cathedral of Cologne, where
halberdiers overawe the c1'owd--here, on the
contrary, the simplicity of this primitive cult is
touching and respectable in the extreme. These
Copts who install themselves in their church, as
round their firesides, who make their home there
and encumber the place with their fretful little
ones, have, in their own way, well understood
the words of Him who said'. "Suffer the little
children to come unto Me, and do not forbid
them, for of such is the kingdom of God."
