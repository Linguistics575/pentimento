A Centre of Islam 69

ness marks them all; the same detachment,
a preoccupation with the self-same dream. And
in the sky, to which they raise their eyes, the
heavens-framed always by the battlements of
El-Azhar-are almost white from the excess of
light, with a border of tall, red minarets, which
seem to be aglow with the reflection of some
great fire. And, watching them pass, all these
young priests or jurists, at once so different and
so alike, we understand better than before how
Islam, the old, old Islam, keeps still its cohesion
and its power.

The mosque in which they pursue their studies
is now almost empty. In its restful twilight
there is silence, and the unexpected music of
little birds; it is the brooding season and the
ceilings of earked wood are full of nests, which
nobody disturbs.

A world, this mosque, in which thousands of
people could easily find room. Some hundred
and fifty marble columns, brought from ancient
temples, support the arches of the seven parallel
aisles. There is no light save that which comes
through the arcade opening into the courtyard,
and it is so dark in the aisles at the far end
that we wonder again how the faithful can see
to read when the sun of Egypt happens to be
veiled.
