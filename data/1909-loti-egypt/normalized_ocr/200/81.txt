The Hall of the Mummies 55

Thebes, at Luxor, reproduce and try to make
eternal....

In the next eoffin lies his father, Seti I., who
reigned for a much shorter period, and died much
younger than he. This youthfulness is apparent
still in the features of the mummy, which are
impressed besides with a persistent beauty.
Indeed this good King Seti looks the picture
of calm and serene reverie. There is nothing
shocking in his dead face, with its long closed
eyes, its delicate lips, its noble chin and un-
blemished profile. It is soothing and pleasant
even to see him sleeping there with his hands
crossed upon his breast. And it seems strange,
that he, who looks so young, should have for
son the old man, almost a centenarian, who lies
beside him.

In our passage we have gazed on many
other royal mummies, some tranquil and some
grimacing. But, to finish, there is one of them
(the third coffin there, in the row in front of
us), a certain Queen Nsitanebashru, whom I
approach with fear, albeit it is mainly on her
account that I have ventured to make this
fantastical round. Even in the daytime she
attains to the maximum of horror that a
spectral figure can evoke. What will she be
like to-night in the uncertain light of our little
lantern?
