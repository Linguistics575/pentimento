218 Egypt

The moon! Suddenly the stones of the
summit, the copings, the formidable friezes, are
lighted by rays of clear light, and here and there,
on the bas-reliefs encircling the pillars, appear
luminous trails which reveal the gods and
goddesses engraved in the stone. They were
watching in myriads around me, as I knew well,

They stare at one another with their arms raised,
spreading out their long fingers in an eager

mysterious secret to convey to one another, but
have perforce to remain silent, and for all the
expressiveness of their attitudes their hands do
not move. And hieroglyphs, too, repeated to
infinity, envelop you on all sides like a multiple
woof of mystery.

these rigid dead things grows more precise. Cold,
hard rays penetrate through the immense ruin,
separating with a sharp incisiveness the light
from the shadows. The feeling that these
stones, wearied as they were with their long
