the frescoed portraits which used to adorn them,
nor of their multicoloured coatings, now that
they have taken on the same dead colour as the
desert, they look like the huge bones of giant
fossils, that have long outlasted their other con-
temporaries on earth. Beneath the ground, how,
ever, the case is different; there, still remain the
bodies of men, and even of eats and birds, who
with their own eyes saw these vast structures
building, and who sleep intact, swathed in band-
ages, in the darkness of their tunnels. W e know,
for we have penetrated there before, what things
are hidden in the womb of this old desert, on
which the yellow shroud of the sand grows
thicker and thicker as the centuries pass. The
whole deep rock has been perforated patiently
to make hypogea and sepulchral chambers, great
and small, and veritable palaces for the dead,
adorned with innumerable painted figures, And
though now, for some two thousand years, men
have set themselves furiously to exhume the
sareophagi and the treasures that are buried here,
the subterranean reserves are not yet exhausted.
There still remain, no doubt, pleiads of undis-
turbed sleepers, who will never be discovered.
As we advance the wind grows stronger and
colder beneath a sky that becomes increasingly
cloudy, and the sand is flying on all sides. The

sand is the undisputed sovereign of this necro-
