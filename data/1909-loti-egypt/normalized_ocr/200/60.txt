outer world. Palm-trees, which have grown
there for some hundred years perhaps, rise from
the ground, either separately 01- in superb
clusters, and temper the light of the always hot
sun on the rose-trees and the flowering hibiscus.
There is no noise in the gardens, any more than
in the Cloisters, for people walk there in sandals
and with measured tread. And there are Edens,
too, for the birds, who live and sing therein in
complete security, even during the services,
attracted by the little troughs which the imams
fill for their benefit each morning with water
from the Nile.

As for the mosque itself it is rarely closed on
all sides as are those in the countries of the more
sombre Islam of the north. Here in Egypt
-sinee there is no real winter and scarcely ever
any rain-one of the sides of the mosque is left
completely open to the garden; and the sanctu-
ary is separated from the verdure and the roses
only by a simple eolonnade. Thus the faithful
grouped beneath the palm-trees can pray there
equally as well as in the interior of the mosque,
since they can see, between the arches, the
holy Mihrab.1

1 The Mihrab is a kind of portico indicating the direction
of Mecca. It is placed at the end of each mosque, as the
altar is in our churches, and the faithful are supposed to face
it when they pray.
