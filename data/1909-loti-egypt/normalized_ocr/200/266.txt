And in the old dried-up soil, how many strange
treasures remain hidden l. When the sun lights
thus the forlorn distances, when you perceive
stretching away to the horizon these fields of
death, you realise better what kind of a place
this Thebes once was. Rebuilt as it were in the
imagination it appears excessive, superabundant
and multiple, like those flowers of theantediluvian
world which the fossils reveal to us, Compared
with it how our modern towns are dwarfed, and
our hasty little palaces, our stuccoes and old iron!
And it is so mystical, this town of Thebes,
with its dark sanctuaries, once inhabited by gods
and symbols. All the sublime, fresh-minded
striving of the human soul after the Unknowable
is as it were petrified in these ruins, in forms
diverse and immeasurably grand. And subsist-
ing thus down to our day it puts us to shame.
Compared with this people, who thought only
of eternity, we are a lot of pitiful dotards, who
soon will be past caring about the wherefore
of life, or thought, or death. Such beginnings
presaged, surely, something greater than our
humanity of the present day, given over to
despair, to alcohol and to explosives!

Crumbling and dust! This same sun of
Thebes is in its place each day, parching,
exhausting, cracking and pulverising.
