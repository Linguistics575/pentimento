200 Egypt

gave on to the Nile. It was there that the God
Amen, carried and followed by long trains of
priests, came every year to take his golden barge
for a solemn procession. But it leads to-day
only to the eornfields, for, in the course of
successive centuries, the river has receded little
by little and now winds its course a thousand
yards away in the direction of Libya.

We can see, beyond, the old sacred Nile
between the clusters of palm-ttees on its banks;
meandering there like a rosy pathway, which
remains, nevertheless, in this hour of universal
incandescence, astonishingly pale, and gleams
occasionally with a bluish light. And on the
farther bank, from one end to the other of
the western horizon, stretches the chain of the
Libyan mountains behind which the sun is about
to plunge; a chain of red sandstone, parched
since the beginning of the world-without a
rival in the preservation to perpetuity of dead
bodies-whieh the Thebans perforated to its
extreme depths to fill it with sarcophagi.

We watch the sun descend. But we turn also
to see, behind us, the ruins in this the traditional
moment of their apotheosis. Thebes, the im-
mense town-mummy, seems all at once to be
ablaze-as if its old stones were able still to burn;
all its blocks, fallen or upright, appear to have
been suddenly made ruddy by the glow of fire.
