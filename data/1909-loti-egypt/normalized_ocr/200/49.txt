The Passing of Cairo 27

And nevertheless amongst the young Moslcms
and Copts now leaving the schools there are
so many of distinguished mind and superior
intelligence! When I see the things that are
here, see them with the fresh eyes of a stranger,
landed but yesterday upon this soil, impregnated
with the glory of antiquity, I want to cry out
to them, with a frankness that is brutal perhaps,
but with a profound sympathy'.

"Bestir yourselves before it is too late. Defend
yourselves against this disintegrating invasion--
not by force, be it understood, not by inhospi-
tality or ill-humour-but by disdaining this
Occidental rubbish, this last year's frippery by
which you are inundated. Try to preserve not
only your traditions and your admirable Arab
language, but also the grace and mystery that
used to characterise your town, the refined
luxury of your dwelling-houses. It is not a
question now of a poet's fancy; your national
dignity is at stake. You are 0rieatals---1 pro-
nounce respectfully that word, which implies

_ a whole past of early civilisation, of unmingled
greatness-but in a few years, unless you are on
yourguard, you will have become mere Levantine
brokers, exclusively preoccupied with the price
of land and the rise in cotton."
