208 Egypt

night on which the moon rises late and then,
having entered before the close of the day, to
escape the notice of the Bedouin guards who
shut the gates at nightfall. Thus have I
manoeuvred to-day, and undisturbed, watching
from a hiding-place on high, I have waited with
the patience of a stone Osiris, till the grand
transformation scene of the setting of the sun
was played out once more upon the ruins.
Thebes, which, during the day, is almost animate
by reason of the presence of the visitors and the
gangs of fellahs who, singing the while, are busy
at the diggings and the clearing away of the
rubbish, has emptied itself little by little, while
the blue shadows were mounting from the base of
the monstrous sanctuaries. I watched the people
moving in a long row, like a trail of ants, towards
the western gate between the pylons of the
Ptolemies, and the last of them had disappeared
before the rosy light died away on the topmost
points of the obelisks.

It seemed as if the silence and the night ar-
rived together from beyond the Arabian desert,
advanced together across the plain, spreading
out like a rapid oil-stain; then gained the town
from east to west, and rose rapidly from the
ground to the very summits of the temples.
And this march of the darkness was infinitely
solemn.
