CHAPTER XVIII
AT THEBES IN THE TEMPLE OF THE OGRESS

THIS evening, in the vast chaos of n1ins---at the
hour in which the light of the sun begins to turn
to rose--1 make my way along one of the magnifi-
cent roads of the town-mummy, that, in fact,
which goes off at a right angle to the line of the
temples of Amen, and, losing itself more or less
in the sands, leads at length to a sacred lake on
the border of which certain cat-headed goddesses
are seated in state watching the dead water and
the expanse of the desert. This particular road
was begun three thousand four hundred years
ago by a beautiful queen called Makeri,1 and in
the following centuries a number of kings con-
tinued its construction. It was ornamented
with pylons of a superb massiveness--pylons are
monumental walls, in the form of a trapezium
with a wide base, covered entirely with hiero-
glyphs, which the Egyptians used to place at
either side of their portieoes and long avenues---
as well as by colossal statues and interminable
rows of rams, larger than buffaloes, crouched on
pedestals.
