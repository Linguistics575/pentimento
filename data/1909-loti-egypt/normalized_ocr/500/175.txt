A Charming Luncheon 14.5

horses, faster than their donkeys, overtake them
in the return journey amongst the green corn-
fields of Abydos; and in a stoppage in the
narrow roadway, caused by a meeting with a
number of camels laden with lucerne, we are
brought to a halt in their midst. Almost
touching me is a dear little white donkey, who
looks at me pensively and in such a way that
we at once understand one another. A mutual
sympathy unites us. A Cookess in spectacles
surmounts him-the most hideous of them all,
bony and severe. Over her travelling costume,
already sufficiently repulsive, she wears a tennis
jersey, which accentuates the angularity of her
figure, and in her person she seems the very
incarnation of the respectability of the British
Isles. It would be more equitable, too-so long
are those legs of hers, which, to be sure, have
scant interest for the tourist--if she carried the
. donkey.

The poor little white thing regards me with
melancholy. His ears twitch 1testlessly and his
beautiful eyes, so fine, so observant of everything,
say to me as plain as words'.

"She is a beauty, isn't she? "

"She is, indeed, my poor little donkey. But
think of this'. fixed on thy back as she is, thou
hast this advantage over me--thou seest her
not 1 "
