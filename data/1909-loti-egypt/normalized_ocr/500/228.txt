might have seemed eternal, could come to suffer
such an utter ruin. Fragments of columns,
fragments of obelisks, broken by downfalls of
which the mere imagination is awful, heads and
head-dresses of giant divinities, all lie higgledy-
piggledy in a disorder beyond possible redress.
Nowhere surely on our earth does the sun in his
daily revolution cast his light on such debris as
this, on such a litter of vanished palaces and
dead colossi'.

It was even here, seven or eight thousand
years ago, under this pure crystal sky, that the
first awakening of human thought began. Our
Europe then was still sleeping, wrapped in the
mantle of its damp forests; sleeping that sleep
which still had thousands of years to run. Here,
. a precocious humanity, only recently emerged
from the Age of Stone, that earliest form of all,
an infant humanity, which saw massively on its
issue from the massiveness of the original matter,
conceived and built terrible sanctuaries for gods,
at first dreadful and vague, such as its nascent
reason allowed it to conceive them. Then the
first megalithic blocks were erected; then began
that mad heaping up and up, which was to last
nearly fifty centuries; and temples were built
above temples, palaces over palaces, each genera-
tion striving to outdo its predecessor by a more
titanic grandeur.
