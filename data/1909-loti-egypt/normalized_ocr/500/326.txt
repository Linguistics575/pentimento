284 Egypt

Assouan possesses also its little Oriental
bazaar-m little improvised, a little new perhaps;
but then one, at least, was needed, and that as
quickly as possible, in order that nothing might
be wanting to the tourists.

The shopkeepers have contrived to provision
themselves (in the leading shops, under the
arcades of the Rue de Rivoli) with as much
tact as good taste, and the Cook ladies have
the innocent illusion of making bargains every
day. One may even buy there, hung up by
the tail, stuffed with straw and looking ex-
tremely real, the last crocodiles of Egypt, which,
particularly at the end of the season, may be
had at very advantageous prices.

Even the old Nile has allowed itself to be
fretted and brought up to date in the progress of
evolution.

First, the women, draped in black veils,
who come daily to draw the precious water,
have forsaken the fragile amphorae of baked
earth, which had come to them from barbarous
times--and which the Orientalists grossly abused
in their pictures; and in their stead have taken
to old tin oil-cans, placed at their disposal by
the kindness of the big hotels. But they carry
them in the same easy graceful manner as erst-
while the discarded pottery, and without losing
in the least the gracious tanagrine outline.
