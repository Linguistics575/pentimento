comes on entering the church, is allotted to the
women, the second is for the baptistery, and
the third, at the end adjoining the iconostasis,
is reserved for the men.

in their apportioned space-so much at home
there with their suckling little ones-wear,
almost all of them, the long black silk veils of
former days. In their harmonious and endlessly
restless groups, the gowns /, la franque and the
poor hats of carnival are still the exception.
The congregation, as a whole, preserves almost
intact its naive, old-time flavour.

And there is movement too, beyond, in the
compartment of the men, which is bounded at
the farther end by the ieonostasis--a thousand-

and ivory of precious antique workmanship, and
adorned with strange old icons, blackened by

doorways-that mass is now being said. From
