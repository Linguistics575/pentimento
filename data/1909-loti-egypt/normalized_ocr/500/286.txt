248 Egypt

the electricity permits us to see quite clearly, and
opposite, at the end of the hall, a large crypt is
revealed, which one divines instinctively must
be the resting-place of the Pharaoh. What a
prodigious labour must have been entailed by
this perforation of the living rock! And this
hypogeum is not unique. All along the "Valley
of the Kings "little insignificant doors-which
to the initiated reveal the "Sign of the Shadow,"
inscribed on their lintels--lead to other subter-
ranean places, just as sumptuous and perfidiously
profound, with their snares, their hidden wells,
their oubliettes and the bewildering multiplicity
of their mural figures. And all these tombs this
morning were full of people, and, if we had not
had the good fortune to arrive after the usual
hour, we should have met here, even in this
dwelling of Amenophis, a battalion equipped by
Messrs Cook.

In this hall, with its blue ceiling, the frescoes
multiply their riddles: scenes from the Book of
Hades, all the funeral ritual translated into
pictures. On the pillars and walls crowd the
different demons that an Egyptian soul was
likely to meet in its passage through the country
of shadows, and underneath the passwords which
were to be given to each of them are recapitu-
lated so as not to be forgotten.

For the soul used to depart simultaneously
