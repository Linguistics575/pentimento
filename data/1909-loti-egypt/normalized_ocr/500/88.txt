62 Egypt

Moslem university in the world. And since
then successive sovereigns of Egypt have vied
with one another in perfecting and enlarging it;
adding new halls, new galleries, new minarets,
till they have made of El-Azhar almost a town
within a town.

"He who seeks instruction is more loved of God than he

who fights in a holy war."
A verse from the Hadith.

Eleven o'elock on a day of burning sunshine
and dazzling light. El-Azhar still vibrates with
the murmur of many voices, although the lessons
of the morning are nearly finished.

Once past the threshold of the double
ornamented door we enter the courtyard, at this
moment empty as the desert and dazzling with
sunshine. Beyond, quite open, the mosque
spreads out its endless arcades, which are con-
tinued and repeated till they are lost in the
gloom of the far interior, and in this dim place,
with its perplexing depths, innumerable people
in turbans, sitting in a close crowd, are singing,
or rather chanting, in a low voice, and marking
time as it were to their declamation by a slight
rhythmic swaying from the hips. They are the
ten thousand students come from all parts of
the world to absorb the changeless doctrine of
El-Azhar.
