so Egypt
to me: "This is the place. Look! There they
are."

In truth I recognise the place, having often
come here in the daytime, like other people. In
spite of the darkness, which commences at some
ten paces from us-so small is the circle of light
cast by our lantern-l can distinguish the double
row of the great royal coffins, open without
shame in their glass cases. And standing against
the walls, upright, like so many sentinels, are
the eoffin lids, fashioned in the shape of the
human figure.

We are there at last, admitted at this un-
seasonable hour into the guest-chamber of kings
and queens, for an audience that is private
indeed.

And there, first of all, is the woman with the
baby, upon whom, without stopping, we throw
the light of our lantern. A woman who died in
giving to the world a little dead prince. Since
the old embalmers no one has seen the face of
this Queen Makeri. In her coffin there she
is simply a tall female figure, outlined beneath
the close-bound swathings of brown-eoloured
bandages. At her feet lies the fatal baby,
grotesquely shrivelled, and veiled and mysterious
as the mother herself; a sort of doll, it seems,
put there to keep her eternal company in the
slow passing of endless years.
