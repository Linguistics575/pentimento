three or four thousand years ago, the ancient
history of the world had been written by the
Pharaohs in immortal hieroglyphics---well-nigh
everywhere, on the polished sides of the strange
blocks of blue and red granite that lie scattered
about the sands and look now like the forms of
antediluvian monsters.

Yes, but it was necessary that all this should

all sides-even on the islets of the old river--.
charm the eye of the traveller, greeting him
with their welcoming signs, which can be seen a
league away. True, they have been somewhat
hastily constructed, of mud and plaster, but
they recall none the less those gracious palaces
with which the Compagnie des Wagon-Lits has

dwarfed by the height of their fagades, is the poor
little town of olden times, with its little houses,
whitened with chalk, and its baby minaret.
