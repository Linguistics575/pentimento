Evening at Thebes 195

Afterwards, four thousand years ago, Thebes
was in the height of her glory, encumbered with

light of the world in the most ancient historic
periods; while our Occident was still asleep
and Greece and Assyria were scarcely awakened.
Only in the extreme East, a humanity of a

inspire those of Greece, were afterwards in some
