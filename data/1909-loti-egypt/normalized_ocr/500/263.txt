Thebes in Sunlight 229

there are still others, older still and more massive,
of which there was no suspicion, and whose age
must exceed eight thousand years.

In spite of the burning sun, and of the clouds
of dust raised by the blows of the pickaxes, one
might linger for hours amongst the dust-stained,
meagre fellahs, watching the excavations in this
unique soil-where everything that is revealed
is by way of being a surprise and a lucky find,
where the least carved stone had a past of glory,
formed part of the first architectural splendours,
was a stone of Thebes. Scarcely a moment
passes but, at the bottom of the trenches, as
the digging proceeds, some new thing gleams.
Perhaps it is the polished flank of a colossus,
fashioned out of granite from Syene, OI' a little
copper Osiris, the debris of a vase, a golden
trinket beyond price, 01' even a simple blue
pearl that has fallen from the necklace of some
waiting-maid of a queen.

This activity of the excavators, which alone
reanimates certain quarters during the day, ends
at sunset. Every evening the lean fellahs receive
the daily wage of their labour, and take them-.
selves off to sleep in the silent neighbourhood in
their huts of mud; and the iron gates are shut
behind them. At night, except for the guards
at the entrance, no one inhabits the ruins.
