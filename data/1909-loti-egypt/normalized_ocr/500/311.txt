In the Temple of the Ogress 273

In the dark retreat, enclosed with defaced
stones, in the little temple where she stands,
alone, upright and grand, with her enormous
head and thrust-out chin and tall goddess' head-
dress-one is necessarily quite close to her. In
touching her, at night, you are astonished to find
that she is less cold than the air; she becomes
somebody, and the intolerable dead stare seems
to weigh you down.

During the the-d-the, one thinks involuntarily
of the surroundings, of these ruins in the desert,
of the prevailing nothingness, of the cold beneath
the stars. And, now, that summation of doubt
and despair and terror, which such an assemblage
of things inspires in you, is confirmed, if one may
say so, by the meeting with this divinity-symbol,
which awaits you at the end of the journey, to
receive ironically all human prayer; a rigid
horror of granite, with an implacable smile and
a devouring jaw.
