and whistlings, and in the air, which was just
now so pure, rise noxious columns of black
smoke. The modern steamers are coming, and
throw into disorder the flotillas of the past:
colliers that leave great eddies in their wake, or
perhaps a wearisome lot of those three-decked
tourist boats, which make a great noise as they
plough the water, and are laden for the most
part with ugly women, snobs and imbeciles.

Poor, poor Nile l. which 1veflected formerly on
its warm mirror the utmost of earthly splendour,
which bore in its time so many barques of gods
and goddesses in procession behind the golden
barge of Amen, and knew in the dawn of the
ages only an impeccable purity, alike of the
human form and of architectural design , What
a downfall is here! To be awakened from
that disdainful sleep of twenty centuries and
made to carry the floating barracks of Thomas
Cook & Son, to feed sugar factories, and to
exhaust itself in nourishing with its mud the
raw material for English eotton-stuffs.
