A Centre of Islam 73

vain striving, and to die entranced by radiant
hopes, the Orientals are the only wise men. But
now that greedy nations beset them on all sides
their dreaming is no longer possible. They must
awake, alas.

They must awake; and already the awakening
is at hand. Here, in Egypt, where the need is
felt to change so many things, it is proposed, too,
to reform the old university of Al-Azhar, one of
the chief centres of Islam. One thinks of it with
a kind of fear, knowing what danger there is in
laying hands upon institutions which have lasted
for a thousand years. Reform, however, has, in
principle, been decided upon. New knowledge,
brought from the West, is penetrating into the
tabernacle of the Fatimites. Has not the Prophet
said .. " Co ; seek knowledge far and wide, if
needs be even into China " ? What will come
of it? Who can tell? But this, at least, is
certain: that in the dazzling hours of noon, or
in the golden hours of evening, when the crowd
of these modernised students spreads itself over
the vast courtyard, overlooked by its countless
minarets, there will no longer be seen in their
eyes the mystic light of to-day; and it will no
longer be the old unshakable faith, nor the lofty
and serene indifference, 1101' the profound peace,
that these messengers will carry to the ends of
the Mussulman earth. . . .
