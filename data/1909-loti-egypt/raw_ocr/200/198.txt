I 64 Egypt

those of some " Promised Land," seem to be
bounded far away, on left and right, by two
parallel stone walls, two chains of rose-coloured
mountains, whose aspect is obviously desertlike.
Besides, amongst the numerous animals that are
familiar, there are camels, feeding their strange
nurslings that look like four-legged ostriches.
And finally some peasants appear beyond in
the eornfields ; they are veiled in long black
draperies. It is the East then, an African land,
OI' some oasis of Arabia ?

The sun at this moment is hidden from us
by a band of clouds, that stretches, right above
our head, from one end of the sky to the other,
like a long skein of white wool. It is alone in
the blue void, and seems to make more peaceful,
and even a little mysterious, the wonderful light
of the fields we traverse-these fields intoxicated
with life and vibrant with the music of birds;
while, by contrast, the distant landscape, un-
shaded by clouds, is resplendent with a more
incisive clearness and the desert beyond seems
deluged with rays.

The pathway that we have been following,
ill defined as it is in the grassy fields, leads us at
length under a large ruinous portieo---a relic of
goodness knows what olden days--whieh still
rises here, quite isolated, altogether strange and
unexpected, in the midst of the green expanse
