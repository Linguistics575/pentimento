4.8 Egypt

ing, seems to be without end. After passing,
in turn, the papyri, the enamels, the vases that
contain human entrails, we reach the mummies
of the sacred beasts '. eats, ibises, dogs, hawks,
all with their mummy cloths and sarcophagi;
and monkeys, too, that remain grotesque even
in death. Then commence the human masks,
and, upright in glass-fronted cupboards, the
mummy cases in which the body, swathed in
its mummy cloths, was moulded, and which
reproduced, more or less enlarged, the figure of
the deceased. Quite a lot of courtesans of the
Greco-Roman epoch, moulded in paste in this
wise after death and crowned with roses, smile
at us provokingly from behind their windows.
Masks of the colour of dead flesh alternate with
others of gold which gleam as the light of our
lantern plays upon them momentarily in our
rapid passage. Their eyes are always too large,
the eyelids too wide open and the dilated pupils
seem to stare at us with alarm. Amongst these
mummy cases and these coffin lids fashioned in
the shape of the human figure, there are some
that seem to have been made for giants; the
head especially, beneath its cumbrous head-dress
the head stuffed as it were between the hunch..
back shoulders, looks enormous, out of all
proportion to the body which, towards the feet,
narrows like a scabbard.
