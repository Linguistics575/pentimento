Thebes in Sunlight 233

On the ground where once stood so much
magnificence there are fields of corn, spread out
like green carpets, which tell of the return of the
humble life of tillage. Above all, there is the
sand, encroaching now upon the very threshold
of the Pharaohs ; there is the yellow desert; there
is the world of refleetions and of silence, which
approaches like a slow submerging tide. In
the distance, where the mirage trembles from
morning till evening, the burying is already
almost achieved. The few poor stones which
still appear, barely emerging from the advancing
dunes, are the remains of what men, in their
superb revolts against death, had contrived to
make the most massively indestructible.

And this sun, this eternal sun, which parades
over Thebes the irony of its duration-for us so
impossible to calculate or to conceive! No,
where so much as here does one suffer from the
dismay of knowing that all our miserable little
human effervescence is only a sort of fermenta-
tion round an atom emanated from that sinister
ball of fire, and that that fire itself, the wonder-
ful sun, is no more than an ephemeral meteor,
a furtive spark, thrown off during one of the
innumerable cosmic transformations, in the
course of times without end and without
beginning.
