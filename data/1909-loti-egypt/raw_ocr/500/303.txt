many days and many nights, for, what with his
whiteness and the transparency of these Egyptian
nights, I have seen him often outlined in the dis..

phantom in his contemplative pose. And I feel
myself obsessed now by the continuance of his
attitude at this entrance of the ruins-l who shall

or thereabouts, the eyes of myriads of unknown
men and women, who have gone before me, saw
him just as I see him now, tranquil and white, in
this same place, seated before this same threshold,
with his head a little bent, and his pervading air
of thought.

white dreamer, which now are all illumined
with a last Bengal fire in the daily setting of
the sun.

And the hour is already twilight when I reach
the goddesses.

Their domain is so destroyed that the sands
