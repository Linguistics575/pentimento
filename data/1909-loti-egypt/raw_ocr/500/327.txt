A Town Promptly Embellished 285

And then there are the great tourist boats of
the Agencies, which are here in abundance, for
Assouan has the privilege of being the terminus
of the line ; and their whistlings, their revolving
motors, their electric dynamos maintain from
morning till night a captivating symphony. It
might be urged perhaps against these structures
that they resemble a little the washhouses on the
Seine ; but the Agencies, desirous of restoring to
them a certain local colour, have given them
names so notoriously Egyptian that one is reduced
to silence. They are called Sesostris, Amenophis
OT Ramses the Great.

And finally there are the rowing boats, which
carry passengers incessantly backwards and for-
wards between the river-banks. So long as the
season remains at its height they are bedecked
with a number of little flags of red cotton-cloth,
or even of simple paper. The rowers, moreover,
have been instructed to sing all the time the
native songs which are accompanied by a der-
boucca player seated in the prow. Nay, they
have even learnt to utter that rousing, stimulating
cry which Anglo-Saxons use to express their en-
thusiasm or their joy '. " Hip ! hip ! hurrah ! " and
you cannot conceive how well it sounds, coming
between the Arab songs, which otherwise might
be apt to grow monotonous.
