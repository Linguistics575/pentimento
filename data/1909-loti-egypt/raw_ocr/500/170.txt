14.0 Egypt
of Seti in the vicinity, where the enterprise of
Thomas Cook & Son flourishes, there is nothing
around us but ruins, crumbled and pulverised
beyond all possible redemption. But they give
us pause, these disappearing ruins, for they are
the debris of that ageless temple, where sleeps
the head of the god, the debris of the tombs of
the Middle and Ancient Empires, and they
indicate still the wide extent and development of
the necropoles of Abydos, so old that it almost
makes one giddy to think of their beginning.
Here, as at Thebes and Memphis, the tombs
of the Egyptians are met with only amongst
the sands and the parched rocks. The great
ancestral people, who would have shuddered at
our black trees, and the corruption of the damp
graves, liked to place its embalmed dead in the
midst of this luminous, changeless splendour of
death, which men call the desert.

And what is this now that is happening in
the holy neighbourhood of unhappy Osiris ? A
troupe of donkeys, belaboured by Bedouin
drivers, is being driven in the direction of the
adjacent temple, dedicated to the god by Seti !
The luncheon no doubt is over and the band
about to depart, sharp to the appointed hour
of the programme. Let us watch them from a
prudent distance.
