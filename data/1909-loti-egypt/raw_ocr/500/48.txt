2 6 Egypt

fifteen million pounds have done their work
conscientiously.

Everywhere is the blinding glare of the electric
light; monstrous hotels parade the sham splendour
of their painted fapades; the whole length of
the streets is one long triumph of imitation, of
mud walls plastered so as to look like stone ; a
medley of all styles, rockwork, Roman, Gothic,
New Art, Pharaonic, and, above all, the pre-
tentious and the absurd. Innumerable public-
houses overflow with bottles; every alcoholic
drink, all the poisons of the West, are here turned
into Egypt with a take-what-you-please.

And taverns, gambling dens and houses of ill-
fame. And parading the side-walks, numerous
Levantine damsels, who seek by their finely to
imitate their fellows of the Paris boulevards, but
who by mistake, as we must suppose, have placed
their orders with some costumier for performing
dogs.

This then is the Cairo of the future, this
cosmopolitan fair ! Good heavens ! When will
the Egyptians recollect themselves, when will
they realise that their forebears have left to them
an inalienable patrimony of art, of architecture
and exquisite refinement; and that, by their
negligence, one of those towns which used to be
the most beautiful in the world is falling into
ruin and about to perish?
