2 30 Egypt

Crumbling and dust. . . . Far around, on every
side of these palaces and temples of the central
artery which are the best preserved and re-
main proudly upright-stretch great mournful
spaces, on which the sun from morning till
evening pours an implacable light. There,
amongst the lank desert plants, lie blocks
scattered at hazard-the remains of sanctuaries,
of which neither the plan nor the form will ever
be discovered. But on these stones, fragments
of the history of the world are still to be read
in clear-cut hieroglyphs.

To the west of the hypostyle hall there is a
region strewn with discs, all equal and all alike.
It might be a draught-board for Titans with
draughts that would measure ten yards in cir-
cumference. They are the scattered fragments,
slices, as it were, of a colonnade of the Ramses.
Farther on the ground seems to have passed
through fire. You walk over blackish scoriae en-
crusted with brazen bolts and particles of melted
glass. It is the quarter burnt by the soldiers of
Cambyses. They were great destroyers of the
queen city, were these same Persian soldiers. To
break up the obelisks and the colossal statues they
conceived the plan of scorching them by lighting
bonfires around them, and then, when they saw
them burning hot, they deluged them with cold
water. And the granites cracked from top to base.
