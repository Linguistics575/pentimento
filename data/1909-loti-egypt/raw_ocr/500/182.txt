I s 2 Egypt

But to-day the foreigners are masters here,
and have wakened the old Nile--wakened to
enslave it. In less than twenty years they
have disfigured its valley, which until then had
preserved itself like a sanctuary. They have
silenced its cataracts, captured its precious water
by dams, to pour it afar off on plains that are
become like marshes and already sully with their
mists the crystal clearness of the sky. The
ancient rigging no longer suffices to water the
land under cultivation. Machines worked by
steam, which draw the water more quickly,
commence to rise along the banks, side by side
with new factories. Soon there will scarcely be
a river more dishonored than this, by iron
chimneys and thick, black smoke. And it is
happening apaee, this exploitation of the Nile--
hastily, greedily, as in a hunt for spoils. And
thus all its beauty disappears, for its monotonous
course, through regions endlessly alike, won us
only by its calm and its old-world mystery.

Poor Nile of the p1dligies ! One feels some-
times still its departing charm, stray corners of
it remain intact. There are days oftranscendent
clearness, incomparable evenings, when one may
still forget the ugliness and the smoke. But the
classic expedition by dahabiya, the ascent of the
river from Cairo to Nubia, will soon have ceased
to be worth making.
