I 8 2 Egypt

In a line with the Winter Palace a number of
stalls follow one another. All those things with
which our tourists are wont to array themselves
are on sale there: fans, fly flaps, helmets and
blue spectacles. And, in thousands, photographs
of the ruins. And there too are the toys, the
souvenirs of the Soudan: old negro knives,
panther-skins and gazelle horns. Numbers of
Indians even are come to this improvised fair,
bringing their stuffs from Rajputana and Cash-
mere. And, above all, there are dealers in
mummies, offering for sale mysteriously shaped
eoffins, mummy-cloths, dead hands, gods,
scarabai---and the thousand and one things that
this old soil has yielded for centuries like an
inexhaustible mine.

Along the stalls, keeping in the shade of the
houses and the scattered palms, pass represents.
tives of the plutocraey of the world. Dressed
by the same eostumiers, bedecked in the same
plumes, and with faces reddened by the same
sun, the millionaire daughters of Chicago
merchants elbow their sisters of the old nobility.
Pressing amongst them impudent young
Bedouins pester the fair travellers to mount their
saddled donkeys. And as if they were charged
to add to this babel a note of beauty, the
battalions of Mr Cook, of both sexes, and
always in a hurry, pass by with long strides.
