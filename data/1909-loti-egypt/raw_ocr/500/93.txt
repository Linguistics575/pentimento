out of date. Open, in glass cases, are numerous
inestimable Korans, which in olden times had
been written fair and illuminated on parchment
by pious khedives. And, in a place of honour,
a large astronomical glass, through which men
watch the rising of the moon of Ramadan. . . .
All this savours of the past. And what is being
taught to-day to the ten thousand students of
El-Azhar scarcely differs from what was taught
to their predecessors in the glorious reign of the
Fatimites-and which was then transcendent and
even new '. the Koran and all its commentaries ;
the subtleties of syntax and of pronunciation ;
jurisprudence; calligraphy, which still is dear to
the heart of Orientals ; versification ; and, last of
all, mathematics, of which the Arabs were the
inventors.

Yes, all this savours of the past, of the dust of
remote ages. And though, assuredly, the priests
trained in this thousand-year-old university may
grow to men of rarest soul, they will remain,
these calm and noble dreamers, merely laggards,
safe in their shelter from the whirlwind which
carries us along.

"lt is a sacrilege to prohibit knowledge. To seek know...
ledge is to perform an act of adoration towards God; to
instruct is to do an act of charity."

" Knowledge is the life of Islam, the column of faith."
Versesfrom the Hadith.
