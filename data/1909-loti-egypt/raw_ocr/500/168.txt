ever have happened to them, must date back to
a time long anterior to their enrolment. And I
remain perplexed 1

Without conviction now, we make our way
towards another temple, guaranteed solitary.
Indeed the sun blazes there a lonely sovereign in
the midst of a profound silence, and Egypt and
the past take us again into their folds.

Once more to Osiris, the god of heavenly
awakening in the necropolis of Abydos, this
sanctuary was built by Ramses II. But the
sands have covered it with their winding sheet
in vain, and have been able to preserve for us
only the lower and more deeply buried parts.
Men in their blind greed have destroyed the
upper portions,1 and its ruins, protected and
cleared as they are to-day, rise only some ten
or twelve feet from the ground. In the bas-
reliefs the majority of the figures have only
legs and a portion of the body; their heads
and shoulders have disappeared with the upper
parts of the walls. But they seem to have
preserved their vitality : the gesticulations, the
exaggerated pantomime of the attitudes of these
headless things, are more strange, more striking,

1 Not long ago a manufacturer, established in the neigh-
bourhood, discovering that the limestone of its walls was
friable, used this temple as a quarry, and for some years bas-
reliefs beyond price served as aliment to the mills of the
factory.
