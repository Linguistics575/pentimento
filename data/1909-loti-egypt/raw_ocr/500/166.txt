I 3 6 Egypt

on the pillars and walls-people who seem to
be signalling one to another and exchanging
amongst themselves mysterious signs, silently
and for ever.

But what is this noise in the sanctuary ? It
seems to be full of people. There, sure enough,
beyond a second row of columns, is quite a little
crowd talking loudly in English. I fancy that
I can hear the clinking of glasses and the tapping
of knives and forks.

Oh ! poor, poor temple, to what strange uses
are you come. . . . This excess of grotesqueness
in profanation is more insulting surely than to
be sacked by barbarians ! Behold a table set for
some thirty guests, and the guests themselves-
of both sexes-merry and lighthearted, belong to
that special type of humanity which patronises
Thomas Cook & Son (Egypt Ltd.). They wear
cork helmets, and the classic green spectacles ;
drink whisky and soda, and eat voraciously
sandwiches and other viands out of greasy
paper, which now litters the floor. 'And the
women ! Heavens ! what scarecrows they are !
And this kind of thing, so the black-robed
Bedouin guards inform us, is repeated every
day so long as the season lasts. A luncheon in
the temple of Osiris is part of the programme of
pleasure trips. Each day at noon a new band
arrives, on heedless and unfortunate donkeys.
