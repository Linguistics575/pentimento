Modern Luxor I 8 I

its minarets and its palm-trees, might as well
not exist. The famous temple and the forest
of heavy Osiridean columns admire themselves
in vain in the waters of the river. It is the end
of Luxor.

And what a crowd of people is here ! While,
on the contrary, the opposite bank seems so
absolutely desertlike, with its stretches of golden
sand and, on the horizon, its mountains of the
colour of glowing embers, which, as we know,
are full of mummies.

Poor Luxor! Along the banks is a row of
tourist boats, a sort of two or three storeyed
barracks, which nowadays infest the Nile from
Cairo to the Cataracts. Their whistlings and the
vibration of their dynamos make an intolerable
noise. How shall I find a quiet place for my
dahabiya, where the functionaries of Messrs Cook
will not come to disturb meâ€œ?

We can now see nothing of the palaces of
Thebes, whither I am to repair in the evening,
We are farther from them than we were last
night. The apparition during our moming's
journey had slowly receded in the plains flooded
by sunlight. And then the Winter Palace and
the new boats shut out the view.

But this modern quay of Luxor, where I dis-
embark at ten o'clock in the morning in clear and
radiant sunshine, is not without its amusing side.
