called also the west, to which it had to render

which the living were never able to attain,
because it fled before them, however fast they
might travel across the sands OI' over the waters.
On its arrival there, the scared soul had to parley
successively with the fearsome demons who lay
in wait for it along its route. If at last it was
judged worthy to approach Osiris, the great
Dead Sun, it was subsumed in him and reap-
peared, shining over the world the next morning
and on all succeeding mornings until the con-
summation of time--a vague survival in the
solar splendour, a continuation without person-
ality, of which one is scarcely able to say whether
or not it was more desirable than eternal non-
existence.

And, moreover, it was necessary to preserve
the body at whatever cost, for a certain double
of the dead man continued to dwell in the dry
flesh, and retained a kind of half life, barely
conscious. Lying at the bottom of the sarco-
phagus it was able to see, by virtue of those two
eyes, which were painted on the lid, always in

1 The Khou, which never returned to our world.
2 The Bai, which might, at its will, revisit the tomb.
