IN THE TOMBS OF THE APIS

THE dwelling-places of the Apis, in the grim
darkness beneath the Memphite desert, are, as
all the world knows, monster coffins of black
granite ranged in catacombs, hot and stifling as
eternal stoves.

To reach them from the banks of the N ile we
have first to traverse the low region which the in-
undations of the ancient river, regularly repeated
since the beginning of time, have rendered pro-
pitious to the growth of plants and to the de-
velopment of men ; an hour or two's journey, this
eveningthrough forests ofdate-trees whosebeauti-
ful palms temper the light of the March sun, which
is now half veiled in clouds and already declining.
In the distance herds are grazing in the cool shade.
And we meet fellahs leading back from the field
towards the village on the river-bank their little
donkeys, laden with sheaves of corn. The air
is mild and wholesome under the high tufts of
these endless green plumes, which move in the
warm wind almost without noise. We seem to
be in some happy land, where the pastoral life
should be easy, and even a little paradisaical.
