The Downfall of the Nile 151

early branches that one sees in spring, which
shoot first from the stem, and sometimes die
before the summer. It nursed that people,
whose least vestiges we discover to-day with
surprise and wonder ; a people who, in the very
dawn, in the midst of the original barbarity, con-
ceived magnificently the infinite and the divine ;
who placed with such certainty and grandeur the
first architectural lines, from which afterwards
our architecture was to be derived ; who laid the
bases of art, of science, and of all knowledge.

Later on, when this beautifulflowerof humanity
was faded, the Nile, flowing always in the midst of
its deserts, seems to have had for mission, during
nearly two thousand years, the maintenance on
its banks of a kind of immobility and desue-
tude, which was in a way a homage of respect
for these stupendous relics. While the sand was
burying the ruins of the temples and the battered
faces of the colossi, nothing changed under this
sky of changeless blue. The same cultivation
proceeded on the banks as in the oldest ages ; the
same boats, with the same sails, went up and down
the thread of water ; the same songs kept time
to the eternal human toil. The race of fellahs,
the unconscious guardian of a prodigious past,
slept on without desire of change, and almost
without suffering. And time passed for Egypt
in a great peace of sunlight and of death.
