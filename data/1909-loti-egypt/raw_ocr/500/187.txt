 

The Downfall of the Nile I53

Ordinarily this vo yage is made in the winter,
so that the traveller may follow the course of the
sun as it makes its escape towards the southern
hemisphere. The water then is low and the
valley parched. Leaving the cosmopolitan town
of modern Cairo, the iron bridges, and the pre-

it imparts a sense of sudden peacefulness to pass
along the large and rapid waters of this river,
between the curtains of palm-tmes on the banks,
borne by a dahabiya where one is master and, if
one likes, may be alone.

At first, for a day 01' two, the great haunting
triangles of the pyramids seem to follow you,
those of Dashur and that of Sakkarah succeeding
to those of Gizeh. For a long time the horizon
is disturbed by their gigantic silhouettes. As
we recede from them, and they disengage them-
selves better from neighbouring things, they
seem, as happens in the case of mountains, to
grow higher. And when they have finally dis- _
appeared, we have still to ascend slowly and by
stages some six hundred miles pf river before we
reach the first cataract. Ouri way lies through
monotonous desert regions where the hours and
days are marked chiefly by the variations of the
wonderful light. Except for the phantasmagoria
of the mornings and evenings, there is no out-
standing feature on these dull-coloured banks,
