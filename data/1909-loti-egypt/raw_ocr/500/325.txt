A Town Promptly Embellished 283

little too ready to ehide their fellow-country-
men; whereas on the contrary they showed
themselves very respectful and obliging when-
ever they were addressed by a traveller in a
cork helmet. But that is in virtue of an equit-
able and logical principle, derived by them from
the high places of the new administration--
namely, that the Egypt of to-day belongs far
less to the Egyptians than to the noble foreigners
who have come to brandish there the torch of
civilisation.

In the evening, after dark, the really respect-
able travellers do not quit the brilliant dining
saloons of the hotels, and the quay is left quite
solitary beneath the stars. It is at such a
time that one is able to realise how extremely
hospitable certain of the natives are become.
If, in an hour of melancholy, you walk alone on
the bank of the Nile, smoking a cigarette, you
will not fail to be accosted by one of these
good people, who, misunderstanding the cause
of the unrest in your soul, offers eagerly, and
with a touching frankness, to introduce you to
the gayest of the young ladies of the country.

In the other towns, which still remain purely
Egyptian, the people would never practise such
an excess of affability and good manners, which
have been learnt, beyond all question, from our
benefieent contact.
