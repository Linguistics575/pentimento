and restored to a semblance of life-mow, after a
cycle of seven or eight thousand years, when our
Western humanity, having left the primitive gods
that we see here, to embrace the Christian conception, which, even yesterday, made it live, is
in way of denying everything, and struggles
before the enigma of death in an obscurity more
dismal and more fearful than in the commencement of the ages. (More dismal and more
fearful still in this, that the plea of youth is
gone.) From all parts of Europe curious and
unquiet spirits, as well as mere idlers, turn their
steps towards Thebes, the ancient mother. Men
clear the rubbish from its remains, devise ways
of retarding the enormous fallings of its ruins,
and dig in its old soil, stored with hidden
treasure.

And this evening on one of the portals to
which I have just mounted-that which opens
at the north-west and terminates the colossal
artery of temples and palaces, many very diverse
groups have already taken their places, after the
pilgrimage of the day amongst the ruins. And
others are hastening towards the staircase by
which we have just climbed, so as not to miss
the grand spectacle of the sun setting, always
with the same serenity, the same unchanging
magnificence, behind the town which once was
consecrated to it.
