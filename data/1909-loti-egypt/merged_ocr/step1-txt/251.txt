Thebes by Night 217

columns which border it are so gigantic 1 that
their tops, formed of mysterious full-blown
petals, high up above the ground on which we
crawl, are completely bathed in the diffuse clearness of the sky. And enclosing this kind of
nave on either side, like a terrible forest, is
another mass of columns-monster columns,
of an earlier style, of which the capitals close
instead of opening, imitating the buds of some
flower which will never blossom. Sixty to the
right, sixty to the left, too close together for
their size, they grow thick like a forest of
baobabs that wanted space: they induce a
feeling of oppression without possible deliverance, of massive and mournful eternity.

And this, forsooth, was the place that I had
wished to traverse alone, without even the
Bedouin guard, who at night believes it his duty
to follow the visitors. But now it grows lighter
and lighter. Too light even, for a blue phosphorescence, coming from the eastern horizon, begins
to filter through the opacity of the colonnades
on the right, outlines the monstrous shafts, and
details them by vague glimmerings on their
edges. The full moon is risen, alas! and my
hours of solitude are nearly over.

including the capital.
