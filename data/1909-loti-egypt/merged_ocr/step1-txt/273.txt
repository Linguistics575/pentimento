An Audience of Amenophis II. 239

filth of their entrails. That chain of living rocks
that rises before us, coloured each morning with
the same rose, as of a tender flower, is literally
stuffed with dead bodies.

We have to cross a wide plain before reaching
the mountains, and on our way cornfields alternate with stretches of sand already desertlike.
Behind us extends the old Nile and the opposite
bank which we have lately quitted-the bank of
Luxor, whose gigantic Pharaonic colonnades are
as it were lengthened below by their own reflection in the mirror of the river. And in this
radiant morning, in this pure light, it would be
admirable, this eternal temple, with its image
reversed in the depth of the blue water, were it
not that at its sides, and to twice its height, rises
the impudent Winter Palace, that monster hotel
built last year for the fastidious tourists. And
yet, who knows? The jackanapes who-deposited
this abomination on the sacred soil of Egypt
perhaps imagines that he equals the merit of the
artist who is now restoring the sanctuaries of
Thebes, or even the glory of the Pharaohs who
built them.

As we draw nearer to the chain of Libya,
where this king awaits us, we traverse fields still
green with growing corn-and sparrows and
larks sing around us in the impetuous spring of
this land of Thebes.
