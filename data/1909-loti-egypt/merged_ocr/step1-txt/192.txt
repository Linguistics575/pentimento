silent recess, where we may moor our dahabiya
against the venerable earth of the bank.

And so one goes on, for days and weeks,
between these two interminable cliffs of reddish
chalk, filled with their hypogea and mummies,
which are the walls of the valley of the Nile,
and will follow us up to the first cataract, until
our entrance into Nubia. There only will the
appearance and nature of the rocks of the desert
change, to become the more sombre granite
out of which the Pharaohs carved their obelisks
and the great figures of their gods.

We go on and on, ascending the thread of this
eternal current, and the regularity of the wind,
the persistent clearness of the sky, the monotony
of the great river, which winds but never ends,
all conspire to make us forget the hours and days
that pass. However deceived and disappointed
we may be at seeing the profanation of the river
banks, here, nevertheless, isolated on the water,
we do not lose the peace of being a wanderer, a
stranger amongst an equipage of silent Arabs,
who every evening prostrate themselves in confiding prayer.

And, moreover, we are moving towards the
south, towards the sun, and every day has a more
entrancing clearness, a more caressing warmth,
and the bronze of the faces that we see on our
way takes on a deeper tint.
