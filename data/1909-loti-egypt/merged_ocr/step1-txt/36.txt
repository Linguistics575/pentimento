I 8 Egypt
hang it, a little of the desert solitude. And so
the eye can see from far off and from all sides
the mosque of Mehemet Ali, with the flattened
domes of its cupolas, its pointed minarets, its
general aspect so entirely Turkish, perched high
up, with a certain unexpectedness, above the
Arab town which it dominates. The prince
who sleeps there wished that it should resemble
the mosques of his fatherland, and it looks as if
it had been transported bodily from Stamboul.
A short trot brings us up to the lower gate
of the old fortress; and, by a natural effect, as
we ascend, all Cairo, which is near there, seems
to rise with us: not yet indeed the endless
multitude of its houses; but at first only the
thousands of its minarets, which in a few seconds
point their high towers into the mournful sky,
and suggest at once that an immense town is
about to unfold itself under our eyes.
Continuing to ascend-past the double rampart, the double or triple gates, which all these
old fortresses possess, we penetrate at length into
a large fortified courtyard, the crenellated walls
of which shut out our further view. Soldiers
are on guard there-and how unexpected are
such soldiers in this holy place of Egypt! The
red uniforms and the white faces of the north:
Englishmen, billeted in the palace of Mehemet
Ali!
