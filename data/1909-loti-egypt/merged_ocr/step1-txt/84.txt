me to turn back again, and look behind. And
it seems to me that already the woman with the
baby is slowly raising herself, with a thousand
precautions and stratagems, her head still completely covered. While farther down, that dishevelled hair.... Oh! I can see her well, sitting
up with a sudden jerk, the ghoul with the enamel
eyes, the lady Nsitanebashru!
