Thebes in Sunlight 231

It is well known, of course, that Thebes used
to extend for a considerable distance both on
this, the right, bank of the Nile, where the
Pharaohs resided, and opposite, on the Libyan
bank, given over to the preparers of mummies
and to the mortuary temples. But to-day,
except for the great palaces of the centre, it
is little more than a litter of ruins, and the
long avenues, lined with endless rows of sphinxes
01' rams, are lost, goodness knows where, buried
beneath the sand.

At wide intervals, however, in the midst of
these cemeteries of things, a temple here and
there remains upright, preserving still its sanctified gloom beneath its cavernous carapace. One,
where certain celebrated oracles used to be
delivered, is even more prisonlike and sepulchral
than the others in its eternal shadow. High up
in a wall the black hole of a kind of grotto
opens, to which a secret corridor coming from
the depths used to lead. It was there that the
face of the priest charged with the announcement
of the sibylline words appeared-and the ceiling
of his niche is all covered still with the smoke
from the flame of his lamp, which was extinguished more than two thousand years ago!

What a number of ruins, scarcely merging
from the sand of the desert, are hereabout!
