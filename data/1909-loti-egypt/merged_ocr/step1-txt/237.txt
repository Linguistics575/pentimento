Evening at Thebes 2 03

in carriages, others on donkeys, they go to
recruit themselves with the electricity and
elegance of Luxor, the neighbouring town
(wines and spirits are paid for as extras, and we
dress for dinner). And the dust condescends to
mark their exodus also by a last cloud of gold
beneath the palm-trees of the road.

An immediate solemnity succeeds to their
departure. Above the mud houses of the fellah
villages rise slender columns of smoke, which are
of a periwinkle-blue in the midst of the still
yellow atmosphere. They tell of the humble
life of these little homesteads, subsisting here,
where in the backward of the ages were so many
palaces and splendours.

And the first bayings of the watchdogs
announce already the vague uneasiness of the
evenings around the ruins. There is no one now
within the mummy-town, which seems all at
once to have grown larger in the silence. Very
quickly the violet shadow covers it, all save the
extreme points of its obelisks, which keep still a
little of their rose-colour. The feeling comes
over you that a sovereign mystery has taken
possession of the town, as if some vague phantom
things had just passed into it.
