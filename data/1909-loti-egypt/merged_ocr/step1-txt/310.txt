nocturnal hunt for human flesh. Pitch darkness
reigns within and I have to grope my way.
Quickly I light a match. Yes, there she is
indeed, alone and upright, almost part of the end
wall, on which my little light makes the horrible
shadow of her head dance. The match goes out
-irreverently I light many more under her chin,
under that heavy, man-eating jaw. In very
sooth, she is terrifying. Of black granite-like
her sisters, seated on the margin of the mournful
lake-but much taller than they, from six to eight
feet in height, she has a woman's body, exquisitely slim and young, with the breasts of a
virgin. Very chaste in attitude, she holds in
her hand a long-stemmed lotus flower, but by a
contrast that nonplusses and paralyses you the
delicate shoulders support the monstrosity of a
huge lioness' head. The lappets of her bonnet
fall on either side of her ears almost down to her
breast, and surmounting the bonnet, by way of
addition to the mysterious pomp, is a large moon
disc. Her dead stare gives to the ferocity of her
visage something unreasoning and fatal; an
irresponsible ogress, without pity as without
pleasure, devouring after the manner of Nature
and of Time. And it was so perhaps that she
was understood by the initiated of ancient
Egypt, who symbolised everything for the
people in the figures of gods.
