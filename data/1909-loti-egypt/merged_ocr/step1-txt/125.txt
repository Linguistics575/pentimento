The Outskirts of Cairo 95

vening nothingness, we find ourselves in a
new town; streets with little low houses, little
cross-roads, little squares, all of them white, on
whitened sands, beneath a white moon....
But there is no electricity in this town, no
lights, and nobody is stirring; doors and windows
are shut: no movement of any kind, and the
silence, at first, is like that of the surrounding
desert. It is a town in which the half-light of
the moon, amongst so much vague whiteness,
is diffused in such a way that it seems to come
from all sides at once and things cast no shadows
which might give them definiteness; a town
where the soil is so yielding that our progress is
weakened and retarded, as in dreams. It seems
unreal: and, in penetrating farther into it, a
sense of fear comes over you that can neither
be dismissed nor defined.

For assuredly this is no ordinary town....
And yet the houses, with their windows barred
like those of a harem, are in no way singular---except that they are shut and silent. It is all
this whiteness, perhaps, which freezes us. And
then, too, the silence is not, in fact, like that of
the desert, which did at least seem natural,
inasmuch as there was nothing there; here, on
the contrary, there is a sense of innumerable
presences, which shrink away as you pass but
nevertheless continue to watch attentively....
