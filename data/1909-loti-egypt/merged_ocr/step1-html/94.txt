<span>68 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
The lesson of the morning is now finished and<br/>
we are able, without disturbing anybody, to visit<br/>
the mosque.<br/>
<br/>
When we return to the great courtyard, with<br/>
its battlemented walls, it is the hour of recreation for this crowd of young men in robes and<br/>
turbans, who now emerge from the shadow of<br/>
the sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
Since the early morning they have remained<br/>
seated on their mats, immersed in study and<br/>
prayer, amid the confused buzzing of their thousands of voices; and now they scatter themselves<br/>
about the contiguous Arab quarters until such<br/>
time as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">evening </span>lessons commence. They<br/>
walk along in little groups, sometimes holding<br/>
one another's hands like children; most of them<br/>
carry their heads high and raise their eyes to<br/>
the heavens, although the sun which greets<br/>
them outside dazzles them a little with its rays.<br/>
They seem innumerable, and as they pass show<br/>
us faces of the most diverse types. They come<br/>
from all quarters of the world; some from<br/>
Baghdad, others from Bassorah, from Mossul and<br/>
even from the interior of Hedjaz. Those from<br/>
the north have eyes that are bright and clear;<br/>
and amongst those from Moghreb, from Morocco<br/>
and the Sahara, are many whose skins are<br/>
almost black. But the expression of all the<br/>
faces is alike'. something of ecstasy and of aloof<br/>
<br/>
