<span>The Mosques of Cairo 33<br/>
<br/>
street outside there was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">clamorous </span>uproar<br/>
of an Oriental crowd, cries of sellers, and the<br/>
noise of humble old-world trading; men and<br/>
beasts jostled you; there seemed a scarcity of<br/>
air beneath those so numerous overhanging<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">mushrabiyas</span>. But here suddenly there is<br/>
silence, broken only by the vague murmur of<br/>
prayers and the sweet songs of birds; there is<br/>
silence too, and the sense of open space, in the<br/>
holy garden enclosed within high walls; and<br/>
again in the sanctuary, resplendent in its quiet<br/>
and restful magnificence. Few people as a rule<br/>
frequent the mosques, except of course at the<br/>
hours of the five services of the day. In a few<br/>
chosen corners, particularly cool and shady,<br/>
some <span style="color: #ff0000;">greybeards </span>isolate themselves to read from<br/>
morning till night the holy books and to ponder<br/>
the thought of approaching death<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>they may be<br/>
seen there in their white turbans, with their white<br/>
beards and grave faces. And there may be, too,<br/>
some few poor homeless outcasts, who are come<br/>
to seek the hospitality of Allah, and sleep,<br/>
-careless of the morrow, stretched to their full<br/>
length on mats.<br/>
<br/>
The peculiar charm of the gardens of the<br/>
mosques, which are often very extensive, is that<br/>
they are so jealously enclosed within their high<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">walls-crowned </span>always with stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">trefoils-which </span>completely shut out the hubbub of the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">c<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
