<span>The Passing of Cairo 19<br/>
<br/>
The mosque first meets the eye, preceding the<br/>
palace. And as we approach, it is Stamboul<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">indeed-Mor </span>me dear old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stamboul</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is<br/>
called to mind; there is nothing, whether in<br/>
the lines of its architecture 01' in the details of<br/>
its ornamentation, to suggest the art of the Arabs<br/>
-a purer art it may be than this and of which<br/>
many excellent examples may be seen in Cairo.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span>; it is a corner of Turkey into which we are<br/>
suddenly come.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond a courtyard paved with marble, silent<br/>
and enclosed, which serves as a vast parvis, the<br/>
sanctuary recalls those of Mehmet Fatih <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the<br/>
Chah <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zad√©</span>: the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctified </span>gloom, into<br/>
which the stained glass of the narrow windows<br/>
casts a splendour as of precious stones; the same<br/>
extreme distance between the enormous pillars,<br/>
leaving more clear space than in our churches,<br/>
and giving to the domes the appearance of<br/>
being held up by enchantment.<br/>
<br/>
The walls are of a strange white marble<br/>
streaked with yellow. The ground is <span style="color: #ff0000;">com</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">pletely </span>covered with carpets of a sombre red.<br/>
In the vaults, very elaborately wrought, nothing<br/>
but blacks and golds<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>a background of black<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">bestrewn </span>with golden roses, and bordered with<br/>
arabesques like gold lace. And from above hang<br/>
thousands of golden chains supporting the vigil<br/>
lamps for the evening prayers. Here and there<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
