The tables and the crockery remain, of course, in<br/>

</span>Let us escape quickly, if possible before the<br/>
sight shall have become graven on our memory.<br/>
<br/>
But alas! even when we are outside, alone<br/>
again on the expanse of dazzling sands, we can<br/>
no longer take things seriously. Abydos and the<br/>
desert have ceased to exist. The faces of those<br/>
women remain to haunt us, their faces and their<br/>

ugliness associated with the name of Cook was<br/>
once explained to me in this wise, and the<br/>
explanation at first sight seemed satisfactory:<br/>
"The United Kingdom, justifiably jealous of<br/>

those who are classed as too ugly to reproduce<br/>
their kind are accorded an unlimited account<br/>
at Thomas Cook & Sons, and thus vowed to a<br/>
course of perpetual travel, which leaves them<br/>
no time to think of certain trifles incidental to<br/>
life." The explanation, as I say, seduced me<br/>
