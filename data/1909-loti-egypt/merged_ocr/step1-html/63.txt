<span>The Mosques of Cairo 37<br/>
<br/>
khedive of earlier times, or a soldier, or a martyr.<br/>
And the mausoleum, which communicates with<br/>
the sanctuary by means of a long passage, sometimes open, sometimes covered with gratings, is<br/>
surmounted always by a special kind of cupola,<br/>
a very high and curious <span style="color: #0000FF;">cupola</span>, which raises<br/>
itself into the sky like some gigantic dervish hat.<br/>
Above the Arab town, and even in the sand of<br/>
the neighbouring desert, these funeral domes<br/>
may be seen on every side adjoining the old<br/>
mosques to which they belong. And in the<br/>
evening, when the light is failing, they suggest<br/>
the odd idea that it is the dead man himself,<br/>
immensely magnified, who stands there beneath<br/>
a hat that is become immense. One can pray,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">if </span>one wishes, in this resting-place of the dead<br/>
saint as well as in the mosque. Here indeed<br/>
it is always more secluded and more in shadow.<br/>
It is more simple, too, at least up to the height of<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">man</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>on a platform of white marble, more or<br/>
less worn and yellowed by the touch of pious<br/>
hands, nothing more than an austere catafalque<br/>
of similar marble, ornamented merely with a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cufic </span>inscription. But if you raise your eyes to<br/>
look at the interior of the dome-the inside, as<br/>
it were, of the strange dervish hat-you will see<br/>
shining between the clusters of painted and<br/>
gilded stalactites a number of windows of exquisite colouring, little windows that seem to be<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
