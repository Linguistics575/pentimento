<br/>
since the time when Thebes ceased to live. But<br/>
now men are <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavouring </span>to restore the ancient<br/>
level. At first sight the task seemed impossible,<br/>
but they will achieve it in the end, even with<br/>
their simple means, these fellah toilers, who sing<br/>
as they labour at their incessant work of ants.<br/>
Soon the grand hypostyle will be freed from<br/>
rubbish, and its columns, which even before<br/>
seemed so tremendous, uncovered now to the<br/>
base, have added another twenty feet to their<br/>
height. A number of colossal statues, which lay<br/>
asleep beneath this shroud of earth and sand,<br/>
have been brought back to the light, set upright<br/>
again and have resumed their watch in the<br/>
intimidating thoroughfares for a new period of<br/>
quasi-eternity. Year by year the town-mummy<br/>
is being slowly exhumed by dint of prodigious<br/>
effort; and is repeopled again by gods and kings<br/>
who had been hidden for thousands of <span style="color: #0000FF;">years</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>1<br/>
Year in, year out, the digging <span style="color: #0000FF;">continues-leper<br/>
</span>and deeper. It is scarcely known to what depth<br/>
the debris and the ruins descend. Thebes had<br/>
endured for so many centuries, the earth here is<br/>
so penetrated with human past, that it is averred<br/>
that, under the oldest of the known temples,<br/>

1 As is generally known, the maintenance of the ancient<br/>
monuments of Egypt and their restoration, so far as that may<br/>
be possible, has been entrusted to the French. M. Maspero<br/>
has delegated to Thebes an artist and a scholar, M. Legrain<br/>
by name, who is devoting his life passionately to the work.<br/>
