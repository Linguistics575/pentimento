<span>CHAPTER XVIII<br/>
AT <span style="color: #0000FF;">THEBES </span>IN THE TEMPLE OF THE OGRESS<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THIS </span>evening, in the vast chaos of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins-at </span>the<br/>
hour in which the light of the sun begins to turn<br/>
to rose--<span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span>make my way along one of the magnificent roads of the town-mummy, that, in fact,<br/>
which goes off at a right angle to the line of the<br/>
temples of Amen, and, losing itself more or less<br/>
in the sands, leads at length to a sacred lake on<br/>
the border of which certain <span style="color: #ff0000;">cat-headed </span>goddesses<br/>
are seated in state watching the dead water and<br/>
the expanse of the desert. This particular road<br/>
was begun three thousand four hundred years<br/>
ago by a beautiful queen called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Makeri,1 </span>and in<br/>
the following centuries a number of kings continued its construction. It was ornamented<br/>
with pylons of a superb <span style="color: #0000FF;">massiveness-pylons </span>are<br/>
monumental walls, in the form of a trapezium<br/>
with a wide base, covered entirely with hieroglyphs, which the Egyptians used to place at<br/>
either side of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">porticoes </span>and long avenues--as well as by <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statues and interminable<br/>
rows of <span style="color: #0000FF;">rams</span>, larger than buffaloes, crouched on<br/>
pedestals.<br/>
