<span>86 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
of King Cambyses.... Who were the Titans<br/>
who, century after century, were able to hew<br/>
these <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>(they are at least twelve feet long<br/>
by ten feet high), and, having hewn them, to<br/>
carry them underground (they weigh on an<br/>
average between sixty and seventy tons), and<br/>
finally to range them in rows here in these<br/>
strange chambers, where they stand as if in<br/>
ambuscade on either side of us as we pass?<br/>
Each in its turn has contained quite comfortably the mummy of a bull Apis, armoured in<br/>
plates of gold. But in spite of their weight, in<br/>
spite of their solidity which effectively defies<br/>
destruction, they have been despoiled I-when is<br/>
not precisely known, probably by the soldiers of<br/>
the King of Persia. And this notwithstanding<br/>
that merely to open them represents a labour<br/>
of astonishing strength and patience. In some<br/>
cases the thieves have succeeded, by the aid of<br/>
levers, in moving a few inches the formidable<br/>
lid; in others, by persevering with blows of<br/>
pickaxes, they have pierced, in the thickness of<br/>
the granite, a hole through which a man has<br/>
been enabled to crawl like a rat, or a worm, and<br/>
<br/>
1 One, however, remains intact in its walled cavern,<br/>
and thus preserves for us the only Apis which has come<br/>
down to our days. And one recalls the emotion of Mariette,<br/>
when, on entering it, he saw on the sandy ground the im<br/>
print of the naked feet of the last Egyptian who left it thirtyseven centuries before,<br/>
