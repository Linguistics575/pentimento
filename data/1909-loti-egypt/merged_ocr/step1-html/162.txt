<br/>
</span>rose-colour, and too desolate; but, nevertheless,<br/>
amidst this glad music of the fields, these songs<br/>
of larks and twitterings of sparrows, you scarcely<br/>
realise that you are in a foreign land.<br/>
<br/>
Abydos! what magic there is in the name!<br/>
"Abydos is at hand, and in another moment we<br/>
shall be there." The mere words seem somehow<br/>
to transform the aspect of the homely green<br/>
fields, and make this pastoral region almost<br/>
imposing. The buzzing of the flies increases in<br/>
the overheated air and the song of the birds <span style="color: #0000FF;">sub..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sides </span>until at last it dies away in the approach<br/>
of noon.<br/>
<br/>
We have been journeying a little more than<br/>
an hour amongst the verdure of the growing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">corn </span>that lies upon the fields like a carpet, when<br/>
suddenly, beyond the little houses and trees of<br/>
a village, quite a different world is <span style="color: #0000FF;">disclosed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>familiar world of glare and death which<br/>
presses so closely upon inhabited Egypt: the<br/>
desert! the desert of Libya, and now as ever<br/>
when we come upon it suddenly from the banks<br/>
of the old river, it rises up before us; beginning<br/>
at once, without transition, absolute and terrible,<br/>
as soon as we leave the thick velvet of the last<br/>
field, the cool shade of the last acacia. Its<br/>
sands seem to slope towards us, in a prodigious<br/>
incline, from the strange mountains that we saw<br/>
from the happy plain, and which now appear,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
