<br/>
</span>Crumbling and dust.... Far around, on every<br/>
side of these palaces and temples of the central<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">artery </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are the best preserved and remain proudly upright-stretch great mournful<br/>
spaces, on which the sun from morning till<br/>
evening pours an implacable light. There,<br/>
amongst the lank desert plants, lie blocks<br/>
scattered at hazard-the remains of sanctuaries,<br/>
of which neither the plan nor the form will ever<br/>
be discovered. But on these stones, fragments<br/>
of the history of the world are still to be read<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">clear-cut </span>hieroglyphs.<br/>
<br/>
To the west of the hypostyle hall there is a<br/>
region strewn with discs, all equal and all alike.<br/>
It might be a draught-board for Titans with<br/>
draughts that would measure ten yards in circumference. They are the scattered fragments,<br/>
slices, as it were, of a colonnade of the Ramses.<br/>
Farther on the ground seems to have passed<br/>
through fire. You walk over blackish <span style="color: #0000FF;">scoriae </span>encrusted with brazen bolts and particles of melted<br/>
glass. It is the quarter burnt by the soldiers of<br/>
Cambyses. They were great destroyers of the<br/>
queen city, were these same Persian soldiers. To<br/>
break up the obelisks and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statues they<br/>
conceived the plan of scorching them by lighting<br/>
bonfires around them, and then, when they saw<br/>
them burning hot, they deluged them with cold<br/>
water. And the granites cracked from top to base<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
