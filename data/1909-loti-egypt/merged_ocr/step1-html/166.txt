<span>I 3 6 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
<br/>
</span>on the pillars and walls-people who seem to<br/>
be signalling one to another and exchanging<br/>
amongst themselves mysterious signs, silently<br/>
and for ever.<br/>
<br/>
But what is this noise in the sanctuary? It<br/>
seems to be full of people. There, sure enough,<br/>
beyond a second row of columns, is quite a little<br/>
crowd talking loudly in English. I fancy that<br/>
I can hear the clinking of glasses and the tapping<br/>
of knives and forks.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! poor, poor temple, to what strange uses<br/>
are you come...<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>This excess of grotesqueness<br/>
in profanation is more insulting surely than to<br/>
be sacked by barbarians! Behold a table set for<br/>
some thirty guests, and the guests <span style="color: #ff0000;">themselvesof </span>both sexes-merry and lighthearted, belong to<br/>
that special type of humanity which <span style="color: #ff0000;">patronises<br/>
</span>Thomas Cook & Son (Egypt Ltd.). They wear<br/>
cork helmets, and the classic green spectacles;<br/>
drink whisky and soda, and eat voraciously<br/>
sandwiches and other viands out of greasy<br/>
paper, which now litters the floor.'And the<br/>
women! Heavens! what scarecrows they are!<br/>
And this kind of thing, so the black-robed<br/>
Bedouin guards inform us, is repeated every<br/>
day so long as the season lasts. A luncheon in<br/>
the temple of Osiris is part of the programme of<br/>
pleasure trips. Each day at noon a new band<br/>
arrives, on heedless and unfortunate donkeys<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
