they have preserved too, in an extraordinary<br/>
degree, the brightness of their antique paintings,<br/>
the fresh tints of their costumes, of their robes<br/>
of turquoise blue, or lapis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">emerald-green</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>

Libyan mountains beyond. Towards the north<br/>
and west of the solitudes, shapeless ruins of<br/>
tawny-coloured blocks follow one another in<br/>
the sands until the dazzling distance ends in a<br/>
clear-cut line against the sky. Apart from this<br/>
temple of Ramses, where we now stand, and that<br/>
