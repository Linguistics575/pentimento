<br/>
horses, faster than their donkeys, overtake them<br/>
in the return journey amongst the green cornfields of Abydos; and in a stoppage in the<br/>
narrow roadway, caused by a meeting with a<br/>
number of camels laden with <span style="color: #0000FF;">lucerne</span>, we are<br/>
brought to a halt in their midst. Almost<br/>
touching me is a dear little white donkey, who<br/>
looks at me pensively and in such a way that<br/>
we at once understand one another. A mutual<br/>
sympathy unites us. A <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cookess </span>in spectacles<br/>
surmounts him-the most hideous of them all,<br/>
bony and severe. Over her travelling costume,<br/>
already sufficiently repulsive, she wears a tennis<br/>
jersey, which accentuates the angularity of her<br/>
figure, and in her person she seems the very<br/>
incarnation of the respectability of the British<br/>
Isles. It would be more equitable, too-so long<br/>
are those legs of hers, which, to be sure, have<br/>
scant interest for the tourist--if she carried the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>donkey.<br/>
<br/>
The poor little white thing regards me with<br/>
melancholy. His ears twitch <span style="color: #0000FF;">restlessly </span>and his<br/>
beautiful eyes, so fine, so observant of everything,<br/>
say to me as plain as words'.<br/>
<br/>
"She is a beauty, isn't she? "<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>She is, indeed, my poor little donkey. But<br/>
think of this'. fixed on thy back as she is, thou<br/>
hast this advantage over <span style="color: #0000FF;">me-thou </span>seest her<br/>
not <span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span>"<br/>
