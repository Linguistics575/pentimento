<span>262 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
At the first pylons I have to make a detour.<br/>
They are so ruinous that their blocks, fallen<br/>
down on all sides, have closed the passage. Here<br/>
used to watch, on right and left, two upright<br/>
giants of red granite from Syene. Long ago,<br/>
in times no longer precisely known, they were<br/>
broken off, both of them, at the height of the<br/>
loins. But their muscular legs have kept their<br/>
proud, marching attitude, and each in one of the<br/>
armless hands, which reach to the end of the<br/>
cloth that girds their loins, clenches passionately<br/>
the emblem of eternal life. And this Syenite<br/>
granite is so hard that time has not altered it in<br/>
the least; in the midst of the confusion of stones<br/>
the thighs of these mutilated giants gleam as if<br/>
they had been polished yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Farther on we come upon the second pylons,<br/>
foundered also, before which stands a row of<br/>
Pharaohs.<br/>
<br/>
On every side the overthrown blocks display<br/>
their utter confusion of gigantic things in the<br/>
midst of the sand which continues patiently to<br/>
bury them. And here now are the third pylons,<br/>
flanked by their two marching giants, who have<br/>
neither head nor shoulders. And the road,<br/>
marked majestically still by the debris, continues<br/>
to lead towards the desert.<br/>
<br/>
And then the fourth and last pylons, which<br/>
seem at first sight to mark the extremity of the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
