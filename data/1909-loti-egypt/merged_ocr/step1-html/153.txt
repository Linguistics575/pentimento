prescribed by tradition. Round their eyelids<br/>
and their moist lips are glued little clusters of<br/>
Egyptian flies, which are considered here to be<br/>
beneficial to the children, and the latter have<br/>
no thought of driving them away, so resigned<br/>
are they become, by force of heredity, to whatever annoyance they thereby suffer. Another<br/>
example indeed of the passivity which their<br/>
fathers show when brought face to face with<br/>
the invading foreigners!<br/>
<br/>
Passivity and meek endurance seem to be<br/>
the characteristics of this inoffensive people,<br/>
so graceful in their rags, so mysterious in their<br/>
age-old immobility, and so ready to accept with<br/>
an equal indifference whatever yoke may come.<br/>
Poor, beautiful people, with muscles that never<br/>
grow tired! Whose men in olden times moved<br/>
the great stones of the temples, and knew no<br/>
burden that was too heavy; whose women, with<br/>
their slender, pale-tawny arms and delicate small<br/>
hands, surpass by far in strength the <span style="color: #ff0000;">burliest<br/>
</span>of our peasants! Poor beautiful race of bronze!<br/>
No doubt it was too precocious and put forth<br/>
too soon its astonishing flower-in times when<br/>
the other peoples of the earth were still vegetating in obscurity; no doubt its present resignation comes from lassitude, after so many centuries<br/>
of effort and expansive power. Once it monopolised the glory of the world, and here it is<br/>
