<br/>
poor tombs runs no risk of being <span style="color: #ff0000;">coveted-mot<br/>
</span>even in the irreverent times of the future. No,<br/>
it is on the other side of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cairo-tm </span>the other<br/>
bank of the Nile, amongst the verdure of the<br/>
palm-trees, that we must look for the suburb in<br/>
course of transformation, with its villas of the<br/>
invading foreigner, and the myriad electric lights<br/>
along its motor roads. On this side there is no<br/>
such fear; the peace and desuetude are eternal;<br/>
and the winding sheet of the Arabian sands is<br/>
ready always for its burial office.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of this town of the dead, the desert<br/>
again opens before us its mournful whitened<br/>
expanse. On such a night as this, when the<br/>
wind blows cold and the misty moon shows like<br/>
a sad opal, it looks like a steppe under snow.<br/>
<br/>
But it is a desert planted with ruins, with the<br/>
ghosts of mosques; a whole colony of high<br/>
tumbling domes are scattered here at hazard<br/>
on the shifting extent of the sands. And what<br/>
strange old-fashioned domes they <span style="color: #0000FF;">are</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>The<br/>
archaism of their silhouettes strikes us from the<br/>
first, as much as their isolation in such a place.<br/>
They look like bells, OI' gigantic dervish hats<br/>
placed on pedestals, and those farthest away<br/>
give the impression of squat, large-headed figures<br/>
posted there as sentinels, watching the vague<br/>
horizon of Arabia beyond.<br/>
<br/>
They are the proud tombs of the fourteenth<br/>
<br/>
