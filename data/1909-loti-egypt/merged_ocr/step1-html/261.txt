it arrives in the very axis of this avenue, of<br/>
this suite of aisles, which measures more<br/>
than 800 yards in length. Formerly, then, on<br/>
these evenings it shone horizontally beneath<br/>
the terrible ceilings-between these rows of<br/>
pillars which are as high as our Colonne<br/>

almost negligible by the side of the great<br/>
monoliths they dig and dig. Patiently they<br/>
clear the ruins, and the earth goes away in little<br/>
parcels in rows of baskets carried by children in<br/>
the form of a chain. The periodical deposits of<br/>
the Nile, and the sand carried by the wind of the<br/>
desert, had raised the soil by about six yards<br/>
