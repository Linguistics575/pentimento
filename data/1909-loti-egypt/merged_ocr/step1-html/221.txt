<br/>
</span>solitude and all noise in the neighbourhood has<br/>
ceased.<br/>
<br/>
An avenue bordered by very high columns, of<br/>
which the capitals are in the form of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">full..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">blown </span>flowers of the papyrus, leads me to a place<br/>
shut in and almost terrible, where is massed an<br/>
assembly of colossi. Two, who, if they were<br/>
standing, would be quite ten yards in height, are<br/>
seated on thrones on either side of the entrance.<br/>
The others, ranged on the three sides of the<br/>
courtyard, stand upright behind colonnades, but<br/>
look as if they were about to issue thence and to<br/>
stride rapidly towards me. Some, broken and<br/>
battered, have lost their faces and preserve only<br/>
their intimidating attitude. Those that remain<br/>
intact-white faces beneath their Sphinx's headgear-open their eyes wide and smile.<br/>
<br/>
This was formerly the principal entrance, and<br/>
the office of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossi </span>was to welcome the<br/>
multitudes. But now the gates of honour flanked<br/>
by obelisks of red granite, are obstructed by<br/>
a litter of enormous ruins. And the courtyard<br/>
has become a place voluntarily closed, where<br/>
nothing of the outside world is any longer to be<br/>
seen. In moments of silence, one can abstract<br/>
oneself from all the neighbouring modern things,<br/>
and forget the hour, the day, the century even,<br/>
in the midst of these gigantic figures, whose<br/>
smile disdains the flight of ages. The granites<br/>
