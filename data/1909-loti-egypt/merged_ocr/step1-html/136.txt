<br/>
the plaintive little ones beneath their black veils<br/>
and seek to comfort them<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>And the sorcerer,<br/>
who plays the cymbals, is a kind old priest, or<br/>
sacristan, who smiles paternally. If he makes<br/>
all this noise, in a rhythm which in itself is full<br/>
of joy, it is to mark the gladness of Easter morn,<br/>
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ-and a<br/>
little, too, no doubt, to distract the little ones,<br/>
some of whom are woefully put out. But their<br/>
mammas do not prolong the proof-a mere<br/>
momentary visit to this venerable place, which<br/>
is to bring them happiness, and they carry their<br/>
babes away<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>and others are led in by the dark,<br/>
narrow staircase, so low that one cannot stand<br/>
upright in it. And thus the crypt is not<br/>
emptied. And meanwhile mass is being said<br/>
in the church overhead.<br/>
<br/>
But what a number of people, of black veils,<br/>
are in this hovel, where the air can scarcely be<br/>
breathed, and where the barbarous music, mingled<br/>
with wailings and cries, deafens you! And what<br/>
an air of antiquity marks all things <span style="color: #0000FF;">here</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>The<br/>
defaced walls, the low roof that one can easily<br/>
touch, the granite pillars which sustain the shapeless arches, are all blackened by the smoke of the<br/>
wax candles, and scarred and worn by the friction<br/>
of human hands.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the crypt there is a very sacred<br/>
recess round which a crowd presses: a coarse<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
