some overthrown. One like those of Luxor, but<br/>
much higher, remains intact and raises its sharp<br/>
point into the sky; others, less well known in<br/>
their exquisite simplicity, are quite plain and<br/>
straight from base to summit, bearing only in<br/>
relief gigantic lotus flowers, whose long climbing<br/>
stems bloom above in the half light cast by the<br/>
stars. The passage becomes narrower and more<br/>
obscure, and it is necessary sometimes to <span style="color: #0000FF;">grope<br/>
</span>my way. And then again my hands encounter<br/>
the everlasting hieroglyphs carved everywhere,<br/>
and sometimes the legs of a colossus seated on<br/>
its throne. The stones are still slightly warm,<br/>
so fierce has been the heat of the sun during the<br/>
day. And certain of the granites, so hard that<br/>
our steel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chisels </span>could not cut them, have kept<br/>
their polish despite the lapse of centuries, and<br/>
my fingers slip in touching them.<br/>
<br/>
There is now no sound. The music of the<br/>
night birds has ceased. I listen in vain-so<br/>
attentively that I can hear the beating of my<br/>
heart. Not a sound, not even the buzzing<br/>
of a fly. Everything is silent, everything is<br/>
ghostly; and in spite of the persistent warmth<br/>
of the stones the air grows colder and colder,<br/>
and one gets the impression that everything<br/>
here is <span style="color: #0000FF;">frozen-definitely-as </span>in the<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">coldness<br/>
