<span>Evening at Thebes 199<br/>
<br/>
French, German, English; I see them below,<br/>
a lot of pygmy figures, issuing from the hypostyle<br/>
hall, and making their way towards us. Mean<br/>
and pitiful they look in their twentieth-century<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tvavellers</span>' costumes, hurrying along that avenue<br/>
where once defiled so many processions of gods<br/>
and goddesses. And yet this, perhaps, is the<br/>
only occasion on which one of these bands of<br/>
tourists does not seem to me altogether ridiculous. Amongst these groups of unknown people,<br/>
there is none who is not collected and thoughtful,<br/>
or who does not at least pretend to be so; and<br/>
there is some saving quality of grace, even some<br/>
grandeur of humility, in the sentiment which has<br/>
brought them to this town of Amen, and in the<br/>
homage of their silence.<br/>
<br/>
We are so high on this portal that we might<br/>
fancy ourselves upon a tower, and the defaced<br/>
stones of which it is built are immeasurably<br/>
large. Instinctively each one sits with his face<br/>
to the glowing sun, and consequently to the<br/>
outspread distances of the fields and the desert.<br/>
<br/>
Before us, under our feet, an avenue stretches<br/>
away, prolonging towards the fields the pomp of<br/>
the dead <span style="color: #0000FF;">city-an </span>avenue bordered by monstrous<br/>
rams, larger than buffaloes, all crouched on their<br/>
pedestals in two parallel rows in the traditional<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic </span>pose. The avenue terminates beyond at<br/>
a kind of wharf or landing-stage which formerly<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
