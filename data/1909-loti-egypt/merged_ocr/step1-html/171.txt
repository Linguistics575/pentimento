<span>A Charming Luncheon <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">4- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>To be brief, they all mount into their saddles,<br/>
these Cooks and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cookesses</span>, and opening, not<br/>
without a conscious air of majesty, their white<br/>
cotton parasols, take themselves off in the<br/>
direction of the Nile. They disappear and the<br/>
place belongs to us.<br/>
<br/>
When we venture at last to return to the first<br/>
sanctuary, where they had lunched their fill<br/>
in the shade, the guardians are busy clearing<br/>
away the leavings and the dirty paper. And<br/>
they pack the dubious crockery, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>will be<br/>
required for to-morrow's luncheon, into large<br/>
chests on which may be read in large letters of<br/>
glory the names of the veritable sovereigns of<br/>
modern Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>"Thomas Cook & Son (Egypt<br/>
Ltd.)."<br/>
<br/>
All this happily ends with the first hypostyle.<br/>
Nothing <span style="color: #ff0000;">dishonours </span>the halls of the interior,<br/>
where silence has again descended, the vast<br/>
silence of the noon of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
In the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, men<br/>
already marvelled at this temple, as at a relic of<br/>
the most distant and nebulous past. The geographer Strabo wrote in those days: "It is an<br/>
admirable palace built in the fashion of the<br/>
Labyrinth save that it has fewer galleries."<br/>
There are galleries enough however, and one can<br/>
readily lose oneself in its mazy turnings. Seven<br/>
chapels, consecrated to Osiris and to different<br/>
<br/>
