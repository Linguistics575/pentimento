<br/>
</span>in carriages, others on donkeys, they go to<br/>
recruit themselves with the electricity and<br/>
elegance of Luxor, the neighbouring town<br/>
(wines and spirits are paid for as extras, and we<br/>
dress for dinner). And the dust <span style="color: #0000FF;">condescends </span>to<br/>
mark their exodus also by a last cloud of gold<br/>
beneath the palm-trees of the road.<br/>
<br/>
An immediate solemnity succeeds to their<br/>
departure. Above the mud houses of the fellah<br/>
villages rise slender columns of smoke, which are<br/>
of a periwinkle-blue in the midst of the still<br/>
yellow atmosphere. They tell of the humble<br/>
life of these little homesteads, subsisting here,<br/>
where in the backward of the ages were so many<br/>
palaces and splendours.<br/>
<br/>
And the first bayings of the watchdogs<br/>
announce already the vague uneasiness of the<br/>
evenings around the ruins. There is no one <span style="color: #0000FF;">now<br/>
</span>within the mummy-town, which seems all at<br/>
once to have grown larger in the silence. Very<br/>
quickly the violet shadow covers it, all save the<br/>
extreme points of its obelisks, which keep still a<br/>
little of their rose-colour. The feeling comes<br/>
over you that a sovereign mystery has taken<br/>
possession of the town, as if some vague phantom<br/>
things had just passed into it.<br/>
