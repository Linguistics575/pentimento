<br/>
times, have been carefully coloured and gilded.<br/>
As for the columns, always dissimilar, some of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">amaranth-coloured </span>marble, others of dark green,<br/>
others again of red porphyry, with capitals of<br/>
every conceivable style, they are come from far,<br/>
from the night of the ages, from the religious<br/>
struggles of an earlier time and testify to the<br/>
prodigious past which this valley of the Nile,<br/>
narrow as it is, and encompassed by the desert,<br/>
has known. They were formerly perhaps in the<br/>
temples of the pagans, or have known the strange<br/>
faces of the gods of Egypt and of ancient Greece<br/>
and Rome; they have been in the churches of<br/>
the early Christians, or have seen the statues of<br/>
tortured martyrs, and the images of the transfigured Christ, crowned with the Byzantine<br/>
aureole. They have been present at battles, at<br/>
the downfall of kingdoms, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">hecatombs</span>, at sacrileges; and now brought together <span style="color: #0000FF;">promiscuously<br/>
</span>in these mosques, they behold on the walls<br/>
of the sanctuary simply the thousand little<br/>
designs, ideally pure, of that Islam which wishes<br/>
that men when they pray should conceive Allah<br/>
as immaterial, a Spirit without form and without<br/>
feature.<br/>
<br/>
Each one of these mosques has its sainted<br/>
dead, whose name it bears, and who sleeps by its<br/>
side, in an <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjoining </span>mortuary kiosk; some priest<br/>
rendered admirable by his virtues, or perhaps a<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
