<br/>
though it was in the time of Cleopatra and<br/>
Augustus, on a site venerable in the oldest<br/>
antiquity, recalls at first sight some conception<br/>
of the Ramses.<br/>
<br/>
If, however, you examine it more closely, there<br/>
appears, particularly in the thousands of figures<br/>
in bas-relief, a considerable divergence. The<br/>
poses are the same indeed, and so too are the<br/>
traditional gestures. But the exquisite grace of<br/>
line is gone, as well as the hieratic calm of the<br/>
expressions and the smiles. In the Egyptian art<br/>
of the best periods the slender figures are as<br/>
pure as the flowers they hold in their hands;<br/>
their muscles may be indicated in a precise and<br/>
skilful manner, but they remain, for all that,<br/>
immaterial. The god Amen himself, the procreator, drawn often with an absolute crudity,<br/>
would seem chaste compared with the hosts of<br/>
this temple. For here, on the contrary, the<br/>
figures might be those of living people, palpitating and voluptuous, who had posed themselves<br/>
for sport in these consecrated attitudes. The<br/>
throat of the beautiful goddess, her hips, her<br/>
unveiled nakedness, are portrayed with a<br/>
searching and lingering realism; the flesh seems<br/>
almost to quiver. She and her spouse, the<br/>
beautiful Horus, son of Iris, contemplate each<br/>
other there, naked, one before the other, and<br/>
their laughing eyes are intoxicated with love.<br/>
