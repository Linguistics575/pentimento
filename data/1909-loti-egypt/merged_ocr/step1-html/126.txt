<span>96 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
We pass mosques in total darkness and they<br/>
too are silent and white, with a slight bluish<br/>
tint cast on them by the moon. And sometimes,<br/>
between the houses, there are little enclosed<br/>
spaces, like narrow gardens, but which can have<br/>
no possible verdure. And in these gardens<br/>
numbers of little obelisks rise from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sand</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">white </span>obelisks, it is needless to say, for to-night<br/>
we are in the kingdom of absolute whiteness.<br/>
What can they be, these strange little gardens?<br/>
... And the sand, meanwhile, which covers<br/>
the streets with its thick coatings, continues to<br/>
deaden the sound of our progress, out of compliment no doubt to all these watchful things<br/>
that are so silent around us.<br/>
<br/>
At the crossings and in the little squares the<br/>
obelisks become more numerous, erected always<br/>
at either end of a slab of stone that is about the<br/>
length of a man. Their little motionless groups,<br/>
posted as if on the watch, seem so little real in<br/>
their vague whiteness that we feel tempted to<br/>
verify them by touching, and, verily, we should<br/>
not be astonished if our hand passed through<br/>
them as through a ghost. Farther on there is a<br/>
wide expanse without any houses at all, where<br/>
these ubiquitous little obelisks abound in the<br/>
sand like ears of <span style="color: #0000FF;">corn </span>in a field. There is<br/>
now no further room for illusion. We are<br/>
in a cemetery, and have been passing in the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
