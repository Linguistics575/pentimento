ing, seems to be without end. After passing,<br/>
in turn, the papyri, the enamels, the vases that<br/>
contain human entrails, we reach the mummies<br/>
of the sacred beasts<span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eats</span>, ibises, dogs, hawks,<br/>
all with their mummy cloths and sarcophagi;<br/>
and monkeys, too, that remain grotesque even<br/>
in death. Then commence the human masks,<br/>
and, upright in glass-fronted cupboards, the<br/>
mummy cases in which the body, swathed in<br/>
its mummy cloths, was moulded, and which<br/>
reproduced, more or less enlarged, the figure of<br/>
the deceased. Quite a lot of courtesans of the<br/>
Greco-Roman epoch, moulded in paste in this<br/>
wise after death and crowned with roses, smile<br/>
at us provokingly from behind their windows.<br/>
Masks of the colour of dead flesh alternate with<br/>
others of gold which gleam as the light of our<br/>
lantern plays upon them momentarily in our<br/>
rapid passage. Their eyes are always too large,<br/>
the eyelids too wide open and the dilated pupils<br/>
seem to stare at us with alarm. Amongst these<br/>
mummy cases and these coffin lids fashioned in<br/>
the shape of the human figure, there are some<br/>
that seem to have been made for giants; the<br/>
head especially, beneath its cumbrous head-dress<br/>
the head stuffed as it were between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hunchback </span>shoulders, looks enormous, out of all<br/>
proportion to the body which, towards the feet,<br/>
narrows like a scabbard.<br/>
