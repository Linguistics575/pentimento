<br/>
is so hot amongst these mummies? It seems as<br/>
if there were fires burning in some oven close by.<br/>
And above all there is a want of air. Perhaps<br/>
the corridors, after our passage, have contracted, as happens sometimes in the anguish<br/>
of dreams. Perhaps the long fissure by which<br/>
we have crawled hither, perhaps it has closed in<br/>
upon us....<br/>
<br/>
But at length the cries of alarm are heard and<br/>
the light is turned on again. The three corpses<br/>
have not profited by the unguarded moments to<br/>
attempt any aggressive movement. Their positions, their expressions have not <span style="color: #ff0000;">changed</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
</span>the queen calm and beautiful as ever; the<br/>
man eating still the corner of his rags to stifle<br/>
the mad laughter of thirty-three centuries.<br/>

The Bedouin has now returned, breathless<br/>
from his journey. He urges us to come to see<br/>
the king before the electric light is again extinguished, and this time for good and all. Behold<br/>
us now at the end of the hall, on the edge of<br/>
a dark crypt, leaning over and peering within.<br/>
It is a place oval in form, with a vault of a<br/>
funereal black, relieved by frescoes, either white<br/>
or of the colour of ashes. They represent, these<br/>
frescoes, a whole new register of gods and<br/>
demons, some slim and sheathed narrowly like<br/>
mummies, others with big heads and big bellies<br/>
like hippopotami. Placed on the ground and<br/>
