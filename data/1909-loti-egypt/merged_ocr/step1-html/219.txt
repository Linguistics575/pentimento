<span>Modern Luxor I <span style="color: #ff0000;">8 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5<br/>
<br/>
</span>hieroglyphs beneath.... This temple, in fact,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">almost </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">indestructible </span>by reason of its massiveness,<br/>
has passed through the hands of diverse masters.<br/>
Its antiquity was already legendary in the time<br/>
of Alexander the Great, on whose behalf a chapel<br/>
was added to it; and later on, in the first ages<br/>
of Christianity, a corner of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins </span>was turned<br/>
into a cathedral. The tourists begin to depart,<br/>
for the lunch bell calls them to the neighbouring<br/>
tables <span style="color: #0000FF;">d'Mte</span>; and while I wait till they shall be<br/>
gone, I occupy myself in following the bas-reliefs<br/>
which are displayed for a length of more than<br/>
a hundred yards along the base of the walls. It<br/>
is one long row of people moving in their<br/>
thousands all in the same direction-the ritual<br/>
procession of the God Amen. With the care<br/>
which characterised the Egyptians to draw<br/>
everything from life so as to render it eternal,<br/>
there are represented here the smallest details<br/>
of a day of festival three or four thousand years<br/>
ago. And how like it is to a holiday of the<br/>
people of to-day! Along the route of the procession are ranged jugglers and sellers of drinks<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruits</span>, and negro acrobats who walk on their<br/>
hands and twist themselves into all kinds of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">contortions</span>. But the procession itself was evidently of a magnificence such as we no longer<br/>
know. The number of musicians and priests, of<br/>
corporations, of emblems and banners, is quite<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
