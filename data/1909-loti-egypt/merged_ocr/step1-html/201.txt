<span>Temple of the Goddess of Love 167<br/>
<br/>
we have nothing resembling such a chaos of dead<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays the sanctuary is reached through<br/>
a large cutting in this hill of ruins; incredible<br/>
heaps of bricks and broken pottery enclose it on<br/>
all sides like a jealous rampart. Until recently<br/>
indeed they covered it almost to its roof. From<br/>
the very first its appearance is <span style="color: #0000FF;">disconcerting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>it<br/>
is so grand, so austere and gloomy. A strange<br/>
dwelling, to be sure, for the Goddess of Love<br/>

the Prince of Darkness and of Death. A severe<br/>
doorway, built of gigantic stones and surmounted<br/>
by a winged disc, opens on to an asylum of<br/>
religious mystery, on to depths where massive<br/>
columns disappear in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">da1knessdof </span>deep<br/>

Immediately on entering there is a coolness<br/>
and a resonance as of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sepulehre</span>. First, the<br/>
pronaos, where we still see clearly, between<br/>
pillars carved with hieroglyphs. Were it not<br/>
for the large human faces which serve for the<br/>
capitals of the columns, and are the image of the<br/>
lovely Hathor, the goddess of the place, this<br/>
temple of the decadent epoch would scarcely<br/>
differ from those built in this country two thousand years before. It has the same square<br/>
massiveness.<br/>
<br/>
And in the dark blue ceilings there are the<br/>
