nocturnal hunt for human flesh. Pitch darkness<br/>
reigns within and I have to grope my way.<br/>
Quickly I light a match. Yes, there she is<br/>
indeed, alone and upright, almost part of the end<br/>
wall, on which my little light makes the horrible<br/>
shadow of her head dance. The match goes out<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-irreverently </span>I light many more under her chin,<br/>
under that heavy, man-eating jaw. In very<br/>
sooth, she is terrifying. Of black granite-like<br/>
her sisters, seated on the margin of the mournful<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lake-but </span>much taller than they, from six to eight<br/>
feet in height, she has a woman's body, exquisitely slim and young, with the breasts of a<br/>
virgin. Very chaste in attitude, she holds in<br/>
her hand a long-stemmed lotus flower, but by a<br/>
contrast that <span style="color: #ff0000;">nonplusses </span>and paralyses you the<br/>
delicate shoulders support the monstrosity of a<br/>
huge lioness' head. The lappets of her bonnet<br/>
fall on either side of her ears almost down to her<br/>
breast, and surmounting the bonnet, by way of<br/>
addition to the mysterious pomp, is a large moon<br/>
disc. Her dead stare gives to the ferocity of her<br/>
visage something unreasoning and fatal; an<br/>
irresponsible ogress, without pity as without<br/>
pleasure, devouring after the manner of Nature<br/>
and of Time. And it was so perhaps that she<br/>
was understood by the initiated of ancient<br/>
Egypt, who symbolised everything for the<br/>
people in the figures of gods<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
