<br/>
And now beyond two menhirs, as it were, become gradually distinct. Of the same height<br/>
and shape, alike indeed in every respect, they<br/>
rise side by side in the clear distance in the<br/>
midst of these green plains, which recall so well<br/>
our fields of France. They wear the headgear<br/>
of the Sphinx, and are gigantic human forms<br/>
seated on <span style="color: #0000FF;">thrones-the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eolossal </span>statues of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mem..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">non</span>. We recognise them at once, for the picturemakers of succeeding ages have popularised<br/>
their aspect, as in the case of the pyramids.<br/>
What is strange is that they should stand there so<br/>
simply in the midst of these fields of growing<br/>
corn, which reach to their very feet, and be surrounded by these humble birds we know so well,<br/>
who sing without ceremony on their shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
They do not seem to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">scandalised </span>even at<br/>
seeing now, passing quite close to them, the trucks<br/>
of a playful little railway belonging to a local<br/>
industry, that are laden with sugar-canes and<br/>
gourds.<br/>
<br/>
The chain of Libya, during the last hour, has<br/>
been growing gradually larger against the profound and excessively blue sky. And now that it<br/>
rises up quite near to us, overheated, and as it were<br/>
incandescent, under this ten <span style="color: #0000FF;">o'elock </span>sun, we begin<br/>
to see on all sides, in front of the first rocky spurs<br/>
of the mountains, the debris of palaces, <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>, staircases and pylons. Headless giants,<br/>
<br/>
