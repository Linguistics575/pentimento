<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">78 </span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
But beyond, in front of us, quite a different<br/>
world is gradually revealed. Its aspect assumes<br/>
the importance of a menace from the unknown;<br/>
it awes us like an apparition of chaos, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>universal<br/>
death<span style="color: #0000FF;">...</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>It is the desert, the conquering<br/>
desert, in the midst of which inhabited <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>,<br/>
the green valleys of the Nile, trace merely a<br/>
narrow ribbon. And here, more than elsewhere,<br/>
the sight of this sovereign desert rising up before<br/>
us is startling and thrilling, so high up it seems<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>and we so low in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edenlike </span>valley shaded <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span>the palms. With its yellow hues, its livid <span style="color: #0000FF;">marblings</span>, and its sands which make it look somehow as if it lacked consistency, it rises on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>whole horizon like a kind of soft wall or a great<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fearsome </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eloud</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-or </span>rather, like a long <span style="color: #0000FF;">cataclysmic<br/>
</span>wave, which does not move indeed, but which, <span style="color: #0000FF;">if<br/>
</span>it did, would overwhelm and swallow everything.<br/>
It is the Memphite <span style="color: #ff0000;">deeert</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>place, that is to<br/>
say, such as does not exist elsewhere on earth; a<br/>
fabulous <span style="color: #ff0000;">neeroptolis</span>, in which men of <span style="color: #0000FF;">earlier </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">times</span>,<br/>
heaped up <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>some three thousand years the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">embalmed </span>bodies of their dead, exaggerating, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
</span>time went on, the foolish grandeur of their tombs.<br/>
Now, above the sand which looks like the front<br/>
of some great tidal wave arrested in its progress,<br/>
we <span style="color: #0000FF;">see </span>on all sides, and far into the distance,<br/>
triangles of superhuman proportions which were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>the tombs of mummies; pyramids, still<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
