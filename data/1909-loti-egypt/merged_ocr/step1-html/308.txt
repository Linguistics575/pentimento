(Here we combine our efforts to illuminate<br/>
the said permit by the light of a match.)<br/>

"Good, I will go with you."<br/>
<br/>
"No. I beg of you."<br/>
<br/>
"Yes; I had better. Where are you<br/>
going? "<br/>
<br/>
"Beyond, to the temple of that lady-you<br/>
know, who is great and powerful and has a face<br/>
like a lioness."<br/>
<br/>
"Ah!... Yes, I think I understand that<br/>
you would prefer to go alone." (Here the intonation becomes infantine.) "But you are a<br/>
kind gentleman and will not forget the poor<br/>
Bedouin all the same."<br/>
<br/>
He goes his way. On leaving the palaces I<br/>
have still to traverse an extent of uncultivated<br/>
country, where a veritable cold seizes me.<br/>
Above my head no longer the heavy suspended<br/>
stones, but the far-off expanse of the blue night<br/>
sky-where are shining now myriads upon<br/>
myriads of stars. For the Thebans of old this<br/>
beautiful vault, scintillating always with its<br/>
powder of diamonds, shed no doubt only serenity<br/>
upon their souls. But for us, who know, alas /<br/>
it is on the contrary the field of the great fear,<br/>
which, out of pity, it would have been better if<br/>
we had never been able to see; the incommensurable black void, where the worlds in<br/>
their frenzied whirling <span style="color: #ff0000;">precipitatewthemselves<br/>
