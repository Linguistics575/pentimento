<span>Temple of the Goddess of Love 171<br/>
<br/>
Around the holy of holies is a number of halls,<br/>
in deep shadow and massive as so many fortresses. They were used formerly for mysterious<br/>
and complicated rites, and in them, as everywhere else, there is no corner of the wall but is<br/>
overloaded with figures and hieroglyphs. Bats<br/>
are asleep in the blue ceilings, where the winged<br/>
discs, painted in fresco, look like flights of birds;<br/>
and the hornets of the neighbouring fields have<br/>
built their nests there in hundreds, so that they<br/>
hang like stalactites.<br/>
<br/>
Several staircases lead to the vast terraces<br/>
formed by the great roofs of the temple--<span style="color: #0000FF;">staircases </span>narrow, stifling and dimly lighted by loopholes that reveal the heart-breaking thickness of<br/>
the walls. And here again are the inevitable<br/>
rows of figures, carved on all the walls, in the<br/>
same familiar attitudes; they mount with us as<br/>
we ascend, making all the time the self-same<br/>
signs one to another.<br/>
<br/>
As we emerge on to the roofs, bathed now in<br/>
Egyptian sunlight and swept by a cold and bitter<br/>
wind, we are greeted by a noise as of an aviary.<br/>
It is the kingdom of the sparrows, who have<br/>
built their nests in thousands in this temple of<br/>
the complaisant goddess. They twitter now all<br/>
together and with all their might out of very joy<br/>
of living. It is an esplanade, this roof-a solitude<br/>
paved with gigantic flagstones. From it we see,<br/>
<br/>
