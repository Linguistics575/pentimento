<span>A Centre of Islam 73<br/>
<br/>
vain striving, and to die entranced by radiant<br/>
hopes, the Orientals are the only wise men. But<br/>
now that greedy nations beset them on all sides<br/>
their dreaming is no longer possible. They must<br/>
awake, alas.<br/>
<br/>
They must awake; and already the awakening<br/>
is at hand. Here, in Egypt, where the need is<br/>
felt to change so many things, it is proposed, too,<br/>
to reform the old university of Al-Azhar, one of<br/>
the chief centres of Islam. One thinks of it with<br/>
a kind of fear, knowing what danger there is in<br/>
laying hands upon institutions which have lasted<br/>
for a thousand years. Reform, however, has, in<br/>
principle, been decided upon. New knowledge,<br/>
brought from the West, is penetrating into the<br/>
tabernacle of the Fatimites. Has not the Prophet<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">said</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>"Co; seek knowledge far and wide, if<br/>
needs be even into China "? What will come<br/>
of it? Who can tell? But this, at least, is<br/>
certain: that in the dazzling hours of noon, or<br/>
in the golden hours of evening, when the crowd<br/>
of these modernised students spreads itself over<br/>
the vast courtyard, overlooked by its countless<br/>
minarets, there will no longer be seen in their<br/>
eyes the mystic light of to-day; and it will no<br/>
longer be the old unshakable faith, nor the lofty<br/>
and serene indifference, 1101' the profound peace,<br/>
that these messengers will carry to the ends of<br/>
the Mussulman earth....<br/>
