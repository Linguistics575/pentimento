<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">44 </span>Egypt<br/>
there through some stray window gleams a small<br/>
patch of luminous blue sky, lit by the stars<br/>
which for the good folk outside lend transparency to the night; but here, none the less,<br/>
the place is filled with a solemn gloom, and we<br/>
lower our voices, remembering perhaps the dead<br/>
that fill the glass cases in the halls above.<br/>
And these things which line the walls on<br/>
either side of us as we pass also seem to be<br/>
in the nature of receptacles for the dead. For<br/>
the most part they are <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>of granite,<br/>
proud and indestructible: some of them, in<br/>
the shape of gigantic boxes, are laid out in line<br/>
on pedestals; others, in the form of mummies,<br/>
stand upright against the walls and display<br/>
enormous faces, surmounted <span style="color: #ff0000;">byequally </span>enormous<br/>
head-dresses. Assembled there they look like<br/>
a lot of malformed giants, with oversized heads<br/>
sunk curiously in their shoulders. There are,<br/>
besides, some that are merely statues, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eolossal<br/>
</span>figures that have never held a corpse in their<br/>
interiors; these all wear a strange, scarcely perceptible smile; in their huge sphinxlike headgear they reach nearly to the ceiling and their<br/>
set stare passes high above our heads. And<br/>
there are others that are not larger than ourselves, some even quite little, with the stature<br/>
of gnomes. And, every now and then, at some<br/>
sudden turning, we encounter a pair of eyes of<br/>
<br/>
