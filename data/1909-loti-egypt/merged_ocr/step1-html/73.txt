<span>The Hall of the Mummies <span style="color: #0000FF;">47<br/>
<br/>
</span>beasts, even to beasts that crawl. And, after<br/>
having wandered about the halls, they end by<br/>
assembling for their nocturnal conferences on the<br/>
roofs.<br/>
<br/>
We next ascend a staircase of monumental<br/>
proportions, empty in its whole extent, where<br/>
we are delivered for a little while from the<br/>
obsession of those rigid figures, from the stares<br/>
and smiles of the good people in white stone and<br/>
black granite who throng the galleries and vestibules on the ground floor. None of them, to be<br/>
sure, will follow us; but all the same they guard<br/>
in force and perplex with their shadows the only<br/>
way by which we can retreat, if the formidable<br/>
hosts above have in store for us too sinister a<br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
He to whose courtesy I owe the relaxation of<br/>
the orders of the night is the illustrious savant<br/>
to whose care has been entrusted the direction of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">excavations </span>in Egyptian soil; he is also the<br/>
<br/>
comptroller of this vast museum, and it is he<br/>
. himself who has kindly consented <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>act as my<br/>
guide to-night through its mazy labyrinth.<br/>
<br/>
Across the silent halls above we now proceed<br/>
straight towards those of whom I have demanded<br/>
this nocturnal audience.<br/>
<br/>
To-night the succession of these rooms, filled<br/>
with glass cases, which cover more than four<br/>
hundred yards along the four sides of the build<br/>
