<span>Thebes by Night <span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>come to the great avenue of the palaces of<br/>
Amen.<br/>
<br/>
We have nothing on earth in the least degree<br/>
comparable to this avenue, which passive multitudes took nearly three thousand years to construct, expending, century after century, their<br/>
innumerable energies in carrying these stones,<br/>
which our machines now could not move. And<br/>
the objective was always the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>to prolong<br/>
indefinitely the perspectives of pylons, colossi<br/>
and obelisks, continuing always this same artery<br/>
of temples and palaces in the direction of the<br/>
old Nile-while the latter, on the contrary,<br/>
receded slowly, from century to century, towards<br/>
Libya. It is here, and especially at night, that<br/>
you suffer the feeling of having been shrunken<br/>
to the size of a pygmy. All round you rise monoliths mighty as rocks. You have to take twenty<br/>
paces to pass the base of a single one of them.<br/>
They are placed quite close together, too close,<br/>
it seems, in view of their enormity and mass.<br/>
There is not enough air between them, and the<br/>
closeness of their juxtaposition <span style="color: #0000FF;">disconcerts </span>you<br/>
more, perhaps, even than their massiveness.<br/>
<br/>
The avenue which I have followed in an easterly<br/>
direction abuts on as disconcerting a chaos of<br/>
granite as exists in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes-the </span>hall of the feasts<br/>
of Thothmes III. What kind of feasts were they,<br/>
that this king gave here, in this forest of <span style="color: #0000FF;">thick-set<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
