its minarets and its palm-trees, might as well<br/>
not exist. The famous temple and the forest<br/>
of heavy <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osiridean </span>columns admire themselves<br/>
in vain in the waters of the river. It is the end<br/>
of Luxor.<br/>
<br/>
And what a crowd of people is <span style="color: #0000FF;">here</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>While,<br/>
on the contrary, the opposite bank seems so<br/>
absolutely desertlike, with its stretches of golden<br/>
sand and, on the horizon, its mountains of the<br/>
colour of glowing embers, which, as we know,<br/>
are full of mummies.<br/>
<br/>
Poor Luxor! Along the banks is a row of<br/>
tourist boats, a sort of two or three <span style="color: #ff0000;">storeyed<br/>
</span>barracks, which nowadays infest the Nile from<br/>
Cairo to the Cataracts. Their whistlings and the<br/>
vibration of their dynamos make an intolerable<br/>
noise. How shall I find a quiet place for my<br/>
dahabiya, where the functionaries of Messrs Cook<br/>
will not come to disturb <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span>?<br/>
<br/>
We can now see nothing of the palaces of<br/>
Thebes, whither I am to repair in the evening<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>We are farther from them than we were last<br/>
night. The apparition during our <span style="color: #0000FF;">morning's<br/>
</span>journey had slowly receded in the plains flooded<br/>
by sunlight. And then the Winter Palace and<br/>
the new boats shut out the view.<br/>
<br/>
But this modern quay of Luxor, where I <span style="color: #0000FF;">disembark </span>at ten <span style="color: #0000FF;">o'clock </span>in the morning in clear and<br/>
radiant sunshine, is not without its amusing side.<br/>
<br/>
