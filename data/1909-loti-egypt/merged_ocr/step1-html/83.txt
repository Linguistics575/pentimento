</span>of it." There is something confusing in the<br/>
thought that the menace of this terrible expression, and this appearance of ill-restrained ferocity<br/>
had endured for some hundreds of years before<br/>
the commencement of our era, and endured to<br/>
no purpose in the secret darkness of a closed<br/>
coffin at the bottom of some doorless vault.<br/>
Now that we are about to retire, what will<br/>
happen here, with the complicity of silence, in<br/>
the darkest hours of the night? Will they remain inert and rigid, all these embalmed bodies,<br/>
once left to themselves, who pretended to be so<br/>
quiet because we were there? What exchanges<br/>
of old human fluid will recommence, as who can<br/>
doubt they do each night between one coffin and<br/>
another. Formerly these kings and queens, in<br/>
their anxiety as to the future of their mummy,<br/>
had <span style="color: #ff0000;">foreseen </span>violation, pillage and scattering<br/>
amongst the sands of the desert, but never <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l<br/>
</span>that they would be reunited one day, almost all<br/>
unveiled, so near to one another under panes of<br/>
glass. Those who governed Egypt in the lost<br/>
centuries and were never known except by<br/>
history, by the papyri inscribed with hieroglyphics, brought thus together, how many things<br/>
will they have to say to one another, how many<br/>
ardent questions to ask about their loves, about<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">crimes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>As soon as we shall have departed,<br/>
nay, as soon as our lantern, at the end of the<br/>
