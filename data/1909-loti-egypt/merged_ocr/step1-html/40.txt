of the tourists of the agencies, and we meet<br/>
again our friends of the mosque, who have preceded us hither-the gentlemen with the loud<br/>
voices, the bellowing guide and the cackling<br/>
lady. Some soldiers are standing there too,<br/>
smoking their pipes contemplatively. But in<br/>

A very <span style="color: #0000FF;">fairyland-but </span>a fairyland quite different from that of Stamboul. For whereas the<br/>
latter is ranged like a great amphitheatre above<br/>
the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmora, here<br/>
the vast town is spread out simply, in a plain<br/>
surrounded by the solitude of the desert and<br/>
dominated by chaotic rocks. Thousands of<br/>
minarets rise up on every side like ears of corn<br/>
in a field; far away in the distance one can see<br/>
their innumerable slender points-but instead<br/>
of being simply, as at Stamboul, so many white<br/>
spires, they are here complicated by arabesques,<br/>
by galleries, clock-towers and little columns,<br/>
and seem to have borrowed the reddish colour<br/>
of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>roofs tell of a region which formerly<br/>
was without rain. The innumerable palm-trees<br/>
of the gardens, above this ocean of mosques and<br/>
houses, sway their plumes in the wind, bewildered as it were by these clouds laden with<br/>
