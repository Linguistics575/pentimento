<span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">64 </span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
those of some "Promised Land," seem to be<br/>
bounded far away, on left and right, by two<br/>
parallel stone walls, two chains of rose-coloured<br/>
mountains, whose aspect is obviously desertlike.<br/>
Besides, amongst the numerous animals that are<br/>
familiar, there are camels, feeding their strange<br/>
nurslings that look like four-legged ostriches.<br/>
And finally some peasants appear beyond in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornfields</span>; they are veiled in long black<br/>
draperies. It is the East then, an African land,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>some oasis of Arabia?<br/>
<br/>
The sun at this moment is hidden from us<br/>
by a band of clouds, that stretches, right above<br/>
our head, from one end of the sky to the other,<br/>
like a long skein of white wool. It is alone in<br/>
the blue void, and seems to make more peaceful,<br/>
and even a little mysterious, the wonderful light<br/>
of the fields we <span style="color: #0000FF;">traverse-these </span>fields intoxicated<br/>
with life and vibrant with the music of birds;<br/>
while, by contrast, the distant landscape, unshaded by clouds, is resplendent with a more<br/>
incisive clearness and the desert beyond seems<br/>
deluged with rays.<br/>
<br/>
The pathway that we have been following,<br/>
ill defined as it is in the grassy fields, leads us at<br/>
length under a large ruinous <span style="color: #ff0000;">portieo</span>---a relic of<br/>
goodness knows what olden <span style="color: #0000FF;">days-which </span>still<br/>
rises here, quite isolated, altogether strange and<br/>
unexpected, in the midst of the green expanse<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
