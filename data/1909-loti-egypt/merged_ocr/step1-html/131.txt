<span>The Outskirts of Cairo IOI<br/>

withers and crumbles them. And all around are<br/>
the signs of ruin. Tottering cupolas show us<br/>
irreparable cracks; the halves of broken arches<br/>
are outlined to-night in shadow against the<br/>
mother-of-pearl light of the sky, and debris of<br/>
sculptured stones are strewn about. But nevertheless these tombs, that are well-nigh <span style="color: #0000FF;">accursed</span>,<br/>
still stir in us a vague sense of alarm-particularly<br/>
those in the distance, which rise up like silhouettes<br/>
of misshapen giants in enormous hats-dark on<br/>
the white sheet of sand-and stand there in<br/>
groups, or scattered in confusion, at the entrance<br/>
to the vast empty regions beyond.<br/>
<br/>
We had chosen a time when the light was<br/>
doubtful in order that we might avoid the<br/>
tourists, but as we approach the <span style="color: #ff0000;">funeraldwelling </span>of Sultan Barkuk, the assassin, we see, issuing<br/>
from it, a whole band, some twenty in a line, who<br/>
emerge from the darkness of the abandoned walls,<br/>
each trotting on his little donkey and each<br/>
followed by the inevitable Bedouin driver, who<br/>
taps with his stick upon the rump of the beast.<br/>
They are returning to Cairo, their visit ended,<br/>
and exchange in a loud voice, from one ass to<br/>
another, more or less inept impressions in various<br/>
European languages.... And look! there is<br/>
even amongst them the almost proverbial belated<br/>
dame who, for private reasons of her own, follows<br/>
