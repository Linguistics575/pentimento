<span>46 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
venerable carcasses of kings and queens, soaked<br/>
as they are in natron and oils, crackling like so<br/>
many boxes of matches. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>on account<br/>
of this danger indeed that the seals are put upon<br/>
the doors at nightfall, and that it needs a special<br/>
favour to be allowed to penetrate into this place<br/>
at night with a lantern.<br/>
<br/>
In the daytime this "Museum of Egyptian<br/>
Antiquities "is as vulgar a thing as you can<br/>
conceive, filled though it is with priceless<br/>
treasures. It is the most pompous, the most<br/>
outrageous of those buildings, of no style at all,<br/>
by which each year the New Cairo is enriched;<br/>
open to all who care to gaze at close quarters, in<br/>
a light that is almost brutal, upon these august<br/>
dead, who fondly thought that they had hidden<br/>
themselves for ever.<br/>
<br/>
But at night <span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">... </span>Ah! at night when all the<br/>
doors are closed, it is the palace of nightmare<br/>
and of fear. At night, so say the Arab guardians,<br/>
who would not enter it at the price of gold-no,<br/>
not even after offering up a prayer-at night,<br/>
horrible "forms "escape, not only from the embalmed bodies that sleep in the glass cases above,<br/>
but also from the great statues, from the papyri,<br/>
and the thousand and one things that, at the<br/>
bottom of the tombs, have long been impregnated<br/>
with human essence. And these "forms "are<br/>
like unto dead bodies, and sometimes to strange<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
