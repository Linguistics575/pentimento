<span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-and </span>these expiring hieroglyphics were being<br/>
inscribed, the confused primitive theogonies had<br/>
almost reached their end and the days of the<br/>
Goddess of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Joy </span>were numbered. There had<br/>
been conceived in <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">udaea </span>symbols more lofty and<br/>
more pure, which were to rule a great part of the<br/>
world for two thousand years-afterwards, alas,<br/>
to decline in their turn; and men were about<br/>
to throw themselves passionately into renunciation, <span style="color: #0000FF;">asceticism </span>and fraternal pity.<br/>
<br/>
How strange it is to say! Even while the<br/>
sculptor was carving this archaic bas-relief, and<br/>
was using, for the engraving of its name, <span style="color: #0000FF;">characters </span>that dated back to the night of the ages,<br/>
there were already Christians assembled in the<br/>
catacombs at Rome and dying in ecstasy in the<br/>
arena <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
