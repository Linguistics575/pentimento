</span>And, moreover, in the adjoining desert, some<br/>
three or four thousand years ago, the ancient<br/>
history of the world had been written by the<br/>
Pharaohs in immortal <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic-well-nigh<br/>
</span>everywhere, on the polished sides of the strange<br/>
blocks of blue and red granite that lie scattered<br/>
about the sands and look now like the forms of<br/>
antediluvian monsters.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but it was necessary that all this should<br/>
be <span style="color: #0000FF;">co-ordinated</span>, focused as it were, and above<br/>
all rendered accessible to the delicate travellers<br/>
of the Agencies. And to-day we have the<br/>
pleasure of announcing that, from December<br/>
to March, Assouan (for that is the name of the<br/>
fortunate locality) has <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>season "as fashionable<br/>
as those of Ostend or Spa.<br/>
<br/>
In approaching it, the huge hotels erected on<br/>
all sides-even on the islets of the old <span style="color: #0000FF;">river</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">charm </span>the eye of the traveller, greeting him<br/>
with their welcoming signs, which can be seen a<br/>
league away. True, they have been somewhat<br/>
hastily constructed, of mud and plaster, but<br/>
they recall none the less those gracious palaces<br/>
with which the Compagnie des Wagon-Lits has<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lowered </span>the world. And how negligible now, how<br/>
dwarfed by the height of their <span style="color: #ff0000;">fagades</span>, is the poor<br/>
little town of olden times, with its little houses,<br/>
whitened with chalk, and its baby minaret.<br/>
