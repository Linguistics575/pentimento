<span>56 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
There she is indeed, the dishevelled vampire,<br/>
in her place right enough, stretched at full<br/>
length, but looking always as if she were about<br/>
to leap up; and straightway I meet the sidelong<br/>
glance of her enamelled pupils, shining out of<br/>
half-closed eyelids, with lashes that are still<br/>
almost perfect. Oh! the terrifying person!<br/>
Not that she is ugly, on the contrary we can see<br/>
that she was rather pretty and was mummied<br/>
young. What distinguishes her from the others<br/>
is her air of thwarted anger, of fury, as it were,<br/>
at being dead. The embalmers have coloured<br/>
her very religiously, but the pink, under the<br/>
action of the salts of the skin, has become decomposed here and there and given place to a<br/>
number of green spots. Her naked shoulders,<br/>
the height of the arms above the rags which<br/>
were once her splendid shroud, have still a<br/>
certain sleek roundness, but they, too, are<br/>
stained with greenish and black splotches,<br/>
such as may be seen on the skins of snakes.<br/>
Assuredly no corpse, either here or elsewhere,<br/>
has ever preserved such an expression of intense<br/>
life, of ironical, implacable ferocity. Her mouth<br/>
is twisted in a little smile of defiance; her<br/>
nostrils pinched like those of a ghoul on the<br/>
scent of blood, and her eyes seem to say to each<br/>
one who approaches: "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Y </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">es</span>, I am laid in my<br/>
coffin; but you will very soon see I can get out<br/>
<br/>
