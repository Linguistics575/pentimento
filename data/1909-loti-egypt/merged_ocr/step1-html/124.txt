<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">94 </span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
vast desolations of Arabia. The desert; and,<br/>
even if we had not known that it was awaiting<br/>
us, we should have recognised it by its <span style="color: #0000FF;">indescribable </span>quality of harshness and uniqueness<br/>
which, in spite of the darkness, cannot be<br/>
mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
But the night after all is not so black. It<br/>
only seemed so, at the first moment, by contrast with the glaring illumination of the street.<br/>
In reality it is transparent and blue. A halfmoon, high up in the heavens, and veiled by<br/>
a diaphanous mist, shines gently, and as it is<br/>
an Egyptian moon, more subtle than ours, it<br/>
leaves to things a little of their colour. We can<br/>
see now, as well as feel, this desert, which has<br/>
opened and imposed its silence upon us. Before<br/>
us is the paleness of its sands and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">reddishbrown </span>of its dead rocks. Verily, in no country<br/>
but Egypt are there such rapid surprises: to<br/>
issue from a street flanked by shops and stalls<br/>
and, without transition, to find this!...<br/>
<br/>
Our horses have, inevitably, to slacken speed<br/>
as the wheels of our carriage sink into the<br/>
sand. Around us still are some stray ramblers,<br/>
who presently assume the air of ghosts, with<br/>
their long black <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>white draperies, and noiseless<br/>
tread. And then, not a soul; nothing but the<br/>
sand and the moon.<br/>
<br/>
But now almost at once, after the short <span style="color: #0000FF;">inter<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
