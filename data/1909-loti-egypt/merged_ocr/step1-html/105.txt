<br/>
upright, all of them, on their sinister pedestal<br/>
of sand. Some are comparatively near; others<br/>
almost <span style="color: #ff0000;">last </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">background </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">solitude</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>-and perhaps more awesome in that they are<br/>
merely outlined in grey, high up <span style="color: #0000FF;">among </span>the<br/>
clouds.<br/>
<br/>
The little <span style="color: #0000FF;">carriages </span>that have brought us to the<br/>
necropolis of Memphis, through the interminable<br/>
forest of <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-tree-s</span>, had their wheels fitted with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>pattens for their journey over the sand.<br/>
<br/>
Now, arrived at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot </span>of the fearsome<br/>
region, we commence to climb a hill where all<br/>
at once the trot of our horses ceases to be heard<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">moving </span>felting of the soil <span style="color: #0000FF;">establishes </span>a sudden<br/>
silence around us, as indeed is always the ease<br/>
when we reach these sands. It seems as if it<br/>
were a silence of respect which the desert itself<br/>
imposes.<br/>
<br/>
The valley of life sinks and fades behind <span style="color: #0000FF;">us</span>,<br/>
until <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>last it disappears, hidden by a line of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sandhills-the </span>first <span style="color: #0000FF;">wave</span>, as one <span style="color: #0000FF;">might </span>say, of<br/>
this waterless <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>we are now mounted into<br/>
the kingdom of the dead, swept at this moment<br/>
by a withering<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">icy </span>wind, which from<br/>
below one would not have expected.<br/>
<br/>
This desert of Memphis has not yet been profaned by hotels or motor roads, such as we have<br/>
seen in the "little desert "of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sphinx-whose<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
