<span>In the Tombs of the Apis <span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>the frescoed portraits which used to adorn them,<br/>
nor of their multicoloured coatings, now that<br/>
they have taken on the same dead colour as the<br/>
desert, they look like the huge bones of giant<br/>
fossils, that have long outlasted their other contemporaries on earth. Beneath the ground, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, the case is different; there, still remain the<br/>
bodies of men, and even of eats and birds, who<br/>
with their own eyes saw these vast structures<br/>
building, and who sleep intact, swathed in bandages, in the darkness of their tunnels. <span style="color: #ff0000;">We </span>know,<br/>
for we have penetrated there before, what things<br/>
are hidden in the womb of this old desert, on<br/>
which the yellow shroud of the sand grows<br/>
thicker and thicker as the centuries pass. The<br/>
whole deep rock has been perforated patiently<br/>
to make hypogea and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulchral </span>chambers, great<br/>
and small, and veritable palaces for the dead,<br/>
adorned with innumerable painted figures<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>And<br/>
though now, for some two thousand years, men<br/>
have set themselves furiously to exhume the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>and the treasures that are buried here,<br/>
the subterranean reserves are not yet exhausted.<br/>
There still remain, no doubt, pleiads of undisturbed sleepers, who will never be discovered.<br/>
As we advance the wind grows stronger and<br/>
colder beneath a sky that becomes increasingly<br/>
cloudy, and the sand is flying on all sides. The<br/>
<br/>
sand is the undisputed sovereign of this <span style="color: #ff0000;">necroF<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
