hang it, a little of the desert solitude. And so<br/>
the eye can see from far off and from all sides<br/>
the mosque of Mehemet Ali, with the flattened<br/>
domes of its cupolas, its pointed minarets, its<br/>
general aspect so entirely Turkish, perched high<br/>
up, with a certain unexpectedness, above the<br/>
Arab town which it dominates. The prince<br/>
who sleeps there wished that it should resemble<br/>
the mosques of his fatherland, and it looks as if<br/>
it had been transported bodily from Stamboul.<br/>
A short trot brings us up to the lower gate<br/>
of the old fortress; and, by a natural effect, as<br/>
we ascend, all Cairo, which is near there, seems<br/>
to rise with us: not yet indeed the endless<br/>
multitude of its houses; but at first only the<br/>
thousands of its minarets, which in a few seconds<br/>
point their high towers into the mournful sky,<br/>
and suggest at once that an immense town is<br/>
about to unfold itself under our eyes.<br/>
Continuing to ascend-past the double rampart, the double or triple gates, which all these<br/>
old fortresses possess, we penetrate at length into<br/>
a large fortified courtyard, the crenellated walls<br/>
of which shut out our further view. Soldiers<br/>
are on guard there-and how unexpected are<br/>
such soldiers in this holy place of Egypt! The<br/>
