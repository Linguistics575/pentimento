<span>Evening at Thebes 197<br/>
<br/>
seemed to be impregnated a little with the<br/>
ancient grandeur.<br/>
<br/>
And it was only when the early Christians<br/>
ruled here, and after them the Moslem iconoclasts, that the destruction became final. To<br/>
these new believers, who, in their simplicity,<br/>
imagined themselves to be possessed of the ultimate religious formula, and to know by His right<br/>
name the Great Unknowable, Thebes became<br/>
the haunt of "false gods," the abomination of<br/>
abominations, which it <span style="color: #ff0000;">behoved </span>them to destroy.<br/>
<br/>
And so they set to work, penetrating with an<br/>
ever-present fear into the profound depths of the<br/>
gloomy sanctuaries, mutilating first of all the<br/>
thousands of visages whose disconcerting smile<br/>
frightened them, and then exhausting themselves in the effort to uproot the colossi, which,<br/>
even with the help of levers, they could not<br/>
move. It was no easy task indeed, for everything was as solid as geological masses, as rocks<br/>
or promontories. But for five 01' six hundred<br/>
years the town was given over to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">caprice </span>of<br/>
desecrators.<br/>
<br/>
And then came the centuries of silence and<br/>
oblivion under the shroud of the desert sands,<br/>
which, thickening each year, proceeded to bury,<br/>
and, in the event, to preserve for us, this peerless<br/>
relic.<br/>
<br/>
And now, at last, Thebes is being exhumed<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
