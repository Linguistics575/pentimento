absurd. And yet some of the pretty creatures<br/>
in the black veils and bracelets of gold, who<br/>
were in front of us, have disappeared through<br/>
it, and already the perfume of the censers is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">waited </span>towards us. A kind of corridor, astonishingly poor and old, twists itself suspiciously, and then issues into a narrow court,<br/>
more than a thousand years old, where offertory<br/>
boxes, fixed on Oriental brackets, invite our<br/>
alms. The odour of the incense becomes more<br/>
pronounced, and at last a door, hidden in shadow<br/>
at the end of this retreat, gives access to the<br/>
venerable church itself.<br/>

The church! It is a mixture of Byzantine<br/>
basilica, mosque and desert hut. Entering<br/>
there, it is as if we were introduced suddenly<br/>
to the naive infancy of Christianity, as if we<br/>
surprised it, as it were, in its <span style="color: #0000FF;">cradle-which </span>was<br/>
indeed Oriental. The triple nave is full of little<br/>
children (here also, that is what strikes us first),<br/>
of little mites who cry or else laugh and play;<br/>
and there are mothers suckling their new-born<br/>
babes-and all the time the invisible mass is<br/>
being celebrated beyond, behind the iconostasis. On the ground, on mats, whole families<br/>
are seated in circle, as if they were in their<br/>
homes. A thick deposit of white chalk on the<br/>
defaced, shrunken walls bears witness to great<br/>
age. And over all this is a strange old ceil<br/>
