<br/>
us along of themselves, like slides; and it<br/>
seems that we shall never ascend again, any<br/>
more than the great mummy who passed here<br/>
so long ago on his way to his eternal chamber.<br/>
All this brings us, first of all, to a deep welldug there to swallow up the desecrators in their<br/>
passage-and it is on one of the sides of this<br/>
oubliette, behind a casual stone carefully sealed,<br/>
that the continuation of these funeral galleries<br/>
was discovered. Then, when we have passed<br/>
the well, by a narrow bridge that has been thrown<br/>
across it, the stairs begin again, and the steep<br/>
passages that almost make you run; but now,<br/>
by a sharp bend, they have changed their direction. And still we descend, descend. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heavens</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
</span>how deep down this king <span style="color: #0000FF;">dwells</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>And at each<br/>
step of our descent we feel more and more<br/>
imprisoned under the sovereign mass of stone,<br/>
in the centre of all this compact and silent<br/>
thickness.<br/>
<br/>
The little electric globes, placed apart like a<br/>
garland, suffice now for our eyes which have<br/>
forgotten the sun. And we can distinguish<br/>
around us myriad figures inviting us to solemnity<br/>
and silence. They are inscribed everywhere on<br/>
the smooth, spotless walls of the colour of old<br/>
ivory. They follow one another in regular order,<br/>
repeating themselves obstinately in parallel rows,<br/>
<br/>
