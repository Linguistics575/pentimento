<span>Thebes by Night 215<br/>
<br/>
sisted for centuries, on this same spot, where<br/>
formerly for three or four thousand years rose<br/>
such an uproar of living men. To think of the<br/>
clamorous multitudes who once assembled here,<br/>
of their cries of triumph and anguish, of their<br/>
dying agonies. First of all the pantings of those<br/>
thousands of harnessed workers, exhausting themselves generation after generation, under the<br/>
burning sun, in dragging and placing one above<br/>
the other these stones, whose enormity now<br/>
amazes us. And the prodigious feasts, the music<br/>
of the long harps, the blares of the brazen trumpets; the slaughters and battles when Thebes<br/>
was the great and unique capital of the world,<br/>
an object of fear and envy to the kings of the<br/>
barbarian peoples who commenced to awake in<br/>
neighbouring lands; the symphonies of siege<br/>
and pillage, in days when men bellowed with<br/>
the throats of beasts. To think of all this, here<br/>
on this ground, on a night so calm and blue!<br/>
And these same walls of granite from Syene, on<br/>
which my puny hands now rest, to think of the<br/>
beings who have touched them in passing, who<br/>
have fallen by their side in last sanguinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">conflicts</span>, without rubbing even the polish from their<br/>
changeless surfaces!<br/>
<br/>
I now arrive at the hypostyle of the temple<br/>
of Amen, and a sensation of fear makes me<br/>
<br/>
