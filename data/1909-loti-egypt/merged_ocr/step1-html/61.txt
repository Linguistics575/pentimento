<span>The Mosques of Cairo 35<br/>
<br/>
Oh! this sanctuary seen from the silent<br/>
garden, this sanctuary in which the pale gold<br/>
gleams on the old ceiling of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cedarwood</span>, and<br/>
mosaics of mother-of-pearl shine on the walls as<br/>
if they were embroideries of silver that had been<br/>
hung there.<br/>
<br/>
There is no <span style="color: #0000FF;">faience </span>as in the mosques of<br/>
Turkey or of Iran. Here it is the triumph of<br/>
patient mosaic. Mother-of-pearl of all colours,<br/>
all kinds of marble and of porphyry, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cut </span>into<br/>
myriads of little pieces, precise and equal, and<br/>
put together again to form the Arab designs,<br/>
which, never borrowing from the human form,<br/>
nor indeed from the form of any animal, recall<br/>
rather those infinitely varied crystals that may<br/>
be seen under the microscope in a flake of snow.<br/>
It is always the Mihrab which is decorated with<br/>
the most elaborate richness; generally little<br/>
columns of lapis lazuli, intensely blue, rise in<br/>
relief from it, framing mosaics so delicate that<br/>
they look like <span style="color: #0000FF;">brocades </span>of fine lace. In the old<br/>
ceilings of cedarwood, where the singing <span style="color: #0000FF;">birds<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>of the neighbourhood have their nests, the golds<br/>
mingle with some most exquisite <span style="color: #ff0000;">colourings</span>,<br/>
which time has taken care to soften and to blend<br/>
together. And here and there very fine and<br/>
long consoles of sculptured wood seem to fall, as<br/>
it were, from the beams and hang upon the walls<br/>
like <span style="color: #0000FF;">stalactites</span>; and these consoles, too, in past<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
