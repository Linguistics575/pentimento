On its arrival there, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">seared </span>soul had to parley<br/>

flesh, and retained a kind of half life, barely<br/>
conscious. Lying at the bottom of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus </span>it was able to see, by virtue of those two<br/>
eyes, which were painted on the lid, always in<br/>

2 The Bai, which might, at its will, revisit the tomb.<br/>
