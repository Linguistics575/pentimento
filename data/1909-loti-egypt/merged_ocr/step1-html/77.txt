<span>The Hall of the Mummies <span style="color: #0000FF;">51<br/>
<br/>
</span>More fearsome to approach is the row of<br/>
unswathed mummies that follow. Here, in each<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eoffin </span>over which we bend, there is a face which<br/>
stares at <span style="color: #0000FF;">us-or </span>else closes its eyes in'order that<br/>
it may not see us; and meagre shoulders and<br/>
lean arms, and hands with overgrown nails that<br/>
protrude from miserable rags. And each royal<br/>
mummy that our lantern lights reserves for us a<br/>
fresh surprise and the shudder of a different fear<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>resemble one another so little. Some of<br/>
them seem to laugh, showing their yellow teeth;<br/>
others have an expression of infinite sadness and<br/>
suffering. Sometimes the faces are small, refined<br/>
and still beautiful despite the pinching of the<br/>
nostrils; sometimes they are excessively enlarged<br/>
by putrid swelling, with the tip of the nose<br/>
eaten away. The embalmers, we know, were<br/>
not sure of their means, and the mummies were<br/>
not always a success. In some cases putrefaction ensued, and corruption and even sudden<br/>
. hatchings of larvae, those "companions without<br/>
ears and without eyes," which died indeed in time<br/>
but only after they had perforated all the flesh.<br/>
<br/>
Hard by are ranked according to dynasty, and<br/>
in chronological order, the proud Pharaohs in<br/>
a piteous row: father, son, grandson, greatgrandson. And common paper tickets tell their<br/>
tremendous names, Seti I., Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, Seti IL,<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, Ramses IV.... Soon the muster<br/>
