<span>The Passing of Cairo 21<br/>
<br/>
stumbling in the sandals which are too large<br/>
for her small feet, laughs a prolonged, silly<br/>
little laugh like the <span style="color: #ff0000;">elucking </span>of a turkey....<br/>
<br/>
Is there then no keeper, no guardian of<br/>
this holy mosque? And amongst the faithful<br/>
prostrate here in prayer, none who will rise and<br/>
make indignant protest? Who after this will<br/>
speak to us of the fanaticism of the Egyptians?<br/>
... Too meek, rather, they seem to me everywhere. Take any church you please in Europe<br/>
where men go down on their knees in prayer,<br/>
and I should like to see what kind of a welcome would be accorded to a party of Moslem<br/>
tourists who-to suppose the impossible-behaved so badly as these savages here.<br/>
<br/>
Behind the mosque is an esplanade, and<br/>
beyond that the palace. The palace, as such,<br/>
can scarcely be said to exist any longer, for it<br/>
has been turned into a barrack for the army<br/>
of occupation. English soldiers, indeed, meet us<br/>
at every turn, smoking their pipes in the idleness of the evening. One of them who does<br/>
. not smoke is trying to carve his name with a<br/>
knife on one of the layers of marble at the<br/>
base of the sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of this esplanade there is a kind<br/>
of balcony from which one may see the whole<br/>
of the town, and an unlimited extent of verdant<br/>
plains and yellow desert. It is a favourite view<br/>
<br/>
