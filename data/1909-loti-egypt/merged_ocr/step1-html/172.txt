gods and goddesses of his suite; seven vaulted<br/>
chambers; seven doors for the processions of<br/>
kings and multitudes; and, at the sides, numberless halls, corridors, secondary chapels, dark<br/>

the blue ceilings, which are strewn with stars, in<br/>
the likeness of the sky of this country. In many<br/>
cases these stones are missing and leave large<br/>
openings on to the real sky above. Their<br/>
massiveness, which one might have thought<br/>
would secure them an endless duration, has<br/>
availed them nothing; the sun of so many<br/>
centuries has cracked them, and their own<br/>
weight, then, has brought them headlong to<br/>
the ground. And floods of light now enter<br/>
through the gaps, into the very chapels where<br/>
the men of old had thought to ensure a holy<br/>
gloom.<br/>
