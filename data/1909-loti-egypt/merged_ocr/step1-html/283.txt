<span>An Audience of Amenophis II. 245<br/>
<br/>
walled up, had been masked with so much care,<br/>
and lost for centuries! And of all the perseverance that was needed to discover them, the<br/>
observation, the gropings, the soundings and<br/>

</span>But now they are being closed. We loitered<br/>
too long around the colossi of Memnon and the<br/>
palaces of the plain. It is nearly noon, a noon<br/>
consuming and mournful, which falls perpendicularly upon the red summits, and is burning to<br/>
its deepest recesses the valley of stone.<br/>
<br/>
At the door of Amenophis we have to cajole,<br/>
beseech. By the help of a gratuity the Bedouin<br/>
Grand Master of Ceremonies allows himself to be<br/>
persuaded. We are to descend with him, but<br/>
quickly, quickly, for the electric light will soon<br/>
be extinguished. It will be a short audience,<br/>
but at least it will be a private one. We shall<br/>
be alone with the king.<br/>
<br/>
In the darkness, where at first, after so much<br/>
sunlight, the little electric lamps seem to us<br/>
scarcely more than glow-worms, we expected<br/>
a certain amount of chilliness as in the undergrounds of our climate. But here there is only<br/>
a more oppressive heat, stifling and withering,<br/>
and we long to return to the open air, which was<br/>
burning indeed, but was at least the air of life.<br/>
<br/>
Hastily we descend: by steep staircases, by<br/>
passages which slope so rapidly that they hurry<br/>
