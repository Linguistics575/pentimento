<br/>
there are still others, older still and more massive,<br/>
of which there was no suspicion, and whose age<br/>
must exceed eight thousand years.<br/>
<br/>
In spite of the burning sun, and of the clouds<br/>
of dust raised by the blows of the pickaxes, one<br/>
might linger for hours amongst the dust-stained,<br/>
meagre fellahs, watching the excavations in this<br/>
unique soil-where everything that is revealed<br/>
is by way of being a surprise and a lucky find,<br/>
where the least carved stone had a past of glory,<br/>
formed part of the first architectural splendours,<br/>
was a stone of Thebes. Scarcely a moment<br/>
passes but, at the bottom of the trenches, as<br/>
the digging proceeds, some new thing gleams.<br/>
Perhaps it is the polished flank of a colossus,<br/>
fashioned out of granite from Syene, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>a little<br/>
copper Osiris, the debris of a vase, a golden<br/>
trinket beyond price, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>even a simple blue<br/>
pearl that has fallen from the necklace of some<br/>
waiting-maid of a queen.<br/>
<br/>
This activity of the excavators, which alone<br/>
reanimates certain quarters during the day, ends<br/>
at sunset. Every evening the lean fellahs receive<br/>
the daily wage of their labour, and take <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves </span>off to sleep in the silent neighbourhood in<br/>
their huts of mud; and the iron gates are shut<br/>
behind them. At night, except for the guards<br/>
at the entrance, no one inhabits the ruins.<br/>
