of pasture and tillage. We had seen it from<br/>
a great distance, so pure and clear is the air;<br/>
and in approaching it we perceive that it is<br/>
colossal, and in relief on its lintel is designed<br/>
a globe with two long wings outspread<br/>
symmetrically.<br/>
<br/>
It <span style="color: #ff0000;">behoves </span>us now to make obeisance with<br/>
almost religious reverence, for this winged disc<br/>
is a symbol which gives at length an indication<br/>
of the place immediate and absolute. It is<br/>
Egypt, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country-leapt</span>, our ancient mother.<br/>
And there before us must once have stood a<br/>
temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">reverenced </span>of the people, or some great<br/>
vanished town; its fragments of columns and<br/>
sculptured capitals are strewn about in the fields<br/>
of lucerne. How inexplicable it seems that<br/>
this land of ancient splendours, which never<br/>
ceased indeed to be nutritive and prodigiously<br/>
fertile, should have returned, for some hundreds<br/>
of years now, to the humble pastoral life of the<br/>
peasants.<br/>
<br/>
Through the green crops and the assembled<br/>
herds our pathway seems to lead to a kind of hill<br/>
rising alone in the midst of the plains-a hill<br/>
which is neither of the same colour nor the same<br/>
nature as the mountains of the surrounding<br/>
deserts. Behind us the portico recedes little by<br/>
little in the distance; its tall imposing silhouette,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>mournful and solitary, throws an infinite<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
