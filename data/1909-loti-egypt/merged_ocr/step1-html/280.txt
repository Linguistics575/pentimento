<br/>
row of stones turns at last and leads into the<br/>
depths of the mountain by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">tragical </span>passage.<br/>
We enter now into that "Valley of the Kings "<br/>
which was the place of the last rendezvous of<br/>
the most august mummies. The breaths of air<br/>
that reach us between these rocks are become<br/>
suddenly burning, and the site seems to belong<br/>
no longer to earth but to some calcined planet<br/>
which had for ever lost its clouds and atmosphere. This Libyan chain, in the distance so<br/>
delicately rose, is positively frightful now that it<br/>
overhangs us. It looks what it is-an enormous<br/>
and fantastic tomb, a natural necropolis, whose<br/>
vastness and horror nothing human could equal,<br/>
an ideal stove for corpses that wanted to endure<br/>
for ever. The limestone, on which for that<br/>
matter no <span style="color: #0000FF;">rain </span>ever falls from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">changeless<br/>
</span>sky, looks to be in one single piece from summit<br/>
to base, and betrays no crack or crevice by which<br/>
anything might penetrate into the sepulchres<br/>
within. The dead could sleep, therefore, in the<br/>
heart of these monstrous blocks as sheltered as<br/>
under vaults of lead. And of what there is of<br/>
magnificence the centuries have taken care. The<br/>
continual passage of winds laden with dust has<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sealed </span>and worn away the face of the rocks, so<br/>
as to leave only the denser veins of stone,<br/>
and thus have reappeared strange architectural<br/>
fantasies such as Matter, in the beginning, <span style="color: #0000FF;">might<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
