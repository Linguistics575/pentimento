<br/>
their voices as people instinctively do in church.<br/>
And the Bedouin guides, who a moment ago<br/>
seemed to flutter about the giant monument like<br/>
so many black <span style="color: #ff0000;">mothv</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>too have gone,<br/>
made restless by the cold air, Which erstwhile<br/>
they had not known. The show for to-night is<br/>
over, and everywhere silence reigns.<br/>
<br/>
The rosy tint fades on the Sphinx and the<br/>
pyramids; all things in the ghostly scene grow<br/>
visibly paler; for the moon as it rises becomes<br/>
more silvery in the increasing <span style="color: #0000FF;">chilliness </span>of mid..<br/>
night. The winter mist, exhaled from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificially </span>watered fields below, continues to rise,<br/>
takes heart and envelops the great mute face<br/>
itself. And the latter persists in its regard of<br/>
the dead moon, preserving still the old disconcerting smile. It becomes more and more difficult<br/>
to believe that here before us is a real colossus,<br/>
so <span style="color: #ff0000;">surelydoes </span>it seem nothing other than a dilated<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">reflection </span>of a thing which exists elsewhere, in<br/>
some other world. And behind in the distance<br/>
are the three triangular mountains. Them, too,<br/>
the fog envelops, till they also cease to exist, and<br/>
become pure visions of the Apocalypse.<br/>
<br/>
Now it is that little by little an intolerable<br/>
sadness is expressed in those large eyes with<br/>
their empty sockets-for, at this moment, the<br/>
ultimate secret, that which the Sphinx seems to<br/>
have known for so many centuries, but to have<br/>
