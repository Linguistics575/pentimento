<span>CHAPTER IV<br/>
THE HALL OF THE MUMMIES<br/>
<br/>
THERE are two of us, and as we light our way<br/>
by the aid of a lantern through these vast halls<br/>
we might be taken for a night watch on its<br/>
round. We have just shut behind us and<br/>
doubly locked the door by which we entered,<br/>
and we know that we are alone, rigorously<br/>
alone, although this place is so vast, with its<br/>
endless, communicating halls, its high <span style="color: #0000FF;">vestibule<br/>
</span>and great flights of stairs; mathematically alone,<br/>
one might almost say, for this palace that we<br/>
are in is one quite out of the ordinary, and all<br/>
its outlets were closed and sealed at nightfall.<br/>
Every night indeed the doors are sealed, on<br/>
account of the priceless <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>that are collected<br/>
here. So we shall not meet with any living<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>being in these halls to-night, spite of their vast<br/>
extent and endless turnings, and in spite too<br/>
of all these mysterious things that are ranged<br/>
on every side and fill the place with shadows<br/>
and hiding-places.<br/>
<br/>
Our round takes us first along the ground<br/>
floor over flagstones that resound to our <span style="color: #0000FF;">footsteps</span>. It is about ten of the clock. Here and<br/>
