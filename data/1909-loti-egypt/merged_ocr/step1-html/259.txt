filled with cement. But the great blocks lie in<br/>
confusion, and one feels, even to the point of<br/>
despair, how impossible it is ever to restore to<br/>
order such a chaos of crushing, overthrown things<br/>

machines, and with centuries before you in which<br/>
to complete the task.<br/>
<br/>
And then, what surprises and oppresses you<br/>
is the want of clear space, the little room that<br/>
remained for the multitudes in these halls which<br/>
are nevertheless immense. The whole space<br/>
between the walls was encumbered with pillars.<br/>
The temples were half filled with colossal forests<br/>
of stone. The men who built Thebes lived in the<br/>
beginning of time, and had not yet discovered<br/>
the thing which to us to-day seems so simple-namely, the vault. And yet they were <span style="color: #0000FF;">marvellous </span>pioneers, these architects. They had<br/>

the straight line, the right angle, the vertical<br/>
line, of which Nature furnishes no example, even<br/>
symmetry, which, if you consider it well, is less<br/>
explicable still. They employed symmetry with<br/>
a consummate mastery, understanding as well as<br/>
