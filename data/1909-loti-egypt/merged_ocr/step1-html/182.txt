<span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
<br/>
</span>But to-day the foreigners are masters here,<br/>
and have wakened the old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-wakened </span>to<br/>
enslave it. In less than twenty years they<br/>
have disfigured its valley, which until then had<br/>
preserved itself like a sanctuary. They have<br/>
silenced its cataracts, captured its precious water<br/>
by dams, to pour it afar off on plains that are<br/>
become like marshes and already sully with their<br/>
mists the crystal <span style="color: #0000FF;">clearness </span>of the sky. The<br/>
ancient rigging no longer suffices to water the<br/>
land under cultivation. Machines worked by<br/>
steam, which draw the water more quickly,<br/>
commence to rise along the banks, side by side<br/>
with new factories. Soon there will scarcely be<br/>
a river more <span style="color: #0000FF;">dishonored </span>than this, by iron<br/>
chimneys and thick, black smoke. And it is<br/>
happening <span style="color: #0000FF;">apace</span>, this exploitation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-hastily</span>, greedily, as in a hunt for spoils. And<br/>
thus all its beauty disappears, for its monotonous<br/>
course, through regions endlessly alike, won us<br/>
only by its calm and its old-world mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Poor Nile of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prodigies </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l. </span>One feels sometimes still its departing charm, stray corners of<br/>
it remain intact. There are days <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftranscendent<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">clearness</span>, incomparable evenings, when one may<br/>
still forget the ugliness and the smoke. But the<br/>
classic expedition by dahabiya, the ascent of the<br/>
river from Cairo to Nubia, will soon have ceased<br/>
to be worth making.<br/>
