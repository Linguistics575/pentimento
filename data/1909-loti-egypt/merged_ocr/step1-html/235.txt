<span>Evening at Thebes 201<br/>
<br/>
On this side, too, the view embraces great<br/>
peaceful distances. Past the last pylons, and<br/>
beyond the crumbling ramparts the country,<br/>
down there behind the town, presents the same<br/>
appearance as that we were facing a moment<br/>
before. The same cornfields, the same woods<br/>
of date-trees, that make a girdle of green palms<br/>
around the ruins. And, right in the background,<br/>
a chain of mountains is lit up and glows with a<br/>
vivid coral colour. It is the chain of the Arabi an<br/>
desert, lying parallel to that of Libya, along the<br/>
whole length of the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">valley-which </span>is thus<br/>
guarded on right and left by stones and sand<br/>
stretched out in profound solitudes.<br/>
<br/>
In all the surrounding country which we<br/>
command from this spot there is <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">indication<br/>
</span>of the present day; only here and there, amongst<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-trees</span>, the villages of the field labourers,<br/>
whose houses of dried earth can scarcely have<br/>
changed since the days of the Pharaohs. Our<br/>
contemporary desecrators have up till now respected the infinite desuetude of the place, and,<br/>
for the tourists who begin to haunt it, no one<br/>
yet has dared to build a hotel.<br/>
<br/>
Slowly the sun descends; and behind us the<br/>
granites of the town-mummy seem to burn<br/>
more and more. It is true that a slight shadow<br/>
of a warmer tint, an amaranth violet, begins to<br/>
encroach upon the lower parts, spreading along<br/>
<br/>
