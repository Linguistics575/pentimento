<br/>
gave on to the Nile. It was there that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">God<br/>
</span>Amen, carried and followed by long trains of<br/>
priests, came every year to take his golden barge<br/>
for a solemn procession. But it leads to-day<br/>
only to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eornfields</span>, for, in the course of<br/>
successive centuries, the river has receded little<br/>
by little and now winds its course a thousand<br/>
yards away in the direction of Libya.<br/>
<br/>
We can see, beyond, the old sacred Nile<br/>
between the clusters of <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-trees </span>on its banks;<br/>
meandering there like a rosy pathway, which<br/>
remains, nevertheless, in this hour of universal<br/>
incandescence, astonishingly pale, and gleams<br/>
occasionally with a bluish light. And on the<br/>
farther bank, from one end to the other of<br/>
the western horizon, stretches the chain of the<br/>
Libyan mountains behind which the sun is about<br/>
to plunge; a chain of red sandstone, parched<br/>
since the beginning of the world-without a<br/>
rival in the preservation to perpetuity of dead<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bodies-which </span>the Thebans perforated to its<br/>
extreme depths to fill it with sarcophagi.<br/>
<br/>
We watch the sun descend. But we turn also<br/>
to see, behind us, the ruins in this the traditional<br/>
moment of their apotheosis. Thebes, the immense town-mummy, seems all at once to be<br/>
ablaze-as if its old stones were able still to burn;<br/>
all its blocks, fallen or upright, appear to have<br/>
been suddenly made ruddy by the glow of fire.<br/>
