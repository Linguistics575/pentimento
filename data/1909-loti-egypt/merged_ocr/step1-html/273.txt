filth of their entrails. That chain of living rocks<br/>
that rises before us, coloured each morning with<br/>
the same rose, as of a tender flower, is literally<br/>
stuffed with dead bodies.<br/>
<br/>
We have to cross a wide plain before reaching<br/>
the mountains, and on our way cornfields alternate with stretches of sand already desertlike.<br/>
Behind us extends the old Nile and the opposite<br/>
bank which we have lately quitted-the bank of<br/>
Luxor, whose gigantic <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharaonic </span>colonnades are<br/>
as it were lengthened below by their own <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflection </span>in the mirror of the river. And in this<br/>
radiant morning, in this pure light, it would be<br/>
admirable, this eternal temple, with its image<br/>
reversed in the depth of the blue water, were it<br/>
not that at its sides, and to twice its height, rises<br/>
the impudent Winter Palace, that monster hotel<br/>
built last year for the fastidious tourists. And<br/>
yet, who knows? The <span style="color: #0000FF;">jackanapes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">who-deposited<br/>
</span>this abomination on the sacred soil of Egypt<br/>
perhaps imagines that he equals the merit of the<br/>
artist who is now restoring the sanctuaries of<br/>
Thebes, or even the glory of the Pharaohs who<br/>
built them.<br/>
<br/>
As we draw nearer to the chain of Libya,<br/>
where this king awaits us, we traverse fields still<br/>
green with growing corn-and sparrows and<br/>
larks sing around us in the impetuous spring of<br/>
this land of Thebes.<br/>
