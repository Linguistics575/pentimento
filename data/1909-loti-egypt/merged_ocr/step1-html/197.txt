</span>CHAPTER XII<br/>
<br/>
IN THE TEMPLE OF THE GODDESS OF LOVE<br/>
AND JOY<br/>
<br/>
IT is the month of March, but as gay and<br/>
splendid as in our June. Around us are fields<br/>
of corn, of lucerne, and the flowering bean.<br/>
And the air is full of restless birds, singing<br/>
deliriously for very joy in the voluptuous business<br/>
of their nests and coveys. Our way lies over a<br/>
fertile soil, saturated with vital <span style="color: #0000FF;">substance </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s-some<br/>
</span>paradise for beasts no doubt, for they swarm on<br/>
every side: <span style="color: #ff0000;">floeks </span>of goats with a thousand<br/>
bleating kids; she-asses with their <span style="color: #0000FF;">frisking<br/>
</span>young; cows and cow-buffaloes feeding their<br/>
calves; all turned loose among the crops, to<br/>
browse at their leisure, as if there were here a<br/>
superabundance of the riches of the soil.<br/>
<br/>
What country is this that shows no sign of<br/>
human habitation, that knows no village, nor<br/>
any distant spire? The crops are like ours at<br/>
home-wheat, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lucerne</span>, and the flowering bean<br/>
that perfumes the air with its white blossoms.<br/>
But there is an excess of light in the sky and,<br/>
in the distance, an extraordinary clearness<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>And then these fertile plains, that might <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
