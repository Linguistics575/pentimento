foot of his pylon on which the history of a Pharaoh<br/>
is carved in one immense picture. Above him<br/>
and above his wall, which grows each minute<br/>
more rose-coloured, I see, gradually mounting in<br/>
proportion as I move away from it, the great<br/>
mass of the palaces of the centre, the hypostyle<br/>
hall, the halls of Thothmes and the obelisks,<br/>
all the entangled cluster of those things at once<br/>
so grand and so dead, which have never been<br/>
equalled on earth.<br/>
<br/>
And as I continue to gaze upon the ruins,<br/>
resplendent now in the rosy apotheosis of the<br/>
evening, they come to look like the crumbling<br/>
remains of a gigantic skeleton. They seem to<br/>
be begging for a merciful <span style="color: #0000FF;">surcease</span>, as if they<br/>
were tired of this endless gala colouring at each<br/>
setting of the sun, which mocks them with its<br/>
eternity.<br/>

the air is so limpid, the outlines remain so<br/>
clear that the illusion is rather that the temples<br/>
and the pylons grow smaller, lower themselves<br/>
and sink into the earth. The white giant who<br/>
follows me always with his sightless stare is now<br/>
reduced to the proportions of a simple human<br/>
dreamer. His attitude moreover <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>not the<br/>
rigid hieratic aspect of the other Theban statues.<br/>
With his hands upon his knees he looks like<br/>
a mere ordinary mortal who had stopped to<br/>
