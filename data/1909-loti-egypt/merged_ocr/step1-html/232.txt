</span>and restored to a semblance of <span style="color: #ff0000;">life-mow</span>, after a<br/>
cycle of seven or eight thousand years, when our<br/>
Western humanity, having left the primitive gods<br/>
that we see here, to embrace the Christian conception, which, even yesterday, made it live, is<br/>
in way of denying everything, and struggles<br/>
before the enigma of death in an obscurity more<br/>
dismal and more fearful than in the commencement of the ages. (More dismal and more<br/>
fearful still in this, that the plea of youth is<br/>
gone.) From all parts of Europe curious and<br/>
unquiet spirits, as well as mere idlers, turn their<br/>
steps towards Thebes, the ancient mother. Men<br/>
clear the rubbish from its remains, devise ways<br/>
of retarding the enormous fallings of its ruins,<br/>
and dig in its old soil, stored with hidden<br/>
treasure.<br/>
<br/>
And this evening on one of the portals to<br/>
which I have just mounted-that which opens<br/>
at the north-west and terminates the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal<br/>
</span>artery of temples and palaces, many very diverse<br/>
groups have already taken their places, after the<br/>
pilgrimage of the day amongst the ruins. And<br/>
others are hastening towards the staircase by<br/>
which we have just climbed, so as not to miss<br/>
the grand spectacle of the sun setting, always<br/>
with the same serenity, the same unchanging<br/>
magnificence, behind the town which once was<br/>
consecrated to it.<br/>
