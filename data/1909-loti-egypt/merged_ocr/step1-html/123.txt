<span>CHAPTER VII<br/>
THE OUTSKIRTS OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">CAIRO<br/>
<br/>
</span>NIGHT. A long straight road, the artery of<br/>
some capital, through which our carriage drives<br/>
at a fast trot, making a deafening clatter on<br/>
the pavement. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Electric </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">light </span>everywhere. The<br/>
shops are closing; it must needs be late.<br/>
<br/>
The road is Levantine in its general character:<br/>
and we should have no clear notion of the place<br/>
did we not see in our rapid, noisy passage<br/>
signs that recall us to the land of the Arabs.<br/>
People pass dressed in the long robe and tarboosh of the East; and some of the houses,<br/>
above the European shops, are ornamented<br/>
with <span style="color: #ff0000;">mushrabiyas</span>. But this blinding electricity<br/>
strikes a false note. In our hearts are we quite<br/>
sure we are in the East?<br/>
<br/>
The road ends, opening on to darkness.<br/>
Suddenly, without any warning, it abuts upon<br/>
a void in which the eyes see nothing, and we<br/>
roll over a yielding, felted soil, where all noise<br/>
abruptly ceases-it is the desert!... Not a<br/>
vague, <span style="color: #0000FF;">nondescript </span>stretch of country such as<br/>
in the outskirts of our towns, not one of the<br/>
solitudes of Europe, but the threshold of the<br/>
<br/>
93<br/>
<br/>
