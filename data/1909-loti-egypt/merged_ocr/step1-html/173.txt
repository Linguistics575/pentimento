<br/>
</span>the walls, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>this forest of <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns-estimate<br/>
</span>and, with their arms and long hands, continue<br/>
with animation their eternal mute conversation. The whole temple, with the openings<br/>
which give it light, is more beautiful perhaps<br/>
than in the time of the Pharaohs. In place of<br/>
the old-time darkness, a transparent gloom now<br/>
alternates with shafts of sunlight. Here and<br/>
there the subjects of the bas-reliefs, so long<br/>
buried in the darkness, are deluged with burning<br/>
rays which detail their attitudes, their muscles,<br/>
their scarcely altered colours, and endow them<br/>
again with life and youth. There is no part of<br/>
the wall, in this immense place, but is covered<br/>
with divinities, with hieroglyphs and emblems.<br/>
Osiris in high coiffure, the beautiful Isis in<br/>
the helmet of a bird, jackal-headed Anubis,<br/>
falcon-headed Horus, and ibis-headed Thoth are<br/>
repeated a thousand times, welcoming with<br/>
strange gestures the kings and priests who are<br/>
rendering them homage.<br/>
<br/>
The bodies, almost nude, with broad shoulders<br/>
and slim waist, have a slenderness, a grace,<br/>
infinitely chaste, and the features of the faces<br/>
are of an exquisite purity. The artists who<br/>
carved these charming heads, with their long<br/>
eyes, full of the ancient dream, were already<br/>
skilled in their art; but through a deficiency,<br/>
which puzzles us, they were only able to draw<br/>
<br/>
