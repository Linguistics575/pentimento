<br/>
the avenues and over the open <span style="color: #0000FF;">spaces</span>.<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>But<br/>
everything that rises into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sky-the </span>friezes<br/>
of the temples, the capitals of the columns,<br/>
the sharp points of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks-are </span>still red as<br/>
glowing embers. These all become imbued with<br/>
light and continue to glow and shed a rosy<br/>
illumination until the end of the twilight.<br/>
<br/>
It is a glorious hour, even for the old dust of<br/>
Egypt, which fills the air eternally, without<br/>
detracting at all from its wonderful clearness.<br/>
It savours of spices, of the Bedouin, of the<br/>
bitumen of the sarcophagus. And here now it<br/>
is playing the <span style="color: #ff0000;">r√©le </span>of those powders of different<br/>
shades of gold which the Japanese use for the<br/>
backgrounds of their lacquered landscapes. It<br/>
reveals itself everywhere, close to and on the<br/>
horizon, modifying at its pleasure the colour of<br/>
things, and giving them a kind of metallic lustre.<br/>
The phantasy of its changes is unimaginable.<br/>
Even in the distances of the countryside, it is<br/>
busy indicating by little trailing clouds of gold<br/>
the smallest pathways traversed by the herds.<br/>
<br/>
And now the disc of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">God </span>of Thebes has<br/>
disappeared behind the Libyan mountains, after<br/>
changing its light from red to yellow and from<br/>
yellow to green.<br/>
<br/>
And thereupon the tourists, <span style="color: #0000FF;">judging </span>that the<br/>
display is over for the night, commence to<br/>
descend and make ready for departure. Some<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
