THE MOSQUES OF CAIRO<br/>
<br/>
THEY are almost innumerable, more than 3000,<br/>
and this great town, which covers some twelve<br/>
miles of plain, might well be called a city of<br/>
mosques. (I speak, of course, of the ancient<br/>

Cairo, the Cairo of sham elegance and of<br/>
"Semiramis Hotels," does not deserve to be<br/>
mentioned except with a smile.)<br/>

arabesques, carved and complicated with the<br/>
most changing fancy. They have their <span style="color: #0000FF;">little<br/>

so fashioned that the daylight shows through<br/>
them. Some are far away in the distance; others<br/>

our heads. No matter where one looks-as far<br/>
as the eye can see-still there are others; all<br/>
of the same familiar colour, a brown turning<br/>
