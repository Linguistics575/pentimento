And then there are the great tourist boats of<br/>
the Agencies, which are here in abundance, for<br/>
Assouan has the privilege of being the terminus<br/>
of the line; and their whistlings, their revolving<br/>
motors, their electric dynamos maintain from<br/>
morning till night a captivating symphony. It<br/>
might be urged perhaps against these structures<br/>
that they resemble a little the washhouses on the<br/>
Seine; but the Agencies, desirous of restoring to<br/>
them a certain local colour, have given them<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">names </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">notoriously </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span>that one is reduced<br/>
to silence. They are called Sesostris, Amenophis<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Ramses the Great.<br/>
<br/>
And finally there are the rowing boats, which<br/>
carry passengers incessantly backwards and forwards between the river-banks. So long as the<br/>
season remains at its height they are bedecked<br/>
with a number of little flags of red cotton-cloth,<br/>
or even of simple paper. The rowers, moreover,<br/>
have been instructed to sing all the time the<br/>
native songs which are accompanied by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">derboucca </span>player seated in the prow. Nay, they<br/>
have even learnt to utter that rousing, stimulating<br/>
cry which Anglo-Saxons use to express their enthusiasm or their joy<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>"Hip! <span style="color: #0000FF;">hip </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hurrah </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l. </span>"and<br/>
you cannot conceive how well it sounds, coming<br/>
between the Arab songs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>otherwise might<br/>
be apt to grow monotonous.<br/>
