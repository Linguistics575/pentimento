<span>I 24 Egypt<br/>
now-for some two thousand years-fallen into<br/>
a kind of tired sleep, which has left it an easy<br/>
prey alike to the conquerors of yesterday and<br/>
to the exploiters of to-day.<br/>
<br/>
Another trait which, side by side with their<br/>
patience, prevails amongst these true-blooded<br/>
Egyptians of the countryside is their attachment<br/>
to the soil, to the soil which nourishes them, and<br/>
in which later on they will sleep. To possess<br/>
land, to forestall at any price the smallest portion of it, to reclaim patches of it from the<br/>
shifting desert, that is the sole aim, or almost<br/>
so, which the fellahs pursue in this world: to<br/>
possess a field, however small it may be-a field,<br/>
moreover, which they till with the oldest plough<br/>
invented by man, the exact design of which may<br/>
be seen carved on the walls of the tombs at<br/>
Memphis.<br/>
<br/>
And this same people, which was the first of<br/>
any to conceive magnificence, whose gods and<br/>
kings were formerly surrounded with an overpowering splendour, contrives to live to-day,<br/>
pell-mell with its sheep and goats, in humble,<br/>
low-roofed cabins made out of <span style="color: #ff0000;">sunbaked </span>mud!<br/>
The Egyptian villages are all of the neutral<br/>
colour of the soil; a little white chalk brightens,<br/>
perhaps, the minaret or cupola of the mosque;<br/>
but except for that little refuge, whither folk<br/>
come to pray each <span style="color: #ff0000;">evening-Mor </span>no one here<br/>
