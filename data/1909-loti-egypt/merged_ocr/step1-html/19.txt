</span>they should be so disquieting.... And this<br/>
pervading colour of rose, whence comes it, seeing<br/>
that usually the moon tints with blue the things<br/>
it illumines? One would not expect this colour<br/>
either, which, nevertheless, is that of all the<br/>
sands and all the granites of Egypt and Arabia.<br/>
And then too, the eyes of the statue, how often<br/>
have we not seen them? And did we not know<br/>
that they were capable only of their one fixed<br/>
stare? Why is it then that their motionless regard surprises and chills us, even while<br/>
we are obsessed by the smile of the sealed lips<br/>
that seem to hold back the answer to the<br/>
supreme enigma?...<br/>

It is cold, but cold as in our country are the<br/>
fine nights of <span style="color: #0000FF;">January</span>, and a wintry mist rises<br/>
low down in the little valleys of the sand. And<br/>

question the latest invaders of this country, by<br/>
changing the course of the old Nile, so as to<br/>
water the earth and make it more productive,<br/>
have brought hither the humidity of their own<br/>
misty isle. And this strange cold, this mist,<br/>
light as it still is, seem to presage the end of<br/>
ages, give an added remoteness and finality to<br/>
all this dead past, which lies here beneath us in<br/>
subterranean <span style="color: #0000FF;">labyrinths </span>haunted by a thousand<br/>
mummies.<br/>
<br/>
And the mist, which, as the night advances,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
