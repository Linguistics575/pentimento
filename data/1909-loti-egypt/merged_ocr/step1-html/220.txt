bewildering. The God Amen himself came by<br/>
water, on the river, in his golden barge with<br/>
its raised prow, followed by the barques of all<br/>
the other gods and goddesses of his heaven. The<br/>
reddish stone, carved with minute care, tells me<br/>
all this, as it has already told it to so many dead<br/>
generations, so that I seem almost to see it.<br/>
And now everybody has <span style="color: #0000FF;">gone </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>the colonnades<br/>
are empty and the noise of the dynamos has<br/>
ceased. Midday approaches with its torpor.<br/>
The whole temple seems to be ablaze with rays,<br/>
and I watch the clear-cut shadows <span style="color: #ff0000;">cast </span>by this<br/>
forest of stone gradually shortening on the<br/>
ground. The sun, which just now shone, all<br/>
smiles and gaiety, upon the quay of the new<br/>
town amid the uproar of the stall-keepers, the<br/>
donkey drivers and the cosmopolitan passengers,<br/>
casts here a sullen, impassive and consuming fire.<br/>
And meanwhile the shadows shorten-and just<br/>
as they do every day, beneath this sky which is<br/>
never overcast, just as they have done for five<br/>
and thirty centuries, these columns, these friezes<br/>
and this temple itself, like a mysterious and<br/>
solemn sundial, record patiently <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the ground<br/>
the slow passing of the hours. Verily for us, the<br/>
ephemera: of thought, this unbroken continuity<br/>
of the sun of Egypt has more of melancholy even<br/>
than the changing, overcast skies of our climate.<br/>
And now, at last, the temple is restored to<br/>
