<span>The Hall of the Mummies 4.5<br/>
<br/>
enamel, wide-open eyes, that pierce straight into<br/>
the depths of ours, that seem to follow us as we<br/>
pass and make us shiver as if by the contact<br/>
of a thought that comes from the abysm of the<br/>
ages.<br/>
<br/>
We pass on rapidly, however, and somewhat<br/>
inattentively, for our business here to-night is<br/>
not with these simulacra on the ground floor,<br/>
but with the more redoubtable hosts above.<br/>
Besides our lantern sheds so little light in these<br/>
great halls that all these people of granite and<br/>
sandstone and marble appear only at the precise<br/>
moment of our passage, appear only to disappear, and, spreading their fantastic shadows<br/>
on the walls, mingle the next moment with<br/>
the great mute crowd, that grows ever more<br/>
numerous behind us.<br/>
<br/>
Placed at intervals are apparatus for use in<br/>
case of fire, coils of hose and standpipes that<br/>
shine with the warm glow of burnished copper,<br/>
and I ask my companion of the watch I "What<br/>
is there that could burn here? Are not these<br/>
good people all of stone<span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>And he answers:<br/>
"Not here indeed; but consider how the things<br/>
that are above would blaze." Ah! yes. The<br/>
"things that are above "<span style="color: #0000FF;">-which </span>are indeed the<br/>
object of my visit to-night. I had no thought<br/>
of fire catching hold in an assembly of mummies;<br/>
of the old withered flesh, the dead, dry hair, the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
