<span>62 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
Moslem university in the world. And since<br/>
then successive sovereigns of Egypt have vied<br/>
with one another in perfecting and enlarging it;<br/>
adding new halls, new galleries, new minarets,<br/>
till they have made of El-Azhar almost a town<br/>
within a town.<br/>

</span>"He who seeks instruction is more loved of God than <span style="color: #0000FF;">he<br/>
</span>who fights in a holy war."<br/>
A verse from the Hadith.<br/>
<br/>
Eleven <span style="color: #0000FF;">o'elock </span>on a day of burning sunshine<br/>
and dazzling light. El-Azhar still vibrates with<br/>
the murmur of many voices, although the lessons<br/>
of the morning are nearly finished<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Once past the threshold of the double<br/>
ornamented door we enter the courtyard, at this<br/>
moment empty as the desert and dazzling with<br/>
sunshine. Beyond, quite open, the mosque<br/>
spreads out its endless arcades, which are continued and repeated till they are lost in the<br/>
gloom of the far interior, and in this dim place,<br/>
with its perplexing depths, innumerable people<br/>
in turbans, sitting in a close crowd, are singing,<br/>
or rather chanting, in a low voice, and marking<br/>
time as it were to their <span style="color: #0000FF;">declamation </span>by a slight<br/>
rhythmic swaying from the hips. They are the<br/>
ten thousand students come from all parts of<br/>
the world to absorb the changeless doctrine of<br/>
El-Azhar.<br/>
