<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">140 </span>Egypt<br/>
of Seti in the vicinity, where the enterprise of<br/>
Thomas Cook & Son flourishes, there is nothing<br/>
around us but ruins, crumbled and pulverised<br/>
beyond all possible redemption. But they give<br/>
us pause, these disappearing ruins, for they are<br/>
the debris of that ageless temple, where sleeps<br/>
the head of the god, the debris of the tombs of<br/>
the Middle and Ancient Empires, and they<br/>
indicate still the wide extent and development of<br/>
the necropoles of Abydos, so old that it almost<br/>
makes one giddy to think of their beginning.<br/>
Here, as at Thebes and Memphis, the tombs<br/>
of the Egyptians are met with only amongst<br/>
the sands and the parched rocks. The great<br/>
ancestral people, who would have shuddered at<br/>
our black trees, and the corruption of the damp<br/>
graves, liked to place its embalmed dead in the<br/>
midst of this luminous, changeless splendour of<br/>
death, which men call the desert.<br/>
<br/>
And what is this now that is happening in<br/>
the holy neighbourhood of unhappy Osiris? A<br/>
troupe of donkeys, <span style="color: #ff0000;">belaboured </span>by Bedouin<br/>
drivers, is being driven in the direction of the<br/>
adjacent temple, dedicated to the god by Seti!<br/>
The luncheon no doubt is over and the band<br/>
about to depart, sharp to the appointed hour<br/>
of the programme. Let us watch them from a<br/>
prudent distance.<br/>
