<br/>
one may read there, written in a careless hand,<br/>
that name which once caused the whole world<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">tremble-</span>" Ramses II. (Sesostris) "<span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>It need<br/>
not be said that he has greatly fallen away and<br/>
blackened even in the fifteen years that I have<br/>
known him. He is a phantom that is about to<br/>
disappear; in spite of all the care lavished upon<br/>
him, a poor phantom about to fall to pieces,<br/>
to sink into nothingness. We move our lantern<br/>
about his hooked nose, the better to decipher,<br/>
in the play of shadow, his expression, that still<br/>
remains authoritative.... To think that once<br/>
the destinies of the world were ruled, without<br/>
appeal, by the nod of this head, which looks<br/>
now somewhat narrow, under the dry skin and<br/>
the horrible whitish hair. What force of will,<br/>
of passion and <span style="color: #ff0000;">eolossal </span>pride must once have<br/>
dwelt therein! Not to mention the anxiety,<br/>
which to us now is scarcely conceivable, but<br/>
which in his time overmastered all <span style="color: #ff0000;">others-Abe<br/>
</span>anxiety, that is to say, of assuring the <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnifieence </span>and inviolability of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulture</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>...<br/>
And this horrible scarecrow, toothless and<br/>
senile, lying here in its filthy rags, with the<br/>
hand raised in an impotent menace, was once<br/>
the brilliant Sesostris, the master of kings, and<br/>
by virtue of his strength and beauty the demigod also, whose muscular limbs and deep athletic<br/>
chest many colossal statues at Memphis, at<br/>
<br/>
