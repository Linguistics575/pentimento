dahabiya had slumbered against the bank of the<br/>
Nile. It is necessary first of all to cross the<br/>
river, for the Theban kings of the Middle Empire<br/>
all established their eternal habitations on the<br/>
opposite <span style="color: #ff0000;">bank-far </span>beyond the plains of the<br/>

mountains that the products of so many careful<br/>
wrappings were borne for burial, while the Nile<br/>
carried away the blood from the bodies and the<br/>
