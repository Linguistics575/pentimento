<span>The Outskirts of Cairo 99<br/>
<br/>
and fifteenth centuries where the Mameluke<br/>
Sultans, who oppressed Egypt for nearly three<br/>
hundred years, sleep now in complete abandonment. Nowadays, it is true, some visits are<br/>
beginning to be paid to them-on winter nights<br/>
when the moon is full and they throw on the<br/>
sands their great clear-cut shadows. At such<br/>
times the light is considered favourable, and<br/>
they rank among the curiosities exploited by the<br/>
agencies. Numbers of tourists (who persist in<br/>
calling them the tombs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">caliphs</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">betake<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thither </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">evening-a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">noisy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">caravan<br/>
</span>mounted on little donkeys. But to-night the<br/>
moon is too pale and uncertain, and we shall no<br/>
doubt be alone in troubling them in their ghostly<br/>
communion.<br/>
<br/>
To-night indeed the light is quite unusual.<br/>
As just now in the town of the dead, it is diffused<br/>
on all sides and gives even to the most massive<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>objects the transparent semblance of unreality.<br/>
<br/>
But nevertheless it shows their detail and leaves<br/>
them something of their daylight colouring, so<br/>
that all these funeral domes, raised on the ruins<br/>
of the mosques, which serve them as pedestals,<br/>
have preserved their reddish or brown colours,<br/>
although the sand which separates them, and<br/>
makes between the tombs of the different sultans<br/>
little dead solitudes, remains pale and wan.<br/>
And meanwhile our carriage, proceeding always<br/>
<br/>
