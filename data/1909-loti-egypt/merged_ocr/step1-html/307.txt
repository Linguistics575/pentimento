devour men; and none of them would willingly<br/>
venture near her dwelling at this late hour. But<br/>
instead of returning to Luxor, like the good<br/>
people whose carriages have just departed, I<br/>
rather choose to pay her a visit.<br/>
<br/>
Her dwelling is some distance away, and I<br/>
shall not reach it till the dead of night.<br/>
<br/>
First of all I have to retrace my steps, to<br/>
return along the whole avenue of rams, to pass<br/>
again by the feet of the white giant, who has<br/>
already assumed his phantomlike appearance,<br/>
while the violet waves that bathed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">townmummy </span>thicken and turn to a greyish-blue.<br/>
And then, leaving behind me the pylons guarded<br/>
by the broken giants, I thread my way among<br/>
the palaces of the centre.<br/>
<br/>
It is among these palaces that I encounter for<br/>
good and all the night, with the first cries of the<br/>
owls and ospreys. It is still warm there, on<br/>
account of the heat stored by the stones during<br/>
the day, but one feels nevertheless that the air is<br/>
freezing.<br/>
<br/>
At a crossing a tall human figure looms up,<br/>
draped in black and armed with a baton. It is<br/>
a roving Bedouin, one of the guards, and this<br/>
more or less is the dialogue exchanged between<br/>
us (freely and succinctly translated)<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Your permit, sir."<br/>
<br/>
"Here it is."<br/>
