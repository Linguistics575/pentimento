<br/>
early branches that one sees in spring, which<br/>
shoot first from the stem, and sometimes die<br/>
before the summer. It nursed that people,<br/>
whose least vestiges we discover to-day with<br/>
surprise and wonder; a people who, in the very<br/>
dawn, in the midst of the original barbarity, <span style="color: #0000FF;">conceived </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificently </span>the infinite and the divine;<br/>
who placed with such certainty and grandeur the<br/>
first architectural lines, from which afterwards<br/>
our architecture was to be derived; who laid the<br/>
bases of art, of science, and of all knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Later on, when <span style="color: #ff0000;">this </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">beautifulflowerof </span>humanity<br/>
was faded, the Nile, flowing always in the midst of<br/>
its deserts, seems to have had for mission, during<br/>
nearly two thousand years, the maintenance on<br/>
its banks of a kind of immobility and desuetude, which was in a way a homage of respect<br/>
for these stupendous relics. While the sand was<br/>
burying the ruins of the temples and the battered<br/>
faces of the colossi, nothing changed under this<br/>
sky of changeless blue. The same cultivation<br/>
proceeded on the banks as in the oldest ages; the<br/>
same boats, with the same sails, went up and down<br/>
the thread of water; the same songs kept time<br/>
to the eternal human toil. The race of fellahs,<br/>
the unconscious guardian of a prodigious past,<br/>
slept on without desire of change, and almost<br/>
without suffering. And time passed for Egypt<br/>
in a great peace of sunlight and of death.<br/>
