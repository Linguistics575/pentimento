blade of a lance. And then, at once, I <span style="color: #ff0000;">understand-Theses</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">!<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thebes</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span>Last evening it was hidden in the<br/>
shadow and I did not know it was so near. But<br/>
Thebes assuredly it is, for nothing else in the<br/>
world could produce such an apparition. And<br/>
I salute with a kind of shudder of respect this<br/>
unique and sovereign ruin, which had haunted<br/>
me for many years, but which until now life had<br/>
not left me time to visit.<br/>
<br/>
And now for Luxor, which in the epoch of<br/>
the Pharaohs was a suburb of the royal town,<br/>
and is still its port. It is there, it seems, where<br/>
we must stop our dahabiya in order to proceed<br/>
to the fabulous palace which the rising sun has<br/>
just disclosed to us.<br/>
<br/>
And while my equipage of <span style="color: #0000FF;">bronze-intoning<br/>
</span>that song, as old as Egypt and everlastingly the<br/>
same, which seems to help the men in their<br/>
arduous work-is busy unfastening the chain<br/>
which binds us to the bank, I continue to watch<br/>
the distant apparition. It emerges gradually<br/>
from the light morning mists which, perhaps,<br/>
made it seem even larger than it is. The clear<br/>
light of the ascending sun shows it now in<br/>
detail; and reveals it as all battered, broken and<br/>
ruinous in the midst of a silent plain, on the<br/>
yellow carpet of the desert. And how this sun,<br/>
rising in its clear splendour, seems to crush it<br/>
