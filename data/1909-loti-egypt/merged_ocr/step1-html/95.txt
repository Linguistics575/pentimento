ness marks them all; the same detachment,<br/>
a preoccupation with the self-same dream. And<br/>
in the sky, to which they raise their eyes, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">heavens-framed </span>always by the battlements of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Azhar-are </span>almost white from the excess of<br/>
light, with a border of tall, red minarets, which<br/>
seem to be aglow with the reflection of some<br/>
great fire. And, watching them pass, all these<br/>
young priests or jurists, at once so different and<br/>
so alike, we understand better than before how<br/>
Islam, the old, old Islam, keeps still its cohesion<br/>
and its power.<br/>
<br/>
The mosque in which they pursue their studies<br/>
is now almost empty. In its restful twilight<br/>
there is silence, and the unexpected music of<br/>
little birds; it is the brooding season and the<br/>
ceilings of <span style="color: #0000FF;">carked </span>wood are full of nests, which<br/>
nobody disturbs.<br/>
<br/>
A world, this mosque, in which thousands of<br/>
people could easily find room. Some hundred<br/>
and fifty marble columns, brought from ancient<br/>
temples, support the arches of the seven parallel<br/>
aisles. There is no light save that which comes<br/>
through the arcade opening into the courtyard,<br/>
and it is so dark in the aisles at the far end<br/>
that we wonder again how the faithful can see<br/>
to read when the sun of Egypt happens to be<br/>
veiled.<br/>
