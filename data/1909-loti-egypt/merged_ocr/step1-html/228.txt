</span>might have seemed eternal, could come to suffer<br/>
such an utter ruin. Fragments of columns,<br/>
fragments of obelisks, broken by downfalls of<br/>
which the mere imagination is awful, heads and<br/>
head-dresses of giant divinities, all lie higgledypiggledy in a disorder beyond possible redress.<br/>
Nowhere surely on our earth does the sun in his<br/>
daily revolution <span style="color: #ff0000;">cast </span>his light on such debris as<br/>

It was even here, seven or eight thousand<br/>
years ago, under this pure crystal sky, that the<br/>
first awakening of human thought began. Our<br/>
Europe then was still sleeping, wrapped in the<br/>
mantle of its damp forests; sleeping that sleep<br/>
which still had thousands of years to run. Here,<br/>
. a precocious humanity, only recently emerged<br/>
from the Age of Stone, that earliest form of all,<br/>
an infant humanity, which saw massively on its<br/>
issue from the massiveness of the original matter,<br/>
conceived and built terrible sanctuaries for gods,<br/>
at first dreadful and vague, such as its nascent<br/>
reason allowed it to conceive them. Then the<br/>
first megalithic blocks were erected; then began<br/>
that mad heaping up and up, which was to last<br/>
nearly fifty centuries; and temples were built<br/>
above temples, palaces over palaces, each generation striving to outdo its predecessor by a more<br/>
titanic grandeur.<br/>
