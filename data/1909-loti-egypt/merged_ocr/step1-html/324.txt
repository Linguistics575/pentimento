<br/>
On this quay of Assouan, so carefully levelled,<br/>
defiles briskly a continual stream of fair travellers<br/>
ravishingly dressed as only those know how who<br/>
have made a tour with Cook & Son (Egypt<br/>
Ltd.). And along the Nile, in the shade of the<br/>
young trees, planted with the utmost nicety<br/>
and precision, the flower-beds and straight-cut<br/>
turf are protected <span style="color: #ff0000;">effieaciously </span>by means of <span style="color: #ff0000;">wirenetting </span>against certain acts of forgetfulness to<br/>
which dogs, alas, are only too much addicted.<br/>
<br/>
Here, too, everything is ticketed, everything<br/>
has its number<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>the donkeys, the donkey-drivers,<br/>
the stations even where they are allowed to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stand </span>--" Stand for six donkeys, stand for ten,<br/>
etc." Some very handsome camels, fitted with<br/>
riding saddles, wait also in their respective places<br/>
and a number of Cook ladies, meticulous on the<br/>
point of local colour, even when it is merely<br/>
a question of making some purchases in the<br/>
town, readily mount for some moments one or<br/>
other of these "ships of the desert."<br/>
<br/>
And at every fifty yards a policeman, still<br/>
Egyptian in his countenance, but quite English<br/>
in his bearing and costume, keeps a vigilant eye<br/>
on everything-would never suffer, for example,<br/>
that an eleventh donkey should dare to take a<br/>
place in a stand for ten, which was already full.<br/>
<br/>
Certain people, inclined to be critical, might<br/>
consider, perhaps, that these policemen were a<br/>
