would retire for the night without having first<br/>
prostrated himself before the majesty of Allah<br/>
--everything is of a mournful grey. Even the<br/>
costumes of the people are <span style="color: #0000FF;">dull-coloured </span>and<br/>
wretched-looking. It is an East grown poor<br/>
and old, although the sky remains as wonderful<br/>
as ever.<br/>
<br/>
But all this past grandeur has left its imprint<br/>
on the fellahs. They have a refinement of<br/>
appearance and manner, all unknown amongst<br/>
the majority of the good people of our villages.<br/>
And those amongst them who by good <span style="color: #0000FF;">for</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>tune become prosperous have forthwith a kind<br/>
of distinction, and seem to know, as if by birth,<br/>
how to dispense the gracious hospitality of an<br/>
aristocrat. The hospitality of even the <span style="color: #ff0000;">humblest<br/>
</span>preserves something of courtesy and ease, which<br/>
tells of breed. I remember those clear evenings<br/>
when, after the peaceful navigation of the day,<br/>
I used to stop and draw up my dahabiya to<br/>
the bank of the river. (I speak now of out-ofthe-way <span style="color: #0000FF;">places-free </span>as yet from the canker<br/>
of the tourist <span style="color: #0000FF;">element-such </span>as I habitually<br/>
chose.) It was in the twilight at the hour when<br/>
the stars began to shine out from the goldengreen sky. As soon as I put foot upon the<br/>
shore, and my arrival was signalled by the barking of the watchdogs, the chief of the nearest<br/>
hamlet always came to meet me. A dignified<br/>
