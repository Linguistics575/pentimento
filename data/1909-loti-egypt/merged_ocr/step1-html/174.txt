in profile too, although the bodies, on the<br/>

Many of the pictures represent King Seti,<br/>
drawn without doubt from life, for they show<br/>
us almost the very features of his mummy, exhibited now in the museum at Cairo. At his<br/>
side he holds affectionately his son, the princeroyal, Ramses (later on Ramses II., the great<br/>
Sesostris of the Greeks). They have given the<br/>
latter quite a frank air, and he wears a curl on<br/>
the side of his head, as was the fashion then in<br/>
childhood. He, also, has his mummy in a glass<br/>
case in the museum, and anyone who has seen<br/>

attained the age of nearly a hundred years<br/>
before death delivered him to the embalmers of<br/>
Thebes, will find it <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to believe that he<br/>
could ever have been young, and worn his hair<br/>
curled so; that he could even have played and<br/>
been a child.<br/>
