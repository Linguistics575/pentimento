<span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">14 </span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
this last sanctuary shut off thus from the people<br/>
comes the vague sound of singing; from time to<br/>
time a priest raises a faded silk curtain and from<br/>
the threshold makes the sign of blessing. His<br/>
vestments are of gold, and he wears a golden<br/>
crown, but the humble faithful speak to him<br/>
freely, and even touch his gorgeous garments,<br/>
that might be those of one of the Wise Kings.<br/>
He smiles, and letting fall the curtain, which<br/>
covers the entrance to the tabernacle, disappears<br/>
again into his innocent mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Even the least things here tell of decay. The<br/>
flagstones, trodden by the feet of numberless<br/>
dead generations, are become uneven through the<br/>
settling of the soil. Everything is askew, bent,<br/>
dusty and worn-out. The daylight comes from<br/>
above, through narrow barred windows. There<br/>
is a lack of air, so that one almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">stifles</span>. But<br/>
though the sun does not enter, a certain indefinable <span style="color: #ff0000;">1zefleetion </span>from the whitened walls<br/>
reminds us that outside there is a flaming,<br/>
resplendent Eastern spring.<br/>
<br/>
In this, the old grandfather, as it were, of<br/>
churches, filled now with a cloud of odorous<br/>
smoke, what one hears, more even than the<br/>
chanting of the mass, is the ceaseless movement,<br/>
the pious agitation of the faithful; and more<br/>
even than that, the startling noise that rises<br/>
from the holy crypt below-the sharp clashing<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
