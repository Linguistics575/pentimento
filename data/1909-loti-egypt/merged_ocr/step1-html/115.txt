<span>In the Tombs of the Apis 85<br/>
<br/>
flagstones, passing obelisks, fallen blocks of<br/>
stone and other gigantic debris, in a heat that<br/>
continually increases.<br/>
<br/>
At last the principal artery of the hypogeum<br/>
appears, a thoroughfare more than five hundred<br/>
yards long, cut in the rock, where the Bedouins<br/>
have prepared for us the customary feeble<br/>
light.<br/>
<br/>
It is a place of fearful aspect. As soon as one<br/>
enters one is seized by the sense of a mournfulness beyond words, by an oppression as of<br/>
something too heavy, too crushing, almost<br/>
superhuman. The impotent little flames of the<br/>
candles, placed in a row, in groups of fifty, on<br/>
tripods of wood from one end of the route to the<br/>
other, show on the right and left of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">immense </span>avenue rectangular sepulchral caverns,<br/>
containing each a black <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffin</span>, but a <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffin </span>as<br/>
if for a mastodon. And all these <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoifins</span>, so<br/>
sombre and so alike, are square shaped too,<br/>
severely simple like so many boxes; but<br/>
made out of a single block of rare granite that<br/>
gleams like marble. They are entirely without<br/>
ornament. It is necessary to look closely<br/>
to distinguish on the smooth walls the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic </span>inscriptions, the rows of little figures,<br/>
little owls, little jackals, that tell in a lost<br/>
language the history of ancient peoples. Here<br/>
is the signature of King Amasis; beyond, that<br/>
