either side of a portico or an avenue. But they<br/>
did not invent the vault. And therefore, since<br/>
there was a limit to the size of the stones which<br/>
they were able to place flat like beams, they had<br/>
recourse to this profusion of columns to support<br/>
their stupendous ceilings. And thus it is that<br/>
there seems to be a want of air, that one seems to<br/>
stifle in the middle of their temples, dominated<br/>
and obstructed as they are by the rigid presence<br/>
of so many stones. And yet to-day you can see<br/>
quite clearly in these temples, for, since the suspended rocks which served for roof have fallen,<br/>
floods of light descend from all parts. But<br/>
formerly, when a kind of half night reigned in<br/>
the deep halls, beneath the immovable carapaces<br/>
of sandstone or granite, how oppressive and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulchral </span>it must all have been-how final and<br/>
pitiless, like a gigantic palace of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Death</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>On one<br/>
day, however, in each year, here at Thebes, a light<br/>
as of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonflagration </span>used to penetrate from one<br/>
end to the other of the sanctuaries of Amen; for<br/>
the middle <span style="color: #0000FF;">artery </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>open towards the north-west,<br/>
and is aligned in such a fashion that, once a<br/>
year, one solitary time, on the evening of the<br/>
summer solstice, the sun as it sets is able to<br/>
plunge its <span style="color: #0000FF;">reddened </span>rays straight into the<br/>
sanctuaries. At the moment when it enlarges<br/>
its blood-coloured disc before descending behind the desolation of the Libyan mountains,<br/>
