<span>I 8 8 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
within which we are immured--<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>in such<br/>
terrible <span style="color: #0000FF;">company-put </span>out everything save the<br/>
point of an old neighbouring minaret which shows<br/>
now against the blue of the sky<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>a humble graft<br/>
of Islam which grew here amongst the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins<br/>
</span>some centuries ago, when the ruins themselves<br/>
had already subsisted for three thousand years--<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little mosque built on a mass of debris, which<br/>
it now protects with its inviolability. How many<br/>
treasures and relies and documents are hidden<br/>
and guarded by this mosque of the peristyle!<br/>
For none would dare to dig in the ground within<br/>
its sacred walls.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually the silence of the temple becomes<br/>
profound. And if the shortened shadows betray<br/>
the hour of noon, there is nothing to tell to what<br/>
millennium that hour belongs. The silences and<br/>
middays like to this, which have passed before<br/>
the eyes of these giants ambushed in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades-who </span>could count them?<br/>
<br/>
High above us, lost in the incandescent blue,<br/>
soar the birds of <span style="color: #0000FF;">prey-and </span>they were there in the<br/>
times of the Pharaohs, <span style="color: #ff0000;">displayingin </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">airidentical </span>plumages, uttering the same cries. The beasts<br/>
and plants, in the course of time, have varied less<br/>
than men, and remain unchanged in the smallest<br/>
details.<br/>
<br/>
Each of the colossi around me-standing<br/>
there proudly with one leg advanced as if for a<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
