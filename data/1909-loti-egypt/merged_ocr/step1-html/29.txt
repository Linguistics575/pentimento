thing for the benefit of the uninitiated under the<br/>
form of awe-inspiring figures of the gods; and it<br/>
may be, perhaps, that, after having meditated so<br/>
deeply in the shadow of their temples, and sought<br/>
so long the everlasting wherefore of life and<br/>
death, they wished simply to sum up in the smile<br/>
of these closed lips the vanity of the most profound of our human speculations.... It is said<br/>
that the Sphinx was once of striking beauty,<br/>
when harmonious contour and colouring animated the face, and it was enthroned at its full<br/>
height <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>a kind of <span style="color: #ff0000;">csplanade </span>paved with long<br/>
slabs of stone. But was it then more sovereign<br/>
than it is to-night in its last decrepitude?<br/>
Almost buried beneath the sand of the Libyan<br/>
desert, which now quite hides its base, it rises at<br/>
this hour like a phantom which nothing solid<br/>
sustains in the air.<br/>

tourists of the evening have disappeared; to<br/>
regain perhaps the neighbouring hotel, where<br/>
the orchestra doubtless has not ceased to rage;<br/>
or may be, remounting their cars, to join, in<br/>
some club of Cairo, one of those bridge parties,<br/>
in which the really superior intellects of our time<br/>
delight; some-the stouthearted <span style="color: #0000FF;">ones-departed<br/>
</span>talking loudly and with cigar in mouth; others,<br/>
however, daunted in spite of themselves, lowered<br/>
