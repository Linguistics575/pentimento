<span>Thebes by Night 209<br/>
<br/>
For the first few moments, indeed, you might<br/>
imagine that it was going to be an ordinary night<br/>
such as we know in our climate, and a sense of<br/>
uneasiness takes hold of you in the midst of this<br/>
confusion of enormous stones, which in the darkness would become a quite inextricable maze.<br/>
Oh! the horror of being lost in these ruins of<br/>
Thebes and not being able to <span style="color: #0000FF;">see</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>But in the<br/>
event the air preserved its transparency to such<br/>
a degree, and the stars began soon to scintillate<br/>
so brightly that the surrounding things could<br/>
be distinguished almost as well as in the daytime.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, now that the time of transition between<br/>
the day and night has passed, the eyes grow accustomed to the strange, blue, persistent clearness so that you seem suddenly to have acquired<br/>
the pupils of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">eat</span>; and the ultimate effect is<br/>
merely as if you saw through a smoked glass<br/>
which changed all the various shades of this<br/>
reddish-coloured country into one uniform tint<br/>
of blue.<br/>
<br/>
Behold me then, for some two <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>three hours,<br/>
alone among the temples of the Pharaohs. The<br/>
tourists, whom the carriages and donkeys are at<br/>
this moment taking back to the hotels of Luxor,<br/>
will not return till very late, when the full moon<br/>
will have risen and be shedding its clear <span style="color: #0000FF;">light<br/>
</span>upon the ruins. My post, while I waited, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
<br/>
</span>o<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
