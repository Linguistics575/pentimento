<br/>
soil, where men laboured in centuries that have<br/>
drifted out of knowledge. One divines instinctively and at once the catacombs, the hypogea<br/>
and the mummies that lie beneath!<br/>
<br/>
These <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropoles </span>of Abydos <span style="color: #0000FF;">once-and </span>for<br/>
thousands of years-exercised an extraordinary<br/>
fascination over this <span style="color: #ff0000;">people-she </span>precursor of<br/>
peoples-who dwelt in the valley of the Nile.<br/>
According to one of the most ancient of human<br/>
traditions, the head of Osiris, the lord of the<br/>
other world, reposed in the depths of one of the<br/>
temples" which to-day are buried in the sands.<br/>
And men, as soon as their thought commenced<br/>
to issue from the primeval night, were haunted<br/>
by the idea that there were localities helpful,<br/>
as it were, to the poor corpses that lay beneath<br/>
the earth, that there were certain holy places<br/>
where it <span style="color: #0000FF;">behaved </span>them to be buried if they<br/>
wished to be ready when the signal of awakening<br/>
was given. And in old Egypt, therefore, each<br/>
one, at the hour of death, turned his thoughts<br/>
to these stones and sands, in the ardent hope that<br/>
he might be able to sleep near the remains of<br/>
his god. And when the place was becoming<br/>
crowded with sleepers, those who could obtain<br/>
no place there conceived the idea of having<br/>
humble obelisks planted on the holy ground,<br/>
which at least should tell their names; or even<br/>
recommended that their mummies might lie<br/>
<br/>
