<span>CHAPTER XIX<br/>
A TOWN PROMPTLY EMBELLISHED<br/>
<br/>
EIGHT years and a line of railway have <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficed<br/>
</span>to accomplish its metamorphosis. Once in<br/>
Upper Egypt, on the borders of Nubia, there<br/>
was a little humble town, rarely visited, and<br/>
wanting, it must be owned, in elegance and even<br/>
in comfort.<br/>
<br/>
Not that it was without picturesqueness and<br/>
historical interest. Quite the contrary. The<br/>
Nile, charged with the waters of equatorial<br/>
Africa, flung itself close by from the height of a<br/>
mass of black granite, in a majestic cataract;<br/>
and then, before the little Arab houses, became<br/>
suddenly calm again, and flowed between islets<br/>
of fresh verdure where clusters of palm-trees<br/>
swayed their plumes in the wind.<br/>
<br/>
And around were a number of temples, of<br/>
hypogea, of Roman ruins, of ruins of churches<br/>
dating from the first centuries of Christianity.<br/>
The ground was full of souvenirs of the great<br/>
primitive civilisations. For the place, abandoned<br/>
for ages and lulled in the folds of Islam under<br/>
the guardianship of its white mosque, was once<br/>
one of the centres of the life of the world.<br/>
