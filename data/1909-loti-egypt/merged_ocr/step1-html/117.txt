<br/>
then, groping his way, to plunder the sacred<br/>
mummy.<br/>
<br/>
What strikes us most of all in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal<br/>
</span>hypogeum is the meeting there, in the middle<br/>
of the stairway by which we leave, with yet<br/>
another black coffin, which lies across our path<br/>
as if to bar it<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It is as monstrous and as simple<br/>
as the others, its seniors, which many centuries<br/>
before, as the deified bulls died, had commenced<br/>
to line the great straight thoroughfare. But this<br/>
one has never reached its place and never held<br/>
its mummy. It was the last. Even while men<br/>
were slowly rolling it, with tense muscles and<br/>
panting cries, towards what might well have<br/>
seemed its eternal chamber, other gods were<br/>
born, and the cult of the Apis had come to an<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">end-suddenly</span>, then and <span style="color: #0000FF;">there</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>Such a fate may<br/>
happen indeed to each and all of the religions<br/>
and institutions of men, even to those most<br/>
deeply rooted in their hearts and their ancestral<br/>
past.... That perhaps is the most disturbing<br/>
of all our positive <span style="color: #0000FF;">notions </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>to know that there<br/>
will be a last of all things, not only a last temple,<br/>
and a last priest, but a last birth of a human<br/>
child, a last sunrise, a last day....<br/>
<br/>
In these hot catacombs we had forgotten the<br/>
cold wind that blew outside, and the physiognomy of the Memphite desert, the aspects of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
