cold showers. In the south and in the west,<br/>
at the extreme limits of the view, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span>upon<br/>
the misty horizon of the plains, appear two<br/>
gigantic triangles. They are Gizeh and<br/>
Memphis-the eternal pyramids.<br/>
<br/>
At the north of the town there is a corner<br/>
of the desert quite singular in its <span style="color: #0000FF;">character-of </span>the colour of bistre and of mummy-where<br/>
a whole colony of high cupolas, scattered at<br/>
random, still stand upright in the midst of sand<br/>
and desolate rocks. It is the proud cemetery of<br/>
the Mameluke Sultans, whose day was done in<br/>
the Middle Ages.<br/>
<br/>
But if one looks closely, what disorder, what<br/>
a mass of ruins there are in this town-still<br/>
a little <span style="color: #ff0000;">fairylike-beatcn </span>this evening by the<br/>
squalls of winter. The domes, the holy tombs,<br/>
the minarets and terraces, all are crumbling:<br/>
the hand of death is upon them all. But down<br/>
there, in the far distance, near to that silver<br/>
streak which meanders through the plains, and<br/>
which is the old Nile, the advent of new times<br/>
_ is proclaimed by the chimneys of factories,<br/>
impudently high, that disfigure everything, and<br/>
spout forth into the twilight thick clouds of<br/>
black smoke.<br/>
<br/>
The night is falling as we descend from the<br/>
esplanade to return to our lodgings.<br/>
<br/>
We have first to traverse the old town of<br/>
