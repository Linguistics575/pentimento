<br/>
Cairo, a maze of streets still full of charm,<br/>
wherein the thousand little lamps of the Arab<br/>
shops already shed their quiet light. Passing<br/>
through streets which twist at their caprice,<br/>
beneath overhanging balconies covered with<br/>
wooden trellis of exquisite workmanship, we<br/>
have to <span style="color: #0000FF;">slacken </span>speed in the midst of a dense<br/>
crowd of men and beasts. Close to us pass<br/>
women, veiled in black, gently mysterious<br/>
as in the olden times, and men of unmoved<br/>
gravity, in long robes and white draperies; and<br/>
little donkeys pompously <span style="color: #0000FF;">bedecked </span>in collars of<br/>

their loads of lucerne, which exhale the pleasant<br/>
fragrance of the fields. And when in the gathering gloom, which hides the signs of decay, there<br/>
appear suddenly, above the little houses, so<br/>
lavishly ornamented with <span style="color: #ff0000;">mushrabiyas </span>and arabesques, the tall aerial minarets, rising to a<br/>
prodigious height into the twilight sky, it is<br/>
still the adorable East.<br/>

rubbish <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>How present is the sense of <span style="color: #0000FF;">impending </span>dissolution! And what is <span style="color: #0000FF;">this</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>large pools<br/>
of water in the middle of the road! Granted<br/>
that there is more rain here than formerly, since<br/>
the valley of the Nile has been artificially<br/>
irrigated, it still seems almost impossible that<br/>
there should be all this black water, into which<br/>
