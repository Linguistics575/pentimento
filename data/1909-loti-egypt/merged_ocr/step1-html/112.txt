polis; if it does not surge and roll like some<br/>
enormous tidal wave, as it appears to do when<br/>
seen from the green valley below, it nevertheless<br/>
covers everything with an obstinate persistence<br/>
which has continued since the beginning of time.<br/>
Already at Memphis it has buried innumerable<br/>
statues and colossi and temples of the Sphinx.<br/>
It comes without a pause, from Libya, from the<br/>
Great Sahara, which contain enough to powder<br/>
the universe. It <span style="color: #ff0000;">harmonises </span>well with the tall<br/>
skeletons of the pyramids, which form immutable rocks on its always shifting extent; and if<br/>
one thinks of it, it gives a more thrilling sense of<br/>
anterior eternities even than all these Egyptian<br/>
ruins, which, in comparison with it, are things of<br/>
yesterday. The sand-the sand of the primitive <span style="color: #ff0000;">seas-illicit </span>represents a labour of erosion<br/>
of a duration impossible to conceive, and bears<br/>
witness to a continuity of destruction which, one<br/>
might say, had no beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Here, in the midst of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">solitude</span>, is a<br/>
humble habitation, old and half buried in sand,<br/>
at which we have to stop. It was once the<br/>
house of the Egyptologist Mariette, and still<br/>
shelters the director of the excavations, from<br/>
whom we have to obtain permission to descend<br/>
amongst the Apis. The whitewashed room in<br/>
which he receives us is encumbered with the<br/>
age-old debris which he is continually bringing<br/>
<br/>
