</span>niche, a little larger than those cut in the wall<br/>
to receive the tapers, a niche which covers the<br/>
ancient stone on which, according to tradition,<br/>
the Virgin Mary rested, with the child <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">esus</span>, in<br/>
the course of the flight into Egypt. This holy<br/>
stone is sadly worn to-day and polished smooth<br/>
by the touch of many pious hands, and the<br/>
Byzantine cross which once was carved on it<br/>
is almost effaced.<br/>
<br/>
But even if the Virgin had never rested there,<br/>
the humble crypt of St Sergius would remain<br/>
no less one of the oldest Christian sanctuaries in<br/>
the world. And the Copts who still assemble<br/>
there with veneration have preceded by many<br/>
years the greater part of our Western nations in<br/>
the religion of the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
Although the history of Egypt envelops itself<br/>
in a sort of night at the moment of the<br/>
appearance of Christianity, we know that the<br/>
growth of the new faith there was as rapid and<br/>
impetuous as the germination of plants under<br/>
the overflow of the Nile. The old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharaonic<br/>
</span>cults, amalgamated at that time with those of<br/>
Greece, were so obscured under a mass of rites<br/>
and formulae, that they had ceased to have any<br/>
meaning. And nevertheless here, as in imperial<br/>
Rome, there brooded the ferment of a passionate<br/>
mysticism. Moreover, this Egyptian people,<br/>
more than any other, was haunted by the terror<br/>
