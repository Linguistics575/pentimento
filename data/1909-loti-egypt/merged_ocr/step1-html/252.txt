<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">moon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>Suddenly the stones of the<br/>
summit, the copings, the formidable friezes, are<br/>
lighted by rays of clear light, and here and there,<br/>
on the bas-reliefs encircling the pillars, appear<br/>
luminous trails which reveal the gods and<br/>
goddesses engraved in the stone. They were<br/>
watching in myriads around me, as I knew well,<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-coifed</span>, all of them, in discs or great horns.<br/>
They stare at one another with their arms raised,<br/>
spreading out their long fingers in an eager<br/>
attempt at conversation. They are numberless,<br/>
these eternally gesticulating gods. Wherever<br/>
you look their forms are multiplied with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">stupefying </span>repetition. They seem to have some<br/>
mysterious secret to convey to one another, but<br/>
have perforce to remain silent, and for all the<br/>
expressiveness of their attitudes their hands do<br/>
not move. And hieroglyphs, too, repeated to<br/>
infinity, envelop you on all sides like a multiple<br/>
woof of mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Minute by minute now, everything amongst<br/>
these rigid dead things grows more precise. Cold,<br/>
hard rays penetrate through the immense ruin,<br/>
separating with a sharp incisiveness the light<br/>
from the shadows. The feeling that these<br/>
stones, wearied as they were with their long<br/>
duration, might still be thoughtful, still mindful<br/>
of their past, grows less-less than it was a few<br/>
<br/>
