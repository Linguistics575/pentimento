<br/>
Assouan possesses also its little Oriental<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">bazaar-m </span>little improvised, a little new perhaps;<br/>
but then one, at least, was needed, and that as<br/>
quickly as possible, in order that nothing might<br/>
be wanting to the tourists.<br/>
<br/>
The shopkeepers have contrived to provision<br/>
themselves (in the leading shops, under the<br/>
arcades of the Rue de Rivoli) with as much<br/>
tact as good taste, and the Cook ladies have<br/>
the innocent illusion of making bargains every<br/>
day. One may even buy there, hung up by<br/>
the tail, stuffed with straw and looking extremely real, the last crocodiles of Egypt, which,<br/>
particularly at the end of the season, may be<br/>
had at very advantageous prices.<br/>
<br/>
Even the old Nile has allowed itself to be<br/>
fretted and brought up to date in the progress of<br/>
evolution.<br/>
<br/>
First, the women, draped in black veils,<br/>
who come daily to draw the precious water,<br/>
have forsaken the fragile amphorae of baked<br/>
earth, which had come to them from barbarous<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">times-and </span>which the Orientalists grossly abused<br/>
in their pictures; and in their stead have taken<br/>
to old tin oil-cans, placed at their disposal by<br/>
the kindness of the big hotels. But they carry<br/>
them in the same easy graceful manner as erstwhile the discarded pottery, and without losing<br/>
in the least the gracious tanagrine outline.<br/>
