<span>CHAPTER XVI<br/>
THEBES IN SUNLIGHT<br/>
<br/>
IT is two o'elock in the afternoon. A white<br/>
angry fire pours from the sky, which is pale from<br/>
excess of light. A sun <span style="color: #0000FF;">inimical </span>to the men of<br/>
our climate <span style="color: #0000FF;">scorches </span>the enormous fossil <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>,<br/>
crumbling in places, is all that remains of Thebes<br/>
and which lies there like the carcass of a gigantic<br/>
beast that has been dead for thousands of years,<br/>
but is too massive ever to be annihilated.<br/>
<br/>
In the hypostyle there is a little blue shade<br/>
behind the monstrous pillars, but even that shade<br/>
is dusty and hot. The columns too are hot, and<br/>
so are all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">blocks-Hand </span>yet it is winter and<br/>
the nights are cold, even to the point of frost.<br/>
Heat and dust; a reddish dust, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>hangs<br/>
like an eternal cloud over these ruins of Upper<br/>
Egypt, exhaling an odour of spices and mummy.<br/>
<br/>
The great heat seems to augment the retrospective sensation of fatigue which seizes you as<br/>
you regard these stones-too heavy for human<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">strength-which </span>are massed here in mountains.<br/>
One almost seems to participate in the efforts,<br/>
the exhaustions and the sweating toils of that<br/>
people, with their muscles of brand new steel,<br/>
