<span>CHAPTER X<br/>
A CHARMING LUNCHEON<br/>
<br/>
WE are making our way through the fields of<br/>
Abydos in the dazzling splendour of the forenoon,<br/>
having come, like so many pilgrims of old, from<br/>
the banks of the Nile to visit the sanctuaries of<br/>
Osiris, which lie beyond the green plains, on the<br/>
edge of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
It is a journey of some ten miles <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>so, under<br/>
a clear sky and a burning sun. We pass through<br/>
fields of corn and lucerne, whose wonderful<br/>
green is piqued with little flowers, such as may<br/>
be seen in our climate. Hundreds of little birds<br/>
sing to us distractedly of the joy of life; the sun<br/>
shines radiantly, magnificently; the impetuous<br/>
corn is already in the ear; it might be some gay<br/>
pageant of our days of May. One forgets that<br/>
it is February, that we are still in the winter<br/>
--the luminous winter of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Here and there amongst the outspread fields<br/>
are villages buried under the thick foliage of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">trees-under </span>acacias which, in the distance,<br/>
resemble ours at home; beyond indeed the<br/>
mountain chain of Libya, like a wall <span style="color: #0000FF;">confining<br/>
</span>the fertile fields, looks strange perhaps in its<br/>
