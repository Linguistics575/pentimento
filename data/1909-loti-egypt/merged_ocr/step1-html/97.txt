dains to eat, or who, maybe, has no bread; who,<br/>
when his sweeping is done, reseats himself on his<br/>
mat, and, opening his Koran, commences to read<br/>
aloud with the customary intonation. His voice,<br/>
rich and facile, and moderated with discretion,<br/>
has a charm that is irresistible in the sonorous<br/>
old mosque, where at this hour the only other<br/>
sound is the scarcely perceptible twittering of the<br/>
little broods above, among the dull gold beams of<br/>
the ceiling. Those who have been familiar with<br/>
the sanctuaries of Islam know, as well as I, that<br/>
there is no book so exquisitely rhythmical as<br/>
that of the Prophet. Even if the sense of the<br/>
verses escape you, the chanted reading, which<br/>
forms part of certain of the offices, acts upon<br/>
you by the simple magic of its sounds, in the<br/>
same way as the oratorios which draw tears in<br/>
the churches of Christ. Rising and falling like<br/>
some sad lullaby, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">declamation </span>of this young<br/>
priest, with his face of visionary, and garb of<br/>
decent poverty, swells involuntarily, till gradually it seems to fill the seven deserted aisles of<br/>
El-Azhar.<br/>
<br/>
We stop in spite of ourselves, and listen, in<br/>
the midst of the silence of midday. And in this<br/>
so venerable place, where dilapidation and the<br/>
usury of centuries are revealed on every <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-even </span>on the marble columns worn by the constant<br/>
friction of <span style="color: #ff0000;">l1ands-this </span>voice of gold that rises<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
