<span>20 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
are people on their knees, little groups in robe<br/>
and turban, scattered fortuitously upon the red<br/>
of the carpets, and almost lost in the midst of<br/>
the sumptuous solitude.<br/>
<br/>
In an obscure corner lies Mehemet Ali,<br/>
the prince adventurous and chivalrous as some<br/>
legendary hero, and withal one of the greatest<br/>
sovereigns of modern history. There he lies<br/>
behind a grating of gold, of complicated design,<br/>
in that Turkish style, already decadent, but still<br/>
so beautiful, which was that of his epoch.<br/>
<br/>
Through the golden bars may be seen in the<br/>
shadow the <span style="color: #0000FF;">catafalque </span>of state, in three tiers,<br/>
covered with blue brocades, exquisitely faded,<br/>
and profusely embroidered with dull gold. Two<br/>
long green palms freshly cut from some <span style="color: #ff0000;">datetree </span>in the neighbourhood are crossed before<br/>
the door of this sort of funeral enclosure. And<br/>
it seems that around us is an inviolable religious<br/>
peace....<br/>
<br/>
But all at once there comes a noisy chattering<br/>
in a Teutonic tongue--<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>shouts and <span style="color: #0000FF;">laughs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
</span>... How is it possible, so near to the great<br/>
dead?... And there enters a group of tourists,<br/>
dressed more or less in the approved "smart "<br/>
style. A guide, with a droll countenance,<br/>
recites to them the beauties of the place,<br/>
bellowing at the top of his voice like a showman at a fair. And one of the travellers,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
