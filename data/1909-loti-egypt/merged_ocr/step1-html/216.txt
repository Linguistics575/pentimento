<br/>
In a line with the Winter Palace a number of<br/>
stalls follow one another. All those things with<br/>
which our tourists are wont to array themselves<br/>
are on sale there<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>fans, fly flaps, helmets and<br/>
blue spectacles. And, in thousands, photographs<br/>
of the ruins. And there too are the toys, the<br/>
souvenirs of the Soudan: old negro knives,<br/>
panther-skins and gazelle horns. Numbers of<br/>
Indians even are come to this improvised fair,<br/>
bringing their stuffs from Rajputana and Cashmere. And, above all, there are dealers in<br/>
mummies, offering for sale mysteriously shaped<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eoffins</span>, mummy-cloths, dead hands, gods,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">scarabai</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the thousand and one things that<br/>
this old soil has yielded for centuries like an<br/>
inexhaustible mine.<br/>
<br/>
Along the stalls, keeping in the shade of the<br/>
houses and the scattered palms, pass <span style="color: #0000FF;">representatives </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">plutocracy </span>of the world. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dressed<br/>
</span>by the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">costumiers</span>, bedecked in the same<br/>
plumes, and with faces reddened by the same<br/>
sun, the millionaire daughters of Chicago<br/>
merchants elbow their sisters of the old nobility.<br/>
Pressing amongst them impudent young<br/>
Bedouins pester the fair travellers to mount their<br/>
saddled donkeys. And as if they were charged<br/>
to add to this babel a note of beauty, the<br/>
battalions of Mr Cook, of both sexes, and<br/>
always in a hurry, pass by with long strides.<br/>
