<span>CHAPTER VI<br/>
IN THE TOMBS OF THE APIS<br/>
<br/>
THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">dwelling-places </span>of the Apis, in the grim<br/>
darkness beneath the Memphite desert, are, as<br/>
all the world knows, monster <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>of black<br/>
granite ranged in catacombs, hot and stifling as<br/>
eternal stoves.<br/>
<br/>
To reach them from the banks of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>we<br/>
have first to traverse the low region which the inundations of the ancient river, regularly repeated<br/>
since the beginning of time, have rendered propitious to the growth of plants and to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">development </span>of men; an hour or two's journey, this<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">evening </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">through </span>forests <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">date-trees </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beauti..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ful </span>palms temper the light of the March sun, which<br/>
is now half veiled in clouds and already declining.<br/>
In the distance herds are grazing in the cool shade.<br/>
And we meet fellahs leading back from the field<br/>
towards the village on the river-bank their little<br/>
donkeys, laden with sheaves of corn. The air<br/>
is mild and wholesome under the high tufts of<br/>
these endless green plumes, which move in the<br/>
warm wind almost without noise. We seem to<br/>
be in some happy land, where the pastoral life<br/>
should be easy, and even a little paradisaical.<br/>
