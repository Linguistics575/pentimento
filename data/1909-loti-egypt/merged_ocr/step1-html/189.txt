</span>or three poor fields of corn, lying right on the<br/>
water's edge, behind which the dead stones and<br/>
the dead sands commence at once. And sometimes, even, the desert chain closes in so as to<br/>
overhang the river with its reddish-white cliffs,<br/>
which no rain ever comes to freshen, and in<br/>
which, at different heights, gape the square holes<br/>
leading to the habitations of the mummies.<br/>
These mountains, which in the distance look so<br/>
beautiful in their rose-colour, and make, as it <span style="color: #0000FF;">N<br/>
</span>were, interminable <span style="color: #0000FF;">back-cloths </span>to all that happens on the river banks, were perforated, during<br/>
some 5000 years, for the introduction of sarcophagi and now they swarm with old <span style="color: #0000FF;">dead<br/>

black robes who come without ceasing to fill<br/>
their <span style="color: #ff0000;">longmecked </span>jars and carry them away<br/>
balanced on their veiled heads. Then the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flocks<br/>
</span>which shepherds, draped in mourning, bring to<br/>
the river to drink, goats and sheep and asses all<br/>
mixed up together. And then the buffaloes,<br/>
massive and mud-coloured, who descend calmly<br/>
to bathe. And, finally, the great labour of the<br/>
watering<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>the traditional noria, turned by a little<br/>
bull with bandaged eyes and, above all, the<br/>
