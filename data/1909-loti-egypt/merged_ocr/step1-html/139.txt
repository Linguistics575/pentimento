</span>transformation, upon whose ancient soil will<br/>
shortly appear numbers of these modern horrors,<br/>
in mud and <span style="color: #0000FF;">metal-factories </span>or large <span style="color: #0000FF;">hotels</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>multiply in this poor land with a<br/>
stupefying rapidity. Then comes a mile or so<br/>
of uncultivated ground, mixed with stretches of<br/>
sand, and already a little desertlike. And then<br/>
the walls of Old Cairo; after which begins the<br/>
peace of the deserted houses, of little gardens<br/>
and orchards among the ruins. The wind and<br/>
the dust beset us the whole way, the almost<br/>
eternal wind and the eternal dust of this land, by<br/>
which, since the beginning of the ages, so many<br/>
human eyes have been burnt beyond recovery.<br/>
They keep us now in blinding whirlwinds, which<br/>
swarm with flies. The "<span style="color: #0000FF;">season </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>indeed is<br/>
already over, and the foreign invaders have<br/>
fled until next autumn. Egypt is now more<br/>
Egyptian, beneath a more burning sky. The<br/>
sun of this Easter Sunday is as hot as ours of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">uly</span>, and the ground seems as if it would perish<br/>
of drought. But it is always thus in the springtime of this rainless country; the trees, which<br/>
have kept their leaves throughout the winter,<br/>
shed them in April as ours do in November.<br/>
There is no shade anywhere and everything<br/>
suffers. Everything grows yellow on the yellow<br/>
sands. But there is no cause for uneasiness:<br/>
the inundation is at hand, which has never failed<br/>
