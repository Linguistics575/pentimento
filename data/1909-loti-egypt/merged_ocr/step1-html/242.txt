<span>208 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
night on which the moon rises late and then,<br/>
having entered before the close of the day, to<br/>
escape the notice of the Bedouin guards who<br/>
shut the gates at nightfall. Thus have I<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">manaeuvred </span>to-day, and undisturbed, watching<br/>
from a hiding-place on high, I have waited with<br/>
the patience of a stone Osiris, till the grand<br/>
transformation scene of the setting of the sun<br/>
was played out once more upon the ruins.<br/>
Thebes, which, during the day, is almost animate<br/>
by reason of the presence of the visitors and the<br/>
gangs of fellahs who, singing the while, are busy<br/>
at the diggings and the clearing away of the<br/>
rubbish, has emptied itself little by little, while<br/>
the blue shadows were mounting from the base of<br/>
the monstrous sanctuaries. I watched the people<br/>
moving in a long row, like a trail of ants, towards<br/>
the western gate between the pylons of the<br/>
Ptolemies, and the last of them had disappeared<br/>
before the rosy light died away on the topmost<br/>
points of the obelisks.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed as if the silence and the night arrived together from beyond the Arabian desert,<br/>
advanced together across the plain, spreading<br/>
out like a rapid oil-stain; then gained the town<br/>
from east to west, and rose rapidly from the<br/>
ground to the very summits of the temples.<br/>
And this march of the darkness was infinitely<br/>
solemn.<br/>
<br/>
