ruins, the beginning of the desert nothingness.<br/>
Time-worn and uncrowned, but stiff and upright<br/>
still, they seem to be set there so solidly that<br/>
nothing could ever overthrow them. The two<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statues which guard them on the right<br/>
and left are seated on thrones. One, that on the<br/>
eastern side, has almost disappeared. But the<br/>
other stands out entire and white, with the whiteness of marble, against the brown-coloured background of the enormous stretch of wall covered<br/>
with hieroglyphs. His face alone has been mutilated; and he preserves still his imperious chin,<br/>
his ears, his Sphinx's headgear, one might almost<br/>
say his meditative expression, before this deployment of the vast solitude which seems to begin<br/>
at his <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>feet.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">cat-headed </span>goddesses extends farther still to the<br/>
old gates of the town; albeit you can scarcely<br/>
distinguish it between the double row of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kriosphinxes </span>all broken and well-nigh buried.<br/>
<br/>
The day falls, and the dust of Egypt, in<br/>
accordance with its invariable practice every<br/>
evening, begins to resemble in the distance a<br/>
powder of gold. I look behind me from time to<br/>
time at the giant who watches me, seated at the<br/>
