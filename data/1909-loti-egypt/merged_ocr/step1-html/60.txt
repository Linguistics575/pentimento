outer world. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Palm-trees</span>, which have grown<br/>
there for some hundred years perhaps, rise from<br/>
the ground, either separately <span style="color: #ff0000;">01</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>in superb<br/>
clusters, and temper the light of the always hot<br/>
sun on the rose-trees and the flowering hibiscus.<br/>
There is no noise in the gardens, any more than<br/>
in the Cloisters, for people walk there in sandals<br/>
and with measured tread. And there are Edens,<br/>
too, for the birds, who live and sing therein in<br/>
complete security, even during the services,<br/>
attracted by the little troughs which the imams<br/>
fill for their benefit each morning with water<br/>
from the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
As for the mosque itself it is rarely closed on<br/>
all sides as are those in the countries of the more<br/>
sombre Islam of the north. Here in Egypt<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">since </span>there is no real winter and scarcely ever<br/>
any rain-one of the sides of the mosque is left<br/>
completely open to the garden; and the sanctuary is separated from the verdure and the roses<br/>
only by a simple <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>. Thus the faithful<br/>
grouped beneath the palm-trees can pray there<br/>
equally as well as in the interior of the mosque,<br/>
since they can see, between the arches, the<br/>
holy Mihrab.1<br/>
<br/>
1 The Mihrab is a kind of portico indicating the direction<br/>
of Mecca. It is placed at the end of each mosque, as the<br/>
altar is in our churches, and the faithful are supposed to face<br/>
it when they pray.<br/>
