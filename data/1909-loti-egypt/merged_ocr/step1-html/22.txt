<br/>
dance; and sick people, in search of purer air;<br/>
and consumptive English maidens<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and ancient<br/>
English dames, a little the worse for wear, who<br/>
bring their rheumatisms for the treatment of the<br/>
dry winds.<br/>
<br/>
Passing on our way hither, we had seen this<br/>
road and this hotel and these people in the glare<br/>
of the electric lights, and from an orchestra that<br/>
was playing there we caught the trivial air of a<br/>
popular refrain of the music halls; but when in<br/>
a dip of the ground all this had disappeared,<br/>
what a sense of deliverance possessed us, how<br/>
far off this turmoil seemed! As soon as we<br/>
commenced to tread upon the sand of centuries,<br/>
where all at once our footsteps made no sound,<br/>
nothing seemed to have existence, save only the<br/>
great calm and the religious awe of this world<br/>
into which we were come, of this world with its<br/>
so crushing commentary upon our own, where<br/>
all seemed silent, undefined, gigantic <span style="color: #ff0000;">andsuffused<br/>
</span>with rose-colour.<br/>
<br/>
And first there is the pyramid of Cheops,<br/>
whose immutable base we had to skirt on our<br/>
way hither. In the moonlight we could see the<br/>
separate blocks, so enormous, so regular, so even<br/>
in their layers, which lie one above the other<br/>
to infinity, getting ever smaller and smaller, and<br/>
mounting, mounting in diminishing perspective,<br/>
until at last high up they form the apex <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
