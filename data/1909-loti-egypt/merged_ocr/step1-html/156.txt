<span>I 26 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
man, in a long robe of striped silk or modest<br/>
blue cotton, he accosted me with formulae of<br/>
welcome quite in the grand manner; insisted on<br/>
my following him to his house of dried mud; and<br/>
there, escorting me, after the exchange of further<br/>
compliments, to the place of honour on the poor<br/>
divan of his lodging, forced me to accept the<br/>
traditional cup of Arab coffee.<br/>
<br/>
To wake these fellahs from their strange sleep,<br/>
to open their eyes at last, and to transform them<br/>
by a modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">education-that </span>is the task which<br/>
nowadays a select band of Egyptian patriots is<br/>
desirous of attempting. Not long ago, such an<br/>
endeavour would have seemed to me a crime;<br/>
for these stubborn peasants were living under<br/>
conditions of the least suffering, rich in faith<br/>
and poor in desire. But to-day they are suffering<br/>
from an invasion more undermining, more dangerous than that of the conquerors who killed<br/>
by sword and fire. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Occidentals </span>are there,<br/>
everywhere, amongst them, profiting by their<br/>
meek passivity to turn them into slaves for<br/>
their business and their pleasure. The work of<br/>
degradation of these simpletons is so easy<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>men<br/>
bring them new desires, new greeds, new needs,<br/>
---and rob them of their prayers.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, it is time perhaps to wake them from<br/>
their sleep of more than twenty centuries, to put<br/>
<br/>
