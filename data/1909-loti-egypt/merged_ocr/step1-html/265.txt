<span>Thebes in Sunlight 231<br/>
<br/>
It is well known, of course, that Thebes used<br/>
to extend for a considerable distance both on<br/>
this, the right, bank of the Nile, where the<br/>
Pharaohs resided, and opposite, on the Libyan<br/>
bank, given over to the preparers of mummies<br/>
and to the mortuary temples. But to-day,<br/>
except for the great palaces of the centre, it<br/>
is little more than a litter of ruins, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>avenues, lined with endless rows of sphinxes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span>' rams, are lost, goodness knows where, buried<br/>
beneath the sand.<br/>
<br/>
At wide intervals, however, in the midst of<br/>
these cemeteries of things, a temple here and<br/>
there remains upright, preserving still its sanctified gloom beneath its cavernous carapace. One,<br/>
where certain celebrated oracles used to be<br/>
delivered, is even more prisonlike and sepulchral<br/>
than the others in its eternal shadow. High up<br/>
in a wall the black hole of a kind of grotto<br/>
opens, to which a secret corridor coming from<br/>
the depths used to lead. It was there that the<br/>
face of the priest charged with the announcement<br/>
of the sibylline words appeared-and the ceiling<br/>
of his niche is all covered still with the smoke<br/>
from the flame of his lamp, which was extinguished more than two thousand years ago!<br/>
<br/>
What a number of ruins, scarcely merging<br/>
from the sand of the desert, are hereabout!<br/>
