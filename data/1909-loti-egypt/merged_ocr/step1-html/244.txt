<span>2 IO Egypt<br/>
<br/>
high up among the ruins on the margin of the<br/>
sacred Lake of Osiris, the still and enclosed water<br/>
of which is astonishing in that it has remained<br/>
there for so many centuries. It still conceals,<br/>
no doubt, numberless treasures confided to it in<br/>
the days of slaughters and <span style="color: #0000FF;">pillage</span>, when the<br/>
armies of the Persian and Nubian kings forced<br/>
the thick, surrounding walls.<br/>
<br/>
In a few minutes, thousands of stars appear at<br/>
the bottom of this water, reflecting symmetrically<br/>
the veritable ones which now scintillate everywhere in the heavens. A sudden cold spreads<br/>
over the town-mummy, whose stones, still warm<br/>
from their exposure to the sun, cool very rapidly<br/>
in this nocturnal blue which envelops them as in<br/>
a shroud. I am free to wander where I please<br/>
without risk of meeting anyone, and I begin to<br/>
descend by the steps made by the falling of the<br/>
granite blocks, which have formed on all sides<br/>
staircases as if for giants. On the overturned<br/>
surfaces, my hands encounter the deep, clearcut hollows of the hieroglyphs, and sometimes<br/>
of those inevitable people, carved in profile, who<br/>
raise their arms, all of them, and make signs to<br/>
one another. On arriving at the bottom I am<br/>
received by a row of statues with battered faces,<br/>
seated on thrones, and without hindrance of any<br/>
kind, and recognising everything in the blue<br/>
transparency which takes the place of day, I<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
