<br/>
But the triumph of Assouan is its desert. It<br/>
begins at once without transition as soon as you<br/>
pass the close-cropped turf of the last square. A<br/>
desert which, except for the railroad and the<br/>
telegraph poles, has all the charm of the real<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">thing </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.- </span>the sand, the chaos of overthrown stones,<br/>
the empty horizons-everything, in short, save<br/>
the immensity and infinite solitude, the horror, in<br/>
a word, which formerly made it so little desirable.<br/>
It is a little astonishing, it must be owned, to<br/>
find, on arriving there, that the rocks have been<br/>
carefully numbered in white paint, and in some<br/>
cases marked with a large cross "which catches<br/>
the eye from a greater distance still "( sic). But<br/>
I agree that the effect of the whole has lost<br/>
nothing.<br/>
<br/>
In the morning before the sun gets too hot,<br/>
between breakfast and luncheon to be precise,<br/>
all the good ladies in cork helmets and blue<br/>
spectacles (dark-coloured spectacles are recommended on account of the glare) spread <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves </span>over these solitudes, domesticated as it<br/>
were to their use, with as much security as in<br/>
Trafalgar Square or Kensington Gardens. Not<br/>
seldom even you may see one of them making<br/>
her way alone, book in hand, towards one of the<br/>
picturesque <span style="color: #0000FF;">rocks</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-No</span>. 363, for example, or No.<br/>
364, if you like it <span style="color: #0000FF;">better-which </span>seems to be<br/>
making signs to her with its white ticket, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
