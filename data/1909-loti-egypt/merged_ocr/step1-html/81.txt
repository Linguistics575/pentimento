<span>The Hall of the Mummies 55<br/>
<br/>
Thebes, at Luxor, reproduce and try to make<br/>
eternal....<br/>
<br/>
In the next <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffin </span>lies his father, Seti I., who<br/>
reigned for a much shorter period, and died much<br/>
younger than he. This youthfulness is apparent<br/>
still in the features of the mummy, which are<br/>
impressed besides with a persistent beauty.<br/>
Indeed this good King Seti looks the picture<br/>
of calm and serene reverie. There is nothing<br/>
shocking in his dead face, with its long closed<br/>
eyes, its delicate lips, its noble chin and unblemished profile. It is soothing and pleasant<br/>
even to see him sleeping there with his hands<br/>
crossed upon his breast. And it seems strange,<br/>
that he, who looks so young, should have for<br/>
son the old man, almost a <span style="color: #0000FF;">centenarian</span>, who lies<br/>
beside him.<br/>
<br/>
In our passage we have gazed on many<br/>
other royal mummies, some tranquil and some<br/>
grimacing. But, to finish, there is one of them<br/>
(the third coffin there, in the row in front of<br/>
us), a certain Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nsitanebashru</span>, whom I<br/>
approach with fear, albeit it is mainly on her<br/>
account that I have ventured to make this<br/>
fantastical round. Even in the daytime she<br/>
attains to the maximum of horror that a<br/>
spectral figure can evoke. What will she be<br/>
like to-night in the uncertain light of our little<br/>
lantern?<br/>
