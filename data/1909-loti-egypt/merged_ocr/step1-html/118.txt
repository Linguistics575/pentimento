horror that were awaiting us above had vanished<br/>
from our mind. Sinister as it is under a blue<br/>
sky, this desert becomes absolutely intolerable to<br/>
look upon if by chance the sky is cloudy when<br/>
the daylight fails.<br/>
<br/>
On our return to it, from the subterranean<br/>
darkness, everything in its dead immensity has<br/>
begun to take on the blue tint of the night. On<br/>

sand that imitate the spray of an angry sea. On<br/>
all sides dark clouds stretch themselves as at the<br/>
moment of our descent. The horizon detaches<br/>
itself more and more clearly from them, and,<br/>
farther towards the east, it actually seems to be<br/>

this waterless sea, a mountain of sand whose<br/>
soft contours are deceptive in the distance,<br/>
makes it look as if it sloped towards us, so as<br/>
almost to produce a sensation of vertigo. The<br/>
sun itself has deigned to remain on the scene a<br/>
few seconds longer, held beyond its time by the<br/>
effect of mirage; but it is so changed behind its<br/>
thick veils that we would prefer that it should<br/>
not be there. Of the colour of dying embers, it<br/>

give any light, and is become a mere <span style="color: #ff0000;">rosecoloured </span>globe, that is losing its shape and<br/>
