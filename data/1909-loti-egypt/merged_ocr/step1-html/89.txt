At the first view it is difficult to distinguish<br/>
them, for they are far down in the shadow, and<br/>
out here we are almost blinded by the sun. In<br/>
little attentive groups of from ten to twenty,<br/>
seated on mats around a grave professor, they<br/>

simple, a little forbidding in their austerity, but<br/>
