In the nave, supported by columns of marble,<br/>
brought in days gone by from Pagan temples,<br/>
there are, as in all these old Coptic churches,<br/>
high transverse wooden partitions, elaborately<br/>
wrought in the Arab fashion, which divide it<br/>
into three sections: the first, into which one<br/>
comes on entering the church, is allotted to the<br/>
women, the second is for the baptistery, and<br/>
the third, at the end adjoining the iconostasis,<br/>
is reserved for the men.<br/>
<br/>
These women who are gathered this morning<br/>
in their apportioned space-so much at home<br/>
there with their suckling little ones-wear,<br/>
almost all of them, the long black silk veils of<br/>
former days. In their harmonious and endlessly<br/>
restless groups, the gowns <span style="color: #0000FF;">/</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>la <span style="color: #0000FF;">franque </span>and the<br/>
poor hats of carnival are still the exception.<br/>
The congregation, as a whole, preserves almost<br/>
intact its naive, old-time flavour.<br/>

And there is movement too, beyond, in the<br/>
compartment of the men, which is bounded at<br/>
the farther end by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ieonostasis-a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">thousandyear-old </span>wall decorated with inlaid cedarwood<br/>
and ivory of precious antique workmanship, and<br/>
adorned with strange old icons, blackened by<br/>
time. It is behind this <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall-pierced </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">several<br/>
<br/>
</span>doorways-that mass is now being said. <span style="color: #ff0000;">From<br/>
