<br/>
behind this monster face, far away in the rear,<br/>
on the top of those undefined and gently undulating sandhills, three apocalyptic signs rise<br/>
up against the sky, those <span style="color: #0000FF;">rose-coloured </span>triangles,<br/>
regular as the figures of geometry, but so vast<br/>
in the distance that they inspire you with fear.<br/>
They seem to be luminous of themselves, so<br/>
vividly do they stand out in their clear rose<br/>
against the deep blue of the star-spangled vault.<br/>
And this apparent radiation from within, by<br/>
its lack of likelihood, makes them seem more<br/>
awful.<br/>
<br/>
And all around is the desert; a corner of the<br/>
mournful kingdom of sand. Nothing else is to<br/>
be seen anywhere save those three awful things<br/>
that stand there upright and still-the human<br/>
likeness magnified beyond all measurement, and<br/>
the three geometric mountains; things at first<br/>
sight like exhalations, visionary things, with<br/>
nevertheless here and there, and most of all in<br/>
the features of the vast mute face, subtleties of<br/>
shadow which show that it at least exists, rigid<br/>
and immovable, fashioned out of imperishable<br/>
stone.<br/>
<br/>
Even had we not known, we must soon have<br/>
guessed, for these things are unique in the world,<br/>
and pictures of every age have made the <span style="color: #0000FF;">knowledge </span>of them commonplace: the Sphinx and<br/>
the Pyramids! But what is strange is that<br/>
<br/>
