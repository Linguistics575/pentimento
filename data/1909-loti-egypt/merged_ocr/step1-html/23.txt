<span>A Winter Midnight 9<br/>

this giddy triangle. And the pyramid seemed<br/>
to be illumined by some sad dawn of the end of<br/>
the world, a dawn which made ruddy only the<br/>
sands and the granites of earth, and left the<br/>
heavens, pricked with their myriad stars, more<br/>
awful in their darkness. How impossible it is<br/>
for us to conceive the mental attitude of that<br/>
king who, during some half-century, spent the<br/>
lives of thousands and thousands of his slaves<br/>
in the construction of this tomb, in the fond<br/>
and foolish hope of prolonging to infinity the<br/>
existence of his mummy.<br/>
<br/>
The pyramid once passed there was still a<br/>
short way to go before we confronted the Sphinx,<br/>
in the middle of what our contemporaries have<br/>
left him of his desert. We had to descend the<br/>
slope of that sandhill which looked like a cloud,<br/>
and seemed as if covered with felt, in order to<br/>
preserve in such a place a more complete silence.<br/>
And here and there we passed a gaping black<br/>
hole-an <span style="color: #ff0000;">airhole</span>, as it seemed, of the profound<br/>
and inextricable kingdom of mummies, very<br/>
populous still, in spite of the zeal of the<br/>
exhumers.<br/>
<br/>
As we descended the sandy pathway we were<br/>
not slow to perceive the Sphinx itself, half hill,<br/>
half <span style="color: #0000FF;">couchant </span>beast, turning its back upon us<br/>
in the attitude of a gigantic dog, that thought<br/>
to bay the moon; its head stood out in dark<br/>
<br/>
