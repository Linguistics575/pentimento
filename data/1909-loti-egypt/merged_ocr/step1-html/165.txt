there for some weeks, even if they were afterwards removed. And thus, funeral processions<br/>
passed to and fro without ceasing through the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cornfields </span>that separate the Nile from the desert.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>In the sad human dream dominated<br/>
by the thought of dissolution, Abydos preceded<br/>
by many centuries the Valley of J <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehosophat </span>of<br/>
the Hebrews, the cemeteries around Mecca of<br/>
the Moslems, and the holy tombs beneath our<br/>
oldest cathedrals!... Abydos! It <span style="color: #ff0000;">behoves </span>us<br/>
to walk here pensively and silently out of respect<br/>
for all those thousands of souls who formerly<br/>
turned towards this place, with outstretched<br/>
hands, in the hour of death.<br/>
<br/>
The first great temple--that which King Seti<br/>
raised to the mysterious Prince of the Other<br/>
World, who in those days was called Osiris--is quite <span style="color: #ff0000;">close-m </span>distance of little more than<br/>
200 yards in the glare of the desert. We come<br/>
upon it suddenly, so that it almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">startle</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>us,<br/>
for nothing warns us of its proximity. The<br/>
sand from which it has been exhumed, and which<br/>
buried it for 2000 years, still rises almost to its<br/>
roof. Through an iron gate, guarded by two<br/>
tall Bedouin guards in black robes, we plunge<br/>
at once into the shadow of enormous stones.<br/>
We are in the house of the god, in a forest of<br/>
heavy <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osiridean </span>columns, surrounded by a world<br/>
of people in high coiffures, carved in bas-relief<br/>
