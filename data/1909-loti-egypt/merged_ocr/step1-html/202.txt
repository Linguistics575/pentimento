same frescoes, filled with stars, with the signs of<br/>
the Zodiac, and series of winged discs; in <span style="color: #0000FF;">bas</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">relief </span>on the walls, the same multitudinous crowd<br/>
of people who <span style="color: #0000FF;">gesticulate </span>and make signs to<br/>
one another with their hands-eternally the same<br/>
mysterious signs, repeated to infinity, everywhere<br/>
-in the palaces, the hypogea, the syringes, and<br/>
on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>and papyri of the mummies.<br/>
<br/>
The Memphite and Theban temples, which<br/>
preceded this by so many centuries, and far<br/>
surpassed it in grandeur, have all lost, in consequence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">falling </span>of the enormous granites<br/>
of their roofs, their cherished gloom, and, what<br/>
is the same thing, their religious mystery. But<br/>
in the temple of the lovely Hathor, on the contrary, except for some figures mutilated by the<br/>
hammers of Christians <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Moslems, everything<br/>
has remained intact, and the lofty ceilings still<br/>
throw their fearsome shadows.<br/>
<br/>
The gloom deepens in the hypostyle which<br/>
follows the pronaos. Then come, one after<br/>
another, two halls of increasing holiness, where<br/>
the daylight enters regretfully through narrow<br/>
loopholes, barely lighting the superposed rows of<br/>
innumerable figures that gesticulate on the walls.<br/>
And then, after other majestic corridors, we reach<br/>
the heart of this heap of terrible stones, the holy<br/>
of holies, enveloped in deep gloom. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic </span>inscriptions name this place the "Hall<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
