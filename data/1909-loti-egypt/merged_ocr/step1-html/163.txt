<span>A Charming Luncheon <span style="color: #0000FF;">I33<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">enthroned </span>beyond, like the monarchs of all this<br/>
nothingness.<br/>
<br/>
The town of Abydos, which has vanished<br/>
and left no wrack behind, rose once in this spot<br/>
where we now stand, on the very threshold of<br/>
the solitudes; but its necropoles, more venerated<br/>
even than those of Memphis, and its thrice-holy<br/>
temples, are a little farther on, in the marvellously conserving sand, which has buried them<br/>
under its tireless waves and preserved them<br/>
almost intact up till the present day.<br/>
<br/>
The desert! As soon as we put foot upon its<br/>
shifting soil, which smothers the sound of our<br/>
steps, the atmosphere too seems suddenly to<br/>
change; it burns with a strange new heat, as if<br/>
great fires had been lighted in the neighbourhood.<br/>
<br/>
And this whole domain of light and drought,<br/>
right away into the distance, is shaded and<br/>
streaked with the familiar brown, red and yellow<br/>
colours. The mournful <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflection </span>of adjacent<br/>
things augments to excess the heat and light.<br/>
The horizon trembles under the little vapours<br/>
of mirage like water ruffled by the wind. The<br/>
background, which mounts gradually to the foot<br/>
of the Libyan mountains, is strewn with the<br/>
debris of bricks and stones-shape) ruins<br/>
which, though they scarcely rise above the sand,<br/>
abound nevertheless in great numbers, and serve<br/>
to remind us that here indeed is a very ancient<br/>
<br/>
