rooms for the use of the many amateur photographers, who make a point of taking away<br/>
with them photographs of their travelling<br/>
companions grouped tastefully before some<br/>
celebrated hypogeum.<br/>
<br/>
And then numerous caf√©s, where the whisky<br/>
is of excellent quality. And, I ought to add,<br/>
in justice to the result of the Entente Cordiale,<br/>
you may see there, too, aligned in considerable<br/>
quantities on the shelves, the products of those<br/>
great French philanthropists, to whom indeed<br/>
our generation does not render sufficient homage<br/>
for all the good they have done to its <span style="color: #0000FF;">stomach<br/>
</span>and its head. The reader will guess that I <span style="color: #ff0000;">have<br/>
</span>named Pernod, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Picon </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cusenier</span>.<br/>
<br/>
It may be indeed that the honest fellahs and<br/>
Nubians of the neighbourhood, <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>sober a little<br/>
while ago, are apt to abuse these tonics a little.<br/>
But that is the effect of novelty, and will pass.<br/>
And anyhow, amongst us Europeans, there is<br/>
no need to conceal the <span style="color: #ff0000;">faet</span>---for we do not all<br/>
make use of it <span style="color: #0000FF;">involuntarily </span>?--<span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>alcoholism is<br/>
a powerful auxiliary in the propagation of our<br/>
ideas, and that the dealer in wines and spirits<br/>
constitutes a valuable vanguard pioneer for our<br/>
Western civilisation. Races, insensibly depressed<br/>
by the abuse of our "appetisers," become more<br/>
supple, more easy to lead in the true path of<br/>
progress and liberty.<br/>
