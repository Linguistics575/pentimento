"He who instructs the ignorant is like a living man<br/>
amongst the dead."<br/>

"If a day passes without my having learnt something<br/>
which brings me nearer to God, let not the dawn of that day<br/>
be blessed." <span style="color: #0000FF;">Verses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Hadith.<br/>
