<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">160 </span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
was subject to the withering caress of this same<br/>
desert wind. And then, as now, the same unchanging rose coloured the continuous curtain<br/>
of the mountains.<br/>
<br/>
But all at once there is a noise of machinery,<br/>
and whistlings, and in the air, which was just<br/>
now so pure, rise noxious columns of black<br/>
smoke. The modern steamers are coming, and<br/>
throw into disorder the flotillas of the past:<br/>
colliers that leave great eddies in their wake, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>perhaps a wearisome lot of those three-decked<br/>
tourist boats, which make a great noise as they<br/>
plough the water, and are laden for the most<br/>
part with ugly women, snobs and imbeciles.<br/>
<br/>
Poor, poor <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span>which <span style="color: #ff0000;">1sefleeted </span>formerly on<br/>
its warm mirror the utmost of earthly splendour,<br/>
which bore in its time so many barques of gods<br/>
and goddesses in procession behind the golden<br/>
barge of Amen, and knew in the dawn of the<br/>
ages only an impeccable purity, alike of the<br/>
human form and of architectural <span style="color: #0000FF;">design</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>What<br/>
a downfall is here! To be awakened from<br/>
that disdainful sleep of twenty centuries and<br/>
made to carry the floating barracks of Thomas<br/>
Cook & Son, to feed sugar factories, and to<br/>
exhaust itself in nourishing with its mud the<br/>
raw material for English <span style="color: #ff0000;">eotton-stuffs</span>.<br/>
