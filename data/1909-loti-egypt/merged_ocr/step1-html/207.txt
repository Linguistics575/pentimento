In one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">vestibule </span>that we have to traverse on our way out of the sanctuary, amongst<br/>
the numerous bas-reliefs representing various<br/>
sovereigns paying homage to the beautiful<br/>
Hathor, is one of a young man, crowned with a<br/>
royal tiara shaped like the head of a uraeus. He<br/>
is shown seated in the traditional <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharaonic </span>pose<br/>
and is none other than the Emperor Nero!<br/>
<br/>
The hieroglyphs of the cartouche are there<br/>
to affirm his identity, albeit the sculptor, not<br/>
knowing his actual physiognomy, has given him<br/>
the traditional features, regular as those of the<br/>
god Horus. During the centuries of the Roman<br/>
domination the Western emperors used to send<br/>
from home instructions that their likeness should<br/>
be placed on the walls of the temples, and<br/>
that offerings should be made in their name to<br/>
the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">divinities-and </span>this notwithstanding that in their eyes Egypt must have seemed<br/>
so far away, a colony almost at the end of the<br/>
earth. (And it was such a goddess as this, of<br/>
secondary rank in the times of the Pharaohs,<br/>
that was singled out as the favourite of the<br/>
Romans of the decadence.)<br/>
