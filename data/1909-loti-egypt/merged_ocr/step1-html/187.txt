<span>The Downfall of the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">153<br/>
<br/>
</span>Ordinarily this <span style="color: #0000FF;">voyage </span>is made in the winter,<br/>
so that the traveller may follow the course of the<br/>
sun as it makes its escape towards the southern<br/>
hemisphere. The water then is low and the<br/>
valley parched. Leaving the cosmopolitan town<br/>
of modern Cairo, the iron bridges, and the pretentious hotels, with their <span style="color: #0000FF;">Haunting </span>inscriptions,<br/>
it imparts a sense of sudden peacefulness to pass<br/>
along the large and rapid waters of this river,<br/>
between the curtains of <span style="color: #ff0000;">palm-tmes </span>on the banks,<br/>
borne by a dahabiya where one is master and, if<br/>
one likes, may be alone.<br/>
<br/>
At first, for a day <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>two, the great haunting<br/>
triangles of the pyramids seem to follow you,<br/>
those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dashur </span>and that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah </span>succeeding<br/>
to those of Gizeh. For a long time the horizon<br/>
is disturbed by their gigantic silhouettes. As<br/>
we recede from them, and they disengage themselves better from neighbouring things, they<br/>
seem, as happens in the case of mountains, to<br/>
grow higher. And when they have finally <span style="color: #0000FF;">disappeared</span>, we have still to ascend slowly and by<br/>
stages some six hundred miles <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>river before we<br/>
reach the first cataract. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Our </span>way lies through<br/>
monotonous desert regions where the hours and<br/>
days are marked chiefly by the variations of the<br/>
wonderful light. Except for the phantasmagoria<br/>
of the mornings and evenings, there is no outstanding feature on these <span style="color: #0000FF;">dull-coloured </span>banks,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
