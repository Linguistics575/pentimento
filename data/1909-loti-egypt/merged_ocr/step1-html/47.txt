<span>The Passing of Cairo 25<br/>
<br/>
our carriage sinks to the very axles; for it is a<br/>
clear week since any serious quantity of rain fell.<br/>
It would seem that the new masters of this land,<br/>
albeit the cost of annual upkeep has risen in<br/>
their hands to the sum of <span style="color: #0000FF;">215,000,000</span>, have<br/>
given no thought to drainage. But the good<br/>
Arabs, patiently and without murmuring, gather<br/>
up their long robes, and with legs bare to the<br/>
knee make their way through this already pestilential water, which must be hatching for them<br/>
fever and death.<br/>
<br/>
Farther on, as the carriage proceeds on its<br/>
course, the scene changes little by little. The<br/>
streets become vulgar: the houses of "The<br/>
Arabian Nights "give place to tasteless Levantine buildings; electric lamps begin to pierce<br/>
the darkness with their wan, fatiguing glare,<br/>
and at a sharp turning the new Cairo is<br/>
before us.<br/>
<br/>
What is this? Where are we fallen? Save<br/>
that it is more vulgar, it might be Nice, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the<br/>
Riviera, or Interlaken, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>any other of those<br/>
. towns of carnival whither the bad taste of the<br/>
whole world comes to disport itself in the socalled fashionable seasons. But in these quarters,<br/>
on the other hand, which belong to the foreigners<br/>
and to the Egyptians rallied to the civilisation of<br/>
the West, all is clean and dry, well cared for and<br/>
well kept. There are no <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruts</span>, no refuse. The<br/>
