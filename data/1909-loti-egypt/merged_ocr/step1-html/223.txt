<br/>
</span>march, heavy and sure, which nothing should<br/>
withstand-grasps passionately in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">clenched<br/>
</span>fist, at the end of the muscular arm, a kind <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>buckled cross, which in Egypt was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbol<br/>
</span>of eternal life. And this is what the decision,<br/>
of their movement symbolises: <span style="color: #0000FF;">confident </span>all of<br/>
them in this poor bauble which they hold in their<br/>
hand, they cross with a triumphant step the<br/>
threshold of death.... "Eternal <span style="color: #ff0000;">Life</span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">-- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>thought of immortality-how the human soul<br/>
has been obsessed by it, particularly in the<br/>
periods marked by its greatest strivings! <span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A<br/>
</span>tame submission to the belief that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rottenness </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
</span>of the grave is the end of all is characteristic of<br/>
ages of decadence and mediocrity.<br/>
<br/>
The three similar giants, little damaged in<br/>
the course of their long existence, who align<br/>
the eastern side of this courtyard strewn with<br/>
blocks, represent, as indeed do all the others, that<br/>
same Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, whose effigy was multiplied<br/>
so extravagantly at Thebes and Memphis. But<br/>
these three have preserved a powerful and impetuous life. They might have been carved and<br/>
polished yesterday. Between the monstrous<br/>
reddish pillars, they <span style="color: #0000FF;">look </span>like white apparitions<br/>
issuing from their embrasure of columns and<br/>
advancing together like soldiers at manoeuvres.<br/>
The sun at this moment falls perpendicularly on<br/>
their heads and strange headgear, details their<br/>
