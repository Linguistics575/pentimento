<br/>
columns which border it are so gigantic 1 that<br/>
their tops, formed of mysterious <span style="color: #0000FF;">full-blown<br/>
</span>petals, high up above the ground on which we<br/>
crawl, are completely bathed in the diffuse clearness of the sky. And enclosing this kind of<br/>
nave on either side, like a terrible forest, is<br/>
another mass of columns-monster columns,<br/>
of an earlier style, of which the capitals close<br/>
instead of opening, imitating the buds of some<br/>
flower which will never blossom. Sixty to the<br/>
right, sixty to the left, too close together for<br/>
their size, they grow thick like a forest of<br/>
baobabs that wanted space: they induce a<br/>
feeling of oppression without possible deliverance, of massive and mournful eternity.<br/>
<br/>
And this, forsooth, was the place that I had<br/>
wished to traverse alone, without even the<br/>
Bedouin guard, who at night believes it his duty<br/>
to follow the visitors. But now it grows lighter<br/>
and lighter. Too light even, for a blue phosphorescence, coming from the eastern horizon, begins<br/>
to filter through the opacity of the colonnades<br/>
on the right, outlines the monstrous shafts, and<br/>
details them by vague glimmerings on their<br/>
edges. The full moon is risen, alas! and my<br/>
hours of solitude are nearly over.<br/>
