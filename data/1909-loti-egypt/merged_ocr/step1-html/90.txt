<br/>
their summits are elaborately ornamented and<br/>
crowned with battlements, which show in profile<br/>
against the sky a long series of <span style="color: #0000FF;">denticulated<br/>
</span>stonework. And over this sort of reddish fretwork of the top, which seems as if it were there<br/>
as a frame to the deep blue vault above us, we<br/>
see rising up distractedly all the minarets of the<br/>
neighbourhood; and these minarets are <span style="color: #ff0000;">redcoloured </span>too, redder even than the jealous walls,<br/>
and are decorated with arabesques, pierced<br/>
by the daylight and complicated with aerial<br/>
galleries. Some of them are a little distance<br/>
away; others, startlingly close, seem to scale the<br/>
zenith; and all are ravishing and strange, with<br/>
their shining crescents and outstretched shafts<br/>
of wood that call to the great birds of space.<br/>
Spite of ourselves we raise our heads, fascinated<br/>
by all the beauty that is in the air; but there<br/>
is only this square of marvellous sky, a sort<br/>
of limpid sapphire, set in the battlements<br/>
of El-Azhar and fringed by those audacious<br/>
slender towers. We are in the religious East<br/>
of olden days and we feel how the mystery<br/>
of this magnificent <span style="color: #0000FF;">court-whose </span>architectural<br/>
ornament consists merely in geometrical designs repeated to infinity, and does not commence till quite high up on the battlements,<br/>
where the minarets point into the eternal blue<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-must </span>cast its spell upon the imagination<br/>
<br/>
