<span>The Outskirts of Cairo 95<br/>
<br/>
vening nothingness, we find ourselves in a<br/>
new town; streets with little low houses, little<br/>
cross-roads, little squares, all of them white, on<br/>
whitened sands, beneath a white moon....<br/>
But there is no electricity in this town, no<br/>
lights, and nobody is stirring; doors and windows<br/>
are shut<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>no movement of any kind, and the<br/>
silence, at first, is like that of the surrounding<br/>
desert. It is a town in which the half-light of<br/>
the moon, amongst so much vague whiteness,<br/>
is diffused in such a way that it seems to come<br/>
from all sides at once and things cast no shadows<br/>
which might give them definiteness; a town<br/>
where the soil is so yielding that our progress is<br/>
weakened and retarded, as in dreams. It seems<br/>
unreal: and, in penetrating farther into it, a<br/>
sense of fear comes over you that can neither<br/>
be dismissed nor defined.<br/>
<br/>
For assuredly this is no ordinary town....<br/>
And yet the houses, with their windows barred<br/>
like those of a harem, are in no way <span style="color: #0000FF;">singular</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-except </span>that they are shut and silent. It is all<br/>
this whiteness, perhaps, which freezes us. And<br/>
then, too, the silence is not, in fact, like that of<br/>
the desert, which did at least seem natural,<br/>
inasmuch as there was nothing there; here, on<br/>
the contrary, there is a sense of innumerable<br/>
presences, which shrink away as you pass but<br/>
nevertheless continue to watch attentively....<br/>
