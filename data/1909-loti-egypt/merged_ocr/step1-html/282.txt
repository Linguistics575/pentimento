<span>244 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
workshop, built of new bricks, shoots forth its<br/>
black smoke, and all about, between the high,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">blood-coloured </span>walls, coming and going, making<br/>
a great stir and gabbling to their hearts' content,<br/>
are a number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cook</span>'s tourists of both sexes, and<br/>
some even who verily seem to have no sex at all.<br/>
They are come for the royal audience; some on<br/>
asses, some in jaunting cars, and some, the stout<br/>
ladies who are grown short of wind, in chairs<br/>
carried by the Bedouins. From the four points<br/>
of Europe they have assembled in this desert<br/>
ravine to <span style="color: #0000FF;">see </span>an old dried-up corpse at the<br/>
bottom of a hole.<br/>
<br/>
Here and there the hidden palaces reveal their<br/>
dark, square-shaped entrances, hewn in the<br/>
massive rock, and over each a board indicates<br/>
the name of a kingly <span style="color: #0000FF;">mummy-Ramses </span>IV.,<br/>
Seti I., Thothmes III., Ramses IX., <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc</span>. Although all these kings, except Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>,<br/>
have recently been removed and carried away to<br/>
Lower Egypt, to people the glass cases of the<br/>
museum of Cairo, their last dwellings have not<br/>
ceased to attract crowds. From each underground habitation are emerging now a number<br/>
of perspiring Cooks and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cookesses</span>. And from<br/>
that of Amenophis, especially, they issue rapidly.<br/>
Suppose that we have come too late and that the<br/>
audience is <span style="color: #0000FF;">over</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
<br/>
</span>And to think that these entrances had <span style="color: #0000FF;">been<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
