<span>I 56 Egypt<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">shadM</span>, worked by men whose naked bodies<br/>
stream with the cold water.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">shadtds </span>follow one another sometimes as<br/>
far as the eye can see. It is strange to watch<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">movement-confused </span>in the distance-of all<br/>
these long rods which pump the water without<br/>
ceasing, and look like the swaying of living<br/>
antennae. The same sight was to be seen along<br/>
this river in the times of the Ramses. But<br/>
suddenly, at some bend of the river, the old<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharaonic </span>rigging disappears, to give place to<br/>
a succession of steam machines, which, more<br/>
even than the muscles of the fellahs, are busy at<br/>
the water-drawing. Before long their blackish<br/>
chimneys will make a continuous border to the<br/>
tamed Nile.<br/>
<br/>
Did one not know their bearings, the great<br/>
ruins of this Egypt would pass unnoticed. With<br/>
a few rare exceptions they lie beyond the green<br/>
plains on the threshold of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">solitude</span>. And<br/>
against the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehangeless</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">rosecoloured </span>background<br/>
of these cliffs of the desert, which follow you<br/>
during the whole of this tranquil navigation of<br/>
some 600 miles, are to be seen only the humble<br/>
towns and villages of to-day, which have the<br/>
neutral colour of the ground. Some <span style="color: #0000FF;">openwork<br/>
</span>minarets dominate <span style="color: #0000FF;">them-white </span>spots above the<br/>
prevailing dullness. Clouds of pigeons whirl<br/>
round in the neighbourhood. And amongst the<br/>
<br/>
