<span>Modern Luxor I 8 3<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the shops, following the line of the<br/>
quay, there are other hotels. Less aggressive,<br/>
all of them, than the Winter Palace, they<br/>
have had the discretion not to raise themselves<br/>
too high, and to cover their fronts with white<br/>
chalk in the Arab fashion, even to conceal<br/>
themselves in clusters of palm-trees.<br/>
<br/>
And finally there is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>temple of<br/>
Luxor, looking as out of place now as the<br/>
poor obelisk which Egypt gave us as a present,<br/>
and which stands to-day in the Place de la<br/>
Concorde.<br/>
<br/>
Bordering the Nile, it is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>grove of<br/>
stone, about three hundred yards in length. In<br/>
epochs of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificence </span>that is now scarcely<br/>
conceivable this forest of columns grew high<br/>
and thick, rising impetuously at the bidding of<br/>
Amenophis and the great Ramses. And how<br/>
beautiful it must have been even yesterday,<br/>
dominating in its superb disarray this surround..<br/>
ing country, vowed for centuries to neglect and<br/>
silence!<br/>
<br/>
But to-day, with all these things that men<br/>
have built around it, you might say that it<br/>
no longer exists.<br/>
<br/>
We reach an iron-barred gate and, to enter,<br/>
have to show our permit to the guards. Once<br/>
inside the immense sanctuary, perhaps we shall<br/>
find solitude again. But, alas, under the profaned<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
