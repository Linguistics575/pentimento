<br/>
without noise, traces on this same sand little<br/>
furrows which the wind will have effaced by<br/>
to-morrow. There are no roads of any kind;<br/>
they would indeed be as useless as they are<br/>
impossible to make. You may pass here where<br/>
you list, and fancy yourself far away from any<br/>
place inhabited by living beings. The great town,<br/>
which we know to be so close, appears from time<br/>
to time, thanks to the undulations of the ground,<br/>
as a mere phosphorescence, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflection </span>of its<br/>
myriad electric lights. We are indeed in the<br/>
desert of the dead, in the sole company of the<br/>
moon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, by the fantasy of this wonderful<br/>
Egyptian sky, is to-night a moon of grey pearl,<br/>
one might almost say a moon of mother-of-pearl.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these funeral mosques is a thing of<br/>
splendour, if one examines it closely in its solitude. Those strange upraised domes, which from<br/>
a distance look like the head-dresses of dervishes<br/>
01' magi, are embroidered with arabesques, and<br/>
the walls are crowned with <span style="color: #0000FF;">denticulated </span>trefoils<br/>
of exquisite fashioning.<br/>
<br/>
But nobody venerates these tombs of the<br/>
Mameluke oppressors, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>keeps them in repair;<br/>
and within them there are no more chants, no<br/>
prayers to Allah. Night after night they pass in<br/>
an infinity of silence. Piety contents itself with<br/>
not destroying them; leaving them there at the<br/>
mercy of time and the sun and the wind which<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
