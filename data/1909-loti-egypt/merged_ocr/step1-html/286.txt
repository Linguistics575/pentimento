<span>248 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
the electricity permits us to see quite clearly, and<br/>
opposite, at the end of the hall, a large crypt is<br/>
revealed, which one divines instinctively must<br/>
be the resting-place of the Pharaoh. What a<br/>
prodigious labour must have been entailed by<br/>
this perforation of the living rock! And this<br/>
hypogeum is not unique. All along the "Valley<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kings </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>little insignificant doors-which<br/>
to the initiated reveal the "Sign of the Shadow,"<br/>
inscribed on their <span style="color: #0000FF;">lintels-lead </span>to other subterranean places, just as sumptuous and perfidiously<br/>
profound, with their snares, their hidden wells,<br/>
their oubliettes and the bewildering multiplicity<br/>
of their mural figures. And all these tombs this<br/>
morning were full of people, and, if we had not<br/>
had the good fortune to arrive after the usual<br/>
hour, we should have met here, even in this<br/>
dwelling of Amenophis, a battalion equipped by<br/>
Messrs Cook.<br/>
<br/>
In this hall, with its blue ceiling, the frescoes<br/>
multiply their riddles<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>scenes from the Book of<br/>
Hades, all the funeral ritual translated into<br/>
pictures. On the pillars and walls crowd the<br/>
different demons that an Egyptian soul was<br/>
likely to meet in its passage through the country<br/>
of shadows, and underneath the passwords which<br/>
were to be given to each of them are recapitulated so as not to be forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
For the soul used to depart simultaneously<br/>
