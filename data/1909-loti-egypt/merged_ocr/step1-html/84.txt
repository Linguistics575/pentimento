<br/>
long galleries, shall seem no more than a foolish,<br/>
vanishing spot of fire, will not the "forms "of<br/>
whom the attendants are so afraid, will they<br/>
not start their nightly rumblings and in their<br/>
hollow mummy voices, whisper, with difficulty,<br/>
words?...<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Heavens</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span>How dark it <span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>Yet our lantern<br/>
has not gone out. But it seems to grow darker<br/>
and darker. And at night, when all is shut up,<br/>
how one smells the odour of the oils in which<br/>
the shrouds are saturated, and, more intolerable<br/>
still, the sickly stealthy stench, almost, of all<br/>
these dead bodies!...<br/>
<br/>
As I traverse the obscurity of these endless<br/>
halls, a vague instinct of self-preservation induces<br/>
me to turn back again, and look behind. And<br/>
it seems to me that already the woman with the<br/>
baby is slowly raising herself, with a thousand<br/>
precautions and stratagems, her head still completely covered. While farther down, that dishevelled hair.... Oh! I can see her well, sitting<br/>
up with a sudden jerk, the ghoul with the enamel<br/>
eyes, the lady <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nsitanebashru</span>!<br/>
