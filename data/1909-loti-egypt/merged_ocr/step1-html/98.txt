alone seems as if it were intoning the last lament<br/>
over the death-pang of Old Islam and the end of<br/>
time, the elegy, as it were, of the universal death<br/>
of faith in the heart of man.<br/>
<br/>
"Science is one religion; prayer is another. Study is better<br/>
than worship. Go; seek knowledge everywhere, if needs be,<br/>
even into China." <span style="color: #ff0000;">Versesfrom </span>the Hadith<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>Amongst us Europeans it is commonly accepted<br/>
as a proven fact that Islam is merely a religion<br/>
of obscurantism, bringing in its train the stagnation of nations, and hampering them in that march<br/>
to the unknown which we call "progress." But<br/>
such an attitude shows not only an absolute<br/>
ignorance of the teaching of the Prophet, but<br/>
a blind forgetfulness of the evidence of history.<br/>
The Islam of the earlier centuries evolved and<br/>
progressed with the nations, and the stimulus it<br/>
gave to men in the reign of the ancient caliphs<br/>
is beyond all question. To impute to it the<br/>
present decadence of the Moslem world is <span style="color: #0000FF;">altogether </span>too puerile. The truth is that nations<br/>
have their day; and to a period of glorious<br/>
splendour succeeds a time of lassitude and<br/>
slumber. It is a law of nature. And then<br/>
one day some danger threatens them, stirs<br/>
them from their torpor and they awake.<br/>
<br/>
This immobility of the countries of the Crescent<br/>
was once dear to me. If the end is to pass through<br/>
life with the minimum of suffering, disdaining all<br/>
<br/>
