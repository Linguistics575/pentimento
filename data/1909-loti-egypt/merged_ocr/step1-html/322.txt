The darn, it is true, in suppressing the cataract<br/>
has raised some thirty feet or so the level of the<br/>
water upstream, and by so doing has submerged<br/>
a certain Isle of Philae, which passed, absurdly<br/>
enough, for one of the marvels of the world by<br/>
reason of its great temple of Isis, surrounded by<br/>
palm-trees. But between ourselves, one may<br/>
say that the beautiful goddess was a little oldfashioned for our times. She and her mysteries<br/>
had had their day. Besides, if there should be any<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chagrined </span>soul who might regret the disappearance of the island, care has been taken to perpetuate the memory of it, in the same way as<br/>
that of the cataract. Charming coloured postcards, taken before the submerging of the island<br/>
and the sanctuary, are on sale in all the bookshops along the quay.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Oh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>this quay of Assouan, already so British<br/>
in its orderliness, its method! Nothing better<br/>
cared for, nothing more altogether charming<br/>
could be conceived. First of all there is the<br/>
railway, which, passing between balustrades<br/>
painted a grass-green, gives out its fascinating<br/>
noise and joyous smoke. On one side is a row<br/>
of hotels and shops, all European in character<br/>
--hairdressers, perfumers, and numerous dark<br/>
