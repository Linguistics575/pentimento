little houses, which are only cubes of mud, baked<br/>
in the sun, the palm-trees of Africa, either singly<br/>
or in mighty clusters, rise superbly and <span style="color: #ff0000;">east </span>on<br/>
these little habitations the shade of their palms<br/>
which sway in the wind. Not long ago, although<br/>
indeed everything in these little towns was<br/>
mournful and stagnant, one would have been<br/>
tempted to stop in passing, drawn by that nameless peace that belonged to the Old East and to<br/>
Islam. But, now, before the smallest <span style="color: #0000FF;">hamlet-amongst </span>the beautiful primitive boats, that still<br/>
remain in great numbers, pointing their yards,<br/>

modern factory, throned there in a sort of irony,<br/>
and dominating the poor crumbling things that<br/>
still presume to tell of Egypt and of mystery.<br/>
And so now, except at the towns <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>villages<br/>
which lead to celebrated <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins</span>, we stop no longer.<br/>
It is necessary to proceed farther and for the<br/>
halt of the night to seek an obscure hamlet, a<br/>
