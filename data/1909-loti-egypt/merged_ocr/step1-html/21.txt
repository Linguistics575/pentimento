<span>A Winter Midnight 7<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">mensity </span>and mystery. In the days of the<br/>
Romans they had already become symbols of a<br/>
lost significance, legacies of a fabulous antiquity,<br/>
but people came curiously to contemplate them,<br/>
and tourists in toga and in peplus carved their<br/>
names on the granite of their bases for the sake<br/>
of remembrance.<br/>
<br/>
The tourists who have come to-night, and upon<br/>
whom have pounced the <span style="color: #0000FF;">black-cloaked </span>Bedouin<br/>
guides, wear cap and ulster <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>furred greatcoat;<br/>
their intrusion here seems almost an offence;<br/>
but, alas, such visitors become more numerous in<br/>
each succeeding year. The great town hard by<br/>
--<span style="color: #ff0000;">whieh </span>sweats gold now that men have started<br/>
to buy from it its dignity and its <span style="color: #ff0000;">soul-As </span>become<br/>
a place of rendezvous and holiday for the idlers<br/>
and upstarts of the whole world. The modern<br/>
spirit encompasses the old desert of the Sphinx<br/>
on every side. It is true that up to the present<br/>
no one has dared to profane it by building in<br/>
the immediate neighbourhood of the great statue.<br/>
Its fixity and calm disdain still hold some sway,<br/>
perhaps. But little more than a mile away<br/>
there ends a road travelled by <span style="color: #0000FF;">hackney </span>carriages<br/>
and tramway cars, and noisy with the delectable<br/>
hootings of smart motor cars; and behind the<br/>
pyramid of Cheops squats a vast hotel to which<br/>
swarm men and women of fashion, the latter<br/>
absurdly feathered, like Redskins at a scalp<br/>
<br/>
