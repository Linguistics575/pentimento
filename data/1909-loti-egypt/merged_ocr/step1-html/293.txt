<span>An Audience of Amenophis II. 255<br/>
<br/>
watched from above by all these figures is an<br/>
enormous sarcophagus of stone, wide open; and<br/>
in it we can distinguish vaguely the outline of a<br/>
human body: the Pharaoh!<br/>
<br/>
At least we should have liked to see him<br/>
better. The necessary light is forthcoming at<br/>
once: the Bedouin Grand Master of Ceremonies<br/>
touches an electric button and a powerful lamp<br/>
illumines the face of Amenophis, detailing with<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">clearness </span>that almost frightens you the closed<br/>
eyes, the grimacing countenance, and the<br/>
whole of the sad mummy. This theatrical<br/>
effect took us by surprise; we were not <span style="color: #0000FF;">prepared </span>for it.<br/>
<br/>
He was buried in magnificence, but the pillagers have stripped him of everything, even of<br/>
his beautiful breastplate of tortoiseshell, which<br/>
came to him from a far-off Oriental country, and<br/>
for many centuries now he has slept half naked<br/>
on his rags. But his poor bouquet is there still<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>mimosa, recognisable even now, and who<br/>
will ever tell what pious <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>perhaps amorous<br/>
hand it was that gathered these flowers for him,<br/>
more than three thousand years ago.<br/>
<br/>
The heat is suffocating. The whole crushing<br/>
mass of <span style="color: #ff0000;">this/mountain</span>, of this block of limestone,<br/>
into which we have crawled through relatively<br/>
imperceptible holes, like white ants OI' larvae,<br/>
seems to weigh upon our chest. And these<br/>
