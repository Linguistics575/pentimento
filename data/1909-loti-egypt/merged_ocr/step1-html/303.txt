<span style="color: #ff0000;">1aefleet.1 </span>I have known him for many days-for<br/>
many days and many nights, for, what with his<br/>
whiteness and the transparency of these Egyptian<br/>
nights, I have seen him often outlined in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">distance </span>under the dim light of the stars-a great<br/>
phantom in his contemplative pose. And I feel<br/>
myself obsessed now by the continuance of his<br/>
attitude at this entrance of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ruins-l </span>who shall<br/>

been there since times which make you shudder<br/>
to think upon. For three and thirty centuries,<br/>

him just as I see him now, tranquil and white, in<br/>
this same place, seated before this same threshold,<br/>

<br/>
I make my way without hastening, having<br/>
always a tendency to stop and look behind<br/>
me, to watch the silent heap of palaces and the<br/>
white dreamer, which now are all illumined<br/>
with a last Bengal fire in the daily setting of<br/>
the sun.<br/>
<br/>
And the hour is already twilight when I reach<br/>
the goddesses.<br/>
<br/>
Their domain is so destroyed that the sands<br/>
