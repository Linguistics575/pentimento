<br/>
beyond the heaps of ruins, those happy plains,<br/>
which are spread out with such a perfect serenity on the very ground where once stood the<br/>
town of Denderah, beloved of Hathor and one<br/>
of the most famous of Upper Egypt. Exquisitely<br/>
green are these plains with the new growth of<br/>
wheat and lucerne and bean; and the herds<br/>
that are grouped here and there on the fresh<br/>
verdure of the level pastures, swaying now and<br/>
undulating in the wind, look like so many dark<br/>
patches. And the two chains of mountains of<br/>
rose-coloured stone, that run parallel-on the<br/>
east that of the desert of Arabia, on the west that<br/>
of the Libyan desert-enclose, in the distance,<br/>
this valley of the Nile, this land of plenty, which,<br/>
alike in antiquity as in our days, has excited the<br/>
greed of predatory races. The temple has also<br/>
some underground dependencies <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>crypts into<br/>
which you descend by staircases as of dungeons;<br/>
sometimes even you have to crawl through holes<br/>
to reach them. Long superposed galleries which<br/>
might serve as hiding-places for treasure; long<br/>
corridors recalling those which, in bad dreams,<br/>
threaten to close in and bury you. And the<br/>
innumerable figures, of course, are here too,<br/>
gesticulating on the walls; and endless representations of the lovely goddess, whose<br/>
swelling bosom, which has preserved almost<br/>
intact the flesh colour applied in the times Of<br/>
