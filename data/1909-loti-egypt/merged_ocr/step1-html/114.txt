<span>84 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
for some three thousand years before the commencement of the Christian era.... In order to<br/>
show it to us better the group is brought to the<br/>
window, and the mournful <span style="color: #0000FF;">light </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>enters from<br/>
across the infinite <span style="color: #0000FF;">solitude </span>of the desert colours<br/>
them <span style="color: #0000FF;">yellow </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>shows us in detail their little <span style="color: #ff0000;">dolllike </span>attitudes and their comical and frightened<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance-frightened </span>perhaps to find themselves so old and issuing from so deep a night.<br/>
They had not seen a setting of the sun, such as<br/>
they now regard with <span style="color: #0000FF;">their</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>queer eyes, too long<br/>
and too wide open, they had not seen such a<br/>
thing for some five thousand years....<br/>
<br/>
The habitation of the Apis, the lords of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis</span>, is little more than two hundred yards<br/>
away. We are told that the place is now lighted<br/>
up and that we may <span style="color: #ff0000;">betake </span>ourselves thither.<br/>
<br/>
The descent is by a narrow, rapidly sloping<br/>
passage, dug in the soil, between banks of sand<br/>
and broken stones. We are now completely<br/>
sheltered from the bitter wind which blows<br/>
across the desert, and from the dark doorway<br/>
that opens before us comes a breath of air as<br/>
from an oven. It is always dry and hot in the<br/>
underground funeral places of Egypt, which<br/>
make indeed admirable stoves for mummies.<br/>
The threshold once crossed we are plunged first<br/>
of all in darkness and, preceded by a lantern,<br/>
make our way, by devious turnings, over large<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
