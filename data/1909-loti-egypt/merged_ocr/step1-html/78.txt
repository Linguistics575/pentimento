<span>5 2 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
will be complete, with such energy have men<br/>
dug in the heart of the rocks to find them <span style="color: #0000FF;">all</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>and these glass <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases </span>will no doubt be their<br/>
final resting-place. In olden days, however, they<br/>
made many <span style="color: #0000FF;">pilgrimage </span>after their death, for<br/>
in the troubled times of the history of Egypt it<br/>
was one of the harassing preoccupations of the<br/>
reigning sovereign to hide, to hide at all costs,<br/>
the mummies of his ancestors, which filled the<br/>
earth increasingly, and which the violators of<br/>
tombs were so swift to track. Then they were<br/>
carried clandestinely from one grave to another,<br/>
raised each from his own pompous <span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulchre</span>, to<br/>
be buried at last together in some humble and<br/>
less conspicuous vault. But it is here, in this<br/>
museum of Egyptian antiquities, that they are<br/>
about to accomplish their return to dust, which<br/>
has been deferred, as if by miracle, for so many<br/>
centuries. Now, stripped of their bandages,<br/>
their days are numbered, and it <span style="color: #ff0000;">behoves </span>us to<br/>
hasten to draw these physiognomies of three<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">four </span>thousand years ago, which are about<br/>
to perish.<br/>
<br/>
In that coffin-the last but one of the row on<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">left-it </span>is the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sesostris </span>himself who<br/>
awaits us. We know of old that face of ninety<br/>
years, with its nose hooked like the beak of a<br/>
falcon; and the gaps between those old man's<br/>
teeth; the meagre, birdlike neck, and the hand<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
