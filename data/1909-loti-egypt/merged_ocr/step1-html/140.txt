<span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
since the commencement of our geological<br/>
period<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In another few weeks the prodigious<br/>
river will spread along its banks, just as in the<br/>
times of the God Amen, a precocious and <span style="color: #0000FF;">impetuous </span>life. And meanwhile the orange-trees,<br/>
the jasmine and the honeysuckle, which men<br/>
have taken care to water with water from the<br/>
Nile, are full of riotous bloom. As we pass the<br/>
gardens of Old Cairo, which alternate with the<br/>
tumbling houses, this continual cloud of white<br/>
dust that envelops us comes suddenly laden<br/>
with their sweet fragrance; so that, despite the<br/>
drought and the bareness of the trees, the scents<br/>
of a sudden and feverish springtime are already<br/>
in the air.<br/>
<br/>
When we arrive at the walls of what used to<br/>
be the Roman citadel we have to descend from<br/>
our carriage, and passing through a low doorway<br/>
penetrate on foot into the labyrinth of a Coptic<br/>
quarter which is dying of dust and old age.<br/>
Deserted houses that have become the refuges<br/>
of outcasts; <span style="color: #ff0000;">mushrabiyas</span>, worm-eaten and <span style="color: #0000FF;">decayed</span>; little mousetrap alleys that lead us under<br/>
arches of the Middle Ages, and sometimes<br/>
close over our heads by reason of the fantastic<br/>
bending of the ruins. Even by such a route as<br/>
this are we conducted to a famous basilica!<br/>
Were it not for these groups of Copts, dressed<br/>
in their Sunday garb, who make their way like<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
