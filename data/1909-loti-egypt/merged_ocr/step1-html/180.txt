<span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">So </span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
river began? There is something fearful in the<br/>
thought. During the 5000 years of which we<br/>
have any knowledge the incessant deposit of<br/>
mud has scarcely widened this strip of inhabited<br/>
Egypt, which at the most ancient period of<br/>
history was almost as it is to-day. And as for<br/>
the granite blocks on the plains of Nubia, how<br/>
many thousands of years did it need to roll them<br/>
and to polish them thus? In the times of the<br/>
Pharaohs they already had their present rounded<br/>
forms, worn smooth by the friction of the water,<br/>
and the hieroglyphic inscriptions on their surfaces<br/>
are not <span style="color: #0000FF;">perceptibly </span>effaced, though they have<br/>
suffered the periodical inundation of the summer<br/>
for some forty <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>fifty centuries!<br/>
<br/>
It was an exceptional country, this valley of<br/>
the Nile; marvellous and unique; fertile without<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">vain</span>, watered according to its need by the great<br/>
river, without the help of any cloud. It knew<br/>
not the dull days and the humidity under which<br/>
we suffer, but kept always the changeless sky of<br/>
the immense surrounding deserts, which exhaled<br/>
no vapour that might dim the horizon. It was<br/>
this eternal splendour of its light, no doubt, and<br/>
this easiness of life, which brought forth here the<br/>
first fruits of human thought. This same Nile,<br/>
after having so patiently created the soil of<br/>
Egypt, became also the father of that people,<br/>
which led the way for all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">others-like </span>those<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
