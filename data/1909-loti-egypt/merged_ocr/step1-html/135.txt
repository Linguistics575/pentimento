<span>CHAPTER VIII<br/>
ARCHAIC CHRISTIANITY<br/>
<br/>
DIMLY lighted by the flames of a few poor slender<br/>
tapers which <span style="color: #0000FF;">flicker </span>against the walls in stone<br/>
niches, a dense crowd of human figures veiled in<br/>
black, in a place overpowering and <span style="color: #ff0000;">suffocatingunderground</span>, no <span style="color: #0000FF;">doubt-which </span>is filled with the<br/>
perfume of the incense of Arabia: and a noise<br/>
of almost wicked movement, which stirs us to<br/>
alarm and even horror: bleatings of new-born<br/>
babies, cries of distress of tiny mites whose<br/>
voices are drowned, as if on purpose, by a<br/>
clinking of cymbals....<br/>
<br/>
What can it be? Why have they descended<br/>
into this dark hole, these little ones, who howl<br/>
in the midst of the smoke, held by these phantoms<br/>
in mourning? Had we entered it unawares we<br/>
might have thought it a den of wicked sorcery,<br/>
an underground cavern for the black mass.<br/>
<br/>
But no. It is the crypt of the basilica of<br/>
St Sergius during the Coptic mass of Easter<br/>
morning. And when, after the first surprise,<br/>
we examine these phantoms, we find that, for<br/>
the most part, they are young mothers, with the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1aefined </span>and gentle faces of Madonnas, who hold<br/>
