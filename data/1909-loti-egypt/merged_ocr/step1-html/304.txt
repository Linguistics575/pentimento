had succeeded in covering and hiding it for<br/>
centuries. But it has lately been exhumed.<br/>
There remain of it now only some fragments<br/>
of columns, aligned in multiple rows in a vast<br/>
extent of desert. Broken and fallen stones and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">debris.1 </span>I walk on without stopping, and at<br/>
length reach the sacred lake on the margin of<br/>
which the great eats are seated in eternal council,<br/>
each one on her throne. The lake, dug by order<br/>
of the Pharaohs, is in the form of an are, like<br/>
a kind of crescent. Some marsh birds, that are<br/>
about to retire for the night, now traverse its<br/>
mournful, sleeping water. Its borders, which<br/>
have known the utmost of <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificence</span>, are become mere heaps of ruins on which nothing grows.<br/>
And what one sees beyond, what the attentive<br/>
goddesses themselves regard, is the empty<br/>
desolate plain, on which some few poor fields of<br/>
corn mingle in this twilight hour with the sad<br/>
infinitude of the sands. And the whole is<br/>
bounded on the horizon by the chain, still a little<br/>
rose-coloured, of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">limestones </span>of Arabia.<br/>
They are there, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eats</span>, or, to speak more<br/>
exactly, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lionesses</span>, for <span style="color: #0000FF;">eats </span>would not have<br/>
those short ears, or those cruel chins, thickened<br/>
by tufts of beard. All of black granite, images<br/>
of Sekhet (who was the Goddess of War, and in<br/>
her hours the Goddess of Lust), they have the<br/>
