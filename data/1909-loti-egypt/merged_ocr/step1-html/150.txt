another man catches in its ascent and empties<br/>
into a basin made out of the mud of the river<br/>
bank. When the river is low there are three<br/>
such basins, placed one above the other, as if<br/>
they were stages by which the precious water<br/>
mounts to the fields of corn and <span style="color: #0000FF;">lucerne</span>. And<br/>
then three <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">shadids</span>," one above the other, creak<br/>
together, lowering and raising their great <span style="color: #ff0000;">scarabseus</span>' horns to the rhythm of the same song.<br/>
All along the banks of the Nile this movement<br/>
of the antennae of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shadtds </span>is to be seen. It<br/>
had its beginning in the earliest ages and is still<br/>
the characteristic manifestation of human life<br/>
along the river banks. It ceases only in the<br/>
summer, when the river, swollen <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the rains of<br/>
equatorial Africa, overflows this land of Egypt,<br/>
which it itself has made in the midst of the<br/>
Saharan sands. But in the winter, which is here<br/>
a time of luminous drought and <span style="color: #0000FF;">changeless </span>blue<br/>
skies, it is in full swing. Then every day, from<br/>
dawn until the evening prayer, the men are busy<br/>
at their water-drawing, transformed for the time<br/>
into tireless machines, with muscles that work<br/>
like metal bands. The action never changes,<br/>
any more than the song, and often their thoughts<br/>
must wander from their automatic toil, and lose<br/>
themselves in some dream, akin to that of their<br/>
ancestors who were yoked to the same rigging<br/>
four or five thousand years ago. Their torsos,<br/>
