<span>so Egypt<br/>
to me<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>"This is the place. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Look</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>There they<br/>
are."<br/>
<br/>
In truth I recognise the place, having often<br/>
come here in the daytime, like other people. In<br/>
spite of the darkness, which commences at some<br/>
ten paces from us-so small is the circle of light<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">cast </span>by our lantern-l can distinguish the double<br/>
row of the great royal coffins, open without<br/>
shame in their glass cases. And standing against<br/>
the walls, upright, like so many sentinels, are<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoffin </span>lids, fashioned in the shape of the<br/>
human figure<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>We are there at last, admitted at this unseasonable hour into the guest-chamber of kings<br/>
and queens, for an audience that is private<br/>
indeed.<br/>
<br/>
And there, first of all, is the woman with the<br/>
baby, upon whom, without stopping, we throw<br/>
the light of our lantern. A woman who died in<br/>
giving to the world a little dead prince. Since<br/>
the old embalmers no one has seen the face of<br/>
this Queen Makeri. In her coffin there she<br/>
is simply a tall female figure, outlined beneath<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">close-bound </span>swathings of <span style="color: #0000FF;">brown-coloured<br/>
</span>bandages. At her feet lies the fatal baby,<br/>
grotesquely shrivelled, and veiled and mysterious<br/>
as the mother herself; a sort of doll, it seems,<br/>
put there to keep her eternal company in the<br/>
slow passing of endless years.<br/>
<br/>
