And in the old dried-up soil, how many strange<br/>
treasures remain <span style="color: #0000FF;">hidden</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>When the sun lights<br/>
thus the forlorn distances, when you perceive<br/>
stretching away to the horizon these fields of<br/>
death, you realise better what kind of a place<br/>
this Thebes once was. Rebuilt as it were in the<br/>
imagination it appears excessive, superabundant<br/>
and multiple, like those flowers of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">antediluvian<br/>
</span>world which the fossils reveal to us<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Compared<br/>
with it how our modern towns are dwarfed, and<br/>
our hasty little palaces, our stuccoes and old iron!<br/>
And it is so mystical, this town of Thebes,<br/>
with its dark sanctuaries, once inhabited by gods<br/>
and symbols. All the sublime, fresh-minded<br/>
striving of the human soul after the Unknowable<br/>
is as it were petrified in these ruins, in forms<br/>
diverse and immeasurably grand. And subsisting thus down to our day it puts us to shame.<br/>
Compared with this people, who thought only<br/>
of eternity, we are a lot of pitiful dotards, who<br/>
soon will be past caring about the wherefore<br/>
of life, or thought, or death. Such beginnings<br/>
presaged, surely, something greater than our<br/>
humanity of the present day, given over to<br/>
despair, to alcohol and to explosives!<br/>
<br/>
Crumbling and dust! This same sun of<br/>
Thebes is in its place each day, parching,<br/>
exhausting, cracking and <span style="color: #ff0000;">pulverising</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
