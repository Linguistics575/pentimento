<span>The Mosques of Cairo 39<br/>
<br/>
were such delightful retreats. Neglected for<br/>
whole centuries, never repaired, notwithstanding<br/>
the veneration of their heedless worshippers, the<br/>
greater part of them were fallen into ruin; the<br/>
fine woodwork of their interiors had become<br/>
worm-eaten, their cupolas were cracked and<br/>
their mosaics covered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>as with a hail<br/>
of mother-of-pearl, of porphyry and marble. It<br/>
seemed that to repair all this was a task <span style="color: #0000FF;">incapable </span>of fulfilment; it was sheer folly, people<br/>
said, to conceive the idea of it.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, for nearly twenty years now an<br/>
army of workers has been at the task, sculptors,<br/>
marble-cutters, <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosaicists</span>. Already certain of<br/>
the sanctuaries, the most venerable of them<br/>
indeed, have been entirely renovated. After<br/>
having <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-echoed </span>for some years to the sounds<br/>
of hammers and Chisels, during the course of<br/>
these vast renovations, they are restored now<br/>
to peace and to prayer, and the birds have <span style="color: #0000FF;">recommenced </span>to build their nests in them.<br/>
<br/>
It will be the glory of the present reign that<br/>
it has preserved, before it was too late, all<br/>
this magnificent legacy of Moslem art. When<br/>
the city of "The Arabian Nights," which was<br/>
formerly there, shall have entirely disappeared, to<br/>
give place to a vulgar <span style="color: #ff0000;">entrep√©t </span>of commerce and<br/>
of pleasure, to which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">plutocracy </span>of the whole<br/>
world comes every winter to disport itself, so<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
