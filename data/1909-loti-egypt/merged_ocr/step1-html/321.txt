The cataract, on the other hand, has disappeared from Assouan. The tutelary Albion<br/>
wisely considered that it would be better to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>that futile spectacle and, in order to<br/>
increase the yield of the soil, to dam the waters<br/>
of the Nile by an artificial barrage<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>a work of<br/>
solid masonry which (in the words of the Programme of Pleasure Trips) "affords an interest<br/>
of a very different nature and degree "( sic).<br/>
<br/>
But nevertheless Cook & Son-a business<br/>
concern glossed with poetry, as all the world<br/>
knows-have <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to perpetuate the<br/>
memory of the cataract by giving its name to<br/>
a hotel of 500 rooms, which as a result of their<br/>
labours has been established opposite to those<br/>
rocks-now reduced to <span style="color: #0000FF;">silence-over </span>which the<br/>
old Nile used to seethe for so many centuries.<br/>
"Cataract Hotel "-that gives the illusion still,<br/>
does it <span style="color: #ff0000;">not'r-and </span>looks remarkably well at the<br/>
head of a sheet of notepaper.<br/>
<br/>
Cook & Son (Egypt Ltd.) have even gone<br/>
so far as to conceive the idea that it would be<br/>
original to give to their establishment a certain<br/>
cachet of Islam. And the dining-room reproduces (in imitation, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">course-but </span>then you<br/>
must not expect the impossible) the interior of<br/>
one of the mosques of Stamboul. At the<br/>
luncheon hour it is one of the prettiest sights<br/>
in the world to see, under this imitation holy<br/>
<br/>
