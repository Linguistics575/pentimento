<br/>
with its youth and stupendous duration. This<br/>
same sun had attained to its present round form,<br/>
had acquired the clear precision of its disc, and<br/>
begun its daily promenade over the country of<br/>
the sands, countless centuries of centuries, before it saw, as it might be yesterday, this town<br/>
of Thebes arise; an attempt at magnificence<br/>
which seemed to promise for the human pygmies<br/>
a sufficiently interesting future, but which, in<br/>
the event, we have not been able even to equal.<br/>
And it proved, too, a thing quite puny and<br/>
derisory, since here it is laid low, after having<br/>
subsisted barely four negligible thousands of<br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
An hour later we arrive at Luxor, and what<br/>
a surprise awaits us there!<br/>
<br/>
The thing which dominates the whole town,<br/>
and may be seen five <span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span>' six miles away, is<br/>
the Winter Palace, a hasty modern production<br/>
which has grown on the border of the Nile<br/>
during the past year'. a <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>hotel, obviously<br/>
sham, made of plaster and mud, on a framework<br/>
of iron. Twice 01' three times as high as the<br/>
admirable <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharaonie </span>Temple, its impudent <span style="color: #ff0000;">fapade<br/>
</span>rises there, painted a dirty yellow. One such<br/>
thing, it will readily be understood, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient<br/>
</span>to disfigure pitiably the whole of the surroundings.<br/>
The old Arab town, with its little white houses,<br/>
