<span>A Town Promptly Embellished 283<br/>

little too ready to <span style="color: #0000FF;">chide </span>their <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellow-countrymen</span>; whereas on the contrary they showed<br/>
themselves very respectful and obliging <span style="color: #0000FF;">whenever </span>they were addressed by a traveller in a<br/>
cork helmet. But that is in virtue of an equitable and logical principle, derived by them from<br/>
the high places of the new administration-namely, that the Egypt of to-day belongs far<br/>
less to the Egyptians than to the noble foreigners<br/>
who have come to brandish there the torch of<br/>
civilisation.<br/>
<br/>
In the evening, after dark, the really respectable travellers do not quit the brilliant dining<br/>
saloons of the hotels, and the quay is left quite<br/>
solitary beneath the stars. It is at such a<br/>
time that one is able to realise how extremely<br/>
hospitable certain of the natives are become.<br/>
If, in an hour of melancholy, you walk alone on<br/>
the bank of the Nile, smoking a cigarette, you<br/>
will not fail to be accosted by one of these<br/>
good people, who, misunderstanding the cause<br/>
of the unrest in your soul, offers eagerly, and<br/>
with a touching frankness, to introduce you to<br/>
the gayest of the young ladies of the country.<br/>
<br/>
In the other towns, which still remain purely<br/>
Egyptian, the people would never practise such<br/>
an excess of affability and good manners, which<br/>
have been learnt, beyond all question, from our<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">beneficent </span>contact.<br/>
