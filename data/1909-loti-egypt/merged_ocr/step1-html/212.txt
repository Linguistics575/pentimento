</span>the desert that is always present, dominating<br/>
everything, although scarcely noticed and, as it<br/>
were, latent.<br/>

And this morning, at the rising of the sun, is<br/>
pure and splendid as all other mornings. A tint<br/>

dawn, turn themselves, as if by force of some<br/>
attraction, towards a strange and quite unusual<br/>

midst of the mournful plains. At first it looks<br/>
like a mass of towering rocks, which in this hour<br/>
of twilight magic have taken on a pale violet<br/>
colour, and seem almost transparent. And the<br/>
sun, scarcely emerged from the desert, lights<br/>
them in a curious gradation, and borders their<br/>
contours with a fringe of fresh rose-colour. And<br/>
they are not rocks, in fact, for as we look more<br/>
closely, they show us lines symmetrical and<br/>
straight. Not rocks, but architectural masses,<br/>
tremendous and superhuman, placed there in<br/>
attitudes of quasi-eternal stability. And out of<br/>
them rise the points of two obelisks, sharp as the<br/>
