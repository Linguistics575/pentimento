<br/>
us through the ruins to the Easter mass, we<br/>
should think that we had lost our way.<br/>
<br/>
And how pretty they look, these women<br/>
draped like phantoms in their black silks. Their<br/>
long veils do not completely hide them, as do<br/>
those of the Moslems. They are simply placed<br/>
over their hair and leave uncovered the delicate<br/>
features, the golden necklet and the half-bared<br/>
arms that carry on their wrists thick twisted<br/>
bracelets of virgin gold. Pure Egyptians as<br/>
they are, they have preserved the same delicate<br/>
profile, the same elongated eyes, as mark the<br/>
old goddesses carved in bas-relief on the<br/>
Pharaonic walls. But some, alas, amongst<br/>
the young ones have discarded their traditional<br/>
costume, and are arrayed ('L la <span style="color: #0000FF;">franque</span>, in gowns<br/>
and hats. And such gowns, such hats, such<br/>
flowers! The very peasants of our meanest<br/>
villages would disdain them. Oh! why cannot<br/>
someone tell these poor little women, who have<br/>
it in their power to be so adorable, that the<br/>
beautiful folds of their black veils give to them<br/>
an exquisite and characteristic distinction, while<br/>
this poor tinsel, which recalls the mid-Lent<br/>
carnivals, makes of them objects that excite<br/>
our <span style="color: #0000FF;">pity</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
<br/>
</span>In one of the walls which now surround us<br/>
there is a low and shrinking doorway. Can this<br/>
be the entrance to the basilica? The idea seems<br/>
