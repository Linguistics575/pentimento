<br/>
where may be seen, with never a change at all,<br/>
the humble pastoral life of the fellahs. The sun<br/>
is burning, the starlit nights clear and cold. A<br/>
withering wind, which blows almost without<br/>
ceasing from the north, makes you shiver as<br/>
soon as the twilight falls.<br/>
<br/>
One may travel for league after league along<br/>
this slimy water and make head for days and<br/>
weeks against its current-which glides everlastingly past the dahabiya, in little hurrying<br/>
waves-without seeing this warm, fecundating<br/>
river, compared with which our rivers of France<br/>
are mere negligible streams, either diminish <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">increase </span>OI' hasten. And on the right and left<br/>
of us as we pass are unfolded indefinitely the<br/>
two parallel chains of barren limestone, which<br/>
imprison so narrowly the Egypt of the harvests<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
</span>on the west that of the Libyan desert, which<br/>
every morning the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>rays of the sun tint with<br/>
a rosy coral that nothing seems to dull; and in<br/>
the east that of the desert of Arabia, which<br/>
never fails in the evening to retain the light of<br/>
the setting sun, and looks then like a mournful<br/>
girdle of glowing embers. Sometimes the two<br/>
parallel walls sheer off and give more room to the<br/>
green fields, to the woods of palm-trees, and the<br/>
little oases, separated by streaks of golden sand.<br/>
Sometimes they approach so closely to the Nile<br/>
that habitable Egypt is no wider than some two<br/>
