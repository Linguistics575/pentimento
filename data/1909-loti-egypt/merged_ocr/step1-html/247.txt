again imitate the sound of a steel spring slowly<br/>
unwinding itself. And this concert comes always<br/>

wailings, that sometimes swell and sometimes<br/>
seem to be strangled and end in a kind of sob.<br/>

avenue of monstrous splendours, imprisoned and,<br/>
as it were, dwarfed between the rows of sovereign<br/>
stones. There are obelisks there, some upright,<br/>
