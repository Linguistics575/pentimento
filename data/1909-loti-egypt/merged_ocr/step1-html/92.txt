<span>66 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
busy discussing-as if it were a matter of actual<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">interest-a </span>controversial question concerning the<br/>
events which followed the death of the Prophet,<br/>
and the part played by Ali.... In that<br/>
moment how my good friend Mustapha, whom<br/>
I had seen so French in France, appeared all<br/>
at once a Moslem to the bottom of his soul!<br/>
The same thing is true indeed of the greater<br/>
number of these Orientals, who, if we meet them<br/>
in our own country, seem to be quite <span style="color: #ff0000;">parisianised</span>;<br/>
their modernity is only on the surface<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>in their<br/>
inmost souls Islam remains intact. And it is<br/>
not difficult to understand, perhaps, how the<br/>
spectacle of our troubles, our despairs, our<br/>
miseries, in these new ways in which our lot is<br/>
east, should make them <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflect </span>and turn again<br/>
to the tranquil dream of their ancestors....<br/>
While waiting for the conclusion of the morning studies, we are conducted through some of<br/>
the dependencies of El-Azhar. Halls of every<br/>
epoch, added one to another, go to form a little<br/>
labyrinth; many contain Mihrabs, which, as we<br/>
know already, are a kind of portico, festooned<br/>
and denticulated till they look as if covered with<br/>
rime. And library after library, with ceilings of<br/>
cedarwood, carved in times when men had more<br/>
leisure and more patience. Thousands of precious<br/>
manuscripts, dating back some hundreds of<br/>
years, but which here in El-Azhar are no whit<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
