and encumber the place with their fretful little<br/>
ones, have, in their own way, well understood<br/>
the words of Him who said<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>"Suffer the little<br/>
children to come unto Me, and do not forbid<br/>
them, for of such is the kingdom of <span style="color: #0000FF;">God</span>."<br/>
