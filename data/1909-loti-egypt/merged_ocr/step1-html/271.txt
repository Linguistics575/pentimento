<span>CHAPTER XVII<br/>
AN AUDIENCE OF AMENOPHIS II.<br/>
<br/>
KING <span style="color: #ff0000;">AMENOPHIs </span>II. has resumed his receptions,<br/>
which he found himself obliged to suspend for<br/>
three thousand, three hundred and some odd<br/>
years, by reason of his decease. They are very<br/>
well attended; court dress is not insisted upon,<br/>

taking a tip. He holds them every morning in<br/>

mountain in the desert of Libya; and if he rests<br/>

turn off the electric light.<br/>
<br/>

only one who has been left in his tomb. And<br/>
he "makes the most of <span style="color: #ff0000;">it </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>every time he opens<br/>
his funeral salons.<br/>
<br/>
It is important to arrive before midday at the<br/>
dwelling of this Pharaoh, and at eight <span style="color: #0000FF;">o'clock<br/>
</span>sharp, therefore, on a clear February morning, I<br/>
set out from Luxor, where for many days my<br/>
