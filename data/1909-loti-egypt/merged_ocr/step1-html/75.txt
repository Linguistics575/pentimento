<span>The Hall of the Mummies 49<br/>
<br/>
Although our little lantern maintains its light<br/>
we seem to see here less and <span style="color: #0000FF;">less</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the darkness<br/>
around us in these vast rooms becomes almost<br/>
overpowering-and these are the rooms, too, that,<br/>
leading one into the other, facilitate the midnight<br/>
promenade of those dread "forms "which, every<br/>
evening, are released and roam about....<br/>
<br/>
On a table in the middle of one of these rooms<br/>
a thing to make you shudder gleams in a glass<br/>
box, a fragile thing that failed of life some two<br/>
thousand years ago. It is the mummy of a<br/>
human embryo, and someone, to appease the<br/>
malice of this born-dead thing, had covered its<br/>
face with a coating of <span style="color: #0000FF;">gold-for</span>, according to the<br/>
belief of the Egyptians, these little abortions<br/>
became the evil genii of their families if proper<br/>
honour was not paid to them. At the end of its<br/>
negligible body, the gilded head, with its great<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fetus </span>eyes, is unforgettable for its suffering ugliness, for its frustrated and ferocious expression.<br/>
<br/>
In the halls into which we next penetrate<br/>
there are veritable dead bodies ranged on either<br/>
side of us as we pass; their <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>are displayed<br/>
in tiers one above the other; the air is heavy<br/>
with the sickly odour of mummies; and on the<br/>
ground, curled always like some huge serpent,<br/>
the leather hoses are in readiness, for here indeed<br/>
is the danger spot for fire.<br/>
<br/>
And the master of this strange house whispers<br/>
D<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
