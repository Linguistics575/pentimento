<span>The Downfall of the Nile 159<br/>
<br/>
And then too one mixes intimately with the<br/>
life of the river bank, which is still so absorbing<br/>
and, at certain hours, when the horizon is unsullied by the smoke of pit-coal, recalls you to<br/>
the days of artless toil and healthy beauty. In<br/>
the boats that meet us, half-naked men, revelling<br/>
in their movement, in the sun and air, sing, as<br/>
they ply their oars, those songs of the Nile that<br/>
are as old as Thebes <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Memphis. When the<br/>
wind rises there is a riotous unfurling of sails,<br/>
which, stretched on their long yards, give to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyas </span>the air of birds in full flight.<br/>
Bending right over in the wind, they skim along<br/>
with a lively motion, carrying their cargoes of<br/>
men and beasts and primitive things. Women<br/>
are there draped still in the ancient fashion, and<br/>
sheep and goats, and sometimes piles of fruit<br/>
and gourds, and sacks of grain. Many are laden<br/>
to the water's edge with those earthenware jars,<br/>
unchanged for 3000 years, which the fellaheens<br/>
know how to place on their heads with so much<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">g1'ace</span>---and one sees these heaps of fragile pottery<br/>
gliding along the water as if carried bythe gigantic<br/>
wings of a gull. And in the far-off, almost<br/>
fabulous, days the life of the mariners of the<br/>
Nile had the same aspect, as is shown by the<br/>
bas-reliefs on the oldest tombs; it required<br/>
the same play of muscles and of sails; was<br/>
accompanied no doubt by the same songs, and<br/>
