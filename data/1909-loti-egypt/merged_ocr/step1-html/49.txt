<span>The Passing of Cairo 27<br/>
<br/>
And nevertheless amongst the young <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moslcms<br/>
</span>and Copts now leaving the schools there are<br/>
so many of distinguished mind and superior<br/>
intelligence! When I see the things that are<br/>
here, see them with the fresh eyes of a stranger,<br/>
landed but yesterday upon this soil, impregnated<br/>
with the glory of antiquity, I want to cry out<br/>
to them, with a frankness that is brutal perhaps,<br/>
but with a profound sympathy<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>"Bestir yourselves before it is too late. Defend<br/>
yourselves against this disintegrating invasion-not by force, be it understood, not by inhospitality or <span style="color: #ff0000;">ill-humour-hat </span>by disdaining this<br/>
Occidental rubbish, this last year's frippery by<br/>
which you are inundated. Try to preserve not<br/>
only your traditions and your admirable Arab<br/>
language, but also the grace and mystery that<br/>
used to <span style="color: #ff0000;">characterise </span>your town, the refined<br/>
luxury of your dwelling-houses. It is not a<br/>
question now of a poet's fancy; your national<br/>
dignity is at stake. You are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Orientals</span>--<span style="color: #ff0000;">-l </span>pronounce respectfully that word, which <span style="color: #ff0000;">implies<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>a whole past of early civilisation, of unmingled<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">greatness-hut </span>in a few years, unless you are on<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">your </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">guard</span>, you will have become mere Levantine<br/>
brokers, exclusively preoccupied with the price<br/>
of land and the rise in cotton."<br/>
