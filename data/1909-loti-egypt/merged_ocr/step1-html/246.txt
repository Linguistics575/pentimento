smallest stone, if it fell, would crush twenty<br/>

First of all an osprey sounds the prelude, above<br/>
my head and so close to me that it holds me<br/>
trembling throughout its long cry. Then other<br/>
voices answer from the depths of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins</span>, voices<br/>
very diverse, but all sinister. Some are only<br/>
able to mew on two long-drawn notes: some<br/>
