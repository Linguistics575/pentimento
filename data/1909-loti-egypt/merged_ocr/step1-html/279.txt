<span>An Audience of Amenophis II. 241<br/>
<br/>
swathed like dead Pharaohs, stand upright, with<br/>
hands crossed beneath their shroud of sandstone.<br/>
They are the temples and statues for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">manes </span>of<br/>
numberless kings and queens, who during three<br/>
or four thousand years had their mummies buried<br/>
hard by in the heart of the mountains, in the<br/>
deepest of the walled and secret galleries.<br/>
<br/>
And now the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eomfields </span>have ceased; there is<br/>
no longer any <span style="color: #0000FF;">herbage-nothing</span>. We have<br/>
crossed the desolate threshold, we are in the<br/>
desert, and tread suddenly upon a disquieting<br/>
funereal soil, half sand, half ashes, that is pitted<br/>
on all sides with gaping holes. It looks like<br/>
some region that had long been undermined by<br/>
burrowing beasts. But it is men who, for more<br/>
than fifty centuries, have vexed this ground, first<br/>
to hide the mummies in it, and afterwards, and<br/>
until our day, to exhume them. Each of these<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>holes has enclosed its corpse, and if you peer<br/>
within you may see yellow-coloured rags still<br/>
trailing there; and bandages, or legs and vertebrae of thousands of years ago. Some lean<br/>
Bedouins, who exercise the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>of excavators,<br/>
and sleep hard by in holes like jackals, advance<br/>
to sell us <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarabaei</span>, blue-glass trinkets that are<br/>
half fossilised, and feet or hands of the dead.<br/>
<br/>
And now farewell to the fresh morning.<br/>
Every minute the heat becomes more oppressive. The pathway that is marked only by a<br/>
<br/>
