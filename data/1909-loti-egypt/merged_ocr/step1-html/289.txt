<span>An Audience of Amenophis II. 251<br/>
<br/>
appear, pillagers of tombs, no doubt, come to<br/>
unswathe them all! But <span style="color: #0000FF;">no</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>Only some<br/>
priests of Osiris, advancing with fear in a funeral<br/>
procession. They brought nine great <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins<br/>
</span>containing the mummies of nine kings, his sons,<br/>
grandsons and other unknown successors, down<br/>
to that King Setnakht, who governed Egypt two<br/>
and a half centuries after him. It was simply to<br/>
hide them better that they brought them hither,<br/>
and placed them all together in a chamber that<br/>
was immediately walled up. Then they departed.<br/>
The stones of the door were sealed afresh, and<br/>
everything fell again into the old mournful and<br/>
burning darkness.<br/>
<br/>
Slowly the centuries rolled on-perhaps ten,<br/>
perhaps twenty---in a silence no longer even<br/>
disturbed by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">seratehings </span>of the worms, long<br/>
since dead. And a day came when, at the side<br/>
of the entrance, the same blows were heard<br/>
again.... And this time it was the robbers.<br/>
Carrying torches in their hands, they rushed<br/>
headlong in, with shouts and cries and, except in<br/>
the safe hiding-place of the nine <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins</span>, everything was plundered, the bandages torn off, the<br/>
golden trinkets snatched from the necks of the<br/>
mummies. Then, when they had sorted their<br/>
booty, they walled up the entrance as before, and<br/>
went their way, leaving an inextricable confusion<br/>
of shrouds, of human bodies, of entrails issuing<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
