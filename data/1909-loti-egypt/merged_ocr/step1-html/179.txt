<span>CHAPTER XI<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>DOWNFALL OF THE NILE<br/>
<br/>
SOME thousands of years ago, at the beginning<br/>
of our geological period, when the continents<br/>
had taken, in the last great upheaval, almost the<br/>
forms by which we now know them, and when<br/>
the rivers began to trace their hesitating courses,<br/>
it happened that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rains </span>of a whole watershed<br/>
of Africa were precipitated in one formidable<br/>
torrent across the uninhabitable region which<br/>
stretches from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean,<br/>
and is called the region of the deserts. And<br/>
this enormous waterway, lost as it was in the<br/>
sands, by-and-by regulated its course<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>it became<br/>
the Nile, and with untiring patience set itself to<br/>
its proper task of river, which in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">accursed<br/>
</span>zone might well have seemed an impossible one.<br/>
First it had to round all the blocks of granite<br/>
scattered in its way in the high plains of Nubia;<br/>
and then, and more especially, to deposit, little<br/>
by little, successive layers of mud, to form a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">living </span>artery, to create, as it were, a long, green<br/>
ribbon in the midst of this infinite domain of<br/>
death.<br/>
<br/>
How long ago is it since the work of the great<br/>
