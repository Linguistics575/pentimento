<span>In the Temple of the Ogress 271<br/>
<br/>
like rain, crash into and annihilate one another,<br/>
only to be renewed for fresh eternities.<br/>
<br/>
All this is seen too vividly, the horror of it<br/>
becomes intolerable, on a clear night like this,<br/>
in a place so silent and littered so with ruins.<br/>
More and more the cold penetrates <span style="color: #ff0000;">you</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>
</span>mournful cold of the sidereal spheres from which<br/>
nothing now seems to protect you, so <span style="color: #ff0000;">1arefied<br/>
</span>---almost non-existent-does the limpid atmosphere appear. And the gravel, the poor dried<br/>
herbs, that crackle under foot, give the illusion<br/>
of the crunching noise we know at home on<br/>
winter nights when the frost is on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">approach </span>at length the temple of the Ogress.<br/>
These stones which now appear, whitish in the<br/>
night, this <span style="color: #0000FF;">secret-looking </span>dwelling near the<br/>
boundary wall of Thebes, proclaim the spot, and<br/>
verily at such an hour as this it has an evil<br/>
aspect. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>columns, little vestibule,<br/>
little courtyards where a dim blue light enables<br/>
you to find your way. Nothing moves; not<br/>
even the flight of a night bird: an absolute<br/>
silence, magnified awfully by the presence of the<br/>
desert which you feel encompasses you beyond<br/>
these walls. And beyond, at the bottom, three<br/>
chambers made of massive stone, each with its<br/>
separate entrance. I know that the first two are<br/>
empty. It is in the third that the Ogress dwells,<br/>
unless, indeed, she have already set out upon her<br/>
<br/>
