<span>In the Temple of the Ogress 273<br/>
<br/>
In the dark retreat, enclosed with defaced<br/>
stones, in the little temple where she stands,<br/>
alone, upright and grand, with her enormous<br/>
head and thrust-out chin and tall goddess' headdress-one is necessarily quite close to her. In<br/>
touching her, at night, you are astonished to find<br/>
that she is less cold than the air; she becomes<br/>
somebody, and the intolerable dead stare seems<br/>
to weigh you down.<br/>
<br/>
During the <span style="color: #0000FF;">the-d-the</span>, one thinks involuntarily<br/>
of the surroundings, of these ruins in the desert,<br/>
of the prevailing nothingness, of the cold beneath<br/>
the stars. And, now, that summation of doubt<br/>
and despair and terror, which such an assemblage<br/>
of things inspires in you, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmed</span>, if one may<br/>
say so, by the meeting with this divinity-symbol,<br/>
which awaits you at the end of the journey, to<br/>
receive ironically all human prayer; a rigid<br/>
horror of granite, with an implacable smile and<br/>
a devouring jaw.<br/>
