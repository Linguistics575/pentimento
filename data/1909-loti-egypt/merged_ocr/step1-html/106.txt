<br/>
three pyramids indeed we can discern at the<br/>
extreme limit of the view, prolonging almost to<br/>
infinity for our eyes this domain of mummies.<br/>
There is nobody to be seen, nor any indication<br/>
of the present day, amongst these mournful undulations of yellow or pale grey sand, in which we<br/>
seem <span style="color: #0000FF;">lost </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>in the swell of an ocean. The sky<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">cloudy-such </span>as you can scarcely imagine the<br/>
sky of Egypt. And in this immense nothingness<br/>
of sand and stones, which stands out now more<br/>
clearly against the clouds on the horizon, there is<br/>
nothing anywhere save the silhouettes of those<br/>
eternal <span style="color: #0000FF;">triangles</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the pyramids, gigantic things<br/>
which rise here and there at hazard, some half in<br/>
ruin, others almost intact and preserving still<br/>
their sharp point. To-day they are the only<br/>
landmarks of this necropolis, which is nearly six<br/>
miles in length, and was formerly covered by<br/>
temples of a magnificence and a vastness unimaginable to the minds of our day. Except<br/>
for one which is quite near us (the fantastic grandfather of the others, that of King Zoser, who<br/>
died nearly 5000 years ago), except for this one,<br/>
which is made of six colossal superposed terraces,<br/>
they are all built after that same conception of<br/>
the Triangle, which is at once the most mysteriously simple figure of geometry, and the strongest<br/>
and most permanently stable form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">architecture</span>. And now that there remains no trace of<br/>
<br/>
