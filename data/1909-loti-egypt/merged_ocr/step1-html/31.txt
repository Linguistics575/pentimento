<span>A Winter Midnight <span style="color: #0000FF;">13<br/>
<br/>
</span>withheld in melancholy irony, is this: that all<br/>
these dead men and women who sleep in the<br/>
vast necropolis below <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>been fooled, and the<br/>
awakening signal has not sounded for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>single<br/>
one of them; and that the creation of mankind<br/>
--mankind that thinks and suffers-has had no<br/>
rational explanation, and that our poor aspirations are vain, but so vain as to awaken pity.<br/>
