<span>The Race of Bronze 121<br/>
<br/>
deluged at each rising of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>overflowing bucket,<br/>
stream constantly with <span style="color: #0000FF;">cold </span>water; and sometimes the wind is icy, even while the sun burns;<br/>
but these perpetual workers are, as we have said,<br/>
of bronze, and their hardened bodies take no<br/>
harm.<br/>
<br/>
These men are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fcllahs</span>, the peasants of the<br/>
valley <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Nile-pure Egyptians, whose type<br/>
has not changed in the course of centuries. In<br/>
the oldest of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bas-reliefs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hebes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Memphis<br/>
you may see many such, with the same noble<br/>
profile and <span style="color: #0000FF;">thickish </span>lips, the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">elongated </span>eyes<br/>
shadowed by heavy eyelids, the same slender<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">figure</span>, surmounted by broad shoulders.<br/>
<br/>
The women who from time to time <span style="color: #0000FF;">descend<br/>
</span>to the river, to draw water also, but in their<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>in the vases of <span style="color: #0000FF;">potters</span>' clay which <span style="color: #0000FF;">they<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">arry</span>--this fetching and carrying of the lifegiving water is the one primordial occupation in<br/>
this Egypt, which has no <span style="color: #0000FF;">rain</span>, nor any living<br/>
spring, and subsists only by its <span style="color: #0000FF;">river-thee<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">women </span>walk and posture with an inimitable<br/>
grace, draped in black veils, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">even </span>the<br/>
poorest allow to trail behind them, like the train<br/>
of a court dress. In this bright land, with its<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rose-coloured </span>distances, it is strange to see them,<br/>
all so <span style="color: #0000FF;">sombrely </span>clothed, spots of mourning, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>it<br/>
were, in the gay fields and the flaring desert.<br/>
Machine-like creatures, all untaught, <span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>yet<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
