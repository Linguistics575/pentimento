<span>Evening at Thebes 195<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, four thousand years ago, Thebes<br/>
was in the height of her glory, encumbered with<br/>
gods and with magnificence, the focus of the<br/>
light of the world in the most ancient historic<br/>
periods; while our Occident was still asleep<br/>
and Greece and Assyria were scarcely awakened.<br/>
Only in the extreme East, a humanity of a<br/>
different race, the yellow people, called to follow<br/>
in totally different ways, was fixing, so that they<br/>
remain even to our day, the oblique lines of its<br/>
angular roofs and the rictus of its monsters.<br/>
<br/>
The men of Thebes, if they still saw too<br/>
massively and too vastly, at least saw straight;<br/>
they saw calmly, at the same time as they saw<br/>
for ever. Their conceptions, which had begun to<br/>
inspire those of Greece, were afterwards in some<br/>
measure to inspire our own. In religion, in art,<br/>
in beauty under all its aspects, they were as<br/>
much our ancestors as were the Aryans.<br/>
<br/>
Later again, sixteen hundred years before the<br/>
birth of Christ, in one of the apogees of the town<br/>
which, in the course of its interminable duration,<br/>
experienced so many <span style="color: #0000FF;">fluctuations</span>, some ostentatious kings thought fit to build on this ground,<br/>
already covered with temples, that which still<br/>
remains the most arresting marvel of the ruins<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
</span>the hypostyle hall, dedicated to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">God </span>Amen,<br/>
with its forest of columns, as monstrous as the<br/>
trunk of the baobab and as high as towers,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
