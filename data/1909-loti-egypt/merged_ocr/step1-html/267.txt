<span>Thebes in Sunlight 233<br/>
<br/>
On the ground where once stood so much<br/>
magnificence there are fields of corn, spread out<br/>
like green carpets, which tell of the return of the<br/>
humble life of tillage. Above all, there is the<br/>
sand, encroaching now upon the very threshold<br/>
of the Pharaohs; there is the yellow desert; there<br/>
is the world of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1xefleetions </span>and of silence, which<br/>
approaches like a slow submerging tide. In<br/>
the distance, where the mirage trembles from<br/>
morning till evening, the burying is already<br/>
almost achieved. The few poor stones which<br/>
still appear, barely emerging from the advancing<br/>
dunes, are the remains of what men, in their<br/>
superb revolts against death, had contrived to<br/>
make the most massively indestructible.<br/>
<br/>
And this sun, this eternal sun, which parades<br/>
over Thebes the irony of its duration-for us so<br/>
impossible to calculate or to conceive! <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nowhere </span>so much as here does one suffer from the<br/>
dismay of knowing that all our miserable little<br/>
human effervescence is only a sort of fermentation round an atom emanated from that sinister<br/>
ball of fire, and that that fire itself, the wonderful sun, is no more than an ephemeral meteor,<br/>
a furtive spark, thrown off during one of the<br/>
innumerable cosmic transformations, in the<br/>
course of times without end and without<br/>
beginning.<br/>
