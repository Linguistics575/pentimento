<span>I 3 8 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
ever have happened to them, must date back to<br/>
a time long anterior to their enrolment. And I<br/>
remain <span style="color: #0000FF;">perplexed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1<br/>
<br/>
</span>Without conviction now, we make our way<br/>
towards another temple, guaranteed solitary.<br/>
Indeed the sun blazes there a lonely sovereign in<br/>
the midst of a profound silence, and Egypt and<br/>
the past take us again into their folds.<br/>
<br/>
Once more to Osiris, the god of heavenly<br/>
awakening in the necropolis of Abydos, this<br/>
sanctuary was built by Ramses II. But the<br/>
sands have covered it with their winding sheet<br/>
in vain, and have been able to preserve for us<br/>
only the lower and more deeply buried parts.<br/>
Men in their blind greed have destroyed the<br/>
upper <span style="color: #ff0000;">portions,1 </span>and its ruins, protected and<br/>
cleared as they are to-day, rise only some ten<br/>
or twelve feet from the ground. In the basreliefs the majority of the figures have only<br/>
legs and a portion of the body; their heads<br/>
and shoulders have disappeared with the upper<br/>
parts of the walls. But they seem to have<br/>
preserved their vitality: the gesticulations, the<br/>
exaggerated pantomime of the attitudes of these<br/>
headless things, are more strange, more striking,<br/>
<br/>
1 Not long ago a manufacturer, established in the neighbourhood, discovering that the limestone of its walls was<br/>
friable, used this temple as a quarry, and for some years basreliefs beyond <span style="color: #0000FF;">price </span>served as aliment to the mills of the<br/>
factory<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
