<br/>
</span>silhouette, like a screen before the light it seemed<br/>
to be regarding, and the lappets of its headgear showed like downhanging ears. And then<br/>
gradually, as we walked on, we saw it in profile,<br/>
shorn of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">nose-flat-nasal </span>like a death's head<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">-hut </span>having already an expression even when<br/>

smile. And when at length we arrived before<br/>
the colossal <span style="color: #0000FF;">visage</span>, face to face with it-without<br/>
however encountering its gaze, which passed high<br/>
above our heads-there came over us at once<br/>
the sentiment of all the secret thought which<br/>
these men of old contrived to incorporate and<br/>
make eternal behind this mutilated mask.<br/>

so scarred by time, and by the hands of iconoclasts; so dilapidated, broken and diminished,<br/>
that it is as inexpressive as the crumbling<br/>
mummies found in the sarcophagi, which no<br/>
longer even ape humanity. But after the manner of all phantoms it comes to life again at<br/>
night, beneath the enchantments of the moon.<br/>
For the men of its time whom did it represent?<br/>
King Amenemhat? The Sun Cod? Who can<br/>
rightly tell? Of all hieroglyphic images it<br/>
remains the one least understood. The unfathomable thinkers of Egypt symbolised every<br/>
