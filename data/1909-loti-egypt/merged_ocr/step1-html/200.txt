<span>I 66 Egypt<br/>
<br/>
sadness on this sea of meadows, which spread<br/>
their peace where once was a centre of <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificence</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The wind now rises in sharp, lashing gusts<br/>
-the wind of Egypt that never seems to fall,<br/>
and is bitter and wintry for all the burning of<br/>
the sun. The growing <span style="color: #0000FF;">corn </span>bends before it,<br/>
showing the gloss of its young quivering leaves,<br/>
and the herded beasts move close to one another<br/>
and turn their backs to the squall.<br/>
<br/>
As we draw nearer to this singular hill it is<br/>
revealed as a mass of ruins. And the ruins are<br/>
all of a kind, of a brownish-red. They are the remains of the colonial towns of the Romans, which<br/>
subsisted here for some two or three hundred<br/>
years (an almost negligible moment of time in<br/>
the long history of Egypt), and then fell to pieces,<br/>
to become in time mere shapeless mounds on the<br/>
fertile margins of the Nile and sometimes even in<br/>
the submerging sands.<br/>
<br/>
A heap of little reddish bricks that once were<br/>
fashioned into houses; a heap of broken jars<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">amphoras</span>--myriads of them-that served to<br/>
carry the water from the old nourishing river;<br/>
and the remains of walls, repaired at diverse<br/>
epochs, where stones inscribed with hieroglyphs<br/>
lie upside down against fragments of Grecian<br/>
obelisks or Coptic sculptures or Roman capitals.<br/>
In our countries, where the past is of yesterday,<br/>
<br/>
