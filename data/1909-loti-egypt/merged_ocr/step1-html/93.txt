out of date. Open, in glass cases, are numerous<br/>
inestimable Korans, which in olden times had<br/>
been written fair and illuminated on parchment<br/>
by pious khedives. And, in a place of honour,<br/>
a large astronomical glass, through which men<br/>
watch the rising of the moon of Ramadan....<br/>
All this savours of the past. And what is being<br/>
taught to-day to the ten thousand students of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Azhar </span>scarcely differs from what was taught<br/>
to their predecessors in the glorious reign of the<br/>
Fatimites-and which was then transcendent and<br/>
even new'. the Koran and all its commentaries;<br/>
the subtleties of syntax and of pronunciation;<br/>
jurisprudence; calligraphy, which still is dear to<br/>
the heart of Orientals; <span style="color: #0000FF;">versification</span>; and, last of<br/>
all, mathematics, of which the Arabs were the<br/>
inventors.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, all this savours of the past, of the dust of<br/>
remote ages. And though, assuredly, the priests<br/>
trained in this thousand-year-old university may<br/>
grow to men of rarest soul, they will remain,<br/>
these calm and noble dreamers, merely laggards,<br/>
safe in their shelter from the whirlwind which<br/>
carries us along.<br/>

instruct is to do an act of charity."<br/>
