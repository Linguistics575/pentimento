<br/>
the same axis as the empty eyes of the mummy.<br/>
Sometimes, too, this double, escaping from the<br/>
mummy and its box, used to wander like a<br/>
phantom about the hypogeum. And, in order<br/>
that at such times it might be able to obtain<br/>
nourishment, a mass of mummified viands<br/>
wrapped in bandages were amongst the thousand<br/>
and one things buried at its side. Even <span style="color: #0000FF;">natron<br/>
</span>and oils were left, so that it might re-embalm<br/>

years passed in the company of certain familiars,<br/>
lulled in the same heavy slumber as himself, he<br/>
heard the sound of muffled blows in the distance,<br/>
by the side of the hidden well. The secret<br/>
entrance was discovered: men were breaking<br/>
through its walls! Living beings were about to<br/>
