<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">6 </span>Egypt<br/>
<br/>
fifteen million pounds have done their work<br/>
conscientiously.<br/>
<br/>
Everywhere is the blinding glare of the electric<br/>
light; <span style="color: #0000FF;">monstrous </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hotels </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">parade </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>sham splendour<br/>
of their painted <span style="color: #ff0000;">fapades</span>; the whole length of<br/>
the streets is one long triumph of imitation, of<br/>
mud walls plastered so as to look like stone; a<br/>
medley of all styles, rockwork, Roman, Gothic,<br/>
New Art, Pharaonic, and, above all, the pretentious and the absurd. Innumerable <span style="color: #ff0000;">publichouses </span>overflow with bottles; every alcoholic<br/>
drink, all the poisons of the West, are here turned<br/>
into Egypt with a take-what-you-please.<br/>
<br/>
And taverns, gambling dens and houses of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ill</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fame</span>. And parading the side-walks, numerous<br/>
Levantine damsels, who seek by their <span style="color: #0000FF;">finely </span>to<br/>
imitate their fellows of the Paris boulevards, but<br/>
who by mistake, as we must suppose, have placed<br/>
their orders with some costumier for performing<br/>
dogs.<br/>
<br/>
This then is the Cairo of the future, this<br/>
cosmopolitan fair! Good heavens! When will<br/>
the Egyptians recollect themselves, when will<br/>
they realise that their forebears have left to them<br/>
an inalienable patrimony of art, of architecture<br/>
and exquisite refinement; and that, by their<br/>
negligence, one of those towns which used to be<br/>
the most beautiful in the world is falling into<br/>
ruin and about to perish?<br/>
