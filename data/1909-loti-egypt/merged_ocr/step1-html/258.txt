who in the carrying and piling of such masses<br/>
had to bear the yoke for thirty centuries.<br/>
<br/>
Even the stones themselves tell of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fatigue-the </span>fatigue of being crushed by one another's<br/>
weight for thousands of years; the suffering that<br/>
comes of having been too exactly carved, and<br/>
too nicely placed one above the other, so that<br/>
they seem to be riveted together by the force of<br/>
their mere weight. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>the poor stones of the<br/>
base that bear the weight of these awful pilings!<br/>
<br/>
And the ardent colour of these things surprises<br/>
you. It has persisted. On the red sandstone of<br/>
the hypostyle, the paintings of more than three<br/>
thousand years ago are still to be seen; especially<br/>
above the central chamber, almost in the sky,<br/>
the capitals, in the form of great flowers, have<br/>
kept the lapis blues, the greens and yellows<br/>
with which their strange petals were long ago<br/>
bespeckled.<br/>
<br/>
Decrepitude and crumbling and dust. In<br/>
broad daylight, under the magnificent splendour<br/>
of the life-giving sun, one realises clearly that all<br/>
here is dead, and dead since days which the<br/>
imagination is scarcely able to conceive. And<br/>
the ruin appears utterly irreparable. Here and<br/>
there are a few impotent and almost infantine<br/>
attempts at reparation, undertaken in the ancient<br/>
epochs of history by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creeks </span>and Romans.<br/>
Columns have been put together, holes have been<br/>
