<br/>
</span>columns a crowd of people passes, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baedekers<br/>
</span>in their hands, the same people that one sees<br/>
here everywhere, the same world as frequents<br/>
Nice and the Riviera. And, to crown the<br/>
mockery, the noise of the dynamos pursues us<br/>
even here, for the boats of Messrs Cook are<br/>
moored to the bank close by.<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of columns, columns which are<br/>
anterior by many centuries to those of Greece,<br/>
and represent, in their naive enormity, the first<br/>
conceptions of the human brain. Some are fluted<br/>
and give the impression of sheaves of monstrous<br/>
reeds; others, quite plain and simple, imitate the<br/>
stem of the papyrus, and bear by way of capital<br/>
its strange flower. The tourists, like the flies,<br/>
enter at certain times of the day, which it suffices<br/>
to know. Soon the little bells of the hotels will<br/>
call them away and the hour of midday will find<br/>
me here alone. But what in heaven's name will<br/>
deliver me from the noise of the dynamos? But<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">look</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>beyond there, at the bottom of the<br/>
sanctuaries, in the part which should be the holy<br/>
of holies, that great fresco, now half <span style="color: #0000FF;">effaced</span>,<br/>
but still clearly visible on the wall-how unexpected and arresting it is! An image of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Christ</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span>Christ crowned with the Byzantine<br/>
aureole. It has been painted on a coarse plaster,<br/>
which seems to have been added by an unskilful<br/>
hand, and is wearing off and exposing the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
