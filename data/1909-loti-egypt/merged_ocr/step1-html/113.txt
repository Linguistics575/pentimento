shines low down from between two clouds, enter<br/>
through a window opening on to the surrounding<br/>
desolation; and the light comes mournfully,<br/>
yellowed by the sand and the evening.<br/>

The master of the house, while his Bedouin<br/>
servants are gone to open and light up for us<br/>
the underground habitations of the Apis, shows<br/>
us his latest astonishing find, made this morning<br/>
in a hypogeum of one of the most ancient<br/>
dynasties. It is there on a table, a group of<br/>
little people of wood, of the size of the marionettes of our theatres. And since it was the<br/>
custom to put in a tomb only those figures or<br/>
objects which were most pleasing to him who<br/>
dwelt in it, the man-mummy to whom this<br/>
toy was offered in times anterior to all precise<br/>
chronology must have been extremely partial to<br/>
dancing-girls. In the middle of the group the<br/>
man himself is represented, sitting in an armchair, and on his knee he holds his favourite<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dancing-girl</span>. Other girls posture before him<br/>
in a dance of the period; and on the ground sit<br/>
musicians touching tambourines and strangely<br/>
fashioned harps. All wear their hair in a long<br/>
plait, which falls below their shoulders like the<br/>
pigtail of the Chinese. It was the distinguishing<br/>
mark of these kinds of <span style="color: #0000FF;">courtesans</span>. And these<br/>
little people had kept their pose in the darkness<br/>
