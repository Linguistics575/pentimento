</span>silent recess, where we may moor our dahabiya<br/>
against the venerable earth of the bank.<br/>
<br/>
And so one goes on, for days and weeks,<br/>
between these two interminable cliffs of reddish<br/>
chalk, filled with their hypogea and mummies,<br/>
which are the walls of the valley of the Nile,<br/>
and will follow us up to the first cataract, until<br/>
our entrance into Nubia. There only will the<br/>
appearance and nature of the rocks of the desert<br/>
change, to become the more sombre granite<br/>
out of which the Pharaohs carved their obelisks<br/>
and the great figures of their gods.<br/>
<br/>
We go on and on, ascending the thread of this<br/>
eternal current, and the regularity of the wind,<br/>
the persistent clearness of the sky, the monotony<br/>
of the great river, which winds but never ends,<br/>
all conspire to make us forget the hours and days<br/>
that pass. However deceived and disappointed<br/>
we may be at seeing the profanation of the river<br/>
banks, here, nevertheless, isolated on the water,<br/>
we do not lose the peace of being a wanderer, a<br/>
stranger amongst an equipage of silent Arabs,<br/>
who every evening prostrate themselves in <span style="color: #0000FF;">confiding </span>prayer.<br/>
<br/>
And, moreover, we are moving towards the<br/>
south, towards the sun, and every day has a more<br/>
entrancing clearness, a more caressing warmth,<br/>
and the bronze of the faces that we see on our<br/>
way takes on a deeper tint.<br/>
