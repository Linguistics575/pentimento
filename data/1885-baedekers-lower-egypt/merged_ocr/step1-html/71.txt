with the slender <span style="color: #ff0000;">ilgure </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fella </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>or the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corpulence </span>of the Turk.<br/>
Among the lower classes frequent intermarriage with negro women<br/>
has darkened the complexion and thickened the features of their<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offspring</span>; while the higher ranks, being descended from white<br/>
slaves or Turkish mothers, more <span style="color: #ff0000;">nearlyresemhle </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>type.<br/>
As the inhabitants of the towns could not be so much oppressed by<br/>
their rulers as the peasantry, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>that they exhibit a more independent spirit, greater enterprise, and a more cheerful disposition<br/>
than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellzihin</span>. At the same time they are not free from the<br/>
dreamy character peculiar to Orientals, nor from a tinge of the apathy<br/>
of fatalism; and their <span style="color: #ff0000;">indolenee </span>contrasts <span style="color: #0000FF;">strongly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the industry<br/>
of their European rivals in political, <span style="color: #ff0000;">seientifie</span>, artistic, and all<br/>
business pursuits. A glance at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices </span>of the ministers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>bazaars of the merchants, the schools of the Arabs, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">buildingyards </span>and workshops <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructed </span>by natives will enable the traveller<br/>
to observe with what deliberation and with what numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">intervals </span>of repose they perform their tasks. From such workers it is<br/>
in vain to expect rapidity, punctuality, or work of a highly <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished<br/>
</span>character, and the caustic remark of Prince Napoleon that the Egyptians <span style="color: #ff0000;">are'eapable </span>of making a pair of <span style="color: #0000FF;">pantaloons</span>, but never of<br/>
sewing <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the last button', was doubtless founded on experience.<br/>
The townspeople profess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islamism</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">but</span>, in their youth particularly,<br/>
they are becoming more and more <span style="color: #0000FF;">lax </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>their obedience to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karim</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>Thus the custom of praying in public, outside the house-doors and<br/>
shops, is gradually falling into disuse<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The European dress, moreover, is gradually superseding the Oriental, though the latter is far<br/>
more picturesque, and better suited to the climate <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the whole,<br/>
however, they are bigoted <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedans</span>, and share the contempt<br/>
with which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fell√©hin </span>regard all other religions. Their daily intercourse with unbelievers and their dread of the power of the Christian <span style="color: #0000FF;">nations </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tend</span>, however, to keep their fanaticism, which otherwise<br/>
would be unbounded, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">check</span>, and has even induced them to admit<br/>
strangers to witness the most sacred ceremonies in their mosques.<br/>
<br/>
(5). <span style="color: #0000FF;">BERBERS</span>. The name <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berberi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">olur</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">barabm</span>) is believed<br/>
by many authorities to be identical with'barbarians', a word <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>is said to have been adopted <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Greeks from the Egyptians, who<br/>
used it to denote all'non-Egyptians', and to be derived from brr,<br/>
i. e.'to be unable to speak', or'to speak imperfectly'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The'Bee<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bers</span>' of <span style="color: #ff0000;">N.Afriea </span>and the town of'Berber' in S. Nubia also doubtless have the same origin<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In Egypt the name is applied in a half<br/>
contemptuous way to the numerous immigrants from the Nubian<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>About the year 1865 a kind of uniform <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the'haarhuliaa</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>prescribed by the government for <span style="color: #ff0000;">all </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">nmcmis </span>of the higher classes<br/>
(black <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent </span>with a row of buttons and low upright <span style="color: #ff0000;">collar</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, but they are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">allowed </span>to wear ordinary European clothing in their <span style="color: #ff0000;">offiees</span>. All the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">amends</span>, however, in the pay of the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">government</span>, including <span style="color: #ff0000;">Enmpem</span>, and even the members <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the mixed court of justice, <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>wear<br/>
