<br/>
he <span style="color: #0000FF;">marriage-contract </span>is now complete. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Before </span>the wedding the<br/>
bride is conducted in gala attire and with great ceremony to the<br/>
bath. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">procession </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">We/ret </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cl </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ytrrnvrrfrrt</span>'. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">headed<br/>
</span>by several musicians with <span style="color: #0000FF;">hautbois </span>and drums; these are followed<br/>
by several married friends and relations of the bride in pairs, and<br/>
after these come a number <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">young </span>girls. The bride is entirely concealed by the clothing she wears, being usually enveloped from head<br/>
to foot in a cashmere shawl, and wearing on her head a small <span style="color: #ff0000;">cap</span>, or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">crown</span>, of pasteboard. The procession moves <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>slowly, and another<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">body </span>of musicians brings up the rear<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The hideous shrieks of joy<br/>
which women <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lower </span>classes utter on the occurrence of any <span style="color: #0000FF;">Som-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sational </span>event are <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sagltfrft</span>. The bride is afterwards conducted<br/>
with the same formalities to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">house </span>of her husband<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The ceremonies observed at funerals are not less remarkable<br/>
than those <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>attend weddings. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>the death <span style="color: #0000FF;">occurs </span>in the morning, the funeral takes place the same day; but if in the evening,<br/>
it is postponed till next <span style="color: #0000FF;">day</span>. The body is <span style="color: #0000FF;">washed </span>and mourned<br/>
over by the family and the professional mourning women (<span style="color: #ff0000;">ruuld0belts</span>; a custom prohibited by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mobammed</span>, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>dating from the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">&</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'motest </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquity </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ffo</span>, or schoolmaster<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>reads several <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strees<br/>
</span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iiortn </span>by its side; after this, it is wrapped in its winding<br/>
sheet, <span style="color: #0000FF;">plated </span>on the bier, covered with a red or green <span style="color: #0000FF;">cloth</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and<br/>
then carried forth in solemn procession. The foremost persons in<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eortiige </span>are usually six or more poor, and generally blind, <span style="color: #0000FF;">men</span>,<br/>
who walk in <span style="color: #0000FF;">two</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>or threes at a slow <span style="color: #0000FF;">pace</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chanting </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ereed'There </span>is no God but God; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>is the ambassador of God;<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">God </span>be gracious to him and preserve <span style="color: #0000FF;">him </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">y </span>These are followed <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span>several male <span style="color: #0000FF;">relatives </span>of the deceased, and sometimes by a number<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">dervishes </span>with the flags of their order, and then by three or <span style="color: #0000FF;">more<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sehoolboys</span>, one of whom carries a copy of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karin</span>, or of parts of<br/>
it, on a stand made of <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-branches</span>, covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>cloth<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
boys usually chant in a loud and shrill voice several passages from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Irashrtyeh</span>', a poem describing the last judgment. The bier,<br/>
with the head of the deceased foremost, comes next, being borne<br/>
by three or four of his friends, who are relieved from time to time<br/>
by others. After the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bier </span>come the relations and friends in their<br/>
everyday attire, and the female relatives, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">dishevelled </span>hair,<br/>
sobbing aloud<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and frequently accompanied by professional mourning women, whose business it <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>extol the merits <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>deceased.<br/>
If the deceased was the husband or father of the family, one of the<br/>
cries is -'O thou <span style="color: #0000FF;">camel </span>of my house', the camel being the emblem<br/>
of the bread-winner of the household.<br/>
<br/>
The body is first carried into that mosque for whose patron<br/>
saints the relatives entertain the greatest veneration, and prayers<br/>
are there offered on its behalf. After the bier has been placed in<br/>
front of the tomb of the saint, and prayers and chants have again<br/>
been recited, the procession is formed anew and moves towards the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
