ceiling richly coloured and gilded. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the more important<br/>
ate houses we sometimes <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span>covered with <span style="color: #ff0000;">majoliea</span>.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller </span>will also be struck with the beautiful effects <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>colour<br/>
produced by the Inlaid Work in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lgiblas </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">eertain </span>mosques <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>tombs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kalm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'m</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tunn</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iiait </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bey </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, where marble, porphyry,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mother-of-pearl</span>, and Venetian enamel have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">combined</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>1n<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ease </span>of Cabinet Work the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colours </span>used for inlaying are dark<br/>
brown, black (ebony), white Livery <span style="color: #ff0000;">Â»</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, and bronze. Externally the<br/>
dark yellowish stone of which the buildings were <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructed<br/>
</span>produced a naturally pleasing effect, which the architects <span style="color: #ff0000;">oeeasioually </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to enhance by colouring every alternate<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">red </span>or black; while important parts were adorned with<br/>
marble mosaic, <span style="color: #ff0000;">majolieas</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">panelling</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">gilding</span>. Owing to the<br/>
mildness of the climate of Egypt much of the original colouring<br/>
has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">preserved</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>but it must not be confounded with the rude<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>staring painting of stone facades and marble ornaments <span style="color: #0000FF;">executed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">011 </span>the occasion of the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">secular </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">edifiees</span>, like the sacred, and particularly the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Dwelling </span>Houses, have also their characteristic peculiarities. The<br/>
ordinary town-houses are constructed of stone on the ground-floor,<br/>
and generally have an overhanging upper story. The projecting<br/>
parts sometimes rest on <span style="color: #0000FF;">pillars</span>, but more <span style="color: #0000FF;">commonly </span>on beautifully<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">carved </span>brackets of peculiar form, and are provided with a kind <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>bow-window, which serves the double purpose of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ventilating </span>the<br/>
house and of affording a view of the street to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">women </span>concealed<br/>
behind the lattice-work. The small perforated and generally octagonal balconies, with round holes at the bottom, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">used </span>for cooling<br/>
the drinking-water in porous vessels (<span style="color: #ff0000;">lcultehs</span>), whence they derive<br/>
their name <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">MushreMyehs </span>(from <span style="color: #0000FF;">sharab</span>, a draught). These <span style="color: #ff0000;">baleonies </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">rectangular </span>in shape, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sides </span>are sometimes arched,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lattice-work </span>round them, composed of turned pieces of<br/>
wood, often forms an ingenious and elaborate pattern. The roofs<br/>
of these mushrebiyehs usually project in a tent-like form, and<br/>
instead of <span style="color: #ff0000;">eorniees </span>they have pendent friezes cut out of boards.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">union </span>of these projections with the surface of the wall below<br/>
is generally masked by means of <span style="color: #0000FF;">richly </span>carved and elegantly waved<br/>
mouldings with tasteful rosettes<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mushrebiyehs</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>rarely extend to the height of the apartment within, there are<br/>
usually introduced upper windows, with stucco frames, filled with<br/>
stained glass. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Corniees </span>of the houses project but slightly,<br/>
curving a little outwards when <span style="color: #0000FF;">pendentives </span>are not employed;<br/>
and they are almost always crowned with pinnacles, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are often<br/>
most elaborately executed. We may also mention the <span style="color: #0000FF;">curious </span>form<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ofeornice </span>seen in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tombs</span>, where the projecting ends<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">roof-learns </span>are serrated.<br/>
<br/>
While bestowing their full <span style="color: #0000FF;">timed </span>of praise on the wonderfully<br/>
rich <span style="color: #0000FF;">ornamentation </span>and other details of Arabian architecture, one<br/>
