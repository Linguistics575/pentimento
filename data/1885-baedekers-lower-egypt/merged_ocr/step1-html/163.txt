</span>degenerate into a body of <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>empty forms, while he also rejected<br/>
their dogmatic teaching as utterly false. Above all he repudiated<br/>
whatever seemed to him to savour of polytheism, including the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">doctrine </span>of the Trinity, as'assigning partners' to the one and<br/>
only God. Every <span style="color: #0000FF;">human </span>being who possesses a capacity for belief<br/>
he considered bound to accept the new revelation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Isla</span>,<br/>
and every Muslim is bound to promulgate this faith. Practically,<br/>
however, this stringency was afterwards relaxed, as the Muslims<br/>
found themselves obliged to enter into <span style="color: #ff0000;">paeifio </span>treaties with nations<br/>
beyond the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tyonfiues </span>of Arabia<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A distinction was also drawn between peoples who were already in possession of a revelation, such<br/>
as Jews, Christians, and Sabians, and idolaters, the last of whom<br/>
were to be rigorously persecuted.<br/>
<br/>
The Muslim creed is embodied in the words:'There is no God<br/>
but God <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Allah <span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span>is the prophet of <span style="color: #0000FF;">God</span>' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">iMha<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">itt</span>' Allah, wa <span style="color: #ff0000;">aUuliammedu-rrastil-Alltli</span>). This formula, however,<br/>
contains the most important doctrine only; for the Muslim is bound<br/>
to believe in three cardinal points: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cr</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>God and the angels, <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span>)<br/>
written revelation and the prophets, and (3) the resurrection, judgment, eternal life, and predestination.<br/>
<br/>
(1). Gen AND <span style="color: #ff0000;">THEANGBLS</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">According </span>to comparatively modern<br/>
inscriptions (<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Syrie </span>Centrale', pp. 9, 10) it would appear that the<br/>
emphatic assertion of the unity <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>God is by no means peculiar to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedanism</span>. As <span style="color: #0000FF;">God </span>is a Spirit, <span style="color: #0000FF;">embracing </span>all perfection<br/>
within Himself, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ninety-nine </span>of his different attributes were afterwards gathered from the Koran, each of which is represented by a<br/>
bead of the Muslim rosary<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Great importance is also attached to<br/>
the fact that the creation of the world <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>effected by a simple effort<br/>
of the divine <span style="color: #0000FF;">will</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>God said'Let there be', and there was.)<br/>
<br/>
The story of the creation in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>is taken <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the Bible,<br/>
with variations from Rabbinical, Persian, and other sources. God<br/>
first created his throne; beneath the throne there was water; the<br/>
<br/>
began with ardent enthusiasm to promulgate <span style="color: #0000FF;">monotheism</span>, and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">want<br/>
</span>his hearers against <span style="color: #0000FF;">incurring </span>the pains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">helL </span>It is uncertain whether<br/>
Mohammed himself could read and write. His new doctrine was called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Islam</span>, or subjection to God<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At first he <span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span>converts in his own family<br/>
only, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wushhns</span>' were persecuted by the Meccans. Many <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span>,<br/>
and at length <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>himself (622), accordingly emigrated <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>Medina,<br/>
where the new religion made great <span style="color: #0000FF;">progress</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">After </span>the death <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khadija</span>,<br/>
Mohammed took several other wives, partly from political <span style="color: #0000FF;">motives</span>.<br/>
<br/>
He now <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to stir up the Meccans, and war broke out in<br/>
consequence. He <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>victorious <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bedr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>lost the battle of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Uhud</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>His military campaigns were <span style="color: #ff0000;">theneeforth </span>incessant. He <span style="color: #0000FF;">obtained </span>great<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>over the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>, and succeeded in uniting them politically.<br/>
In 630 the Muslims at length captured the town <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Mecca, and the idols<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>were destroyed. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mo1yrmmed</span>'s health<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>however, had been completely<br/>
undermined by his unremitting exertions for about <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-four </span>years;<br/>
he died on 8th June, 632, at Medina, and was interred there.<br/>
