<span>to Sinai. <span style="color: #0000FF;">WAD </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">GHARANDEL</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>10. Route. 487<br/>
<br/>
Even if we assume that the volume of water was more copious in the<br/>
time of the Exodus, owing to the more <span style="color: #0000FF;">luxuriant </span>vegetation, many<br/>
other <span style="color: #0000FF;">circumstances </span>would still combine to render it improbable that<br/>
two million <span style="color: #0000FF;">persons </span>could have <span style="color: #ff0000;">partaken </span>of it. The probability is that<br/>
these high figures are a mythical embellishment of the historical facts.<br/>
Schleiden has pointed out, that if the Israelites had numbered two<br/>
million as the Bible records, they would have <span style="color: #0000FF;">formed </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>dense<br/>
population for the whole peninsula. <span style="color: #0000FF;">For </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Such </span>a gigantic caravan <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">million </span>gallons <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">water </span>a day would hardly have <span style="color: #ff0000;">suffieed</span>, without allowing<br/>
for the cattle, and at the present <span style="color: #0000FF;">day </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>begin to feel anxious,<br/>
when a party of a few hundreds <span style="color: #0000FF;">encamps </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">around </span>their springs. The<br/>
number 600,000 has probably originated from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">poetical </span>accounts of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">miraculous </span>preservation of the people, who gratefully ascribed so great<br/>
miracles to <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>protecting God, in order the more effectually to extol<br/>
his power<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>These numbers should, doubtless, be very greatly reduced,<br/>
and so also should the forty years, which the Israelites are said to have<br/>
spent in the wilderness. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>was obviously the purpose of their leaders<br/>
to inure the people to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">privations </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the desert, in order to prepare<br/>
them for the battles they were about <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>fight in Palestine<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>but the sacred<br/>
number forty, which is so often repeated, and which was used to signify<br/>
a generation, most probably indicates <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>term of years<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>we may also<br/>
observe that Moses <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>forty years old when he fled, eighty when <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">led<br/>
</span>the people into the wilderness, and one hundred and twenty when he<br/>
died<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The fact <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>the Arabian literature contains a number of writings <span style="color: #ff0000;">called'Arbainiit</span>', or tales in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the number forty plays a<br/>
conspicuous part, <span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmation </span>of the above view<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Immediately before us rises the curiously shaped Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gharandel </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gerendel</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharandel</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gurundel</span>), the name of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">occurs </span>at an early period. Its slopes have been compared to'petrified<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cushions</span>'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It is possible that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Which </span>descends to the Gulf<br/>
of Suez gave its name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Charandra</span>, used during the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilomauperiod</span>,<br/>
to the N. part of the Arabian gulf, where Ptolemy II. founded the<br/>
town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsino√©</span>. In the Itinerary of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antonine </span>the place is <span style="color: #ff0000;">called<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gumndela</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">wadi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gharaildel </span>(reached in 2 hrs. from the spring in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Beware</span>), which runs for a long distance to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.E.</span>, affords,<br/>
near the sea, and particularly at <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">spot </span>crossed by the Sinai route,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">amoderate </span>supply of slightly brackish, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>drinkable, water, especially after heavy rain, in consequence of which the desert here is<br/>
clothed with pleasing, though not luxuriant, vegetation. Among<br/>
the plants are several lofty and bushy palms, <span style="color: #ff0000;">seyil </span>trees (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">486</span>),<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">gharkad </span>shrubs, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">tamarisks</span>. Small groups of <span style="color: #0000FF;">rocks </span>on the<br/>
margin of the oasis enhance the <span style="color: #ff0000;">comparative </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">pieturesqueness </span>of<br/>
the valley, which was perhaps once better watered and more richly<br/>
clothed with vegetation. Thus B. <span style="color: #0000FF;">yon </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Breidenbaeh </span>(15th cent<span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>travellers who identified Gharandel with Elim,<br/>
observed here a shrub bearing nuts, about the size <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hazel-nuts</span>,<br/>
and known <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>Pharaoh nuts, but which is now extinct. If this is<br/>
the Elim of the Bible, the 12 springs and 70 <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-trees </span>are<br/>
greatly reduced in number. The remains of two <span style="color: #0000FF;">hermit-eells</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn<br/>
</span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rocks</span>, are not worth visiting. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gharandel</span>, owing<br/>
to its supply of water, is a favourite <span style="color: #ff0000;">eamping-plaee </span>for the night.<br/>
<br/>
The route, farther on, at first ascends slowly. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>1 <span style="color: #0000FF;">u. </span>we reach<br/>
