<span>38 <span style="color: #0000FF;">GEOGRAPHICAL </span>NOTICE. Population.<br/>
<br/>
domestic utensils employed by the ancient Egyptians, as well <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
</span>many of their customs, are similar to those of the dwellers <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the banks <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Zambezi and Niger, but totally different from<br/>
those <span style="color: #ff0000;">seen </span>on the banks <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Indus </span>or Euphrates, will <span style="color: #0000FF;">always<br/>
</span>maintain an opposite view<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The considerations already mentioned,<br/>
however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tend </span>to show that the truth lies between these extremes.<br/>
Even those who most strongly maintain the Asiatic origin of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ltgyptians </span>will probably admit that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>immigrants found<br/>
an aboriginal <span style="color: #0000FF;">race </span>already settled on the banks of the Nile, which<br/>
in its persistent opposition to all foreign <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">doubtless<br/>
</span>similar to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">race </span>usually <span style="color: #0000FF;">known </span>as the Egyptian. We start with<br/>
the cardinal fact, that, although the country has been at various<br/>
periods overrun by <span style="color: #ff0000;">liyksos</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ethiopiaus</span>, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Romans</span>, Arabs, and Turks, and although the people were <span style="color: #ff0000;">tyrannised </span>over<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ill-tmated</span>, and in most <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases </span>compelled to <span style="color: #0000FF;">intermarry<br/>
</span>with these foreigners, the Egyptians have for thousands of years<br/>
retained the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">unvarying </span>physical types, while their character<br/>
has been but slightly <span style="color: #0000FF;">modified </span>by the introduction of Christianity<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedanism</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>If it now be borne in mind that these<br/>
foreigners generally invaded the country in the form of an army,<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>formed but a small body compared with the bulk of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>population, and that they either married native women or sought<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">wives </span>in other countries, it is obvious that they would <span style="color: #ff0000;">either </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">colltinne </span>to exist for a time as a foreign <span style="color: #0000FF;">caste</span>. a condition apparently<br/>
repugnant to nature and necessarily transient, or that they would<br/>
gradually succumb to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">never-failing </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iuf1uenees </span>of the soil and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>absorbed in the great mass of the aboriginal inhabitants<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>An<br/>
excellent illustration of this process is <span style="color: #0000FF;">afforded </span>by the Arabian <span style="color: #0000FF;">invasion</span>, with the circumstances and results of which we are better<br/>
acquainted than with the history of the other foreign <span style="color: #0000FF;">immigrations</span>;<br/>
for, disregarding the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lleduin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tribes</span>, who are entirely distinct from<br/>
the Egyptian population, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>find that the Arabian element<br/>
has entirely disappeared, and we meet with genuine Arabs in the<br/>
towns only, where the merchants<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>pilgrims, and other members of<br/>
that people form <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>class entirely distinct from the natives, and<br/>
where their existence is only maintained by means of reinforcements from abroad. Another proof of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">transforming </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iui5nenees<br/>
</span>of the Egyptian climate is <span style="color: #0000FF;">afforded </span>by the uniform character of the<br/>
domestic animals. The oxen, in particular (which, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, are<br/>
gradually being replaced by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">buffalo</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, though they have often<br/>
been repeatedly <span style="color: #0000FF;">exterminated </span>in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">single </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">century </span>by murrain, and<br/>
have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded </span>by foreign races from <span style="color: #0000FF;">every </span>quarter of the<br/>
globe, <span style="color: #0000FF;">invariably </span>after a few generations assume the well-known<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span>type with which the representations on the ancient temples<br/>
render us so familiar.<br/>
