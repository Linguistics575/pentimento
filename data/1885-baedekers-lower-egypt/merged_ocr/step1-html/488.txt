ilar <span style="color: #0000FF;">project</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">In </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1811 </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">1847 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Linant </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bey</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">vieeroy</span>'s engineer<br/>
of waterworks, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Messrs. </span>Stephenson, Negrelli, and Bourdaloue,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">demonstrated </span>the inaccuracy of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lep</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sre</span>'s observations, and proved<br/>
that the level of the two seas was nearly the same, so that the<br/>
construction of a canal between them was possible. In 1854 M.<br/>
de Lesseps, having matured his plan, laid it before <span style="color: #0000FF;">said </span>Pasha,<br/>
who was then Viceroy, and who determined to carry it out. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diffieulties </span>were thrown in the way of the enterprise by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>English<br/>
government during Lord <span style="color: #0000FF;">Palmerston</span>'s ministry, but on 5th Jan.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">1856 </span>permission to begin the work was formally granted by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Viceroy</span>. A considerable time, however, elapsed before the necessary capital was raised, and it was not till 25th April 1858, that<br/>
the work was actually begun. The Viceroy undertook to pay many<br/>
of the current expenses, and provided 25,000 workmen, who were<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>paid and fed by the company at an inexpensive rate, and<br/>
were to be relieved every three months. In order to provide these<br/>
workmen with water, 4000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-casks </span>suitable for being carried<br/>
by camels <span style="color: #0000FF;">hall </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>constructed, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1600 </span>of these animals were<br/>
daily employed in bringing them supplies, at a cost <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">8000 </span>fr. per<br/>
day. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>29th Dee. 1863 the fresh-water canal (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">409</span>) was <span style="color: #0000FF;">completed </span>t so that the company was <span style="color: #ff0000;">theneeforth </span>relieved of the<br/>
enormous expense of supplying the work-people with water. The<br/>
hands now employed, among whom <span style="color: #ff0000;">were </span>a number of Europeans,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">were </span>less <span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span>of the work was done by machinery,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">f </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">22,000 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">horse-power </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>all.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>18th March, 1800, the water of the Mediterranean was at<br/>
length allowed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">flow </span>into the nearly dry, <span style="color: #ff0000;">salt-euerusted </span>basins of<br/>
the Bitter Lakes, the N. parts of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">lay </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20-40 </span>ft. below the<br/>
level of the Mediterranean, while the S. parts required extensive<br/>
dredging operations.<br/>
<br/>
'The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>encounter of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">waters </span>of the two seas was by no means<br/>
of an amicable character; they met <span style="color: #0000FF;">boisterously</span>, and then recoiled from<br/>
the attack; but soon, as if commanded by a'quos ego' of Neptune<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>they<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">peacefully </span>mingled, and the ocean once more gained possession of the<br/>
land Which it had covered at a very remote period, but only <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">condition </span>of rendering service to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">traffle </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the world'. (Stephan)<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">cost </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructing </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">canal </span>amounted to about 19 million<br/>
pounds sterling, of <span style="color: #ff0000;">whieh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">li7iiti7fii</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">paid </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the shareholders,<br/>
while the rest of the sum <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>almost entirely contributed <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>[ In 1875, however, the British Government acquired the<br/>
Khedive's shares for a sum <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">/s,000,00M </span>] The capital was raised in<br/>
