<br/>
A peculiarity of many of the books recently printed at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ihi1iitc </span>is that<br/>
smaller works illustrative of the text are printed on the margins of the<br/>
pages. The paper used for the purpose is made in Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">manufactories</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">maize-straw</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>accounts for its <span style="color: #0000FF;">yellowish </span>tint.<br/>
<br/>
The great attraction at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Btlt1lr </span>is the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">MMuseum </span>of Egyptian Antiquities (the traveller bound for<br/>
which has only to direct his <span style="color: #ff0000;">donkey-boy'lil </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Antikat</span>'), a <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnifieent </span>collection, and entirely unrivalled of its kind. A great advantage possessed by it over all the European museums is that the<br/>
places where all its monuments and relies have been found are<br/>
known, and indicated by labels, a circumstance of the greatest importance in assisting historical and geographical research<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">collection </span>was founded by M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mariette-Pasha</span>, who died in 1881 and<br/>
has been succeeded as director by Prof. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jfaspero</span>, another Frenchman. The keeper of the museum is Herr <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eragseli-Eey</span>, who is assisted by M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bouréant</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The arrangement of the museum has recently been entirely<br/>
altered, and most of the treasures formerly stored in the magazines<br/>
have now found a place in the building itself. Several of the rooms<br/>
have been enlarged and an addition has been built to receive the<br/>
objects found at Dér el-Bahri, near Thebes, in 1881. Prof. Maspero<br/>
has also caused a room to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitted </span>up for monuments of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek</span>,<br/>
Roman, and Coptic periods.<br/>
<br/>
The Museum is <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>daily, except on Fridays, <span style="color: #0000FF;">horn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>to 12 and<br/>
from 2 to 5; in winter from 8 to 12 and 1 to 4 <span style="color: #0000FF;">o'clock </span>(no fee).<br/>
Strangers, who wish to make special studies, will receive every<br/>
facility from the director and keepers.<br/>
<br/>

This group, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is of rough workmanship, was found in 1882 at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Naga </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Meme</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>Herr <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berghoff</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, who some months later was captured and<br/>
beheaded by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahdi</span>.<br/>

marble, from the island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theme</span>. To the left of the entrance to<br/>
the garden is a large Sphinx (No. 6008) in <span style="color: #0000FF;">rose-coloured </span>granite,<br/>
