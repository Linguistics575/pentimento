<span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ielwam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>artificial oasis in the desert, 3 <span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span>from the Nile,<br/>
belongs to the Egyptian government, and is placed under the superintendence of <span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Grand-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-Bey</span>, who is represented at the place itself<br/>
by M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Onsy</span>. The medical inspector is Dr. Engel, a German. In<br/>
spite of the disadvantages of its situation, which necessitate the<br/>
bringing from a distance of drinking water, provisions, and even<br/>
garden mould, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heiwim </span>has hitherto had a very prosperous existence,<br/>
especially since it came into the hands of the government in 1880.<br/>
It still, however, presents a dull and new <span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance</span>, and the<br/>
vegetation around is still very <span style="color: #0000FF;">scanty </span>Visitors who have come to<br/>
Egypt for their health are strongly recommended not to remain in<br/>
Cairo, but either to go on at once to Upper Egypt or to pass the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">winter </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1Jelwin</span>, where, besides the baths, they enjoy the <span style="color: #0000FF;">advantages </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">perfect </span>quiet and a remarkably pure and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dustless </span>atmosphere<br/>
(comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">67</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The sulphur springs, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>also probably used in ancient<br/>
times, resemble those of Aix in Savoy in their ingredients. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1871<br/>
</span>they were utilised for <span style="color: #0000FF;">salutary </span>purposes by Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Reil</span>, by order<br/>
of Khedive Isma'il. The principal springs are covered in. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bath-house </span>for Europeans contains fourteen cabinets, for warm and<br/>
tepid baths, shower-baths, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">inhalation </span>There is also a basin<br/>
containing water strongly impregnated with sulphur, <span style="color: #0000FF;">5-61/2 </span>ft.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">deep</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1200 </span>sq. yds, in area. The interior of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khedive's<br/>
</span>bath-house may also be <span style="color: #0000FF;">inspected</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Near the sulphur springs, especially those situated farther to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">W.</span>, which are still uncovered, a quantity of <span style="color: #ff0000;">C1nt </span>splinters have<br/>
been found, the largest of which are now in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">museum </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">1mm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">h<br/>
</span>(comp. p. 370). The banks of the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford </span>good wild-fowl shooting, but the desert game is shy and not easily reached.<br/>
<br/>
The subterranean quarries <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ma'sara</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tum</span>, which are<br/>
still worked, yielded the stone used in the construction of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pyramids</span>. A visit should be paid to these vast caverns, if time permit.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">ride </span>thither from <span style="color: #ff0000;">I.lelwin </span>takes <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/2 </span>hr.; candles and matches<br/>
should not be forgotten. The stone is transported to the bank of<br/>
the Nile by means of tramways, carts, camels, and mules.<br/>
<br/>
These immense quarries are hardly less imposing than the Pyramids themselves, for <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>afforded material. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabs </span>make<br/>
very poor miners, as they dread the darkness of shafts and pits<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>They quarry the stone on the outside of the rocky slopes <span style="color: #0000FF;">only</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>while<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">quarrymen </span>of the Pharaohs penetrated into the interior of the<br/>
mountain and excavated large chambers, tunnelling their way<br/>
until they came to serviceable stone, and leaving the inferior<br/>
untouched. The roofs of the roek-halls, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>sizes,<br/>
are supported by pillars of rock left standing for the purpose. A<br/>
few remains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">basreliefs </span>are still preserved in the quarries, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>they are of <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">historical </span>value. <span style="color: #0000FF;">During<br/>
</span>the construction of the railway in 1875 a number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi<br/>
