<br/>
of every new <span style="color: #0000FF;">prelate</span>. After a lapse of 112 years <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>archbishop (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kant</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mam</span>) was installed in the monastery in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1872</span>, but his election was attended <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>great <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>If the quaint old writer <span style="color: #0000FF;">Schiltberger </span>of<br/>
Munich (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1391-1427</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">could </span>have <span style="color: #ff0000;">foreseen </span>these modern events, he would<br/>
hardly have recorded the following <span style="color: #0000FF;">miracle</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>-'A great <span style="color: #0000FF;">wonder </span>takes<br/>
place in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monastery</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">monks</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>have <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">many<br/>
</span>lamps, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">always </span>burning<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>And when <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>monk is <span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span>to die<br/>
his lamp begins to wane, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>it goes out, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">dies</span>. And when th,<br/>
Abbot dies, the monk, who sings his praise after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mass</span>, finds on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>altar a letter on which is written the name of the man who is to he<br/>
Abbot. And the lamp of the dead Abbot <span style="color: #0000FF;">thereupon </span>lights itself.' The<br/>
absent archbishop is represented <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">prior </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">wekil</span>, but the <span style="color: #0000FF;">estate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he<br/>
</span>the monastery are actually managed by an intendant<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Most </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">monksf<br/>
</span>who are quite uneducated, practise some handicraft; and they are most,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">successful </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>distilling of brandy, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>in gardening. Among them<br/>
are also a tailor and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">shoemaker </span>who charge exorbitantly for their<br/>
primitive <span style="color: #0000FF;">workmanship </span>The bread of coarse <span style="color: #0000FF;">flour </span>is also baked on the<br/>
premises. Many of the monks spend a few years only on Mt. Sinai, after<br/>
which they return home as'martyrs'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The monastery is also <span style="color: #0000FF;">considered<br/>
</span>as <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>kind of penal establishment. The healthy <span style="color: #ff0000;">mountain </span>air enjoyed by<br/>
the inmates of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monastery </span>of St. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Catharine </span>has always <span style="color: #0000FF;">contributed </span>greatly to their longevity, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>most of <span style="color: #0000FF;">them </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Suffer </span>from rheumatism.<br/>
<br/>
The Monastery of Sinai, an irregular pile of buildings, lies<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">5014ft</span>. above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-level</span>, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>granite slopes of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jebel<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mrisa </span>or Mount Sinai, in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span>Shu'aib or valley of Jethro.<br/>
Into the outer wall, facing the garden, are built two fragments of<br/>
marble bearing inscriptions, one in Greek, and one in Arabic (published by Lepsius). They both date <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the 12th or 13th century,<br/>
and are to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thelonger</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabic</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">runs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">follows </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'The </span>monastery of Mt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">CT.hlr</span>) Sinai, and the church of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mountain<br/>
</span>of the Conversation, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Justianus </span>(i. e. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Justinianus</span>), the<br/>
pious king of the Greek confession, dependent on the aid of God,<br/>
and waiting for the promise of his Lord, to remind himself and his<br/>
wife Theodora of the flight of time, in order that God might <span style="color: #0000FF;">inherit </span>the earth and everyone thereon, for he is the best of heirs.<br/>
And his building was ended after thirty years of his reign; and he<br/>
appointed over it a superintendent named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dhulas</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>And this<br/>
happened in the year <span style="color: #0000FF;">6021 </span>after Adam, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>corresponds with<br/>
the year 527 of the year of the Lord Christ'. It appears from the<br/>
style of the characters, that the inscriptions date from the 12th or<br/>
13th <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>, and it has already been mentioned, that the date of the<br/>
foundation of the monastery has been confounded with that of the<br/>
castle built by Justinian<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The same wall <span style="color: #0000FF;">contain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>another large<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stone</span>, Which, to judge from its ornamentation, probably bears a<br/>
third inscription on one of its sides<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The monastery was often<br/>
destroyed and rebuilt, and consequently exhibits great <span style="color: #ff0000;">ineongruity<br/>
</span>of form; we therefore <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cubes </span>and round arches, pointed and flat<br/>
roofs, and a church and mosque in close <span style="color: #0000FF;">contact </span>with each other.<br/>
The whole building presents the appearance of a fortress externally, but the bold and menacing defences consist of the walls of<br/>
houses, and massive walls of stones connecting the different <span style="color: #0000FF;">buildings</span>, which take the place of a regular rampart. The apartments<br/>
