A little before reaching <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iihedive </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewfiks </span>palace, the road turns<br/>
to the right and skirts the garden belonging to the palace. It then<br/>
enters an olive plantation and leads in a straight direction to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matariyeh</span>. This plain has been the scene of two important battles.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>1517 the Battle <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofHeliopolis </span>made Selim and the Turks masters<br/>
of Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>105); and on <span style="color: #0000FF;">20th </span>March, 1800, General <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kle'ber </span>with<br/>
10,000 French troops succeeded in defeating 60,000 Orientals,<br/>
and in consequence of this victory regained possession of Cairo,<br/>
although for a short time only.<br/>
<br/>
Near the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matariyeh </span>are the Tree and Well of the<br/>
Virgin and the Obelisk <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>. The Virgin's Tree <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">garden<br/>
</span>to the right of the road) is a sycamore with a decayed and riven<br/>
trunk, <span style="color: #0000FF;">covered </span>with names and inscriptions, but the branches are<br/>
still tolerably <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourishing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>According to the legend, the Virgin<br/>
and Child once rested under the shade of this tree during the<br/>
Flight to Egypt; and there is another tradition to the effect that<br/>
the persecuted Mary concealed herself with the Child in a hollow<br/>
of the trunk<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and that a spider so completely covered the opening<br/>
with its web as to screen her effectually from <span style="color: #0000FF;">observation </span>The<br/>
present tree, the predecessor of which died in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1605</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not<br/>
</span>planted till after <span style="color: #0000FF;">1672</span>. At the time of the inauguration of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Suez </span>Canal the tree was presented by the Khedive to the Empress<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Eugenie</span>. The garden is watered by means of a double <span style="color: #ff0000;">sakiyeh</span>,<br/>
which is supplied from a shallow reservoir fed by springs. This<br/>
water is good for drinking, while that of all the others, which<br/>
percolates through the ground from the Nile, is usually brackish.<br/>
This reservoir has been called the'Water of An' from a <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>early<br/>
period, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>in the Coptic legends connected with the<br/>
Virgin<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It is an interesting fact that the celebrated balsam <span style="color: #0000FF;">shrub</span>,<br/>
the balm of which is said to have been presented to Solomon by the<br/>
Queen of Sheba, once throve in this neighbourhood. The plant,<br/>
however, does not now occur nearer than <span style="color: #0000FF;">Yemen</span>, where its<br/>
juice is an article of commerce. It is said to <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>been replanted<br/>
here by Cleopatra, but apparently without <span style="color: #0000FF;">success </span>In <span style="color: #0000FF;">1820-30<br/>
</span>the first experiments with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eotton-plant </span>(p. 75), which now<br/>
plays so important a part in the commerce of Egypt, were made<br/>
in this neighbourhood. Quails abound here in the month of April<br/>

famous ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>, or city of the sun, of which the obelisk<br/>
and the outer walls are <span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">only </span>vestiges. The town was <span style="color: #0000FF;">tall-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>ed by the Egyptians the dwelling or seat of Ra (<span style="color: #ff0000;">IIe1i0s</span>), or of<br/>
Tum (the evening sun, p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1'25 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, or house of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phenix </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Denim </span>] or<br/>
l An. The latter, the popular name of the place, is frequently<br/>
mentioned in the Bible under the Hebrew form of On. Thus, in<br/>
Genesis, we are informed that Pharaoh gave Joseph the daughter<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Potiphera </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">ite</span>.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'dedicated </span>to Ita'), a priest of Heliopolis, named<br/>
