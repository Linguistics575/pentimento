<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fcllvihint </span>THE MODERN <span style="color: #0000FF;">EGYPTIANS</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>41<br/>
<br/>
The agricultural population <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEgypt </span>does not exceed two million<br/>
souls, an unnaturally low proportion when we <span style="color: #0000FF;">consider </span>the nature of<br/>
the country. The sole wealth <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEgypt </span>is derived from its agriculture,<br/>
and to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin </span>alone is committed the important task of tilling<br/>
the soil. They are, indeed, neither fitted nor <span style="color: #0000FF;">inclined </span>for other work,<br/>
a circumstance <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">proves </span>how completely the stationary character<br/>
of the ancient Egyptians has predominated over the restless <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabian </span>blood, which has been largely infused into the native population ever since the valley of the Nile was conquered by the armies<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ofEl-Islam</span>. The modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians</span>, moreover, resemble the ancient<br/>
in the lot to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they are <span style="color: #0000FF;">condemned</span>. In ancient times the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>pressed into the service of the priests and the princes,<br/>
was compelled to yield <span style="color: #0000FF;">up </span>to them the fruits of his toil, and his<br/>
position is nearly the same at the present day<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>save that the names<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>his masters <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">changed</span>, and he has obtained some relief <span style="color: #0000FF;">owing </span>to the almost entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">abolition </span>of compulsory work.<br/>
<br/>
ln early life the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">peasant </span>is remarkably docile, active<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>and intelligent, but at a later period this freshness and buoyancy is<br/>
crushed out of him by care and <span style="color: #ff0000;">poyerty </span>and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">never-teasing </span>task<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">filling </span>the pitcher of the Danaides. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ploughs </span>and reaps, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tails<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">amasses</span>, but he cannot with certainty regard his crops as his<br/>
own, and the hardly earned piastre is too frequently wrested from<br/>
him. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>character, <span style="color: #0000FF;">therefore</span>, becomes like that <span style="color: #0000FF;">oh </span>gifted child,<br/>
who has been harshly used and brought up to domestic slavery, but<br/>
at length perceives that he has been treated with injustice, and<br/>
whose amiability and intelligence are then superseded <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sullenness<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">obstinacy</span>. Thus<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>as in the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ammianns </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Marcellinns</span>, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fella </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>will often suffer the <span style="color: #ff0000;">most </span>cruel blows in dogged silence rather<br/>
than pay the taxes demanded of him.<br/>
<br/>
In his own fields the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah </span>is an industrious labourer, and his<br/>
work is more <span style="color: #0000FF;">continuous </span>than that of the peasant of more northern<br/>
countries. He enjoys no period of repose during the winter<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and the<br/>
whole of his spare time is <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupied </span>in drawing water for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">irrigation </span>of the land. Notwithstanding his hard lot, however, he is an<br/>
entire stranger to any endeavour to better his condition or to improve his system of farming. As soon as he has accomplished the<br/>
most <span style="color: #0000FF;">necessary </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tasks </span>he rests and smokes, and trusts that Allah will<br/>
do the remainder of his work for him.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">fella </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>is a <span style="color: #ff0000;">believerin </span>the religion of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed</span>, although<br/>
he knows but little of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prophet</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>doctrines and history. Followers of all other religions <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">believes </span>to be doomed to eternal perdition; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>travellers are not on that account disliked by him. We<br/>
serve rather to <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirm </span>his <span style="color: #0000FF;">belief </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>eternal justice, for he is convinced that all the comforts and luxuries we now enjoy will <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>counterbalanced <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">torments </span>hereafter. At the same time he admires<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">overrates </span>our <span style="color: #0000FF;">knowledge</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is so superior to <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">own</span>. Every<br/>
well-dressed European is in the estimation of the natives a prodigy<br/>
