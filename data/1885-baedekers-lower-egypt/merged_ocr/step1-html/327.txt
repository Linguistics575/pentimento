<br/>
The battle of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kerhela</span>, at which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hur</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n </span>fell, took place <span style="color: #0000FF;">011 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">10th<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Moharrem </span>of the year 61 of the Hegira (10th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chet</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">680</span>). Historians record<br/>
that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hus√©u </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">head</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>was sent to Damascus, while his body was interred in<br/>
the Meshhed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Husen </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ICE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Croutier </span>of Persia, to which Persian<br/>
pilgrims still <span style="color: #0000FF;">resort </span>in great numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Neither <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ijasmz </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">reseh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wits </span>remarkable <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>moral worth <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">political </span>greatness<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The veneration paid to these young'saints' seems to<br/>
have sprung solely from the persecutions to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the whole family of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mi </span>was subjected, coupled with the fact that they were the grandsons<br/>
of the prophet. Their misfortunes doubtless at first excited pity, a feeling which led to their being honoured with a kind of <span style="color: #ff0000;">deifieation</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">particulariy </span>in Persia, where divine honours had at a still earlier period been<br/>
paid to the sovereigns of the country as being descended from the gods. It<br/>
is still the <span style="color: #0000FF;">custom </span>in Persia, during the month <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3Iolparrem</span>, to represent<br/>
the events <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>led to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Husens </span>death in nine successive <span style="color: #0000FF;">theatrical<br/>
</span>performances, somewhat resembling the Passion plays of Europe<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Opposite the egress of the mosque is the entrance to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan<br/>
</span>Khalili (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">255</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E.end </span>of the Rue Neuve is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Windmill<br/>
</span>Hill mentioned at <span style="color: #ff0000;">pp.282 </span>and 287, adjoining which is the road to<br/>
the Tombs <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs </span>(pp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">282- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1287</span>)<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

<br/>
Owing to the expansion of Cairo towards the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W.</span>, in the direction<br/>
of the Nile, <span style="color: #ff0000;">13111511</span>; (or Boulaq), situated <span style="color: #0000FF;">beyond </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Isma'iliyeh<br/>
</span>Canal, and formerly an island, has become the river-harbour of the<br/>
city of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">khalifs</span>. Its narrow streets present a very busy scene,<br/>
affording a <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>characteristic picture of Oriental life than the<br/>
capital<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>as the inhabitants of distant provinces are proportionally<br/>
more numerous here. Natives of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dkr-Ftlr</span>, Wadai, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Donliola</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kordofain</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khart.thn</span>, and members of the various negro tribes are<br/>
seen mingling in picturesque confusion; and popular festivals and<br/>
amusements are very frequently provided for their entertainment<br/>
in the evening. Goods are conveyed hither from Upper Egypt,<br/>
from Nubia, from the interior of Africa, and from the fertile Delta;<br/>
and the Nile barges are then laden with other cargoes for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">returnjourney</span>. The principal quay is nearly opposite the palace of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gezireh</span>,<br/>
adjacent to a large timber-yard; and it is most frequented between<br/>
October and December, when the rapids of the river are most easily<br/>
navigated. The merchants of Cairo congregate here every morning<br/>
to make purchases, frequently as early as 7 <span style="color: #0000FF;">o'clock</span>. When there is<br/>
a scarcity of goods, they sometimes go out to the vessels in boats;<br/>
but when there is <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>scarcity, the goods are <span style="color: #0000FF;">sold </span>by auction in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ihllur</span>. Caravans bringing merchandise also arrive here not unfrequently, the most important being from Tunis <span style="color: #0000FF;">vit </span>Kufra and Siwa,<br/>
and from Wadai and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dir-FO</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>one part of the route from <span style="color: #ff0000;">DirFt1r</span>, itis said that the caravans obtain no fresh water for twelve days<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>dancers, men on camels thumping <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>huge drums, and lastly a promiscuous<br/>
crowd of holiday makers. The procession often marches <span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span>the town<br/>
for an hour <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>more, and thence out into the desert. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Towards </span>evening<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">n1ahn1a1 </span>is brought back to its usual place, and the festival then<br/>
terminates.<br/>
