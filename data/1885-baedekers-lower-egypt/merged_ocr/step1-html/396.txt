<br/>
one could <span style="color: #0000FF;">decipher </span>in his time, says <span style="color: #ff0000;">that </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-'they </span>are so numerous,<br/>
that, if one attempted to copy on paper those only which appear on<br/>
the surface of these two Pyramids (those of Cheops and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chephren</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
</span>they would fill more than 10,000 pages'. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">similar </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">account </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">given<br/>
</span>by <span style="color: #ff0000;">5rasidi</span>, Makrizi, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Haukal</span>, Edrisi, and other Arabs; and<br/>
yet on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">inerustation </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Chefren</span>'s Pyramid which is preserved at<br/>
the top there is now no trace of a single letter. We must therefore<br/>
conclude that the slabs which have been removed once bore <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>, which were perhaps purposely destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
Construction <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Pyramids. In consequence of the investigations of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Erbkam</span>, the mode in which the Pyramids were<br/>
erected and the meaning of the account given by Herodotus are now<br/>
well <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascertained</span>. The following questions have been asked by<br/>
Lepsius: - <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>How does it happen that the Pyramids are of such<br/>
different sizes? <span style="color: #0000FF;">C-</span>) After Cheops and Chephren had <span style="color: #0000FF;">erected </span>their<br/>
gigantic <span style="color: #0000FF;">mausolea</span>, how could their successors be <span style="color: #0000FF;">satisfied </span>with<br/>
monuments so much smaller. and of so different proportions?<br/>
(3) How is the fact to be accounted for, that an <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished </span>pyramid<br/>
is never met with? (<span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span>) How could <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gheops</span>, when he ascended the<br/>
throne and chose an area of 82,000 sq. yards for his monument,<br/>
know that his reign would be so unusually long as to enable him to<br/>
complete it? <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>) If one of the builders of the great pyramids had<br/>
died in the second or third year of his reign, how could their sons<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>successors, however willing to carry out the plan, have succeeded<br/>
in completing so gigantic a task, and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">erecting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">monuments </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves </span>at the same time? And how comes it that many other kings did<br/>
not, like <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheops</span>, boldly anticipate a reign of thirty years and begin<br/>
a work of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span>kind, the design for which might so easily have<br/>
been drawn, and might so readily have been carried out by <span style="color: #0000FF;">bis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">suhjtysts</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>-To all these questions the researches <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofLepsius </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Erbkam<br/>
</span>afford but one entirely satisfactory <span style="color: #ff0000;">answen'Eseh </span>king', says <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius<br/>
</span>in his letters from Egypt,'began to build his pyramid when he <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascended </span>the throne. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>began it on a small scale, in order that, <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>short<br/>
reign should be in store for him, his tomb might be a complete one.<br/>
As years rolled on, however, he continued enlarging it by the addi-.<br/>
tion <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">outer </span>coatings of stone, until he felt that his career was<br/>
drawing to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">close</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>died before the work was completed, the<br/>
last coating was then finished, and the size of the monument was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">accordingly </span>proportioned to the length of the builder's reign; so<br/>
that, had the progress <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>structures always been uniform, it<br/>
would have almost been possible to ascertain the length of each<br/>
king's reign from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">incrnstations </span>of his pyramid, in the same way<br/>
as the age of a tree is determined by the number of the concentric<br/>
rings in its trunk'. - The first step taken by the king's architect<br/>
was doubtless to level the surface of the rock on which the pyramid<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>to be erected, leaving, however, any elevation in the centre of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">area </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">untouched</span>, to form a nucleus <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the structure, and to save<br/>
