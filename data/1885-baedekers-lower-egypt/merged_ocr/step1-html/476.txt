<span>418 Route 6. SUEZ<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>A little farther <span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>N. is the mouth of the Fresh Water<br/>
Canal <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">409</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flow </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>into the conduits, as well as<br/>
its discharge into the sea, is regulated by means of a large lock.<br/>
The level of the canal is here <span style="color: #0000FF;">61/2 </span>ft. above that of the Red Sea.<br/>
The large buildings to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>of it are the English Naval Hospital<br/>
and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">engine-house </span>of the'Compagnie des <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eaux</span>.' To the E. of<br/>
the canal is the large <span style="color: #0000FF;">camping-ground </span>for the caravans coming<br/>
from Arabia, which sometimes number as many as a thousand<br/>
camels and present a most interesting sight. On the way from the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">kiosque </span>of the Khedive to the canal are a number of salt pools,<br/>
sometimes tinged red by innumerable microscopically small<br/>
crabs, which, in the morning especially, <span style="color: #0000FF;">diffuse </span>an odour <span style="color: #0000FF;">resembling </span>that of violets. The small neighbouring eminence is called<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>Hill. Opposite, to the E., beyond the railway, is the<br/>
Arabian sailors' quarter, consisting of dirty mud-hovels.<br/>
<br/>
A <span style="color: #0000FF;">massive'Pier</span>, about <span style="color: #ff0000;">13/4 </span>M. in length, resting on a substructure of <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>stone, 48 ft. in width, extends into the sea<br/>
to the S. of the town, <span style="color: #0000FF;">leading </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">*Harbour</span>. (Boat thither,<br/>
see p. 415.) The foundation of the pier and of the whole of the<br/>
quays rests upon a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sandhank </span>stretching out from the land in the<br/>
shape of a hook, and heightened by the addition <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>quantities<br/>
of earth dredged from the S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span>of the canal. The deposits of<br/>
earth thus made also enabled the <span style="color: #0000FF;">canal </span>company to embank an<br/>
area of about 50 acres, on which the arsenal, magazines, workshops, and buildings connected with the docks were erected.<br/>
The pier affords a pleasant and interesting promenade (donkey<br/>
1-2 fr., according to the time), commanding beautiful views <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>bay and the mountains enclosing it. At low tide the outline of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sandbank </span>is distinctly traceable<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAt'il.ca </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mts</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>to the W. of the town looked as <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>composed of<br/>
a liquid mixture of molten garnets and <span style="color: #0000FF;">amethysts</span>. They were <span style="color: #0000FF;">reflected<br/>
</span>in the water at their base, the ebb of which gradually <span style="color: #0000FF;">disclosed </span>more<br/>
and more of the ramparts and buildings around the harbour and the<br/>
entrance to the canal. The lofty pier, carrying the railway from the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">anchorage </span>of the large vessels to the town, <span style="color: #0000FF;">overtopped </span>all the other<br/>
buildings<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sandbanks</span>, and the deep pools left isolated by the<br/>
retiring tide. Men riding on donkeys and camels were passing along the<br/>
pier, and the lower the sun sank, the sharper did their outlines become<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">against </span>the glowing horizon, until at length they looked like <span style="color: #0000FF;">black<br/>
</span>shadows <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>a transparent golden yellow and violet wall of glass. At<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">length </span>the darkness closed in, and the roads were shrouded in <span style="color: #0000FF;">night</span>'.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the pier we <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>reach a small dock of the Canal<br/>
Company on the left, with a lighthouse (white light), beyond which<br/>

</span>the town by camels and donkeys; and they were afterwards <span style="color: #0000FF;">summer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>with<br/>

the desert into the town in <span style="color: #0000FF;">exhaustless </span>abundance! It seemed <span style="color: #0000FF;">like </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
