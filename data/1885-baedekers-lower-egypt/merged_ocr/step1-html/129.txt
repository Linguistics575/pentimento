HISTORY. <span style="color: #0000FF;">107<br/>
<br/>
</span>Ibrahim Pasha<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Moltammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAli</span>'s adopted son, had <span style="color: #0000FF;">already </span>taken the reins of government, in consequence of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed</span>'s incapacity, in January <span style="color: #ff0000;">1848</span>, but he <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lied </span>in<br/>
November of the same year, and before his adoptive <span style="color: #ff0000;">father</span>.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbks </span>Pasha, a son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'usrln </span>Pasha and grandson <span style="color: #ff0000;">of<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed'Ali</span>, has generally been described by Europeans<br/>
as a brutal, vicious, and rapacious prince. This, however,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">would </span>seem to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>a somewhat distorted view <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>his character,<br/>
arising from the fact that he had inherited from his Arab<br/>
mother a certain amount of ferocity and even cruelty, coupled<br/>
with the dislike of a true son of the desert for European innovations. He, however, maintained the strictest discipline<br/>
among his <span style="color: #ff0000;">offieials</span>, and the public security in Egypt was<br/>
never greater than during his reign. His death is attributed<br/>
to assassination.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sa'id </span>Pasha, <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>successor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAli</span>'s third<br/>
son. Thanks to <span style="color: #ff0000;">his </span>enlightened government and his taste<br/>
for European civilisation, Egypt made considerable progress<br/>
during his reign, although her <span style="color: #ff0000;">finanees </span>were far from being<br/>
in a satisfactory condition. He <span style="color: #ff0000;">equalised </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">incidence </span>of<br/>
taxation, abolished monopolies, improved the canals, completed the railways from Cairo to Alexandria and to Suez,<br/>
and, above <span style="color: #ff0000;">an</span>, zealously supported the scheme of M. Ferdinand de Lesseps for <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructing </span>a canal through the Isthmus <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Suez, which was opened in 1869 under his successor<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>During the Crimean <span style="color: #0000FF;">war </span>he was obliged to send an auxiliary<br/>
army and considerable sums of money to the aid of the<br/>
Porte. He died on 18th Jan. 1863, and was succeeded by<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">nephew </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">h-<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">il </span>Pasha, the second son of Ibrahim Pasha, who was<br/>
born on <span style="color: #ff0000;">31st </span>Dee. 1830. He had received the greater part<br/>
of his education in France and had there acquired the strong<br/>
preference for <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>institutions which characterised<br/>
him <span style="color: #0000FF;">throughout </span>his <span style="color: #0000FF;">reign </span>Unfortunately, however, he combined with this <span style="color: #0000FF;">enlightenment </span>a profound egotism and a<br/>
tendency to duplicity and cunning<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>which in the end, in<br/>
spite of his natural talents, proved his <span style="color: #ff0000;">ruin</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Most </span>of his<br/>
innovations, such as the foundation <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofmanufactories </span>and the<br/>
construction of canals, railways, bridges, and telegraphs,<br/>
were planned mainly in his own interest, though of <span style="color: #0000FF;">course<br/>
</span>the country shared in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">advantage</span>, while even in the establishment of schools, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">reorganisation </span>of the system of<br/>
justice (p. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">O</span>, and the like, he acted rather with an <span style="color: #ff0000;">eye<br/>
</span>to produce an impression in Europe than from real concern<br/>
for the needs of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">subjects</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>As time went on he succeeded<br/>
in appropriating for his <span style="color: #0000FF;">own </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">use </span>about <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-fifth </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cultivable </span>land of Egypt. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">1806</span>, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">consideration </span>of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">large<br/>
