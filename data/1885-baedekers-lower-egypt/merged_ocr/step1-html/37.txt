alarm, especially in country places, but they fortunately never bite.<br/>
As they are never domesticated in Oriental countries, it is quite<br/>
useless to attempt to establish friendly relations with them.<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">HOTELS</span>. The traveller will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>good, first-elass hotels at<br/>
Alexandria, Cairo, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismamiya</span>, Port Sa'id, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Suez</span>, kept by Germans,<br/>
Frenchmen, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creeks</span>, with European waiters. The charges are<br/>
generally high, 15-25 fr. per day being charged during the season<br/>
for board, lodging, and attendance, whether all the meals are<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">partaken </span>of or not. For a prolonged stay a <span style="color: #0000FF;">lower </span>rate should be<br/>
stipulated for in advance. Wine is generally extra. The waiter<br/>
expects a fee <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2-3 </span>fr. per week, his native assistant <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/211</span>, and the<br/>
porter about 2 fr<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>for errands in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">neighbourhood </span>there is generally<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>separate tariff. Orientals attract the attention of waiters by clapping<br/>
their hands, and sometimes with the exclamation <span style="color: #ff0000;">-'yt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">weted</span>' (ho,<br/>
boy <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>). - Tolerable inns have also <span style="color: #0000FF;">sprung </span>up of late years at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tauta</span>,<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">HOSPITALITY</span>. In all other parts of Egypt the traveller who is<br/>
not provided with tents must apply to the principal natives or<br/>
officials, or to European merchants for accommodation. The latter<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>to be met with in every part of the Delta, and will be found<br/>
most courteous and hospitable. Letters of introduction may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">obtained </span>without <span style="color: #ff0000;">diftieulty </span>at Alexandria and Cairo.<br/>

smallest and dirtiest villages. In the country they usually consist<br/>
of wooden booths, with a few seats made of plaited palm-twigs<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">germ</span>), and even in the large towns, like Cairo, they are very small<br/>
and uninviting. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">hahwas </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>frequented by the lower classes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">exclusively</span>. The front generally consists of woodwork with a few<br/>
