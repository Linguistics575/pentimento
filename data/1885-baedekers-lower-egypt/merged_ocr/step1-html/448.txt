<br/>
</span>group of doves, cranes, a mountain-goat, two more <span style="color: #0000FF;">antelopes</span>, and<br/>
to the left, in the corner, four more mountain-goats<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Adjoining<br/>
these figures <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the left is another <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of Ti (P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Adjoining the right <span style="color: #0000FF;">corner </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">s. </span>side of this court (see<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">above </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>is a corridor, formerly closed by a door, and also <span style="color: #0000FF;">divided </span>by<br/>
another doorway in the middle. It is now entered by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">wooden<br/>
</span>door, the key of which is brought by the guide.<br/>
<br/>
On each side of this Corridor CPI. E) are several series of<br/>
bearers of offerings (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">380 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, one above the other. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
right is a niche 91/4 ft. high and <span style="color: #ff0000;">6ft</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>wide, containing <span style="color: #0000FF;">a'stele'<br/>
</span>dedicated to the wife of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ti</span>, On the left, on the inner part of the<br/>
pillar of the doorway, is Ti with his titles; then (between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>and second <span style="color: #0000FF;">doors</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>the transport of the statue of Ti and persons<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>incense. Hieroglyphics in different places inform us that<br/>
'this is the statue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">thorn-acacia </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wood </span>of the deceased Ti', and<br/>
'this is the statue of ebony, which they are drawing';'the drawing<br/>
of the statue is a good drawing'. -'The servants pour out water'<br/>
is the inscription at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>where a servant is wetting the<br/>
runners of the sledge <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>bears the statue. - <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the right<br/>
(between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">niche </span>and the second door) are several more rows of<br/>
gift-bearers. On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">door-posts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Oeft</span>) two male figures and (right)<br/>
Ti with his titles. Over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">door </span>(N. side) musicians and dancers,<br/>
and (S. side) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ti </span>in a <span style="color: #ff0000;">boat </span>(damaged). We then come to a door<br/>
on the right, leading into an oblong, covered, and therefore<br/>
somewhat dark chamber (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1'1</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, the scenes adorning which afford<br/>
us an insight into the domestic <span style="color: #0000FF;">economy </span>of the deceased. Among<br/>
them are represented a complete pottery and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bake-house</span>, and<br/>
numerous vessels of various forms, destined for different uses.<br/>
On the upper part of the left door-post of this chamber a piece<br/>
of the sycamore wood to which the door was attached is still in <span style="color: #0000FF;">its<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">place</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">P </span>Above, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>each side of the door of this chamber Con the E.<br/>
side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corridor </span>], are several barges, some of which are light<br/>
boats with a number of rowers with broad, shovel-shaped oars,<br/>
while others of heavier build have lateen sails and are also steered<br/>
with ears. 1n the bow of the vessel stands a man with a long <span style="color: #0000FF;">pole</span>,<br/>
used for sounding, in the same way as is done at the present day.<br/>
These boats are conveying retainers of the deceased to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salilfrira </span>to<br/>
pay homage to his remains; for we read beside one of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sailingboats</span>: -'Arrival from the N. country, from the villages of the<br/>
family estate, in order that they may behold the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chamberlain </span>who<br/>
is perfect in <span style="color: #0000FF;">consequence </span>of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">distinction </span>in occupying the first<br/>
place in the heart of his sovereign, and the master of the mystery<br/>
of the kingdom of the dead, Ti'. The captain of the vessel, of<br/>
which we annex a woodcut, <span style="color: #0000FF;">wishing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>land <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the W. bank, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented </span>as giving the <span style="color: #ff0000;">command </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-'Oireetion</span>, starboard, <span style="color: #0000FF;">starboard</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
