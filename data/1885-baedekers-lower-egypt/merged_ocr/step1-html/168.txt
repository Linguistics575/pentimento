<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">146 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">DOCTRINES </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CD</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ELJSLKM</span>.<br/>
<br/>
their backs<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">scales </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>good and evil deeds are weighed<br/>
play an important part in <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">loci </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ing </span>the soul's fate, a detail which<br/>
gave rise to the subsequent doctrine of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eftieaey </span>of works. This<br/>
doctrine is carried so far that works of <span style="color: #0000FF;">supererogation </span>are believed<br/>
to be placed to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">credit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">believer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">demons </span>and animals,<br/>
too, must be judged. Hell, as well as heaven, has <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>regions;<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-lslam </span>also assumes the existence of a purgatory, from which<br/>
release is possible<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Paradise is <span style="color: #0000FF;">depicted </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed</span>, in <span style="color: #ff0000;">consonanee </span>with his thoroughly sensual character, as a place <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">entirely<br/>
</span>material delights.<br/>
<br/>
The course of all events, including the salvation or perdition<br/>
of every <span style="color: #0000FF;">individual</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>is, according to the strict interpretation of the<br/>
Koran, absolutely predestined; although several later sects have<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to modify this terrible doctrine. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is these views,<br/>
however, which give rise to the pride of the Muslims. By virtue of<br/>
their faith they regard themselves as certainly elect, and as a rule<br/>
they make no attempt to <span style="color: #0000FF;">convert </span>others, as they have no power to<br/>
alter the irrevocable <span style="color: #0000FF;">decrees </span>of God<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>In the second place the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>is considered to contain, not only a<br/>
standard <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ethics</span>, but also the foundation of a complete code <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">law</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MORALITY </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Isltun </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Was </span>specially adapted by its founder<br/>
to the character of the Arabs. Of duties to one's neighbour, charity<br/>
is the most highly praised, and instances of its practice are not<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">unfreqnent</span>. Hospitality is much practised by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>, and by<br/>
the peasantry also in those districts <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are not overrun with<br/>
travellers. Frugality is another virtue of the Arabs, though too apt<br/>
with them to degenerate into avarice and <span style="color: #ff0000;">enpidity</span>. The law <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofdebtor<br/>
</span>and creditor is lenient. Lending money at interest is forbidden by<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iforiu</span>, but is nevertheless largely practised, the lowest rate<br/>
in Syria being 12 per cent. The prohibition against eating unclean<br/>
animals, such as swine, is older than <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-lslim</span>, and, like the prohibition of intoxicating drinks, is based on sanitary considerations.<br/>
Wine, however, and even brandy, are largely consumed by the upper<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">classes</span>, especially among the Turks.<br/>
<br/>
Although <span style="color: #0000FF;">POLYGAMY </span>is sanctioned, every Muslim being permitted to have four wives at a time<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>yet among the bulk of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">population </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">monogamy </span>is far more frequent, owing to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">diftiiwlty </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>providing for several wives and families at once. The wives, moreover, <span style="color: #0000FF;">an</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>apt to quarrel, to the utter destruction of <span style="color: #0000FF;">domestic<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">peace</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>unless the husband can afford to assign them <span style="color: #0000FF;">separate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">houses</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Few </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span>remain unmarried. The treatment of women <span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mere </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ehattels</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">wlil </span>is of <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>remote <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oriental </span>origin, constitutes the greatest<br/>
defect of the system of <span style="color: #0000FF;">IDI-Irons</span>, although the position <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the female<br/>
sex among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oriental </span>Christians and Jews is little better than<br/>
among the Muslims. It is probably owing to this low estimate of<br/>
<br/>
