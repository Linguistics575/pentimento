<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>approaching Mecca the pilgrims undress, laying aside even<br/>
their headgear, and put on aprons and a piece of cloth <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>the<br/>
left shoulder. They then perform the <span style="color: #0000FF;">circuit </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kala</span>, kiss<br/>
the black stone, hear the sermon on Mt.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Arafat </span>near Mecca, pelt<br/>
Satan with stones in the valley of Mina, and conclude their pilgrimage with a great <span style="color: #ff0000;">saorifieial </span>feast. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the day when this takes<br/>
place <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mecca</span>, sheep are slaughtered and a festival called the Great<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Beiram </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">et-</span>" <span style="color: #ff0000;">ld </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-kel4rjohserved </span>throughout the whole of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohanrmedan </span>countries. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>The'Lesser <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beiram</span>', Arab. <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-nd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er-.stWtappir</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">follows </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramadan</span>.) The month of the pilgrimage is called <span style="color: #ff0000;">DhulbiggehCthat'of </span>the pilgrimage'), and forms the close of the Muslim<br/>
year. For an account of the feast in connection with the pilgrimage see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">236</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>order approximately to convert a year of our<br/>
era into one of the Muslim era, subtract <span style="color: #0000FF;">622</span>, divide the remainder<br/>
by 33, and add the quotient to the dividend. Conversely, a year<br/>
of the Mohammedan era is converted into one of the Christian era<br/>
by dividing it by 33, subtracting the quotient <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>it, and adding<br/>
622 to the remainder. On <span style="color: #ff0000;">21st </span>October, 1884, began the Muslim<br/>
year 1302. The Gregorian calendar has recently been introduced<br/>
into Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>is used by government in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">finanee </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">department<br/>

Most of the Arabic LITERATURE is connected with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koran</span>.<br/>
Commentaries were written at an early period to explain the obscure passages in it, and there gradually sprang up a series of exegetical writings dwelling with elaborate <span style="color: #ff0000;">minnteness </span>upon every<br/>
possible shade of interpretation. Grammar, too, was at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>studied<br/>
solely in connection with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">1501511</span>, and a prodigious <span style="color: #0000FF;">mass </span>of<br/>
legal literature <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>founded exclusively upon the sacred volume.<br/>
Of late years, however, some attempts have been made to supersede the ancient law, and to introduce a modern European system.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>still have their peculiar customary law.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to theological, legal, and still more to ritualistic<br/>
questions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam </span>has not always been free from <span style="color: #ff0000;">ilissem3ion</span>. There<br/>
are in the first place four Orthodox <span style="color: #ff0000;">seats</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">f.rtrneftes</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shafe'ites</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Matching</span>, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">f.lambalites</span>, who are named after their<br/>
respective founders. In addition to these must be mentioned the<br/>
schools of Free Thinkers, who sprang up at an early period, partly<br/>
owing to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of Greek philosophy. The orthodox party,<br/>
however, triumphed, not only over these heretics, but also in its<br/>
struggle against the voluptuousness and luxury of the most glorious<br/>
period of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">khalifs</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Aseetism </span>and fanaticism were also largely developed among<br/>
professors of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Mia</span>, and another phase of religious thought was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pure </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MYSTICISM</span>, which arose <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehieflyin </span>Persia. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">mystics </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">till</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span>) interpret many texts of the Koran <span style="color: #0000FF;">allegorically</span>, and their system there<br/>
