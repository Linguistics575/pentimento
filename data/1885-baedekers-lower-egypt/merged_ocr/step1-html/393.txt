<span>of Cairo. THE PYRAMIDS <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">GiZEH</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">g.floute</span>. 347<br/>
<br/>
sandy plain in a finished <span style="color: #0000FF;">condition </span>The Egyptians attempt partly<br/>
to explain this by the miraculous story that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">embankment</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>consisted of salt and saltpetre, and that they were melted by an<br/>
inundation; that they thus disappeared, while the solid building<br/>
remained. But this was not really the case; it was more probably<br/>
the same number of human hands employed in throwing up the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">embankments </span>which removed them and cleared the ground. It is<br/>
said that <span style="color: #ff0000;">360,000 </span>men were <span style="color: #0000FF;">compulsorily </span>employed in the work,<br/>
and that the whole <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>scarcely <span style="color: #0000FF;">completed </span>within <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>period of<br/>
twenty <span style="color: #ff0000;">yearsh'<br/>
<br/>
</span>'On the death of this king, his brother <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chephren </span>succeeded to<br/>
the throne. He reigned <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty-six </span>years. According to others the<br/>
successor was not <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>brother <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>last king, but a son of his, named<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Chabryis</span>. In this, however, all the accounts agree, that, imitating<br/>
his predecessor, he erected the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>pyramid, which is indeed as<br/>
artistically built as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first</span>, but is not nearly so large, each side<br/>
of the area being a stadium only (193 <span style="color: #ff0000;">yds.</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>The kings had<br/>
built these pyramids as <span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs</span>, and yet neither of them is buried<br/>
in them. For they were so hated on account of the excessively<br/>
laborious work imposed <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>them and their many <span style="color: #0000FF;">cruelties </span>and<br/>
oppressions, that the people threatened to drag their bodies from<br/>
their tombs with derision and to tear them to pieces<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Both, therefore, commanded their relatives, before their deaths, to bury them<br/>
quietly in some unknown place.'<br/>
<br/>
'These kings were succeeded by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Myeerinns </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">whom </span>some call<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1leneuerinus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>a son of the builder of the first pyramid. He resolved<br/>
to erect <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">third </span>pyramid, but died before the work <span style="color: #0000FF;">Was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">finished</span>.<br/>
Each side of the area he made 300 feet long. He caused the sides<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>constructed, <span style="color: #0000FF;">up </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifteenth </span>tier, of black stone, <span style="color: #0000FF;">resembling </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thebau</span>. For the <span style="color: #0000FF;">completion </span>of the remaining part he<br/>
employed the kind of stone which had been used for the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">pyramids </span>Although this work is inferior to the others in point <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>size, it is superior in its much more <span style="color: #0000FF;">artistic </span>construction and its<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">valuable </span>stone. The name <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofMyeerinns</span>, the builder of the pyramid,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>inscribed on its N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">side</span>.'<br/>
<br/>
'This king is said to have abhorred the cruelty <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>predecessors, and to have <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to be courteous to every one and<br/>
to become the benefactor of his subjects. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>said to have sought<br/>
in every possible way to gain the affection of his subjects, and<br/>
among other things to have presented large sums at the public<br/>
courts of law to honest people who were thought to have lost their<br/>
causes <span style="color: #0000FF;">undeservedly</span>. There are three <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>pyramids, the sides of<br/>
which are 200 feet <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>In their whole construction they resemble<br/>
the others, but not in <span style="color: #0000FF;">size</span>. The three kings already named <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
<br/>
