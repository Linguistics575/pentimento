<span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Port </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>SUEZ CANAL. <span style="color: #0000FF;">7</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Route. 429<br/>

the rebel Mohammed <span style="color: #0000FF;">ihn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Talih </span>at Medina, but the truth of<br/>
this statement is questionable. It is at all events certain that the<br/>
canal became <span style="color: #0000FF;">unserviceable </span>after the <span style="color: #ff0000;">8th </span>century. At a later<br/>
period the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Venetians </span>frequently thought of constructing a canal<br/>
through the Isthmus <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a view to recover the trade which they<br/>
had lost owing to the discovery of the route round the Cape of<br/>
Good <span style="color: #ff0000;">How</span>, and several travellers advocated the scheme; but no<br/>
one seriously attempted to carry it out. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Leihnitz</span>, too, in his<br/>
proposal regarding an expedition to Egypt, made in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1671 </span>to<br/>
Louis <span style="color: #ff0000;">XIV.</span>, the greatest monarch of his age, strongly recommends<br/>
the construction of such a canal.<br/>
<br/>
'The lord of Egypt, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">says</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'is </span>not only in a position to do great<br/>
injury to the welfare of the world, as the Turks <span style="color: #0000FF;">undoubtedly </span>have done<br/>
by the stoppage of trade; but he might<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>on the other hand, confer <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>great benefit on the human race by uniting the Red Sea with the Nile<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>with the Mediterranean by means of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>canal, in the same way as<br/>
France has merited the gratitude of Europe by the construction of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">canal </span>along the <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot </span>of the Pyrenees. The statement that the level of the<br/>
Red Sea is higher <span style="color: #ff0000;">than </span>that <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the Mediterranean (as Darius was assured)<br/>
is a mere myth; and even if such were the case, the opening of such a<br/>
canal would not <span style="color: #0000FF;">expose </span>Egypt to the danger of <span style="color: #0000FF;">inundation</span>'<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Sultan Mustafa <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, the admirer of Frederick the Great,'Ali<br/>
Bey, the enterprising <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span>prince, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Buonaparte </span>all<br/>
revived the scheme, and the latter on his expedition to Egypt in<br/>
1798 <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>105) even caused the preliminary works to be undertaken, but the actual execution of the project seemed almost as<br/>
distant as ever. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lepére</span>, his chief road engineer, and a man of<br/>
great ability, surveyed the ground under the most <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable<br/>
</span>circumstances, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>not without personal danger, but owing to a<br/>
serious <span style="color: #ff0000;">misealculation </span>he threw great doubt on the feasibility of<br/>
the undertaking. While in reality the level of the two seas is nearly<br/>
the same, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lep</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ere </span>estimated that of the Red Sea to be nearly 33 ft.<br/>
higher than that of the Mediterranean. Laplace among others protested against the accuracy of this calculation, as being in <span style="color: #ff0000;">iletianee<br/>
</span>of all the laws <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hydrostatics</span>, but the supposed <span style="color: #0000FF;">obstacle </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>formidable to prevent any farther steps from being taken,<br/>
although the scheme still had <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>supporters, until M. de Lesseps<br/>
directed his attention to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>matter. It was reserved for this shrewd<br/>
and energetic Frenchman to carry out the task which had seemed<br/>
impracticable to a series of wealthy and powerful princes. In 1831<br/>
he was sent from Tunis to Egypt as a young consular <span style="color: #0000FF;">Weve</span>. At<br/>
Alexandria, where he had to perform quarantine for a considerable<br/>
time, he was supplied with books by M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mimaut</span>, the French <span style="color: #0000FF;">consull </span>Among them was <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lep</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rre</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mémoire </span>regarding the scheme of<br/>
connecting the two seas, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>led him to consider its great importance, although <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lep</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sre </span>himself doubted its feasibility. In 1838<br/>
he made the acquaintance of Lieut. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Waghom</span>, an Englishman<br/>
(p. 419 ], whose zealous advocacy of the construction of a route<br/>
between Europe and India <span style="color: #0000FF;">via </span>Egypt stimulated his zeal for a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sim<br/>
