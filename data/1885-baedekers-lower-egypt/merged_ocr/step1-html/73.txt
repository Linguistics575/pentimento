richer lowlands, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>to the large towns, and particularly to Alexandria, in quest of employment; and they find no <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieulty </span>in<br/>
attaining their object, for they are generally active, intelligent, and<br/>
honest, while the older immigrants, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>are strongly attached to their<br/>
country, are always zealous in procuring them work and rendering<br/>
them assistance. When the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berber </span>has succeeded in amassing a<br/>
moderate fortune, he returns to settle in his native country, of<br/>
which throughout his whole career he never entirely loses sight,<br/>
and to which he frequently remits his hardly earned savings for the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">benefit </span>of his relations. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">cold </span>winter nights in Egypt are very<br/>
trying to the poor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Barbers</span>, who often have to sleep in the open air<br/>
outside the doors, and many of them are attacked by consumption.<br/>
They are most commonly employed as <span style="color: #0000FF;">doorkeepers </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">bawwtib</span>), as<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">house-servants </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">khaddtm</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, as grooms and runners (<span style="color: #ff0000;">stis</span>), for which<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">swiftness </span>renders them unrivalled, as <span style="color: #ff0000;">coaehmen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">farbayi</span>),<br/>
and as <span style="color: #0000FF;">cooks </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">tabbeilch</span>). Each of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>classes is admirably organised as a kind of guild, with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh </span>of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">own</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>levies a<br/>
tax from each member, and guarantees the character and abilities of<br/>
members when hired. Thefts are very rarely committed by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubians</span>, but in cases of the kind the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh </span>compels the whole of<br/>
his subjects to contribute to repair the loss, and cases have been<br/>
known in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>several hundred pounds have been recovered in<br/>
this way. The result is that there is a strict mutual system of<br/>
supervision, and suspected characters are unceremoniously excluded<br/>
from the fraternity. Nubian women are seldom seen in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>.<br/>
[ <span style="color: #0000FF;">like </span>the Berbers, most of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>professors of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islim</span>, to the easily intelligible doctrines of<br/>
which they readily and zealously attach <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves</span>. Most of the<br/>
older <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes </span>and negresses with whom the traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">meets </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span>originally been brought to Egypt as slaves, and belong to natives,<br/>
by whom they are treated more like members of the family than<br/>
like servants. Although every slave who desires to be emancipated<br/>
may now with the aid of government sever the ties <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>bind him<br/>
to his master, most of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes </span>prefer to remain <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the old footing with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">family </span>which supports them and relieves them of the<br/>
anxiety of providing for themselves<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The eunuchs, who also belong<br/>
almost exclusively to the negro <span style="color: #0000FF;">races</span>, but are rapidly becoming<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rarer</span>, very seldom avail themselves of this opportunity of regaining<br/>
their liberty, as their emancipation would necessarily terminate the<br/>
life of ease and luxury in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they delight. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">slave-trade </span>is<br/>
now very rapidly approaching complete extinction in Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>so<br/>
much owing to the penalties imposed (which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">rapacious </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">offieials<br/>
</span>take every opportunity of enforcing<span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>as from changes in the mode<br/>
of living, and the growing <span style="color: #0000FF;">preference </span>of the wealthy for paid servants<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Down to 1870 the trade was still carried on in secret with<br/>
some success, but since then it has been at a standstill<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Since<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">1878 </span>the government has kept a complete register of <span style="color: #0000FF;">domestic<br/>
