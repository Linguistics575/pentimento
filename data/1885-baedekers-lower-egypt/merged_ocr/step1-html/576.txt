<span>500 Route 10. MONASTERY OF SINAI. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>occupied by the monks, pilgrims, and travellers, are situated on<br/>
the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>of the houses, which are only one room in depth, their<br/>
doors being connected by a long, wooden gallery. The whitewashed walls bear numerous Greek inscriptions, some of which<br/>
were written by a monk of Athos, named Cyril, who was formerly<br/>
librarian here. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">ditterent </span>buildings are separated by small<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">courts</span>; one ot these contains a well, and a small group of apricot<br/>
trees enclosed by stakes. The low buildings are commanded <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>a<br/>
lofty cypress. From the <span style="color: #0000FF;">embrasures </span>in the walls and ramparts a<br/>
few small cannons still frown on the now <span style="color: #ff0000;">peaceful'Saraceris</span>'. 1n<br/>
the midst of the buildings is situated the church (see below), with<br/>
its handsome tower, adjoining which is the ill-preserved mosque.<br/>
The wells yield <span style="color: #0000FF;">excellent </span>water, particularly one in a shed at the<br/>
back of the church, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the monks point out as the one at which<br/>
Moses watered the flocks of Jethro's daughters.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Church </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Trattsfyuraiion </span>is an early Christian basilica.<br/>
The exterior is uninteresting<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the centre of the W. side, which<br/>
forms a kind of facade, a large cross, with a window in the centre,<br/>
takes the place of the usual rose-window; and on each side of it<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>palm-tree engraved on the stone. - The <span style="color: #0000FF;">church </span>is entered <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span>a porch, and a flight of steps descending beyond it, both of which<br/>
have been restored<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the middle of each of the topmost steps<br/>
is aletter of the name of St. James <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">y-A-K-Q-B-O-S</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- We first<br/>
enter a vestibule (narthex) with a Byzantine window, containing<br/>
a large, modern basin for holy water with small silver eagles.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>framework of the door leading into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nave </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>richly decorated<br/>
and the panels are embellished with old pictures in enamel, of<br/>
small size<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The basilica, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>we next enter, notwithstanding<br/>
the lowness <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>aisles, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">superabundant </span>decoration <span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiar<br/>
</span>to Greek churches, is not devoid of <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>. Each of the lofty walls<br/>
hearing the <span style="color: #ff0000;">entablatnre </span>of the nave rests on thick columns of<br/>
granite, covered with stucco and painted green, the capitals of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are adorned with boldly executed foliage. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">ceiling </span>has<br/>
been recently re-painted, and divided into bright coloured sections containing indifferent medallion <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of John the Baptist,<br/>
the Virgin and Child, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Saviour.<br/>
<br/>
The Aisles are lighted by five Byzantine windows on each side,<br/>
and are covered by a sloping roof. A coloured Marble Pavement in<br/>
the nave now <span style="color: #0000FF;">replaces </span>one of admirable mosaic <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">destroyed </span>by Arabian <span style="color: #0000FF;">treasure-seekers</span>. Adjoining the third <span style="color: #0000FF;">column<br/>
</span>on the left side of the nave is a marble Pulpit adorned with pleasing miniatures, which was presented to the church in 1787. Near<br/>
the fourth column on the right is the Episcopal Throne, dating from<br/>
the last <span style="color: #0000FF;">century</span>, and interesting on account of a representation of<br/>
the monastery at that period, painted by an Armenian artist, and<br/>
held by <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of Moses and St. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Catherine </span>The inscription repeats the date <span style="color: #0000FF;">527 </span>which is erroneously stated by the monks as<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
