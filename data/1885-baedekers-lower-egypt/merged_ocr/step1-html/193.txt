<span>HISTORY OF ART. 171<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">af</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>alabaster near the great Sphinx appears to have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>temple of<br/>
this kind in connection with the pyramid of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chefren</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Under the<br/>
new empire also the kings constructed their <span style="color: #0000FF;">actual </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">burial-places </span>at<br/>
a distance from the monuments dedicated to their memory. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
</span>deep rock vaults in the ravines of the royal tombs were the <span style="color: #ff0000;">restingplaees </span>of their remains, while the <span style="color: #ff0000;">great'Memnouia</span>' (which are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">plated </span>exclusively on the W. bank of the Nile at Thebes) were the<br/>
temples where rites were <span style="color: #0000FF;">celebrated </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>their memory<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">mostinteresting </span>feature of the mortuary temples is their pictorial decoration.<br/>
The subjects of those in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">memnouia </span>are of course the power and<br/>
prosperity, the victories and achievements, of the monarchs, while<br/>
the private chapels contained scenes from the domestic life of the<br/>
deceased. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">memnonia </span>sometimes covered a very extensive area,<br/>
like that of Ramses Il., <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>contained a library and a school.<br/>
Most of them have pylons and large <span style="color: #ff0000;">eolonnaded </span>halls, but it cannot<br/>
now be <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascertained </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">whether </span>they were uniform in their arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
By far the greater <span style="color: #0000FF;">number </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span>sculptures are in immediate connection with architectural works. Colossal statues<br/>
mount guard ever pylons and <span style="color: #0000FF;">pillars</span>, and every available surface<br/>
is adorned with reliefs. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>these <span style="color: #0000FF;">plastic </span>works are to be fairly<br/>
judged, they must be regarded as component parts of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">building<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>adorned. Speaking of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statues, Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius </span>justly<br/>
remarks: <span style="color: #ff0000;">-'The </span>features of these statues, which even received<br/>
divine honours, and were <span style="color: #0000FF;">enthroned </span>in, or in front of, temples in<br/>
a commanding position, either as structural supports, or detached<br/>
from the pillars behind them, wear the same character of <span style="color: #0000FF;">monumental </span>repose as the statues of the gods themselves, and yet<br/>
without the possibility of their human individuality being<br/>
confounded with the universally typical features of the divine<br/>
images'. - This is <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lu'eily </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ease </span>with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tyylossal </span>sitting<br/>
statues, whose position (with their legs bent at a right angle,<br/>
their arms firmly pressed against their sides, and their heads<br/>
looking in a perfectly straight direction) may well be called stiff,<br/>
but not properly conventional. Many peculiarities of Egyptian<br/>
art, especially <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the earlier period, are apt to be attributed to<br/>
the imperative requirements of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacerdotal </span>authority<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>they<br/>
are perhaps rather to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">accounted </span>for by the imperfection of<br/>
artistic development. The sculptors exhibit great skill in detail,<br/>
but they seem incapable of <span style="color: #0000FF;">making </span>their skill <span style="color: #ff0000;">subserye </span>the general<br/>
effect of their works. They have obviously striven to represent each<br/>
member of the body with the utmost fidelity, but they <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>incapable of combining them harmoniously. Thus, we generally<br/>
see reliefs with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">faces </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">profile</span>, the chest nearly facing us,<br/>
and the legs again in profile, a peculiarity <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">recurs </span>in the<br/>
works of other Oriental nations, and even in those of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheeks </span>of<br/>
the early period. This defect was at length overcome by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gree<br/>
</span>but of the Egyptian artists it continued permanently characteristic<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
