not merely with the different modes of building and their details,<br/>
but with the peculiarities of the national religious rites. The costly<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">stone </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">edifiees </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the ancient Egyptians were used <span style="color: #0000FF;">exclusively </span>for<br/>
religious purposes. It is an error to suppose that the temples contained the royal residences within their precincts; the nature of the<br/>
climate alone would have rendered them <span style="color: #0000FF;">uninhabitable</span>. The kings'<br/>
palaces, as we learn from the representations <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofthem </span>in tombs, were<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eilifiees </span>of a very light and airy description, adorned with balconies,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>, and bowers, and surrounded by gardens and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ponds</span>.<br/>
They were built of brick and wood, and, as the sole object of the<br/>
architects was to provide a convenient and pleasant dwelling, they<br/>
were richly decorated with <span style="color: #0000FF;">colouring</span>.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to the architecture of the temples, it is important<br/>
to keep in view the <span style="color: #0000FF;">factY </span>that they were neither destined for the<br/>
reception of a congregation like Christian churches, nor, like the<br/>
Greek temples, erected as mere receptacles for the image of the god.<br/>
The Egyptian worshippers approached the temple precincts in<br/>
solemn <span style="color: #0000FF;">procession</span>, and the profane remained outside, while the initiated and the ordained penetrated to different parts of the interior<br/>
in accordance with the degree <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>their knowledge of the divine<br/>
mysteries, the high priest alone being privileged to enter the<br/>
innermost sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
The multitude would first arrive in their festively decorated<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">boats </span>by the great highway of the Nile, and they would then traverse<br/>
the avenue leading to the temple, which was <span style="color: #ff0000;">flankei1 </span>by sphinxes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>each side. The sphinxes consist of a lion's body with <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>head of a man <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">AndrosphirvO</span>, or that of a ram (<span style="color: #ff0000;">kriosphinsj</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">according </span>to an inscription at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edfu </span>they were intended to symbolise the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tytynfliet </span>of Horus with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Typhon-Seth</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">sphinx </span>avenue<br/>
led to the precincts of the temple proper, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Temenos </span>of the<br/>
Greeks, which were completely enclosed by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">wall</span>, built of bricks<br/>
of the Nile clay<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>or, as at Edfu, of solid stone. The sacred lakes,<br/>
generally two in number, and the sacred grove were usually the only<br/>
accessories of the temple which lay without the precincts<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At the<br/>
end of the avenue the eye is confronted by two huge towers with the<br/>
entrance between them, called the Pylons, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are in the form of<br/>
truncated pyramids, with walls divided into sections by round<br/>
staves, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ml'ording </span>admirable surfaces for plastic or pictorial <span style="color: #0000FF;">decoration</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>pylons and the portal between them are both <span style="color: #0000FF;">crowned<br/>
</span>with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">usual </span>hollowed <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornice</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Under </span>ordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">circumstances<br/>
</span>these pylons present a very imposing appearance, but their<br/>
grandeur must have been much enhanced <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>they <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">festively<br/>
</span>decorated <span style="color: #0000FF;">Las </span>in Fig. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>on solemn occasions<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and when gaily hung<br/>
with flags to welcome the arrival of the worshippers. Within the<br/>
pylons, in the larger temples, lay a large open <span style="color: #0000FF;">court </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Peristyle</span>),<br/>
flanked on two or three sides with <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades</span>, and beyond it a<br/>
large hall borne by columns (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hypostyle</span>), of which those in the<br/>
