<span>BUILDINGS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE MOHAMMEDANS. <span style="color: #ff0000;">179<br/>
<br/>
</span>junction of the walls and ceiling is generally masked by a pendent<br/>
cornice, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornice </span>with a frieze <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The beams<br/>
used in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">coustructionofthe </span>ceilings are generally square at both<br/>
ends to a length <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3-5 </span>ft., beyond <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they are rounded below,<br/>
and frequently carved. The interstices between the beams are<br/>
sometimes divided into'coffers'; and proper <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoffered </span>ceilings also<br/>
occur, as in the mosque <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sal√©heddin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lisuf </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">citadel </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p.264</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>.<br/>
In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corners </span>of the apartments, as well as under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">principal<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">architravos</span>, pendants are generally placed to conceal the angles.<br/>
The earliest ceilings appear to have consisted of <span style="color: #ff0000;">palm-trunes</span>, and<br/>
then covered with <span style="color: #ff0000;">boardsofsycamore </span>wood, which were often richly<br/>
carved. The space immediately in front of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tibla </span>(prayer niche)<br/>
usually terminated in a dome borne by columns. Spherical and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">groined </span>vaulting <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>used for smaller chambers only; but the<br/>
arcades <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Barlstsli </span>mosque (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">282</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, with their depressed <span style="color: #0000FF;">spherical </span>brick vaulting, form an exception to this rule. In secular<br/>
buildings the use of vaulting is much more <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ease </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">city-gate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bil</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cn-Naer </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">230</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>and other arched <span style="color: #0000FF;">passages</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The entire ground-floors <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>palaces are also sometimes<br/>
vaulted, and bridges and <span style="color: #0000FF;">aqueducts </span>were usually executed in barrel<br/>
vaulting, or with pointed arches<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Decorations generally consist of panelling or <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>paintings,<br/>
destitute of structural meaning, while <span style="color: #0000FF;">pilasters</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornices</span>, and other<br/>
architectural embellishments are <span style="color: #0000FF;">rare </span>This species of ornamentation was doubtless originally suggested by the carpets, fringes,<br/>
and mats, used by the Arabs for covering their walls. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">stalaetite<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eorbellings</span>, on the other hand, which mask the union of the vertical<br/>
with the horizontal parts of the building, and take the <span style="color: #ff0000;">place </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>vaulting used in western architecture, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>structural<br/>
character; but even these perform no real architectural function<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>form a mere fantastic decoration of the angles of the domes.<br/>
<br/>
The panel and frieze decorations are either foliage, geometrical<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">figures</span>, or written characters. The Foliage is usually shaped in<br/>
rectangular relief, with a few incisions to divide the broader<br/>
surfaces<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The moulding is generally more or less in conformity<br/>
with the spirit of the classical style, but in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">conventional<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">atahesques </span>the leaves and other parts of plants of a southern<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">climate </span>are recognisable. The Geometrical Figures consist either<br/>
of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">kaleidoscopie </span>arrangement of constantly recurring fantastic<br/>
forms, or of a series of intertwined and broken lines. Lastly,<br/>
the Arabic Written Characters with which the friezes are often<br/>
decorated, and more particularly the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cutie </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sullus </span>characters,<br/>
are peculiarly well adapted for ornamental purposes, as they<br/>
resemble decorative foliage, although destitute of its strictly symmetrical <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>continuous character. When the writing is employed for lengthy inscriptions in low relief, the ground on which<br/>
it is placed is generally covered with slightly raised arabesques.<br/>
