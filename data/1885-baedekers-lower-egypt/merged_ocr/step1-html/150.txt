<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilarmachis</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the great<br/>
god<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>years, was also associated with the worship<br/>
of Ita. As Apis is associated with Ptah, so<br/>
this bird by the side of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra </span>is a symbol of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">soul </span>of Osiris. - <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra </span>is generally represented with the head of a hawk, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured </span>red. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>holds in his hands the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sylrrbols </span>of life and sovereignty, and wears on<br/>
his head a disk with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Urmis </span>serpent, or<br/>
basilisk<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>According to the esoteric <span style="color: #ff0000;">andpantheistic </span>construction of the inscriptions <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the tombs of the kings, Ra is the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Universe </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">15 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">raw</span>), and the gods themselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>merely so many <span style="color: #0000FF;">impersonations </span>of his<br/>
various attributes (see Ammon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>, p. 138).<br/>
<br/>
Tum, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alum</span>. a manifestation of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ila</span>,<br/>
whose name is perhaps akin <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.tem.i</span>, signifying the universe, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">liNt </span>worshipped in<br/>
Lower Egypt, particularly at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis </span>and<br/>
at the city of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pa-tum</span>, that is,'the place of<br/>
Tum', the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pithom </span>of Scripture. His rites<br/>
were also celebrated in Upper Egypt at an<br/>
early period. He is one of the oldest of the<br/>
gods, having existed'on the waters' in the<br/>
dark chaos of the embryonic <span style="color: #0000FF;">world</span>, prior to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fhst </span>sunrise, or birth of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis </span>from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>lotus flower. According to the later <span style="color: #0000FF;">exoteric </span>views he was the setting sun, the<br/>
harbinger of the coolness of evening. Under<br/>
his guidance mankind was <span style="color: #0000FF;">created </span>by<br/>
Khnum, and he was the dispenser of the<br/>
welcome northerly breezes. He was also <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>approved warrior against the dark powers<br/>
of the infernal regions which obstruct the<br/>
progress of the sun's bark, and is represented as a bearded man with a combined<br/>
Upper and Lower Egyptian crown, or the<br/>
orb of the sun, on his <span style="color: #0000FF;">head</span>, and the emblems<br/>
of sovereignty and life in his hands. As the<br/>
creator he sometimes has a <span style="color: #ff0000;">scarabzeus </span>for<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">head</span>; as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nefer-Tum </span>he has the head of<br/>
a lion, surmounted by a hawk crowned with<br/>
<br/>
lotus <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowers</span>, and holds an ut'a eye<br/>
<br/>
Tum <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lord </span>in his hand. As representing the setting of<br/>
<br/>
of the world<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>the sun preparatory to its rising again, he<br/>
