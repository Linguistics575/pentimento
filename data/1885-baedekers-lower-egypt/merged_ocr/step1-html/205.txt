</span>furniture and hangings, and in the jewellery <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>women. These<br/>
indications of wealth are never seen except by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">proprietor's<br/>
</span>nearest relations and the female friends of his wives, and are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">effectually </span>concealed from the view of the government and of the<br/>
general public.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to Sculpture and Painting it will strike the traveller that the modern Egyptian chisel and brush have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">reserved </span>exclusively for the decoration of wall surfaces. Representations<br/>
of animals occur rarely, while those of the human <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>were<br/>
prohibited by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">camp</span>. p. 218). The latter, however, are<br/>
occasionally met with. One of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulunides</span>, for example, caused<br/>
a festal hall to be adorned with painted wooden statues of himself,<br/>
his wives, and his favourite dancers; and at Cairo there was<br/>
even a famous manufactory of figures of men and animals at that<br/>
period. In the 11th <span style="color: #ff0000;">cent.</span>, as we are informed, there were two <span style="color: #0000FF;">celebrated </span>painters at Cairo who vied with each other in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">execution </span>of relief pictures. One of them painted a dancer, who seemed<br/>
to be disappearing into the wall, while his rival painted another<br/>
who seemed to be coming out from it. El-Kitami's picture of<br/>
Joseph in the pit was also a far-famed work. On the whole, however, these branches of art were but little developed, the Egyptians resembling the Israelites in this respect. The Arabs were<br/>
more successful, however, in the prosecution of artistic handicrafts,<br/>
and excelled in the embellishment of <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>kinds of implements in<br/>
metal-work, enamel, inlaying, engraving, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc</span>. Their decorative<br/>
ingenuity, developed by these arts quite as much as by the wall<br/>
decorations, and applied to textile fabrics also, has attained so<br/>
wide a celebrity, that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">word'Arabesque</span>' is now nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">synonymous </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with'ornament</span>'. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">word'Grotesque</span>' was once similarly<br/>
applied to the western style of decoration borrowed by Raphael<br/>
and Giovanni da <span style="color: #ff0000;">Udine </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Grottoes</span>' of the Baths of Titus at<br/>
Rome, and employed by them with singular success in the loggie<br/>
of the Vatican, but this <span style="color: #0000FF;">word </span>has long since lost its original<br/>
meaning.<br/>
<br/>
The Mosques are divided, in accordance with their religious<br/>
importance, into two kinds: (<span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>) those in which the sermon<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">thuibeh</span>) is preached on Fridays, called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Giimi</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">CT</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">those </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>which<br/>
prayer only is offered daily except on Fridays, named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jfespidr</span>,<br/>
or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ztftviya</span>. The name <span style="color: #ff0000;">mesgid</span>, which has been imported from<br/>
Constantinople, is less frequently used than <span style="color: #0000FF;">zawiya</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>denotes a small mosque, consisting of one chamber only.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is from this word <span style="color: #ff0000;">mesgid </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>which means a place for <span style="color: #0000FF;">prostration</span>),<br/>
that we derive the word mosque<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Spanish </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mezquita </span>and the<br/>
French <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosqu√©e</span>.<br/>
