</span>bound the gorge. Lepsius has proved that the laborious task of<br/>
making this path was first undertaken by the Christian monks.<br/>
The torrents in this rocky gorge in winter are often so violent as<br/>
to carry everything before them. In 1867 they were <span style="color: #0000FF;">swelled </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">such<br/>
</span>a height, that they washed away a camp of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Serif</span>, causing a loss of 40 lives and <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cattle</span>, in the<br/>
midst of the arid desert. The last part of the ascent is less <span style="color: #ff0000;">preoipitons</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>now observe a few traces <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vegetation</span>. The rocks<br/>
here also bear some <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sinaitic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- At the upper end<br/>
of the defile the barren cliffs of the Sinai group become visible,<br/>
and a view is at length obtained of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ram </span>plain, surrounded<br/>
by lofty mountains, and not <span style="color: #0000FF;">unlike </span>a huge amphitheatre. At the<br/>
end of the valley rises the bold and conspicuous rock, known as<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rois </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ee.Saf.soff </span>(p. 513), which the members of the last Sinai<br/>
expedition, following Dr. Robinson, believe to be the true scene<br/>
of the promulgation of the law. The plain of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Er-ilil.ta</span>, which we<br/>
reach by at first descending a little, and afterwards ascending, the<br/>
path improving as we advance, is supposed by the same travellers<br/>
and explorers to have been the <span style="color: #0000FF;">camping-place </span>of the Israelites.<br/>
A dark-green spot, in which antimony is probably to be found,<br/>
is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kold't </span>after that mineral. After having crossed another<br/>
slight eminence, we reach the sand of the plain. A block of rock<br/>
lying here (perhaps an old boundary stone), bearing peculiar<br/>
marks, is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">subject </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>an Arabian tradition, to the effect that<br/>
the Gindi tribe, having been unjustly treated by the monks<br/>
of the monastery of St. Catharine, who favoured the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jeheliyeh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>503), struck their lances into this block in token of <span style="color: #0000FF;">continuation<br/>
</span>of the oath of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheikh</span>, that the monks should never pass this<br/>
stone. About <span style="color: #ff0000;">11/2 </span>hr. after leaving the summit of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nahh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elWvwi</span>, we pass, on the left, the mouth of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mrhdi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">esh-Sh√©lch<br/>
</span>(p. 520) on<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span>The gorge, called the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span>ed-Mr, or the <span style="color: #ff0000;">WtidiShueaib<br/>
</span>(valley of Jethro), ascending gradually, and closed by the hill of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">3fundja</span>, opens before us. To the <span style="color: #0000FF;">left </span>of its entrance rises the hill<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harlin</span>, on the summit of which Aaron (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1mm</span>) is said to have<br/>
set up the golden calf<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In the vicinity are the remains of stone<br/>
huts, built <span style="color: #0000FF;">by'Almis </span>Pasha in 1853 and <span style="color: #0000FF;">1854 </span>for the workmen<br/>
and soldiers who attended him. We enter the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shu'aib </span>valley, flanked by enormous <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliffs </span>of reddish-brown granite, towering to a<br/>
dizzy height. In 1/2 hr. more we reach the terraces of the green<br/>
garden of the monastery which lies to the right of the path, and<br/>
the caravan stops in front of the monastery.<br/>
<br/>
Accommodation. Formerly, <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>the monks were frequently attacked<br/>
by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>of the peninsula, visitors were drawn up into the monastery through an opening over the gate, which was always carefully<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">closed</span>, by means <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">rope </span>with a wooden cross attached to the end.<br/>
At the present day the traveller presents theletter of introduction which<br/>
<br/>
he <span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span>obtained through his Consulate at Cairo, and is admitted by a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">aide-door</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>and camels remain outside. The monastery<br/>
