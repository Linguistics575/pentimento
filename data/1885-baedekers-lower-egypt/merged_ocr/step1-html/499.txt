regular streets consist <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>of light and temporary brick <span style="color: #0000FF;">build-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ings</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The population (<span style="color: #ff0000;">17,058</span>, including 6000 Europeans) is similar<br/>
in character to that of Suez, but the French element preponderates<br/>
here still more. The construction of the harbour was attended<br/>
with immense <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieulty</span>. It occupies an area of 570 <span style="color: #0000FF;">acres</span>, and<br/>
has been excavated to a depth of 20 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>by means of laborious<br/>
dredging. It is protected by two massive piers; the eastern <span style="color: #0000FF;">running </span>out into the sea towards the N. for a distance of an English<br/>
mile; and the western, running towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.E</span>. for 11/2 M.,<br/>
being still <span style="color: #ff0000;">mafinished</span>. Where they start from the land these piers<br/>
are 1440 yds. apart, but their extremities approach within 770 yds.<br/>
of each other. The navigable entrance, marked by buoys which<br/>
are lighted at night, is only <span style="color: #ff0000;">100-100 </span>yds. in width. (Those who<br/>
have leisure may hire a boat for a cruise in the harbour or for<br/>
the purpose of visiting one of the large steamers lying at anchor.)<br/>
The most serious risk to which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">harbour </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>exposed is that of<br/>
being choked up with the Nile mud which is deposited on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusiac </span>coast by a current in the Mediterranean, constantly <span style="color: #0000FF;">flowing<br/>
</span>from the west (<span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>p. 207). The western pier is intended to<br/>
ward <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>these accumulations of sand and mud, and also to<br/>
shelter the harbour from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. winds which prevail <span style="color: #0000FF;">during<br/>
</span>two-thirds of the year; and it is therefore of great length and solidity. Both piers were constructed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Freres </span>Dussaud of<br/>
blocks of artificial stone, manufactured of seven parts of sand from<br/>
the desert and one part of hydraulic lime imported from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ard√©ehe<br/>
</span>in France. The concrete was mixed by machinery and poured into<br/>
large wooden moulds, in which it remained for several weeks. The<br/>
moulds were then removed, and the blocks exposed to the air to<br/>
harden them more thoroughly. Each block weighed 20 tons, and<br/>
measured about 131/3 cubic yards in solid content. Thirty of them<br/>
were manufactured daily, and 25,000 in all were required.<br/>
<br/>
'Above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wooden </span>moulds, which covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">extensive </span>piece of<br/>
ground, was constructed a tramway, bearing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">steam-crane</span>, which could<br/>
be moved to any required spot, for the purpose <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>hoisting the blocks<br/>
and conveying them to their destination. After having been hoisted by<br/>
the crane<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the blocks were transported to a boat, where they were placed<br/>
on an inclined plane in <span style="color: #0000FF;">twos </span>or threes, and secured by <span style="color: #0000FF;">menu </span>of wedges.<br/>
They were then conveyed to the place where they were to be sunk, the<br/>
wedges were removed, and the huge masses then slid down the incline,<br/>
splitting the wood and emitting sparks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">tire </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>way, and plunged<br/>
into the water with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">tremendous </span>splash, while the boat staggered from<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">effects </span>of the shock and <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>lashed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">w </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es </span>thus artificially<br/>
caused. These <span style="color: #0000FF;">huge'pierres </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">perdues</span>', as they are <span style="color: #0000FF;">technically </span>called<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>were<br/>
thus gradually heaped up until they reached the surface, and the last<br/>
layers, rising <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little above the level of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">water</span>, were <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span>deposited<br/>
by means <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">crane </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>board of a steamboat'.<br/>
<br/>
On the strip of land separating Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menzaleh </span>from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mediterranean </span>rises the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Liguhouse</span>, constructed of concrete, <span style="color: #0000FF;">16-1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in<br/>
height, and one of the largest in the world. Its electric lights are<br/>
visible to a distance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">21 </span>M. To the E. of it are quays and workshops. The streets extend along <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>side of the Inner Harbour<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
