about as numerous as the last, and in some respects contrasts<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">favourably </span>with it. The Armenians generally possess excellent<br/>
abilities, and a singular aptitude for learning both Oriental and<br/>
European languages, which they often acquire with great <span style="color: #0000FF;">grammatical </span>accuracy. Many of them are wealthy <span style="color: #0000FF;">goldsmiths </span>and jewellers, and they often <span style="color: #0000FF;">hold </span>important government <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Jews are often distinguishable by their red hair from the<br/>
native Egyptians, as well as by other <span style="color: #0000FF;">characteristics </span>Most of them<br/>
are from Palestine, but many have recently immigrated from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wallachia</span>. All the <span style="color: #0000FF;">money-changers </span>in the streets (<span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mrr√©f</span>), and many<br/>
of the wealthiest merchants of Egypt, are Jews, and notwithstanding the popular prejudice entertained against them, owing as is<br/>
alleged to their disregard of cleanliness, they now form, thanks to<br/>
the impartiality of the present government, one of the most highly<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">respected </span>sections of the community.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">10</span>). EUROPEANS. The number of European residents and<br/>
visitors in Egypt at the census of 1882 was <span style="color: #0000FF;">82,000</span>, exclusive of<br/>
the British army of occupation. The Greeks are most numerously<br/>
represented, then the Italians, French, English (including <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maltese</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>,<br/>
Austrians (including many <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dalmatians </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, and Germans. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous </span>Swiss residents in Egypt, who are not represented by a<br/>
consul of their own, are distributed among the above leading <span style="color: #ff0000;">elasses </span>(French, Italian, <span style="color: #0000FF;">German </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>Beside these nationalities, there<br/>
are also a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">representatives </span>of Russia, America<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Belgium, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sean-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">dinavia</span>, and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">countries </span>Each of the above leading <span style="color: #ff0000;">natioualities </span>shows a preference for one or more particular <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupations</span>, in which they sometimes enjoy a complete monopoly. The<br/>
Greeks of all classes are generally traders. They constitute the <span style="color: #0000FF;">aristocracy </span>of Alexandria, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">vietual-dealers </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">ba.k.kdl</span>) in all the<br/>
other towns are mostly <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheeks</span>. They are the proprietors of the<br/>
numerous small banks which lend money <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>good security, both to<br/>
the peasantry and the government <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>, at a rate of interest<br/>
sometimes amounting to <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>per cent monthly, the maximum <span style="color: #ff0000;">permittedbylaw</span>; and they <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">only </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Europeans </span>who <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>established<br/>
themselves permanently as merchants beyond the <span style="color: #ff0000;">emriiues </span>of Egypt<br/>
proper. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheeks </span>also have the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unenviable </span>notoriety of committing numerous murders, thefts, and other crimes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>it must<br/>
be <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>in mind that they are by far the most numerous section<br/>
of the European community (35,000 from Greece alone, besides<br/>
many Turkish <span style="color: #0000FF;">subjects</span>), and that some 30,000 of them belong to<br/>
the lowest class of emigrants from an unhappy and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ill-touditioned<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span>Many of these crimes must, moreover, be regarded as the<br/>
outcome of the sadly misdirected daring and ability <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">characterise </span>their nation. The superiority of the Greeks to the<br/>
