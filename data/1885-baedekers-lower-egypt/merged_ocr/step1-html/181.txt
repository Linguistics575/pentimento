<span>HISTORY <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>ART. 150<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">e </span>apels for themselves (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastaba</span>) in the form of blunted pyramids,<br/>
in order, as it were, to pay homage to the memory <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>illustrious<br/>
masters. The pictorial decorations of these temples, as well as the<br/>
plastic works of the same period, <span style="color: #0000FF;">serve </span>most impressively to <span style="color: #0000FF;">complete </span>the artistic <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>of the pyramids. While their marvellously<br/>
perfect execution <span style="color: #0000FF;">alone </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">indicates </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">high </span>state <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">artistic </span>development,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">our </span>admiration is specially aroused by the striking fidelity to nature<br/>
and expressiveness of the sculptures<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable </span>criticisms<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>Egyptian sculpture formerly current may indeed now be regarded<br/>
as entirely refuted. Even in European museums an opportunity is<br/>
afforded to the traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">becoming </span>acquainted with the noble style<br/>
by which the early Egyptian art alone is characterised. What visitor<br/>
to the Louvre, for example, can fail to remember the striking<br/>
impression produced by the statue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Writer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>The expressive<br/>
eyes are formed of dark quartz containing a transparent pupil of<br/>
rock crystal fixed with a small knob of metal, while the attitude is <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable </span>for its lifelike fidelity and strong individuality. This statue<br/>
dates from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifth </span>or sixth dynasty<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and the museum <span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bt1lil.c </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">contains </span>other plastic works of the same period in which an almost overdrawn realism is still more apparent. The limestone statue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">RaNefer</span>, a priest of Ptah-Sokar at Memphis, and the wooden figure of<br/>
the'village <span style="color: #0000FF;">shr'yrch</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">305</span>), which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Paris </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Exhibition </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1867 </span>has<br/>
brought into so favourable notice, are the best-known specimens of<br/>
a style of art of Which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">existence </span>was unsuspected a few decades ago, and the discovery of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>has tended greatly to modify<br/>
the old <span style="color: #0000FF;">supposition </span>that the Egyptian sculptors executed their works<br/>
in mere mechanical accordance with a prescribed <span style="color: #0000FF;">canon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The chief<br/>
merit of the earliest Egyptian sculpture is the faithfulness of the<br/>
portraiture, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is such that the identity of the person represented<br/>
by two <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>statues may often be determined by the similarity<br/>
of the features, even <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>executed at different periods of the person's life. In this way have been identified eight statues of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khat'ra</span>,<br/>
the third king of the fourth dynasty, although all differing in <span style="color: #0000FF;">measurement</span>, material, and the age represented (comp. pp. 305, <span style="color: #0000FF;">3071</span>.<br/>
Observation of nature in the case of these earliest works has evidently been carried into the <span style="color: #ff0000;">minutest </span>details. The race of men represented is uniformly <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>same character, somewhat resembling<br/>
that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin</span>; the figures are of a powerful. <span style="color: #ff0000;">thiekset<br/>
</span>type, and their muscles are faithfully represented<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>to<br/>
exaggeration. These early sculptors, however, were incapable of<br/>
producing works of a more complex character, where excellence<br/>
of general <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>required to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">superadded </span>to accuracy <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofdetail</span>, and<br/>
in this respect they were far surpassed by their successors<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Even<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>reliefs in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tomb-ehambers </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memphis </span>are executed in a<br/>
singularly fresh and <span style="color: #0000FF;">unsophisticated </span>style, and the spectator will<br/>
hardly regret the absence ofthe <span style="color: #0000FF;">later </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">period</span>.<br/>
After the sixth dynasty there occurs <span style="color: #0000FF;">asudden </span>falling away <span style="color: #ff0000;">from<br/>
