<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tlr</span>, Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">J</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">PYRAMIDS </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iiZEII</span>.

<br/>
said to have erected them for their wives. These works are <span style="color: #0000FF;">unquestionably </span>the most remarkable in all Egypt, whether in respect<br/>
of the size of the buildings and their cost, or the skill <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>artists.<br/>
And it is thought that the architects deserve even more admiration<br/>
than the kings who defrayed the cost; for the former contributed to<br/>
the completion of the work by mental power and <span style="color: #0000FF;">praiseworthy </span>exertion, but the latter only by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>wealth they had inherited and the<br/>
labour of <span style="color: #0000FF;">others </span>Neither the <span style="color: #0000FF;">natives</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>however, nor the historians<br/>
at all agree in their accounts of the pyramids. For some maintain<br/>
that they were built by these three kings, and others that they were<br/>
built by different persons'.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>'s account is remarkably graphic and concise: <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ur </span>you<br/>
go l'orty stadia from the city (of Memphis), you come to a hill on<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>stand many pyramids, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">burial-plaees </span>of kings. Three are<br/>
particularly remarkable, and two of these are even <span style="color: #0000FF;">reckoned </span>among<br/>
the seven wonders. They are square in form and a stadium in height,<br/>
and this height is only slightly greater than the length of each<br/>
side. One pyramid, too, is a little larger than the other. A<br/>
moderate distance up one of its sides, this pyramid has a stone<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>can be taken <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>When it is removed, an oblique passage<br/>
within leads to the tomb. These pyramids are near each other in<br/>
the same open space; and a little higher up the hill is the third,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">much </span>smaller than <span style="color: #ff0000;">those </span>two, but erected in a much more costly<br/>
style. For, from its foundation nearly up to the middle, it <span style="color: #0000FF;">consists<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">black </span>stone, of which mortars are also made, and which is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">brought </span>from a long distance, namely from the mountains <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEthiopia</span>. Owing to its hardness and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">diffiiwlty </span>of working it, the<br/>
building is rendered <span style="color: #0000FF;">expensive</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo </span>then speaks of the fossils resembling <span style="color: #0000FF;">lentils</span>, mentioned<br/>
at p. 330, but does not share the view current at that period<br/>
that they were the <span style="color: #ff0000;">potritied </span>remains of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">workmen</span>'s food. With<br/>
regard to <span style="color: #ff0000;">llhodopis</span>, who is mentioned at p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">356</span>, he tells the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">following </span>tradition, resembling the tale of the modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cinderella</span>.<br/>
While <span style="color: #ff0000;">llhodopis </span>was bathing, an eagle carried off one <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>her shoes,<br/>
carried it to Memphis, and dropped it into the lap of the king, who<br/>
was then sitting on the judgment seat. The king, admiring the<br/>
neatness <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the shoe, and surprised at <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>strangeness of the occurrence<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>sent out messengers to search for the owner of the shoe. She<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">was </span>found at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Naukratis </span>and brought to the king, who made her his<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">wife</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>on her death erected the third pyramid to her memory.<br/>
<br/>
Pliny speaks somewhat <span style="color: #0000FF;">slightingly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pyramids </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'We<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>also in <span style="color: #0000FF;">passing </span>mention the Pyramids in this same Egypt, an<br/>
idle and foolish <span style="color: #0000FF;">display </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the kings of their wealth; and indeed,<br/>
as most <span style="color: #0000FF;">persons </span>maintain, they had no other object in <span style="color: #0000FF;">erecting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">them<br/>
</span>than to <span style="color: #0000FF;">deprive </span>their successors, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">rival</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>plotting against them,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>money, or perhaps for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">purpose </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">keeping </span>the people engaged.<br/>
The vanity <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>people in this matter was very great'<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
