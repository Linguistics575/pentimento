<br/>
from Pa Hebit. Some idea of the immense changes <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>have<br/>
taken place in the vegetation of this region since the era of hieroglyphics may be formed from the fact that, while the papyrus plant<br/>
was sedulously and successfully cultivated on both banks of the<br/>
Nile in the neighbourhood of Sebennytus, not a single specimen of<br/>
this useful plant is now to be met with, either here or in <span style="color: #0000FF;">any </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">other<br/>
</span>part of the Delta. On the N.W. side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins </span>of the temple<br/>
lies the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Behbit</span>, and adjoining it still exists the sacred<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lake </span>of the temple. The ruins of the venerable sanctuary of Isis<br/>
form an imposing and most picturesque mass of blocks, fragments<br/>
of columns and architraves, ceiling slabs, and other remains, <span style="color: #0000FF;">altogether </span>about 400 paces in circumference. We are reminded of<br/>
the animal <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacred </span>to Isis by the reliefs of cows and of <span style="color: #ff0000;">tigures </span>with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cows</span>' heads on several of the blocks of stone. The name of<br/>
Ptolemy <span style="color: #ff0000;">II</span>. Philadelphus I. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">13.0</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">284-246</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">284-22 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">O</span>, the founder of<br/>
the temple, occurs in several <span style="color: #0000FF;">places</span>. The structure must have<br/>
been a very costly one, as it consisted entirely of beautiful granite,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>grey, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">partly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">red </span>in colour, brought from a great distance.<br/>
The sculptures (<span style="color: #ff0000;">hautreliefs </span>and reliefs en <span style="color: #0000FF;">cream</span>) are <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">elaborately<br/>
</span>executed. Several of the female heads and busts, and some of the<br/>
eows' heads also, are remarkably fine. In some of the inscriptions<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>are unusually large, in others they are of small<br/>
and elegant form, and in all they are executed in the somewhat<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flourishing </span>style peculiar to the age of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span>. The chief<br/>
deities revered here were Isis, with Osiris <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus</span>, besides whom<br/>
occur <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seb </span>and Nut, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu</span>, the triad of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sehu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tefnut</span>,<br/>
and Anhur, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebek</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hapi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>the Nile), and Anubis in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>form of<br/>
Horus, as the avenger of his father. We may also remark here that<br/>
Anubis, the martyr, <span style="color: #ff0000;">wasanative </span>of Naisi, or the Iseum, on the site<br/>
of which we now stand. On the W. side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins </span>is an interesting large slab of grey <span style="color: #0000FF;">granite</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>veined with red, on which is<br/>
represented the king offering a gift of land to Osiris and Isis,'the<br/>
great divine mistress of <span style="color: #ff0000;">IJehit</span>'. Higher up there is another block<br/>
of grey granite, with a representation of Isis <span style="color: #ff0000;">euthroned</span>, and of the<br/>
king offering to'his mother' two small bags of the green mineral<br/>
called mafkat and mes.tem, or eye-paint. The inscriptions consist of<br/>
the usual <span style="color: #0000FF;">formulae </span>regarding <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>None of them are perfect,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>many must still be concealed among the ruins. The pylons<br/>
have disappeared, and with them the historical inscriptions also.<br/>
One of the sculptures represents a procession of the gods of the<br/>
nome, but unfortunately their names are not given. In one case<br/>
Isis calls the king'her brother'. Adjoining a <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the goddess<br/>
is the inscription: -'Isis, mistress of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hebit</span>, who lays everything<br/>
before her royal brother'. On a grey <span style="color: #0000FF;">block </span>of granite, lying in an<br/>
oblique position, is represented the sacred bark of Isis, resembling<br/>
those seen elsewhere in bronze only<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The cabin is like a house of<br/>
two stories, in the upper <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>which sits the goddess, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">cow</span>'s horns<br/>
<br/>
