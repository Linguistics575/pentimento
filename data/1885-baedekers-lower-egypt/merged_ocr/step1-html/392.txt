</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the same hill, at a height of <span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span>a hundred feet. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chephren </span>is<br/>
said to have reigned <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty-sis </span>years.'<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">This </span>makes altogether a hundred and six years, during which<br/>
the Egyptians suffered all kinds of oppression, and the temples<br/>
constantly remained closed<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Owing to their hatred of these two<br/>
kings, the people would not even mention their names, and they<br/>
even call the pyramids after a shepherd named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philitis</span>, who at that<br/>
period <span style="color: #0000FF;">pastured </span>his <span style="color: #ff0000;">floeks </span>in the neighbourhood".<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'After </span>this king (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Chephren</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Myeerinns</span>, the son of Cheops, is<br/>
said to <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>reigned over <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>is said to have had no pleasure<br/>
in the conduct of his father, but to have <span style="color: #ff0000;">re-openedthe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">temples </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and<br/>
</span>to have allowed the people, reduced to extreme distress, to return<br/>
to their occupations and the worship of the gods. He is also said<br/>
to have pronounced the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">just </span>judgments of all the kings<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>'<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Ire</span>, too, left behind him a pyramid, but a much smaller one<br/>
than that built by his father. Each of its sides measures 280 feet<br/>
only, and half of it consists <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEthiopian </span>stone. Some <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Greeks<br/>
</span>state that this was the pyramid of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rhodopis7 </span>a <span style="color: #ff0000;">eourtezan</span>; but they<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>wrong; nay, when they maintain this, they do not seem to me<br/>
even to know who this <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhodopis </span>was, for she <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourished </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the time<br/>
of King Amasis, and not in the reign of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span>(comp. p. 348).'<br/>

The account given by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diodoms </span>Siculus <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">j</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">63</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Vi</span>) is as follows:<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">-'The </span>eighth king was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chembes</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mernphite</span>, who reigned<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lifty </span>years. He built the largest of the three pyramids, which<br/>
were reckoned among the seven wonders of the world. They are<br/>
to be found in the direction of Libya, <span style="color: #0000FF;">120 </span>stadia distant from<br/>
Memphis, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">io </span>from the Nile. The sight of these great masses<br/>
and their artistic construction excites surprise and admiration. The<br/>
base of the largest, the plan of which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">quadrilateral</span>, is seven<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">plethra </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ci00 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft.</span>) on <span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span>side; and the height is more than six<br/>
plethra. The sides gradually contract towards the top, where<br/>
each is still six <span style="color: #ff0000;">cnbits </span>broad. The whole <span style="color: #0000FF;">building </span>is of hard<br/>
stone, <span style="color: #ff0000;">rliffieult </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">how</span>, and it <span style="color: #ff0000;">is </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofeverlasting </span>duration. <span style="color: #ff0000;">l'ornoless<br/>
</span>than a thousand (some writers even say three thousand) years are<br/>
said to have elapsed from the building of the pyramids down to<br/>
the present time; and yet these stones, in their original jointing,<br/>
and the whole structure are preserved uninjured by time. The<br/>
stones are said to <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>been brought all the way from Arabia,<br/>
and the building to have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">erected </span>by means of <span style="color: #0000FF;">embankments</span>,<br/>
as no lifting machines had yet been invented<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>And the most<br/>
wonderful thing is, that, around the place <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>this enormous<br/>
work is built, nothing is to be found but sandy <span style="color: #0000FF;">soil</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">thereisno<br/>
</span>trace either of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">embankment </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span>of the stones; so<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>might <span style="color: #ff0000;">lmlieve </span>that the whole mass had not been gradually<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on-vtml </span>by human hands, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>had been placed by some god in <span style="color: #0000FF;">this<br/>
