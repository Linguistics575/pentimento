<span style="color: #0000FF;">iris </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>principle of light, while <span style="color: #0000FF;">Typhon </span>is that of darkness,<br/>
which <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osirisdefeats </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">banishes </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">internal </span>regions<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Isis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilathor<br/>
</span>mourns over his <span style="color: #ff0000;">disappearance</span>, follows him towards <span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
</span>West, where she gives <span style="color: #0000FF;">birth<br/>
</span>to Horus, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">annihilates<br/>
</span>darkness and restores his<br/>
father to his lost position<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>When Ra is termed the soul<br/>
of Osiris, the meaning is that<br/>
he renders visible the hidden<br/>
principle of light (Osiris).<br/>
When, on the other hand,<br/>
Osiris is regarded as <span style="color: #ff0000;">emblematieal </span>of the principle of<br/>
moisture, the most perfect<br/>
embodiment of which is the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">god </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hapi</span>, or the Nile, Typhon<br/>
and his seventy-two <span style="color: #0000FF;">companions </span>represent the days of<br/>
drought. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Like </span>the dead body<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris</span>, the water <span style="color: #0000FF;">flows </span>towards the North, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">languishing </span>Isis, that is, the<br/>
fruit-bearing earth, mourns over the loss of the fertilising power;<br/>
but this is for a short <span style="color: #0000FF;">period </span>only, for <span style="color: #ff0000;">lIorus </span>soon <span style="color: #ff0000;">vauquishes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Typhou </span>in the southern districts, and the rising Nile again begins to<br/>
impregnate the black soil with abundant fertility. Lastly, when<br/>
Osiris is regarded as the principle of life, Isis, the earth, is the<br/>
scene of the operation of that principle, while Typhon represents<br/>
death, and Horus the resurrection<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">If </span>we regard Osiris, as the<br/>
monuments so frequently do, as a pure and perfect being, the<br/>
principle <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>good and the beautiful, in which case he receives the<br/>
surname of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Un-Ne/tr</span>, we recognise in Typhon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">discords </span>with<br/>
which life is so replete, but which seem to be permitted only in order<br/>
that the purity of the harmonies into <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they are resolved through<br/>
the intervention <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Horus may be the more thoroughly appreciated.<br/>
Osiris, according to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">esoteric </span>doctrine, is also the sovereign of<br/>
the lower regions and the judge of souls, which, if found pure, are<br/>
permitted to unite with his. The dead, therefore, do not merely go<br/>
to Osiris, but actually become Osiris. Osiris is always represented<br/>
with a human head. He either sits as a king on his throne, or appears in the form of a mummy. He always wields the scourge and<br/>
crook, and sometimes other emblems also. The crown of Upper<br/>
Egypt which he <span style="color: #0000FF;">wears </span>on his head is usually garnished before and<br/>
behind with the ostrich feathers of truth. Beside him, even in<br/>
very ancient representations, stands a kind of thyrsus or entwined<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>Osiris, prince of eternity<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
