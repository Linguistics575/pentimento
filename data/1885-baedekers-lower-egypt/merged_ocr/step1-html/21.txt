<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">INTRODUCTION</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>"shall now speak <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">greater </span>length of<br/>
Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>it <span style="color: #0000FF;">contains </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wonders </span>than<br/>
(my <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>land, and is <span style="color: #0000FF;">pve-eminent </span>above<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">countries </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the world for works<br/>
that one can hardly describe<span style="color: #ff0000;">?<br/>
<br/>
</span>HERODOTUS (<span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1156</span>).<br/>
<br/>
At the close of <span style="color: #0000FF;">let </span>century Egypt was in a great measure <span style="color: #0000FF;">rediscovered </span>by the French savants attached to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bonaparte</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>Egyptian<br/>
expedition. Since that period it has attracted the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ever-increasing<br/>
</span>attention of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">seientife</span>; its historical and <span style="color: #0000FF;">archaeological </span>marvels<br/>
have <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>gradually unveiled to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">world </span>it is the most ancient,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">was </span>yet at one time the most civilised country of antiquity;<br/>
and it therefore cannot fail to awaken the <span style="color: #ff0000;">profoundest </span>interest in<br/>
all students of the history and development of human <span style="color: #0000FF;">culture<br/>
<br/>
</span>Like other countries of the far East, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>possesses for the<br/>
'Frank' traveller the twofold attraction of scenery and history. To<br/>
the first category belong the peculiar charms of its Oriental climate,<br/>
the singularly clear atmosphere, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wonderful </span>colouring and effects<br/>
of light and shade, such as <span style="color: #ff0000;">areunknown </span>in more northern climates,<br/>
the exuberant <span style="color: #0000FF;">fertility </span>of the cultivated districts contrasted with the<br/>
solemn, <span style="color: #0000FF;">awe-inspiring </span>desert, and the manners, customs, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance </span>of a most interesting, though not always pleasing, <span style="color: #0000FF;">population</span>. At the same time Egypt is pre-eminent among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Countries </span>of the East, and indeed among those <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">wholeworld</span>, as the<br/>
cradle of history and of human culture. At every step we encounter venerable monuments which have survived the destructive<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">influenees </span>of thousands of years and the vandalism of invaders and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">conquerors</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and which are executed on so grand a scale, with so<br/>
much artistic skill, and with such historical consistency, as at<br/>
once to excite our highest admiration and command our most profound <span style="color: #0000FF;">respect</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Owing to its distance from the homes of most <span style="color: #0000FF;">travellers</span>, and to<br/>
the expense involved in exploring it, Egypt will never be overrun<br/>
by tourists to the same extent as Switzerland or Italy; but it is now<br/>
reached without <span style="color: #ff0000;">difileulty </span>by one of the numerous Mediterranean<br/>
steamboat lines, and increased facilities are afforded to travellers<br/>
by the recent construction of railways (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It</span>) within the country<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">itself</span>, while its unrivalled attractions abundantly reward the enterprising traveller and supply him with a subject <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflife- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">long </span>interest.<br/>
