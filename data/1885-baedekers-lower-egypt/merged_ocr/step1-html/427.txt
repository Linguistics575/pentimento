<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mad-dress </span>(pshent) with <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Urmus </span>snake, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whichis </span>crowned with a<br/>
cylinder sloping slightly outwards, and resembling the modius in<br/>
the head of Serapis. An <span style="color: #ff0000;">artifieial </span>beard is attached to the chin.<br/>
On his breast the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">wears </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shield </span>terminating in a groove at the<br/>
top (perhaps a kind <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pouch</span>, such as were worn by the Jewish priests<br/>
and those of Serapis), in the centre of which is inscribed his <span style="color: #ff0000;">pronomen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IU-user-ma </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">setep </span>en Ita, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.'god of the sun, mighty in the<br/>
truth, approved by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun</span>', while the god Ptah (<span style="color: #0000FF;">y</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span>, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lion-headed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sekhet </span>(Bast) stand by as bearers; the girdle, in<br/>
which a dagger is worn, bears both the pronomen and the surname<br/>
of Ramses, the favourite of Ammon, which is also inscribed on the<br/>
front of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stroll </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">staff </span>which he holds in his left hand. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>of the support of the left leg, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is in the attitude of<br/>
stepping forward, are two vertical rows of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span>, the lower<br/>
parts of which are broken off<span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1st </span>Line:'the princess and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">great</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">...</span>'; 2nd Line:'the <span style="color: #0000FF;">king</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">daughter</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, the great. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
</span>These fragments of inscriptions show that the figure of a daughter<br/>
of the king was placed at his feet. The figure of a son is still<br/>
distinctly recognisable, the arm being raised in an attitude of<br/>
prayer, and the hand touching the knee of the statue. - There<br/>
can be no doubt that this statue, the face of which, when erect,<br/>
was turned towards the N., is one of those erected by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.<br/>
</span>in front of the temple <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofPtah </span>(p. 373) at Memphis. In the time<br/>
of Strabo it perhaps stood alone in the anterior <span style="color: #0000FF;">court</span>, which was<br/>
used for bull-fights.'A colossal statue of a single <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>observes,'stands in the entrance court before the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptah</span>.<br/>
Bull-fights were exhibited here, for which express purpose some<br/>
persons keep hulls, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">horse-trainers </span>rear <span style="color: #0000FF;">horses</span>'. According to<br/>
Herodotus two of these statues were 30 <span style="color: #0000FF;">cubits </span>in height, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, as<br/>
the Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">cubit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>only about <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in length, nearly corresponds<br/>
to the 42 ft. which the statue actually measures. Both Herodotus and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus </span>state that Sesostris <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>.), on his return from a great and victorious campaign, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>invited at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pelusinm<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0n </span>the Egyptian frontier, with his wife and children, to a banquet<br/>
at the house of <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>brother. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">latter</span>, desiring to assassinate<br/>
Ramses, caused his tent to be surrounded with dry reeds after<br/>
the banquet, and to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>set on fire. The intoxicated servants <span style="color: #ff0000;">rendered </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ineffieient </span>aid, and the king's wife and children were in the<br/>
utmost danger. The king, thereupon, raised his hands in prayer,<br/>
dashed into the flames, and rescued them. Out of gratitude he<br/>
then erected this statue, at the foot of which the figures ofa <span style="color: #0000FF;">prince<br/>
</span>and princess were <span style="color: #0000FF;">placed</span>. Accessory <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of a similar kind,<br/>
however, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently </span>found with other statues to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>no such<br/>
story attaches.<br/>
<br/>
Close to the statue, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the left, in front <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fellih-hnt</span>, are<br/>
remains <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>statue, including a <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>foot, which, however, being<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sandstone</span>, probably did not belong to the statue of Ramses, which<br/>
