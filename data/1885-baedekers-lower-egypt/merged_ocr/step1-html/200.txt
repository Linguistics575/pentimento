<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">175 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BUILDINGS </span>OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MOHAMMEDANS</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades </span>used for scholastic purposes, is frequently adorned with<br/>
detached columns, which is not the ease with the religious <span style="color: #ff0000;">odifiees</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Interiors </span>of the mosques, on the other hand, are freely<br/>
embellished with <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span>, the court being usually bordered <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>, which is doubled or trebled on the side next the <span style="color: #ff0000;">prayerniehe </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">lcibla</span>).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>presents no example of a distinct Arabian order of <span style="color: #0000FF;">column</span>,<br/>
and hardly a <span style="color: #0000FF;">single </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabian </span>capital, those actually executed by Arabs<br/>
(such as those adjoining the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prayer-root</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the mosques) being<br/>
imperfectly <span style="color: #0000FF;">developed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and copied from Byzantine and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemalan<br/>
</span>models. The form of capital which seems peculiar to Cairo is very<br/>
simple and is also used as a base. Proceeding from the four corners<br/>
of the abacus in curved lines are four surfaces which unite below<br/>
with the ligature of the round or octagonal column. The numerous<br/>
columns which adorn the mosques and private houses originally<br/>
belonged, almost without exception, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roman </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemzean </span>structures, and sometimes to Christian churches. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedans<br/>
</span>did not, however, employ columns belonging to the ancient Egyptian<br/>
temples unless they had already been remodelled and used in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek<br/>
</span>or Roman structures. Thus the Roman pedestals with remains of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>occasionally seen in the mosques must originally have<br/>
belonged to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">temples</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The architects of the mosques <span style="color: #ff0000;">e01leeted </span>the columns they required for their purpose with little regard<br/>
to their dimensions. If they were too short, a pedestal, or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">reversed </span>capital was placed beneath them, regardless of the order to<br/>
which it <span style="color: #0000FF;">belonged</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ionic </span>and Corinthian columns are mingled <span style="color: #ff0000;">promiseuously</span>, and a certain degree of uniformity in the architecture<br/>
is only observed <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>the abacus is reached. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>this last lies a<br/>
second abacus of sycamore wood secured by a wooden bar, <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
</span>which lamps are frequently suspended.<br/>
<br/>
The arches of the Arcades are almost invariably pointed, being<br/>
at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>round, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>their sides go off at a tangent near the top; or<br/>
they gradually assume the keel-shape, being slightly curved inwards<br/>
below in the shape ofa horseshoe. There <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>also other forms which<br/>
approach still more nearly to the Gothic pointed arch; and there<br/>
seems little doubt that this form, so early and so generally employed<br/>
at Cairo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>exported thence to Sicily, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">became </span>tho type which<br/>
afterwards extended to Northern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Europe </span>Beyond this <span style="color: #0000FF;">resemblance<br/>
</span>in the form of the arch, however, and in some of the details of<br/>
the windows, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>pointed style possesses nothing in common with<br/>
the Arabian. The Gothic gateway of marble between the mosques<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">lialaton </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barliulitycls </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">278</span>) in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Derb </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Naltltttsin </span>must,<br/>
therefore, <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>regarded as a work executed under European <span style="color: #ff0000;">infh1prtee</span>. The popular account of it is that it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>brought from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>island.<br/>
<br/>
The arcades of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>mosques and other spacious halls are covered<br/>
with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>Ceiling of open-work, of almost uniform height. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>
