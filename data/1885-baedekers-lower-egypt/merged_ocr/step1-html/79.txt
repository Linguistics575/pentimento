<br/>
Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The breadth of the cultivable alluvial soil corresponds with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>above varying <span style="color: #0000FF;">width</span>, but nowhere exceeds <span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>miles. The soil<br/>
deposited by the Nile averages 33-38 ft. deep in Egypt, but near<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Iialytnr </span>at the head of the Delta it increases to about 50 ft., the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bottom </span>of it being at places below the level of the sea. The bed of<br/>
the river is also of considerable depth, and at low water the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mudbanks </span>(gef) rise above its surface to a height of 25 ft. in Upper<br/>
Egypt, and 14 ft. at Cairo. These are also the depths of the various<br/>
irrigation wells.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Throughout </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whale </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â© </span>of Egypt the Nile mud <span style="color: #0000FF;">rests </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>a bed of <span style="color: #ff0000;">seasand</span>. The whole <span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span>between the first cataract and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mediterranean </span>was formerly a narrow estuary, which was <span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span>filled by<br/>
degrees during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pleiocene </span>period with lagoon deposits, washed down<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crystalline </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Habesh</span>. At a later period. when Egypt had risen<br/>
from the sea <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cand </span>after the isthmus had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">formed</span>), the river forced<br/>
its <span style="color: #0000FF;">passage </span>through these deposits of mud<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>sweeping away <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">loose </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">particles </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>and depositing them again farther down.<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Frans</span>) The Nile soil is unlike any other in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">world </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Its </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">compusition</span>. According to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Regnanlt </span>it contains 63 per cent of <span style="color: #0000FF;">water </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sand</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">18 </span>per cent of <span style="color: #ff0000;">carbonate </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lime</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">9 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">per </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cent </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>quartz, <span style="color: #0000FF;">silica</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">felsPar</span>,<br/>
hornblende<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and epidote, <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>per cent <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>oxide of iron, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>per cent of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">carbonate </span>of magnesia<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Nothing certain is known regarding the average increase of the<br/>
alluvial land, all the calculations regarding it having hitherto been<br/>
based on erroneous or <span style="color: #0000FF;">insufficient </span>data. Thus the Nilometer of<br/>
antiquity furnishes the depth relatively to the level of the sea, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span>not absolutely. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">thicknessofearth </span>accumulated around buildings<br/>
of known <span style="color: #ff0000;">age </span>has also been found a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fallacious </span>guide; and lastly<br/>
local measurements lead to no result<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>as the river <span style="color: #0000FF;">often </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">capriciously<br/>
</span>washes away what it has deposited in previous years. An approximate calculation might possibly be made if the proportion of solid<br/>
matter annually brought down by the river could be ascertained,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>no investigation of this kind has ever been made<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It has sometimes been asserted that the desert has begun to <span style="color: #ff0000;">eneroaeh11pon </span>the<br/>
cultivated part of the valley, but <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sir </span>G. Wilkinson has shown, that,<br/>
while the sand of the desert may be advancing at places, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cultivable </span>bed of the valley is steadily increasing in thickness and width.<br/>
<br/>
The INUNDATION, as is obvious from what has already been<br/>
said, is more or less favourable according to the greater or less<br/>
amount of rain that falls among the Abyssinian mountains, for<br/>
that which falls in Central Africa is a more constant quantity,<br/>
being regulated by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">iufluenee </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">trade-winds</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Like the<br/>
waterspouts which descend on equatorial Africa<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">overflow </span>always recurs at the same season of the year, varying in its advent<br/>
by a few days only, and in its depth by several yards. At the beginning of June the river slowly begins to swell, and between the<br/>
15th and <span style="color: #0000FF;">20th </span>of July the increase becomes very rapid. Towards<br/>
the end <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofSeptemher </span>the water ceases <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rise</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">remaining </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">same<br/>
</span>height for a fortnight or more, but during the first half of October<br/>
it rises again and attains its highest <span style="color: #0000FF;">level </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">com1x </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>239)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">After<br/>
