<span style="color: #ff0000;">hahited </span>area of Egypt, excluding the deserts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12,830 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sq.M.anil </span>the<br/>
area <span style="color: #0000FF;">actually </span>under cultivation as 9460 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ssrM</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The alluvial soil of<br/>
the Nile Valley, in <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoutrailistinetion </span>to the desert, known among the<br/>
natives by the Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">word'Er-hut</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, begins at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttsrn</span>, at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">coniluenee </span>of the White and the Blue Nile. Following the wide curve<br/>
described by the Nile through Nubia, the length of the valley as<br/>
far as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>cataracts is <span style="color: #0000FF;">0801.</span>, but as the space between the<br/>
river and its rocky banks is very limited, and the irrigation system<br/>
is imperfectly developed, the cultivable area in this part of the<br/>
valley is only about <span style="color: #0000FF;">1050 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sq</span>. M. The Nubian portion of the alluvial<br/>
soil of the Nile is thus <span style="color: #ff0000;">very </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">insignitiisant</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and when the ancient<br/>
oracle described Egypt as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span>watered by the Nile, and the<br/>
Egyptians as the people who quenched their thirst with its water,<br/>
the river below the first cataract must obviously have been meant.<br/>
<br/>
Divisions and Administration. The ancient prehistoric Egyptians were at first subdivided into numerous tribes, who formed<br/>
a number of distinct small and independent states, with their<br/>
own laws and their peculiar tutelary gods. These states were<br/>
afterwards gradually united into the two large principalities of<br/>
Lower Egypt or the Northern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Country </span>(To Maw, 01' To <span style="color: #0000FF;">Melt</span>), and<br/>
Upper Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the Southern Country (To Res, or To <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fem</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At<br/>
a later period these two larger states, united under one <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sceptre</span>,<br/>
formed the empire <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Pharaohs, or the land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fend</span>. The<br/>
smaller states then constituted <span style="color: #0000FF;">provinces </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">nomes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">hesoph</span>;<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Greek </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nomoi</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The ancient Egyptians divided each <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>into four<br/>
principal parts<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>- <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cr</span>) The capital (Nut), the religious and administrative centre of the province; (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ly</span>) The cultivated land (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Um</span>,<br/>
subject to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>annual inundation; (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p</span>) The marshy land which remained in a moist condition after the inundation; (4) The district<br/>
traversed by canals conducted out of the Nile. The civil and military administration of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nome </span>was presided over either by hereditary governors (hilt), or by <span style="color: #ff0000;">nomarehs </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">mer-mat-Ot-to</span>) appointed<br/>
by the king. Under the Ptolemies these governors were called <span style="color: #ff0000;">stmtegoi </span>(nomu) <span style="color: #ff0000;">ortuamarehoi</span>, and over a group of these presided an <span style="color: #ff0000;">oistrategos</span>. The chief authority in religious matters was the high priest<br/>
of the temple, whose appointment was sometimes hereditary and<br/>
sometimes elective; and his staff consisted of a prophet, a <span style="color: #ff0000;">templescribe</span>, a stolistes <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>custodian of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">vestments</span>, and an astrologer.<br/>
<br/>
The number of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">names </span>varied at different periods. Most of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">classical </span>authors <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>thus Diodorus, liv. 3; Strabo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">xxviii</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>, 3)<br/>
enumerate thirty-six. The Egyptian lists, such as that of Edfu,<br/>
mention forty-four, half of them being in Upper and half in Lower<br/>
Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>but two of those in Upper Egypt and three in Lower Egypt<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">-are </span>counted twice)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The Greeks and Romans sometimes divided<br/>
Egypt into three parts - Upper, Central, and Lower Egypt, or the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebai</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heptanomis</span>, and Delta.<br/>
