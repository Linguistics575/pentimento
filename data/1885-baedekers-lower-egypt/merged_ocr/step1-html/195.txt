</span>identical. No attention whatever was paid to tastefulness in grouping or uniformity of arrangement, the separate scenes being merely<br/>
placed beside or over each other; but, individually, these are <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable </span>for distinctness and excellence of execution, and they<br/>
afford us a far more vivid picture of the life of the ancient Egyptians, their customs, their wars, and their religious rites, than<br/>
any written chronicle could have afforded. In artistic <span style="color: #0000FF;">finish</span>, on the<br/>
other hand, these scenes are defective, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>colouring has <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>independent value, being merely used to make the <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>stand<br/>
out more distinctly, and imitating nature in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">crudest </span>possible<br/>
manner.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the province of artistic conception we find Egyptian imagination fettered by traditional bonds which it made no effort to<br/>
break; but in the practice of the handicrafts Egypt was perfect.<br/>
The goldsmiths and workers in metal in particular had attained the<br/>
most complete mastery of their craft; they thoroughly understood<br/>
all its ancillary arts, such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">enamelling </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Damaseene </span>work, and<br/>
they were thus able to produce works of a degree of <span style="color: #0000FF;">finish </span>such as<br/>
a highly civilised nation alone could execute and appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller should note the <span style="color: #0000FF;">signifieation </span>of some of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">SarrnBOLS </span>and SIGNS most commonly used in the ornamentation of the<br/>
<br/>
columns and other parts of the Egyptian temples. Thus, is the<br/>
crook <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>shepherd's staff, the emblem of the leader or <span style="color: #0000FF;">monarch</span>;<br/>
a scourge, the symbol of kingly power. When both are in<br/>
the hand of the same figure they perhaps import the power of<br/>
restraining and of urging onwards. Then a <span style="color: #0000FF;">seal</span>, the symbol<br/>
of life; Nilometer, the symbol of steadfastness; <span style="color: #ff0000;">H </span>the red<br/>
