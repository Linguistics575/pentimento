<span style="color: #0000FF;">mosque </span>These bazaars are generally crowded with customers and<br/>
idlers, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford </span>the traveller an excellent opportunity of observing Oriental manners. In all the larger towns and villages<br/>
there are extensive <span style="color: #ff0000;">Klufns</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">dep6ts </span>of the goods of the wholesale<br/>
merchants, who however often sell by retail to strangers.<br/>
<br/>
The shop (<span style="color: #ff0000;">dukk0n</span>) is a recess, quite open to the street, and<br/>
generally about <span style="color: #0000FF;">lift</span>. in width, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>being on a level with the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">mnsiaba</span>, or seat in front, on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the owner smokes his pipe,<br/>
retails his goods, chats with his friends, and performs his devotions.<br/>
The inscriptions over many of the shops do not announce the name<br/>
or business of the occupant, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>consist of pious phrases, such as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Allah! thou who <span style="color: #ff0000;">openest </span>the gates of <span style="color: #ff0000;">profit </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Allah </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">then<br/>
</span>who <span style="color: #ff0000;">helpest </span>us in <span style="color: #0000FF;">want</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>"Aid from Allah, and rapid <span style="color: #ff0000;">victoxyl'<br/>
</span>These and similar ejaculations are invariably repeated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shopkeeper </span>as he takes down his shutters in the morning. When he<br/>
leaves the shop <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>either hangs a net in front of it, or begs <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">neighbour </span>to keep guard over it. The intending <span style="color: #0000FF;">purchaser </span>seats himself<br/>
on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mastaha</span>, and after the customary <span style="color: #0000FF;">salutations </span>proceeds to<br/>
mention his wishes. Unless the purchaser is prepared to pay whatever is asked, he will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>that the conclusion of a satisfactory<br/>
bargain involves a prodigious waste of time and patience.<br/>
<br/>
As a rule, a much higher price is demanded than will <span style="color: #ff0000;">nltimately </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>accepted, and bargaining is <span style="color: #0000FF;">therefore </span>the universal<br/>
custom<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the purchaser knows the proper price of the goods beforehand, he offers it to the seller, who will probably <span style="color: #ff0000;">remark'lcum'<br/>
</span>(it is little), but will nevertheless sell the goods. The seller sometimes entertains the purchaser with coffee from a neighbouring<br/>
coffee-shop in order to facilitate the progress of the negotiations.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>the shopkeeper persists in asking too high a price, the purchaser<br/>
withdraws, but is often called back and at last offered the article<br/>
at a reasonable price. A favourite expression with Oriental shopkeepers <span style="color: #0000FF;">is'Mudu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">buhiW </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Linkc </span>it for nothing), which is of course<br/>
no <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>meant to be taken literally than the well <span style="color: #0000FF;">known </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tttt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">bttak'<br/>
</span>(my house is thy house). When in the course of the bargaining the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">purehaser </span>increases his offer in order to make a concession, he<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">generally </span>uses the <span style="color: #0000FF;">expression'min </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shank</span>' (for thy <span style="color: #0000FF;">sake</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing raises <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>traveller so much in the estimation <span style="color: #ff0000;">of0rientals </span>as <span style="color: #ff0000;">firlnnoss </span>in resisting imposition; but even the most wary<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">experienced </span>must he prepared to pay somewhat higher prices<br/>
for everything than the natives themselves. The various prices<br/>
mentioned in the Handbook will give the traveller a fair <span style="color: #0000FF;">idea </span>of<br/>
what may <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>justly <span style="color: #0000FF;">demanded</span>, and will prove a safeguard against<br/>
any <span style="color: #0000FF;">serious </span>extortion.<br/>
