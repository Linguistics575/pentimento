<span>44 THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>disappointment, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">national </span>pride to <span style="color: #0000FF;">utter </span>humiliation. Their<br/>
conquerors <span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded </span>in maintaining their position, and though<br/>
apparently at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>inclined to moderation, were at length driven by<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">conduct </span>and the previous example of the Copts themselves to<br/>
persecute and oppress them to the uttermost.<br/>
<br/>
In spite, however, of all these disasters, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>numerous community<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copes </span>has always existed in Egypt, a fact which is mainly to <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">accounted </span>for by the remarkable tenacity and constancy of the<br/>
Egyptian character. Owing, however, to the continual oppression and contempt to which they have been subjected, the grave<br/>
disposition of the subjects of the Pharaohs has degenerated into<br/>
sullen gloom, and their industry into <span style="color: #0000FF;">cupidity</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">raneonr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">which<br/>
</span>they have so long cherished has embittered their <span style="color: #0000FF;">charm'ter</span>, while<br/>
the persecutions they have suffered have taught them to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>at one<br/>
time <span style="color: #ff0000;">eringing</span>, and at another arrogant and overbearing<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>They are<br/>
in very few respects superior to their Mohammedan <span style="color: #0000FF;">countrymen<br/>
</span>They generally possess an hereditary aptitude for mathematical<br/>
science, and are therefore in great request as book-keepers <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">accountants</span>, but on the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand </span>they are entirely destitute of the<br/>
generous and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dignified </span>disposition of the Arabs<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">They </span>obey their<br/>
law which <span style="color: #0000FF;">forbids </span>polygamy, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>constantly abuse that which permits them to indulge in spirituous liquors, drunkards being frequently met with, even among their <span style="color: #0000FF;">priests</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Their </span>divine worship<br/>
will strike the traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>strange, and anything but <span style="color: #ff0000;">erlifying </span>or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">elevating<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller </span>may distinguish the Copts from the Arabs by their<br/>
dark <span style="color: #ff0000;">tnrbans</span>, which are generally blue <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>black<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and their <span style="color: #ff0000;">darkanloured </span>clothes. This costume was originally prescribed by their<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Oppressors</span>, and they still take a pride in it as a mark of their origin,<br/>
though now permitted to dress as they please. A practised eye will<br/>
also frequently detect among them the ancient Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">cast </span>of<br/>
features<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Towards strangers the Copt is <span style="color: #0000FF;">externally </span>obliging, and<br/>
when anxious to secure their favour he not <span style="color: #ff0000;">1tnfrequently </span>appeals to<br/>
his Christian creed as a bond of union. Many <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts </span>have recently<br/>
been converted to Protestantism by American missionaries, particularly in Upper Egypt, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehief1y </span>through the foundation of good<br/>
schools and the distribution of cheap Arabic Bibles. Even the<br/>
orthodox Copts have a great reverence for the sacred volume, and it<br/>
is not <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncommon </span>to meet with members of their seet who know the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the gospels by heart. The Roman propaganda, which was<br/>
begun <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Franciscans </span>at the end of the 17th and beginning <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">le'yth </span>cent, has been less successful among the Copts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">there<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">exist </span>a few small <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roman </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Catholic </span>communities in Upper Egypt<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">only </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">atCrirgeir</span>, Akhmim, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ncgidi</span>). To the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llomanists</span>, however,<br/>
is partly due the preservation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span>language, into which<br/>
they <span style="color: #0000FF;">caused </span>the gospels to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>translated by the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">learned </span>scholars<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">day </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanied </span>by a preface asserting the <span style="color: #0000FF;">supremacy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
