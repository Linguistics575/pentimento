Higher up (comp. Plan, <span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">396</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>we observe scenes representing<br/>
the snaring of birds and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">catching </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish </span>in nets and baskets;<br/>
and we here read the <span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span>of the hieroglyphic inscriptions <span style="color: #ff0000;">-'Let<br/>

<br/>
To the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>towards the door, is a large and striking tableau,<br/>
representing <span style="color: #ff0000;">*hTi </span>engaged in hippopotamus hunting. He stands in<br/>
a light papyrus boat, leaning on a staff, and is more than double<br/>
the size of his attendants<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The hunting of crocodiles and hippopotami on the Nile formed a favourite pastime of the wealthy<br/>
Egyptians, and we find scenes of this kind recurring frequently,<br/>
especially in the burial chapels of the earliest period of the Egyptian monarchy. The bearing of Ti is <span style="color: #0000FF;">calm </span>and dignified, while<br/>
the captain of the vessel,'the chief over the people of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">birdpond </span>Atet', seems to be attending to the directions of his master<br/>
with a view to communicate them to the crew. In the foremost<br/>
vessel three of the men are engaged in securing two aquatic monsters <span style="color: #ff0000;">Munilering </span>in the water, one of which has been caught with<br/>
a kind of snare and is threatened with the spears of the hunters.<br/>
An allusion to this kind of hunting is said to be contained in the<br/>
following passage in the Book of Job <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cxli</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1,2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l </span>-'Canst thou draw<br/>
out leviathan with <span style="color: #ff0000;">an </span>hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lettest </span>down? Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw<br/>
through with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">thorn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">v.</span>' - The other hippopotamus which the men<br/>
are <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavouring </span>to secure has a small crocodile in its <span style="color: #ff0000;">mouth</span>. At<br/>
the stern of Ti's vessel is a smaller boat containing a boy, who is<br/>
about to strike on the head <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">silurus </span>which he has caught. The<br/>
other fish represented in the water are so faithfully drawn that the<br/>
species to which they belong are <span style="color: #0000FF;">easily </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">determined</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The three <span style="color: #0000FF;">beets<br/>
</span>are surrounded by papyrus plants, among <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>tops of which various<br/>
birds are sitting on their nests or <span style="color: #0000FF;">fluttering </span>about. A pair of kingfishers with their young, in a nest faithfully copied from nature,<br/>
