<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus</span>. These tablets have yielded most valuable information<br/>
as to the ancient Egyptian mode of reckoning time, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">particularly </span>regarding the later periods <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEgyptian </span>history, as they record<br/>
the days, months, and years of the king's reign on which the Apis<br/>
revered by the donor was <span style="color: #0000FF;">born</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">enthroned</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">interred </span>respectively.<br/>
We have thus been enabled to determine with <span style="color: #0000FF;">precision </span>the duration of the reigns of many of the Pharaohs and the order in which<br/>
they succeeded each other. Most of these relies are now preserved<br/>
in the Louvre. If the ceremonies which accompanied the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ohsequies<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Apis bulls were as <span style="color: #ff0000;">magnitieent </span>as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>were <span style="color: #0000FF;">costly</span>, Diodorus probably does not exaggerate when he informs us that<br/>
the chief priest of an Apis <span style="color: #0000FF;">bull </span>which died of old age shortly after<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">accession </span>of Ptolemy Lagi expended on its burial not only the<br/>
whole of a large sum then in the coffers <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the temple, but a farther sum of fifty talents of silver (about <span style="color: #ff0000;">11,7001</span>.) advanced by<br/>
the king. Diodorus also assures us that in his time the keeper of<br/>
Apis (whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Was </span>doubtless a very honourable one) spent <span style="color: #0000FF;">no<br/>
</span>less than a hundred talents on the obsequies of a bull.<br/>
<br/>
Passing through the gateway, we enter a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chamber </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">la</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>of<br/>
considerable dimensions, with niches of various sizes in the bare<br/>
limestone walls, where votive tablets of the kind mentioned above<br/>
were once <span style="color: #0000FF;">placed</span>. Visitors light their candles here. The guide<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>proceeds towards the right. After a few paces <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>observe at<br/>
our feet a huge block of black granite (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>), which once formed<br/>
the lid of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus </span>Beyond it we turn to the left, and after<br/>
ten paces reach an enormous granite sarcophagus <span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. d), which so<br/>
nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">fills </span>the passage that there is only just room to pass it on its<br/>
right side. The lid and the sarcophagus belong to each other, having doubtless been executed for the reception of one of the sacred<br/>
bulls, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>were probably stopped here on their way to the vault<br/>
for which they were destined, in consequence of the crisis in<br/>
Egypt's history which caused the overthrow of the worship <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Apis</span>.<br/>
Beyond this sarcophagus we continue to proceed towards the W.<br/>
between <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>walls <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>rock, and then turn to the left [ <span style="color: #ff0000;">8</span>.) into <span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span>passage destitute of ornament. This leads us to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Principal </span>Passage <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jn</span>. A, B), running parallel with the first, from E. to<br/>
w., and penetrating the solid <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock </span>This passage is <span style="color: #0000FF;">flanked </span>with<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-chambers</span>, about 26 ft. in height, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">contain </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>of the Apis bulls (see above), <span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span>consisting of<br/>
a single block of black or red polished granite or <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">limestone</span>. One<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>(P1. e), composed of black granite, and bearing the<br/>
best executed hieroglyphic inscriptions on its polished exterior,<br/>
may be entered by means of a ladder. After having traversed the<br/>
whole of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>part of the main gallery and returned to the point<br/>
at which we entered it, we next visit the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span>part of the gallery,<br/>
where we observe several <span style="color: #0000FF;">mute </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi</span>. We then reach a <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">passage </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P1</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>diverging to the right, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>another passage<br/>
