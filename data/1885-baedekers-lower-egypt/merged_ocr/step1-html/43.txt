to enjoy perfect repose for a short time. This interval of tranquil<br/>
enjoyment is the favourite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oriental'kilt</span>" (i. <span style="color: #ff0000;">e. </span>luxurious <span style="color: #0000FF;">idleness</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Every <span style="color: #ff0000;">bath </span>contains a coffee and pipe establishment. Coffee and<br/>
hot <span style="color: #0000FF;">eau </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sucr√©e </span>are the favourite beverages. Before dressing, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bather </span>is generally provided with two or three more relays of fresh<br/>
towels, and thus the proceedings terminate<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The whole of these<br/>
operations need not occupy much more than an hour, but Orientals<br/>
often devote a whole morning to the bath<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>- Many of the baths<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">charitable </span>foundations, where the natives pay little or nothing.<br/>
Europeans are generally expected to pay 8 piastres or more (including coffee and nargileh), and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fee of about 1 <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>is given to the<br/>
'soap man'. - A <span style="color: #ff0000;">Turkishbath </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">partieularlyrefreshiug </span>after <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>long<br/>

'The women who can afford to <span style="color: #0000FF;">do </span>so visit the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hammam </span>frequently;<br/>
hut not so <span style="color: #0000FF;">often </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>the men. When the bath is not hired for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">te</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>males of one family, or for <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>party of ladies exclusively<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>women of all<br/>
conditions are admitted. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>general all the females of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">house</span>, and the<br/>
young boys, <span style="color: #0000FF;">go </span>together. They take with them their own <span style="color: #ff0000;">seggiidehs</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>the napkins, basins, etc., which they require, and even the necessary<br/>
quantity of sweet water for washing with <span style="color: #0000FF;">soap</span>, and for drinking; and<br/>
some carry with them fruits, sweetmeats, and other refreshments. A lady<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wealth </span>is also often <span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanied </span>by her own <span style="color: #ff0000;">betrdaeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">er </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mash'kxh</span>,<br/>
who is the washer and tire-woman. Many women of the lower orders<br/>
wear no covering whatever in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hath</span>, not even a napkin round the<br/>
waist; others always wear the napkin and the high <span style="color: #0000FF;">clogs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>There <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>few pleasures in which the women of Egypt delight so much as in the<br/>
visit to the bath, where they <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>entertainments; and often,<br/>
on these occasions, they are not <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little noisy in their mirth. They avail<br/>
themselves of the opportunity to display their jewels and their <span style="color: #ff0000;">flnest<br/>
</span>clothes, and to enter into familiar <span style="color: #0000FF;">conversation </span>with those whom they<br/>
meet there, whether friends or strangers. Sometimes a mother chooses<br/>
a bride <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>her <span style="color: #ff0000;">son </span>from among the girls or <span style="color: #ff0000;">women </span>whom she chances<br/>
to see in the bath. On many occasions<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>as. for instance, in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of<br/>
preparations for a marriage, the bath is hired for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>select party, consisting of the women of two or more families, and none else are admitted<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>but it is more common for a lady and a few friends to hire <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>

There is more <span style="color: #0000FF;">confusion </span>among <span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span>mixed company of various ranks; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span>where all are friends, the younger girls indulge in more mirth and<br/>
frolic. They spend an hour or more under the hands of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bellaineh</span>,<br/>
who <span style="color: #0000FF;">rubs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>washes them<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>plaits their hair, applies the <span style="color: #0000FF;">depilatory</span>,<br/>
etc. They then retire to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">beyt-owwal </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0r </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">meslakh</span>, and there, having<br/>
put on part of their dress, or a large loose <span style="color: #0000FF;">shirt</span>, partake of various refreshments, which, <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>they have brought none with them, they may <span style="color: #0000FF;">procure </span>by sending an attendant of the bath to the market. Those who<br/>
smoke take their own pipes with them. On particular <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasions </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">fes</span>,<br/>
tivity, they are entertained with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">songs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">two </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">more'AI'mehs</span>, hired<br/>
