<br/>
</span>been so raised with deposits of the sand of the desert that the tomb<br/>
rather resembles a subterranean <span style="color: #ff0000;">roek-strueture </span>than a building on<br/>
the surface of the earth. Very little of the exterior is therefore<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">uew </span>visible, but the interior, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">completely </span>excavated, is executed with the utmost care, and the sculptures on the<br/>
walls exhibit a skill Which is truly marvellous when it is remembered that the mausoleum was erected in the 5th Dynasty, in the<br/>
time of the builders of the pyramids <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Abusir, that is, <span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span>4500<br/>
years ago. Both the paintings and the hieroglyphics which cover<br/>
the walls are executed in remarkably delicate and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>bas-relief,<br/>
the outlines <span style="color: #0000FF;">being </span>sharp and distinct, while the projecting parts<br/>
are at the same time subdued and harmonious. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">hieratie<br/>
</span>canon (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">161</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>has already imparted to the human <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>a somewhat conventional type, notwithstanding their spirited action, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span>there is a refreshing fidelity to nature in the attempts of the artists to represent animals. The painting of the figures is preserved<br/>
at places. Each of the larger scenes is presided over by the commanding <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of Ti himself, the proprietor of the tomb, who is<br/>
easily distinguishable by his <span style="color: #ff0000;">loftier </span>stature. He wears a wig with<br/>
the usual <span style="color: #0000FF;">looks</span>, and his features were doubtless <span style="color: #0000FF;">copied </span>from life,<br/>
as <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>proved by their resemblance to those of his statue now preserved at <span style="color: #0000FF;">13131515 </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">306</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. In some cases his chin is prolonged by<br/>
a small false beard. Around his <span style="color: #0000FF;">loins </span>he wears a kind of apron,<br/>
carefully folded, and pointed in front, and from his neck hangs a<br/>
broad necklace. With one hand he leans on a long staff, and in the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:5<br/>
</span>other he holds his baton of <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftiee</span>. Ti <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>, as the<br/>
<br/>
inscriptions in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chamber </span>inform us (p. 396), was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dignitary </span>of the highest rank in the service of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra-nefer-ar-ka</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ra-euuser</span>, and Kaka, monarchs of the 5th Dynasty<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>He was <span style="color: #ff0000;">a'semer'<br/>
</span>(companion, adjutant, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chamberlain</span>) of the king,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'enthroned </span>in<br/>
the heart of his lord', a'master of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">secrets</span>' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">privy </span>counsellor),<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'loving </span>his sovereign', a'president of the gate of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">palace</span>', a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'seeret </span>counsellor of the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>all his royal assemblies', <span style="color: #ff0000;">a'seeret<br/>
</span>counsellor for the execution of the commands of the king', and a<br/>
'president of all the royal works and the royal department of writing'. He also held a high <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacerdotal </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">offiee </span>at the pyramids of Abusir <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>370), and he is elsewhere called one of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>chiefs of the<br/>
prophets, a president of the sacrifices and <span style="color: #0000FF;">puritieations</span>, and a<br/>
guardian of the mystery of the divine speech. His wife Neferhotep-s, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>is frequently represented by his side, was a member<br/>
of the royal family, but he <span style="color: #ff0000;">himselfwas </span>a man <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofhumble </span>parentage,<br/>
who had risen to <span style="color: #0000FF;">distinction </span>by his merit. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sons </span>Ti and Tamut<br/>
[ <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tamuz</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>enjoyed the title of <span style="color: #0000FF;">princes </span>in consequence of the high<br/>
rank of their mother. Like other Egyptian ladies of distinction, the<br/>
wife of Ti is termed the'beloved of her husband', the'mistress of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">house</span>', and the'palm of <span style="color: #0000FF;">amiability </span>towards her <span style="color: #0000FF;">husband</span>'.<br/>
