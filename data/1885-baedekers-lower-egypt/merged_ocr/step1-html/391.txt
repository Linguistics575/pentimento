<br/>
Now the construction <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Pyramid occupied twenty years <span style="color: #ff0000;">f. </span>Each<br/>
of the sides, which face the different points of the compass, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for<br/>
</span>there are four sides, measures eight plethra (820 ft.), and the height<br/>
is the same. It is covered with polished stones, well jointed, none<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>less than thirty feet long.'<br/>
<br/>
'This pyramid was first built in the form <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>flight of <span style="color: #0000FF;">steps</span>.<br/>
After the workmen had completed the pyramid in this form, they<br/>
raised the other stones <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">used </span>for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">inerustation</span>) by means of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">machines</span>, made of short beams, from the ground to the first tier<br/>
of steps; and after the stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>placed there it was raised to the<br/>
second tier by another machine; for there were as many machines<br/>
as there were tiers of steps; or perhaps the same machine, <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>easily moved, was raised from one tier to the other, as it was required for lifting the stones. The highest part of the pyramid was<br/>
thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>first, the parts adjoining it were taken next, and the<br/>
lowest part, next to the earth, was completed <span style="color: #ff0000;">lastff</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It was<br/>
recorded on the pyramid<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>in Egyptian writing, how many <span style="color: #0000FF;">radishes</span>,<br/>
onions, and roots of garlic had been distributed among the workmen,<br/>
and if I rightly remember <span style="color: #0000FF;">what </span>the interpreter (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>"13) who read<br/>
the writing told <span style="color: #0000FF;">met </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">f</span>, the money they cost amounted to sixteen<br/>
hundred talents <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">silver </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>upwards <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">350,000C</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. If this was really<br/>
the case, how much <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>must then have been spent on the iron<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>which they worked<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the food and clothing of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">workmen</span>, seeing that they worked for the time already mentioned,<br/>
and I believe that no shorter time could have been occupied with<br/>
quarrying and transporting the stones, and with the work and the<br/>
excavations under the surface of the earth.'<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Cheops </span>is said to have reigned <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">years </span>in Egypt, and to have<br/>
been succeeded in the kingdom by his brother Chephren. who acted<br/>
exactly in the same manner as his brother<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and who also erected a<br/>
pyramid, which, however, is not of so great dimensions (for we<br/>
measured this one <span style="color: #0000FF;">also </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>. This pyramid does not contain subterranean chambers, nor is a channel conducted to it from the Nile<br/>
(comp. p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">3560</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chephren </span>constructed the foundations of coloured<br/>
Ethiopian stone (granite of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assnan</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, but the pyramid was forty<br/>
feet lower than the other, <span style="color: #0000FF;">heat </span>which he erected it; for both <span style="color: #0000FF;">stand<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">quite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">clear </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">whether </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Herodotus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">means </span>that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">100,000<br/>
</span>men were <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupied </span>20 or 30 years in building the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pyramid </span>of Cheops,<br/>
as he <span style="color: #0000FF;">does </span>not say whether it was the building above the subterranean<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers</span>. or the whole of the structure, that <span style="color: #0000FF;">took </span>twenty years.<br/>
<br/>
"This account of the mode in which the pyramid was constructed<br/>
has been entirely <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmed </span>by modern investigations (<span style="color: #0000FF;">cump</span>. p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">3301.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ttt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>inscriptions, now <span style="color: #0000FF;">destroyed</span>, really <span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>existed <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the outside<br/>
of the pyramid, they <span style="color: #0000FF;">doubtless </span>contained much more important <span style="color: #0000FF;">information </span>than that which the interpreter professed to read<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It <span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>moreover, unlikely that the interpreters, who attended <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller </span>like <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dragomans </span>of the present day, were <span style="color: #0000FF;">able </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">read </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>They<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span>repeated <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>popular <span style="color: #0000FF;">traditions </span>regarding the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pyramids </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>other <span style="color: #0000FF;">monuments</span>, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">embellishments </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">exaggerations </span>of their own<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
