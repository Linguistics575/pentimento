</span>natural origin. The name signifies'rehearsal', <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'reading</span>', and<br/>
the book is divided into parts called <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rchs</span>. The first revelation<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">vouchsafed </span>to the Prophet took place in the'blessed night' in the<br/>
year <span style="color: #ff0000;">609</span>. With many interruptions, the'sending down' of the<br/>
Koran extended over <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-three </span>years, until the whole <span style="color: #0000FF;">book</span>,<br/>
which had already existed on'well-preserved tables' in heaven,<br/>
was in the prophet's possession. During the time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Abbaside<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">khalifs </span>it was <span style="color: #ff0000;">amatter </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">keenest </span>controversy whether the Koran<br/>
was created or <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncreated</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>The Oriental Christians have likewise<br/>
always manifested a great taste for subtle dogmatic questions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">such<br/>
</span>as the Procession of the Holy Ghost) The earlier, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mecean </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">S1lrehs</span>,<br/>
which on account of their brevity are placed at the end ofthe book,<br/>
are <span style="color: #ff0000;">eharaeterisedby </span>great freshness and vigour of style. They are in<br/>
rhyme, but only <span style="color: #ff0000;">partially </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">poetie </span>in form. In the longer <span style="color: #0000FF;">S1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rehs </span>ofa<br/>
later period the style is more studied and the narrative often<br/>
tedious. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>is nevertheless regarded as the greatest masterpiece <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofArabie </span>literature. The prayers <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>Muslims consist almost<br/>
exclusively of passages from this work, although they are entirely<br/>
ignorant of its real meaning<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Even by the early commentators<br/>
much of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Igoran </span>was imperfectly understood, for Mohammed,<br/>
although extremely proud of <span style="color: #0000FF;">his'Arabic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Book</span>', was very partial<br/>
to the use of all kinds of foreign words. The translation of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Koran </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">beingprohibited</span>, Persian, Turkish, and Indian children learn<br/>
it entirely by rote.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>has been translated into English, French, German<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Italian,<br/>
and Latin. The best English <span style="color: #0000FF;">translations </span>are those of Sale (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1734</span>; with<br/>
a'preliminary discourse' and copious notes; published in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>cheap form<br/>

resurrection has been grossly corrupted by the Koran and by subsequent tradition; but its main features have doubtless been borrowed from the Christians, as has also the appearance of Antichrist,<br/>
and the part to be played by Christ at the Last Day. On that day<br/>
Christ <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">establish </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam </span>as the religion of the world. With<br/>

every <span style="color: #0000FF;">living </span>being; a second will awaken the dead. Then follows<br/>
the Judgment; the righteous cross to Paradise by a bridge of a<br/>
hair's breadth, while the wicked fall from the bridge into the abyss<br/>
of hell. Some Muslims believe in a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">limbo</span>, like that of the<br/>
Hebrews and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greeks</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>while others maintain that the souls of the<br/>
dead proceed directly to the gates of Paradise. At the Judgment<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">every </span>man is judged according to the books of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">recording </span>angels<br/>
(p. 142). The good have the book placed in their right hands,<br/>
