<br/>
treasury and a selection of comparatively uninteresting modern<br/>
MSS. in a room adjoining the <span style="color: #ff0000;">arehbishop</span>'s house. Implicit belief<br/>
should not be <span style="color: #0000FF;">vouchsafed </span>to all that the monks have to say about<br/>
the MSS. in the treasury. Thus, some loose pages of a Greek<br/>
Bible <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they show do not belong, as they assert, to the Codex<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sinaiticus</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Evangelium </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Theodosianum</span>, a collection of<br/>
passages from the New Testament, is described without any ground<br/>
whatever as a gift of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Plum</span>. Theodosius (766 <span style="color: #0000FF;">An</span>), and in<br/>
all likelihood does <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>date farther back than 1000 AD. It is written on <span style="color: #0000FF;">white </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">parchment</span>, both sides of each sheet having two columns<br/>
in golden characters. A kind of <span style="color: #ff0000;">frontispieee </span>is formed by a series<br/>
of elaborate miniatures of Jesus, Mary, the four <span style="color: #0000FF;">Evangelists</span>, and<br/>
St. Peter. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psalterianum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cassianum</span>, containing the whole<br/>
of the Psalms written in microscopical characters <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>six leaves, was<br/>
not executed by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">nun </span>of the 9th cent., named Cassia, but is a<br/>
piece of laborious <span style="color: #0000FF;">trifling </span>dating from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>period of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Renaissance</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>In <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Small </span>Library' is a copy of the famous Codex<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sinaiticus</span>, discovered by Prof. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tischendorf</span>, printed most carefully<br/>
from the original, and presented by the Emperor of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Russia</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sew<br/>
</span>eral leaves of the precious MS. are preserved at the university of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Leipsie</span>, under the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Codex </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Friderico-Augustanus</span>', but<br/>
the greater part of it is at St. Petersburg, having been purchased<br/>
from the monastery by Alexander <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>for a large sum. The codex<br/>
contains a complete copy of the New Testament, most of the books<br/>
of the Old Testament, a part of the'Shepherd of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilermas</span>', and the<br/>
'Epistle of St. Barnabas'. The great value of the Codex Sinaiticus<br/>
is due to its completeness, the care with which it is written, the<br/>
consistency of the peculiarities of its text, and, above all, its great<br/>
antiquity. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is pretty well ascertained to date from about <span style="color: #0000FF;">400 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A.D.</span>,<br/>
and is surpassed by the celebrated Codex <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vaticanus </span>alone in age<br/>
and in importance in determining the Biblical text.<br/>
<br/>
On the N. side of the monastery is the Burial Place of the<br/>
monks, reached by several dark passages, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">consisting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a strongly<br/>
vaulted crypt. The remains of the bishops are preserved in <span style="color: #ff0000;">eoffins</span>,<br/>
and those of the priests in a separate <span style="color: #0000FF;">part </span>of the vault, while the<br/>
bones and skulls of the monks are merely piled up together. The<br/>
skeletons of several highly revered hermits are suspended from the<br/>
wall. At the gate of the priests' vault is placed the skeleton of<br/>
St. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stephanos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cd</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">580</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, wearing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">skull-cap </span>of violet velvet. Not<br/>
far <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>this vault is a well, and beyond it is the rarely used <span style="color: #ff0000;">burialground </span>for pilgrims who have <span style="color: #0000FF;">died </span>here.<br/>
<br/>
A flight of steps descends from this court to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Garden</span>, the<br/>
trees of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>blossom most luxuriantly in March and April,<br/>
presenting a grateful sight in the midst of this rocky wilderness.<br/>
It is laid out in the form of terraces, and contains <span style="color: #ff0000;">peaeh-trees</span>,<br/>
orange-trees, vines, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete.</span>, overshadowed by some lofty <span style="color: #0000FF;">cypresses</span>.<br/>
