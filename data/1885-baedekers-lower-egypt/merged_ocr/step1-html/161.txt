</span>relation to human affairs. He is the'destroyer of enemies<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>, he aids<br/>
mankind in the battle of life, and he heals the sick. To his head<br/>
the moon is attached by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">infantine </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lock</span>. From his wanderings <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
</span>the god of the moon, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the vigour with which he destroyed<br/>
evil spirits, he was identified with Heracles by the Greeks.<br/>
<br/>
Doctrine of Immortality. From the account of the worship of<br/>
Isis and Osiris it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">obvious </span>that the Egyptians believed in the immortality of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">soul </span>(whence <span style="color: #0000FF;">arose </span>the prevalent worship of<br/>
ancestors ], in amoral <span style="color: #0000FF;">responsibility</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">inafuture </span>state <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofrewards<br/>
</span>and punishments. The doctrine with regard to the life of the soul<br/>
after death was not, however, at all times and in all places the<br/>
same. <span style="color: #0000FF;">According </span>to the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">belief</span>, every human <span style="color: #0000FF;">being </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">consisted </span>of three distinct parts, which during the period of life were<br/>
closely united: (1) the body, a portion of matter; <span style="color: #0000FF;">C</span>'<span style="color: #ff0000;">?</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the'shi</span>,<br/>
or soul, which belonged to the nether world and ultimately returned thither; and (3) <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Um</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>emanation of the divine<br/>
intelligence. Each of these elements could be separated from<br/>
the others, but whatever changes it underwent, it was immutable<br/>
in quantity and quality. As the god of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun </span>is always the<br/>
same and yet hourly different, being at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>Horus, then <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">next<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tum</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnum</span>, so it was with the soul and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">intelligeuee </span>which fills and illuminates it, and which, as soon as<br/>
the gates of the tomb are opened for its reception, speaks and acts<br/>
for it. Once within the gates of Amenthes, the soul had to undergo<br/>
many trials. Ferocious beasts had to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">conquered</span>, demons to be<br/>
subdued, and castles to be stormed, and all this was to be done<br/>
with the aid of texts and hymns written <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>papyrus and <span style="color: #ff0000;">searabaei</span>,<br/>
ut'a eyes, and other amulets swathed in the bandage of the mummy.<br/>
At length the soul reached the hall of double justice, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>the<br/>
heart in its vase <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Q </span>was placed in one scale and the goddess of<br/>
truth in the other. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">aeynoeephalus </span>conducted the process<br/>
of weighing, Anubis superintended, Thoth recorded the result, and<br/>
Osiris with forty-two counsellors pronounced sentence. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ifthe </span>heart<br/>
was found too light, the soul was condemned <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>suffer the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tormeuts<br/>
</span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hell</span>, or to continue its existence in the bodies of animals, within<br/>
a certain period after <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>it returned to its original body <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">begin<br/>
</span>life anew, and had <span style="color: #0000FF;">afterwards </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>undergo another trial by the judges<br/>
of Hades. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ifthe </span>heart was found <span style="color: #ff0000;">suffieiently </span>heavy, Osiris restored<br/>
it to the soul; the'sahu' might then return to its mummy; its<br/>
intelligence, after a period of <span style="color: #0000FF;">purification </span>in the regions of the<br/>
blessed, might unite with the divinity from which it had emanated,<br/>
and, merged in Horus, Osiris, <span style="color: #0000FF;">etm</span>, might traverse the heavens in<br/>
the boat of the sun, or walk anew among the living in any form it<br/>
pleased. Finally both <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'sahu</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span>the intelligence were reunited to the dead body they had quitted, which its mummifieation<br/>
had preserved from decay, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>awaited the return of the soul<br/>
from Amenthes or from its sojourn in the bodies of animals.<br/>
