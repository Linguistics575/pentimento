Under the Ptolemies the canal system was extended. While one<br/>
arm led from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phakusa </span>on the Nile to the lakes towards the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pelnsium</span>, that is, direct to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mediterranean </span>through the connected<br/>
lakes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Balah </span>and Menzaleh, another branch was now constructed<br/>
from Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Balah </span>to the Bitter Lakes, into <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the fresh-water<br/>
canal watering the scriptural land of Goshen also fell <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>409). It<br/>
was thus feasible in the time of the Ptolemies to travel by water<br/>
from the Nile to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>part and also to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>part ofa <span style="color: #0000FF;">canal</span>,<br/>
which, like the modern Suez Canal, <span style="color: #0000FF;">connected </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span>Sea and the<br/>
Mediterranean in a nearly direct line. When Antony returned to<br/>
Egypt after the battle <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Aetium </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">B. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">O</span>. 31, Cleopatra made an<br/>
unsuccessful attempt to convey her ships across the Isthmus of Suez<br/>
in order to escape with her treasures from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Octavian</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>As, however,<br/>
it is very improbable that she would have attempted <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>transport<br/>
vessels of considerable size for so long a distance by land, there<br/>
can be little doubt that the canal still existed in her time, although<br/>
in a dilapidated and <span style="color: #0000FF;">unserviceable </span>condition<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The canal is said to have been restored during the Roman<br/>
period. Another <span style="color: #0000FF;">canal</span>, beginning near Cairo, and terminating in the<br/>
Gulf of Suez, the precise course of which, probably following the<br/>
earlier channel, is nowhere described, is said to have been called<br/>
the Amnis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Trajanus</span>, and was probably constructed during the<br/>
reign of that emperor (<span style="color: #0000FF;">NO</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">08-l171</span>. A canal of Hadrian is also<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mentioned</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>It is certain, however, that the chief mercantile route<br/>
between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lied </span>Sea and Italy did not follow the Nile and the canal thence to the Gulf of Suez. The Indian vessels of the Romans<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">touched </span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">llerenike</span>, a little to the N. of the tropic of Cancer, and<br/>
still more frequently at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Leukos </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Linlen</span>, the modern <span style="color: #ff0000;">liosyir</span>, or at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Myos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hermes </span>in the latitude <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sift</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Lykopolis</span>) on the Red Sea.<br/>
From these two last-named seaports, which were much frequented,<br/>
especially in the month of September, goods were conveyed by the<br/>
great <span style="color: #0000FF;">caravan-route </span>to Koptos on the Nile (near the <span style="color: #0000FF;">modem </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Keneh</span>),<br/>
and were then transferred to boats which carried them down the<br/>
Nile to Alexandria, where they were shipped for their ultimate<br/>
destination. After the Arabs had conquered Egypt, they must have<br/>
been desirous of connecting the Lower Egyptian part of the Nile<br/>
as directly as possible with the Red Sea.'Amr ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'As.si </span>(p. 101)<br/>
accordingly restored the ancient canal <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cor </span>which the Khalig at Cairo<br/>
is said to be a portion), and used it for the transport of grain from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fostiit </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">5241</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kolznm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Suez</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">whence </span>it was exported by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span>Sea to Arabia. The bed of the ancient canal is said to have<br/>
been pointed out <span style="color: #ff0000;">to'Amr </span>by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Copt</span>, to whom a remission of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">poll-tax </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>granted as a reward. The canal is said to have been<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tilled </span>up by the morbidly suspicious Khalif <span style="color: #0000FF;">Al-Maru</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ihn </span>Mohammed (<span style="color: #0000FF;">754-775</span>), in order to <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>off the supplies of the army of<br/>
