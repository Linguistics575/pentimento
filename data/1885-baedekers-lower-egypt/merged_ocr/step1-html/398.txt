<br/>
In order to remove the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bodies </span>of the dead from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">influem3e </span>of the<br/>
inundation of the Nile, they were buried in the dry rocky soil of<br/>
the desert. Wealthy persons caused <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chambers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>379) to be<br/>
excavated for themselves, while the kings, who wished to maintain<br/>
their royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">pre-eminence </span>even in death, were specially anxious to<br/>
ensure the <span style="color: #0000FF;">durability </span>and permanence of their tombs. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">burialplace </span>of a king was worthy, in their opinion, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">being </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">distinguished<br/>
</span>by its situation and its magnitude; they desired that it should <span style="color: #0000FF;">surpass </span>all others in <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificence</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tomb-ehamber </span>should<br/>
be least capable of violation<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It was probably, therefore, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">customary </span>to cover the <span style="color: #ff0000;">roek-tomb </span>of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span>with blocks of stone, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>to raise a mound over it, if sand and earth were <span style="color: #0000FF;">procurable </span>in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">vicinity</span>. The violent winds from the desert, however, rendered it<br/>
necessary to consolidate these <span style="color: #0000FF;">mounds </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>covering them with stones.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">sepulehral </span>mounds <span style="color: #0000FF;">thus </span>acquired a definite form; they became<br/>
square structures, tapering upwards, and gradually assumed the<br/>
pyramidal shape, ensuring the utmost strength and durability.<br/>
Opening <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Pyramids. The Pyramids are said first to have<br/>
been opened by the Persians (<span style="color: #0000FF;">BU</span>. 525-333), and it is certain that<br/>
they were examined by the Romans. The Arabs <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to<br/>
penetrate into the interior of these stupendous structures, "<span style="color: #ff0000;">hiefly<br/>
</span>in hope of finding treasures; and the greater the <span style="color: #ff0000;">i1iffleulties </span>they<br/>
encountered, the more precious and worthy of concealment did<br/>
they imagine the contents to be. According <span style="color: #0000FF;">to'Abdellatif</span>, it<br/>
was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rhalif </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mimirn </span>(A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">813-33</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>son of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hart1n </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er-liashid<br/>
</span>(p. 101), who caused the Great Pyramid to be opened; but it is<br/>
probable that that prince merely continued the investigations <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofhis<br/>
</span>predecessors, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>Dionysius, the Jacobite patriarch of Antioch, who<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanied </span>him, found that an entrance had <span style="color: #ff0000;">alreadyheen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">effectedt<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1lirnCm</span>'s workmen are said to have made a new entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">357</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
</span>adjacent to the old, with the aid of fire, vinegar, and projectiles.<br/>
With regard to the success of the undertaking there exist various<br/>
more or less highly embellished accounts by the Arabian historians<span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>but one thing appears certain, that the hopes of the explorers <span style="color: #0000FF;">were<br/>
</span>disappointed, and that nothing was found in the already plundered<br/>
chambers and corridors. According to some accounts, the gold found<br/>
here was exactly enough to defray the cost of the undertaking,<br/>
having possibly been introduced into the interior by the Khalif<br/>
himself, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">order </span>to obviate the reproach of having spent <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>much<br/>
money for nothing. Many of the Arabs relate, that, after the<br/>
workmen had penetrated to a considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">depth</span>, they found a<br/>
vessel containing a considerable sum of gold <span style="color: #0000FF;">coin</span>, amounting,<br/>
strangely enough, to the exact sum which had been spent on tho<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">investigation</span>. Along with the treasure was <span style="color: #0000FF;">found </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>marble slab,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">bearing </span>an old inscription to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eifeet </span>that the money beside it<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">summed </span>to pay for the work of the inquisitive king; but that, <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span>he<br/>
attempted to penetrate farther, he would expend a large sum and<br/>
