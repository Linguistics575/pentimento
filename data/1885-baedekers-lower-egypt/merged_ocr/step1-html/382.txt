<br/>
valley towards the E., into which the E. spurs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam<br/>
</span>descend. Near a shallow quarry, in the middle of the valley, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">well-defined </span>desert track turns towards the S. After a ride of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">1/4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hr.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>which an isolated hill of red and black sandstone<br/>
resembling <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ted </span>Mountain<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>is visible in the desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>our left,<br/>
we cross a deep, dry water-course<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The path divides here. That to<br/>
the right leads to Moses' Spring and the Little Petrified Forest (see<br/>
below), while that to the left is the route to the Great Petrified<br/>
Forest and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bit </span>el-Fahmeh (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">340</span>).<br/>
<br/>
Following the path to the right, we observe a yellowish hill at<br/>
the foot of the spurs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">tho </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohattam</span>, and reach it in 1/4 hr. more.<br/>
This hill stands at the mouth of the narrow, winding valley, 11/4 M.<br/>
in length, through which the path to Moses' Spring ascends over<br/>
large blocks of stone and rubble. The ravine terminates in a<br/>
lofty amphitheatre of rock, which affords welcome shade. Near<br/>
it stands a fig-tree, which the quarrymen have enclosed with a wall<br/>
to protect it from the wind. In the higher angle of the valley to<br/>
the right is the cleft in the rock from which issues <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'spring </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Noses</span>', arbitrarily so named. The chief attraction of the gorge <span style="color: #0000FF;">consists </span>in the numerous desert plants and the fossils it contains.<br/>
<br/>
In order to reach the smaller Petrified Forest, we return to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">mouth </span>of the gorge at the foot of the hill above mentioned, turn to<br/>
the right, and proceed towards the s., skirting the slopes of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam</span>, which are here more precipitous. We then cross a black<br/>
projecting rock, which has a glazed appearance, and pass through<br/>
a square gap in the rock, beyond which we observe opposite to us<br/>
gently sloping hills, consisting of limestone, marl, and beds of<br/>
fossil oysters. The route ascends, a little to the right, between<br/>
these hills, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">soon </span>reaches the plateau of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Grebe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khashab</span>,<br/>
where the scattered fragments of fossil wood indicate the beginning<br/>
of the Little Petrified Forest. The farther S. we proceed across this<br/>
plateau, the more numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">do </span>the fossil trunks become; but they<br/>
are inferior in length and thickness to <span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>the Bir <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Fahmeh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>340). Almost all these trunks and fragments have been <span style="color: #ff0000;">aseertained </span>by Unger to belong to the same tree, which he has named<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nicolia </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">2Egyptiaea</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>examining the grain microscopically,<br/>
he found that it did not belong to the palm family, but was more<br/>
akin to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eotton-plant</span>. The trunks show traces of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ramifieation</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>do not now possess either roots or <span style="color: #0000FF;">boughs</span>. Whether the trees<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>grew here, or were <span style="color: #0000FF;">floated </span>hither by water, became embedded in<br/>
the sand, and afterwards converted into stone, is still a matter of<br/>
controversy. Fraas [ see below) is of opinion that the formation resembles that of brown coal of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">meioccnc </span>period, but that the<br/>
trunks, instead of becoming <span style="color: #ff0000;">oarlooniseil</span>, were converted into <span style="color: #0000FF;">flint<br/>
</span>owing to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>abundant presence of silica in the sandstone and <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>the peculiarity of the climate, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>appears to <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>been much<br/>
the same at that remote period as at the present day.<br/>
