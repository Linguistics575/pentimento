His description of the Pyramids is borrowed without remark<br/>
from other authors. Thus he does not hesitate to repeat that <span style="color: #0000FF;">embankments </span>for the raising of the stones were made of <span style="color: #0000FF;">saltpetre</span>,<br/>
which was afterwards washed away, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>bricks, which on the<br/>
completion of the pyramid were distributed among private persons.<br/>
He also mentions <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhodopis</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">JUasYuli</span>, one of the Arabian Historians, says that the Pyramids<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>built three hundred years before the flood by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Starid</span>, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">consequence </span>of the interpretation of a dream which predicted the deluge.<br/>
Having assured himself that the world would be repeopled after the<br/>
flood, he caused the Pyramids to be erected, the prophecy to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>inscribed on their stones, and his treasures, the bodies of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancestors</span>, and records of the whole store of knowledge possessed by<br/>
his priests to be deposited in their chambers and recesses, in order<br/>
that they might be preserved for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefit </span>of those who should<br/>
come after the flood. According to a Coptic legend, he caused the<br/>
following inscription to be engraved on one of the Pyramids: 'l, King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siirid</span>, have built these Pyramids and completed them in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">81 </span>years<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Let him who comes after me, and imagines he is a king<br/>
to compare with me, attempt to destroy them in <span style="color: #ff0000;">600 </span>(years)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It is<br/>
easier to destroy than to <span style="color: #0000FF;">erect</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">J </span>have covered them with silk; let<br/>
him dare to attempt to cover them with <span style="color: #0000FF;">mate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>' A tradition recorded<br/>
by the same author resembles the German myth of the nymph of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lorelei </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>-'On the western Pyramid is <span style="color: #0000FF;">enthroned </span>a beautiful<br/>
naked woman with dazzling teeth, who allures desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">wayfarers<br/>
</span>from the south and west, embraces them in her arms, and deprives<br/>
them of reason'.<br/>
<br/>
'Fair <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhodope</span>, as story tells,<br/>
<br/>
The bright unearthly nymph, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">dwells<br/>
<br/>
</span>'Mid <span style="color: #0000FF;">sunless </span>gold and jewels hid,<br/>
<br/>
The lady of the Pyramid'. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Moon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span>)<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">According </span>to other myths the spirit of the Pyramid bears the<br/>
form of a boy, or that of a man, who hovers around it burning<br/>
incense.<br/>
<br/>
The Pyramids have been frequently <span style="color: #ff0000;">Visited </span>and described by<br/>
Christian travellers to Palestine <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>their way through Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
spurious itinerary of Antony of Piacenza of the 6th cent. states<br/>
that he visited the twelve <span style="color: #ff0000;">granaries </span>of Joseph (the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pyramids</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, and<br/>
the same notion was entertained by pilgrims as late as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ath</span>,<br/>
15th, and 16th centuries. It is worthy of remark that many of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">medieval </span>travellers, even as late as the 17th <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">concur </span>with the<br/>
most accurate of the Arabian authors in stating that they saw <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Pyramids. Thus the knight of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nygenhusen</span>, a<br/>
pilgrim who assumed the name of William of Boldensele <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>14th<br/>
cent<span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>informs us that he saw inscriptions on the Pyramids in different languages, and he gives six <span style="color: #0000FF;">verses </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>of them in Latin.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Alulullatir</span>, speaking of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pyramids</span>, which no<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
