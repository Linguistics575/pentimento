The plain watered by the Rosetta arm of the Nile is extremely<br/>
fertile. A little to the N. of Kafr <span style="color: #ff0000;">ez-Zaiyat </span>the river describes a<br/>
long curve; and somewhat farther to the N., on the W. bank, a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span>inland, but visible from the water, rise the ruins known as<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ed-Dahariyeh</span>, a series of heaps of debris which mark the site of a<br/>
.town of considerable size. On the W. bank, farther on, is the<br/>
pleasant village of Nakhleh. The village of (<span style="color: #ff0000;">ht </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Hager </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Con </span>the<br/>

<br/>
The ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'is </span>is mentioned in history at a very remote<br/>
period, and as early as the 18th Dynasty it was regarded as a cradle<br/>
of sacerdotal wisdom. The goddess Neith, whom the Greeks identified with their Athene, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the tutelary deity of the place. She<br/>
was one of the maternal <span style="color: #0000FF;">divinities</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">manifestation </span>of Isis (p. 135),<br/>
and was named the'great <span style="color: #0000FF;">cow</span>' which gave birth to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sum </span>She<br/>
was worshipped both by the Egyptians and the Libyans. On the<br/>
Roman coins of the Saite Nome is seen a <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of Minerva with<br/>
an owl in her right hand and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lance </span>in her left. It was this<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">identitieation </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neith </span>with Athene that probably led <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pausanias </span>to<br/>
suppose that Pallas-Athene originally came from Libya, to which<br/>
Sais was frequently considered to belong<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>According to an ancient<br/>
tradition, Athens is said to have been founded by Cecrops of Sais,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">afaneiful </span>corroboration <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofthemyth </span>is sought for in the fact that<br/>
the letters of <span style="color: #0000FF;">A-neth-e </span>and Athena are identical. Most of the<br/>
Greek scholars who repaired to Egypt for purposes of study went<br/>
either to Heliopolis or to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'x</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span>. According to Plato, Solon <span style="color: #0000FF;">associated </span>here with the learned men of Egypt, Herodotus obtained<br/>
much information here, and the fame of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Saite knowledge of<br/>
mysteries <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>maintained down to a late period. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">26th </span>Dynasty<br/>
originated in the city of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Neith</span>, and its kings were <span style="color: #0000FF;">spatially<br/>
</span>devoted to that goddess, to whom they erected monuments <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">great<br/>
</span>splendour. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Uambyscs </span>also visited Sais after his conquest of Egypt,<br/>
and showed himself favourable to the temple of the goddess and<br/>
her rites. It is not known when the town was destroyed. It was<br/>
probably an episcopal see at a <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>early period.<br/>
<br/>
There is now <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>trace of the famous buildings <span style="color: #0000FF;">erected </span>here by<br/>
Amasis and others (p. 93), or of the chapel formed of a single<br/>
block of granite brought from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Elephantinc </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sais</span>, which must<br/>
have weighed at least 250 tons. The site of the temple of Neith,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">connected </span>with the royal palace and with a mausoleum<br/>
for the Pharaohs of the 26th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dynasty</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cannotHOW </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">identified </span>with<br/>
any certainty. The columns <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">palm-eapitals</span>, the tomb of Osiris,<br/>
the obelisks, statues, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">androsphinxes</span>, mentioned by Herodotus,<br/>
have all <span style="color: #ff0000;">entirelydisappeared</span>. The sacred lake, however, on which,<br/>
according <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>Herodotus, mystery-plays were acted at night in<br/>
