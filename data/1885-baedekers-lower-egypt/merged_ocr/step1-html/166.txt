The history of Moses, as given in the Koran, presents no<br/>
features of special interest. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>is called the'speaker of God'; he<br/>
wrote <span style="color: #ff0000;">theThorah</span>, and is very frequently mentioned. - In the story<br/>
of Jesus <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>has perpetrated an absurd <span style="color: #0000FF;">anachronism</span>, Mary<br/>
being <span style="color: #0000FF;">confounded </span>with Miriam<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>the sister of Moses. Jesus is <span style="color: #ff0000;">tyalled </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rlsi</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but'Isl </span>is properly <span style="color: #0000FF;">Esau</span>, a name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">reproach<br/>
</span>among the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jews</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and this <span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span>us an indication of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>source<br/>
whence Mohammed derived most of his information. On the other<br/>
hand, Jesus is styled <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Word </span>of God', as in the Gospel of St.<br/>
John. A parallel is also drawn in the Koran between the creation<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Adam </span>and the nativity of Christ; like Adam, Jesus is said to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>been a <span style="color: #0000FF;">prophet </span>from childhood, and to have wrought miracles<br/>
which surpassed those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>other prophets, including even <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mehammed </span>himself. He proclaimed the Gospel, and thus <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonllrmed<br/>
</span>the Thorah; but in certain particulars the latter was abrogated by<br/>
him. Another was <span style="color: #ff0000;">erueified </span>in his stead, but God caused Jesus<br/>
also to die for a few hours before taking <span style="color: #0000FF;">him </span>up into heaven<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>Modern investigation shows with increasing clearness <span style="color: #ff0000;">howlittle<br/>
</span>originality these stories possess, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ani1h0wMtyltammed </span>merely repeated what he had learned from very mixed sources <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cfirst </span>Jewish, and<br/>
afterwards Christian also), sometimes entirely misunderstanding<br/>
the information thus acquired. The same is the ease with the<br/>
numerous narratives about other <span style="color: #ff0000;">so-ealled </span>prophets. Even <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexander </span>the Great is raised to the rank of a prophet, and his campaign<br/>
in India is represented as having been undertaken in the interests<br/>
of monotheism. Alexander is also associated with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khiglr</span>, or<br/>
animating <span style="color: #0000FF;">power </span>of nature<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>which is sometimes <span style="color: #0000FF;">identified </span>with<br/>
Elijah and St. George<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>only other matter <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofinterest </span>connected<br/>
with <span style="color: #ff0000;">slrolyammed</span>'s religious system is the position which he himself<br/>
occupies in it. Moses and Christ prophesied his advent, but the<br/>
passages concerning him in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thorah </span>and Gospels have been suppressed. lie is the promised <span style="color: #0000FF;">Paraclete</span>, the Comforter (<span style="color: #ff0000;">St. </span>John<br/>
xiv. Hi), the last and greatest of the prophets; but he does not<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">profess </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>entirely free from minor sins. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lle </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ty0nfirms </span>previous<br/>
revelations, but his appearance has superseded them<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>His whole<br/>
doctrine is a miracle, and it therefore does not require to be<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">confirmed </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">special </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">miracles</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">After </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>death, however, a number<br/>
of miracles were attributed to him, and although he <span style="color: #ff0000;">wasnotexaetly<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">deifirul</span>, the position assigned to him is <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">principal </span>mediator<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">God </span>and man. The apotheosis of human beings is, <span style="color: #ff0000;">more0ver</span>, an idea foreign to the Semitic mind, and it was the Persians<br/>
