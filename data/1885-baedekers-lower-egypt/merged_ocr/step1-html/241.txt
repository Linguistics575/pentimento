and the few scholars of any eminence who had remained till then<br/>
were obliged to leave the place. A new <span style="color: #0000FF;">insurrection </span>which broke<br/>
out in the reign of Phocas <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>attended with greater success than<br/>
previous revolts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Heraclius</span>, whom the Alexandrians now proclaimed emperor, contrived in 610 to maintain his possession of<br/>
the purple. The sway of the Eastern emperors in Egypt, <span style="color: #ff0000;">however</span>,<br/>
soon came to an end. 111619 Alexandria was captured by Chosroes,<br/>
King of Persia, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>the Christians were left unmolested. Ten years<br/>
later <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIeraclius </span>succeeded in recovering possession of Egypt, but<br/>
the troops of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khalif'Omar </span>soon afterwards invaded the country<br/>
and took Alexandria after a prolonged siege. In December, (<span style="color: #0000FF;">MI</span>,<br/>
Amr <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-UP</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rOmar</span>'s general, entered the city; but by order<br/>
of his master, he treated the inhabitants with moderation. The<br/>
decline of Alexandria now became still more marked, and about<br/>
this <span style="color: #0000FF;">period'Amr </span>founded <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fost√©t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">241</span>), as a new capital and seat<br/>
of government, free from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Christian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iniluenees</span>. The new town,<br/>
which gradually developed itself into the modern Cairo, soon<br/>
became an important and prosperous place at the expense of the<br/>
famous ancient Greek city. During the middle ages Alexandria<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">sank </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">into </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">insignifieanee</span>. Its commerce received a <span style="color: #0000FF;">deathblow </span>by<br/>
the discovery of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sea-ronte </span>to India round the Cape of Good<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hope</span>, and the discovery <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofAmerica </span>entailed new losses. After the<br/>
conquest <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>by the Turks [ <span style="color: #ff0000;">in1517</span>) the city languished under<br/>
the infamous <span style="color: #0000FF;">regime </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>, the harbours became choked<br/>
with sand, the population, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>numbered half <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>million<br/>
souls, dwindled down to 5000, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the environs were converted<br/>
into a sterile and marshy wilderness. With regard to the history of<br/>
the French invasion, see p. 105.<br/>
<br/>
The decay of the once powerful seaport was at length effectually<br/>
arrested by the vigorous hand of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed'Ali</span>, who improved<br/>
the harbours and constructed several canals. The chief benefit he<br/>
conferred on Alexandria was the construction of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jhrlyruidtyeh<br/>
</span>Canal, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was so named after the reigning Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mzthmfnl</span>.<br/>
By means of this channel fresh water <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>conducted to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">town<br/>
</span>from the Rosetta branch of the Nile, the adjoining fields were irrigated anew, <span style="color: #ff0000;">andAlesandria </span>was again connected with the Nile and<br/>
the rest of Egypt, the products of which had long found their only<br/>
outlets through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rosetta </span>and Damietta mouths of the river. The<br/>
enterprising <span style="color: #0000FF;">pasha </span>began the work in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1819</span>, employing no fewer<br/>
than 250,000 labourers, and completed it at a cost of 71/2 million<br/>
francs. He also improved the whole canal-system of the Delta, the<br/>
works being <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>superintended by the aged <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>eminent Linant<br/>
de Belleville-Pasha, general director of <span style="color: #0000FF;">public </span>works, and other<br/>
French engineers. The subsequent <span style="color: #ff0000;">vioeroys </span>have also made great<br/>
efforts to improve the prospects of the town; and the Egyptian<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">cottorr-trade</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>received <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>strong impulse from the American<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">war</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and found its chief outlet through Alexandria, has proved a<br/>
