PREFACE.<br/>
<br/>
The present volume is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>ofa series of <span style="color: #0000FF;">HANDBOOKS </span>FOR <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>EAST now in course of preparation, and designed, like the Editor's European handbooks, for the guidance of travellers.<br/>
<br/>
The materials from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the first edition of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Handbook </span>for Lower Egypt was compiled were partly furnished<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Professor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ebers </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Leipsie</span>, while articles on special<br/>
subjects, as well as many additions and emendations, <span style="color: #0000FF;">were<br/>
</span>contributed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span>number of other writers. The Editor is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">specially </span>indebted to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Prqfessor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ascherson </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dr. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Elunrioger<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Berlin, Dr. G. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Schweinfwth </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Franz </span>Bey of Cairo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Professor </span>Springer of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Leipsic</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Professor </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Soein </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tiibiugem<br/>
</span>To several English gentlemen who contributed <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>number of<br/>
valuable corrections and suggestions, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">particularly </span>to the<br/>
distinguished Egyptologist, Dr. Samuel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Birth</span>, the Editor<br/>
also begs to tender his grateful acknowledgements. The<br/>
corrections and additions for the second edition have been<br/>
mainly furnished by Dr. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sehweiefurtk</span>, Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Spitta </span>Bey (late<br/>
librarian to the Khedive), and Emil <span style="color: #ff0000;">Brugsclz </span>Bey, all of<br/>
Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The Editor has also repeatedly visited Lower Egypt for<br/>
the purpose of obtaining the most recent practical <span style="color: #0000FF;">infor-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>mation, of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">kind </span>most likely to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>useful to travellers.<br/>
As, however, a tour in the East is attended with far greater<br/>
difficulty than in Europe, and sources <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">information </span>are far<br/>
less abundant, the Handbook must necessarily <span style="color: #0000FF;">contain </span>many<br/>
imperfections, and the Editor will therefore gratefully avail<br/>
himself of any communications which his readers may kindly<br/>
contribute, as many of them <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>so generously done in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ease </span>of his European handbooks. As Oriental life and <span style="color: #0000FF;">scenery<br/>
</span>differ widely in many respects from European, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hardly </span>be appreciated without <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>previous study, the Editor<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">supply </span>the traveller with all the most<br/>
necessary preliminary information, believing that it will be<br/>
acceptable to most of his readers, although somewhat beyond<br/>
the province of an ordinary guide-book.<br/>
<br/>
The MAPS and PLANS have been an object of the Editor's<br/>
special care, as he knows by experience how little reliance<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span>be placed on information' obtained from the natives, even<br/>
when the traveller is conversant with their <span style="color: #ff0000;">language</span>. The<br/>
maps of the Handbook are based upon the large maps of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
