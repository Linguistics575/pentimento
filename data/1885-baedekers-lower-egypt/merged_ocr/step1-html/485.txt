<br/>
verged to the' <span style="color: #0000FF;">interior </span>of the Delta. Three other roads, one from<br/>
Mt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Casiusf </span>leading to the E., the second from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gerrha</span>, and the<br/>
third from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusium</span>, converged in the middle of the isthmus (<span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span>near the barrier of <span style="color: #ff0000;">E1-Gisr</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, joining the route leading thence<br/>
past <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>bank of the Bitter Lakes to the ancient<br/>
Arsinoe, at the N. end of the Gulf of Suez. The Mediterranean<br/>
was thus connected with the Red Sea by an overland route at a<br/>
very early period. After the powerful monarchs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes </span>had expelled the Hyksos and <span style="color: #0000FF;">subjugated </span>a great part of the W. side of the<br/>
continent of Asia, the coast districts of S. Arabia, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>islands and maritime towns of the Mediterranean, Seti I. and<br/>
Ramses II. (p. 90), the great and warlike princes of the 19th Dynasty, became desirous of establishing communication by water<br/>
between the Nile and the Red Sea in order that their navies and<br/>
merchantmen might thus pass between the latter and the Mediterranean. This project was probably carried <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>as early as the<br/>
reign of Seti L, as a representation of his time on the outer N.<br/>
wall of the great banquet hall of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Karnak </span>(see vol. ii. of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Handbook</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">elucidated </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>inscriptions, informs us that, on his victorious<br/>
return from Asia, Seti had to traverse a canal <span style="color: #0000FF;">U41 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lentil</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cutting</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>swarming with crocodiles (so that it must have communicated with the Nile), and defended by <span style="color: #0000FF;">bastions</span>, the names of<br/>
which distinctly indicate that it must have been situated <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the<br/>
frontier of the empire. The construction of the canal is, moreover,<br/>
attributed by many ancient authors, including Herodotus, Aristotle,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>, and Pliny, to Sesostris (Seti I. and Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>). The canal may possibly have led from Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Timsah </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusium</span>, and thus<br/>
have connected the two seas directly. Blocks bearing the names of<br/>
Ramses I., Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, and Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, found near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kantara </span>(p. 435),<br/>
seem to favour this conjecture. At a much later period, after <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seti's<br/>
</span>canal had probably been obliterated owing to neglect, Pharaoh<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nekho </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">9'2</span>) undertook to construct a canal between the Nile<br/>
and the Red Sea. The new canal quitted the Nile at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis<br/>
</span>(p. 410), and entered the Arabian Gulf near the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Patumos</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>No fewer than 120,000 Egyptians perished while engaged in<br/>
the work, and the king afterwards abandoned the work, as<br/>
he was informed by the oracle that the barbarians alone would<br/>
profit by the work. By the'barbarians' were <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehieily </span>meant the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl1amieians</span>, whose fleets at that time commanded both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The canal was probably completed,<br/>
after the conquest of Egypt by the Persians, by Darius, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun </span>of<br/>
Hystaspes, the great organiser of the Persian empire, and not by<br/>
Ptolemy Philadelphus, as stated by <span style="color: #ff0000;">some </span>authors. Numerous traces<br/>
<br/>
+ <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brugsch </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mentions </span>that <span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span>route traversed the desert of Shur<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirbonic </span>Lake) to the Gulf of Suez, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>was little frequented, being described by Pliny <span style="color: #0000FF;">as'asperum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">montibus </span>et <span style="color: #ff0000;">inops </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aquarum'<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">mountainous </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>destitute of water).<br/>
