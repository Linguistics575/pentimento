<br/>
stone-mason then converted these sketches with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">chisel </span>into <span style="color: #ff0000;">selief </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">figures</span>, some of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>were flat, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>others <span style="color: #ff0000;">ly </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ere </span>raised about<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">21/</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lines </span>or more. Lastly the painter coloured these designs, the<br/>
most conspicuous tints <span style="color: #0000FF;">being </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hiaek7 </span>reddish brown, pale <span style="color: #0000FF;">brown</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>yellow, light and dark blue, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">green.Parts </span>of the design that<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">11 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ere </span>intended to be white were not painted, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">left </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the natural<br/>
colour of the stone. All the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colours </span>so far as they have been<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chemically </span>analysed, are earthy substances, and are <span style="color: #0000FF;">beautifully<br/>
</span>preserved, except in eases where they have been too <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>exposed<br/>
to the sun and wind<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The women are always painted <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pale </span>yellow colour, and the men of a reddish brown tint. The metals also<br/>
have their conventional colours, iron being blue, and bronze yellow<br/>
or red, while wood is painted brown, or, when in logs, greenish<br/>
grey. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>painting animals the artists <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to imitate their<br/>
natural <span style="color: #0000FF;">colours</span>, and we accordingly find that the cows and calves<br/>
are black, brown, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dappled</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>On the death of the proprietor<br/>
of the tomb, his remains were deposited at the bottom of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">mummy-shaft</span>, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">task </span>of decorating the tomb was at an end,<br/>
so that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>perfect sculptures are to be seen in juxtaposition<br/>
with the mere designs in red chalk. If other members of the family died, their mummies <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>likewise deposited in the common<br/>
shaft, but no allusion to their history was recorded <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the walls of<br/>
the principal chamber. An <span style="color: #0000FF;">exception</span>, however, was made in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of the widow of the deceased, whose statue was placed on the<br/>
W. side of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tomb-ehamber </span>beside that of her <span style="color: #0000FF;">husband</span>, as has<br/>
been done in the tomb of Ti. <span style="color: #ff0000;">It </span>is also <span style="color: #0000FF;">worthy </span>of remark that the<br/>
name of the proprietor of the tomb is always engraved in hieroglyphies on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">se-talled </span>drum of the doorway and on that of a'stele'<br/>
fashioned in imitation of a door on the W. side of the tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>as in<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of the tomb of Ti, p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">388</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. In a <span style="color: #0000FF;">number </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tombs </span>it<br/>
has been observed that a single <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>has been obliterated, while<br/>
the whole of the rest of the decorations are well preserved and<br/>
intact. The figures thus defaced are supposed to have been <span style="color: #ff0000;">those<br/>
</span>of dishonest servants, whose misconduct induced the family to<br/>
erase their portraits. At stated intervals, <span style="color: #ff0000;">onholidays</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">probably<br/>
</span>also on the anniversary of the death of the occupant of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb</span>,<br/>
the family was <span style="color: #0000FF;">went </span>to assemble in the decorated <span style="color: #ff0000;">tomh-chamher<br/>
</span>and the anterior court, bringing offerings <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">food </span>which they <span style="color: #0000FF;">eon </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sumed </span>in honour of the deceased, while homage was done to the<br/>
statue by burning incense around it.<br/>
<br/>
The Rock Tombs, placed in long rows, and most of them <span style="color: #0000FF;">excavated </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">011 </span>the E. and S. slopes of the plateau, are in a far simpler<br/>
style than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">maetahas</span>, both in point of construction and of <span style="color: #0000FF;">internal </span>decoration; but they <span style="color: #0000FF;">sometimes </span>contain similar decorations,<br/>
particularly in Upper Egypt.<br/>
