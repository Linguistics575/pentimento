<span>RELIGION. 127<br/>
<br/>
of a white cow impregnated by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">moonbeam</span>. In order to represent<br/>
Apis worthily, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ball </span>had to be sought which possessed a black hide,<br/>
a white triangle on his forehead, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">light </span>spot on <span style="color: #0000FF;">his<br/>
<br/>
</span>back in the form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>eagle, and under his <span style="color: #0000FF;">tongue<br/>
</span>an <span style="color: #0000FF;">excrescence </span>shaped like the sacred <span style="color: #ff0000;">searabayus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>After his death <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>representative of Apis <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">embalmed </span>and preserved in a sarcophagus of <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone<br/>
</span>(p. 386)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>He was the symbol of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">constantly<br/>
</span>operative fashioning power of the deity, and is on<br/>
that account represented as the son of the moon,<br/>
which, though never changing, appears to refashion itself every hour. The era of time named<br/>
after Apis was a lunar period, containing 309 mean<br/>
synodic <span style="color: #0000FF;">months</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>almost exactly <span style="color: #0000FF;">corresponded </span>with 25 Egyptian years<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>Ra, the great god of Heliopolis (On) in Lower<br/>
Egypt, as the king of gods and <span style="color: #0000FF;">men</span>, ranks next to<br/>
Ptah, and is, from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">exoteric </span>point of view, the<br/>
sun <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>illumines the world with the light of his<br/>
eyes, and the awakener of life. He rises <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">child</span>,<br/>
under the name of Harmachis <span style="color: #ff0000;">CHar-em-khutO</span>, at<br/>
midday he is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>, and at sunset he is represented as Tum, an old man subduing the<br/>
enemies of Ra, who obstruct his entrance to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptah</span>,<br/>
lower regions which he traverses at night. During<br/>
his course through the nether world he becomes the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ram-headed<br/>
</span>Khnum <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>129), or the nocturnal link between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turn </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Har-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">machis</span>, or evening and morning. As man in the region ofthe shades<br/>
has to undergo many trials, so the ship of the sun, as soon as he<br/>
has crossed the western horizon, no longer sails along the blueback<br/>
of the goddess Nut, but along the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sinuosities </span>of the serpent Apep,<br/>
the enemy of the setting sun, who is subdued and held in bondage<br/>
by the companions of Ra.<br/>
<br/>
In rising Ra is born, and in setting he dies; but his life is<br/>
daily renewed by an act of <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-procreation </span>taking place daily in<br/>
the bosom of nature, which was termed Isis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mum</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span>. This<br/>
goddess is frequently called the ruler of the nether regions, and is<br/>
represented with the head of a cow, or in the form of a cow, which<br/>
every morning gives birth to the young sun. Twelve human <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures</span>,<br/>
each bearing the orb of the sun or a star on his head, represent the<br/>
hours ofthe day and night. The animals specially sacred to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra </span>were<br/>
the hawk<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>the Upper Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">li </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ght-eolo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ured </span>Mnevis bull, which also<br/>
belonged at a later period to Ammon Ra, and a specimen of which<br/>
had even before that time been kept in the temple of the sun at<br/>
Heliopolis; and, lastly, lions with light skins. The Phoenix, or bird<br/>
from the land of palms, called by the Egyptians <span style="color: #0000FF;">henna</span>, which,<br/>
