and<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>after him, by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>, who appears from the inscription on the royal<br/>
tombs at Thebes to have been a purely <span style="color: #ff0000;">pantheistie </span>conception, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'frame </span>ofthe universe' and'the universe', and whose sphere <span style="color: #0000FF;">there-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fore </span>embraced the lower <span style="color: #ff0000;">aswell </span>as the upper regions. [ See also<br/>

The SACRED ANIMALS and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">MIXED </span>Forms, which generally<br/>
consist of human bodies with the heads of animals, frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">recur </span>as companions of the gods, or are used as emblems of the deities<br/>
themselves. In each case those animals were selected whose<br/>
inherent dispositions and habits corresponded to the power or<br/>
phenomenon of nature <span style="color: #0000FF;">personified </span>in the god. Specimens of these<br/>
animals were kept in <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>near the temples, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>of them<br/>
were <span style="color: #ff0000;">euibalmed </span>after death and revered in the form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">mummies<br/>
</span>Thus, the maternal divinities were appropriately represented<br/>
by the cow, the patient mother and nurse; the goddess of love, the<br/>
bride of Ptah, was represented with the head of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fierce </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lion </span>or a eat;<br/>
the crocodile was sacred to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebek</span>, the god who caused the waters of<br/>
the Nile to rise; and the hawk, which soars towards heaven like<br/>
the sun, was dedicated to Ra. The symbol of Ptah was the black<br/>
Apis bull, whose great power of generation seemed analogous to<br/>
the never ceasing creative energy of the black soil of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">TUE </span>EGYPTIAN <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goes</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span>of the gods, as we have<br/>
already mentioned, was Ptah, the Greek Hephaestus<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>He was the<br/>
ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">godoC11emphis</span>, who delivered to Ra the germs <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">creation</span>,<br/>
and was assisted in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">labours </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bythe </span>seven <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khnumu </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">architects<br/>
</span>As from him were supposed to emanate the laws and conditions<br/>
of existence, he is also styled'lord of truth'. He is <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>the form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mummy</span>, but with his hands protruding from the<br/>

<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">grasping </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sceptre</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">neck-ornament </span>called'menat' is generally<br/>
<br/>
attached to <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">back</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">head </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">usually </span>wears a smith's cap.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>sometimes occurs with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">searabaus </span>instead of a head. In view<br/>
of his connection with the doctrine of immortality and with the<br/>
infernal regions, he sometimes appears in the inscriptions as <span style="color: #ff0000;">PtahSokur- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Osiris</span>, who prescribes to the sun that has set, as well as to<br/>
the mummies of the dead, the conditions under which they may<br/>
rise again and enter on a new life. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The'primawal </span>Ptah' is also<br/>
spoken <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>as <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">head </span>of the solar gods, and also <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>as the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">creator </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>egg, from which, according to an older myth, the<br/>
sun and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>moon came forth. Thence, too, is derived his name,<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">signifies'the </span>opener'. By his side are often placed the<br/>
goddess <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sckhct </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pashtl</span>, and his son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Imhotep </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">VEsculapiusi</span>).<br/>
<br/>
His sacred animal <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the Apia bull, which was the offspring<br/>
