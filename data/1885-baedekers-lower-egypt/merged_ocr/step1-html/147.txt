<span style="color: #ff0000;">CleOIthose </span>who held this doctrine there could be no original act of<br/>
ation, and no plurality of gods; but a metaphysical conception<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>of apprehension could not be <span style="color: #ff0000;">proponnded </span>to the great<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">my </span>of the people. For the use of such persons it was, therefore<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o.gmpliflei1</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">clothed </span>with allegorical forms, through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">medium<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>which they might behold it as through <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">veil</span>, somewhat <span style="color: #0000FF;">obscured</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>at at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span>time embellished and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sham </span>of its terrors. This<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">3nstituted </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">EXOTERIC </span>DOCTRINE, with which was connected<br/>
the theogony, or theory of the origin and descent of the divinities<br/>
who represented the various forces and phenomena of nature. These<br/>
gods, however, though not existent from all eternity, were neither<br/>
created nor begotten, but were regarded as having been <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-created<br/>
</span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wombs </span>of their own mothers, and are therefore spoken of as<br/>
'their own fathers','their own sons', and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'husbands </span>of their<br/>
mothers'. The deities accordingly are seldom spoken of as single<br/>
individuals, <span style="color: #0000FF;">butin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">triads</span>, as father, mother, and son (comp. p. 130).<br/>
<br/>
The primary source from which all life proceeds, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>cause<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>all things, was clothed with a personal form, called Nun. The<br/>
principle <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflight</span>, and the creative power of nature, which implants<br/>
in matter the germs of existence and light, was Khepera, or the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">scarabasus </span>with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>disk, whose emblem was <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beetle </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Marabaeus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sacer</span>). As that insect rolls up into a ball the eggs which<br/>
produce its offspring, and was supposed to have no female, so this<br/>
deity <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>believed to have concealed within the globe <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>world<br/>
the germs of organic life. Ptah is the greatest of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gods</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and is<br/>
the embodiment ofthe organising and motive power developed from<br/>
moisture (Nun). It is he who imparts form to the germs sown by<br/>
Khepera, <span style="color: #ff0000;">andunder </span>the name <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofSekhem </span>Nefer breaks the ball rolled<br/>
along by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">scarabzeus</span>, or in other words the egg of the universe,<br/>
from which emerge his children, the elements and the forms of<br/>
heaven and earth. Ra, a deity who <span style="color: #0000FF;">beam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">seventy-live </span>different<br/>
forms, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>appears in the Nun under the name of Tum, or the<br/>
evening sun; during his passage through the lower hemisphere,<br/>
that of night, he is known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khnum</span>, and is born anew on the<br/>
next <span style="color: #0000FF;">morning </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">creation</span>, bursting forth in the form of a child<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>) from a <span style="color: #0000FF;">lotus-flower </span>floating on the Nun. Evening and<br/>
night precede the morning and day; and Amenthes, or the infernal<br/>
regions, were believed to have existed before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">upper </span>regions<br/>
which formed the scene of human life.<br/>
<br/>
After the breaking of the egg <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the world, the universe is resolved into three empires: - <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>) The heavenly Nut, represented<br/>
as a woman<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>bending over the earth, on whose back float<br/>
the vessel of the sun, the planets, and the constellations. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span>) Seb,<br/>
or the earth, which possesses the power of eternal <span style="color: #0000FF;">rejuvenescence</span>,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>regarded by the Egyptians as the symbol <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eternity</span>, a<br/>
deity somewhat resembling the Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chronos</span>. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span>Infernal<br/>
Regions, which are presided over by Ptah, the power productive of<br/>
<br/>
