</span>rod, to which <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>panther-skin, the garb of his priests, is attached.<br/>
In <span style="color: #0000FF;">consequence </span>of his function of promoting vegetable life, his<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1santleringis</span>, and perhaps also on account of this staff and skin, he<br/>
was termed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dionysus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Bacchus) by the Greeks.<br/>
<br/>
Typhon-Seth. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>Typhon is most probably of Greek<br/>
origin. The Egyptians named him Seth, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sutekh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">represented<br/>
<br/>
</span>him as a fabulous animal N, or with <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">head </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">animal</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>subsequently as an ass, an animal which was sacred to him, or<br/>
with an ass's head. His name is met with in the most remote <span style="color: #0000FF;">period</span>, but he appears originally to have been worshipped merely as<br/>
a god of war and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tutelary </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">deity </span>of foreigners. He is usually<br/>
styled the brother of Horns, and the two are called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rehehui</span>, or<br/>
hostile <span style="color: #0000FF;">twins</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>who wounded each other in the battle above <span style="color: #0000FF;">described</span>. At a later period, after the god of battles and of foreigners<br/>
had shown himself permanently <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable </span>to the Egyptians,<br/>
they ceased to render service to him, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">erased </span>his name from<br/>
the monuments on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>it occurred, and even from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches<br/>
</span>of the most highly extolled <span style="color: #0000FF;">kings</span>. With regard to his connection<br/>
with the myth of Osiris and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isis</span>, see p. 130.<br/>
<br/>
Nephthys, the wife of Seth, was called by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">GreeksAphrodite<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span>Nike <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Victory</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, probably on account of her being the wife of<br/>
the god of war. Her proper sphere was the<br/>
nether world<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the upper world she <span style="color: #0000FF;">occurs </span>as<br/>
the nurse or <span style="color: #ff0000;">instruetress </span>of the youthful Horus,<br/>
and she appears with Isis, mourning <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beating<br/>
</span>her forehead, at the funeral rites of Osiris,<br/>
whom she had loved, and to whom, being mistaken by him in the dark for Isis, she <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>borne<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Anubis </span>She is also associated with Osiris and<br/>
Isis, with the youthful Horus and Isis, and<br/>
even, as one of a tetrad, with Osiris, Isis, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns </span>She <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">usually </span>represented with the sym<br/>
hol (Le<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>neb-hat, mistress of the house) on<br/>
<br/>
her head, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whieh </span>is adorned with the vulture<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cap</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and grasping in her hands the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flower.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sceptre </span>and the symbol of life.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nuh-hnt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iNcwtrhurys0</span>. Anubis was the guide of the dead to the<br/>
infernal regions and the guardian of Hades, of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">whieh </span>he is termed the master. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the form of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">jaekal</span>, or with<br/>
the head of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">jacks </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>presides over funeral rites and guards the<br/>
kingdom of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>West.<br/>
<br/>
Horus, who occurs in many <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>forms, invariably represents<br/>
the upper world or region of light, and also regeneration, <span style="color: #0000FF;">resurrection</span>, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil, of life over<br/>
death, of light <span style="color: #ff0000;">over </span>darkness, and of truth over falsehood. He <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
