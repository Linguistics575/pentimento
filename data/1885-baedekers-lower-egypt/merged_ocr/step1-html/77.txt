<span>Course. THE NILE. <span style="color: #0000FF;">55<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Nile (comp<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Map, p. 30). The Nile ranks with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amazon </span>and the Congo as one of the three longest rivers in the world<br/>
(about <span style="color: #0000FF;">4000 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">U</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>), since its headstream is probably to be found in<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shimiju</span>, which rises <span style="color: #ff0000;">five </span>degrees to the S. of the Equator.<br/>
Throughout nearly the whole of its course the river is navigable,<br/>
with two great interruptions only (at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1Jarnmed-Barka1 </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Donlrola-Widi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Halfa</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Though it is greatly surpassed by the Amazon and Congo in volume, neither these nor any other river in the<br/>
world can vie in historical and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ethnographical </span>interest with the<br/>
'father of rivers'.<br/>
<br/>
The discovery of the true sources of the Nile and the cause of<br/>
its annual <span style="color: #0000FF;">overflow </span>are two <span style="color: #ff0000;">seientitie </span>problems which for upwards<br/>
of 2000 years European <span style="color: #ff0000;">sel1olars </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">laboured </span>to solve, while the Egyptians themselves regarded the river as a deity, and its origin and<br/>
properties as the most sacred of mysteries, to be revealed to the<br/>
curious spirit of man only when he should have quitted this earthly<br/>
scene. As it is the Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile </span>only with which we have at<br/>
present to deal, we shall advert but <span style="color: #0000FF;">briefly </span>to the subject of the<br/>
sources of the river, and mention the principal <span style="color: #0000FF;">affluents </span>only <span style="color: #0000FF;">Which<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">affect </span>Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile is formed by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonf1uenee </span>of the White and the Blue<br/>
Nile at the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khariplm</span>, from which point to its principal<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">months </span>at Damietta and Rosetta, a distance of upwards of 1800<br/>
miles, it traverses an absolutely barren <span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span>and receives one<br/>
tributary only, the Atbara, on the east side, about 180 miles below<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kurttrn</span>, Throughout the whole of this distance, in the course of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>it falls 1240 ft., the river has to contend against numerous<br/>
absorbing <span style="color: #ff0000;">inflt1enees</span>, for which it receives no compensation beyond<br/>
the rare showers attracted in winter by the mountains between<br/>
its right bank and the Red Sea. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nothwithstanding </span>the immense<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lengthofthe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">river</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rarely </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">presents </span>the picturesque appearance<br/>
of some of the great European and other rivers, as its banks are<br/>
generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>and monotonous, and it contains <span style="color: #0000FF;">hardly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>single island<br/>
worthy of mention. The broadest parts of this portion of the Nile<br/>
are a little <span style="color: #0000FF;">below </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharttnn</span>, a little above its bifurcation near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Calm</span>,<br/>
and also near Minyeh, at each of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>places it attains a width of<br/>
about 1100 yds., while the White Nile is <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">greater </span>breadth throughout<br/>
a long part <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span>As the river pursues its tortuous<br/>
course through thirsty land, for a distance of 15 degrees <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflatitude</span>,<br/>
much <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofits </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">water </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>consumed by evaporation <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">infiltration </span>(a process by which it is probable that Libyan oases are supplied with<br/>
water from the Nubian Nile), and still more so by the extensive<br/>
system of <span style="color: #ff0000;">artifielal </span>canals requisite for the irrigation of a whole<br/>
kingdom<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>Linant estimates this loss at the time of the inundation within Egypt proper, Le. between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Selseleh </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>,<br/>
