the most skilful decline to exhibit unless paid with gold. The<br/>
Hamel, or men in female attire, who frequently dance at festivities<br/>
instead of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghawftzi</span>, present a most repulsive <span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance</span>.<br/>

The SNAKE <span style="color: #0000FF;">CHARMERS </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Rifa'Zyeh</span>, sing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rifa'i</span>), who form another distinct caste, exhibit performances of a very marvellous<br/>
character, as credible European residents in Cairo have <span style="color: #0000FF;">testified</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>but the traveller will <span style="color: #0000FF;">rarely </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">come </span>in contact with them. The ordinary<br/>
exhibition of dancing snakes may, however, <span style="color: #ff0000;">oeeasionally </span>be seen<br/>
in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezhekiyeht </span>The boys who exhibit small snakes at the hotels<br/>

The <span style="color: #0000FF;">JUGGLERS </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ham</span>) of Egypt are similar to those of other<br/>
countries. The performances of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">BUFFOONS </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kuradciti </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahabbas0</span>, which are <span style="color: #ff0000;">ehiefly </span>intended for the amusement of the young,<br/>

(13). Baths.<br/>
<br/>
The baths of Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>with their <span style="color: #0000FF;">hot-air </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers</span>, are those commonly known as Turkish, but they are neither so clean <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>so well<br/>
fitted up <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>some of those in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">larger </span>cities of Europe.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Haram </span>(see Plan), as well as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maghtas </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hunafiyeh</span>,<br/>
have flat ceilings in which are openings covered with stained<br/>
glass. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">maghtas </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilanafiyeh </span>each contain marble basins<br/>
for washing, provided with taps for warm water; the maghtas<br/>
contain besides a bath sunk in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pavement </span>Cold water is brought<br/>
in ewers. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">lurrtra</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">general </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bath-chamber</span>, is less heated than<br/>
the separate rooms, and is filled with steam. All the chambers<br/>
are paved with marble slabs and heated by <span style="color: #ff0000;">f1ues </span>under the pavement<br/>
and behind the walls.<br/>
<br/>
When a cloth is hung up at the entrance to the baths, it <span style="color: #0000FF;">indicates </span>that women only are admitted. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>baths are always cleanest<br/>
in the early morning. Fridays are to be avoided, as numerous Muslims<br/>
bathe early on that day, which is their <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sabbath</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The visitor <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>enters a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">vaulted </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber </span>covered with a<br/>

centre <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">faslsiyeh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, and the bathing towels hung around <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>strings,<br/>
these last being swung into their places or taken down with bamboo<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rods </span>according to requirement. Having taken <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>his shoes and<br/>
given them to the attendant, the visitor is next conducted to one<br/>
of the raised divans which are still unoccupied, where he proceeds<br/>
to undress. Valuables may, if desired, be entrusted to the hath<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">owner</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Wrapping a cloth round his loins, he leaves his divan, is<br/>
provided with pattens or wooden shoes (<span style="color: #ff0000;">.kab.k8bh </span>and is conducted<br/>
to the hot room (<span style="color: #0000FF;">harem</span>) in the interior of the establishment. Near<br/>
