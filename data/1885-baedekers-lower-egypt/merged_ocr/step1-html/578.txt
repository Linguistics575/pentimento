<span>508 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">10</span>. MONASTERY <span style="color: #0000FF;">0F </span>SINAI. <span style="color: #ff0000;">FromSues<br/>
<br/>
</span>Among the sacred utensils in the choir <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>a finely executed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ciborium</span>, or stand for the communion chalice, and a short marble<br/>
sarcophagus said to contain the head <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>one hand <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofSL </span>Catharine,<br/>
who is specially revered by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek </span>orthodox church. Here, too,<br/>
is shown a valuable, but unpleasing <span style="color: #ff0000;">reliquaty</span>, presented by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Russian </span>Christians. The head of St. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Catharine </span>is represented on a<br/>
silver pillow, her face and hands being enamelled. Another similar<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">reliquary</span>, bearing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the saint in gilded silver, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">presented </span>by the Empress Catharine of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Russia<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Chapel <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Burning Bush, at the back of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">apse</span>,<br/>
marking the spot where God is said to have appeared to Moses, is<br/>
probably the oldest part of the structure. Visitors must remove<br/>
their shoes before entering. The walls are covered with slabs of<br/>
porcelain. The spot where the bush is said to have stood is<br/>
indicated by a plate of chased silver; over it is placed a kind of<br/>
altar, within Which are suspended three burning lamps. At the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>of this sanctuary is a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">niche </span>adorned with figures, in a<br/>
line with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">apse</span>, the semicircular wall of which encloses the<br/>
whole E. end of the building. A ray of the sun is said to enter<br/>
this sanctuary once only in the course of the year, gaining admission<br/>
through <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>cleft of the rock <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the E. side of the valley. From a<br/>
cross erected there the hill has been named the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jebel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">esy-f.lalih</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Chapels surrounding the nave contain no objects of interest.<br/>
Each is dedicated to an evangelist, saint, or martyr (SS. Anna, the<br/>
holy martyrs <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Sinai, James, Constantia and Helena, Demetrius<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sergius </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. Adjoining the right aisle of the basilica are the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chapels </span>of SS. Simon Stylites, Cosmas, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damianus</span>; adjoining<br/>
the left aisle are those of SS<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Anna, Marina, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Antipas</span>. The<br/>
chapel <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the Latins, near the visitors' rooms, is now disused, as<br/>
the Roman Catholics no longer make pilgrimages to this monastery.<br/>
<br/>
The Mosque, a building of simple construction, is badly <span style="color: #0000FF;">preserved</span>. The stone wall of an out-building <span style="color: #0000FF;">near </span>the mosque and an<br/>
arch between the mosque and the church still <span style="color: #ff0000;">hear </span>several coats of<br/>
arms in the early <span style="color: #0000FF;">mediaeval </span>style, perhaps those of Crusaders. Opposite is the chapel of the Panagia, which contains several portraits of bishops and archbishops of Sinai and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>model <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">projected </span>reconstruction of the monastery. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">now</span>, however, very<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">problematical </span>whether this scheme of reconstruction will ever <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>carried out, since the property of the convent in Russia and <span style="color: #ff0000;">WaIaehia </span>has been secularised.<br/>
<br/>
The Library of the monastery, which is sadly cramped for want<br/>
of room, is more valuable than many better arranged and outwardly<br/>
more imposing collections in Europe. Among its treasures are a<br/>
great many Greek and Arabic MSS., besides others in Syrian,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ethiopian</span>, Persian, Armenian, Slavonic, and Russian. The most<br/>
valuable MSS., however, are kept stored away in cases, and the<br/>
only ones exhibited to visitors <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>a few'show' pieces in the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
