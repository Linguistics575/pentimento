<span>of Cairo. BARRAGE DU NIL. <span style="color: #0000FF;">f </span>Route. 407<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>be obtained from the minister of war through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller's<br/>
</span>consulate.<br/>
<br/>
The barrier, which consists <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>huge <span style="color: #0000FF;">bridge </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">lock-gates</span>, built<br/>
across the the Nile at the S. extremity of the Delta, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span>M.<br/>
below Cairo, dates from the time of the energetic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed'Ali<br/>
</span>and was constructed from the plans of a French engineer named<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mongel-Bey</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fortifications </span>of considerable strength were constructed here by<br/>
Sa<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">id </span>Pasha for the purpose of arresting the progress of any <span style="color: #0000FF;">invading </span>army, and storing munitions of war. The place was therefore<br/>
called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karat </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sa'idZyeh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Castle</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>7 but is now known <span style="color: #ff0000;">as'iianitir</span>' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">bridges</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The object of the Barrage was to keep the water of the Nile at<br/>
the same level in all seasons, so that the necessity for irrigation<br/>
machinery throughout the district below it would <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>entirely<br/>
superseded, while those fields to the S. of it <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are on a level<br/>
with the reservoir would also <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">benefited</span>. The Barrage was also<br/>
intended to remove the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties </span>of navigation below this point<br/>
during the three months when the Nile is at its lowest. During<br/>
that period the water is too shallow for large vessels, and even<br/>
small vessels are often impeded by shoals and shifting sandbanks;<br/>
and it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>therefore proposed that the whole of the communication<br/>
by water should then be kept up by means of large canals.<br/>
<br/>
The first trial of the Barrage was unsuccessful; when the gates<br/>
were closed to retain the water, part of the work gave way and it<br/>
was hastily concluded that the whole undertaking <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a costly<br/>
failure. For the next twenty years the Barrage was nothing but an<br/>
impediment to the navigation, as vessels often take several hours<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>the passage of the locks, which is sometimes even attended with danger, and have to pay heavy <span style="color: #0000FF;">dues</span>. At the beginning of<br/>
1883, however, it was carefully tested by two English engineers,<br/>
who came to the conclusion that the Barrage might not be so wholly<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unh'tted </span>for its intended purpose as had been generally taken for<br/>
granted. As the Nile fell, they <span style="color: #ff0000;">accordinglylowered </span>the gates inch<br/>
by inch, and found that no untoward results ensued. On the contrary<br/>
the water at the Barrage only fell 10 inches while it fell 57 inches<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuin</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin </span>were enabled to irrigate their <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields<br/>
</span>without recourse to the expensive steam-pumping apparatus on<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they had previously <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>dependent. It would, however,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rash </span>to make a prophecy from the successful experiment <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>single year, and the engineers who conducted it are of the opinion<br/>
that an expenditure of <span style="color: #ff0000;">200 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">000t</span>. would be necessary to make the<br/>
Barrage quite secure. As yet, also, no barrier has been constructed<br/>
for the Damietta branch of the Nile; <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>for the complete success<br/>
of the scheme this, of course, would <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>essential. Comp. the map<br/>
