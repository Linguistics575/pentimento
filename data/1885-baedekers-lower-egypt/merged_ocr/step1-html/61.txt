<span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>). The <span style="color: #ff0000;">FBLqugiN </span>(sing. <span style="color: #ff0000;">feutJ.i</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'tillers</span>' or'peasants',<br/>
form the bulk of the population, and may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>regarded as the sinews<br/>
of the national strength. They are generally slightly above the<br/>
middle height; their bones, and particularly their skulls, are strong<br/>
and massive; and their wrists and ankles are powerful and somewhat clumsy. In all these respects the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellahiu</span>, as well as their<br/>
domestic animals, contrast strongly with the inhabitants of the<br/>
desert, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah </span>and the Beduin differing from each other precisely<br/>
in the same points as their respective camels<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Notwithstanding this<br/>
largeness of frame, however, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah </span>never grows fat. The<br/>
woman and girls are particularly <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable </span>for their slender build,<br/>
and they often speak of each other as'zei <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-l.1abl</span>', or slender as a<br/>
rope. The men generally keep their heads shaved, but the hair<br/>
of the soldiers and the long tresses <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>girls, though always black<br/>
and often curly, is by no means of the short, woolly negro type<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">chief </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiarity </span>of the Egyptians is the remarkable <span style="color: #0000FF;">closeness </span>of their eyelashes on both lids, forming a dense, double, black<br/>
fringe, which gives so animated an expression to their <span style="color: #ff0000;">almondshaped </span>eyes. The very ancient and still existing <span style="color: #0000FF;">custom </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofhlarykenEng </span>the edges of the eyelids with antimony <span style="color: #ff0000;">C'kolyr</span>), which is said<br/>
to serve a sanitary purpose, contributes to enhance this natural<br/>
expression. The eyebrows are always straight and smooth, never<br/>
bushy. The mouth is wide and <span style="color: #0000FF;">thiek-lipped</span>, and very different<br/>
from that <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lieduin </span>or inhabitant of the oases. The high <span style="color: #ff0000;">eheekbones</span>, the receding forehead, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lowness </span>of the bridge of the nose,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is always distinctly separated from the forehead, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flatness </span>of the nose itself, are the chief characteristics of the<br/>
Egyptian skull; but, as the jaws project less than those of most<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the other African coloured races, it has been assumed that the<br/>
skull is Asiatic, and not African in shape. The Egyptian peasantry<br/>
have a much darker complexion than their compatriots in the towns,<br/>
and their colour deepens as we proceed southwards, <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the pale<br/>
brown of the inhabitant of the Delta to the dark bronze hue of the<br/>
Upper Egyptians. There is also a difference between the tint of the<br/>
Nubians and that of the Upper Egyptians, even where they live in<br/>
close <span style="color: #ff0000;">eontiguity</span>, the former being more of a reddish-brown.<br/>
<br/>
The dwelling of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fella </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>is of a miserably poor description,<br/>
consisting generally of four low walls formed of crude bricks of<br/>
Nile mud, and thatched <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a'roof </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>dura straw, rush, rags, or old<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">straw-mats</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the interior are a few mats, a sheep's skin, several<br/>
baskets made of matting, a copper kettle, and a few earthenware<br/>
pots and wooden dishes. Instead of using the crude bricks, the<br/>
fellahin in Upper Egypt often form the walls of their huts ofa<br/>
mixture of mud and straw. The dark, windowless interior is entered <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>a small opening, in front of which the proprietor usually<br/>
forms an enclosure of <span style="color: #0000FF;">circular </span>shape, with a wall of mud about<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>in height. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eourt-yard </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>establishment, and the<br/>
