X. The Arabic Language.

Arabic belongs to the Sen) ie group of languages, and has no
relationship with the tongues of hnmpe. A knowledge of Hebrew,
however, will materially facilitate the learning of Arabic. The
guldun era ofArabie literature is coeval with the introduction of
lil- and the Koran in the dialect of the hureish (the
family of Muhammed) is still regarded as an unrivalled model of
style, and language. As Ill-Islam spread from its narrow home over
the vast territories that gradually acknowledged the Crescent, Arabic
lost many of its older and fuller forms and was greatly simpliiled
for daily use. In this way arose the vulgar dialects of Ambit, of
which that spoken in Egypt is one. In writing, however, an attempt was made to retain the older forms, and the written language of the presrmt day, known as Middle Arabic, occupies a poritirm midway hetween the original classical tongue and the popular
tialetts. Egypt was conquered by the Arabs in the 19th year of
Thu llegira (640 A.Df) and the Coptic language was replaced by
Arabic. The dialect of the latter developed in the valley of the

master the pronunciation of the more tlifileult Arabic consonants.
