there to prevent the roof from falling in. To judge from the extent of the
mines the quantity of ore obtained must have been very considerable.
To this day one of the mines contains a considerable quantity of copper
ore, while another, where chambers 80 ft. in length have been excavated,
seems to have been given up as exhausted'. (RiipplllJ

with half-obliterated hieroglyphics.

Descending the Wadi Nagh towards the N. we reach the month
of the Wadi FJobtoz (see below), where the caravan should be
ordered to await our arrival. _

Beyond the Wiili Merattameh the Suez route continues to follow
the Wiidi Shwik, to the N.W., passing a number of fine seyil trees
of great age. After 1 hr. the valley takes the name of Wtuli Hobt'tz,
and in less than 1 hr. more it unites with the W0di Nugb, which
almost immediately joins the l Tali Bibi, a valley leading to the
S.E. to the Hanak et-Lalcam (p. 490). At the junction of the
Ijnbflz and Nasib valleys our route turns to the right, and leads
across the sandy table-land of Debbet el-Kerrti in 3 hrs. to the
beginning of the Wadi el-IJomr. Ascending a little towards the
middle of the lofty plain, we enjoy a fine view of the Sarbt'tt elJemel, (2175 ft), rising to the W. opposite to us, beyond the Wadi

mountains with flat summits; to the right is the Tih range; and
behind us are the hills of fijarbtit. el-Khidem, the Jebel Ghiribi,
and the distant Mt. Serbi1.

We now descend to the broad route leading to Nakhleh (p. 52 (0.
on the right rises the long Jebel Plein'. On the ground here we
observe a number of curious geological formations, consisting of
slabs and fragments of sandstone encrusted with nodules of iron
ore, with a large admixture of silica, grouped like bunches of
grapes. Some of these are perfectly spherical.

The Wadi eI-Homr is a broad valley flanked by low limestone
hills. It is commanded on the N. side by the Farbr1.t el » Jemel (see
above). From this valley a path, practicable for camels, traverses
the Wddi Mesulckar and several other valleys, and leads direct
to the Wthli etle Thai (p 4801. The regular route follows the Wtuli
el-ljomr to its union with the W0di Shebékch (see p. 489). Thence
to Suez, see pp. 469-485,
