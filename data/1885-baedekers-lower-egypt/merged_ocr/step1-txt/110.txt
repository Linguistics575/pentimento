SS HISTORY.

Under this Dynasty the sceptres of Upper and Lower
Egypt were united. All the kings were powerful and prosperous, and art again flourished. The Sun Temple at Heliopolis (see p. 335) \m: magnificently restored, and in the
Fayt'im the yraetiee of building pyramids was revived (see

erected on the N E, frontier of the kingdom which appear

The Hyksos Period (pp. 908, 373, 3153, iN).

and ohtain possession ol' the whnie of Lower Iigypt. They
made Tanis the capital, and under the name Onyksos
ruled over N.ligypt t'ertiie centuries, while the exiled royal
family was compelled to retire to Upper Egypt. (The name
uf'llyksos', according to Josephus, 5lanctho, and others,
is derived from hyk, a king, and sos, a shepherd and thus
