Ct Oht "OL'SE. The eustom-house examination at Alexandria
is generally carried out with great thoroughness, though with porfeet politeness, and no article of luggage is allowed to escape unopened. One of the objects ehieily sought for is cigars, on whi 75
per rent of the estimated value is charged. Considerable iliftieulty
is also made about admitting firearms and cartridges. The customhou is now under European management, and it is on the whole
advisable to refrain from an attempt to facilitate matters by balishish (p. Hi).

() n all goods exported, one per cent of duty is charged on the
estimated value, and luggage is accordingly examined again as the
traveller quits the country The exportation of antiquities is strictly
prohibited (p. 25). if luggage be forwarded across the frontier,
the keys must be sent with it; but, if possible, the traveller should
always superintend the eustom-house examination in person.

(A). Consulates.

Consuls in the East enjoy the same privilege of exterritoriality
as ambassadors in other countries. A distinction is sometimes made
between professional (/eonsules missin and commercial consuls,
the former alone having political functions to discharge; and there
are consuls, vice-eonsnls, and consular agents, possessing various
degrees of authority. In all cases of emergency the traveller should
apply for advice to the nearest consul of his country, through whom
the authorities are most conveniently approached, and who will
effectually watch over his interests. It is therefore very desirable
that travellers should take the earliest possible opportunity of entI-ring into friendly relations with these most useful oftieials, and
the more so as access to some ofthe principal objects ofinterest cannot
he obtained without their intervention. The kavasses, or consular
"flleers, also render important services to travellers, for which they
expert "fee, although not entitled to demand payment.
