we drive to Bedrashen and ride thence to Sakkara (p. 371), quitting the
latter at 2 p. m. we next ride along the edge of the desert to the pyramids,
which we reach about 1% hr before dusk The drive back from the

Near Kagr en-Nil we cross the Nile by the great iron bridge
o. 308). 011 the opposite bank we leave Gazirch o. 328), to
which an avenue leads, on the right. The greenhouses and gardeners' dwellings belonging to the Khedive also lie on the right.
To the left of the road leading across the island we observe the
lofty chimney of a water-pump, and the private gaS-manufaetory
of the Khedive. A second and smaller bridge then crosses the
other branch of the Nile, which was long choked with mud, but
which has lately been re-opened, so that the name of Gezireh
(i. e. island) is now justifiable (comp. p. 329). Immediately
beyond the bridge rises a Karahol (Turk.'guard-house'), the road
passing which leads to the railway station of B13151; ed-Dakrih
o. 371) and to a palace of Tush" Pasha. The road to Gizeh, which
is well kept and is shaded by beautiful iebbek trees, diverges to
the left by the second bridge. Near the entrance to the vieeroya ]
gardens of Gizeh, which are bounded on the S. by an extensive palace, are waterworks for the raising and distribution of the water,
immediately beyond which the road turns to the right. On the left
rises the high wall enclosing the property of the Khedive, and on
the right are palaces of the princes Husén and Hasah Pasha (none
of which are shown to visitors). After crossing the Upper Egyptian
railway, the road leads between the railway ton the left) and the
canal (on the right) towards the S to the private station of the
Khedive, and thence to the right, direct towards the Pyramids.
Or we may follow the better road along the Nile, keeping the wall
of the palace to our right. The now decayed village of Gizeh
(which was a railway-station until recently, but has ceased to be
so since the opening of the Bt1lstlr ed-Dalcrttr station), which we
