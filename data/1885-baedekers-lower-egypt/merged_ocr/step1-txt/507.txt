uninteresting little town, consisting of a densely packed mass of
low mud-hovels tno inn ]. The ruins of the ancient Sebannytus,
the site of which is now occupied by Semmemld, are also insignificant. The old Egyptian name of Sebennytus was Teb- -cn- mater

and where, according to the myth, Horus gained one ofhis victories
over Seth. The figure stamped on the coins of the province
