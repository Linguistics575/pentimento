Place Ezbekiyeh CPI, c, 5:), or simply the Ezbek? yeh, which
is named after the heroic Emir Ezbek, the general of Sultan
Knit Bey (p. 968 ], who brought the general and son-in-law of llajesidI. asa captive to Cairo. A mosque was erected here in honour
of his victory; and, though the building no longer exists, its name
still attaches to the site. This was once the focus of the Oriental
traNe of Cairo, but the native industries have gradually to a great
extent been absorbed by Europeans. The principal hotels, several
of the consulates, numerous cafes, palatial dwelling-houses, handsome shops, and the theatres are situated in this magnitieentplaee,
in the centre of which are Pleasure Grounds, with the luxuriant
vegetation peculiar to the marvellous climate of Egypt. The gardens afford a delightful promenade, especially in the afternoon,

is made for admission. An Egyptian band, which generally performs European music, plays here daily from 5 to about 8 p.11).

a fine view, and below it is a pretty grotto. The garden was at first
visited almost exclusively by Europeans, but it is gradually becoming the fashion for Arabs to send their veiled wives and their
children to promenade here, while the Europeans of the better
classes now treat it with unreasonable neglect. The trees, shrubs,
and flowers thrive admirably, the greatest show of blossom being
