Fiitimite Khamt tn. 102), the modern city of Cairo was built adjacent to
the old. The new city was founded by Jaime, the general of the Fi! mite
Khalit' Mu'ire, to the N. of Ehlihetiyn, as a residence for the khalit', and

together with the citadel itself, to be enclosed by a wall, 29,000 ens in

extended and magrtifieenily embellished. According to the Arabian historians, the most enterprising of these sultans was Nohammed en-Ntlsjir
N. 1341), who constructed numerous handsome edifices both within and
without the citadel, as well as canals and roads, thus converting the ruins
and sand-hills in the environs into beautiful Suburbs, with palaces and
pleasure-grounds. At that period, however, Cairo was fearfully devastated
by the plague, as it had been on two former occasions fin 1067 and 1200),

they themselves were so ill-treated and oppressed, especially in the reign
of Sultan Sale ]; (1351-51), that many of them are said to have embraCcd
