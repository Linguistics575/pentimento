shows some interesting Byzantine carving and mosaics in ivory, now
blackened and discoloured with age. Many valuable art relies have
been removed from the church since 1860. A number of old pictures
of saints which still remain, some of them 011 a goldground and with
well preserved colours, possess no artistic value. Above a door to
the right of the high-altar, engraved in wood, is the Coptic inscription,'Greetings to the Temple of the Fathert' Below it is a modern Arabic inscription with the date 1195. - This church may be
regarded as the original model of all the older Egyptian-rl-tine
churches in which the Coptie Christians now worship'.

The basilica consists of a nave and aisles. The tribune, the two side
chapels, the sanctuary, and the parts corresponding to the senatorium
and matroneum of northern basilieas are raised a few steps above the
level of the have and aisles, and are almost all as high as the nave,
while the aisles are provided with galleries.
The nave and tribune
have open roofs, that of
the latter being supported by elliptical
beams, and both being
probably of later: date
than the church itself.

surmounted by an Arahian dome, while the
