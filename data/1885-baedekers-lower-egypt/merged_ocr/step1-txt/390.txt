Egyptian monuments which bear the names of their founders date
from the time of Sncfm, who formed a link between the, 3rd and
4th Dynasties. That monarch was the immediate predecessor of
I1hu/'u Cor Chapman 3007, 43),
and Jfenlcuurt Cor Mtjcerimrs, 3043 -20), the builders of the Great
Pyramids (romp. pp. 86, 8-141 347). It continued customary to
build pyramids down to the 12111 Dynasty (B. C. 2300); but at a
later period, especially after the residence ofthe Pharaohs had been
removed from Memphis to Thebes, the kings, as well as their subjects, seem to have preferred roek-tombs to manseiea above ground. t
The Greeks were much struck by these monuments when they first
came to Egypt, and even erected similar ones themselves (as at
Cenehreee), akin to the Magtaha: UL 370). The Pyramids are
therefore invariably described by Greek travelle.rsH, as well as by
their successors, and they afterwards became famous as one of the
greatest wonders of the world.

Herodotus, though ill informed as to the history of the founders
of the Pyramids, describes the structures themselves admirably,
like everything else he saw in person Cheops (I (hutu ], according to his statement, was addicted to every kind of vice; he closed
the temples, prohibited the offering of saerifiees, and oppressed the
whole nation by exacting compulsory labour. Some of his suhjerts
wore employed by him in quarrying block: of stone among the Arabian mountain, and in transporting them to the Nile, others had
to ferry these stones across the river, while others again conveyed
them to the base of the Libyan mountains ff.'Now there were
about 100,000 men employed annually for three months in each of
these tasks. They took ten years to make the road for the transport
of the stones, whieh, in my opinion, must have been almost as
laborious a task as the building ofthe Pyramid itself; for theieugth
of the road amounts to flve stadia (1017yds. l its breadth is ten
fathoms [ F10 ft/), and its height, at the highest places, is eight
fathoms (481%.), and it is constructed entirely of polished stone
with figures engraved on it Hi Ten years were. thus consumed in
making this road and the subterranean chambers on the hill ooenpied by the Pyramids, which the king caused to be excavated as
his brrriM-plaec, having made it an island by conducting a canal
thither from the Ni (As to this erroneous statement, see p as.)
