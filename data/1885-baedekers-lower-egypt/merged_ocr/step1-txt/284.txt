254 Route 3. CAIRO. Brim ars.

Fahhe'tmi (literally, eoal-market; Pl. D, l), the bazaar for wares
from Tunis and Algiers. We first observe drug-stalls, and then
magazines of light-coloured woollen and other stuffs, which, however, are imported from Nimes and other places in Southern France,
being, new seldom or never manufactured at Tunis.

Pursuing the same direction, parallel with the Ful-Ghiiriyeh
street, and passing a number of shoemakers' stalls ChawOtshi), we
come to a broader covered passage (exactly opposite which is a
modern okella, presenting no attraction), which we follow to the right
for a few paces, and then take the iirst lane to the left. At the end
of this lane lies a more open spot where undressed wool is exposed
for sale. Lower down, a little to the left, we reach the Sukkariyeh,
or bazaar for sugar, dried fruits (nuki) and similar wares. Adjoining it is the Gami' el-Jluuiyuzl fp. Qt?) now undergoing restoration, while facing us, at the end of the street, rises the handsome
Bc'ib ez-Zutc2leh (see p. 273), or Jlutawelli. Uppositc the outside
of the gate is a house with a large grated window, and in the Corner is a column built into the wall, at which executions by strangulation formerly took place. In a straight direction we next enter
the Shoemakers' Bazaar, formerly a school, an interesting building,
the tirst story of which overhangs the lower and is home by large
brackets. The large gateway (on the right) is still preserved; part
of the interior has been altered, while the rest of it is in a dilapidated condition. - The same street then passes the stalls of the tent
and flag-makers, and leads to the Boulevard Jfolutmmerl'Ali Cp) W) ),
at the W. end of which are the mosques of Sultan 1) asan (p. 260)
and "nlinished. On the
left, before this last is reached, is the entrance to the once celebrated Siiig es-Seli√©ha "E, 2), or bazaar of the annourcrs. now
reduced to three or four miserable stalls, where European weapons
are sold. Keeping to the left, we traverse several crooked lanes
and reach the Sebil Mohammad'Ali (see below) in the Ghiiiiyoh
street. This last digression, however, is uninteresting.

We return from the Shoemakers' Bazaar to the P, ib cz-Zn/leo,
before reaching which we pass the unattractive Saddlers' Bazaar
(soy es- Suriiyfyeh), and a police-office at the corner to the right.
We now follow a broader street, the first part of which is called
the Sukkariyeh (see above). Beyond the Sebil Mohammed'Ali this
street is named El-Ghiiriyeh from the mosque erected by Sultan
_ -hi'n-i (p. 274), the small minaret of which, with its domes,
rises nearly in the middle ol' the street.

We follow this street in a straight direction nearly as far as the
post of the (lower) sentry on the left, a little before reaching whom
we turn to the right into the Shl.r es-stdin, or bazaar for wares
from the.,% ilin, cousisting of chests, gum, Mms-palm nuts, illtanned tiger skins, etc. (see p. 236). Farther on, in a straight
dir (inn. an: the stalls of the Booksellers and Bookbinders.
