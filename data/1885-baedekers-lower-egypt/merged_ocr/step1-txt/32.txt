fragment being cut off for each repetition of the offence, and the
delinquvnts are known as lturttmtvelt, or thieves. The horse and donkcy-shocs consist of plates of metal with a hole in the middle.
The CAMEL (for riding hew" n, in Syria del01; for baggage gemel;
those with one hump are the only kind foundherejisgenerally used
for the Mt. Sinai tour tll. IO) only, but for the sake of experiment
may be ridden on one of the shorter excursions from Cairo (e.y. to
the Putriiled r'orest or to IJelwinl, The patient'ship of the desert'
isalways surly in appearance, and though he commands our respect
newt w is our affeetion. Those only which have been properly
trained can be ridden with any comfort, the baggage-camels being
as unsuitable for the purpose as the ponderous Flemish cart-horse.
If well mounted on a tall and well trained begin, the traveller will
find that eansel-riding is quite undeserving of the vitnperation so
often bestowed upon it by the inexperienced (pomp. also ll, IO).







[ i ]. Dealings with the Natives. Dragomans.

The traveller, apart from his ignorance of the language, will
find it exceedingly diftieult to deal with the class ot'people with
whom he ehielly comes in contact. The extravagance of their
demands is boundless, and they appear to think that Europeans
are absolutely ignorant of the value of money (p. 1 (3). livery attempt at extortion should be firmly resisted, as compliance only
makes the applicants for balchshish doubly clamorons. Payment
should never be made until the service stipulated for has been
rendered, after which an absolutely deaf ear should be turned to
the protestations and cutreaties which almost invariably follow.
Thanks, it need hardly be said, must never be expected from such
recipients (comp. p. IO). Even when an express bargain has been
made. and more than the stipulated sum paid, they are almost sure
to pestrr the traveller in the way indicated. When no bargain has
been made, the fees and prices mentioned in the Handbook, all of
Which rm- ample, should bepaid without remark; andif the attacks
which ensue are not silenced by an air of calm indifference the
traveller may use the word ro) or inlshi (comp. p. 204) in a quiet but
derided and imperative tone. The Flgyptians, it must he rememherwi, occupy a much lower grade in the scale of civilisation than
I Inst of the western nations, and cupidity is one of their chief failings; but ifthe traw ller makes due allowance for their shortcomings,
and treats the natives with consistent iirmness, he will flnd that they
are by no means destitute of fidelity, honesty, and kindliness.

? sotss ithstamling all the suggestions we have ventured to offer,
tht- traw-llvr will to SUIIIC extent have to buy his experience. In
must i' s the rssvrehargvs to which he will be exposed will be
ronyarrstivrly truling; but if extortion is attempted on a larger
seal, he had lwttur refer the matter to his consul.
