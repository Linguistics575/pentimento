the busy harbour itself now engrusses the whole attention. The steamer

sanitary inspcetion is over, the lmatmen swarm wildly on deck like a
piratical crew, eager to secure a fare, and reminding the traveiler of a
scene from Meycrheer's Africainc. In the midst of this hustle and confusit n the following Arabic words may he found useful: - Law, come;

Having sufficiently surveyed the novel and picturesque scene, the t
traveller engages a boatman to convey him and his luggage ashore, or, I
especially if ladies are of the party (see below), he gets one of the hotel
agents to manage everything for him. Befure leaving the vesselhe should
keep a watchful eye on his luggage, and see that the whole ofit is placed
in the boat which he himself is going to use. As soon as the boat is
clear of the steamer the Arab hoists his sail, for he never rows unless
absolutely obliged, and steers for the custom house. Any importunity as
to the fare may be simply answered with -'tayyib, yalla' (all
right, make haste).

() n reaching the landing-stage of the Custom- 1101159 W I 21), the traveller is first conducted to the passport-office (to the left, in the passage),
and gim up his passport, which is afterwards restored to him at the
consulate at Alexandria, or he may have it sent after him to Cairo.

Meanwhile the luggage has been landed, and the traveller, if alone,
and with ordinary luggage, pays the buatman'We Ir, or for 2 persons

the luggage into lhe c stun) house and afterwards to a cab expects 25e.
for each package. All these rates of payment are amply remunerative,

in the traveller's ears throughout the whole of his jouL-LLe ngs in the
East and even long afterwards.
he customhuuse examination is generally pretty rigorous, the articles chiefly sought for being tobacco, weapon », and diamonds. No fee
need be given to the oflioial.

As already observed, it is preferable, especially when ladies are of
the party, to secure the services of one of the hotel agents, who relieves the traveller of all tmuhle, pays hoatmen and porters, and assists
in clearing luggage at the eustom-houge. In addition to his outlay, he
receives a fee of 21/2fr. from a single traveller, or more in proportion
for a party. The principal hotels now send their own how to meet
the steamers. The traveller who wishes to ensure a comfortable
disemharkalinn may write beforehand to the hotel at'which he means
to put up, and desire a commissionnaire, a boat, and a carriage to meet
him. The usual charge in this case fur a party of three persons is: heat from the steamer to the eustom-house 5 fr., luggage-boat 2 fr., porter
