the earth and its history, it has yet, from a very remote period,
formed the highly revered vestibule of all the temples of the trivilized world'. (0. Bitter.) The Mount Sinai group, with its masses
of granite, forms the S.W. half of the peninsula, while the long
limestone range of Jebel et-Tih, beginning at the Isthmus of Suez,
first turns to the S.E., and then sends forth a number of ramifieations to the E. and N.E. The Sinai group forms a watershed from
which weidis descend to the E. and W., i.e. to the guifs of Suez
and'Ahaba respectively; while the'River of Egypt', which is mentioned as the boundary of Palestine in the Bible, and is now the
Wadi e1-'Arish, descends from the Jebel et-Tih towards the N. to
the Mediterranean. Those parts of the Tth Mountains across which
our route lies rise to a moderate height, and are formed of limestone,
chalk, and, to a smaller extent, of sandstone.

Tue MOUNT SINAI GROUP.'This huge range, composed of primeeval gneiss
and granite, or, in more precise geological terminology, of colourless quartz,
flesh-eoloured feISpar, green hornblende, and black slate, rising in majestic
and precipitous masses and furrowed by vertical clefts, extends 1mm

undergone no geological change, but have reared their summits above
the ocean from the beginning of time, unaffected by the transitions of
the Silurian or Devonian, the Triassic 0r ehalk periods. At the base
only do these venerable mountains show any trace of alteration. Thus

and so in recent times produced a coast district; while towards the N. the
sea during the chalk period, has formed the limestone plateau of the desert

Sinai to Mount Lebanon. The crystalline masses of the Sinai chain,
which extend from N. to S.fur a distance of about M) M., exhibit no
great variety. The whole range 1011111 .1 central nucleus traversed by

Inhabitants. Amid the sterile mountains and valleys of the peninsula,
some 4-5000 Beduins manage to obtain a livelihood. They generally have
remarkably slight figures, and regular, sharply marked features. The
boys, who follow the camels and wait upon travellers, are particularly
graceful and engaging; the men are employed in conveying millstones,
charcoal, and other wares to Egypt; they supply travellers (who are
chiefly pilgrims of the Greek faith) with camels, hunt the mountain goat,
celebrate festivals, and, in the W. part of the peninsula at least, rarely
indulge in the sanguinary feuds which the different tribes formerly
waged with one another. These occupying the E. and the N.E. of Arabia
Petreea are of a wilder and more warlike character; the boys and girls,
and occasionally the speckled sheep, which
call to mind the artifiee resorted to by Jacob tn the meagre pastures in
summer, while the women remain in the tents to look after their children
and household work. In the best watered parts of the peninsula, the
Beduius have built themselves huts, and cultivate plantations of dates, the
must productive of which are in the wiidi Firkin (p. MD), and in the neighbourhood of Tur 1111 the Red Set In all other districts the inhabitants
live in tents: The Tiiwara are good-natured, honest and generally of

1-.1's in Egypt, and the name of'Iie1litlp' is used by them as a term of
reproach. They do not practise polygamy, and their families are generally nnall. The young Beduins have opportunities of seeing the girls of
their tribe unveiled, while tending their herds on the mountains, and
of forming, attachments to them uruuriages frum iut11netion are there
