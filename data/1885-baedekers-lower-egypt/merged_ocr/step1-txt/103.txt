ANIMAL KINGDOM. 81



Mation, it descends to the vicinity of the Delta. Crocodiles rue mm? »
times seen fast asleep, often with widely opened jaws, basking in the
sun on flat sandbanks "on the ends of low islands, to which they most
frequently resort after cool nights. In Egypt, however, where it is oftener
hunted than in more southern regions, the emeudile is generally too
wary tn be caught napping, though it sometimes becomes entangled in
the nets and ram .t prey to the mhenneh. The Arabs of the Nina", who
eat the flesh of the reptile and prepare a kind of musk front its glands,
frequently angle for it with large hooks baited with meat.

It is seldmu worth while to fire at crocodiles when swimming, 113
they usually disappear in the turbid water, even when mortally wounded.
The sportsman should therefore endeavour to get within range of one of
these munster saurians when on shore. As they always keep within easy
reach of the water, they are occasionally observed on the banks of the
river by the traveller navigating the bile, in which use the should he
apporaryhed in a small boat as noiselessly as possible. Success is must
likely te he achieved in cases where the haunt ot' the reptile is known,
sh that the sportsman may lie in ambush at some convenient spot in the
vicinity. Unless, as rarely happens, the first bullet kills the animal on
the spot, it generally eontnves to find its way back to the water, and
thus effects: its escape.

Another meta" of greet erel', and extremely rapid in its movements, is the JfotoitoefAvab.u-0, which attains a length of (I.. 5 ft.., and
derives its name from its supposed habit of giving warning of the ayproeeh of a crocodile.

111. OTHER MAMMALIA AND BIRDS. Although not indigenous to
Egypt, several varieties ofApes, which are imported from the S. andW.

Besides the BIRDS indigenous to Egypt, there are, as already mentinned. a great number which winter there, while others merely pass
through the country when on their way to other regions. Ahnut 3b'0 diffcrem species heve heeu ertained th occur in Egypt, but we shall
