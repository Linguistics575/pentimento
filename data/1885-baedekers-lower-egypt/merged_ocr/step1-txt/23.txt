(2). Expenses. Money.

EXPENSES. The cost of a tour in Egypt, and in Oriental CDUntries generally, is considerably greater than that ofa visit to any
part of Europe, the reasons being that most travellers cannot eonform with the simple habits of the natives, that they are ignorant
of the language, and that special arrangements have to be made to
meet their requirements. The average charge at the hotels for a
day' s board and lodging is 15-11:) fr., without wine (compare p. t71.
The cheapest wine costs 34 fr. per bottle; English beer q -21/.a. fr.;
fee l/2-1 tn; the traveller's hotel expenses will therefore amount
to at least 20-30 fr. a day, to which must be added the hire of donkeys and carriages and the inevitable'pourboires'. The total Jay' s
expenditure should therefore be estimated at 30 fr. at least.CSteamboat- fares are of course extra, p.10).

The traveller whose time is very limited, or who is accompanied
by ladies, will also require the services of a guide orva1et- de-place,
or'dragoman, as they prefer to style themselves (P- -8 fr. per day).

111051111. A small sum of money for the early part ofthe journey
may be taken in English or French gold, or in English banknotes,
but large sums should always be in the form of circular notes.
These notes, which if kept separate from the'letter of indication'
cannot be cashed by a thief or a dishonest finder, are issued by the
principal London banks. -Fresh supplies may be forwarded from
England by post-office order, in sums not exceeding 500 fr.
