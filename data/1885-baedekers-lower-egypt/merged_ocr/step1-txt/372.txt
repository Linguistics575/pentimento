the centre of the garden is the long"kiosque, probably the finest
modern Arabian structure of the kind. The ornamentation, in east
iron, is in the Alhambra style. The plan of the building is slightly
irregular, as several apartments of an older kiosque have been incorporated with it. The handsome hall and the fountain were
executed at the Lauchhammer foundry near Dresden; they weighed
400 tons, and the cost of transport alone amounted to upwards of
30001.; the hall itself, exclusive of the expense of its erection and
decoration, cost 8000t. On the E. side of the kiosque are the reception chambers, and on the w. side the private apartments of the
Khedive, consisting of an ante-chamber (Jn. f, g), a small CPI, i)

The Shubra Avenue.

About 21/2 M. to the N. of Cairo lies the village of Shubra, on
the Nile, where a spacious garden and kiosque of Mohammad'Ali,
now neglected, are situated (permission to visit them obtained
through the consulate). The broad Shubra Avenue leading thither
is composed of beautiful sycamores and lebhek trees (erroneously
called Nile acacias; p. TO. This avenue forms the Rotten How, or
Avenue de Boulogne, of Cairo. The fashionable: of the town, both
Mohammedan and Christian, drive or ride here daily, but principally
on Friday and Sunday evenings. The scene resembles the'eorso'
of European cities, but is rendered far more picturesque by its
Oriental elements. The carriages of the slightly veiled ladies from
the harems of the wealthy, and those of the ministers, the consuls
and the merchants, follow each othorin gay procession, while the
"liwitous donkey forms a conspicuous feature in the busy throng.
