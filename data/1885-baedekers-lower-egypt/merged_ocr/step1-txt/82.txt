Geological Notice (by Prof. Zittel), (1) EGYPT PROPER. There is no
exaggeration in the often repeated saying that Egypt is the gift of the
Nile'. But for the bounties dispensed by the river, what is new the must
fertile country in N. Africa would he a wilderness of hare rock or sand.
With the greatest height attained by the inundation and the extreme
length of the irrigation canals uirrespuads yrveisely the line which "
vides the Sahara from the cultivated land. The whole of the alluvial
soil deposited by the Nile is an entirely foreign element in the geological structure of N. Africa, and its geological character is uniform and
easily determined.

The origin, and thickness nf the alluvium has already
been stated. The perpendicular, black, and furrowed mud-banks, which
often rise to a height of IL c. cumposed ordrsrinrrtp; uralle, straLT
of somewhat ditTerent eolmtrs, with thin layers nf sand "ecasionally intervening. In Lower Egypt the mud is rather more thinly spread over
the whole Delta, in the form of a blackish or reddish-brown laminated
mass. a few isolated spots only remaining uncovered,

Wherever the ground is denuded of its alluvium, apart from which
there is no permanent soil in Egypt, it is absolutely sterile; for in this
hut and dry country there is no winter, with its protecting mantle of
snuw. to retard the decomposition of vegetable matter, and to promote
its admixture with disintegrated rock, so as to form fertile soil. Owing
to the want of vegetation and moisture, without which the progress of
disintegration is reduced to a minimum, the surface of the naked rock
in Egypt. and the neighbouring deserts retains its character almust unaltered. The huge masses of dehris nhserved at. the foot of' the reeks in
the valley of the Nile, and particularly at the mouths of the wiidies, and
the curious isolated hills with which every traveller through the desert
is struck, cold not possibly have been formed during the present Mate
of the Egyptian climate. They prnve that at Fume pm-IIIIIIIIII: per'ot

The geulngist will find little to attract his attention in the alluvial
soil of Egypt; but III the'ia-roast, and in that part of the isthmus which
is intersected by the canal, there are several [ mints of interest.

On entering the harlmur "tAlexandria the traveller w'rll observe the
massive blocks ot' Mone frum the quarries of Make hf which the tluaye
are cumstructed. They ennsist of recent. tertiary, light-coloured, sandy
limestone, composed chiefly of innumerable broken fragments of conc, kind of ruck which extends far to the w. of Alexandria, and
pmhnhly ennstitutes the greater part of the lofty 12yrenmun plain. This
rmk forms thu huiltlinr, -stone generally used at Alexandria, and is also
emplnycrl in the harhuur-struetures of Port S a'id.
