to Sues. WADI LEBWEH. 10. Route. 521

To the W. of the tomb a hill, bearing a few ruins, rises from
the valley. We next pass (1/4 hr.) the entrance to the Wadi (hgtvilrtyeh
on the right, which is traversed by the route to'Ahaha (p. 518).
Opposite us, to the left, are several small towers, above which rises
the pointed Jebel Ferl'. The valley contracts, but after 1/3 hr. expands into a wide basin, bounded on the N. by a chain of preeipitous rocky slopes. Beyond this basin L40 min.), and beyond the
mouth of the Wadi Shim, on the left, the route traverses CIO min.)
the El-Watiyeh Pass (4022 no, enclosed by imposing masses of
granite. Immediately beyond it rises a stone, resembling an altar,
with a white summit, which the Beduins point out as the scene of
Abraham's saerifiee. A rock near it, in the form of a chair, is
called the Malc'ad Nebi Mitsa, or seat of the prophet Moses, which
he is said to have occupied while tending the sheep of his fatherin-law Jethro (p. 502).

At this point begins the lower part of the Esh-Shékh valley.
The character of the region becomes less mountainous, and the
route enters an undulating district. In less than an hour we reach
a luxuriant growth of tarfa shrubs, which extends for a distance of
about 11/2 M. (comp p. 500). Beyond these shrubs, on the left,
opens the Wadi I.fa.sah, which leads to the S. to the Nahb el-Héwi
(p. 501), and contains a number of palm- trees, Near the (11/4 hr.)
Wtidi JIaghiir/it, which lies to the right, is the valley of Esh-Shékh,

the sea-level. The imposing mass of Mt. Serbil now becomes
visible. hear the Cl hr.) Wadi e.t- Tan (right) are a few inscriptions

and opposite to it opens the broad Wadi Sahel; through which
the Nalib el-Wwi (p. 501) may be reached in 5 hrs. At this point
(2850 ft.) our route quits the Widi E-sh Shikh, which leads to the
(/23/4 hrs.) defile of El-Bawcsb o. 501) farther S. We ascend
rapidly to the N.W. in the western part of the Wtdi Sam", which
soon contracts to a gorge. Several valleys are now crossed, particularly the Wadi el-Akh'dur and the dei el-'Ishsh, as well as the
low ranges of hills which separate them; and in 13/4111. we reach
the long Wédi Berklr, lying at the base of the Jebel of the same
name. We now ascend this valley, obtaining at first a fine retrospect
of the Sinai group, the Jebel suiisa, and the Katherin, and reach the
top of the pass at the base of the pyramidal hill of Zibb el-Buhér

through which the route, now monotonous and nearly straight,
descends in less than 2hrs. to the foot of the Nahb Wtsdi Barak.
The Wadi Lebweh, which makes a bend here and descends to the
Wadi Firin, now takes the name of Wtdi el-'Alpir. Our route
ascends in 1/2 hr. to the top of the Nalib Widi Barak Pass, beyond
which begins the Wadi Bank, a wild, stone-besprinkled valley,
sometimes contracting to a gorge, and overgrown with remarkably
