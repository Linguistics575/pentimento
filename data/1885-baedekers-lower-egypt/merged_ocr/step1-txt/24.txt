4 MONEY

The current rate of exchange should always he ascertained from
a banker (pp. 200, 232; see also Tahle, p'T), and money should be
changed as rarely as possible at an ordinary money-ehanger's, at a
hotel, in the bazaars, or through a dragoman. For excursions in
the country the traveller should he provided with an ample supply
of small change (silver piastres, half-piastres, and copper coin), as
the villagers sometimes refuse to change money of any kind, and
the traveller may thus be very seriously inconvenienced. They also
frequently decline to take a coin if the inscription is worn away by
use, and in their examination of gold pieces they attach great importance to the ring of the metal. The traveller should also be on
his guard against eounterfeit dollars and piastres. A favourite ornament with Oriental women consists ofa string pf gold coins worn
round the head, or as a necklace, and coins with holes in them are
accordingly often met with, but they are very apt to be rejected by
the, natives. lu changing money, therefore, all these points should
he attended to. It need hardly be observed that money should always be carefully kept under lock and key, and that it should be
shown as little as possible, in order that the eupidity of the people
with whom the traveller has to do may not be amused.

is exceedingly puzzling to strangers. It should he particularly observed that at the shops and bazaars the prives are always tised in
current piastres, so that half the number of silver coins only has to

into frames for the btynetlt of strangers, and although their demands
are then somewhat raised, they are at least more intelligible. On
the other hand, in making small purchases, and in dealing with
country-people, it is more advantageous to keep to the reckoning
in current piastres, as the sellers are very apt to demand as many
francs as the amount of the price in piastres.
