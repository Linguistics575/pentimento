Bartel Â» - (1352-90), a car: an slave, Succeeded in raising himself to
the throne by setting aside _ iggi, a boy of six years, and great-grandson
of Mohammed en-Nasir. He was proclaimed sultan in Nov. 1382, being
the first of the Circassian Mameluke sovereigns (p. 101). His accession to
the throne, which had been the result of treachery and intrigues of every
kind, SO exasperated the emirs that they conspired against him and
dethroned him in June, 1389. In Jan. 1390, however, after having defeated his enemies, celebrated his triumphal entry into Cairo.
During his reign the Mongolians under Timur and the osmans under
Bajesid encroached 0n the frontiers of his empire, but L'avls6l.c was not
sufficiently energetic to resist their advances. He died in 1300.

These three mosques, with their three lofty minarets, present
an imposing, though not quite regular, facade. Opposite to them
is a modern sebil. Continuing to follow the Nahhasin Bazaar
(p. 256), which is generally enlivened by busy traffie, towards the
left, we come to another fountain with a School (P1. 91), erected
by a certain'Abder-d? aVndtn Kikhya, the founder of several religious
edifices (p. 291). An arm of the Nile is said once to have flowed
between the Tomb of lialat1n and this fountain.

Passing to the right of the fountain, we reach the beginning
of the Gameliyeh street, the seat of the wholesale trade of Cairo
(p. 257), the warehouses of which occupy the ohciias o. 257), or
inner courts, of this part of the town. The finest of these courts,
which present no great attraction, is the Okellrt fhtl1ksr Pasha
(PI. Tr), opposite the corner where our street bends to the N. The
entrance, with a kind of star-vaulting, and the court, with its
coloimades and mushrebiyehs, should be noticed. To the left, at
the corner of the lane by which we have come, is the Medreseh
Gametiyeh (P1. 321, with a late-Romanesque gateway, the original
form of which is scarcely now traceable owing to the restoration

Eumkim (996-1020), the third Fatimite Khalil', succeeded his father
'Aziz when scarcely eleven years old. His bigoted attachment to the Shi'ite
views (p. 153), and his intolerance towards the Sunnites, Christians, and
Jews, rendered him unpopular with most of his subjects of the upper ranks.
With the lower classes, on the other hand, consisting partly of Shi'ites and
partly af Sunnites, he ingratiated himself by his liberality, his religious
and unassuming mode oflife, his zeal for the discipline of his soldiers, his
rigorous administration of justice, and his persecution of the Jews and
