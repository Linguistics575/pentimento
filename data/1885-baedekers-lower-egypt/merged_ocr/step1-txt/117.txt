Artaxerxes IL, surnamed Mnemon.

The Persian king endeavoured to recover Egypt, but
Akhoris, the successor of Naifuurut, threw obstacles in his
way by supporting his enemies, particularly Euagoras, the
tyrant of Salamis in Cyprus, and by improving the defences
of his country.

Naifuumt (Ne epherites) 11., the successors of Akhoris,
reigned for short periods only.

N ekht- hor-heb (Nectctnebus f.), however, the next native
monarch, a Sehennytie prince, the founder of the 30th
Dynasty, completed the warlike preparations of the Egyptians, and entrusted the chief command of his troops to
Chabrias, an Athenian general, who signally defeated
Pharnahazus, the Persian general, at Mendes.

Persian 1'hamicia, supported by a body of Greek allies.
During his absence his nephew Nehht-nebf (Neclanebus II.)
usurped the Egyptian crown, but was defeated by Artaxerxes Ill, and driven into Ethiopia. Egypt 110W surrendered

Gmnicus L331), and at Tssms C333), and captured the Philistine town of Gaza, marched to Pelusium, and was received
with open arms by the Egyptians, who regarded him as their
deliverer from the Persian yoke. He tolerated the native
religion, visited the Oasis of Ammon, and founded Alexandria (p. 207), which, under the Ptolemies, became the great
centre of Greek culture and of the commerce of the whole
world.
