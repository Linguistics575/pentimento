admixture of negru hluud imparts its untnistukaltle stamp to the features
of the inhabitants. There are no Coptic settlers m t c 111., but they
are sometimes temporarily met with there in the capacity of merchants
or government clerks; and Europeans me still more rarely encountered.
The. population of the nuses ls comparatively small 11 (1111-ge11, according
to Schweinfurth, possessing 6310 souls; according to Iluhifs, Ir0khel

auspicious era may new be in store for these isolated communities if
they follow the example set by the inhabitants of 115mm by sinking
fresh wells and thus extending their territory. As a rule, even in the
most favourably circunrstaneed oasis of Daikhe ], the physique of the
population is poor and stunted, owing partly to their almost exclusive
vegetable diet (of which Prof. Virchow has found evidence in the condition
of the teeth of skulls front the ancient tnmhs nf Dttlchelj, and partly tn the
unhealthiness of the climate. 111a early 111 1111 111 11111, and also during the 0ominatiun
ut' the Roman emperors, the oases were generally used as places of
banishment, partly because their isolation rendered escape well nigh impossible, and partly perhaps because the climate was expected to aggravate the misery of the exiles. The overplus of the water used for agricultural purposes forms a series of marshes, ponds, and lakes on the 11
line "and these last contribute greatly 111 the picturesqueness of the
landscape in Siwa, which is further enhanced by at number of isolated
rocky heights; but the "these watery tracts in summer
are very unhealthy. Within the last few centuries this am 1111.1 been
aggravated by neglect. and the artificial swamps required fur the vice

abstain from visiting the eases from the beginning of April till the end
of November, but in the winter months they may visit them safely.
With regard to the construction of the dwellings in the oases it may
be remarked that they all have more or less the character of townhouses. as, even at the present day, the unsafe state of the country requires
them to be strongly built in close proximity to each other. Instead of the
low hovels of the Nile valley. we therefore find in all the 11.1111 11111111111
"several stories in height. somewhat rudely built of mud (and sometimes of stone, as at Bahriyeh) and palm logs. A curious feature ofthese
towns (recurring in the other nases of the 1511111111 11111., as! for example,
in the famous commercial town of Ghadames, to the S.W. of Tripoli)
is the covered streets running under the upper stories of the houses,
and sometimes of such length as to be perfectly dark. As, moreover,
like most Oriental tiirreeis. they are generally crooked, it is hardly
prudent for a stranger to venture into them without a guide. The main
street of the town of Siwu winds in this manner up the rocky eminence
1111 which the houses are built. and the place is indeed in this respect

one of the most curious in the East.

As is usually the case with places lying at "distance from the miter
world, the guvernment of these communities is in the hands uf the most
respectable and wealthy memhers; and at Fariifra this paternal oligarchy
is under the control of nn government, Even at Siwu the Nudtr appointed
by the Egyptian goverment timis it difficult to assert his authority, and
it is only the interminable and sometimes hiumly quarrels uf the leading
parties of the LiGyeh am ] the Gharhin tuf whum the latter, as the name
indicates, are immigrants from the west) that afford him an opportunity

was always to a great extent paralysed by that of the obstinate shÃ©khs;
but after the repression nf the Betluin revolt. Ha'id Pasha succeeded
in firmly establishing the vieeregal authority in the naees also. Since
