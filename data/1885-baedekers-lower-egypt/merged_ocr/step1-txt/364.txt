circular, while others, particularly those in the apertures of the
wall, form anearly acute angle with straight sides. Horseshoe arches
also occur, and others are constructed in arbitrary and fantastic
shapes. The capitals display a great variety of Roman and Byzantine
forms, and some of them, not quite completed, in the ruined N.
eolonnade, were perhaps Arabian imitations of Ptolemaic models.
The baths and other buildings once connected with the mosque are
no longer traceable.

The colonnades 011 the W. side (that of the entrance) are now

The porous water-jars (Arabic { (1112271) used throughout the whole of

Mohanmtcti'Ali, and farther distant are the hills of the Mohattam

The road, which becomes had beyond this point, leads round
the ruined mosque and ascends heaps of debris. On the top of the
hill it divides. The road to the left leads back to the town, from
the houses of which the Mosque of Sultful IJasau (p. 5200) stands
