eller to complete this circuit of the bed of the lake, which is now dried
up. Recently, however, Mr. F.0npe Whitehouse, relying upon, the great
circumference assigned by Herodotus (II, 149) to the lake, of 3000 stadia
(reduced by Linant to 360) or about 335 M. (Pliny says 230 N.), and upon
measurements made by himself on the spot, ascribe: a considerably larger
area to the lake than Lina )", and maintains that it extended on the s.w.
to the "'ddi Haydn. It is not improbable that in ancient times nearly the
whole of the Fay1irn could be laid under water, so that even the Birket
eluiurin belonged to Lake Meris, but that the entire system was meant
for the watering of the Fay1'uu alone and not of the Nile valley or the
Delta. Considering that the bed of the lake must annually have been raised
by the deposit of Nile mud, it follows, that as soon as the raising of the
embankments and the removal of the mud were discontinued, the lake
must have become nnservieeable, especially after the lock-gates at e1Lah0n fell to decay, each opening at which as Diodorus informs us,
cost JO talents (i.e. about 113250131). The discharge of the superfluous
water probably ran through the Baht Bela 315., which has already been
mentioned o. 400). or through the wads Nezlelr (p. MU), both of which
fall into the Birket eHruruha, The ancient conjecture, that the latter
discharged part of its water into the Ea tra Cor, as Herodotus says, the
'Libyan Syrte0, was not an unnatural one.

A visit to the Pyramid of el-Lahnn or 11Uhisn is only interesting to
those who are desirous of convincing themselves of the truth of Liuant's
hypothesis, and to make the circuit of the boundaries of the old bed of
the lake (see above). The pyramid, which is built of Nile bricks, may he
reached from Hawitret el-Kaeab in 4-5, or from the Labyrinth in 3-4 hours.
It has been recently been opened by Fraser. The discovery of an alabaster altar with the name of Usertesen II. renders it probable that the
pyramid was built by that monarch. A smaller pyramid lies to theN E.
The remains of the ancient en1hankruents, which were tolerably well
preserved in the time of the Khalifs, are not without attraction. Those
who are interested in hydraulic engineering should also inspect the entrance of the Bahr Ytsuf into the Fayt1m,

About 1/2 M. to the E. of the pyramid of el-Lahiln, Mr. Flinders Petrie discovered a temple in 1880, and close beside it the ruins ofthe town
Ha-Usertesen-hotep, now called Kahun. The latter was founded by Usertesen 11 (12th Dyn.) for the labourers on his pyramid. Among the articles
found here were pottery, flint and copper implements of the 12th Dyn.,
numerous papyri of the same period, a statuette of Si-Sehek (13th mm),
a wooden stamp of Apepi, and a large wooden door of Osorkon I.

Gurob, 11/2 M. to the \V.S.W. of 11lahtsn and close to the edge of the
desert, owed its origin to Tutmcs UL, who built a temple there. Many
of the inhabitants were foreigners. Mr. Petrie discovered here fragments
of pottery of the time of Tutankhamon and Ramses IL, resembling the
most ancient potsherds found at Mycenae. The eofiin of Ameuturshm
discovered here, is now at Oxford. The pottery bears Egyptian stamps,
but also letters of the Cyprian,' Phoenician, and other alphabets.
