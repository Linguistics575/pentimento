With regard to the Greek and Roman writers on Egypt, see
p. 314. The Arabian historians are mere chroniclers, who narrate
, series of facts and traditions, and are entirely deficient in method
and the faculty of criticism. The following are the most important
writers on the general history of Egypt: - EI-M/ull (il. 05ir),
of Fostht; flirt et-Athh' (d. 12301), "Mossul in Syria; Ibn Mama »
(d. 1406), one of the most learned of Arabian authors, a philosophical historian, and chietly famous for the preface to his history,
which was printed at L'itlils, in four volumes, in 18138; Abulp'drt
(d. 1331), prince of Hanna in Syria. The following are authors of
important works on limited epochs of Egyptian history and of
valuable descriptive works: - El-Malcrizi td. LU2, at Cairo), the
author of a geographical, physical, historical, and political description of Egypt, and of Cairo in particular, printed at 11015115 in
1852; Abur-Muy/itin (d. l 169 1, the author of a detailed history of
Egypt from the Arabian conquest nearly down to the time of his
