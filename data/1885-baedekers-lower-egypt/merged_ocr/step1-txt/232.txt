has thus illled the old harbour of Pelusium with mud. The action
of this current also endangers the new harbour (Port Sail, p. 436),
and on its way towards the N. it has already choked up the famous
ancient ports of Ascalon, Sidon, and Tyre. Even Herodotus
remarked that the Nile mud rendered the water shallow off the
coast of the Delta; and it was doubtless a knowledge of these
circumstances which led to the selection ofa site for the city of
Alexander on the W. side of the mouths of the Nile.

TOPUGILAPIIY OF ANCIENT ALEXANDRIA. The site selected for the new
city, which the able architect Dinocraies laid out in the form of a
Macedonian cloak (chlamys), was in every respect a favourable one.
On the N. side it was washed by the Mediterranean, and on the S. side
by Lake Mareetis, which was abundantly fed by numerous canals connected
with the Nile The products of Egypt could he brought down by the
river to the city, and thence at unce shipped to any part of the Mediterranean. The island of Pharos lay opposite to the mainland.'Now Pharos',
says Strabo (B. C. 66 24 Bk. xvi c 6), who describes Alexandria in
the 17th Book of his Geography,'is a long-shaped island, almost connected
with the mainland, where it forms a harbour with two entrances. For
the two prmuontories thrown out by the shore form a bay, and between
these lies the island by which the bay is closed.... The E end of the
Island of Pharos is nearest to the mainland and to the promontory called
Lochias, and makes the entrance to the harbour narrow. This strait is
further narrowed by rocks. partly covered by the water, and partly above
the water. which cause the waves of the sea to break into surf as they
enter. The extremity of the island itself is also a rock washed by the
sea, bearing a tower beautifully constructed of white stone with many
stories, and named after the island. This tower was erected by Sostratus
of Clnidus'. - The tower mentioned by Strabn was the famous lighthouse
built in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, which was regarded by the
ancients as one of the wonders of the world, and gave its name of
'Pharos' lo all lighthuuses afterwards erected. It bore the inscription:
1110s, the Cmid phanes. 111 the gods who protect
mariners'. It is said by an Arabian historian to have Mood at the E
end of the peninsulanow called Burg ez-fhfer; and he describes its ruins
as consisting of a square substructure 110 ells in height, an och onal
second stnry of 60 ells, and a round superstructure nf 63 ells, or' "eils
in all, while its original height is said to have been 40D ells 1590 ft ].
'Tue ly entrance to the harbour', continues Straho (111. M ],'is also

The other, which has its entrance by the already mentioned tower of
Pharos, is the Great Harbour (comp. p. 203). The others are separated
from it by an embankment called the Neptustadium, and lie contignmis
to each other in the recess of the bay. The embankment forms a bridge
which extends from the mainland to the western part of the island. and has
two passages, bridged over, and leading into the llttrhmlr of Eunnstus. This
structure, besides forming a bridge to the island, served also as an aqueduct
when the island was inhabited. But, as it took the side of the kings in
the war against Alexandria, the island was laid waste by the divine Caraar,'
