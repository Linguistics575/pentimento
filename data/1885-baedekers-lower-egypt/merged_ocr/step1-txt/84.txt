The Nile has forced a passage for itself through this hard rock, exposing to view at places the beautiful red felspar crystals which it eenPains, and forms a wild cam tat Ass an. Near the cataracts are the

observe a number of unfinished gigantic obelisks, and columns half hewn
out of the solid rock.

sareophagi and sphinxes was obtained by the Egyptian sculptors. Near

(portido resse) so highly prized by the Greeks and Romans at a later
period, and used by them for vases, columns, sarcophagi, busts, and
mosaics. The granite quarries of the Gebel Fatireh yielded both building
stone and copper. Most celebrated of all, however, Were the emerald mines
of the Gebel Zebiira, situated on the Red Sea in the latitude of Selseleh.

This extensive range of mountains of crystalline formation, rising to
a. height of [ 1000le 01' which those of the peninsula of tSinai form a
counterpart, terminates towards the east in roof-shaped, stratified furmatiuns. At lirst. there occurs a eonsidcrable stratum of Nubian sandstone,
next to which we find a series of clayey and calcareous strata, identified
by Figari-Bey with the Triassic and Jura formations, probably erroneously, as the collection of specimens of the rock at lorenee shows that
apparently the chalk alone, is completely developed. These strata are
succeeded by extensive masses of limestone, belonging to the nummulite
formation, and stretching to the Nile. Among these last formations is
found the pale yellow, brownish, and snow-white alabaster, a kind of
limestone composed of nodulous masses, which was formerly quarried at
the ancient Alabasirum near Sin!" and still occurs on the Gebel Urakam
near Beni-tiui'ef. In the reign of Mehammed'Ali this alabaster was largely
used in the construction of his ala Islet mosque (p. 203), and it was extensively exported in ancient times fur the embellishment of buildings
and for sculptural purposes. Blocks of it are even found among the
ruins of the Oasis uf Amman.

These extensive mountains, with their numerous profound ravines
and boldly shaped masses of ruck, impart a most imposing character to
the Arabian Desert. This region is by no means so destitute of vegetation as is usually supposed; for, although without oases, it contains,
particularly in the N. part, a number of springs and natural cisterns,
which are filled by (5). Tm: LIBYAN lmsem'. This region again presents an entirely different character. It ennsists of an immense, monotonous. and stony table.

and the eases of Kluirgeh, Jriikhel, Farilfra, and Bahriyeh. Throughout
this vast area there occur neither mountains, nur valleys, nor even isolated hills of any considerable height; and there is nu trace of crystalline er volcanic formations. The surface of the desert rises in gradations,
each preceded by a broad girdle of isolated mounds, which have been
nhviuusly formed by erosion, the materials having been washed down
from the adjoining plateau. The whole of this stony and absolutely unwatered plain, the monotony of which is only varied by u few solitary
ranges of sand-hills, consists of nummulite limestone. Jn the direction

ravines, and oeeasitmally nearly 1000 ft. in height. The different strata
of the earlier nummulite formation, as well as these of the upper chalk,
