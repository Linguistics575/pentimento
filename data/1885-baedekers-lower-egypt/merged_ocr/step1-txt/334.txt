Ikasos Sphinx in black granite, from Tanis, the restored parts recognisable by their darker hue.

The head shows the coarse and foreign-looking features of the race
which oppressed Egypt for so long a period. An inscription on the right
shoulder, almost efTaced, mentions Apepi (Apophis), one of the last Hyksos
kings. hlerenptah, the Pharaoh of the Exodus, and Ramses II. subseqnently caused their names to be inscribed on the base, and Museums,
of the 21st dynasty, engraved his on the breast of the statue.

granite, with the name of the Hyksos king Apepi. - too. Torso

from the Hyksos period.

Two foreign-looking figures are standing before the saeriiieial tables,
which are lavishly adorned with aquatic plants fBasphttiv), iishes, and
birds. The features of the figures resemble those of the sphinxes; their
matted beards, their plaited hair, and the bracelets On their arms dir
iinguish them strongly from the figures on other Egyptian monuments.

the monument, was added at a later date.

In the arch above the proper inscription is a representation of Ptolemy J. Lagi (p. 96 ], before his accession to the throne. He is still styled
a'satrap' here, but the empty cartouehes adjoining his figure seem to
indicate that he is free to ascend the throne. On the left he is consecrat
ing to Horus, the avenger of his father, a piece of planted land a

and on the right he is presenting gifts to Isis-Buto, the tutelary goddess
of the cities "Pub and Top. The inscription extols the satrap Ptolemy

from the temples of Egypt, and who fixed his residence in the'Fortress
of' J., which was formerly called Ithakotis' (1.2. Alexandria).

whose worship had been abolished by the'Arch-enemy Xerxes'.
