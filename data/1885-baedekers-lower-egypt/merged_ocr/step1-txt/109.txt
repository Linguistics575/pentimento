On the coast of the Delta, which at this remote period was
most probably a very swampy district, densely overgrown with
marsh vegetation, and which was first brought under cultivation
in the neighbourhood of This, and afterwards around Memphis,
the towns of Tanis and HeraeleopoIis Parva had been founded at a

very early epoch by seafaring peoples of Semitic origin. They
thence penetrated into the interior of the country, where they
came into collision with the Egyptians coming from the south,
whose culture they adopted. At the same time, however, they
retained their independence under kings of their own, who during
the period of the Gth, 7th, and 8th Dynasties formed the 9th and
10th contemporaneous Dynasties of Heracleopolites, from the year

2601 onwards, and who ruled over the Delta and perhaps the

whole of Lower Egypt. The 11th Dynasty, which put an end to

the sway of the Heracleopolites, is called Diospolite, or Theban,
burin the estimation of the'Egyptians was not a strictly legitimate line.
