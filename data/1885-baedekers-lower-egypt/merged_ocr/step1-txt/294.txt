To the S. of the last is the Satin cl-Gt'uni' (PI. 10), or Anterior
Court. 01111105011 by vaulted galleries, in the upper parts of which
plain limestone has been used instead of alabaster. In the centre
is the Ijanefiyeh (p. 184), designed in the debased Turkish style.
On the W. side is the approach to a tower, terminating in pavilions
in the Chinese style, and containing a clock which was presented
to Mohammad'Ali by Louis Philippe of France.

A 1svgnilieent WVmw is obtained from the parapet at the S w.
od of the mosque, which is reached by walking round the building.
(The palace of the Khedive, fitted up in the European style, is
uninteresting.) From this point we survey the yellowish grey city,
with its countless minarets, domes, and gardens. At our feet stands
the mosque of Sultin I) aran. To the N. and W. are the windmill..
hills? and the green plain traversed by the P. To the W. in
the distance are the Pyramids, towering above the desert. On the
flat roofs of the houses we observe innumerable air-pipes, called
malhaf, known also by the Persian name ofudgir, by means of
which the cool north-wind is introduced into the houses.

The other mosques in the citadel 1111111111 he visited without special
permission (p. 2311). Many of the chambers have been diverted from their
original uses, so that they are not easily inspected, and are moreover in
a very ruinous condition.

The Gtimir tia1tilteddin Yi1suf (P1. (IO), situated to the SE. of the
Masque of Jlnhammed'Ali, was erected in A. D. 1171-98, in a style betraying the influence of Western architecture, and in many points resembling
that of a basilica. Here, too, the [ minted arch predominates. The openings
under the arcades are of the elongated Moorish form. The dome was
mice supported by nine magniiicent columns of granite, hut it 11.11 now
fallen in, the only remains ofit being the deeply sculptured pendcutives. As
in the case of most of the ether mosques, the columns have heen taken
from ancient monuments. The 11111111 is handsomely embellished with
miniature arcades, in the interior ufwhieh are rich arabesques. The eotl'ered
ceiling of carved wood is painted white and gilded, with a blue ground.
The 1111111111111 1111 still partly filled with tracery in plaster. The whole
edifice up to the roof is of solid masonry. The minarets, each ennsistiug of a cutie with a cylinder above it, are covered at the "with
slabs of green porcelain, and are encircled with a band of'Sullus' characters
in white 011 a brown ground.

Immediately tn the S.E. of the Mosque of Saladin is the so-called
Well of Joseph (111.27), a square shaft, sunk in the limestone rock to a
depth of 21% containing somewhat brackish water, which is brought
to the surface by 111e.11111 Jr" Iwo 521111 e111, one above the other, worked by
oxen halfway tlnwn the opening. Since the introduction of the stem1111111111 fy. 2 II, however, the well 11.1.1 lost its former importance. When

the Jews, that this was the well into which the Joseph of scripture was
