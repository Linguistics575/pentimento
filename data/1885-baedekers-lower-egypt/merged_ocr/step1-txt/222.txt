XI. Works on Egypt.

The traveller who desires more than a mere supcrfieial acquaintance with the land of the Pharaohs, the history of which is the
most ancient and in some respects the most interesting in the
world, should of course before leaving home read some of the
standard works on the subject, and also select a number of others

more necessary if the traveller is entirely ignorant of the ancient
and modern languages of the country, in which case he will find it
1liffiet1lt, if not impossible, to institute independent enquiries as
to its manners, literature, and art. From the appended list, which
might easily be extended, the traveller may make a selection in
accordance with his individual taste. Those indicated by asterisks
