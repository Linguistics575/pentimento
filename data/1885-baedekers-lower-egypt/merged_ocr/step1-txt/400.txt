Egyptologist, who was president of the Prussian expedition, made several
very important discoveries, and furnished us with much valuable information. He found no fewer than thirty pyramids which bad heen quite

of having explored the hurial places of Sal.itdira (pp. 378, 338), which
yielded him a rich spoil.

Ascent of the Great Pyramid.

EXTERIOR. The traveller selects two of the impnrtunate Bednins by
whom he is assailed, and proceeds to the N.E. corner of the Pyramid,
where the ascent begins. (Payment, see below. The selection of the
guides should properly be made by the shE-kh; but this is seldom done,
and even when it is, the traveller is still pestered by the others for
balcsh'lsh.) These strong and active attendants assist the traveller lo
mount by pushing, pulling, and supporting him, and will scarcely allow
him a moment's rest until the top is l" hell, As, however, the unwunted exertion is fatiguing, the traveller should insist on resting several
times on the way up. if So disposed. Ladies should have a suitable
dress for the Purpose, and a stool may be brought to facilitate their
ascent by halving the height of the steps. The ascent, may be made in
10-15 min, but, in but weather especially. the traveller is recommended
to take nearly double that time. As the blocks are generally upwards
of an. in height, the traveller will find the, assistance of the guides very
acceptable, though not indispensable. Persons inclined to giddiness may
find the descent a little trying. but the help uf the Beduins removes all
danger. Hoth in going and returning the traveller is importuned for balishish, but he should decline giving anything, until the descent has heen
safely accomplished. At the summit. of the Pyramid the patience is
again sorely tried by the onslaught of vendors oispueiutts antiquities and
dishonest ttioncy-ehangers, all purley with whom should be avoided. Those
who make a prulnnged stay on the top had better be provided with FullIIIIIricII and perhaps also with grey or blue spectacles.

INTERIOR. A visit to the interior of the Great Pyramid is interesting, but, though the guides represent it as easy and desirable, it will
be found fatiguing and far from pic. ant, The explorer has In crawl
and elnmher through law and narrow passages, which, at places,
especially near the entrance, are not above 3v; ft. high and 4 ft. wide.
The stones en the floor are often extremely slippery, and the close, air
smells strongly of batsf. Travellers who are in the slightest degree
predisposed to apopleeiie, 0r fainting fits should not, attempt to penetrate
into these stilling recesses.

For the ascent a single traveller usually takes two guides, lmt three
suffice for two travellers. For a visit to the interim each traveller is
accompanied by one guide. The customary fee for the whole expedition
is 21/2 fr. for each traveller, whether he has been attended by (me. two.
or three guides. The Iieduine are never contented with this sum, hut,
the remuneration is ample. The traveller7 however, if uot d istivd,
may give an addititmal gratuity of 1-2 silver piastres to each of his
guides. On no aeeountshould any payment he made to any of them un
