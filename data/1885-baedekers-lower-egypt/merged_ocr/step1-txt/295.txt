Ilegira by SnlC-mint tlie Mamelnke, afterwards Sultan Selim. The
architecture is a mixture of Arabian and Turkish, but the plan is rather
Byzantine in character. The mosque is small, but carefully executed.
It contains Cutie inscriptions, marble mosaics, and a mambar in marble.

Route from the Citadel to the Molaattum and to the Petrified

Forest, see p. 336.

On the W. side of the Place Méhémet Ali (p. 262) is the railway-station for Hclwéu o. 403). From this point a street called
the Salibch runs to the w., traversing the oldest, and now partly
ruined, quarter of Cairo, which was erected by the Tulunides (p.
102), and is almost exclusively inhabited by the lower classes.
About 4-10 yds. from the Place this street is intersected by another,
running from N. to s, the N. (right) part of which is called the
8tTfiyeh, and the S. (left) part the IlttglAyeh. At the beginning
of the Siufiyeh, on the right, is a new Arabian Girls' School, and
beyond it, on the same side, is the Tektyet el-v1faulatctpeh (PI. 36;
F. o, where the dervishes perform their dances (p. 239), with
a dome adorned with carefully sculptured arabesques. (This street
terminates in the Boulevard Mohammed'Ali.) At the corner
opposite the mosque is the recently completed Sebil of the Mother
of'Abbés Pasha CPI. 94), in marble, rich and effective in general
appearance, but lacking finish in its details. The large school
above it is hardly worth visiting.

We now proceed in a straight direction to the Place Seiyideh
Zinab, where we show our order of admission at the office of the
Waist. Visitors on foot or on donkey-back follow an attendant with
the key, who leads the way up the direct and somewhat steep path
to the mosque. Those who are driving return to the Sebil of the
Mother of Abbas Pasha and enter the Rugbiyeh street, follow it for
about 300 yds., and turn down a street to the right, in which, after about 130 yds. more, we observe on the right the
*iriunir ibn Tuliin (h 68). This mosque, the oldest in Cairo,
was erected by Abu'l-ehbbts Ahmed Ibn Tulun the independent
governor of Egypt under the suzerainty of Khalif Mitarnid (A.D.
870-92), in the year 965 of the Hegira (A.D. 879), on the once
fortified hill of lialfat el-Kebsh (pee p. 208),

Ahmed ihn Tinn, the founder of the dynasty ofthe Tulunides (p. 102),
was so Successful in war that he extended the boundaries ungypt beyond
Syria and as far as Mesopotamia, but was proclaimed a rebel from the
mambar of every mosque by the Abbaside khalif El-Mu'tamid of Baghdad
(see above), and fell a victim to disease in Syria in A.D. 884.

According to one legend the mosque occupies the spot where Abraham
saerifieed the goat (kebsh) instead of his son whence the eppellahon
l'at l Kehsh Ci, e.,'castle of the goat'). Another legend points to this
as the spot Where'Inah 5 ark ran aground On the 10th Moharrem
(p. 236), although the Muslims generally believe that this event took place
on Mt. Jtaili near 1101111 in 511-11 (see p. 143). According to a third
tradition the name is derived from the winding staircase which ascends
the still existing minaret (see below) in the form of a twisted ram's born.
