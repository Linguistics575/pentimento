shirt, and in winter a light-coloured striped woollen mantle, while
the Iiishurin and Iladendoa tend their large iloeks of sheep and
herds of camels in a half-naked condition, girded with aieathern
apron and wrapped in a kind oflrlanketfrnettyeh). All these'Ethio-.
pians' are Dolichocephali, with orthognathons skulls, and are renmrkahie tor their fine and almost Caucasian east of features, their
very dark, hronze-eoioured complexion, and their luxuriant growth
of hair, shading their heads like a cloud, or hanging down in numheriess plaits over their necks and shoulders, while in front it is
short and curly. Their figures are beautifully symmetrical, and
more or less slender in accordance with their means of subsistence,
and their limbs are gracefully and delicately formed. In other respects they resemble all the other children of the desert, as in the
purity of their complexion, the peculiar thinness of their necks,
and the premature wrinkling of the skin of their faces. Com...
pared with their bold and quarrelsome neighbours the Bisharin, the
Ahahdeh, who are armed with a dagger worn in a sheath attached
to the upper part of the left arm, or with a long, straight sword,
but never with a gun, are exceedingly gentle and inoffensive. The
Egyptian government has put an end to the old feuds between the
liisharin and the Ahabdeh by entrusting to the latter the superintendenee of the great commercial route through the Nubian desert
(from 1ioro1sko to Ahu lJammedl, and by placing the nine tribes of
the liishnrin under the jurisdiction of the chief shttkh of the Ahabdeh, who is personally responsible for the safety ofthe routes through
the desert, and is therefore obliged to reside in the valley of the
Nile. (IliSpresent headquarters are at the small village ofPmlytreh,
at the foot of the hill of Redesiyeh, opposite to Edfu.) The total
number of the Abahdeh amounts to about 30,000. The chief
shcilth whose dignity is hereditary, appoints over the principal villages a numberol'sub-urhiol's, who are appealedto asjndgesin family
quarrels which the head of the family has been unable to settle.

The dwellings ofthe Ahabdeh consist ofiow and miserable hoveis
unnstrneted ofstakes covered with ragged straw-mats, and placed in
groups of not more than 3-8 together. They also sometimes live in
eaves, like genuine Troglodytos, although exposed to danger from
snakes. Like the other liege tribes, they are elsiefly occupied as
shepherds and i3atnel-rlrivers. The wealthier purchase a little sorghum grain, which they eat either raw, or roasted, or in the form of
nnloavened cakes, but the poorer seem to havoarnarvellouspower of
sustaining life on hominopathieally minute quantities ofgoats' milk
and the game which they occasionally capture. The Hisharin nisolive
vxehissivvly on milk and a little meat, while the Arabian Bednins
of the North till the soil to some extent when an opportunity of-.
fers. A considerable number of the Ahahdeh and ltisharin who
live near the coast and possess no cattle or other property, subsist
precariously on the produce of the sea. They are not fishermen, as
