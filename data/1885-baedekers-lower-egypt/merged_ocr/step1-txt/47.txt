TOBACCO 27

While much caution and firmness are desirable in dealing with
the people, it need hardly he added that the traveller should avoid
being too exacting or suspicious. He should bear in mind that
many of the natives with whom he comes in contact are more
children, whose waywardness should excite compassion rather than
anger, and who often display a touching simplicity and kindliness

Cigar-smokers will find it very difficult to become accustomed
to the Oriental tobacco, but they will find tolerable cigar-shops at
Alexandria and Cairo, most of which have been established quite
recently. As a general rule smokers are recommended to carry with
them, both in going to and returning from Egypt, as little tobacco
as possible, especially if they travel by the overland route, as a
rigorous search is often made and a heavy duty exacted, both at
the Egyptian, and at the French, Austrian, and Italian frontiers.
Travellers returning to England direct, with their luggage booked
through, are allowed half-a-pound of tobacco or cigars free of English duty, or they may bring three pounds on payment of the duty
(ps. per Ib.) and a small fine.

(15-90 h. per ekha), which is out less regularly, and contains parts
of the stalk, is considered less drying to the palate than the TurKish. It is of two kinds, the ltttrthsi, or light-brown, and the gebeli,
or dark-brown, a mixture of which may be used. The latter, which
derives its colour from being dried in the smoke of resinous woods,
is known in Europe as'Latakia', from the region of N. Syria where
it is ehieily grown [ L5dikiyeh ], but that name is not applied to it
in the East. The native Egyptian tobacco [ dukhdn beledi, or ahhglur,
green tobacco) is of very inferior quality (about 15 piastrcs WELT?
