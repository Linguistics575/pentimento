exceedingly'. la a 1.11m passage the sacred record mentions the cities in
Gushen in which the Israelites were compelled to work at the tasks impulsed on them by Pharaoh. 11 :--'Therefore they did set
over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they
built tlu, Pharaoh treasure cities. Lastly, the first

Leaving Pi-hahiroth, they then'passed through the midst of the sea into
the wilderness'.

We thus find that the Bible mentions a considerable number of places belonging to Goshen, and as the sites of several of these have been
identified with the aid of the Egyptian monuments, we are enabled approximately to determine the boundaries of the district, within which
also lay Tell el- Yehiidiyeh fp. 408). Belhés 111.109), and Bubastis (p. MO).
That Geshen lay to the E. of the Delta there can be no doubt, as it was
situated between the residence of the Pharaohs and Palestine, and the
Scriptures make no mention of the Nile having been crossed. This province was afterwards called the Nomos Arabia, or Arabian meme, and
the ancient Egyptian Gosem is spoken of as one of the E. districts of
the empire. The name still survives in that of the town called K123 by
the Copes, and "11111 by the Arabs (the ancient I'lmcum, e11111p, 11.11511

The southernmost point of the triangle formed by the 111111 uf Geshen
was probably Heliopolis (Matariyeh), whence the district seems to have
extended in a narrow strip as far as BeleS. The S. boundary 1-1111 thence,
in the latitude of the present Fresh- Water Canal, as far as Lake I'iur
still. (111 the district was probably bounded by the Tauitie arm
of the Nile, on the N. by Lake Menzaleh, and on the E. by a branch of
the sa111e, as well as by the Balah and Timsiil.o lakes, which in ancient times were connected by aline of nyrtiiieatiims, and formed a kind
of moat behind the bastions erected for the purpose of warding "the
1111111113 of the warlike tribes of w. Arabia. To the S. of the district of
Goshen extended a desert tract intersected by ranges of hills, ramifying
from the hills which bound the Arabian bank of the Nile. These hills
generally run from w. to E. and attain their greatest height in the
rhtilta lite, which command the N. w. shore of the Gulf of Suez. It is
probable that the Jews, who settled in Goshen as shepherds, and afterwards appear as inhabitants of the towns in that region, were compelled
to assist in the cultivation of the soil, which seems to have attained a
high state of perfection at that period. Several records Written on papyrus by Egyptian offieials about that epoch are still preserved. They
describe the charms of the country in the most vivid colours, stating
that life there was'sweet', and that the soil yielded all kinds of Crops
in abundance. 111 a papyrus preserved at Leyden the writer, Keniamen,
writes the following report to his superior Hui, an important official
