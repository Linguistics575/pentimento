When the work of the day is over, the solemn and souorous cry
of the mneddin, summoning the faithful to prayer (see p. 147),
reverberates from the tops of the minarets; but much of the
busy street-traffie goes on till nearly midnight, and during the
month of liamad√©n it even continues throughout the whole night,
while the barking of hungry dogs and the braying of donkeys frequently form an additional interruption to repose. At a very early
hour in the morning the same scenes reeommenee, and on leaving
his hotel the traveller is tempted to believe that Cairo is celebrating a never-ending Carnival.

While perambutating the streets of the city the traveller will
frequently have occasion to observe the Schools (ktuttby, which are
open on the side next the street, and one of which is attached to
almost every public fountain. He will find it very amusing to watch
the efforts of the filo, or schoolmaster, in teaching his pupils with
the aid of admonitions and blows, while the boys themselves recite verses of the Koran with a swaying motion of their bodies,
bending over their metal writing-tablets, and yet finding time for
the same tricks as European sehooiboys. Unless the visitor has an
