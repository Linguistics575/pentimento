which consists of three sheltered basins in which vessels discharge
and load. The first of these, beginning on theN. side, is the basin
of the commercial harbour, the second is that of the quays, and the
third the Tassin Chetrif'. The last is flanked with handsome buildings, which were erected by Prince Henry of the Netherlands as a
dep6t for facilitating the Dutch goods and passenger traffie between
Europe and the colonies of Holland; on his death, however, which
happened in 1882, they were purchased by the English government,
and they are now used a military dep6t and barracks.

8. Towns of the Central and Northern Delta,

A tour in the inland and r orthern districts of the Delta, including a
visit to the towns of Bransylra, Damietta, and the exploration
of some of the ruins of towns near the embouchures of the Nile, is attended with considerable diffieulty and discomfort, with which the attractions are by no means commensurate. A week at least is required
for the excursion, unless the traveller confine himself to places lying
close to the railway.

Those who are unacquainted with the language, and propose tn penetrate into the interior of the country, should be provided with a dragnman
111- a servant (p. 131, a tent, and a cook, as there are no tolerable hotels
except at Tanta, anil Rosette. 1utrodaeti0ns should be ohtained through the consulate at Cairo to the consular agents at Mansura,
Rosetta, 1111115 Damietta, and to the shekh of the fisheries at Tanis.

As wet weather and cold nights are not uncommon in the Delta in
winter, the traveller should be well provided with warm clothing and
rugs. A moderate supply of provisions and wine will also be found useful.

DISPOSITION OF T111111. The railway traNe in the Delia has much increased oflate, so that the following tours can now be accomplished
with much less loss of time then formerly. The hours of starting and
the fares are so often changed, that it is useless to give them here,

The tour may also be made in the reverse direction, and some travellers will find it convenient to proceed from Tanis direct to Port Sa'id.
The journey itself presents little attraction. The chief characteristics
of the monotonous scenery are extensive and often remarkably fertile
fields, canals, and dirty villages surrounded by palm-trees.
