Korint once the property of the Sultan Elga Etgusfi, measuring 201,1 by
10 inches. is written in two different haudwiritingi, the larger being named
Thuluihi, and the smaller Neshi. The highest efforts of Arabian calligraphy
and illumination are also displayed in several Mughrebin HS and in a.
number of single leaves bearing texts from the Foriin or sayings of the
prophet.

The ancient Muslims bestowed the utmost care on these precious
copies of the Kori'w, and their descendants still entertain profound
veneration for the sacred volume sent from heaven. The library possesses
many other ancient and valuable MSS., but they are all entirely eclipsed
by these Masahif They possess, however, great interest for the Arabic
scholar, to whom they are willingly exhibited, and form the first collection of the kind in the world. The library is especially rich in numerous
commentaries on the Koran and books containing traditions of the prophet,
as well as works on the law of the four Muslim sects, particularly the
1Janefites and Shife'itest The library likewise contains a number of historical, grammatical, and astrological works, some of which are very
ancient, not a few being in the handwriting of their authors. Among
the poetical 1195. the most important is that of Nutanebbi, dating from
553 of the Hegira, with a commentary by Ibn Ginni, w he also wrote a
commentary on the [ lamasm A o1s., a titled'Poems of the Arabs'. dates
from the same year, and among the MSS of the Hamasa is a Mughrcbin m
Algerian work, written from the recitation of the best- informed persons',
and dating from 597. There is also an old MS. of the commentary of
Dlerzillri upon the collection of poems made by him. The fine 11S. of
Firdusi, embellished with many coloured illustrations, was presented by
the Shah of Persia. The above enunseration will convey some idea of the
valuable contents of the library, of which at present there is only an Arabic
index, though a French catalogue is now in course of preparation. The
printed books are less numerous than the MSS., and they are chiefly from
the 13mm; press. Some of the surplus copies derived from that source
have been sold by the library.

After visiting the library the traveller may inspect the neighbouring Dervish Monastery in the Habbanfyeh CPI. li; permission
must be procured from the minister of public worship). The monastery was erected in 1174 of the Hegira by Mustafa Agha, vizier
of Sulthn Selim. The round sehil is the most interesting object
in the establishment. The building possesses a large court; raised
considerably above the street, and containing a few trees. Around
the court are the cells of the dervishes, and adjoining it is a small

mosque. With regard to the dervishes see p. 150.
