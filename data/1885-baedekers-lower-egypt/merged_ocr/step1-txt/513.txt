bol occupied the fourth place in the first group. The third symbol in
the second group, a reed, according to his hypothesis, would be e, and
this again was confirmed by the two reeds in Ptelemaius, representing
the Greek diphthong he The fourth symbol in the second group, a curd
with a loop, was also, according to his expectation, found to occupy the
third place in the first. So, too, the square, representing p in the second group was found to correspond with the first letter of the first
group. The sixth letter of the second group, a bird, did not occur in
the first group, but was repeated in its proper place in the second. The
seventh sign in the second group, a hand, would be t, but the same letter
was represented in the word Ptolemy by a semicircle. This discrepancy
might have misled the deeipherer, had he not rightly conjectured that
two different symbols might possibly exist for the same letter, and that
the semicircle at the end of Cleopatra represented the Coptic, feminine
article t, which, as he afterwards found, is placed at the end of many
female names. The eighth letter in the second frame he took to be r,
and this letter did not occur in the first frame. By this process the nine
letters of Cleopatra's name, or ten including the article, were ascertained,
while the different letters in the case ot Ptolemy were afterwards verilied
by comparing them with the names of nth 3, and particularly with
