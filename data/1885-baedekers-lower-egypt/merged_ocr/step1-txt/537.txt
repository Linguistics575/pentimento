for each person, according to the requirements of the party, and the
demand for camels. The expense is proportionally less fur a large
party, but in this case, delays and differences of opinion are more likely

the Draguman Y. on the other, have mutually entered into the fulluwing

(It is advisable to lay down the whole route very precisely, mentioning also the valleys which have to be traversed, but the stages must of
course depend en the situation (if the springs. We may again mention
here that the Orientals, and the Beduius in particular, attach no value
whatever to their time, so that little or no cumpensatiun need be made
for delays.)

of good claret or Burgundy, and of Cognac, should also be taken by
