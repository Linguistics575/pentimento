Fm-ag (1300-rW2) hail scarcely ascended the throne (20th June, 1300),
as a boy of thirteen years of age, before the (139111112) smans began to threaten the
Syrian dominions of the Egyptian empire; and Timur (Tamerlane), in his
war against the Osmans, shortly afterwards defeated the Syrian emirs, who

owing to dissensions among his emirs he was obliged to return to Cairo

in token of his subjection. The death of Timur, however (18th Dec.
1103), saved Egypt from the risk of being conquered by the Mongols.
The, latter years of Farag's reign were constantly disturbed by the rebellions of his emirs, particularly Sh√©kh el-Na1yntidi Muaiyad (see p. 273).
