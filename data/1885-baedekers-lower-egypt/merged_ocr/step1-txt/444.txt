leads to the right, in a direction parallel with the main corridor,
but now built up, as it was in a dangerous condition. A little
beyond this point we reach the E. end of the main gallery (P1. B).
Iletraeing our steps for a short distance, we turn to the right, pass
over another sarcophagus which
blocks the way by means of steps,
and thus regain the door by which
we entered the vaults. The temperature in these subterranean
chambers, to which the outer air
has little or no access, is always
about 79Â°, that being the mean
temperature of Cairoi

Before taking our leave of this
extraordinary place, we may quote

when I penetrated for the first time, on
12th Nov. 1851, into the Apis vaults, I

was so profoundly struck with astonishment (hat the feeling is still fresh

thirty-seven centuries. Many travellers would think it terrible to live

here alone in the desert for a number
of years; but Such discoveries as that of the chamber of Ramses II. produce impressions compared with which everything else sinks into insigniOatuus, and which one constantly desires to renew'.

The "Maegan of Ti (260 paces to the N.E. of Mariette's
house; see Map, p. 378) is the most interesting and best preserved
monument of this kind [ camp p. 379) in the extensive Neeropolis
of the ancient capital of the primmval monarchy. It lies in an old
street of tombs, now covered up; and the surface of the soil has
