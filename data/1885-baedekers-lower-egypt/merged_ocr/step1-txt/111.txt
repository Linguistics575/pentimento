We learn from a papyrus in the British Museum that the
liyksos monarch Apepi demanded the cession of an important well from Rasekenen, the king of Upper Egypt (17th
dyn.) This incident gave rise to the outbreak of a war of
independence Which lasted for eighty years.

lIylssos (numbering, according to Mauetho, 21,000 men

capable of bearing arms) were obliged to retreat and to
seek a new territory, and most o'r' them accordingly settled
in S. Palestine. The successors of Aahmes penetrated far
into Asia, subjugated one nation after another, exacted

Seti I. (pp. 313, TN. r, 135,153_) undertook several campaigns
against the Aramaic tribes, who had formed a league
under the hegemony of the powerful Eheta Cor Khittim,
the Hittites or the Bible), and penetrated as far as the
Urontes. He erected the Memnoniurn at Abydus, and caused
a sepulchre to be hewn for himself in the rock at Thebes.
