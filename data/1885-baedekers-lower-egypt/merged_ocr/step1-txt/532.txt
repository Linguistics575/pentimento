'partly uncovered. The street of tombs, which is now accessible, presents the appearance of zthiil-side covered with masonry, inerusted with
stucco, and provided with ante-chambers. The mouth of each tomb is
towards the E; the leaning external walls are generally of Nile bricks,
richly embellished with the linear patterns which afterwards formed the
favourite decorations of the sides of the sareophagi (which were imitations of the tomh-tegedest The vestibule is in most cases celnperativcly large, but the inner corridors are narrow, slope downwards, and
are covered with representations in a remarkably simple and antiquated
style. The archaic character of the scenes and of the hieroglyphies
proves the great antiquity of these monuments. The inflnence of the
hicratic canon is already traceable here, but it does not appear to have
hampered the efforts of the artists as much as it did at a later age. The
admirably preserved colours are also less conventional than those seen in
later monuments.

The first open tomb which we reach from the s., was that of Prince

Q
(Erpa He) Nefermdt, who lived in the reign of King Teter (There

were 3 kings of this name, in the lat, 3rd, and 6th Dynasty). On the left
wall of the corridor leading to the tomh-ciiamber, we see the deceased
in a sitting posture, and on the right wall he is represented standing,
with his wife behind him. Adjacent are men and women presenting
offerings, as in the mastabas of T and Ptahhotep. The flesh-tint of the men
is red, and that of the women pale yellow, and this circumstance, espeeially in a monument of this early period, is important as tending to
prove the Asiatic origin of the Egyptian nobles. The features of the
persons represented are of the Caucasian, and not of the Ethiopian
type. Among the villages belonging to Nefermtt, which offered gifts,

there appears on the left the name of the district of R8: +

a district named that'of the white sow', which proves that pigs were reared
in Egypt as early as the time of Snefru. The pig in this group is Very

or'place of the plough g, the most ancient form of the plough is used
as a determinative symbol. The advanced condition of industrial pure
suits, showing that the Egyptians already practised the art in which,
according to Pliny, they afterwards excelled, is proved by the character
of the dress worn by the women represented on the right side of the
first passage, consisting of black and white cutton stuff, with pleasing
patterns on the borders. He tells us that they were not in the habit of
painting the materials for their dress, but of dipping them in certain
fhrids. They were coloured with boiling dyes, and came out impressed
with a pattern. Although the boilers contained one colour only, it is
Said to have imparted several difTerent tints to the stuffs dyed in them.

here, an entirely unique process was employed. The outlines were en.
