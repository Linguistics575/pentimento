STEAMBOATS. i)

TICKETS should never be taken at foreign ports through the medium
of commissionnaires Or other persons who offer their services, but the
traveller should, if possible, purchase them at the offiee in person. The
tickets hear the name of the passenger and the name and hour of departure of' the vessel. Return or circular tickets (to Syria and Constantinople)
and family tickets for three or more persons are generally issued at a
reduced rate, but no reduction is made on the charge for food. A child
of 2-10 years pays Imli-farc, but must share the berth of its attendant;
but for two children a whole berth is allowed.

LUGGAGE of 1Nr2201bs. is allowed to first-class, and of 85-1351bs. to
seeond-elass passengers.

EMBARKATION. Passengers should be on board an hour before the
advertised time of starting. At Marseilles, Trieste, and Brindisi the
vessels start from the quays, so that passengers can walk on board; but
at Venice and Naples passengers are conveyed to the steamers in small
boats, for which the charge at all the Italian ports is 1 franc or lira for
each person, including luggage. Good order is kept at these ports by
the police. Payment of the boat-fare should not be made until the
passenger and his luggage are safe on deck. Before the heavierluggage
is lowered into the hold, the passenger should see it properly labelled.

All complaints should be addressed to the captain. On board the
foreign steamer"; a kind of military precision is affected, and questions
addressed to the offie, ers or crew are apt to be answered very eurtly.
