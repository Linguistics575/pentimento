picturesque buildings of the Citadel are then tinted with a delicate
rosy hue. The grandest of all the burial-grounds of the desert forms
a noble foreground, the venerable Nile dotted with its lateen sails
tlows below us in its quiet majesty, and to the W., 011 the borders
of the immeasurable desert, tower the huge and wondrous old Pyramids, gilded and reddened by the setting sun. At our feet are
the Citadel with the mosque of Mohammed'Ali, the old aqueduct

nummulite limestone. The Greeks also noticed these curious fossils, and
llerndotus mentions the smallest kinds as being petrified lentils, of the
