TI V PREFACE.

Bfalmntrl Bey, Linant, Lopsz'us, and Kiepcrt, together with
tl e English and French Admiralty charts, and the map of the

neh expedition, so far as still serviceable; while numerous
corrections and additions have been specially made on the
spot. The plans of the mosques and the sketch of the Tombs
of the Khalifs have been contributed by Fran: Bey, the
architect. It is therefore hoped that the maps and plans will,
on the whole, be found the most serviceable that have yet
been published for the use of travellers in Egypt.

HEIGHTS above the sea-level and other measurements are
given in English feet, from the latest and most trustworthy
English and other sources.

The PRICES and various items of expenditure mentioned
in the Handbook are given in accordance with the Editor's
personal experience, but they are liable to very great fluctt1ation, in accordance with the state of trade, the influx of
foreigners, the traveller's own demeanonr, and other circumstances. In some cases the traveller's expenditure may he
within the rate indicated in the Handbook, but as many unexpected contingencies may arise on so long ajourney, an
ample pecuniary margin should always be allowed.

HOTELS, ete., see p. 17.

TRANSLITERATION. The vowel sounds of Arabic words
mentioned in the Handbook are represented by a, e, i, a, and u,
as pronounced in Italian (ah, eh, ee, o, and 00). The t used
in the Handbook is a contracted form of ti, and is used in
preference to it, as it exactly represents the usual prontu1eiation (re. that of the u in fate). The diphthong sound of ei is
rarely used except in the recitation of the Koran. Arabic
words written in accordance with this system will generally
be found to correspond with the forms used by German,
French, and Italian philologists.
