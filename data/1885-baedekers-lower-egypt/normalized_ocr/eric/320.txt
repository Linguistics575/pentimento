In the same street, a few paces farther to the 8., we observe on
the right the long Olt'cttu Kait Bay, with its carefully executed
gateway and characteristic ornamentation. The facade is built of
massive stone, and is tolerably regular, but the musln'ebiyehs are
of inferior workmanship and probably oflater date. The gate is
mounted with large iron nails. The ground--floor is vaulted, while
the upper floor has an open ceiling. The edifice was completed in
the year 877 of the llegira.

A little farther to the 8., projecting in an angle, is a public
fountain new in ruins, also erected by I_\'ait Bey. The shallow
niches, the upper parts of which are shell-shaped, are in the form
of fantastic arches.

Beyond this sebil is an open space. on the right side of which
is the "Tomb-Mosque ofKait Bey (p. 268), the finest edifice among
the Tombs of the Khalifs, with a lofty dome and beautiful minarets.

The Sahn el-G'ami' was once closed by a mnshrebiyeh
lantern, which fell in 1872. The rest of the edilicc has an open
ceiling, as in the case of
the mandaras (p. 185 ]. The
Dikkeh, in the form ofa bal-
cony, resembles that in the
mosque of 1Â§ait Bey adja-
ccntto the mosque of'l'nlun.
The details are very elab-
orately executed. Within
the mausoleum are shown
two stones, one of red,
and the other of black
granite, which are said
to have been brought from
Mecca by liait lley, and
to bear impressions of the
feet of the prophet. One of
them is covered with a
wooden canopy, and the
other with a bronze dome.
The mosque also contains
a finely carved knrsi for the
Koran. The whole edifice
