The New Town of Isma'iliya was begun about the year 1805,
when the thdive presented sites here gratuitously to any one who
would undertake to erect on each a house worth at least 30,000 fr.
within eighteen months. Host of the houses are architecturally
uninteresting, but there is a fair sprinkling of handsome buildings.

At the end of the) Iuski, on the left, is the small place named
Aluh el-Krldra (Pl. 0, 3). lt was formerly adorned with an eques-
trian statue of Ibrahim Pasha, but this was removed during the re-
volution of 1882 and is now in the magazine of the 1311151; Museum.
On the W. side of the place is the International Tribunal (P1. 99,
C 4; p. 7), beyond which is the Il'he'dtrc Francois (P1. 98 ]. 011
the 5. side of the Ezbekiyeh is the Opera House (H.713), and to the
right of it (WC) the ponderous New Hotel (Pl. a). Opposite, on the
\V. side of the Ezbekiyeh, is a large house belonging to Sign. Ma-
tatia, the banker, built in the Louis XV. style, and let out in quar-
tie1 .5 To the W. of the New Hotel are the German Church (Pl.10)
and the English Church (Pl.8 ], whicl1 still lacks its spire. Still
farther to the W. is the residence of M. Delort, the banker, in the
early Arabian style, the interior of which, partly fitted up with
relics from old Arabian houses, is worthy of a visit. The ministerial
offices and several palaces of the Iihedive including the Palm's
Abidin (Pl. 76 ] built in the form of ahorse--shoe, are also situated
in this new quarter of the city. Opposite the Palais'Abidin is the
Diurin el- W (cf, or government office fo1 mosques and other ec-
clesiastical property. The consulates are also all in this neigh-
bourhood (comp. p. 232' ]. Near the French consulate (Pl. 19; C, 5)
is the house of Count St. Maurice, in the Arabian style, now occu-
pied by the French consul--general. The palaces of the Egyptian
grandees are genemlly enclosed by high walls, so that only the roofs
are visible to passers--by. Some of them will be briefly mentioned
when we have occasiOn to pass them (pp. 12117, 341).

It need hardly be added that the traveller in search of Oriental
scenes will not care to devote much time to this modern and almOst
entirely European quarter, but will hasten to make acquaintance
with the Arabian parts of the city.
