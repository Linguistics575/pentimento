4'28 Router. THE SUEZ CANAL. From Suez

of the work, and fragments of monuments with inscriptions both in
the Persian and Egyptian character, have been found (p. 432).
Under the Ptolemies the canal system was extended. While one
arm led from Phakusa on the file to the lakes towards the S. of
Pelnsium. that is, direct to the Mediterranean through the connected
lakes of Balah and Menzaleh, another branch was now constructed
{ rem Lake Ilalah to the Bitter Lakes, into which the fresh--water
canal watering the scriptural land of Goshen also fell (p. 409). It
was thus feasible in the time of the Ptolemies to travel by water
from the Nile to the S. part and also to the N. part ofa canal,
which, like the modern Suez Canal, connected the lied Sea and the
Mediterranean in a nearly direct line. When Antony returned to
Egypt after the battle of Actium in B. C. 31, Cleopatra made an
unsuccessful attempt to convey her ships across the Isthmus of Suez
in order to escape with her treasures from Octavian. As, however,
it is very improbable that she would have attempted to transport
vessels of considerable size for so long a distance by land, there
can be little doubt that the canal still existed in her time, although
in a dilapidated and unserviceable condition.

The canal is said to have been restored during the Roman
period. Another canal, beginning near Cairo, and terminating in the
Gulf of Suez, the precise course of which, probably following the
earlier channel, is nowhere described, is said to have been called
the Amnis Trajanus, and was probably constructed during the
reign of that emperor (AD. 98-117). A canal of Hadrian is also
mentioned. It is certain, however, that the chief mercantile route
between the lied Sea and Italy (lid not follow the Nile and the ca-
nal thence to the Gulf of Suez. The Indian vessels of the Romans
touched at llerenike, a little to the N. of the tropic of Cancer, and
still more frequently at Leukos Linlen, the modern Kogt'l', or at
)'lyos llormos in the latitude of Sifit. (Lykopolis) on the Red Sea.
From these two last-named seaports, which were much frequented,
especially in the month of September, goods were conveyed by the
great caravan--route to Koptos on the Nile [ near the modern I_ (eneh),
and were then transferred to boats which carried them down the
Nile to Alexandria, where they were shipped for their ultimate
destination. After the Arabs had conquered Egypt, they must have
been desirous of connecting the Lower Egyptian part of the Nile
as directly as possible with the Red Sea. rAmr ibn el-'Asi (p. 101 ]
accordingly restored the ancient canal (of which the Khalig at Cairo
is said to bc a portion), and used it for the transport of grain from
Fostiit (p. 9.41) to Kolzum LSnez), whence it was exported by the
lied Sea to Arabia. The bed 01' the ancient canal is said to have
been pointed out to'Amr by a Uopt, to whom a remission of the
poll-tux was granted as a reward. The canal is said to have been
filled up by the morbidly suspicious Khalif Al-.\Iansl'1r ibn Mo-
hammed (754-775), in order to cut off the supplies of the army of
