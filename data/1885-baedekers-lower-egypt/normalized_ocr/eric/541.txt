the oasis of Firan (p. 495), the "'31 di Mokatteh (p. 493) with its in-
scriptions, and the mines of "'adi Maghara (p. 491), all of which are
points of much interest.

Camels are always to be had at Tfir. but as good saddles are rare,
the travellers dragoman should take an ample supply of rugs from
Cairo; moreover it is not so easy to make a satisfactory hargain at Tur
as at Cairo, Ult) ll" l. ] Shekh lDIenuen (see aboie) will render every as-
sistance in his power. If the party is numerous. 01 if the t1aveller wishes
to provide against the possibility of delay, camels should he sent 011 from
Suez to'I_'1'1r, a journey of three days for unladen animals, the cost of
which is not very great.

To the above directions may, lastly, he added a few hints for which
we are indebted to a traveller who is well acquainted with the Arabic
language, and is accustomed to associate with the Beduins :---- Take
the railway from Cairo to Suez. Dispense with tents and beds; but
take at least a couple of warm rugs to fold over the saddle, and to
he used at night. A hammock will also he found very serviceable, and
the camp may he pitched where the trees are large enough to give it
support. Before leaving Cairo the traveller should lay in a stock of
preserved meats and wine, and buy a lamp and a few cooking utensils.
Pack these in palm-leaf baskets. which are well adapted for the camels.
If necessary the stock of provisions may be reinforced at Tur by fresh
bread, a few fowls, lobsters, and fish, and some date paste. -\t Suez
procure introductions to the monks of the Greek convent at l.'ur and
to Shekh Hennen. Proceed from Suez to Tor hy hoat or by steamer
(during the quarantine peiiod). Sleep at Tur in l_le11neus house or in
the Greek convent. Hire a Camel through llennen with a Beduiu atten «
dant on foot. Start very early and traverse the desert to \Vddi cs-
Sléh (see p. 517). reaching the Sinai Monastery next evening. Thence
travel slowly to VVfidi Ba'ha'. Lastly. return to Suez hy forced marches,
taking about two days and a night. The whole journey may thus be
accomplished in eight days, without reckoning the stay at the monastery,
and perhaps at Firfui; and as a sheltered resting-place may always he
found among the mountains, the protection of a tent will never be missed,
excepting perhaps on the last day of the expedition.

Drsraxees AND DISPOSITION or Tom. There are of course several
laud-routes to the Monastery of Sinai, hut we need only describe the
most interesting of them, and those which are generally taken by tra-
vellers. As a standard of distance we adopt the time usually occupied
hy the camels in performing thejouruey. Their average rate oftravelling
is almut 21/2) 1. per hour.

found impossible to induce the beatmen on the Nile, or the iChildren
of the Desert", to start early in the morning, as they invariably seem to
think that a late hour in the afternoon is the most suitahle time, so that.
a very short distance only is performed on the first day. 50 on the
tour to Sinai the party seldom gets farther than'.\in hlfisa (see below)
on the first. day, but on the second and following days more satisfactory
progress is made. Patience is therefore indispensable at starting. The
journey is usually made without any prolonged halt, e\cept at the mines
of \V1d1 Maghara in the \Vadi llIokatteh, in which we spend 3-4 hrs.,
riding at a slower pace, at the Jehel Serbal if it is to he ascended, for
one day, and at Sal-hut cl- Khadem, for 1/2- -1 day. Mount Sinai, heing the
great object of the journey, requires a stay of 2-3 days.
