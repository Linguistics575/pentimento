522 Route 10. sanm'rr uL-KIIRDEM. From Sinai l

fine old seyfil trees. Near the head of the valley are several'Nawdmis'
(stone huts; see p. 501 ], Sinaitic inscriptions, and large fragments
of a rude granite wall. rl'he latter is said to have been erected by the
Tawfira Beduins, in order to arrest the progress of troops sent by
Mohammed rAli to punish them for pillaging a caravan; but it ap-
pears to be of earlier date. It extends along both slopes of the val-
ley, but there is a wide opening where the route passes through it.

On the right opens the Wc'zdi r'lIeaaklt-m', and on the left, lower
dOnn, the Wridi Tayyibeh, at the base of the lofty Dabbds'lldlc.
In 21/4 hrs. more the Wfidi Rarak reaches the dez' Sik, which
after 3/4 hr. turns sharply to the left, leading to the Widi Sidr,
while the Wadi el-Mcmyz'h on the right leads to the Debbet er-
Rumtch. Our route runs to the N.W., gradually ascending, and
and in 1/2 hr. reaches a narrow sandy plain called the DebEbct Sh√©'lch
Ahmed, from the tomb of a Beduin chief of that name to the right
of the path. "'0 then descend into the Wr'uli Ii'humileh, in which
we again ascend to ('2, hrs.) the Rds deik (2475 ft.) 0n the left
is the picturesque Jebel Ghm-abi, a curiously eroded mass of sand-
stone, With several Sinaitio inscriptions. An extensive View is
obtained over the'l'ih hills and the plain of Ramleh.

We descend from the pass by a steep zigzag path into the Wtidi
Sflurilc, in which after 11/2 hr. we reach the mouth of the small
lVddi Memttameh, situated at the foot of the hills called Sarbnt
el-Khadem.

On the neighbouring hill, 690 ft. in height, are situated a
number of interesting monuments, dating from the period of the
Pharaohs, and re-discovered by Niebuhr in'176'2. The ascent from
the wan Merattameh, which is somewhat fatiguing, and requires
a steady head, occupies fully an hour. On the level plateau
on the top are numerous monuments with hieroglyphic inscrip-
tions. There are traces of an old enclosing wall, 57 yds. long, and
23 yds. broad, surrounded by sixteen ancient J'Igyptian upright
monuments 0. Similar stones bearing inscriptions are lying on
the ground, and there are the ruins of a small temple. The sanc-
tuary and a pronaos of this edifice were hewn in the rocks in the
reign of Amenemha IlI. (19th l) yn.), and furnished with hand-
somely painted inscriptions (which, however, are nearly obliterated),
and niches for images. In the reign of'l'hothmes lll. (13th Dyn.)
the temple was extended towards the W. by the erection of a pylon
and anterior court, and several rooms on the W. side were after-
wards added by other kings. The dimensions of the Whole building
are comparatively small. As in the Wfidi Magh'ara (p. 491), the
goddess [ [ athor, and particularly the llathor of Mafkat (p. 49?),
was principally worshipped here. rl'he inscriptions indicate that
this spot, instead of being a burial-place with its tombstones, as
one would at first have supposed, was a religious ediilce with a
number of chambers for various purposes.
