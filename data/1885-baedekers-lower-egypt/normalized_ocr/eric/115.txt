589-5611. Uahbr√©. (Gr. Apries or Uaphris; the Hophrah of the
Bible), observing that the Babylonians were encroach-
ing on Palestine, fitted out an army and fleet, cap-
tured Sidon, defeated the Cyprians and the Tyrians in a
naval battle, and marched to the relief ofledekiah, King of
Judah, who was besieged in Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.
That city having been again besieged by Nehuchadnezzar
and captured, Uaphris accorded an asylum to its exiled
inhabitants. lie afterwards sustained a defeat from Bat-
tns 11., King of Crrene, in consequence. of whirh his army
rebelled against him. Aulzmes,'who had been dispatched by
him to treat with the insurgents, was then proclaimed king,
and he himself was dethroned.

Aahmes II. (Gr. Anmsis; p. 386) succeeded in securing
his supremacy by alliances with (lyrene, with the tyrant
Polycrates of Samos, and with the Greeks. He assigned land
to foreign colonists, granting them religious toleration, and
diverted the stream of commerce from the semi-thnician
cities of the Delta ('l'anis, Mendcs, and llnbastisl towards
the Greek city ofNaucratis (see p 907 ]. During his reign the
country enjoyed peace and prosperity, but the balance of
power among the great nations of that era underwent a con-
siderable change. Cyrus had meanwhile founded the vast Per-
sian empire, and consolidated it lry means of the conquest of
the Babylonian and Lydian kingdoms. His son Cumbysesnext
marched against Egypt, the only great power which still
rivalled Persia. llaving advanced to l'elnsinm with a large
army, he there defeated Psammetikh 111., son of Aurasis.
who was now dead (p. 371 ], captured Memphis, and
took the king prisoner. 1'sammetikh was afterwards executed
for attempting to organise an insurrection to shake off the
foreign yoke.

Cambyses (Pew. Kumbuziya 11., Egypt. Kembui; pp. 374,
386, 446) at first behaved with great moderation. Ile
tolerated the Egyptian religion, and to his own name he
added the Egyptian agnomen of Ramesut, or'child of the
I sun'. After, however, he had failed in several rash enter-
prises, such as his campaigns against the inhabitants of the
oasis of Ammou and against the Ethiopians, his temper
became soured, and his conduct violent and cruel. He died
at Acbatana in Syria, while marching to Persia against
Gaunmtu, ansurper who personated Rurdiyn LGr. Smenlis ],
