X. W. angle, now closed, has an architrave of alabaster; the threshold
is of granite, and the ceiling consists of a dome with pendentives.

The Yestibule (Pl. 2) of the b'. facade, through which we reach
the interior, has a tine star-shaped dome. We pass thence into the
Hésh, 0r Satin el-Gamir LP ]. a, b, c, d), the large Quadrangle, in
the centre of which is the Iiariefiyeh (Pl. 4), or fountain for aqu-
tion. Beneath the larger [ N.E.) dome is the Tomb ofSultanltarkfil;

801 Leonip. p. 279). Adjoining the tomb is a column, said to
represent the height of the deceased, and inscribed with several
biographical data. A black stone here (ironstone), when rubbed
on granite under water, is believed by the Muslims to communicate
sanatory properties to the discolourcd water.

The adjacent tomb is that of Sultdn Put- (lg, son of liarlgulg.

Fm'ag (1399-1-112) 11ad scarcely ascended the throne [ 20th June, 1399),
as a boy of thirteen years of age' before the Usmans began to threaten the
Syrian duminions oi' the Egyptian empire; and Timur (Tamerlane), in his
war against the Osmans, shortly afterwards defeated the Syrian emirs, who
had opposed him, near Aleppo. Farag himself thereupon headed a cam-
paign against Timur, and proceeded Victoriously as far as Damascus; but
owing to dissensions among his emirs he was obliged to return to Cairo
and leave Hyria to its fate. After the defeat of the Turks under Bajesid
by the Mongols under Timur at the battle of Angora, Farag was com-
pelled to enter into negociaticns with Timur, and he is even said to
have sent him Egyptian coins hearing the Mongolian conqueror's name
in token of his subjection. The death of Timur, however (18th Dec.
1103), saved Egypt from the risk of being conquered by the Mongols.
The latter years of Farag's reign were constantly disturbed by the re-
bellions of his emirs, particularly Shékh el-Mahmddi Muaiyad (see p. 273).
He was at length compelled by the insurgents to capitnlate at Damascus,
whither he had proceeded with his army, and was executed (May, 1412).

The third tomb contains the remains of a brother ot'lr'arag, who
reigned seventy days only. The S. Mausoleum LP ]. 13) contains
the tombs of the female members of the family. The *Mambar
(1'1. 6), in hard limestone, one of the most beautiful existing
specimens of Arabian sculpture, was presented by l_\'ait llcy

balconies below them ], are borne by pendent roruices.

The symmetrical plan of the edifice, its massive masonry, and
the symmetrical disposition of the rows of pilasters with domes,
constitute this mosun one of the most perfect examples ofArabian
architecture ill existence; and, notwithstanding its ruinous con-
dition, it still presents a most imposing appearance.

To the W. [ right ] of this tomb-mosque is the Tomb of Sultdn
Suté'mrin, containing interesting sculpture in the dome and in-
scriptions in fayence, now partly destroyed. To the E. of this
tomb (and to the S. ot'liarhfih's mosque ] is another handsome dome-
covercd tomb, the founder of which is unknown; and there are other
interesting dome-structures of various forms, carefully executed,
but of uncertain origin. Adjoining the mausoleum of Suléiuan is
the tomb of the Sulfa Bcnfit [ seven maidens). The dome, with its
