Meanwhile I_Insén had conquered [ { ijaz and Yemen, and added them to
the Egyptian dominions, on which occasion El-Ghnri caused the whole
of the S. side of the Haram at Mecca to be rebuilt (in 906 of the Hegira ],
as recorded there by an inscription under the B31) Ibrahim; but these
districts soon threw off his yoke and placed themselves under the snzcrainty

sultan himself died. On 21th Aug. 1516, while fighting against the army
of the Osman sultan Selim I. in the plain of Dahik (to the N. of Aleppo),
he is said to have fallen down in a fit of apoplexy, and to have been

Starting from the Ezbekiyeh and ascending the Muski as far as
the El--Ghfiriyeh street, on the right (p. 254,), and the Bazaar of
the Coppersmiths [ en-Nahhasin; Pl. 0, 2; p. 256), 011 the left,
we follow the latter, passing the entrance to the Khan el-Khalili
011 the right (p. 255), and after a few hundred paces observe 011
the left three mosques, adjoining each other, with staring red and
white striped facades (p. 180). The first of these is the---

Muristan Kalafm (P1. 73), once a vast hospital ('mfiristan',
from the Persian word himaristan), the greater part of which is
110w in a ruinous condition, and used as a workshop by copper-
smiths and tinkers. The tomb of the founder, however, which
