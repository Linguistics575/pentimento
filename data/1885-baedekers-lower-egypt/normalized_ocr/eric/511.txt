bank is Simlydu, with ahandsome minaret. Oppositeto itis DÃ©rdt.
The angular pieces of wood at the top of the minarets are used for
hearing lamps onfestive occasions. Numerous pumps are observed
011 the banks. The next places on the left are Minyct-cs--Sa'id and
mm, and on the right Shemshir; then, on the left Ari/" meh, with
a palace erected by Sa'id Pasha, and on the right JIelfibis. Farther
towards the N., Dtbch lies a little to the left, and on the right are
K'uni, Ming/ct el--Mnrshid, and the important-looking little town of
Berimbz'il. On the same bank are chgt'irin and the village of
(Cos/Lu, and opposite, to the left, is the town of Maltallet cal-Emir,
crowned with two minarets. On the right we next observe Fords,
and on the left Shenu'ismeh and El--Khimmdd; then, on the right,
El--Busrch, and on the left Et-chiyeh. The citadel of Rosetta
(, Reshid), usually known as the Kal'a ("castlej next comes in sight.
Near it, also on the left, we observe a fine grove of palm-trees
rising close to the town, and the hill of Abu Mandfir [ see below).

Rosetta, Arabic Resizid La Coptic name, Ti Rushit signify-
ing'city of joy'i), the ancient Bolbitine, with 19,392 iuhab.,
almost exclusively natives, lies at the month of the Bolbitinic arm
of the Nile, which was also called the Taly (T0110). As the Rosetta
Stone [ see below) was found near Fort St. Julien, 4 M. to the N.,
it is supposed that the ancient town lay in that neighbourhood.
--There is no inn at Rosetta, but, if necessary, the traveller may
apply for accommodation to the hospitable Franciscan monks.

HISTORY. Little is known regarding the early history of the town.
It was founded on the site of the ancient Bolbitine, and early in the
middle ages attained considerable mercantile importance. It continued
to flourish down to the beginning of the present century. but. ils prosperity
declined rapidly in consequence of the construction of the Mahmfidiyeh
Canal and the improvement 01' the harbour of Alexandria. The rice
trade of Rosetta is of considerable importance, and shipbuilding is car-
ried on with some success.

The town possesses numerous gardens, which yield excellent
fruit. The hill of AMI. Mundr'zr, to the S. of the town, which com-
mands a line view, is supposed by some topographers to have been
the site of the ancient Bolbitine. The interesting streets contain
many small, but substantial houses in a peculiar, half-EurOpeau
style, with projecting stories and Windows towards the outside.
Numerous columns from edifices of the heathen and Christian
periods, many of them of granite and some of marble, are seen
lying in various open spaces, particularly one of considerable size
near the river, and a number of others are built into the houses.
The very spacious Mosque of Sakhli'm is embellished with many
ancient columns, but is otherwise uninteresting. The fortifications
to the N. of the town are not shown except by permission the
commandant. In 1799 M. Bouchard, a French captain of engineers,
discovered in Fort St. Julian the celebrated Rosetta Stone, which
afforded European scholars a key to the language and writing of the
ancient Egyptians, which had been lost for nearly 14 centuries.
