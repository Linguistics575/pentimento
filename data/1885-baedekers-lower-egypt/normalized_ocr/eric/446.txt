of geese (see below); and to the right
of the entrance (Pl. 0 ], the catching of
fish in traps. These three scenes
are small and damaged by expos-

Great Court (Pl. 0), an extensive
quadrangle, which was once covered

pillars. The roof has disappeared, but
some of the pillars are still standing.
This hall is said to have been the
scene of the rites performed in honour
of the deceased and the sacrifice of

was sunk the mummy shaft (Pl. dl,
not perpendicularly, as usual, but in
an oblique direction, communicating

a sarcophagus without inscription was
