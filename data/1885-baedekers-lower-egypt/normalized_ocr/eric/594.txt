rocks in many different directions, and excavated them in the form of
lnlnyrinths, whilst (as in the "'idi) Iaghara) they left pillars here and
[ here to prevent the roof from falling in. To judge from the extent of the
mines the quantity of ore obtained must have been very considerable.
To this day one of the mines contains a considerable quantity of copper
ore, while another, Where chambers 80 ft. in length have been excavated,
seems to have been given up as exhausted'. (Rifppell)

On the hill above the mines stands an ancient Egyptian obelisk
with half-obliterated hieroglyphics.

Descending the Wédi Nasb towards the N. we reach the month
of the Wadi Hobfiz (see below), where the caravan Should be
ordered to await our arrival. K

Beyond the \V'adi Merattameh the Suez route continues to follow
the Widi Sfiwik, to the N. W., passing a number of fine seyal trees
of great ago. After 1 hr. the valley takes the name of dei Hobos,
and in less than 1 hr. more it unites with the Writli Nusb, which
almost immediately joins the Wfidi Ba'ba', a valley leading to the
S.E. to the Hanalc el-Lalcam (p. 490). At the junction of the
l_lobfiz and Nash valleys our route turns to the right, and leads
across the sandy table--land of Debbet el-Kemi in 3 hrs. to the
beginning of the wan el--Ilioxnr. Ascending a little towards the
middle of the lofty plain, we enjoy a fine view of the Sarbfit el-
Jemel (9175 ft), rising to the lV. opposite to us, beyond the \Vadi
llomr. To the left, in the distance, are picturesquely shaped
mountains with flat summits; to the right is the Tih range; and
behind us are the hills of Sarbdt el--Khadem, the Jebel Ghfirabi,
and the distant Mt. Serbz'tl.

We now descend to the broad route leading to Nakhlch (p. 5'20).
011 the right rises the long Jebel Bédrz'. On the ground here we
observe a number of curious geological formations, consisting of
slabs and fragments of sandstone encrusted with nodules of iron
ore, with a large admixture of silica, grouped like bunches of
grapes. Some of these are perfectly spherical.

The Wédi el-Homr is a broad valley flanked by low limestone
hills. It is commanded on the N. side by the Sarbfit el--Jemel [ see
above). From this valley a path, practicable for camels, traverses
the Wr'tdi Mesa/ricer and several other valleys, and leads direct
to the Wfidi eth--Tlnil (p. 489). The regular route follows the Widi
cl-l_lomr to its union with the Wfidi Shebfikeh (see p. 489). Thence
to Suez, see pp. 459--485.
