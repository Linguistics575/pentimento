cannot help feeling that the style fails to give entire aesthetic
satisfaction. \l'ant of symmetry in plan, poverty of articulation,
insufficiency ot'plastic. decoration. and an incongruous mingling of
stone and wood, are the imperfections which strike most northern
critics. The architects, in fact, bestowed the whole of their attention
on the decoration of surfaces; and down to the present day the
Arabian artists have always displayed far greater ability in tracing? r
elegant outlines, and designing the. most complicated ornaments
and geometrical figures on plane surfaces, than in the treatment
and proportioniug of masses. Although we occasionally see dit'tl-
culties of construction well overcome, as in the case of the interior
of the Bab en--Nasr, these instances seem rather to be successful
experiments than the result of scientific workmanship. The real
excellence of the Arabian architects lay in their skill in masking
abrupt angles by the use of'stalactites' or brackets.

If we enquire into the causes of these defects in the develop-
ment of art we shall find that the climate is one of the principal.
Its remarkable mildness and the rareness of rain have, enabled ar-
chitects to dispense nith much that appears essential to the inhab-
itant of more. northern latitudes; and hence the imperfect de-
velopment and frequent absence of cornices. The extraordinary
durability of wood in Ewypt, again, has led to its being used in
the constructiOu of walls, and in connection with stone, in a uran-
ner which would never occur to northern architects. Another
circumstance unfavourable to the development of native art has
doubtless been the ease with which the architects obtained abun-
dance of pillars and capitals in ancient buildings ready to their
hand. There were also political obstacles to the progress of art,
such as frequent intestine struggles and disscnsions, and the
sway of despotic rulers and their servile officers; and, lastly, the
characteristic Egyptian tenacity and veneration for tradition and
religious precept have not been without their influence. The ori-
L'inal design ofthe mosque, for example, was borrowed from Mecca.
and no deviation could be made from its plan; and this accounts
for the invariable recurrence of the same forms in the mosques of
l-Igypt. in a few instances architects ventured to introduce in-
novations, but they never failed to revert sooner or later to the
established style. The external architecture of private houses,
however, being unfettered by religious considerations, might have
progressed more favourably but for the powerful influence of super-
stition and fear. An external display of wealth, according to the
pepular notion, drew upon its possessor the'evil eye' of the 00ve-
IONS. the consequence of which was misfortune or death, while, on
the other hand, it afforded the government a pretext for extorting
heavy tm-s from the occupant. It therefore became customary
with the Egyptians to restrict any appearance of luxury to the
interior of their harems. where it is exhibited in the sumptuous
