The university is attended by about 7700 students in all, who are
taught by 231 shékhs or professors.

The diflerent sects are distributed as follows:

Shdfe'ites... 3723, with 106 shékhs.
Malekites... 2855, with 75 shekbs.
Hanefltes... 1090, with 49 shOkhs.
Harnhalites... 23, with 1 shakh.

The students (Jlugtiwz'l'in) usually remain three, and sometimes
from four to six years in the mosque. They pay no fees, but each riwah
is supported by an annual subsidy from the endowments of the mosque,
although these were much diminished by Mohammad'Ali, who ap-
propriated the revenues of most of the religious foundations in Egypt to
government purposes. The shékhs, or professors, receive no salary, either
from the mosque or from government, but support themselves-by teaching
in private houses, by copying books, or by filling some religions office
to which a salary is attached, and they occasionally receive donations
from the wealthier students. \Vhen teaching, the shékh sits cross-legged
on a straw-mat and reads from a book placed on a desk (rattle/z) before
him, explaining each sentence as he proceeds; or he directs one of the
more advanced students to read aloud, adding his own explanations from
time to time. The students sit in a circle around the teacher, listening,
or attentively taking notes. As soon as a student knows by heart the
whole of the book which is being studied by the class, the shekh inahes
an entry in his copy of the work, called the Igdzch, wherehy authority
to lecture nn the book is conferred ml the student himself. The president
of the university, who is usually the most. distinguished of the siteldis,
is called Shr'kh et-Azlmr, and receives a salary of about 20 purses, 1. e.
10,000 pinstres.'
