spection of the great necropolis. Those who are not fatigued may
now walk towards the Citadel (p. 262). examining the different
héshes, domes, and smaller monuments on the right and left, and
may then visit the Tombs of the Mamelnkes (p. 327) beyond the
Citadel. The embankment of the new railway which runs between
the Tombs of the Khalifs and the quarries of the) lolrattam, affords
a good survey of the scene. The traveller who quits the Tombs
about sunset should not omit to ascend the Windmill Hill from the
side next the town (comp. Plan, p. 282), for the sake of the view.
A fine efiect, especially by evening light, is produced by the domes
and the peculiar colouring of the valley and the opposite heights
of the Mohattam. This mound of rubbish should indeed be fre-
quently visited (comp. p. 282). To the W. are the city, the plain
of the Nile, and the Pyramids. The red building to the RE. is the
'Abbfisiyeh (p. 332), to the left of which is a mosque (Gimi' el-
'Adill. In front of the latter is the N.E. group of the Tombs of the
Khalifs (p. (289,), a little to the right of which are the two minarets
of Sultan Barlsfih (p. 2851). Beyond these rises the Gebel el-Ahmar
(p. 337:). adjoining which are the hlolgattam hills, with the other
Tombs of the Khalifs at their base.

Mosques of El-Azhar and Uasanén.

The Gami' el-Azhar (Pl. 38; C,'2.) presents few features of ar-
chiteotural interest, and is so shut in by houses that very little of
the exterior is Visible. The plan of the principal part was originally
the same as that of the'Amr Mosque (p. 324), but the numerous
additions made at various periods have somewhat modified its form,
and since the conversion of the mosque into a university the aisles
have been separated from the court by walls and railings. The first
great alterations took place in the year lUO-l of the Hegira, in the
reign of Mohammed ibn Murad, the next were made by Shékh ls-
ma'il Bey in 113l of the Hegira, and the last by Sa'id Pasha about
1848, all exhibiting the decline of Arabian architecture.

The Minarets (Pl. 1'2), some of which are brightly painted,
were erected at different periods, one of them having been built
by rAhder Rahman Kikliya (p. 279 ].

The mosque has six gates: the Bell) el-Jluzeyinin (Pl. a), or
Gate of the Barbers (see below ], on the \Y. side, forming the prin-
cipal entrance, and possessing an interesting portal; the Ba'b Go-
hariyeh (P1. b ], on the N. side; the B111; csh-Shurba (Pl. c), or Soup
Gate, on the 19.; the B121: e_s-Sa'2d2yeh, or Gate of the Upper Egyp-
tians; the Bab esh-Shawwfim (Pl. e), or Syrian Gate; and the Bdb
el-Maghfirbch'fl'l. f), or Gate of the W. Africans, the three last
being on the S. side.

The mosque was converted into a University (new the most
important in Mohammedan territory) by Khalif'Aziz Billzlh (All.
975-96), at the suggestion of his vizier Abu'l Farag Ya'lifib, in
