which are dry at low tide, lie on the FL, and others on the W. side

of the ship's course. We pass a handsome pier on the left, from

the S. side of which the navigable channel to Suez, bordered by
shallows, branches ott to the N.W., and then, nearly in the lati-
tude of Suez, we enter the mouth of the canal. On that part of I
the W. bank of which the Canal has made an island by separating
it from the mainland, rise the workshops and coal magazines of the
company and the quarantine establishment. At low tide the shal-
lows in the N. part of the gulf are visible, and a series of islands
is always to be seen at the extremity of the gulf, which, but for the
Canal, might be crossed on foot at low tide. On the westernmost
island, situated opposite the railway station and the hotel, is an
old burial-ground, and on a larger island farther to the E. are the
company's furnaces and workshops.

At the 150th kilometre (the 83rd on the fresh-water canal) the
desert rises in a slight eminence, on which lie a number of huge
granite blocks, the remains of two monuments erected here by Da-
rius, during the Persian period, and. still bearing traces of hiero-
glyphics and of the Persian cuneiform characters.

"They were doubtless intended to arrest the eye of the passenger tra-
velling through the canal, and were therefore of imposing dimensions,
and placed on a massive pedestal. The bed of the ancient canal is, more-
over, traceable in the neighbourhood. It does nut seem to me probable
that Darius should have limited himselt'to the three monuments of which
there are still remains, particularly as the distance between the second
and third (at Shalr'if and Scrapeum respectively) is much greater than
that between the first and second. One other monument at least may there-
fore be supposed to have stood between the second and third.... These
three monuments have been destroyed by violence, perhaps during the
successful rising of the Egyptians in the reign of Artaxerxes, or after
they had finally shaken oil" the Persian yoke. Fire, which is very in-
jurious to granite, seems to have been used in destroying them'. _.

Near Slialz'tfet--Tcrn'rbch (a station on the left, near the 139th ki-
lometre, with a village in the midst of vegetation, founded by the
company), no less than 40,000 cubic yds. of limestone, coloured
red and brown with iron, had to be removed in the course of the
excavation of the Canal, and interesting geological formations have
been brought to light (comp. p. 00).

The lower stratum of the bank contains a layer of sharks" teeth
(Cm-c/ (m-odon meyalodon Ag.)... The limestone rock of which the bank
consists, and which is rapidly decomposed by exposure to the air. is
mingled with salt and gypsum, and betrays its pure oceanic origin; for
not only does its lowest stratum contain numerous teeth and vertebra of
the Car-nharodon, but the rock itself contains bivalvc shells and remains of

tryozoa. which fall out as the rock disintegrates. Ahove the limestone
lies a layer of loose sand. A thin stratum ot' the rock, which is full of
remains of boring conchylia and crocodiles" teeth, also contains bones and
teeth of large quadrupcds, Cetacca, and shurks' .---- (0. Frans.)

Near Shaluf is the second of the monuments erected by Darius
(see above), which was discovered by MM. ltozii-re and Devilliers,
two of the savants attached to the French expedition, and was ex-
cavated by M. de Lesscps in 1866. The red blocks, which belong
