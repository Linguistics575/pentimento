which consists of three sheltered basins in which vessels discharge
and load. The first of these, beginning 011 theN. side, is the basin
of the commercial harbour, the second is that of the quays, and the
third the'Bassin ('he'rif'. The last is flanked with handsome build-
ings, which were erected by Prince Ilenry of the Netherlands as a
depot for facilitating the Dutch goods and passenger traffic between
Europe and the colonies of Holland; on his death, however, which
happened in 188'), they were purchased by the English government,
and they are now used a military depdt and barracks.

8. Towns of the Central and Northern Delta.

A tour in the inland and rorthern districts of the Delta, including a,
visit to the towns of Mansfira. Damietta, and Rosetta, and the exploration
of some of the ruins of towns near the embouchures of the Nile, is at-
tended with considerable difficulty and discomfort, with which the at-
tractions are 11y no means commensurate. A week at least is required
for the excursion. unless the traveller confine himself to places lying
close to the railway.

Those who are unaequcintcd with the language, and propose to penc-
trate into the interior of the country, should he provided with a dragomun
or a servant (p. 13), a. tent, and a cock, as there are no tolerable hotels
evcept at Tania, Damietta, and Rosetta. Introductions should be oh-
tuined through the consulate at Cairo to the consular agents at Mansura,
Rosetta, and: Damietta, and to the shokh of the fisheries at Tanis.

As wet weather and cold nights are not uncommon in the Delta in
winter, the traveller should be well provided with warm clothing and
rugs. A moderate supply of provisions and wine will also be found useful.

DisrosrTioN or TIME. The railway traffic in the Delta has much in-
creased of late, so that the following tours can now be accomplished
with much less loss of time than formerly. The hours of starting and
the fares are so often changed, that it is useless to give them here,

lst Day: From ('airo to'llansur'i .---- 2nd D11y: At lllansura- excursion
to liol1b1tel-llager; and start from Talkha, opposite Mansura, for Do-

mietla .--3rd Day: Forcnoon at D11i11i1\t, ta: in the afternoon lly train
(14.) p.111.) to T11n_t11.--4th Day: From Tonto to lmsetta .---- 5111 Day: F1on1
losctta to Alexandria .--A visit to Tunis takes two days more, and to

Sal's also two days.
The tour may also be made in the reverse direction, and some trav-
ellers will find it convenient to proceed from Tanis direct to Port Sa'id.
The journey itself presents little attraction. The chief characteristics
of the monotonous scenery are extensive and often remarkably fertile
fields, canals, and dirty villages surrounded by palm-trees.
