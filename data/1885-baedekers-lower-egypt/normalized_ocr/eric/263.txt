proper fare. On Sundays and holidays the fares rise considerably, and
it is then often difficult to get a good vehicle. The salts, or boy who runs
before the carriage to clear the way in the crowded streets, is a very
useful attendant (p. 247v). His services are included in the carriage-fare,
but. he expects a small additional fee (2 piastres).

Donkeys (comp. p. 11) afl'ord the best and most rapid mode of loco-
motion in the narrow and crowded streets of Cairo, and they are to be
met with, day and night, in every part of the town. The attendants often
thrust them unceremoniously on the traveller's notice by placing them
directly in his path. These animals are to he found in great numbers at
all the most frequented points, and if one is wanted in the middle of the
night the word'hammér' (p. 11) shouted out immediately attracts a large
assortment of them. The donkey--boys of Cairo have all the manic vim-e
of denizens of a large city, and they often possess a considerable fund of
humour. which they show most readily when well paid. They delight
in excursions into the Country (to Sakkfira, for instance), which afi'ord
them a'fantasi'ya', or special treat; and the European will he astonished
at the smallness of their requirements and those of their beasts. The
donkeys are particularly serviceable in the narrow streets of the Arabian
quarter, which afiord shade and coolness, but are not accessible to car-
riages. For a short ride in the town the usual charge is 1--2 piastres
tariff (25-50 c.) -, for 1 hr., 1 fr.:, for a forenoon in the town, 21/2 fr.-, for
excursions 4-6 t'r. per day (ladies' saddle 1 fr. extra). and a hakshish of
V's-3A fr. to the boy, unless he has been uncivil. When a donkey is hir-
ed to carry baggage, its attendant should be required to follow the same
route as the travellers themselves, and always to remain in sight. Per <
sons making a prolonged stay, as soon as they have found a good don-
key with proper gear and a satisfactory attendant, had better secure its
future services by the payment of an extra halgshish. Care should be
taken to choose a donkey with sound fore-legs.

Commissionnaires (comp. p. 13). The traveller who is pressed for
time, and wishes to see as much as possible, cannot well dispense
with a cicerone. The best guides (5--8 fr. per day) are to be had at the
hotels. They often try to induce their employers to engage them for
distant tours, such as that to llt. Sinai, or the voyage up the Nile, but
for such expeditions they are totally unfitted. As a rule, purchases should
never be made in their presence. If, however, the traveller knows a few
words of Arabic, and is not in a hurry, he will soon find his way through
every part of the city and the environs with the aid of his donkey-boy alone.

gomans may be obtained at the traveller's consulate, at the hotels. at
