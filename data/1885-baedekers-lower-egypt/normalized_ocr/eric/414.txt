in the rock---- temple adjoining the Sphinx (p. 365 ]. The monument
has even been supposed to be entitled to claim still highex
antiquity; for \1. \lariette7 nhile examining a ruined building
at the foot of the southernmost of the three pyramids which
rise to the 11. of the Great Pyramid, found a stone built into
a wall, bearing an inscription which seemed to imply that the
Sphinx already existed in the time of Khufn, the builder of the
first pyramid. The inscription on the right side of the stone runs
literally thus :--"the living Horus, the King of l'pper and Lower
Egypt. Khufn, the life--dispensing, found [ in making excavations)
the Temple of 1sis. the patroness (hant) of the Pyramid in the
place (Le. in the immediate vicinity) of the Temple of the Sphinx'.

The Sphinx is written 2%% hu, which signifies'to

guard" or'watch', or'the watchman', an expression precisely equi-
valent t0 the'bel--hit' (p. 369,) of a later period. The above i11-
scription, however, is of later date than the time of Cheops. The
large tablet of Thothmes 111., found between the paws of the
Guardian of the Neeropolis, has been already mentioned. This
celebrated Pharaoh (p. 89 ] restored the Sphinx, and seems specially
to have revered it7 as is indicated by numerous small monuments
which bear the figure of the Sphinx coupled with his name or his
portrait. 1n the inscription already referred to, the Sphinx is said
to speak to Thothmes'as a father to his son', and to address him in
the words--'1 am thy father 11arn1achis'. Though more or less
buried in sand at various periods= the Sphinx was highly admired
and revered down to so late a period as that of the Roman emperors,
as numerous inscriptions upon it7 now concealed by the sand,
testify. Curiously enough, the Sphinx is mentioned neither by
Herodotus nor any later Greek traveller.
