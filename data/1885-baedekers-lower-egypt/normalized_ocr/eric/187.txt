capitals, somewhat simple in form, and tapering upwards, are
sometimes decorated on the lower part with a wreath of upright
reed leaves7 and sometimes, like the shafts, are treated as surfaces
for painting, in which case their origin in the vegetable kingdom
is indicated by a few painted buds only (Fig. V. u, b ].

While the columns hitherto described performed the structural
