Railway stations (comp. p. 11). The station for Alexandria (R. 2),
Zahazilg, lsma'iliya. and Suez (R. 5), and for the whole of the Delta,

the line to Turn and llelwftn (p.403) is in the Place) Iéhémet--Ali, below
the Citadel (Pl. F, G, 2).

The hotel commissionnaires with their omnibuses or carriages await
the arrival of each train and take charge of luggage. As it not unfre-
quently happens that all the hotels are full. it is a wise precaution to
telegraph for rooms from Alexandria. Carriage with two horses from the
station to one of the hotels 2'/2-3 fr., donkey 1/2 fr., luggage-donkey 1/2 fr.
(but an attempt to extort more is always made; comp. p. 12).

kiyeh, a large building with handsome rooms (landlord, Sign. Pantellini);

Pensions. At the following houses board and lodging may be ob-

rooms, Wine included: Madame Fink 1P1. g; D, 5). in a healthy situation
in the Quartier Isma'iliya (good table); Hotel Cauteret, opposite Shep-
heard's Hotel; Edie! d'Angleteri'e (see above), Hotel de Byzmbzc [ rooms
only). in the Ezkehiyeh.

Private Apartments for the winter may also now be procured without
much difficulty. A slight knowledge of the language, however, is indis-
pensable, as the servants seldom speak foreign languages. The cost of
living in this way is lower than at a hotel. but it is seldom possible to
secure private lodgings for a shorter period than six months. A sunny
aspect should be chosen, and a detailed written contract drawn up. A
bargain as to food may be made with some neighbouring restaurant.
Wine, see p. 235. Information as to rooms may he obtained at the cigar-
shop of Liuadas in the Ezhekiych; but it is advisable to submit the con-
traet before signing to an impartial resident.
