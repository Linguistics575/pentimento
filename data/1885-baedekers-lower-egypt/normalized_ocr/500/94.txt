Fayhm a peculiar kind of water-wheel is in use, so contrived as to
be turned by the weight of the water.) According to Figari-lley,
the number of std.ciyehs used in Central and Lower Egypt in 1864
was about 50,000, which were turned and superintended by 200,000
oxen and 100,000 persons, and which irrigated 1500,000 acres of
land. (2) The'Shthlii/", an apparatus resembling that of an ordinary
well, set in motion by one person only, and drawing the water in
hnekets resembling baskets in appearance; as a substitute for the
s√©hiyeh several shiultif's, are sometimes arranged one above the other.
(j1) When it is possible to store the water in reservoirs above the
level of the land to be watered, it is allowed to overflow the iichls
whenever required. This is the Only method available in the oases,
where fortunately the water rises from the springs with such force
as to admit of its being easily dammed up at a tsufficiently high
level. bi) Pumps driven by steam are also used, particularly when
a large supply of water is required, as in the ease of the sugar-
plantations en the'Clefs' of the Nile in Northern Egypt, where they
are seen in great numbers. (5) Lastly the'T/ibm', a peculiar, very
light, and easily moved wooden wheel, which raises the water by
means of numerous fans. is used in the Lower Delta only and in
places where the level of the water in the canals remains nearly
the same. In order to distribute the water equally over flat fields,
they are sometimes divided into a number of small squares by means
of embankments of earth, 1 ft. in height, which, owing to the great
plasticity of the Nile mud, are easily opened or closed so as to
regulate the height of the water within them,

tefore describing the different Egyptian agrienltnral seasons,
we must first observe that they are no longer so sharply defined as
they probably were in ancient times. Besides the old crops, there
are now several others of recent introduction, and so extensively
grown as in some measure to revolutionise the modes of cultivation.
These are, maize, rice, the s11gar-eaue, cotton, ramieh. and indigo.
[ This last plant was known to Pliny, but it was probably grown in
his time only to a very limited extent.) The agrarian measures of
the Egyptian government are all directed towards the emaneipation
of farming from its dependence upon the inundatiuns, in order that
every ere ]: may he cultivated at the seasmi in which it thrives
hest. The emhanhments and various apparatus for the regulation
of the water supply, recently constructed or founded by the govern-
ment, vie in importance with the greatest ancient works ofthe kind.

(from riiht to Cairo) at the beginning of November, and in the
Delta about the end of December. The ground is seldom prepared
