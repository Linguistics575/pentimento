bol occupied the fourth place in the first group. The third symbol in
the second group, a reed, according to his hypothesis, would be e, and
this again was confirmed by the two reeds in Ptelemaius, representing
the Greek diphthong at. The fourth symbol in the second group, a curd
with a loop, was also, according to his expectation, found to occupy the
third place in the first. So, too, the square, representing p in the sec-
ond group was found to eerrespend with the first letter of the first
group. The sixth letter of the second group, a bird, did not occur in
the first group, but was repeated in its proper place in the second. The
seventh sign in the second group, a hand, would be t, but the same letter
was represented in the word Ptolemy by a semicircle. This discrepancy
might have misled the deeipherer, had he not rightly conjectured that
two different symbols might possibly exist for the same letter, and that
the semicircle at the end of Cleopatra represented the Coptic, feminine
article t, which, as he afterwards found, is placed at the end of many
female names. The eighth letter in the second frame he took to be r,
and this letter did not occur in the first frame. By this process the nine
letters of Cleopatra's name, or ten including the article, were ascertained,
while the different letters in the case ot Ptolemy were afterwards verilied
by comparing them with the names of ether kings, and particularly with

A visit to the ruins of Tunis is not only somewhat tedious and iron-
blesome, but will not repay the ordinary traveller, as they are now covered
by sand. The finest relics discovered there have, 1norenver, been c111 ried

gnman, a tent, and rugs fot. the journey.

Down to the middle of January, that is before the Nile is too low, the
traveller may proceed by the Mu'izz Canal from the Abt? Shekitk station

are huge, but dirty. The charge for the voyage to 85111 is about 45 fr..,

The ruins of Tell Fakes, the site of the ancient lecusa (0axo/j: si,

shen, and is called Phakos, or, without the article, Kos, hy the Copts,
are interesting to Egyptologists only. The district of Goshen (p. 411)
and the ancient city bear the same name. The scanty remains bear a.
few inscriptions, some of which date from the period of Ramses 11.

Donkeys and a guide should be ordered at Nit el-rAzz in the evening,
and the journey continued on the following morning.

The route from Abt Kebir traverses fertile fields, ehiefly plant-
ed with cotton, and frequently intersected by ditches and cuttings,

through which the traveller must ride or wade. This tract was
