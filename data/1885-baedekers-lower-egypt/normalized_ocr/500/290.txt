Starting from the Place Atab c1-Kadra, between the Muski and
the Ezbekiyeh (see above), the Boulevard Mohammad'Ali, 1860 yds.
in length, leads straight to the foot of the citadel. At the end of
this long street is the Place Sultan Ijasan (rn. F, 2), with two
large mosques. That on the left is the Gkmir RifiCiyeh (P1. 59),
named after an order of dervishes (p. 150), and erected entirely
at the expense of the mother of the ex-I0edive Isma'il, but still
1rniinished. On the right, adjoining the Place Ruméleh, rises the---

**Gftmi' Sultan Hasan (P1. 44 ], the'superb mosque', and the
finest existing monument of Arabian architecture. It was begun
in the year 757 of the llegira (A.0. 1356), and completed in three
years by Melik cu-lots" Abu'l-Ma% i IIasan ibn Jialatsn, but is
now in a neglected and dilapidated condition.

Sultdn J.lasqn, the sixth son of Sultan Nts.sir (p. 277), was still a minor
when he ascended the throne in A.D. 1346. At the end of the vigorous
reign of N'iteir (d. 1311), which lasted 43 years, the Mamelukes and emirs
revnlted, and the state of anarchy which now ensued was farther aggra-
vated hy the prevalence of the plague or'black death' (1338-49), which
exterminated whole families, whose property was immediately seized by
the government. Mahrizi (p. 242), with the usual exaggeration of Orientals,
records that no fewer than 15-20,000persons died at Cairo in a single day.
After having been dethroned in 1351, Hasan regained possession of his
seeptre three years later, but in 1361 he was again dethroned and ass-
assinated.

The lofty walls with their shallow niches, pierced with six
or seven windows one above the other, the huge gateway (see be-.
low"), and the S. minaret which is still preserved, present a ma-
jestie appearance, especially now that the incongruous additions
of later date have been removed. The building is in the form of an
irregular pentagon, 0n the E. side of which the minarets and the
mausoleum (see below) form symmetrical projections. The windows
in the side are, disposed somewhat irregularly, and the wall termi-
nates in a broad cornice. The angles of the eiliflee are embellished
with columns built into the wall, with a wreath of pendentives or
'stalaetites' at the top, forming to some extent a new order of capital.

According to the legend, Sultan Hasan, after the completion of
the work, ordered the arehiteet's hands to be cut off, in order that he
might not erect a second building of equal splendour. (Similar
myths in various parts of Europe record that architects have been
blinded from the same motive.) The mosque of Hagan has always
hven the. chief rallying point of the ringleaders ofinsnrreetions
and all kinds of public demonstrations.
