works of every kind except dramas. The, most ancient hieratic
papyrus now extant was written in the third millennium before
Christ. The language used in the hieroglyphic and hieratic writ-
ings alike was the ancient sacred dialect of the priests. The
Demotie writing, which was first employed in the 9th century
before. Christ, diverges so widely from the hieroglyphic that in
some of the symbols the original sign from which they were deriv-
ed is either not traceable, or can only be recognised with diffioulty.
The sign of the owl, for example, was curtailed to D. This writing
was ohieily used in social and commercial intercourse; as, for
example, in contracts and letters, whenceit was sometimes termed
the'letter oharacter' by the Greeks. The more the spoken language
diverged from the sacred dialect, which assumed a fixed form at a
very early period, the more urgent, became the want of a new mode,
of writing appropriate to the living language. Thus arose the demotie
style, and lastly, in the 3rd century after Christ, the Coptic, in
which thelanguage spoken at that time by the Christian Egyptians
was written, the characters being Greek, with a few supplementary
symbols borrowed from the demotic [ such as 99 sh, q f, di ch,
2h: 60,'sj, and the syllabic t tf). Many Coptic writings,
chiotly of a religious character, have been handed down to us, the
finest of them being the books of the Old and New Testament.
Down to the end of the 18th century scholars had been misled
in their endeavours to find a clue to the hieroglyphic writing by a
work of the Egyptian grammarian Jlorapollon, translated into
Greek, who represented the characters as being purely symbolieal,
and as having each an independent meaning ofits own. At length
in 1700 M. Boussard, a French offloer of artillery, discovered at
tosetta a trilingual inscription (pp. 449 et ser), in hieroglyphic
and demotie characters and in Greek. The demotie part of the in-
scription was examined by M. oSilvestre de Sacy, a French savant,
and Hr. Ackerblad, a Swede, in 1802, and, ohiefly owing to the
exertions of the latter, the signifieation of a number of the symbols
was ascertained. In 1814-18 the hieroglyphic part of the inscrip-
tion was studied by Dr. Th. Young, an English soholar, who, by
comparing it with the demotie part, succeeded in dividing it into
a number of corresponding groups, and, by directing his attention to
the eartouehes (p. 117), discovered the signification of several of the
hieroglyphic symbols. In 1821 Francois Champollion, usually sur-
nam'ed Le Jeune, who possessed an intimate acquaintance with the
Coptic language and literature, directed his attention to the hiero-
glyphics, and in the course of the following year discovered the
hieroglyphic alphabet, which afforded him a clue to the whole of
.hhe ancient Egyptian literature. His method, which he has cs-
plained in his hieroglyphic grammar, though at first vehemently
opposed, soon obtained able adherents. who after his early death
in 1832 zealously took 11p and prosecuted the same line of research.
