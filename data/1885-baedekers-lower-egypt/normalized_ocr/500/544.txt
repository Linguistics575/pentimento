rounding regions. Isolated by the sea and desert from the rest of
the earth and its history, it has yet, from a very remote period,
formed the highly revered vestibule of all the temples of the trivi-
lized world'. (0. Bitter.) The Mount Sinai group, with its masses
of granite, forms the S.W. half of the peninsula, while the long
limestone range of Jebel et-Tih, beginning at the Isthmus of Suez,
first turns to the S.E., and then sends forth a number of ramifiea-
tions to the E. and N.E. The Sinai group forms a watershed from
which weidis descend to the E. and W., i. e. to the guifs of Suez
and'Ahaba respectively; while the'River of Egypt', which is men-
tioned as the boundary of Palestine in the Bible, and is now the
Wadi e1-'Arish, descends from the Jebel et-Tih towards the N. to
the Mediterranean. Those parts of the Tth Mountains across which
our route lies rise to a moderate height, and are formed of limestone,
chalk, and, to a smaller extent, of sandstone.

Tue MOUNT SINAI GROUP.'This huge range, composed of primeeval gneiss
and granite, or, in more precise geological terminology, of colourless quartz,
flesh-eoloured feISpar, green hornblende, and black slate, rising in majestic
and precipitous masses and furrowed by vertical clefts, extends from
Serhi'tl to the Om Sh√©mar, and from the Om Shiimar to the Riis Moham-
med. Since the time of their formation these crystalline masses have
undergone no geological change, but have reared their summits above
the ocean from the beginning of time, unaffected by the transitions of
the Silurian or Devonian, the Triassic 0r ehalk periods. At the base
only do these venerable mountains show any trace of alteration. Thus
the lied Sea has on one side thrown a girdle of coral around Mount Sinai,
and so in recent times produced a coast district; while towards the N. the
sea, during the chalk period, has formed the limestone plateau of the desert
of Tih fA000 ft. above the sea-level), which stretches across the whole of
Sinai to Mount Lebanon. The crystalline masses of the Sinai chain,
which extend from N. to S. for a. distance of about ao M., exhibit no
great variety. The whole range forms a central nucleus traversed by
dinrites and porphyries.' (O. Frans.)

Inhabitants. Amid the sterile mountains and valleys of the peninsula,
some 4-5000 Beduins manage to obtain a livelihood. They generally have
remarkably slight figures, and regular, sharply marked features. The
boys, who follow the camels and wait upon travellers, are particularly
graceful and engaging; the men are employed in conveying millstones,
charcoal, and other wares to Egypt; they supply travellers (who are
chiefly pilgrims ofthe Greek faith) with camels, hunt the mountain goat,
celebrate festivals, and, in the W. part of the peninsula at least, rarely
indulge in the sanguinary feuds which the different tribes formerly
waged with one another. Those oeeupying the E. and the N.E. of Arabia
Petreea are of a wilder and more warlike character; the boys and girls,
and occasionally the men, drive the goats and the Speckled sheep, which
call to mind the artifiee resorted to by Jacob, tn the meagre pastures in
Summer, while the women remain in the tents to look after their children
and household work. In the best watered parts of the peninsula, the
Beduius have built themselves huts, and cultivate plantations of dates, the
must productive of which are in the wiidi Firkin (p. MD), and in the neigh-
bourhood of Tits, 0n the Red Sea. In all other districts the inhabitants
live in tents: The Tiiwara are good-natured, honest, and generally of
nuble bearing; they are quite free from the sordid eupidity of the lower
ciuxses in Egypt, and the name of'Iie1litlp' is used by them as a term of
reproach. They do not practise polygamy, and their families are gener-
ally nnall. The young Beduins have opportunities of seeing the girls of
their tribe unveiled, while tending their herds on the mountains, and
of forming, attachments to them. Marriages from iuelination are there-
