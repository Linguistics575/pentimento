and a disk, on a lotus flower, and attended on her right and left by
female genii with long wings. Each of the genii bears in her
hand the pen of the goddess of truth. The ruins of the temple are
now so confused that it is impossible to form even an approximate
idea of its original form. A number of blocks resembling mill-
stones show that the shafts of the columns were round. The
capitals were embellished with the Hathor mask. On the N. side
lies an unusually large eapitat, in granite, and upwards of 7ft. in
circumference. Numerous remains of pillars and architraves also
still exist. The steps which led to the roof of the temple, and pro-
bably resembled those at Dendera and Edfu, were also of granite.
A huge block is still to be seen here with four steps attached to it.

The ruins of Mendes, 11 M. to the E. of Mamylra, whence they
may be visited in one day, have recently been excavated, and
it is not unlikely that they may afford a rich spoil to the learned
explorer.

b. From Mam.dira to Damietta.

ho M. RAILWAY from Talkha (m_n the left bank of the arm of the Nile,
nppnsite tn Nany" 1ra; ferry in 5 min.., 1/2 fr.) The trains leave Talkha
at 2. 55 and 11 p. m. and reach Damietta at k.) 35 p.m. and 1.20 a. m. (fares
29 pies. 20, 10 pics. 20 paras). - From Tanta (whence the train comes to
Talkha) to Damieita, 711/2 M., in 31/3-41/3 hrs. (fares "or 36 pias.).

The train follows the left bank of the Damietta arm of the Nile.
The land is carefully cultivated in the neighbourhood of Manylra,
and we. observe a number of steam engines which are used for the
irrigation of the soil. The train stops at (14 M.) Shi'rbin, an
iusignifieant little town built of crude bricks. The next stations are
REES ei-Khattg and Kafr eh-Poa.t.ttkh. The latter lies in a monoton-.
ous, sandy plain, extending as far as Lake Burlus, and covered in
summer with crops of water-melons. An important melon market
is held here in July. The railway-station of Damietta lies on the
left bank of the arm of the Nile (ferry in 5 min.'t 1 fit).

40 M. Damietta, Arabic Dumyif.t, situated between the Da-
mietta branch of the Nile and Lake Menzaleh, about ft M. from the
sea, possesses a harbour, annually frequented by about 500 vessels
of an aggregate burden of 40,000 tons.

"BEwrltAND's INN, small; French Jaudlord. European Cuft kept by
Grsii, a Greek, who also lets a few rooms. Post-office and Arabic telegraph-
oifien. A ll, uman Catholic, and a Greek church.

Seen from the railway station, situated near the harbour, Da-
mietta, which now has a population of 43,630 souls, presents an
irnposing appearance, withits lofty houses flanking the river. The
interior of the town, however, by no means fulfils the traveller's
expectations. On every side lie ruinous old buildings and walls;
many of the houses seem to be uninhabited; and new edifiees are
sought for in vain. There are few European residents here, the
insignificant trade of the place being chiefly in the hands of native
merchants (Arabs and Levantines). Small vessels only can enter
