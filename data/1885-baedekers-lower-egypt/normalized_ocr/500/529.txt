Fayam. BIRKET EL-timu) N. 9. Route. 465

tlgs, is very muddy. After a ride of fully three hours we reach the
looks and the bridge Kamitir Hasan. The large body of water of
the canal, which is conducted from the Baht Ytisnf, here falls into
a channel, Which, with many ramifications, conveys it to the fields
of 1lenhtar.

The large village of'yrahiir (rail. station, see p. 463) lies on the
border of the second plateau of the province. Those who visit Ha-
witra (p. 460) reach the first plateau, while the second is crossed on
the way to f.? enldor; the third lies at our feet when looking down on
the Birket srl-forts from the great ACihn, i.e. the ruin-strewn hill
to the N. of the village. The handsome house of the Shékh el-
Beled offers good accommodation, and even quarters for the night.
The traveller should make a bargain here for a boat with the shékh
of the fishermen. About 30 fr. for the day, and a balsshtsh for the
rowers (of whom (r-8 are necessary for speed), are demanded.

f? enhtsr stands on the site of an ancient, and not unimportant,
town, of Which large heaps of ruins still remain. Roman walls are
traceable in many places. A large building has recently been fri-
cavated by the peasants for the sake of obtaining the hard bricks
of which it is built, but part of it has already been removed. No
remains of columns or inscriptions have been met with.

From fysnh1h, to the Birket (sl-Furl") takes about 11/2 hr. The route
leads through sugar-plantation;. We reach the lake near the peninsula
known as el-t7eeireh, on which stands a heap of ruins. A short distance
to the W. are the scanty remains of eZ-Hammctm. The traveller, after
having ridden to the lake, should not forget to order his horses, which
return to fienhtlr, to await him for the return-journey at the spot where
he has quitted them, or to order them to meet him in good time on the
bank of the lake by Nezleh (see p. 464).

The Birket eHrartm ('lake of the horns') owes its name to
its shape, which resembles that of slightly bent cows' horns. It
measures 34M. in length, and, at its broadest part, is about 61/231.
wide. It is situated on the same level as the Mediterranean, and
its depth averages 13 ft. The greenish water is slightly brackish
(scarcely tlt for drinking), and abounds in fish, some of which
are very palatable. The right of fishing is let by government, and
the whole of the fishermen dwelling 011 the banks of the lake are
in the service of the lessee, who receives one-half of the catch.
The boats (merkeb) are very simply constructed, being without
deck or mast; the traveller must take up his quarters on the floor-
ing in the stern; none of the boats have sails, for, as the fish af-.
ways go in the same direction as the wind, the fishermen have to
row against the wind in order to catch them. Numerous pelicans,
wild duck, and other water-fowl, frequent the lake. The banks
are extremely sterile; on the N. side are barren hills of considerable
height. In the middle of the lake rises a mass of rock, resembling
a table, and serving as a landmark. Near the S. bank, from E. to
W., lie the villages of Kaf'r Tamiyeh, Tirseh, f.? erthth, Abuksa, Ile-
shuai, and A512 Gonsheh; the ruins of Dhneh are situated on the N.
