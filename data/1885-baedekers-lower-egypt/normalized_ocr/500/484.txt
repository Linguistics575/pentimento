426 Route 7. THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ. From Suez

far as Lake Timstl.i, as fossil eonehylia, particularly varieties of the
Spondylus, 110w occurring in the Red Sea, but not in the Mediter-.
ranean, have been found there. The isthmus, however, is 11ndoubt-
edly of very ancient formation, having been as broad at the time
of the journey of Herodotus CB. C). 454) as it is now. With regard
to the formation of the isthmus we may quote the following passage

from M. J. Sehlehlen :--

'If we suppose a strait substituted for the Isthmus, it is not difficult
to foresee what would happen. The waves of the Red Sea entering it at
one end would soon choke it with sand, while the same result would be
caused on the Mediterranean side by the prevalent N. and N.W. winds, the
Etesian winds of antiquity. About halfway between the seas these dif-
ferent agents would come into collision, and throw up a bar of sand, the
situation of which would naturally be a. little to the N. of the central
point, as the action of the waves on the S. side would be more regular
than that of the wind on the N., and thus be generally able to penetrate
farther. This bar would gradually be raised by the action of the waves,
and that at an accelerating rate in proportion as its growth would
present an obstacle to the motion of the water, until its level came to
be above the level of low tide. The surface would then become dry by
exposure to the air, and the loose sand, blown about by the winds,
would form sand-hills of the kind found on every sea-shore. In this
way the connection between the seas would at length be cut off, and the
barrier of El-Gisr formed'.

The Isthmus of Suez has, from a very early period, formed an
important highway between Asia and Africa. A considerable part
of its area was occupied with lakes and swamps, while the higher
points were fortified to prevent the passage of invaders. Near
Pelusium, the'key of Egypt', at the E. extremity of the curve
formed by the coast of the Delta, to the SE. of Port Sa'id,
were situated the passes by which the empire of the Pharaohs
was entered. The high road from Asia skirted the coast of the
Mediterranean, passing Il, hinoeolura (the modern El-'Arish, p. 478),
traversed the neck of land separating the, Sirbouie Lake from the
Mediterranean, and led by Casinm (see below), with the temple
of Jupiter Casius (the modern Bits el-Kasr11ni (), and by the
town of Gerrha bf, to Pelusium (p. 435 ], whence several roads di-

+ The agnomen of Casius is derived by Brugsch from the Semitic
Egyptian word Hazi or JIazio-n, signifying the asylum, or land of the
asylum, a name which applies admirably to a shrine situated on the ex-
treme E. margin of the Egyptian frontier. He also identifies the Baal-
zaphon of the Bible, which lay'beside Pi-hahiroth' (Exod. xiv. 9), with
this hill and the shrine of Zeus Casius. The word Ba" alZephou oecm-s in
a papyrus in the British Museum in the form Battli Zepilna, and is the
Semitic equivalent ('lord of the north') of the Egyptian Ammon. Pi-
hahiroth again literally means the'entrance to the reed and papyrus
swamps', by which was doubtless meant the Sirbonie Lake, so that Pi..
huhiroth itself probably lay at the W. end of the lake at the entrance
to the neck of land when approached from Egypt (p.'iiil).'

"( iom-ha (plur. of the Greek gerrhon, a wall, or fortliled place) is
identified by lirugseh with Anbu (a word also signifying foriif1ed place),
which is mentioned as early as the 19th Dynasty. This place was called
8er ('wall') by the Ilebrews (Gen. xvi. 7; XXV. Ir, Exod. xv. 22;
1 Sam. xv. "i; xxvii. 8). The town lay a little to the S.W. of I'i-hahi-
ruth, which is mentioned above.
