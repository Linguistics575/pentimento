IX. Buildings of the Mohammedans.
Mosques. Dwelling Houses.
By Franz-Begr, Architect at Cttipo.

The Mohammedan style of architecture in the valley of the Nile
was not, as might perhaps be expected, the immediate successor
ofthe Egyptian, but was separated from it by that of the early
('hristian epoch, a period of six or seven centuries. This new style
was not of native growth, but was imported from abroad, being of
Arabian origin, eonsiderahly modified by the forms of art which the
victorious Arabs found in vogue among the Ilyzantines, and by
those of Persian art of the era of the Sassanides. Different as the
Arabian buildings at Baghdad and Cairo may appear from those at
Tunis and in Spain, they all possess certain features in common.
The fundamental idea of all Mohammedan architecture originated
in the nomadic life of the Arabs. The tent was the prototype,
alike of the house and of the temple. The walls in particular, with
their carpet-like decoration, and their extensive, nnrelievetl sur-
fares, remind one of this origin. This style of architecture is that
of the fickle children of the desert, whose cditiees, even after they
had become a settled and stationary nation, continue to convey an
idea of nnsuhstantiality, and who never attained to a clear per-
m ption of the proportion to he observed between the support and
the burden to he borne. This defect is less apparent in cases where
thr Arabian builders were brought under the inflnenee, of more
riiilised nations, where they employed columns, entahlatnres, and
urhtr fragments of ruined editiees which they found available, or
"hue, as somctimes happened, they were aided by Byzantine or
other foreign architects, than in purely Arabian cditiees like the
.Allsat ihra in hpnin; hut in every case the national characteristic
