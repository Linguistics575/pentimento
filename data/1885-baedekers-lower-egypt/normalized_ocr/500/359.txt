shows some interesting Byzantine carving and mosaics in ivory, now
blackened and discoloured with age. Many valuable art relies have
been removed from the church since 1860. A number of old pictures
of saints which still remain, some of them 011 a goldground and with
well preserved colours, possess no artistic value. Above a door to
the right of the high-altar, engraved in wood, is the Coptic inserip-
tion,'Greetings to the Temple of the Fathert' Below it is a mod-
ern Arabic inscription with the date 1195. - This church may be
regarded as the original model of all the older Egyptian-rl-tine
churches in Which the Coptie Christians now worship'.

The basilica consists of a nave and aisles. The tribune, the two side
chapels, the sanctuary, and the parts corresponding to the senatorium
and matroneum of northern basilieas are raised a few steps above the
level of the nave and aisles, and are almost all as high as the nave,
while the aisles are pro-
vided with galleries.
The nave and tribune
have open roofs, that of
the latter being sup-
ported by elliptical
beams, and both being
probably of later: date
than the church itself.
The left side-chapel is
surmounted by an Ara-
hian dome, while the
