or (A)? © I The readiugis, however, facilitatedby the Get that,

in order to ensure the correct pronunciation of each syllabie sign,
none but the most definite sounds were added toit. The symbol eeeh

men, for example, is never written jh, ees, asitmight be, but al-
most invariably eee or eee. It represents a ehess-board with
AM

figures. The iileographie signs, or determinatives, are placed as

explanatory adjuncts after the phonetically written groups. They

are indispensable in elucidating the signifieation, for the Egyptian

language, having been arrestedinits development, is poor, and full

of homonyms and synonyms. The symbol m dnkh, for ex-

ample, means'to live','to swear','the ear','the mirror', and'the
goat'. The reader would easily fall into errors, such as mistaking
énkh nefer for'a beautiful life' instead of'a beautiful goat', if the
determinative, or e1ass, .sign did not come to his aid, and show to
what category of ideas the object belonged. Thus, after énkh, the
goat, the Egyptians either placed a figure of that animal, or a piece

of hide with a tail, which served as a common symbol for all
quadrupeds. The symbol used to represent a particular word is
termed a special, while one chosen to denote a class is termed a

general, determinative. An elephant% placed after the group
of._.n, ab,'the elephant', is a special determinative, while a

lock of hair m placed after "R senem,'the mourning', is a

general determinative, a lock of hairbeing the conventional emblem
of grief, as the men were in the habit of cutting off their hair in
token of sorrow. A. word is frequently followed by several deter-

minatives. Thus - fish is'the cedar'; but the wood of the
tree being scented, the group representing Etsh was not only fol-

lowed by the figure of a tree, but also by the symbol i2, which

signifies that a perfumed object is spoken of. The special deter-
minative always precedes the general. Symbols that were not
capable of being very clearly engraved on stone were sometimes
omitted, and. the special determinative given alone. Instead of
