BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS. 179

junction of the walls and ceiling is generally masked by a pendent
cornice, or a cornice with a frieze for inscriptions. The beams
used in the coustructionofthe ceilings are generally square at both
ends to a length of 3-5 ft., beyond Which they are rounded below,
and frequently carved. The interstices between the beams are
sometimes divided into'coffers'; and proper eoffered ceilings also
occur, as in the mosque f? alil1ei1i1tn Ythimf in the citadel (p.264).
In the corners of the apartments, as well as under the iirine, ipal
arehitraves, pendants are generally placed to conceal the angles.
The earliest ceilings appear to have consisted of palm-trunes, and
then covered with boardsofsycamore wood, which were often richly
carved. The space immediately in front of the lribla (prayer niche)
usually terminated in a dome borne by columns. Spherical and
groined vaulting was used for smaller chambers only; but the
arcades ofthe Barlstsli mosque (p. 282), with their depressed spher-
ical brick vaulting, form an exception to this rule. In secular
buildings the use of vaulting is much more frequent, as in the
ease of the eity-gate Bib en-Nasir (p. 230) and other arched pas-
sages. The entire ground-floors of palaces are also sometimes
vaulted, and bridges and aqueduets were usually executed in barrel
vaulting, or with pointed arches.

The Decorations generally consist of panelling or flat paintings,
destitute of structural meaning, while pilasters, cornices, and other
architectural embellishments are rare. This species of ornamenta-
tion was doubtless originally suggested by the carpets, fringes,
and mats, used by the Arabs for covering their walls. The stalaetite
eorbellings, on the other hand, which mask the union of the vertical
with the horizontal parts of the building, and take the place of the
vaulting used in western architecture, are of a more structural
character; but even these perform no real architectural function,
angl form a mere fantastic decoration of the angles of the domes.

The panel and frieze decorations are either foliage, geometrical
figures, or written characters. The Foliage is usually shaped in
rectangular relief, with a few incisions to divide the broader
surfaces. The moulding is generally more or less in conformity
with the spirit of the classical style, but in the e, onventional
arabesques the leaves and other parts of plants of a southern
climate are recognisable. The Geometrical Figures consist either
of a kaleidoscopie arrangement of constantly recurring fantastic
forms, or of a series of intertwined and broken lines. Lastly,
the Arabic Written Characters with which the friezes are often
decorated, and more particularly the Ct1fie and Sullus characters,
are peculiarly well adapted for ornamental purposes, as they
resemble decorative foliage, although destitute of its strictly sym-
metrical and. continuous character. When the writing is em-
ployed for lengthy inscriptions in low relief, the ground on which
it is placed is generally covered with slightly raised arabesques.
