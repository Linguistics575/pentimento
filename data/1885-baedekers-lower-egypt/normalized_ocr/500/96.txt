7 4 FARM PRODUCE. I Mt

triet of Egypt has its favourite erop; in Upper Egypt, between
AssMn andEsneh, the penicillaria, and in the Delta rice are ohiefly l
cultivated; while the peculiar looking indigo-plant, a rich profusion
of grapes, amia plentiful growth of cucumbers and melons are seen
in every part of the country. The summer cultivation, of which the
'Sharilsi' land alone is eapable, is carried on from April toAugust ",
but many of the plants grown at this season require a longer period
of dovelopmont, extending throughout the whole of the autumn
and even part of the winter. This is particularly the ease with the
rice erop, which is sown in May, hut does not attain maturity till
the middle of November, and with the eotton-plant, sown in April.
and harvested in Novemher or December. A large quantity of cotton
is also yielded by a second harvest from the pruned plant in the
month of August, in the second year of Its growth. Summer is also
the principal season for the tohaeco Crop.

(3) The Autumn Season ('En-Nub√©ri' or'rhl-l) entiri'), as already
observed, is of very subordinate importance, being sometimes oe-
eupied, as in the ease of rice and eotton7 in bringing the summer
emps to maturity. It is also the shortest season, extending to little
more than seventy days; and yet within this hrief spare the rieh
soil of the llelta yields its harvest of maize, which, next to wheat,
is the most important of the lig) ptian cereals. (The annual yield
of these two grains is said to amount to 24 million bushels.) The
autumn enltivation lasts from August to October, and sometimes
till Nuvemher. At the beginning of October, throughout the whole
Delta from hluer, toAlexandria, the. traveller will observe an almost t
unbroken ocean of maize-fields, seldmn varied except by the low
villages, resembling mounds of earth, with their neighbouring, palm t
groves. The picture of teeming fertility which the country then
presents far surpasses that presented by the rich noair.e-tlohls, of
south-eastern Europe. In Central Jigypt maize. is also an important
Summer crop. Along with it is sometimes cultivated the less com-
mon Sorghum, or llura, or Indian millet, which is eaten by the
poorest fellfuhin only. It is, however, largely eensnmed hy the P, ed-.
uins en the Arabian side of the Nile, and in the SMin and Nubia
forms the chief food of the inhabitants. Another plant cultivated
in autumn, rarely seen in Egypt, but emnmen in the Stuhin and
Nubia, is the trepieal SeSame, from which oil is largely prepared.
