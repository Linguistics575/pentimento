beams exclusively, extending from the abacus (pr crowning slab)
of one column to that of another; and the rectangular spaces th us
formed were filled with slabs of stone, adorned sometimes with
astronomical designs. The chief characteristics of the outer p arts

a deep shadow. The architrave is generally inscribed with hiero-
glyphies, so that its structural offiett is rendered less apparent; but
