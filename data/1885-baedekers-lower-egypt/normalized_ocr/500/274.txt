244 Route 3. CAIRO. Population.

residenee of the Khedive, and of the ministers and principal au-
thorities, and is presided over by a governor of its own. Owing
to the secluded habits of the Mohammedan families, and in
consequence of the fact that a large section of the lower classes of
the community have no fixed abode, it is a very difficult matter to
ascertain the number of the inhabitants with even approximate
precision. Judging from the average annual number of births in
Egypt and at Cairo, the population of the city may be estimated
at 400,000 souls, although at the census of 1882 it was returned
as308, 108 only. The number of resident Europeans is about 21,000,
including 7000 Italians, 4200 Greeks, 31000 French, 1600 English,
1600 Austrians, and 1200 Germans. Natives of all the principal
Oriental states are also to be found at Cairo. The mass of the
population consists of Egypto-Arabian townspeople (p. 48), Pellif.o
settlers (p. 39), Copts o. 42j, Turks o. 52), and Jews (p. 53),
the last of whom number 7000 souls. Besides the natives and the
European residents, the traveller will frequently encounter negroes
of various races, Northern Africans, Beduins, Syrians, Persians,
Indians, and other Oriental settlers.

The Hospitals mentioned at p. 234 are fitted up in the European
style, and so likewise is the Military School (Ecotes Militaires;
in the rAhbisiyel0, with its four departments (statr., arty.li.ery., Pa-
valry, and infantry), connected with which there is a Tre Merinary
School. Cairo also possesses a Girls" School, maintained by govern-
ment (founded through the exertions of iii. Dor, a Swiss), and a
Cliemieal-Pharrnaceutieal Laboratory, presided over by M. Gastinel,
and possessing an excellent pharmaceutical eo11eetion. The medi-
cines required for all the hospitals in the country are prepared at
the laboratory, and the yield of the 12 saltpetre manufactories of
Egypt (about 1000 tons per annum) is tested here.

T he Police Foree (Zubtiyeh, Pl. 80), an admirably organisedi In-
stitution, consists ofabout 300 offieials, including a number ofE uro-
peans [ ii'iyii" y" Italians), who are very obliging to strangers, and
who preside so ef1'eotioally over the public safety that the traveller
may explore the remotest and dirtiest purlieus of the city without
apprehension of danger. If, however, he should have any cause
for complaint, he should lay the matter before his consulate (11.0.)
