cannot help feeling that the style fails to give entire Lesthetie
satisfaction. Want of symmetry in plan, poverty ofarticnlation,
ins, uNcieney of plastic, decoration. and an incongruous mingling of
stone and wood, are the imperfections which strike most northern
erities. The architects, in fact, bestowed the whole of their attention
on the decoration of snrftwes; and down to the present day the
Arabian artists have always displayed fargreater ability in tracing,
elegant outlines, and designing the most complicated ornaments
and geometrical iigures on plane surfaces, than in the treatment
and proportioning of masses. Although we occasionally see difti-.
culties of construction well Overcome, as in the case of the interior
of the Bib en-Nay, these instances seem rather to be successful
experiments than the result of sirientitie workmanship. The real
exvellence of the Arabian architects lay in their skill in masking
abrupt angles by the use of'stalaetites' or brackets.

If we enquire into the causes of these defects in the olevelop-
ment of art we shall find that the climate is one of the principal.
Its remarkable mildness and the mreness of rain have, enabled ar-
chitects to dispense with much that appears essential to the inhab-
itant of more northern latitudes; and hence the imperfect de-.
velopment and frequent absence of corniees. The extraordinary
durability of wood in Egypt, again, has led to its being used in
the eonstructiou of walls, and in connection with stone, in a man-
ner which would never occur to northern architects. Another
circumstance unfavourable to the development of native art has
doubtless been the ease with which the architects obtained abun-.
dance of pillars and capitals in ancient buildings ready to their
hand. There were also political obstacles to the progress ot'art,
such as frequent intestine struggles and dissensions, and the
sway of despotic rulers and their servile offieers; and, lastly, the
characteristic Egyptian tenacity and veneration for tradition and
religious precept have not been without their influence. The ori-
ginal design ofthe mosque, forexample, was borrowed from Mecca.
and no deviation could he made from its plan; and this accounts
for the invariable recurrence of the same forms in the mosques of
Egypt. In a few instances architects ventured to introduce in-
novations, but they never failed to revert sooner or later to the
established style. The external architecture of private houses,
however, being unfettered by religious considerations, might have
Progressed more favourably but for the powerful iuiluenee of super-
stitinn and fear. An external display of wealth, according to the
popular notion, drew upon its possessor the'evil eye' of the cove-
tons. the vonm-qnence of which was misfortune or death, while, on
the other hand, it afforded the government a pretext for extorting
heavy tum; from the occupant. It therefore became customary
with the I-Igyptians to restrict any appearance of luxury to the
interior of their harems. where it is exhibited in the sumptuous
