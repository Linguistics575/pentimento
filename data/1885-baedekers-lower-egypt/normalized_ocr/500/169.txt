women that the Muslims generally dislike to see them praying or
occupying themselves with religion. The practice of wearing veils
is not eontined to the Muslim women, but is universal in the East.
An Oriental lady would, indeed, regard it as an affront to be per-
mitted to mingle in society With the same freedom as European
ladies. Even in the Christian churches, the place for women is
often separated from the men's seats by a railing. The peasant and
Beduin women, on the other hand, are often seen unveiled. The
case with which Ei-Isl/un permits divorce is due to Mohammed's per-
sonal proclivities. A single word from the husband suffices to banish
the wife from his house, but she retains the marriage-portion
which she has received from her husband. The children are brought
up in great subjection to their parents, often showing more fear than
love for them.

The repetition of PRAYERS five times daily forms one of the
chief occupations of faithful Muslims. The hours of prayer (adlin)
are proolaimed by the mueddins (or muezzins) from the minarets of
the mosques: (l) Maghrib, a little after sunset; (Pi)'Asht" s, night-
fall, about 11/2 hour after sunset; (ji) Subh, daybreak; [ 4) Duhr,
n1id (lay; (5)'Ayr, afternoon, about 11/L 1101i: before sunset. These
periods of prayer also serve to mark the divisions of the day. The
day is also divided into two periods of 12 hours each, beginning
from sunset, so that where clocks and watches are used they require
to he set daily. Most people however content themselves with the
sonorons call of the mueddin: Alldhu akbar (three times); ashhadu
an M Mha ili' All√©h; ashhadu anna Muhammeda rrasttlu'lMh
(twice); heyya'ala-: s.mlth (twice); lteyya'ata't-futttlv (twice),
Alldhu akbar (twice), IO ildlla itt'ullth; i. e.'Allih is great; I
testify that there is 110 God but Allah, and Mohammed is the pro-
phet of Allih; come to prayer; come to worship; Allih is great;
there is 110 God but Allih'. This call to prayer sometimes also
reverberates thrillingly through the stillness of night, to incite
to devotion the faithful who are still awake. - The duty of
washing before prayer is a sanitary institution, and tanks are pro-
vided for the purpose in the court of every mosque. In the desert,
where water is scarce and precious, the faithful are permitted to
use sand for this religious ablution.

The person praying must remove his shoes or sandals and turn
his face towards Mecca, as the Jews and some of the Christian sects
turn towards Jerusalem ortowards the East. 1htg worshipper begins
by putting his hands to the lobes of his ears, and then holds them
a little below his girdle; and he intersperses his recitations from
the fiorin with certain prostrations performed in a given order. On
Fridays the midday recital of'prayer takes place three quarters of an
hour earlier than usual, and is followed by asermon, preached from
the Mambar o. 184) by a respectable, but unlearned layman,
whose audience sits 011 the ground in rows before him. Fridayis not,
