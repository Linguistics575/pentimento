6. Suez,'Ain Mitsa, and the Red Sea,

On arriving at the busy station, the traveller is beset by a number
of eieerones who speak broken English, French, and other languages.

Hotels. IIGTEL SUEZ (P1. a), situated on the coast, at a considerable
distance from the station, a first-e1ass house, fitted up in the English
style, and kept by a German; board and lodging th. per day Jess if a
prolonged stay is made). There are two scales of charges: (1st) break-
fast 4, tiffln i, dinner 65.; (2nd) 2, 2, and M. respectively. Bottle of ale
or porter Is. 6d. The servants are Indians, - quiet, attentive people,
with delicate features and of slender, build. English Church service On
Sundays. The shady court of the hotel affords a pleasant lounge. News-
papers for the use of visitors. - HGTEL d'ORIENT, in the Rue de Colmar,
the principal street, 1/4 M. from the station; pension, with wine, 10 fr.
per day; unpretending, but tolerable. - Most of the restaurants and cafes
are very disreputable-looking. Ladies should not walk in the streets of
Suez after dark.

Post and Telegraph Offices (Egyptian) at the station. Telegrams to
foreign countries should be despatched by the wires of the Eastern
Telegraph Company (English).

Consuls. British, Mr. West; French, M. Cravery; Austrian, Hr. Mar-
guiti; Russian, 88%. Costa (p. 420); Spanish, Sen. Nacadi.

Disposition of Time. If the weather is calm, the harbour and en-
trance to the canal may be visited by small boat. Calm weather is also
very desirable for the excursion by land to the Springs of Moses (p. 419),
as the driving sand is excessively disagreeable in a. high wind. The
beautiful clearuess of the green water, with its curious shells and sea-
weed, and the almost invariable beauty of the sunsets render a boating
excursion here unusually attractive. The situation of the sandhanks and
of the navigable channel is of course best inspected at low tide.

A charge of 6-8s. is usually made for a rowing-boat fnr half-a-day.
The hoatmen are apt to be extortionate in their demands, as travellers
on their way to UI? from India, and making a short stay only, are often
too lavish in their payments. In fine weather a day may be pleasantly
spent as follows. Row early in the morning down the gulf to the
mouth of the canal, ascend the canal for a short distance, and land
at the usual starting-point for the Springs of Moses. Donkey (which
is brought in the boat from Suez) 5-6 fr. for the day. We now traverse
the desert, which extends down to the sea-shore, tn the (2 hrs.) Springs,
where luncheon (brought from Suez) may be taken. An hour Or more
may be spent here in resting or looking for shells on the shore, after
which we regain the boat in 2 hrs. more. We next row (again taking
the donkey with us) to the quays, land there, and dismiss the boat. Re-
mounting the donkey, we ascend to the docks, inspect them at our
leisure, and then return to the hotel. The whole excursion may be ae-
eomplished without much fatigue in about 8 hrs, If the wind is favour-
able, the traveller may sail as far as the se-called caravan landing-place
(comp. Nap, p. MO, whence the Springs are reached in half-an-hour, but
the charge for the boat is then higher, and if the wind is favourable in
one direction, it is adverse in the other, so that nothing is to be gained
by this arrangement, unless donkeys are altogether dispensed with. In
stormy weather the pier and decks only can be visited with comfort.

The'Ar-ip MOUNTAINS (p. M8) may be ascended on the S.W side,
but not without great difficulty, as the rocks are bare and precipitous,
and competent guides are not procurable. The view, according to Fraas,
is most beautiful and interesting, as the whole of the isthmus and the
canal lie at the speetator's feet like a vast map.
