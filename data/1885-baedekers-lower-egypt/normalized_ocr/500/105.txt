ANIMAL KINGDOM. 83



Brown Booby (Sula tibep; Arab. shomet), several peculiar species of Gulls
and Sea Swallows (Lawns leitcophthalmus, Lapus gelastes, L (rrus Hempeichii,
Sterne media, Sterna Bergii, Sterna all) igena, Sterna infuscata, and Anous
stolidus), and the singular-looking, Dramas (Arab. ltankih0, on the shores
of the Red Sea. The Flamingo (Phenicopterus aatiquorum; Arab. bdsha
wash) haunts the Red Sea and the lagoons of the Delta throughout the
whole year, usually eongregating in enormous fligltts, and breeds in the
region to the E. of Lake 3ienziileh.

IV. REPTILES. Uf this class of animals there are but few Species
peculiar to Egypt. The Salmmmders and Batrachians (Arab. glufda'a) are
but scantily represented. There are about twenty species of Snakes (Arab.
ta'bdn), including the Horned Viper (C'erastes; Arab. mokpivenel0 which
'appears in the ancient inscriptions as a hieroglyphic, the Echis (Arab. gha-
ribeh or dashshttsha), the Cobra da Capella, Hooded, or Spectacle Snake
(Naja Haje; Arab. ndsirer), the Telescopus (Arab. abu' (tytin), the Psam-
'nophis (Arab. abet ri, tMr), the Tropidonotus, the Peviops (Arab. art'am), the
Zamenis (Arab. gidrn'i), and the Eryx (Arab. d (msds). The horned viper,
the eehis, and the hooded snake are highly venomous, and their bite is
often fatal; the other snakes are not venomous, hut their bite is sometimes
dangerous. The Egyptian snake-elrarmers (Arab. htitoi), all of whom be-
long to a gipsy tribe (ghagar), usually exhibit a number of cobras, the
teeth in which the venom is secreted having been extracted (comp. p. 81).

To the order of the Suzu'itms belong the Crocodile (C-rocodilus tudgavis;
Arab. timsdh), of which there are several varieties, and the Mottitor (1'a-
'rcmus niloticus; Arab. wamn), both of which have been already mentioned
(pp. 80, 81). Other species occurring in Egypt are the Ablephat'tts, the Gow.
yyltts, the Plestiodon, the Etrprepes, the Scincus (Arab. salcmilczb'), the
flphiops, the Eremias und Acanthodnctylus (Aral). se/tlit/eh), the Psa'mmo-
sam'us griseus (Arab. waran, a name, also applied to the monitor), the
Uromastim spinipes (Arab. (lab), the ITromustix vir'idis, the'S'teuio vulgaris
(Arab. J.tavtltha)., several kinds of Agama, the Chameleon (Arab. Jjerl) dyeh),
and numerous Ascalaboles (Arab. alia burir0. To the Turtle Family belong
the Nile Turtle (Trt'onyx aegyptiaca: Arab. tirsa) and a small Tortoise
(Testudo margiriata; Arab. zellztifeh), while in the Red Sea oeeur six
varieties of Chelonia (Arab. Luisa or gati'ar), several of which yield excellent
tortoise-shell (Arab. bagha).

v. FISH OF THE NILE (by DP. C. B. A% sneingevj, The tinny inhabi.
tants of the Nile are in keeping with the palms growing on its banks,
being of a tropical and African type. They are generally the same as
those found in the Senegal and other African rivers, while European
Species are very rare. There are in all about 70-80 varieties. The fol-
lowing sketch is merely designed to atTord an idea of the commonest
species, particularly of those brought to market. Many of them are re-
presented and described in the'Description de I'Egypte' (p. 200).

The fish of the Nile are most abundant during the time of the in-
undation. when a number of varieties, not found at other seasons, are
brought down from the higher regions to Lower Egypt. At these seasons
the canals yield abundant spoil, especially after the subsidence of the
water. The flesh is generally soft, watery, and insipid, but the mode of
cooking it is perhaps partly in fault. The colours are wanting in var-
iety, white with a dark-coloured back predominating.

To the Perch Family (scaly fish with serrated head-bones) belongs the
Keshr, and to the Carp Family (sealy f1sh without teeth) belong the Lebis,
or Delis, and the Bintti, with a thorn in its dorsal lin. The various kinds
of'S'iluridae are very abundant (fish without scales. with barbels, and
generally with an adipose fin). Among these are the Sltiliseh fa fish with
a high neck, a short dorsal [ in near the head, and without the adipose
fiu), which is of three kinds, the sizilbeh'ttrabi, the sizilbeh sherifiyeh, and
the slailbeh wudni (the first two with. the last without a spinous ray in
its dorsal fin). The Shel, called kurkdr in Upper Egypt owing to the
sound which they emit, is easily recognised by the bony armour cover-
ing, its head and its fringed barbels. The varieties are the shdl beledi,
the shdl senin or sheiltm, and the shit { rmnari or bag Â» sdda, the last of
