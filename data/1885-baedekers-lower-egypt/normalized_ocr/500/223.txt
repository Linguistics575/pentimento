p. 314. The Arabian historians are mere chroniclers, who narrate
, series of facts and traditions, and are entirely deficient in method
and the faculty of criticism. The following are the most important
writers 011 the general history of Egypt: - EI-M/ull (il. 05ir),
of Fostht; flirt et-Athh' (d. 12301), of Mossml in Syria; Ilm Khatdpn

sophical historian, and chietly famous for the preface to his history,
which was printed at L'itlils, in four volumes, in 18138; Ahul/hh" t
(d. 1331), prince of 1Jarna in Syria. The following are authors of
important works on limited epochs of Egyptian history and of
