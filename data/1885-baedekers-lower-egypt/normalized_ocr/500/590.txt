520 Route 10. WADI ESH-SHEKH. From Sinai

as far as the Jebel Bm'ghir (4-5 hrs.). This mountain, which is said to
be known to the Arabs as the Jebel en-Nth. ('Nouniain of Light'), has beten
recently supposed by Dr. Beke to be the Mt. Sinai of Scripture, on he
grounds that the Arabs regard it as sacred, and say that Noses once
cunversed here With the Lord; that saerifiees were Once offered on its
summit; and that stones in an upright position, and Sinaitie inserip-
tions, have been found here.

FROM.'A5ABA TO PETRA. The'Alawin Arabs at'Alcaba are very
exorbitant in their demands, often rude in their manners, and rarely
trustworthy. At times the route through their territory to the ancient
Rock City is not unattended with danger, and careful enquiry on the
subject should be made at Cairo and Suez before starting. An experienc-
ed dragoman, and one who is acquainted with the Shékhs, will be found
very useful. From'Al.caba to Petra, by the direct route, is a journey of
3 days, but via Nakhlek 4-5 days. From Petra to Hebron, 5-0 days, if
nothing untoward occurs. Attractive as Petra itself is, this route to it
is not more interesting than those leading to Sinai, and the traveller can
hardly be recommended to enter Palestine from this direction. A descrip-
tion of Petra, and of the journey to Jerusalem, will be found in Baedeger's
Palestine and Syria.

Return Route from the Monastery of Sinai to Suez hy the \Vadi esh-
Shékh, and via Sarhilt el-Khadem (comp. p. 475, and Maps pp. 496, 470).

On starting from the monastery, we first turn to the N.W. in the
Widi ed-D & (p. 502), leave the plain of EI-Raha (p. 513 ] to the left,
and turn to the NE. into the W & li esh-Shékh, Which is joined by
the Wai es-Sadad (p. 518) on the s., 1 hr. farther on. On the
right rises the Jebet ed-Dér, or'Mountain of the Monastery' (p. 502),
and on the left the Jebet Sana (p. 513), both of Which are barren and
precipitous. On the left, farther on, is the Jebet AChisarn'lyelu The
broad Widi esh-Shékh, Which is inhabited at places, extends in a
large semicircle of about'15 hours' journey from the Jebel Mt1sa
towards the N.W. down to the l'adi Firan (p. 500), presenting on
the whole but little attraction. After 11/4 hr. more we observe the
Tomb of the & vilkh sang: (Nebi: Scilift), which is highly revered by
the Beduins, and from Which the valley derives its name. Like all
these weli's (p. 18-1), the monument is an insignificant cubical
building, whitewashed, and covered with a dome, and contains an
empty sarcophagus. The interior contains votive offerings, such as
tassels, shawls, ostriehes' eggs, camels'-ha1ters, and bridles. The
Tawzira Beduins regard Shékh Salih as their ancestor; he was pro-
bably, however, an early Mohammedan prophet celebrated for his
eloquence, whois extolledinthe Koran as one of the most venerable
of the patriarchs. He is said to have called forth a living camel
out of the rocks, and to have destroyed by an earthquake some of the
proud Thamudites, to whom he had been sent, for their unbelief
and for their wickedness in mutilating the knees of the sacred
came ]. Every May a great festival takes place here, accompanied
with saerifices, feasting, and games, at which women also are
present, and a smaller festival takes place after the date harvest.
At the close of the proceedings the children of the desert ascend
(he Jebel Masa, and there offer saerifiees to Moses tp. 512).
