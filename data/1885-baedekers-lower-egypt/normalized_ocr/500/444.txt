leads to the right, in a direction parallel with the main corridor,
but now built up, as it was in a dangerous condition. A little
beyond this point we reach the E. end of the main gallery (P1. B).
Iletraeing our steps for a short distance, we turn to the right, pass
over another sareophagus which
blocks the way by means of steps,
and thus regain the door by which
we entered the vaults. The tem-
perature in these subterranean
chambers, to which the outer air
has little or 110 access, is always
about 79°, that being the mean
temperature of Cairo.

extraordinary place, we may quote

ishinent that the feeling is still fresh
in my mind, although five years have

'j5'j'iiit'e, elapsed since then. Owing to some

for, a chamber Which had been wall-

reign of Ramses II. had escaped the
notice of the plunderers of the vaults,
and I was so fortunate as to find it
1antouehed. Although 3700 years had
elapsed since it was closed, everything
in the chamber seemed to be precisely
in its original condition. The finger-
marks of the Egyptian who had trr.
serted the last stone in the wall built
to conceal the doorway were still re-
cognisable on the lime. There were
also the marks of naked feet imprint-
ed on the sand which lay in one cor-
ner of the tomh-chamber. Everything
was in its original condition in this
tomb, where the embalmed remains
of the bull had lain undisturbed for
thirty-seven centuries. Many trav-
ellers would think it terrible to live
here alone in the desert for a number
of years; but Such discoveries as that of the chamber of Ramses II. pro-
duce impressions compared with which everything else sinks into in-
srgnif'oearui, and which one constantly desires to renew'.

The "Magtaba of Ti (260 paces to the N.E. of Mariette's
house; see Map, p. 378) is the most interesting and best preserved
monument of this kind (comp. p. 379) in the extensive Neeropolis
of the ancient capital of the primmval monarchy. It lies in an old
street of tombs, now covered up; and the surface of the soil has
