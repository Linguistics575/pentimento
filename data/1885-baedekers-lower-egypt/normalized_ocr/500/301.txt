mushaf of Safa'yrr, mother of Sultan M1hammed Khan, who caused fifty-
two copies to be written by Mohammed ibn Ahmed el-h'halil et- Tebriii.
It dates from Ws, and measures Ill by 91/3 inches. In it, as in one ofthe
other copies a black line alternates with a gilded one, and the first few
pages are very beautifully executed. A copy of HusEn-Bey Jrhemasht2vyi,
211/2 by 163/1; inches, is written in a smaller character

The library also boasts of many other valuable lioritns, chiefly written
in the Persian character. One of these, 171/2 by 12 inches, presented by
an Indian 1.1ok1ndiir to the Khedive, has a Persian commeutmy written in red
between the lines of the text, andi IS beautifully illuminated at the beginning
and at the end.Anothes, copy. presented by a prince of Bukhtra, contains
four commentaries. two in Arabic by Bedawi and Gelal√©n and two in Per-
sian. Another gift' of the same donor was the prayer- -book'Daldil el-
Jrhaivtit', written on a golden gro11niLand furnished with a Persian tram: -
lation. There is also a Koran about 9 inches only in length, illuminated
with gilded flowers, and dating from the year 1100 of the Hegira. It was
written by fiiiGii'r'nii Huh Allah and contains the thirty diiferent parts
of the Koran on thirty pages. Each line begins with an atif, the first
letter of the Arabic alphabet - a most laborious performance. Another
Iioriin, once the property of the Sul.iiin Elga Etgusfi, measuring 201,1 by
1" 6 inches1 is written in two different haudwiritingi, the larger being named
Thuluihi, and the smaller Neshi. The highest efforts of Arabian calligraphy
and illumination are also displayed in several) Ioghrehin 3rSS., and in a
numher of single leaves bearing texts from the Foriin or sayings of the
prophet.

The ancient Muslims bestowed the utmost care on these precious
copies of the Koran, and their descendants still entertain profound
veneration for the sacred volume sent from heaven. The library possesses
many other ancient and valuable MSS., but they are all entirely eclipsed
by these Masahif They possess, however, great interest for the Arabic
scholar, to whom they are willingly exhibited, and form the first collec-
tion of the kind in the world. The library is especially rich in numerous
commentaries on the Koran and books containing traditions of the prophet,
as well as works on the law of the four Muslim sects, particularly the
1Janefites and Shiiferites. The library likewise contains a number of his-
torical, grammatical, and astrological works, some of which are very
ancient, not a few being in the handwriting of their authors. Among
the poetical NSS. the most important is that of Nutanebbi, dating from
553 of the Hegira, with a commentary by Ibn Ginni, w he also wrote a
commentary on the [ lamasm A o1s., intithed'Poems of the Arabs'. dates
from the same year, "and among the MS'S. of the Hamasa is a) Ioghrebin or
Algerian work, written from the recitation of the best- informed persons',
and. dating from 597. There is also an old MS. of the commentary of
Dlerzillri upon the collection of poems made by him. The fine 11S. of
Firdnsi, embellished with many coloured illustrations, was presented by
the Shah of Persia. The above enunseration will convey some idea of the
valuable contents of the library, of which at present there is only an Arabic
index, though a French catalogue is now in course of preparation. The
printed books are less numerous than the MSS., and they are chiefly from
the Bitliil.c press. Some of the surplus copies derived from that source
have been sold by the library.

After visiting the library the traveller may inspect the neigh-
bouring Dervish Monastery in the Habbaniyeh (PI. ll; permission
must be procured from the minister of public worship). The mon-
astery was erected in 1174 of the Hegira by Mustafa Agha, vizier
of Sulthn Selim. The round sehil is the most interesting object
in the establishment. The building possesses a large court; raised
considerably above the street, and containing a few trees. Around
the court are the cells of the dervishes, and adjoining it is a small

mosque. With regard to the dervishes, see p. 150.
