TI V PREFACE.

Bfalmntrl Bey, Linant, Lopsz'us, and Kiepcrt, together with
tl e English and French Admiralty charts, and the map of the
1j'kedud' expedition, so far as still serviceable; while numerous
corrections and additions have been specially made on the
spot. The plans of the mosques and the sketch of the Tombs
of the Khalifs have been contributed by Fran: Bey, the
architect. It is therefore hoped that the maps and plans will,
on the Whole, be found the most serviceable that have yet
been published for the use of travellers in Egypt.

HEIGHTS above the sea-level and other measurements are
given in English feet, from the latest and most trustworthy
English and other sources.

The PRICES and various items of expenditure mentioned
in the Handbook are given in accordance with the Editor's
personal experience, but they are liable to very great fluctt1-
ation, in accordance with the state oftrnde) the influx of
foreigners, the traveller's own demeanonr, and other circum-
stances. In some cases the travcller's expenditure may he
within the rate indicated in the Handbook, but as many 1111-
expeeted contingencies may arise on so long ajoumey, an
ample pecuniary margin should always be allowed.

HOTELS, ete., see p. 17.

TRANSLITERATION. The vowel sounds of Arabic words
mentioned in the Handbook are represented by a, e, i, a, and u,
as pronounced in Italian (ah, eh, ee, 0, and oo). The tr, used
in the Handbook is a contracted form of ei, and is used in
preference to it, as it exactly represents the usual prontu1eia-
tion (riz. that of the ft in fate). The diphthong sound of ei is
rarely used except in the recitation of the Koran. Arabic
words written in accordance with this system will generally
be found to correspond with the forms used by German,
French, and Italian philologists.
