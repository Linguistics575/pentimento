UILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS. 185














































ed in two leading groups: (r) those of rectangular plan, with
ypttethrttl columns or pilasters round the open court (see plan of the
mosques of (Amr, p. 3'Yi, and Jlarly1li, p. 28'Y); and (2) those
which have a rectangular or cruciform court surrounded hy closed
rooms, like the mosque of Sultan [ lawn and most of the tomb
mosques, or those where the tomh is of largo size coulpared with the
Sahn er-0tmn".

The Tomns of the Muslims (comp. also p. 155) are generally
situated on high ground, 1tninflueneed by the moisture ofthe river,
and sometimes in the desert. The chambers are destitute of decora-
tion. Within is a catafalque of stone resting on a more or less deco-
rated pedestal, and bearing two upright columns (Shc'thid) of marble
or other stone, one of which, placed immediately over the head of
the deceased, bears his name and age, with texts from the Koran. At
the top of the shihiil is represented the turban of the deceased, the
form of which indicates his rank, Over the catafalques of persons
of distinction are erected dome-shaped canopies, resting on four
columns or pilasters, or their tombs have the closed form of those
of the sh√©khs already mentioned. On festivals the catafalques
and hollow parts of the pedestals are covered with palm-branches,
flowers, and basilieum. On these occasions the friends, and espeei-
ally the female relatives, of the deceased often spend whole days
by the tomb, engaged in prayer and ahr1sgiving. For these mour-
ners it was necessary to provide acoommodation, and the result is
that a complete mausoleum, with its rooms for the family, sebil,
school, stables, eustodian's residence, etc., is often nearly as ex-
tensive as the m0s (l11eS themselves, while some 0fthen1 are so large
as almost to present the appearance of a small deserted town. To
buildings of this kind the name ofl.% sh is applied. One of the most
imposing of these is the tomb-mosque of Sultan Barlirl?.

The Dwelling-Houses, which rarely have more than two
stories, are built in very various styles, but the following rules are
generally observed in their construction: - (1) The principal
rooms, particularly those of the Harem (p. 187), look into the court
or garden, if there be one. ('2) The windows looking to the street
are small, placed very high, and strongly barred, while those
of the upper floors are closed with mushrebiyeh (p. 181), which,
however, are gradually being superseded by glass-windows with
shutters. (3) The entrance-door LP ]. I, 1), behind which is the
seat (Jlastaba, Pl. I, 2) of the doorkeeper, is generally low and
narrow, and the passage (P1. I, 3) leading from the street to the
court is built in the form of an angle, to prevent people from seeing
into the court. CI) The court (Hash, P1. I, j) is planted with trees and
unpaved, and contains a well of water that has filtered through from
the Nile. This water, however, is generally more or less brackish,
and is used only for washing purposes and for the cattle. (P) 15y
the entrance to the court, and on the same level, is the Jlrzntlura
