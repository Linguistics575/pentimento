tian art appears to have been seriously checked in its growth, and
tn have entered, after a brief period of effloreseenee, on a long era
of what may be termed Byzantinism, - and yet in many respects
the Iigyptian sculptures merit our highest admiration. The artistic
ttfiiwt.s capable of heing produced in any given material, such as
granite, were. always calculated with the nicest discrimination;
nothing, capable of achievement is left undone, and beyond this
nothing is attempted. The sculptors are notable for their knowledge
of anatomy, for their acenravy in the delineation of muscle, for
their skill in portraiture, and for their fidelity in representing
animal life. Of all the Egyptian works the figures of the gods are
perhaps the least happy. To us they seem to exhibit a want of taste,
an 1 intelligence; but this is perhaps to be accounted for by the fact
that they were intended to be worshipped only, and not admired.
That the prantiee of art was very highly developed in Egypt is proved
u it merely by the great extent to which the division of labour was
harried, but by the, fact that the artists understood the process of
vnpying figurrs hy dividing them into squares and calculating their
prnportions so as to he able to reduce or enlarge them at pleasure.
Ss all authorities, however, concur in pronouncing the Egyptian
artists prri'Ct't in point of technical skill, it would be superfluous
in say mnre on this branch of the subject.
