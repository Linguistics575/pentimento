360 Route J. THE PYRAMIDS OF GIZEH. Environs

Pyramid. This chamber is hewn in the rock, and roofed with painted
slabs of limestone leaning against each other at the same angle as that
formed by the sides of the Pyramid. It is 221/eft. in height, 45%: ft. in
length front E. to w., and 161/3 ft. in width from N. to S. Belzoui here
fond a granite sarcophagus let into the ground and filled with rubbish,
3 ft. in height, G ft. 7in. in length, and 31/2 ft. in width, and destitute of
inscription. The lid was broken. The lower passage, entered from the
pavement en the N. side of the Pyramid, descends at first at an angle of
21째 40', reaches a trap-door, runs in a horizontal direction for 59 ft., and
then ascends, terminating, after a distance of 97ft. in all, in the hori,
znntal corridor leading to Belzoni's Chamber. tln the E. side of the
middle of the horizontal portion of this lower passage was introduced a
small chamber; and, connected with it on the W. side by means of a de-
scending passage, 22 ft. in length, was another chamber hewn in the rock,
8ft. bin. in height, 31ft. 3 in. in length, and 10 ft, tin. in width. The
perpendicular height of this Pyramid is now 450 ft. (formerly 458 ft.),
each side of the base measures (5941/2 ft. (originally 7113/; ft.), and the
height of each sloping side is 5663/4 ft. (originally 5753/4 ft.), while the
sides rise at an angle of 52째 2 (Y. The solid content of the masonry is
new 2,156,960 cubic yds., equivalent to /t,8R3.000 tons in weight (origin-
ally 2,496,710 cub. yds., equivalent to 5,300,000 tons).

The Third Pyramid, named by the Egyptians (i) her,

< 2: -

or'the upper', was erected by Menkaura, the Mykerinos of Hero-
dotus. The rock on which it stands has a shelving surface, and
the necessary horizontal site was formed by building up a ped-
estal of enormous blocks, instead of by removing a portion of the
rock. The stones of which the Pyramid is constructed are remark-
ably large and well hewn. The lower part of it is covered with
slabs ofpo1ished granite, and the upper part with rough stones. The
inerustation and the material which once filled the angles of the
exterior are now so damaged that the tiers of the internal nucleus
are almost everywhere visible. On the E. side are relies of a temple
(comp. p. 358). With regard to the constructi0n of the Third Py-
ramid and the attempts which have been made to destroy it, see
pp. 3-16, 347, 353.

The Interior of the Third Pyramid is in many respects particularly
interesting, and the access to it was formerly easier than that to the
Pyramid of Cheops, hut the indolent Boduins have unfortunately allowed
it tn become choked with sand. The entrance is en the N, side, 13ft.
above the ground. A passage ac descends at an angle of 26째 2' to a dis-
tance of 1011/2 ft., being lined with granite where it passes through the
masonry from ft to li, and then penetrating the solid rock from b to c.
From c a slightly descending passage cd leads to a white-washed ante-
ehumherf, ft. in height, 12 ft, in length, and 10ft. in width, and,
beyunr ] this chamber, passes three tmap-doors g, which were intended tn
arrest the progress of intruders. The passage hd then becomes nearly
horizontal (gradient 4째) fur a distance of 411/2 ft., and fmally descends lo
the chamber e, which is 1141/2 ft. long, 121/: ft. broad, and owing to the
unevenness of the rock from which the pavement has been removed,
varim from 13 ft. to 13 ft. Sin. in height. The remains of asarcophagus
let into the ground were found here, but not that of Menkaura, which
was carefully ensconced in a still lower tomb-ehamber..

The pavement of the chamber e covers the mouth of a shaft 29 ft. in
h', ngilt, which was closed by a trap-door, and is flanked with a prnjeet-
ing, block of granite ml each side, 11ft. wide and 2 ft. tin. high, de.,
