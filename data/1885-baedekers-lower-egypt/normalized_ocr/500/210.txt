X. The Arabic Language.

Arabic belongs to the Semitic group of languages, and has no
relationship with the tengnes of l'lnrope. A knowledge of Hebrew,
however, will materially facilitate the learning of Arabic. The
guldun era ofArabie literature is coeval with the introduction of
F.l-lslim, and the Koran in the dialect of the Jiureish (the
family of MuhannnM) is still regarded as an unrivalled model of
style, and language. As Ill-Islam spread from its narrow home over
the vast territories that gradually acknowledged the Crescent, Arabic
lost many of its older and fuller forms and was greatly simpliiled
for daily use. In this way arose the vulgar dialects of Ambit, of
which that spoken in Egypt is one. In writing, however, an at-
tempt was made to retain the older forms, and the written lan-
guage of the presrmt day, known as Middle Arabic, occupies a po-
ritirm midway hetween the original classical tongue and the popular
tialetts. Egypt was conquered by the Arabs in the 19th year of
Thu llegira (640 A.Df) and the Coptic language was replaced by
Arabic. The dialect of the latter developed in the valley of the
Nile s1iiTcrs considerably in the pronunciation of the c, onsonants',

oealisation, and aceent from the ordinary Arabic dialects of Syria
: md elsewhere. Thus the letter a is pronounced hard in Egypt and
oft in Syria (see p. 10IY), The variations, however, are not so great
as to prevent the Syrians and Egyptians being mutually intelligible.

A sharply defined and exact pronunciation of the consonants is
charaeto.ristie of Arabic and is absolutely essential to any satisiae-
tury use of the language. The learner should endeavour at once to
master the pronunciation of the more tlifileult Arabic consonants.
