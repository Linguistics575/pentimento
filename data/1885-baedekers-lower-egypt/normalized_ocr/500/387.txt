of Cairo. THE PY tAMlDS OF Gizen. d. Route. 341

who do not (are to ride the whole way send donkeys to Grizeh on the
Jay before they start, drive thither ea11y in the morning and dismiss
the carriage there (the fare being hardly less than for the journey there
and back), and ride in the afternoon or evening along the outskirts of
the desert to Sakkara, where the night' IS spent. 0511 the following morning
the route leads by the site of the Dancient Memphis and through palm
groves to the railway- -st: ttion of P, eilrashén. Railway thence to Bulak
.t.sd-qakr.i'sr, the station for Cairu, together with fares and the time occupied
by the journey see p.

A visit to Helwftn (p. 403) may also be combined with the last-
mentioned excursion if the traveller crosses the river with his donkey
near Bedrashen, and passes the night in the hotel at0elwiin.Cairo may
thenoge regained on the third day on donkey -baek,' or by the railway
(p 4 J

Travellers who do not fear a little extra exertion and who are satis-
fied with a rapid inspection of the pyramids may visit G1zeh and Sakkara
in one day by obeerving the following directions. Leaving Cairo at S a, m. "
we drive to Bedrashen and ride thence to Sakkara (p. 371), quitting the
latter at 2 p. m. we next ride along the edge of the desert to the py ramitls,
which we reach about 11/2 hr. before dusk. The drive back from the
pyramids, where a carriage should be 01dered to meet us, is most agree-
able when a moonlight night has. been chosen for the excursion.

One of the fineD and bcalm days of which there is no lack at Cairo
should be selected for: the excursion, the driving sand in windy weather
being very unpleasant.

Near Kagr en-Nil we cross the Nile by the great iron bridge
o. 308). 011 the opposite bank we leave F, riSlii' (p. 328j,
which an avenue leads, on the right. The greenhouses and i, ae.
deners' dwellings belonging to the.3 Khedive also lie on the right.
To the left of the road leading across the island we observe the
lofty chimney of a water-pump, and the private gaS-manufaetory
of the Khedive. A second and smaller bridge then crosses the
other branch of the Nile, which was long choked with mud, but
which has lately been are-opened, so that the name of Gezireh
(i. e. island) is now justifiable (comp. p. 329). Immediately
beyond the bridge rises a Karahol (Turk.'guard-house'), the road
passing which leads to the railway station of B13151; ed-Dakrih
o. 371) and to a palace of Tustin Pasha. The road to Gizeh, which
is well kept and is shaded by beautiful iebbek trees, diverges to
the left by the second bridge. Near the entrance to the vieeroya ]
gardens of Gizeh, which are bounded on the S. by an extensive pal-
ace, are waterworks for the raising and distribution of the water,
immediately beyond which the road turns to the right. 011 the left
rises the high wall enclosing the property of the Khedive, and on
the right are palaces of the princes Husén and JJasan Pasha (none
of which are shown to visitors). After crossing the Upperfgyptian
railway, the road leads between the railway ton the left) and the
canal (on the right) towards the S. to the private station of the
Khedive, and thence to the right, direct towards the Pyramids.
Or we may follow the better road along the Nile, keeping the wall
of the palace to 0111' right. The now decayed village of Gizeh
[ which was a railway-station until recently, but has ceased to be
so since the opening of the Bt1lstlr ed-Dalcrttr station), which we
