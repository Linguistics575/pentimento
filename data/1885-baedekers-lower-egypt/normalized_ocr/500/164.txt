earth was then formed. In order to keep the earth steady, G
caused it to be supported by an angel, placed on a huge rock, Which
in its turn rests on the back and horns of the bull of the world.
And thus the earth is kept in its proper position.

himultaneous with the creation of the firmament was that of the
(min (demons), beings occupying a middle rank between men
and angels, some of them believing, others unbelieving. These
giim are frequently mentioned in the Koran, and at a later period
numerous fahles regarding them were invented. To this day the
belief in themisvery general. When the ginu became arrogant, an
angel was ordered to banish them, and he accordingly drove them
to the mountains of I (zif by which the earth is surrounded, whence
they occasionally make incursions. Adam was then created, on the
evening of the sixth day, and the Muslims 011 that account observe
Friday as their Sabbath. After the creation of Adam came the fall
of the angel who conquered the ginu. As he refused to bow down
before Adam he was exiled, and theneeforward called Ibtis, or the
desil. After this, Adam himself fell, and became a solitary wan-
derer, but was afterwards re-united to Eve at Mecca, where the
sacred stone in the Iiarba derives its hlaek colour from Adam's tears.
At Jidda, the harbour of Mecca, the tomb of Eve is pointed out to
this Jay. Adam is regarded as the first orthodox Muslim; for God,
from the earliest period, provided. for a revelation.

lesides the creative activity of God, his maintaining power is
specially emphasised, as being constantly employed for the preser-
vation of the world. His instruments for this purpose are the
angels. They are the bearers of God's throne, and execute. his
commands. They also act as mediators between God and men,
lu-ing the constant attendants of the latter. When a M uslilu prays
{ whivh he does after the supposed fashion of the angels in heaven'),
it will be observed that he turnshis face at the conclusion first over
his right and then over his left shoulder. He thereby greets the
recording angels who stand on each side of every believer, one on
the right to record his good, and One 011 the left to record his evil
deeds. The traveller will also observe the two stones placed over
every gravein aMnslim hurial-gronud. 13y these sit the two angels
who examine the deceased, and in order that the creed may not
eseape his memory it is incessantly chanted by the conductor of
the funeral.

While there are legions of good angels, who differ in form, but
are purely ethereal in substance, there are also innumerable sa-
telliti's of Satan, who seduce men to error and teach them sorcery.
'l'luy endeavour to pry into the secrets of heaven, to prevent which
they are peltod with falling stars by the good angels. (This last is
a notion of very great antiquity.)
