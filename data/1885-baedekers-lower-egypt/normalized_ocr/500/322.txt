The university is attended by about 7700 students in all, who are
taught hy 231 shékhs or professors.
The iliCerent sects are distributed as follows:
Shitferites... 3723, with 106 shékhs.
Maiekites... 2855, with 75 shékhs.
Haneiltes... 1090, with 49 shekhs.
1.tarnbarltes... 23, with 1 shékh.
The students CUttgtitoivin) usually remain three, and sometimes
from four tn six years in the mosque. They pay no fees, but each riwah
is supported by an annual subsidy from the endowments of the mosque,
although these were much diminished by Mohmnmed.'Ali., who ap-
propriated the revenues of most of the religious foun.daiions 1n Egypt to
government purposes. The shekhs, 0r professors, receive no salary, either
from the moatlue or from government, but support themselve? .by teaching
in private houses, by copying hooks, or by filling some rehgwus o, .fflce
to which a salary is attached, and they occasionally rece1ve donations
from the wealthier students. When teaching, the shekh sits cross-legged
nn a straw-mat and reads from a book placed on a desk (rahleh) before
him, explaining each sentence as he proceeds; or be directs n-ne of the
more advanced students to read aloud, adding his own explanatiens ft-nm
time to time. The students sit in a circle around the teacher, listening,
or attentively taking notes. As soon as a student kumys bx heart the
whole of the book which is being studied hy the class, the shekh mahes
an entry in his copy of the work, called the Igdzelz, whereby authority
to lecture on the book is conferred on the student himself. The prestdent
of the university, who is usually the most distinguished of the shchhs,
is called Shim cl-Azhar, and receives a salary of about 20 purses, 1. e.
10,000 pinstres. "
