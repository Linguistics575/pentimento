flue old styytd trees. Near the head of the valley are several'Naws1mts'
[ stone huts; see p. 501), Sinaitie inscriptions, and large fragments
of a rude granite wall. The latter is said to have been erected hy the
Tttwha Beduius, in order to arrest the progress of troops sent by
Mohammed'Ali to punish them for pillaging a caravan i but it ap-
pears to be of earlier date. It extends along both slopes of the val-
ley, but there is a wide opening where the route passes through it.

On the right opens the Wihii Mesakkar, and on the left, lower
down, the Wthli Tayyibeh, at the base of the lofty DabbtusHWi.
In 21/4 hrs. more the Whdi Barak reaches the Wadi Silt, which
after 3/4 hr. turns sharply to the left, leading to the Witdi Sidr,
while the Wddi el-3ferayi) on the right leads to the Debbet er-
Ramlch. Our route runs to the N.W., gradually asee11ding, and
and in 1/2 hr. reaches a narrow sandy plain called the Deb√©bet Shah
Ahmed, from the tomb of a Beduin chief of that name to the right
of the path. We then descend into the Wihli Klmmfteh, in which
we again ascend to (p, hrs.) the lids fhhvik (2-175 ft.) On the left
is the picturesque Jebel Ghurtlbi, a curiously eroded mass of sand-
stone, with several Sinaitic inscriptions. An extensive view is
obtained over the Tth hills and the plain of Ramleh.

We descend from the pass by a steep zigzag path into the Wtali
Stcroik, in which after 11/2 hr. we reach the mouth of the small
Wtdi Merattameh, situated at the foot of the hills called fiarbt1.t
el-Khedem.

On the neighbouring hill, 600 ft. in height, are situated a
number of interesting monuments, dating from the period of the
Pharaohs, and re-discovered by Niebuhr in 1762. The ascent from
the Whdi Merattameh, which is somewhat fatiguing, and requires
a steady head, occupies fully an hour. On the level plateau
on the top are numerous monuments with hieroglyphic inserip-
tions. There are traces of an old enclosing wall, 57 yds. long, and
23 yds. broad, surrounded by sixteen ancient Egyptian upright
monuments Cl. Similar stones bearing inscriptions are lying on
the ground, and there are the ruins of a small temple. The Salle-
tuary and a pronaos of this edifice were hewn in the rocks in the
reign of Amenemha III. (.12th Dyu.), and furnished with hand-
somely painted inscriptions (whirl, however, are nearly obliterated),
and niches for images. In the reign of Thothmes 111. (18th 1) yn.)
the temple was extended towards the W. by the erection of a pylon
and anterior court, and several rooms on the, W. side were after-
wards added by other kings. The dimensions of the whole building
are comparatively small. As in the, Wiidi Maghhra (p. 491), the
goddess Ifathor, and particularly the llathor of Mafkat (p. 492),
was principally worshipped here. The inscriptions indicate that
this spot, instead of being a hurial-plaeo, with its tombstones, as
one would at first have supposed, was a religious edifice with a
number of chambers for various purposes.
