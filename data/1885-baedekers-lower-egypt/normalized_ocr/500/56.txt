34 GEOGRAPHICAL NOTICE. Administration.

Lower and Upper Errypt (the latter known as Sa'itl') are now
each divided into seven I'novrscris or Murli'riyeh. Those of Upper
Egypt are: fr) fialyO, at the head of the Delta; ('2 Slutryveh,
i.e.'the eastern', with Zalsizty as its capital; (3) Dulmhliyeh,
with Nansyira as its capital; (A) Jfen0fi (if) Ciltarliyelt, Le.
'the western', with Tanta as its capital; (fr) Bch√©reh, Le.'of
the lake', with Damanhtr as its capital; (7) Giseh, opposite to
Cairo. Tho seven Upper Egyptian provinces are those of Beni-Suf-f,
Minyeh, h'yitst, Girgeh, Hench, Esneh, and Wtuli Haifa. The seat
of the mudir or governor of Girgeh has recently been transferred
to the not far distant s5tihitg,. The Faytim forms a mudiriyeh by
itself. The following capitals and commercial towns are presided
ever by governors of their own, and are independent of the
provincial administration: Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, Port Sa'id,
Damietta, Rosetta, lsma'iliya, andlastly the small seaport of 1ios.s/r
on the Red Sea.

The administration of the Upper Egyptian provinces, and still
more those of the Hl'uh'm, is liable to frequent change, several of
them being sometimes united under a governor-general, and at
other times again disjoined, or managed by a commission appointed
by the minister of the interior. The recently acquired seaports on
the Red Sea have governors (mudtrs) of their own, and they in their
turn are under the supervision of a governor-general (hokmd/ir)
resident at Kassaln. These last districts are (or were) known as
the East Stodio, while the government of the West Stulin was cen-
tralised at kharttsm. Before the Outbreak of the revolution the West
F'u1din consisted 0ftheprovinees ofKhart.t1m, Sennttr, Bahr el-Abym ],
Kon1of'in, four of 1) ir-lnir, and the provinres of Bahr-el-Ghazal
and the Equator. The last two provinces include almost the whole
region of the Upper White Nile and are inhabited solely by negro
tribes. Khartim was the seat of a governor-general whose juris-
diction extended over the whole of the provinces beyond the limits
of Egypt in the narrower sense. Lastly, the Nubian part of the.
Valley of the Nile is divided into the provinces of Donhola and
lierher, which are administered independently of each other, the
capital of the former being E ] -'Ordeh, that of the latter Jtl-aMokht.trif
(or Berber).

The chief official in every province is the Mudh, or governor,
who is assisted by a council, or'diwitn', ofother offieers. This coun-
cil consists of a Wehil, or viee-govornor; a ehiefelerli, tas-gatherers
and accountant, who is always a Copt; a J.Gh.li, or supreme judge,
andthe chief authority in spiritual matters; sometimesthe president
ofa chamber of cmnmeree and chief authority in civil affairs; a
superintendent of police; an architect for the supervision of canals
and other public works; and lastly the chief physician of the pro-
vince. The sub-governurs in the smaller towns, who are under the
jurisdiction of the Mudir, are sometimes called dehif, or A/iiir
