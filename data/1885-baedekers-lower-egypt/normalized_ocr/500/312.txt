The lowest rate payable by small families fur filtered water is 8 fr. per
month. The whole length of the pipes for filtered water, the largest
of which are 2ft. in diameter, amounts to IO miles, and that of the pipes

to 5 million francs.

The very dusty road next leads to the unimportant tomb of

Shtkh Galat, a little beyond which we reach the so-trallied -

Which extend along the E. side of the city, and which, beyond the
Citadel, are known as Tombs of the Mamehikes (p. 327ji.

All these tombs, most (if which are of vast extent, were once richly
endowed, each being provided with a numerous staff of shtsktss end at-
tendants, who with their families resided within their precincts. At the
beginning of the present century the revenues of these establishments
were confiscated, so that the tombs are now falling tn ruin. The de-
scendants ef the mosque attendants and other Arabs have since taken up
their quarters among the ruins, and the old necrnpnlis has thus been
converted into a kind of suburb of Cairo, the inhahitattts of which often
pester strangers with their impurtunities.

A visit to the tombs is exceedingly interesting, particularly towards
sunset, owing to the very curious and novel picture they present. They
may be reached by carriage, but the traveller will be more independent
(in donkey-back. The necessary order of admission front the Walcf mi-
nistry may he obtained through the consulate (see p. 241).

POINTS OF VIEW. (1) From the road, approaching from the Iliib en-
Nasr, a little beyond the tomb of the sh√©kh; (2) From the S.W. corner
(see Plan), at the foot of the Citadel; (3) From the "\VINDMILL HILL
opposite the end of the Rue Neuve, the E, prolongation of the Muski.
This last point is specially recommended as it also atl'erds an admirable
survey of the town, the Nile, and the Pyramids, and is very easily
reached. llalf-an-hour ofleigure before sunset can hardly be better spent
than on this hill (p. 287), but the beggars are often troublesome.

The N.E. group of these mausoleums (en the left when ap-
proached from P, ib en-Nasir) consists of the Tomb ofSul.Mn Abu
Sa'id Jiran: suweh el-0iiri (p. 274), a cube surmounted by an
elongated dome, and two tomb-mosques, one of Std.Mn el-Ashruf,
with ahandsome minaret, the other of Emir Ttstt/', son of ltursbcy
(see p. 285). These two mosques, which present no attraction, are
now used for military purposes, and are not shown without special
permission from the minister of war. As visitors are prevented by
the sentry from approaching them, we leave them to the left, and
proceed in a straight direction to the -
