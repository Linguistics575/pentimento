ing Syria and even Egypt itself, he was still treated by his emirs as a
youth under age, and the real rulers of the country were Seller, his
chancellor, and BÃ©hars H. Jashengir, the prefect of his palace, who had
originally been a Circassian slave. In 1309 N'its.sir returned to Kerak, for
the avowed purpose of undertaking a pilgrimage to Mecca, but on his
arrival there he announced his intention to throw "the trammels of
tutelage, and for a time to establish his residence at Kerak. The,
eor1sequenee was that he was declared at Cairo to have forfeited his
throne, and Behars 11. was proclaimed sultan in his stead (April, 1309).
The Syrian emirs, however, remained faithful to Nitsyr, and with their
aid he succeeded in re-establishing his authority in Egypt, although the
nominal rAhhasiile Khalif residing at Cairo had pronounced him an
outlaw and declared war against him. The three chief traits in Nasir's
character. distrust, vindictiveness, and eupidity, now became very
pruminent, and there was no promise or oath which he deemed inviolahle.
Ile treated his emirs with the utmost. capriciousness. presenting them
with rich gifts, or ordering them to be executed, as the humour seized
him; and this feature of his character has been aptly described by
an Arabian historian, who declares'that he fattened his emirs, and killed
them when thoroughly fattened, in order that all they had swallowed
might return to him.' 1sma'il Abul Fidil (p. 201), however, one of his
einirs, retained his master's favour till the time of his death, and even
had the title of sultan conferred upon him. Towards the mass of the
population, on the other hand, Ni1siir was always liberal and condescend-
ing; he abolished oppressive taxes, punished hoarders of grain, and
distributed corn in times of famine. He was tolerant towards the
Christians alsu, and was anxious to abrogate the regulations about dress
(p. 273) which certain fanatics had induced him to make in his earlier
years, but was unable to carry out his wish. He even appointed Christian
ofiicials, particularly in the eustom-heuse and finance departments. His
chief object was to surround himself with officers who could procure him
money, to defray the enormous expenses of his court, to gratify his taste
for horses (of which no fewer than 3000 are said to have been reared in
his stables annually), and his love of building. He connected Alexandria
anew with the Nile by means of a navigable canal, and constructed other
canals also, such as that from Khiinlyth to Siryiili0s, and embankments.
In spite of his tyranny, he therefore enjoyed a considerable share of
popularity, to which his stringent enforcement nf the religious laws and
his indulgence towards the clergy, so long as they did not interfere in
politics, farther contributed. On 0th Jan. 1311 Niieir died the. death of
a pious and penitent Muslim. As seen as the emirs perceived that his
end was near, they seized upon the whole of his property, so that after
his death not even a suitable pall to cover the corpse could be found.
His miserable funeral took place by night, attended by a few emirs only,
and lighted by a single lantern. Thus, according to his Arabian biographers,
terminated the reign of the powerful sultan whose dominions had extended
from the frontier of Ahyssinia tn Asia Minor, and from the Euphrates to
Tunis, but who, though wealthy and the father of twelve sons, died like
a stranger and a childless man. and was buried like a pauper.

The 1ate-llonlanisque portal, in marble, with its round
arch, is strikingly different from all other Arabian portals of the
kind. It was originally erected at Acre in Syria, after the de-
struetion of which it was transferred to Cairo in A.D. 1291 by the
Egyptian Mamehike Saltin El-Ashraf (p. 255 ] as a trophy of vie-
tory. The only object of interest in the interior is the well-
1leihted and beautifully moulded Arabian stueeo-work, remains of
which are preserved.
