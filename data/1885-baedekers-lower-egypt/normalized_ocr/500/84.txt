This barrier extends eastwards for about 180 miles, forming a very ir-
regular chain of barren hills 900-13UU ft. in height.

The Nile has forced a passage for itself through this hard rock, ex-
posing to view at places the beautiful red felspar crystals which it een-
Pains, and forms a wild cataract at Assuiin. Near the cataracts are the
deserted quarries of the ancient Egyptians, where to this day we still
observe a number of unfinished gigantic obelisks, and columns half hewn
out of the solid rock.

(12) THE ARABIAN DESERT. Parallel with the coast of the Red Sea, a
broad and massive range of mountains, consisting uf crystalline rocks
(granite, syenite, diurite, porphyry, hornblende slate. gneiss, miea-slate,
ute.), runs through the Arabian Desert, sending forth numerous ramiti-
cations into the interior of the country. At IJammitmiit, on the caravan-
route from lgos√©r to Thebes, we pass the quarries whence the dark-
eeloured stone (aphanite, diorite, and verde autieo) used for the ancient
sareophagi and sphinxes was obtained by the Egyptian sculptors. Near
the Red tiea, almost opposite the southern extremity of the peninsula of
Sinai, rises the Gebel Dukhiin, which yielded the beautiful red porphyry
(portido resse) so highly prized by the Greeks and Romans at a later
period, and used by them for vases, columns, sarcophagi, busts, and
mosaics. The granite quarries of the Gebel Fatireh yielded both building
stone and copper. Most celebrated of all, however, Were the emerald mines
of the Gebel Zebiira, situated on the Red Sea in the latitude of Selseleh.

This extensive range of mountains of crystalline formation, rising to
a. height of GGUUt't.., of which those of the peninsula of tSinai form a
counterpart, terminates towards the east in roof-shaped, stratified fur-
matiuns. At lirst. there occurs a eonsidcrable stratum of Nubian sandstone,
next to which we find a series of clayey and calcareous strata, identified
by Figari-Bey with the Triassic and Jura formations, probably errone-
ously, as the collection of specimens of the rock at lorenee shows that
apparently the chalk alone, is completely developed. These strata are
succeeded by extensive masses of limestone, belonging to the nummulite
formation, and stretching to the Nile. Among these last formations is
found the pale yellow, brownish, and snow-white alabaster, a kind of
limestone composed of nodulous masses, which was formerly quarried at
the ancient Alabasirum near Shit, and still occurs on the Gebel Urakam
near Beni-tiui'ef. In the reign of Mehammed'Ali this alabaster was largely
used in the construction of his alabaster mesmte (p. 203), and it was ex-
tensively exported in ancient times fur the embellishment of buildings
and for sculptural purposes. Blocks of it are even found among the
ruins of the Oasis uf Amman.

These extensive mountains, with their numerous profound ravines
and boldly shaped masses of ruck, impart a most imposing character to
the Arabian Desert. This region is by no means se destitute of vege-
tation as is usually supposed; for, although without oases, it contains,
particularly in the N. part, a number of springs and natural cisterns,
which are filled by the rtlre, but etten copious, rains of winter.

land, (OJ-lout) ft. above the level of the Nile, extending between the Nile
and the eases of Kluirgeh, Jriikhel, Farilfra, and Bahriyeh. Throughout
this vast area there occur neither mountains, nur valleys, nor even iso-
lated hills of any considerable height; and there is nu trace of crystal-
line er volcanic formations. The surface of the desert rises in gradations,
each preceded by a broad girdle of isolated mounds, which have been
nhviuusly formed by erosion, the umterials having been washed down
from the adjoining plateau. The whole of this stony and absolutely un-
watered plain, the monotony of which is only varied by u few solitary
ranges of sand-hills, consists of nummulite limestone. Jn the direction
of the 03.363 it descends in precipitous slopes, furrowed with numerous
ravines, and oeeasitmally nearly 1000 ft. in height. The different strata
of the earlier nummulite formation, as well as these of the upper chalk,
are here exposed to view, and generally contain numerous fossils. The I
