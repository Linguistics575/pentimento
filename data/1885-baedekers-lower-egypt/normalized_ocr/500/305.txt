Meanwhile [ Inset ] had conquered 1Jijiiz and Yemen, and added them to
the Egyptian dominions, on which occasion El-CH1Mi caused the whole
of the S. side of the I.ririim at Mecca, to be rebuilt (in ooo of the Hcgira),
as recorded there by an inscription under the Biib Ibrahim; but these
districts soon threw off his yoke and placed themselves under the suzeraiuty
of the 0smans, and, before his newly equipped fleet reached India, the
sultan himself died. On 21th Aug. 1516, while fighting against the army
of the Osman sultan Selim I. in the plain of Diibik (to the N. of Aleppo),
he is said to have fallen down in a fit of apoplexy, and to have been
slain by his own followers, either from motives of eupidity, or to
prevent his being captured by the enemy. His head was afterwards cut
off and carried as a. trophy to the victor.

from the Persian word bhnaristtui), the greater part of which is
now in a ruinous condition, and used as a workshop by copper-
smiths and tinkers. The tomb of the founder, however, which

throne ongypt in Nov. 1279. He gained a victory over a rebellious governor
of Damascus; he defeated the Blongolians, who were threatening Syria,
