the oasis of Fir√©n (p. 495), the W'iidi llIokatteb (p. MB) with its in-
scriptions, and the mines of W2di Nughara (p. 491), all of which are
points of much interest.

Camels are always to be had at Ttr, but as good saddles are rare,
the travellers draguman should take an ample supply of rugs from
Cairo; moreover iT is not so easy to make a satisfactory bargain at Th
as at Cairo, though Shekh Hennen (see above) will render every as-
sistance in his pow er. If the p'arty is numerous." if the traveller wishes
to provide against the possibility of delay, camels should he sent on from
Suez to'I.T1r, a journey of three days for unladeu animals, the cost of
which is not very great.

To the above directions may, lastly, be added a few hints for which
we are indebted to a traveller who is well acquainted with the Arabic
language, and is accustomed to associate with the Beduins: - Take
the railway from Cairo to Suez. Dispense With tents and beds; but
take at least a couple of warm rugs to fold over the saddle, and io
be used at night. A hammock will also Le found very serviceable, and
the camp may he pitched where the trees are, large enough to give it
support. Before leaving Cairo the traveller should lay in a stock of
preserved meats and wine, and buy a lamp and a few cooking utensils.
Pack these in palm-leaf baskets, which are well adapted fur the camels.
If necessary the stuck of provisions may be reinforced at Ttlr by fresh
bread, ll few fowls, lobsters, and fish, and some date paste. At Suez
iiiiiiiile. introductions to the monks of the Greek convent at Tur and
to Shekh f.rennen.Proeeeil from Suez to Tur by boat crr hy'steamer
(during the quarantine pe1'ind) .Slcep at Tdr in llenneu 3 house or in
the Greek cement. Hire a camel through I.lennen with a Beduiu atten-
dant on foot. Start very early and traverse the desert to Wiidi CS-.
Shth (see p. 517), reaching the Sinai Monastery next evening. Thence
travel slowly to Mrtidi Ba'ba'. Lastly, return to Suez by forced marches,
taking ahout two days and a night. The whole Journey may thus be
accomplished in eight days, without reckoning the stay at the monastery,
and perhaps at Firiin, and as a sheltered resting-place may always be
found among the mountains, the protection of a tent will never be missed,
excepting perhaps on the last day of the expedition.

DISTANCES AND DISPOSITION OF TIME. There are of course several
land-routes to the Monastery of Sinai, but we need only describe the
mostinteresting 0ftl1em, and those Which are generally taken by tra-
vellers. As a standard of distance we adopt the time usually occupied
by the camels in performing thejumrney. Their average rate uftravelling
is about'21/2 ll, per hour.

\Vhen a journey in the East is to last for several days, it will be
found impossible to induce the boatmen on the Nile, Or the'Children
of the Desert', to start early in the merging, as they insrariably seem to
think that a lhte hour in the afternoon is the most suitable time, s so that
a very short distance only is performed on the tirst day. So 011 the
tour to Sinai the party seldom gets farther than rtin Muse (see below)
on the first day, but on the second and following days more satisfactory
progress is made. Patience is therefore indispensable at starting. The
journey is usually made without any prolonged halt, except at the mines
of 1viidi \lughara in the Wtidi Mokatteb, in which we speud 3-4 hrs. "
