e iyious Festivals. CAIRO. 3. Route. 237

The great festival of the M61411) EN-NEBI, the birthday of the prophet,
is celebrated at the beginning of Rabi' eZ-awwel. the third month. The
preparations for it begin on the second day of the month, and the most
important ceremonies take place On the evening of the eleventh. The
city, and particularly the scene of the festival, is then illuminated by
means of lamps hung on wooden stands made for the purpose. Proces-
sions of dervishes (p. 150) parade the streets with flags by day, and with
lamps hoisted on poles by night. On this evening the sellers of sweet-
meats frequently exclaim -'A grain of salt for the eye of him Who will
not bless the prophet!' The Déseh, or ceremony of riding over the der-
vishes, also took place on the eleventh of this month. Some fifty der-
vishes or more lay close together on the ground, and allowed the shékh
of the Sa'diyeh dervishes on horseback to ride over them. Accidents
rarely happened, although the horse trod on every one of the pro-
strate figures. During this ceremony the spectators shouted incessantly,
'AIIiih-1f-lii-1ii-Mh-Mhr.' This barbarous custom was forbidden by the
Khedive Tewfik, and the ceremonies are confined to the procession of the
shékh and the reading of the Koran in the Khedive's tent. At night
a great zikr is performed by the dervishes (p. 239). On this festival, as
On all the other'm6lids', the jugglers, buffoons, and other ministers of
amusement, ply their calling with great success (comp p. 150).

In the fourth month, that of Babit et-Akhir (et-ttini), occurs the peer1-
liarly solemn festival of the birthday or Métid of 7tsiia, the prophet's
grandson, the principal scene of Which is the mosque of Hasanén, where
the head of Husén is said to be interred. This festival lasts fifteen days
and fourteen nights, the most important day being always a Tuesday
(gem et-teldl). On this occasion the'flurdntyeh Dervishes (p.150) sometimes
go through their hideous performance of chewing and swallowing burning
charcoal and broken glass, and their wild dances. On the chief days of
this festival, and on their eves, great crowds congregate in and around
the mosque, and especially by the tomb of Sultan esyfjiilelt in the
bazaar of the Nal.1riisin (p. 256). On these occasions the Karin is read
aloud to the people, the streets adjoining the mosque are illuminated,
the shops are kept open, and story-tellers, jugglers, and others of the
same class attract numerous patrons.

In the middle of Regeb, the seventh month, is the Mélid of Seiyideh
Zénab ('Our Lady Zénab0, the grand-daughter of the prophet. The fes-
tival, which lasts fourteen days, the most important being a Tuesday, is
celebrated at the mosque of the Seiyideh Zénab (p. 268), where she is said
to be buried.

On the 27th of this month is the Lélei el-Mfrtig, or night of the as-
eension of the prophet. the celebration of which takes place outside the
Bith el-'Adawi, in the N. suburb of Cairo.

On the first, or sometimes on the second, 1Vednesday of Sha'bdn, the
eighth month, the JWlid of Imdm Shrtfe'i is commemorated, the centre of
attraction being the burial-place of 1jir0.rilrtrfeh (p. 327). This festival
is numerously attended, as most of the Cairenes belong to the sect of
Imam Shiiferi (p. IM) ). The ceremonies are the same as those at the
other molids.

The mouth of Ramagldn (p. 148), the ninth, is the month of fasting,
which begins as soon as a Muslim declares that he has seen the new
moon. The fast is strictly observed during the day, but the faithful in-
demnify themselves by eating, drinking, and smoking throughout the
greater part of the night. At dusk the streets begin to he thronged, the
story-tellers at the eafés attract large audiences, and many devotees as-
semble at the mosques. The eve of the 27th of the month is considered
peculiarly holy. It is called the Ltlet el-Kadr, or'night of value', owing
to the tradition that the Koran was sent down to Mohammed on this
night. During this sacred hight the angels descend to mortals With bless-
ings, and the portals of heaven stand open, affording certain admission to
the prayers of the devout. On this night the traveller should visit the
Hasanén mosque, or, especially if accompanied byladies, that of Moham-
med'Ali (p. 263) in the citadel, in order to see the great zikrs of the
