same day only 705,5f18,384) cuhie mbtres passed Cairo. At the
confluence of the White and Blue Nile their average volumes are
in the proportion of three to one, hut the latter assumes far
greater importance when swollen by the Abyssinian rains. The
Blue Nile is in fact a species of monntain-torrent, being liable to
rise suddenly and sweep away everything it encounters on its ra-
pidly descending course. It is therefore. called the Ruhr el-Away,
i. e. the blue,'dark', or'trrrbir1', in eontradistinetion to the Bohr
el-Abyad, Le. the white, or rather the'elear' river, whose water
descends from clear lakes and is farther filtered by the vast grassy
plains and oeeasional floating plants through which it passes.
The Blue Nile [ together with its eeadjntor the Atbara) may there-
fore he regarded as the sole origin of the fertility of Etrypt, and also
as the cause of the inundation, while on the other hand the regular
and steady supply of water afforded by the White Nile performs the
very important office of preventing; the lower part of the river from
drying up altogether in summer. The White Nile is not only much
larger than the Blue in average volume, but is, with its tributaries,
more than double thelength. It does not, however, remain very long
undivided. Higher up, in SP y. latitude, it receives on the east
side the waters ofthehlobiit, astream descending from the mountains
to the southofAbyssinia, and resemhiingthe mneNile in character,
though much smaller. A little farther up, on the opposite side,
the White Nile is joined by the Baht el-Ghuz√©t, er Gazelle River,
a very sluggish stream, fed by numermls springs rising; in the Nyanr-
nyaln and Kredy regions, between Jp' and i'Ph. latitude. Higher up
the river takes the nameofliuhr el-Gebel, and is considerably smal-
ler in volume, and beyond ij" N. latitude it ceases to he navigahle,
as it descends in a series of rapids from the Albert A'ynnza or
Mmmm Luke. This sheet of water is connected by another riw-r,
the'Somerset', which may he regarded as the continuation of the
White Nile, "ith the Victoria Nyanou or I'kerewc Lake; while the,
Shimiju and other S. feeders of the latter may be called the ulti-
mate sources of the Nile.

The Valley of the Nile from liharttom to the Delta, although
from its great length C15" of latitude") necessarily possessing great
varieties of climate, forms one long unbroken tract of country, the
fertilising soil of "hieh is brought down by the Blue Nile from the
Abyssinian mountains.

The breadth of the Valley of the Nile, including the barren land
immediately flanking it, varies from 41/2 to'1" miles in Nnhia, and
from 14 to 32 miles in Egypt. The banks, of which the eastern is
called the'Arabian', and the western the'Lihyan', rise at places
to upwards of 1HOHft., resembling two large canal emhankments,
between which the river has forced its passage through the plateau
of'Nubian sandstone' (_which extends to the Gebel Heiseieh above
hui), and through the nnmmnlite limestone of Upper and Central
