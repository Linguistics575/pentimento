HISTORY.

of the Bible), prince of Sais, became the most prominent.
After I'lsarhaddon's death Taharka endeavoured to shake off
the Assyrian yoke, but was defeated and driven out of Egypt
by Assurbunipal (ehirdanupalus), Esarhaddon's son and sue-
s-esser. The vassal princes assisted Taharka, but were par-
< lmied hy Assurbanipal and reinstated in their provinces on
a solemn vow of future obedience.

Nat-Amen (Assyr. Urdunumi) captured Memphis and won
hack the whole, of Lower Egypt, hut was in his turn defeated
by y'xardauapalus, who again invaded Egypt.

After the departure of the Assyrians and the decline of
their power under the successors of Sardanapalus, the petty
l-Igyptian princes attained vomplete independence and cs-
tahiished the so-eailed'Oodo, karcl1y'. An end. however, was
put to this by Psummetilch, son ofNekho, and prince of Sais
and Memphis, with the aid of Ionian and (larian mercen-

'aries. As the nephew (by marriage) of Shahako (p. 91)

Psammetikh was the legitimate heir of the Ethiopian dy-
nasty, and he accordingly ascended the throne of Egypt and
founded the -

XXVI. DYNASTY (Sdites; pp. 163, 4'27, 446).

Psammetikhl. (Egypt. Psemiek, Gr. Psummeiiehusip. 385),
in order to consolidate his empire, assigned dwellings to the
Greek mercenaries in the fertile region of Rubastis, and fa-
voured foreigners in many ways. The warrior caste of Egypt,
highly offended at this proceeding, emigrated to Ethiopia,
and there founded the kingdom of the Somhrides. Profiting
by the decline of the power of Assyria, Psammetikh made
war against the wealthy i'hienieian seaports, but was stoutly
opposed by the Philistines.

Nekho (( irk. Nachos, Egypt. Nekau; p. -'l'27), the son of
l'sammetikh, was mere i-oneerned ['op the domestie welfare
of the country than for military glory. During his reign the
s. extremity of Africa was eireumnavigated for the first time
(llerod. iv. 4'2). Nekho began to construct a canal from the
Nile to the lied Sea, but discontinued the, work On being
informed by an oracle that it would only honeiit'strangers.'
Hearing of the campaign of the Modes and llnhylonians
against the Assyrians, he also marched against Assyria, and
defeated Josiah, King; 0t'.h1ilah, the ally ol' the Assyrians, who
opposed him at Jlogiddo. Meanwhiie, however, Nineveh had
fallen, and the Assyrian empire been divided by Cyaxares,
King of) letlia, aml? iahopolassar, hing ofltnhylon; and
Nekho's farther progress was arrested by Nehuehadnezzar,
King ot'iiahyion and son ol'Nahopolassar, who defeated him
at Karkemish (i" ircesiun0. Nekho thus lost his possessions
in Syria and Palestine.
