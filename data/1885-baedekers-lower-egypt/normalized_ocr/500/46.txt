generally a puff, or kind of saucer of egg-eup shape. To be passed
over when eoil'ee is handed round is deemed by the Beduins an
insult of the gravest kind. llaving emptied his cup, the visitor
must not put it down on the ground, which is contrary to etiquette,
but keep it in his hand until it is taken from him by the servant,
after which he salutes his host in the usual Oriental fashion by
placing his right handi on his breast and afterwards raising it to his
forehead, and pronouncing the word'dtimun' Ci. e.'liahweh
tliiman', may you never want coffee). This custom originated
with the lieduins, who only regard the persons of their guests as
inviolahle after they have eaten or drunk with them. When vi-
sited hy natives, the European should in his turn regale them
liberally with coffee. It is also usual to offer tohaeeo to the visitor,
the cigarette being new the ordinary form. The long pipe (shibulc)

the sole motive of those who use them being the hope of some
gain or balishish. The best way of dealing with persons who'do
protest too mueh' is to pay for every service or civility on the spot,
and as far as possible to fix the price of every article beforehand, a
plan which is usually eil'eetual in limiting their mercenary designs.

struck with the fact that the, degraded 1mftianism so common in the
most eiviliseil countries is unknown in Egypt. The people of the
country, even the poorest and the entirely uneducated, often possess

the traveller's own countrymen of a far more favoured class are
sometimes utterly destitute. Notwithstanding, their individual sol-
