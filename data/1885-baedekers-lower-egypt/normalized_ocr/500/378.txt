Asenath, in marriage. On lay in the land of Gesheu, and we learn
from the monuments that even after the Exodus it was still in-
hahited by a considerable number of Semites. The Arabs named
it'Ain Shams, which means'well of the sun'.

From a very early period the Sun Temple of Ra (Tum-llarmaehis,
p. 127), the most famous and ancient shrine in Egypt, with the excep-
tion of that ot' Ptah of Memphis, was the scene of magnificent rites in
honour of the cycle of deities connected with the worship of the sun.
The chief of these were Tum and Ra-Harmaehis, with bis companion
Theth, Sehu and Tefnut, children of Tum, Osiris in the character of the
soul of Ila. (called'the ancient of Heliopolis'), Horus, and Isis, the last
named deity being specially worshipped here under the highly revered
name of Isis-llathnr, 01' Venus Urania, who was sometimes known as
Isis of An. The Nnevis hull was also revered here, heing the animal
sacred to Ra, while the Apis hull of Memphis, which abode for a time at
Heliopolis before its introduction into its sanctuary in the town of the
pyramids, was associated with Pitth. The lions which were kept here
perhaps had reference to Sehu and Tefnut, the brother and sister, who
were represented as lions, 01' perhaps, owing to the glossiness of their
skins and their natural fire, to the shining and glowing orb of day.
With regard In the Pltoem'm, the bird of Ita, which was worshipped here,
and which brings its ashes to Heliopolis, see p. 127. Cats and a white
sow were also regarded as sacred here.

The foundation of the temple is of very remote origin. In the'great
hall' here the wounds of Horus, received in his combat with Seth Ty-
phon (p.130), are said to have been healed. Amenemha I., the fhrst king
of the 19th Dynasty, restored the shrine of Tum and laid the foundation
of the Sun Temple, in front of which his Sun Usertesen erected the
Obelisk which still stands here.

The immense wealth of this shrine is mentioned by various papyri,
and particularly the Harris papyrus in London, which gives a list
of the gifts presented tu it by Ramses III. alone. The stall' of priests,
of'fieials, custodians, and meniais connected with the temple is said
to have numbered no less than 12.913. As each Pharaoh was re-
garded as a human embodiment of lla, it was natural that he should
present special oiferings to the chief scene of the warship of that gud,
and should proudly add to his titles that of'brrd ofllelioyor1ss'. The most
celebrated of the ancient schools, with the teachers nf which Herodoius
once eunversed, was also established at Heliupulis, while in Strabo's time
(horn ii.C. 60) the famous seat nt' learning had ceased to exist, although
the huuses of the priestly schnlars were still standing. The guides showed
the great. geographer the dwelling in which Plato and Eudoxus were
said to have resided for thirteem?) years; Hor', he says, speaking of
the prefeSsm-s at this university,'these persons, "admirably imbued
with knowledge of heavenly things, could only be persuaded by patience
and politeness to ctunmunicatc same of their doeirines; hut most of
them were concealed hy these barbarians.' () belisks, the emblems
of the suis rays, were uf enurse frequently dedicated to the god of the
sun and his temple; and we are accordingly infnrmed that Itelinpulis
was'full of ohelisks'.

Lepsius in the b'eeropolis of Memphis, this is the oldest yet dis-
eovered, having been erected by Usertesen, with the pronomcn
1la-khoper-ka, the second king of the 12th Dynasty. The com-
panion obclisk (for these monuments were always erected in
pairs) stood, as Mohammedan writers inform us, down to the 12th
century. Each of the four sides bears an inscription in the bold
