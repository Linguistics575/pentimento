370 Route d. ABU ROASH. Environs

there are two long'mortar-pits' (P1. m), and soon regain the
Kiosmle of the Khedive (p. 3i2), from which we started. The so-
called Tomb of Numbers Cp. 366) is on the E. side of the plateau,
a little above the mud-huts of the Beduins.

The Prnsmns OI" Ani) Roisn, the northernmost group in the Necro-
pulis of Memphis, present little attraction, and are not worth visiting.
Standing in front of the vieeroyal kiosque on the plateau of the Great
Pyramid of Urizeh. we perceive towards the N. an abrupt ridge of rock
descending to a. branch of the Nile, and to the right, at its base, two
villages shaded by palm trees. The nearer of these is Kerddsa, the in-
habitants of which are occupied in cutting Hints for the primitive guns
still used in Egypt. The large quantities of splinters seen here suggest
to us that the so-called'tlint tools' (p. 485) found in other parts of Egypt
may possibly he merely the refuse from similar workshops. Immediately
beyond Kerdiisa is Abit Roish, which luay be reached in 1% -2, hrs. by a
route skirting the desert. On the margin of the plateau close to Abt)
Ito'iish 0n the N.W. side, rise the shapeless remains of a Pyramid of Nile
Jilud, which is constructed round a nucleus of massive stone. On a ridge
of rock descending precipitously to the margin of the desert, and reached
by a path ascending a hollow, near the white tomb of a shékh, and
1/4 hr. before the Mud Pyramid is reached, are situated the remains of
two pyramids. One of these now eensists of four or five courses of stone
only, and (according to Col. Vyse) contains a chamber reached from the
N, side by a Passage inclined at an angle of 22°, and 53 yds. in length.
Each side measures 18yds. The other pyramid, to the W. of the
last, is now a mere heap of ruins. A stone dyke, about (loo yds. in
length, leads from the N. to the hill on which these two pyramids stand.
Numerous fragments of granite strewn about here indicate that this me-
erial has been used either for the construction of the tomb-ehambers or
for the external incrustation of the pyramid. No inscriptions were found
here. Distinct traces of a, neeropolis now entirely destroyed are ubServ-
able near these two pyramids, and also nu the plateau ascending to the
W. from the Mud Pyramid. The pyramids of Abil Ro'iish seem to belong
to one of the first dynasties, but nothing certain is known about them.

FROM GEZEH TO ABUsiR AND Singigftlm (p. 371) is a ride of about
23/, hrs., skirting the margin of the desert. To the left lie patches of
cultivated land and a number of ponds, containing more or less water in
accordance with the height of the last inundation, bordered with vegeta-
tion, and frequented by numerous birds; beyond which ilows the Bahr
Ytisuf arm of the Nile (p. 456). After 1 hr. we observe the remains of
two pyramids on the right. The first of these (N.), near the village of
fftitoyet el-rAryda, must once have been an important monument, as the
sides are still nearly 100 yds. in length. The second ts.), near the hnvels
of Riga, is now a mere heap of debris. In One hour more, passing the
village of 8hobevment, we reach the Pyramids of Abuslr (comp. Nap,
p, 378), the ancient Busiris (2 hrs. to the S.S.E. of the Pyramids of Gizeh,
and 3/4 hr. to the N.N.E. of Saistctra), situated on a rocky eminence cov-
cred with sand. The masonry of these monuments, having originally
been constructed with no great care, is now much damaged, and their
bases are covered with sand, so that a visit to them is uninteresting.
They were erected by kings of the 5th Dynasty. The entrances are on
the N. sides, and, as in all the other pyramids, there is a. passage, at flrst
slanting and afterwards horizontal, leading to the chamber in the centre.
The northernmost of the three largest pyramids (once fourteen in number),
lying close together, belonged to a certain Sahara, and was styled that
of the'giorhms cmerging' (tie. of the deceased into another World }. At
a very curly period divine honours were accorded to this Pharaoh, and
'sacritie, es Wore offered to his manes so late as the time of the Ptolemies.
The pyramid was enclosed by a wall, to which a still traceable path as-
cended frmu a building (probably a temple) situated in the plain. Its
perpendicular height was 163% ft. (new 118 ft), its sides WON 955% ft.
