Ra, is represented with the head of a crocodile, and was chiefly
revered in the region of the cataracts at Silsili, Ktnn-0mhu, and in
the Faytm (p. 457). At Ktorn-0mbu Sebek forms a triad in con-
junction with IIathor and Khunsu. His crocodile head is crowned
with the disk, the Thanvs basilisks, and the double feather. He
grasps the seeptre and the symbol of life in his hands, and is
coloured green. His sacred animal, the crocodile, was kept in
his honour, but a certain Typhonic character was attributed to the
reptile, as the sacred lists omit those uomes where it was worshipped.

Ammon-Ra. Ra o. 1'27), with whose worship the rites of many
other divinities were c01s1bined, and whose attributes were frequently
merged in those of Osiris, reigned, according to the later inserip-
tions, as the great monarch of the gods, but Ammon, who was
revealed to the esoteries as a son of Ptah, obtained possession of
the throne of this world, while Ra continued his sovereignty in
Amenthes, or the nether regions. Ammon, whose name signifies
'the hidden one', is a deity of comparatively late origin, having
been at first merely the local god of Thebes; but after the valley
of the Nile had been delivered from the Hyksos under bis auspices,
and after Upper Egypt and Thebes had gained the supremacy over
Lower Egypt and Memphis, he was, raised to the rank of king of
all the gods. The attributes of almost the entire Pantheon of
Egypt were soon absorbed by this highly revered deity. He reposes
as a hidden power in Nun, or the primordial waters, and during



Khem Amun.
