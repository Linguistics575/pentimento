and simple characters of the old empire; but those 011 two of the
sides have been rendered illegible by the bees which have made
their coils in the deeply out hieroglyphics. The pyramidium at the
top was covered with metal at a comparatively late period. The
ground on which it stands has been so considerably raised by
deposits of mud, that a great part of the obelisk is 110W buried.
The inscriptions, which are the same on each of the four sides,
record that Usertesen I. (Ra-kheper-ka), King of Upper and
Lower Egypt, lord of the diadems and son of the sun, whom
the (divine) spirits of An (Heliopolis) love, ete., founded the
obelisk on the first day of the festival of Set, celebrated at the close
of a period of thirty years. Cambyses is said to have destroyed
fIeliopolis, but it is ascertained that the city still contained many
objects of interest down to a late Mohammedan period.

The excursion may he extended to the village of El-3fev.y (with some
ruins of the 18th Dynasty) and the once prosperous, but now ruinous
Khtinlitih, on the outskirts ot' the desert t'2,1/2 hrs. from Ma.tariyeh), but
the Sole attraction consists in the duck and snipe shooting around the
ponds near Khanhah. An interesting visit may, Isowever, he made without
much trouble to an ostrich farm kept by some Frenchmen, about 1/2 hr.
to the right.

The Birket el- Hagg, or Lake of the Pilgrims, 41/2 M.to the E. of
Matartyeh, presents no attraction except during the latter half of the
lunar month of Shawwa ] when the great caravan which accompanies the
new kisweh, or cover for the Kama, to Mecca, assembles here to celebrate
the so- -ca ] led Nahum ] Festival (p. 936). A similar scene may, however,
be more eonvenienisy viewed at'Abbiisiyeh, where, in the open spaces
on each side of the road before its bifurcation, numerous tents are pitch-
ed and festivities take place at the time of the departure and arrival of
the sacred carpet.

The Mokattam Hills.

The"hrolrattam Hills are well worthy of a visit (on donkey-
back), especially about sunset, or in the morning betw een 8 and 9
o'eloek;. or the ascent may be made by way of 1'eiiiiiifii" iii" to the
excursion to the Petrified Forest o. 337). Those who consider the
expedition too fatiguing may content themselves with the ascent of
the Windmill Hi11 (p.287) at the end of the Muski, or with a visit
to the Citadel (p. 262).

One route to the Mokattam (or G'ebel Giyttsshi, as the range of
hills to the E. of Cairo is sometimes called after the conspicuous
old mosque situated on their summit) starts from the Tombs of the
Khalifs, and the other from the Citadel. The former is recom-
mended for going, and the latter for returning. The whole excursion
takes 3 hours.

Passing the Tombs of the Khalifs, and crossi ng the railway en1-
hankment, we ride in the direction of a dark projecting rock, which
we afterwards leave to the right. The road, which is fairly good, then
ascends along the S.E. side of the large quarry lying on the right,
and bears towards the right. In 3hhr, we reach a large plateau,
011 the W. margin of which rises the dilapidated Mosque of Cr'iytshi.
