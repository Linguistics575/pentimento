being the fat-tailed varieties (outs pachycera wcmw'candro and ovis
platym'a). The wool of the Egyptian sheep is harsh and wiry, while
many of these in the desert have stiff, straight hair, and are altogether
destitute of wool.

The Pig (Arab. khan2tr), which was regarded by the ancient Egyptians
as the emblem of Typhon, and is ennsidered unclean by the Arabs, can
hardly be called one of the domestic animals of Egypt, but it is kept by
l the Greek tuvern-keepers.

The Dog (Arab. Kelli) throughout the whole of the, East is a masterless
and half-wild animal. The usual breed resembles the jackal type, its
colour being of EL light rusty tint. Every canine family has its regular
heat, from which intruders are rigorously excluded. Most of the Egyptian
dogs feed on street refuse.

The Cat (Arab. kogg, ko.t.teh), which was one of the sacred animals of
the ancient Egyptians (comp. p. t3 (0, is now domesticated in almost every
Egyptian and Beduin family.

The Weasel (musteta semipalmata; Arab.'crsa, or (diet'm'tls), is Oiia-
sionally kept, like the eat, for the purpose of keeping: in check the
mice of uumereus kinds with which the country is infested. It is chiefly
met with in it half-wild condition in Central and Lower Egypt, in the
towns, farm-buildings, warehouses, and deserted dwellings.

Foremost among the various kinds of poultry kept by the Egyptians
is the domestic Hen (Arab. farklm; eoek, diff), the usual breeds uf which
are of small size. The artitieial hatching establishments in Egypt are of
very ancient origin.

The Turkey (Arab. farkha What) is imported.

The domestic Goose (Arab. wuzzeh) is othiefly met with in Lower
and Central Egypt, but nowhere in large numbers. The Egyptian
Domestic Pigeon (Arab. lmmdm) is very common throughout the Nile
Valley. The peasants erect large dnveeots for these pigeons, which they
keep solely for the sake of the manure they yield.

11. WILD ANIMALS. As there are no game-laws in Egypt, any one
provided with a license from the police to carry fire-arms is at liberty
to shoot, anywhere and at any season, provided enclosed gardens be not
entered, and growing crops respected. Permission to shoot on Lake
Menzaleh, however, must be obtained from the farmer of the tisuintgs,
an introduction to whom may easily be procured from the traveller's
consul at Cairo.

Tolerable guns and other requirements for the clmsse may be pur-
chaSed at Cairo (p. 235), but gunpowder is bad and dear. Sportsmen
who bring their own .guns will find it very troublesome to clear them
at the custom-house.

One of the favourite objects of the chase is the Arabian Mountain,
Goat (Ibex beden; Arab. beden or wa'al), which still frequents the
mountains between the Nile and the Red Sea.

Another inhabitant of the mountains is the'haned Sheep" (Ovis trage-
lnplaus; Arab. Icebsh el-md, or kebslz el-gebel), which is occasionally met
with among the rocky hills near Minyeh and in the neighbourhood of
the Fayt" 1m.

A denizen of the plains between Cairo and Suez, and nf the sand-
hills and heights which bound the valley of the Nile and the oases, is
the Dorcas Gazette (Antilope dorms; Arab. gimzcit), particularly during
the dry and hot season.

On the Libyan side of the Nile, in the region of the Natron Lakes
and the Fayiim, and the tract extending thence to the oaSes, occur also
the'Spear Antelope' (Antitupe leptoceras; Arab. abu-'l (ravdb) and the
Addax Antelope (Antilope adder; Arab. a'lyas, er bazaar et-walzsh), besides
?% ieh the Arabs mention a kind of'Cow Antelope' (perhaps the Antilope

u alts).

The Wild Boar (Arab. talulf) now occurs in a few districts only in
the Delta and the Faydm.

In similar localities the sportsman will also meet with the Marsh
Lynx (Felts chaus; Arab. tifak), the small-footed Wild Cat (Felts manicu-
