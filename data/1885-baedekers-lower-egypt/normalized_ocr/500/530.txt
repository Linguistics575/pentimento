bank, but there are 110 other villages ofimportauieo. A the S.W.
end of the lake is the promontory of Khashm Khalil, overgrown
with tamarisks and reeds, the creeks of which afford good landing-
plaees. Ascending thence across the desert, we reach the temple in
about 11/4 hours. The fishermen object to pass the night 011 the
bank in the neighbourhood of Kasr 1.iurt1n, being afraid of the Be-
duins and the'Afrti' (evil spirits ].

Kasr 1.rurdn is a tolerably well preserved temple, probably of
the Roman, or, at the earliest, of the Ptolemaic period. Before
reaching it we observe numerous traces of an ancient town,
which has now disappeared. The ground is strewn with blocks
of hewn stone, burnt bricks, broken pottery, and fragments of
glass. A circular foundation wall indicates the site of an ancient
cistern, while other walls seem to have belonged to vineyards. The
walls of the temple consist of carefully hewn blocks of hard lime-
stone. This temple, like almost all the shrines in the oases, was
dedicated to the ram-headed Arnmo1r-lil11tum, as is proved by the
only two flgilres of this deity which still exist. They stand opposite
to each other at the highest part of the posterior wall of the upper
story of the open roof.

The temple is 20 yds. in width across the fagade, and 29 yds. in length.
The entrance, facing the E., is approached by a lofty and carefully con-
structed platform, 14 yds. in length, forming il fore-court, on the S. side
of which rises a massive structure resembling a tower. Adjoining the
fueade of the temple, to the w. of the entrance door, rises a. massive,
semicircular projection, resembling the half of a huge column. On the
lower floor are the apartments of the, temple which were dedicated to
worship, divided into a triple prosekos, and leading to the Sekes or sane-
tuary. In the first three rooms the grnund slopes down towards the sane-
tnary, which, built in the form of a cella, adjoins the third roam of the
prosekos, and (as in the case of other temples) was divided into three
small moms at the back. The sanctuary is flanked by two narrow pas-
sages, each of which is adjoined by three rooms. The rooms of the pro-
sekos also have adjacent chambers from which we may enter the cellars,
or ascend by two flights ofsteps to the upper floor with its ditl'ei-ent apart-
ments, and thence to the roof, whence we obtain an extensive view of the
remains of the ancient eity, of the lake, and the desert. Each gate of this
curious building is surmounted by a winged disc of the Sun; and over
the doors leading into the second and third rooms of the prosekos and
into the sanctuary, instead of the ordinary concave cornice, there is a
series of Urseus snakes, which, with their outstretched heads and hend-
ng necks, together form a. kind of cornice. The names of several trtw-
ellers are engraved on the stone of the first mow, including those of Paul
Lucas, R. Pocecke, Jomard, Roux, d'Anville Coutelle, Bellier, Burton,
Belzeni, Hyde, and Paul Martin. liner liuriin has also been visited by
Lepsius. There are no ancient inscriptions remaining.

To the Fl. of the large temple are situated two smaller Roman temptes,
in tolerable preservation, the larger of which, situated 300 paces from the
smaller, is net without interest. Its walls (18 ft. by 19 ft.) consist of
good. burnt bricks, and its substructures of solid stone; the cella. ter-
minates in a niche resembling an npse; on each of the side-walls are
two half-columns, which, as the fragments lying on the ground show,
halting tn the Junie order. There are also some less important ruins
unvering an extensive area. hut nothing has been found among them
dating from an earlier period than the Roman. The cvnsf, ruction of the
walls, the architectural ] forms, and many coins found here, are llnman;
