Mohammed'Ali and his Successors.

In the year 1803 the Fremh consul Matthieu de Lesseps
was commissioned by his government to seek for some snit-
able man to counteract the influence of the English and the
Mamelukes in Egypt, and he aorordingly reeonnnended fer
the purpose Mohammed'Ali, who was born at Kavaia in
lloumelia in 1709, and who was at that period colonel
(bimbushé) of an Albanian corps of 1000 men in Errypt.

Nol1atnmed'Ali, having succeeded in removing most ofhis
enemies, is appointed Pasha of Egypt. In 1807 he frustrates
an attempt of the English to take possession ofEgypt, and on
lst March, 1811, causes the Mameiuke beys, who prevented
the progress of the emmtry, to be treacherously assassinated.
together with their followers (170 in number). His son,
Tustin Pasha, wages a successful war against the Wah-
habites in Arabia, and deprives them ofMecca and Medina.
Mohammed improves the agriculture ongypt by introducing
the eotton-plaut, and by restoring the canals and emhank-
ments, appoints Frenchmen and other Europeans to various
public ofiieos, and sends young Egyptians to Paris to be
educated. During the Greek war of independence he sends
"34,000 men to the aid ofthe sultan, as a reward for which he
is presented with the island of Candie at the close ofthe war.
In 1831, aiming at complete independence, he makes war
against the Porte. His son Ibrahim invades Syria, and cap-
tures'Akka i27th May, 1832), Damascus (Sth July ], and
Haieb (Plst Dee), destroys the Turkish fleet at litonyeh
(Iconium), and threatens Constantinople itself. IJis vie-
torious career, however, was terminated by the intervention
of Russia and r'ranee. Syria is secured to Mohammed by
the peace of h" ul0hyeh, but he is obliged to recognise the
suzerainty ofthe Porto. At the instigationoftheEngiish, Sul-
tfm Mahmi'id renews hostilities with Egypt, but is decisively
defeated by Ibréhim at Nisibi on 24th June, 1830. ln ron-
sequence of the armed intervention of England and Austria,
however, Ibrahim is compelled to quit Syria entirely, and
Mohammed is obliged to yield to the Porte a second time.
lly the so-ealledilrrnan of investitnre in 1811 Sultan AhduT-
Jledjid secured the hereditary sovereignty of l-Igypt to the
family of Mohammed'Ali, the pasha renouneing his provin-
c'es of Syria, Candia, and the Ijija'iz, and binding himself to
pay an annual tribute of 60,000 p11rses (about 30b',000l.)
to the. Porto and to reduce his army to 13,000 men. During
