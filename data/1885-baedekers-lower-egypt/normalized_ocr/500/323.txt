Most of the students, particularly those whose native tongue is not
Arabic, begin their university education by learning the Arabic grammar
(Ulm en-nrqeu). The next branch of study is religious science ('ilm et-
keldm), the introduction to which Consists of a series of preparatory lec-
tures on the attributes of God and the prophet (Wm et- -taul.tid, i. e. the
doctrine of the unity of God). The chief attributes of God are said
to be the following twelve: existence, source of all being, eternity, in..
dependence, unity, omnipotence, will (in accordance with which he rules
the universe, man being powerless to save himself from sin or to be
pious without the assistance and grace of God), omniseienee (or know-
ledge of everything that happens between the lowest foundations of the
earth and the 10ftiest heights of the flrmament), life, vision (which enables
him to see everything everywhere, without the aid of light, and without
eyes), hearing (without ears, in the same way as he knows without a
brain, and overthrows without Lands), and speech (in a language that has
had no beginning, a language withm1kletters m- sounds, which is inherent
in his nature, and does not resemble human speech).

After having completed his course of religious instruction, the student
proceeds to study law film el-.fi.kh).

'Jurisprudence', says Ibn Kha1dCin, one of the greatest of Arabian
thinkers,'is a knowledge of the precepts of God in relation to the actions
of men, some of which it is our duty to perform, while others are for-
bidders, 01- recommended, or permitted- and this knowledge is derived
from the book of God, i.e. the Forri'uy, from the Sunua (i. e. tradition),
and from the inferences drawn by the lawgiver (Mnhammed) from sur.
iieient materials LTorded by the Itorti.ihe study of Jaw is therefore
based upon the exegesis nf the Koran (tafsw) and of tradition (hadith).

The science of law is divided into two branches: -

(1) The doctrine of the Chief Religious Commandments of El -hsliim,
viz. fa) Et- Tauhid, or the recognition of God' 3 unity and of Mohammed
as his prophet, (b) The Salat and Talnirm Or the duty of repeating the
canonical pieyers in connection with the ztbiutions- (e) The 1Sadtr.ka and
Zaiclt, or giving of aims and payment of a religious tas; (d) The S2ydm,
or fasting during the month of Ramailiin; l (e) The Hagg, or duty of per-
forming a pilgrimage to Mecca.

(2) The doctrine of Secular Law, civil and criminal, either as expressly
laid down by the Koran, or as iiiiiiiiiie" from it. The legal literature
again is divided into two classes, one embracing systematic expositions
of the law of the Keren, and the other consisting of the decisions (fetwa)
and opinions of celebrated jurists in special and difficult cases.

Besides these le'tding branches of instruction, logic Cihrs el-man.ti.k)
rhetoric ('ilm el- mm Yttti wal bayan), the art of poetry Cilm" el -'aeth.1), the
proper mode of reciting the Koran (Hlrn el- kirct a), and the correct pro-
nunciation of the letters (rilm' et- tejufi6) are also taught..

The above list of the subjects taught at the most important of3Ioham-
medan schools will serve to convey an idea of the intellectual condition
of Orientals at the present day. The most conspicuous defect of their
Culture consists in the entire absence of independent thought, in conse-
quence of which they are the mere recipients of the knowledge of the
past. Their minds are thus exclusively occupied with the lowest grade
of intellectual work, their principal task consisting in the systematic
arrangement or encycloptedic compilation of the knowledge handed down
to them. Some of the shekhs of the Azhar are men of marvellous erudi-
tion, but they eie destitute of creative power, or of the ability to utilise
their old materials for the construction of any new ediflee, and they ad-
here faithfully to the notion of their forefathers that the greatest
triumph of mental labour is to learn by heart any work of acknowledged
literary value. Doubt and criticism, which so often serve to open up fresh
sources of knowledge, are unknown to them; with natural history they
are entirely anaequainted;, and even geometry, tt,1" t and astronomy, so
assiduously cultivated by the ancient Arabs, have now fallen into ob-
livion. So well satisfied are they, moreover, with their own wisdom,
that they utterly despise the scientuie pursuits of the Western world.
