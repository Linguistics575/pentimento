year fell hy IU days, and after 100 years by loo days, short of the end of the
true.'r'othis year, and festivals recurred at seasons to which they did not

and the beginning of the new year again coincided with the rise of Sothis.
Thus in n period of HUU frsurnl, or Mot variable, years the error in the
Egyptian calendar was rectified.
