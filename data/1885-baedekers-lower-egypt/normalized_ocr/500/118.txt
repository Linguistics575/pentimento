Period of the Ptolemies.

Ptolemy I. Soter (p. 2l'y), son of Lagus, and one of-Alex-
ander's generals, now became Macedonian governor of Egypt.
He defeated Antigonus am ] Perdieeas, who threatened the
inilependeuist' of' his province, and in 305, after the assass-
ination of Alexander ll. sEgus, the son of Alexander the
Great, he assumed the title of King of Egypt. In conse-
quence of the foundation of the Alemandriun Museum (p.
IIN) for the reception of learned men7 as well as of literary
treasures, Alexandria soon superseded Athens as the chief
nursery of Greek literature. Two years before his death.
which took place in 96-1, Ptolemy I. abdicated in favour of
his son,

Ptolemy ll, Philadelphus (pp. 85, LW?, iii)

Ptolemy III. Euerg.etes I. (11.91? 314) in the eomse oi'
two emnpaigrns eonFiored the empire of the Selem ides and
Uilivia in Asia Minor. The power of Egypt abroad was now
at its zenith.

Ptolemy IV. Philopator. Under this King and his Sllp-
eessors, a series ofdegenerate oaonarehs, the great empire ol'
the Ptolemies hastened to its destruction. He defeated
Antiochus the Great ofSyria, who had marched towards the
Egyptian frontier, at the Battle of llaphia, but concluded a
dishonoumhle peace with him.

Ptolemy V. Epiphanes (p. 4710 ] ascended the throne.
when tive years of ago, under the guardianship ofAgathoNes
and fl'hvathe, the mother of the latter. In consequence of
revolts at Alexandria aud Lyeopolis, and an attack by
Antioehus the Great of Syria, his guardians were obliged
to resign their ortlee in favour of the Roman Senate, by
whom Ctelvsyria and Palestine were ceded to Antioehus,
while 1'0 gypt continued to beirulependent. P toiemy V., hav-
ing been prematurely t1ev) ared of full age, in 100, married
(' leopatral., daughter of \ntioehus the Great. iid, alliauee
not only secured peace abroad, but caused a portion of the
revenues of C1uelesyria, l'hrpniein, and Jndzea again to flow
into the treasury ofAlesatulria. The internal affairs ot' the
rountry, however, fell into a state of deplorable eenl'usion;
one rebellion succeeded another, and anarchy prevailed
every where.

Ptolemy V. was poisoned.

Ptolemy VI, Eupator, his son, died the same year.

Ptolemy VII, Philometor, the second 5011 ol' l'tolemy V.
