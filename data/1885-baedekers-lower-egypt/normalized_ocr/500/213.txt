ARABIC LANGUAGE. 10f



vowel), OI' with a syllable ending in a double consonant, the accent
is placed on the last syllable (as in tnaghruf.rls, b & dingdn, at'nvfss,
ketébt, taghttmm, each of Which has the stress on the last syllable).
Ifthe last syllable has any other form, i. e. ifit terminates in a vowel
only, or in a consonant preceded by a shortvowel, the accent in the
ease of a dissyllable is on the first syllable (as in ge'zmch, btirnus,
(rzr8lia, re'di), and in the ease of a trisyllable or polysyllable 0n the
third syllable from the end (as mdrmala, mdhbam, mddench), ex-
cept when the penultimate is a long syllable (as in sibanilch), in

which case the accent is on that syllable.

ADDRESS. The inhabitants of tnwns use, the 2nd person plural in ad-
dressing a person, or a periphrasis, such its gendbak (your honour), lm-
tlretak (your presence), 01- to a patriarch glmbtatkzun, to a Pasha saecidetak.
Yrt stUi (O sir) is also frequently used, and to Europeans, ya khawdgeh.

Possessxves. These are expressed by means of affixes. Thus, bintt,
my daughter; bintak (ik when the person addressed is feminine), thy
daughter; binm, his daughter; binthd, or bintahd. her daughter; binmd
m- bintimi, our daughter; bintkum 0r bintztkum, your (pl. r) daughter; bin-
tuhum, their daughter. The idea of possession is colloquially expressed
by the use of the word beldr ('property0, as ei-tttbd betd'i, my slave ('the
slave my property)

ARTICLE. The definite article cl or al is assimilated before dentals,
sihilants, and the letters "and J'.' thus, esh-shems, the sun, etc.

DEMONSTRATIVES. In Egypt the word'this' is rendered by de, fem.
di; as er-rdgz'l de, this man; el-bint di, this girl. The Beduins use the
old Arabic and Syrian Adda.'These', dél.'That', dikita, dztkha, dukhauwa,
dikhaiya; plural dukhamma.

RELATIVE: em, omitted after substantives used in a general sense.

1trrEItItoGATIvEB. Who, min; what, Eh, ésh.

DECLENSION. The Substantive is not declinable. The genitive of a
substantive is formed by simply placing it immediately after the sub-
stantive to be qualified, the latter being deprived of its article: thus,
ibn el-bdsha, the son of the pasha. The feminine terminations a, e, i are
in such cases changed into al, at, it.. thus mam, wife; marat cl-lcdgli, the
wife of the judge.

DUAL. The dual termination is gn, fem. etihs.. thus seneh, year;
senetén, two years; rigl, foot; riglée, two feet.

PLURAL. In the masculine the termination is m (as felldlitn, peas-
ants); in the feminine tit (as luira, town, quarter, etc., pl. bdrm). The
plural is, however, usually formed by a radical change of the vowel
sounds of the singular, the change being effected in thirty or forty dif-
ferent ways, so that it becomes necessary for the learner to note carefully
the plural form of every substantive: thus,'ati, spring, pl.'aydn-, tdgir,
merchant, p1. taggde; gebet, mountain, p1. gibtil; .kah'ileli, tribe of Bednins,

I. kabdil.

p'mes. Many of the verbs consist of slightly differing cognate roots,
connected somewhat in the same manner as the English verbs Jay and
lie. Each verb consists of a perfect and present imperfect tense, an
imperative, a participle, and an infinitive.

The above remarks are made merely in order to afford a slight
idea of the structure of the language, the difficulties of which are
such that few persons will venture to enee' mter them, unless they
make a prolonged stay in the country. We should, however, re-
commend the traveller to commit to memory the following words
and phrases of everyday occurrence, a knowledge of which will often

prove useful.
