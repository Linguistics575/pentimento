proper fare. On Sundays and holidays the fares rise considerably, and
it is then often difficult to get a good vehicle. The sdis, or boy who runs
before the carriage to clear the way in the crowded streets, is a very
useful attendant (p. 217y His services are included in the carriage-fave,
but he expects a small additional fee (2 piastres).

Omnibuses ply from the Place de la Bourse (P1.C,4) to the railway stations
and to the ministries, the Khan el-Khalili, and the Shubra-All√©e. Fares,

Donkeys (comp. p. 11) afford the best and most rapid mode of loco-
motion in the narrow and crowded streets of Cairo, and they are to be
met with, day and night, in every part of the town. The attendants often
thrust them unceremoniously on the trave11er's notice by placing them
directly in his path. These animals are to be found in great numbers at
all the most frequented points, and if one is wanted in the middle of the
night the word'rammiir' (p. 11) shouted Outimmediately attracts a large
assortment of them. The donkey-boys of Cairo have all the savoir vivre
of denizens of a large city, and they often possess a. considerable fund of
humour, which they show most readily when well paid. They delight
in excursions into the country (to Satlitra, for: instance), which afford
them a'fantastya', or special treat; and the European will be astonished
at the smallness of their requirements and those of their beasts. The
donkeys are particularly serviceable in the narrow streets of the Arabian
quarter, Which afford shade and coolness, but are not accessible to car-
riages. For a short ride in the town the usual charge is 1-2, piastres
tariff (25-50 e.); for 1 hr., 1 fr,; for a foren00n in the town, 21/2 fr.; f0r
excursions 4-6 fr. per day Oadies' saddle 1 fr. extra), and a halishish of
1/2-3/4 fr. to the boy, unless he has been unciviI. Tvhen a donkey is hir-
ed to carry baggage, its attendant should be required to follow the same
route as the travellers themselves, and always to remain in sight. Per,,
Sons making a prolonged stay, as soon as they have found a good don-
key with proper gear and a satisfactory attendant, had better secure its
future services by the payment of an extra bahshish. Care should be
taken to choose a donkey with sound fore-legs.

Commissionnaires (comp. p. 13). The traveller who is pressed for
time, and wishes to see as much as possible, cannot well dispense
with a Cicerone. The best guides f5-8 fr. per day) are to be had at the
hotels. They often try to induce their employers to engage them for
distant tours, such as that to llt. Sinai, or the voyage up the Nile, but
for such expeditions they are totally unfitted. As a rule, purchases should
never be made in their presence. If, however, the traveller knows a few
words of Arabic, and is not in a hurry, he will soon find his way through
every part of the city and the environs with the aid of his donkey-boy a10ue.

Dragomans (comp. pp. 13, 205). Information as to trustworthy dra-
gomans may be obtained at the traveller's consulate, at the hotels, at
