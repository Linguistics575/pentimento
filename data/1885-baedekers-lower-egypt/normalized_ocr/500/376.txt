Rondl' bint de Fttpalla (where we observe the Sebil of the mother of
ex- -KheiliveIsmaril 011 theleft; Pl. wr), leave thenewguarrl- -houseon
the left, and then follow the Route de l'Al) basieh, which sooninclines
a little to the left. A few years ago this road was flanked with
large heaps ofrnbbish, but these have now given way to villas and
gardens, which extend to the Bib Wsaniyeh. The road is also
pleasantly shaded by the lebbek trees (p. 76) planted here some
time ago.1mmediately after crossing the Khalig (city-eanal),
the'Abhasiyeh road skirts the old mosque of Er. _Zi'1hi'r CPI. 71),
Ft large square pile of buildings, which was called by the French
Fort Sulkouslcy, was afterwards a government bakehouse, and
is now a guaril-homse. A few paces beyond this building we
reach the (right") IMI, J.lasantyek, through which the route to rAb-
bgstyeh lay before the completion of the new road (and which,
heing shorter, may still be followed by riders or walkers). Beyond
this gate the carriage-road runs towards the'N.E., skirting the
desert. At the beginning of it, on the left, is the slaughter-house.
A road to the right leads to the pumps of the water company.

A few hundred paces farther on, the road divides again. The
branch to the right, the old Suez road, leads to an uninteresting
viceroyal ehhteau at the base of the Gebcl el-u1lunar (p. 337), the
ascent of which is recommended.

We follow the road to the left, leading direct to'Abbasiyeh.
On the right wepassamodern public fountain, and on the left an old
burial-mosque and the'European Ilospital'.'Abbistyeh is a group
of houses and cottages, founded by'AbUs Pasha in 1849, in
order to afford suitable accommodation for the lteduin sh√©khs
whose friendship he was desirous of cultivating, and who objected
to enter the city itself. A large palace Which formerly stood here
has been replaced by barracks in the most modern style, besides
which there are numerous older barracks and a military school
with a gymnastie-ground. The English troops are at present en-
camped here. Near the last barraek on the left is a palace of
the ex-khedive's mother, and a little farther on, also to the left,
rises the meteorological and astronomical Observatory. At the
end of the houses of'Abbistyeh begin the new gardens Which have
been reclaimed from the desert. The road crosses two railways,
passes the village of h'ubbeh (left), intersects beautiful orchards
and vineyards, and leads under handsome aeaeias and past numer-
ous sahiyehs to the Palace of Khedive Tewfl.k. The vineyards,
which were planted by Ibrahim Pasha, the grandfather of the
Khedive, and contain various kinds of vines from Fontaineblean,
are eelehratet ]. This property formerly belonged to the late Mustafa
Faz.1l-l'asha, the uncle of the Khedive. The present palace,
how en t has been entirely erected by Tewfili himself. In the de-.
sert, to the right of the road, about 1/2 M. distant, is situated the
Race Course, where races felmerly took place annually in January.
