On the coast of the Delta, which at this remote period was
most probably a very swampy district, densely overgrown with
marsh vegetation, and which was first brought under cultivati0n
in the neighbourhood of This, and afterwards around Memphis,
the towns of Tanis and HeraeleopoIis Parva had been founded at a
very early epoch by seafaring peoples of Semitic origin. They
thence penetrated into the interior of the country, where they
came into collision with the Egyptians coming from the south,
whose culture they adopted. At the same time, however, they
retained their independence under kings of their own, who during
the period of the (3th, 7th, and 8th Dynasties formed the 9th and
10th contemporaneous Dynasties of Heracleopolites, from the year
2iJ9ionwards, and who ruled over the Delta and perhaps the
whole of Lower Egypt. The 11th Dynasty, which put an end to
the sway of the Heracleopolites, is called Diospolite, or Theban,
burin the estimation of the'Egyptians was not a strictly legiti-
mate line.
