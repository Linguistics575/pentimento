of figs.' This walk affords a good view of the street-traffle of the
city, but the palace itself, which was built by Mohammed'Ali and
restored by Isma% Pasha, is uninteresting, especially as the Diwihr,
or Council Chambers, were destroyed by a fire in 1870. The balcony,
however, commands a fine view of the extensive harbour. (Ad-
mission by ticket procured at the Consulate; but the hotel com-
missionnaires sometimes obtain access by payment of a bakshish.)
The Harem, a separate building, facing the sea, is built on the
model of the seraglio at Constantinople. A visit to the neighbour-
ing, Lighthouse is very interesting, especially in the early morning,
but admission is granted only to those provided with an order from
the governor, which may be obtained through the English or Amer-
iean consulate. The Arsenal (P1. ll is not worth visiting.

A drive (3 M.; road very dusty; carriage in the afternoon
10 fr., or after 5 p.111. 5-7 fr., fee l fr.) should also be taken to
the Ginénet cn-Nuzha, or public garden (usually called the Jardin
Pustré). Turning to the right outside the Porte de Rosette CPI. 40),
leaving the European cemeteries to the left, and avoiding the
road which leads in a straight direction to Ramleh, we pass the
waterworks on the left, cross a small mound of ancient rubbish,
and reach the JUtrlyniidtyeh Canal (p. 215 ]. We then turn to the
left, drive for a short time along the canal, and soon reach the
entrance to the gardens, where a band plays on Fridays and Sun-
days from 4 to G pure. Europeans will be interested by the pro-
fusion of exotic plants which thrive here in the open air. A little
higher up is a fine garden belonging to M. Antoniadis, arich Greek
merchant, who has liberally thrown it open to the public. 011 the
days on which the band plays this part of the canal is the resort of
the fashionable world of Alexandria.

tetracing our steps, and following the bank of the canal. which
lies on the left, we observe on the right a long succession of villas
and gardens, including the viceroya ] chateau Nirnreh Tettiteh
('Number Three'), with its handsome entrance, and the chateau
and garden of Jfolmrrem-ney. We may now re-enter the city by
the Porte Moharrem-Bey, or by the Porte de la Colonne Pompée.

Adjoining the W. side of the city is the site of the original
Macedonian Necropolis, a reminiscence of which is preserved in the
Arabic name Gabari [ see below). No traces of the cemetery now
remain, the ground being occupied by a dirty suburb intersected
by very bad roads. About 41/2 N. farther W. are the Quarries of
Melts (pee below), which are hardly worthy of a visit [ carriage
there and back in 2-3 hrs., 10-12 fin).

Starting from the Place Méhémet-hli, we follow the new Rue
Ibrcihim (_l' ]. E, P, 4, 5), which has been constructed straight
through an old Arabian quarter, and at the, end ofit cross the
Mal.tmtuliyeh Canal. We then turn to the loft, crossing the rails
which lead to the extensive new quay, and immediately after-
