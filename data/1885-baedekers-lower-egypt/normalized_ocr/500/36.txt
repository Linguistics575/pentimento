to). Beggars. Bahshish.

Most Uriontals regard the European traveller as a Cruises, and
sometimes too as a madman, - so unintelligible to them are the
objects and pleasures of travelling. Poverty,. they imagine, is
unknown among us, whereas in reality we feel its privations far
more keenly than they. That such erroneous notions prevailis to
Some extent the fault of travellers themselves. In a country where
the requirements of the natives are few and simple, and money is
scarce, a few piastres seem a fortune to many. Travellers are there-
fore often tempted to give for the sake of affording temporary pleasure
at a trifling eost, forgetting that the seeds of insatiable enpidity are
thereby sown, to the infinite annoyance of their successors and the
demoralisation of the recipients themselves. As a. rule, bakshish
should never be given except for services rendered, or to the sick
and aged.

Sir Gardner Wilkinson has justly observed that the cry of'nalc-
shish, Dulcshish, tyt" t lthmvfigeh' (oh, sirl a gift!), with which Euro-
peans are invariably assailed, is an insulting substitute for the
'good day' of other countries. The Arab reserves his pious bene-
1livtions for his own countrymen, but never hesitates to take advan-
tage, of hat he considers the folly of foreign travellers. The best
reply tt such applications is'nui fish, md fish' Cl have, nothing for
you), whieh will generally have the effect ofdisPersingthe assailants.
Hr a beggar may he silenced with the words'Attr'ih ya'tik' (may God
give, thee i ].

The word bulcshtsh, which resounds so perpetually. in the
travellcr's ears during his sojourn in the East, and haunts him long
aftorxrards, simply means'a gift'; and, as everything is to be had
in return for gifts, the word has many different applications.
Thus with halishtsh the tardy formalities of the custom-house
ol'llecr are, accelerator ], hahshish supplies the place of a passport,
hahshish is the aims bestowed on a beggar, balsshish means black
mail, aml lastly a large proportion of the public oftie, ials of the
country are said to live by bahshish or bribery.

Clly). Public Safety. Weapons. Dogs.

l'rnme SAFETY. The authority of the Khedive is so well
established throughout the whole of Egypt that travellers are very
rarely exposed to predatory attacks, even on the Sinai journey, and
trawliing is imlvm ] safer than in some parts of Europe. The pro-
tm-tinn of an "wort is therefore never necessary as it is in certain
regions of Palestine and Syria. Travellers, however, who have
m-h-ntilh- olt.itu'ts in view, and who require the oo-operation of the
natives er of the pasha or mudir of a district, or those who have
l'mu'anll to apprehend any tlifllemlty or danger, may obtain through
thcir vollsnlau-s a vicvrt-gal recommendation (/iruufn or tcslcireh),
which will 0ftt'll be found very useful.
