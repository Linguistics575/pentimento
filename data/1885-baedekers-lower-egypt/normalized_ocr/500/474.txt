frequently offered for sale to travellers as curiosities. The prices de-
manded are usually exorbitant, but may be reduced by bargaining.

The gfothev-of-Peavl Shells (sadaf) of the Red Sea form an important
article of commerce, but, owing to the undue extent to which the
fishery has recently been carried, the yield has greatly fallen off. The
Beduins of the coast, who train slaves as divers, carry on the fishery
during the summer. The price of the shells averages 12-15 piastres tariff
per ohha (21/21hs.), varying according to the size. The largest of the shells
are rarely more than two pounds in weight, and the finest are apt to be per-
forated by worms, in which case they are valueless. The principal mart
on the Red Sea for mother-of-pearl and pearls is Jedda (p. 423), the
seaport, of Mecca. Pearls may sometimes be purchased direct from the
Beduins or their slaves, but they ask more than the pearls are worth in
Europe, 4-5 fr. being often demanded for one of small size. The small
discoloured pearls, though valueless, are also frequently offered for sale.
The Arabs grind them down, and prepare an eye-salve from the powder.

Another common bivalve is the busr (Trtdacna gigas), a huge kind of
olam-shell. The indigestible flesh, called'stommbd.k', is dried and sold
in the markets as an article of food. This shell also yields pearls, but
they are dull and worthless.

Among the univalves the most important is the Bill.c, a kind of whelk,
which the (idari, or cenjurer at fairs, uses as a horn. Large and unstained
Specimens are rare, costing 2-d fr. each. Other large varieties of the
same species are of less value. A very common shell-fish is the large
gemel or abil sub'da (Pterocems lambis), Which has six long finger-
like projections; its flesh is also dried and sold as stcrumbti.k (see
above). The divers frequently bring up specimens of the large malta
(Cassis cornuta) 1 which is of a stone-grey colour externally, and covered
with a thick yellow substance at the mouth, in which cameos may be
cut. The zcad'a, or oowry, or'porcelain shell' as it is sometimes called
(( Fgrpt'aea), and the morsd'a, or eone-shell (Comm), are very abundant and
rarely worth more than a few paras each. A small white cowry is used
in the'troll-madam1 game. A small black-and-yellow striped cowry
(0olumbella mendicaria), known as the silém, is sometimes exported to
the Sildiin, where it is used instead of small coin. The glossy mosm'a
(Nertta poma), which is often found on the sea-shore, is sometimes used
for the same purpose. One of the prettiest shells of the Red Sea is the
abundant small pink warddn or silesiju (Monoclonal Pharaonis) with its
black and white knobs. Among other shells frequently otfered for sale
are the shear, with its long spines, the gilrrirt (Olive), the long conical
mtrwad, or screw shell (Terebra), the large and thin Dobium, and the small
Haliotis, or ear-shell. The nehéd, or top shell (Trachus), and the sdr'a
(Turbo) are sometimes polished with muriatie acid so as to resemble
mother-of-pearl, and are used for ornamental purposes. Black coral, or
yusr, Which realises a high price, is used for the manufacture of rosa-
vies, pipe mouthpieces, and ornaments. The purple dem el akhwdn, 0r
organ coral, is sometimes used as a dye, and the blocks of the porous
coral (Parties) for building purposes. Other kinds of coral, or stony
zoophytes, known as sha'ab, bleached perfectly white, are frequently
seen in the shops. They sometimes resemble roses, trees, leaves, and
bulbous growths. The traveller should, if possible, makea point of seeing
the "*SUBAQUEDUS CORAL FoRMATIoNS, which resemble a scene from
fairyland. A boat is taken in calm weather as far as the slope of the
Coral reef of Sha'ah Which skirts the shore. The coral in the immediate
vicinity of Suez is not So fine as Some of the formations a little farther
oC. Those who are interested in marine zoology should walk along the
clitl's at low tide, when they will find thousands of curious shell-fish and
zoophytes in the pools, under the stones, and On the beach. They may
also amuse themselves by gathering edible mussels, limpets, and sea-
urchins, and watch the eccentric, movements of the orahs. A visit to the
FISII-MARKET is also recommended, where the curious and brightly
coloured members of the tinny trihe are seen to far better advantage than
in a museum. The singular .looking ball-fish (p. 84) is often stuffed and
