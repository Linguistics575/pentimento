Here, between two causeways, each 20 ft. in width, he found a deep band
of soil. on which probably grew a row of trees; and this street was also
provided with a water-eomluit. The side-streets, which were 23 ft. in
width only, wore generally about 300 yds. apart.

Hf the PRIKCIPAL BUILDINGS of ancient Alexandria the relics are now
So scanty that it is impossible to determine the character of the edifices
to which they belonged. (With regard to the so-called Cleopatra's Needle
and Pompey" s Pillar, see pp. 218, 222.) The locality least free from doubt
is the site of the Paneum, which according to Straho (ib., li 10) was'an
artificial circular mound, resembling a rocky hill, to which a winding
way ascends. From its summit one can survey the whole of the sur-
rounding town in every direetion'. This spot is doubtless identical with
the modern K6111 ed-Dik, the highest ground in the town, 112 ft. in height,
where the reservoir of the waterworks fp. 216) is now situated.

The Gymnasium, according to Prof. Kiepert, who has minutely examined
the plans of Nal.untit1-Bey, and not the Sema and Museum, occupied the
site of the old German consulate and its garden.'The most beautiful
building, however,' says Straho (ilr, ยง8),'is the Gymnasium, with its
eolnnnades, which are more than astadium in length. In the middle lie
the courts of justice and groves'.

The theatre, the Sema or Soma, and the Museum were situated
in the quarter of the Royal Palaces (p. 200J, which belonged to the
Bruchium (p. 209), and occupied'a fourth or even a third part of the
whole extent of the city' (ib., li 8). This quarter must have lain to the
N. of the great street leading to the Canopie Gate, and to the S. of
Loehias, and must have adjoined the harbour and'all thatlay beyond it'.
The Alexandrian Theatre lay opposite the island of Antirrhodus (p. 209),
in accordance with the eustom that obtained at Greek seaports of placing
theatres where they could command a view of the sea. Speaking
of the Sema, Straho (ib., e 8) describes it as'another part of the royal
buildings, an enclosed space, within which are the tombs of the kings
and that of Alexander. For Ptolemy Lagi had taken away the body of
the latter from Perdieeas, who had brought it from Babylon.... Now
Ptolemy brought the body of Alexander to Alexandria and buried it where
it now lies, though not in the same coffin. The present coffin is of hyalus
(glass or alabaster), but the former was of gold, which was carried
"hy Ptolemy.... surnamed Parisaetus, son of Coeees' (probablyPto-
lemy XI. Alexander IO. - A sarcophagus carried off by the French, and
afterwards captured by the English and deposited in the British Museum,
was once supposed to be that of Alexander, but, when the hieroglyphics
upon it were rleeiphered, they were found to have no reference to him.

The Museum, like the Sema, belonged to the quarter of the royal
palaces, and probably stood on the spot where some huge ruins, since
described by Brugsch, were discovered in 1853 when a Greek school was
being built. These ruins lay on the S. side of the Place 3riihdmet-hll and
to the. W. of Cleopatra's Needle, a site which would correspond with the
quarter of the palaces. The library undoubtedly was connected with the
Museum, and it is noteworthy that among these ruins a hollowed stone
was found bearing the inscription,'Dioskorides, 3 vols.', though it can
hardly have been used as a receptacle for scrolls. From these walls, now
huried beneath the earth, once flowed a copious stream of knowledge,
the hem) iits of which continue to he traceable even at the present day.
According tn Straho (ib., ยง8), the Museum contained'a hall for walking,
another tor sitting, and a large building with the dining-room of the
nchulars residing: at the Museum. The society also possesses revenues in
common, and the Museum is presided over by a priest, formerly appointed
by tle kings. but now by the cmperor'. This'hall for wMking' was an
extensive court shaded with trees and provided with fountains and benches,
while the hall for sitting was used for purposes of business and study.
The latter was a covered eolonnade, closed on one side, where the scholars
nssnnhhd, and where their pupils, thirstiug for knowledge, listened to
the llrt'uvpis of their masters. Like all the Egyptian dining-halls, that of
the Blum-um pruhahly had a flat roof, a polished pavement, and a halustrade
