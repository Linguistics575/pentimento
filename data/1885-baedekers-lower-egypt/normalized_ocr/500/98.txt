76 TREES AND PLANTATIONS.




probably also the small quantit) employed in the construction of
their temples. The best proof of the scarcity of good timber in
Egypt is afforded by the fact that syeamore-wood, one of the
worst possible kinds owing to the knottiness and irregularity of
its grain, has been laboriously manufactured into eoffins and
statues. Mehammetl'Ali, a great patron of horticulture, at one
time offered prizes for the planting of trees, but his tyfl'orts were
unattended with success, as the climatic and other diffieulties at-
tending the task were then but imperfectly understood in Egypt.
His sneeessors were sworn enemies to trees of every kind, and they
were content that their palaces should be exposed to the full glare
of the sun. The lihedive lsma'il, however, at length revived the plans
of his celebrated ancestor, and hy the engagement of M. Barillet
[ 1869), superintendent of the gardens of Paris, one of the most
skilful landscape-gardeners of the (lay, introduced an entirely new
feature into Egyptian scenery. This enterprising and able man Hn-
fortunately died (_1874) before all his plans had been carried out,
hat the eye of every1lPw-eomer will rest with pleasure on the parks
and gardens for which Egypt is indebted to him. While, for example,
the traveller had formerly to ride all the way to the Pyramids Over
sterile soil. exposed to the scorching rays of the sun, he now drives
eomfortahly thither in a carriage on a well-shaded road. M. liarillet's
most important works are the Ezhekiyeh Garden at Cairo, the ex-
tensis e pleasure-groumls at Gezireh, and the plantation oftrees whieh
shades the roads on the left bank of the Nile, opposite the city.
Hundreds of thousands of trees were planted within a few years,
and their annually increasing shade has converted many of the
dusty and stifling roads in and around Cairo into pleasant prome-
nades. The finest of all these trees, both On account ofits um-
hrageonsness and the excellence of its wood, and one, which thrixes
admirably, is the lebbel: (Alhizzia Lebbek), which has long been
erroneously called by travellers the aeaeiu of the Nile, (the latter
being properly the tsun! tree). Within forty years the lehhek attains
a height of 80 ft. and fl great thiekness, while the hrauehes pro-
jeet to a long distance over the roatls, densely covering them with a
dense leafy vanepy within a remarkably short time. Thus, an avenue
planted in 1860 near the German Protestant church already forms
a viymplote arcade over the road. Another very valuable and interest-
ing property of the tree is, that enttings consisting of hram-hes more
than a foot thiek, and CVcll portions of the trunk, will strike root
and thrive, while in the ease of most other trees the cuttings must
t-unsist of mere twigs. In the course of a single summer the. shady
avenues leadingr to the Pyramids were thus formed. About two
hundred (lill'erent kinds of trees, ehielly of IC. Jiulian origin, are now
planted in the parks of the Khetlive (about twenty in number), and
they are constantly multiplied in nurseries laid out for the purpose.
