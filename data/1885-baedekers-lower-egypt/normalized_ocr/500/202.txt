Panels or friezes bearing inscriptions of this character pmduve
wry rich and pleasing appearance. When viewed from a moderate
distance, especially if enhanced by colouring, the broad characters
stand out with great trffeet. The ground then resembles a network
of lace, the delicate lines of the arabesques being indistinguish-
able except on close inspection. Sultan Tasan's mosque (p. 960)
contains a remarkably handsome frieze of this description. The
large and bold characters on the m0sr111es or private houses which
strike the eye of the traveller are almost invariably texts from the
liorin, while historical notices in a small running character are
often inscribed on marble slabs over the entrances and the lattice-
work of thesehils, where they are sometimes earvedin wood. Similar
inscriptions also occasionally occur in the halls of the interior.
The observer can scarcely fail to be struck with the apparently
vaprieious wayin which this ornamentation is distributed, the artist
liming sometimes lavished the whole richness of his arahesques
upon certain spots to the neglect of others. When this peculiarity
is more closely examined, it will he found that the parts thus
favoured are - (r) the Portals, which are embellished with a
framework of rich friezes, with rosettes to mark certain points,
with artistic sculpturing on the arehitrave, and with pendents in I
the ceiling of the niche; (2) the hliimrets, which it was customary
to place over or adjacent to the portals, but seldom from structural
motives; (3) the external surfaces of the Dome, which are sometimes
covered with arahesques, and sometimes with roll-mouldings
or wreaths; (A) the Kihla, with its handsome border, its capitals
and columns, which are often rich and beautiful, its fine mosaies,
its miniature pseudo-arcades; (5) the Pondents in the interior of
mausolenms; or) the Ceilings; [ 7) the Mamhar (pulpit), which is
partly in stone and partly in wood. The lattiee-work, windows,
doors, couches or sofas (dikkch), lanterns, and lamps are also myeh
ornamented. These last are sometimes made of very curious
enamelled glass, but few are now to be found in the mosques.
Colour does not perhaps play quite so conspicuous a part in the
r'o1r, ypto-Arabian monuments as in the Spanish; but the Egyptian
artists, like those ofthe Alhambra, were also much addicted to the
useofhright rolonrs, especially red, blue, yellow, gold, and white.
The ground of the decorative inscriptions is frequently deep blue,
while the letters are usually gilded. On the whole, however.

the artists showed a. certain appreciation ot'perspective by painting
the lower parts of their walls, with dark colours and gradually
shading them upwards with lighter and more brilliant tints. In

that tho I% ptian artists aimed at producing effect by contrasts.
