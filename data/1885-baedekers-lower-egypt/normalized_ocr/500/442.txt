in the reign of Psammetikh I. and extended at intervals dow n to the
time of the last of the Ptolemies, form a series of vaults on both
sides of a lofty horizontal corridor hewn in the solid rock. These
chambers average 26 ft. in height, and their pavement and vaulted
ceilings are constructed of excellent Mokattam stone. The passages
into which they open have an aggregate length of 380 yds., and
are about "iii ft. in width and

171/2 ft. in height. Twenty-
four of the chambers still con-
tain the huge saroophagi in
which the Apis mummies were
deposited. These monster eof-
fins average 13 ft. in length,
7ft. in width, and lift. in
height, anil no less than 65 tons
in weight. The covers, five of
which are composed of separate
pieces of stone cemented to-
gether, have in several instances
been pushed on one side, and
on the top of some of them the
Arabs, for some unexplained
reason, have built rude masses
of masonry. All the sarcophagi,
when discovered by Mariette,
had been emptied of their con-
tents, with the exception of
two, which still contained a number of trinkets.

Twenty-four ot' the saroophagi are of granite, but three of them
only bear inscriptions, briefly recording the name of the king by
whom they were erected. One of these sarcophagi bears the name
of Amasis [ the last king but one of the. 26th Dynasty), another
that of Cambyses, and a third that of Khabbash (p. 94), a king of
the house of the Suites, who gained possession of the throne dur-
ing the reign of Darius and occupied it until the second year of
Xerxes, The cartouehes on a fourth sarcophagus, dating from one
of the later Ptolemies, are empty. The most instructive relics
found here were the'Apis Sleles', or small stone votive tablets pre-
sented by pilgrims to the shrine of the bull last interred, and
which, it is said, could only be received within seventy days of
the sacred animal's death. These tablets during the earliest period
were attached to the basement of the small temple of Apis erected
above the vault, and afterwards to the wall which shut "the
vault from the main passage. As time rolled on, they were set
up at a still greater distance from the tomb, although, ouriously
enough, specially favoured persons were permitted to place Stu-
tucltcs, hearing inscriptions similar to those on the steles, near the
