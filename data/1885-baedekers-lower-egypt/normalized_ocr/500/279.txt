eraut vendors of different kinds of sw0etn1cats, which to Europeans
look very uninviting. Thus, sultlab is a thin jelly made of wheat-
stareh and sugar, the sellers of which shout,
'luzlriweh, yt sukkar bimismlir yo, Zwlr'mneh!'
(confection, o sugar, for a nail, 0 coli-
feetiou 2). These vendors, who resemble the
rag and bone collectors of European towns,
often barter their wares for nails or pieces
of old iron, as their call indicates. Lastly,
there are Itinerant cooks, with portable kit-
chews, who sell small meat puddings, fish,
and other eomestibles, and whose customers
eat their dinners sitting eross-legged by
the side of the street. This custom is no-
ticed by the old German geographer Se-
bastian Miinster (d. 1552 ], who says that
'the city of Cairo is said to be five times
as large as Paris. There are fewpeople, who,
as with us, buy food to prepare at home; but
when they are hungry they buy from the
cooks, of whom the city contains nearly thirty thousanrl'.

light, o lemons'; i. e., he
will make light, or empty
the baskets containing the
lemons); "asal pr) burtulaht,

ney);'meded yd Embdbeh
