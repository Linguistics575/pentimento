the seputehral mound of I.lotstm Abt ZennehChorse of Abi) Zenneh),
on which the Beduius, in passing, throw a stone or a handful of
sand, as a mark of contempt, exciaiming--'here is food for the
horse of Abt: Zennel1.' The story goes, that an Arab called Abil
Zenneh cruelly over-rode his mare, and, when she broke down,
spurred her so violently, that she gave a final, long bound, and
then dropped down dead. The hard-hearted rider marked the
marvellous length of the last leap of his horse with stones, and
every passer-by now adds to the heap in token of disapproval.

A little farther on we obtain a tine view: facing us rises the
three-peaked (larb0.t el-Jemel (p. 5'24), to the S.E. tower the
summits of the Jebel Serbttl and the Jebel el-Ileru'il, to the left
are the heights of Et-Tih, and to the right the Jebel f.famrtuhn
Farytn and Jebel Usé't. We nest cross the Ph hr.) W/idi Uyat,
which contains several pools of water and palm saplings, and
which has erroneously been identified with the Elim of the Bible
(see abovd). The only circumstance in favour of this theory is, that
the Wtuli Uyit. is more distant from the Wiidi Irasvtra (Marah) than
the Wtuli Gharandel, which, however, lies much nearer the latter
than a full day's journey.

About 2 hrs. beyond the above-mentioned hillock of stones we
enter the Witch Nuurhuh, a spacious basin enclosed and traversed
by low sand-hills, and lying at the base of the Jehel Uytt. and

Jebel 1.larnmim I? aru1n.

The Jehel Eammém Farrian (1567 ft. above the sea-level), or the'Bath
of Pharaoh', is must ennveniently ascended from this point, and is ehielly
interesting to geologists. Half-a-day at least is required for the excur-
sion, and the traveller should be provided with refreshments. The
mountain is in the form of a blunted pyramid, with a very extensive
base; the limestone on its slopes is remarkably jagged and furrowed.
At several places there are warm springs, which are still used by the
Arabs, particularly as a. cure for rheumatism. Before using the water
they are in the habit of presenting a cake or other offering, 1.0 the, spirit
of Pharaoh, which still Iraunts the spot, in order to propiliate hint. One
tradition is, that Pharaoh still lies here in the hot water, where he is
to he eternally boiled for his sins. Another legend is to the eiTeet, that,
when Pharaoh was drowned in the Red Sea, he saw Noses standing on
a rock of the Jehe ] IJanuyiim FarTsn, and was so infuriated at the sight,
that the water closing over him was spouted up to a great height by the
violence of his panting. Ever since then his spirit has haunted this
Spot, and every ship that approaches the Jebel JJarntniim t? arTon is
deemed to sink. - This legend is supplemented by another, which is also
told by the Arabs, that, when the Jews would not believe that Pharaoh
was really drowned, God ordered the sea to throw up his body. Since then
bodies of drowned persnns have heen invariably cast up on the beach.

'The caverns in the Jebel 1.larntni'im Far" iln, which are frequently
tubular in form and resemble lung pipes, slope rapidly downwards in the
direutiun (if the, strata of the rock, fmm w. to E. and from s.w. to
NIL, emnmunieating, doubtless, with the hot springs, as I found them
enmpietely fliied with steam. 1n the largest of these caverns, the
entrance of which is 13 ft. wide, and which lies several fethums aheve
the hot springs, Tobserved, at a distance of6 ft. from the entrance,
that the temperature was 102° Faint, while that of the outer air: was 90".
The vapor which filled the chamber had a. suiphureolls 51nd ], and a
slight inerustation of sulphur covered the wall atpraces.' (J. Russegger.)
