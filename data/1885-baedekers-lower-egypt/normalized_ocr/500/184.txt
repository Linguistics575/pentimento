are necessarily stereotyped. There seems, however, tohave been 11
retrogression in point of technical skill; for, as in the time of
lihafra, the hardest materials still became compliant, and the dif-
tleuities ot' the minutest detail were still successfully overeoxne by
the sculptors of the Pharaohs.

Another considerable break new took place in the progress of
l-Igyptian art. This dreary interval began with the invasion of
the llyksos or Shepherds, and lasted throughout
the whole of their domination. To them is at-
tributed the destruction of the older monuments,
and they themselves have left 110 architectural Ile-
mains behind them. They were not, -however,
entirely insensible to the charms of art, and after
the first terrors of the invasion were over, they

F. t did not prevent the Egyptian artists from prose-
J T outing their calling. As the Normans in Sicily
adopted the culture of the conquered Arabs, so

l the 1lyksos turned to account. the knowledge of

- art and the technical skill possessed by the Egyp-
tians. The sculptures excavated at Tanis, the cap-
ita ] of the 1Iyksos (four sphinxes and particu-
larly a group of river-gods in granite), are of
Egyptian workmanship, and there is nothing to
betray their origin in the llyksos period except
the type of the features, the bushy beards, and
the thick tufts of hair.

With the expulsion of the lkasos begins a
newperiod, in the history of art as well as in that

of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, in
particular, have perpetuated. their memory by
astonishingly numerous monuments. The compulsory labour of
s'aptive enemies afforded the architects an opportunity of carrying
out their most gigantic designs, while the achievements of their
sovereigns, such as the campaigns of Thethmes, Ansenophis, and
ltamses, supplied the sculptors with an inexhaustible theme for
the decoration of the fagades of their temples. To this period of
the new empire belong most of the Tluyban monuments. The taste
fer the great and the colossal, and for symmetry of proportion had
attained its culminating point, but the stagnation of the lifesprings
