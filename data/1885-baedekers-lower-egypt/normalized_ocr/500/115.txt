Psmnmetikh II. (Psammis, or Psamm'uthis).

Uahbra (Gr. Apries or Uaph-ris; the Haphmh of the
Bibhi), observing that the Ilabylouians were eneroaeh-
ing on Palestine, fitted out an army and fleet, cap-
tured Sidon, defeated the Cyprians and the Tyrians in a
naval battle, and marched to the relief of Zedekiah, King of
Judah, who was besieged in Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.
That city having been again besieged by Nehuchadnezzar
and captured, Uaphris accorded an asylum to its exiled
inhabitants. Ile afterwards sustained a defeat from Bat-
tms 11., King of Gyrene, in consequence of which his army
rebelled against him. Aahmes, "who had been dispatched by
him to treat With the insurgents, was then proclaimed king',
and he himself was dethroned.

Aahmes II. (Gr. Amnsis; p. 3S (f) succeeded in securing
his supremacy by alliances with Cyrene, with the tyrant
Polyerates of Samos, and with the Greeks. IIe assigned land
to foreign colonists, granting them religious toleration, and
diverted the stream of commerce from the semi-Phoenieian
cities of the Delta (Tanis, Mendes, and Bilhastis) towards
the Greek city ofNaueratis (see p'207j. During his reign the
country enjoyed peace and prosperity, but the balance of
power among the great nations of that era underwent a coll--
siderable change. Cyrus had meanwhile founded the vast Per-
sian empire, and consolidated it by means of the conquest of
the Babylonian and Lydian kingdoms. His son Cambyses next
marched against Egypt, the only great power which still
rivailed Persia. Having advanced to Pelusinm with a large
army, he there defeated Psammetikh III., son of Amasis,
who was now dead (p. 374'), captured Memphis, and
took the king prisoner. 1'sammetikh was afterwards executed
for attempting to organise an insurrection to shake off the
foreign yoke.

Cambyses (Pets. Jratnbtusiyaff., Egypt. Kembut; pp. 374,
386, 4-16) at tirst behaved with great moderation. He
tolerated the Egyptian religion, and to his own name he
added the Egyptian agnomen of Rumesut, or'child of the
sun'. After, however, he had failed in several rash enter-
prises, such as his campaigns against the inhabitants of the
oasis of Ammon and against the Ethiopians, his temper
'became soured, and his conduct violent and cruel. He died
at Aebatana in Syria, while marching to Persia against



Gaumatrt, a usurper who personated Burdiyn (Gr. Smerdis),
