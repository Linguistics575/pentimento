SS HISTORY.

Under this Dynasty the sceptres of Upper and Lower
Egypt were united. All the kings were powerful and pros-
perous, and art again flourished. The Sun Temple at Helio-
polis (see p. 33r) was nsagnifieontly restored, and in the
Fayt'im the yraetiee of building pyramids was revived (see
p. i50 at squ. During this period, too, fortifieations were
erected on the N.E. frontier of the kingdom which appear
to have extended across the whole ot the present Isthmus of
Suez (p. /r,5il.

The Hyksos Period (pp.'y08, 373, 3153, 479).

In the 12th Dynasty we already hear of Semitic families
applying' for admission to Upper Itgyptt, and in the 13th
Dynasty these iuomigrations became more frequent. The.
newcomers met with kinsmen in the seaports of the Delta,
allied with "hem and 11ith Arabian tribes they at length
became so powerful as to defeat the armies of the Pharaohs
and ohtain possession ol' the whnie of Lower Iigypt. They
made Tanis their capital, and under the name Onyksos
ruled over N.ligypt t'ertiie centuries, while the exiled royal
family was compelled to retire to Lpper Evypt. (The name
of'll.vksos', according: to Josephus,) lanetho, and others,
is derived from hyk, a king, and sos, a shepherd, and thus
signifies'shephortl kings'; some modern authorities, how-
ever, derive it from huh shasu, signifying g tehher Kings'.)
The llyhsos soon eont'urmed to the enuient culture of the
valley of the Nile. They applied the name ol' the Egyptian
god Set to their own gods (lte'aiim); and the sphinws
preserved at Tanis with the portrait-heads of their Lines
(p. "298) prove that they took l'lgyptian artists into their ser-
vice, and perhaps themselves: m-quireti a knowledge of the
tigyptian plastic art (p.1ti'l). At the same timethey adopt-
od all the titles oi' the Pharaohs and the, whole of the 001111;
ceremonies, of the legitimate monarchs ol' tigypt. ff
