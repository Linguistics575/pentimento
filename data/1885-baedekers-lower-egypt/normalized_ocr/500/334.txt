We now turn to the left and enter the -

Salle historique de I'0uest. This room contains historical steles
of various epochs and also the monuments of the period of the
IIyksos (p. 88), which is represented in Europe by a solitary head
in the Villa Ludovisi at Rome. - In the centre of the room: **107.
Ikasos Sphinx in black granite, from Tanis, the restored parts re-
cognisable by their darker hue.

The head shows the coarse and foreign-looking features of the raee
which oppressed Egypt for so long a period. An inscription on the right
shoulder, almost efTaced, mentions Apepi (Apophis), one of the last Hyksos
kings. hlerenptah, the Pharaoh of the Exodus, and Ramses II. sub-
seqnently caused their names to be inscribed on the base, and Museums,
of the 21st dynasty, engraved his on the breast of the statue.

106. Head of a Sphinx, resembling No. 107, with the name of
Merenptah, added at a later date. - 108. Saerifieial tablet of black
granite, with the name of the 1lyksos king Apepi. - 100. Torso
of a Hyksos statue in grey granite, found at Mit Far√©s in the Faytun,
and thus proving that the Hyksos dominion extended at least as
far as this district.

123. Double statue of grey granite, found at Tanis and dating
from the Hyksos period.

Two foreign-looking figures are standing before the saeriiieial tables,
which are lavishly adorned with aquatic plants fBasphttiv), iishes, and
birds. The features of the figures resemble those of the sphinxes; their
matted beards, their plaited hair, and the bracelets On their arms dis..
tinguish them strongly from the figures on other Egyptian monuments.
The name of Psusenues, engraved both on the front and on the back of
the monument, was added at a later date.

**89. Stale of the Diadoch, in black granite, found in 1870
among the ruinous foundations of the mosque of Shtklnh1 in Cairo.

In the arch above the proper inscription is a representation of Pto-
lemy J. Lagi (p. OO), before his accession to the throne. He is still styled
a'satrap' here, but the empty cartouehes adjoining his figure seem to
indicate that he is free to ascend the throne. On the left he is consecrat-

ing to Horus, the avenger of his father, a piece of planted land a

and on the right he is presenting gifts to Isis-Buto, the tutelary goddess
of the cities of Peh and Top. The inscription extols the satrap Ptolemy
as a hero, who brought back from Asia to the Nile the treasures removed
from the temples of Egypt, and who fixed his residence in the'Fortress
of' Alexander' A, which was formerly called Ithakotis' (Le. Alexandria).
llis victories over Syria and the western regions of Egypt, and his be-
nciicenee to the gods of Egypt are also praised, and there follows a eulo-
ginm of his liberality in renewing a grant to the goddesses (Le. to the
priests) of the cities of Peh and Tep, the so-called quarters of Buto,
whose worship had been abolished by the'Arch-enemy Xerxes'.

**127. Celebrated monument of the time of Thotlmies 111, in
black granite [ 19th ilym; Karnak).

The upper part of the inscription was erased by Khn-en-aten, whu
overthrew the worship of Ammon in Thebes, or hy some other early
monarch, but was afterwards restored. perhaps by Ramses 11. The traces
of this double change are distinctly visible on the upper hulfofthe stele.
Jiclow is CHI inscription in 251ines Celebrating the victories of Thothmes ill.
in a highly poetic, manner. This monument was often copied hy suh-
w-quent dynasties to celebrate the exploits of Seti I. and Ramses ill.
