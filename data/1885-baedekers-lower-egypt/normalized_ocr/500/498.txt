a paltry sum is this compared with the value of the lost lend!" (Stephan).

The operation of draining the lake has been begun, partieu-

the traveller sees nothing of the low, sandy coast until the steamer
reaches the yellowish-green water near it, which is rendered turbid by the
mud of the Nile. The lighthouse and the masts of vessels at anchor in
