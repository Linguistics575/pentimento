R', Cairo. TANTA. 2. Route. 225

As far as B13151; the train follows the W. bank of the Rosetta branch
of the Nile, skirting the boundary between the Libyan desert and the
cultivated Delta of the Nile. The stations between Tell e1-Biiriit1 and
Biiliil.c are Ji6ra Hamddeh, E.t-?'avyeh, Rafe deud, El-Warddn, and El-
Jfendslii. The station at B11151; is nearly It/s M. from the Muski. Car-
riages not always to be had.

The cultivated land becomes richer, and we pass villages,
groups of trees, and even tamarisks. The train reaches the broad
Rosetta arm of the Nile, crosses it by a long iron bridge (flue
view to the left), and enters the station of C05 M.) Kafr ez-
Zaiyit (second station at which the express stops, 2 hrs. after
leaving Alexandria; halt of 20 mi11.; restaurant). The town, which
carries on a busy trade in grain, cotton, and the other products of
the Delta (p. 73 ], lies on the right bank of the river. Excursion
to the ruined site of Sais, the modern Sc? el-Hager, see R. 8, d.

The Delta in Winter.'The fields are still wet at places, and straight
canals are seen in every direction. All the cereals grown in ancient times
still flourish here, and the slender palm still rears its fruit-laden Crown
beside the less frequent sycamOre, with its slender umbrageous foliage.
The eirtton-plants ere Successfully cultivated where the soilis well irrigated,
and form extensive plantations of underwood, bearing a profusion of yer.
low, red, and white blossoms, which somewhat resemble wild roses.
Vineyards are rare, bat they sometimes occur in the northern part of
the Delta, the plants being trained on the trelliswork which we often
see represented in the paintings ot the ancient Egyptian tombs. The
water-wheels (sitlsiyeh) are turned by buffaloes and donkeys, and some-
times by camels or by steam; and the water-pail (shLifif), though less
common than in Upper Egypt, is occasionally plied by slightly clad men
and boys. The canals are flanked with emhankments to protect the fields
from inundation, and the paths on these banks are enlivened with strings
of camels, donkeys with their riders, and men, women, and children on
foot. From a distance the villages look like round, grey hillocks, full of
openings, and around them rise dovecots and palm-trees. 0n closer
examination we distinguish the mud-huts, huddled together on rising
ground where they are safe from the inundation. Many of these hamlets
are adorned with very handsome groups of palms, while the minarets
which overtop the larger villages and towns seem to point as devoutly
to heaven as our Gothic chureh-spires'. (Ebers,'i? roshen', etc.)

76 M. Tanya. [ 33/4 hrs. from Alexandria, 11/2111'. from Cairo).

Opposite the station is an Inn kept by a Greek, which looks not
uninviting. The Greek Restaurant on the Canal, near the Bazaar, is pa-
tronised by European merchants from Cairo and Alexandria during the
fair of Tanta.
