the N.E. and then towards the N.W., and at length reach the Wtdi
SelWtyeh, at the 8.1%. base of the Jebel Mtrsa, recognisable by its
church and monastery. (Towards the N. the Wtuli Sebtftyeh is
eouneeted with the Wédi esh-Shékh by the Mrddi Sadad; comp.
p. 520). A saddle of moderate height separates the MGdf Seba'iyeh
from the Wédi ed-Dtr ('valley of the monastery'). To the left, on
the precipitous Jebel Mt1sa, which is quite perpendicular at the
top, we perceive the zigzags of the road constructed by rAbbas
Pasha (p. 510). We at length descend the narrow Mrtuli ed-Dér
[ Shu'aib), and reach the lofty walls of the monastery of St.
Catharine (see p. 503).

CA) THROUGH THE WADI HEBBAN. 1st Day. For one hour we
ascend a gradual slope with a saline soil to the Umm Sa'ad, where
a spring of fresh water affords support to a few families. The
waterskins should be filled here, and a supply of dates purchased, as
the desert of El-Kcifa, 6 hrs. in width, has now to be traversed. We
follow the road of rAbbas Pasha, which, though sometimes covered
with sand on the low ground, is always suftieiently marked to in-
dicate the direction to the Wtdi Hebran. For the first hour or two
we pass a number of dtm-palms, but these also at length disappear.
A single seyal-tree stands about halfway, but otherwise we are Bur-
rounded by the hot desert, which is at first covered with fine sand,
afterwards with rubble, and at length with enormous blocks of stone
in the vicinity of the precipitous mountains. The Wiidi Wbrkn
is reached about sunset. At the point where it issues from the
mountains it is a deep and very narrow rocky ravine. A rocky re-
cess close to the entrance affords quarters for the flrst night.

2nd Day. The route through the Wtuli IJebrin winds consider-
ably; the formation is granite, in which syenite predominates; it
coutains thick veins of hornblende, slate, geenstone, and various
kinds of basalt. The volume of the brook varies according to the
season; its banks are bordered with vegetation. The path, which
is comparatively good, and passes a number ofSinaitic inscriptions,
was to have been converted into a earriage-road by rAbbas Pasha,
but his plan was never carried out. After 13/4 hr. the valley di-.
vides, and the road of rAhbtvs Pasha leads to the N. At a second
bifurcation Ph hr.) the valley expands, and in ihhr. more we
reach a clear and abundant spring, but disagreeahly warm. The
tarfa bushes and palms here form an impenetrable thicket. Water
now disappears (10 min. "), the vegetation becomes scantier, and
we, proceed to cfoss the precipitous Nah!) cl-'Ejjfiwi (3290 ft.).
Our quarters for the second night are near the Wildi fReM/'fp, 50f).
(m the third day we reach the direct route leading from Mt. Ser-.

hm to the Nalib el-Htiwi, etc. (see p. 501 ].

The first day from the monastery of Si. Catharine is generally short an
account of the late start. - On the 2nd Day the watershed between the
Gulf of Suez and that of ultaba is crossed, and the Wddi klatt traversed.
