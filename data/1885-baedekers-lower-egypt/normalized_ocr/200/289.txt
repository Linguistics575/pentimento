The New Town of Isma'iliya. was begun about the year 1865,
when the Khedive presented sites here gratuitously to any one who
would undertake to erect on each a house worth at least 30,000 h.
"ithin eighteen months. Most of the houses are architecturally
uninteresting, but there is a fair sprinkling ofhandseme buildings,
} At the end of the Iruskr, on the left, is the small place named

Atub el- Yadra (Pl. 0, 3). lt was formerly adorned with an eques-
trian statue of Ibrahim Pasha, but this was removed during the re-
volution of 1882 and is now in the magazine of the 12mm; Museum.
01) the W. side of the place is the International Tribunal Pl. 90,
C 4; p. 7), hey end which is the Theatre ancais Jr. 9). 0n
the S. side of the Ezhekiyeh is the Opera House LPI. 75), end to the
right of it (W) the, ponderous New Hotel (Pl. a). [ Opposite, on the
W. side of the Ezbekiyeh, is a large house belonging to Sign. Maw
tatia, the banker, built in the Louis NV. style, and let out in guur-
tiem. To the W. of the Now Hotel are the Gcnnan Church (P1. IO)
and the Englia'h Church (PL 8), which still lacks its spire, Still
farther to the W. is the residence of lr. Delort, the banker, in the
early Arabian style, the interior of whieh, partly fitted up with
relies from old Arabian houses, is worthy ofa visit. The ministerial
ortiecs and several palaces of the lihetlive, including the Patais
'Abidin (thi, built in the form of a horse-shoe, are also situated
in this new quarter of the city. Opposite the Palais'Abidin is the
thin ei- Br 25f, or government office for mosques and other ee-
clesiastieal property. The consulates are also all in this ncigh-
bfmrheed (comp. p. 232). Near the French consulate (PL 10; O, 5)
is the house of Count St. Maurice, in the Arabian style, now occu-
pied by the French'r0nsul-ger1erc'rt. The palaces of the Egyptian
gmndees are generally enclosed by high walls, so that only the roofs
are visible to passers-by. Some of them will be briefly mentioned
when we have occasion to pass them (pp. 3517, 341),

It need havdly be added that the traveller in search of Oriental
srenes will not care to devote much time to this modern and almost
entirely Thrropoan quarter, but uill hasten to make acquaintance
with the Arabian parts of the city
