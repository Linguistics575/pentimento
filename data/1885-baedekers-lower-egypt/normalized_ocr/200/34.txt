ln conclusionY we may add that most of the dragnmans are fond
oi'assuuliuga patronising manner towards their employers, while
they generally treat their own countrymen with an air of vast
superiority. The sooner this impertinence is checked, the more
satisfactory will be the travellers subsequent relations with his
guide; and the hints already given with reference to the traveller's
intercourse with the natives may not unfrequcntly be applied to
tho dmgunmus themselves. On the successful termination of the
journey travellers are too apt from motives of good nature to write
a mor0, favourable testirnonial for their (lmgoman than he really
deserves; but this is truly an act of injustice to his subsequent
employers, and tends to Ironf'trin him in his faults. The testimonial
therefore should not omit to mention any serious cause for dis-
satisfaetiou. Information with regard to dragomans (name, languages
spoken, conduct, and charges) will always be gratefully received
by the Editor of the Ilamlhooh for the benclit oflater editions.

articles of tho toilet, will amply suffiee. It is advisable, for the pre-
vention of colds and chills, to wear a woollen fabric noxttho skin;
