or'the upper', was erected by Monkeura, the Mykerinos of Hero-
dotus. Tho rock on which it stands has a shelving surface, and
the necessary horizontal site was formed by building up a ped-
cstal of mmrmous blocks, instead of by removing a portion "the
rock The stones of which the Pyramid is constructed are remark-
ably large and well hewn. The lower part of it is covered with
slabs ofpolishcd granite, aml the upper part with rough stones. The
incrustatiou and tho material which once tllled the angles of the
p.xtttrior am now so tlhmagml that the tiers of the internal nucleus
are, almost e el'ywltere visible. On the bl. side art'rolics of a temple
