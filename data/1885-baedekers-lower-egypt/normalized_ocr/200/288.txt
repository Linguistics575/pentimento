The Ezbekfyeh and the New lrma'fliyu Quarter,

The ventral point of the lsma'iliya (hunter fp. 258), which is
intersected by broad and shadeless streets bearing French names,
is the -

Place Ezbekiyeh CPI, c, i, ll, or simply the l-IzbeIcTyeh, which
is named after the heroic Emir Iizbek, the general of Sultan
Knit Rey fp. 968 ], who brought the general and son-Ur-law of lla-
jesid I. Asa captive to kruiro. Amosque was erected here in honour
of his victory; and, though the building no longer exists, its name
still attaches to the site. This was once the focus of the Oriental
traNe of Cairo, hut the native industries have gradually to a great
extent been absorbed by Europeans. The principal hotels, several
of the consulates, numerous cafes, palatial dwelling-houses, hand-
some shops, and the theatms are situated in this inapitieentpluee,
in the centre of which are Pleasure Grounds, with the luxuriant
vegetation peculiar to the marvellous climate of Egypt. The gat-

/lora, to supply the place of grass, which does not thrive in this
dry climate. The grounds are open to the public in the foreman,
but in the afternoon a charge of 10 paras silver (no change given)
is made for admission. Au Egyptian band, whieh (generally per-
forms European music, plays here daily from i) to ahoutS Fm.
Among the other attractions of the place are several catés, a ther.
tro, where Italian comedies are performed in summer (p. 233), a
French restaurant, where a good supper is procumble, and a pho-
tographer's studio. An attilleial hill with a belvcdere commands
a line view, and belo" it is a pretty grotto. The garden "as at first
visited almost exclusively by Europeans, but it is gradually be-
voming the fashion for Arabs to send their veiled wives and their
children to promenade here, while the Europeans of the hotter
elnsses now treat it with unreasonable neglect. The trees, shrubs,
and llowera thrive admirably, the greatest show of blossom being
