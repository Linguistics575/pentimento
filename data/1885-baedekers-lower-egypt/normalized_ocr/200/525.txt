Fayam, LARYRINTII. 9. Route. 461

discovered in 1889 by Mr. Flinders Petrie. The tomb chamber
is 22 ft. long, 8 ft. wide, and 6 ft. high; it Was covered with three
large slabs of stone and contained two srrcoplragi, one of them of
polished sandstone without inseriptio. and fragments of an ala-
baster V8.56 with the name of Amenemha Ill. The chamber was
f'Ou1 with water to a depth of 3 ft.

Towards the S. we observe a eongeries of chambers and passages
of unhunit bricks, hounded by the Baht esls-Sherlsi, and pronounced
by Lepsius to be the right side of the Labyrinth, and the only part
of it which is to some extent preserved. On the other side of the
Pyramid there wag doubtless a similar collection of rooms which has
now disappeared; and several other structures beyond them, of which
traces still remain, must have once existed there. The whole Laby-
rinth must have been in the shape of a horseshoe. Between the wing
of the Labyrinth which still exists, and that which has disappeared,
lies an extensive space strewn with broken pottery, in the middle
of which are large fragments of a mvgr1iiieent ancient temple, The
base ofthe shaft ofa small papyrus column, arul: thapitstl ot' the same
order, both in the red stone of Assmsin, with sculptured stalks and
foliage, are worthy of notice Some blocks disintened here bearing
the, name of Amcncmha Ill. have again been covered with sand.
Several large blocks of limestone are also observed in the middle or
this large court of the Labyrinth. "1'he inscriptions are almost en-
tirely destroyed, but faint traces of painting, and the symbols 0-9



Lia) and (u), are still recognisable. From the traces still ex-

isting, the whole structure would appear to have occupied an area
OESSOO sq. yds., and the large inner court an area of about 60 acres.

The Ancient Labyrinth. According to Bmgseh, the Greek name Laby-
rinthos, which has been Jirrereutly interpreted, is derived from'erps',
""elpuurultrurt', i. e. the. lTemple of the mouth hf the Lake,', The ire
scriptiuns found here by Lepsius wove that it was founded by Amery
emlsa in. of the 12th Dynasty. Herodotus declares that the Laby-
rinth, which was afterwards reckoned as lone of the Wunders of the
world" was so Vast as to surpass all the buildings of the Greeks taken
together and even the Pyramids themselves. Fur the best description
we are indebted to stmho, who visited the Labyrinth in person. He
says:'There. m the Labyrinth here, a work as important as the
Pyrasu'rds, adjoi ihg whieh is the tomb of the king whn built the Laby-
rinth. After advancing about 3040 stadia beyond the first entrance of
