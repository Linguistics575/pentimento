over by governors "their own, and are, independent of the
provincial administration: Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, Port Sa'id,
Damietta, Rosetta, Isma'iiiya, andlastiy the sum ]! seaport of Iioyir

The administration of the Upper Evyptian provinces, and still
moxe those of the N'ulim, is liable to frequent change7 several of
them being sometimes united under a governor-general, and at
other times again disjoined, 0r umnziged by a commission appointed
by the minister of the interior. The recently acquired seaports on
the Red Sea have governors (nmdin) of their own, and they in their
turn are under the supervision of a governor-general (halcmdr'zr)
resident at Kassuia,'I'hese last districts are (or were ] known as
the East birlim, while, the govcxnment of the West blidin was cen-
traliaed at Iilusrthur. Before the outbreak of the revolution the West
